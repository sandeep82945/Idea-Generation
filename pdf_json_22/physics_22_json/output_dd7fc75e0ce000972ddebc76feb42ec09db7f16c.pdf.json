    "abstractText": "The centre of the Milky Way contains stellar populations spanning a range in age and metallicity, with a recent star formation burst producing young and massive stars. Chemical abundances in the most luminous stellar member of the nuclear star cluster (NSC), IRS 7, are presented for 19 F, 12 C, 13 C, 14 N, 16 O, 17 O, and Fe from a local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis based on spherical modelling and radiative transfer with a 25-M model atmosphere, whose chemistry was tailored to the derived photospheric abundances. We find IRS 7 to be depleted heavily in both 12 C ( \u223c\u20130.8 dex) and 16 O ( \u223c\u20130.4 dex), while exhibiting an extremely enhanced 14 N abundance ( \u223c+ 1.1 dex), which are isotopic signatures of the deep mixing of CNO-cycled material to the stellar surface. The 19 F abundance is also heavily depleted by \u223c1 de x relativ e to the baseline fluorine of the NSC, providing evidence that fluorine along with carbon constrain the nature of the deep mixing in this very luminous supergiant. The abundances of the minor isotopes 13 C and 17 O are also derived, with ratios of 12 C/ 13 C \u223c 5.3 and 16 O/ 17 O \u223c 525. The derived abundances for IRS 7, in conjunction with previous abundance results for massive stars in the NSC, are compared with rotating and non-rotating models of massive stars and it is found that the IRS 7 abundances o v erall follow the behaviour predicted by stellar models. The depleted fluorine abundance in IRS 7 illustrates, for the first time, the potential of using the 19 F abundance as a mixing probe in luminous red giants.",

Chemical abundances in the most luminous stellar member of the nuclear star cluster (NSC), IRS 7, are presented for 19 F, 12 C, 13 C, 14 N, 16 O, 17 O, and Fe from a local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis based on spherical modelling and radiative transfer with a 25-M model atmosphere, whose chemistry was tailored to the derived photospheric abundances. We find IRS 7 to be depleted heavily in both 12 C ( \u223c\u20130.8 dex) and 16 O ( \u223c\u20130.4 dex), while exhibiting an extremely enhanced 14 N abundance ( \u223c+ 1.1 dex), which are isotopic signatures of the deep mixing of CNO-cycled material to the stellar surface. The 19 F abundance is also heavily depleted by \u223c1 de x relativ e to the baseline fluorine of the NSC, providing evidence that fluorine along with carbon constrain the nature of the deep mixing in this very luminous supergiant. The abundances of the minor isotopes 13 C and 17 O are also derived, with ratios of 12 C/ 13 C \u223c 5.3 and 16 O/ 17 O \u223c 525. The derived abundances for IRS 7, in conjunction with previous abundance results for massive stars in the NSC, are compared with rotating and non-rotating models of massive stars and it is found that the IRS 7 abundances o v erall follow the behaviour predicted by stellar models.

Although challenging to observe, due to both crowding and xtinction, the NSC offers a valuable stellar population in which o probe both stellar and chemical evolution in a, perhaps, unique nvironment in the Milky Way.\nA recent star formation episode in the NSC, with an age of \u223c10 7 yr, esulted in a collection of both hot and cool massive supergiants, ith a number of O and B stars, along with WR stars comprised oth WN and WC types (Paumard et al. 2006 ; Feldmeier-Krause t al. 2015 ). One member of this young population of stars is the ool M2 supergiant IRS 7, which is the most luminous star in the alactic Centre. IRS 7 was the first star in the Galactic Centre in hich photospheric chemical abundances were derived by Carr,\nM\nS a a i + s 7 A c ( [ r +\no t c e a 1 n i C o 1\n1\na 2 s S e o D d p\nm e t s t p b i t e\no w S\n2\nH w a h 2 H a 1\nw\nD 1 t N s w h c a 7 p 2 m a (\n3 U\nA t e c T P i N s f C e h c m m b d a c t O t\nt l l f m t t\nt w w T b v w \u03be l a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/2801/6675813 by C N R S user on 24 M arch 2023\nellgren & Balachandran ( 2000 ), who found IRS 7 to have an pproximately solar metallicity, with [Fe/H] = \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.13. An dditional study of Galactic Centre stars by Ram \u0301\u0131rez et al. ( 2000 ) ncluded IRS 7 and derived [Fe/H] = + 0.09, or A(Fe) = log(N Fe /N H ) 12.0 = 7.54. A later abundance analysis of several luminous cool tars in the Galactic Centre by Cunha et al. ( 2007 ) also included IRS and they found [Fe/H] = + 0.08, where a solar Fe abundance of (Fe) = 7.45 was adopted, so A(Fe) = 7.53. IRS 7 was one of two ool Galactic Centre supergiants analyzed in detail by Davies et al. 2009 ), who also derived an Fe abundance slightly abo v e solar, with Fe/H] = + 0.13. Taken together, all four studies based upon highesolution spectroscopy yield a consistent Fe abundance of [Fe/H] = 0.07 \u00b1 0.06 (A(Fe) = 7.52) for IRS 7. IRS 7 (2MASS 17454004-2900225) is not only interesting as one f the stars first used to anchor the metallicity of a young star in he Galactic Centre, but also because of its extreme abundances of arbon, nitrogen, and oxygen relative to Fe, as first found by Carr t al. ( 2000 ). That study derived [ 12 C/Fe] = \u22120.68, [ 14 N/Fe] = + 1.06, nd [ 16 O/Fe] = \u22120.62, and noted that the large depletions of carbon2 and oxygen-16, in conjunction with the extreme enhancement of itrogen-14, was the signature of the deep conv ectiv e dredge-up of nterior matter that had been processed through the full H-burning NO cycles. Although the abundance signature of modest depletions f 12 C (typically \u223c\u22120.1 to \u22120.4 dex), moderate enhancements of 4 N (typically \u223c+ 0.4\u2013+ 0.6 dex), and no measurable changes in 6 O, due to red giant first dredge-up have been observed in many bundance studies (e.g. Masseron & Gilmore 2015 ; Martig et al. 016 ; Hasselquist et al. 2019 ; Takeda et al. 2019 ), such quantitative tudies in massive cool supergiants are rare (e.g. Lambert, Dominy & ivertsen 1980 ; Carr et al. 2000 ). The mass of IRS 7 has been stimated by the previous spectroscopic studies to be of 17, 22, r 25 M (Carr et al. 2000 ; Ram \u0301\u0131rez et al. 2000 ; Cunha et al. 2007 ; avies et al. 2009 ; Tsuboi et al. 2020 ), thus detailed abundance eterminations for this massive supergiant are of interest from the erspective of stellar evolution. IRS 7 became the focus of this study as this star is significantly ore massive than the NSC members studied previously by Guer c \u00b8o t al. ( 2022 ), who derived 19 F abundances in the NSC, thus offering he possibility to probe, for the first time, the fluorine abundance in a tar displaying the signature of deeply mixed CNO-cycle material. In his study, abundances of mixing sensitive isotopes and elements, in articular fluorine, in IRS 7 are compared to models of massive stars, oth standard (i.e. non-rotating) and rotating framework, in order to nvestigate possible differences between the model prediction and he derived abundances, as well as possibly shed light on the exact volutionary state of this red supergiant star.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the bservations, in Section 3 , we present the abundance analysis along ith the abundance uncertainties, and the results are discussed in ection 4 .\nOBSERVATIONS\nigh-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectra of IRS 7 were obtained ith the 10-m Keck II Telescope and the NIRSpec spectrograph at resolution R = \u03bb/ \u03bb = 25 000. The NIRSpec spectra analyzed ave S/N \u223c 120 and span the wavelength range between \u03bb23,109\u2013 3,435 \u00c5, containing the rotational\u2013vibrational (v-r) transitions of 19 F(1-0) R9 and R11, which were used in the fluorine abundance nalysis. This spectral region also contains a number of 12 C 16 O and 2 C 17 O v-r lines that were used to determine the 12 C abundance, as ell as the 16 O/ 17 O ratio (Section 3 ).\nNRAS 516, 2801\u20132811 (2022)\nIn addition to the NIRSpec spectrum, a publicly available SDSS R17 (Abdurro\u2019uf et al. 2022 ) APOGEE spectrum of IRS (S/N \u223c 30) was analyzed using the APOGEE line list (Smith et al. 2021 ) o synthesize spectra to determine abundances of the elements C, , O and Fe. IRS 7 was observed as part of the SDSS APOGEE urv e y (Majewski et al. 2017 ) and the observations were taken ith the APOGEE North spectrograph. The APOGEE spectra ave a nominal resolving power R = \u03bb/ \u03b4\u03bb = 22 500 and spectral o v erage between \u223c\u03bb15 150\u201316 950 \u00c5. We note that although there re results for stellar parameters and chemical abundances for IRS in the APOGEE DR17 database, the APOGEE automatic stellar arameters and abundances pipeline ASPCAP (Garc \u0301\u0131a P \u0301erez et al. 016 ) cannot properly model the IRS 7 spectrum, given the very high acroturbulent velocity of IRS 7, which corresponds to \u223c25 km s \u22121 nd is not accounted for in the APOGEE synthetic stellar libraries Zamora et al. 2015 ).\nA BU N DA N C E ANALYSI S A N D NCERTAI NTI ES\nbundances of C, N, O, and F were derived from molecular transiions and, as part of the spectrum synthesis calculations, molecular quilibria were computed for all significant C-, N-, O-, and Fontaining molecules, along with four stages of atomic ionization. he spectrum synthesis code, Turbospectrum (Alvarez & Plez 1998 ; lez 2012 ), includes dozens of molecules, with some of the more mportant ones for this analysis being H 2 , CO, OH, CN, CH, NO, H, C 2 , N 2 , O 2 , HF, H 2 O, CO 2 , as well as many less important pecies, such as SiO, SiC, SiN, TiO, HCN, or C 3 . The methodology or using specific molecular lines, such as those from CO, OH, or N, in oxygen-rich red giants (i.e. C/O < 1) is described in Smith t al. ( 2013 ) for the NIR CO, OH, and CN lines, but we recap ere; in cool red giants, such as IRS 7, CO locks up most of the arbon, due to its high dissociation energy, making CO the best onitor of the total carbon abundance. The CO line strengths are ildly sensitive to the oxygen abundance, while the OH lines are the est indicator of the oxygen abundance. Typically, one iteration of eriving the C-abundance from CO, with an initial value of the Obundance, and then using the OH lines, with the initially derived CO arbon abundance to determine an O-abundance and then re-derive he carbon abundance, results in consistent abundances of both C and . With defined abundances of C and O, the nitrogen abundance is hen determined from the CN lines. In Table 1 , we provide the list of molecular and atomic lines used in he abundance analyses of the elements; 12 C is derived from 12 C 16 O ines, 14 N from 12 C 14 N lines, 16 O from 16 OH lines, 19 F from H 19 F ines, as well as the minor isotopes 13 C from 13 C 16 O lines and 17 O rom 12 C 17 O lines. Atomic lines of Fe I were used to derive the etallicity of IRS 7. The excitation potentials and log gf-values of he transitions are also listed in Table 1 , along with the sources of he gf-values given in the last column for each set of lines.\nSynthetic spectra for IRS 7 were computed using the Turbospecrum code (Alvarez & Plez 1998 ; Plez 2012 ) and the BACCHUS rapper (Masseron, Merle & Hawkins 2016 ); a Gaussian broadening as adopted to match the macroturbulent velocity of \u223c25 km s \u22121 . he stellar parameters for IRS 7 were taken from the previous study y Cunha et al. ( 2007 ): T eff = 3650 K, log g = \u22120.50, microturbulent elocity \u03be = 3.2 km s \u22121 , noting that these are in general agreement ith earlier results by Carr et al. ( 2000 ; T eff = 3470K; log g = \u22120.60; = 3.3 km s \u22121 ) and by Davies et al. ( 2009 ; T eff = 3600 K; og g = 0.00; \u03be = 3.0 km s \u22121 ). A \u2018tailored\u2019 MARCS spherical model tmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008 ) was computed for the adopted\ns 2 g s s\nb a w d (\na c o\nf s o w w 4 (\ntellar parameters of IRS 7, for a mass of M = 25 M (Davies et al. 009 ), a metallicity [Fe/H] = + 0.1, and a chemical composition in eneral agreement with the abundances for C, N, O derived in this tudy (Table 2 ), while abundances of other elements were set to solar caled.\nMolecular dissociation energies and partition functions in Turospectrum are identical to those adopted in the MARCS model tmosphere code (Gustafsson et al. 2008 ). New data are evaluated, ith updates being made o v er the years. In the case of CN, the current issociation energy used is 7.724 \u00b1 0.017eV from Ruscic & Bross 2021 ); the method used is described in Ruscic et al. ( 2004 , 2005 ),\nnd is derived via a global optimized solution to a large thermohemical network in an error-weighted space of all determinations f thermochemical values (essentially the enthalpies of formation). The microturbulent velocity, \u03be , for IRS 7 was estimated initially ollowing the method used by Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) for other NSC tars, which relied on 12 C 16 O lines at \u03bb2 . 3 \u03bcm spanning a range f line strengths (equi v alent widths). The best value of \u03be was that hich yielded the same 12 C abundances from both the stronger and eaker CO lines and, for IRS 7, a microturbulent velocity \u03be = .5 km s \u22121 was obtained. As noted and discussed by Guer c \u00b8o et al. 2022 ), the strong molecular lines from CO or OH tend to require\nMNRAS 516, 2801\u20132811 (2022)\nM\na A ( \u03b4T eff ) 2 + ( \u03b4log g ) 2 + ( \u03b4[ Fe / H ]) 2 + ( \u03b4\u03be ) 2 ] 1/2 .

Given the range in microturbulent velocity values required cross a range of line strengths and wavelength regions, the adopted icroturbulent velocity in all calculations was \u03be = 3.2 \u00b1 1.0 km s \u22121 , hich we note, is the microturbulent velocity parameter derived in unha et al. ( 2007 ) and also similar to those values in previous tudies of IRS 7 (Carr et al. 2000 ; Davies et al. 2009 ). The main focus of this study is fluorine and the two HF lines nalyzed in IRS 7 are weak and derived 19 F abundances are quite nsensitive to the microturbulent velocity; the individual HF line bundances are in Table 1 . In Fig. 1 , observed and synthetic spectra or the HF(1-0) R9 and R11 lines are shown with filled black squares eing the observed IRS 7 spectrum and the continuous red and blue urves being synthetic spectra as labelled in the figure key. The top wo panels highlight the R9 line, while the bottom two panels show he R11 line. The top (first) panel plots a 55- \u00c5-wide region around he R9 line to illustrate the o v erall absorption-line spectrum of IRS , while the second panel provides a close-up 5 \u00c5 view of the R9 ine profile. Compared to the R11 line, that is heavily blended with 12 C 16 O line, the R9 line is relatively clean, being blended only ith the 12 C 17 O(2-0) R25 line, which falls \u223c1.2 \u00c5 to the blue and is uite weak in IRS 7. The analysis of the 12 C 17 O lines is discussed elow, but the 17 O abundance that is derived from the 12 C 17 O(2-0) 27, R28, R29, and R31 lines (with 16 O/ 17 O = 525) is used in the yntheses shown in the top two panels of Fig. 1 . A striking aspect f the R9 line in IRS 7 is its weakness relative to other red giant embers of the NSC having similar ef fecti ve temperatures (e.g. the\nop panel of fig. 1 in Guer c \u00b8o et al. 2022 ). The weakness of the R9 ine renders it insensitive to the microturbulent velocity and this point s illustrated in the second panel of Fig. 1 , where synthetic spectra aving \u03be = 3.2 km-s \u22121 (blue) and 5.0 km s \u22121 (red) are shown for wo 19 F abundances. The lower fluorine abundance of A(F) = 3.73 is a v oured o v er A(F) = 4.40 (solar; Maiorca et al. 2014 ), independent f \u03be , indicating that IRS 7 has a significantly lower abundance f 19 F than other NSC red giants [where A(F) \u223c4.8; Guer c \u00b8o et al. 022 ]. The spectrum around the R11 line is shown in the third panel of ig. 1 ( \u223c35 \u00c5) and again illustrates the weakness of the HF lines in RS 7. As noted abo v e, the R11 line is blended significantly with the 2 C 16 O(2-0) R82 line that falls 0.52 \u00c5 to the red. The 12 C 16 O near 23149 \u00c5 is the R83 line, which will be about the same strength as he R82 line; the fact that the blended HF R11 and CO R82 feature s only marginally stronger than the R83 line suggests that HF is ot the major contributor to the blend. This suspicion is born out\nNRAS 516, 2801\u20132811 (2022)\ny the fourth panel in Fig. 1 , where the line profile of the HF/CO lend is shown in detail. As with the R9 line, the lower abundance f A(F) = 3.62 provides the best fit and points to a depleted 19 F bundance in IRS 7 relative to other NSC red giants.\nOne final note about Fig. 1 concerns the third panel and the two trong absorption lines that are not fit by the synthesis: these are he low-excitation 12 C 16 O(2-0) R18 ( \u03c7 = 0.08 eV) and R19 ( \u03c7 0.09 eV) lines. The inability of spectrum synthesis using static -d model atmospheres to model these very strong, low-excitation olecular lines has been known for some time and is discussed in etail in Tsuji ( 1988 , 1991 ) and Smith & Lambert ( 1986 , 1990 ). hese studies found this effect for the first-o v ertone v-r CO lines tudied here, as well as the fundamental v-r CO lines near \u03bb4 . 6 \u03bcm, nd the fundamental v-r OH lines near \u03bb3 . 9 \u03bcm, and suggested hat the truncation of model atmospheres at low optical depths lays a role, as well as a single value (depth-independent) for the icroturbulent velocity. These studies did find, ho we ver, that the use f weaker and typically higher-excitation molecular lines leads to ecure abundances.\nThe abundances of the minor isotopes 13 C and 17 O, presented as atios of 12 C/ 13 C and 16 O/ 17 O, were set by weak lines of 13 C 16 O nd 12 C 17 O, respectively. The NIRSpec wavelength range for IRS 7 id not co v er an y detectable lines containing carbon-13, so the ratio f 12 C/ 13 C was determined from the APOGEE spectrum using the 3 C 16 O(3-0) bandhead near \u223c\u03bb16,120-16,125 \u00c5, which is one of the trongest 13 C features in the APOGEE spectral window in IRS 7. A 3 \u00c5 window co v ering the 13 C 16 O(3-0) bandhead was used, with the est fit being that which minimized the residuals between observed nd synthetic spectra. Comparisons of syntheses with the observed elativ e flux es are illustrated in the two panels of Fig. 2 , with fiv e ynthetic spectra having different carbon-13 abundances shown in oth the top and bottom panels, along with the IRS spectrum (filled lack circles): The synthetic spectra are plotted as solid curves of ifferent colours for each value of 12 C/ 13 C, or in the case of the ed synthesis, a 13 C abundance of zero. Each synthetic spectrum is alculated with the 12 C abundance derived for IRS 7 (A( 12 C) = 7.61) he top panel shows a wider region of the spectrum ( \u223c35 \u00c5) around he 13 C 16 O(3-0) bandhead, in order to illustrate the o v erall absorption pectrum in this region compared to the absorption from 13 C 16 O tself. Most of the absorption is from molecules consisting of a mix f CN, CO, and OH lines, along with a smaller number of atomic ines; the major absorption features straddling the 13 C 16 O bandhead indow are labelled. The bottom panel is a zoom co v ering only he region around the 13 C 16 O bandhead and illustrates the spectral ixels that are most sensitive to the 13 C abundance. The IRS 7 pixels o v ering this region were used to set the carbon isotopic ratio, with he mean value and standard deviation being 12 C/ 13 C = 5.3 \u00b1 0.8.\nFigure 1. Observed (black squares) and synthetic spectra (solid and dashed curves) of the star IRS 7 showing an extended region around the HF (1\u20130) R9 line (top panel); a zoom of the HF R9 line (second panel from top), and the region around the HF R11 line (third panel from top) and a zoom of the R11 line. The red syntheses were computed for \u03be = 5.00. We also show two best-fitting syntheses computed for \u03be = 3.20 km s \u22121 and A(F) = 3.73 (blue solid line) and for \u03be = 5.00 km s \u22121 and A(F) = 3.70 (red solid line). The small difference between these two syntheses illustrates the insignificant effect that the microtubulent velocity parameter has on the derived fluorine abundance. We also show additional syntheses for solar fluorine (A(F) = 4.40; Maiorca et al. 2014 ) using \u03be = 3.20 km s \u22121 (blue dashed line) and \u03be = 5.00 km s \u22121 (red dashed line); this illustrates clearly that solar fluorine abundance does not fit the observed spectrum of IRS 7.\nl R d a\nFigure 2. The top and bottom panels illustrate synthetic (continuous coloured lines) and IRS 7 (black filled circles) spectra centred on the 13 C 16 O(3-0) bandhead, with five synthetic spectra having different carbon-13 abundances (one with no 13 C and four with 12 C/ 13 C = 3, 4, 5, and 6). The top panel provides a 35 \u00c5-wide window of the spectral region around the 13 C 16 O bandhead in order to provide a view of the overall absorption in IRS 7 and how this compares to the absorption from 13 C 16 O lines. The glitch in the IRS 7 spectrum at \u03bb16130 \u00c5 is caused by poor telluric subtraction. The bottom panel is a close-up of the bandhead and illustrates the IRS 7 pixels that are most sensitive to the 12 C/ 13 C ratio; the isotopic ratio was set by this spectral interval from \u223c\u03bb6120-6123 \u00c5, resulting in < 12 C/ 13 C > = 5.3 \u00b1 0.8. The line positions of the individual 13 C 16 O lines are illustrated by the vertical lines at the top of the bottom panel. The red end of the 13 C 16 O bandhead is blended with a strong OH line plus an Fe I line (with an uncertain gf-value) further to the red.\ns a 2 t s w v i l g 1\na t e \u03c3 c v [ e\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/2801/6675813 by C N R S user on 24 M arch 2023\nOxygen-17 was detected in the NIRSpec spectra via 12 C 17 O(2-0) ines near \u03bb \u223c23 300 \u00c5, including the R25, R26, R27, R28, R29, 30, and R31 lines, which were used in Guer c \u00b8o et al.

Due to this significant blending, the derived 17 O abundance (presented as the 16 O/ 17 O ratio) in IRS 7 is uncertain, although the 17 O isotopic lines are detected clearly.\no s w 2 b i t s w 1\nm t l t i\n4\nA o w T r c t Q G s s m Y t l ( p\nc b T t t e a 2 t b 2\nt l c l o w T\n4\nT e t t o l p fi\na d t l s h t u o s\ni w R\nt t y h i p t p w I a i N fl i t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/2801/6675813 by C N R S user on 24 M arch 2023\nThe isotopic ratios are set by fits to various isotopic combinations f CO lines, thus their uncertainties are relatively insensitive to tellar atmospheric parameters, but are due mainly to the intrinsic eakness of the 13 C 16 O and 12 C 17 O lines themselves (e.g. Abia et al. 012 ). Uncertainties in Table 2 for the minor isotopes were derived ased on the scatter in the isotopic ratios derived around spectral ntervals dominated by each individual isotopic line (see Table 1 ); hese uncertainties are noted in Table 2 . In addition, tests of the ensitivities of the 12 C/ 13 C and 16 O/ 17 O ratios to microturbulence ere investigated and it was found that both sets of 13 C 16 O and 2 C 17 O lines were insensitive to changes in \u03be of \u00b11.0 km s \u22121 , eaning that these lines are weak (unsaturated). The sensitivities o the isotope ratios due to changes in \u03be are set by the 12 C 16 O ines, or to the derived 12 C abundances as a function of \u03be : changes o the isotopic ratios with \u03be = + 1.0 km s \u22121 are presented n Table 2 . DISCUSSION\ns previously mentioned, Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) analyzed a sample f massive young cool and evolved stellar members of the NSC, of hich IRS 7 is a member. Fig. 4 shows an HR diagram (log L versus eff ), highlighting the position of the target star IRS 7 (red square), elative to the other NSC targets studied previously (shown as solid ircles, with IRS 11 shown as an open circle). Fig. 4 also includes he star VR 5-7 (shown as a triangle), which is a member of the uintuplet cluster, at a distance of approximately 30 pc from the alactic Centre. Models from Ekstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ) are shown for tellar masses 25 M ; 20 M ; 15 M ; 12 M ; 9 M ; and 7 M ; the tellar models shown are solar metallicity rotating models. Similar odels, but for higher metallicity, are found in the recent work by usof et al. ( 2022 ). In Fig. 4, we also show two models corresponding o lower mass stars of 6 and 4 M from Lagarde et al. ( 2012 ). In the og L\u2013T eff regime shown, the 4- and 6-M models from Lagarde et al. 2012 ) span the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) hase of stellar evolution, in which the internal structure of the star\nNRAS 516, 2801\u20132811 (2022)\nonsists of an inert degenerate C-O core, surrounded by He- and Hurning shells. The so-called third dredge-up (TDU) occurs during P\u2013AGB evolution, resulting in surface enhancements of 12 C and he slow neutron-capture (s-process) elements. Stars more massive han \u223c8\u201310 M do not undergo TP\u2013AGB ev olution, b ut continue to volve through various core-burning phases, such as core He-burning nd core C-burning (e.g. see the re vie w by Karakas & Lattanzio 014 ). The boundary between the most massive TP-AGB stars and he lowest mass core-burning supergiants is not known precisely, ut likely lies in the range of \u223c8\u20139 M (Karakas & Lattanzio 014 ). Given this background, an examination of Fig. 4 would suggest hat IRS 7, IRS 19, VR 5-7, and IRS 22 are well abo v e the mass imit for TP-AGB stars, while BSD 72 and BSD 124 lie near the ore-burning supergiant/TP-AGB boundary, with IRS 11 sitting in a ocation that may be compatible with it being in the TP-AGB phase f evolution. Based on their fluorine abundances discussed below, e may surmise that only IRS 11 may show evidence of being in the P-AGB phase.\n.1 The baseline fluorine abundance in the NSC\nhe fluorine abundances of the Galactic Centre targets from Guerco t al. ( 2022 ) are plotted as a function of surface gravity (log g) in the op panel of Fig. 5 as black symbols. Surface gravity is plotted along he abscissa, as the relatively massive stars shown in Fig. 5 evolve off f the main sequence towards both lower effective temperatures and ower surface gravities, with stars evolving towards the right-hand anel in Fig. 4 . The mean fluorine abundance of the NSC stars in the gure is < A( 19 F) > = 4.75 \u00b1 0.20, or, < [F/Fe] > = + 0.28 \u00b1 0.18. Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) pointed out that their sample had fluorine bundances roughly consistent with the A(F) versus A(Fe) trend efined by Galactic thin disc stars having similar metallicities (see heir figure 4); the abundance results from disc stars from the iterature scattered both abo v e and below the line representing the econdary behaviour of A(F) versus A(Fe) in their figure 4. It is noted ere, ho we ver, that all their NSC targets, except for IRS 11 (shown as he open circle in Fig. 4 ), had similar fluorine abundances within the ncertainties: an average fluorine abundance and standard deviation f < A( 19 F) > = 4.85 \u00b1 0.06, being, on average, \u223c0.15 dex above the econdary behaviour.\nIRS 11 will be discussed further in the next section but concerning ts measured fluorine abundance, it should be kept in mind that this as the only star in Guerco et al. ( 2022 ) having only the HF(1-0) 11 line measured, which is severely blended with a CO line. It is reasonable to assume that the average fluorine abundance of he studied population of young NSC stars of A(F) = 4.75 represents he baseline fluorine abundance of the gas material that formed the oung and massive stars in the NSC, and that this baseline abundance as been reached via the chemical evolution in the disc, star formation n the centre and the gas falling into the Galactic Centre. One articular aspect of the targets in the Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) study hat is rele v ant here is that, although massive, those NSC targets reviously studied co v er a range in mass between \u223c5 and 15 M , hich is significantly lower than the estimated mass of \u223c25 M for RS 7, the most extreme star in the Galactic Centre. The fluorine bundance obtained for IRS 7 (A(F) = 3.69; shown as the red square n the top panel of Fig. 4 ) is o v er 1 de x lower than the baseline SC fluorine abundance value, being in stark contrast with the other uorine abundance results for the cluster, and suggesting that its nitial fluorine content has been destroyed, as will be discussed in he following section.\nFigure 4. Luminosity [as Log(L/ L )] versus T eff for the Galactic Centre stars discussed here. The filled and open circles are all members of the NSC, as is IRS 7, while VR 5-7 (filled triangle) is a member of the Quintuplet Cluster. The 7-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 20- and 25-M stellar models are rotating models from Ekstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ), while the 4- and 6-M stellar models are from Lagarde et al. ( 2012 ).

Also in both panels of Fig. 5 re results from the stellar models of Ekstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ); the redictions for fluorine are presented for the first time here and ere computed in the framework of the stellar models from Ekstr \u0308om t al. ( 2012 ). The models shown co v er a mass range of \u223c10 \u221225 and include models with 12, 15, 20, and 25 M , with the solid ines representing non-rotating standard models, while the dashed ines represent rotating stellar models having initial rotations on the AMS of between 235 and 306 km s \u22121 . These values correspond to\nime-av eraged surface v elocities during the main-sequence phase of etween 178 and 217 km s \u22121 (see table 2 in Ekstr \u0308om et al. 2012 ). he stellar models are plotted with different colours and are labelled. hese models assumed solar ab undances (ha ving initial values of X 0.720, Y = 0.266, Z = 0.014, which account for diffusion), with he heavy-element mixture from Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval ( 2005 ), xcept for neon, which is from Cunha, Hubeny & Lanz ( 2006 ). The nitial 19 F abundance for the models in Fig. 5 was shifted to the mean alue of A( 19 F) = 4.75 (Guer c \u00b8o et al. 2022 ) as defined by the NSC tars, as discussed abo v e. This is an assumed approximation, since he o v erall Fe abundances are only mildly enhanced, while keeping n mind that the initial stellar hydrogen content was originally higher, s the surface H abundance also becomes mildly depleted in these volved red supergiants (see discussion in Davies et al. 2009 ), esulting in an iron-to-hydrogen ratio which is higher.\nThe position of IRS 7 in the A( 12 C) versus log g diagram (bottom anel of Fig. 5 ) also shows clear depletion relative to the carbon\nbundances of the other NSC members. The lower-mass NSC embers (with masses 5 and 15 M ) display mild to moderate epletions in A( 12 C) of 0.2\u20130.6 dex, along with no significant easurable changes in 19 F (compared to the depletions of \u223c\u22120.9 ex in 12 C and -1.0 dex in 19 F, respectively in IRS 7). The very large epletions in both the surface 12 C and 19 F abundances exhibited by RS 7 are predicted by the stellar models to take place at masses f approximately 20 M or larger (Fig. 5 ), which fits the various stimates for IRS 7 that cluster around 20 and 25 M . The two stars ith masses falling just below 20 M are IRS 19 and VR 5-7, with stimated masses of 15 and 14 M , respectively (Guer c \u00b8o et al. 2022 ). oth IRS 19 and VR 5-7 have 19 F abundances that fall close to the 5-M track (Fig. 5 , top panel), in accordance with their estimated asses. IRS 19 also falls near the 15-M model track for the 12 C bundance as a function of surface gravity, while VR 5-7 has a 12 C bundance and surface gravity that falls closer to the 20 M , although he estimated masses are uncertain at levels close to this.\nAdditional comparisons between the evolved stars in the NSC nd stellar models are shown in Fig. 6 , where various pairs of bundances are plotted in order to further illuminate the mass and volutionary state of IRS 7. Pairing mixing-sensitive elements or sotopes together can, in certain cases, increase the comparison power f observationally derived abundances with predicted abundances rom stellar models. The Galactic Centre stars discussed here are all oung (ages \u223c10 7 \u201310 8 a) and from either the NSC or the Quintuplet luster (VR 5-7), which is only 30 pc from the Galactic Centre.

The solid lines are non-rotating models and dashed lines are rotating ones. The solid black circles represent stars from the NSC from Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ; open circle is IRS 11); these have estimated masses between \u223c5 and 15 M and define the baseline abundances for the NSC. IRS 7 (shown as the red square) is more massive ( M \u223c 25 M ); its 19 F and 12 C abundances are clearly depleted. VR5-7 from the Quintuplet cluster (roughly 30 parsecs away from the Galactic Centre) is also shown (black filled triangle). The massive rotating models that reverse evolution towards lower surface gravities back to higher values of log g are driven by high mass-loss rates, moving the star towards higher values of T eff , smaller radii, and larger surface gravities.\nI a d l t t r H\nn f F T b t t a e\nw i\nt t s 1\nf\nc d o f i t o g T a T v t d h a\nh 1\ne G 1\na t s 1\ns l e s\np a d a L a o i ( f w o a r 7 E m T d f f t a\nh\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/516/2/2801/6675813 by C N R S user on 24 M arch 2023\nRS 7, for a given level of 12 C depletion, the rotating models predict larger 19 F depletion when compared to the non-rotating models, ue to rotational mixing distributing 19 F-poor matter throughout a arger mass volume of the stellar interior. We note that in the case of he 32-M model, there is an increase of both fluorine and carbon at he end (Wolf\u2013Rayet phase), which comes from the fact that layers eflect the nucleosynthesis associated with the beginning of the core e-burning phase. Previous approximate estimates from the spectroscopic studies oted in the introduction range from 17 to 25 M and, taken at ace value, a comparison of the IRS 7 19 F and 12 C abundances in ig. 6 falls in-between the rotating 25- and 32-M model tracks. hese comparisons remain superficial, as the stellar models have not een tailored to the pristine chemical abundances of the NSC, nor he observed rotational velocities of massive main-sequence stars of he NSC. None the less, the top left-hand panel of Fig. 6 presents n insightful window into the interplay between models and the volutionary state of IRS 7.\nThe minor isotope of carbon, 13 C, was measured in IRS 7, ith 12 C/ 13 C = 5.3 \u00b1 0.8, although a plot of A( 19 F) versus 12 C/ 13 C s not included in Fig. 6 , as 12 C/ 13 C does not discriminate be-\nNRAS 516, 2801\u20132811 (2022)\nween the various stellar models that best match IRS 7. By the ime that depleted 19 F has been mixed to the surface of the red upergiant, all models predict a near CN-equilibrium value of 2 C/ 13 C \u223c4, which is within the errors of what is derived here or IRS 7.\nFig. 6 (bottom left-hand panel) adds the 14 N abundance as a omparison to the 19 F abundance in IRS 7. Since Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) id not derive nitrogen abundances in the other Galactic Centre stars, nly IRS 7 is plotted in this panel; again the initial 14 N abundance or IRS 7 is taken to be scaled solar from [Fe/H] = + 0.08, or an nitial abundance of A( 14 N) = 7.91. All of the stellar models predict hat no significant 19 F depletion will occur up to 14 N o v erabundances f \u223c+ 0.6 dex; ho we ver, by the point when [ 14 N/Fe] \u223c+ 1.0 dex and reater, the 19 F abundance declines precipitously as 14 N increases. he massive rotating stellar models predict somewhat larger 14 N bundances at a given 19 F depleted abundances by + 0.2\u20130.3 dex. he derived 14 N abundance in IRS 7 falls slightly below the alues predicted by both the standard and rotating models. Given hat nitrogen abundances are determined from CN, which are also ependent on the derived carbon abundances, the 14 N abundance as a slightly larger uncertainty due to uncertainties in the carbon bundances.\nMoving on to the oxygen abundance of IRS 7, Fig. 6 (top rightand and bottom panels) presents the 19 F abundances as functions of 6 O and the 16 O/ 17 O isotopic ratios, respectively. Again, Guer c \u00b8o t al. ( 2022 ) did not measure oxygen abundances in the other alactic Centre stars, so only IRS 7 is plotted here, and the initial 6 O abundance is shifted up by 0.08 dex, so the initial oxygen-16 bundances in the NSC is taken to be A( 16 O) = 8.77. IRS 7 continues o occupy a position in the A( 19 F)-A( 16 O) plane that points to the ignature of full CNO-cycle H-burning, with significant depletion of 6 O accompanying the depleted 19 F abundance. The discriminatory eparation between the non-rotating versus rotating models is not as arge for 16 O as it is for 12 C, so the derived 16 O abundance and its rror, merely verifies the fact that IRS 7 represents a massive red upergiant.\nMeasurements of the 16 O/ 17 O isotopic ratios can help in further robing the conditions for deep mixing in massive stars, in general, nd in IRS 7, in particular; keeping in mind, ho we ver, that the estruction of 17 O depends on the cross-section of the 17 O(p, \u03b1) 14 N nd 17 O(p, \u03b3 ) 18 F reactions, which are uncertain (e.g. see fig. 3 in ebzelter et al. 2015 ).

In this study, we obtained 16 O/ 17 O = 550 for IRS 7 Table 2 ), while Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) deri ved lo wer v alues of 16 O/ 17 O or the less massive Galactic Centre stars they analyzed. Comparing ith other galactic stars, similar and higher values for this ratio were btained, for example, for the red supergiants \u03b1 Ori ( 16 O/ 17 O = 525) nd \u03b1 Sco ( 16 O/ 17 O = 850) in Harris & Lambert ( 1984 ). The bottom ight-hand panel of fig. 4 presents A( 19 F) versus 16 O/ 17 O for IRS and the other Galactic Centre stars, along with results from the kstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ) stellar models. The initial 16 O/ 17 O ratio for the odels is the solar value of 2750, which falls off of the plot scale. he higher mass stellar models of 20, 25, and 32 M , all of which eplete 19 F, straddle the observed values of 19 F and 16 O/ 17 O derived or IRS 7. In terms of its fluorine abundance and 16 O/ 17 O ratio, IRS 7 alls between the rotating 20 M and 25 M models, or at the end of he standard 20-M track (which becomes a core collapse supernova s a red supergiant progenitor).\nModels for lower mass stars are also plotted in the lower rightand panel of Fig. 6 , corresponding to 2, 5, 12, and 15 M , in order\nFigure 6.

The values for the 16 O/ 17 O ratios for he lower mass Galactic Centre red giants agree roughly with the rends predicted by the models; the oxygen isotope ratios for the ntire sample of red giants presented here will be the subject of a uture study. As in the previously discussed comparisons of elemental bundances, the position of IRS 7 stands out clearly from the other ower mass Galactic Centre members with its lower 19 F abundances oupled with a higher 16 O/ 17 O ratio.\nBefore leaving the discussion of comparisons between the oberved stellar 19 F abundances and stellar models, we return to the pparently low fluorine abundance in IRS 11 (by \u223c0.30.4 dex) when ompared to other NSC red giants with masses less than IRS 7. he peculiar position of IRS 11 is illustrated in the top panel of ig. 5 (A( 19 F) versus log g ) and the top left-hand panel of Fig. 6 A( 19 F) versus A( 12 C): IRS 11 displays a low fluorine abundance iven its luminosity and a higher carbon-12 abundance compared to he other NSC luminous cool giants. In Section 4.1 , the low fluorine bundance was suggested to result from uncertainties in the derived 9 F abundance, as it was derived from only one HF line. Below, we oint to a possible alternative explanation in which IRS 11 has, in act, undergone fluorine depletion\nThe three lower mass NSC stars from Guer c \u00b8o et al. ( 2022 ) are RS 11, BSD 72, and BSD 124, with estimated masses of 4.5 , 5.0,\nnd 6.5 M , respectiv ely. Ov er this mass range and T eff range of 600\u20133900 K, core-burning stars can be difficult to distinguish from hell-b urning TP-AGB stars. Helium-b urning thermal pulses drive owerful convection during the TP-AGB phase of stellar evolution, esulting in the dredge-up of both triple- \u03b1 12 C and heavy elements roduced by slow neutron captures, the s-process: this dredge-up hase is labelled the third dredge-up. An additional aspect of the hird dredge-up in the most massive TP-AGB stars ( \u22654 M ) is uorine destruction via the reaction 19 F( \u03b1,p) 22 Ne (e.g. Palmerini t al. 2019 ). Models by Fenner et al. ( 2004 ) that were used and iscussed in Smith et al. ( 2005 ) predict 19 F depletion in massive AGB tars undergoing hot bottom burning (HBB); models by Legarde t al. ( 2012 ) also find 19 F destruction in TP-AGB models, but with maller depletions than those of Fenner et al. ( 2004 ). Given the ifficulty in determining the exact evolutionary state of red giants ear log L \u223c3.8 \u22124.2 L and T eff \u223c 3600 \u22123900 K, core-burning ith M \u223c8 \u22129 M or TP-AGB with M \u223c4 \u22127 M , it remains possible hat IRS 11 is undergoing the third dredge-up or HBB with the esultant destruction of 19 F in the helium-burning regions of thermal ulses.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nhe recent work of Guer c \u00b8o et al.

The alactic Centre stars analyzed in that study were cool ( T eff ranging etween 3600 and 3880 K), luminous (log L/ L = 3.7\u20134.9), with asses ranging between \u223c5 and 15 M . The most luminous star n the NSC, IRS 7 (log L/ L = 5.47), is the focus of the present tudy.\nThe extremely low 12 C and 16 O abundances found by Carr et al. 2000 ) and Davies et al. ( 2009 ) for IRS 7, along with the very large 4 N enhancement derived by Carr et al. ( 2000 ), are confirmed here sing spherical MARCS model atmospheres and spherical radiative ransfer with the code Turbospectrum (Plez 2012 ). We find [ 12 C/Fe] \u20130.97, [ 16 O/Fe] = \u20130.55, and [ 14 N/Fe] = + 1.25, with these values ointing to deep conv ectiv e mixing in IRS 7. New results presented ere add the abundance of 19 F, as well as the isotopic ratios of 12 C/ 13 C nd 16 O/ 17 O, to the ab undance distrib ution of IRS 7 and these deepixing sensitive abundances were compared to predictions from odels of stellar evolution. The fluorine abundance obtained for IRS 7 point to a high level f depletion (relative to the baseline F abundance of the NSC) that i v als that observed for carbon, both showing a depletion of \u223c0.8\u20131 ex in IRS 7. The deep convective mixing of CNO-cycle material, n which 19 F has been destroyed, mixed to the surface of IRS 7 is esponsible for the low fluorine abundance. Such a process had not een observed directly in a massive red supergiant before, so the ddition of the 19 F abundance to those of the CNO isotopes can e used to further monitor mixing and refine models of massive tars.\nThe abundances of mixing sensitive isotopes and elements in IRS are compared to models of massive stars in order to constrain he evolutionary state of this red supergiant star. Model predictions or the evolution of the fluorine abundances with luminosity are resented for the first time and these were computed in the framework f the stellar models by Ekstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ). The evolution of uorine and carbon in the models, along with the results for the C nd F abundances for the NSC and IRS 7 (presented in Figs 5 and 6 ) how that models predict o v erall the same behaviour as the real stars n the NSC. The depleted fluorine abundance in IRS7 illustrates, for he first time, the potential of using the 19 F abundance as a mixing robe in luminous red giants Facilities: Keck Observatory, Apache Point Observatory.
