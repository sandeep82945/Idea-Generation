1. **Investigate the use of different score-based diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) for noise-robust speaker verification (SV).** The paper uses a particular type of DPM, but there are many other types of DPMs that could potentially be used for this task. Exploring different DPMs could lead to further improvements in performance.


2. **Explore the use of different speech enhancement techniques in combination with DPMs for noise-robust SV.** The paper uses a simple speech enhancement technique, but there are many other more sophisticated speech enhancement techniques that could potentially be used in combination with DPMs to further improve performance.


3. **Investigate the use of different speaker embedding extraction techniques in combination with DPMs for noise-robust SV.** The paper uses a simple speaker embedding extraction technique, but there are many other more sophisticated speaker embedding extraction techniques that could potentially be used in combination with DPMs to further improve performance.


4. **Explore the use of DPMs for noise-robust SV in different applications, such as voice control, speaker diarization, and language identification.** The paper focuses on the use of DPMs for noise-robust SV in the context of speaker recognition, but DPMs could potentially be used for noise-robust SV in other applications as well.


5. **Investigate the use of DPMs for noise-robust SV in different languages and accents.** The paper focuses on the use of DPMs for noise-robust SV in English, but DPMs could potentially be used for noise-robust SV in other languages and accents as well.
