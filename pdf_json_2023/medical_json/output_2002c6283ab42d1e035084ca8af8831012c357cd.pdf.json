This includes bacteria, viruses, archaea, protozoa and fungi that are all believed to play essential roles in various bodily functions such as nutrient synthesis, enteric nerve function, angiogenesis, and much more [1]. Gut dysbiosis is a pathological state that occurs when there is an imbalance or shift in the microbiota composition and metabolic activities that leads to disruptions in homeostasis [2]. Dysbiosis has been associated with many chronic in ammatory conditions. Recent research has focused on establishing links between certain patterns of gut dysbiosis and speci c diseases, with the ultimate goal for the GM to serve as a tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions.\nPeyronie's disease (PD) is a brotic disorder of the tunica albuginea that was rst described in 1743 by a French physician named Francois de la Peyronie [3]. PD is a men\u2019s sexual health disease that is characterized by pain, brosis that leads to eventual plaque formation, penile deformity, and sexual function decline. The prevalence of PD is unclear and is likely underreported with most recent data suggesting a prevalence of up to 9% [4]. The pathophysiology of PD is another topic of ongoing discussion. The leading theory currently is that, in most but not all cases, microtraumas during sexual activity disrupt the healing process in the tunica albuginea which leads to local in ammation and collagen deposition [5]. This ongoing cascade of in ammation can then progress to the formation of brous plaques, which then cause the complications of PD, including curvature, shortening, and\nPage 4/10\nnarrowing of the penis. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of PD is crucial for a better understanding of the disorder and the development of effective therapeutic interventions.\nGut dysbiosis is an imbalance in the composition of the microbiota and this can cause several issues in the human body due to buildup of toxic compounds and depletion of bene cial products [6]. This imbalance of microbial byproducts leads to a disrupted intestinal barrier which allows for further tissue damage throughout the body which then triggers immune and in ammatory responses [6]. Through this mechanism it is thought that GM dysbiosis contributes to the development of brosis in several organs. Numerous studies have illustrated this association in brotic diseases such as pulmonary brosis [7\u201310].\nTo-date there have been no studies that have attempted to elucidate a connection between the GM and PD. However, there have been numerous studies that have attempted to establish an association with GM and other brotic diseases. We hypothesize that there is a potential relationship between the GM and PD. The goal of our study is to better characterize any potential relationships and to discuss possible mechanisms in which they would be related.\nMaterials And Methods\nStudy Population All subjects were consented under Institutional Review Board (IRB) 2017\u20133746. Participants were enrolled in either a PD group or age-matched control group (age matching was within +/- 10 years) to compare their GM compositions. Inclusion criteria were male sex assigned at birth, 30 years or older, body mass index (BMI) of 35 or lower, and sexually active within the past 4 weeks with a partner. Exclusion criteria were known current or past history of malignancy, currently taking testosterone or hormone replacement therapy, recent use of steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy within the past 4 weeks, recent antibiotic use within the past 4 weeks, previous history of scrotal/testicular/penile surgery, hypertension, and presence of pro-in ammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, in ammatory bowel disease, chronic prostatitis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease etc. Sample Collection Stool samples were collected using the commercial Gut Intelligence kit (Viome Life Sciences, Inc) by each study participant at their own residences. The kit included a sample collection tube with an integrated scoop, a proprietary RNA preservative, and sterile glass beads. A pea-sized stool sample was collected and placed inside the tube and vigorously shaken to homogenize the sample, exposing it to the RNA preservative. The sample was then shipped at ambient temperature using a common courier to a lab for analysis. All samples remained at ambient temperature for no longer than 28 days, to meet the requirements established by the clinical validation [11]. Metatranscriptomic Analysis of Stool Samples\nPage 5/10\n16S rRNA is a small subunit ribosomal RNA molecule that is present in prokaryotes and is essential for protein synthesis. It is widely used to identify and classify bacteria species by comparing the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. This process is called 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene is highly conserved in bacteria, and its sequence can be used to distinguish different bacterial species, but generally not strains. For example, the 16S rRNA gene can be used to compare the genome of a pathogenic bacterium to the genome of a non-pathogenic strain to identify any differences in the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene. In metatranscriptome analysis all RNA is analyzed, not just the 16S rRNA. Metatranscriptome analysis involves sequencing the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are present in a microbial community to determine which genes are being expressed and which microorganisms are present. Importantly, metatranscriptomic analyses allow for the quaniti cation of all microorganisms, not just prokaryotes, and can provide valuable insights into microbial gene expression pro les.\nWe therefore used the unbiased metatranscriptomic (RNA sequencing) analysis following the clinically validated methods that were previously described [11]. Brie y, stool samples were lysed by bead beating in the RNA preservation buffer (RPB). The following steps were automatically performed using 96- channel liquid handlers. RNA was extracted using silica beads and a series of washes, followed by elution in molecular biology grade water. DNA was degraded using RNase-free DNase. Prokaryotic rRNAs were removed using a subtractive hybridization method, where biotinylated DNA probes with sequences complementary to microbial rRNAs were added to total RNA, the mixture was heated and cooled, and the probe-rRNA complexes were removed using magnetic streptavidin beads. The remaining RNAs were converted to directional sequencing libraries with unique dual-barcoded adapters and ultrapure reagents. Libraries were pooled and quality controlled with dsDNA Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scienti c) and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical) methods. Library pools were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq instruments using 300 cycle kits. Bioinformatic analysis Viome\u2019s bioinformatics methods include quality control, taxonomic classi cation (at strain, species, and genus ranks), and microbial quantitative gene expression analysis. The quality control includes persample and per-batch metrics, such as the level of barcode hopping, batch contamination, positive and negative process controls, DNase e cacy, and number of reads obtained per sample. Following the quality control, the paired-end reads are aligned to a catalog containing rRNA and 53,660 genomes spanning archaea, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Reads that map to rRNA are discarded. Strainlevel relative activities were computed from mapped reads via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [12]. Relative activities for the biological functions were computed by mapping paired-end reads to a catalog of 52,324,420 genes, quantifying gene-level relative activity with the EM algorithm and then aggregating gene-level activity by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Ortholog (KO) annotation [13]. The identi ed and quanti ed active microbial species and KOs for each sample were then used for downstream analysis. Data analysis\nPage 6/10\nMultiplicative replacement method [14] is employed to deal with zero entries and the data is transformed with centered log-ratio (CLR) [15]. CLR transformation is commonly done to reduce false discoveries due to the compositional nature of sequencing data. Statistical analyses were performed in Python. All samples that were included in the study passed quality acceptance criteria and received at least 5,000 reads aligning to microbial species, at least 200 KOs detected, and at least 50 species detected. FDR Differential expression of microbes and microbial functions were compared between groups. We used the one-way ANOVA test to evaluate the differential expression and CHi-2 test to evaluate the differential prevalence. False discovery rate (Benjamini/Hochberg) was used for multiple hypothesis testing.\nResults The average age of the PD group was 57.83 \u00b1 6.27 years and the average age of the control group was 58.50 \u00b1 6.53 years (p = 0.809). The average BMI of the PD group was 23.60 \u00b1 1.95 compared to the control group\u2019s BMI of 27.11 \u00b1 3.64 (p = 0.010).\nNo signi cant differences were found between the PD group and control group for microbial taxonomy or for microbially expressed functions. That is, there were no signi cant differences observed between groups in KEGG richness (p = 0.541), KEGG diversity (p = 0. 0.134), species richness (p = 0.933), or species diversity (p = 0.597) (Fig.\u00a01).\nDiscussion Our results suggest that there are no signi cant differences between KEGG richness, KEGG diversity, species richness, or species diversity between our PD and control group. We did a thorough review of the medical literature and to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no research attempting to illustrate an association between the GM and PD. However, there is ample research discussing the potential relationship between the GM and the pathophysiology of other brotic organ diseases [6].\nThe pathophysiology of PD is hypothesized to be associated with repeated microtraumas, either due to vigorous sexual intercourse or masturbation, that triggers an in ammatory response in the tunica albuginea of the penis [5]. This in ammatory process leads to activation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and deposition of collagen in an irregular and uncontrolled fashion. The brotic cascade is thought to be similar in all brotic organ disease processes. It is an irregular wound healing process that involves complex interplay between the ECM, broblasts, and immune cells of the innate and adaptive systems, as described by Pakshir et al [16]. They reported that when tissue is damaged, molecules called damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released from disrupted cells and the ECM. These DAMPs bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells. TLRs then trigger the release of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) which begins the transcription of proin ammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1). Furthermore, macrophages and dendritic cells induce broblast transformation into myo broblasts. Myo broblasts release transforming growth factor\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) which leads to the production of an excess of collagen and ultimately the formation of\nPage 7/10\nplaques. Animal models of PD have con rmed that an overexpression of TGF-\u03b21 stimulates collagen deposition by myo broblasts which ultimately leads to the development of penile plaques [17]. This provides evidence that the pathogenesis of PD likely involves microtraumas, leading to the activation of a brotic cascade similar to that of other brotic organ disease processes.\nGM dysbiosis has been studied at an increasingly exponential rate over the past decade. Several studies have illustrated its implication in the development and progression of brotic processes in various organs [6]. One such brotic disease is pulmonary brosis (PF) which is characterized by chronic in ammation and excessive deposition of ECM in the lungs [18]. This leads to thickening and stiffening of the lung parenchyma leading to symptoms of shortness of breath and cough and in severe cases, results in organ failure. Wang et al performed an animal model study in which two antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis animal model groups were studied [7]. One of these groups was then treated with a fecal microbiota transplant, in order to restore a healthy GM, and a signi cant decrease in in ammatory response was noted in both the intestines and in pulmonary brotic changes when compared with the antibiotic onlytreated mice. Phycocyanin is a protein that is involved in algal photosynthesis and can be fermented by intestinal microbiota. Li et al used a radiation-induced pulmonary brosis animal model in which both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of phycocyanin reduced in ammation damage and collagen ber deposition and signi cantly lowered the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the lung, GI tract, and blood [8]. Xie et al used a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary brosis and demonstrated that phycocyanin inhibited the synthesis of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 while also reducing known proin ammatory bacteria [9]. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced by commensal anaerobic gut bacteria through saccharolytic fermentation of complex resistant carbohydrates [19]. They serve as important fuels for intestinal epithelial cells and regulate their functions through different mechanisms to modulate their proliferation and differentiation [19]. They also have an impact on gut motility and strengthen the gut barrier functions as well as host metabolism. Lee et al performed an in vitro analysis of the effect of SCFA on TGF-\u03b21-induced differentiation of human fetal lung broblast cell lines [10]. They revealed that butyrate, a SCFA produced from GM metabolism, inhibited the expression of TGF-\u03b21 which prevented the differentiation of alveolar myo broblasts, thus elucidating that butyrate production by the GM can halt the development and the progression of pulmonary brosis.\nThe main limitation of our study is the small sample size, due to recruitment issues during the COVID pandemic, which may have not been su ciently powered to show differences. Rather than view this as a negative study involving the GM and PD, we hope that its methodological framework will be used by others in the scienti c community and encourage the development of similar studies with much larger group sizes. The main strength of this study is the manner in which we analyzed all samples. Most studies that involve GM research solely use 16S rRNA gene sequencing, in our study all samples were analyzed using metatranscriptome analysis which allows us to study the taxonomy of all microbes as well as their KOs. This more thorough and detailed analysis increases chances of nding true associations with the GM and we encourage others to use similar analyses methods.\nPage 8/10\nConclusions In this rst of its kind study there were no signi cant differences observed in KEGG richness, KEGG diversity, species richness, and species diversity between our PD and control group. In the future, studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better characterize any associations and to help uncover potential targets in the GM for early treatment or prevention of PD.\nDeclarations Funding Information:\nNo source of funding was provided for this study.
