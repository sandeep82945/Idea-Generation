    "abstractText": "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the major proteolytic system in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. The role of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) as critical agents for regulating cancer cell death has been established. Aziridine derivatives are well-known alkylating agents employed against cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, aziridine derivatives showing inhibitory activity towards proteasome have never been described before. Herein we report a new class of selective and nonPIs bearing an aziridine ring as a core structure. In vitro cell-based assays (two leukemia cell lines) also displayed anti-proliferative activity for some compounds. In silico studies indicated non-covalent binding mode and drug-likeness for these derivatives. Taken together, these results are promising for developing more potent PIs.",

            "text": "The dynamic conditions of intracellular proteins are preserved by a perfect equilibrium between protein synthesis and degradation. Thus, the quality and quantity of proteins within a cell must be strictly regulated according to cellular needs or physiological demands. In this regard, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) constitutes the major proteolytic system in the cytosol and nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. It is crucial for maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis in physiological conditions and during adaptive stress responses [1\u20135]. UPP catalyzes the degradation of most short-lived and long-lived proteins, which comprehend the number of proteins in mammalian cells [6,7]. The degradation of proteins by the UPP is a cyclic pathway involving an initial step of ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation to the protein substrate, resulting in the degradation of the polyubiquitinated protein via the 26S proteasome complex [5,8\u201310]. The eukaryotic 26S proteasome is a large (~2.5 MDa) multifunctional particle, composed of a barrel-shaped 20S core particle (CP), which contains the protease subunits, capped by two 19S regulatory particles (RPs) that control the proteolytic function of the protease core. The 20S proteasome is the proteolytically active key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is constituted by four heptameric rings stacked in a \u03b17\u03b27\u03b27\u03b17 arrangement. The two inner \u03b2-rings\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12363. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232012363 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12363 2 of 12\ncontain the proteolytic active sites (\u03b21\u20137). In particular, the three proteolytic subunits are \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b25, which have distinct substrate specificities [11\u201313]. \u03b25 subunits display \u201cchymotrypsin-like\u201d (ChT-L) activity and are mainly involved in protein degradation. Therefore, they emerged as the principal targets for developing efficacious anticancer agents [14,15]. The other two proteolytic subunits of the proteasome, \u03b22 and \u03b21, must be considered as co-targets of anticancer agents to achieve an efficient protein breakdown. \u03b22 subunits possess \u201ctrypsin-like\u201d (T-L) activity, whereas \u03b21 subunits are referred to as \u201cpost-glutamate peptide hydrolase\u201d (PGPH) or \u201ccaspase-like\u201d (C-L) [13,16,17]. All three catalytic subunits contain an N-terminal residue, Thr1, of which the hydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile and interacts with the peptides of the proteins to be degraded [16,18,19]. Immediately after the disclosure of the UPP and its relevance to protein and cellular homeostasis, preclinical studies on the presumed role of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) as critical agents for regulating cancer cell death have commenced [20,21]. The proteasome was identified and validated as a pivotal target in protein quality control and turnover, cell differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, and apoptosis [5,8\u201310,22]. To date, three PIs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), Velcade\u00ae (bortezomib, 2) [23,24], Ninlaro\u00ae (ixazomib, 3) [23], and Kyprolis\u00ae (carfilzomib, 6) [23] (Figure 1), as new drugs to treat multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL). It is known that the co-inhibition of the \u03b25 subunits with either the \u03b21 or the \u03b22 subunits provides the maximal anti-tumor effect and represents the ideal profile for a drug candidate [25\u201327]. On the contrary, the inhibition of all proteasome subunits may develop cytotoxicity [28]. The majority of 20S PIs currently reported in literature [2,29\u201331], are peptide-based compounds, featured with a C-terminal electrophilic warhead that forms covalent adducts with the hydroxyl group of Thr1 in the active sites. A reversible mechanism of action is observed for aldehydes (1) [3,32\u201334], boronates (2\u20133) [23,24,35\u201337], \u03b1-keto-amides (4) [37,38], and \u03b1-keto-aldehydes (5) [39]. \u03b1\u2019,\u03b2\u2019-Epoxyketones (6) [3,34,40], \u03b2-lactones (7) [41,42], vinyl sulfones (8) [43\u201345], vinyl esters (9) [46], and syrabactins (10) [47] act as irreversible inhibitors (Figure 1a) [2]. For the latter, the covalent mode of action and the elevated reactivity of the compounds may often lead to off-target interactions. Lately, diverse new non-covalent PIs were identified (Figure 1b) [17,48\u201352]. Even if less widely investigated with respect to covalent inhibitors, they provide a valid and milder alternative mechanism for proteasome inhibition. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12\nFigure 1. Representative examples of the major classes of covalent (a) and non-covalent (b) PIs from\nnatural and synthetic sources.\n2. Results and Discussion\nDespite the remarkable achievements in obtaining PIs, further research is still needed\ndue to the lack of selectivity and resistance development of the inhibitors and drugs re-\nported so far. Recently, we discovered a new class of aziridine featuring compounds as\npromising PIs. Albeit aziridine derivatives are well-known alkylating agents employed\nagainst cancer [53\u201355], to the best of our knowledge, aziridine derivatives showing inhib-\nitory activity towards proteasome have never been reported. Thus, inspired by in silico\npredictions (see hereinafter), the in vitro biological activity of selected chloro(trifluorome-\nthyl)aziridines (CTMAs) (Scheme 1), synthesized by Ielo et al. in 2019 [56], was evaluated\ntoward human 20S proteasome. CTMAs were synthesized via homologation chemistry\nenriched with a brand-new interesting biological applicability in the field of drug discov-\nery, as already evidenced by our research group activity [57\u201360]. The investigation started\nby performing docking studies using proteasome \u03b25 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n(PDB ID: 4HRD) [61] in order to assess possible binding modes of CTMAs to the catalytic\npocket of the target. The peptide Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (26, Figure 2a) was used as\na reference proteasome substrate. Docking results predicted promising activities as PIs\n(Table 1).

Sci. 2022, 23, 12363 5 of 12\nPreliminary assays (i.e., screening at 20 \u00b5M) carried out on several cysteine and serine proteases, as well as on proteasome \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunits, did not show any inhibitory activity (inhibition range 0\u20135%), indicating a marked selectivity of compounds 15\u201325 towards proteasome \u03b25 subunits. Afterwards, we moved to cell-based assays to assess a correlation between the proteasome ChT-L inhibition and the anti-proliferative activity of CTMAs by using the resazurin method on two different leukemia cells lines (Table 2) [68\u201370]. Derivatives 21 and 22 displayed the best anti-proliferative profile also in this assay with an IC50 value of 25.45 and 32.82 \u00b5M on CCRF-CEM (drug-sensitive acute lymphocytic leukemia cells) and of 24.08 and 67.72 \u00b5M on CEM/ADR500 (multidrug-resistant leukemia sub-cell line) [71\u201373], respectively. Noteworthy, both 21 and 22 didn\u2019t show cytotoxicity against healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Table 2) (Figure S1).\nIn silico studies were performed using AutoDock Vina implemented in the YASARA software. The docking studies were performed on all the protonation states of the compounds at pH 7.4, previously calculated using the Marvin software. Following in silico studies, it was seen that the CTMAs tested can bind the receptor non-covalently and nevertheless possess a good inhibitory capacity. Considering CTMAs SAR (Structure-Activity Relationships), the phenyl ring substitution seems favorable in para-position since a decrease or even loss of activity was observed in derivatives substituted in ortho-position. Linear conjugated \u03c0 systems, such as anthracene (21) and diazo-diphenyl (22), confer the best activity. The 2D structures for the two most active CTMAs, 21 and 22, are shown in Figure 2b,c, respectively. CMTAs 21 and 22 establish somewhat similar interactions within the receptor site. From the 2D poses of the two compounds, it can be seen that both ligands establish hydrophobic interactions with the residues Ala27, Glu132, Ser28, and Ala143. The presence of a greater hydrophobic portion due to the anthracene moiety (21) allows the compound 21 to establish \u03c0-alkyl interactions with the Ala22 residue (Figure 2b). CTMA 22, due to the presence of the two central nitrogen atoms, establishes a hydrogen bond (2.57 \u00c5) with a water molecule inside the receptor site (Figure 2c). In addition, we performed in silico ADMET studies on CTMAs 21 and 22 to further strengthen the results of the docking studies. The ability to reach targets in bioactive form was evaluated using the SwissADME web platform (http://swissadme.ch, accessed on 15 July 2022). Notably, the technologies implemented in this platform can predict the false positive results commonly observed in biochemical small molecule assays with a fair degree of certainty. The two compounds simultaneously satisfy Lipinski\u2019s [74] and Veber\u2019s [75] rule for drug similarity. Both have a Bioavailability Score of 0.55.

Fluorescence was measured using an Infinite M2000 Pro-plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) with an excitation wavelength of 544 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Each experiment was done at least three times with six replicates each. The viability was analyzed in comparison with the untreated cells. Fifty percent inhibition (IC50) values are the drug concentrations required to inhibit 50% of cell proliferation and were calculated from a calibration curve by linear regression using Microsoft Excel."
