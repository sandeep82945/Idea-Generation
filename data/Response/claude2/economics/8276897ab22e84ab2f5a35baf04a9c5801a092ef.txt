 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the given paper:

1. Conduct a more in-depth analysis on the reasons behind the regional differences in the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization in China. The paper briefly touches on some potential institutional causes, but more empirical research can be done to verify and expand on this. 

2. Examine the social and economic impacts of the imbalance between population urbanization and land urbanization, especially in the more severely imbalanced western regions. This could shed light on policy interventions needed.

3. Research the sustainability implications of the rapid land urbanization outpacing population urbanization in most provinces. Issues like urban sprawl, inefficient land use, environmental impacts could be investigated.

4. Study effective policy solutions, like reforms to the hukou system, land ownership laws, fiscal policies etc. that could help improve the coordination between population and land urbanization. Pilot studies in select regions could provide insights. 

5. Conduct cross-country comparisons of urbanization patterns and analyze how other countries have handled the population-land balance. This can provide valuable lessons for China's urbanization path.
