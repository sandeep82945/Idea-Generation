1. **Investigate the impact of CAIS adoption on the financial performance of construction companies in different countries.** This study could compare the economic performance of construction companies that have adopted CAIS with those that have not, in a variety of countries. This would help to determine whether the positive effects of CAIS adoption found in this study are consistent across different contexts.


2. **Examine the role of government policies and regulations in promoting CAIS adoption in the construction industry.** This study could investigate how government policies and regulations can be used to encourage construction companies to adopt CAIS. This could include policies that provide financial incentives for CAIS adoption, or regulations that require construction companies to use CAIS for certain types of projects.


3. **Explore the relationship between CAIS adoption and innovation in the construction industry.** This study could investigate how CAIS adoption can lead to innovation in the construction industry. This could include studies that examine how CAIS can be used to develop new construction methods or materials, or how it can be used to improve the efficiency of construction processes.


4. **Investigate the impact of CAIS adoption on the environmental performance of construction companies.** This study could examine how CAIS adoption can help construction companies to reduce their environmental impact. This could include studies that examine how CAIS can be used to reduce energy consumption or waste production, or how it can be used to improve the sustainability of construction projects.


5. **Develop a model for predicting the economic performance of construction companies that adopt CAIS.** This study could develop a model that can be used to predict the economic performance of construction companies that adopt CAIS. This model could be used by construction companies to make informed decisions about whether or not to adopt CAIS.
