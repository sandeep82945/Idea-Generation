1. **Investigate the impact of different isolation strategies on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.** This could involve varying the isolation rate, the duration of isolation, or the criteria for determining who should be isolated.


2. **Explore the effects of different levels of immunity on the spread of COVID-19.** This could involve considering different rates of vaccination, different levels of natural immunity, or different durations of immunity.


3. **Develop a more detailed model of the COVID-19 epidemic that includes additional compartments, such as asymptomatic individuals, hospitalized individuals, and recovered individuals.** This would allow for a more accurate representation of the dynamics of the epidemic.


4. **Investigate the use of different fractional-order derivatives to model the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.** This could involve using different types of kernels, such as the Mittag-Leffler kernel or the Caputo kernel, or using different orders of the fractional derivative.


5. **Apply the piecewise derivative approach to other infectious disease models.** This could help to identify other diseases for which the piecewise derivative approach can provide insights into the dynamics of the epidemic.
