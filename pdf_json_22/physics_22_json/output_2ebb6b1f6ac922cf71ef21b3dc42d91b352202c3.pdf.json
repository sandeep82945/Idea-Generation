Excited states of \u03c0-stacked dimers of tetra-thiophene oligomers (T4), infinite isolated polythiophene (PT) chains, and P3[Alkyl]T crystals are modeled using configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations. Excited states in cofacial T4 dimers are mostly localized Frenkel states except for two low energy charge transfer (CT) exciton states, which become the ionization potential and electron affinity levels of T4 molecules at large dimer separation. The lowest excited states in infinite, isolated PT chains and P3[Alkyl]T crystals are intra-chain excitons where the electron and hole are localized on the same chain. The next lowest excited states are interchain, CT excitons in which the electron and hole reside on neighboring chains. The former capture almost all optical oscillator strength and the latter may be a route to efficient formation of polaronic charge carriers in P3[Alkyl]T systems. Changes in optical absorption energies of T4 dimers as a function of molecular separation are explained using CIS calculations with four frontier orbitals in the active space. Shifts in optical absorption energy observed on going from isolated chains to P3[Alkyl]T lamellar structures are already present in single-particle transition energies induced by direct \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions at short range. The electroabsorption spectrum of T4 dimers is calculated as a function of dimer separation and states that are responsible for parallel and perpendicular components of the spectrum are identified. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nCharge separation in conjugated polymers is a key step in the formation of free carriers in organic photovoltaic materials.1 A sequence of light absorption by a chromophore, followed by energy transfer to a charge transfer (CT) state, and subsequent dissociation of the electron and hole as charged polarons seems a likely scenario for carrier formation in many systems. Frequently, this requires a donor\u2013acceptor heterojunction to provide the driving force for formation of the charge transfer state. The case of regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3[Alkyl]T) is one where charged polarons form with high efficiency (up to 30%) following photoexcitation without the need for a heterojunction, although it has been suggested that poorly stacked regions in otherwise regular P3[Alkyl]T\nare responsible for charge separation. Indeed, the fate of optical excitations in P3[Alkyl]T is strongly affected by its microcrystalline structure.2 Charged polaron formation following light absorption in P3[Alkyl]T3\u20138 occurs when the polymer exists in a lamellar structure, rather than single chains in solution.6 Efficiencies of 11%,8 20%,4 and 30%6 have been reported. The spectrum of polaron states in polythiophene (PT) has been investigated by experiment5,9 and theory.10,11\nThe primary motivation of this work is to understand CT states in photosensitizers in organic photovoltaic materials such as P3[Alkyl]T. First of all, we consider a minimal model for CT states in a symmetric dimer using a 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian. This is extended to configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations of optical absorption spectra of a cofacial tetra-thiophene (T4) dimer\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 074901 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0098575 157, 074901-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:19:02\nas a function of dimer separation and P3[Alkyl]T systems in the crystalline state, using the same basis set and Hamiltonian. CIS calculations on the P3[Alkyl]T systems show that a low energy CT state exists in which the electron and hole are located on neighboring chains. Finally, the electroabsorption (EA) spectrum of the T4 dimer is calculated as a function of dimer separation. Most EA calculations in the literature12,13 use a model Hamiltonian approach. Here, we apply a first-principles CIS approach to the T4 dimer. The sum over states (SOS) formalism used (vide infra) is complex and it is prudent to apply the method to the molecular case and extrapolate results to the crystalline case, in the first application. A feature previously observed in EA spectra of P3[Alkyl]T by \u00d6sterbacka et al.3 and attributed to a CT state is reproduced in our calculations.\nCrystalline morphologies of P3[Alkyl]T polymers have been reviewed in Refs. 14 and 15. Here, we refer to a number of P3[Alkyl]T polymers according to the alkyl side chain group, X, as X = H (hydrogen), Et (ethyl), Bu (butyl), Hex (hexyl), Oct (octyl), and Dec (decyl). X-ray structures of P3[Hex]T have been reported by a number of groups. A key feature of thiophenes with long side chains is that they form lamellar structures with short interchain distances (less than 4 \u00c5), which gives them their properties of strong tendency to form polaron charge carriers, high hole mobilities, etc. The structure from a combined nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and x-ray diffraction study by Dudenko and co-workers16 was used for crystalline P3[X]T calculations in this work. The short distance between \u03c0-stacked chains in P3[Alkyl]T led Brown and co-workers5 to assert that charge carriers in these systems \u201cexhibit quasi-twodimensional characteristics.\u201d The crystal structure of polythiophene (PT), which lacks side chains, has been found to be a herringbone structure17 with two PT chains per unit cell.\nMany-body GW and Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations on periodic polythiophenes have been reported for isolated infinite chains (ICs)18\u201321 and the herringbone structure of PT.22 Here, we report configuration interaction singles [CIS, exactly equivalent to time-dependent Hartree\u2013Fock theory in the Tamm\u2013Dancoff approximation (TDA)] calculations on isolated chain PT and on the \u03c0-stacked P3[X]T structure with X = H, Et, and Bu. The authors are not aware of previous GW/BSE calculations, which include the electron\u2013hole attraction, on the \u03c0-stacked structure in the crystal phase. It is interesting, therefore, that we find charge transfer (CT) excitons in which the electron and hole are localized on neighboring chains. Quantum classical/INDO studies of CT states in PT aggregates have been used to argue that CT states can be stabilized by a dielectric background.23 Wang and co-workers11 found exciton states with various degrees of charge transfer in poly-phenylene vinylene (PPV) cofacial oligomers.\nMulti-configuration calculations (including the CIS method used here) naturally incorporate states with CT character in the spectrum of excited states, even when the system under study is a symmetric, cofacial dimer. The simplest possible Hamiltonian that can describe these states contains even and odd combinations of the HOMO and LUMO of each molecule in the dimer to yield a 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian. Two of the states that result from this Hamiltonian are Frenkel (FR) excitons, which are mainly localized on one molecule or other in the dimer. The other two are CT excitons in which the electron and hole mainly reside on distinct molecules. In each case, however, symmetry dictates that all excited states belong\nto an irreducible representation of the system point group. Hence, both FR and CT excited states consist of linear combinations of the local configurations just described. In the limit of large separation, these states evolve into degenerate, FR or CT excitons. The latter are also known as IP-EA states since they consist of electron transfer from the HOMO of one molecule to the LUMO of the other and their energies are differences in the electron affinity and ionization potential of the system, \u0394 = IP \u2212 EA. CT states differ from other states in that they are stabilized by intermolecular Coulombic interactions and their energies have an approximate \u0394 \u2212 14.4/r energy dependence, where the latter term is the interaction energy of two point charges of magnitude, e, in eV.\nOptical properties and device physics of polythiophenes have been reviewed in Refs. 24 and 25. Fundamentals of linear and nonlinear optical absorption and excited state energies have been reported.7,12,26 Optical absorption and emission spectra of P3[Alkyl]T aggregates have been modeled using a generalized Holstein Hamiltonian, which includes electron\u2013phonon interactions.27 H and J aggregates display distinct behavior, depending on the sign and magnitude of the dipolar coupling between polymer chains.28 Yamagata and co-workers29 performed calculations on octathiophene (T8) dimers and showed that the sign of the dipolar coupling and, therefore, the type of aggregate predicted depended on lateral shifts of the T8 dimers\u2014cofacial dimers favored an H aggregate while a shift along the PT chain direction of 2.5 \u00c5 resulted in the strongest J coupling. The variation in coupling was attributed to wave function overlap rather than Coulombic coupling through space.\nThe origin of the difference in optical absorption threshold in P3[Alkyl]T in solution vs thin films has been investigated in detail by experiment6,9 and simulation using a Holstein\u2013Hubbard model applied to molecular aggregates with random disorder.27,30 Cook and co-workers6 studied the evolution of optically excited states of P3[Hex]T in solution and in thin films by transient absorption spectroscopy. The onset of optical absorption in chlorobenzene solution (around 2.3 eV) is higher than in thin films (around 2.0 eV). This may be attributed, for example, to a noncoplanar chain structure, or it may be due to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions in the condensed phase. In solution, P3[Hex]T has a long-lived S1 state that has a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.33 and otherwise decays via a triplet state. In thin films, however, a fast (\u223c600 ps) fluorescent decay with low quantum yield (0.02) and a slow, bimolecular process (\u223c300 ns) attributed to polaron recombination were found.6\nElectroabsorption (EA) spectroscopy is commonly used to probe CT states in organic matter.13 CT states involve transfer of an excited electron over larger distances than is normal in an optical transition and the charge transition density is small since the occupied and virtual states in the transition are well separated in space. On the other hand, CT states may have a large permanent dipole moment, which can interact with an external electric field, resulting in a Stark shift of an otherwise weak transition that can be observed in EA spectroscopy. The EA spectra for the 11Bu absorption in P3[Alkyl]T from several groups5,12,26 are found to be in good agreement.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows: A 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian model for CT and FR states in a symmetric dimer is outlined, molecular and periodic CIS methods used in this work and computational details are described, and the sum over states\nJ.

Results for the variation in singlet and triplet state energies in the T4 dimer as a function of intermolecular separation for the 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian and full CIS calculations of excited state energies and linear optical absorption spectra are given. CIS calculations of the wave functions and linear absorption spectra of infinite polymers are compared to T4 oligomer calculations. This is followed by results of SOS electroabsorption calculations for the T4 dimer as a function of separation. A summary and conclusions are presented in the Sec. IV."

In the dimer, these generally order energetically with the in-phase combination slightly lower in energy, with a small energetic splitting at large separation. These orbitals are even or odd about a mirror plane between the molecules in the dimer. Occupied orbitals localized on either molecule in the dimer are denoted A and B and virtual orbitals are denoted C and D (Fig. 1). Dimer H \u2212 1 and H \u2212 0 orbitals are (A + B)/ \u221a 2 and (A \u2212 B)/ \u221a 2 and dimer L + 0 and L + 1 orbitals are (C +D)/ \u221a\n2 and (C \u2212D)/ \u221a 2. For simplicity, it is assumed that intermolecular distances are large enough that overlaps \u27e8A\u2223B\u27e9 and \u27e8C\u2223D\u27e9 are negligible and we consider a minimal Hamiltonian for triplet states of the dimer in which a CIS Hamiltonian matrix element is given by\nHiajb = \u03b5ai\u03b4ij\u03b4ab \u2212 (ij\u2223ab).

(5)\nThese states are in- and out-of-phase combinations in which the excited electron and hole reside on either molecule, i.e., high energy \u201cIP-EA\u201d or CT1 and CT2 charge transfer states. The (AA\u2223DD) + (BB\u2223CC) terms in this eigenvalue are Coulombic electron\u2013hole attraction terms for electron and hole on either molecular site. Intramolecular (AA\u2223CC) and (BB\u2223DD) integrals in the lower eigenvalue are independent of molecular separation, to a first approximation, whereas intermolecular (AA\u2223DD) and (BB\u2223CC) integrals in the upper eigenvalue vary with separation approximately as 14.4/r eV \u00c5\u22121, where r is the intermolecular separation in \u00c5. For separations less than 5 \u00c5, overlap of \u03c0 systems leads to a splitting of the FR and\nIP-EA states with different phases owing to splitting of the singleparticle gap energies at the self-consistent field (SCF) level. This is shown in Sec. III where a 4 \u00d7 4 CIS Hamiltonian is diagonalized as a function of T4 dimer separation. The H\u2212 1 and H\u2212 0 orbitals of a T4 dimer belong to the bu and bg irreducible representations of the C2h point group (Fig. 1). The L+ 0 and L+ 1 orbitals belong to the ag and au representations. The wave functions in Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) are, therefore, excited states of Bg symmetry (FR1 = [\u2223AC\u27e9 \u2212 \u2223BD\u27e9]/ \u221a 2 and CT2 = [\u2223BC\u27e9 \u2212 \u2223AD\u27e9]/ \u221a\n2) or Bu symmetry (FR2 = [\u2223AC\u27e9 + \u2223BD\u27e9]/\u221a 2 and CT1 = [\u2223BC\u27e9 + \u2223AD\u27e9]/ \u221a 2). The lowest state of 1Ag symmetry contains configurations that are products of bu and bu (\u2223(H \u2212 1) (L + 2)\u27e9) and au and au (\u2223(H \u2212 2)(L + 1)\u27e9) orbitals and the lowest state of 1Au symmetry contains configurations that are products of bg and bu (\u2223(H \u2212 1)(L + 2)\u27e9) and bu and bg (\u2223(H \u2212 1)(L + 3)\u27e9) orbitals. These are only present when the active space is expanded beyond the limited space in this simple model."

Side chains were edited to yield P3[X]T structures (X = H, Et, Bu), which were optimized using the Crystal code39 with a B3LYP density functional.40,41 Lattice parameters were kept fixed at P3[Hex]T experimental values16 (16.4 \u00d7 7.6 \u00d7 7.7 \u00c53) with a monoclinic angle of 87\u25cb. A 2 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 4 k-point mesh was used for these calculations. The P3[H]T calculation was performed using all 18 valence states and 40 virtual states. P3[X]T calculations with X = Et and Bu were performed with 20 valence states and 19 virtual states per k-point.\nFractional coordinates for an isolated chain in the P2/c space group (No. 10) were also optimized with lattice parameters fixed at 7.6 \u00d7 10.0 \u00d7 20.0 \u00c53 and a monoclinic angle of 90.0\u25cb.

In order to evaluate the model numerically, the CIS Hamiltonian for a \u03c0-stacked T4 dimer was diagonalized in the active space described\nin Sec. II A for singlets and triplets and several intermolecular separations, ranging from 3.2 to 10.0 \u00c5. Energies of the 11Bg , 11Bu, 21Bg , and 21Bu singlet states and 13Bg , 13Bu, 23Bg , and 23Bu triplet states are shown in Fig. 2, along with variations in single-particle energy differences. Triplet state energies and wave function coefficients are given in Tables S8\u2013S11 in the supplementary material in the MO product basis and in the FR [\u2223AC\u27e9 \u00b1 \u2223BD\u27e9] \u221a 2 and CT [\u2223BC\u27e9 \u00b1 \u2223AD\u27e9] \u221a\n2 bases [Eqs.

At 10.0 \u00c5, the states correspond to pure FR states on each molecule, combined with \u00b1 phases and a very small splitting owing to their weak interaction at that range. Below 5 \u00c5, these wave functions begin to deviate from pure FR character (Fig. 2, lower panel). The lowest FR state begins to mix in a significant amount of CT character. The in-phase (13Bg) combination becomes dominated by the H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 0 transition because the single-particle gap for this transition, \u03b5ai, is reduced in the SCF calculation at short range (Fig. 2, upper panel).

On the other hand, single-particle gaps for the H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 0 and H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 1 transitions remain relatively constant at short intermolecular separations and the wave function for the FR2 (13Bu) state, 0.748\u2223(H \u2212 1)(L + 0)\u27e9 + 0.664\u2223(H \u2212 0) (L + 1)\u27e9 remains much closer to that for the FR2 state at large separation. Splitting of the two FR states at short intermolecular distances can be seen in Fig. 2, lower panel.\nThere is a concomitant splitting of the CT states and upward deviation of the H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 1 transition energy at short intermolecular separations. CT state 2 acquires a significant amount of FR character (23Bg , Table S11) and deviates upward for intermolecular separations below 4 \u00c5. At large separation, the CT states evolve into the two IP-EA states whose energies are almost degenerate at 10.0 \u00c5. Singlet FR states in Fig. 2 have a similar behavior to the corresponding triplet states but are shifted upward by half of the (AA\u2223CC) intramolecular two-electron integral, which is \u223c4.44 eV and independent of molecular separation. This integral does not enter the energy of the CT states; hence, they are degenerate, except at short range where splitting of single-particle gaps causes them to deviate to higher or lower energy."

            "text": "CIS calculations on singlet states of \u03c0-stacked T4 dimers with C2h symmetry (Fig. 1) were performed using the same basis sets as those reported in Sec. III A but with the much larger active space\ndescribed in Sec. II C. Excitation energies of the first four states of each irreducible representation vs separation are shown in Fig. 3. The lowest excited states are four FR states, one of each symmetry type, whose transitions with the largest weights are H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 0 and H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 1 (1Bg), H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 1 and H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 0 (1Bu), H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 2 and H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 3 (1Au), and H \u2212 1\u2192 L + 2 and H \u2212 0\u2192 L + 3 (1Ag) transitions. Lowering of the 1Bg and 1Au states for separations below 4 \u00c5 arises from changes in single-particle excitation energies (Fig. 3) similar to those in the 4 \u00d7 4 model Hamiltonian. The 11Bg , 11Bu, 21Bu, and 21Bg states are the FR and CT states found in the 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian, now calculated in a much larger Hamiltonian.\nThe first CT states are the 21Bu and 21Bg states indicated by black and red diamonds in Fig. 3. They show a similar splitting to the two CT states in the 4 \u00d7 4 model Hamiltonian, and for separations between 3.6 and 5.2 \u00c5, they are the states immediately above the four lowest FR states. The next CT states are a pair of 1Ag and 1Au symmetry. The state of 1Ag symmetry deviating downward at short range and around 6 eV is the first CT state with 1Ag symmetry.\nAt large separation, the 21Bg and 21Bu CT states separate into \u2223AD\u27e9 \u00b1 \u2223BC\u27e9 ionic configurations. They are nearly degenerate beyond a separation of 4.5 \u00c5. Consequently, when an electrostatic field is applied perpendicular to the molecular planes and the interaction energy of the CT dipole moment exceeds the small CT state splitting, the wave functions break symmetry and the excited states separate into two states where the dipole moment of the excited state lies parallel or antiparallel to the applied field. In this case, the wave functions are \u2223AD\u27e9 and \u2223BC\u27e9. Figure 4 shows the magnitudes of the permanent dipole moments of the CT states when the CIS calculation is performed in the presence of a field of \u223c107 V m\u22121, applied perpendicular to the molecular planes. T4 dimer CT excited states begin to acquire a dipole moment for a separation of 4.4 \u00c5 and this reaches the full e times dimer separation by 5.2 \u00c5, after which the dipole moment grows linearly with separation. The dipolar interaction energy, \u2212p \u22c5 E, has a magnitude of 2.6 meV for full transfer of charge e between molecules when they are separated by 5 \u00c5. This is the order of magnitude of the splitting energy\nJ. Chem.

            "text": "In this section, we present CIS calculations of the linear optical absorption spectra for a single T4 molecule and for infinite P3[X]T polymer crystals with X = H, Et, and Bu. Most many-body calculations on infinite PT systems have been performed on isolated, infinite polymers with hydrogen18,19 or small alkyl chain20,21 substituents. van der Horst and co-workers22 performed a study of crystalline PT,17 which has a herringbone structure. On the other hand, experimental work is commonly done using P3[X]T polymers with unsaturated alkyl chains including X = Oct26 and Hex.7,16 P3[Hex]T has a 3D crystalline \u03c0-stacked, P21/c structure. In one structural study (that used in this work), the lattice constant in P3[Hex]T16 perpendicular to PT chains was 7.7 \u00c5, so that the distance between chains is 3.85 \u00c5 and there is a small tilt angle and axial shift between chains. In another epitaxial study of the structure of P3[Hex]T, the perpendicular interchain separation was found to be 3.4 \u00c5 and the tilt angle was 26\u25cb.47\nThe T4 monomer and dimer and PT crystal structures belonging to P2/m and P21/c space groups each have C2h point symmetry. The 1Bu and 1Au irreducible representations are the optically active representations for C2h point symmetry. (x, y) transform as 1Bu and z transforms as 1Au. Transition dipole moments from the 11Ag ground state lie parallel (perpendicular) to thiophene molecular planes in 1Bu (1Au) transitions. Transitions between excited states are considered later in Sec. III D. In this case, dipole allowed transitions between 1Bg and 1Bu or 1Ag and 1Au states are polarized perpendicular to the molecular plane while transitions between 1Bg and 1Au or 1Ag and 1Bu are polarized in the molecular plane.\nThe CIS linear optical absorption spectrum for a T4 molecule is shown in Fig. 5 for the applied optical field in the molecular (x, y) plane. Single T4 1Bu absorptions at 3.62, 5.70, and 6.34 eV compare to T4 dimer 11Bu, 31Bu, and 61Bu excitations at 3.72, 5.73, and\n6.55 eV, respectively. The 21Bu CT state at 5.38 eV in the T4 dimer is absent from the single molecule and has a very small transition strength. The HF IP-EA gap at large separation is 7.79 eV and represents the asymptotic limit of the 1Bu and 1Bg IP-EA states. There are no other 1Bu states with large transition moments up to that limit.\nS1 CIS excitation energies of a series of PT oligomers as a function of the reciprocal of the chain length are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material and extrapolated to infinite chain length. The CIS excitation energy of an isolated, infinite PT chain is 2.78 eV, which agrees well with the extrapolated limit for the series of PT oligomers used.\nExcitonic hole wave functions for the first excited states of PT infinite polymers with IC and P3[X]T crystal structures, with the electron localized at the center of the figure are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6. Envelopes of both states are very similar, indicating that interchain interaction has limited effect on S1 exciton localization in the intra-chain exciton. The hole wave function extends over fewer than 10 thiophene units. Imaginary parts of the dielectric functions of PT IC, P3[H]T, P3[Et]T, and P3[Bu]T are shown\nJ. Chem.

It is immediately evident that the PT IC has a higher excitation energy than the P3[X]T systems. The latter have strong interchain interactions as they are only 3.85 \u00c5 apart.\nExcitation energies from CIS calculations in this work and GW/BSE calculations in the literature are compared in Table II. In the PT IC, the CIS S1 state occurs at 2.78 eV, when all valence states and 40 virtual states per k-point are included in the calculation (convergence with respect to number of virtual states is given in Table I). S1 excitation energies in P3[H]T, P3[Et]T, and P3[Bu]T are significantly lower, at 2.11, 2.16, and 2.16 eV, respectively. The HF bandgap in the isolated chain is 6.70 eV and this is reduced to 5.51 and 5.64 eV in P3[H]T and P3[Et]T, respectively, which accounts for the significant reduction in excitation energy. The top panel of Fig. 3 shows that the HF gap in T4 dimers decreases by over 0.5 eV when the molecules are less than 4 \u00c5 apart. van der Horst et al. found that local-density approximation (LDA) HOMO and LUMO values shifted by a combined 0.80 eV when two T1 monomers were \u03c0-stacked with a separation of 4 \u00c5.22\nThese S1 energies compare well with experimental values of 2.0 eV in highly ordered P3[Oct]T films26 and 1.8 eV for P3[H]T in a thin film.7 CIS excitation energies are expected to overestimate experimental excitation energies. On the other hand, GW/BSE calculations in the TDA, which used a density functional starting point, tend to underestimate experimental values. Calculations by van der Horst and co-workers found S1 excitation energies of 1.73 eV for an isolated chain and 1.49 eV22 in a calculation on the crystalline PT structure17 with a herringbone structure. Interaction between PT chains in that structure is weaker: The shift of 0.80 eV for LDA eigenvalues in \u03c0-stacked T monomers reduced to 0.21 eV when the monomers were rearranged in the herringbone structure. Hence, a smaller reduction in excitation energy on going from the isolated chain to the crystal is expected in that case (0.24 eV vs 0.67 eV in the CIS calculations reported here). More recent GW/BSE calculations20,21 also find S1 excitation energies below experimental values.\nTABLE II.

Very similar excitation energies are found in P3[Et]T and P3[Bu]T (Table II and Fig. 6). In the lowest excitation state, the electron and hole are essentially confined to the same chain (left panel, Fig. 7). In the higher states, the electron and hole are more delocalized over pairs of neighboring chains (right panel, Fig. 7). The S2 and S3 excitons are dark and the S1 and S4 excitons are bright. S1 and S2 and S3 and S4 states were found to be split by 0.01 and less than 0.01 eV, respectively, in a GW/BSE calculation,22 compared to splittings of 0.08 in the herringbone structure and 0.03 in this work. A dark state of 1Ag symmetry in P3[Oct]T has been postulated at 2.5 eV on the basis of two-photon absorption26 and at 2.67 eV on the basis of EA.12"

Leiss and co-workers12 showed that inclusion of vibronic coupling in models of EA spectra of polymers, including polythiophene, changes a simple first derivative line shape into the 11Bu line shape in Fig. 9. The authors of Ref. 3 also noted a shoulder, which they attributed to the mAg excited state (where m is a small, unknown integer), and a second derivative line shape around 2.75 eV, which they attributed to a CT state (Fig. 9).\nThe EA spectrum of P3[Dec]T polymer films was measured12 and shown to be dominated by a Stark shift of the 11Bu state at 2.01 eV, as well as features fitted to excited states of 1Ag symmetry at 2.67 and 3.27 eV. The sign of the EA signal depends on the competition of the one- and two-photon terms in which the intermediate transition returns the electron to the ground state [Eq. (6)] or to a different intermediate state [Eq. (7)]. Since the ground state is connected only to 1Bu states in dipole allowed transitions, the intermediate state is either a state of 1Ag symmetry (in xxxx polarization) or a state of 1Bg symmetry (in xxzz polarization). Recall that 1Ag to 1Bu transitions have the transition moment in the molecular (x, y) plane and 1Ag to 1Bg transitions have the transition moment parallel to the z direction. Based on the sign of the EA signal arising from transitions to the 11Bu state, Liess and co-workers surmised12 that there must be one or more transitions to states of 1Ag symmetry at relatively low energy. In order to have a positive EA signal, the \u2223\u03bc01\u2223 2\u2223\u03bc1x\u2223 2 two-photon term must exceed the \u2223\u03bc01\u2223 4 one-photon term, where in Liess\u2019 notation, 0 is the ground state, 1 the 11Bu state, and x an intermediate excited state of 1Ag symmetry.\nDipole transition matrix elements between states of 1Ag symmetry (including the 11Ag ground state) and the 11Bu state are given in the top section of Table III. The dipole transition matrix element between the 11Ag ground state and 11Bu excited state is \u223c10 D in the isolated molecule (infinite dimer separation) and reduces to around 9.5 D at small intermolecular separation. For dimer separations of 3.6 \u00c5 and above, the 31Ag and 41Ag states, which lie around 6.2 and 6.3 eV in CIS calculations, are the main intermediate state contributors to the \u03c7(3)xxxx EA signal (Table III). These correspond to matrix elements \u03bclm in Eq. (7), where l is the 11Bu state and m is an excited state of 1Ag symmetry (or \u03bc1x in Liess\u2019 notation). The 1\n1Bu to 31Ag transition dipole moment has a value of 11.21 D at a separation of 4.0 \u00c5, allowing the two-photon term to exceed the one-photon term and yield a positive EA signal.\n\u03c7(3)(\u2212\u03c9; \u03c9, 0, 0) susceptibilities for T4 dimers with the static electric field applied in the z direction and the optical responses measured in the x direction, Im\u03c7(3)xxzz , are shown in the right column of Fig. 8 as a function of T4 dimer separation, along with the responses of a single T4 molecule. For the xxzz susceptibility, only the two-photon term in Eq. (7) contributes. In the one-photon term [Eq. (6)], the 11Ag ground state must couple directly to all virtual states that make a contribution. This limits one-photon term virtual states to 1Bu symmetry and coupling in the x direction only. In the two-photon term, an electric field in the z direction couples 1Bu and 1Bg states, hence one of the virtual states in this case is of 1Bg symmetry.\nDipole transition matrix elements between states of 1Bg symmetry and the 11Bu state are given in the lower section of Table III.\nJ.

The impact of the 21Bu and 21Bg CT states is to strengthen the first derivative, xxzz response at 3.7 eV when the dimer separation is small and to introduce a new second derivative response at the CT state excitation energy (Fig. 8, right panel). The latter ranges between 5 and 6 eV, depending on dimer separation and becomes weaker with increasing dimer separation. The response from an isolated molecule in the molecular plane with the static electric field applied perpendicular to the molecular plane (xxzz response) is about 2000 times weaker than the xxxx response, with all fields in the molecular plane, since there is no 1Bg CT state in that case.\nIn the infinite \u03c0-stacked polymer, the CT states occur at lower energy. CT energies presented in Table II are predicted to occur around 3.6 eV. A feature at 2.75 eV in the EA spectrum of P3[Hex]T has been attributed to a CT exciton [Fig. 4(A), Ref. 3, redrawn here as Fig. 9]. The shape of the signal is similar to the second derivative feature of the CT derived peak in Fig. 8. CIS is expected to overestimate energies of states; therefore, it seems likely that the experimental feature does originate in a CT state where the electron and hole reside on neighboring chains."

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "We have reported CIS calculations on bulk P3[Alkyl]T and T4 monomer and cofacial dimer systems. A simplest possible model for CT states in a symmetric dimer was presented in Sec. II A. CIS calculations of excited state energies in cofacial T4 dimers as a function of dimer separation found the first six excited states at separations around 4 \u00c5 to consist of four low energy Frenkel states and two CT states. (The separation of P3[Alkyl]T chains in the bulk crystal is just under 4 \u00c5.) CIS calculations on bulk P3[Et]T and P3[H]T crystals show intra-chain Frenkel excitons as the lowest energy bright excitons having the majority of the optical oscillator strength. The next excited states are interchain CT excitons in which the excited electron and hole are mainly on neighboring chains. These states are analogous to CT states found in T4 dimers. The two lowest\nsinglet excited states in CIS calculations on P3[H]T are bright and dark intra-chain excitons at 2.11 and 2.19 eV. The third and fourth singlet excited states occur at 3.63 and 3.66 eV. The fifth state at 3.70 eV is the next bright exciton but with a very weak absorption cross section compared to the first bright state. In both bulk crystals and T4 dimers, the fifth and sixth singlet excited states are the lowest CT states. In the crystal, they both occur at 3.70 eV, and in the T4 dimer at 4.0 \u00c5 separation, they occur at 5.18 and 5.30 eV. Excited states observed by two-photon absorption at 2.5 eV26 or at 2.67 and 3.27 eV by EA spectroscopy have been proposed as low-lying states of 1Ag symmetry. These values compare to the 21Ag state in the T4 dimer CIS calculations at 4.85 eV.\nThe CIS calculations reported here are equivalent to GW/BSE calculations in the TDA with no screening of the HF exchange interaction (included in a GW calculation) and none in the electron\u2013hole attraction (included in a screened BSE calculation). Omission of screening in both cases results in a degree of selfcancellation, but the CIS method typically yields excitation energies in conjugated organic molecules greater than experimental values.\nThe EA spectrum of the T4 monomer and cofacial dimers was reported as a function of dimer separation. In the xxxx field configuration where input and output optical fields and static fields in an EA experiment are aligned with the long T4 molecular axis, the EA signal is dominated by the ground state to 11Bu transition and intermediate transitions to higher states of 1Ag symmetry. This EA feature does not depend strongly on T4 dimer separation as each excited state involved is an intramolecular Frenkel excited state. In contrast, in the xxzz field configuration, where input and output optical fields are aligned with the long T4 molecular axis and static fields are aligned with an axis that passes through both molecules, the EA signal is dominated by the ground state to the 21Bu CT excited state and an intermediate transition to the 21Bg CT excited state. At a dimer separation of 4 \u00c5, the 21Bu CT state energy is 5.38 eV. The small splitting of the 21Bu and 21Bg states results in a second derivative line shape for this feature in the EA spectrum, which is about five times weaker than the main 11Bu feature in the xxxx field configuration.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 074901 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0098575 157, 074901-10\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:19:02\nCalculations reported here and experimental observations of efficient polaron generation following light absorption make it seem likely that there are low-lying CT excitons in P3[Alkyl]T that are important in generation of charge carriers in these lamellar systems. Creation of such CT excitons is widely believed to be an important intermediate step in free carrier generation in organic photovoltaics.48 It may be possible to increase the sensitivity of EA to CT states in highly oriented P3[Alkyl]T films by applying the static field along an axis perpendicular to the polymer chains that passes through multiple polymer chains and the optical field parallel to the chains. The CT line shape is found to be a second derivative line shape in our calculations and in a feature observed in experimental EA spectra of P3[Dec]T.3\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe supplementary material includes the following: (1) lattice parameters and fractional coordinates of periodic polythiophene systems reported in Sec. III C; (2) basis sets used for calculations on both the T4 dimer and periodic polythiophene systems; (3) tables containing wave function coefficients and excitation energies for the T4 dimer as a function of separation in a 4 \u00d7 4 model Hamiltonian; and (4) extrapolation of thiophene oligomer S1 excitation energies to the infinite polymer."
