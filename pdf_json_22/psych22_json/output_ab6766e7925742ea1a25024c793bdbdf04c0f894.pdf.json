    "abstractText": "Background: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of disorders on the schizophreniabipolar spectrum, i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a biomarker of cognitive impairment in these disorders as it plays a critical role in neuroplasticity and proposed to mediate some of the psychotropic effects of medication. However, despite numerous studies investigating the association between circulating BDNF and these disorders, no solid conclusions have been drawn regarding its involvement in cognitive impairment.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been proposed to be a biomarker of cognitive impairment in these disorders as it plays a critical role in neuroplasticity and proposed to mediate some of the psychotropic effects of medication. However, despite numerous studies investigating the association between circulating BDNF and these disorders, no solid conclusions have been drawn regarding its involvement in cognitive impairment.\nObjectives: The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine blood BDNF levels and cognitive dysfunction in patients on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum as well as to evaluate whether circulating BDNF measurements can act as a biomarker for cognitive dysfunction.\nMethods: Studies were identified by searching Embase and Medline databases for English language articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 January and 2021 June according to the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 815 articles were identified of which 32 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review \u2013 reporting on comparisons between blood BDNF levels and cognitive functions of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patients versus healthy controls (no studies involving schizoaffective patients were specifically obtained for the time being). Twenty-four of these studies (19 with schizophrenia and 5 with bipolar disorder patients) were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis.\nResults: Our findings indicated that circulating BDNF levels were significantly reduced in patients experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls. Cognitive function was also found to be significantly worse in patients, however, correlations between BDNF levels and cognitive impairment were not always detected. Interventions, especially pharmacotherapy seemed to improve certain aspects of cognition and increase circulating BDNF levels.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827322\nfpsyt-13-827322 May 18, 2022 Time: 15:16 # 2\nDombi et al. BDNF, Cognition, and Schizophrenia-Bipolar Spectrum\nConclusion: Circulating BDNF alone does not seem to be a valid biomarker of cognitive dysfunction in patients with disorders on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum, owing to several confounding factors. Changes of the circulating levels of BDNF should be evaluated in a wider context of other stress-, immune-, and inflammatory-related factors.\nKeywords: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, BDNF, cognition, biomarker"

            "text": "Schizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder characterized by considerable distortions of thinking and perception driven by three core symptom domains; positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction (1). Bipolar disorder is also a major psychiatric condition, but it is recognized by the alternation of mood episodes and behavioral activation (1). The prevalence of both disorders is around 1% of the general population (2, 3). An intermediate phenotype between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is schizoaffective disorder, which is characterized by the concurrent occurrence of an equal admixture of both schizophrenic and major affective disorder symptoms cross-sectionally and/or longitudinally (1). Together, the three disorders can be referred to as schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum disorders.\nCognitive dysfunction, defined broadly as the inability to properly process information, has been well established to be a core feature of these disorders (4, 5). In bipolar disorder, cognitive impairment usually manifests in specific cognitive domains such as attention, verbal memory, or executive functioning with greater severity throughout the acute manic-depressive episodes compared to the euthymic states (6\u20138). In contrast, the same cognitive deficits in schizophrenia tend to be stable across time without considerable improvements between psychotic episodes (9, 10). Deficits in cognition have also been described in schizoaffective disorder and at a greater extent than in patients with bipolar disorder (11). Importantly, cognitive impairment has been proposed to be a crucial factor in achieving improved functioning and quality of life in these patient groups (12\u201314). However, since currently there are no effective treatments for cognitive impairment in the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum, it remains a major unmet clinical need (15). Thus, investigating potential biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction is not only crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of disorders on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum, but also for the development of potential treatments and interventions (16, 17). One of the candidates for such biomarker is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\nBrain-derived neurotrophic factor is a member of the nerve growth factor family, which functions include enhancing the growth and maintenance of various neuronal systems, ensuring neuronal plasticity, modulating neurotransmitter activity, and contributing to learning and memory throughout life (18\u201321). It facilitates neuronal plasticity via the stimulation of dendritic growth, the formation of synapses as well as neurogenesis in brain areas related to memory such as the hippocampus (21, 22). Activation of BDNF release from axons is influenced negatively by several factors including\ninflammation, stress as well as age (21). Since BDNF can be readily measured in blood, several studies have associated its peripheral concentrations with central functions and neuropathology. For instance, circulating BDNF levels have been associated with hippocampal volume and spatial memory in older adults, with lower levels of BDNF correlating with smaller volume of the hippocampus and worse performance on neurocognitive tests (23). Furthermore, in terms of stress, animal studies found that social isolation in mice resulted in decreased BDNF levels in several brain areas including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus (24). In view of these results and that it can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, BDNF has gained considerable attention as a possible biomarker for neurocognitive processes in several psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders (25) such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (26), autism spectrum disorder (27), or disorders on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum (28).\nSeveral studies measured the concentrations of BDNF in the blood and examined its relationship with cognitive symptoms in patients on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum compared to healthy controls in order to better understand the role of BDNF. The findings of such studies however were quite mixed; a meta-analysis by Ahmed et al. did not observe significant connection between cognitive impairment and BDNF levels in the blood based on five schizophrenia studies (29). Another systematic review and meta-analysis involving 21 studies with schizophrenia patients reported a positive correlation between cognitive impairment and reduced blood BDNF levels, especially in chronic samples (30). In the case of bipolar disorder, metaanalyses have consistently reported reduced BDNF levels in manic and depressive episodes compared to healthy controls (31, 32), but the connection between BDNF levels and cognition in these reviews were not examined.\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis aims to update the existing literature regarding circulating BDNF levels and cognitive functioning in the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum in comparison to healthy controls, in order to conclusively demonstrate whether blood BDNF can act as a biomarker of cognitive dysfunction."

The effect size was calculated for differences between baseline BDNF levels of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls or bipolar patients and healthy controls in ng/ml using mean, SD, and sample sizes. In case of cognitive scores, the effect size was based on the differences between baseline Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scores of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls using mean, SD, and sample sizes. As effect size measure, Hedge\u2019s g was computed since the studies included in the meta-analyses had relatively small sample sizes and Hedge\u2019s g is less biased in case when variance equality assumptions are not met.\nThe meta-analyses were performed using the \u201cmeta\u201d package in R studio, with standardized mean difference used as effect size measurement. While Z statistic was calculated to determine the significance of the effect size, Q statistic was computed to provide an estimation of the degree of homogeneity of the effect sizes of the different studies. The degree of inconsistency was signalized with the I2 metric (I2 > 75% indicating large heterogeneity, >50% moderate heterogeneity, and <50% low heterogeneity). To present the effect sizes of individual studies, a forest plot was created.\nDue to the heterogeneity of studies, separate analyses for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients were performed with three random-effects meta-analyses. The first analysis examined the difference in circulating BDNF levels between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, the second examined the difference in circulating BDNF levels between bipolar disorder patients and healthy controls, and the third looked at the difference in cognitive functions measured by RBANS between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Data was scarce to conduct an analysis for the difference between bipolar disorder patients and healthy controls in terms of cognitive functions. Similarly, conducting a meta-analysis of correlation coefficients was impossible due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data. In these cases, qualitative analyses were performed."

A total of 815 articles were identified and 69 were determined as potentially eligible to be included in the review based on the titles and abstracts. After evaluating the articles fully, only 32 met the inclusion criteria as in several articles there were no control group present (21 studies) or the reporting on BDNF levels (6 studies) or cognitive functions (9 studies) was inadequate. The majority of studies (26 studies) were conducted with schizophrenia patients; 16 of them were with either first-episode patients (FEP) (34\u201341) or patients with chronic schizophrenia (CH) (42\u201348). In the bipolar studies there were patients in euthymic state (49\u201352) and in depressive (53) and manic (50) episodes involved. No studies involving schizoaffective patients were obtained which is a relevant shortcoming. Altogether, 4,754 schizophrenia and 476 bipolar disorder patients were compared to 3,526 healthy controls in the systematic review. In terms of level of evidence, most of the studies were level B according to the rating system by Siwek et al., meaning that the design of the studies were of lower quality, mostly case-control studies, and there were only a few randomized controlled trials (level A) (54).\nStudies where BDNF levels or RBANS scores were not reported for the total patient population were excluded from the meta-analyses. The first analysis that compared baseline BDNF levels between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls included 19 studies. The second analysis that looked at baseline BDNF levels of bipolar disorder patients versus healthy controls included five studies (49, 51\u201353, 55). The third and final analysis examined the differences of baseline RBANS scores between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls also included 5 studies (34, 48, 56\u201358)."

Statistically significant difference between patients and healthy controls was detected in 25 studies (21 with schizophrenia and 4 with bipolar disorder patients) as summarized in Table 1. Importantly, 24 of these studies reported decreased blood BDNF levels in patients compared to controls; only one study by Asevedo et al. found higher BDNF levels in schizophrenia patients than in controls (59). Out of the seven studies where no significant difference was reported, two were conducted with euthymic bipolar disorder patients (49, 52), while the rest was with schizophrenia patients (37, 46, 60\u201362). The other two studies examining euthymic bipolar patients found reduced BDNF levels compared to healthy controls, nonetheless, it was highlighted that the levels were still higher than what was found in manic bipolar patients (50, 51).\nWhen analyzing the effect sizes, large effect size (Hedges\u2019 g of 0.8 or larger) was detected in 15 studies (1 study with bipolar and 14 with schizophrenia patients), medium (Hedges\u2019 g of 0.5\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 827322\nfpsyt-13-827322 May 18, 2022 Time: 15:16 # 4\nDombi et al.

Large effect sizes were predominantly acquired in studies with first episode schizophrenia (34, 35, 38, 41, 63). In contrast, small effect sizes were more likely to be seen in studies involving bipolar patients (4 out of 6 studies) (49, 51, 52, 55). The smallest effect sizes were associated with patients with CH and/or patients receiving antipsychotic medication monotherapy (40, 46, 58, 60, 61). Importantly, female patients also seemed to have BDNF levels closer to normal compared to males (52, 64).\nThe meta-analysis of 19 schizophrenia studies was conducted with a total of 2,970 patients versus 1,920 healthy controls (Figure 2). The random effects estimate showed a moderate reduction of BDNF levels in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls (g = \u22120.65, 95% CI: \u22120.90 to \u22120.40). The level of heterogeneity was high (I2 = 93%, p < 0.01). The meta-analysis of the 5 bipolar disorder studies involved a total\nof 392 patients and 293 controls (Figure 3). In case of bipolar disorder patients, the random effects model reported a small reduction of BDNF levels in bipolar disorder patients in contrast to health controls (g =\u22120.32, 95% CI:\u22120.71 to 0.06) with slightly lower heterogeneity (I2 = 79%, p < 0.01)."

            "text": "The assessment of cognitive functions varied within the reviewed literature. Most commonly (12 studies) the RBANS (65) was applied, whereas 7 studies used other validated scales such as the MATRICSTM Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) (40, 43, 66), the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) (51, 67) or the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) (60, 68). The RBANS is a brief test that evaluates five indexes: immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, and delayed memory (65). In contrast, the BACS measures cognition functions via verbal memory, verbal fluency, working memory, motor speed, attention, and executive functioning (68), while the MCCB evaluates peed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition (66). The rest of the studies chose a combination of individual assessments that measured specific cognitive domains such as executive functioning, inhibition, or different aspects of memory (e.g., verbal or visual memory) via tests such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) or specific parts of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (44, 50, 59).\nImportantly, almost all studies (29 out of 32) reported significant difference between patients and controls, with patients exhibiting deficits in several cognitive domains. Concerning schizophrenia studies, differences between first episode and chronic patients were detected; higher scores were found in the chronic population compared to the first-episode population on the RBANS, with mean scores of 70.3 and 66.0, respectively (Table 2). Differences between males and females were also prevalent; female patients, especially in chronic populations, had lower cognitive impairment than male patients (35, 47, 64).\nThe meta-analysis of 5 schizophrenia studies was conducted with a total of 871 patients versus 610 healthy controls (Figure 4). The random effects estimate showed a large reduction of RBANS scores in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls (g = \u22122.26, 95% CI: \u22123.43 to \u22121.09). The level of heterogeneity was high (I2 = 99%, p < 0.01).\nIn case of bipolar disorder, patients in all states (manic, depressive or euthymic) were found to perform worse than controls on the different cognitive tests (49\u201352). Interestingly, significant difference between manic compared to euthymic patients was found in only one domain (verbal memory) in a study by Mora et al. (50). Nonetheless, the scores of euthymic patients were still lower than that of healthy controls (50). Similar results were acquired in patients treated with lithium, where poorer results on all cognitive domains compared to controls were reported (51). Importantly, the study also highlighted that excellent lithium responders had numerically better results than non-excellent responders (51).

Only two studies by Wu et al. and Xiao et al. found significant correlations; Wu et al. reported negative correlation between delayed memory index from RBANs and serum BDNF levels (r=\u22120.26; p < 0.05), however only in patients with high baseline BDNF levels (38), Xiao et al. found negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and executive functioning (r = \u22120.40;\np < 0.01) and positive correlation with verbal function (r = 0.27; p < 0.05) (41).\nThe rest of the studies examining schizophrenia detected significant correlations between circulating BDNF levels and semantic generation task (59), and verbal memory, attention and processing speed (60), verbal and executive functioning (39), and RBANS total score (58, 69, 70).

According to the results, statistically significant change was detected in global cognition as well as BDNF levels in response to the training (43). By week 10, the BDNF levels in patients were comparable to that of healthy controls; at baseline these were significantly lower than of the healthy controls (43). Nonetheless, no significant association was found between the changes in BDNF levels and the cognitive measurements (43). The other study that examined the effects of non-pharmacological treatment on BDNF levels and cognitive impairment randomized 70 patients to either cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) or social skills training (control group) for 4 weeks (62). Although some improvements in cognition were detected, the authors could not report any significant changes in serum BDNF levels in response to the CRT (62). Moreover, the association between cognitive improvements and BDNF levels were also non-significant (62). Both RCTs evaluated cognition via the MCCB (43, 62).\nIn terms of pharmacological therapies, Zhang et al. designed a 12-week open-label, prospective observational trial to examine the effects of olanzapine on BDNF and cognitive functioning and thus to evaluate if BDNF can act as a biomarker for cognition (58). At baseline, the 95 patients exhibited significantly worse cognitive performance as measured by RBANS and lower plasma BDNF levels than the 72 controls (58). In response to olanzapine treatment, significant improvements in immediate memory, attention, and total RBANS score as well as increased plasma BDNF levels compared to baseline were detected (58). Importantly, the increase in BDNF plasma levels showed correlation with the change in the RBANS scores (58). Based on\nthe results, the authors concluded that plasma BDNF levels might be a potential biomarker for cognitive functioning in patients with acute schizophrenia (58).\nSimilarly, Wu et al. conducted a 12-week, flexible-dose, prospective, observational trial in 354 drug-na\u00efve FEP with schizophrenia (38). The aim was to evaluate the impact of risperidone treatment on serum BDNF levels and cognitive functioning measured by RBANS (38). According to the results, poorer cognitive functioning and lower serum BDNF levels were detected at baseline in patients compared to 152 controls (38). In response to treatment, significant improvement in memory, delayed memory and RBANS total score as well as slight increase in BDNF levels was found (38). Interestingly, when separating patients to low-BDNF and high-BDNF baseline groups, different responses to antipsychotic medication were acquired (38). Those in the low-BDNF group had increased, while those in the high-BDNF group had decreased plasma levels after risperidone treatment (38). In addition, correlations between lower BDNF levels and delayed memory were also detected, but only in patients who had higher baseline BDNF levels (38)."

BDNF, Cognition, and Schizophrenia-Bipolar Spectrum\ncognitive functioning, to compare patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder in terms of circulating BDNF levels and cognitive dysfunction, and to understand the relationship between BDNF and cognition in these patient populations. The relevance of the results is discussed below.\nThe results confirmed that there is a moderate reduction in patients with schizophrenia and small reduction in patients with bipolar disorder in serum or plasma BDNF levels compared to healthy controls. The results are in line with previous meta-analyses that also found moderate quality evidence of reduced blood BDNF levels in these patient groups (16, 71\u2013 73). Similarly to the results of a comparative meta-analysis by Fernandes et al., the present study also agrees that the decrease in circulating BDNF levels compared to healthy controls is greater in acute patients than in those in chronic or euthymic states (73). Differences in blood BDNF levels also seem to depend on several other factors including sex, age, or medication, which was again shown by previous research as well (74, 75).\nIn contrast to circulating BDNF levels, cognitive impairment was found to be pronounced in all states and stages of the disorders, confirming that indeed cognitive deficits are a core feature of the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum. Interestingly however, better scores on different cognition assessments were reported in patients with CH compared to patients in first episode. In terms of the relationship between circulating BDNF levels and cognitive functioning, significant but negligible correlations were found in more than one third of the reviewed studies. Differences between patient groups were also prevalent in this aspect of the analysis as well; significant correlations were more likely to be found in chronic patients compared to first episode patients, and in female patients compared to males.\nAll in all, circulating BDNF levels alone do not seem to be a valid biomarker of cognitive dysfunction in patients on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum. Although BDNF has been repeatedly found to be reduced in patients compared to healthy controls, the correlations between BDNF and cognition are weak. This is especially true for drug na\u00efve first episode patients who have high levels of cognitive dysfunction and low levels of blood BDNF, yet the two are not correlated. Indeed, the relationship between cognition and BDNF is more pronounced in patients with CH, suggesting that factors such as age or state of disorder might be mediating this relationship. This has been proposed by previous reviews as well; although the meta-analysis by Bora et al. found correlation between cognitive symptoms and BDNF levels, they also concluded that the relationship between the two might be rather indirect (30). In addition, Fernandes et al. came to similar conclusions too, suggesting that reduced BDNF levels might be connected to the suppressive effects of stress (73).\nIf putting these results into context, it is likely that the reason why most reduction in BDNF levels was detected in first-episode, drug na\u00efve patients is due to that fact that these patients experience the highest levels of stress.\nAs the stress levels are lower in chronic, medicated, and euthymic patients, the BDNF levels are less influenced by it and hence correlations between cognitive symptoms are more prevalent. The fact that most correlations in this patient population were found in executive functioning, immediate memory, and processing speed \u2013 neurocognitive functions all mediated by the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex \u2013 further supports this notion.\nFinally, it deserves attention from clinical point of view that blood BDNF levels and cognitive symptoms were found to improve after certain therapies and antipsychotic medications. In case of pharmacotherapy, the improvement in cognitive functioning and circulating BDNF levels were even correlated. Some experimental results suggest that D3 receptors may also play a role in influencing BDNF levels and cognitive improvement (76\u201379). Thus, further research needs to investigate whether novel medications targeting D3 receptors have different effects on BDNF levels in patients on the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum and how these potential changes in BDNF levels would relate to cognitive impairment."

            "text": "The main limitation of this systematic review is the heterogeneity of the studies; large differences in sample sizes, patient populations, BDNF measurements (plasma or serum) and cognitive scales were prevalent. Due to this heterogeneity the relationship between BDNF levels and cognitive dysfunction could not be quantified, as neither the Hedges\u2013Olkin nor the Schmidt\u2013Hunter method is suitable for a small number of heterogeneous studies (80). In addition, according to Rosenfeld et al., there is significant difference between BDNF serum and plasma levels, nonetheless as previous reviews, this review also analyzed serum and plasma BDNF levels together (81). Furthermore, in some articles, potential overlap in samples were detected, hence, introducing bias to the analysis. The systematic review also did not account for neither the maturity of BDNF nor BDNF polymorphism, which could play an important role in determining BDNF levels in the periphery. Finally, no studies with exclusively schizoaffective patients were obtained, hence, this patient group is missing from the schizophreniabipolar spectrum."
