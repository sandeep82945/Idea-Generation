            "text": "NFDI1 is a German initiative to set up and consolidate research data infrastructures across all disciplines, covering Engineering Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, and Natural Sciences. To ensure sustainability, it will integrate national with international activities.\n1www.nfdi.de\nCoRDI2023-19 1\nBuilding on activities by domain-specific NFDI consortia, Base4NFDI2 represents a cross-disciplinary collaboration. It is a unique joint effort of all 26 NFDI consortia to develop and deploy NFDI-wide basic services. These services will be integrated into the emerging infrastructures at the European level, especially the EOSC. The target group for basic services is the wider NFDI-community and, in particular, operators of community-specific services. The resulting NFDI-wide basic service portfolio will be beneficial for all disciplines by facilitating core tasks in research data management. A service in this context is defined as technical-organisational solution which typically includes storage and computing services, software, processes and workflows, as well as the necessary personnel support for different service desks. A basic service is meant to add value for the consortia and their users typically by bundling existing services. It is characterized by scalability and a model for sustainable operation, thereby requiring a certain degree of technicality. It is meant to deliver effectiveness - measurable by KPIs - over time and regarding usage.\nDecisions on basic services are made by all consortia in the bodies of the NFDI Association. To generate proposals for basic services, Base4NFDI will draw on the expertise in NFDI\u2019s Sections. They are the loci for exchange between consortia on cross-cutting topics, provide infrastructural and technological expertise in combination with domain knowledge and act as incubators for identifying potential basic services. Potential basic services are thus identified in the Sections, each of which focuses on a topical area: \u2018Common Infrastructures\u2019, \u2018Education and Training\u2019, \u2018Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects\u2019, \u2018Metadata, Terminologies and Provenance\u2019, and the newly established Section \u2019Industry Engagement\u2019. This broad approach to identifying ideas and needs for basic services reflects, that services relating to research data management must\n2www.base4nfdi.de\nCoRDI2023-19 2\nsupport a large number of use-cases also including non-technical but organizational ones and thus cover elements like staff for a helpdesk.\nAfter two rounds of proposals in February and May 2023, development will commence with services for Identity and Access Management (IAM), Persistent Identifiers (PID) as well as Terminologies. The IAM Service aims to establish approved identities and organizationally defined access rights across service providers, which will be crucial for seamless data management workflows. The PID Service aims to build on established infrastructures and address challenges such as different levels of maturity in PID implementation across domains. The Terminology Service aims to standardise and harmonise terminology management within NFDI, thereby facilitating consensusbuilding and interoperability of services across disciplines.\nFor development, Base4NFDI relies on a three-stage process of 1) initialisation of basic services 2) integration of basic services and 3) ramping-up for operation and becoming part of the NFDI basic service portfolio.\nThe work program of Base4NFDI is clustered in four Task Areas. Task Areas \u2018Service requirements, design and development\u2019 and \u2018Service integration and ramping-up for operation\u2019 will accompany and support the basic services within the three phases of the process. Task Area \u2018Service coherence processes and monitoring\u2019 will overlook the whole process, and Task Area \u2018Project governance\u2019 will manage the project.\nWithin this talk, we will give an overview of Base4NFDI, especially its structures and the status of its emerging work program. We will inform about ways to participate and contribute ideas for potential basic services.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests."
