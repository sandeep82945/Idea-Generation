Anti-BrdU (ab6326), anti-insulin (guinea pig, ab7842), anti-glucagon (rabbit, ab92517), anti-RFP (ab124754) and IgG (ab37415 ChIP grade for ChIP-seq experiments) antibodies were from Abcam; H3K4me3 (#61379), H3K27ac (#39685) and H3K27me3 (#61017) antibodies were from Active motif; anti-Glut2 (#07-1402-1) was from Merck; anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody (#9661S) was from Cell Signaling; anti-PC1/3 (AB10553) was from Millipore. Antiglucagon (mouse, G2654) and anti-FLAG (clone M2) were from Sigma-Aldrich. The HLM006474 compound was first described in (1) and synthetized as previously described (2). The list of primers used in this study is presented in Supplementary Table S2.\nAnimal Experiments. Mice were maintained according to European Union guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. Mice were housed under a 12-hr light/dark cycle and given a regular chow (A04;Safe). E2f1-/- (B6; 129S4-E2f1tm1Meg/J) mice and db/+ mice (Janvier Labs) were crossed to obtain db/db::E2f1+/+ and db/db::E2f1-/- mice and were previously described in (3). CMV-CDK4R24C (4) and Cdkn2a-/- (5) were described elsewhere and were crossed with E2f1-/- mice to obtain E2f1-/-::CMV-CDK4R24C and E2f1-/-::Cdkn2a-/-. The congenic mice carrying the floxed E2f1 allele were thereafter mated with rat insulin II promoter (RIP)-Cre (6) to generate RIPcreTg/+::E2f1flox/flox mice. To delete E2f1 in adult \u03b2 cells, we developed a mouse model allowing targeted recombination of E2f1 in\n\u03b2 cells through the use of a tamoxifen inducible strategy. To this end, E2f1flox/flox were crossed with MIP-CreERT mice (Jax Lab, stock number #024709). E2f1flox/flox, RipCre/+ and MIP-CreERT were intercrossed to generate pure mutant RipCre Tg/+ /E2f1flox/flox and MIP-CreERT Tg/+ /E2f1flox/flox mice. A PCR genotyping strategy was subsequently used to identify RIP-creTg/+::E2f1+/+ (Rip-Cre/+), Rip-cre+/+::E2f1flox/flox or MIP-CreERT +/+ ::E2f1flox/flox (E2f1fl/fl), RIPcreTg/+::E2f1flox/flox (E2f1-/-) and MIPCreERT Tg/+ ::E2f1flox/flox (E2f1MIP-CreERT -/-) mice. Tamoxifen was dissolved in corn oil\n(stock solution, 20mg/mL) at 52\u00b0C in agitation for 15min and was then administrated to both 2-month-old E2f1fl/fl control and E2f1MIP-CreERT -/- transgenic animals by gavage\nonce per day for 7 days at the dose of 4mg/day. After gavage, a stock solution of 1 mg/mL (stored at 4\u00b0C) was prepared in advance by dissolving 100mg of Tamoxifen Citrate (Biogaran) in 100 mL of drinking water. This solution was then diluted 1:20 in drinking water and provided to the animals for 1 week after the gavage induction in black bottles to prevent any alteration of the drug. Metabolic phenotyping experiments were performed according to the EMPRESS protocols. For in vivo insulin secretion, E2f1fl/lf and E2f1MIP-CreERT-/- mice were starved\nfor 5/6 hours prior Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion (GSIS) to evaluate the basal insulinemia. Blood was collected from mice anesthetized with isoflurane delivered in oxygen at a flow rate of 1l/min. Whole blood samples were collected from the retroorbital cavity into blood collection tubes containing EDTA, using sterile glass capillaries. To assess insulin secretion level, a second blood sample was collected 20 minutes after an intraperitoneal injection of 2g/kg of body weight of D-(+)-glucose. Plasma was obtained by centrifuging at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4C\u00b0. Thereafter, it was transferred into pre-cooled tubes and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80C\u00b0.\nPlasma insulin concentration was evaluated by using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Ultrasensitive immunoassay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All reagents and samples were pre-warm at room temperature before use. The optical density was read at 450 nm, using a spectrophotometer ELISA reader (Sunrise BasicTecan, Crailsheim, Germany), supported by the Tecan\u2019s Magellan data analyses software. Insulin concentration was calculated using the online analyses software (myAssay.com), as suggested from the provider. Measurment of cell proliferation, apoptosis and \u03b2-cell size. To assess cellular proliferation, 5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (BrdU, B9285, Sigma Aldrich) was administrated to 4 E2f1\u03b2-/- mice and 4 E2f1fl/fl control littermates. BrdU was dissolved in drinking water (1mg/ml) and provided to mice in dark bottles to protect the solution from the light. The solution was prepared fresh and it was changed every two days for 8 days prior to analyses. Pancreata were harvested, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 \u00b5m. The pancreatic sections were co-stained with anti-BrdU and antiPC1/3, and slides were mounted with DAPI mounting-medium for nuclei-staining. Islet numbers and area were calculated with Axiovision software in squared-Pixel (PC1/3 positive area), and BrdU+/DAPI+ nuclei were counted. To measure apoptosis and \u03b2cell size, pancreatic tissues were fixed with 10% formalin solution, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Immunofluorescence analysis were performed on 5 \u00b5m tissue sections. The sections were first de-paraffinized and re-hydrated, followed by a heatinduced antigen retrieval in citrate buffer. Sections were then incubated with blocking buffer for 30minutes and primary anti-Glut2 (for measuring \u03b2-cell size) or anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibodies (for measuring apoptosis) diluted at 1:100 in blocking buffer solution over night at +4\u00b0C. Immunofluorescent stainings were revealed using an\nalexa-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (for Glut-2) or fluoresceinisothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (for cleaved caspase-3). Nuclei were stained with Dapi (SigmaAldrich, D9542). For cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining, intestinal FFPE sections from murine trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of colitis (a kind gift of Dr Laurent Dubuquoy, Lille) was a positive control. Image acquisitions were done using a Spinning disk confocal microscope (Zeiss). 20 islets per mice were analyzed and 5 mice from each genotype were used to analyze \u03b2-cell size and apoptosis. Analysis and quantification were performed on ImageJ software using a macro program (developed in the lab and available upon request).\nRNA-Sequencing. RNA quality was verified using RNA 6000 nanochips (Agilent, 5067-1511) on the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, G2939A). Purified RNA (50ng) with RNA integrity number \u22656.5 was subsequently used for library preparation (TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit, #20020594, Illumina) and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 system (Illumina). 3 biological replicates per condition were sequenced using paired-end mode. The demultiplexing of sequence data (from BCL files generated by Illumina sequencing systems to standard FASTQ file formats) was performed using bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina; version 2.19.1). Trimming of residuals adapters and low-quality reads was performed using Cutadapt software (version 1.7.1). A mean of 54 million paired-end reads of 75 bp were generated for each sample. After initial checks and validation of sequence quality, RNA-seq reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using TopHat2 or STAR Aligner (version 2.5.2b). Subsequently, both quantification and annotation of the reads were performed using Bioconductor package Rsubread. The counting of the different genes\nand isoforms was performed using RSEM (version 1.3). Finally, the differential gene expression analyses were performed using Bioconductor package DESeq2.\nChIP sequencing. 1 ng of eluted and purified DNA was used to prepare DNA sequencing library with the Nextflex rapid DNA seq kit 2.0 (Perkin Elmer, NOVA-518801) on the NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) using single read 100 base pairs mode. Sequence reads from FASTQ files were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using Bowtie2 Aligner (version 2.3.5.1). The demultiplexing of sequence data (from BCL files generated by Illumina sequencing systems to standard FASTQ file formats) was performed using bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina; version 2.20). Trimming of residuals adapters and low-quality reads was performed using TrimGalore (version 0.4.5). Finally, peak-calling was performed with MACS2 software (version 2.2.7.1).\nBioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatic analysis were mainly performed using the open web-based platform Galaxy Europe (https://usegalaxy.eu). Motif search was performed using Pscan Web Interface (7)."
