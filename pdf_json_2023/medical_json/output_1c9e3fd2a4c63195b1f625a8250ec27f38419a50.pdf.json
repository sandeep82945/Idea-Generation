Through a retrospective analysis of data on the same patients, with reference to the year prior to the initiation of the anti-TNF\u03b1 drug adalimumab, we aimed to show how the advent of this biologic therapy changes the number of days of antibiotic therapy, the number of flare-ups per year, and their duration in days, as well as the quality of life and perceived pain of patients.",

            "text": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition. It is characterized by the occurrence of nodules, which are often inflammatory, deep and painful, especially in skin regions with a high density of apocrine sweat glands such as the axillary, inguinal, and sub mammary regions [1]. The exact prevalence of HS is not known. European studies have shown that it is a condition that is far from rare [1]. It is considered to have an overall prevalence ranging from 1 to 4.1 percent, with a female: male ratio of 3.3:1 [2]. The onset of manifestations typically occurs between the second and third decades, and the average age of first onset is 21 years [1,2]. HS is associated with several other pathological conditions. These include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn\u2019s disease [3]. Patients suffer as much physically as psychologically, with worsening quality of life and a decline in work productivity. The numerous comorbidities make the management of the patient with HS extremely complex, with the need for a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the best chance of therapeutic management [4]. The application of staging and classification systems in the management of patients with HS arises from the need to produce treatment plans that are appropriate to the individual case and that consider the severity of the specific lesions. The two main tools are represented by Hurley\u2019s and Sartorius\u2019 systems, the former of which is qualitative and the latter of which is quantitative. They are complemented by other systems such as the PGA (HS-Physician\u2019s Global Assessment), the HSSI (HS Severity Index), and the AISI (Acne Inversa Severity Index). Additional scoring systems include the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), which is necessary to investigate the patient\u2019s quality of life, and the VAS (Visual Analogue Scale), which is used to quantify the patient\u2019s perceived pain. The presence of multiple systems is necessary because none of them turns out to be completely\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 837. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12030837 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 837 2 of 8\nsufficient to assess the severity of the pathology, and it is possible to identify the relative advantages and disadvantages of each [5\u20137]. Another parameter commonly used to classify lesions is high-frequency ultrasound; very often the clinical parameter does not match the ultrasound parameter because the latter has a higher sensitivity than the clinical evaluation, so it becomes essential to use ultrasound to determine the severity of the lesions [8,9]. To date, antibiotics and biologics are the most widely used treatments for the disease. On the one hand, antibiotics are useful in improving the severity of the disease but particularly in managing over-infections; unfortunately, they do not have long-term efficacy because they can be used for short periods of time; on the other hand, adalimumab is the only biologic drug approved for HS. The combination of these two therapies has led to good and effective therapeutic responses in real-life experiences [10]."

The patients received the same adalimumab therapy for one year: induction phase: 160 mg (4 \u00d7 40 mg or 2 \u00d7 80 mg) at T0, 80 mg (2 \u00d7 40 mg or 80 mg) after 2 weeks, and then 40 mg after another 2 weeks; maintenance phase: 40 mg/week [14]. First, we evaluated the number of days for which antibiotics were used by patients during treatment with adalimumab. At T1, after 12 months of treatment, patients had performed an average of 21.48 \u00b1 20.47 days of antibiotic therapy. From the recorded data, it was found that in 58% of the cases, the oral antibiotic combination of clindamycin (600 mg/day) and rifampin (600 mg/day) was prescribed; in 30% of the cases, there was the use of limecycline 300 mg; and in the remaining 12%, there was the use of doxycycline 100 mg for two times/day. Regarding disease flare-ups, we analyzed two variables, namely the number of flareups and their duration in days. We obtained 2.32 \u00b1 2.62 annual flare-ups at T1, and their duration averaged 3.90 \u00b1 1.34 days.\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 837 3 of 8"

Such prolonged antibiotic therapies only increase antibiotic resistance, which is also a cause of prolonged antibiotic therapy [18,19]. To improve acute symptomatology in patients with few lesions, good results are also reported with the use of intra-lesional corticosteroids [5]. In fact, in several case reports [20], statistically significant results were found in terms of improvements in clinical response and quality of life after administration of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (ILTAC) at high doses (20\u201340 mg/mL). The best results were obtained when the disease had single-location and mild-to-moderate manifestations. However, the authors admitted that ILTAC treatment could be ineffective or clinically impractical in cases of multiple manifestations [20]. The\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 837 6 of 8\nauthors hypothesized that there is a synergism between corticosteroids (administered both intralesionally and systemically) and adalimumab [20]. The mechanism of action of corticosteroids in the treatment of HS is blocking the synthesis of leukotrienes and of proinflammatory cytokines through activation of the receptors of the glucocorticosteroids, and this could have a synergistic effect with the treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 [19\u201321]. In conclusion, another parameter that needs to be considered regarding the response or nonresponse to treatment and, consequently, the reduction in the number of days of antibiotic therapy undertaken and the number of flare-ups are certainly the risk factors; these certainly go into this assessment as widely described in the literature [12\u201321]."

            "text": "Currently, HS represents an ongoing therapeutic challenge for dermatologists, who are often faced with complex patients with multiple comorbidities who do not respond to currently available therapies [21]. For this reason, it is necessary to reconsider this pathology from a multidisciplinary point of view in which biologic therapy finds its role not only in reducing antibiotic prescriptions but also in giving the patient a stability of the inflammatory state that makes it possible to reduce the flare-ups of the pathology. Biologic therapy with adalimumab has been the subject of several studies in the literature, and it is now agreed that it represents a valuable tool, as its efficacy and safety have been confirmed, as well as its positive influence on patients\u2019 quality of life [22,23]. However, it should be kept in mind that a variable proportion of patients on adalimumab therapy experience flare-ups, more or less frequently. The therapeutic approaches that are available, including antibiotic therapy, to manage flare-ups are varied, and we believe that their combined, integrated, and targeted use is necessary to achieve disease stability [24]. Due to the lack of effective treatments for moderate to severe HS, new therapeutic options are being investigated that target specific cytokines involved in HS pathogenesis [25]. Inhibition of anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-1\u03b1 appear to be promising therapeutic options for moderate to severe HS that is refractory to adalimumab. In this regard, new phase III studies are underway in which anti-interleukin (IL)-17 biologic drugs, including bimekizumab and secukinumab, are showing promising results, but further studies are certainly needed to confirm their efficacy [26\u201328]. It is hoped that current and future investigations of HS biomarkers will lead to a better assessment of the disease and that further understanding of the inflammatory phenomena involved and cytokine cascades will lead to highly effective precision targeted therapy. In conclusion, our study showed that adalimumab therapy dramatically reduced the number of antibiotic therapy prescriptions while reducing the number and duration of flare-ups. The bias of our study may be due to the retrospective aspect of antibiotic prescriptions vs. the prospective aspect of adalimumab, so we believe that further studies are needed to confirm our results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.M. conceptualization, validation, visualization, writing-original draft preparation, writing\u2014review and editing.
