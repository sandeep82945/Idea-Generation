Introduction\nConduction heat transfer in rigid bodies is usually described under severe approximations that, many times, are not physically realistic, such as Dirichlet boundary conditions [1,2], Neumann boundary conditions [3,4], linear boundary conditions [4,5], constant source term [1,6], and constant thermal conductivity [2,5]. Such approximations have, as their main goal, the purpose of simplifying the mathematical description, allowing the use of more available and low-cost methods for simulations. Nevertheless, when the heat transfer process involves great temperature variations and, in particular, involves high temperature levels, these \u201clinear approaches\u201d may give rise to considerably inaccuracies [7\u20139]. The dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature has been the main subject of many works in the last twenty years, especially those which employ the Kirchhoff Transform [10\u201315]. The solution of nonlinear second order differential equations is the subject of many papers as, for instance, references [16\u201320]. In reference [16], the steady state heat transfer is treated by means of the local multi-quadratic radial basis function collocation method. In reference [17], a double iteration process is employed, while in [18], an enthalpy-based finite element method is employed, taking into account a phase change process. In [19], a nonstandard finite difference method is used for a heat transfer problem. Meshless methods, that represent the solution as a superposition of shape functions, have also been used for heat transfer problems [20]. The goal of this work is to provide a reliable and simple procedure for describing and simulating heat transfer problems, without the need for the usual simplifications, carried out for minimizing mathematical complexities. In order to illustrate, in an explicit way, the main objective of this work, let us consider the following problems:\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11070311 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311 2 of 13\nProblem 1.

On the other hand, Problem 2 is a nonlinear problem that requires much more effort to be simulated than what is necessary for Problem 1. In this work, we represent the solution of Problem 2 by means of the solution of problems such as Problem 1, provided the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 There exists a positive constant \u03b4 such that, for any T, k\u0303(T) \u2265 \u03b4 > 0; \u2022 .q = q\u0302( , T) is a non-in reasing function of T, f x; \u2022 f\u0302 (x, T) is a strictly increasing function of T, for any x; \u2022 lim\nT\u2192\u221e f\u0302 (x, T) = + \u221e, for any x;\n\u2022 lim T\u2192\u2212\u221e f\u0302 (x, T) = \u2212 \u221e, for any x; \u2022 f\u0302 (x, 0) \u2264 0, for any x \u2208 \u2202\u2126; \u2022 q\u0302(x, a) \u2265 0, for any x \u2208 \u2126, for any a \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\nIn other words, the solution of Problem 2 will be represented by the limit of the sequence [p1, p2, p3 . . .], in which\n\u2206vi \u2212 cvi + si\u22121 = 0 in \u2126, si\u22121 = s\u0302i\u22121(x), c = non negative constant \u2212\u2207vi\u00b7n = \u03b1vi \u2212 \u03b3i\u22121 on \u2202\u2126, \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3\u0302i\u22121(x), \u03b1 = positive constant vi = \u0398\u0303(pi), ddz \u0398\u0303(z) = k\u0303(z) \u2265 \u03b4 > 0, \u03b4 = constant\n(3)\nThe (known) functions s\u0302i\u22121(x) and \u03b3\u0302i\u22121(x) are obtained from the knowledge of vi\u22121. It is to be not ced that almost all steady-state heat transfer problems can be described\nby Problem 2 and satisfy the six above conditions. In addition, it i remarkable that the function \u0398 always admits an inverse. In fact, when k represents the thermal conductivity (or any diffusion coefficient), the existence of a positive lower bound is always ensured.\nWhen Equation (2) represents a heat transfer process, . q is a heat source (per unit time\nand per unit volume), k is the thermal conductivity, and T is the temperature. The function f represents the heat loss (per unit time and per unit area) from the body boundary. The main subject of this work is concerned with real physical applications arising from heat transfer problems. In this way, the domain \u2126 is assumed to have the cone property\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311 3 of 13\nand that its boundary is composed by a finite number of smooth parts. In addition, it is assumed that . q and f are bounded and are piecewise continuous functions of x for each given T. As physically expected, the function T (temperature) will be a continuous function in \u2126 and will satisfy Problem 2 almost everywhere. It is to be noticed that, in general, real heat transfer problems are nonlinear and usually are simulated under a severe hypothesis in order to avoid complex mathematical tools for their solutions. With the procedure proposed in this work, a large class of nonlinear heat transfer problems can be treated with simple basic tools, such as those used for solving the linear problems. The proposed procedure allows a low-cost simulation for problems that, usually, require sophisticated methods. In addition, since the solution will be obtained as the limit of a non-decreasing sequence (with a known upper bound), it is easy to verify the consistency of a given simulation. In other words, if the sequence does not behave as expected, the simulation must be stopped, because something must be corrected (probably \u03b1 or c is not large enough).\n2. Construction of the Non-Decreasing Sequence [v1, v2, v3 . . .]\nLet us consider the problem below:\n\u2206\u03a6 + Q = 0 in \u2126, Q = Q\u0302(x, \u03a6) \u2212\u2207\u03a6\u00b7n = F\u0302(x, \u03a6) on \u2202\u2126 (4)\nin which the functions F\u0302(x, \u03a6) and Q\u0302(x, \u03a6) have the following properties\n\u2022 Q\u0302(x, \u03a6) is a non-increasing function of \u03a6, for any x \u2208 \u2126; \u2022 F\u0302(x, \u03a6) is a strictly increasing function of \u03a6, for any x \u2208 \u2202\u2126; \u2022 lim\n\u03a6\u2192+\u221e F\u0302(x, \u03a6) = +\u221e, for any x \u2208 \u2202\u2126;\n\u2022 lim \u03a6\u2192\u2212\u221e F\u0302(x, \u03a6) = \u2212 \u221e, for any x \u2208 \u2202\u2126; \u2022 F\u0302(x, 0) \u2264 0, for any x \u2208 \u2202\u2126; \u2022 Q\u0302(x, a) \u2265 0, for any x \u2208 \u2126, for any a \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\nThus, the sequence [v1, v2, v3 . . .], whose elements are obtained from the solution of\n\u2206vi \u2212 cvi + si\u22121 = 0 in \u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . \u2212\u2207vi\u00b7n = \u03b1vi \u2212 \u03b3i\u22121 on \u2202\u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . si\u22121 = s\u0302i\u22121(x) = cvi\u22121 + Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b3\u0302i\u22121(x) = \u03b1vi\u22121 \u2212 F\u0302(x, vi\u22121) v0 \u2261 0\n(5)\nis a convergent non-increasing sequence, provided c and \u03b1 are sufficiently large constants in order to ensure that\nc(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) \u2265 Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi), i = 1, 2, . . . \u03b1(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) \u2265 F\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 F\u0302(x, vi\u22121), i = 1, 2, . . .\n(6)\nAs a first step, let us prove that v1 is non-negative everywhere. Aiming for this, we write, from Equation (5), for i = 1\n\u2206v1 \u2212 cv1 + s0 = 0 in \u2126 \u2212\u2207v1\u00b7n = \u03b1v1 \u2212 \u03b30 on \u2202\u2126 s0 = cv0 + Q\u0302(x, v0) \u03b30 = \u03b1v0 \u2212 F\u0302(x, v0) v0 \u2261 0\n(7)\nNow, let us assume that v1 assumes its minimum at a point x\u2217 \u2208 \u2126. Thus, there exists a small neighborhood of x\u2217 in which \u2206v1 \u2265 0. Therefore, in this neighborhood, \u2212cv1 + s0 \u2264 0. Since v0 \u2261 0 and Q\u0302(x, 0) \u2265 0, we are able to conclude that, if v1 has a local\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311 4 of 13\nminimum in \u2126, then this minimum is non-negative. On the other hand, if this minimum does not occur in \u2126, we have that there exists a subset \u2202\u2126\u22121 \u2286 \u2202\u2126, such that [21,22]\ninf \u2202\u2126 v1 = inf \u2202\u2126\u22121 v1 = inf \u2126 v1 (8)\nOn the subset \u2202\u2126\u22121 \u2286 \u2202\u2126, from the boundary condition, we have\n\u2212\u2207v1\u00b7n = \u03b1v1 \u2212 \u03b1v0 + F\u0302(x, v0) \u2265 0 on \u2202\u2126\u22121 (9)\nTherefore, since F\u0302(x, 0) \u2264 0, we conclude that v1 is non-negative everywhere. Therefore, v1 \u2265 v0 \u2261 0.\nFrom Equation (5), we may write\n\u2206(vi+1 \u2212 vi)\u2212 c(vi+1 \u2212 vi) + si \u2212 si\u22121 = 0 in \u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . \u2212\u2207(vi+1 \u2212 vi)\u00b7n = \u03b1(vi+1 \u2212 vi)\u2212 (\u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3i\u22121) on \u2202\u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . si \u2212 si\u22121 = c(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + ( Q\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) ) \u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3i\u22121 = \u03b1(vi \u2212 vi\u22121)\u2212 ( F\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 F\u0302(x, vi\u22121)\n) v0 = 0 on \u2202\u2126\n(10)\nCombining Equation (10) with Equation (6), we conclude that, if vi \u2265 vi\u22121 everywhere, then\n\u2206(vi+1 \u2212 vi) \u2264 0 in \u2126 (11)\nand vi+1 \u2212 vi does not reach a minimum in \u2126. Again, using Equation (6) and taking into account the boundary conditions, we conclude that\nvi \u2265 vi\u22121 in \u2126 \u21d2 inf \u2202\u2126 (vi+1 \u2212 vi) = inf \u2126 (vi+1 \u2212 vi) \u2265 0 (12)\nSince v1 \u2265 v0 in \u2126, the above result enables us to conclude (non-decreasing sequence) that\n. . . vi \u2265 vi\u22121 \u2265 . . . v2 \u2265 v1 \u2265 0 in \u2126 (13)\n3. An Upper Bound for the Sequence\nThe solution of Equations (4), denoted by \u03a6, is an upper bound for the elements of the sequence [v1, v2, v3 . . .]. In order to prove this affirmation, let us combine Equations (4) and (5) to obtain\n\u2206(\u03a6\u2212 vi) + Q(x, \u03a6) + cvi \u2212 cvi\u22121 \u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) = 0 in \u2126 \u2212\u2207(\u03a6\u2212 vi)\u00b7n = F\u0302(x, \u03a6)\u2212 \u03b1vi + \u03b1vi\u22121 \u2212 F\u0302(x, vi\u22121) on \u2202\u2126\n(14)\nor, in a more convenient form,\n\u2206(\u03a6\u2212 vi) + Q(x, \u03a6)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi) + c(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + Q\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) = 0 in \u2126 \u2212\u2207(\u03a6\u2212 vi)\u00b7n = F\u0302(x, \u03a6)\u2212 F\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 \u03b1(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + F\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 F\u0302(x, vi\u22121) on \u2202\u2126\n(15)\nNow, let us suppose that the difference \u03a6\u2212 vi assumes its minimum in \u2126. In this case we must have \u2206(\u03a6\u2212 vi) \u2265 0 in a small neighborhood of the local minimum. Therefore, in this neighborhood, taking into account Equation (6), we have\nQ(x, \u03a6)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi) + c(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + Q\u0302(x, vi)\u2212 Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) \u2264 0 \u21d2 \u03a6 \u2265 vi (16)\nOn the other hand, if \u03a6\u2212 vi does not assume a minimum in \u2126, we must have a subset \u2202\u2126\u2212i , such that\ninf \u2202\u2126 (\u03a6\u2212 vi) = inf \u2202\u2126\u2212i (\u03a6\u2212 vi) = inf \u2126 (\u03a6\u2212 vi) (17)\nand, on this subset, taking into account the boundary conditions and Equation (6),\nF\u0302(x, \u03a6)\u2212 F\u0302(x, vi) \u2265 0 \u21d2 \u03a6 \u2265 vi on \u2202\u2126\u2212i (18)\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311 5 of 13\nThus, it is proven that \u03a6 \u2265 vi in \u2126. Clearly, it must be proven that (4) admits a solution and that \u03a6 \u2261 v\u221e. In the next section, with the aid of a variational formulation, we prove that the solution \u03a6 exists and is unique.\nSince (from Equation (5))\n\u2206vi \u2212 c(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + Q\u0302(x, vi\u22121) = 0 in \u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . \u2212\u2207vi\u00b7n = \u03b1(vi \u2212 vi\u22121) + F\u0302(x, vi\u22121) on \u2202\u2126, i = 1, 2, . . . v0 \u2261 0\n(19)\nwe have that \u2206v\u221e + Q\u0302(x, v\u221e) = 0 in \u2126 \u2212\u2207v\u221e\u00b7n = F\u0302(x, v\u221e) on \u2202\u2126\n(20)\nTherefore, \u03a6 \u2261 v\u221e (the limit of the sequence [v1, v2, v3 . . .] consists of a solution of Problem 4, provided it admits a solution).\n4. Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution of Equation (4)\nThe solution of Equation (4) is the field which minimizes the functional I[\u03b7], defined by\nI[\u03b7] = 12 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207\u03b7|2dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 A\u0302(x, \u03b7)dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 B\u0302(x, \u03b7)dA,\n\u2202 \u2202\u03a6 A\u0302(x, \u03a6) = Q\u0302(x, \u03a6), \u2202 \u2202\u03a6 B\u0302(x, \u03a6) = F\u0302(x, \u03a6)\n(21)\nSince, for any \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), the following inequality holds:\n(1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03b8|\u2207(\u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72)|2 = \u03b8\u2207\u03b71\u00b7\u2207\u03b71 +(1\u2212 \u03b8)\u2207\u03b72\u00b7\u2207\u03b72 \u2212 \u03b82\u2207\u03b71\u00b7\u2207\u03b71 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b8)2\u2207\u03b72\u00b7\u2207\u03b72 \u2212 2\u03b8(1\u2212 \u03b8)\u2207\u03b71\u00b7\u2207\u03b72 \u2265 0\n(22)\nwe ensure that \u03b8 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207\u03b71|2dV + (1\u2212 \u03b8) \u222b \u2126 |\u2207\u03b72|2dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207{\u03b8\u03b71 + (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03b72}|2dV \u2265 0, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) (23)\nIn addition, since the derivative (with respect to \u03a6) of \u2212A\u0302(x, \u03a6) is non-negative and the derivative (with respect to \u03a6) of B\u0302(x, \u03a6) is positive, we may write (convexity of the functional I[\u03b7])\n\u03b8 I[\u03b71] + (1\u2212 \u03b8)I[\u03b72]\u2212 I[\u03b8\u03b71 + (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03b72] \u2265 0, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) (24)\nA necessary condition for ensuring the equality in Equation (22), for two different functions \u03b71 and \u03b72, is \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b72 = constant. Nevertheless, from the definition of B\u0302(x, \u03a6), this constant must be zero for ensuring the equality in (24). Therefore, we conclude that the functional I[\u03b7] is strictly convex. This ensures the uniqueness of the minimum, provided it exists. In order to prove the existence of the minimum, it is sufficient to show that the convex functional I[\u03b7] is such that (coerciveness) [23]\nlim \u03b3\u2192\u221e I[\u03b3\u03b7] \u03b3 = \u221e, \u2016\u03b7\u2016 = 1 (25)\nin which \u2016\u03b7\u2016 is the usual norm of H1(\u2126) [24].\nAxioms 2022, 11, 311 6 of 13\nTaking into account that \u2016\u03b7\u2016 = 1 and considering the behavior of Q\u0302(x, \u03a6) and of F\u0302(x, \u03a6), the above limit may be represented as follows:\nlim \u03b3\u2192\u221e I[\u03b3\u03b7] \u03b3 = lim\u03b3\u2192\u221e\n{ 1\n2\u03b3 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207\u03b3\u03b7|2dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 A\u0302(x,\u03b3\u03b7) \u03b3 dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 B\u0302(x,\u03b3\u03b7) \u03b3 dA\n}\n= lim \u03b3\u2192\u221e\n{ \u03b3 2 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207\u03b7|2dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u03b7 Q\u0302(x, \u03b3\u03b7)dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 \u03b7 F\u0302(x, \u03b3\u03b7)dA } = \u221e\n(26)\nensuring the coerciveness (solution existence). At this point, it is convenient to show that the minimization of I[\u03b7] corresponds, in a weak sense, to the solution of (4). Aiming to this, based on Equation (21), let us calculate the first variation of I[\u03b7] as follows\n\u03b4I[\u03b7] = \u222b \u2126 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7\u2207\u03b4\u03b7dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 { \u2202 \u2202\u03b7 A\u0302(x, \u03b7) } \u03b4\u03b7dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 { \u2202 \u2202\u03b7 B\u0302(x, \u03b7) } \u03b4\u03b7dA (27)\nor, in a more convenient way, as\n\u03b4I[\u03b7] = \u222b \u2126 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7\u2207\u03b4\u03b7dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 Q\u0302(x, \u03a6)\u03b4\u03b7dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 f\u0302 (x, \u03a6)\u03b4\u03b7dA (28)\nSince [25]\u222b \u2126 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7\u2207\u03b4\u03b7dV = \u222b \u2126 (\u2207\u00b7(\u03b4\u03b7 \u2207\u03b7)\u2212\u2207\u00b7(\u2207\u03b7)\u03b4\u03b7)dV = \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u2207\u00b7(\u2207\u03b7)\u03b4\u03b7dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 \u03b4\u03b7 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7ndA (29)\nwe may write\n\u03b4I[\u03b7] = \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u2207\u00b7(\u2207\u03b7)\u03b4\u03b7dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 \u03b4\u03b7 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7ndA\u2212 \u222b \u2126 Q\u0302(x, \u03b7)\u03b4\u03b7dV + \u222b \u2202\u2126 f\u0302 (x, \u03b7)\u03b4\u03b7dA (30)\nThus, taking into account that \u03b4\u03b7 is arbitrary, \u03b4I[\u03b7] = 0 gives rise to (Euler\u2013Lagrange equation and natural boundary condition)\n\u2207\u00b7(\u2207\u03b7) + Q\u0302(x, \u03b7) = 0 in \u2126 \u2207\u03b7\u00b7n + F\u0302(x, \u03b7) = 0 on \u2202\u2126 (31)\nproving the equivalence between (4) and the minimization of the functional I[\u03b7] (note that \u2207\u00b7\u2207 \u2261 \u2206 \u2261 div(grad) represents the Laplacian). In other words, we have that, in a weak sense, (4) admits one, and only one, solution. In fact, this minimum will belong to H2(\u2126). Since the domain \u2126 belongs to R3 and has the cone property, this minimum will be continuous in \u2126 (Sobolev imbedding theorem [24]). It is natural to ask about the use of I[\u03b7] for reaching the solution \u03a6. Surely, the minimization of I[\u03b7] is a valid and reliable procedure, but, the procedure proposed in this work is also reliable and involves much more simple tools.\n5. Construction of the Solution of Problem 2\nSince k\u0303(T) \u2265 \u03b4 > 0, the knowledge of the elements of the sequence [v1, v2,v3 . . .], as well as its limit, enable us to determine, in a unique way, the elements of the sequence [p1, p2, p3 . . .], as well as its limit. In other words, the knowledge of \u03a6 determines, in a unique way, the solution of Problem 2. The functional relationship between \u03a6 (solution of (4)) and T(solution of (2)) depends on the choice of the function \u0398\u0303(z). There are infinite possible choices.

Conclusions\nThis work provides a powerful and simple tool for simulating any steady-state heat transfer phenomenon and any other process, described by a nonlinear second order partial differential equation such as Equation (2), even when subjected to nonlinear boundary conditions (for instance, arising from thermal radiation heat transfer from/to the body) and involving temperature-dependent source terms (even when this dependence is not linear). The results presented here generalize common situations in which the source term is assumed to be known (i.e., did not depend on the temperature) and where the boundary condition is the classical linear Newton law of cooling. The proposed procedure for constructing the solution may be used together with any numerical scheme available for a linear problem such as Problem 1, making a large class of nonlinear problems accessible to any student (of engineering, physics, or mathematics). An example is presented in Appendix A. The conditions imposed for ensuring the convergence are sufficient conditions, but are not necessary. In other words, the procedure may work even outside of the ensured range. The disadvantage of the proposed procedure is the fact of not knowing the optimal value of the constant \u03b1 (the lower one which ensures convergence). On the other hand, if the convergence is reached for a given \u03b1 = \u03b1, it will be reached for any \u03b1 greater than \u03b1. It is to be noticed that linear problems, in particular those involving linear boundary conditions, admit an equivalent minimum principle represented by a quadratic functional. Nonlinear problems are not equivalent to the minimization of quadratic functionals.\nFunding: This research was funded by [CNPq] grant number [306364/2018-1] and by Brazilian Agency CAPES (finance code 001).
