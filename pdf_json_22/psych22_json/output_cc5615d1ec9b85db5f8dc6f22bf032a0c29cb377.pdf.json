ABSTRACT Objective To explore the psychological, social and financial outcomes of COVID19\u2014and the sociodemographic predictors of those outcomes\u2014among culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Sydney, Australia. Design Crosssectional survey informed by the Framework for Culturally Competent Health Research conducted between March and July 2021. Setting Participants who primarily speak a language other than English at home were recruited from Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales. Participants 708 community members (mean age: 45.4 years (range 18\u201391)). 88% (n=622) were born outside of Australia, 31% (n=220) did not speak English well or at all, and 41% (n=290) had inadequate health literacy. Outcome measures Thirteen items regarding COVID19related psychological, social and financial outcomes were adapted from validated scales, previous surveys or codesigned in partnership with Multicultural Health and interpreter service staff. Logistic regression models (using poststratification weighted frequencies) were used to identify sociodemographic predictors of outcomes. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). Results In this analysis, conducted prior to the 2021 COVID19 outbreak in Sydney, 25% of the sample reported feeling nervous or stressed most/all of the time and 22% felt lonely or alone most/all of the time. A quarter of participants reported negative impacts on their spousal relationships as a result of COVID19 and most parents reported that their children were less active (64%), had more screen time (63%) and were finding school harder (45%). Mean financial burden was 2.9/5 (95% CI 2.8 to 2.9). Regression analyses consistently showed more negative outcomes for those with comorbidities and differences across language groups. Conclusion Culturally and linguistically diverse communities experience significant psychological, social and financial impacts of COVID19. A wholeofgovernment approach is needed to support rapid codesign of culturally safe support packages in response to COVID19 and other national health emergencies, tailored appropriately to specific language groups and accounting for preexisting health disparities.",

People from racial and cultural minority groups in countries across the globe have been disproportionately affected, with higher rates of infection, greater risk of morbidity, higher critical care admissions and mortality, and poorer mental health and financial outcomes.1\u20136 Such differences reflect pre- existing health disparities and underlying social, economic and political inequalities; racial and cultural minority\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 To date, this is the largest Australian survey exploring COVID- 19- related psychological, social and financial outcomes, and the sociodemographic correlates of these outcomes, among people who primarily speak a language other than English. \u21d2 This study was co- designed by researchers, multicultural health and interpreter service staff, in alignment with the Framework of Culturally Competent Health Research and enabled through recruitment methods that are inclusive and reduce barriers to participation (eg, translated surveys; engagement of trusted interpreters and multicultural health staff; use of multiple recruitment methods including through community events and networks). \u21d2 To reduce survey length and burden on participants we purposefully selected a small number of items from validated measures or our previous research to explore psychological, social and financial outcomes or co- designed them specifically for this study. \u21d2 Convenience sampling methods and self- report may have introduced recall and social desirability bias. \u21d2 We are unable to explore changes in COVID- 19- related outcomes over time.\nP atna).

Currently, people living in Australia identify with more than 270 ancestries, with almost seven million people migrating to Australia since 1945.10 In 2020, 29.8% of Australia\u2019s population were born overseas,11 a level that is higher than most countries within the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development.12\nNationally representative Australian surveys exploring the financial, social and psychological impacts of the pandemic13 often systematically exclude culturally and linguistically diverse populations, and there remains a lack of disaggregated data related to COVID- 19. A similar trend is observed worldwide.14 Research to date (both in Australia and internationally) has also been limited in its engagement with diverse communities. This has been exacerbated by online recruitment methods (eg, via social media networks or market research companies) and English- language data collection, which tend to prohibit participation of those who speak a language other than English as their primary language.\nThe few studies which have been conducted have highlighted important impacts of the pandemic for our diverse communities.15 16 In a study of 656 refugees and asylum seekers who had arrived in Australia within the last 10 years (most commonly from Iraq (58.7%, n=385) and Syria (16.9%, n=111)), approximately one in five participants reported experiencing employment loss or decline due to COVID- 19, with prevalent stressors related to COVID- 19 infection including worries about being infected (66.5%), of a loved one being infected (72.1%) or infecting others (47.7%).17 Social stressors as a consequence of the pandemic were also common, including school closures (46.7%), reduced social activities (46.6%) and having to remain at home (41.3%), and these stressors predicted increased depression symptoms and disability outcomes.17\nOur own Australian surveys (and others15 16) have also identified some differences in financial and psychological impacts of COVID- 19 among those who speak a language other than English at home compared with those for whom English is their primary language. A survey of 4362 Australians conducted in April 2020, for example, showed that participants who spoke a language other than English at home rated the financial impact of COVID- 19 as higher, were more likely to feel nervous or stressed as a result of the pandemic and had greater anxiety compared with those who primarily spoke English at home.18 However, 75% of participants in this survey\nwere born in Australia and only 274 (6%) reported that they did not speak English as their main language at home. As such, our previous findings are limited in their ability to inform appropriate and tailored support for Australian communities that are typically understudied and underserved, such as those from different cultural and language groups.\nThere also remain limited data about the sociodemographic predictors of COVID- 19- related psychological, social and financial outcomes in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. A myriad of sociodemographic factors put communities at increased risk for worsened COVID- 19 outcomes. Language barriers, for example, are a well- established driver of inequitable outcomes in healthcare, often arising from worsened patient experience, unmet informational needs and discrimination.19 Further, the population whose main language is not English are also at greater likelihood of having lower socioeconomic status20 and lower health literacy21 among other sociodemographic risk factors which can compound the impact of health emergencies including COVID- 19.\nThe aims of this study were to: 1. Explore the psychological, social and financial impact\nof the COVID- 19 pandemic on culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Greater Western Sydney in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. 2. Examine demographic factors associated with these impacts."

Survey items reported here are those which were included in the current analysis.

The socioeconomic status of the area of residence for each individual was defined based on the Socio- Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD33). IRSAD aligns the statistical local area with a decile ranking, with lower scores indicating greater socioeconomic disadvantage. The IRSAD decile was not available for some participants (n=5), for example, because they had entered digits that did not correspond to a valid Australian postcode. IRSAD decile for these participants was replaced\nBox 1 Application of the Framework for Culturally Competent Health Research22\n\u21d2 Assemble a culturally competent team: The research team included Multicultural Health and Health Care Interpreter Service staff and bilingual community members from estern Sydney who have extensive experience working with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Many share the language skills and cultural background of community members in Greater Western Sydney.\n\u21d2 Address community need: Outcome measures for this survey study were developed in partnership with Multicultural Health and Health Care Interpreter Service staff as well as bilingual community members to ensure they addressed community needs. This included the selection of broad outcome domains (psychological, social and financial impacts) as well as individual questions. The survey was reviewed by the entire study team as well as all bilingual community members involved in data collection before implementation to ensure relevance, readability and clarity of items for community members. Multicultural Health and Health Care Interpreter Service staff also played a key role in the selection of language groups for this study. The goal was to select groups based on several variables including perceived need and size of the community in Greater Western Sydney, while allowing for diversity in regard to time since migration and English- language proficiency.\n\u21d2 Address health inequities: Multicultural Health and Health Care Interpreter Service staff worked in partnership with researchers to influence decisions about research questions and design as well as interpretation and dissemination of findings. Findings were presented as two- page infographics and disseminated to communities through local networks, as well as in the peerreviewed literature, demonstrating commitment to feeding back the results of the research and enhancing community trust.\n\u21d2 Address differences in power: This study built on enduring partnerships between researchers, health services and multicultural community organisations that have spanned multiple research projects. The goal for this study and others has been to bring together a range of health staff, consumers and researchers to co- create value together from the outset, placing high value on different types of knowledge, particularly the lived experiences of community members and contextually specific knowledge of our health services partners. Wherever feasible, the goal has been to redistribute knowledge- based power and replace it with mutual learning between all participants.\nP atna).

Even prior to the July 2021 COVID- 19 outbreak in NSW, which disproportionately impacted the communities and geographical areas included in this study, we observed broad negative psychological, social and financial impacts of the pandemic. Over a quarter of the sample reported feeling nervous or stressed most or all of the time, and 22% felt lonely or alone most or all of the time. Over half worried about financial problems and reported being somewhat or less able to meet their weekly expenses. A quarter of participants reported negative impacts on their spousal relationship and the majority of participants with children under 18 years reported that even out of lockdown their children spent less time with friends as a result of the pandemic (68.5%), were less physically active (64.2%) and had more screen time (63.3%). Regression analyses consistently showed distinct patterns of COVID- 19 impacts for different language groups and more negative outcomes for those living with chronic illness and comorbidities.\nThe impacts of COVID- 19 have been explored across a number of countries with different population groups. Direct comparisons are difficult on account of varying survey items, different data collection time points, and wide- ranging case numbers, morbidity and mortality from COVID- 19 across geographical contexts. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, studies have spotlighted sociodemographic disparities in outcomes worldwide37 and broad impacts for culturally and linguistically diverse groups.38 A cross- sectional survey among culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Greater Western Sydney (n=198) conducted earlier in the pandemic (August\u2013September 2020), for example, similarly identified financial and social impacts, with 40% of participants indicating that their financial situation and ability to access social services were \u2018worse\u2019 as a result of COVID- 19.38 Our findings build on this by offering further nuance (eg, highlighting associated worry about financial problems) and elucidating a range of other impacts including additional impacts on children. Our study also uniquely showcases differences in outcomes across language groups.\nIn comparing our findings to Australian studies which did not specifically focus on culturally and linguistically diverse communities, we also see some similarities. Nationally representative data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for instance, showed that in June 2021, one in five (20%) Australians experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress in the last 4 weeks, and 28% of people 18 years and over reported feeling nervous in that survey.13 Previous work has also confirmed negative Figure 1 Change in employment.\nP atna).

A multilevel, whole- ofgovernment approach is needed to address these, with policy and sustainable infrastructure to disseminate timely, understandable and culturally appropriate information about financial, social and mental health resources and services and to co- design tailored support packages for different language groups.41 Qualitative studies have highlighted a large number of community- driven initiatives and actions that have emerged as a response to COVID- 19, as well as embodied and communal ways of coping.42 Using a strengths- based perspective, we must acknowledge the multiple capacities and resources of our culturally and linguistically diverse communities and provide properly resourced opportunities to work directly with them to address unique challenges that they face, as identified in this study.

This approach wholly aligns with the Framework of Culturally Competent Health Research.22 However, practical constraints limited the number of languages we could include, and restricted data collection to three regions in Greater Sydney only. We also used convenience sampling methods.\nTo reduce survey length and burden on participants we purposefully selected a small number of items from validated measures or our previous research to explore psychological, social and financial impacts, or co- designed them specifically for this study. Self- report may have introduced recall and social desirability bias.\nFinally, the results of this study reflect a particular point in time when there were very low numbers of communityacquired cases of COVID- 19 in Australia, and for the most part, no government- imposed restrictions on movement and activities in NSW. It is likely that psychological well- being outcomes and financial and social stress worsened after the July 2021 outbreak and the imposition of\nstay- at- home orders, in line with previous research.39 43 We are unable to explore changes in impacts over time in this study."
