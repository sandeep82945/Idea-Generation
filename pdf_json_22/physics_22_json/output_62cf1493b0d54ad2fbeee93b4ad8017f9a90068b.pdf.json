By applying a charge current to NM with strong spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), a spin current is induced in perpendicular to the charge current, resulting from the bulk spin Hall effect (SHE)1). At the interface of the bilayers, the spin current via the SHE gives rise to a spin accumulation, which causes the SOT acting on the magnetization in FM layer2). Since the SOT is a powerful way to switch the magnetization3\u20136), it is desirable to enhance the\nefficiency of SOT generation. While much effort so far has been done on 5d transition metals with large SHE, e.g., Pt4,7\u201315), Ta3,7,9,14,16\u201319, and W5,20), exploring other material systems that exhibit\nhighly-efficient SOT generation constitutes an important challenge towards spintronic application.\nRecently, 5d transition-metal oxides have emerged as a class of spintronic materials due to their unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong SOC21). The 5d oxides contrast well with the 5d transition metals of which the electronic structure is dominated by 6s electrons as well as 5d electrons. Ir oxides out of the 5d oxides become a potential platform as spintronic compounds; several groups have reported SOT generation in amorphous IrO222,23), epitaxial IrO224), and epitaxial SrIrO3 (SIO)25\u201329). Among them, particularly interesting is the epitaxial SIO25\u201329). Epitaxial strain induced by substrate plays a crucial role in stabilizing SIO with the perovskite structure, whereas the bulk perovskite SIO30) is synthesized only under a highpressure condition. The epitaxial strain also allows control of the crystal symmetry and hence the electronic structure of SIO; it strongly affects the SOT generation through SOC31,32). Substrate choice could be therefore one of the factors for highly-efficient SOT generation, while this is not the case with non-epitaxial IrO222,23) or 5d transition metals3\u201320. In the previous research on the SOT generation in SIO, SrTiO3 (STO)25,27\u201329) and (LaAlO3)0.3(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.7 (LSAT)26) substrates have been used so far. We here focus on DyScO3 (DSO) as another choice of substrate in order to clarify a spintronic characteristic of bulk SIO; the lattice constants of DSO are much closer to those of SIO than those of STO and LSAT substrates. Moreover, an orthorhombic structure of DSO enables us to deposit orthorhombic SIO films. A prior study25) has shown the importance of orthorhombic SIO, which generates the larger SOT compared with that of tetragonal one. Investigating the SIO grown on the DSO is therefore expected to provide further experimental insight into relationship between the crystal structure and the SOT generation.\nIn this Letter, we report on highly-efficient SOT generation in SIO epitaxially grown on\nDSO substrate that minimizes the strain effect, in contrast to the above-mentioned substrates. We estimate the SOT with dampinglike (DL) and fieldlike (FL) symmetries in Co20Fe60B20 (CoFeB)/SIO bilayers and those in Pt control sample, by performing harmonic Hall measurement. The observed DL SOT in SIO is more than three times of that in Pt. In both SIO and Pt, the FL SOT is about the one-third of the DL SOT. The DL SOT efficiency DL is independent of the CoFeB thickness, revealing negligible spin current generation from the CoFeB layer. These results emphasize that the strong SOC of the 5d electrons plays an important role in the large SOT generation in the epitaxial SIO.\nThe SIO films were grown on DSO substrate by a pulsed laser deposition from ceramic\nSIO target using a KrF excimer laser ( = 248 nm) at 5 Hz. In the bulk form, SIO and DSO exhibit an orthorhombic GdFeO3 type perovskite structure, of which the pseudocubic lattice parameter apc are ~0.3950 nm30) and ~0.3940 nm33), respectively. This lattice mismatch of ~0.3% is small compared to that of ~0.9% for STO and ~2.1% for LSAT substrates; we can expect that coherent epitaxial growth of SIO on the DSO(110)O substrate is easily realized. Substrate temperature and oxygen pressure during the deposition were 650 \u030aC and 25 Pa, respectively. The crystalline quality and thickness of the SIO films were confirmed by x-ray diffraction measurement. Figure 1(a) shows the 2- scan in the SIO grown on DSO(110)O substrate. The film and substrate peaks are represented by the pseudocubic and orthorhombic indexed as (hkl)C and (hkl)O, respectively. We find two significant peaks (001)C and (002)C of the SIO film corresponding to DSO orientations without any impurity peaks, indicating that single-phase SIO film is epitaxially grown. Figure 1(b) is the magnified view of Fig. 1(a), showing the peaks of the SIO(002)c film and the DSO(110)o substrate. The SIO(002)C peak gives the out-of-plane lattice constant of 0.3955 nm, which is in good agreement with reported values33\u201335). The clear oscillation stemming from thickness evidences a good crystallinity of the film, which is also supported by narrow full width at half maximum of the rocking curve around the SIO(002)c (~0.05 deg.). From the oscillation, we determined the film thickness to be 21 nm. Figure 1(c) exemplifies the reciprocal space mapping, which represents the horizontal axis and vertical axis corresponding to the SIO(010)C [or DSO(001)O] and SIO(001)C [or DSO(110)O], respectively. We also conducted the reciprocal space mapping containing the SIO(100)C axis [or the axis perpendicular to the DSO(110)O and (001)O]. These results clearly show that the film is coherently strained, indicating the SIO grown on the DSO substrate has orthorhombic structure. Hence, all the diffraction data illustrates that the high-quality orthorhombic SIO film is epitaxially grown on the DSO(110)o substrate.\nIn order to evaluate SOT in SIO, we prepare bilayers consisting of epitaxial SIO and\nferromagnetic CoFeB. The whole film structures are represented by\nTaOx(2.5)/CoFeB(tCoFeB)/SIO(21), where the number in parenthesis indicates the thickness in nanometer [Fig. 2(a)]. After the SIO growth, Ta and CoFeB were deposited ex situ by a radio-\nfrequency magnetron sputtering at Ar deposition pressure of 0.3 Pa. The TaOx layer is obtained from the as-deposited Ta metal by natural oxidation in the air; it prevents the CoFeB layer from\nbeing oxidized. We also confirmed that no SOT contribution from the TaOx layer is found by performing control experiment. The CoFeB thickness tCoFeB ranges from 2 to 6 nm. The CoFeB and TaOx thickness were estimated from growth rate of each layer determined by x-ray reflectivity measurement beforehand. Considering that Pt has been known to generate large SOT, we also\nprepare a Pt control sample in situ, that is, TaOx(2.5)/CoFeB(2)/Pt(5) on thermally oxidized Si substrate. The CoFeB/SIO and CoFeB/Pt bilayers were fabricated into a Hall bar with two arms\nby photolithography and Ar ion milling. Ta(5)/Pt(60) contact pads were attached at the end of\ndevices for electrical measurement. The Hall bar has channel dimensions of 30 m length (L) and\n10 m width (w), as shown in Fig. 2(a). The represents the azimuthal angles of the external\nmagnetic field (Bext). We apply an ac current \ud835\udc3cac = \u221a2\ud835\udc3crms sin(2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61) with root mean square of current Irms in the x axis direction and frequency f = 13 Hz. We set Irms to be 0.4 mA for longitudinal resistance (R) measurement in x-axis direction, and 1 mA for Hall resistance (RH) measurement and 1.5 mA for harmonic Hall measurement in the y-axis directions. The\nresistivity () of SIO and CoFeB are 570 and 190 cm, respectively, obtained from the linear\nfit on the tCoFeB versus the inverse sheet R as displayed in Fig. 2(b); the fitting procedure was performed only for CoFeB(3,4,5)/SIO(21) with common SIO thickness since the SIO thickness\nslightly changes with the bilayer films, i.e., 23 nm for CoFeB(2), 21 nm for CoFeB(3,4,5), and\n20 nm for CoFeB(6). The obtained resistivities of the CoFeB and SIO layers well reproduce the\nresistance for CoFeB(2)/SIO(23) and CoFeB(6)/SIO(20) with different SIO thickness, suggesting\nthe consistency of the whole resistance data.\nWe evaluate the SOT by conducting harmonic Hall measurement7,9,13\u201316,18,19\u201323,26\u201329) By\napplying the Iac to the Hall bar, the SOT is induced at FM/NM interface, which has two components with different symmetries, namely, DL and FL SOTs. These SOTs correspond to DL\neffective field BDL\u2225(\u00d7 m) and FL effective field BFL\u2225, where m and  is the direction of the magnetization and accumulated spin polarization; the latter is along the y-axis direction. Of these two SOTs, the DL SOT is most relevant to the magnetization switching.3\u20136). In order to distinguish\nthe BDL and BFL, the harmonic Hall measurements were performed by measuring an angle dependence of first and second harmonic resistance (RH 1, RH 2) at fixed Bext in xy plane; the applied Bext varies 0.1 to 1.2 T. The RH1 corresponds to the conventional dc Hall measurement, while the RH2 reflects the influence of SOT. These obey the following Eq. (1), (2)7,14,19,22,23,26\u201329).\nRH 1\u03c9 = RPHE sin 2\u03d5 (1)\nRH 2\u03c9 = \u2212 (RAHE\nBDL\nBext+Bk +R\u2207T) cos \u03d5 +2RPHE\nBFL+BOe\nBext (2 cos3 \u03d5 \u2212 cos \u03d5) (2)\n\u2261 \u2212R DL+\u2207T cos \u03d5 +RFL+Oe(2 cos\n3 \u03d5 \u2212 cos \u03d5)# (3)\nHere, RPHE, RAHE, Bk, \ud835\udc45\u2207\ud835\udc47 , and BOe correspond to planar Hall resistance, anomalous Hall resistance, out-of-plane anisotropy field, thermal induced second-harmonic resistance driven by a temperature gradient, e.g. the anomalous Nernst effect36) and spin Seebeck effect37), and current\ninduced Oersted field, respectively. RAHE and Bk were estimated by Hall resistance depending on the out-of-plane Bext. The upper panel of Fig. 2(c) shows the RH1as a function of . The RH1 slightly deviates from Eq. (1), which is attributed to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) resulting from a small sample misalignment(7). Since we confirmed that this AHE contribution has negligible effects on estimate of RPHE, we determined the RPHE from Eq. (1). The dependence of RH 2 is induced by the small modulation of the magnetization from its equilibrium position due to the\ncurrent-driven SOTs. We can define the BDL contribution (RDL+\u2207T) and the BFL contribution (RFL+Oe) as the coefficients of the cos and (2cos3 \u2212 cos) in Eq. (3). The bottom panel of the\nFig.2 (c) shows the RH 2 of CoFeB(6)/SIO(21) measured at 0.1 and 1 T, which is well fitted by Eq. (2). The difference in amplitude of the RH 2 depending on the Bext indicates the suppression of SOTs by the Bext. We estimated the RDL+\u2207T and RFL+Oe from the RH 2 fitting, which is displayed in the top panel and the bottom panel in Fig. 2(d), respectively. Figure 2(d) indicates the large RDL+\u2207T contribution and the small RFL+Oe contribution to the RH 2 in CoFeB/SIO bilayers.\nThen we extract two SOT effective fields BDL and BFL through the coefficients RDL+\u2207T\nand RFL+Oe. Figure 3(a) and 3(b) show the RDL+\u2207T for CoFeB(2)/SIO(21) and CoFeB(2)/Pt(5). The data indicates linear dependence on 1/(Bext + Bk) in accordance with Eq. (3). The data points in the low-field region deviate from the linear fitting, possibly due to unsaturated in-plane\nmagnetization. The slopes and intercepts of the RDL+\u2207T correspond to the BDL and the R\u2207T , respectively. We estimated the DL effective field per current density BDL/J, where J is the applied charge current density flowing in the SIO (Pt) layer. The estimated BDL/J is +4.3 mT/(1011Am-2) for CoFeB(2)/SIO and +1.1 mT/(1011Am-2) for CoFeB(2)/Pt, suggesting the sizable DL SOT\ngeneration in CoFeB/SIO as well as in CoFeB/Pt. The R\u2207T of CoFeB/SIO is much larger than CoFeB/Pt. The temperature gradient in CoFeB/SIO is larger compared with CoFeB/Pt due to the\nhigher resistivity of SIO than that of Pt, resulting in the large R\u2207T . The RFL+Oe for CoFeB(2)/SIO(21) and CoFeB(2)/Pt(5) are plotted as a function of 1/Bext as shown in Fig. 3(c) and 3(d). The RFL+Oe for CoFeB(2)/Pt(5) has linear dependence on 1/Bext, which is well explained by Eq. (3), while we assume the (BFL + BOe) ~ 0 for CoFeB(2)/SIO(21) since the linear fit is impractical because of its large error. The BFL were obtained by subtracting the BOe contribution estimated by Ampere\u2019s law as BOe = 0JdSIO/2, where 0 is the magnetic permeability in a vacuum. The BFL/J for CoFeB(2)/Pt and CoFeB(2)/SIO are +4.1 \u00d7 10\u22121 and +1.4 mT/(1011Am\u22122), respectively, similar to previous values in CoFeB/Pt bilayer15) and Py/SIO bilayers26) performed\nby harmonic Hall measurement. In the following, we only focus on the BDL since the FL component in CoFeB/SIO includes the experimental uncertainty in its absolute value.\nIn order to further discuss the SOT, we evaluate the DL from the BDL/J using following\nEq. (4)38):\n\u03beDL= 2e\u03bc 0 MstCoFeB\n\u210f\nBDL\nJ (4)\nwhere e, Ms, and \u0127 are the elementary charge, the saturation magnetization, and the Dirac constant, respectively. The Ms for CoFeB/SIO and CoFeB/Pt are 1.1 \u00d7 106 and 1.3 \u00d7 106 A/m, respectively, measured by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer, in agreement with those for typical CoFeB thin film3,14,16,17,19). We obtain DL = +0.32 for SIO and +0.093 for Pt at tCoFeB = 2 nm as shown in Fig. 4, showing that the DL for SIO is around three times larger than that for Pt. Note that our result of DL = +0.093 for Pt is consistent with the reported\nvalues4,7,8,10,11,13,15), demonstrating validity of our experimental setup. We also consider that the\nDL is saturated due to the large NM layer thickness sufficiently above the spin-diffusion length, i.e., ~1.7 nm for SIO25) and ~1.4 nm for Pt11). Here, we refer that recent studies point out spin current generation stemming from the AHE and/or SHE in FM layer39\u201342). In order to clarify the\nissue, the DL as a function of the tCoFeB is displayed in Fig. 4. The DL shows no appreciable dependence on the tCoFeB, suggesting negligible spin current contribution in the CoFeB layer; this evidence highlights that the obtained DL are truly derived from the SIO layer. Note that we confirmed that the DL is independent of current direction relative to crystallographic directions; this might be attributed to the small in-plane crystalline anisotropy of the SIO due to the DSO\nsubstrate with a tiny in-plane anisotropy (~0.1 %).\nAs found in the previous studies, the DL of the SIO ranges from +0.2 to +1.1 for the\nthick SIO layers25\u201329); these studies are performed in bilayers with different FM layers such as metals and oxides, indicating that the interfacial condition would influence the estimation of the DL. With the factor in mind, our result is consistent with the previous studies. The observed large DL of +0.32 for SIO on DSO substrate reinforces the validity of SIO as the spintronic material considering that the lattice constants of our SIO films are very close to those of bulk SIO. This large SOT generation is also compatible with the importance of the orthorhombicity of the SIO reported in the previous study25). Our findings would be an important step to clarify the charge to spin current conversion in epitaxial 5d oxide thin films, which show a variety of intriguing physical properties: Dirac nodal line43), spin-orbit driven semimetal-Mott insulator transition44,45), and non-linear planar Hall effect46). By incorporating these properties, further studies on spintronics using SIO are motivated.\nIn conclusion, we studied the SOT generation in CoFeB/SIO bilayers, where the SIO\nlayer is epitaxially grown on DSO substrate. By performing the harmonic Hall measurement in\nCoFeB/SIO bilayers, we estimated that the DL of the SIO is around three times larger than that of the Pt control sample. Further investigation shows little dependence of the CoFeB thickness on\nthe DL (0.32\u20130.36) and hence negligible contribution of the SOT from the CoFeB layer. Our findings indicate highly-efficient SOT generation in the SIO layer, which may be utilized for\nmagnetic tunnel junction device driven by SOT switching based on 5d transition metal oxides.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors thank T.

Peaks of the SIO(001)C and (002)C are located in the vicinity of the corresponding DSO(110)O and (220)O peaks. Note that the film and substrate peaks are indexed as cubic (002)C and orthorhombic (220)O, respectively. (b) Magnified view of the scan around SIO(002)C reflection in (a). (c) Reciprocal space mapping of (001)C oriented SIO film epitaxially grown on the corresponding DSO orientation.\nthe azimuthal angles of the external magnetic field (Bext). AC current is applied along the x axis direction to detect Hall resistance (RH) in the y axis direction. (b) The inverse sheet resistance 1/R\u2219L/w as a function of tCoFeB. The sold line represents a linear fit for tCoFeB = 2, 3, and 4 nm. (c) RH 1and RH 2of CoFeB(6)/SIO(21) measured at 0.1 and 1 T. The solid curves of RH 1 and RH 2 are fits to the data using Eq. (1, 2). (d) RH 2 are separated to cos and (2cos3\u2013cos) components from the fittings, which indicate DL contribution and FL contribution, respectively."
