    "abstractText": "The advent of two-dimensional (2D) crystals has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs. Conventional 2D systems have in-plane covalent bonds and a weak out-of-plane van-der-Waals bond. Here we report a new type of 2D material composed of discrete magnetic molecules, where anisotropic van-der-Waals interactions bond the molecules into a 2D packing. Through mechanical exfoliation, we can obtain single-crystalline molecular monolayers, which can be readily integrated into other 2D systems. Optical spectroscopy suggests the few-layered molecules preserve the temperature-induced spin-crossover switching observed in the bulk form but show a drastic increase in thermal hysteresis unique to these thin 2D molecule assemblies. The trapping of spin bistability with decreasing layer number can arise from domain wall dynamics in reduced dimensions. Our results establish molecular solids with strong anisotropy of intermolecular interactions as precursors to a new class of 2D materials, affording possibilities to control molecular functionalities through substrate and interlayer interactions.",

A wide range of inorganic atomic 2D crystals3\u20135 with drastically different physical properties have been investigated, revealing intriguing emergent phenomena at the few-layer and monolayer limits. Interlayer interactions allow additional functionality control to be achieved by stacking and twisting of homo- and hetero-layers of 2D crystals1,6\u20138. The search for molecular analogs of these 2D inorganic crystals, which provide precise chemical tunability, has attracted much attention in recent years9\u201318. Discrete molecules provide a diverse range of functionalities that can be tuned through synthetic modifications. In particular, spin-active molecules have been explored extensively in recent years vis-\u00e0-vis their potential applications in spintronic devices19,20 and quantum information science21\u201323. Such molecular materials are conventionally considered as 0D systems with weak intermolecular interactions. Selfassembled molecular monolayers24 are well established, but they assemble on specific substrates and typically exhibit molecular packing that differs from that of the bulk molecular crystals. Regular 2D single-crystalline packing of discrete molecules is particularly desirable because it provides homogeneity in molecular orientation and physical properties, but the experimental realization of such packing in the case of non-planar molecules has been challenging. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of 2D crystals of [Fe(tBu2qsal)2] (FTBQS) spin-crossover (SCO) molecular assemblies25 down to the monolayer thickness. The molecular design of FTBQS is asymmetric, leading to a layered 2D molecular packing with strong \u03c0-\u03c0 and \u03c3-\u03c0 van der Waals bonding for the inplane direction and weak van der Waals interactions along the out-of-plane direction25 (Fig. 1a, b). Mechanical exfoliation is used to thin down the molecule layer number while preserving the\nsame single-crystalline structure as that in the bulk crystals. With decreasing layer number, we observed an evident increase in the width of SCO transition thermal hysteresis from white light reflection contrast spectroscopy, implying the important roles of molecule-substrate interactions and dimensionality reduction."

            "text": "Thin-film sample fabrication The [Fe(tBu2qsal)2] (FTBQS) complex25, where tBu2qsal\u2013 is a deprotonated form of 2,4-diterbutyl-6-((quinoline-8-ylimino) methyl)phenol (tBu2qsalH), crystallizes as a solvent-free molecular material in the monoclinic space group P21/c (Fig. 1a). Molecular layers are formed parallel to the (100) plane (the x-y plane in Fig. 1b) due to efficient \u03c0-\u03c0 and \u03c3-\u03c0 interactions between the quinoline fragments of the FTBQS molecules. while in the out-ofplane direction (the z-axis in Fig. 1b) these layers are coupled by weak van der Waal interactions between the tBu group. The Fe(II) ions of this complex have been shown to exhibit spin bistability, undergoing SCO transition between the high-spin (HS, paramagnetic S= 2) and low-spin (LS, diamagnetic S= 0) states, as schematically shown in Fig. 4a. With decreasing temperature, the FTBQS bulk crystal undergoes the first-order HS \u2192 LS transition at 117 K and the reverse LS \u2192 HS transition at 129 K during the warmup process25. These transitions are accompanied by abrupt changes in the unit cell size due to the large difference in the average metal-to-ligand bond lengths between the LS state (1.949(2) \u00c5 for Fe\u2013N bonds and 1.945(1) \u00c5 for Fe\u2013O bonds) and the HS state (2.167(2) \u00c5 and 1.997(1) \u00c5, respectively). Mechanical exfoliation of the FTBQS bulk crystals is performed with the well-established Scotch tape method conventionally used in 2D atomic crystals fabrication. The (100) plane of the bulk single crystal is attached to the tape and deposited onto either Si/SiO2 substrates or fused silica substrates. The exfoliated flakes are identified under an optical microscope through their white light\n1Department of Physics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. 2Department of Chemistry, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA. 3Department of Physics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA. \u2709email: shatruk@chem.fsu.edu; xxzhang@ufl.edu\nwww.nature.com/npj2dmaterials\nPublished in partnership with FCT NOVA with the support of E-MRS\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () :,;\ncolor contrast and subsequently examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the flake thickness and molecular layer numbers. The single-layer thickness is measured to be ~1.7 nm, in good agreement with the value of 1.8 nm estimated from the lattice constants (see Fig. S1 for multi-step layer height profile). As shown in Fig. 1d, we obtained exfoliated molecular layers down to the monolayer thickness (Fig. 1d). We note that the monolayer flake cannot be visually identified (on substrates of 280 nm SiO2/Si, fused silica and PDMS) under the white light microscope, which is likely due to the lack of optical contrast with the material\u2019s dielectric function and the substrate interference. As shown in Fig. 1c, the lateral size of the exfoliated flakes ranges from a few microns to tens of microns, consistent with the sizes of the conventionally obtained 2D inorganic crystals. Thus, while the \u03c0-\u03c0 and \u03c3-\u03c0 intermolecular interactions within the layer are noncovalent in nature, it is the higher strength of these interactions, as compared to the very weak van der Waals forces between the layers, that allows the exfoliation of the ultrathin crystalline flakes of these molecular solids. These exfoliated molecular flakes can be readily integrated with other 2D systems. Figure 1e shows an example heterostructure of few-layer FTBQS and a monolayer MoS2 built by dry transfer technique (see Method), which demonstrates the potential of building deterministic organicinorganic hybrid heterostructures with van der Waals molecules. To verify the material\u2019s chemical stability at the few-layer limit,\nwe measured the Raman spectroscopy as a function of the layer\nnumbers. Figure 2a shows the Raman spectra of samples of different thicknesses under the same experimental conditions (see Methods). The spectra are shifted vertically for clarity and rescaled in intensity for comparison. The plotted high-frequency range (>1000 cm\u22121) in Fig. 2a has the strongest Raman signals and corresponds to vibrations of the ligands, and the full frequency range Raman spectrum shows a good agreement with the calculated Raman response for this complex, as discussed in the Supplementary Information. Compared to the thick flakes (~30 L) that can be approximated as bulk crystals, the Raman spectrum from the monolayer sample shows peak linewidths\u2019 broadening, relative intensity shift, and slight peak position shifts of up to 4 cm\u20131. These Raman signal changes in the thin layer samples may be attributed to the sample degradation due to laser illumination or interactions between molecules and the substrate, which will require further theoretical investigation. The overall consistency in Raman features in samples of different thicknesses indicates that the molecular structure of these mechanically exfoliated flakes remains stable down to the monolayer limit. These exfoliated molecular layers also showed no significant degradation under ambient environment, as inferred from the Raman and AFM measurements (see Supplementary Note 2)."

In the thin-film limit, the absorption is proportional to the white light reflection contrast spectrum through the Kramers-Kronig relations26. Figure 2b shows the room-temperature reflection contrast spectra for samples on transparent fused silica substrates. The main absorption feature, located at ~2.3 eV, is assigned to a combination of the d-d transition at the Fe(II) site and the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). We also observed weak PL, consistent with the optical absorption feature, as shown in Fig. S3. With decreasing layer number, the absorption amplitude decreased but with no obvious spectral change. This observation implies no significant layer dependence in the material\u2019s electronic structure, consistent with our expectations for these weakly interacting molecular complexes. To further probe the spin bistability of the FTBQS flakes of different thicknesses, we have investigated the temperature dependence of their optical absorption. The HS\u2194 LS transition leads to abrupt changes in the lattice constants, giving rise to substantial differences in the absorption amplitudes of the characteristic d-d and MLCT optical absorption bands (see Supplementary Note 4), and such optical approach has been used to monitor spin transition in other SCO molecules27\u201330. We first show the variation of bulk crystals\u2019 visible range absorption spectra during the warmup process at the rate of 3 K/min (Fig. 3a). The observed spectral differences between the HS state (red) and LS state (blue) can be qualitatively reproduced from calculations of the material\u2019s absorption coefficients (see Supplementary Note 4). Figure 3e is the corresponding absorption amplitude measured at 535 nm (~2.32 eV) in a thermal cycle, and we can infer the HS\u2194 LS transition from the absorption amplitude change. The measured transition temperature and thermal hysteresis are consistent with previous XRD and magnetic susceptibility measurements25 in bulk crystals, confirming our assignment through optical spectroscopy. Here we use the absorption amplitude to trace the SCO transition to be consistent with the analysis in exfoliated thin flakes, where the spectral peak feature changes are harder to identify due to the weaker absorption signal and possible interlayer interactions (see the paragraph below). We note that the transition temperatures extracted here correspond to the cryostat thermal bath and can differ from the actual sample temperatures by a few Kelvins. A strong dependence of the spin transition temperatures on the number of molecular layers has been observed in the exfoliated samples. Figure 3b\u2013d shows the reflection contrast (proportional to absorption in this experimental condition) spectra for 13, 10, and 5 L samples taken at 0.3-0.5 K/min, and Fig. 3f\u2013h are the\ncorresponding absorption amplitudes at 535 nm. The measured temperature range is 85-300 K to avoid possible complications from light-induced SCO at lower temperatures27,31. At ~85 K, i.e., below the bulk spin transition temperature, the spectra from these few-layer samples showed an obvious increase in the absorption amplitude at 535 nm (~2.32 eV) and an additional optical feature near 2.8 eV, which are similar to the observed LS spectrum in the bulk sample and indicative of the transition to the LS state. However, the absorption spectra changes in the exfoliated samples were more subtle than those in the bulk, especially at regions around 1.8 eV, which can arise from modifications of interlayer interactions. In addition, the HS\u2192LS conversion during the cooldown was more gradual when compared to the bulk. These differences may result from the possible coexistence of HS and LS states in exfoliated samples, which has been reported in amorphous or polycrystalline SCO thin films grown by solution or vapor-phase deposition32. In contrast, the reverse LS\u2192HS transition was much better defined by the abrupt absorption amplitude decrease during the warmup (see Fig. 3f\u2013h grayed areas). The extracted LS\u2192HS transition temperatures TLS\u2192HS are plotted as a function of layer numbers in Fig. 3j, showing a ~170 K increase from the bulk transition temperature when the bulk crystal is thinned down to a few layers. In particular, the transition in the 5 L sample is only achieved after an additional hour of wait time at room temperature. Data obtained from multiple thermal cycles are consistent and the thickness dependence of the warm up LS\u2192HS transition is summarized in Fig. 4b. We also varied the temperature change rate down to 0.1 K/min in several measurements and did not observe any obvious differences compared to the data presented in Figs. 3 and 4. Thus, our results reproducibly demonstrate a drastic increase in the TLS\u2192HS and the remarkable broadening of thermal hysteresis in thin exfoliated samples."

The HS\u2194 LS transition hear is known to lead to substantial unit cell parameter changes25. Because the exfoliated few-layer samples are conformed to the substrates, the system needs to overcome additional substrate strain33 during the spin state switching. Thinner samples have a higher surface-to-volume ratio, leading to stronger strain confinement from the substrate. We, therefore, expect an increase in the HS and LS transition energy barrier for\nFig. 2 Raman and reflection contrast spectroscopies of exfoliated FTBQS samples. a Raman spectra as a function of the layer number of samples. 532 nm laser was used as the excitation source.

On the other hand, the dimensionality reduction can also modify this first-order phase transition34. When considering the phase transition kinetics, the nucleation and growth of a new phase will be distinctly different for samples with stronger 2D confinement, where the phase domain walls will be 1D. The reduction in the available domain propagation phase space in 2D samples may also lead to significantly longer transition times35 and contribute to the observed large thermal hysteresis. While most SCO thin films have been reported to have reduced spin-switching cooperativity and smaller thermal hysteresis32, we note that the single-crystalline nature of the investigated ultrathin samples ensures much lower densities of crystal imperfections compared to the conventionally studied amorphous and polycrystalline SCO films. As the SCO transitions are expected to preferentially nucleate at defect and surface sites36,37, the exfoliated layers can still preserve cooperativity at the few-layer limit. A comprehensive picture will still require further theoretical investigation. In conclusion, we obtained the single-crystalline, 2D FTBQS molecular layers at few-layer and monolayer thickness using the mechanical exfoliation method. The molecules remain intact, showing consistent Raman signals and absorption down to the monolayer. The SCO transition, on the other hand, shows a drastic thickness dependence as revealed by reflection-contrast spectroscopy: as the layer number decrease, the thermal hysteresis range increases more than 100 K. It demonstrates the efficient tuning of the molecules\u2019 magnetic properties through layer number and substrate interactions and is of fundamental importance to understand the SCO processes in 2D. Our findings establish a paradigm for the preparation of molecular 2D materials, which can be readily integrated into 2D spintronic devices15,17 to incorporate such molecular properties as spin bistability. Through different molecular designs, additional functionalities are also possible with this type of van der Waals molecule-based materials to allow 2D integration of other magnetic molecules, such as arrays of singlemolecule magnets or molecular spin qubits.\nMETHODS Growth of FTBQS bulk crystal The procedure to synthesize the single crystal of [Fe(tBu2qsal)2] used for mechanical exfoliation is similar to that described in the previous work25. Iron(II) perchlorate hexahydrate (98%), triethylamine (Et3N) (99%), and formic acid (98%) were obtained from Millipore Sigma, 8-aminoquinoline (>97%) from Matrix Scientific, and 3,5- ditertbutylsalicylaldehyde (>98%) from TCI. All reagents were used as received. Methanol and acetonitrile (MeCN) were obtained as anhydrous HPLC grade solvents from Millipore Sigma. Anhydrous MeCN was further purified by passing through a system of double-drying columns packed with activated alumina and molecular sieves (Pure Process Technologies). Anhydrous acetone (Me2CO) was obtained from Acros Organics. Elemental analysis was performed by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. (Norcross, GA, USA). 8-aminoquinoline (0.72 g, 5 mmol) and 3,5-ditertbutylsalicylaldehyde (1.17 g, 5 mmol) were placed in a round bottom flask. 29.5 mL of MeOH and 3 drops of formic acid were added, and the solution was stirred for 1 h under reflux. The orange solid that precipitated was isolated by filtration, washed with small amount of MeOH, and dried by suction. Yield= 0.82 g (45.6%). The reaction was performed under nitrogen using standard Schlenk techniques. A solution of Fe(ClO4)2\u00b76H2O (272mg, 0.75 mmol) in 15 mL of MeCN was added to a solution of tBu2qsalH (540 mg, 1.5 mmol) and Et3N (209 \u03bcL, 1.5 mmol) in 10mL of Me2CO, and the mixture was left undisturbed. Big plate-\nshaped dark-green crystals that formed after 1 day were recovered by filtration, washed with a small amount of acetone, and dried by suction. Yield= 452mg (77.8 %). Elem. analysis: Calcd.

The studied heterostructure is composed of FTBQS, and MoS2. The MoS2 (hq graphene) were exfoliated from their bulk crystal onto transparent elastomer stamps (poly dimethyl siloxane, PDMS). The heterostructure was then assembled by the layer-by-layer dry transfer technique38."
