    "abstractText": "Objective Dexmedetomidine is a medication that has analgesic, sedative, and anti-anxiety properties. In the clinical, it is often used to prevent common complications associated with strabismus surgery, including postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain, and oculocardiac reflex. However, its effectiveness and side effects of the present studies are different. The sample sizes of the present studies on the prevention of complications of dexmedetomidine are small. Therefore, this study evaluates the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in preventing anesthesia-related complications in strabismus surgery through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Literature was retrieved from 10 commonly used databases and randomized controlled trials published up to May 2022 were sought. The included studies compared the intervention effects of dexmedetomidine versus placebo on anesthesia-related complications in surgery. The occurrence rates of postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain, and oculocardiac reflex in patients undergoing strabismus surgery were evaluated. Statistical analyses and forest plots were generated using Review Manager and STATA software. Binary outcomes were measured using relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval for each outcome. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the bias and risk in the studies that met the inclusion criteria. Results A total of 13 articles were ultimately included in the analysis, comprising 1,018 patients who underwent strabismus surgery. The dexmedetomidine group, compared to the placebo group, demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of postoperative delirium (RR = 0.73, P = 0.001), severe postoperative delirium (RR = 0.45, P = 0.005), postoperative nausea and vomiting (RR = 0.48, P < 0.0001), and the need for supplemental analgesia postoperatively (RR = 0.60, P = 0.004). Additionally, subgroup analysis revealed that intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of oculocardiac reflex (RR = 0.50, P = 0.001). In contrast, intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine did not have a significant effect on the incidence of oculocardiac reflex (RR = 1.22, P = 0.15). There was a significant difference between the subgroups (P = 0.0005, I2 = 91.7%). Conclusion Among patients undergoing strabismus surgery, the use of dexmedetomidine can alleviate postoperative delirium and reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as postoperative pain. Moreover, intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine can lower the occurrence rate of the oculocardiac reflex.",

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver (http:// creat iveco mmons. org/ publi cdoma in/ zero/1. 0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.\nMethods Literature was retrieved from 10 commonly used databases and randomized controlled trials published up to May 2022 were sought. The included studies compared the intervention effects of dexmedetomidine versus placebo on anesthesia-related complications in surgery. The occurrence rates of postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain, and oculocardiac reflex in patients undergoing strabismus surgery were evaluated. Statistical analyses and forest plots were generated using Review Manager and STATA software. Binary outcomes were measured using relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval for each outcome. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the bias and risk in the studies that met the inclusion criteria.\nResults A total of 13 articles were ultimately included in the analysis, comprising 1,018 patients who underwent strabismus surgery. The dexmedetomidine group, compared to the placebo group, demonstrated significant reductions in the incidence of postoperative delirium (RR = 0.73, P = 0.001), severe postoperative delirium (RR = 0.45, P = 0.005), postoperative nausea and vomiting (RR = 0.48, P < 0.0001), and the need for supplemental analgesia postoperatively (RR = 0.60, P = 0.004). Additionally, subgroup analysis revealed that intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of oculocardiac reflex (RR = 0.50, P = 0.001). In contrast, intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine did not have a significant effect on the incidence of oculocardiac reflex (RR = 1.22, P = 0.15). There was a significant difference between the subgroups (P = 0.0005, I2 = 91.7%).\nConclusion Among patients undergoing strabismus surgery, the use of dexmedetomidine can alleviate postoperative delirium and reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as postoperative pain. Moreover, intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine can lower the occurrence rate of the oculocardiac reflex.\nKeywords Dexmedetomidine, Strabismus surgery, Anesthesia complications, Meta-analysis\n\u2020Yiren Chen and Mingjie Li contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: Chengjie Li lichengjie130060@163.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Strabismus surgery is one of the common procedures in ophthalmology, often performed under general anesthesia [1]. Patients frequently experience postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and postoperative pain following strabismus surgery. According to the literature, the incidence rates of these complications can be as high as 40%-84%, 37%-80%, and 65% respectively [2]. Postoperative delirium can even lead to patients removing intravenous catheters or causing self-harm [3]. Severe postoperative vomiting can affect patients\u2019 ability to eat and drink, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances, which in turn can hinder recovery and result in prolonged hospital stays or unplanned readmissions [4]. Postoperative pain can also affect oral intake, sleep, and may prolong hospitalization [4]. Hence, complications following strabismus surgery not only increase patients\u2019 distress and discomfort but also add to the workload and stress of medical or nursing staff [2, 4].\nDexmedetomidine is a highly selective \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist, known for its sedative, analgesic, and anti-anxiety effects, making it widely used in clinical anesthesia [5]. Dexmedetomidine can be used for the prevention or treatment of delirium in intensive care units [6, 7], and can also be used to prevent postoperative delirium in adults undergoing cardiac or other non-cardiac surgeries [8]. Furthermore, literature reports that dexmedetomidine can alleviate pain and delirium in children undergoing adenoidectomy without significant side effects [9]. Moreover, a meta-analysis reported that the use of dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children undergoing various types of surgery [10]. However, there are limited and somewhat outdated meta-analyses on whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium, nausea, vomiting, and pain in patients undergoing strabismus surgery. Additionally, as intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine becomes increasingly utilized in clinical settings, literature analyzing this method of administration remains scarce. Also, existing studies often have small sample sizes, and the results are frequently contradictory [11, 12], which is confusing. Therefore, there is still a need for high-quality meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in preventing anesthesia-related complications in strabismus surgery.\nIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning dexmedetomidine and strabismus surgery, to assess the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in preventing anesthesia-related complications in strabismus surgery."

The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), National Institute for Health research (ID: CRD42023438847). In adherence to the principles of Cochrane, three researchers independently searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, Clinical Trials, and Chinese databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed), to retrieve eligible studies published up until May 2022 since the inception of these databases. Keywords used in the search included \"dexmedetomidine,\" \"\u03b12 agonist,\" \"children,\" \"strabismus,\" \"eye surgery,\" and \"ophthalmic surgery.\" After generating a list of potentially eligible studies, the researchers conducted manual review and verification to determine the final selection for inclusion in the analysis.\nThis study only included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) related to strabismus surgery that compared the use of dexmedetomidine with a placebo or other anesthetic agents, without restrictions on the route of administration or dosage of the drug. Studies that were of types such as reviews, cohort studies, or case reports, and other non-RCT studies were excluded. We only included the studies written in English or Chinese. The three independent researchers then screened the retrieved literature, removed duplicates that arose during database integration, and read the titles and abstracts of the articles for initial selection. The full texts of the preliminarily selected articles were obtained and thoroughly read to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies during the process were resolved through consultation and discussion.\nThe primary outcomes of interest in this study were the incidence of postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and postoperative pain as well as the number of patients requiring additional analgesics postoperatively. Additionally, the study also assessed the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex (OCR)."

            "text": "This study is the most up-to-date and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT studies to date. In contrast to other studies that only compare the intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine [26], this study also includes the relatively new method of intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine. After searching multiple databases and screening literature, 13 studies with a total of 1018 patients were included for analysis. The meta-analysis of this study shows that the use of dexmedetomidine in strabismus surgery can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium, severe postoperative delirium, postoperative nausea and\nvomiting, and the need for supplemental analgesia. It was also found that intravenous dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex postoperatively.\nPostoperative delirium is a common adverse complication after general anesthesia surgery, and strabismus surgery is one of the risk factors for postoperative delirium [27]. Possible risk factors for postoperative delirium include rapid awakening after anesthesia, use of shortacting volatile anesthetics, postoperative pain, age, and type of surgery [28]. Previous literature analysis found that dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium in non-cardiac surgeries [29]. However, there is still controversy regarding whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in strabismus surgery, and the results are inconsistent [17, 19]. This study did not conduct subgroup analysis for age and anesthesia methods, so the results have a certain degree of generalizability. Our results suggest that dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence or severity of postoperative delirium. Therefore, it is\nrecommended that anesthesiologists consider using dexmedetomidine to reduce the occurrence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing high-risk surgeries, such as strabismus surgery.\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting are common phenomena after general anesthesia and can lead to electrolyte imbalances, aspiration pneumonia, delayed discharge, and increased unplanned admissions, which significantly increase patient discomfort and medical costs [30]. There are reports that dexmedetomidine has a prophylactic antiemetic effect during general anesthesia [31], but this analysis lacks research on strabismus surgery. In this study, our results demonstrate that dexmedetomidine has a prophylactic antiemetic effect in strabismus surgery. However, there are few RCT studies comparing the antiemetic effects of dexmedetomidine with other preoperative prophylactic antiemetic drugs, and further research is needed to compare the antiemetic effects of dexmedetomidine.\nPostoperative pain is the main cause of discomfort after anesthesia, and patients undergoing strabismus surgery are at high risk for postoperative pain [32]. Postoperative pain is associated with pediatric postoperative delirium, and therefore the European Society for Paediatric Anaesthesiology recommends pain management for six common pediatric surgeries, but strabismus surgery is not\ncurrently included in the guideline [33]. Dexmedetomidine has analgesic effects and is widely used in various surgeries. It can effectively relieve pain, prolong the painfree period, and reduce the use of opioids during the recovery period after general anesthesia [34]. Our study confirms this, showing that dexmedetomidine can reduce the number of patients requiring supplemental analgesia after strabismus surgery.\nRegarding other adverse events after strabismus surgery, the oculocardiac reflex is of current interest. The oculocardiac reflex is related to triggering stimuli, most commonly caused by the traction of the extraocular muscles [35]. There has been much clinical debate about the relationship between dexmedetomidine and the oculocardiac reflex, with no definitive results [36]. Interestingly, the comprehensive analysis of all the literature included in this study revealed high heterogeneity between results. Subgroup analysis by administration method showed that intravenous administration can reduce the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex, which is consistent with previous meta-analyses [26]. However, the relationship between intranasal administration and the oculocardiac reflex is still unclear, possibly due to the small number of studies on intranasal administration. More research is needed to evaluate the relationship between intranasal administration and the oculocardiac reflex.\nThis study has some limitations. Firstly, although the study has made efforts to include more comprehensive RCT studies, the number of studies is still small, with small sample sizes, and all studies are single-center, which may introduce bias. Secondly, there are differences in the timing and dosages of dexmedetomidine administration among different studies, but due to the small number of control experiments, intergroup analysis cannot be performed, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Additionally, postoperative management and interventions differ among studies, which may affect the heterogeneity of the results.\nIn summary, our study found that in patients undergoing strabismus surgery, the use of dexmedetomidine can alleviate postoperative delirium and reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea, vomiting, and pain. In addition, intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of the oculocardiac reflex.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12871- 023- 02215-9.\nAdditional file\u00a01.\nAcknowledgements The project was supported by Hainan Province Clinical Medical Center.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions CYR, LMJ, and LCJ contributed to study design and conception.
