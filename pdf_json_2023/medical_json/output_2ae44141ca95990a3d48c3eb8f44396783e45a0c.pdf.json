    "abstractText": "Background. Esophagojejunostomy after minimally invasive total gastrectomy (MITG) for gastric cancer (GC) is technically challenging. Failure of the esophagojejunal anastomosis can lead to significant morbidity, leading to shortand long-term quality of life (QoL) impairment or mortality. The optimal reconstruction method following MITG remains controversial. We evaluated outcomes of minimally invasive esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic or robotic total gastrectomies. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed MITG patients between 2015 and 2020 at two high-volume centers in China and the United States. Eligible patients were divided into groups by different reconstruction methods. We compared clinicopathologic characteristics, postoperative outcomes, including complication rates, overall survival rate (OS), disease-free survival rate (DFS), and patient-reported QoL. Results. GC patients (n = 105) were divided into intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (IEJ, n = 60) and extracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (EEJ, n = 45) groups. EEJ had higher incidence of wound infection (8.3% vs 13.3%, P = 0.044) and pneumonia (21.7% vs 40.0%, P = 0.042) than IEJ. The linear stapler (LS) group was inferior to the circular stapler (CS) group in reflux [50.0 (11.1\u201377.8) vs 44.4 (0.0\u201366.7), P = 0.041] and diarrhea [33.3 (0.0\u201366.7) vs 0.0 (0.0\u201366.7), P = 0.045] while LS was better than CS for dysphagia [22.2 (0.0\u201333.3) vs 11.1 (0.0\u201333.3), P = 0.049] and eating restrictions [33.3 (16.7\u201358.3) vs 41.7 (16.7\u201366.7), P = 0.029] at 1 year. OS and DFS did not differ significantly between LS and CS. Conclusions. IEJ anastomosis generated better results than EEJ. LS was associated with a better patient eating experience, but more diarrhea and reflux compared with CS. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes show the superiority of IEJ with the LS reconstruction method in MITG for GC.",

An estimated 20\u201340% of gastric tumors are now found in the upper portions of the stomach.1,2 For patients with proximal GC, a total gastrectomy (TG) with esophagojejunal (EJ) reconstruction is often required to achieve the oncological goal of R0 resection critical to every curative intent treatment for GC.

The failure of EJ anastomoses leads to postoperative adverse events that have an immediate negative impact on the patient\u2019s postoperative course with long-lasting quality-of-life impairments. In particular, the intrathoracic retraction of the distal esophagus, the narrow operative view through the esophageal hiatus, and the manipulation of the esophagus and small bowel are special considerations during minimally invasive approaches in order to create a tension-free and well-vascularized EJ anastomosis. While several methods for both laparoscopic and robotic esophagojejunostomy have been described, no consensus exists on the best reconstruction methods, and guidelines are absent.\nMinimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the treatment of GC has improved postoperative outcomes, such as less pain, better cosmetic results, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stays than open surgery.3 However, both open and MIS approaches to total gastrectomy risk potentially severe complications associated with EJ anastomotic failure, such as leakage, pneumonia, pleural effusions, bleeding, stenosis, and death.4,5 Hence, in the beginning, MIS total gastrectomy often adopted an 8- to 10-cm midline incision to complete an extracorporeal esophageal-jejunal anastomosis using the same technique as conventional open surgery. For MIS radical total gastrectomy, the technical complexity of reconstruction remains a significant barrier to the wide adoption of both robotic and laparoscopic approaches. A better understanding of the comparative outcomes associated with the different minimally invasive methods for creating an EJ anastomosis after TG is needed to optimize surgical techniques and improve GC patient outcomes."

All surgeries were performed by experienced surgeons, who determined the surgical approach (laparoscopic and robotic) by their preference after thorough discussion with the patients, who also consented to video recording of their operations. Videos of operative procedures were evaluated between the two corresponding authors for quality control.

The real-life experiences with MIS for proximal GC at our two high-volume specialized GC centers between 2015 and 2020 demonstrate that both laparoscopic and robotic TGs with various EJ techniques are safely and routinely performed. For the first time, we show the short-term benefits of IEJ with LS that reduced wound infections and pneumonia, and patient-reported advantages of less dysphagia and fewer eating restrictions compared with reduced incidence of reflux and diarrhea with the use of CS.\nStudies evaluating methods of reconstructing the continuity of the esophago-intestinal tract after MITG have different outcomes, and the best technique for creating\nesophagojejunal anastomosis remains a topic of debate. A key challenge to interpreting the outcomes of these conflicting study results is in the details of various MITG with IEJ or EEJ procedures which may differ, such as length of the incision and operating exposure12,13 as well as surgeonspecific factors such as training, volume, and experience. Patients with obesity, smaller esophageal hiatus, or costal arch angle always significantly increase surgical difficulty and prolong the operative time because of the limited surgical field exposure. IEJ can provide a clear view with a small incision. However, obtaining good surgical exposure and safely performing EEJ using a normal assisted incision is usually challenging. It is often necessary to extend the incision, which may lead to wound-related complications. In our study, the incidence of wound-related complications in EEJ was significantly higher than in IEJ. In contrast to our study, WH Han et\u00a0al. showed that their overall complication rate was higher in the IEJ group than in the EEG group. They considered this might be related to the deficiency of technical proficiency and experience.14 Moreover, the leakage rate of IEJ is higher than that of EEJ, although it was not statistically significant. This is most likely due to patients in the IEJ group having higher BMI and ASA, both of which are factors predictive of EJ leaks. Moreover, considering that circular staplers have two rows of staples, while linear staplers have three rows, in theory, circular staplers are more prone to anastomotic leakage. This issue could contribute to higher IEJ leakage rates than found with EEJ. A metaanalysis consisting of 8 studies with 1883 patients showed no significant differences in operating time, anastomotic time, the length of resection margin, postoperative recovery, anastomosis-related complication, and overall complication between the two groups. But IEJ is more minimally invasive, with less blood loss and more significant lymph node dissections.15 Our study found that IEJ had significantly reduced pneumonia rates, perhaps attributable to younger patients.\nOverlap, \u03c0-shaped, and OrVil are commonly used in IEJ and have gradually been proposed and adopted by surgeons,16\u201318 but few studies have compared them. An LS is used in overlap and \u03c0-shaped techniques, which can be inserted into the abdominal cavity through a 12-mm trocar for anastomosis. The surgeon can obtain a good surgical field with the suspended liver and assistant retraction. However, the CS often needs an additional small incision or assist port extension, which is bulky and can block the operation field, resulting in increased difficulty and prolonged operation time. In this study, no significant difference was found in operation time, which may be attributed to the experienced surgical team. In addition, a successful anastomosis requires attention to many details; we have also experienced some cases of anastomosis failure, summarized in Fig.\u00a03. The overlap and \u03c0-shaped anastomosis always need a longer esophagus and jejunum to safely complete side-to-side\nanastomosis. Completing a tension-free anastomosis with an R0 resection for patients with a higher tumor invasion is challenging. We preferred cutting the diaphragmatic foot and pulling down the esophagus to complete the anastomosis. In addition, two knotless barbs are sutured on the stapled line of the esophageal stump, which provides convenience for the assistant to pull the distal esophagus.19 Unlike the small intestine, the muscular and mucosal layers of the esophagus can be easily separated, so there is a risk of inserting one arm of the LS into a false lumen during EEJ, especially when the incision in the esophagus is small. In our study, when overlap and \u03c0-shaped anastomosis were performed, a nasogastric tube was inserted through the incision in the esophagus. Then the anvil of the LS was inserted into the esophagus, guided by the nasogastric tube. Therefore, we conducted a subgroup analysis to investigate differences between the different methods. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the three major techniques examined. Several previous studies differ from our findings. For example, Kawamura et\u00a0al.20 found that overlap was related to fewer anastomotic complications than the OrVil procedure, especially regarding anastomotic stenosis. These findings are similar to those of Chen et\u00a0al., who showed that overlap was superior to OrVil in the incidence of perioperative, postoperative, and anastomoticrelated complications, the severity of complications, and the time of postoperative recovery.21 Furthermore, compared with overlap anastomosis, \u03c0-shaped anastomosis could reduce the operation and anastomosis time with the same results for postoperative complications, margin distance, etc.22 In our experience, minimally invasive IEJ techniques provide clear intra-abdominal and transhiatal views with a small incision. Thus, IEJ with linear staplers such as overlap and \u03c0-shaped anastomoses are preferred when possible. In terms of tumor location, tumors that do not involve the GEJ or cardia are the safest for these methods. Since overlap and \u03c0-shaped anastomoses always require exposure to a longer esophagus and jejunum to safely complete the side-to-side anastomosis, these IEJs are technically limited when more than 5 cm of the distal esophagus is resected due to tumors that involve the distal esophagus. The \u03c0-shaped anastomosis is generally not the first choice when the tumor location is too high to guarantee a negative margin, because one cannot get definitive proof of the negative margin before completing the esophagojejunostomy. \u03c0-shaped anastomosis is technically simpler than overlap in MIS surgery, but the margin cannot be checked before the anastomosis is finished. On the other hand, we can remove the specimen and ensure the margin is negative, then finish the overlap anastomosis. So, if the tumor is located in the esophagogastric junction and the upper edge is less than 2 cm from the cardia, we tend to perform an overlap anastomosis and check the margin during the operation; otherwise, we choose a \u03c0-shaped anastomosis.\nMoreover, the IEJ with OrVil can be helpful when the distal esophageal resection margin is high up in the mediastinum. The anvil can be placed using the NGT to guide and secure the anvil to the distal esophageal staple line. The mating of the shaft of the EEA and the anvil takes some experience. In case of stapler misfires or misaligned or mesenteric twisting of EJs, circular EJs are easier to salvage because a short segment of the distal esophagus requires resection. In failures of linear stapling of the EJ, a long segment of the distal esophagus can be damaged, and recovery or redo of the EJ becomes a significant challenge and may require a thoracic approach.\nLinear and circular staplers are widely used in many medical centers during MITG. LS is associated with a low risk of anastomotic leakage, especially in MIS.18,23,24 However, most studies demonstrated that the safety and efficacy of the two staplers were similar during the operation. LS only had advantages in shortening the anastomotic time under MITG, and there was no significant difference in surgical outcomes or overall complications between the two groups.20,25,26 Compared with the 2-row CS, the 3-row LS enhanced anastomosis. The most significant difference between CS and LS is the inner diameter of the anastomosis. A 25-mm-diameter CS is the most frequently used in EEJ, and its diameter is not comparable to an LS with a\nFIG. 3 Esophagojejunal anastomosis. During overlap reconstruction, if the tension is high, the stapler will cause intestinal perforation (a). And before firing the stapler, the nasogastric tube for guidance should be unplugged, or it might get stitched (b). In the \u03c0-shaped anastomosis, if the common opening has not been closed, one arm of the\nstapler may slip into it and cause anastomosis failure (c). The white arrows are pointing at the intestinal perforation caused by the stapler (a), the stitched nasogastric tube (b), and the failure anastomosis due to the stapler entering the common opening (c), respectively. Right side shows magnified images from dashed-line boxes on left side\n28- to 30-mm diameter. The different anastomotic diameters thus may affect the long-term outcomes. We explored the difference between LS and CS for long-term prognosis, including OS, DFS, and QoL. At first, we analyzed baseline data, and no significant differences between the two groups, except the TNM stage, were observed (Supplementary Table\u00a05). Whether LS or CS, it did not affect the OS or DFS. We found some notable results for QoL. LS was associated with a better eating experience with a larger anastomosis but poor anti-reflux, and diarrhea at the 1-year follow-up. This may be attributed to drugs, emotions, gut microbiota, foods and diets, and abnormal intestinal activities after surgery.27\u201329 However, it is still unclear which factor mentioned above differs between the two groups and this topic needs further study.\nThe limitations of this study include the selection bias inherent in a retrospective study. Unfortunately, compared with IEJ, the number of patients receiving EEJ was lower and limited our ability to perform propensity score matching of baseline characteristics. Also, the pooling of data from the two institutions where all EEJs were performed by surgeons in China and all OrVil-assisted IEJs were performed in robotic gastrectomies in the United States complicates the interpretation of the study. Despite these limitations, the findings of our study demonstrate the outcome from real-life variations in surgical technique for EJ anastomoses after TG for GC amongst surgeons and institutions worldwide, and contribute to the knowledge about MITG with EJ anastomosis outcomes."
