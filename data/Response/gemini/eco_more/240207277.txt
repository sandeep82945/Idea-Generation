1. **Investigate the long-term effects of demand bundling on school broadband prices and speeds.** The paper only examines the short-term effects of demand bundling, but it would be valuable to know how these effects change over time. For example, do prices continue to decrease and speeds continue to increase in the years after the program is implemented?
2. **Examine the impact of demand bundling on other aspects of school operations.** The paper focuses on the impact of demand bundling on broadband prices and speeds, but it is possible that the program also had other effects on school operations. For example, did demand bundling lead to changes in the way schools use broadband? Did it make it easier for schools to collaborate with each other?
3. **Replicate the study in other settings.** The paper's findings are based on a study of schools in New Jersey. It would be valuable to replicate the study in other settings to see if the findings are generalizable. For example, would demand bundling have the same effects on schools in other states or countries?
4. **Develop a theoretical model of demand bundling for broadband.** The paper does not develop a theoretical model of demand bundling for broadband. Such a model could help to explain the findings of the study and provide insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of demand bundling.
5. **Explore the use of demand bundling for other types of goods and services.** The paper focuses on the use of demand bundling for broadband, but it is possible that demand bundling could also be used for other types of goods and services. For example, could demand bundling be used to reduce the cost of textbooks or school supplies?
