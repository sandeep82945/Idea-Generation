Screening for inhibitors of glycosyltransferases are mainly performed by in vitro enzyme assays with difficulties moving candidates to cells and animals. Here, we circumvent this by employing a cell-based screening assay using glycoengineered cells expressing tailored reporter glycoproteins. We focused on GalNAc-type O-glycosylation and selected the GalNAc-T11 isoenzyme that selectively glycosylates endocytic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related proteins as targets. Our screen of a limited small molecule compound library did not identify selective inhibitors of GalNAc-T11, however, we identify two compounds that broadly inhibited Golgi-localized glycosylation processes. These compoundsmediate the reversible fragmentation of the Golgi systemwithout affecting secretion. We demonstrate how these inhibitors can be used to manipulate glycosylation in cells to induce expression of truncated O-glycans and augment binding of cancer-specific Tn-glycoprotein antibodies and to inhibit expression of heparan sulfate and binding and infection of SARS-CoV-2.\nSmall-molecule inhibitors of cellular glycosylation are highly useful to probe the involvement of glycans in biological interactions and functions, and they have potential therapeutic applications in diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases1\u20133. Several natural compounds and synthetic sugar mimetics are available that alter or inhibit the glycosylation pathways or specific glycosylation steps in mammalian cells2.

Many of these compounds inhibit glycosidases or glycosyltransferases involved in the initiation or the early biosynthetic steps of the respective glycosylation pathways with varying selectivity and off-target effects. Inhibitors such as Brefeldin A (BFA, derived from Penicillium brefeldianum) rapidly block protein transport from ER toGolgi by preventing COP-I assembly and thus broadly affect protein glycosylation by preventing access of nascent ER glycoproteins to the Golgi-located glycosylation processes13\u201315. Since BFA blocks secretion and transport of glycoproteins to the cell surface, such inhibitors are of limited use as global inhibitors of glycosylation and to study the biological roles of glycans. More selective pan-inhibitors of sialyltransferase16,17 and fucosyltransferase17,18 isoenzymes based on fluorinated sugar mimetics enable specific deletion of glycan capping.\nOne challenge is to identify selective inhibitors of individual glycosyltransferase (iso)enzymes active inside the cell that block their specific glycosylation of unique protein targets or distinct pools of glycoproteins. A prime target for inhibitors are the 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferase (GalNAc-Ts) isoenzymes that transfer N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from the nucleotide sugar donor UDP-GalNAc to the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, and possibly tyrosine amino acids forming the GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr/Tyr linkage, a step that initiates the GalNAc-type protein O-glycosylation (hereafter simply O-glycosylation unless otherwise defined)19\u201321. O-glycans are found on more than 80% of proteins trafficking the secretory pathway, and O-glycosylation serves important roles in fine-tuning protein functions including co-regulating pro-protein processing, ectodomain shedding, signaling, receptor dimerization, and receptor function19,22\u201325. For example, site-specificO-glycosylation in the ligand-binding domains of members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLRrelated proteins (LRPs) catalyzed by the GalNAc-T11 isoenzyme markedly enhance interactions with ligands, e.g., LDL and VLDL26,27. Moreover, aberrant expression of immature O-glycans and overexpression of densely glycosylated carrier proteins, such as mucins, are characteristic features observed in many forms of cancer and are thought to contribute to cancer progression28,29. Inhibitors of O-glycosylation and in particular GalNAc-T isoenzymes that regulate the initiation step are still poorly explored and only few inhibitor candidates have been reported30\u201334. Most small-molecule inhibitors of O-glycosylation have been identified through in vitro enzyme assay screening of different GalNAc-Ts, and identified inhibitors include plant-derived flavonoids such as luteolin35 and UDP-GalNAc-analogs31,36. However,most of these have faced challenges with selectivity including selectivity for particular GalNAc-T isoenzymes. A major limitation for discovery of selective inhibitors of glycosyltransferases suitable for in vivo studies is the lack of robust screening systems capable of discerning specificity of inhibitors for individual glycosyltransferases and in particular members of large isoenzyme families2,37. With facile gene-editing technologies it is now possible to engineer and custom design the glycosylation of mammalian cells for cell-based screening campaigns38\u201340. The first use of such glycoengineered cell models for inhibitor screens were employed by Linstedt and colleagues, using fluorescence biosensors for specific GalNAc-T isoenzymes to screen for isoenzyme-specific inhibitors30,41. This enabled the discovery of T3Inh-1 a selective inhibitor of GalNAc-T3 in vivo through the expression of these biosensors in isogenic cells with and without the relevant GALNT30. In a different example, selective inhibitors of STT3B were identified by using the genetically inactivated catalytic subunits of the OST, STT3A, and STT3B during screening. The identified inhibitors allowed for the regulation of N-glycan sites targeted by posttranslational N-glycosylation42. These examples show how glycoengineering ofmammalian cell lines provides cell-based platforms that can be used\nto screen for selective inhibitors of specific biosynthetic steps and isoenzymes.\nHere, we used glycoengineering to develop cell-based assays for screening for inhibitors of one of the many GalNAc-T isoenzymes that initiate protein O-glycosylation (GalNAc-T11) and subsequently for general inhibitors of O-glycosylation. We screened a library of 1952 small-molecule compounds and identified two compounds, NSC80997 and NSC255112, which potently inhibit not only O-glycosylation, but also other Golgi-localized glycosylation processes, including elaboration of N-glycosylation and biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans, notably without substantially affecting secretion of glycoproteins. Detailed studies into the mechanism of action for these compounds suggest that the effects are mediated through reversible fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. We demonstrate that the identified compounds are widely useful for reversible inhibition of glycosylation in cell models without affecting glycoprotein transport and secretion, which opens widely up for studies of general roles of elaborate glycosylation features in cellular assays. The developed cellbased assays using secreted reporters were demonstrated to be suitable for screening of specific inhibitors of glycosyltransferases, and ourdiscovery of global inhibitorsof glycosylation in a small compound library stresses theneed for thorough validation in further screeningof larger compound libraries."

This GalNAcT isoenzyme is not predicted to function with the biosensor strategy developed by Linstedt and colleagues27,37 employing furin cleavable substrates given the selective substrate specificity for the LA repeats. To screen for potential selective inhibitors of GalNAc-T11, we therefore designed a reporter assay based on a secreted LDLR substrate (Fig. 1a, upper part). First, a secreted6xHis-tagged chimericCFP-LDLR reporter was designed for stable expression in HEK293 SimpleCells (SC) (HEKKO COSMC), which endogenously express GALNT11 and secrete the reporter with homogenous Tn O-glycans (GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr). Second, we developed an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) for quantitative captureof the secreted LDLRreporter in culturemediumby anti6xHis antibody and detection of Tn O-glycans introduced by GalNAcT11 using the Tn-specific VVA lectin. Reporter secretion and capture efficiency was monitored by CFP fluorescence, and it was confirmed that the LDLR reporter was specifically O-glycosylated by GalNAc-T11 in wildtype HEKWT and HEKKO COSMC cells by demonstrating loss of O-glycans when expressed in HEKKO GALNT11 cells with no differences in secretion levels (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The engineered HEKKO COSMC cells stably secreting the Tn-LDLR reporter were incubated with a compound library containing 1952 smallmolecules previously selected to have no/low cytotoxicity (National Cancer Institute). Cells were cultured in96-well plates and treated for 24 hours (h)with 10 \u00b5Mof the respective candidate compound and DMSO treatment was used as vehicle control.MTTassays of the treated cells revealed that ca. 30%of the compounds significantly altered metabolic activity, and those compounds were excluded from further analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1B). The culturemedium collected after 24 hwas analyzedwith the capture ELLA to assess loss of Tn O-glycosylation of the secreted LDLR reporter. The first screening identified 45 compounds that reduced VVA binding (>60%) to the Tn-LDLR reporter compared to DMSO control (Fig. 1b). This number was reduced to two compounds, NSC80997 and NSC255112, after repeated screening and considering viability of cells and secretion levels of the reporter (Supplementary Fig. 1C).

Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot analysis of the culture medium was used to evaluate potential changes in glycosylation and showed that only NSC80997 and NSC255112 robustly reduced the apparent molecular weight of the secreted LDLR reporter (Fig. 1d). These results suggested that NSC80997 and NSC255112 interfered with O-glycosylation of the LDLR reporter. We also developed a related cell-based assay platform suitable for screening of inhibitors of O-glycan elongation. HEKWT cells were engineered for core1 O-glycosylation without terminal \u03b12-3 linked sialic acids (HEK293KOGCNT1/ST3GAL1/2) to enable detection of core1 by PNA lectin (T, Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr), and the emergence of Tn\nb\nc\n48 05 48 06 48 07 48 08 48 09 48 10 48 11 48 12 48 13 48 14 48 15 48 16 48 17 48 18 48 19 48 20 48 21 48 23 48 24 48 58 48 59\n13 16\n03 31\n-1\n13 16\n03 31\n-2\n13 16\n03 31\n-3 0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\nPlate\nFo ld\nCh an\nge VV\nA\nTn-LDLR screen\n48 05 48 06 48 07 48 08 48 09 48 10 48 11 48 12 48 13 48 14 48 15 48 16 48 17 48 18 48 19 48 20 48 21 48 22 48 23 48 24 48 58 48 59\n13 16\n03 31\n-1\n13 16\n03 31\n-2\n13 16\n03 31\n-3 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nPlate\nFo ld\nCh an\nge VV\nA\nT-MUC1 screen\nd kDa\n49\n36\nCompounds (10\u03bcM)\nkDa\n130\n100\nCompounds (10\u03bcM)e\n0 11 2,50,50 5 10 0,5 2,5 5\n3.1MG [\u03bcM] 5.1MG [\u03bcM]\nVVA\nNSC255112 (\u03bcM) NSC80997 (\u03bcM) 10kDa 130\n100\n100\nf\n0 11 2,50,50 5 10 0,5 2,5 5\nVVA\nNSC255112 (\u03bcM) NSC80997 (\u03bcM) 10kDa 130\n100\n100\ng\nNSC80997 NSC255112\nNSC80997 NSC255112\nGlycoengineeringa Reporters Screen\nTn-LDLR\nT-MUC1\nTn -L\nD LR\nTM\nU C 1 M U C 1 W\nT Tn -M U C 1\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:948 3\nantigen by VVA upon inhibition of the core1 synthase C1GalT1 (Fig. 1a, lower part). For this, we designed a different reporter based on the tandem repeat region of the human mucin 1 (MUC1)43, as this would also enable detection of general inhibitors of initiation of O-glycosylation (not limited to GalNAc-T11) by combined monitoring of loss of PNA and gain of VVA binding. The secreted T-MUC1 reporter was stably expressed in HEKKO GCNT1/ST3GAL1/2 cells, and the compound library was tested as described for the LDLR reporter. The PNA detection assay produced low signal to noise ratio and it was not possible to reliably detect reduction in PNA signals. However, seven compounds were found to induce VVA reactivity with the reporter (Fig. 1c), surprisingly including the NSC80997 and NSC255112 compounds found to reduce VVA reactivity with the LDLR reporter expressed with Tn O-glycans (Fig. 1b). Testing the effects of the seven compounds with the MUC1 reporter expressed in HEKWT cells by Western blot analysis revealed that three of these induced marked changes in migration, including NSC80997 and NSC255112 (Fig. 1e).\nThese results suggested that NSC80997 and NSC255112 affected both initiation and elongation of O-glycosylation in ways not directly dependent on GalNAc-T11. We confirmed that neither compound directly targeted recombinant GalNAc-T11 by an in vitro glycosylation assay using non-glycosylated (naked) LDLR reporter protein produced in E. coli as substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Further analysis by Western blot of the MUC1 reporter secreted by HEKWT and HEKKO COSMC cells revealed that both NSC80997 and NSC255112 reduced the molecular weight in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Tn antigen was detectable on the MUC1 reporter secreted from HEKWT cells treated with 2.5\u201310 \u00b5M of NSC255112 or 0.5\u201310 \u00b5M of NSC80997 compounds, with higher doses showing decreased VVA staining (Fig. 1f). Detection of Tn also decreased with concentrations >5 \u00b5Mon theMUC1 reporter secreted fromHEKKOCOSMC cells (Fig. 1g). Taken together, this suggests a dose-dependent inhibition of O-glycosylation by NSC80997 and NSC255112, with lower doses inhibiting glycan elongation and consequently exposure of Tn, and higher doses further inhibiting the initiation of O-glycosylation. These results demonstrate the importance for careful evaluation of candidate compounds by different reporter designs for glycosylation, and indicate that future studies of larger compound libraries will require both assays for identification of inhibitors of specific isoenzymes.\nNSC80997 and NSC255112 induce Tn expression in human cell lines The findings prompted us to assess the effects of NSC80997 and NSC255112 on O-glycosylation in different cell types. Incubation of HEKWT cells with increasing concentrations of both compounds (or equal volumes of DMSO as control) for 24h showed that concentrations up to 10 \u00b5Mwere well-tolerated (Fig. 2a). Flow cytometry analysis of HEKWT cells treated with >1 \u00b5M revealed strong induction of VVA reactivity (Tn) on the surface, whereas DMSO control-treated cells remainedVVAnegative (Fig. 2b, c). The sameeffectwasobservedwhen probing with the 1E3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically recognizes the Tn antigen confirming display of the Tn antigen at the cell surface44 (Fig. 2c). Tn induction was also observed in other human cancer cell lines including MCF-7, AGS, SH-SY5Y, and HeLa cells\n(Fig. 2d). Kinetics studies demonstrated that Tn induction was detectable in HEK293WT and HeLaWT cells after 6\u20138h incubation with a maximumbeing reached at 18 h (Fig. 2e). Notably, upon removal of the compounds from the culture, Tn expression was reduced more than half after 24 h of culture and lost around 72 h (Fig. 2f). Thus, both compounds readily induced Tn expression in HEKWT cells and this effect was reversible with no significant impact on cell viability or proliferation.\nThe biosynthetic capacities for initiation and core1 extension of O-glycans can be studied in the CHO ldlDmutant cell line that harbors a defect in the UDP-Gal 4\u2019-epimerase (GALE) that converts UDP-Glc/ GlcNAc to UDP-Gal/GalNAc45,46. The defect results in loss of UDP-Gal and all types of galactosylation including core1 synthesis and UDPGalNAc and primarily initiation of O-glycosylation, but these effects can selectively be rescued by supplementation of exogenous Gal and/ or GalNAc. We therefore tested if addition of Gal and/or GalNAc to HEKWT cells treated with NSC80997 and NSC255112 could rescue the inhibition of O-glycosylation and prevent Tn-induction (Supplementary Fig. 2), but no evidence of rescue was observed indicating that the compounds likely did not affect GALE and the epimerization of UDPGlc/GlcNAc for donor substrate availability. Altogether these findings indicated that NSC80997 and NSC255112 induced Tn expression in a reversible manner, and that this effect is likely not mediated through interference with UDP-Gal/GalNAc biosynthesis.\nRemodeling of O-glycosylation by lead compounds is independent of the glucocorticoid receptor NSC255112 is a derivate of geldanamycin, a knownHSP90 inhibitor that is explored as an anti-tumor antibiotic47,48. NSC80997 is a derivate of cortivazol, a steroid that acts as high-affinity ligand for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)49. Although, both NSC80997 and NSC255112 are structurally highly different (Fig. 3a), their known intracellular targets, HSP90 and GR, pointed to a potential common link with the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. HSP90 is a constitutively expressed chaperone that complexes with the GR and other chaperones in the cytoplasm, and upon steroid binding the GR translocates to the nucleus where it induces anti-inflammatory genes and represses proinflammatory genes50,51. We therefore examined if the observed effects of the compounds were mediated by the GR pathway. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that treatment with NSC80997 and NSC255112 resulted in nuclear translocation of the GR in MCF7 cells at similar concentrations as the known GR agonist dexamethasone, suggesting that the effect on O-glycosylation could be GR-dependent (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3A). However, a series of known GR agonists (dexamethasone, cortisone, cortisol, mometasone furoate) tested did not induce Tn expression, even at concentrations >100 \u00b5M (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3B). Furthermore, pre-treatment of cells with mifepristone, a high-affinity GR antagonist, did not reduce NSC255112 or NSC80997-mediated induction of Tn on the MUC1 reporter (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Accordingly, inductionofTnwas still observed inHEK cells after KOofGR (HEKKONR3C1) and in cellswithKOof the related androgen receptor (HEKKO NR3C4) (Fig. 3d). NSC80997 only differs with deacylcortivazol (DAC) by the lack of an \u03b1-hydroxyl group next to its ketone. This hydroxymethyl ketone in DAC forms an\nFig. 1 | Glycoengineered cell-based high-throughput screening identifies lead compounds altering O-glycan reporter protein glycosylation. a Schematic presentation of the glycoengineering strategy yielding HEK293 (HEK) cells that stably secrete Tn-LDLR (HEKKO COSMC) or T-MUC1 (HEKKO GCNT1, ST3GAL1/2) reporter proteins, respectively, for cell-based HTP screening of 1952 compounds in a 96-well plate format by a VVA lectin ELLA (enzyme-linked lectin assay) detecting loss/gain of the Tn epitope on the reporter proteins.

Reducing themethyl ketone to a secondaryhydroxyl significantly decreased the ability of NSC80997 to induce Tn expression, suggesting that this part of the molecule could be involved in mediating the effects on glycosylation (Fig. 3e, f). Noteworthy, we observed a slight increase in VVA binding toHEKWT cells treatedwith other knownHSP90 inhibitors including geldanamycin and chemical derivatives thereof, but these compounds were highly cytotoxic in the nanomolar range (Supplementary Fig. 3D). We made multiple attempts to target the constitutively expressed HSP90 to further confirm this, but we were unable to obtain viable KO cells. In summary, our findings indicate that the effect of NSC80997 and NSC255112 on glycosylation is not directly mediated through the GR pathway, however, it is not inconceivable that inhibition of HSP90 could at least in part be involved.\na\nf\nCompound Removal 0 24 48 72+10\u03bcM NSC80997\nTn (VVA)\nTime (h)\nd\ne\nInduction Recovery\n0 1 2 5 10 20 0\n2000\n4000\n6000\nNSC80997 [\u03bcM]\nVV A\nM FI\n[a rb\n.u ni\nts ]\n0 1 2 5 10 20 0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nNSC80997 [\u03bcM]\nVV A\nM FI\n[a rb\n.u ni\nts ]\n0 1 2 5 10 20 0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nNSC80997 [\u03bcM]\nVV A\nM FI\n[a rb\n.u ni\nts ]\n0 1 2 5 10 20 0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nNSC80997 [\u03bcM]\nVV A\nM FI\n[a rb\n.u ni\nts ]\nDMSO\nDAPI /VVA\nNSC80997 c\n0 0,1 25 0,2 5 0,5 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 12\n8 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nConcentration [\u03bcM]\nAb so\nrb an\nce 59\n5 nm\n[a r b\n.u ni\nts ]\nDMSO NSC255112 NSC80997\nb Metabolic Activity\nVVA 1E3\nMCF7 AGS SH-SY5Y HeLa\nHEK293\nHeLa\nHEK293\nHeLa\n20 \u00b5M\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:948 5\nFig. 2 | NSC80997 and NSC255112 induce Tn expression in human cell lines. a Line graph shows metabolic activity of HEKWT cells treated with 0\u2013128 \u00b5M NSC80997 and NSC255112 for 24h measured by MTT assay.

We profiled treated HEKWT cells by flow cytometry with a panel of lectins and found that lectins recognizing \u03b12-3/6-sialylation (Pan-Lectenz, \u03b12,3-Lectenz), agalactosylated complex N-glycans (GSLII), and high-mannose N-glycans (GNA) were affected by both NSC80997 and NSC255112, suggesting these compounds broadly alter cellular glycosylation (Supplementary Fig. 4A). This prompted us to performamoredetailed analysis using representative recombinant secreted proteins for different types of glycosylation. First, we investigated the effects on N-glycosylation using erythropoietin (EPO) expressed in CHO cells, and both NSC80997 and NSC255112 induced a clear shift in migration of EPO at similar concentrations as the MUC1 reporter (Fig. 4a), and profiling released N-glycans from purified EPO revealed a clear shift to N-glycans with a marked reduction in galactosylation and almost complete loss of sialylation upon NSC80997 treatment (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, there were nomajor effects on the assembly of the basic tetra-antennary N-glycan cores structures with full incorporation of GlcNAc residues, although NSC80997 treatment seemed to also increase the level of high-mannose N-glycans slightly. The results were in line with the observed changes detected by lectin staining (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Next, we tested the effects on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis using recombinant expression of serglycin in CHO cells (Fig. 4c), and treatment with both NSC80997 and NSC255112 resulted in accumulation of the core protein without the characteristic high molecular weight smear in SDS-PAGE analysis observed with treatment, suggesting absence of GAG chains52. Finally, we investigated the TMTC1-4 directed O-mannose type of protein glycosylation53 using recombinant expression of a secreted E-cadherin protein expressed in HEKWT cells by mass spectrometry, and all eight potential O-Man\nIn te\nns ity\n(a rb\n. u ni\nts ) x\n10 4\n0,5\n1,0 10 \u03bcM NSC80997\nIn te\nns ity\n(a rb\n. u ni\nts ) x\n10 4\n0,5\n1,0 DMSO\nSerglycin GAG reporter\nkDa\n62\n49\nEPO N-glycan reporter\nE-cadherin O-Man reporter\na\nc d\nkDa\n49\n36\nb\n0 11 2,50,50 5 10 0,5 2,5 5 NSC255112 (\u03bcM) NSC80997 (\u03bcM) 10\nNaked Peptide O-Man -4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nLo g2\n(D M\nSO /N\nSC 80\n99 7)\nn = 155 n = 13\nFig. 4 | NSC80997 and NSC255112 globally remodel cellular glycosylation. a, b N-glycan analysis of an erythropoietin (EPO) reporter by western blot and MALDI-TOF analysis. a Western blot analysis of erythropoietin N-glycosylation reporter secreted by CHOWT cells treated 24h with 0\u201310 \u00b5M NSC80997 or NSC255112 detected by staining with anti-6xHis-tag antibody. b MALDI-TOF profiling of PNGaseF released N-glycans from erythropoietin reporter secreted by HEKWT cells treated with 10 \u00b5M NSC80997 or DMSO control. c Coomassie gel staining analysis of a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) serglycin reporter protein secreted\nby CHOWT cells treated for 24h with 10 \u00b5M of NSC80997, NSC255112 or DMSO control. d Proteomic analysis of E-cadherin tryptic digest purified from DMSO (TMT-129C channel) or NSC80997 (TMT-130N channel) treated HEKWT cells.

The TMTC1-4 directing O-mannosylation of the cadherin superfamily occurs in the ER54,55, and all N-glycosylation steps located in the ER were also largely unaffected. Thus, the two compounds selectively affect glycosylation steps that occur in the Golgi, and interestingly mainly the steps involved in general elaboration of glycan structures and not the early N-glycan branching steps orchestrated by the MGATs56 and to a lesser extend the initiation step of GalNAc-typeO-glycosylation orchestrated by the GalNAc-T isoenzymes21 that are both believed to occur from the earliest cis-Golgi stacks. Importantly, the effects on glycosylation were characterized with secreted reporter glycoproteins as well as lectin/ antibody labeling of non-permeabilized cells demonstrating that the compounds did not affect the general transport and secretion of proteins.\nNSC80997 and NSC255112 trigger reversible fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus Since both identified compounds impaired glycosylation steps in the Golgi apparatus, we tested their effect on the Golgi structure in HeLa cells. Treatment with NSC80997 induced fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, as visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against the cis/medial-Golgi marker giantin (Fig. 5a). A similar phenotype was observed 24 h after treatment with NSC255112 (Fig. 5c). The structure of the trans-Golgi area was also affected, as shown by probing sialylation in the medial/trans-Golgi system using alkyne-tagged sialic acid (Ac5SiaNPoc)\n57 by click chemistry and staining with antibodies directed against the trans-Golgi marker TGN46 (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). The effects of both compoundswere reversible, as their removal from the culture medium resulted in re-assembly of the Golgi within 24 h (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5B). Treatment with NSC80997 resulted in a loss of the staining for the Golgi-resident glycosyltransferase GalNAc-T1 (UH3, 4D8)58 (Supplementary Fig. 5A) without affecting the total protein level of another Golgi glycosyltransferase GalNAc-T2 as evaluated by western blot analysis of total cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. 5C). This suggests that the loss of localized Golgi staining of glycosyltransferase proteins is due to redistribution rather than loss of protein in local concentrations below the detection limit of immunocytology with the used mAbs. Accordingly, proteomics analysis of HEKWT cells treated for 24 h with 10 \u00b5M NSC80997 showed limited changes in the proteome compared to DMSO-treated control cells (Supplementary Fig. 5D).\nDepletion of HSP90 has previously linked to fragmentation of the Golgi by decreased levels of the microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), which is important for microtubule acetylation and stabilization59,60. Given the hypothesis that effects of the identified compounds could be mediated through HSP90, we tested microtubule acetylation in HeLa cells after treatment with NSC80997 and observed no change in the level of acetylated or total tubulin in treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 5E). Similarly, we observed no effect on the NSC80997-mediated induction of cell surface Tn expression by pretreatment or co-treatment with Trichostatin-A (TSA), which has been reported to promote microtubule acetylation60,61 (Supplementary Fig. 5F). Thus, while a compelling target, these results suggest that the effects of the inhibitors are not the result of decreased microtubule acetylation mediated through HSP90.\nNSC80997 and NSC255112 function differently than Brefeldin A To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of NSC80997, cells were transiently transfected with mScarlet-Giantin, and imaged using spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Treatment with NSC80997\nrevealed that the Golgi fragmentation was preceded by substantial degree of tubulation, which in principle could be reminiscent of the well-established effect of BFA (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6A)14,62. However, further analysis of the changes in Golgi-morphology over time showed that while BFA induces the redistribution of the Golgi apparatus into the ER, NSC80997 only leads to dispersion of the Golgi markers (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 6A, Supplementary Movies 1\u20133), clearly indicating a different mechanism of action. This conclusion is further supported by three lines of additional evidence. First, \u03b2COP, a downstream target of BFA, did not dissociate from theGolgi apparatus upon treatment with NSC8099714 (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6B). Second, BFA treatment completely abrogated secretion of the MUC1 reporter from HEKWT cells at 0.5 \u03bcM, whereas NSC80997 clearly did not, in agreement with the cell-based screening strategy relying on secreted reporters (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Finally, BFA treatment did not lead to induction of Tn antigen expression on the cell surface at any concentration tested, while NSC80997 strongly induced Tn cell surface expression starting from 1 \u00b5M (Supplementary Fig. 6D).\nNSC80997 and NSC255112 do not affect transport and secretion of glycoproteins BFA is known to rapidly affect the Golgi and block transport of glycoproteins out of the ER (Fig. 5d), while induction of surface expression of Tn by NSC80997 and NSC255112 was detectable after 6 h and peaking at 18\u201324 h (Fig. 2e). It is challenging to study secretion of reporter glycoproteins in time-course experiments given the inherent delay in turnover of glycoproteins and that sufficient time is needed to produce detectable signal. In the experiments presented in Figs. 1\u20134 and Supplementary Figs. 1\u20133 the analyses of secreted glycoprotein reporters were based on total accumulated material 24 h after start of drug treatments. To better distinguish the effects of the drug treatments on secretion and glycosylation of reporters we introduced a wash-out 4 h after first exposure to the drugs followed by 24 h continued incubation in the presence of the compounds (Supplementary Fig. 6C). This demonstrated that NSC80997 at low concentrations markedly affected glycosylation at 0.5 \u00b5M, while the previous analysis without the wash-out appeared to indicate comparative effects only at 5\u03bcM (Fig. 1f, e), due to accumulation of secreted reporters before and after the effect of NSC80997. The comparative analysis of BFA clearly confirms the effect of the wash-out and shows that BFA at 0.5 \u03bcM completely blocks secretion (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Clearly, the same challenge applies to changes of cell surface glycoproteins, where slow turnover of membrane glycoproteins adds to the complexity and extended time of treatment at lower concentrations of inhibitor compounds could be used for optimal effects without affecting cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 6D, E). In conclusion, the NSC80997 and NSC255112 compounds are unique tools that can be used at ranges of concentrations (0.5-5 \u00b5M) to block elaborated glycosylation features on cell surface and secreted glycoproteins.\nInduction of aberrant truncated cancer-associated O-glycans by NSC80997 enhances ADCC Aberrant O-glycosylation such as expression of the truncated Tn antigen is commonly observed in different cancer types29,63, and aberrant Tn O-glycopeptide epitopes can elicit high-affinity mAbs64\u201366. Thus, Tn-MUC1 is a promising target currently explored in cancer immunotherapies by mAbs or CAR-T cells with high affinity for this mucin glycoform66\u201368. We examined the induction of Tn-MUC1 by NSC80997 in cells stably expressing membrane anchored MUC1 reporter (HEKMUC1). Tn-MUC1 was induced and detected with mAb 5E5 directed against Tn-MUC165,68 (Fig. 6a). In parallel, we also tested a type I membrane protein FXYD5, known as dysadherin endogenously expressed by HEKWT cells, with a recently established Tn-FXYD5 mAb (6C5)64 and a mAb directed to the FXYD5 protein (NCC-M53)69.

Similarly, NSC80997 induced 6C5 binding to HEK293WT cells, but not to HEK293KO FXYD5 cells, while NCC-M53 binding remained unaltered (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7A). Noteworthy, pulsing the cells with 10 \u00b5MNSC80997 for 1\u20134h was sufficient to obtain high Tn expression 24 h later (Supplementary Fig. 7B). We then used HEKMUC1 cells pulsed for 4 h with 10 \u00b5M NSC80997 or DMSO control and performed an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. HEKMUC1 target cells were co-cultured with different ratios of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors in the presence of 5E5 or isotype control antibody (Fig. 6b). Pre-treatment of the HEKMUC1 target cells with NSC80997 significantly triggered ADCC for 5E5 and 6C5 mAbs increasing with PBLs ratios, but not with an irrelevant isotypematched mAb (Fig. 6c). Similar results were observed for the general Tn hapten specific mAb 1E3 (Supplementary Fig. 7C). These findings suggest that NSC80997may be useful for boosting Tn antigen expression in cancer cells to enhance efficacy of immunotherapies targeting Tn glycoproteins.\nReduction of cell surface heparan sulfate by NSC80997 treatment inhibits binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 Widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently amajor health challenge worldwide, causing serious clinical morbidity and mortality70. Recent studies have provided evidence that cellular heparan sulfate (HS) is a necessary co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by mediating binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and enzymatic degradation of HS blocks the spike protein binding and viral infection71. Since NSC80997 treatment reduced GAG formation on recombinant expressed Serglycin (Fig. 4c), we tested the potential effects of this compound on SARS-CoV-2 cell binding and virus entry. We first confirmed that NSC80997 blocked GAG biosynthesis by disaccharide HPLC analysis of isolated GAGs from total cell lysates of HEKWT cells treatedwith 10 \u00b5MNSC80997 for 24 h.Weobserved a clear reduction in the amount of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) (Supplementary Fig. 8). Next, we found that treatment of Vero E6 and A549 cells with >5 \u00b5M of NSC80997 reduced surface binding of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to similar levels as found with treatment by heparinase (Fig. 7a).Moreover, we assessed the effects of NSC80997 treatment in an in vitro infection model based on a pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein that induces luciferase expression upon infection of Vero E6 cells71,72. Robust luciferase induction was observed in control-treated Vero E6 cells upon infection, and treatment with 10 \u00b5M of NSC80997 almost completely abrogated this (Fig. 7b). Lastly, we tested authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection using strain USA-WA1/ 2020. Infection of Vero-TMPRSS2 (Vero E6 cells stably expressing the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2), Caco-2, and Huh-7.5 cells was monitored by staining of the cells with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein. We observed robust reduction in viral infection upon treatment with increasing concentrations of NSC80997 in all cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 4.3 \u00b5M for Caco-2 to 1.4 \u00b5M for Vero-TMPRSS2 and Huh-7.5 cells (Fig. 7c).\nDM SO\n1 2,5 5 10 20 0\n20000\n40000\n60000\nM F\nI[ ar\nb .u\nn its\n]\nNSC80997 [\u00b5M]\nHEKWT HEKMUC1\nDM SO\n1 2,5 5 10 20 0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\nM F\nI[ ar\nb .u\nn its\n]\nNSC80997 [\u00b5M]\nHEKWT HEKKO FXYD5\na b c Membrane MUC1\nHEKWT cells\nNSC80997 (10\u00b5M) or DMSO control treatment\n4 h\nChange to fresh media\nAddition of PBLs and mAbs\nCell viability stain\nFlow Cytometry\n24 h\n5E5 (Tn-MUC1)\n6C5 (Tn-FXYD5) 6C5 (Tn-FXYD5)\n5E5 (Tn-MUC1)\nFig. 6 | NSC80997 boosts antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of Tn-specific mAbs 6C5 and 5E5. a Cell surface binding of mAbs 5E5 (top) and 6C5 (bottom) to HEKWT, HEKKO FXYD5 cells, and HEKWT cells stably expressing membrane MUC1 reporter protein (HEKMUC1) treated with increasing concentrations of NSC80997 for 24h.

            "text": "In this study, we employed glycoengineered cells with stable secretion of tailored glycoprotein reporters for robust screening of a smallmolecule library and discovery of inhibitors of glycosylation. We designed and employed two cell-based assay designs for discovery of selective inhibitors of the GalNAc-T11 (initiation of O-glycosylation) and C1GalT1 (core1 extension of O-glycosylation) glycosyltransferases. We tested a relatively small available compound library that has been optimized for cell-based screening and identified two distinct molecules serving as broad inhibitors of Golgi-located glycosylation processes. We did not identify selective inhibitors of the GalNAc-T11 and C1GalT1 enzymes within the limited compound library, but we validated the assay design with independent testing of consecutive biosynthetic steps, and further testing of larger compound libraries is clearly warranted. We did, however, identify two potent compounds, NSC80997 and NSC255112, that broadly inhibited glycosylation steps located to the Golgi including those involved in elaborating O-glycans, N-glycans and glycosaminoglycans. The NSC80997 and NSC255112 compounds induced reversibleGolgi fragmentationwithin a fewhours of treatment, but they did not cause redistribution of Golgi components into the ER and most importantly they did not affect transport\nand secretion of glycoproteins as found with the commonly used Golgi-disrupting agent BFA. These inhibitors of Golgi glycosylation provide new tools to study the role of elaborated glycosylation features in cells at the cell surface and in secretion.\nA major limitation for discovery of selective inhibitors of glycosyltransferases suitable for in vivo studies is the lack of robust screening systems capable of discerning specificity and crossreactivity of inhibitors for individual glycosyltransferases and in particular members of large isoenzyme families2,37. Linstedt and colleagues27,37 solved this challenge with bioassays reporting the cellular functions of several GalNAc-T isoenzymes, but this design is not universally applicable to all GalNAc-T isoenzymes or glycosyltransferases in general. We have developed engineered cell libraries with combinatorial KO/KI of glycosyltransferases in an array-able format to dissect the biosynthesis and genetic regulation of all types of cellular glycosylation38\u201340,43,52,73\u201375, and these cell-based arrays provide screening platforms for glycosylation inhibitors. The engineered cells enable production of secreted glycoprotein reporters with customdesigned glycans that can inform of how inhibitors affect highly specific steps in protein glycosylation. Here, we originally aimed to demonstrate thepotential of this platformbydeveloping a cell assay to probe for specific inhibitors of the GalNAc-T11 isoform (Fig. 1a, upper part), and this illustrated the challenges with cell assays and highlighted the necessity to co-screen for broader effects on glycosylation. To meet the latter, we developed a cell assay that broadly probes for GalNAc-T isoenzymes using parts of theMUC1mucin substrate (Fig. 1a,\na b\nc\nVero-E6 A549\nFig. 7 | Reduction of cellular heparan sulfate by NSC80997 treatment inhibits binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2. a Cell surface binding of recombinant SARSCoV-2 spike protein to Vero-E6 (left) and A549 (right) cells treated with increasing concentrations of NSC80997 or DMSO control for 24 h or after heparinase treatment (HSase).

The average values from each experiment were used to calculate the IC50 values and are shown as relative infection and cell counts compared to control, respectively.

Intriguingly, we identified two lead compounds that broadly abrogate elaboration of glycans in theGolgi apparatuswithout affecting protein secretion. The compound library was limited in size and future screening with larger compound libraries may lead tomore selective inhibitors. However, the study clearly illustrates the potential of the cell-based array platform to evaluate and dissect effects of inhibitors on glycosyltransferase isoenzymes and individual biosynthetic steps in different glycosylation pathways.\nThe two compounds we did identify within the limited library, NSC80997 and NSC255112, however, turned out to have interesting properties with wide applicability as reversible inhibitors of elaborate glycan features such as galactosylation and sialylation associated with different types of glycoproteins and other glycoconjugates. Although structurally different, we found that both compounds readily and reversibly abrogated elongation of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation, processing of complex type N-glycans after the key branching step, and the biosynthesis of GAG chains. The biosynthetic steps affected are all predicted to occur in the Golgi, while glycosylation located in ER and early Golgi was unaffected. Treatment of HEK cells with these compounds did not affect secretion and did not appear to induce significant changes in the overall proteome, but immunocytology (and metabolic labeling of sialylation) demonstrated that Golgi-resident proteins dispersed within 1-2 h without being lost (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). These effects were reversible upon removal of inhibitors, and the induction/recovery kinetics of the Golgi fragmentation and effects on reporter and surface glycosylation were highly similar, suggesting that the Golgi disruption directly led to the effects observed on protein glycosylation. Aberrant glycosylation is a common feature found in cells with fragmented Golgi apparatus including in cancer cells76\u201379.\nGalNAc-Ts are generally found throughout the Golgi stacks80 and initiate O-glycosylation after the protein folding in ER. However, it should be noted that relocation of GalNAc-Ts to ER has been reported as a featureof cancer cells and causeof the characteristic expressionof truncated Tn O-glycans in cancer81. We found that lower doses of the inhibitors abrogatedO-glycan elongation but not the initiation leading to accumulationof TnO-glycans (Fig. 1e) couldpotentially suggest that the inhibitors partly redistributed GalNAc-Ts to ER although this was not apparent from the immunocytology results. However, given that the N-glycan branching step by the MGATs was not affected substantially, it is more likely that the inhibitors have lower effects on glycosylation steps performed in the early cis-Golgi stacks.\nNSC80997 is a derivate of cortivazol, a synthetic steroid that acts as high-affinity ligand for the GR82\u201384, and these share the four ring (AD) steroid structure and a phenylpyrazol group at the A-ring (Fig. 3a). This bulky group has been shown to induce structural changes in the GR ligand-binding pocket creating additional interactions between cortivazol and theGR and enhancing the binding affinity 20\u201350 times compared to dexamethasone49,85,86. Because of this increased binding affinity, cortivazol was assessed in clinical trials for corticosteroidmediated pain relief after intra-articular, periarticular, or epidural injection without clear outcome or clear adverse effects, and apparently the use and production was terminated in 201787,88. NSC255112 is a derivate of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin. HSP90 and other proteins including HSP70 and FKBP4 interact with GR and retain GR in the cytoplasm51,89. Binding of a ligand releases the GR from HSP90 and allows for traffic to the nucleus and transcriptional regulation of inflammatory genes51,90. Binding of NSC80997 to theGR or inhibition of HSP90 by NSC255112 thus could potentially release the GR. We did observe shuttling of the GR to the nucleus after treatment with high and low concentrations of both compounds (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 3A), however, other GR steroid ligands tested did not show the same effects on glycosylation as NSC80997 and NSC255112. Moreover, KO of the GR gene did not abolish the effects of the inhibitor compounds, and treating cells\npretreated with the high-affinity GR antagonist mifepristone also did not affect the inhibition (Fig. 3c, d). These results indicate that NSC80997 and NSC255112 affect Golgi glycosylation largely independent of the GR pathway.\nNotably, while the NSC255112 analog geldanamycin is cytotoxic, we noticed induction of Tn in cells treated with other known HSP90 inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. 3D), and inhibition and depletion of HSP90 have previously been linked to Golgi fragmentation59,60. HSP90 binds the microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), which is essential for maintaining microtubule acetylation and stabilization. HSP90 depletion leads to decreased levels ofMAP4 and thus fragmentation of the Golgi system, but effects on glycosylation have not been reported previously60. However, we observed no reduction in the levels of acetylated tubulin upon treatment with NSC80997, suggesting that the microtubule network remains intact. A study has proposed that loss of HSP90 leads to Golgi fragmentation mediated by non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA)/core2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-M (C2GnTM, GCNT3) complex formation59. Here, we were unable to establish viable HEK293 cells with KO of HSP90. Reduction of NSC80997 to NSC80997-KR decreased the Tn induction effect twofold (Fig. 3e, f). Further dissection of these compounds is needed to more specifically reveal the functional group(s) that mediate the Golgi fragmentation and abrogation of glycan elaboration.\nWe ruled out that NSC80997 andNSC255112 act like BFA91. First of all, these compounds do not impair protein secretion (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Secondly, because they induce fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus rather than the redistribution of Golgi into the ER induced by BFA (Fig. 5e, g and Supplementary Fig. 6)92. Interestingly, this process involves the initial formation of short tubules that later fragment into smaller structures and disperse throughout the cytoplasm62. Thirdly, the compounds do not affect the recruitment of the coatomer component \u03b2-COP, and this is a key step for the initiation of the BFAdependent tubulation93. The lack of effect on the microtubules rules out that the fragmentation is the result of thewell-established effect of microtubule-disrupting agents on the Golgi apparatus94. Therefore, the effect of the NSC80997 and NSC255112 compounds on the Golgi structure is mediated by a completely different mechanism(s), which will require extensive efforts to be fully dissected.\nThe finding that NSC80997 and NSC255112 rapidly and reversibly disrupts cellular glycosylation without substantially altering cell viability and capacity for secretion of recombinant glycoproteins makes these compounds highly attractive for use to probe whether proteins are glycosylated and explore functions of glycoproteins at the cell surface. To illustrate this, we demonstrated applications related to cancer immunotherapy and viral infections. Thus, pulsing target cells with the inhibitor compounds induced the truncated cancerassociated O-glycan Tn29,63, which triggered ADCC activity by mAbs directed to Tn-glycopeptide epitopes in MUC1 and FXYD5 (Fig. 6c). Such antibodies are promising for therapeutic interventions58,84 and appropriate cell lines to study their ADCC activity are missing66. We also demonstrated the use of the inhibitor compounds to explore the effect of glycosylation on SARS-CoV-2 infection, validating the importance of HS in the binding and infection (Fig. 7). The NSC80997 and NSC255112 compounds may become useful reagents to reversibly interfere with Golgi glycosylation for probing the contribution of elaborated glycans in biological interactions.\nIn summary, we developed an elaborate cell-based assay for screening of GalNAc-T isoenzymes inhibitors, and although our initial screening of a small compound library did not identify specific inhibitors the assay was validated and can be used for further screening of larger compound libraries. We did identify two potent reversible inhibitors that selectively affect Golgi-located glycosylation without affecting viability and secretion, and these compounds should be widely applicable and simple tools to investigate the role of glycosylation.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:948 12"

Briefly, 100mL of luciferin lysis solution was added to the cells and incubated for 5min at room temperature. The solution was transferred to a black 96-well plate and luminescence was detected using an EnSpire multimodal plate reader (Perkin Elmer).\nInfection by authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, #NR-52281) was propagated on Caco-2 cells and infectious units quantified by focus forming assay using TMPRSS2-Vero cells. Cells in 96-well plates were treated with increasing concentrations of NSC80997 for 24 h and infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C in media containing dilutions of NSC80997. Multiplicities of infection (MOI) used were 1 for Caco-2 and Huh7.5 and 0.5 for TMPRSS2-Vero. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30min at room temp and then washed with PBS. Cellswerepermeabilizedwith PBS, 1%BSA, 0.1%Triton-X-100 and stained with anti-Nucleocapsid antibody (GeneTex GTX135357)\nfollowed by AlexaFluor 594 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Sytox Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as a nuclear counterstain. Images of 5 fields per well were acquired at 10x magnification in the Incucyte S3 (Sartorius), and images were analyzed for nuclei count and percent infection using the software tools onboard the Incucyte. Percent infection and cell viability were normalized to DMSO-treated infectedwells. Allworkwith SARS-CoV-2was conducted in Biosafety Level-3 conditions at theUniversity of California SanDiego following the guidelines approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee."
