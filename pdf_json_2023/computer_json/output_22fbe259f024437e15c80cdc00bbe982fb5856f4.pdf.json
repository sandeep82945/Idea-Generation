    "abstractText": "Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI time series with maternal hyperoxia can assess placental oxygenation and function. Measuring precise BOLD changes in the placenta requires accurate temporal placental segmentation and is confounded by fetal and maternal motion, contractions, and hyperoxia-induced intensity changes. Current BOLD placenta segmentation methods warp a manually annotated subject-specific template to the entire time series. However, as the placenta is a thin, elongated, and highly non-rigid organ subject to large deformations and obfuscated edges, existing work cannot accurately segment the placental shape, especially near boundaries. In this work, we propose a machine learning segmentation framework for placental BOLD MRI and apply it to segmenting each volume in a time series. We use a placental-boundary weighted loss formulation and perform a comprehensive evaluation across several popular segmentation objectives. Our model is trained and tested on a cohort of 91 subjects containing healthy fetuses, fetuses with fetal growth restriction, and mothers with high BMI. Biomedically, our model performs reliably in segmenting volumes in both normoxic and hyperoxic points in the BOLD time series. We further find that boundary-weighting increases placental segmentation performance by 8.3% and 6.0% Dice coefficient for the cross-entropy and signed distance transform objectives, respectively.",

            "text": "Biomedical motivation. The placenta delivers oxygen and nutrients to support fetal growth. Placental dysfunction causes pregnancy complications that affect fetal development, leading to a critical need to assess placental function in vivo. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI images oxygen transport within the placenta (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2013; Abaci Turk et al., 2019) and has emerged as a promising tool to non-invasively study placental function. Temporal analysis of BOLD MRI with maternal oxygen administration can identify contractions (Abaci Turk et al., 2020; Sinding et al., 2016), biomarkers of fetal growth restriction (Luo et al., 2017; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015), predict placental age (Pietsch et al., 2021), and can study congenital heart disease (You et al., 2020; Steinweg et al., 2021).\nChallenges and current approaches. Despite its importance for many downstream clinical research tasks, placental segmentation is often performed manually and can take a significant amount of time, even for a trained expert. For temporal BOLD MRI studies, manual segmentation is rendered more challenging due to the sheer number of MRI scans acquired and rapid signal changes due to common experimental designs. For example, maternal oxygenation experiments acquire several hundred whole-uterus MRI scans to observe signal changes in three stages: normoxia (baseline), hyperoxia, and return to normoxia. During the hyperoxic stage, BOLD signals increase rapidly, giving the placenta a hyperintense appearance. Further, placental shape undergoes large deformation caused by maternal breathing, contractions, and fetal movements which are typically stronger during hyperoxia (You et al., 2015), as illustrated in Figure 1.\nCurrent practice analyzes BOLD signals with respect to a template volume. Deformable registration of all volumes in the time series to the template is performed to enable spatiotemporal analysis (Abaci Turk et al., 2017; You et al., 2015; Chi et al., 2023). However, template-to-volume registration within the uterus can lead to large errors, necessitating outlier detection and possibly rejecting a significant number of volumes (Abaci Turk et al., 2017; You et al., 2015). These registration difficulties arise from the placenta, fetus, and mother being subject to highly disparate deformation models along the temporal sequence. For example, the fetus undergoes piecewise-rigid motion whereas the placenta deforms highly non-rigidly, thus precluding the direct use of standard registration frameworks such as ANTs (Tustison et al., 2020) and VoxelMorph (Balakrishnan et al., 2019) on temporal whole-uterus images.\nContributions. To address these challenges, we propose a deep network framework to automatically segment the placenta in BOLD MRI time series. Our model is trained on volumes obtained during the normoxic and hyperoxic phases from each patient so as to capture placental shape and appearance variability during maternal oxygenation. As the placenta is a thin and elongated organ, we use a boundary-weighted formulation (parameterized by thresholded signed distance function approximations) of several popular region and/or shape-based segmentation objectives which yield significant gains in both placental segmentation accuracy and surface overlap over their non-boundary-weighted equivalents. Our model demonstrates consistency in the predicted segmentation label maps on a large dataset of unseen BOLD MRI and generalizes to a broad range of gestational ages and pregnancy conditions, thus enabling improved non-invasive pregnancy studies via maternal\noxygenation. Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility of our method for clinical research, we illustrate an application based on relative BOLD signal increases.\nThis paper extends our preliminary analysis of placental segmentation (Abulnaga et al., 2022b) first presented at the International Workshop on Perinatal, Preterm and Paediatric Image Analysis held in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2022. We expand on it by providing more motivation for the work in Section 1 and relevant context for boundary-weighted and shape-aware segmentation losses in Section 2. In our methods in Section 3, we provide additional details, illustrations, and justification for the chosen additive boundary-weighted loss formulation. We then experiment with several additional shape-aware and boundary-weighted loss functions in our experiments (Section 4) alongside introducing qualitative measures of temporal segmentation performance and providing failure cases. Lastly, we provide a substantially expanded discussion of our work in Section 5 which overviews its place in the shape-aware segmentation literature and its utility for clinical research."

            "text": "Placenta segmentation in structural MRI. Machine learning segmentation models for the placenta have been previously proposed and include both semi-automatic (Wang et al., 2015) and automatic (Alansary et al., 2016; Torrents-Barrena et al., 2019a; Pietsch et al., 2021; Specktor-Fadida et al., 2021) approaches. While semi-automatic methods have achieved success in predicting segmentation label maps with high accuracy, these approaches are infeasible for segmenting BOLDMRI time series due to the large number of volumes that would require manual annotation. The majority of automatic methods focus on segmentation in structural images as opposed to BOLD MRI as in this work. For example, Alansary et al. (2016) proposed a model for segmenting T2-weighted (T2w) images based on a 3D CNN followed by a dense CRF for segmentation refinement and validated it on a singleton cohort that included patients with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Torrents-Barrena et al. (2019a) developed a segmentation framework based on super-resolution and a support vector machine and validated it using a singleton and twin cohort of T2w MRI. Specktor-Fadida et al. (2021) focused on transferring segmentation networks across MRI sequences using\na self-training model yielding successful segmentation of steady-state precession MRI sequences. For a detailed treatment of fetal MRI segmentation, we refer the reader to the survey by Torrents-Barrena et al. (2019b).\nPlacenta segmentation in BOLD MRI. BOLD MR images of the placenta differ greatly from anatomical images, as BOLD images have lower in-plane resolution and the contrast between the placental boundary and surrounding anatomy is less pronounced. Anatomical images may also benefit from super-resolution approaches to increase SNR in the acquired image (Uus et al., 2020). Pietsch et al. (2021) are the first to consider placental segmentation in functional MRI. They proposed a 2D patch-based U-Net model for functional image segmentation and demonstrated a successful application of age prediction using the estimated T2* values. They focused on a cohort of singleton subjects and demonstrated successful applications to abnormal pregnancy conditions including preeclampsia. In contrast to their approach that segments derived T2* maps, we evaluate our segmentation model on BOLD MRI time series. Furthermore, our 3D model operates on the entire volume rather than patches, thereby helping to better resolve the boundaries of the placenta.\nBoundary-weighted segmentation objectives. Popular supervised segmentation losses such as cross-entropy underperform in the presence of highly imbalanced classes common in radiology volumes. As the interface between organs can be obfuscated by motionrelated artifacts and/or isointense appearance, strongly penalizing incorrect predictions near the boundary has been demonstrated to improve segmentation performance across several biomedical applications (Ma et al., 2021). For example, Kervadec et al. (2021) and Zhang et al. (2020) implemented distance metrics on organ contour predictions in addition to region-based losses such as soft Dice to improve performance. In parallel, several works regress ground truth distance transforms which are strongly weighted near the organ boundary (Hoopes et al., 2022). As illustrative examples, Huang et al. (2021) regressed ground truth distance maps that are normalized using the Heaviside function to penalize nearboundary misclassifications, while Karimi and Salcudean (2019) proposed a soft-Hausdorff distance loss parameterized by distance transforms. Lastly, the boundary weighting formulation we use is most similar to that of Caliva et al. (2019), wherein a thresholded signed distance transform is used to upweigh boundary neighborhoods in region-based losses."

Given a ground truth placental label map y, we denote its boundary as \u2202y. We use a signed distance function fy(x) that measures the signed distance, d(x, \u2202y), of voxel x \u2208 R3 to the boundary, where fy(x) > 0 when inside of the placenta and fy(x) < 0 when outside. The boundary weighting is additive for voxels within \u03b4-distance of \u2202y,\nw\u03b4(x) =  w1 if 0 \u2264 fy(x) < \u03b4, w2 if \u2212 \u03b4 < fy(x) < 0, 0 otherwise.\n(1)\nThe weighted loss Lw is then,\nLw (x) = L (x) [wc (x) + w\u03b4 (x)] , (2)\nwhere wc(x) is a per-voxel class weighting.

(2019). Many of these use a decaying weight for voxels further from the boundary, while we use a constant weighting. For computational efficiency, rather than computing fy(x) for all voxels x as in Caliva et al. (2019), we approximate the region of distance \u00b1\u03b4 from \u2202y using convolutional kernels. To find voxels x with |fy(x)| < \u03b4, we estimate a 2\u03b4-wide boundary by an average pooling filter on y with kernel size K and take the smoothed outputs to lie in the boundary. A larger K produces a wider boundary, penalizing more misclassified voxels. See Figure 2 for an illustration. Computing the boundary using a convolution operator is advantageous as it does not require computing the signed distance transform directly, which is computationally expensive and bottlenecks deep network training."

Data were collected from 91 subjects of which 78 were singleton pregnancies (gestational age (GA) at MRI scan of 23 weeks (wk), 5 days (d) to 37wk6d), and 13 were monochorionicdiamniotic (Mo-Di) twins (GA at MRI scan of 27wk5d \u2013 34wk5d). Of these, 63 pregnancies were controls, 16 had fetal growth restriction (FGR), and 12 had high maternal body mass index (BMI, BMI > 30). Obstetrical ultrasound was used to classify subjects with FGR. For singleton subjects, FGR classification was done based on having fetuses with estimated weight less than the 10th percentile. For twin subjects, FGR classification was determined by monochorionicity and discordance in the estimated fetal weight by growth restriction (<10th percentile) in one or both fetuses; and/or ii) growth discordance (\u2265 20%) between fetuses. Table 1 shows patient demographics and GA ranges per group.\nMRI BOLD scans were acquired on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner (GRE-EPI, interleaved with 3mm isotropic voxels, TR = 5.8\u20138s, TE = 32\u2212 47 ms, FA = 90\u25e6). To eliminate intravolume motion artifacts, we split the acquired interleaved volumes into two separate volumes with spacing 3\u00d73\u00d76mm, then linearly interpolate to 3\u00d73\u00d73mm. In our analysis, we only consider one of two split volumes, as the signals are redundant between pairs. Maternal oxygen supply was alternated during the BOLD acquisition via a nonrebreathing facial mask to have three 10-minute or 5-minute consecutive episodes: 1. normoxia (21% O2), 2. hyperoxia (100% O2, 15L/min), and 3. a return to normoxia (21% O2).\nTo generate training data, the placenta was manually segmented by a trained observer. Each BOLD MRI time series had 1 to 6 manual segmentations, yielding a total of 176 ground truth labels. The data was then split into training, validation, and test sets: (65%/15%/20%: 63/11/17 subjects). Data was stratified to have proportional distributions of subjects with singleton and twin pregnancies, then to proportionally distribute healthy controls, subjects with FGR, and subjects with high BMI. Our test set had 15 singleton pregnancies and 2 twins. Of the singleton pregnancies, 12 were healthy controls, 1 had FGR, and 2 had high BMI. Both twin subjects had FGR. Our test set had a total of 31 labeled images, none of which were used before final evaluation.\nEach subject in the training set had up to Nl = 6 ground truth segmentations in the BOLD time series. To prevent bias in sampling images, we train by randomly sampling 1 of Nl ground truth segmentations for each subject. The length of one epoch is the number of subjects rather than the number of images. Subject-wise random sampling was used to reduce bias from subjects with more ground truth labels."

We measure similarity using the Dice score (Dice), the 95thpercentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and the Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD). To evaluate the feasibility of the produced segmentations for clinical research studying whole-organ signal changes, we evaluate the percentage error in the mean BOLD values between our prediction and the ground truth (BOLD error), defined as 100 \u00d7 |b\u0302 \u2212 b|/b, where b and b\u0302 denote the mean BOLD signal in the ground truth and in the predicted segmentation, respectively. As estimating whole-organ BOLD signal changes is an important clinical research task, this metric quantifies the appropriate error caused by using automatic placental segmentations.\nBenchmarked segmentation loss functions. We benchmark several popular loss functions and their boundary-weighted extensions to assess their performance on placental segmentation. We quantify improved performance using the boundary-weighting approach (Eq. 1) by comparing performance of the cross-entropy loss (LCE) and the signed distance transform (SDT) loss (LSDT) with their boundary-weighted counterparts (LBW\u2212CE, LBW\u2212SDT). The SDT loss poses segmentation as a regression problem and predicts the signed distance transformation to the placenta boundary. The loss LSDT computes the mean-squared error of the predicted SDT from ground truth (Hoopes et al., 2022). We also benchmark performance on the widely used soft Dice loss (LDice) (Milletari et al., 2016) and a boundary-weighted Focal loss (LBW\u2212Focal) with \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b3 = 2 (Lin et al., 2017). As segmentation often benefits from hybrid loss functions (Ma et al., 2021), we also evaluate various combinations of losses. Lastly, we evaluate two boundary-focused signed distancebased loss functions from Huang et al. (2021) (LShape) and from Karimi and Salcudean (2019) (LHD).\nConsistency with hyperoxia. We evaluate our model\u2019s sensitivity to oxygenation by comparing the accuracy of predictions in normoxia and hyperoxia for subjects with multiple ground truth annotations. We compute segmentation performance using metric m in normoxia (mnormoxia(yi, y\u0302i)), and in hyperoxia (mhyperoxia(yi, y\u0302i)), where mnormoxia(yi, y\u0302i) denotes the similarity using metric m of our predicted segmentation y\u0302i to the ground truth yi for subject i in normoxia. For the evaluation metric m, we use the Dice score, HD95, ASSD, and percentage BOLD error. To evaluate consistency with oxygenation, we compute the mean absolute error between segmentation performance in both oxygenation phases |mnormoxia (yi, y\u0302i)\u2212mhyperoxia (yi, y\u0302i)|. A low error indicates predicted segmentations are consistent with oxygenation changes in the placenta.\nTemporal consistency. We assess the consistency of our predictions by applying our model to all volumes in the BOLD time series of the test set. Since our volumes are acquired interleaved and split into two separate volumes, we apply our model to every second volume in the time series, yielding a mean of 111.7 \u00b1 45.3 volumes per subject. We measure consistency by comparing the Dice score between consecutive volumes. We qualitatively evaluate segmentation performance across the time series and visualize robustness to fetal motion and oxygenation change."

Both our best performing models trained using LBW\u2212CE and LBW\u2212Focal achieve a mean Dice score of 82.80, though LBW\u2212CE produces slightly lower variance. This model also achieves low relative BOLD error (4.11 \u00b1 3.0%), indicating that our model\u2019s segmentations are suitable for clinical research studies assessing whole-organ signal changes. Similar performance is achieved for the other loss functions. Our model also outperforms the two shape-based baselines LShape + LDice and LHD + LDice on all metrics, though performance improvements are not statistically significant. These shape-based baselines demonstrate less consistent performance as they have higher variance with outliers (Figure 3).\nThe boundary weighting improves the performance of several loss functions compared to their non-boundary weighted counterparts. Training the model with our boundary weighting results in a statistically significant increase in performance. When trained using LCE, we achieve a mean Dice of 82.5 with boundary weighting in the loss compared to 76.5 without. Similarly, for LSDT we achieve a mean Dice of 80.6 with boundary weighting compared to 76.1 without. However, training with an additive Dice loss improves this performance gap: LCE +LDice achieves a Dice of 81.4 compared to 82.8 for LBW\u2212CE, and LFocal +LDice achieves a Dice of 82.0 compared to 82.8 for LBW\u2212Focal + LDice. The boundary-weighting also improves mean performance of ASSD and BOLD error and demonstrates more narrow distributions of distortion with fewer outliers (see Figure 3.) Using only the first segmented volume of the BOLD MRI series in normoxia also results in a small drop in performance (LBW\u2212CE (Nl = 1)). Adding labeled examples from the hyperoxic phase helps generalization, as the placental shape and intensity patterns can change greatly.\nOur performance is consistent across pregnancy conditions, as we achieve Dice scores of (77.4, 88.1) on the two subjects with twin pregnancies, 82.8\u00b13.0 on the singletons (N= 15), 83.0\u00b1 5.4 on the FGR cohort (N=3), 82.6\u00b1 3.0 on the controls (N=12) and (80.6, 86.5) on the two BMI cases.\nOur model performs consistently well in the normoxic and hyperoxic phases. For the 5 subjects with ground truth segmentations in both the normoxia and hyperoxia, we achieve a mean absolute difference between predictions in normoxia and hyperoxia of 3.78 \u00b1 1.17 Dice, 3.15\u00b1 1.90mm HD95, 0.77\u00b1 0.16mm ASSD, and 3.21\u00b1 1.36% relative BOLD error. These results suggest that our model is robust to contrast changes in the placenta resulting from maternal hyperoxia, and can be used in studies quantifying oxygen transport in the organ. A larger number of subjects are needed to assess statistical significance.\nFigure 4 compares the predicted label maps with ground truth on 5 subjects with increasing Dice scores using the BW-CE model. The model accurately identifies the location of the placenta, but in the worst cases misses boundary details.\nBOLD Time Series Evaluation Figure 5 presents example predicted segmentations at multiple points in the BOLD MRI time series for 3 subjects. The predicted segmentations are robust to large fetal deformations and placental signal changes. Figure 6 (top) presents distributions of Dice score between predicted label maps of consecutive frames in the BOLD time series for all subjects in the test set. Distributions have high medians (Dice > 90) for all but one case, with high density at high Dice scores (Dice > 90). Dice differences are highly affected by fetal and maternal motion that cause placental deformation. We visually verified that modest drops in Dice (< 90) were mainly due to fetal motion, but 3 subjects had a small number of frames with large drops (Dice < 70) that were caused by errors in the produced label maps. Figure 6 (bottom) shows 3D models of failed segmentations from\ntwo subjects from frames with Dice < 70. Our model omitted parts of the placenta for Subject 9 and added a large region for Subject 15. In practice, these failures ocurred in a small number of frames, 6.8% of frames for Subject 9 and 0.45% of frames for Subject 15. Overall, predicted label maps are consistent between consecutive volumes of the MRI time series, achieving a Dice of 92.0\u00b1 1.7 and a BOLD difference of 2.1\u00b1 0.60%. The small differences between the relative mean-BOLD values suggest these produced segmentations may be suitable for research studies assessing placental function.\nAutomatic segmentation of each volume in BOLD MRI time series is advantageous as it can enable whole-organ spatiotemporal analysis without requiring inter-volume registration, which may fail under the presence of large motion. We illustrate a possible application of automatic placenta segmentation by investigating the percentage increase in BOLD signal in response to maternal hyperoxia. We calculate the percentage increase over the baseline period: \u2206b = |bH \u2212 bN |/bN , where bN denotes the mean BOLD signal over the baseline period, and bH denotes the mean of the signal in the last 10 frames of the hyperoxic period. Figure 7 shows a scatter plot of the hyperoxia response for all subjects in the test set and two examples of the BOLD signal time course in the produced placenta segmentation label maps. In the control subjects (N=12), we observe an increase of 10.2\u00b111.1%. The observed increase for the healthy controls is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated an increase of 12.6 \u00b1 5.4% (N=21) (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015) and from 5% to 20% throughout gestation (N=49) (Sinding et al., 2018)."

            "text": "We proposed a model to automatically segment the placenta in BOLD MRI time series and achieved close matching to ground truth labels with consistent performance in predicting segmentations in both the normoxic and hyperoxic phases. Our solution was developed to be resilient to the variability caused by large signal changes in the BOLD experiment protocol.\nShape-aware segmentation. Identification of the placental boundary is challenging as the organ is a thin and elongated structure with limited contrast with surrounding anatomy.\nIn this work, we emphasized these challenging aspects of placental shape during network training by using a simple additive boundary-weighted loss function. As hypothesized, boundary weighting significantly improved placenta segmentation performance when integrated with the popular cross-entropy and signed distance transform (SDT) losses as compared with their non-boundary weighted counterparts. We then performed an extensive evaluation over shape-based losses including our chosen formulation and the losses of Karimi and Salcudean (2019), and Huang et al. (2021) and found that our adopted loss outperforms others in several key aspects of placenta segmentation. Lastly, we broadly find that shape-based losses outperform losses without shape information (cross-entropy, Dice, and SDT losses), demonstrating that including shape information can aid in the identification of the placenta.\nUtility for clinical research. The main objective of this work was to develop a segmentation model to assess whole-organ signal changes in BOLD MRI time series. We achieve low BOLD error (4%) compared to ground truth with performance that is consistent across oxygenation period. Segmenting each volume in the BOLD MRI time series can be advantageous for clinical research assessing whole-organ temporal changes. We illustrated one possible study in assessing placental response during hyperoxia and observed an increase\nin signal intensity consistent with prior work. However, our cohort is limited, and several factors, including maternal position, gestational age, and contractions are covariates not considered. Producing segmentations that are resilient to placental oxygenation can also enable essential post-processing such as motion correction (Abaci Turk et al., 2017), reconstruction (Uus et al., 2020), and mapping to a standardized representation (Miao et al., 2017; Abulnaga et al., 2019, 2022a; Chi et al., 2023). These tasks are often essential in clinical research studies assessing placental function.\nWe provide access to our code and trained model for use in future clinical research studies. Our model is robust to gestational age, pregnancy condition, and oxygenation. Further, the model requires simple preprocessing and can be used with a variety of EPI scans. In this work however, we only trained and tested on isotropic MRI with TE=32\u221247 ms. It is unclear how well the model would work on scans with earlier GA, nonistropic images, or different imaging protocols.\nA limitation of relying only on segmentations is that they can only be used to quantify whole-organ signal changes, such as mean T2\u22c6 or mean BOLD increase. One is often interested in assessing functional differences within subregions of the placenta, for example across twins in Mo-Di pregnancies (Luo et al., 2017; Shnitzer et al., 2022), within vessels (TorrentsBarrena et al., 2019a), or across cotyledons (Dey et al., 2023). Localized analysis requires deformable registration (Abaci Turk et al., 2017) to track changes within these regions.\nHaving reliable segmentations for each point in the BOLD MRI time series can be used to improve registration, for example by treating segmentations as spatial priors. One may also consider methods that jointly learn registration and segmentation such as that of Xu and Niethammer (2019).\nComparison to prior work. The closest work to ours is that of Pietsch et al. (2021) that proposes a 2D U-Net based model to automatically segment the placenta in functional MRI (BOLD, T2\u22c6). They achieve a Dice of 58 on a cohort of 108 subjects of low- and high-risk singleton subjects of a wide GA range. Their performance was comparable to the inter-rater variability of two radiologists (Dice=68), which represents an upper limit. In contrast, we achieve a Dice of 82.8 on a cohort of singleton and twin subjects from healthy pregnancies, subjects with FGR, and subjects with high BMI. While comparing our work with that of Pietsch et al. (2021) provides context for our performance, direct comparison with this work is not feasible due to differences in data set size and patient demographics, imaging protocols, and MRI study design. An interesting direction of future work is to quantify the improvement in performance due to model design versus dataset composition.\nLimitations and Future Work. The main limitation of this work is the inability to quantify segmentation performance across the entire BOLD MRI study. While we demonstrated low absolute differences in predictions between normoxia and hyperoxia, we only had 5 subjects with ground truth images in multiple time points. We measured the consistency of consecutive predictions via Dice overlap and percentage BOLD differences. However, without correction for inter-frame placental deformation, the reported scores are subject to noise caused by motion. We performed visual quality control and found that for many subjects, modest drops in Dice (< 90), were often due to fetal motion displacing the placenta. In a small number of cases, we observed large drops (Dice < 70) that were caused by segmentation error (Figure 6 bottom). Since we apply the model to each volume in the time series independently, imaging artifacts, such as intensity and geometric artifacts, can affect the predicted segmentations.\nWe performed a comprehensive evaluation of several commonly used loss functions with and without our boundary weighting approach, and compared with shape-based baselines of two previous works: LShape of Huang et al. (2021) and LHD of Karimi and Salcudean (2019). While our boundary-weighting outperformed these loss functions, we observed that any shape-based loss improved performance over conventional loss functions (e.g. LCE, LDice), demonstrating the benefit in capturing the placenta boundary accurately. Additional loss functions exist that we did not compare with, such as the distance transform-based boundary loss of Kervadec et al. (2021), and the boundary contour-based loss functions of Specktor-Fadida et al. (2021) and Jurdi et al. (2021). Similar to our baselines, these loss functions are additive and aim to improve boundary capture and reduce the Hausdorff distance. Consequently, we do not expect significant differences over our proposed model, though future work should compare with additional baselines. Since our proposed loss is a boundary-based weighting rather than a separate loss function, it is versatile to be used with any existing loss.\nFuture work can investigate semi-supervised learning approaches to incorporate all unlabeled volumes in the BOLD MRI time series, increasing the variety of available data to potentially improve temporally consistent segmentation. As there are often a few hundred unlabeled volumes in each BOLD time series, these approaches can more accurately capture the rapid signal changes resulting from fetal motion and maternal oxygenation. The unlabeled data can be incorporated using non-rigid registration as in (Xu and Niethammer, 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Chartsias et al., 2020) or by using unsupervised shape-regularization losses (Mirikharaji and Hamarneh, 2018; Young et al., 2023)."
