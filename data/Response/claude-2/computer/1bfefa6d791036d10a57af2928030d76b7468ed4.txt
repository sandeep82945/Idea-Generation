 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on overcoming membrane locking in NURBS-based discretizations of Kirchhoff-Love shells using continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements:

1. Extend CAS elements to higher-order NURBS discretizations (cubic, quartic, etc.) of Kirchhoff-Love shells to investigate their performance for higher continuity basis functions.

2. Apply CAS elements to nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shells to see if they remain effective for geometrically nonlinear problems.

3. Investigate the performance of CAS elements for Reissner-Mindlin shells, which include transverse shear flexibility unlike Kirchhoff-Love shells.

4. Develop CAS elements for NURBS-based discretizations of other thin structures like beams, plates, and rods. Test their effectiveness at alleviating shear/membrane locking. 

5. Implement CAS elements in existing isogeometric analysis software packages and optimize code/data structures for efficiency. Perform large-scale engineering simulations to demonstrate applicability.
