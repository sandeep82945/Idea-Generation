    "abstractText": "In this study, the average power consumption of an electrode welding machine during the welding process was estimated using the features of the sound emitted during welding. First, the instantaneous values of electrode current and voltage and the sound emitted during the welding process were recorded simultaneously. The minimum, maximum, average, root mean square (RMS), and energy values of the sound data were found and feature extraction was performed, and the instantaneous power and average power values were calculated using the instantaneous current and voltage values. Three Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) using the sound features as inputs and average power values as outputs were created, and their results were compared. The average power values consumed during the welding process have been successfully estimated at a rate of 87-95%.

            "text": "VOLUME XX, 2017 1\nI. INTRODUCTION Electric arc welding (EAW) is a widely used industrial process that employs an electric arc to fuse the surfaces of metal parts by melting them [1]. The fundamental constituents of an EAW machine comprise a power source, a welding electrode, an arc-forming mechanism, and a welding wire. The power source generates an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece, the electrode melts and a weld pool is formed, the arc-forming mechanism regulates the distance between the electrode and the workpiece, and the welding wire conducts the current to the workpiece. EAW machines are widely used in various industrial applications due to their versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to join a wide range of metal types and thicknesses [2]. The power source can be direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), and the electrode can be consumable or non-consumable, depending on the specific application. The arc-forming mechanism is designed to\ncontrol the arc length and shape, which is crucial for the quality and consistency of the weld. The welding wire is used to transfer the current to the workpiece and can be made of various materials, such as steel, aluminum, or copper. The use of automation and advanced control systems in EAW machines has led to significant advancements in weld quality and efficiency [3]. The capacity to exert precise control over key parameters, including current, voltage, and travel speed, facilitates enhanced levels of consistency and reproducibility in the welding process. Additionally, the use of real-time monitoring and data analysis has enabled the detection and correction of potential issues during the welding process, leading to further improvements in quality and productivity.\nEAW machines are available in a wide range of types and configurations to suit different applications and requirements. The most common types include direct voltage (DC), vertical voltage, and low voltage machines\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Direct voltage machines produce a high voltage arc and are typically used for large parts, while vertical voltage machines produce a low voltage arc and are used for smaller parts. Low voltage machines are designed for high precision welding, often used in applications that require high accuracy and minimal distortion.\nEAW machines and technologies have undergone significant advancements over the years, particularly in the areas of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) [5]. The integration of advanced control systems and automation has led to improved quality and efficiency in welding processes. Additionally, the use of AI algorithms for realtime monitoring and data analysis has enabled the detection and correction of potential issues during welding, further enhancing the quality and productivity of EAW machines.\nThe features of EAW machines, such as current, voltage, and frequency, have undergone significant evolution over time. While older machines typically operated with low voltage and high current, modern machines are now able to work with high voltage and low current, resulting in more precise and higher quality welds [6]. Moreover, the frequency response of EAW machines has witnessed a remarkable advancement, with the advent of machines designed to function at diverse frequency amplitudes catering to the distinct application requirements.\nIn the literature, there are several methods used to analyze the sounds emitted from the electrodes of EAW machines to determine the quality of the welding process and the welding condition of the parts. These methods include frequency, amplitude, and spectrum analysis of the sounds emitted from the welding electrodes [7]-[10]. Frequency analysis is used to determine the speed and regularity of the welding process by measuring the number of periodically repetitive segments of sounds emitted from the welding electrodes. Amplitude analysis measures the strength of the sounds emitted from the welding electrodes and is used to determine the intensity of the welding process and the welding condition of the parts [11]. Spectrum analysis examines the frequency composition of the sounds emitted from the welding electrodes and is used to determine the quality of the welding process. A regular welding process will show a uniform distribution, while a distorted welding process will show an uneven distribution. The analysis of the sounds emitted from the welding electrodes is an important tool to monitor and improve the quality and efficiency of welding processes [12]-[15].\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to evaluate the effectiveness of EAW machines [16]-[24]. These methods are able to provide energy savings and increase the quality of the weld. For example, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System based approach, such as Estimating the Average Power of the Welding Process by Emitted Noise Based Approach, can be used to estimate the average power of the welding process from the noise during welding. II. WELDING AND SOFT ANALYSIS METHODS\nNon-destructive testing (NDT) methods such as X-ray, ultrasonic, and magnetic particle inspection are used in welding industrial analysis to assess the quality of the weld without causing any damage to the joint. These methods are particularly useful in detecting internal defects and imperfections in the weld that may not be visible to the naked eye. Fracture analysis is another important method used in welding industrial analysis. This method involves the examination of a failed weld to determine the cause of the failure and to develop strategies for preventing similar failures in the future.\nSimulation and modeling are increasingly being used in welding industrial analysis to predict the behavior of the welded joint under different conditions. These methods use computer simulations to model the welding process and to predict the properties of the welded joint.\nThe ANFIS method uses fuzzy logic and neural networks to model the relationship between input and output variables, making it a powerful tool for optimizing welding processes and improving the quality of the welded joint.\nWelding is a widely-used process in various industries and applications, and there are a variety of methods employed to achieve the desired results. Among the most common methods are:\nA. INDUSTRIAL WELDING METHODS Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding: This method involves the use of a welding wire and an inert gas, such as argon or helium, to shield the weld area from the surrounding atmosphere. The wire is fed through a gun and melts as it comes into contact with the workpiece, creating the weld. MIG welding is known for its fast and efficient nature, making it a popular choice for construction and industrial applications.\nTungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding: This method involves the use of a tungsten electrode and an inert gas, such as argon or helium, to shield the weld area from the surrounding atmosphere. The electrode is held by the welder and melts as it comes into contact with the workpiece, creating the weld. TIG welding is known for its precision and is often used in industrial applications where high accuracy is required.\nShielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW): This method involves the use of a consumable electrode and an inert gas, such as argon or helium, to shield the weld area from the surrounding atmosphere. The electrode melts as it comes into contact with the workpiece, creating the weld. SMAW is widely used in remote areas or harsh conditions where other welding methods are not feasible.\nDifferent welding methods are used depending on the application, materials, and conditions. The most common methods are MIG, TIG and Stick welding methods that used in different conditions and applications.\nGas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW); also known as Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding, is a method that uses a tungsten electrode and an arc-forming gas, such as argon or\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

This method is known for its precision and is frequently used in industrial applications.\nSubmerged Arc Welding (SAW): is another method that uses a welding wire, welding electrode, and arc-forming gas, such as argon or helium, to create the weld. This method is typically used for large parts and is often employed in construction and industrial applications.\nB. INDUSTRIAL WELDINGS ANALYSIS METHODS Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW): is a method that uses a welding electrode that contains flux. The flux is used to cause arcing and clean the oxides on the surface of the metal during welding [25]-[27].\nArtificial intelligence (AI): methods can be used to improve the quality of the weld. These methods include:\nClassification based on learning: This method is used to classify the quality of the source using audio and video data generated during the welding process. Learning-based classification plays an important role in determining and improving the quality of the welding process.\nDeep learning: Deep learning methods are used to predict the quality of the source using audio and video data generated during the welding process. Deep learning plays an important role in determining and improving the quality of the welding process.\nControl systems: AI control systems can be used to control the parameters of the welding process. This method can be used to improve the quality of the welding process.\nOptimization: AI optimization methods can be used to optimize the parameters of the welding process. This method can be used to improve the quality of the welding process.\nAnomaly detection: Artificial intelligence anomaly detection methods can detect malfunctions and malfunctions that may occur in the welding process. This method can be used to improve the quality of the welding process [28]-[32].\nIt is important to note that while there are many methods available to improve weld quality using AI, the success of the method varies depending on the material used. Therefore, it is essential to determine the appropriate method according to the characteristics of the project and the material."

            "text": "ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) is one of the most common hybrid models, which uses both Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) together. It has the flexibility of Fuzzy Logic, in addition to the classification ability of ANN, making it very popular for solving non-linear problems. Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and ANFIS are rule-based models, but it is not always easy to determine the rule base [33-36]. To overcome this problem, Jang proposed optimizing FIS parameters with ANN [4]. The ANN generates Takagi-Sugeno type if-then rules. The if-then rules for a simple Sugeno type fuzzy\nmodel are given below, where x and y represent two inputs [33-37].\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nif i x is X and y is Y then f p x q y r x is X and y is Y then f p xf q y r = + + = + +\n(1)\nIn this equation, Xi and Yi are the input fuzzy sets, fi is the output, pi, pi and ri are the design parameters determined during the learning phase [33]-[35].\nAn ANFIS model has 5 layers. The initial layer is the defuzzification layer and assigns the membership value for each input. Expression of nodes at the input layer are;\n1 1,2( ), ii X for io x\u00b5 == (2)\nDefuzzification is determined by the shape of the assigned membership function.

The Hybrid Learning Algorithm employed in ANFIS consists of two phases: the forward pass and the backward pass. During the forward pass, the precondition parameters are held constant while the outcome parameters are calculated using the least squares method. In the backward pass, the outcome parameters are held constant, and the precondition parameters are calculated by back-propagating the error rates and gradually decreasing them, as outlined in the literature [33]-[36]."

Efforts were made to minimize the impact of environmental noise through the use of active noise cancellation techniques.

The power consumption of the\nwelding process can only be directly calculated by measuring the electrode voltage and current. Detecting the sound emitted during the welding process can provide an indirect calculation of the power consumption. First of all, the average power values should be calculated from the instantaneous voltage and current data obtained by the data acquisition system, and the characteristics of the emitted sound data should be extracted. Thus, an ANFIS model with sound characteristics as inputs and average power as the output can be designed (Fig 4).\nSeventy-two sets of instantaneous voltage, instantaneous current, and emitted sound data with 1,750 samples were recorded sequentially by the data acquisition system. (Fig. 5, 6 and 7).\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\nWhile the electrode\u2019s instantaneous voltage at idle is around + 140 V, it changes polarity during welding and takes a value around -150 V. The electrode\u2019s instantaneous current is around +35 A and does not change direction. This situation demonstrates the inductive load characteristic of the welding machine. By multiplying the instantaneous voltage and current values, the instantaneous power consumed during welding can be determined (Fig. 8).\nThe instantaneous power variation varies between approximately +2kW and -1.5 kW, with positive values representing the power dissipated during welding and negative values representing the power returned. However, when we calculate the average power values, the average power change during the welding process gives us a more meaningful parameter (Fig 9) [43].\nThe average of these 72 instantaneous power datasets ranges between approximately 131 and 0 W.\nTo develop a suitable ANFIS model, feature extraction methods can be applied to the dataset shown in Fig. 7 to obtain input values for average power estimation. The preferred methods are average, maximum, minimum, RMS values and energy value [44].\n1\n1, 2.1 [ ] .., , N\nmean n for ns s N Nn = = =\u00e5 (8) (8)\n}{max max [ ] , 1, 2..., fs or n Ns n == (9) (9)\n}{min , min [ 1,2..., ] for n Ns s n == (10) (10)\n2 1\n1 ( [ ]) , 1, 2..., N\nrms n fs ors n N n N = == \u00e5 (11) (11)\n2\n1\n( [ ]) , 1, 2..., N\nenergy n fos r Ns n n = ==\u00e5 (12)\nAccording to the data in Table 1, the proposed ANFIS model has five input variables: the average, maximum, minimum, RMS values of the emitted sound data, and the energy value. The average power values given in Fig. 9 are the output of the model. The structure of ANFIS model is shown Fig 10.\nEach input variable has five membership functions and 243 rules are created. Gaussian, bell curve, or triangular membership functions are used to fuzzify all inputs. For the output, a constant membership function was preferred.

            "text": "Artificial neural networks (ANN), which are another common estimation method, were used to compare the performance of the ANFIS models we obtained. For this purpose, a feedforward ANN model was created. As in the ANFIS model, the selected five audio features constituted the inputs, and the average power was the output. Therefore, there were five neurons in the input layer and one neuron in the output layer. There were ten neurons in the hidden layer (Fig. 14).\nThe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was preferred for training. The tangent function was chosen for activation.\nSixty-four samples were used for training, four for testing, and four for validation. The root mean squared error was obtained as 15.6911 for training, 12.9097 for validation, and 24.6559 for testing. Regression results are shown in Fig. 15.\nIn order to compare the performances of ANFIS and ANN models, the outputs of the models and errors are given in Fig. 16-19.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Error values are generally higher in the ANN model. The ANN output has the highest error amplitude value out of 8 samples. Naturally, the average power is not expected to be negative. Except for the 35th sample value of Mdl 2, neither Mdl 1 nor Mdl 2 estimated any negative power. On the other hand, the ANN produced negative power, albeit with a small amplitude, in 4 samples. It can be said that the ANFIS models give more successful outputs than the ANN model."

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this study, the average power consumed during the welding process in an electrode welding machine was estimated using the characteristics of the emitted sound data. Three ANFIS models created for this purpose yielded very successful results. As the power value increased, the error rate increased and it was possible to obtain smaller errors at lower power values. The biggest advantage of this method is that the energy consumed can also be calculated by using the average power values. Once a sufficient data set is created, the average power consumed can be estimated with high accuracy using a microphone without the need for additional current and voltage measurements.\nThis study shows that the power or energy consumption of noise-emitting devices, such as welding machines, can be calculated by using sound data. The main limitation of this method is that environmental noise affects the sensing of welding process noise. With active noise cancellation, this can be reduced as much as possible. Another disadvantage is the requirement for a separate Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model for each welding machine type.\nFor future studies, average power or energy estimation can be improved by using different feature extraction and estimation methods."
