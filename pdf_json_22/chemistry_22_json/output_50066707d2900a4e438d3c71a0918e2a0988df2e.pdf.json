    "abstractText": "For the analysis of low concentrations of micropollutants in environmental water samples, efficient sample enrichment and cleanup are necessary to reduce matrix effects and to reach low detection limits. For analytes of low and medium polarity, solid-phase extraction is used, but robust methods for the preconcentration of highly polar or ionizable analytes are scarce. In this work, field-step electrophoresis (FSE) was developed as an environmental sample cleanup technique for ionizable micropollutants and ionic transformation products. The FSE electrolyte system preconcentrated 15 acidic model analytes (pKa from \u22122.2 to 9.1) present in aqueous samples in two fractions by factors of 5\u201310. Simultaneously, highly mobile matrix compounds were removed including inorganic ions such as sulfate and chloride. The fractions were either directly injected for downstream analysis by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) or further processed by evaporative preconcentration with subsequent reconstitution in an organic solvent suitable for separation methods like hydrophilic interaction chromatography. The FSE/RPLC-MS method exhibited high quantitative precision with RSDs of 3\u20136%. The method was successfully applied to a spiked river water sample and its performance compared with common solid-phase extraction and evaporative concentration, demonstrating a high analyte coverage. FSE combined with non-target screening by RPLC-MS revealed a strong reduction in matrix load especially at low retention times. Seventeen compounds were identified in the FSE fractions sampled at the field step boundary by retention time, accurate mass, and mass fragments. Suspect screening by FSE/RPLC-MS was facilitated by FSE\u2019s selectivity for anionic compounds.",

            "text": "The pollution of surface waters by industrial waste, pharmaceuticals, and household chemicals requires extensive monitoring and thus sufficient analytical workflows to control governmental regulations and identify new risks. Since most micropollutants in the aquatic environment are present\nat trace levels (ng/l to \u03bcg/l range), even modern analytical instruments often do not reach the required limits of detection (LODs). Thus, different methods of sample enrichment were developed to increase the analyte concentration and/or reduce matrix interferences [1\u20134]. For screening purposes, the preconcentration method needs a low selectivity so that no analytes are discriminated by physicochemical characteristics such as polarity. Most work has been done using solid-phase extraction (SPE) [1, 3] or evaporative concentration (EC) [5] focusing on selected (classes of) analytes [6].\nRecently, we compiled a list of 455 compounds previously detected in water and biota analysis from various research articles [7]. Among these compounds, 60% of the analytes were charged at pH 10, with 96% of them possessing a charge number \u2264 \u22120.5 (values were simulated by Chemicalize provided by ChemAxon (11/02/2021)). Especially anionic compounds are of interest with regard to (drinking) water analysis as they are more mobile compared to cationic ones.

It was first introduced by Wagner and Kessler in 1983 [8] as a new method for preparative protein isolation. The basic principle is described by Weber et\u00a0al. [9]. Briefly, FSE uses a flat separation chamber, filled with different electrolytes and the sample using parallel injection ports along the upper side. Contrary to common field zone electrophoresis, the separation buffer is not uniform across the separation chamber. Instead, the chamber is filled with two parallel bands of buffers strongly differing in their conductivity. The sample itself is introduced as a broad stream at the boundary into the low-conductivity section. The electric field is applied perpendicular to the buffer and sample flow in such a way that (in our case negatively) charged analytes migrate to the high-conductivity section. Once the ions reach the high-conductivity section, the migration velocity is reduced and the analytes become stacked at the boundary between the high- and low-conductivity buffers. The preconcentrated analytes can be sampled at the end of the separation chamber in different fractions.\nThe FSE principle offers several advantages for the analysis of environmental water samples: (i) the fractionation removes neutral and positively charged compounds. Fast migrating inorganic anions may be removed, too, as they are collected in different fractions when the focusing time and conductivity steps are optimized; (ii) high volumes of aqueous samples can be introduced and fractions collected continuously providing preconcentration from large sample volumes; (iii) in combination with volatile FSE media, enrichment factors (EFs) can be further improved by evaporation of fractions and reconstitution in smaller volumes; and (iv) depending on the subsequent separation method, an orthogonal separation mechanism (e.g., chromatography) can be applied.\nIn this study, the potential of FSE as cleanup and preconcentration step for environmental water samples was investigated and validated using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC-MS) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC\u2013MS) as complementary chromatographic approaches [10]. A non-target screening for river water was conducted to evaluate potential interferences with the FSE media."

Due to stacking, the original sample zone of anionic analytes was narrowed. The fractions were then prepared for subsequent analysis according to \u201cTreatment of FSE fractions\u201d (Steps 3\u20136) or for preconcentration by evaporation and reconstitution. The final analysis (Step 7) was conducted using HILIC-MS or RPLC-MS for the first set of experiments (Exp. 1). In a second set of experiments (Exp. 2), analytes were spiked to river water at different concentrations and isotope-labeled standards were added. Fractions from Exp. 2 were analyzed using RPLC-MS.

Convective mixing is low at these channel dimensions. Thermoconvection was reduced using horizontal separation chambers with cooling from the bottom.

The FSE chamber was filled with a high- and low-conductivity buffer made of 250 or 15 mM triethylamine, both titrated to pH 10.3 using acetic acid. The positioning of the solutions in the chamber is indicated in Fig.\u00a01. Samples were perfused into the low-conductivity buffer zone at 12.7 ml/h. Residence time in the separation chamber was 2.2\u20132.3 min. Fractions were collected (collection rate of 3.4 ml/h) in polypropylene microtiter plates, numbered 1 (anode) to 96 (cathode). The ratio of sample rate (12.7 ml/h) and fraction collection rate (3.4 ml/h) led to a volume enrichment factor (VEF) of 3.7 by FSE. This value corresponds to the enrichment factor theoretically achieved if an analyte is completely focused in only one FSE fraction. Fractions labeled 1 and 2 were collected in the high-conductivity zone, Fractions 3\u20135 were collected\u00a0from the low-conductivity zone (see Fig.\u00a01), both directly near the boundary between these zones, where enrichment takes place.\nThe FSE experiments were conducted in two experimental blocks using sample N1 in Exp. 1 and sample N2 in Exp. 2 (see Fig.\u00a01).

Additionally, an aqueous sample spiked at 250 ng/l (H2O-250 ng/l) was subjected to FSE and used as a reference.

Briefly, the stationary phase used was the same as described in \u201cRPLC-MS\u201d. In contrast to previous work, an x500R-System (Q-TOF, Sciex Applied Biosystems, MA, USA) was used; MS parameters are summarized elsewhere [12]. Ninety-five microliters of diluted sample were mixed with 5 \u03bcl of a solution containing 16 isotope-labeled control standards for internal control measures before injection [11].\nFor all other RPLC-MS and HILIC-MS analyses, a 1260 Infinity LC system coupled to a 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/ MS system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was used. A jet-stream electrospray ionization (ESI) source was operated with a nebulizer pressure of 35 psi, a drying gas temperature of 160 \u00b0C, a flow rate of 16 l/min, and a fragmentor voltage of 360 V. In the negative ionization mode, the capillary voltage was set to 4000 V, the skimmer voltage to 65 V, and the nozzle voltage to 500 V. The mass range was 40\u20131000 m/z with a data acquisition rate of 1 spectrum/s. The sheath gas temperature was set to 325 \u00b0C with a flow rate of 11 l/min. For internal calibration, solutions of purine and HP0921 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany, m/z = 121.0508, 922.0097) in MeOH/water (95/5) were used and sprayed via a reference nebulizer.\nRPLC\u2011MS Aliquots of 10 \u00b5l of the processed samples were injected onto a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, narrow bore, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) for the analysis of compounds of medium polarity.

After 1 min, the initial content of 95% water was decreased to 5% water over 7 min. This mobile phase was kept for another 7 min. Then, the water content was increased to 95% over 5 min.\nHILIC\u2011MS Aliquots of 5 \u00b5l\u00a0 of the processed samples were injected onto a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm polyether ether ketone (PEEK) coated, 3.5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for the analysis of polar compounds. In addition, a guard column (2.1 \u00d7 20 mm PEEK coated, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was installed in front of the column with a coupler. For separation, a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using (A) aqueous 20 mM NH4HCO3 and (B) MeCN, both containing 0.01% FA (v/v), was chosen. The initial content of 90% MeCN was decreased to 40% water over 15 min. This mobile phase was kept for 1 min and the MeCN content was increased to 90% over 0.5 min. To ensure full re-equilibration, this composition was kept for another 8 min before injecting the next sample, leading to a total analysis time of 24.5 min. The re-equilibration step used an increased flow rate of 0.5 ml/min between 16 and 22 min.\nData processing and\u00a0method performance tests\nFor method development and performance testing, ion chromatograms (EICs) were extracted and evaluated from mass profile data with a mass accuracy of 0.01 m/z using Mass Hunter Qualitative Software (Agilent, V10.0). S/N ratios used in \u201cComparison of FSE/RPLC-MS with common SPE and EC\u201d were also calculated using Qualitative Software. MassHunter Quantitative Software (V10.1) was used to create calibration curves. In order to estimate the extent of matrix effects, the peak areas of spiked analytes were compared in blank FSE fractions to the peak area of an aqueous standard (500 or 1000 ng/l for HILIC and RPLC). Enrichment factors (EFs) were calculated by the ratio of the peak areas (for non-target screening peak heights) determined in FSE fractions vs. in spiked native samples. EF values thus comprised effects from enrichment, possible losses, and matrix effects. Fractions with the highest analyte concentration are referred to as fractionMAX for each analyte.\nData were evaluated with Origin 2020 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2019 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA).

For polarity, we considered log D at pH 10 according to the pH in the FSE experiments. The log DpH 10 range was from \u22124.0 to 0.1. To judge the FSE preconcentration effects and precision in river water samples, we spiked five isotope-labeled standards ISTD at a concentration of 1000 ng/l. The ISTD were used to (1) account for endogenous compounds in the sample, (2) to judge the concentration dependence of FSE, and (3) to have additional analytes.\nCompatibility and\u00a0orthogonality of\u00a0FSE with\u00a0common subsequent separation techniques\nThe compatibility with RPLC-MS and HILIC-MS was investigated. We also tested capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry but limits of detection were not sufficient. A direct injection of FSE fractions was possible for all methods, but triethylamine from the FSE electrolyte caused a high background. It was partially removed by evaporating to dryness and reconstituting the fractions as described in Fig.\u00a01 (Steps 5 and 6). After evaporation and reconstitution for RPLC-MS and HILICMS, matrix effects (see \u201cData processing and method performance tests\u201d) were about 100% on average demonstrating a negligible matrix (see supporting information). For the model analytes chosen, method LODs were lowest for separations using HILIC (0.10\u20130.25 \u03bcg/l) and slightly elevated for RPLC (0.6\u20130.8 \u03bcg/l). Surely, increasing the injection volume in\u00a0RPLC-MS would further improve\n2195\nR\u00f6sch T.\u00a0et al.\n1 3\nLODs. Overall, FSE proved to be well compatible with HILIC and RPLC separation.\nWe investigated the selectivity of FSE with regard to analyte polarity or pKa values and assessed the orthogonality of preparative FSE and downstream analytical separation. In Fig.\u00a02, we compare which analytes are present in the reference sample vs. fractions, representing the analytes via their retention times (RT). Their log P and pKa values are indicated by a color code. As expected, selectivity is mainly dominated by polarity for chromatographic separations. No correlation between FSE fractionation and elution order of the analytes was present. This is best visible by the broad distribution of retention times in Fraction F4 covering analytes with a broad range of polarities and pKa values. However, Fractions F2 and F3 contain most of the early eluting analytes.\nEven though analyses using HILIC-MS offered the lowest method LODs, RPLC was used for further performance testing, as all 15 model analytes were the uniformly distributed over the separation window (see Fig.\u00a02) and sufficient sensitivity was reached. With HILIC-MS, only 13 of the 15 analytes were detected as method LODs were not met for DCAA and BTA."

ESU, HEPES, and DCAA were enriched differently: ESU became detectable after preconcentration only at elevated concentrations (\u2265 250 ng/l) using EC and FSE. Using SPE, a decrease in peak area compared to the original sample was observed caused by the poor retention of the ionic compound on the SPE sorbent. DCAA was enriched by all three sample preparation steps. However, strong quenching effects were present after EC, probably caused by co-enrichment of matrix compounds inherent to this technique. Preconcentration of DCAA was effective by SPE and FSE enabling its analysis at concentrations below 10 ng/l. The analyte HEPES could only be quantified after FSE but not after SPE or EC, eventually due to ionization quenching by matrix components (see \u201cCompatibility and orthogonality of FSE with common subsequent separation techniques\u201d), or a strong positive bias in the enrichment process either in FSE or negative bias in SPE and EC.

Cationic compounds migrated away from the stacking boundary and anions of high electrophoretic mobility, e.g., the inorganic anions chloride, phosphate, and sulfate, often present at high concentrations in environmental samples crossed the stacking boundary and were\nRT in min IS 2 N2 F1 F4 5.35 sotalol d6 6.04 6.31 benzotriazole d4 7.25 chloridazon d5 8.38 sulfadimethoxine d6 9.45 irbesartan d4\n10.44 diuron d6 10.93 darunavir d9 11.5 bicalutamide d4 13.8 fipronil 13C2,15N2\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n0.0\n5.0x106\n1.0x107\n1.5x107\n2.0x107\n2.5x107\n3.0x107\n3.5x107\nretention time in min 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n0.0\n2.0x106\n4.0x106\n6.0x106\n8.0x106\nstnuoc ni ytisnetni\na ESI+ b ESI-\nc dIS 2 F1 F42.00 melamin d6 2.17 metformin d6 5.37 sotalol d6 6.05 6.12 lidocaine d10 6.36 benzotriazole d4 7.26 chloridazon d5 8.42 sulfadimethoxine d6 9.46 irbesartan d4\n10.48 diuron d6 10.95 darunavir d9 11.54 bicalutamide d4 11.58 propazine d6 12.3 azoxystrobin d4 13.81 fipronil 13C2,15N2 14.57 diazinon d10\nH O 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.9\nhydrochlorothiazide 13C,d2 1.0 0.8 0.8 1.0 1.0 0.7 0.6 0.7 1.0 0.7 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.8 0.7 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.9 1.0 0.8 0.8 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.8 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.8 1.0\nRT in min H O N2 1.0 0.8 0.0 0.4 1.0 0.6 0.0 0.7 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.9\nhydrochlorothiazide 13C,d2 1.0 0.2 0.2 0.4 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.6 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.2 0.7 1.0 1.0 0.4 0.5 1.0 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.9 1.0 1.2 0.8 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.6 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.4 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.7 0.9 1.0 0.9 0.7 0.9 1.0 1.0 0.7 1.0\nin te\nns ity\nin c\nou nt\ns\nin te\nns ity\nin c\nou nt\ns\nretention time in in retention time in min\nFig. 5 a and b TICs of a blank sample (LC-MS grade H2O, spiked with control standards, green mass chromatograms), of the river water samples N2-250 ng/l and N2-1000 ng/l (blue lines) spiked with the model analytes as well as the TICs for FSE fractions (F1, of sample N2-250 (ESI+) with N2-1000 ng/l (ESI\u2212, black lines) and F4 of N2 (red lines)) in both positive (a, c) and negative (b, d) ESI polar-\nity.

All samples were diluted one-fold\n2199\nR\u00f6sch T.\u00a0et al.\n1 3\nnot present in the fractions of interest at elevated concentration. A further optimization is possible changing the relative sample flow rate and the migration path length in FSE: a shorter migration path length speeds the separation process and aids in sample stacking. With the current setup using about half the separation chamber for separation, the sample amount injected could be doubled. Obviously, sample cleanup using FSE was successful in reducing the number of matrix components eluting in or close to the void volume, as intensities in Fraction F4 decreased significantly compared to the raw sample. The only exception was the TIC of Fraction F1 analyzed in the positive ionization mode. Here, the maximum of the TIC signal at the beginning of the chromatogram was at higher retention times. Triethylamine, the cation in the FSE electrolytes, was identified as the major contributor to this signal as can be seen by the EIC of TEA at m/z 102.128 in Fig.\u00a05a. A high amount in F1 is expected, which is sampled in the high-conductivity zone with its 17-fold higher concentration compared to the low-conductivity zone which was sampled in F4.\nFig.\u00a05c and d depict two heat maps coding the signal suppression of the control standards spiked to every sample just before RPLC-NTS analysis in both ESI modes (reference was pure water spiked with the control standards). Matrix interferences were acceptable in positive ESI mode and were slightly reduced upon FSE sample preparation in negative ESI mode compared to the natural sample. The heat maps reveal different matrix effects for the different analytes in the river water sample vs. the two Fractions F1 and F4 using positive ESI polarity (Fig.\u00a05c). Analysis using negative ESI mode (Fig.\u00a05d) revealed stronger matrix effects. Overall, matrix effects by the FSE medium were small compared to matrix effects from the sample matrix."

            "text": "Already in the TIC traces of Fraction F4, an increase in intensity and number of distinct signals was observed for both ESI polarities (see Fig.\u00a05a and b). A closer evaluation of the data using libraries revealed 26 suspects based on retention time and exact mass. The suspects are listed in Table\u00a02 and some EICs are shown in Fig.\u00a06. Suspect analytes were only detected in Fraction F4 and were enriched by factors between 0.9 and 15.2 (see ratio F4/sample in Table\u00a02). The suspects were investigated in more detail considering the criteria of FSE of anionic charge and a theoretical VEF of 3.7. For some analytes, EFs > 3.7 were observed which cannot result solely from FSE preconcentration (e.g., adipic acid (EF = 15.2), N\u00b07 in Fig.\u00a06). Matrix effects and low precision at concentrations close to the LOD may account for too high EFs. However, some\nsuspects, e.g., levetiracetam and genistein, exhibited EFs of over 100, clearly indicating false-positive results. Indeed, using MS/MS, potential (negatively charged) suspect compounds demonstrating too high EFs of \u2265 140 could be falsified (see Fig.\u00a07, Panels 3b and c).\nSeventy percent of the suspects listed in Table\u00a02 have a (simulated) negative charge number (\u2264 \u22120.2) at pH 10, which was defined as the threshold for an effective FSE stacking. Thirteen of these suspects were verified by MS/ MS, e.g., valsartan acid and candesartan (see Fig.\u00a07, Panels 1a-c and 2a-cand Figure legend).\nFour neutral suspects (diphenylamine, N-ethylaniline, benzoguanamine, and venlafaxine, see (Table\u00a0 2) were verified using MS/MS. The ratio of 0.9 for the uncharged suspect venlafaxine corresponds well with the FSE mechanism: neutral analytes can reach Fraction F4 when diffusion takes place, broadening the injection zone. Their concentration is reduced compared to the original sample by a factor of approx. 4 (sample flow rate of 12.7 ml/min vs. fraction collection rate of 3.4 ml/min). N-ethylaniline had a too high EF, so a false-positive result is very likely. Other neutral suspects with too high enrichment factors were also classified as false-positives using MS/MS (e.g., levetiracetam and dimefuron). Still, some analytes (benzoguanamine and adipic acid) revealed too high peak height ratios, possibly coelution with isobaric compounds occurred. Overall, the increased selectivity by charge strongly aided in suspect screening. FSE was able to capture transformation products, e.g., the suspect valsartan acid (N\u00b05 in Fig.\u00a06, Table\u00a02), a transformation product of valsartan. The non-target screening also showed that analyte polarity was not decisive for an analyte to be covered by FSE: the suspects covered a log DpH 10 range from \u22126.6 (adipic acid) to 1.5 (3,5-di-tert butylsalicylic acid). Different substance classes were covered."

A proof of concept for non-target screening was presented resulting in 17 suspects fully identified by retention time and MS/MS spectra in the relevant FSE fraction with only very minor interferences of the FSE electrolytes with the subsequent non-target screening. The additional selectivity criterion of charge by FSE proved to be useful in excluding false-positive results and thus facilitated suspect screening.\nOnly minor analyte losses occurred in contrast to SPE, where some polar analytes were not well retained. In contrast to direct evaporative concentration of environmental\nsamples, FSE fractionation removed critical salt matrix components. FSE may be applied as a sample cleanup prior to EC as the enrichment would then occur after salt removal with high enrichment factors but lowered matrix effects. FSE and EC may advantageously be combined to reach both removal of inorganic salts and intense preconcentration of target analytes. An interesting future application is the analysis of marine samples with their very high salinity.\nFSE was shown for the first time to be an interesting tool for screening applications in environmental analysis, especially when bearing in mind that transformation products in the environment often have a higher acidity than their parent compounds.

Further enrichment can be reached by narrowing down the fractions after FSE separation, which is feasible as the FSE electrolytes chosen are volatile. FSE sample preparation methods for basic analytes have to be developed.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00216- 021- 03856-w.\nAuthor contribution Anna-Jorina Wicht conducted prestudies on FSE/ RPLC-MS and optimized the RPLC-MS method.
