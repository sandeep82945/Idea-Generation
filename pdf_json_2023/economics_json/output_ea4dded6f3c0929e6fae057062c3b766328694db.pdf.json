Moreover, practical suggestions are put forward. Secondly, an optimization model of China\u2019s low-carbon economy (LCE) is implemented. The Matlab software can be adopted to solve the economic output of each department in the expected year and obtain the overall economic indicators for 2017 and 2022. Finally, the output influence and CO2 emission influence of each industry are analyzed. The research results are as follows. (1) From the viewpoint of public health (PH), the countermeasures and suggestions of the S&T talents policy mainly include four parts: building a complete S&T talents policy system, expanding the coverage group of the policy, strictly implementing the policy of evaluating S&T talents, and improving the guarantee mechanism of relevant talents introduction policy. (2) In 2017, the primary industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, accounted for 5.33%; the secondary industry, the energy sector accounted for 72.04%, and the tertiary industry (service industry) accounted for 22.63%. In 2022, the primary, secondary, and tertiary industry accounted for 6.09%, 68.44%, and 25.47%. (3) From the perspective of the industrial influence coe cient, the coe cient of all sectors is stable during 2017\u20132022. From the standpoint of CO2 emission, China\u2019s total CO2 emission shows rapidly increasing trend during the same period. This study has vital practical significance and theoretical value for realizing the sustainable development (SH) and transformation of the LCE.\nKEYWORDS\npublic health, talent incentive, low-carbon economy, CO2 emission influence, industrial influence\n1. Introduction\nNo matter what kind of ideology, development is the eternal theme of human society, it is of great significance to study how to optimize the policy of scientific and technological (S&T) talents, guide relevant skills, explore the development direction and model of S&T skills policy from the angle of public health (PH), and create an excellent social development environment for the talents and guarantee the implementation of the strategy of rural revitalization.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\nIn China\u2019s development, energy, as a non-renewable resource, is a key factor in the production function and is extremely important in a country\u2019s economic growth (1). The so-called low-carbon economy (LCE) strictly controls the consumption of traditional high-CO2 emission and high-pollution energy such as coal and oil utilizing introducing new technologies and developing new power under the guidance of the scientific outlook on development and sustainable development (SD). This can curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a certain extent, make a favorable balance between economic progress, energy consumption, and environmental protection, thus achieving a social form of fast economic growth without sacrificing the environment, and finally realizing the optimization and upgrading of industrial structure and energy structure (2).\nMany domestic and international researchers have studied the relevant aspects of talent policy. Combined with the characteristics of talent resource allocation in higher vocational colleges, Cui (3) analyzed the current situation of talent recruitment in China\u2019s vocational colleges to better complete the construction of the national \u201cDouble High-levels Plan\u201d and improve the ability of these colleges to cultivate more outstanding talents for the society (3). Gao et al. (4) analyzed the problems existing in environmental accounting information exposure (EAIE) of agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises under LCE. They got a clearer understanding of this aspect, which is conducive to fundamentally proposing countermeasures to improve the level of EAIE (4). Xinsheng et al. (5) took China\u2019s rural areas as the research object, explored the status quo of the development of rural personnel, discussed the existing problems in the development of rural human resources, and put forward effective measures to revitalize rural talents, which provided a solid theoretical basis for better rural development (5). Allotey et al. (6) surveyed 10 math and science teachers about their beliefs about talent and their proposed strategies for developing gifted students into skills. The findings suggested that it is necessary to formulate a formal policy on S&T talent education and implement a teacher education plan to solve teachers\u2019 beliefs and knowledge about gift and talent education strategy (6). Marco and Lorenzo (7) investigated how promotion incentives affect the productivity of many highly skilled employees by using the three bibliometric thresholds of the national scientific qualifications in the centralized evaluation process of professional development of Italian universities. The results highlighted the importance of promotion incentives as practical motivational tools for public universities and general public organizations (7). From the point of view of theoretical research, foreign scholars have conducted earlier research on S&T talents policy, which mainly starts from education. Chinese scholars pay more attention to the overall grasp of S&T talents policy and advocate establishing the policy system.\nFirstly, from the cultivation, evaluation, flow, and incentive of four aspects of S&T talents, the incentive and optimization policy of the skills are studied, and practical suggestions are raised. Secondly, a Chinese LCE optimization model is established to solve the economic output of each industry in the expected year. Finally, the CO2 emission influence and output influence of each industry are analyzed. The results reveal that the energy sector is in the middle of the industrial chain and is the pillar\nindustry of the national economy. Still, it is also the primary source of increasing CO2 emissions. Some other sectors, such as the equipment manufacturing industry, are located in the lower part of the industrial chain and have a high driving effect on the economy. The innovation of this study lies in the optimization and adjustment of the structure of the industrial sector from the perspective of total carbon emission and total energy consumption control, aiming at the maximization of economic output, the minimization of CO2 emission, and the assessment of industrial environmental efficiency, which provides the scientific basis and reference for how to upgrade the industrial structure and how to transition from the traditional economy to the LCE."

The implementation of policy evaluation is to ensure the scientific nature and reliability of the results of the S&T talents evaluation policy from the perspective of PH through qualitative or quantitative researchmethods so that the evaluation results become an essential basis for optimizing this policy from the point of PH (19). The feedback mechanism of the S&T talents evaluation policy is demonstrated in Figure 3.\nFrom a PH perspective, the evaluation policies of S&T skills would be incomplete without a feedback mechanism. In this perspective, the policy optimization should not only be based on the feedback of the policy evaluation but also on listening to the opinions of the people who implement the policy. Based on the interests of the people, by building a policy information feedback platform, more people can have the opportunity to participate in the process of information feedback on this policy from the viewpoint of PH, to realize the innovation of the existing policy feedback mechanism from relevant perspectives."

Using MATLAB software, the economic output of each sector in the expected year can be solved to obtain overall economic indicators for 2017 and 2022. Finally, the output influence of each industry and CO2 influence are analyzed. The results of the study are as follows: (1) From the point of view of PH, the suggestions and countermeasures of the S&T talents policymainly consist of four parts: expanding the coverage group of this policy, establishing a complete policy system, perfecting the safeguard mechanism of such talents introduction policy, and strictly implementing these talents evaluation policy. (2) Compared with 2017, the total economic output of the three industries reached 184.8 trillion yuan, 44.19 trillion yuan higher than that of 2017. (3) Overall, the influence coefficient of the secondary industry is much stronger than that of the primary and tertiary sectors, and the majority exceed the mean value of social industries. Consequently, it can be concluded that the secondary industry is still the main driving force of the national economy in China. The disadvantage is that in the comparable price input\u2013 output model used in this study, the price deflator of the tertiary sector is determined by the added value coefficient. Due to data limitations, the added value coefficient in the statistical yearbook\ncannot cover all sectors. Thus, the added value coefficient of other service industries is used to deflate the remaining industries, which will slightly affect the accuracy of the data. Besides, price factors such as carbon prices and policy trends of various provinces need to be incorporated into the relevant influencing factors in the study content, so as to achieve a more complete development strategy for China\u2019s LCE. Therefore, in future studies, the regional development trend of China\u2019s LCE will be tracked timely according to the update of data, and the future growth trend will be predicted as far as possible by using rigorous and scientific models based on relevant statistical methods.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Northeastern University Ethics Committee.
