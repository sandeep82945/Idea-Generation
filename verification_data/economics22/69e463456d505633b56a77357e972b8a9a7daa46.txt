"One possible explanation for the different trends in the two clusters with a higher percentage of vaccinated people (clusters B and C) could be the types of vaccines that were mainly administrated in each country. However, as shown in Figure 10, due to the limitations and types of available data, inference on the efficiency of the different types of vaccines is hard to make. This limitation makes this particular topic something that may be studied in more detail as part of future work and further analysis."
