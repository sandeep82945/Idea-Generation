"The results of this work suggest that the utilization of FA to enhance the adsorption properties of amine-infused hydrogels is a promising area for future investigation." 

"Further optimization studies, such as varying the FA composition, FA particle size, type of amine solution, operational pressure, and increasing temperature, are also recommended in order to maximize CO2 capture. With further exploration of these remaining factors, this easily synthesized AIHs has the potential to become a commercially viable adsorbent for CO2 capture."
