The simulations are performed for trans-relativistic reconnection with magnetization 1 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 3 (defined as the ratio of magnetic tension to plasma rest-mass energy density), which is expected in the coronae of accretion disks around black holes. We find that magnetic dissipation proceeds with inefficient energy exchange between the heated ions and the Compton-cooled electrons. As a result, most electrons are kept at a low temperature in Compton equilibrium with radiation, and so thermal Comptonization cannot reach photon energies \u223c 100 keV observed from accreting black holes. Nevertheless, magnetic reconnection efficiently generates \u223c 100 keV photons because of mildly relativistic bulk motions of the plasmoid chain formed in the reconnection layer. Comptonization by the plasmoid motions dominates the radiative output and controls the peak of the radiation spectrum Epk. We find Epk \u223c 40 keV for \u03c3 = 1 and Epk \u223c 100 keV for \u03c3 = 3. In addition to the X-ray peak around 100 keV, the simulations show a non-thermal MeV tail emitted by a non-thermal electron population generated near X-points of the reconnection layer. The results are consistent with the typical hard state of accreting black holes. In particular, we find that the spectrum of Cygnus X-1 is well explained by electron-ion reconnection with \u03c3 \u223c 3.",

            "text": "Hard, non-thermal X-rays observed from black hole Xray binaries (BHXBs) are traditionally attributed to thermal Comptonization of seed soft photons by a hot plasma (\u2018corona\u2019) surrounding the black hole (BH), with typical inferred electron temperatures \u223c100 keV (Zdziarski & Gierlin\u0301ski 2004). X-ray spectral and temporal studies have shed light on how the geometry and location of the corona change depending on the phase of the outburst (Kara et al. 2019; Sridhar et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021; Cao et al. 2021). Yet, the mechanism that energizes the corona against the strong inverse Compton (IC) losses is still a mystery. Recently, Beloborodov (2017) suggested that magnetic reconnection can power the Comptonization process through the\n?

The simulations (SB20, SSB21) confirmed that the pair plasma trapped in plasmoids is efficiently cooled to a non-relativistic temperature while their bulk motions remain trans-relativistic, resembling a Maxwellian distribution with effective temperature kBTbulk \u223c 100 keV. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray spectra produced by the \u2018cold-chain Comptoniza-\n1 See Figure 1 in Sridhar et al.

Our previous numerical simulations SB20, SSB21) focused on reconnection in strongly magnetized (\u03c3 1) e\u00b1 pair plasma. However, accretion disk coronae can also have iondominated regions with \u03c3 \u223c 1 adjacent to the accretion flow, (e.g., Galeev et al. 1979). Formation of disk coronae is a difficult problem studied with GRMHD simulations (e.g., Jiang et al. 2019; Chatterjee et al. 2019; Ripperda et al. 2020, 2021; Nathanail et al. 2021). It is not established which region dominates the observed hard X-ray emission. It is possible that magnetic reconnection in electron-ion plasma with moderate \u03c3 \u223c 1 is the dominant source of hard X-rays.\nThe present paper investigates this possibility using radiative kinetic simulations. Similar simulations of transrelativistic reconnection in electron-ion plasmas were performed before only in the absence of radiative cooling (Melzani et al. 2014a,b; Rowan et al. 2017; Werner et al. 2018; Ball et al. 2018; Rowan et al. 2019; Ball et al. 2019; Kilian et al. 2020). We, for the first time, extend these studies to the radiative regime. In particular, we investigate the effect of IC losses on the particle energy distribution and evaluate the IC emission from the reconnection layer.\nOnly electrons experience significant IC cooling. As a result, the reconnection layer can enter a two-temperature state with ions much hotter than the electrons. This depends on the efficiency of the electron-ion energy exchange. Exchange through Coulomb collisions is typically slow in the corona with \u03c3 > 1, however there may be collisionless mechanisms\u2014involving e.g. ion velocity-space instabilities (Hasegawa 1969; Gary 1992; Sharma et al. 2006; Kunz et al. 2014; Riquelme et al. 2015; Sironi & Narayan 2015; Zhdankin et al. 2020)\u2014that could transfer the ion thermal energy to the colder electrons. This suggests a possibility for sustaining a high electron temperature Te inside reconnection plasmoids, perhaps competitive with Tbulk of the plasmoid bulk motions. Then, thermal Comptonization could become important for hard X-ray production. Kinetic plasma simulations are the best way to find out, from first principles, the importance of Te vs. Tbulk.\n2 The simulations will also show how the electron distribution in the reconnection layer depends on \u03c3 and what effect it has on the Comptonization spectrum.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we describe the numerical setup of our simulations. In \u00a73, we present the implementation and parameterization of IC cooling, and the most important timescales for our problem, in the context of BH coronae. In \u00a74, we present our PIC results, emphasizing the dependence on magnetization and strength of IC cooling. The photon spectra derived from our PIC simulations using Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations are presented in \u00a75. We summarize our findings in \u00a76.\n2 In paper I (SSB21), we presented an experiment where only electrons were selectively cooled, with positrons remaining hot\u2014 mimicking a radiatively-cooled electron-ion plasma. Our results showed that no energy is efficiently transferred from the hot positrons to the colder electrons, on timescales shorter the plasma advection time out of the reconnection layer."

            "text": "We perform simulations of magnetic reconnection with the 3D electromagnetic particle-in-cell code tristan-mp (Buneman 1993; Spitkovsky 2005); the code employs a Vay pusher (Vay 2008) for updating the particles\u2019 momenta. Overall, the simulation setup is similar to what we have employed in paper I of this series (SSB21) and in SB20. We nonetheless describe it here given the different composition of the plasma. We refer readers to Appendix A for the complete set of our numerical and physical input parameters.\nOur simulations are performed on a 2D spatial domain\u2014with Cartesian grid in the x\u2212y plane\u2014yet evolving all three components (x, y, z) of velocities and electromagnetic fields. We initialize a plasma composed of electrons (subscript \u2018e\u2019) and protons/ions (subscript \u2018i\u2019). The effect of the proton-to-electron mass ratio is examined in Appendix B for mi/me ' 7\u22121836; our fiducial mass ratio is mi/me = 29, which in the uncooled regime gives results in reasonable agreement with realistic mass ratio (see Appendix B). Electrons and ions have equal number densities, n0e = n0i, and can be described by a Maxwell-Ju\u0308ttner distribution with dimensionless temperatures \u03b8e = kBTe/mec\n2 \u223c 10\u22124 and \u03b8i = kBTi/mic\n2 = 10\u22124(me/mi), respectively, where we initialize electrons and ions with the same temperature Te = Ti. The Debye length corresponding to these conditions is \u03bbDe = \u221a kBTe/4\u03c0n0e2 = 0.05 cells. We demonstrate in Appendix C (on simulation convergence with spatial resolution) that this choice of upstream temperature does not influence our overall conclusions, by performing additional simulations with \u03b8e = 0.02, or equivalently, \u03bbDe = 1 cell.\nFor our case of cold plasma, we define the plasma magnetization of a given species \u03c3s 3 as:\n\u03c3s = B20\n4\u03c0n0smsc2 = ( \u03c9cs \u03c9ps )2 , (1)\nwhere B0 is the asymptotic upstream magnetic field strength, \u03c9cs = eB0/msc is the particle gyro-frequency, the plasma frequency \u03c9ps is defined as\n\u03c9ps =\n\u221a 4\u03c0n0se2\nms , (2)\nwith the corresponding plasma skin depth given by c/\u03c9ps. The plasma we initialize is dominated in mass by the ions, therefore the overall plasma\u2019s magnetization parameter \u03c3 \u2261 B2/4\u03c0\u03c1c2 is nearly equal to \u03c3i. We are interested in the regime of trans-relativistic reconnection, so we consider \u03c3i = \u03c3eme/mi = {1, 2, 3}. The corresponding Alfve\u0301n speeds are vA/c = \u221a \u03c3i/(\u03c3i + 1) = {0.71, 0.81, 0.87}. The plasma-\u03b2 parameter of the initialized plasma is given by \u03b20 = \u03b2i +\u03b2e = 8\u03c0k(niTi +neTe)/B 2 0 \u223c \u03b8s/\u03c3s. Our choices of the upstream plasma temperature and magnetization always renders the plasma \u03b20 1.\nThe fields undergoing reconnection are initialized along the \u00b1x\u0302 direction (Bx), while the reconnected fields get oriented along the\u00b1y\u0302 direction. This sets the plasma inflow and\n3 Throughout this paper, the subscript \u2018s\u2019 can denote either species\u2014electrons or ions; the subscript \u2018e\u00b1\u2019 is used to denote electrons and positrons in a pair plasma. E.g., when referring to results from paper I (SSB21), the magnetization \u03c3e\u00b1 is normalized to the electron-positron mass density.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\noutflow directions to be along \u00b1y\u0302 and \u00b1x\u0302, respectively. We initialize the system in the so-called Harris equilibrium (Harris 1962), where the initial magnetic field profile is given by Bx = \u2212B0 tanh(2\u03c0y/\u2206y), i.e., at y = 0 the field reverses its polarity over a thickness of \u2206y. Consistent with our previous work (SSB21), we also add a uniform guide field Bg = 0.1B0 along the z-axis, which does not get dissipated, and so does not add any free energy to the system.\nThe magnetic pressure outside the layer is balanced by particle pressure in the layer, by adding an additional population of hot particles with an overdensity of 3. We initiate reconnection by artificially cooling down the hot particles near the center [(x, y) = (0, 0)] at the initial time. We restrict the horizontal extent of the region where we trigger reconnection to a length \u2206x = 400 c/\u03c9pe. The reconnected field lines form an \u2018X\u2019-point at the center of the domain, which eventually separates into two reconnection fronts that carry away the plasma along \u00b1x\u0302 at \u223cAlfve\u0301nic speeds. The initial thickness of the current sheet is chosen to be large enough (\u2206y ' 150 c/\u03c9pe) such that the tearing mode instability does not spontaneously grow before the two reconnection fronts have reached the boundaries of the domain.\nWe employ outflow boundary conditions along the x boundaries of the computational domain (Daughton et al. 2006; Belyaev 2015; Cerutti et al. 2015). This ensures that the hot plasma initialized in the current sheet gets evacuated after \u223c Lx/vA, where Lx is the half-length of the box along x. Along the y direction, we employ two injectors that introduce fresh plasma and magnetic flux into the computational domain. These injectors move away from y = 0 at the speed of light, and the box dynamically expands when they reach its boundaries (see Sironi et al. 2016, for details). With this setup, the reconnection dynamics evolves in a \u201cquasi-steady state\u201d at time t > Lx/vA i.e., independent of the inital conditions (viz., temperature or overdensity of hot plasma in the sheet, \u2206x and \u2206y). We demonstrate this in Appendix D by showing how the reconnection rate (\u03b7rec; defined as the plasma\u2019s inflow velocity in units of the Alfve\u0301n speed) evolves with time. Akin to SSB21, we evolve the simulation up to tsim \u223c 5Lx/vA for all the considered magnetizations; this provides a sufficiently long time to assess the steady-state properties of the reconnection system.\nWe choose our computational domains with different sizes: 420 \u2264 Lx/(c/\u03c9pe) \u2264 6720, or equivalently, 78 \u2264 Lx/(c/\u03c9pi) \u2264 1259 (for mi/me = 29). Large boxes are essential to retain the correct hierarchy of time and energy scales expected for BH coronae (see \u00a73). We resolve the electron skin depth c/\u03c9pe with 5 grid lengths (\u03b4) (i.e., resolution R = (c/\u03c9pe)/\u03b4 = 5). In Appendix C, we show for a representative case that our results are qualitatively the same with lower and higher resolutions (R = 2.5, 10). The numerical speed of light (the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number) is set to 0.45 cells/timestep. We initialize the plasma with a density of n0 = 4 particles per cell (2 per species), and improve particle noise in the electric current density with 32 passes of a \u201c1-2-1\u201d low-pass digital filter (Birdsall & Langdon 1991) at each step of the PIC loop. We present a convergence test in Appendix E, where we compare our results with simulations having a higher initial particle number density, n0 = 64, and a lower number of filtering passes (8)."

Given our simulations\u2019 temporal resolution (\u2206t = 0.09\u03c9\u22121pe ), the choice of \u03b3cr > \u221a \u03c3e ensures that the IC cooling time for any electron\u2014with Lorentz factors even as high as \u03b3e \u223c \u03b3cr\u2014is well resolved (SB20, SSB21).\nWe refer readers to part I in this series of papers (SSB21) and SB20 for a detailed quantification of the plasma conditions in black hole coronae. For an e\u00b1 corona, we showed that the plasma magnetization is expected to be \u03c3e\u00b1 \u223c 400. On the other hand, the coronae adjacent to the accretion disk can have moderately-magnetized regions (\u03c3 \u223c 1) whose mass density is dominated by ions\u2014as also seen in GRMHD simulations (Chatterjee et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2019). It follows that \u03c3e = \u03c3i(mi/me) 1. On the other hand, the parametrization for the seed photon density Urad, and so \u03b3cr, does not depend on the plasma composition, and is estimated to be \u03b3cr \u223c 104(MBH/M )1/4, where MBH is the mass of the black hole SSB21.\nWe showed in our earlier works (SB20, SSB21) that electrons accelerated at X-points typically attain Lorentz factors \u03b3X \u223c \u03c3e/8,5 and that their IC cooling timescale is much longer than the X-point acceleration timescale. This sets the requirement of \u03b3cr \u03c3e/8, which ensures that electrons accelerated at the X-points do not suffer significant IC cooling. On the other hand, the IC cooling timescale is much shorter than the timescale for plasma advection across the reconnection region, whose size, in BH coronae, is comparable to the gravitational radius of the black hole (Beloborodov 2017). The ratio of these two timescales in our simulations can be\n4 The electric field associated with reconnection is given by Erec = \u03b7rec(vA/c)B0. When defining \u03b3cr, we take Erec \u223c \u03b7recB0, which is a fair assumption for our case of trans-relativistic reconnection with \u03c3 \u223c 1. 5 This estimate assumes that half of the available magnetic energy is dissipated into particle energy (Sironi et al. 2015), and that electrons and ions acquire the same amount of dissipated field energy.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\ncast as follows (SSB21):\n\u03c4cool \u2261 \u03b32cr\n\u03b7rec \u221a \u03c3e c/\u03c9pe Lx < 1 .

            "text": "In this section, we present the effect of different magnetizations (1 < \u03c3i < 3) on the structure of the radiatively-cooled reconnection region, for a fixed \u03c4cool = 0.06. As we show in Fig. 1, the reconnection rate exhibits a very weak dependence on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. On the other hand, \u03b7rec increases from \u223c0.08 to \u223c0.12 as \u03c3i is increased from 1 to 3; this is consistent with MHD results of Ni et al. (2012) and PIC results of, e.g., Rowan et al. (2017) and Ball et al. (2018). For our fiducial mass ratio (mi/me = 29), Fig. 1 also shows that reconnection proceeds with a rate that is nearly independent on the strength of radiative cooling; this conclusion holds both for the electron-ion composition considered here, as well as for the pair plasma of our previous studies (SB20, SSB21). This can be understood from the fact that the reconnection rate is controlled by the electron inertial and thermal effects at X-points, and the electron dynamics at X-points are not affected by cooling for our choice of \u03b3cr > \u03c3e/8.\nThe 2D structure of strongly IC-cooled (\u03c4cool = 0.06) reconnection layers for different magnetizations is presented in Fig. 2 (\u03c3i = 1 on the left, \u03c3i = 3 on the right). Regardless of the strength of IC cooling and the value of the magnetization, the reconnection region breaks into a hierarchical chain of coherent magnetic structures (\u2018plasmoids\u2019) as a result of the tearing instability (Tajima & Shibata 1997; Loureiro et al. 2007; Bhattacharjee et al. 2009; Uzdensky et al. 2010). The formed plasmoids occasionally merge with each other, leading to the formation of secondary reconnection layers at the merger site, transverse to the main layer.\nThe plasmoid density structure in trans-relativistic (\u03c3 \u223c 1) reconnection (Fig. 2) shows some differences as compared to the ultra-relativistic (\u03c3 1) case of our earlier works (Sironi et al. 2016, SB20, SSB21). For high magnetizations, plasmoids were nearly circular, and markedly symmetric around their \u2018O\u2019-point\u2014the location of local maximum in the magnetic vector potential, corresponding to the plasmoid center. In contrast, for \u03c3 \u223c 1 they display an asymmetric \u2018teardrop\u2019 shape, with elongated tails. Older plasmoids (seen near the edges of the box) are more teardrop-like than newborn plasmoids (near the center of the box). This is because large plasmoids grow by accreting smaller (so, faster) plasmoids from behind. Since for \u03c3 \u223c 1 all plasmoids have comparable velocities (see below), the accreted plasmoids take some time to merge into the leading plasmoid, which gives the appearance of a long trailing tail.\nThe density structure in strongly cooled electron-ion simulations appears different from their pair-plasma counterparts (SSB21). Plasmoids formed in pair plasma were devoid of particles near their \u2018heads\u2019 (in the direction of their motion), which rather accumulate near the plasmoid \u2018tails\u2019. This was caused by Compton drag acting on the electronpositron pairs. Ions, on the other hand, are not appreciably affected by Compton drag. Electrons are electrostatically coupled to ions, and so they inherit the ions\u2019 larger inertia\u2014 ions have a larger rest mass, and they do not lose the energy gained from reconnection. Thus, in electron-ion simulations the drag effect on the plasma inside plasmoids is weaker than in otherwise equivalent e\u00b1 simulations.6\n6 Similar results were observed in the hybrid experiment with cooled electrons and uncooled positrons that we showed in SSB21.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\nA 2D map of the magnetic energy density (in units of its initialized value) is presented in panels [b] of Fig. 2. The peak values of B2/B20\u2014seen at the core of plasmoids\u2014are smaller for \u03c3i = 1, as compared to \u03c3i = 3. The magnetic field in the plasmoid cores is compressed by a factor of B/B0 \u223c 14 for \u03c3i = 3, whereas B/B0 \u223c 8 for \u03c3i = 1.\nThe total IC power per electron is shown in panels [c] of Fig. 2. This is represented by the quantity \u3008\u03b32e\u03b22e \u3009 = \u3008\u03b32e \u3009\u22121, where the average for each cell is performed in a local patch of 5 \u00d7 5 cells. As expected, the total IC power is larger for \u03c3i = 3 than for \u03c3i = 1, just as a consequence of the greater energy per particle. For both \u03c3i = 1 and 3, the IC power is fairly uniformly distributed over the reconnected plasma, with a slight excess seen around the primary X-point near the center of the layer, in the thin layers between merging plasmoids, and at the heads and tails of plasmoids. This is similar to what was seen in radiatively-cooled relativistic reconnection of an e\u00b1 plasma (SB20, SSB21).\nThe bulk motion\u2019s contribution to the total IC power is shown in panels [d] of Fig. 2. This is represented by \u03932 \u2212 1, where \u0393 = (1 \u2212 \u03b22)\u22121/2 is the bulk Lorentz factor of the plasma, and \u03b2 is the average particle fluid velocity\u2014 weighted with the mass densities of both electrons and ions and averaged, for each cell, in the local patch of neighboring 5\u00d7 5 cells. In the frame moving with velocity \u03b2, the plasma stress-energy tensor has a vanishing energy flux, and we define this to be the plasma comoving frame (Rowan et al. 2019). We find that the bulk motions\u2019 contribution to the IC power is stronger for \u03c3i = 3 than for \u03c3i = 1. This is ex-\npected, since faster bulk motions are associated with higher values of the Alfve\u0301n speed vA \u221d \u221a \u03c3/(1 + \u03c3) (more on this in \u00a74.2.1 and Fig. 3). The similarity between panels [c] and [d] in Fig. 2 for both \u03c3i = 1 and 3 suggests that most of the IC power comes from bulk motions. This is further supported by panels [e] (the difference between panels [c] and [d]) where we show the contribution of the electrons\u2019 internal motion (represented by \u3008\u03b32e \u3009 \u2212 \u03932) to the total IC power. The figure shows that the IC power in internal motions is larger in \u03c3i = 3 than in \u03c3i = 1 simulations; this is expected since \u3008\u03b3e\u3009 \u221d \u03c3e \u221d \u03c3i, for the freshly accelerated electrons. While most of the electrons in the reconnection region are cooled down to nonrelativistic temperatures, narrow slivers of hot electrons are seen at X-points, where the energization timescale is faster than the IC cooling timescale (SB20, SSB21). The outskirts of plasmoids also appear hot because the electrons accelerated at X-points of the main layer and at plasmoid merger sites enter into neighboring plasmoids along their outer boundaries. Nonetheless, the internal motions\u2019 contribution to the IC power is highly sub-dominant relative to the one of bulk motions, in most of the layer. This conclusion, which we had derived for pair plasmas (SB20, SSB21), also holds in electron-ion plasmas."

In the following sections, our discussion of the particle motions involve plasmas with different compositions (i.e., electron-ion vs. e\u00b1 pair).

To ensure sufficient statistics, we calculate ux only in those cells with at least 4 particles, and then compute the density-weighted average in space (across the right half of the box with x/Lx > 0) and time (in the quasi-steady interval: 2 . T/(Lx/vA) . 5). This quantity, \u3008ux(x > 0)\u3009x, is presented in Fig. 3 for different \u03c4cool and \u03c3i. The error bars illustrate the stochasticity of the reconnection layer, i.e., the dispersion away from the mean bulk motion. We quantify this by the densityweighted spatio-temporal average of the standard deviation of ux (SSB21). Such stochastic motions can be crucial in determining the Comptonized spectrum. They can arise due various reasons including the different speeds of plasmoids with different sizes, and the fact that a few small plasmoids can move against the mean flow, being pulled back by a large plasmoid behind them.\nFig. 3 demonstrates that for a given \u03c3 the mean bulk outflow velocity \u3008ux\u3009, barely depends upon \u03c4cool\u2014akin to strongly cooled e\u00b1 plasmas with \u03c3 = \u03c3e\u00b1 > 10 (SSB21).

On the other hand, \u3008ux\u3009 is seen to be similar between electron-ion models with \u03c3 = \u03c3i = 3, and pair plasma simulations with \u03c3 = \u03c3e\u00b1 = 10 or 40. This shows that \u3008ux\u3009 is \u03c3-independent, and also independent of the plasma composition, for magnetizations \u03c3 & 3.\nA systematic increase in the stochasticity of the bulk outflow motions with increasing \u03c3 was identified in SSB21 for e\u00b1 plasmas. We broadly observe a similar effect here for electron-ion plasma. Considering the overall range of magnetizations, while the mean values \u3008ux\u3009 for \u03c3i = 3 and \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40 are nearly the same, the dispersion in the bulk outflow motions monotonically increases with magnetization, from \u03c3i = 1 up to \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40. This effect can be explained as follows. A higher dispersion is obtained for larger deviations of ux from the mean value. The largest ux is typically attained by the smallest plasmoids, and is given by the Alfve\u0301nic limit of ux,max \u223c \u221a \u03c3 (SB20, SSB21). We find that ux,max/\u3008ux\u3009 \u223c 1.8 for \u03c3 = \u03c3i = 1, whereas it is \u223c5.7 for \u03c3 = \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40. This result suggests that vigorous collisions of plasmoids (i.e., colliding with appreciably different speeds) are relatively less likely to occur in the low-\u03c3 regime considered here, as compared to the higher magnetization of our earlier works (SB20, SSB21). As an additional consequence, the secondary transverse reconnection layers (along y) formed between colliding plasmoids are rarer at lower \u03c3. Therefore, the contribution of y-directed bulk motions to the Comptonized emission gets smaller with lower \u03c3."

We specifically choose to compare the \u03c3 = \u03c3i = 3 and \u03c3 = \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40 models because they both correspond to the same electron magnetization \u03c3e \u223c 80 (for our choice of mi/me = 29 in electron-ion simulations). Fig. 4 shows the mean bulk energy per particle (\u3008\u0393\u3009\u22121) and the mean internal energy per particle (\u03b5int,e for electrons, \u03b5int,i for ions, normalized to their respective rest mass energies)7. The mean values are obtained by first performing a density-weighted average of the respective quantity over the reconnection region, and then a time-average over the interval 2 .

This is because the electron internal motions are determined by the electron magnetization \u03c3e, which controls the mean energy available per electron, and is similar between the \u03c3 = \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40 (\u03c3e = 80) and\n7 We refer readers to Appendix C in our Paper I (SSB21) for a detailed discussion of how the internal energies are calculated.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\n\u03c3 = \u03c3i = 3 (\u03c3e = 85.5) models, for mi/me = 29.

The fact that \u3008\u03b5int,i\u3009 does not depend on \u03c4cool allows one to conclude that energy is not transferred from the ions to the electrons, even when electrons are strongly cooled. In general, the electrons and ions are thermally decoupled if both collisional (Coulomb) and collisionless couplings are inefficient. Coulomb coupling is expected to be inefficient in the coronal plasma with \u03c3 > 1 (Appendix F; there, we also show that our simulations are well within the collisionless regime). Collisionless channels for ion-to-electron energy transfer could in principle occur, however we find they are not activated. As we describe in Appendix G, we have directly verified that the layer is not prone to collisionless ion velocity-space instabilities (e.g., ion-cyclotron, mirror, and firehose, see Sironi et al. 2015).\nAlso note in Fig. 4 that the value and trend of \u3008\u03b5int,i\u3009 as a function of \u03c4cool is identical to that of \u3008\u0393\u3009 \u2212 1.

Since \u03c4cool \u221d \u03b32cr/Lx, we can in principle modify either \u03b3cr or the size of the computational domain Lx (or both), in order to vary \u03c4cool. For a given \u03c3, we choose to fix \u03b3cr to a value such that \u03b3cr > \u03c3e/8 (see \u00a73), and only modify Lx. The spectra are then normalized by L 2 x for a fair comparison between simulations with different box sizes.\nFig. 5 presents the total energy spectra of electrons for different models: the magnetization increases from \u03c3i = 1 to 3 from top to bottom row, and the strength of IC cooling increases from \u03c4cool = 0.24 to 0.06 from left to right column. In addition to the total energy spectrum, each panel also shows the two chief components of the total spectrum\u2014the bulk motion, and the high-energy tail dominated by the internal motion. For completeness, we also compare in Fig. 6 the spectra of electrons and ions, between uncooled (\u03c4cool =\u221e) and cooled cases (\u03c4cool = 0.24) for \u03c3i = 3. Note that the cooled model is the same as the one in Fig. 5[g].\nIn the absence of IC cooling, the total energy spectrum (left panel of Fig. 6) of electrons in a \u03c3i = 3 (\u03c3e \u223c 85) electron-ion plasma peaks at \u03b3e \u2212 1 \u223c 10, which resembles that of the \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40 (\u03c3e = 80) model in e\n\u00b1 plasma (SSB21). This is because the mean Lorentz factor of the electrons energized by reconnection is proportional to \u03c3e, and in the absence of IC cooling, electrons retain the energy they acquired from field dissipation. On the other hand, in the presence of significant IC cooling (\u03c4cool = 0.24), the peak in the electron total spectrum shifts to trans-relativistic energies, \u03b3e \u2212 1 \u223c 0.7 for the \u03c3i = 3 model. By comparison with the right panel of Fig. 6, we conclude that in this regime the electron energy is controlled by bulk motions. In contrast, the total energy spectra of ions are insensitive to the strength of IC cooling, and peak at \u03b3i \u2212 1 \u223c 2 for \u03c3i = 3.\nFig. 5 shows that, in the strong cooling regime (0.24 > \u03c4cool > 0.06), the bulk component of the spectra peaks stably at trans-relativistic speeds, with a moderate increase with magnetization: \u0393\u2212 1 \u223c 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7, for \u03c3i = 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These are the energies where the total energy spectra peak as well, indicating that in the regime of strong cooling the electron energy is dominated by the bulk motion (see also \u00a74.2 and Fig. 4). This conclusion, which is especially clear for models with \u03c4cool = 0.06, is in agreement with our earlier results for e\u00b1 plasma (SB20, SSB21).\nFor all the models presented in Fig. 5, we also plot a Maxwell-Ju\u0308ttner distribution with kBTe = 100 keV. We showed in our earlier works (SB20, SSB21) that the spectrum of bulk motions in IC-cooled \u03c3 1 pair plasmas resembles a thermal distribution with kBTe = 100 keV. The bulk motion spectra in our electron-ion plasmas\u2014for 1 . \u03c3i . 2\u2014also have peak energies comparable to the same Maxwellian. Yet, the bulk spectra for our electron-ion cases are narrower than the Maxwellian, whereas they had comparable widths in our earlier electron-positron studies (SSB21). This can be understood from the level of stochasticity in the plasma outflow. In fact, the reconnection region is more disordered\u2014with plasmoids moving at a wide range of speeds\u2014for larger \u03c3 (see also Fig. 3). Such stochastic motions will manifest as a broader energy spectrum\u2014with a wider peak\u2014for higher magnetizations.\nThe higher energy tail of the spectra (i.e., blue dotted curves in Fig. 5), cannot be accounted for by the bulk motions alone, and is instead dominated by the internal motions. As shown in Fig. 2, the electrons belonging to this\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\ncomponent are produced at inter-plasmoid regions (near Xpoints) in the main layer or at the interface of merging plasmoids (we refer to SB20 and SSB21 for more details). These electrons do radiate a considerable fraction (fHE) of the total IC power, which is quoted in each panel of Fig. 5. For our considered models, fHE ranges from 39% (for \u03c3i = 1, \u03c4cool = 0.06) to 77% (for \u03c3i = 3, \u03c4cool = 0.24). For a given \u03c4cool, fHE increases by \u223c 9% from \u03c3i = 1 to 3 and, for a given \u03c3i, fHE decreases by \u223c 28% from \u03c4cool = 0.24 to 0.06. We also find that, for a given \u03c4cool, fHE is generally larger in\nelectron-ion simulations (for \u03c3i \u2265 1) than it is in pair plasma simulations (for \u03c3e\u00b1 1; SSB21). This is because the high energy component of the spectrum that determines fHE is defined as the difference between the total spectrum and its bulk component; the narrower shape of the bulk spectrum in our electron-ion simulations\u2014compared to our pair plasma cases\u2014then enhances the impact of the high energy component, thus leading to a larger fHE.\nThe high energy component displays a \u2018knee\u2019 at \u03b3e\u22121 \u223c 10. This is populated predominantly by electrons acceler-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\nated at strong X-points near the center of the reconnection layer. The extent over which such X-points appear is \u223c 500 c/\u03c9pe regardless of Lx, which implies that the prominence of the high-energy knee decreases with increasing box size, since the fractional importance of the central X-points drops. This can be seen from all rows of Fig. 5 where the simulation box size increases from left to right. Even larger simulations will be needed to assess whether the normalization of the high-energy knee eventually settles to a fixed (i.e., box-independent) fraction of the overall particle count, or whether it keeps dropping as \u221d L\u22121x ."

The photons are then followed in time, as they scatter across the reconnection region, thereby producing a Comptonized, hard X-ray spectrum.\nWe divide the region |x| < Lx, |y| < H = Lx/3 into 60\u00d7 20 patches, and for each photon scattering event, the particle momentum is drawn from the local distribution function in the patch. The transfer simulation is then evolved in time (between T/(Lx/vA) = 2.5 and T/(Lx/vA) = 5.5), with updating the particle distribution function every 0.5Lx/vA. The overall normalization of the plasma density is parameterized using the Thomson optical depth \u03c4T = H\u03c3Tn0. We adjust the optical depth across the reconnection layer to ob-\ntain a Compton amplification factor8 A \u2248 10, which gives the Comptonized spectrum with a photon index of \u0393 \u223c 1.5 (defined as dN/dE \u221d E\u2212\u0393, where N is the number of photons with energy E) typical for the hard state spectra of accreting black holes. In analogy to the PIC simulation, we employ outflow boundary conditions for the Monte Carlo calculation (see Appendix H for different choices of boundary conditions).\nFig. 7 shows the spectrum of radiation escaping from the reconnection region for two models, with \u03c3i = 1 (dotted) and \u03c3i = 3 (dashed), adopting the same \u03c4cool = 0.06. The emitted spectrum varies with time as reconnection proceeds, and Fig. 7 shows the emission averaged over the time interval 2.5 . T/(Lx/c) . 5.5. We observe that the spectrum peaks around 40 keV for \u03c3i = 1 and 100 keV for \u03c3i = 3. This shift is primarily caused by the increase in plasmoid speeds at higher \u03c3i, see Fig. 3. The model with \u03c3i = 3 (dashed) is remarkably close to the typical hard-state of Cygnus X1 observed in a broad band of 1 \u2212 1000 keV. For comparison, we over-plot in Fig. 7 the data available from BeppoSAX and CGRO/OSSE. The deviation of the data from the model at low photon energies (. 1 keV) is expected from inter-stellar absorption. The observed excess at higher energies (&1 MeV) is also well reproduced by our \u03c3i = 3 model. However, we caution that the particles responsible for this high-energy component belong to the high-energy knee in Fig. 5, whose prominence may become vanishingly small in the asymptotic (realistic) limit of very large domains. In this case, the high-energy photons at &1 MeV may be due to coronal regions with \u03c3i > 3."

            "text": "The main goal of this series of papers is to explore the mechanism that gives rise to the observed hard X-ray spectra of accreting black holes. In the previous papers (SB20, SSB21), we performed 2D and 3D PIC simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection in e\u00b1 plasmas subject to strong IC cooling\u2014as appropriate to the most magnetically dominated regions of black hole coronae closer to the jet\u2014and found that thermal Comptonization of soft seed photons by hot electrons is an unfeasible mechanism. In fact, due to the strong IC losses, electrons get cooled down to non-relativistic temperatures. Nonetheless, we demonstrated that the hard X-ray spectra can be produced via Comptonization by the bulk motions of the Compton-cooled plasmoid chain (Beloborodov 2017). In this paper II, we have performed the first simulations of trans-relativistic magnetic reconnection (\u03c3 \u223c 1) in electron-ion plasma subject to the effects of IC cooling. This is a regime that can be most relevant to the moderately-magnetized regions of coronae adjacent to the accretion disk. Our main results are as follows.\n(i) Regardless of the strength of IC cooling (\u03c4cool) or magnetization (\u03c3), the reconnection layer breaks into a hierarchical chain of plasmoids. We also demonstrate that the rate at which reconnection proceeds is independent of the strength\n8 The factor A is the ratio of the average energy of escaping photons to the average energy of injected soft photons.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\n10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121 100 Energy [mec\n2]\nof IC cooling, and nearly independent of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, mi/me.\n(ii) The bulk motions of the plasmoid chain dominate the total IC power in the strong cooling regime. The mean energy in bulk motions is independent of the strength of IC cooling. On the other hand, the mean 4-velocity of bulk motions increases by a factor of two between \u03c3i = 1 and 3, before saturating at a value that is consistent with our earlier results for larger magnetizations \u03c3 \u2265 10 (SSB21). This shows that the typical speed of bulk motions becomes \u03c3independent only for \u03c3 & 3.\n(iii) For a wide range of IC cooling strengths (0.06 \u2264 \u03c4cool \u2264 1.32), the internal energy per electron for \u03c3i = 3 behaves remarkably similar to its \u03c3e\u00b1 = 40 counterpart in e\u00b1 plasma. This is because the electron magnetization is \u03c3e \u223c 80 in both cases, and \u03c3e determines the electron internal energy. The electron internal energy scales linearly with \u03c4cool in the range we explored, and attains non-relativistic temperatures \u223c 5 keV for strong cooling, \u03c4cool \u223c 0.06.\n(iv) The radiatively inefficient ions retain the heat gained from reconnection, and their mean energy stays independent of \u03c4cool. Thus, the IC-cooled electrons are not re-heated by the hot ions. This renders the electrons incapable of powering thermal Comptonization, regardless of the plasma composition.\n(v) The peak of the electrons\u2019 bulk energy spectra for ICcooled trans-relativistic reconnection is generally narrower\u2014 indicating a more ordered outflow\u2014than it is for relativis-\ntic (\u03c3 1) reconnection in e\u00b1 plasma. For strong cooling, the total electron spectra are dominated by their bulk component\u2014whose peak energy increases with \u03c3i. For \u03c3i = 2 the spectral peak coincides with that of a Maxwellian distribution with a temperature of 100 keV. The high energy tail of the spectra\u2014that are not accounted for by bulk motions\u2014 are due to electrons accelerated at X-points, on a timescale faster than IC losses. In the limit of strong cooling, the fraction of radiated IC power contributed by these hot electrons is about 40% for 1 \u2264 \u03c3i \u2264 3.\n(vi) We find that reconnection layers in BH coronae with \u03c3i = 3 can Compton-upscatter soft photons to non-thermal energies and explain the typical hard-state spectrum of accreting black holes. Such a spectrum peaks near 100 keV, and is primarily shaped by the bulk motions of plasmoids laden with cold (IC-cooled) electrons (whereas ions remain hot). The high-energy MeV tail may be produced by hot electrons quickly energized at X-points.\nIn the future, it may be useful to investigate how the results change for an electron-positron-ion plasma (e.g., Petropoulou et al. 2019, for the non-radiative case), in the presence of a stronger guide field, and for an asymmetric reconnection layer. Also, it has recently been shown that the physics of particle acceleration in reconnection is significantly different between 2D and 3D (Zhang et al. 2021). In 2D, electrons are pre-accelerated near X-points up to \u03b3X \u223c \u03c3e/8 (e.g., Sironi 2022), and then they get advected\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\ninto plasmoids, where further energization proceeds slowly (e.g., Petropoulou & Sironi 2018; Hakobyan et al. 2020). Instead, in 3D some of the particles with \u03b3 & \u03b3X can escape from plasmoids and experience the large-scale electric field in the inflow region, resulting in fast acceleration (Zhang et al. 2021), potentially up to \u03b3cr.

As we have discussed in the main text, the overall dynamics of the reconnection layer, including the rate of reconnection, is nearly independent of mi/me (see \u00a74.1 and Fig. 1). In Fig. B1, we show that the mean total energy of electrons \u3008\u03b3e \u2212 1\u3009 stays constant for a wide range of mass ratios, 7 . mi/me . 1836. A modest increase by a factor of \u223c3 is seen in the mean bulk energy \u3008\u0393\u3009 \u2212 1 while mi/me decreases by a factor of \u223c260. Furthermore, this is observable only for \u03c3i \u223c 3, and not for \u03c3i = 1 (Fig. B2). For the purposes of our study, the choice of an artificially low mass ratio mi/me = 29, as compared to its realistic value mi/me = 1836, is not expected to impair the prospects of cold-chain Comptonization due to bulk motions. However, it is still valuable to check whether modest quantitative changes in the shape of the X-ray spectrum may come with higher, realistic mass ratios. This is left for future work."

Rather than resolving \u03bbDe by increasing R\u2014which is computationally very demanding (for our requirement of low \u03c4cool, and so, a large Lx/(c/\u03c9pe))\u2014we initialize a relatively hotter upstream plasma: instead of our fiducial upstream temperature of \u03b8e = kBTe/mec\n2 = 10\u22124, we now consider a temperature of \u03b8e = 0.02. While this is still cold enough compared to the energies particles attain as a result of reconnection (which is the regime we want to be in, as prefaced above), this choice of temperature also resolves \u03bbDe with 1 cell assuming the same fiducial resolution of R = 5.

However, the plasmas in PIC simulations differ from real astrophysical plasmas due to \u2018coarse-graining\u2019, i.e., multiple particles are represented in the computer by a single macro-particle. This approach\u2014while numerically beneficial\u2014can artificially enhance the thermal coupling between electrons and ions via Coulomb collisions (Melzani et al. 2014c). Clearly, the artificial Coulomb coupling is not significant in our simulations, since the plasma ends up with two temperatures (hot ions and cold electrons; see Fig. 4). This fact can also be seen using the following estimate for the Coulomb coupling timescale (Spitzer 1965; Stepney 1983; Melzani et al. 2013),\ntei = 3mimec\n3\n8 \u221a 2\u03c0e4 1 N ( kBTe mec2 + kBTi mic2 )3/2 . (F1)\nwhere N has units of particles per unit volume. The expression for N differs between two and three dimensions, due to the different volume element in the space of impact parameters: in 3D we have N = n ln \u039b, where n is the number of particles per unit volume, ln \u039b = ln (bmax/bmin) is the Coulomb logarithm, and bmin and bmax are the minimum and maximum impact parameters for the Coulomb interaction,\nrespectively. In 2D, instead, N = 2\u03c0n2D (\n1 bmin \u2212 1 bmax\n) '\n2\u03c0n2D/bmin, where n2D is the number of particles per unit area (as appropriate for a 2D simulation). The maximum impact parameter bmax is the electron Debye length, \u03bbDe =\u221a kBTe/4\u03c0n0e2. In real astrophysical plasmas, the minimum impact parameter bmin is the classical distance of closest approach. Instead, in PIC simulations it shall be taken as the characteristic size of macro-particles, which is comparable to the grid spacing \u03b4.\nFor our 2D simulations, we take a 2D density of n2D ' n0 = 4 particles per cell, temperatures kBTe/mec\n2 kBTi/mic2, and the reduced mass ratio mi/me = 29 of our simulations. Then we obtain tei \u2248 3\u00d7105 \u03c9\u22121pe (kBTi/0.5mic2)3/2. Note that this is much longer than the timescale for plasma advection out of the reconnection layer: tei/(Lx/vA) \u2248 60 (for the most constraining case of our largest simulation with Lx/(c/\u03c9p) = 6720, and \u03c3i = 3). This confirms that Coulomb energy exchange is weak in our PIC simulations.\nMarginally important Coulomb coupling is expected in real black-hole coronae with high magnetizations \u03c3 > 1. It can be evaluated using the expression for tei, but now with realistic plasma parameters. The ratio of the Coulomb and advection timescales may be written in the following form,\ntei Lx/vA \u223c mi/me 10 \u03c4T ln \u039b (vA c )2( kBTi mic2 )3/2 , Te me Ti mi .\n(F2) Coulomb logarithm ln \u039b \u223c 20 is determined by the characteristic plasma density n = \u03c4T/h\u03c3T where h \u2248 0.1(vA/c)Lx is a fraction of the system size (a fraction of the black hole radius). Using \u03c4T \u223c 1, (vA/c)2 = \u03c3/(1 + \u03c3), and kBTi \u223c (\u03c3/4)mic\n2, we obtain a rough estimate tei/(Lx/vA) \u223c \u03c35/2/(1 + \u03c3). For a large \u03c3 > 1, tei/(Lx/vA) exceeds unity, and the ions are not expected to pass their energy to elec-\ntrons via Coulomb collisions. The Coulomb coupling becomes important at lower \u03c3 \u223c 1."

            "text": "In this section, we examine the reconnection layer for the potential occurrence of collisionless ion velocity-space instabilities, that could transfer thermal energy between ions and electrons. We calculate in the reconnection region the ion temperature anisotropy parameter Ai = T i\u22a5/T i\u2016 \u2212 1, where T i\u22a5 and T i \u2016 are the temperatures of the ions perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field, respectively. The temperature elements are obtained as follows. The stressenergy tensor and the electromagnetic tensor are Lorentz boosted to the plasma comoving frame. A rotation matrix is then computed\u2014using Rodrigues\u2019 rotation formula\u2014so that the local comoving magnetic field gets oriented along y\u0302. The Lorentz boosted stress-energy tensor is then rotated with this rotation matrix. The diagonal elements of thus obtained tensor correspond to the temperatures along different axes. In this case, T\u2016 = Tyy and T\u22a5 = (Txx + Tzz)/2.\nIn the presence of ion temperature anisotropy, the plasma can develop either ion-cyclotron/mirror instabilities for Ai > 0, or firehose instability for Ai < 0 (Hall 1979). Fig. G1 shows a 2D map of Ai along the reconnection layer (panel [b]). One can see that the ions\u2019 temperatures are fairly isotropic in reconnection plasmoids, that contain most of the particles (compare with the ion density in panel [a]). Furthermore, it is evident that the ion-cyclotron/mirror instabilities are non-operational throughout the layer (because Ai \u226f 1), precluding the possibility of ion-to-electron thermal energy transfer through this channel (e.g., Sironi et al. 2015). On the other hand, the periphery of the reconnection layer exhibits regions (with Ai < 0) possibly prone to the firehose instability. This is understandable, as the freshly injected particles in the periphery of the layer slide along the local magnetic field lines before eventually entering the plasmoids.\nThe threshold condition for the firehose instability is given by (Hellinger et al. 2006),\nT i\u22a5 T i\u2016 \u2212 1 = a (\u03b2\u2016 \u2212 \u03b20)b , (G1)\nwhere \u03b2\u2016 = 8\u03c0nikBT i \u2016/B 2 is the parallel ion plasma-\u03b2, and a, b and \u03b20 are obtained from empirical fitting (Gary et al. 1998; Samsonov et al. 2001; Hellinger et al. 2006; Bale et al. 2009). The relevant modes in the case of Ai < 0 are the parallel firehose (Quest & Shapiro 1996) and the oblique firehose (Hellinger & Matsumoto 2000). Assuming isotropic Maxwellian electrons, the thresholds for these modes are\nTof = (\u03b2\u2016 + 0.11)Ai + 1.4 < 0 (oblique firehose), (G2) Tpf = (\u03b2\u2016 \u2212 0.59)0.53Ai + 0.47 < 0 (parallel firehose).(G3)\nWe see from panel [c] of Fig. G1 that most of the reconnection region does not obey the condition Tof < 0 required for the growth of the oblique firehose instability. On the other hand, Tpf < 0 is satisfied along the periphery of the reconnection region\u2014indicating that the parallel firehose instability may grow there (panel [d]). However, note that neither parallel nor oblique modes of firehose instabilities are seen\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\ny/ L x\n[a] i = 3; cool = 0.06\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\ny/ L x\n[b]\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\ny/ L x\n[c]\n-1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.25 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 x/Lx\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\ny/ L x\n[d]\n0 1 2 3 4 5 n i /n 0\n1\n0\n1\ni\n1\n0\n1\nof\n1\n0\n1\npf\nFigure G1.

We can therefore confirm that ion velocity-space instabilities do not play any significant role in the transfer of thermal energy from ions to electrons, as our results indicate in the main text."

            "text": "Our PIC simulations employ outflow boundary conditions in the x direction of reconnection exhausts. In this Appendix, we demonstrate the effect of employing different boundary conditions for the Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculation. In our previous work (SSB21), we extracted X-ray spectra from electron-positron simulations of reconnection in strongly magnetized plasma. There, the radiative transfer code assumed periodic boundaries in the x direction. A more appropriate choice\u2014as we have done in the main body of this paper\u2014is to employ outflow boundaries for the Monte Carlo calculation, in analogy to the open boundaries of the PIC simulation. As shown in Fig. H1, at fixed magnetization, the X-ray spectrum peaks at higher energies in the case of periodic boundaries. This is expected, since in this case photons crossing the boundary can efficiently scatter off an oppositely-directed flow, thus increasing their energy.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX file prepared by the author.\n100 101 102 103\nEnergy [keV]\n10\u22121\n100\n101\nE f E\n[k eV\ncm \u2212\n2 s\u2212\n1 ]\nOutflow boundary condition Periodic boundary condition\n\u03c3 = 10\n\u03c3 = 40\n10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121 100 Energy [mec\n2]\nFigure H1.

The brown and blue curves are obtained by employing outflow and periodic boundary conditions, respectively.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2020)"
