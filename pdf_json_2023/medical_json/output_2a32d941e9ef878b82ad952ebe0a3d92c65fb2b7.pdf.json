            "text": "Page 2/21\n1. Introduction BCP is a symptom caused by tumor metastasis and can occur at any time during the disease course [1]. The prevalence of BCP is 50.7% in all cancer stages and 66.4% in advanced stages [2], so BCP is a severe problem worldwide. The migration of cancer to the bone can cause severe pain, and up to 85% of patients suffer from BCP [3]. Patients with BCP usually have persistent pain that can worsen as the disease progresses [4\u20136]. That is to say, patients with different pain experiences may have different potential pathology and need distinct therapeutic options [7]. Therefore, a more in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism of BCP and the development of potential drugs are imminent, which is no less important than the treatment of cancer itself.\nBCP is a complex pain with both neuropathic and in ammatory pain syndromes, therefore, it is di cult to treat clinically [8]. Mechanisms of BCP are complex, and the main mechanisms that have been reported so far including ion channels and receptors involved in sensing changes in temperature and acidic microenvironment [9, 10], immune system activation [11\u201313], sodium channels [14\u201316], proteaseactivated receptors [17] and the like.\nDespite progress in medical science research, researchers have been unable to make signi cant progress in developing a reliable BCP treatment. Nonetheless, the World Health Organization has proposed a threestep analgesic ladder for BCP therapy, with non-opioid analgesics being prescribed rst, followed by weak and strong opioids if the pain persists [18]. Opioids, such as morphine and pentazocine, and non-steroidal\nPage 3/21\nanti-in ammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and indomethacin, are currently available for pain management. Both NSAIDs and opioids have various adverse effects, including respiratory depression, cardiovascular problems, gastrointestinal damage, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity [19].\nThroughout history, herbal plants have been widely used to relieve pain with lower side effects. For example, morphine and acetyl salicylic acid are two of the most important analgesics derived from plant sources [20, 21]. Butein (3,4,2\u2032,4\u2032-Tetrahydroxychalcone) is a chalcone chemical found in Toxicodendron vernici uum, Dalbergia odorifera and Semecarpus odorifera [22, 23]. Butein has been demonstrated to have many therapeutic effects including anticancer, anti-in ammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant properties [24], anti-depressive [25] and neuroprotective [26] characteristics. Although the pharmacological effects of butein had been widely reported, its analgesic effect on BCP remains to be further studied.\nIn this study, in order to further select the potential drugs to treat BCP, the GEO dataset was used to obtain a list of DEGs. Then, through the CMap 2.0 database, we found that butein may be a potential drug. Next, we deeply analyzed the likely targets and molecular mechanisms behind butein's anti-BCP actions using the network pharmacology method. To begin, we used chemical similarity analysis and reversed docking to identify the molecular targets of butein. Various bioinformatics tools were used to identify pathological targets. After that, we completed KEGG enrichment analysis using KOBAS 3.0 database and formed a target-pathway network. Finally, the interactions between butein and its hub targets were veri ed using molecular docking.\n2. Method The experimental ow is shown in Fig.\u00a01.\n2.1 Data collection and data processing Genes were screened by using the GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) database. We retrieved one GSE data (GSE149648) concerning the microarray changes in the Rattus norvegicus dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after BCP[27], 16 samples were analyzed from four groups, including tumor cell injection (TCI, Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma cell) D1, TCI D7, TCI D14, and sham as control. Each group has four replicates. The microarray data was analyzed at various time points, including day 1, 7, and 14 following TCI. Following that, we looked at transcriptome changes in various stages of BCP development. Perl converted the names of microarray probes to gene symbols. The DEGs were obtained in each dataset using the limma package in R, with |log2 FoldChange(FC)|>1 and a P-value < 0.05 as the cutoff criteria. Next, we converted DEGs to human gene symbols as implemented in the \u201chomologene\u201d R package. 2.2 Identi cation of Pathological Targets BCP-related targets were identi ed using Human Pain Genes Database (HPGD, https://humanpaingenetics.org/), the DrugBank database (https://go.drugbank.com/), Genecard\nPage 4/21\n(https://www.genecards.org), Open Targets Platform (OPT, https://platform.opentargets.org/), OMIM (https://www.omim.org/). These targets were supposed to be pathogenic targets after putting these targets together and removing the duplicates. Following that, the overlap of DEGs and pathogenic targets were established. 2.3 CMap 2.0 was used for drug prediction The intersecting genes uploaded to the CMap 2.0 database (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) to predict possible medicines for BCP. And the medication with a |enrichment|\u22650.9 and a P value 0.05 were chosen as BCP candidate medications. 2.4 Predict the pharmacological targets of butein and pathway enrichment analysis Similarity ensemble approach (SEA, https://sea.bkslab.org/), Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD, http://ctdbaseorg/), Swiss Target Prediction (http://swisstargetprediction.ch/) and Super-PRED (https://prediction.charite.de/) were used to predicted the potential therapeutic targets of butein. The candidate genes were identi ed and corrected by using the Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/). The potential pharmacological targets of butein were selected and subjected to KEGG pathway analysis. For KEGG enrichment analysis (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/), pathways were selected by their enrichment scores. 2.5 Identi cation of shared genes in butein and pathogenic targets The shared gene set A (GSA) associated with butein and pathogenic targets were overlapped using Venn (https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/). ClueGO is a Cytoscape plug-in, which could categorize the non-redundant Gene ontology (GO) terms and visualize them as a functionally grouped network. To explore potential roles of these shared genes in treatment of BCP, a biological analysis of these shared genes was performed by ClueGO. The biological process of GO analysis was focused. The p-value < 0.05 was considered signi cant. Next, the GSA is uploaded to Metascape (https://metascape.org/) for module functional analysis, the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm was applied to identify densely connected network components. Pathway and process enrichment analyses were applied to each MCODE component independently, while the three best-scoring terms by p-value were retained as the functional description of the corresponding components [28]. 2.6 Identifying hub targets of butein against BCP The hub targets were constructed by intersecting the butein and pathogenic targets, and Protein Protein Interactions (PPI) networks were constructed through the STRING (https://string-db.org/) platform using the target proteins selected above. A high con dence score of greater than 0.4 was used in the present study to obtain PPI data. Cytoscape v3.7.1 was used to show the PPI network. The network topology parameters were calculated using Network Analyzer [29], with the network being viewed as undirected. We\nPage 5/21\ncalculated the topological scores for the nodes using the CytoNCA plugin (version 2.1.6), including betweenness, closeness, degree, and subgraph centrality. 2.7 Molecular docking The binding situation and interaction force of proteins and small molecules can be anticipated and acquired via molecular docking research. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform database (TCMSP, https://tcmsp-e.com/) was used to nd the molecular structure of butein. The Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/) provided the X-ray crystal structures of the proteins. The proteins were then stripped of their water molecules and heteroatoms using PyMOL 2.4. We handled the protein receptor and ligand les with AutoDock Tools1.5.6, including inserting hydrogen atoms, computing Gasteiger charges, and integrating nonpolar hydrogen atoms, and making rotatable torsion bonds. A pdbqt le was then created from them. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to perform molecular docking between butein and the core targets using AutoDock software[30]. PyMOL 2.4 and Discovery Studio Visualizer 2016 are used for visualization.\n3. Results\n3.1 Identi cation of DEGs The transcriptome alterations at various stages of BCP development were analyzed through GEO database. DEGs were screened for further functional analysis using cut-offs of |log2 FoldChange (FC)|>1 and P-value < 0.05 between two comparable groups. The volcanos in Figs.\u00a02A-C depict representative distribution of DEGs. One day after TCI treatment, 68 genes were up-regulated, while 44 genes were downregulated. In comparison with the sham-operated group, differential gene expression peaked on day 7 following TCI with 809 genes up-regulated and 203 genes down-regulated. Comparing the TCI group to the sham-operated group, 601 genes were up-regulated on day 14 and 148 genes were down-regulated. Therefore, these DEGs might play a crucial role in regulating the genesis of BCP. Finally, 701 up-regulated genes and 239 down-regulated genes were obtained by converting these DEGs to human orthologs (Supplementary Table\u00a01).\n3.2 Identi cation of potential therapeutic targets To obtain potential therapeutic targets, 844 targets associated with BCP have been identi ed by using HPGD, Drugbank, Genecard, OMIM, and Open Targets Platform (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Next, 68 intersection genes of DEGs with 844 targets were displayed by using Venn diagram, of which 48 targets were up-regulated and 20 targets were down-regulated (Fig.\u00a02D). 3.3 Butein is a candidate drug for BCP In order to search for potential drugs to treat BCP, CMap 2.0 was used to perform drug prediction on 68 DEGs, and two potential drugs, butein and phenazone, were obtained.\nPage 6/21\nPrevious research has shown that butein has anti-in ammatory and antioxidative stress properties, and therefore has a therapeutic effect on various in ammatory disorders [22, 31]. Recent research found that butein could signi cantly reduce pain in mice caused by thermal and chemical stimulation, and can signi cantly reduce carrageenan-induced paw edema and in ammatory cell in ltration in mice [21]. Therefore, butein was selected for further network pharmacology study. 3.4 The prediction of the pharmacological targets of butein and pathway enrichment analysis A total of 275 targets of butein were obtained from CTD, SEA, TargetNet, Super-PRED, and Literature supplement [31] (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Besides, these targets were uploaded to the KOBAS 3.0 database for KEGG enrichment analysis. Then, the top 20 related pathways with the highest enrichment of BCP-related genes were selected to construct the target pathway network by using Sangerbox 3.0 (http://vip.sangerbox.com/home.html) cloud platform (Fig.\u00a03A). The results showed that the remarkably enriched 275 potential targets were mainly belonged to \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, Sphingolipid signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway.\u201d According to the annotation of KEGG, 128 of the 275 (46.5%) targets were dramatically enriched in 20 pathways with BCP association (Supplementary Table\u00a04). According to the statistical analysis, 12 targets were engaged in the top 20 pathways (Fig.\u00a03B) extremely frequently (\u2265 7 times), indicating that they have important roles in the enriched pathways. The 12 core targets were PIK3R1, MAP2K2, RELA, NFKB1, PRKACA, FOS, JUN, IKBKG, AKT1, TNF, PRKCG, and EGFR.\n3.5 The common genes in butein and pathogenic targets To obtain therapeutic targets associated with BCP, there were 65 genes overlapped in related of butein and pathogenic targets, which was de ned as gene set A (GSA) (Fig.\u00a04A). To explore the potential functions of GSA, we performed the GO enrichment analysis with GlueGo. The top three signi cantly enriched GO terms about biological process (BP) were \u201cmonoamine transport\u201d, \u201cregulation of blood circulation\u201d and \u201cchemical synaptic transmission postsynaptic\u201d. The three terms accounted for 76.47% of total GO terms, and was associated with 49 genes (Figs.\u00a04B, C), con rming that these terms maybe of vital importance for butein treatment of BCP. It was further constructed the PPI network with the 68 potential targets by STRING and searched the similar function clusters of the PPI network by MCODE analysis based on topology (Fig.\u00a05A). Similar function subnetworks were constructed, and function analysis showed that MCODE 1 mainly participated in the GPCR ligand binding. MCODE 2 speci cally regulates the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. MCODE 3 mainly regulates the regulation of miRNA transcription. MCODE 4 mainly regulates the Calcium signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a05B). 3.6 Identi cation of hub targets and PPI network construction In order to obtain essential targets from GSA, the Network Analyzer evaluated the topological characteristics of the node degree, and the CytoNCA plugin computed the four centralities (betweenness,\nPage 7/21\ncloseness, degree, and subgraph) to identify the critical nodes and key targets in the PPI network, as shown in Fig.\u00a06A (Supplementary Table\u00a05). Based on the overlap of the top ten targets in each of the four different categories, AKT1, TNF, CASP3, FOS, EGFR, PTGS2, VEGFA, ESR1, ACHE, and TRPV1 were considered as critical proteins with signi cant centrality values based on network topology analysis. Combining the 12 core targets and 10 essential targets, 18 hub targets were obtained, which were submitted to STRING database to obtain the protein network relationship composed of 18 nodes and 98 edges. Cytoscape v3.8.2 was used to establish the protein interaction results (Fig.\u00a06B).\n3.7 Molecular docking Docking analyses were carried out between butein and 18 hub targets. To measure the bonding strength between the docked molecules, the binding energy (Vina score) was employed, and the results showed that butein might have potential binding effect with these proteins. Since previous studies have found that butein speci cally inhibits EGFR [32], it is used as a positive control for molecular docking. Therefore, seven hub targets, namely EGFR, JUN, VEGFA, TRPV1, PTGS2, AKT1, and ESR1, were nally obtained according to the binding energy with butein less than that of EGFR (Supplementary Table\u00a06). The docking mode and binding site of butein and hub targets were shown in Fig.\u00a07.\n4. Discussion Cancer is the world's second leading cause of mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income nations. According to the World Health Organization's cancer data page, around 10\u00a0million people died of cancer worldwide in 2020 [33]. The majority of cancer patients suffer from BCP, and almost 75\u201390% of metastatic cancer patients report it as a challenging clinical problem [34]. In view of the complex mechanism of BCP, despite decades of extensive research and continuous efforts, the underlying cellular and molecular pathways remain unclear, and clinical options for BCP treatment are limited [35, 36]. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanism of BCP and drug development are crucial for the treatment of BCP [37].\nIn this study, DEGs analysis integrated with the CMap 2.0 database indicated butein as a prospective medicine for BCP, and network pharmacology results obtained butein related molecular functions and pharmacological targets for BCP treatment. In order to explore the complex mechanism of 275 anti-BCP targets, these targets were submitted to KOBAS 3.0 database for pathway enrichment analysis, and the interaction between butein and hub targets were evaluated by molecular docking technology. The results showed that HIF-1 signaling pathway, Sphingolipid signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, and NFkappa B signaling pathway were signi cantly enriched, and 7 targets were identi ed as the hub targets. The ndings could help researchers better understand the effects of butein on the treatment of BCP, as well as direct future research into the development of butein as an analgesic drug.\nThe activity of HIF-1 signaling pathway is closely related to the occurrence and progression of BCP. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 \u03b1 (HIF-1 \u03b1) is a regulatory subunit of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [38],\nPage 8/21\nwhich can activate downstream pathways and further affect autophagy, while autophagy de ciency will further affect several pain transmission elements, such as Spinal GABAergic interneurons [39], Spinal microglia [40], Schwann cells [41], and dorsal root ganglion neurons [42], In addition, HIF-1 can also affect the contact between tumor cells and neurons[43], VEGF signal transduction[44]. Therefore, Butein may inhibit BCP by affecting HIF-1 signaling pathway and initiating multiple downstream pathways. It is the complex pathway network composed of these individual pathways and the cross-talk between them that enables multiple complementary functions for treating BCP with butein.\nSphingolipids were found to play a part in increasing the pain response by affecting several critical pathways, including triggering an immunological response, activating spinal astrocytes, and activating the TRPM3 channel [45]. Recently, the role of sphingolipid signaling in BCP was further discovered. Many types of pain diseases, including neuropathic pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), diabetic neuropathy, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), are mediated by S1P, a sphingosinederived in ammatory product, its signal-mediated. [46]. Therefore, butein may further regulate the production of SIP by affecting in ammatory mediators such as TNF and NLRP2, and prevent the further development of BCP. In summary, we performed pathway enrichment analysis on 275 butein targets, and nally screened out 20 pathways related to BCP, with the top 3 pathways described in detail (Fig.\u00a08).\nTo better understand the ameliorative role of butein in the treatment of BCP, we performed pathway and process enrichment analysis for the GSA. The two enrichment methods demonstrate each other, further demonstrating that butein may play a role in the treatment of BCP through various biological processes and pathways. Besides, to nd the hub targets, two methodologies were utilized separately: PPI centrality analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. We identi ed the essential proteins based on the centrality and node degree of the PPI network, which included AKT1, TNF, CASP3, FOS, EGFR, PTGS2, VEGFA, ESR1, ACHE, and TRPV1. The most vital parts in the network are frequently played by nodes with high centralities and node degrees. Because of their high frequency of participation, AKT1, PIK3R1, MAP2K2, RELA, NFKB1, PRKACA, FOS, JUN, IKBKG, TNF, PRKCG, and EGFR were regarded as necessary among the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways. Subsequently, the potential interaction between butein and the obtained 18 targets was further veri ed by molecular docking. The binding energies of both the active component and the target protein were all below than \u2212 4.5 kcal/moL, ensuring better docking and binding activity [47]. Using EGFR as a positive control, we nally obtained seven hub targets, namely EGFR, JUN, VEGFA, TRPV1, PTGS2, AKT1 and ESR1, which might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of BCP. In addition, further investigation through the literature found that among the seven hub targets, TRPV1 and ESR1 might become new targets for butein therapy of BCP.\nTRPV1 exists in many tissues [48], especially in dorsal root ganglions (DRGs), and its role in various pain states is well established [49], including in ammatory pain and cancer pain[50]. In addition, TRPV1 signaling is reportedly reinforced by a variety of in ammatory mediators, including NO, H2O2, serotonin (5-HT), protease-activated receptor (PAR) activators, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), histamine, calcitoningene-related peptide (CGRP), endocannabinoids, nerve growth factor (NGF), prostaglandins, tumor\nPage 9/21\nnecrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), resulting in painful hypersensitivity [51\u201353].\nIn BCP, ESR1 activation and enhanced expression were detected in the DRG. Studies of gene polymorphisms suggest that ESR1 polymorphisms affect downstream COMT activity, which in turn affects pain score and worse self-reported health [54]. Recently, research has shown that estrogen is essential for the IL-23/IL-17A/TRPV1 axis to evoke mechanical pain in females and further enables IL-23 and IL-17A to produce mechanical pain in males via ESR1. And importantly, ESR1 expression by TRPV1+ nociceptors is necessary for inducing female mechanical pain by IL-23, IL-17A, and capsaicin [55]. Therefore, we hypothesized that butein may have different mechanisms for its analgesic effect in male and female individuals.\nThe network analysis results provide a theoretical foundation as well as critical details that may help understanding the mechanisms underlying butein's therapeutic e cacy and discovering potential targets, but further experimental validation of the hub genes and interactions will be required in the future, and the clinical effect of butein on BCP awaits further investigation.\n5. Conclusion Our ndings indicated butein as a novel therapeutic candidate for BCP. Bioinformatics and network analysis were used to study the hub genes and molecular mechanisms behind butein's hypoxia, antiin ammatory, and anti-oxidant stress on BCP. The critical pathway involved in the management of BCP of butein is the HIF-1 signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Sphingolipid signaling pathway,\u201d and seven hub targets were identi ed, including EGFR, JUN, VEGFA, TRPV1, PTGS2, AKT1, and ESR1. In conclusion, the ndings provided here may serve as a basis for future pharmacological research into the effects of butein on BCP.\nAbbreviations BCP: Bone\u00a0cancer\u00a0pain\nDEGs: Differentially expressed genes\nCMap: Connectivity map\nKEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome\nGEO: Gene Expression Omnibus\nPPI: Protein Protein interactions\nNSAIDs: Non-steroidal anti-in ammatory drugs\nPage 10/21\nDRG: Dorsal root ganglia\nTCI: Tumor cell injection\nPPI: Protein-protein interaction\nTCMSP: Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform\nPDB: Protein Data Bank\nEGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor\nJUN: Transcription factor AP-1\u00a0\nVEGFA: Vascular endothelial growth factor A,\nTRPV1: Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1\u00a0\nPTGS2: Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2\u00a0\nAKT1: RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase\nESR1: Estrogen receptor 1\nGO: Gene ontology\nBP: Biological process\nDeclarations Acknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the General project of Education Department of Liaoning Province (LJKZ0947, LJKZ0952); and the cultivation Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University (PYJJ2021106).\nFunding\nThe authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors have no relevant nancial or non- nancial interests to disclose\nAuthor Contributions\nPage 11/21\nXin Liu, Yijia Xu, Mingyi Zhao conceived and designed the experiments.
