The Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch scale (PICTS) was developed for this purpose and programming effects of early parental tactile stimulation (stroking) on infant hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis functioning (stress-response system), cardiovascular regulation and behavioral outcomes, similar to that reported in animals, have now been demonstrated. In order to inform future studies examining such programming effects in India, we\u00a0first aimed to describe and examine, using parametric and non-parametric item-response methods, the item-response frequencies and characteristics of responses on the PICTS, and evidence for cross-cultural differential item functioning (DIF) in the United\u00a0Kingdom (UK) and India. Second, in the context of a cultural favoring of male children in India, we\u00a0also aimed to test the association between the sex of the infant and infant \u201cstroking\u201d in both cultural settings. The PICTS was administered at 8\u201312 weeks postpartum to mothers in two-cohort studies: The Wirral Child Health and Development Study, United\u00a0Kingdom (n = 874) and the Bangalore Child Health and Development Study, India (n = 395). Mokken scale analysis, parametric itemresponse analysis, and structural equation modeling for categorical items were used. Items for two dimensions, one for stroking behavior and one for holding behavior, could be\u00a0 identified as meeting many of the criteria required for Mokken scales in the United\u00a0Kingdom, only the stroking scale met these criteria in the sample from India.

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Caregiving is an essential feature of mammalian development, not just for ensuring survival via the provision of infant nutrition, but for promotion of their physiological, cognitive, and socialemotional development. Caregiving broadly includes feeding, caring for physical health, providing sensory and intellectual stimulation, ensuring safety, providing emotional warmth and affection, comfort when distressed, and responding to the infants needs and communications in a timely fashion. Studies of early parental caretaking behavior in humans have typically focused on complex and often multidimensional observational indices of the quality of interaction between parent and infant during caregiving, like \u201cmaternal sensitivity\u201d (Tryphonopoulos et\u00a0al., 2014), or they require parents to report their beliefs about parenting practices and behaviors (Winstanley and Gattis, 2013). Alternatively, more limited specific domains of caretaking such as feeding (Hughes et\u00a0 al., 2005, 2012; Thompson et\u00a0al., 2009), sleeping, or soothing (Morrell and Cortina-Borja, 2002) are the focus. Quantitative study of the role of touch as part of caregiving for the development of human infants has been much more limited, and cross-cultural comparison of these behaviors even rarer despite research suggesting that practices may differ considerably.\nThe work in this paper was conducted as part of a larger cross-cultural study designed to identify shared and distinctive risks and protective factors (including parenting behavior) for child mental health and cognitive development in the United\u00a0Kingdom and India, comparing findings from two-cohort studies. A key first step was therefore to assess parenting behaviors in a standardized manner and formally test the psychometric characteristics of the scale used in both cultural settings [the Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch Scale (PICTS); Koukounari et\u00a0al., 2015, this journal]. The main body of this paper addresses two aims. We\u00a0first examine the measurement invariance of the PICTS between the United\u00a0 Kingdom and India. We\u00a0 next examine associations between responses on the PICTS and demographic characteristics of the child and parent, for subscales where measurement invariance was demonstrated across settings. In particular, in the light of cultural favoring of male compared to female children in India, we\u00a0 examine whether a difference in parental investment is identifiable in infancy.\nWe begin by summarizing previous research in animals and humans that provides evidence for the developmental importance of early touch-based caregiving. This research motivated the original development of the PICTS parent-report questionnaire. We\u00a0 next examine the evidence for potential cross-cultural differences in touch-based parenting and outline the rationale for a gender-based comparison in the current study.\nIn animals, work on rodents has long recognized the function of licking and grooming behavior by mothers to their pups in stimulating digestion. However, there is now overwhelming evidence for the broader importance of touch in rodents, arising from the detailed understanding of the epigenetic mechanism that links maternal licking and grooming behavior (Meaney and Szyf, 2005), or even just mechanical tactile stimulation with a brush (Imanaka et\u00a0al., 2008), to hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis programming and its consequent long-term impact on anxiety-related behavior (Meaney and Szyf, 2005).\nIn humans, touch-based caregiving has largely focused on the effects of early skin-to-skin contact. In premature babies, early skin-to-skin contact is thought to be\u00a0 important because it has been found to promote optimal physiological outcomes (e.g., growth, autonomic functioning, and organized sleep) and to stimulate digestion (Bergman et\u00a0 al., 2004; Chhugani and Sarkar, 2014; Feldman et\u00a0 al., 2014; Chi Luong et\u00a0 al., 2016). It has also been shown to facilitate more responsive and synchronous mother-child interaction (Bigelow et\u00a0 al., 2010; Feldman et\u00a0 al., 2014; Vittner et\u00a0 al., 2018) and to support emotional development (e.g., efficient emotion regulation and reduced infant stress-response), and later cognitive abilities such as sustained attention and control (Feldman et\u00a0 al., 2002, 2014; Gonya et\u00a0 al., 2017). However, a recent Cochrane review of the use of skin-to-skin contact in healthy newborn infants supported its use to promote breastfeeding but concluded that the evidence for benefits to healthy infants in terms of greater stability of the cardio-respiratory system and higher blood glucose levels was based on only a few heterogeneous studies with small samples (Moore et\u00a0 al., 2016) making the clinical significance of the findings hard to determine at that time. However, a few studies have also examined the role of early tactile stimulation (indexed by parental stroking of the infant) in HPA-axis programming and find some parallels with the stress-response pattern seen in rodents (Sharp et\u00a0 al., 2012; Pickles et\u00a0 al., 2017) and comparability of the underlying epigenetics, including observed alterations in methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Murgatroyd et\u00a0 al., 2015). Specifically, early parental stroking moderated the impact of prenatal risk on early infant temperament and physiological response to social stress at 7 months of age and later emotional and behavioral development in the preschool period (Sharp et\u00a0 al., 2012; Pickles et\u00a0 al., 2017). There can therefore be\u00a0 little doubt that touch is an important sensory exposure that may shape both animal and human development.\nDifferences between cultures in caregiving behavior have long been noted, though their quantified comparison using uniform standardized methodology has been much more limited.\nbut no sex differences in rates in either country and no differential sex difference by culture. We\u00a0conclude that PICTS items can be\u00a0used reliably in both countries to conduct further research on the role of early tactile stimulation in shaping important child development outcomes.\nKeywords: stroking, tactile stimulation, early maternal caregiving, gender, psychometric assessment, infant development\nHodsoll et al. Parametric Analysis of Differential Item Functioning\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852618\nA number of studies have examined early maternal sensitivity (i.e., contingent and appropriate responses to children\u2019s cues) across cultures and there is some debate regarding the reliable application of the observation systems devised in western settings and their application to non-western settings (Keller et\u00a0 al., 2018; Mesman, 2018; Mesman et\u00a0 al., 2018). Keller et\u00a0 al. (2018) argue against the universality of maternal sensitivity and claim that the main components of sensitive responsiveness (i.e., the child taking the lead, the child\u2019s point of view as primary, and the turn-taking structure of interactions) reflect a Westernized way of conceptualizing caregiving. Whereas, those who support the universality of maternal sensitivity assert that while its centrality and its manifestations can vary across cultures (i.e., caregivers might use different behaviors to respond to their children, such as vocal and tactile actions, repositioning of the infant, and following of child\u2019s gaze), sensitive responses can be\u00a0 found in every culture (Mesman, 2018; Mesman et\u00a0al., 2018). This work highlights the importance of considering the validity of measuring different aspects of caregiving within different cultural settings and of determining their consequences for infant development in that setting. It highlights the possibility that different caregiving behaviors may be\u00a0observed which serve a similar developmental function across cultures, and vice versa. Furthermore, behaviors may be\u00a0 observed but at different frequencies reflecting differences in cultural expression, with differing long-term consequences for development.\nPrevious work has shown that caregiving arrangements in traditional societies often prioritize body contact (Richman et\u00a0 al., 1992), whereas face-to-face exchange and object play have been observed to be\u00a0 less pronounced (Greenfield and Suzuki, 1998). Cross-cultural observational studies have shown that when non-western mothers interact with their infants, they use more so called \u201cproximal behaviors\u201d: they might touch or stimulate the infant with hands (e.g., fondling or patting) or the face (e.g., kissing) or by body contact as opposed to \u201cdistal behaviors\u201d (e.g., talking, looking, and smiling; K\u00e4rtner et\u00a0 al., 2008). In many non-western cultures, including India, cultural practices often include the provision of body stimulation in the form of a daily massage to the new born infant (Chaturvedi et\u00a0 al., 2020). Such practices are likely to have evolved within cultures and been passed through generations as they are believed to be\u00a0 associated with more favorable developmental outcomes for the infant. Traditional systems of medicine in India advocate the use of daily massage with oil as an integral part of infant care. Massage typically involves stroking of the infant\u2019s legs, feet, back, abdomen, and head with oil. However, the few studies in India evaluating outcomes following touchbased interventions conducted to date have all been very small scale. The majority has reported increased weight gain in those infants massaged daily for a short period of weeks compared to controls. This has been observed in premature infants (Agarwal et\u00a0 al., 2000; Mathai et\u00a0 al., 2001; Arora et\u00a0 al., 2005; Sankaranarayanan et\u00a0 al., 2005) and healthy babies born at term (Sankaranarayanan et\u00a0al., 2005), with one study reporting improved neurobehavioral outcomes also (Mathai et\u00a0 al., 2001). All these studies taught the massage technique to mothers to\ndeliver as part of the study procedure and none assessed frequency of naturally occurring infant stroking between mother and infant.\nThe naturally occurring practice of early tactile stimulation suggests that touch is culturally valued and that a first step in understanding the impact of infants\u2019 early exposure to touchbased caregiving would be\u00a0 to assess variations in exposure within the context of familial caregiving. To do this, one must be\u00a0 able to quantify variations in a standardized manner, such as frequency of occurrence, for different infants. First, in the context of their primary caregiver relationship, and then only later in relation to the broader caregiving system. In this paper, we\u00a0 describe the pattern of responses on the Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch Scale (Koukounari et\u00a0al., 2015) in two cultures, the United\u00a0 Kingdom and India. While some aspects of early caregiving touch may occur at similar frequencies across these two different cultures, others may not. For instance, in India traditional, caregiving almost universally favors the deliberate use of early infant massage with oils in contrast to the United\u00a0 Kingdom where cultural beliefs do not emphasize the primary importance of this form of early touch. The study will yield important information about the natural occurrence of a range of touch-based parenting behaviors, including stroking, which may have particular importance for later infant outcomes.\nAs well as the study of cultural variations in caregiving touch behaviors, the study of gender-specific touch is of interest from a variety of perspectives. In South Asian populations, male children are strongly favored over females, and this preference may be\u00a0relevant both to the mothers\u2019 own childhood experiences of being parented and to their subsequent attitudes and behavior toward their own infant. Particularly in the age group\u00a01\u20134 years, India has the most anomalous levels of excess female mortality in the world (Kashyap, 2019). However, in a context of formally declared gender-neutral policies and legislation, the reporting or display of gender-based differences in research may be\u00a0suppressed on higher level self-report indices of caring, where norms of social desirability are common. The study of differences in touch behavior, that is arguably less subject to social-desirability norms, may expose such otherwise hidden gender differences. In the current study, we\u00a0hypothesized that male infants would receive higher levels tactile stimulation compared to female infants in India, but that this would not hold true for the United\u00a0Kingdom. Another reason for examining the role of gender in this study stems from our previous work on mothers and babies in the United\u00a0 Kingdom which suggests that, as in other mammals, touch-based programming of the HPA-axis may have gender-specific effects with stronger effects in females (Sharp et\u00a0 al., 2015). This study used the PICTS to assess parental stroking of the infant at 9 weeks of age.\nIn a previous paper, we\u00a0 reported on the factor structure and longitudinal invariance of the Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch Scale (PICTS) in the United\u00a0 Kingdom Wirral Child Health and Development Study (WCHADS) of women and their children, recruited in pregnancy (Koukounari et\u00a0al., 2015). In this paper, we\u00a0 further examine the properties of this same instrument in WCHADS and the Bangalore/Bengaluru Child Health and Development Study (BCHADS), a parallel study\nHodsoll et al. Parametric Analysis of Differential Item Functioning\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852618\nof Indian mothers and infants. We\u00a0describe and examine using parametric and non-parametric item-response methods, the item-response frequencies and characteristics, and evidence for cross- cultural differential item functioning (DIF). Examining DIF allows us to answer the question of whether reported differences in parental behaviors can be\u00a0 attributed to true differences in behavior rather than cultural differences in the psychometric properties of the items. Finally, we\u00a0 describe and test the association with a number of characteristics of mothers and children, examining in particular differences between male and female infants in the United\u00a0 Kingdom and India in the receipt of stroking, the touching behavior we\u00a0believe to be\u00a0most relevant to HPA-axis programming."

The Indian cohort was recruited in three Primary Health Care centers delivering maternity care in Bangalore (Banashankari, Siddhaiah road hospital and N.R. Colony hospital). All pregnant women aged 18 years and above in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, were approached over a 20-month period. 84 women were excluded from postnatal follow-up as the pregnancy was high risk or the baby did not survive. A total of 825 women remained eligible for postnatal follow-up. Of these 825 women, 395 mothers completed the PICTS scale at 8 weeks of age and represent the sample for the current report. In pregnancy, 83.7% mothers were homemakers, only a quarter had completed secondary level of education or higher, and the average family income was Rs. 10,000 (~\u00a3105 per month). This is comparable to similar urban settings in India (Indian Census Bureau, 2011).\nThe Wirral Child Health And Development Study (WCHADS) is a United\u00a0 Kingdom cohort comprising of first-time mothers aged 18 years and above and their partners, who were approached and recruited at a local ante natal clinic, the sole public provider on the Wirral peninsula, during 2007 and 2008. A total of 1,233 women had a live singleton baby and were eligible for postnatal follow-up. From these 1233 women, 874 mothers completed the PICTS scale at 9 weeks of age (during 2015 and 2016) and represent the sample for the current report (see Koukounari et\u00a0al., 2015 for more details). Although generally typical of the United\u00a0Kingdom population, the Wirral population under-represents the ethnic diversity of the United\u00a0 Kingdom as a whole.\nBaseline sociodemographic data for the cohort participants included in the analyses of this paper are reported in Table\u00a0 1."

            "text": "The Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch scale (PICTS) is a 12-item parent-report scale designed to assess common caregiving behavior for parents of young infants. Four items assess tactile stimulation in the form of stroking. These ask how often the mother strokes her baby\u2019s back, head, tummy, arms, and legs. Remaining items reflect various other forms of touch or communication. Mothers responded to all items on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 with labels: never, rarely, sometimes, often, and a lot. Using factor analysis on the United\u00a0 Kingdom sample used here, Koukounari et\u00a0 al. (2015) showed the psychometric structure of the 12 items mapped on to three domains of maternal behavior (four items each): stroking (stroke back, head, tummy, arms, and legs), holding (hold, cuddle, pick up, and rock), and affective communication (kissed, talked to, watched, and left baby to lie down), which showed adequate model fit. Internal reliability was good with the polychoric ordinal alpha over 0.87 and 0.89 for infants at 5 and 9 weeks, respectively.\nThe scale was administered at around 8\u201312 weeks of age in the Indian cohort and data from the 9\u201312 weeks assessment in the United\u00a0Kingdom sample was used. In the United\u00a0Kingdom sample, women completed the scale as a self-report postal questionnaire, whereas in India, due to low levels of literacy, the scale was administered orally by a researcher in a faceto-face visit at the home. In both countries, women completed this scale as part of a larger set of study measures at this time point. The PICTS scale items and the abbreviation used to refer to each item in this paper are given in Table\u00a0 2.\nThe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-report scale designed to assess perinatal depressive symptomatology (Cox et\u00a0 al., 1987) and it was administered contemporaneously with PICTS. Mothers answered each item indicating how they have felt during the previous week on a set of four answers that were subsequently coded by researchers\nTABLE\u00a01 | Demographic characteristics for those with a PICTS assessment in United\u00a0Kingdom and India.\nIndia (BCHADS) UK (WCHADS)\nMaternal Age mean (SD) [n] 23.0 years (3.36) [393] 28.2 years (5.69) [873] Child\u2019s Age mean (SD) [n] 10.8 weeks (3.7) [393] 9.0 weeks (2.8) [872] Female % [n] 48.1% [395] 50.6% [874] First born % (r/n) 43.3% [393] 100.0% [874] Marital Status [n] [393] [857] Married % 100.0% 47.6% Cohabiting % 0.0% 34.4% Single/Other % 0.0% 18.0% EPDS total score (SD) [n] 1.49 (3.92) [391] 5.82 (4.64) [856] Religion Hindu v Muslim % [n] 85.0% [390] NA Family Type Nuclear v Joint/ Extended % [n] 44.0% [392] NA Education % [n] above secondary\u00a0- India (age 13 or 14) [n] 27.5% [393] NA\nabove secondary \u2013 United\u00a0Kingdom (age 18) [n]\nNA 64.9% [857]\nHodsoll et al.

            "text": "We divided the analysis into three steps. In the first two steps, we\u00a0 compared the measurement properties of PICTS in the two cohorts before, in the third step, modeling differences in the caregiving behavior of the two cohorts. We\u00a0 used Mokken Scale Analysis (Mokken, 1971; Stochl et\u00a0 al., 2012), a form of non-parametric item response theory (IRT),\u201d to investigate the formal measurement properties and structure of the PICTS in the United\u00a0 Kingdom and Indian cohorts. This included the use of kernel smoothed IRT (Mazza et\u00a0 al., 2012) and automated item selection procedure (AISP). The advantage of non-parametric over parametric IRT is that it gives an easily interpretable assessment of item covariance while making few assumptions about the data structure (Meijer and Baneke, 2004). Since we\u00a0 wanted to compare caring behavior across cohorts and gender (within cohorts), we\u00a0 then assessed differential item functioning (DIF). Here, we\u00a0apply the MIIO test (Manifest Invariant Item Ordering, Ligtvoet et\u00a0 al., 2010) and report the HT coefficient that evaluates the accuracy by which the respondents order the set of items (Ligtvoet et\u00a0 al., 2010). Although the monotone homogeneity (MH) model is sufficient for assessing the psychometric structure of the PICT scale, IIO means the order of items is the same across all values of latent trait, which would argue against DIF. We\u00a0 assessed the reliability of the dimensions using Mokken Scale Rho (Sijtsma and Molenaar, 1987). We\u00a0 applied parametric IRT models to test for gender differences as this provided formal methods to statistically test DIF. Finally, we\u00a0applied latent regression to determine whether caregiving behavior differed across gender,\nwhether associations with gender differed across country and conducted similar tests for the demographic variables and concurrent postnatal depression in Table\u00a0 1."

The 4-item affective communication dimension fell below the 0.3 criterion. However, it formed a weak to moderate scale (H = 0.38) if the \u201cleave\u201d item was removed. Using the automated item selection procedure\u2014AISP (Mokken, 1971) on all 12 items (equivalent to exploratory factor analysis but identifying subsets of items forming Mokken scales rather than factors), identified 2 strong scales, the first consisting of the stroking items and a second of the holding items with the addition of \u201ckiss\u201d (cf. Table\u00a02). For the rest of this analysis of the United\u00a0Kingdom cohort, we\u00a0only considered these two subscales.\nThere were no statistically significant deviations from monotonicity for these two subscales. Further, the tests of local independence showed no violations. Neither the stroking nor holding dimensions showed significant violations of the invariant item ordering test. However, the HT statistic, for which larger values indicate less likelihood of DIF, showed little support for invariant item ordering for the stroking scale (HT = 0.17)\nTABLE\u00a02 | The Parent-Infant Caregiving Touch Scale (PICTS).\nHow often do you\u00a0find yourself doing each of the following things with your baby?

Reliability was high for both dimensions (Mokken Scale Rho for stroking = 0.83 and holding = 0.85).\nIn BCHADS, the same analyses indicated strong scalability for the stroking dimension (H = 0.65), strong scale local independence, no violations of monotonicity, and strong support for IIO (HT = 0.63). However, the holding and affective communication dimensions showed only a very weak scalability (holding H = 0.23, affective communication H was slightly negative). Applying AISP identified multiple dimensions at the different lower bounds of H. When requiring H > 0.3 for all scales, four dimensions were selected with one 5-item dimension (the four stroking items with the addition of \u201cpick up\u201d) and three 2-item scales. Requiring H > 0.5, three dimensions were identified; one four item scale (stroking), two items from the holding dimension (hold and cuddle), and two items from affective communication dimension (kiss and watch). None of the other items formed a Mokken scale. For the two item scales, the affective communication dimension showed no violations of monotonicity nor local independence. The holding dimension, while passing the local independence test, showed a significant violation of monotonicity, where the probability of rating the \u201chold\u201d item in the highest categories decreased with increasing score for the rest of the items (whereas they should increase together).\nIn summary, the Mokken scale analysis indicated the scale has a different structure across cohorts with only the stroking dimension identified in both cohorts. The holding and affective communication items did not form respective scales for the India cohort (the \u201cleave\u201d item did not scale in either of the cohorts). Given this non-compatibility of scale structure, for the crosscultural comparison, we\u00a0 focus on the stroking dimension alone.\nDifferential Item Functioning of the Stroking Scale by Country Comparing scalability coefficients between cohorts, items were roughly similar with large overlap between 95% CI. The exception was the face item (cf. Table\u00a0 3) which showed no overlap. There was stronger scaling for the face item in India (i.e., fewer Guttman errors) than in the UK. The proportion of responses per category tended to differ between the two cohorts but were similar for the \u201climbs\u201d item for all but the probability of responding with category 5 (A lot).\nFigure\u00a0 2 compares the expected item scores as a function of expected total score. Respondents in India reported less back stroking than mothers in the United\u00a0 Kingdom and the absence of face stroking among low strokers in India is evident. The \u201climbs\u201d item performed the most similar across countries and was thus used as the anchor item for the parametric DIF analysis below."

Expected item scores are presented as a function of expected total scores illustrating two issues: (A) monotonicity (the likelihood of items being endorsed with increases in the latent propensity of stroking behavior) and (B) whether the latent propensity to stroke shows the same pattern of item response in the different countries. The percentage scale indicates the cumulative proportion of the sample that have the corresponding total scores and the points represent groups of participants (grouped by ordinal ability). The IRFs are compared in each country, with Indian IRFs in green and the United\u00a0Kingdom in amber.\nFixing the slopes and intercepts of the remaining three items across groups worsened fit in all three cases (Tummy: \u03c72 = 69.9, p < 0.001, Back: \u03c72 = 111.4, p < 0.001, Face: \u03c72 = 179.3, p < 0.001). Item DIF was present for all three items. To investigate further, we\u00a0 next tested model fit for the slope of items. While there was no difference for tummy (\u03c72 = 1.8, p = 0.357) or back (\u03c72 = 1.4, p = 0.357) there was for face (\u03c72 = 46.4, p < 0.001). In the next step, the face item was allowed to vary between groups and the intercepts for the remaining two items were sequentially fixed. Constraining the intercepts of both items to be\u00a0 the same resulted in poorer model fit (Tummy: \u03c72 = 72.1, p < 0.001, Back: \u03c72 = 112.7, p < 0.001).\nHaving established that only partial metric invariance could be\u00a0assumed, we\u00a0tested the structural parameters for invariance. Constraining the factor variance to be\u00a0 1\u00a0 in both groups made no difference to model fit (\u03c72 = 0.03, p = 0.860). Respondents in India showed no difference in variability in stroking behavior relative to the United\u00a0 Kingdom, but the factor mean was different between groups (\u03c72 = 95.7 p < 0.001) with the Indian\ncohort reporting lower stroking behavior than the United\u00a0 Kingdom (\u03b2 = \u22120.66; 95% CI, \u22120.79, \u22120.52).\nFinally, we\u00a0 examined differential test functioning using the partial metric invariance model. Though the expected score for the back item was greater for India than the United\u00a0Kingdom (p = 0.027), the difference was relatively small, equating to an overall points difference of 0.14. Table\u00a04 shows the comparison of scalability coefficients and partial metric IRT model parameters for the United\u00a0 Kingdom and India.\nDifferential Item Functioning by Gender For the UK, the scalability coefficients showed little difference for males and female infants, indicating similar discrimination of stroking items by gender (cf.

Parametric Analysis of Differential Item Functioning\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 852618\nconstructs, we\u00a0 must first show that the measuring instrument being used performs equivalently in those cultures. While this may be\u00a0obvious, in comparisons with parenting it is also rarely highlighted as requiring serious methodological investigation (e.g., Lansford, 2021). It is all too easy to assume not only that the familiar constructs from the considerable literature on parenting in developed western societies are universal, but that these constructs are both understood and made evident in behavior in the same way. This study examined a measure of largely non-verbal parental caregiving, the PICTS, and found that while items for two dimensions, one for stroking behavior and one for holding behavior, could be\u00a0 identified as meeting many of the criteria required for Mokken scales in the United\u00a0 Kingdom, only the stroking scale met these criteria in the sample from India. Thus, while a comparison between the two cultures is possible for the stroking construct, comparisons for the other non-verbal parenting constructs was not possible. Similar measurement invariance concerns also need to be\u00a0 addressed before comparing the parenting of male and female children within each culture. Here, we\u00a0found no evidence of differences in the ways in which any of the constructs were measured for male and female infants.\nMuch of the literature on parenting in western societies has focused on meeting the supposed needs of the child for healthy physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development. In practice, the parenting of children must also fit into the other social roles that are expected of parents (Costigan et\u00a0 al., 2003). The constraints that these can impose are perhaps no more evident than in the simple proximity that is allowed and considered acceptable, from the 90% of time spent in skin-to-skin contact of some hunter-gatherers (Diamond, 2012) to its unacceptability even for feeding in many western work and public spaces (Adesoye et\u00a0 al., 2017). Although differences in understanding of the needs of infants may contribute, it is perhaps as much in the detailed cultural variations in social roles of mothers and how parenting can be\u00a0 fitted within the demands of these other roles that explains how the specific behaviors of the PICTS questionnaire items do not coalesce into constructs common across cultures. The exception is the stroking construct which perhaps stands out as being, at least superficially, inessential. We\u00a0might speculate that instead, stroking is carried out spontaneously and naturally as a method of soothing or conveying affection across cultures, or as part of\na more deliberate infant-focused ritual when the demands from other roles are set aside.\nFocusing on the stroking scale for which direct cross-cultural comparison seemed justified, the final analyses examined the different levels of the scales between cultures, genders, and culture-by-gender; this last being potentially indicative of increased parental investment in boy infants compared to girls that might be\u00a0 expected in India. Our findings were very clear, with higher rates of early stroking being reported for the United\u00a0 Kingdom than India, but no sex differences in rates in either country and no differential gender difference by culture. This is consistent with recent findings of a decline in intra-household sex discrimination found for the under-5 mortality of opposite-sex twins in southern India (Kashyap and Behrman, 2020).\nThe findings suggest that an examination of the role of stroking behaviors in early maternal caregiving and their developmental consequences in India is likely to be\u00a0methodologically sound using the PICTS measure. Previous research by our group has reported moderation of prenatal stress effects by tactile stimulation (assessed using the PICTS) in the first few weeks of life, on infant negative emotionality and heart rate variability to a social stressor at 7 months of age and on later emotional and behavioral development in the preschool period (Sharp et\u00a0 al., 2012; Pickles et\u00a0 al., 2017) in the United\u00a0 Kingdom and to underlying methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Murgatroyd et\u00a0 al., 2015). That this measure of physical parenting, while showing clear individual differences, and varying with the infant\u2019s age, does not appear to be\u00a0influenced by maternal age, social or religious background, or contemporaneous depressive symptoms of the mother, strengthens the case for these findings not being due to confounder bias. The findings within this methodological paper enable us to confidently move on to examine whether similar protective effects of stroking in early life are evident in India in the same way as the United\u00a0 Kingdom. This work on the performance of the PICTS scale can also be\u00a0 used as a model to guide the future approach to assessment of non-verbal caregiving practices in other cultural settings."

            "text": "The studies, while large for this field of research, may not be\u00a0 sufficient to provide definitive answers, and particularly in relation to the absence of sex differences, require replication. The analytic approach used in this two-cohort study is thorough and exposed multiple differences in the measurement properties of the PICTS between the two countries. These differences cannot be\u00a0 unequivocally attributed to differences in parenting and response culture, since the mode of assessment, text presentation in the United\u00a0 Kingdom vs. verbal presentation in India, may account for some differences with face-to-face responding arguably being more vulnerable to response bias. It is also possible that, though both cohorts were general populations recruited in pregnancy, differences in sampling frames (first born in the United\u00a0 Kingdom, all births in India) and differential attrition may have contributed to some differences.\nFIGURE\u00a03 | Testing structural differences in maternal stroking behavior by country and gender (males and United\u00a0Kingdom taken as reference category for dummy variables).\nHodsoll et al.

Thus, our conclusion concerning no difference between the United\u00a0Kingdom and India in sex-based differences is likely robust."

            "text": "We are mindful of the fact that future work should extend the examination of naturally occurring stroking behaviors by primary caregivers to include that reported by other key caregivers in order to represent the overall exposure that infants receive. For instance, in India, shared caregiving especially for infants is the cultural norm with many key figures such as grandmothers or aunties contributing significantly to early infant care. This may potentially explain why the comparison of frequency of stroking between United\u00a0 Kingdom and India showed lower levels of stroking behavior overall from mothers in India. In order to characterize the levels of tactile stimulation received by Indian infants, one should ideally gather data from other primary caregivers in addition to mothers in a shared-caregiving context.\nFinally, to further characterize the level of tactile stimulation received by infants in United\u00a0Kingdom and India, future studies should record whether or not the infant has received early skinto-skin contact or infant massage as part of an early intervention or caregiving practice locally. We\u00a0 are aware that baby massage groups have become a relatively common feature of perinatal support within the United\u00a0Kingdom (Asmussen and Brim, 2018) and it is also common practice in India for daily massage with oils to be\u00a0 given for the first 40 days of life by grandmothers or local paid birth attendants (Dai; Chaturvedi et\u00a0 al., 2020). A recent large-scale study in two states (Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh) in India reported infant massage practice to be\u00a0 the norm rather than the exception with 93.8% of mothers reporting its practice. It should be\u00a0 noted, however, that in line with the findings of our study, mothers reported that the practice was equivalent for female and male babies (Chaturvedi et\u00a0 al., 2020). Although in our Indian sample frequency of stroking did not differ by infant sex or parity of the mother, future research should investigate whether a more complex relationship between caregiving practices and infant sex may exist. Gender-based caregiving may be\u00a0 dependent on a third contextual factor, the number of existing male and female children in the family."

            "text": "Before cross-cultural differences in parenting and developmental processes can be\u00a0 claimed, evidence should first be\u00a0 presented that the assessment tools perform in the same way in both cultures. We\u00a0 have examined the role of touch in the parenting of infants in two culturally distinct settings using PICTS, a parent-report questionnaire developed for use in the United\u00a0Kingdom. We\u00a0showed that the instrument did not have the same psychometric properties in the two countries, with only some subscales being replicated and only partial invariance\nwithin replicated subscales. The infant stroking subscale, previously identified as important for HPA-axis programming in the United\u00a0 Kingdom sample, showed sufficient invariance to allow a valid cross-cultural comparison. While rates of stroking were lower in India than the United\u00a0 Kingdom, there was no evidence of the expected higher rates of stroking of male infants in the Indian cohort with no sex differences being evident in either country. We\u00a0 are yet to examine whether the role of stroking in HPA-axis programming is common across the two cultures. More rigorous evidence is also required before we\u00a0 can recommend the use of clinical interventions, such as the promotion of baby massage, that might play a meaningful role in child development. Future research also needs to better substantiate the measurement equivalence of other aspects of parenting, both touch-based and more generally, to compliment the assessment of stroking behavior."
