            "text": "A growing area within the medical literature focuses on clinical prediction and decision tools that use variables from patient history, examination, or diagnostic tests to generate outcomebased risk stratification and/or intervention recommendations [1\u20133]. These tools often take the form of a simple clinical score that can be easily calculated by a bedside clinician; this is thought to provide actionable information and clinical decision support that will lead to higher quality of care through improved efficiency, greater adherence to guidelines, and standardization of care. Medical calculators that operationalize these tools in a rapid and easily accessed interface are prevalent [4, 5]. Grading criteria for these types of tools have been proposed but are not in common use [6, 7]. Thus, demonstration of appropriate use and clinical validity remains a need, particularly for the calculator tools that present recommended next therapeutic or management steps.\nThe decision to admit a patient to the hospital is a complicated, multifaceted phenomenon informed by contextual details related to the patient, physician, healthcare system, and overall social support availability [8\u201311]. In one study, nearly half of admissions from an emergency department were \u201cstrongly or moderately\u201d influenced by one or more non-medical factors [12]. Thus, it is imperative to understand not only how clinical prediction and decision tools are employed in these types of encounters but also whether they are appropriately representative to be applied to a particular environment and situation. Here we catalogue the foundational evidence for tools that advise the decision to admit a patient to the hospital and aim to 1) identify the specific clinical scenarios and outcomes studied, 2) assess adherence to methodologic standards, and 3) determine applicability to diverse patient populations."

Study methods were summarized and the country/ies in which the study was performed were captured. In addition, basic descriptors such as the clinical scenario studied, outcome measured, and study setting (e.g., Emergency Department, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic) were captured.\nTo address the second task of evaluating the methodologic basis of underlying literature, a\nstandardized framework was applied. Previous analysis of and methodologic standards for clinical prediction rules have been described, first by Wasson et al in 1985 [17] and subsequently expanded by Laupacis et al in 1997 [2]. Recent literature has also championed similar approaches [18, 19]. We used the Wasson-Laupacis framework in order to systematically and rigorously describe the standards met by medical calculators included in our study. Elements were sought within the primary reference study independently by each author and then reconciled for any differences. A listing of the methodologic standards evaluated is provided below.\nTo address the third task of assessing applicability in broader contexts, we sought to identify\nwhat descriptive details were included in each primary reference study that would allow for other investigators to replicate the study and/or for users of the risk calculator tool to assess appropriateness for application in their clinical work. The presence of details regarding patient population (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, functional status, medical comorbidities, mental or behavioral health comorbidities, and substance use) and study setting (including location type, geographic setting, community vs. academic affiliation, size/patient volume, and rural/ suburban/urban setting) was captured. Finally, because negative social determinants of health (SDOH) are associated with poor outcomes after ED discharge [20] and therefore may hold important contextual details regarding appropriateness for admission to the hospital, we\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279294 December 19, 2022 3 / 11\nexamined each primary reference for its description of any SDOH factors. While not necessarily widespread practice, there are continued calls for the integration of social care into the health care system in the literature [21] and so our approach provides a reflection of these calls to action. A position paper published by the American College of Physicians in 2018 [22] provides a listing of SDOH categories and examples in its Appendix Table which we adopted for the details of SDOH domains (economic stability, neighborhood/physical environment, education, food, community and social context, health care system) searched for in each primary study reference. Beyond identifying whether details of patient population, study setting, or SDOH were described in the primary reference study, we also identified if they were incorporated into the corresponding risk calculator tool.\nMethodologic standards evaluated. Each primary reference study was analyzed with\nrespect to methodologic standards in 10 domains: outcome (definition, clinical importance, and blind assessment), predictive variables (identification and definition, blind assessment), important patient characteristics described, study site described, mathematical techniques described, results of the rule described, reproducibility (of predictive variables, of the rule), sensibility (clinically sensible, easy to use, probability of disease described, course of action described), prospective validation, and effects of clinical use prospectively measured. Definitions of these domains have been previously published [2].\nMethodologic standards requiring interpretation\nIn some instances, there were methodologic standards that required some interpretation on the part of the authors to determine whether present or absent. We determined a priori definitions for meeting these standards. For example, we classified that the \u201cimportant patient characteristics described\u201d methodology standard would be met if the primary reference study included any patient information beyond age, sex, or medical comorbidities (as we posited that hospital admission requires a more comprehensive, holistic view of the patient\u2019s health and context). Likewise, in order to meet the requirement for \u201cstudy site described\u201d we required inclusion of any specifics beyond location type (ED, clinic, hospital) and geographic setting (country and/or region). Details of which specific items were included in patient characteristics and study settings was then incorporated into the applicability assessment."

Preexisting medical comorbidities were also commonly referenced (21/22). Additional patient characteristics beyond age, sex, and medical comorbidities were reported in around half of the studies (13/22) though there were significant limitations to what was included. When substance use was described (7/22), it only referenced cigarette smoking and not drug or alcohol use.

Patient race/ethnicity and mental or behavioral health comorbidities were not included. No study setting details were included in the scores. Only one calculator included any SDOH in the score.\nMathematical techniques and results of the rule\nAll reports of statistical techniques used were reasonably described. Most studies (18/22) used some form of multivariate analysis; 16 used logistic regression and two used recursive partitioning. Of the rest, two studies reported only univariate analysis, one study tested a predefined accelerated diagnostic protocol and reported sensitivity/specificity and negative/positive predictive values for protocol components both individually and collectively, and one study reported the rate of adverse events measured prospectively when a protocol explicitly directing outpatient management was implemented clinically. At the individual predictor level, correlation with outcome was reported by odds ratio in ten studies and by beta coefficients in one study. Four studies involved a higher ratio of cases to covariates than the recommended 1:10. In two of the 22 studies it was not possible to tell how many total predictor variables were considered for inclusion.\nIn total, 20/22 studies described the results of the rule in some way. Sensitivity, specificity,\nand/or predictive values were explicitly reported in 15 studies. Receiver operating characteristics and/or c-statistics were used in 15 studies as part of assessment of diagnostic accuracy, comparison between derivation and validation cohorts, and/or comparison with other existing risk scoring models."

            "text": "As clinical risk tools become increasingly common, ensuring their quality as well as appropriate application of their results is of paramount importance, particularly as there is continued interest in embedding clinical scores within the electronic medical record, often in an automated fashion and integrated into clinical decision support mechanisms [24, 25]. We found that calculator tools used to inform hospital admission decisions rarely are built uponevidence studying the intervention of hospitalization itself and that there is wide variation in study design and settings. In addition, we found that research methodologic standards are inconsistently applied in this body of literature and that there are gaps in reporting of study details that make evaluation of applicability to diverse patient populations challenging.\nIn their 2019 perspective on the proliferation of clinical risk tools, Challener, Prokop, and\nAbu-Saleh argued \u201cClinical scoring systems should be evaluated on quality and clinical benefit. The quality of a score depends on the method of its development, the rigor of subsequent validation, and its performance characteristics [7].\u201d Several concerns in these domains arise from our evaluation. First, the presumed benefit of hospitalization in the recommendations was often based on extrapolation from the risk of adverse events or mortality. This practice proves problematic, as described by Schenkel and Wyer: \u201cIt is not evident that because a patient may die that hospitalization will reduce that likelihood, nor is it evident that a patient likely to live will not benefit from hospital care [26].\u201d Furthermore, assessing an outcome while the patient is already admitted as several of the studies did complicates the findings because every participant received the benefit of hospitalization.\nIn addition, comparing outcomes and making disposition recommendations based on the\nseverity of disease process alone\u2014as the risk tools in this report do\u2014removes the impact of the patient\u2019s context and surrounding environment from the risk/benefit assessment. A variety of factors have been associated with increased risk for hospitalization including social, cognitive, and functional deficits [27], even with a low-risk clinical score [28]. Thus, these risk calculators may overemphasize clinical variables while avoiding integration of the types of complex factors that have been shown to drive admission practices [7, 9, 11, 29]. While it can be argued that these tools should remain purely clinically oriented and that physicians and other practitioners are called upon to identify if a tool is applicable to a specific case, the lack of information reported in these studies such as details of patient population, study setting, or social determinants of health makes this challenging in practice.\nFinally, there are significant questions about the real-world utility and potential unintended\nconsequences of these tools as well as if it is even possible to appropriately assess their outcomes. The initial derivation of a risk score understandably may not report prospective validation of the rule or measurement of its effect when implemented in clinical care and additional prospective validation studies are often needed. With tools related to hospitalization decisions, however, this is potentially fraught and should be carefully considered. The landscape of inpatient versus outpatient care is changing with increased in-home care and/or remote monitoring as well as targeted relationships between hospitals and post-acute care facilities to provide alternatives to hospitalization [30\u201332]. Conditions which in previous time periods would have been appropriately managed by hospitalization may now have viable alternative locations of care. Therefore, any hospitalization scoring tool is inherently limited in its generalizability and should only be applied to similar contextual environments. Quite simply, there are significant\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279294 December 19, 2022 8 / 11\nvalidation issues for these calculator tools and any model built to predict need for hospitalization is not likely to provide appropriate guidance for clinicians at-large.\nThis study uses the MDCalc website as a convenience sample and thus is not necessarily\nreflective of the entirety of clinical risk calculators guiding hospitalization decision-making. Also, by specifically evaluating the primary reference for each calculator tool as listed on the website, the findings are subject to any inherent bias in MDCalc\u2019s selection and review process. We chose this approach for consistency across calculator tools and because it pragmatically reflects how many users of the tools access them and are directed to the literature. We did not directly assess clinician behavior in terms of how they identify need for a calculator, access the calculator tool itself, assess the applicability of a calculator to a specific case, and integrate its output into their overall decision-making. These would be important areas of future exploration.\nStrengths of this study include use of a novel, \u201cend-use\u201d search strategy in which we used a\nfunctional, pragmatic approach to search for how clinical risk calculator tools are being used in practice, rather than what they may have been intended to measure. This allows for capture of tools that may otherwise be missed when searching by outcome or clinical disease entity. This is an approach that could be considered for other end-use assessments."

Taken together, our results do not support broad use of these calculators for the purpose of determining need for hospitalization."
