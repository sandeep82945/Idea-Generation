We establish their spectral masses with short extrapolations to the physical point, observing agreement with phenomenological expectations. We find that only the good diquark has attractive quark-quark spatial correlations, with spherical shape and size\u223c 0.6 fm. Our results provide quantitative support for modelling the low-lying baryon spectrum using good light diquark effective degrees of freedom.\nKeywords: Diquarks; exotic hadrons; lattice QCD CERN-TH-2021-223.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.31349/SuplRevMexFis.3.0308082\nDiquarks as a concept have existed for a long time and actually pre-date QCD [1]. In spite of their long history of successes in describing low-lying baryons and exotics, experimental evidence has been difficult to obtain, however. Formally their interpolating operator may be written as\nD\u0393 = qcC\u0393q\u2032, (1)\nwhereq, q\u2032 denote two different quark flavors,c C indicate charge conjugation and\u0393 acts on Dirac space. A list of their possible quantum numbers is given in Table I.\nOne particular prediction for them is that light quarks can take on a special, so-called \u201dgood\u201d,(3\u0304F , 3\u0304c, JP = 0+) diquark configuration, see.g. [2]. In this configuration the two quarks experience a unique attractive effect when compared to other channels. This attraction, and associated formation of a diquark substructure in certain hadrons, could in turn explain the pattern of observed states in the low-lying baryon spectrum. The binding energies of recently predicted doubly-heavy tetraquarks [3-15], for example, could be partially explained by this effect. Furthermore, whether or not diquark substructures are formed within baryons, especially the nucleon, has been subject to long debate.\nEven though diquarks are well founded in QCD, nonperturbative, ab initio input, in particular through lattice sim-\nTABLE I.

The reason is that they are coloured objects, i.e. not gauge-invariant, and the lattice cannot access them directly. In this contribution, based on the work of [16], we address this issue by forming gauge-invariant probes of diquark properties through embedding them in hadrons that contain in addition a single static quark. The mass of this infinitely heavy quark cancels exactly in mass differences. Additionally, this configuration can be used to define a measure for the diquark structure through density-density correlations."

However,\nin this situation masses and sizes become gauge-dependent\nquantities, which hampers their use in applications.\nAn alternative is to embed the diquark in a baryon containing a static,i.e., infinitely heavy quark, Q, leading to the Euclidean-time-dependent correlator:\nC\u0393(t) = \u2211\n~x\n\u2329 [D\u0393Q](~x, t) [D\u0393Q]\u2020(~0, 0) \u232a .

They can be accessed by taking the ratios of two diquark channel correlation functions, e.g. the bad (\u0393 = \u03b3i) and the good (\u0393 = \u03b35), or a diquark and a static-light meson (M\u0393 = [Q\u0304\u0393q]).\nGiven their fully non-perturbative origin and unique values in nature, the mass splittings can be viewed as fundamental characteristics of QCD [2]. Here, we present their calculation at a single lattice spacing. However, we expect discretisation effects only at the percent level given other calculations of the hadron spectrum on the same gauge configurations [18, 31\u201333]. By leveraging the large range of pion masses available to us we perform short, controlled chiral extrapolations to the physical value of the pion massi. The results are summarised in Table II, which show the mass differences calculated in our lattice study compared to their phenomenological counterparts. Overall we observe very good agreement with phenomenological expectations, and confirm the special role of the attractive good diquark configuration."

As before\u0393 characterizes the diquark channel.\nThe quark density-density correlators\nCdd\u0393 (~x1, ~x2, t) = \u2329 B\u0393(~0, 2t)\u03c1(~x1, t)\u03c1(~x2, t)B \u2020 \u0393(~0, 0) \u232a ,\n(4)\nFIGURE 1.

Their geometry is sketched in Fig. 1, where we show a visualisation of the density-density correlators in temporal view a) and in a spatial plane projection b).\nThe static quark is set at the origin, while the lightquark source and sink points are located at(~0, tsrc) and (~0, tsnk). We insert the currents attm = (tsnk + tsrc)/2 with (tsnk \u2212 tsrc) = 16. This maximises the projection onto the ground state in our simulation while keeping the noise manageable. We note that our calculations average over all spatial translations,i.e. spatial positions of the quark sources and sinks. In the spatial view the relative positions of the static source and current insertions~x1, ~x2, can be understood in terms of~rqq\u2032 = ~x2 \u2212 ~x1, ~S = (~x1 + ~x2)/2, i.e. the separation between the static source and diquark midpoint, in addition to the angle\u03c6 between~rqq\u2032 and ~S. With this we define:\n\u03c12(rqq\u2032 , S, \u03c6; \u0393) \u2261 Cdd\u0393 (~x1, ~x2, tm) . (5)\nIn this notation the distance from the static source to the closer of the two insertion points is minimized for\u03c6 = \u03c0 and maximized for\u03c6 = \u03c0/2 for a fixedS andrqq\u2032 . Note that the static quark could potentially disrupt the diquark correlation if they get too close. This disruption will therefore be largest for the angle\u03c6 = \u03c0 and smallest for\u03c6 = \u03c0/2. In our study of\u03c12 we focus on these two limiting cases. In the case of smallest disruption, the distance|~x1| = |~x2| \u2261 R and the angle\u0398 between~x1 and~x2 may be used to characterise the correlations. Introducing a further shorthand we write in the following\u03c1\u22a52 (R, \u03b8) \u2261 \u03c12(rqq\u2032 , S, \u03c0/2) and \u03c1 \u2016 2(rqq\u2032 , S) \u2261 \u03c12(rqq\u2032 , S, \u03c0).\nThe correlator\u03c1\u22a52 (R, \u03b8) is well suited to study possible quark-quark attraction effects. In case of attraction in a given diquark channel we expect an increase in\u03c1\u22a52 (R, \u03b8) with decreasing\u0398 at fixedR. We show the results for all available diquark channels in Fig. 2 (top) at a pion mass of575 MeV. Here the angular variablecos(\u0398) = \u22121 (+1) implies the quarks are opposite (on top) of each other,i.e. \u0398 = 180\u25e6 and0\u25e6. We observe a clear increase exclusively in the good diquark channels\u0393 = \u03b35 and\u03b35\u03b30. In all other channels we observe no indication of any such attraction.\nSupl. Rev. Mex. Fis.3 0308082\nIn Fig. 2b) we study the quark mass dependence of this effect through the ratio between\u0398 = 0\u25e6 and90\u25e6:\n\u03c1\u22a52 (R, \u0398 = 0,\u0393) \u03c1\u22a52 (R, \u0398 = \u03c0/2, \u03b35) . (6)\nFocusing on the good,\u0393 = \u03b35, and bad,\u0393 = \u03b3i, channels, we\nobserve the good channel exhibits a significantly increased\nratio for all masses available while it is small, consistent with\nzero, in the bad channel. These observations establish the\nattractive interaction in the good diquark channel.\nThis picture of the good diquark can be further refined. Notice that the distance between the quarks in the probed diquark can be written asrqq\u2032 = R \u221a 2(1\u2212 cos(\u0398)). As such we can re-interpret our results as\n\u03c1\u22a52 (R, rqq\u2032) \u223c exp(\u2212rqq\u2032/r0) , (7) where we defined the diquark size parameterr0 through the scale of the exponential decay of the spatial correlation between the two quarksq andq\u2032 constituting the diquark with rqq\u2032 . Our results for all availableR andm\u03c0 are shown in Fig. 3a). Note that we do not see evidence for a distortion through the static quark as long asrqq\u2032 < R. With the definition of the diquark size we perform a combined fit to all availableR at a given value ofm\u03c0.\nThe results for 0(m2\u03c0) are displayed in Fig. 3b), whereby we also compare with the results obtained in [20, 21, 30]. Overall we observe very good agreement with these previous\nstudies and significantly extend them. Studying the decay of the spatial correlation between the quark-quark pair with distance we find the diameter of the diquark is\u223c 0.6 fm. A similar value was found in determinations of the size of mesons and baryon using a similar method in Ref. [34]. As such, the good diquark is of hadronic size.\nFinally, we further study the good diquarks by comparing analogue definitions of the diquark sizes separately in the relative radial (r\u20160 , \u03c6 = \u03c0) and tangential (r \u22a5 0 , \u03c6 = \u03c0/2) orientations. This enables an estimation of the shape of the diquark and sheds light on possible polarisation effects through the static quark at the origin.\nIn particular the ratior\u22a50 /r \u2016 0 provides a measure of\nwhether the diquarks are prolate, oblate, or spherical. The results are shown in Fig. 4 and we findr\u22a50 /r \u2016 0(m 2 \u03c0) ' 1 within errors for allm\u03c0. This indicates that the diquarks have a near-spherical shape and that we do not observe polarisation effects due to the presence of the static quark.\nSupl. Rev. Mex. Fis.3 0308082"

            "text": "In this contribution, we presented results on both diquark spectroscopy and diquark structure, using ab initio lattice QCD simulations. By embedding the diquarks in baryons together with a single static quark we formed gaugeinvariant probes of their properties. In particular, we evaluated diquark-diquark and diquark-quark mass differences in which the static spectator quark mass cancels out exactly. Comparing with phenomenological estimates we observe very good agreement for all available mass splittings. The splittings in particular confirm the special status of the good diquark, where we observe a relative mass difference of 198(4) MeV compared to the bad diquark after a short, controlled extrapolation to the physical pion mass point.\nGoing further we studied density-density correlations and found strong indication for quark-quark attraction in the good diquark channel. It should be stressed that this compact spatial correlation was observed only in the good diquark channel, once more providing clear, quantitative support for the good diquark picture. Defining the good diquark diameter through this spatial correlation we find it to roughly have the sizer0 ' O(0, 6) fm. This implies diquarks are similar in size to mesons and baryons [34]. Finally we probed the shape of the good diquark by evaluating the ratio of its tangential and radial sizes. Our results imply an almost spherical shape, with no discernible evidence for polarisation induced by the presence of the static spectator quark.\nFurther details and supporting studies that go beyond the scope of this contribution can found in Ref. [16]. The results shown here were taken from this main reference."
