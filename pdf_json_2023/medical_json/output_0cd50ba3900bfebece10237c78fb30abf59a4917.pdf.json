    "abstractText": "Background Anti\u2212vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) treatment has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Therefore, the use of anti\u2212VEGFs for patients with colorectal cancers (CRC) has raised con\u2010 cerns about the potential risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), an ocular disease caused by embolism or venous stasis. This study aims to evaluate the risk of RVO in patients with CRC treated with anti\u2212VEGFs. Method We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance Database. The study cohort comprised patients newly diagnosed with CRC between 2011 and 2017, who received anti\u2010VEGF treatment. For each patient in the study cohort, a control group comprising four patients newly diagnosed with CRC, but not receiving anti\u2010VEGF treatment, was randomly selected. A washout period of 12 months was imple\u2010 mented to identify new cases. The index date was defined as the date of the first prescription of anti\u2010VEGF drugs. The study outcome was the incidence of RVO, as identified by ICD\u20109\u2010CM (362.35 and 362.36) or ICD\u201010\u2010CM codes (H3481 and H3483). Patients were followed from their index date until the occurrence of RVO, death or the end of the study period. Covariates, including patients\u2019 age at index date, sex, calendar year of CRC diagnosis, stage of CRC and comorbidities related to RVO, were included. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with adjustments for all covariates to compare the risk of RVO between the anti\u2010VEGF and control groups. Results We recruited 6285 patients in the anti\u2010VEGF group and 37,250 patients in the control group, with mean ages of 59.49 \u00b1 12.11 and 63.88 \u00b1 13.17 years, respectively. The incidence rates were 1.06 per 1000 person\u2010years for the anti\u2010 VEGF group, and 0.63 per 1000 person\u2010years for the controls. There was no statistically significant difference in RVO risk between the anti\u2010VEGF and control groups (HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 0.87\u20135.61). Conclusion Our results indicated no association between use of anti\u2010VEGF and occurrence of RVO among CRC patients, although the crude incidence rate of RVO was higher in patients receiving anti\u2010VEGF, compared to control patients. Future study with larger sample size is required to confirm our findings.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease of high prevalence, with an annual incidence over 1.8 million newly diagnosed cases and an annual mortality of almost 700,000 deaths [1]. It is the 3rd most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Although the mortality rate has been decreasing over recent decades, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is still associated with a poor 5-year survival rate. Before the era of targeted therapies, there were only limited therapeutic options for mCRC. Agents were comprised of a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin or irinotecan, and were used either as single agents or in combinations [2].\nBevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, USA) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. In randomized, prospective trials, bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy considerably improved response rates, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with mCRC. Regorafenib (Stivarga\u00ae, Beacon Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Bangladesh) is an oral small-molecule multiple kinase inhibitor. In the EU and USA it is indicated for patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with, or who are not considered candidates for available therapies, including fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, anti-VEGF therapy and, if RAS wild-type, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy. Ramucirumab (Cyramza\u00ae, Eli Lilly, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the VEGF receptor 2. In the phase III RAISE clinical trial, the addition of ramucirumab to FOLFIRI-based chemotherapy resulted in an improvement of OS in patients with mCRC who had been previously treated with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine.\nRVO is an ocular emergency situation with sudden visual loss which includes central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branched retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). CRVO occurs when a thrombus occludes the central retinal vein near the lamina cribosa. BRVO occurs when a thrombus develops at the arteriovenous crossing point secondary to atherosclerosis of the retinal artery, causing compression and occlusion of the retinal vein. Given the mechanisms of anti\u2212VEGF agents, retinal vessel occlusion can be seen as a probable adverse event in these patients. Venous thromboembolism is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with malignancy. In previous meta\u2212analysis study, bevacizumab has been reported to be significantly associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism in cancer patients [3]. Patients treated with bevacizumab had a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism with an RR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.13\u20131.56; P < 0.001),\ncompared with controls. Bevacizumab has been used in the treatment of different cancers for a long time. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) has been reported as an adverse drug effect of bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy for mCRC [4]. Since there have been very few case reports discussing this association, we aimed to use a large population\u2212based cohort design to determine if anti\u2212VEGF treatment in CRC patients is associated with higher risk of RVO."

For this study, we selected patients with new-onset of colorectal cancer from 2011 to 2017, using ICD-O-3 codes (C18-C20). We defined the index date as the first date of anti-VEGF use. To avoid potential immortal time and selection bias [5], a washout period of 12\u00a0months after the cancer diagnosis was imposed in\norder to assess prevalence of use and to create the antiVEGF cohort. We therefore included only patients with a full 12\u00a0months\u2019 data prior to their index date. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) missing date or month of diagnosis; 2) previous retinal vessel occlusion history (including retinal vein occlusion and retinal artery occlusion); 3) previous cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction or stroke, as determined by ICD codes; 4) previous intravitreal use of any anti-VEGF (including ranibizumab or aflibercept); 5) missing data of gender or age; 6) no records of clinical staging of cancer; 7) survival time or follow-up time less than 1\u00a0 year.

We thus had 52,142 patients, diagnosed with colorectal cancers and with definite initial clinical staging data. We restricted patients to those surviving more than one year after colorectal cancer diagnosis and excluded those who were followed up for less than one year (N = 8607). Finally 43,535 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in the study cohort. We then divided these patients into 2 groups for comparison; the anti-VEGF group, receiving anti-VEGF treatment (N = 6285), and the control group, not receiving anti-VEGF treatment (N = 37,250). The index date was defined as the first date of any anti-VEGF use.

The year of diagnosis was very similar for the anti-VEGF and control groups (p = 0.052). However, the antiVEGF group had more advanced initial clinical stages; i.e., more than 70% of the patients in this group were at stage 4, while most of the patients in the control group were below stage 3. According to Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance regulations, only patients with metastatic colon cancer are able to access anti-VEGFs for their disease treatment. Therefore, we assumed all patients in the anti-VEGF group to have stage 4 disease, since they were receiving anti-VEGFs. Furthermore, the mortality rate in the anti-VEGF group was 68.81%, but only 15.79% in the control group. As for comorbidities, the control group had a higher prevalence of previous comorbidities, such as hypertension, pneumonia,\ndiabetes, dyslipidemia, arrhythmia, heart failure, renal diseases and cataract."

We enrolled 6285 mCRC patients in the anti-VEGF group and 37,250 CRC\npatients in the control group without anti-VEGF treatment. We found the risk of RVO was not higher in the anti-VEGF group, compared to the controls. And overall, the risk of RVO was related to greater age and previous history of RVO.\nAngiogenesis, the important process leading to the formation of new blood vessels, is one of the hallmarks of cancer. VEGF is the key angiogenic factor, especially in CRC pathogenesis. Since the advent of molecular targeting therapies for mCRC, the prognosis for patients with CRC has changed dramatically. Of all the molecules identified as leading to blood vessel formation, VEGF-A appears to be the main molecular driver of tumor angiogenesis. VEGF induces the activation of proteins such as urokinase, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and matrix metalloproteinases, and binds toVEGFR1 andVEGFR2, which are predominantly expressed on the cell surface of several anti-apoptotic factors that promote tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Indeed, VEGF-A is overexpressed in the majority of solid tumors and for this reason is the primary target for anti-angiogenic drugs [8]. Four agents are used in anti-angiogenesis therapy for mCRC at present. Bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF-A. Aflibercept (Elyea\u00ae), a recombinant fusion protein, acts like a VEGF-trap, binding the circulating VEGFs, including VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF). Ramucirumab (Cyranza\u00ae) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Regorafenib (Stivarga\u00ae) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets oncogenic, stromal (PDGFR-\u03b2, FGFR) and angiogenic (VEGFR1-3, TIE2) receptor tyrosine kinase. In Taiwan, the medications reimbursed during our study period were bevacizumab and regorafenib, and since May 2021, ramucirumab has also been reimbursed as a third medication for the same indication.

The result from this observational population-based study was similar to that of another real-world study (Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety [BRiTE study]) [11]. A further Japanese study targeting a Japanese population also produced a similar result [12]. In several previous studies, bevacizumab has been reported to induce arterial hypertension, arterial thromboembolic events and gastrointestinal bleeding [13\u201315]. As for regorafenib, hypertension has also been reported as a common adverse event [16, 17]. Previous studies have suggested that VEGFs could cause simultaneous endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production and an upregulation of endothelial NO synthase expression, further leading to vasodilatation. Anti-VEGF agents therefore inhibit the synthesis of NO and contribute to increased vascular tone, vasoconstriction and decreased sodium ion renal excretion, which leads to elevated arterial pressure [18]. The hypercoagulable status of mCRC patients, in addition to anti-VEGF treatment, may cause further microangiopathy, leading to vasoconstriction, hemostasis of retinal vessels and ultimately RVO.\nThe risk factors for RVO in oncological patients remain unclear.

In our study, 0.14 percent of 6285 patients receiving antiVEGF treatment and 0.19 percent of 37,250 controls had adverse outcomes. The absolute risk reduction was 0.04 (95% CI: -0.06%\u20140.15%). The number needed to harm (NNH) was 1635, indicating that the risk of adverse outcomes associated with anti-VEGF treatment was low. Overall, our study provided a more comprehensive and statistically significant assessment of the potential risks associated with anti-VEGF treatment in oncological patients, thus confirming the overall safety of this treatment approach.\nOur study showed that the RVO risk was not different between the anti-VEGF group and the control group. However, we did observe some risk factors. Older groups, more than 70\u00a0years old, were at greater risk of RVO than younger ones, while gender, clinical cancer stage and other previous comorbidities were not associated with risk of RVO. An older population might be at greater risk since aging contributes to a greater number of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and risk factors for RVO. When considering the development of RVO, vessel atherosclerotic changes, oxidative stress and inflammation caused by aging are plausible and logical factors. According to our result, the most important risk factor for RVO is a history of RVO (Table\u00a0 3). Possible mechanisms for recurrent RVO vary, though most are related to systemic hypertension, diabetes or atherosclerosis. However, some cases may be related to a hyper-coagulation status of retinal vessels. Hern\u00e1ndez, J. L. et\u00a0al. [23] reported cases of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and RVO, and they suggest that RVO could represent an organ-specific manifestation of APS. The mCRC patients with RVO histories might have hypercoagulable vessel instabilities. After anti-VEGF treatment, the inhibition of VEGF, leading to thrombosis or vasoconstriction of retinal vessels, would lead to recurrent RVO."

            "text": "This study is the first large cohort study to investigate associations between systemic anti-VEGFs, including bevacizumab and regorafenib, and ocular adverse events such as RVO. Previously there were only case reports, which could hardly disclose any associations [4]. The nationwide and population-based design of this study has good statistical power and risk appraisal precision, especially since we used the TCR, which contains definite diagnoses of colorectal cancers. The survival, medication and procedure records in the TCR are precise, which challenges a shortcoming of most database studies. Our patients with RVO were identified throughout the country, and had undergone a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis by ophthalmologists or retinal subspecialists from an array of different hospitals, including clinics, district hospitals, regional hospitals and medical centers. Furthermore, we used a cohort study design to explore the RVO incidence in colorectal cancer patients receiving anti-VEGF treatment, and in controls. Finally, our results were reliable because the anti-VEGF group had much higher mortality than the control group, which was reasonable and compatible with the reimbursement policy for anti-VEGF treatment for colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "There were some limitations to our study. We excluded those who had AMI and stroke histories, which included 12,848 patients from the original cohort. Patients with AMI or stroke history tended to have more risk factors in common with RVO, so we excluded them to avoid the possibility of interaction. We also excluded 18,197 patients without initial clinical staging data for colorectal cancer, since we intended to use clinical stage as one of the covariates. This number was almost 20% of our original population, and their exclusion may have reduced the statistical power of our study. While the initial cancer stage was likely to be more advanced in the anti-VEGF group than in the control group, we assumed all patients in the antiVEGF group to be at stage 4, due to the reimbursement regulations. The survival curve (Fig.\u00a0 3) resembling patients with metastatic colon cancer lends credence to this assumption [24]. However, the registry system could not provide us with data on when the patients developed recurrent disease or advanced to stage 4. Since initial clinical stage was one of the important factors related to our treatment group and controls, missing data may have introduced some bias in this study. The number of cases with RVO outcome was too small, leading to a lack of statistical power. Also, there was a large gap in mortality rate between the anti-VEGF\ngroup and the control group (Fig.\u00a0 3). The anti-VEGF group had lower survival, meaning that the patients might expire before they could develop RVO. Thus, we used the mortality rate as a competing risk factor and conducted a subgroup analysis, which delivered a similar result to our primary analysis. We also used a causespecific hazard model to recheck the HR, which yielded similar results. We furthermore tried excluding those with RVO histories and the result remained robust. Due to the small case numbers of our outcomes, we did not attempt to sub-group by different anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment cohort."

            "text": "In this study, we observed a non-significant trend towards an increased risk of RVO among mCRC patients treated with anti-VEGF therapy. Additionally, we identified older age and a prior history of RVO as potential risk factors for the development of RVO. Our analysis yielded an NNH of 1635, suggesting that anti-VEGF therapy remains a relatively safe treatment option for mCRC patients. However, it is important for physicians to closely monitor patients for any changes in vision while undergoing anti-VEGF therapy. Given the limited number of RVO cases observed in this study, further large-scale population-based post-marketing surveillance studies are needed to confirm these findings.\nAbbreviations CRC Colorectal cancer mCRC Metastatic colorectal cancer OS Overall survival PFS Progression\u2011free survival EGFR Anti\u2011epidermal growth factor receptor CRVO Central retinal vein occlusion BRVO Branched retinal vein occlusion RVO Retinal vein occlusion NHID National Health Insurance Database TCR Taiwan Cancer Registr DM Diabetes mellitus HRs Hazard ratios NO Nitric oxide APS Antiphospholipid syndrome CRAO Central retinal artery occlusion\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12885\u2011 023\u2011 11037\u20114.\nAdditional file\u00a01.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to the Health Data Science Center and National Cheng Kung University Hospital for providing administrative and technical support.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institutional Review Board of Chi\u2011Mei Medical Center in Taiwan.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions W.\u2011J.
