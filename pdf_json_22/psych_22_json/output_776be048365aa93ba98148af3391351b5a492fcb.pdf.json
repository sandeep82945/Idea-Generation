We measured the psychological impact of the event, post-traumatic growth, team cohesion, social support, and known risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, we assessed the impact of the event on GME-specific tasks.\nResults: Attending faculty and physicians in training in GME residencies evaluated over 300 penetrating trauma patients in less than 24 hours, and approximately 1 in 3 physicians had a patient die under their care. Despite this potential for psychological trauma, the majority of clinicians reported minimal distress and minimal impact on GME activities. However, 1 in 10 physicians screened positive for possible PTSD. Paradoxically, the minority of physicians who sought psychological counseling after the event (20%) were not those who reported the highest levels of distress. Residents generally assessed the event as having an overall negative impact on their educational goals, while attendings reported a positive impact. Psychological impact correlated inversely with social support and the amount of prior education relating to mass casualty incidents (MCI) but correlated directly with the degree of stress prior to the event.\nConclusion: Despite the substantial level of exposure, most resident physicians did not report significant psychological trauma or an impact on their GME mission. Some reported post-traumatic growth. However, a minority reported a significant negative impact; institutions should consider broad screening efforts to detect and assist these individuals after a MCI. Social support, stress reduction, and education on MCIs may buffer the effects of future psychologically traumatic events on physicians in training.

The Impact on academics was negative for residents, positive for attendings (2.5 vs 4.9 on 1 to 7 scale; P < 0.01).\nHow does this improve population health?

            "text": "Teaching hospitals serve a dual role, providing for both graduate medical education (GME) and patient care. This necessarily intertwines teaching and learning activities with unpredictable and traumatic patient care events such as mass casualty incidents (MCI). Mass shootings, which occur in the United States at a rate of approximately one every 12.5 days,1 represent a subset of MCIs with a potential to inflict profound psychological distress on physicians. Exposure to such events may lead to disruption of personal and professional activities and lead to acute stress disorders, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, complicated grief, and psychological distress.2\nOne such event occurred on October 1, 2017, when an individual armed with multiple weapons opened fire on spectators at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada. This event was the deadliest mass shooting in US history3: 58 people died at the scene or soon thereafter, with two additional deaths from subsequent complications of injuries. Over 400 additional patients sustained penetrating injuries from gunshots and/or shrapnel, with hundreds of other injuries sustained in the subsequent panic of the crowd.4 The overwhelming volume and acuity of critically injured patients exceeded the capacity of emergency medical services at the concert venue, and large numbers of patients were transported to hospitals by private vehicles. Two nearby trauma centers, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center (SHMC) and University Medical Center of Southern Nevada (UMC), both academic training facilities, received most of the injured patients and cared for hundreds of gunshot patients over the span of a few hours. The attending and resident physicians from these centers were exposed to an extraordinary number of emotionally intense traumatic injuries, far beyond the typical experience of clinicians.\nPsychologically traumatic exposures such as this can lead to significant post-traumatic stress for some healthcare workers.5 The emergency department (ED) setting, where attending and resident physicians stabilize victims of trauma, has historically reported high rates of post-traumatic stress.6 Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) range from 2.2-24%, depending on definition and measurement technique.5 Affected physicians may show typical signs of post-traumatic stress including involuntary upsetting memories, flashbacks, involuntary responses to external cues, and physical symptoms such as palpitations upon exposure to a reminder of the event.7 However, most physicians exposed to psychologically traumatic events do not develop PTSD. Thus, systemic or personal factors, beyond mere exposure, contribute to the psychological impact of a traumatic event on an individual physician.8\nThe best researched systemic factor demonstrating a consistent inverse relationship with the risk of development of PTSD is the degree of social support.9 Prior training in stressful events, and methods of coping with the psychological aftermath, have also correlated with a protective effect against\nthe development of PTSD.10,11 Individual factors linked to the development of PTSD include age (older individuals are at higher risk), the amount of professional training and education (more years are protective), and the presence of pre-existing mental health disorders (those impacted are at increased risk).5 While traumatic events may cause substantial negative impact, for some individuals trauma may lead to growth. Post-traumatic growth is a well-researched process in which an individual exposed to a psychologically traumatic event undergoes productive personal development leading to higher functioning.12 Post-traumatic growth occurs through changes in one or more of several psychological domains: appreciation of life, relationship with others, new possibilities or purpose in life, personal strength, or spiritual change.13\nWhile several studies have looked at the impact of stressors such as pandemics and MCIs on physicians\u2019 personal lives, and to a lesser extent their professional lives, there is a paucity of evidence on the impact of traumatic events specifically on the GME mission. The lack of understanding of this potential impact is especially concerning given that academic hospitals, which are frequently larger urban trauma centers, often provide a disproportionate amount of patient care during these MCIs. Thus, in our study we sought to evaluate the self-reported impact of the deadliest mass shooting event in US history on peri-traumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and GME-related activities among residents and attending faculty at two teaching hospitals.\nVolume 24, NO.2: March 2023 251 Western Journal of Emergency Medicine"

The timing of the survey represented the earliest point that the researchers were able to develop a protocol and obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval at both institutions following the event. No contemporaneously recorded logs of physicians present during the event exist due to the chaos that evening and the addition of unscheduled clinicians from multiple disciplines who arrived on scene spontaneously. Thus, we obtained a list from both institutions of all credentialed physicians who had potentially assisted during the mass shooting event. All physicians were contacted by email with an introduction to the study, a link to the survey, and a request for participants who were involved in caring for the patients from this event either the evening of October 1, 2017, or the morning after. Those who confirmed involvement were included in the study. The study was approved by the IRBs of both SHMC and UMC."

While many participants assumed direct patient care roles some may have provided non-clinical activities such as assisting with supplies, providing information, or offering psycho-social support. These questions included the following:\n\u2022 Did you personally provide direct care to a shooting victim? \u2022 Did you personally have a patient from the Las Vegas\nshooting, who you were treating, die during your care? \u2022 Did you personally have to inform relatives or loved ones of\na patient\u2019s death? \u2022 Did you personally witness images resulting from violence\nthat were out of the ordinary for you as a physician? \u2022 Did you feel personally at risk of injury or death during\nthe event? The survey included four previously psychometrically\nvalidated scales as outcome measures. The Impact of Events Scale \u2013 Revised (IES-R) is a 22-item self-report of the degree of subjective distress following a traumatic event. Respondents assess the degree to which they experience each item on a fivepoint scale ranging from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d14 Posttraumatic growth was assessed with the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory - Short Form (PTGI), a 10-item scale with ranges between zero (\u201cdid not experience this\u201d) and five (\u201cexperienced\nto a very great degree\u201d).15 This scale captures the degree of positive changes in each of the five domains of growth that may occur following a traumatic event.\nWe assessed the impact of environmental factors using two scales: the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and four items measuring team cohesion from the Team Development Measure. The MSPSS is a 12- item scale with ranges between 1 (\u201cvery strongly disagree\u201d) and 7 (\u201cvery strongly agree\u201d) that captures perceived social support from family, friends, and significant others.16 The team cohesion factor (TCF) consists of a four-item scale that measures the degree to which the respondent feels the team they were on was united and that they personally contributed to the overall mission of the team, using a five-point Likert scale from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d17\nIn addition, several questions were asked to assess the perceived personal impact of the event, scored on a seven-point Likert scale. These questions were developed by a review of the literature, item development, and then content validation by group discussion among authors with expertise in clinical psychology. The question structure was developed by one author who is an academic psychologist with expertise in survey design methodology. These questions included the following:\n\u2022 How frequently have you found yourself avoiding a particular type of patient? For example, avoiding treating patients with penetrating trauma. [Anchors of \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cAll the Time\u201d]\n\u2022 How frequently have you found yourself having difficulty taking care of a particular type of patient? For example, having strong emotions while treating patients with penetrating trauma. [Anchors of \u201cNever\u201d to \u201cAll the Time\u201d]\n\u2022 In general, how would you say the Las Vegas shooting experience impacted your academic clinical practice? (Ability to teach, model, and perform in GME)? [Anchors of \u201cStrong Negative Impact\u201d to \u201cStrong Positive Impact\u201d]\n\u2022 I have considered changing my specialty because of the event.

[Anchored \u201cStrongly agree\u201d to \u201cStrongly disagree\u201d]\nOther known risk factors for peri-traumatic stress were assessed by the following questions:\n\u2022 Prior to the shooting, did you ever seek treatment for any of the following conditions? Anxiety, depression, PTSD, obsessive/compulsive disorder, personality disorder, Any other mental health condition.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We sought to determine the potential psychological and educational impact of the worst mass shooting event in US history on members of the GME community who cared for the patients. Consistent with prior literature, most participants, both attendings and residents, reported relatively low levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms five to six months after the event. The vast majority of participants did not intend to either leave medicine or change specialty as a result of this specific exposure to a MCI. Roughly 1 in 10 participants reported symptoms severe enough to be considered PTSD. A previous prevalence screening study of 190 physicians at trauma centers in Texas found a similar rate, with 13% reporting they had previously sought treatment for PTSD-type symptoms.6 In the Texas study, 16% of ED attendings, 29% of EM residents, and 22% of surgery residents screened at risk for PTSD. Surprisingly, not one of the 15 trauma surgeons screened positive. This is consistent with our current study, which also showed no surgery attending or resident endorsing a level of psychological impact that would suggest PTSD. However, other studies of trauma surgeons have demonstrated a 15% rate of probable PTSD.19 Thus, it remains unclear whether surgery selects for or develops individuals with a lower risk of PTSD overall or whether social response or selection bias accounts for the lack of surgeons endorsing mental health symptoms in some studies. Importantly, almost all studies used short screening surveys to screen for PTSD, which may overestimate the true rates of clinical PTSD. A study using a survey comprised of the full Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed, criteria found a PTSD rate of 2.2% in physicians.20\nThis suggests that efforts to mitigate the impact of psychologically traumatic events in the GME community should begin with screening to detect those more likely to benefit from additional interventions, rather than comprehensive trauma intervention programs designed for all involved. Most individuals exposed to psychological trauma do not develop PTSD,21 and early interventions such as mandatory debriefing sessions for all clinicians have not demonstrated efficacy.22\nDespite the profound potential of the Las Vegas mass shooting to create psychological trauma, we found that few physicians chose to mitigate the impact with help-seeking behaviors. Paradoxically, the few participants who did seek help were not those with the highest reported distress. This inverse relationship between help-seeking and degree of distress is also seen in the depression literature, which has shown that the most distressed individuals are often the least likely to seek help.23 This pattern has serious implications regarding the typical institutional practice of suggesting to physicians, \u201cIf you need help, ask for help.\u201d Those who most need help often will not ask.\nRegarding GME-specific tasks, the majority of both attendings and residents reported minimal to no impact from the event. Overall, the impact on educational activities was independent of the psychological impact of the event, as evidenced by the near-zero correlation between the IES-R and the global assessment of educational impact. However, residents differed from attendings in their assessment of the educational impact on GME activities. Residents reported the event as negatively impacting their GME experience, while attendings presumably reframed the event as one in which growth occurred. This bias toward growth was seen despite the fact that attendings, far more than residents, correctly recognized the MCI as \u201coutside the normal experience for a physician.\u201d Residents may have perceived the MCI as creating a substantial increase in workload. This may have created a work and learning environment perceived as too heavily focused on clinical service vs education. Additionally, residents faced with increased work demands may not have recognized the potential educational impact of the MCI.\nDespite reporting similar profiles in overall psychological impact, post-traumatic growth, team cohesion, and perceived stress, attending physicians perceived the impact of this traumatic event on the didactic environment differently than the resident physicians. Some possible explanations may include differences in age, psychological resources, sense of purpose, autonomy, confidence in patient care, or commitment to an organization.\nWestern Journal of Emergency Medicine 256 Volume 24, NO.2: March 2023\nThe retrospective assessment of the impact of the event may be a function of the demands placed on the individual and the resources they employ to meet those demands. For example, since residents do not possess a complete skillset and work under supervision, it is possible they may have experienced a greater sense of helplessness, which has been linked to the development of peri-traumatic distress.24 It is also possible that an MCI may be perceived by certain experienced physicians as an opportunity to demonstrate competency, while for residents such an event may potentially expose weaknesses or knowledge gaps related to their level of training. Although residents did not report greater psychological distress, they did report a more negative perceived impact on their education. Residents\u2019 primary developmental goal is professional growth toward independent practice, while attendings have achieved this milestone and are focused on various other objectives. The impact of an MCI appears to disrupt educational goals variably, more frequently for physicians in training, and only for a minority of residents.\nConsistent with prior literature, we found that social support was inversely associated with distress. Social support plays a substantial role in overall well-being, as it mitigates depression, encourages work engagement, and buffers stressors in the environment.25 Deliberate institutional efforts to develop and sustain high levels of collegiality and perceived social support create positive work environments. This likely mitigates the psychological impact of catastrophic events such as the Las Vegas shooting on the healthcare team. Similarly, the association between perceived baseline stress prior to the event and subsequent psychological impact26 provides a target for institutions hoping to mitigate the impact of a similar event. Broad efforts to improve the workplace environment and lessen perceived stress on the GME community should be supported for many reasons. Our study demonstrates yet another domain in which the high levels of baseline stress can negatively impact GME physicians.\nPrior studies have shown a relationship between the risk of PTSD and both a sense of helplessness and the degree of prior training in MCIs.5,27,28 Consistent with this finding we found an inverse relationship between prior training in MCIs, including training on their psychological impact, and the impact of a traumatic exposure on GME physicians. Institutions should prioritize training in MCIs and the psychological impact of these events as a strategy for mitigating clinician distress. These training events do not require inordinate time commitments. In our study incremental differences of 1-2 hours predicted less psychological distress.\nFor both cohorts, the degree of psychological impact positively correlated with post-traumatic growth: a relationship noted in prior research in general29 and specifically among emergency physicians.30 Post-traumatic growth arises out of the psychological struggle to integrate traumatic events with one\u2019s prior understanding of the world. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between\npsychological trauma and growth in hopes of promoting positive individual development, rather than maladaptive behaviors, after exposure to trauma."

            "heading": "LIMITATIONS",
            "text": "Our research has several limitations. The total number of physicians who actually participated in the care of patients during the Las Vegas MCI is unknown, and thus our survey response rate is unknown. The degree of individual distress may have impacted physicians\u2019 willingness to participate in the survey, thereby biasing our study population to reflect a less generalizable cohort. Given that participants selfselected to complete the survey our cohort may suffer from selection bias, as the overall population of physicians who experienced the MCI may differ from those who agreed to participate. Similarly, given the anonymity of the study and the contemporaneous chaos of the event, we cannot confirm that all participants were actually involved in the event other than through their endorsement of being eligible for the study, nor can we determine the extent or nature of the experience of individual participants. While some participants were directly involved in patient care others may have been involved in providing ancillary services such as transportation, logistics assistance, or psycho-social support.\nThe survey was distributed five to six months following the mass shooting; therefore, participant responses reflect their understanding of the event after contemplation. A follow-up survey to assess trends and possible longer term impact of the event is under development. Typically, disasters create predictable psychological phases of various durations.31 Initially, the heroic and honeymoon phases last weeks to months and create a sense of social support and hope. The disillusionment phase follows when the realities of the impact of the disaster may be unopposed by the more positive support from the earlier phases. This may last between 3-36 months followed by the final restorative phase. Thus, the timing of our survey likely corresponds with the disillusionment phase; surveys conducted in earlier or later phases may have yielded different results.\nAge, which is related to psychological distress and thus can be a confounder, was not assessed to avoid identification of any specific individual\u2019s responses. However, the analysis by group (resident vs attending) serves as an imperfect proxy assessment of this variable. Due to the small sample size we did not attempt to compare various specialties to one another in their response to the event. Some specialties, such as the two radiologists who completed the survey, may have had a different level of exposure to trauma than other specialties. However, unlike in routine care, some radiologists came to the bedside during the event to interpret radiographs on portable imaging machines, exposing them to unusual scenes of violence.\nSome of the measures, such as the TCF, asked participants about the level of teamwork at the time of the event which could have resulted in recall bias, as residents\nVolume 24, NO.2: March 2023 257 Western Journal of Emergency Medicine\nwith greater or lesser overall impact may have recalled their team cohesion differently. The unpredictability of mass shootings creates significant barriers to any prospective research on the impact of psychological trauma on the GME mission.\nAlthough we asked participants whether they sought psychological assistance following the event, we did not inquire as to the specific type of intervention obtained. Some evidence suggests a differential impact on post-traumatic symptoms depending on the type of psychological approach used; and we could not determine what approaches were employed in our sample population.\nFuture research on psychological trauma within the GME population may help better characterize the factors that determine the likelihood of an individual developing post-traumatic growth or PTSD symptoms. An examination of why some groups retrospectively view trauma with growth while others view it as entirely negative could yield valuable insights to assist future development of pre- and peri-event interventions."
