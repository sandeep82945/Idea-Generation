OBJECTIVE To determine whether HCW emotional exhaustion has increased during the pandemic, for which roles, and at what point. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This survey study was conducted in 3 waves, with an electronic survey administered in September 2019, September 2020, and September 2021 through January 2022. Participants included hospital-based HCWs in clinical and nonclinical (eg, administrative support) roles at 76 community hospitals within 2 large health care systems in the US. EXPOSURES Safety, Communication, Organizational Reliability, Physician, and Employee Burnout and Engagement (SCORE) survey domains of emotional exhaustion and emotional exhaustion climate. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The percentage of respondents reporting emotional exhaustion (%EE) in themselves and a climate of emotional exhaustion (%EEclim) in their colleagues. Survey items were answered on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree); neutral or higher scores were counted as \u201cpercent concerning\u201d for exhaustion. RESULTS Electronic surveys were returned by 37 187 (of 49 936) HCWs in 2019, 38 460 (of 45 268) in 2020, and 31 475 (of 41 224) in 2021 to 2022 for overall response rates of 74.5%, 85.0%, and 76.4%, respectively. The overall sample comprised 107 122 completed surveys. Nursing was the most frequently reported role (n = 43 918 [40.9%]). A total of 17 786 respondents (16.9%) reported less than 1 year at their facility, 59 226 (56.2%) reported 1 to 10 years, and 28 337 (26.9%) reported 11 years or more. From September 2019 to September 2021 through January 2022, overall %EE increased from 31.8% (95% CI, 30.0%-33.7%) to 40.4% (95% CI, 38.1%-42.8%), with a proportional increase in %EE of 26.9% (95% CI, 22.2%-31.8%). Physicians had a decrease in %EE from 31.8% (95% CI, 29.3%-34.5%) in 2019 to 28.3% (95% CI, 25.9%-31.0%) in 2020 but an increase during the second year of the pandemic to 37.8% (95% CI, 34.7%-41.3%). Nurses had an increase in %EE during the pandemic\u2019s first year, from 40.6% (95% CI, 38.4%-42.9%) in 2019 to 46.5% (95% CI, 44.0%-49.1%) in 2020 and increasing again during the second year of the pandemic to 49.2% (95% CI, 46.5%-51.9%). All other roles showed a similar pattern to nurses but at lower levels. Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed clustering of exhaustion within work settings across the 3 years, with coefficients of 0.15 to 0.17 for emotional exhaustion and 0.22 to 0.24 for emotional exhaustion climate, higher than the .10 coefficient typical of organizational climate (a medium effect for shared variance), suggestive of a social contagion effect of HCW exhaustion. (continued) Key Points Question Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with an increase in health care worker emotional exhaustion? Findings In this 3-year survey study with an overall sample of 107 122 responses from US health care workers before (2019) and twice during (2020 and 2021-2022) the COVID-19 pandemic, increases were reported in assessments of emotional exhaustion in oneself and in one\u2019s colleagues overall and for every role; nurses reported increases each year, but physicians reported decreases in 2020 followed by sharp increases in 2021. Exhaustion score clustering in work settings was suggestive of a social contagion effect of exhaustion. Meaning These findings indicate that emotional exhaustion among health care workers, which was problematic before the pandemic, has become worse; increases in emotional exhaustion may jeopardize care quality and necessitate additional support for the workforce. + Invited Commentary + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

            "text": "The challenges posed by COVID-19 have been an excessive test to human well-being around the world. Few groups experienced this stress more acutely than the health care workers (HCWs) who persistently placed themselves in harm\u2019s way to serve patients. Early during the pandemic, HCWs were recognized as heroes facing the uncertainty of a new health crisis. Unique demands for remote learning, working, and child care required adaptation, as did uncertainty around available resources, evolving visitation policies, accessibility of vaccines, consequences of vaccine mandates, and the overt politicization of public health during historically tumultuous times.\nThe Delta and Omicron surges then delivered high proportions of unvaccinated patients and their family members to HCWs who had endured emotional and physical exhaustion for 18 months. Simultaneously, HCWs experienced acute staffing shortages and an intensification of incivility directed at them for following protocols intended to keep everyone safe. Health care workers being accosted and accused of conspiracies was not uncommon. Moral injuries of this kind have been described as the negative impact of exposure to transgressions of deeply held moral beliefs and expectations.1 Moral injury in HCWs is consistently associated with lower quality of life and higher levels of emotional exhaustion.2,3 Perhaps it should not be a surprise that 40% of nurses and 23.8% of physicians plan to exit their practice in the next 2 years.4 The pandemic has taken a toll on HCW mental health, and the story is still unfolding.\nIn the first year of the pandemic, prior to the Delta and Omicron surges, a systematic review and meta-analysis5 of HCW mental health identified a high prevalence (22%) of moderate depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. A comparison of post-9/11 combat veterans to HCWs during the pandemic demonstrated roughly equivalent rates of moral injury in both groups.6 For combat veterans, risk increased with exposure to post-battle traumatic experiences, but for HCWs, the increase came with working in higher-risk COVID-19 units and exposure to COVID-19. The disproportionate psychological, emotional, and spiritual burden sustained by HCWs has been called burnout, moral distress, compassion fatigue, and a host of similar monikers, but there is one marker of HCW mental health that has received more empirical attention and has more psychometric validity than any other: emotional exhaustion (EE).\nAccording to a psychometric meta-analysis, of the 3 subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory7 (EE, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment), EE consistently produces the largest and most reliable Cronbach \u03b1 estimates.8 To date, the most thoroughly researched HCW mental health marker is EE. Other metrics, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and moral injury, may have more dire consequences than EE (this isn\u2019t yet known), but they have not yet been studied as comprehensively, for as long, or in as many HCWs.9\nInterventions designed to reduce EE among HCWs are ongoing and have included coaching10,11; changes to scheduling, workflows, and workload12; positive rounding13,14; bite-sized well-being strategies15-18; and structured efforts to increase meaning among groups of HCWs.19 These interventions are generally associated with a change in EE of at least 5 points on a 100-point scale. Among physicians, the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) across the country between 2011 and 2014 co-occurred with a 9-point increase in EE, from 38% to 47%.20,21 Relative to\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(9):e2232748. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.32748 (Reprinted) September 21, 2022 2/11\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/17/2024\nthe taxing nature of transitioning to EHRs, the effect of a global pandemic has not yet been thoroughly studied.\nDespite a rapid increase in research on HCW EE since 2010, few high-quality, large-scale longitudinal or cross-sectional studies are available (see Shanafelt et al22 or Aiken et al23 for exceptions). Emotional exhaustion rates among HCWs were already considered alarmingly high before the pandemic,24,25 prompting the 2019 release of the National Academy of Medicine consensus report26 on taking action against clinician burnout. Recent cross-sectional surveys suggest that EE increased among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic,27 but to date, no large-scale surveys of the same individuals before and after the onset of the pandemic have been published. Despite the variety of opportunities for HCWs to experience pandemic exhaustion, relatively little is known about the evolution of EE among HCWs over time."

Emotional exhaustion was assessed using routine electronic (via email and/or access to a generic link) administration of the Safety, Communication, Organizational Reliability, Physician and Employee Burnout and Engagement (SCORE)28 survey in 2 US health care systems across 76 widely geographically dispersed hospitals before the pandemic (September 2019), after the start of the pandemic (September 2020), and after the introduction of vaccines and vaccine mandates and the rise of the Delta variant (September 2021 in the first system and December 2021 through January 2022 in the second system). All eligible staff at the 2 health systems with 50% or greater full-time equivalent commitment to a specific work setting for at least 4 consecutive weeks were asked to complete the survey. Demographic variables such as age, sex, and race were not collected during these routine survey administrations. The SCORE survey assesses safety culture and workforce well-being and engagement, including an EE scale and an emotional exhaustion climate (EEclim) scale, because HCW well-being was increasingly recognized as common,24,25 expensive,29 and treatable.17,18 Emotional exhaustion assesses the extent to which one feels drained, overwhelmed, and unable to meet demands. Example items from the SCORE survey include \u201cI feel frustrated by my job\u201d and \u201cevents in this work setting affect my life in an emotionally unhealthy way.\u201d In parallel, EEclim assesses the extent to which one perceives EE in their colleagues. Example items include \u201cpeople in this work setting feel frustrated by their jobs\u201d and \u201cevents in this work setting affect the lives of people here in an emotionally unhealthy way.\u201d The response scale for EE and EEclim range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), such that higher scores reflect higher levels of exhaustion (eFigure in the Supplement).

Exhaustion levels varied considerably by HCW role within each of the 3 years, so the vulnerability of a given HCW to increases in EE was a function of both role and year of assessment.\nDifferences between physician and nonphysician assessments of workplace norms are not new,37 and the emotional exhaustion discrepancies reported here for September 2020 are similar to previous results from April 2020, when nurses reported significantly more acute stress, depression, and anxiety than their physician counterparts.38 Anecdotally, nurses in 2020 reported higher patient volumes, rapidly evolving processes and standards, and significant burdens from child care, remote learning, and work-life integration concerns.

We now know that HCW burnout is a parallel pandemic that will be felt for many years to come. Leaders need tiered options for responding to burnout, but the evidence has not kept pace with the demand for well-being resources in health care settings. The National Academy of Medicine26 report on clinician burnout and the Surgeon General\u2019s advisory on HCW burnout39 are calls to action for improving our health care delivery systems in ways that reduce EE and promote quality. We suggest that there is a need for both institutional13,28,40 and individual16-18 resources for HCW well-being, as evidenced by the role-specific findings reported here. Ideally, organizations would realize that fixing systems intrinsically includes a focus on individual HCW well-being through the application of meaningful and evidence-based options to improve it. We know this is possible because randomized controlled trial results10,15 demonstrate that we can cause EE among HCWs to decrease in magnitudes similar to the rates of increase reported here. Well-being resources for HCWs need to be broadly accessible and evidence-based, and their use should be role-modeled by leaders. We are only beginning to understand the toll of the pandemic on HCW well-being, and much more will be revealed over the next few years."

            "text": "Results should be viewed in light of study design. Only EE and EEclim were assessed, so other dimensions of well-being, such as anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, moral distress, and depersonalization were not included. We did not have access to physician specialty, work setting type, or other demographic or confounding variables. In 2020, some physician specialties were especially burdened in caring for patients with COVID-19 while others initially had decreased patient loads when routine procedures stopped or telehealth took hold. We did not have access to physician specialties to distinguish between these specialty groups. Also, these results came from 2 large US health systems, and although they are systems that are widely dispersed around the US, the extent to which they are broadly generalizable is unknown. Another limitation is the lack of unique identifiers that would allow for comparisons of the same HCWs with themselves from before to after the start of the pandemic, rather than the group-level differences reported here. Singling out respiratory therapists from occupational and physical therapists would have allowed for more specificity within that role but was not possible owing to the broad categories used. This study is also limited in its use of self-report data, which are at risk for response, selection, and social desirability biases. The good psychometric results for EE and EEclim within each year, as well as the large sample sizes and high response rates, help to buffer against some of these limitations."

            "text": "The findings of this survey study provide substantial evidence that EE has increased overall and in most HCW roles since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. On a hopeful note, the magnitude of the increase in EE is within striking distance of the decreases in EE achieved in clinical trials of bite-sized interventions used by HCWs. We found that nurses, in particular, have shouldered more than their share of this pandemic since the start, and that physicians experienced a temporary reprieve in 2020 that was followed by the biggest single-year increase in EE for any role at any time point. Existing programs and resources to facilitate HCW well-being were inadequate before the pandemic and now appear to be woefully inadequate. This situation is made more complicated by the results reported here, because the workforce has even less reserve and capacity to initiate, sustain, and complete interventions to improve their well-being.\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(9):e2232748. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.32748 (Reprinted) September 21, 2022 8/11\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/17/2024\nARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: August 2, 2022.\nPublished: September 21, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.32748\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Sexton JB et al.
