However, characterizing the excited states of the constituent chromophores poses a considerable challenge to mainstream quantum chemical and semiempirical excited state methods due to their size and complexity and the accuracy required to describe small but functionally important changes in their properties. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to calculating the excited states of large biochromophores, exemplified by a specific method for calculating the Qy transition of bacteriochlorophyll a, which we name Chl-xTB. Using a diagonally dominant approximation to the Casida equation and a bespoke parameterization scheme, Chl-xTB can match time-dependent density functional theory\u2019s accuracy and semiempirical speed for calculating the potential energy surfaces and absorption spectra of chlorophylls. We demonstrate that Chl-xTB (and other prospective realizations of our protocol) can be integrated into multiscale models, including concurrent excitonic and point-charge embedding frameworks, enabling the analysis of biochromophore networks in a native environment. We exploit this capability to probe the low-frequency spectral densities of excitonic energies and interchromophore interactions in the light harvesting antenna protein LH2 (light harvesting complex 2). The impact of low-frequency protein motion on interchromophore coupling and exciton transport has routinely been ignored due to the prohibitive costs of including it in simulations. Our results provide a more rigorous basis for continued use of this approximation by demonstrating that exciton transition energies are unaffected by low-frequency vibrational coupling to exciton interaction energies. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nMany of the most interesting systems are the most challenging to model and the electronically excited states of large biochromophores are a prime example. These states do not exist in isolation but are deeply connected to their environment. Computational models of these systems must be able to treat not only the large chromophores themselves but also key interactions with their expansive surroundings, which may include complex protein structures and even vast, interconnected networks of other chromophores.\nThe biochromophore networks in natural light harvesting complexes (LHCs) are particularly interesting as a source of inspiration for artificial light harvesting technologies, not least because they are capable of converting absorbed photons (from anywhere in the network) to usable electrons (in the reaction center) with near\nperfect quantum efficiency.1 Light harvesting complex 2 (LH2), found in purple bacteria (rsp. Acidophilus), is one of the most commonly studied photosynthetic antenna complexes2\u20138 due to the early availability of its crystal structure.9,10 Extensive experimental and theoretical characterization of this complex has offered insights into LH2 exciton states,11 energy transfer timescales,12,13 excitation diffusion lengths,14 energetic fine-tuning by local effects such as H-bonding,15,16 and more. However, measurements of light harvesting complexes are often hampered by the structural complexity of the system, which leads to considerable spectral congestion. Furthermore, the myriad processes (and timescales) contributing to exciton transport can make it hard to pinpoint the fundamental structural and environmental features that underpin LHC efficiency.\nThe size and complexity of light harvesting networks make computational characterization equally challenging. Each of the 27\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\ninteracting bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) molecules in the LH2 complex contains 140 atoms and the surrounding protein consists of a further \u223c6000 atoms.17,18 Calculating the excited states of something the size of BChl a with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) can take several hours even with high-performance, multicore machines.19\u201322\nConsequently, computational studies of biochromophores face an inevitable choice between excited state methods that offer high quantitative accuracy at a cost that limits the scale of the investigation (size of system, number of calculations) or more efficient methods that allow a comprehensive investigation but compromise on accuracy. For detailed characterization of subsystems (e.g., individual chromophores) containing 10\u2013100 s of atoms and with states in well-behaved regions (i.e., single reference states far from conical intersections23,24), TD-DFT has become a go-to choice. In the context of biochromophores, TD-DFT with a CAM-B3LYP25 or PBE026 functional is particularly popular and has been shown to produce reliable predictions of Qy transition energies,27 embedding or polarization effects,28 and excited state gradients.29 However, these calculations are prohibitively costly for large-scale biological simulations. Evaluating the gradients of interacting TD-DFT excited states is particularly expensive as it involves solving coupled-perturbed equations.29\nBy contrast, semiempirical methods, such as ZINDO,30 TD-DFTB,31 and PM6,32 are a more suitable choice when the priority is volume rather than accuracy of calculations. In recent years, an extension of the xTB (extended tight-binding) family of methods to excited states (sTDA-xTB) has proved particularly successful for high-throughput screening of candidates for photocatalytic33 and optoelectronic34 processes. Semiempirical approaches achieve orders of magnitude speedup over TD-DFT by replacing some degree of quantum mechanical detail with judicious parameterization. Common approximations include neglecting long-range interactions (as in tight-binding models35,36) and replacing expensive two-electron integrals with a simpler physical model like a point-charge interaction.37\u201339 However, it is near-impossible for even very well-optimized parameters to completely capture the neglected quantum mechanical detail in all cases, particularly if they aim to describe systems with fundamentally very different chemistry.\nUnfortunately, studies of the dynamical properties of biochromophores or their interactions with the environment typically require many repeated evaluations of excited state properties. For example, a recent investigation40 comparing the system\u2013bath interactions of LH2 and LH3 and their effect on EET efficiency (measured in terms of exciton population transfer) involved calculating spectral densities (a parameter describing the coupling between excited state energies and vibrational modes), each of which required 3\u20134 million energy evaluations. With TD-DFT, this would equate to months of CPU time. Furthermore, these calculations needed to capture the relatively small (\u223c0.2 to 0.4 eV) fluctuations in exciton energies induced by vibrations of the chromophores and surrounding protein. Chlorophyll Qy transition energies in different LHCs vary over a similar range,41,42 setting the bar for required accuracy (note that sTDA-xTB can only describe transition energies with an accuracy of 0.3\u20130.5 eV compared to a SCS-CC2 reference43). Machine learning (ML) methods offer one route to highly accurate, efficient excited state calculations. For instance, kernel ridge regression models have\nbeen used to predict Qy transition energies of the eight sites of the Fenna\u2013Matthews\u2013Olson (FMO) complex with a \u223c0.3 meV error compared to TD-DFT,44 in the context of simulating the long-term dynamics of LH2.44,45 However, supervised learning architectures have to be trained on thousands of reference data points, limiting their use to investigations that can justify the initial expense of producing this training data (e.g., extending dynamical simulations to considerably longer times46). The lack of quantum chemistry formalism in ML model architecture also makes it extremely difficult to adapt existing models to new applications by, e.g., introducing polarization effects or deriving gradient functions.\nOur aim in this paper is to develop a protocol for creating bespoke excited state methods that combine high accuracy with high computational efficiency and low training costs for very specific systems. In this way, we hope to add an additional element to the existing toolkit of excited state methods (TD-DFT, semiempirical approaches, ML, etc.) that is particularly suited to investigations requiring large volumes of accurate excited state calculations. We envisage that our protocol will principally find applications in describing the dynamical behavior of biochromophore networks embedded in complex protein or solvent environments. Consequently, along with high efficiency and accuracy, we prioritize an analytical gradient theory, a smooth interface for QM/MM embedding and a straightforward, adaptable implementation as part of the design. Our approach uses many of the approximations of sTDAxTB as a framework for achieving computational efficiency but attains greater accuracy by reoptimizing selected parameters for a single transition of interest. We focus exclusively on training a method to describe the Qy transition in BChl a in LH2 (which is the main transition involved in excitation energy transfer) and also discuss how our protocol could be extended or adapted to other transitions and molecules. To demonstrate the advantage of this particular balance of accuracy, efficiency, specificity, and training cost, we calculate and analyze spectral densities for the LH2 chromophore network, focusing particularly on the coupling of global exciton states to low-frequency vibrations of the protein scaffold, which has been impractical to investigate with existing methods."

Diagonal elements of A describe excitations from occupied to virtual orbitals (i\u2192 a), while off-diagonal elements couple i\u2192 a and j\u2192 b excitations. Elements of B describe subtle exchange interactions between excitation couplings.48 While the entire rotation Hessian matrix is necessary to capture the character of every transition and the coupling between them, it is common to use the Tamm\u2013Dancoff approximation (TDA), which neglects the B matrix contributions. This reduces the eigenvalue equation to AX = \u03c9X. The TDA is often used for large chromophores, including carotenoids49 and chlorophylls,29 as it is less expensive than full TD-DFT. Extensive benchmarking of biochromophores shows that TDA transition energies can sometimes be more accurate than full TD-DFT compared to a CC2 reference, attributed to a cancellation of errors.50\nEven with the TDA, a large number of expensive elements are required to construct the A matrix. The simplified Tamm\u2013Dancoff approximation (sTDA)43 follows a structurally similar formalism to TD- and TDA-DFT (producing excited state properties from ground state MO solutions through the Casida equation), but introduces key approximations to reduce the cost. These include neglecting higher order exchange-correlation terms in the electron density response, truncating the active orbital space, and using point-charge approximations for the remaining two-electron integrals (monopole approximation).\nThe general form for the approximated two-electron integrals under the sTDA is a monopole interaction damped by a generalized Mataga\u2013Nishimoto\u2013Ohno\u2013Klopman37\u201339 (MNOK) Coulomb function,\n(pq\u2223rs) \u2248 N\n\u2211 A,B\nqApqq B rs\u0393(A, B), (4)\nwhere p, q, r, s are general atomic orbital labels and A, B label atom centers. The L\u00f6wdin population scheme51 is used to calculate the atom-centered charges qApq = \u2211\u03bc\u2208AC\u2032\u03bcpC\u2032\u03bcq from orthogonalized molecular orbital coefficients C\u03bc,q since this scheme is not too dependent on the basis set. The MNOK function \u0393 takes different forms depending on whether the full two-electron integral is of Coulomb or exchange type. The kernels for replacing Coulomb-type and exchange-type integrals are\n\u0393JAB = ( 1\n(RAB)yJ + (ax\u03b7)\u2212yJ )\n1 yJ\n(5)\nand\n\u0393KAB = ( 1\n(RAB)yK + \u03b7\u2212yK )\n1 yK\n, (6)\nrespectively. Here, RAB is the interatomic distance and \u03b7 is the mean of the atomic chemical hardnesses (\u03b7 = 12(\u03b7A + \u03b7B) with \u03b7A = \u03b42EA \u03b4N2A\n, where EA and NA are the atomic energy and electron population of atom A). yJ , yK , and ax are global parameters, with the latter used to recover the effects of Fock-exchange mixing in the short-distance limit.\nUsing the integral approximations in Eqs. (4)\u2013(6), the elements of matrix A are given by\nAia,jb = \u03b4ij\u03b4ab(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5i) + N\n\u2211 A,B (2qAia\u0393KABqBjb \u2212 qAij \u0393JABq B ab). (7)\nNote that Eq. (7) neglects the final term from Eq. (2), although its effects are partially accounted for by optimization of the parameters in Eqs. (5) and (6).\nThe sTDA can be used in combination with DFT to replace full linear-response [Eq. (1)], using the MO coefficients and energies from DFT calculations to construct the A matrix. Significant additional speedups can be obtained by replacing the DFT calculations with cheaper semiempirical tight-binding methods like xTB (the family of eXtended Tight Binding models). A full description of xTB methods is beyond the scope of the present discussion, but a detailed review can be found in Ref. 52. In tight-binding approaches, including xTB and DFTB, the cost of constructing the Fock matrix is reduced by approximating the energy functionals with a third order Taylor expansion in deviations of the electronic density and using point-charge interactions to approximate two-electron integrals [similar to the approach already taken in sTDA\u2014Eqs. (4)\u2013(6)]. sTDA-xTB is much more efficient than its sTDA-DFT counterparts, but accuracy in transition energies can suffer from the need to replace neglected elements of the full DFT description with fitted parameters that must capture a very broad range of chemistry.43,53\nsTDA-xTB uses a number of techniques to garner enough chemical detail to accurately describe a range of systems. Some of these are common features of the xTB family of methods, such as using a parameterized H\u00fcckel model for the zeroth order terms of the Fock matrix. Others are unique to sTDA-xTB. In particular, different geometry-dependent basis sets are used to reproduce both diffuse basis function behavior and a correct description of valence orbitals. Additionally, atom-centered charges are calculated as functions of electronegativities (the Gasteiger method54), atomic covalent radii (the CM5 corrected Hirshfield method55), or electron density (the L\u00f6wdin scheme51) to jump-start the self-consistent charge procedure. Each of these components in sTDA-xTB (basis set, charge schemes, and Fock matrix terms) is optimized to mimic corresponding terms in reference ab initio methods (SCS-CC2 for small molecules and PBE0/def2-TZVP for larger systems). The end product produces transition energies that are accurate to between 0.3 and 0.5 eV, relative to SCS-CC2 and TD-DFT/PBE0, for a large range of transitions and systems (open and closed shell electron configurations, organic and metallic systems, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\u2217 transitions, etc.)."

            "text": "While sTDA-xTB provides an excellent framework for reducing the cost of calculating transition properties, its 0.3\u20130.5 eV margin of error exceeds the magnitude of functionally important energy fluctuations in the BChls of LH2 (0.2\u20130.4 eV). Furthermore, calculating the gradients of excited state properties in sTDA-xTB is complicated by the geometry-dependent basis set and, to a lesser extent, the fact that the excited states are found as solutions of an eigenvalue problem. In the following, we introduce an alternative set of approximations to directly address these issues.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\nTo simplify the structure of the calculation, we first approximate A [Eq. (7)] as a diagonal matrix. Transition energies are then simply the diagonal elements of the A matrix (i.e., \u03c9ia \u2248 Aia,ia). This has the joint benefit of reducing the number of A elements that need to be calculated and creating a straightforward gradient theory (analogous to \u0394-SCF56\u201359). Under the approximation of a diagonally dominant A matrix, excited states are characterized entirely by a single orbital excitation. This is equivalent to the single pole approximation, often used as a stepping point in TD-DFT formalism to discretize the response function and resolve excited states.60,61 It is an approximation that is easily justified for the Qy transition in chlorophylls, especially BChl, which is dominated by a single HOMO\u2013LUMO excitation (with a small amount of HOMO-1 \u2192 LUMO+1 character that varies with the specific type of chlorophyll62). Consequently, the off-diagonal coupling elements of the A matrix are very small. Moreover, previous studies have shown a strong correlation between HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital energy differences (i.e., the leading term in diagonal A elements) and Qy transition energies.62\nHowever, neglecting even this small amount of HOMO-1 \u2192 LUMO+1 character introduces a key failing that is seen clearly in the performance of \u0394-SCF in Ref. 59, which similarly treats excited states as a single orbital excitation. While BChl Qy transition energies are accurately reproduced by \u0394-SCF, transition dipole moments (derived by tracing the transition density with the dipole operator) are systematically overestimated compared to a TD-DFT reference by a factor of around 1.6. We mimic the effect of the neglected coupling between HOMO\u2192 LUMO and HOMO-1 \u2192 LUMO+1 by introducing a factor Dscale to scale the HOMO \u2192 LUMO transition density to an approximate Qy transition density DQy = DscaleD HOMO\u2192 LUMO. The scaled transition density is also used in calculating atom-centered transition charges.\nTo achieve a more accurate description of the Qy transition, we also reoptimize the exponents yK , yJ of the MNOK functions and the exact exchange mixing parameter ax [Eqs. (5) and (6)]. These reoptimized parameters describe the specific interactions between states in the Qy transition better than the more general sTDA-xTB parameters, which cover a broader range of systems. The optimized values of these parameters are listed in the Response section of Table I.\nTo fully recover a tractable gradient theory, we replaced the bespoke xTB method in sTDA-xTB with a modified GFN1-xTB method. The GFN-xTB family of methods are parameterized to give high-quality geometry optimizations; consequently, an analytical (and therefore cheap) way of calculating the gradient of the energy with respect to geometry is a key part of their design. However, as these methods are optimized for ground state properties, we reoptimized certain parameters in the zeroth order Fock matrix term,\n\u27e8\u03d5\u03bc\u2223H0\u2223\u03d5\u03bd\u27e9 = kll \u2032 AB 1 2 (kl + kl\u2032) 1 2 (hlA + hl \u2032 B)S\u03bc\u03bd\n\u00d7 (1 + kEN \u0394EN2AB)\u03a0(RAB,ll\u2032) (\u03bc \u2208 l(A), \u03bd \u2208 l(B)). (8)\nThis component of the Fock matrix is an extended H\u00fcckel theory model, where kll \u2032\nAB, k(l,l\u2032) are the \u201cH\u00fcckel constants,\u201d which scale\ninteractions according to the types of atoms A and B and electron shells l and l\u2032. hlA is the (coordination number-dependent) orbital energy, S\u03bc\u03bd the overlap matrix element for molecular orbitals \u03d5\u03bc and \u03d5\u03bd, kEN and \u0394ENAB the scaling and difference in atomic electronegativities, respectively, and \u03a0(RAB,ll\u2032) is a function of pairwise interatomic distances and electron shells. A full set of equations for the Fock matrix can be found in the supplementary material. Many of the terms in Eq. (8) are parameterized to atomic properties that do not differ between ground and excited states and we retained the parameter values derived for GFN1-xTB as well as the GFN1-xTB basis set. This basis set is used in the derivation of GFN1xTB partial charges; so, for consistency, we follow GFN1-xTB in using Mulliken population analysis for partial transition charges (qA = \u2211\u03bc\u2208A(DQy S)\u03bc\u03bc, where qA is the transition charge on atom A and S is the overlap matrix), used in Eq. (7). Mulliken transition charges also lend themselves to a tractable gradient analysis. We note that this is different to sTDA-xTB, which uses the L\u00f6wdin charge scheme.\nHowever, the ks and kp parameters, which describe interatomic electronic interactions, were reoptimized to better describe the s and p shell interactions of BChl. Additionally, since much of the transition density localizes on the N atoms of the porphyrin ring, we also optimized selected kll \u2032\nAB parameters that specifically scaled interactions of the s and p shells of Mg and N: Mgp, Mgs, Np, Ns, Mgs-Ns, Mgs-Np, Mgp-Ns, Mgp-Np. The optimized values of these parameters are listed in the Hamiltonian section of Table I.\nAll the parameters in Table I were optimized simultaneously (as the vector x) by minimizing an objective function given by\nf (x) = c1RMSE(\u0394EQy) + c2(1 \u2212 R2(\u0394EQy)) + c3RMSE(\u2223\u03bcQy \u2223) + c4(1 \u2212 R2(\u2223\u03bcQy \u2223)) (9)\nJ.

The objective function includes the error in transition dipole magnitudes because this reflects the accuracy of the transition density better than error in the transition energies. In this way, we avoid the overestimated transition densities seen in \u0394-SCF. Correlation measures were included to highlight the difference in random vs systematic error and steer the optimization routine toward a well-defined geometry-transition property relationship. Hyperparameters cn were included to ensure equal importance of each term in the solution space. It was found that values of c1 = 1 eV\u22121, c3 = 1 a.u.\u22121, and c2 = c4 = 1 gave the lowest value of the objective function over a logarithmic grid-search of hyper-parameters. Overall, this objective function was designed to emphasize important changes in bacteriochlorophyll transition properties that originate from factors in the local environment (i.e., small changes in the energy and transition density associated with conformational changes determined by the protein scaffold).\nMinimization of the objective function with respect to the variable parameters was performed using Sequential Least-Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP)63 implemented in SciPy.64 Similar to the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method65 used to optimize parts of sTDA-xTB, this modified gradient-descent approach converged in less time and fewer iterations than simplex methods such as Nelder\u2013Mead.66 The initial parameter values used to start the SLSQP procedure were the corresponding values taken from either GFN1xTB or sTDA-xTB (given in Table I). Without existing values for parameters Mgs-Np and Dscale in either GFN1-xTB or sTDA-xTB, these were assigned an initial value of 1 and 0.5, respectively.\nThe TD-DFT reference data used to evaluate RMSE and R2 values were calculated at the PBE0/Def2-SVP26,67 level of theory using the QCORE program.68 The set of reference calculations included 100 uncorrelated BChl a structures from both the B850 and B800 binding pockets of LH2 (from Rsp. Acidophilus). These structures were taken from the same molecular dynamics simulation used to parameterize the model Hamiltonian in Ref. 69 and are provided in the supplementary material. Only BChl a structures were used in order to limit the change in transition properties to geometry fluctuations and not systematic changes (i.e., functional group differences on the porphyrin ring). Clustering of values according to the type of chlorophyll would have artificially inflated the R2 values, stopping the optimization before more subtle features were accounted for. As we only parameterize to the Qy transition of (bacterio)chlorophyll, we name this specific method Chl-xTB. The orientation of Chl-xTB transition dipoles relative to the chlorophyll NA\u2013NC axis was used to ensure that the correct (Qy) transitions were selected at each stage of the optimization procedure.\nCompared to a PBE0/Def2-SVP TD-DFT reference, Chl-xTB with unoptimized parameters gave RMSEs and R2 values of 0.490 eV and 0.156 for excitation energies and 0.699 a.u. and 0.402 for transition dipole moments. However with the optimized parameters in Table I, the RMSE and R2 values for transition energies in the training set were 0.037 eV and 0.878, respectively. The corresponding values for transition dipoles were 0.100 a.u. and 0.664. Although the overall error in the transition dipole magnitude is small, the low R2 value reflects the fact that even scaling the transition density does not fully recover geometry-dependent variations\nin the amount of HOMO\u2192 LUMO, HOMO-1\u2192 LUMO+1 mixing, resulting in an underestimation of larger TDMs. In most cases, the final values of the parameters were not significantly different from the initial guess, indicating that the optimization procedure simply fine-tuned these parameters rather than radically changing the electronic structure description of chlorophyll. The exception is the Fock-exchange mixing parameter ax, which converged on a much smaller value (i.e., lower mixing of exact exchange) than is used in sTDA. However, other studies that employ MNOK functions to approximate two-electron integrals also find best performance with differing exact exchange mixing,70,71 depending on the system and reference excited state method. The difference in the value of ax for Chl-xTB and sTDA-xTB reflects moving from a broad description of many systems to a specific description of the chlorophyll Qy transition."

            "text": "The fully optimized Chl-xTB method (parameters in Table I) was initially benchmarked on a test set of 1026 unseen BChl a geometries, sampled from the same molecular dynamics simulation used to generate the original training set geometries (see above). Figure 1 shows how the energies [panel (a)] and transition dipole magnitudes [panel (b)] predicted by Chl-xTB compare to a PBE0/Def2-SVP reference. There is only a minimal increase in error in BChl a Qy transition energies for these unseen LH2 geometries compared to the original training geometries, with an RMSE of 0.037 eV and R2 of 0.851. This similarity confirms that the Chl-xTB parameters have not been overfit to the training values and that the dependence of the Qy transition on geometry has been accurately captured by Chl-xTB.\nThe PBE0/Def2-SVP level of accuracy that Chl-xTB achieves is higher than would normally be expected from a semiempirical approximation. In Fig. 1, transition energies and dipole moments calculated using Chl-xTB, sTDA-xTB, and PBE0/Def2-SVP are shown against a CAM-B3LYP/Def2-SVP reference, which has been shown to give a good match to experimental values for vertical excitation energies.72 Compared to this reference, the RMSEs in the transition energies are 0.517, 0.116, and 0.147 eV for sTDAxTB, Chl-xTB, and PBE0/Def2-SVP, respectively. The corresponding spreads of error in each method, captured by R2, are 0.258, 0.637, and 0.795. For transition dipoles, the RMSEs for sTDAxTB, Chl-xTB, and PBE0/Def2-SVP are 0.843, 0.267, and 0.172 a.u., respectively. The R2 values are 0.151, 0.600, and 0.919. The similarity in these error statistics between Chl-xTB and PBE0/Def2-SVP reiterates Chl-xTB\u2019s ability to replicate the performance of the training method. By contrast, the precision and accuracy of sTDA-xTB are noticeably poorer. This is a result of optimizing the Chl-xTB parameters for a more specific problem.\nBy taking such a targeted approach to parameterization, ChlxTB overcomes the usual compromise between accuracy and computational cost. For the bacteriochlorophyll a geometries investigated in Fig. 1, the average times taken for a single CAM-B3LYP or PBE0 TD-DFT calculation were 1852 and 1293 s, respectively, using Gaussian1673 on 2.4 GHz Intel E5-2680 v4 CPUs. sTDA-xTB provides a significant computational advantage, with an average time for each monomer of 5.11 s on a 2019 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro. By neglecting almost all elements of the A matrix in Eq. (7),\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\nFIG. 1.

The distribution of absolute errors in the Chl-xTB values is displayed as a gray histogram in the insets, with a fitted normal distribution overlaid in red. Panels (c) and (d) compare Chl-xTB, PBE0/Def2SVP TD-DFT, PBE0/Def2-SVP \u0394-SCF, and sTDA-xTB to a CAM-B3LYP/Def2SVP TD-DFT reference. Perfect correlation (y = x) is indicated by a black line in all panels.\nChl-xTB (on the same desktop machine) gives another order of magnitude speedup with an average runtime of 0.57 s.\nA similar level of speed and accuracy could also be achieved using machine learning. However, these methods typically require a lot of training data. For example, the NN model for Qy transition energies in the FMO complex by H\u00e4se et al. was trained on 104 transition energies.44 By starting from a sensible electronic structure instead of machine learning architecture, bespoke semiempirical methods like Chl-xTB can be trained on much smaller datasets, requiring fewer, expensive high-level reference calculations.\nFigure 1 also illustrates the problem with using the \u0394-SCF approximation to full linear-response for LH2 bacteriochlorophylls. In both the transition energies and TDMs, the \u0394-SCF points split into two clusters. The smaller cluster of lower energies and transition dipoles are geometries where the excited state SCF solution collapsed to a state other than the Qy excited state. A number of other calculations, not represented in this figure, failed to converge altogether. We were unable to identify any systematic feature in BChl geometries that predict this collapse. Hence while \u0394-SCF transition energies can be accurate and can correlate well with TD-DFT, its instability would be problematic for calculating transition properties for a large volume of correlated structures.\nIn Fig. 2, Chl-xTB, PBE0, and CAM-B3LYP are used to calculate the change in transition energy and TDM magnitude associated with a vibrational mode that deforms the porphyrin ring. The chosen vibrational normal mode of BChl breaks the D4h symmetry of the porphyrin ring by elongating the NA\u2013NC axis and couples to the Qy transition. It is therefore expected to influence important spectral properties such as inhomogeneous line-broadening. Similar\ncalculations for other D4h symmetry-breaking modes, which either compress or bend the NA\u2013NC axis, are given in the supplementary material along with the normal mode vectors. As before, Chl-xTB reproduces the predictions of PBE0 extremely well, but there is a clear systematic shift in the Chl-xTB surface compared to CAMB3LYP. However, the shape and curvature of the surfaces are very similar, as can be seen from the fact that this shift remains relatively constant along the surface coordinates (top panel of Fig. 2). The ability of Chl-xTB to predict the correct shapes of these surfaces shows that is capable of capturing small relative differences in transition properties between different chromophore geometries, which are important for describing the dynamical properties of chromophores and chromophore networks.\nThe efficiency of Chl-xTB makes it a great candidate for modeling large biological complexes. A frequently used model that scales well with the number of chlorophyll sites in a complex is the Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian. This model Hamiltonian is constructed entirely from monomer transition properties and has the form\nH =\u2211 i \u03b5i +\u2211 i<j \u03bdij, (10)\nwhere \u03b5i are the on-site energies of monomer chlorophylls (i.e., the Qy transition energy) and \u03bdij the coupling elements between on-site excitations. In this study, we calculate \u03bdij as a Coulombic pointcharge interaction between transition charges,74\u201376 except in the case of sTDA-xTB calculations, where we use a point-dipole interaction between transition dipole vectors (since transition charges are not readily available from the sTDA-xTB code43).

Dimer geometries were taken from the LH2 protein complex. The TD-DFT reference calculations were performed using CAM-B3LYP/Def2SVP, since the PBE0 functional that Chl-xTB was trained to suffers from severe charge transfer artifacts that make it unsuitable for treating the full BChl dimer. To make the CAM-B3LYP reference calculations affordable, we replaced the phytyl tail with a hydrogen atom for each monomer. Chlorophyll monomers in the exciton models also used these truncated geometries. We do not expect this to affect the excited states as the transition is mainly localized in the frontier orbitals, which are strongly centered on the porphyrin head group. Comparing the transition energies calculated using CAM-B3LYP within the exciton model and as a single TDDFT calculation on the full dimer shows that the exciton model only introduces a small (although nonzero) amount of error. Any additional error in the dimer energies calculated using other methods is therefore a result of how well the underlying monomer properties are described, rather than a failure of the exciton framework.\nAs for BChl monomers, Chl-xTB closely reproduces PBE0/ Def2-SVP dimer transition energies for dimers within the exciton model. Compared to the full dimer CAM-B3LYP reference, PBE0/Def2-SVP within the exciton model has an RMSE of 0.149 eV and R2 of 0.752, while the Chl-xTB exciton model has an RMSE of 0.106 eV and R2 of 0.667. This is, again, significantly better than the semiempirical sTDA-xTB method, which has an RMSE of 0.502 eV and R2 of 0.395. The RMSE of the Chl-xTB exciton model compared to the PBE0 exciton model is 0.047 eV (R2 of 0.806). This is similar to the performance of Chl-xTB for describing monomer energies, despite the fact that dimer transition energies also depend on monomer transition dipole moments (via the coupling elements \u03bdij), for which we observed a larger error (see Fig. 1). In many cases,\nthe reason that uncertainty in the transition dipole moments (or transition charges) does not have a more detrimental effect on dimer transition energies is simply that pairs of BChl chromophores in different parts of the LH2 complex are well separated, and so the coupling between their excited states is weak. However, even for neighboring chromophores energetic asymmetry between the two monomer sites means that the weak coupling between excited states only slightly perturbs the exciton energies. The dimer transition energies are much more strongly influenced by fluctuations in BChl monomer geometries, which Chl-xTB captures extremely well. We attribute the better prediction of CAM-B3LYP transition energies from Chl-xTB exciton energies compared to PBE0 exciton energies to a coincidence in chosen BChl geometries.\nA major challenge of simulating and understanding biological systems, such as light harvesting antenna proteins, is that the behavior and properties of the key components (e.g., chromophores) are heavily influenced, even controlled, by their complex surroundings. For example, the minutely controlled shape of the protein pocket can force the chromophores to adopt particular geometries (which may be significantly different to the most favorable configurations in vacuum). Electrostatic interactions between the atoms of the protein and chromophore can also polarize the chromophores\u2019 wavefunction, altering the character and energy of its quantum states. Modeling these influences is, in itself, computationally demanding, adding yet more pressure to keep quantum chemical calculations on the region of interest (chromophores) as efficient as possible. Chl-xTB interfaces naturally with standard QM/MM approaches to multiscale modeling of complex systems, incorporating system\u2013environment interactions into the potential energy terms of the Fock matrix in the same way as any other meanfield electronic structure method. This is a considerable advantage over machine learning methods that would have to be retrained to describe these interactions with, in all probability, a considerable increase in the number of fitted parameters.\nJ.

Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-7\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\nFigure 4(a) shows simulated and experimental line shapes for the 450\u2013800 nm region of the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a in diethyl ether. These spectra were created by calculating the (Qy) transition energies for 2000 Chl a geometries sampled from\nan MD simulation with explicit solvent. Details of the MD simulation can be found in the supplementary material. The transition energies associated with each geometry were either calculated in vacuum (CAM-B3LYP, PBE0, and Chl-xTB spectra) or using a periodic point-charge embedding to represent the solvent (embedded Chl-xTB spectrum). The absorption intensity for each structure was given by Ik \u221d \u2223\u27e8\u03a80\u2223\u03b5\u0302 \u22c5 \u03bc\u2223\u03a81\u27e9\u2223, averaged over the direction of the electric field unit vector \u03b5\u0302 of the light. The embedded Chl-xTB spectrum is noticeably red-shifted compared to Chl-xTB in vacuum, bringing the peak frequency more in line with the experimental value. This is a reassuring confirmation that Chl-xTB behaves correctly within a QM/MM framework to describe solvent polarization of the Qy transition.\nFurthermore, the agreement between the peak frequencies predicted by Chl-xTB and PBE0 demonstrates that Chl-xTB is still able to produce TD-DFT level transition energies for chlorophyll geometries outside the LH2 conformational space that formed the training set. In addition, it appears to transfer well to other species of chlorophyll: despite being trained purely on BChl a geometries (from Rsp. Acidophilus), it is able to predict the spectrum of solvated Chl a (from Thermostichus vulcanus) to within the same level of error (compared to PBE0) expected from the BChl a test set in Fig. 1. The line shapes of the PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, and vacuum Chl-xTB spectra are all similar and slightly overestimate the width of the major Qy feature\u2014this may be due to the neglect of some inhomogeneous broadening effects that do not occur with single pigment spectra.77 Chl-xTB produces the widest peak (and therefore the shortest since we normalize the area under the peak). This reflects the fact that Chl-xTB slightly underestimates the variance in TDM magnitude across different geometries (see Fig. 1) and consequently overestimates the (ensemble-averaged) absorption intensity, which is particularly noticeable at the edges of the peak. However, this is a small effect. CAM-B3LYP picks up an additional, smaller, shorterwavelength peak, which lines up with a peak in the experimental spectrum assigned to Qy transitions but which is not reproduced by Chl-xTB. We attribute the lack of this secondary peak to the fact that Chl-xTB is trained to PBE0, which also does not show this peak.\nUsing the exciton framework [Eq. (10)] to capture the exciton states of the entire network of BChl chromophores, Chl-xTB\nJ. Chem.

In Fig. 4(b), as in all the referenced studies, the intensity of the B800 peak is underestimated when using an ab initio approach without fitting parameters\u2014line shapes closer to experiment can be achieved using modified Redfield theory, averaging exciton properties based on symmetry-selected bright states, or fitting to experimental data.15 The underprediction of B800 absorption intensities is usually attributed either to errors in the excited state method or to the lack of a sufficiently sophisticated treatment of the environment. Introducing a distance-dependent screening parameter,40 based on the dielectric constant of the protein, to damp the coupling between exciton states retrieves the correct splitting between the B800 and B850 peaks. We anticipate that better results could also be obtained by embedding the chromophore network in an explicit point-charge representation of the protein complex, as we have shown for solvated Chl a monomers. However, due to the cost of implementing point-charge embedding with a full exciton model including all the chromophores in LH2, we do not investigate it further here."

            "text": "The properties of chlorophyll chromophores in the LH2 complex are not static. Motion (e.g., vibrations) of the chromophores themselves and of the protein complex constantly changes the conformational energy of the chromophores, their interactions with each other, and their interactions with their protein environment, creating continual fluctuations in the excitonic energies of the chromophore network. These fluctuations drive relaxation processes, which lead to spectroscopic line-broadening and heavily influence the ability of the chromophore antenna network to efficiently transport energy.\nThis important environmental influence can be encapsulated in a single parameter called the spectral density, which describes the coupling between vibrations (of the chromophores and environment) and excitonic energies. Spectral densities are commonly defined as the half-sided Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of a time series for the property of interest (usually a specific energy). For example, the spectral density for a transition energy \u0394E is\nJ(\u03c9) = \u03b2\u03c9 \u03c0 \u222b\n\u221e\n0 dtC(t) cos(\u03c9t), (11)\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency and\nC(tj) = 1\nN \u2212 j N\u2212j \u2211 k=1 \u0394E(tj + tk)\u0394E(tk) (12)\nis the autocorrelation function in the time domain. The indices j, k label frames in the time series of \u0394E (usually a series of energies calculated along consecutive frames of a molecular dynamics trajectory) and N is the total number of frames. The prefactor \u03b2\u03c9\u03c0 in Eq. (11) is required to maintain detailed balance, with \u03b2 = 1kBT and T = 300 K.\nThe ability to capture coupling to vibrational modes of a particular frequency depends on the length (N) and frequency (1/(tk \u2212 tj)) of sampling across the time series. Specifically, the upper frequency limit is 12(tk\u2212tj) , while the lower limit is 1 2N . In order for the spectral density to cover high-frequency vibrations (e.g., vibrations of hydrogen bonds) as well as low-frequency vibrations (e.g., large-scale motion of the protein complex), transition energies have to be sampled over the long time scale of protein motion (10\u2013100 s of picoseconds) at a femtosecond or even sub-femtosecond resolution.\nWith current electronic structure methods and computing power, this is an almost prohibitively large volume of data to acquire. Consequently, most spectral densities calculated from MD trajectories only cover a small frequency range. Recent examples for bilin19 and Nile red chromophores28 (both smaller than bacteriochlorophyll), calculated at a TD-DFT level of theory (B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and B3LYP/cc-pVTZ for bilin chromophores and CAM-B3LYP/631G\u2217 for Nile red chromophores), sample high-frequency molecular motion with a sampling rate of 0.5 fs\u22121 but do not simulate beyond a few picoseconds (6 and 40 ps for bilin and Nile red simulations, respectively) and so cannot capture lower frequency modes. They nevertheless required months of GPU time. Switching to lower level electronic structure methods, such as ZINDO, gives access to longer time scales (Mallus et al. achieve 300 ps at 2 fs intervals40) but still remains too expensive to treat the entire exciton framework collectively. In the absence of affordable ab initio spectral densities, a popular alternative is to use experimentally parameterized model spectral densities,79\u201381 but even these can be difficult to obtain and only offer an approximate, coarse-grained picture.\nThe speed and accuracy of Chl-xTB, particularly in describing the relative excitation energies of closely related geometries (see Fig. 2), address this issue by making it feasible to sample transition energies over long time scales at high resolution. Using this method, it becomes possible to calculate spectral densities that cover not only a broader frequency range than was previously possible but also the exciton state energies of the entire LH2 antenna complex (rather than just the transition energies on individual chromophore sites). Figure 5 compares the spectral densities for the Qy transition energy of single B850 and B800 BChl chromophores, the transition energy of the second lowest energy exciton state of the LH2 complex (which has the highest average absorption over time69), and the interaction energy between neighboring chromophores in the B850 ring. All three spectral densities were calculated using Chl-xTB on geometries sampled every 2 fs along a 300 ps molecular dynamics trajectory for the LH2 protein complex embedded in a layer of lipid membrane and surrounding water solvent.15 Details of this simulation are given in the supplementary material. The calculated spectral densities cover a frequency range from 0.25 to 0.0017 fs\u22121.\nThe spectral density for single site Qy transition energies [Fig. 5(a)] reproduces both high- and low-frequency features identified in previous studies using higher-level methods. The peaks at 0.019, 0.040, 0.051, and 0.0525 fs\u22121 were also reported by Kleinekath\u00f6fer et al.40 although with differences in intensities on the order of meV. These differences could arise from a number of sources, including spectral leakage and the well-known problems associated with mismatch between the classical forcefield method\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-9\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\nand quantum excited state method.28 However, the qualitative presence of these peaks demonstrates that Chl-xTB is capable of identifying important frequencies in the spectral density.\nMany of the same peaks (e.g., at 00.19, 0.040, 0.50, and 0.525 fs\u22121) also appear in the spectral density for exciton energies [Fig. 5(b)], indicating that coupling of chlorophyll sites to the local vibrational environment still has a strong influence on exciton states (probably more than large-scale protein motions). Due to the differing scale of fluctuations in Qy transition energies and exciton transition energies, comparing the magnitudes of these features is not meaningful. The lack of additional features in the exciton state spectral density compared to the site spectral density implies that much of the environmental coupling is through intrinsic motions at chlorophyll sites, rather than through exciton coupling.\nThe spectral density for exciton coupling is the only one that shows evidence of large-scale protein motion. Figure 5(c) reveals one new cluster of peaks in the very low-frequency region. As there is no match for these features in the site spectral density, they most likely arise from large-scale protein motion rather than vibrations of the chlorophyll molecules themselves. Since the exciton coupling depends inversely on the distance between chromophores, a likely candidate is some form of ring breathing mode of the LH2 ring, which would periodically compress or extend the interchromophore distances. Interestingly, the absence of any equivalent feature in the exciton spectral density indicates that this fluctuation in the exciton coupling has no significant effect on the overall exciton energy.\nFluctuations in the local environment for each chromophore also influence the exciton coupling as evidenced by the second cluster of peaks around 0.048 fs. It is unclear how this affects exciton state energies as there are features in the same region of the chlorophyll site spectral density. However, the similar intensity of these peaks to the lower frequency peaks in the coupling spectral density suggests that these high-frequency fluctuations in the exciton coupling are also unlikely to have much effect on exciton transition energies."

            "heading": "IV. DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We have presented a protocol that can be used to generate system-specific methods for evaluating the transition properties of a target excited state of interest with TD-DFT level accuracy and semiempirical cost. We have demonstrated the use of this protocol by realizing a bespoke method, Chl-xTB, for describing the Qy transition of chlorophylls (specifically BChl a in LH2). Our protocol exploits the same structure and approximations as existing successful semiempirical approaches (sTDA-xTB and GFN1-xTB), with some additional simplifications, to achieve orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost compared to TD-DFT. However, by parameterizing to a single transition of a specific molecule (in contrast to the broad range of chemical systems described by sTDA-xTB and GFN1-xTB), we retain the high level of accuracy required to understand how the excited state properties of BChl (and interacting networks of BChls) are influenced by subtle changes in their geometry and interactions with their environment. The necessity of this targeted parameterization for achieving the desired level of accuracy is starkly apparent in the reduction of R2 values (measuring the correlation with reference calculations) that we observe for Chl-xTB compared to the same approach with unoptimized parameters or even to sTDA-xTB. Unlike a reduction in RMSE, this reduction in uncertainty could not be achieved by simply adjusting a lower-level calculation with an energy shift or fitted linear correction function. While targeted parameterization gives Chl-xTB a very specific application, the underlying physical model means it can be more easily extended or interfaced into larger multiscale simulations than machine learning models, which are strictly limited to describing the properties and situations they were trained for. Our protocol also makes far more efficient use of parameters than a typical ML model, requiring only a handful of constants that all have specific chemical meaning (compared to tens of thousands used in a supervised learning model such as the one in Ref. 44).\nThe balance that we achieve between high accuracy and low computational cost offers a critical advantage when calculating dynamical or ensemble-averaged properties that require excited state evaluations for large numbers of different configurations of a single molecular species (or several closely related species). The spectral densities that we calculate for exciton states in the LH2 complex are a prime example, since constructing them requires tens to hundreds of thousands of energy evaluations for networks of large biological molecules interacting with a complex environment. Chl-xTB makes it possible to accurately track fluctuations in the excitation energy over a sufficiently long time scale to detect the influence of low-frequency vibrational modes that are often overlooked.\nWe have shown that, while low-frequency vibrations of the LH2 protein alter the strength of coupling between the embedded BChl chromophores, they have very little effect on the energies of the exciton states, which are much more heavily influenced by fluctuations in the local environment of individual chromophores. This extends the observation made in previous work that the Qy excitation energy of individual chlorophyll sites remains essentially constant when intramolecular BChl vibrations are \u201cfrozen out\u201d (i.e., the BChl geometry is artificially fixed during a molecular dynamics simulation) to leave only the effect of large-scale protein motion.82\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 024107 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0132417 158, 024107-10\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:29:15\nAlthough we have shown that Chl-xTB does an excellent job of evaluating the small energetic fluctuations described by a spectral density, other aspects of the calculation may introduce some uncertainty into the shape of the spectral density (the magnitudes and frequencies of the peaks). It is well known that the mismatch between the quantum (or, in this case, semiempirical) potential energy surface (PES) used to calculate excitation energies and the classical PES underpinning the molecular dynamics leads to overestimation of the strength of coupling to high-frequency vibrations (i.e., the magnitudes of high-frequency peaks in the spectral density).81,83\u201385 In addition, the unnaturally symmetric starting structure for the MD (strongly based on the low energy crystal structure of LH2) may fail to trigger the large-scale ring breathing motions that we hoped to investigate. However, the presence of low-frequency peaks in the spectral density for exciton coupling provides some reassurance that the MD simulation did indeed include the protein motions of interest, while the complete absence of equivalent peaks in the spectral density for exciton energies is a clear qualitative indication of the unimportance of these types of motion that is unlikely to be changed by small quantitative inaccuracies.\nIt is maybe unsurprising that exciton energies are affected so little by these changes in exciton coupling. Exciton coupling in the LH2 complex is fairly weak (on the order of tens to hundreds of cm\u22121), particularly when compared with the variation in excitation energies of individual chromophores (around 1600\u20133200 cm\u22121). However, the concrete evidence that Fig. 5 provides for the unimportance of low-frequency, large-scale protein motion has important implications for future simulations of the LH2 complex. In the past, theoretical models of energy transport in LH2 have taken the expedient approach of only considering the (high-frequency) vibrational modes that couple to individual site excitation energies.40,79,86,87 Figure 5 provides justification for continuing to neglect the effect of (low-frequency) protein motions on interchromophore coupling (which is more expensive to model), without fear of overlooking important contributions to the exciton transport mechanism.\nIn modeling dynamical behavior or dynamical properties, Chl-xTB offers an important additional advantage beyond simply reducing the cost of single-point energy evaluations. Our choice to use GFN1-like xTB rather than sTDA-like xTB, and retain only the diagonal elements of the A matrix [Eq. (7)], makes it possible to derive analytic expressions for the gradients of excited state properties with respect to atomic geometry (which, for example, correspond to the forces that drive molecular motion). In combination with the exciton model used in Figs. 3\u20135, access to cheap gradients represents another step toward realizing ab initio simulations of exciton dynamics in large photosynthetic antenna complexes like LH2.\nIn this paper, we have focused primarily on modeling the properties of the bacteriochlorophyll a chromophores in the LH2 antenna protein complex. By only training to LH2 bacteriochlorophyll structures, which are constrained by protein binding pockets, the current form of Chl-xTB has the potential to misrepresent other geometries that would occur in different environments. Similarly, our training set does not include other types of chlorophyll. However, the similarity of absorption spectra predicted by Chl-xTB and PBE0 for chlorophyll a (from Thermostichus vulcanus) in diethyl ether [Fig. 4(a)] suggests that the narrow range of structures included in the training set does not prevent Chl-xTB from providing reasonable\npredictions for other chlorophyll structures, including chlorophylls from other species. This is most likely due to the localization of the Qy transition density around the porphyrin ring, which is consistent across chlorophyll species. Taking into account the functional groups around this center (which may require additional parameters), as well as diversifying the training set, may result in a method with improved performance over a broader range of applications. However, this should be approached with caution. As stated above, part of the strength of Chl-xTB is that training to a very specific transition preserves the accuracy of higher-level methods. Trying to represent too many different situations could risk washing out subtle features in the training set that are important for capturing the small changes in relative excitation energies that are necessary to describe properties like the spectral density. In particular, if the values of the target transition property are clustered in multiple, well-separated regions, minimization of the objective function will be dominated by features that differentiate clusters rather than features that capture variations within a cluster.\nThe general protocol employed to construct Chl-xTB can be applied to molecules other than chlorophyll and this is facilitated by our deliberate use of widely available computational tools in the parameterization workflow (the open-source GFN1-xTB implementation (Ref. 88) and the SLSQP optimization procedure, which is available in most standard statistical software packages, such as Python\u2019s SciPy). The approximation of a diagonally dominant A matrix used to derive transition energies limits the approach to transitions that are dominated by a single orbital excitation. While scaling the transition density can recover a limited amount of mixed-transition character, we would not expect transitions consisting of a mix of degenerate excitations to work well. However, transitions with single-excitation character are relevant to a number of interesting biological molecules. For example, both the S2 excited state in carotenoids and the Q band in bilins (two of the other important pigments in LH2 complexes) are almost entirely HOMO \u2192 LUMO transitions in character.89\u201392 In general, larger molecules that are too expensive to treat with TD-DFT (and therefore require a cheaper method) are often not symmetric enough to have much degeneracy, so are more likely to have transitions that would be suitable for describing with the type of protocol outlined here.\nAnother obvious extension of the Chl-xTB protocol is to retrain it to a different reference method, such as the long-range corrected hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP, although this may require changes to Eqs. (5) and (6) to account for bifurcating the Coulomb and exchange interactions into short- and long-range terms. Altering the formalism to reflect the structure of more complicated functionals would not preclude the approximations that make Chl-xTB fast and efficient. Thus we anticipate that, with only minor adjustments, the Chl-xTB protocol can be adapted to different levels of theory to suit the system of interest.\nThe flexibility of our protocol, of which Chl-xTB is an example, means that it could be extended to a wide range of other biological and synthetic light harvesting. As a complementary approach to semiempirical, ML, and high-level TD-DFT methods, this protocol should prove a valuable tool in investigating the dynamics and environmental influences of large biochromophore excited states that have previously stretched the limits of current computational capability.\nJ.
