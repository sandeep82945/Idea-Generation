    "abstractText": "We study the properties of the upper critical field of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals in a continuous model, which has a nodal-line on the kz = 0 plane. Using the semiclassical Green\u2019s function method, we calculate the upper critical field for the two limiting cases: the dirty limit with many impurities and the clean limit with few impurities. The results show the large anisotropy of the magnitude of the upper critical field and the unusual temperature dependence. The obtained results are compared with recent experimental data of PbTaSe2.",

            "text": "Theoretical analysis of anisotropic upper critical field of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals\nJunya Endo,1 Hiroyasu Matsuura,1 and Masao Ogata1, 2\n1Department of Physics, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan 2Trans-scale Quantum Science Institute, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan\n(Dated: March 3, 2023)\nWe study the properties of the upper critical field of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals in a continuous model, which has a nodal-line on the kz = 0 plane. Using the semiclassical Green\u2019s function method, we calculate the upper critical field for the two limiting cases: the dirty limit with many impurities and the clean limit with few impurities. The results show the large anisotropy of the magnitude of the upper critical field and the unusual temperature dependence. The obtained results are compared with recent experimental data of PbTaSe2.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the standard systems, electron bands avoid band crossing because of band repulsion. However, some symmetry protects the band crossing of the conduction and valence bands. Materials that exhibit such kind of non-accidental band crossings are called topological semimetals[1]. Three-dimensional topological semimetals are classified into two types according to the dimension of the crossing, i.e., whether the band crossing appears as a point (zero-dimensional) or as a line (one-dimensional). The former includes gapless Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Unusual phenomena such as anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect that occur in these systems have been vigorously studied both theoretically and experimentally[2\u2013 9]. Some of these phenomena, especially those common to the Dirac and Weyl semimetals, are due to their linear dispersion near the Fermi surface. On the other hand, semimetals with one-dimensional band crossing are called nodal-line semimetals[10\u201315]. Their band structure can be interpreted as Dirac points and Dirac cones aligned along a line[16]. Therefore, some features of the Dirac semimetals are inherited in the nodal-line semimetals. In addition, the nodal-line can be of various shapes. Therefore, the nodal-line semimetals are expected to have more degrees of freedom and richer physics than the Dirac and Weyl semimetals. In fact, they are known to induce peculiar behaviors in orbital magnetism and thermoelectric effect, for instance[17, 18].\nPbTaSe2 and SnTaS2 are proposed to be nodalline semimetals[19\u201323], which exhibit s-wave superconductivity[24\u201328]. Interestingly, the superconductivity of PbTaSe2 shows a large anisotropy and a peculiar temperature dependence of the upper critical field as follows[29]: (1) The upper critical field parallel to the ab plane is several times larger than that parallel to the c axis. (2) The upper critical field decreases linearly as the temperature increases when the field is parallel to the c axis. (3) The critical field increases slowly near the superconducting transition temperature. SnTaSe2 also exhibits similar properties to (1) and (3)[25]. It is known that the behavior of Hc2 is highly dependent on the structure of the Fermi surface. Therefore, we can\nexpect unconventional behavior of the upper critical field originating from the peculiar shape of the Fermi surface of nodal-line semimetals.\nIn this paper, we theoretically study the upper critical field of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals. The quasi-classical Green\u2019s functions allow the Gor\u2019kov equations to be rewritten in simpler forms, such as the Eilenberger equations and the Usadel equations[30\u201332]. These equations make it possible to obtain the upper critical field numerically[33, 34]. Using these methods, we clarify the anisotropy and the temperature dependence of the upper critical field in the two cases: the dirty limit and the clean limit. We will show that the obtained results are consistent with the above experimental results (1)-(3)."

However, in the following, we investigate a simple model of a circular nodal-line semimetal as a first step and find the peculiarity of the upper critical field (Hc2) in this model. We believe that this model sufficiently captures the essence of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals.\nWe use the following simple effective model Hamiltonian describing the nodal-line semimetal:\nH = H0 +H \u2032, (1)\nwhere H0 is the kinetic energy Hamiltonian and H \u2032 is the two-body attractive interaction Hamiltonian. We assume that H0 is given by\nH0(k) =\n( a1 ( k2\u22a5 \u2212m2 ) bkz\nbkz \u2212a2 ( k2\u22a5 \u2212m2 )) , (2) where k2\u22a5 = k 2 x + k 2 y, kx, ky, and kz represent dimensionless wave numbers, a1, a2, and b are constants and m is a dimensionless constant.

(3) with a2/a1 = b/a1 = 1.0 and m = 1.0 in the cases of kz = 0 and kz = 0.5. The band crossing (nodal-line) appears when kz = 0. An example of the Fermi energy level, \u03b5F is shown by the red dotted line. When kz = 0, the Fermi surface is composed of two circles with radii k\u22a5 = k min\n\u22a5 and k\nmax\n\u22a5 ,\nwhich are shown by the red circles. The inset shows the Fermi surface for \u03b5F/a1 = 0.2. (b) Band dispersion of with a2/a1 = 3.0, b/a1 = 1.0, and m = 3.0 in the cases of kz = 0 and kz = 4.0.

Two branches A and B are divided by the red circle representing k\u22a5 = m when |kz| = \u03b5F/b. k\u22a5 satisfies kmin\u22a5 \u2264 k\u22a5 \u2264 m for the branch A and m \u2264 k\u22a5 \u2264 kmax\u22a5 for the branch B. The green dotted lines correspond to k\u22a5 = k min \u22a5 and k\u22a5 = k max \u22a5 .\ndispersion is obtained as\nE\u00b1(k) = a1 \u2212 a2\n2 (k2\u22a5 \u2212m2)\n\u00b1\n\u221a( a1 + a2\n2\n)2 (k2\u22a5 \u2212m2) 2 + b2k2z . (3)\nE+ and E\u2212 bands intersect when kz = 0, and their intersection forms a circular nodal-line in the kx-ky plane of kz = 0. For a certain Fermi energy \u03b5F > 0 (the red dotted line of Fig. 1), the corresponding Fermi surface has a doughnut-like structure as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a). In the kx-ky (kz = 0), this Fermi surface is composed of two circles with radii k\u22a5 = k min \u22a5 and kmax\u22a5 , which are shown by the red circles in Fig. 1(a).\n(kmin\u22a5 = \u221a m2 \u2212 \u03b5F/a2 and kmax\u22a5 = \u221a m2 + \u03b5F/a1.) As |kz| increases, the two circles shrink and finally merge at k\u22a5 = m when |kz| = \u03b5F/b. Figure 1(b) shows the band dispersion at kz = 0, 4.0 for a2/a1 = 3.0, b/a1 = 1.0, and m = 3.0. In this parameter set, we find the asymmetric band dispersion against the zero energy line. Therefore, we call the parameter settings for Fig. 1(a) (Fig. 1(b)) the symmetric (asymmetric) model."

The two branches meet on the line k\u22a5 = m when |kz| = \u03b5F/b. We assume that the superconductivity occurs in the very vicinity of each branch of the Fermi surface. To take account of the electronic states on the Fermi surface, we use the semiclassical Green\u2019s functions defined by [30, 35]\ng\u030c\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n) =\n( g\u0302\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n) f\u0302 \u03b1(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n)\nf\u0302\u03b1\u2020(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n) g\u0302 \u03b1(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n) ) = \u222b d\u03bek \u03c0 \u03c1\u030cz \u222b d\u03c4 \u222b dr ei\u03c9n(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4 \u2032)e\u2212ik \u03b1 F \u00b7r\n\u00d7\n( G\u0302\u03b1(r1, \u03c4 ; r2, \u03c4 \u2032) F\u0302\u03b1(r1, \u03c4 ; r2, \u03c4 \u2032)\nF\u0302\u03b1\u2020(r1, \u03c4 ; r2, \u03c4 \u2032) \u02c6\u0303G\u03b1(r1, \u03c4 ; r2, \u03c4 \u2032)\n) ,\n(4)\nwhere \u03b1 represents the branch A or B, \u03c1\u030cz = diag(1\u0302,\u22121\u0302), R = (r1 + r2)/2 is the center of mass coordinate, r = r1 \u2212 r2 is the relative coordinate, \u03bek = \u03b5k \u2212 \u00b5 is the energy measured from the chemical potential, \u03c4 represents the imaginary time, and \u03c9n = (2n + 1)\u03c0kBT is the fermionic Matsubara frequency. Here, G\u0302\u03b1 and F\u0302\u03b1 are the normal and anomalous Green\u2019s functions in the form of 2 \u00d7 2 matrix in the Nambu-Gor\u2019kov space. In addition, G\u0303 is defined as \u2212 \u2329 \u03c8\u2020\u03c8 \u232a , similar to the normal\n3 Green\u2019s function. The 4 \u00d7 4 matrix g\u030c\u03b1 is normalized as (g\u030c\u03b1)2 = \u22121\u030c.\nConsidering the equation of motion for G\u0302\u03b1 and F\u0302\u03b1 in the standard mean-field approximation, we can obtain the equation of motion for the quasi-classical Green\u2019s function g\u030c\u03b1[30, 31]. We assume that the coherence length is much larger than the Fermi wavelength near the upper critical field Hc2, and then the spatial variation of the gap function is small. In fact, since Hc2 \u223c 1000 Oe and the lattice constant in PbTaSe2 discussed in Section V is approximately 0.3 nm, the product of coherence length and Fermi wave number is estimated to be kF \u03be \u223c kF \u221a h\u0304\u03c6/2|e|Hc2 \u223c 200 1, which justifies our assumption.

Here, AR is the vector potential at R, e < 0 is the electron charge, v\u03b1k\u03b1F is the Fermi velocity at k\u03b1F, and [ , ] represents the commutation relation. The 4 \u00d7 4 matrix \u03a3\u030c represents the self-energy, and \u2206\u030c represents the gap function, which satisfies\n\u2206\u030c\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F) =\n( 0 \u2206\u0302\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F)(\n\u2206\u0302\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F) )\u2217\n0\n) . (6)\nThe gap equation is\n\u2206\u0302\u03b1 = 2\u03c0T \u03c9D\u2211 \u03c9n>0 \u2211 \u03b2 \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2329 f\u0302\u03b2 ( R,k\u03b2F; i\u03c9n )\u232a k\u03b2F , (7)\nwhere \u03c9D is the Debye frequency, and \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u3009k\u03b1F represents the average over the Fermi surface of the corresponding branch. \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 are coupling constants defined by N0V\u03b1\u03b2 where N0 is the total density of states and V\u03b1\u03b2 is the attractive interaction between \u03b1 and \u03b2 branches. The inter-branch coupling is also (\u03b1 6= \u03b2) included in this formalism. In the following, to estimate the upper critical field, Hc2, we introduce the two limits: the dirty limit and the clean limit.\nFor the case of dirty limit, assuming that the quasiclassical Green\u2019s function is almost isotropic and introducing the anisotropy by expanding to the first order of the Fermi velocity in eq. (5), f\u0302\u03b1 is given by solving the following equation called Usadel equation[32]:(\n2\u03c9n \u2212 \u2211 \u00b5,\u03bd D\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd\u03a0\u00b5\u03a0\u03bd ) f\u0302\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F; i\u03c9n) = 2\u2206\u0302 \u03b1, (8)\nwhereD\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd \u221d \u2329 v\u03b1\u00b5v \u03b1 \u03bd \u232a k\u03b1F are the intra-band diffusivity tensors, \u03a0 = \u2207 + 2\u03c0iA/\u03c6 is the covariant derivative operator, where \u03c6 is the magnetic flux quantum. We take the Landau gauge A = Hx\u00b5e\u03bd (\u00b5 6= \u03bd), e.g., \u00b5 = x and\n\u03bd = y if the magnetic field is oriented in the z direction. Assuming f\u0302\u03b1 \u221d \u2206\u0302\u03b1, we obtain f\u0302\u03b1 = \u2206\u0302\u03b1/(\u03c9n +KD\u03b1), with K = \u03c0H/\u03c6, and D\u03b1 = \u221a D\u03b1\u00b5\u00b5D \u03b1 \u03bd\u03bd . Here, we have assumed D\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb = 0 when \u03ba 6= \u03bb. As mentioned in the introduction, we study the upper critical field of s-wave superconductivity in the nodal-line semimetals. Therefore, we assume\n\u2206\u0302\u03b1 =\n( 0 \u2206\u03b1\n\u2212\u2206\u03b1 0\n) . (9)\nThen, the gap equation eq. (7) together with eq. (8) can be calculated as\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b2 \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u2206 \u03b2 ( log 2\u03b3\u03c9D \u03c0T \u2212 U ( KD\u03b2 2\u03c0T )) , (10)\nwhere U(x) = \u03a8(x+ 1/2) \u2212 \u03a8(1/2), and \u03a8 is the digamma function. In the above calculation, we have used the equation \u2211\u03c9D \u03c9n>0 2\u03c0T/(\u03c9n +X) = log (2\u03b3\u03c9D/\u03c0T )\u2212U(X/2\u03c0T ) for X > 0. Using the matrix P\n(d) \u03b1\u03b2 = ( log (2\u03b3\u03c9D/\u03c0T )\u2212 U ( KD\u03b2/2\u03c0T )) \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , eq.\n(10) becomes\nP (d) \u03b1\u03b2 \u2206 \u03b2 = 0. (11)\nHere, (d) represents the dirty limit. To obtain a non-zero solution \u2206\u03b2 , the self-consistent equation is given by\ndetP (d) = 0. (12)\nIn the dirty limit, Hc2 is obtained by solving eq. (12). Next, we discuss the case of clean limit. Assuming \u03a3 kBTc, eq. (5) becomes[( i\u03c9n + evk\u03b1F \u00b7AR ) \u03c1\u030cz \u2212 \u2206\u030c\u03b1(R,k\u03b1F), g\u030c\u03b1(R,k \u03b1 F, i\u03c9n)\n] + ivk\u03b1F \u00b7 \u2207Rg\u030c \u03b1(R,k\u03b1F, i\u03c9n) = 0.\n(13)\nIn order to estimate the upper critical field Hc2 efficiently for the clean limit, we use an approximation introduced by Brandt, Pesch, and Tewordt (BPT) [36], which is a method to calculate the free energy of multiband superconductivity. The BPT approximation consists of the following three approximations : (1) The spatial variation of \u2206 forms an Abrikosov lattice. (2) The magnetic flux density B is spatially uniform. (3) The quasi-classical Green\u2019s function g\u0302\u03b1(R) is spatially uniform. These assumptions are valid when the external magnetic field is near the upper critical field. Using the BPT approximation, the free energy of the multiband s-wave superconductor is generally given as\n\u2126 = (B \u2212H)2\n8\u03c0 + \u2211 \u03b1\u03b2 ( \u03c1(0),\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c1\u03b1(T,B)\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ) (\u2206\u03b1) \u2217 \u2206\u03b2 +O ( |\u2206|4 ) ,\n(14)\n4 Symmetric model\nFIG. 2: Temperature dependence of the upper critical field for the symmetric model with a1 = a2 = b = m = 1.0.

Here, we set the coupling constants as \u03bbAA = 1.0, \u03bbBB = 0.8, \u03bbBA = 0.2, and \u03bbAB = 0.2, and the Fermi energy \u03b5F = 0.1. As shown below, the obtained results are almost independent of the values of these coupling constants.

Experimental data on the upper critical field in PbTaSe2[29] are also included for comparison.\nparallel to the plane (xy plane) in which the nodal-line resides, is denoted by Hsymc2,z and H sym c2,x .\nIn the same manner, Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field for the asymmetric model with a2/a1 = 3.0, b/a1 = 1.0, and m = 3.0 in the dirty limit (dotted lines) and the clean limit (dashed lines).\nThere are several characteristic behaviors of Hc2. (1) The critical field is larger when the direction of the external magnetic field is in the x direction, i.e., when the magnetic field is parallel to the nodal-line (orange lines). This trend is common for both the clean limit and the dirty limit. On the other hand, in the asymmetric model, the magnitude of the anisotropy is approximately three times larger than in the symmetric model. These behaviors are mainly due to the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity, as discussed later.\n(2) The temperature dependence of Hc2,z in the clean limit is different from the other cases. At low temperatures Hc2,z varies linearly, which is unusual in the s-wave superconductivity.\n(3) In the asymmetric case (Fig. 3), Hc2 has a convex downward region, which does not appear in the symmetric model. In other words, Hc2 increases slowly with decreasing temperature. This is a property common to both clean and dirty limits.\nNote that the above results are for the case with \u03b5F/a1 = 0.1. Although we do not show the results, we find that the behaviors of Hc2 do not change unless \u03b5F changes significantly. We think that the above unconventional properties are mostly originating from the shape of the Fermi surface of the nodal-line as in Fig. 1, so the band crossing is not necessarily required. Furthermore, our numerical calculations show that the magnitude of coupling between branches has little effect on the qualitative behavior. In fact, changing the ratio \u03bbAB/\u03bbAA\n5 or \u03bbBA/\u03bbAA from 0 to 1 changes the upper critical field by less than 10 percent. From this, we conclude that the qualitative behavior remains unchanged even if we change the coupling constant.\nc2,z at T = 0.\nV. ANALYSIS OF THE BEHAVIORS OF Hc2 AND COMPARISON WITH THE EXPERIMENTS\nIn what follows, we identify the origins of features (1)- (3), respectively.\n(1) The anisotropy of the upper critical field Hc2,x/Hc2,z is proportional to the ratio \u221a \u3008v2x\u3009 / \u3008v2z\u3009.\nIn fact, the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity is\u221a \u3008v2x\u3009 / \u3008v2z\u3009 ' 1.66 for the symmetric model. This magnitude corresponds to the magnitude of the anisotropy of Hc2 as shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Figure 3, the anisotropy is more pronounced in the asymmetric model. This will be because m is three times larger than the symmetric model. As m increases, the Fermi velocity in the x direction increases, and consequently, the critical field in the x direction also increases. In fact,\u221a \u3008v2x\u3009 / \u3008v2z\u3009 ' 7.12 for the asymmetric model. To see this more in detail, we show m dependence of the ratio Hasymc2,x /H asym c2,z in Figure 4. We find that as m increases, the ratio Hasymc2,x /H asym c2,z also increases, irrespective of the dirty and clean limit. Thus, the anisotropy of the critical field or the Fermi surface is mainly determined by the parameter m. It increases linearly with m in the dirty limit, while it increases gradually in the clean limit. This will be due to the fact that Hc2,z in the clean limit is larger than Hc2,z in the dirty limit in the low temperature region because of the linear temperature dependence of Hc2,z as discussed in (2) below.\n(2) The linear-T dependence of Hc2,z in the clean limit with the symmetric model (blue dashed line in Fig. 2)\nis understood as follows. In the s-wave superconductivity, we can prove that dHc2/dT = 0 at T \u2192 0 in generic cases. This holds when we can assume \u039bT/v\u22a5 is small, where \u039b = (2|e|B)\u22121/2 and v\u22a5 is the Fermi velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field. In a simple spherical Fermi surface, there are only two points where v\u22a5 is zero. In the average over the Fermi surface, these points do not affect the result dHc2/dT |T=0 = 0. However, in the present nodal-line model, when the magnetic field is applied along the z direction, the set of points on the Fermi surface where v\u22a5 is zero forms lines parallel to the nodal line. Therefore, the temperature region, in which the assumption that \u039bT/v\u22a5 is sufficiently small does not hold, is wider than in a simple Fermi surface. As a result, the critical field shows a linear temperature dependence down to low temperatures (see some details in Appendix). On the other hand, the linear temperature dependence does not appear in the dirty limit. This difference may be due to the fact that the anisotropy is weakened by impurity scattering in the dirty limit, which makes it difficult to see the anisotropy that appears in the clean limit. In the asymmetric model (Fig. 3), similar behaviors are observed. However, it seems that the linear temperature region in Hc2,x is larger than in the symmetric case. This will be because the curvature of the Fermi surface increases with the increase of m, and the region of small v\u22a5 becomes larger.\n(3) We also found that the introduction of asymmetry with respect to the nodal-line plane changes the behavior of the critical field near the transition temperature. This could be explained by the difference in Fermi velocities between the branches. Indeed, numerical calculations with dirty limit show that the value of d2Hc2/dT 2 at T = Tc is negative when 0.63 < D A/DB < 1.6 and positive otherwise. In the symmetry model, DA/DB ' 0.81 (when the magnetic field is in the z direction) and DA/DB ' 0.91 (when the magnetic field is in the x direction) for the symmetric model, DA/DB ' 8.87 (z direction) and DA/DB ' 3.97 (x direction) for the asymmetric model. Thus, the difference in the Fermi velocity between the branches produces Hc2 that is convex downward.\nExperimental results of PbTaSe2[29] are also shown in the figure 3 (solid lines with circles), which we think are consistent with the present theoretical results in the following points.\n(1) The experimental data show a large anisotropy in Hc2. Specifically, Hc2 is larger when the magnetic field is parallel to the nodal-line. Such anisotropy is consistent with the behavior of our asymmetric model.\n(2) Although there is no experimental data at low temperatures when the field is perpendicular to the nodalline (i.e., Hc2,z, solid blue circles in Fig. 3), it seems that Hc2,z is linear near T = 0. This behavior is consistent with our model. For Hc2,x, the experimental data (solid orange circles in Fig. 3) also show the linear behavior at low temperatures, which differs from that predicted by the present theory. However, we think that this point can\n6 be understood in the framework of the present theory if we extend the theory as follows. In this paper, we considered a situation in which the nodal-line is completely on a plane perpendicular to some reciprocal lattice vector (z-axis). However, in actual materials, there exists a tilt and the nodal-line lies on a plane not perfectly perpendicular to some reciprocal lattice vector. Due to this tilt, even when the magnetic field is in the x direction, the region where v\u22a5 is zero is not zero-dimensional but one-dimensional. We speculate that this causes the linearity of the upper critical field at low temperatures. To fit the experimental results completely, numerical methods with a material-dependent model Hamiltonian will be necessary.\n(3) The experimental data have convex downward behavior near the transition temperature, which is unusual for Hc2. This tendency is consistent with the present theory."

            "text": "In this paper, we analyzed the temperature and Fermi energy dependence of the upper critical field for a typical model of s-wave nodal-line superconductors using the method of semiclassical Green\u2019s functions. The above analysis was performed for two different limits, the dirty limit with many impurities and the clean limit with few impurities. As a result of the calculations, the following characteristics were found for the upper critical magnetic field: (1) the anisotropy in the direction of the magnetic field, (2) linear behavior of Hc2,z at low temperatures, and (3) convex downward behavior near the critical temperature. The above behaviors are different from those of ordinal s-wave superconductors but are consistent with those of experimental data of nodal-line superconductors. This suggests that the model used in this study, as well as the semiclassical Green\u2019s function, is useful in the analy-\nsis of superconductivity in nodal-line semimetals."

            "text": "First, we show the proof of dHc2/dT = 0 near T = 0 in the clean limit. Considering the total derivative of eq. (16), we obtain\n\u2211 \u03b1 N\u03b1 \u2329 16\u039b2 v2\u22a5 T Tc dT + ( \u22128\u039b 2 v2\u22a5 T 2 T 2c + 3 ) dB B \u232a k\u03b1F = 0.\n(A1) Here, assuming \u039bT/v\u22a5 is small, we performed a Taylor expansion in terms of \u039bT/v\u22a5. It is clear that with the limit of T \u2192 0, dB must approach zero. Therefore, we can conclude dHc2/dT = 0.\nHowever, when v\u22a5 is small, even if the temperature is low enough, the condition that \u039bT/v\u22a5 is small does not hold. In such a case, the above calculation is not valid. In fact, assuming \u039bT/v\u22a5 is large, we obtain dHc2/dT ' \u221216\u03c02T 2/7\u03b6(3)|e|v2\u22a5. v\u22a5 varies according to its position on the Fermi surface, and (A1) includes averaging over the Fermi surface. Therefore, this argument is not rigorous. However, we can at least conclude that the temperature region, in which the gradient dHc2/dT is small, becomes narrower when the region, in which v\u22a5 is small becomes larger. This explains the linear-T dependence of Hc2,z near T = 0 in the clean limit.\n[1] M. Z. Hasan and C. L. Kane, Rev. Mod. Phys. 82, 3045 (2010). [2] S. Murakami, New Journal of Physics 9, 356 (2007).
