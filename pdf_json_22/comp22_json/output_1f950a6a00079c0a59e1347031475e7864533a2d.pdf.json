    "abstractText": "As a key pillar technology for the future 6G networks, terahertz (THz) communication can provide high-capacity transmissions, but suffers from severe propagation loss and lineof-sight (LoS) blockage that limits the network coverage. Narrow beams are required to compensate for the loss, but they in turn bring in beam misalignment challenge that degrades the THz network performance. The high sensing accuracy of THz signals enables integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology to assist the LoS blockage and user mobility-induced beam misalignment, enhancing THz network coverage. In line with the 5G beam management, we propose a joint synchronization signal block (SSB) and reference signal (RS)-based sensing (JSRS) scheme to predict the need for beam switches, and thus prevent beam misalignment. We further design an optimal sensing signal pattern that minimizes beam misalignment with fixed sensing resources, which reveals design insights into the time-to-frequency allocation. We derive expressions for the coverage probability and spatial throughput, which provide instructions on the ISAC-THz network deployment and further enable evaluations for the sensing benefit in THz networks. Numerical results show that the JSRS scheme is effective and highly compatible with the 5G air interface. Averaged in tested urban use cases, JSRS achieves near-ideal performance and reduces around 80% of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by about 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability.",

INTRODUCTION\nTowards the realization of smart cities, the future 6G foresees the implementation of authentic digital twin representation of the physical world, supporting novel use cases, including but not limited to vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and smart factories [1]. The ultra-wide terahertz (THz) band that can support massive connections with up to terabit per second (Tbps) data rate has come into vision [2].\nHowever, THz-band transmissions suffer from limited signal power, high propagation loss and severe molecular absorp-\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant U21B2014 and 62271121.

Highly directional beams are exploited to enhance the signal power, but they bring in narrow beam alignment challenges [4]. Furthermore, the THz link is sensitive to line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, meaning objects larger than several wavelengths can interrupt the connection [5], [6]. Frequent beam switches and severe beam misalignment cause link interruption and non-negligible latency for link reconstruction, which severely degrades the communication quality, including the coverage probability and throughput [7], [8]. Thus, it is essential to develop an efficient beam alignment scheme for THz networks [9], [10].\nSensing has been exploited for high-precise positioning, which has the potential to be used to provide assistance for beam alignment [11]. The ultra-high THz signals intrinsic high-resolution sensing, opening up unprecedented opportunities to realize integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in THz networks [12]. It allows for joint sensing and communication using unified waveform and integrated hardware [13]. Compared to the traditional sensor-aided solutions, ISAC uses shared resources that can achieve low latency and high spectral efficiency with reduced cost [14]. The state-of-theart THz band ISAC prototypes have realized millimetrelevel imaging resolution, showing its feasibility to assist THz communications [15]. However, from the ISAC prototype to the implementation of sensing-aided THz communications, the following challenges need to be addressed: 1) The design of a sensing-aided beam alignment scheme that is compatible with the current 5G beam management procedure; 2) The flexible sensing signal configuration that efficiently uses the sensing resources in varying networks; 3) Network-level performance analysis that captures the enhancement provided by the sensing assistance.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenges, many foundational works have contributed to the link-level ISAC-THz techniques. Work [16]\u2013[20] focus on sensing information extraction and ISAC waveform design. For candidate standard signal selection, the standard signals are preferred to be sensing candidates to realize better compatibility with the 5G air interface. Theoretically, work [21] compares the feasibility of using the channel estimation signals, synchronization signal block (SSB), demodulation reference signals (DMRS) and positioning reference signals (PRS) for sensing. As pilot signals, they shine with intrinsic auto-correlation and anti-noise properties that improve localization accuracy [22]. Work [23] develops RS-based angle and time estimation algorithms and evaluates the superiority of using reference signals (RSs) over other standard signals for localization in V2X networks. Work [22]\n2 provides frame structure design for PRS-based sensing signal configuration to perform velocity estimation. However, the sensing-aided communication scheme that benefits networklevel performance has not been well investigated.\nTill now, few works have been done to bridge the gap from the link level to the network level, covering areas from the scheme design, sensing signal configuration to performance evaluation. As a preliminary discussion on the scheme design, our previous work [24] proposes an SSB-based sensing method to assist the THz/mmWave network beam alignment. However, its benefits on network coverage and throughput have not been analysed. Considering the cost and benefit of sensing, work [25] designs a networking-based ISAC hardware testbed that reveals the resource allocation trade-off between communication and sensing functions. However, it does not provide an effective scheme to configure the sensing signals, and no sensing-aided communication scheme has been considered.\nFor network performance analysis, stochastic geometry (SG) is a well-investigated tool that has been widely used to model networks ranging up to THz bands. Key performance indicators ranging from interference, coverage probability to spatial throughput can be modelled using the basic theories developed in [26]\u2013[28]. The interference and coverage probability is discussed in works [29], [30], and the spatial throughput and spectral efficiency are analysed in [31], [32]. Recently, SG has also been exploited for ISAC network modelling. Work [33] analyses the maximum radar detection range and throughput for the coexisting ISAC network. Work [32] develops a mathematical framework that characterizes the coverage and ergodic capacity of ISAC-based networks, but the coverage enhancement by introducing sensing into the system has not been analysed. Moreover, these works for ISAC are for mmWave and below bands. For the THz network with ISAC, the unique THz propagation features, LoS blockage and mobility effects need to be considered. There still remain blanks for the analysis on the ISAC benefit in THz network coverage and throughput.\nTo solve the beam misalignment challenge in THz networks, from the network level, we propose an ISAC-based beam alignment approach that enhances the network coverage, which is in line with the 5G standard. The main contributions are summarised as follows.\n1) We propose a joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme to reduce the LoS blockage and user mobility-induced beam misalignment in THz networks, which is in line with the 5G beam management procedure. JSRS exploits the 5Gspecified SSBs to detect blockages and the RSs for user tracking. Different from the traditional detect-and-correct method, sensing-based JSRS enables a predict-and-prevent procedure that provides early interventions for timely beam switches, avoiding beam misalignment.\n2) Based on the 5G frame structure, we provide an optimal sensing signal pattern design which minimizes beam misalignment with a given number of sensing resources. Specifically, we optimize the time-to-frequency allocation ratio that minimises the sensing error-induced beam misalignment, and the insert spacings to satisfy the sensing range and resolution requirements. We reveal the design trade-offs in the time-\nto-frequency allocation ratio affected by the beamwidth and frequency bands (see Theorem 1).\n3) From the network level, we then provide expressions for the coverage probability and spatial throughput based on stochastic geometry. They enable evaluations on the benefit of introducing sensing into THz networks and provide instructions for the ISAC-THz network deployment that achieves wider coverage and higher spatial throughput, including the design of network density, beamwidth and sensing signal configuration (see Theorem 2).\n4) Based on the numerical analyses, we show the effectiveness of the JSRS scheme and its high compatibility with the 5G air interface. In tested urban V2X use cases, the JSRS scheme averagely reduces the beam misalignment by 80%, increasing the coverage probability by 75%, compared to that of the 5G-ability networks. Besides, the JSRS scheme achieves near-ideal performance, showing that the proposed sensing signal configuration effectively reduces the estimation error. JSRS exploited the high angular resolution of narrow beams to enhance the distance estimation, and thus turn the disadvantage of sharp beams into benefits, allowing the THz network to use narrower beams to enhance coverage and throughput.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec.II introduces the ISAC-THz network model and the challenge of THz beam alignment. Sec.III proposes the JSRS scheme for THz beam alignment and analyses its feasibility. Sec.IV provides a time-frequency sensing signal pattern design and evaluates the cost of sensing. The analytical coverage probability and throughput expressions for the ISAC-THz network are given in Sec.V. Numerical results are presented in Sec.VI. Conclusions are drawn in Sec.VII. The definitions of frequently used symbols are summarized in Table I."

            "text": "We focus on the outdoor applications of the ISAC-THz networks, considering the impact of the macro-scale movement and LoS blockage. Based on the well-developed stochastic geometry, the base stations (BSs), mobile terminals (MTs) and blockers are independently distributed following Poisson point process (PPP) distribution with intensity \u03bbB , \u03bbM , \u03bbS [26]. The nodes are considered as round dots with the same radius rB. Noticing the LoS-blockage effect at the THz band, the BSs and MTs are also considered as potential blockers. Directional antennas are used at both the BSs and MTs to enhance the signal power. The beam number at the BS and MT sides are nb, nm, and the corresponding beamwidth are \u03b8b = 2\u03c0/(nb), \u03b8m = 2\u03c0/(nm) respectively. Considering the widely used maximum receiver power (MRP) scheme, the\nMT prefers to connect to the closest available BS, forming a Poisson-Voronoi cell tessellation as plotted in Fig.1 [28]. The typical MT moves along a randomly oriented straight line with a speed of v, drawn by the red line. The beam switch points are the intersections of the beam boundary and user trajectory.\nThis paper is built based on the 5G-specified beam management procedure. The key tasks include the establishment of suitable beam pair before data transmission, and the beam adjustment to maintain the connection during user movement [36]. Untimely beam switch results in unmatched beam pair on the MT and BS sides, defined as beam misalignment [7]. To handle such beam failures, the 5G new radio (NR) specifies measurement-based beam reselection to recover the beams [36]. The identification of a new candidate beam relies on the measurement of the periodically transmitted SSBs, each of which corresponds to a specific beam and indicates its connectivity. Next, the candidate beam-pair is determined at the BS side based on the SSB measurement reported by the user [7]. Thus, the user needs to receive at least one set of SSBs during current beam coverage for new candidatebeam selection, meaning missed reception of SSBs causes beam misalignment. The following two major causes of beam misalignment are considered in this paper, as plotted in Fig.1.\n1) Blockage-Induced Misalignment: As in Fig.1(a), considering the THz LoS-sensitive feature, the blockage on the LoS link causes a blind zone that interrupts the reception of SSBs.\n2) Mobility-Induced Misalignment: As in Fig.1(b), since the narrow beamwidth shortens single beam coverage, fastmoving users are unable to receive the scheduled SSBs before reaching the beam boundaries. In other words, the duration within one beam coverage is shorter than the SSB period.\nTherefore, an efficient beam alignment scheme in line with 5G-specified beam management is needed. Thanks to the high sensing accuracy of THz signals, sensing can be exploited to assist THz beam alignment.\n4 (c) (a) (b) Stage 2 JSRS-aided beam/cell switch Stage 3 Signal pattern adjustment Stage 1 Signal pattern configuration Exist blockage? b B v n , b nSSB configuration: BS1 uses SSBs to detect user and blockage Total resource for RSs: RSN Determine optimal time-frequency allocation using Theorem 1, ,U V BS1 utilizes RSs to track MT0, estimate its speed v BS1 informs MT0 and the closest available BS2 BS2 transmits an additional SSB burst to assist cell switch BS1 transmit additional SSB burst to assist beam switch Receive report?

            "text": "In this section, we first introduce the 5G-evolved ISACframe structure as a basis. Based on the 5G beam management procedure, we propose a joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme to assist THz beam alignment. Different from the traditional detect-and-correct error method, the idea of JSRS follows a predict-and-prevent error procedure, that can avoid the occurrence of beam misalignment.\nA. 5G-Evolved ISAC-Frame Structure\nTo be compatible with the 5G air interface, the ISAC-frame structure is evolved from the 5G that has flexible numerology and the ability to support high-band communications.\nOne key waveform candidate for ISAC is the current dominant orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, which has excellent multiplexing capability and pilot-bearing symbols [37]. Using OFDM-based transmission, in the time domain, NR transmissions are organized into frames that are divided into slots. One slot consists of 14 OFDM symbols [36]. In the frequency domain, the resource is divided by subcarriers. Thus, the smallest physical resource defined in 5G NR is resource element (RE) that consists of one subcarrier during one OFDM symbol [36]. Evolved from 5G numerology to support THz communication, we adopt a subcarrier spacing of fscs = 1.92MHz and the OFDM symbol length as Tsym = 4.46\u00b5s, suggested by [38], [39].\nThe 5G-evolved ISAC-frame structure is plotted in Fig.2(a). According to 3GPP standard [36], one SSB takes up 4 symbols\nin time and 240 subcarriers in frequency, plotted as the blue blocks. The default SSB period is \u03c4 = 20ms. NR specifies a beam-swept and time-multiplexed transmission of SSBs. A set of SSBs representing different beam directions is referred to as SSB burst. Also, to support low-latency use cases, instead of fixing the transmission at the beginning of a slot, NR allows for immediate transmission that starts within a slot occupying any necessary symbols, referred to as mini-slot transmission [36]. Therefore, aside from the scheduled SSB burst, it is possible to utilize the mini-slots for immediate transmission of the SSB burst, plotted using the purple block.\nThe orange blocks in Fig.2(a) denote the reference signals (RSs) inserted in the data. The RSs are the predefined signals specifically designed for channel estimation and tracking [22]. According to NR specification, the RSs are comb-type pilot signals that are inserted in data with spacing U, V in frequency and time respectively [21]. Although a denser insertion of RSs can support faster-speed movement cases, it in turn requires more resources for sensing. To depict the resource mapping in time and frequency domains, we define time-to-frequency allocation ratio \u03b1, which is the ratio of the time domain REs to the frequency domain REs. The allocation of total NRS REs in the time and frequency domains can be expressed as functions of \u03b1, i.e, the Ns = NRS \u03b1 OFDM symbols and Nf = NRS 1\u2212\u03b1 subcarriers.

            "text": "Based on the 5G frame structure, our main idea is leveraging the standard signals to detect potential blockages and track the users. The sensing information enables the BS to predict the impending beam and cell switches and then initiates beam reselection in advance, avoiding beam misalignment.\nWe select 5G-standard signals to realize joint communication and sensing functions. Notice that the beam switches are decided at the BS side in the 5G standard. Therefore, for the convenience of the BSs to extract environmental information, it is more suitable to implement downlink sensing, where the sensing signals are from the BSs. Theoretically, all the downlink signals are known to the BSs that can be used for sensing [21]. However, designed for specific functions, the signals have different properties that affect their sensing abilities. Among the standard control signals, we select the SSBs for blockage detection and the RSs inserted in data for user tracking. The advantages are as follows:\n\u2022 Designed for beam synchronization, the periodical SSBs\ncover all directions. Thus, SSB-based sensing enables the BS to realize omni-directional blockage detection with periodically updated information. \u2022 SSBs cost a small number of REs compared to the data\nblocks and are less frequent [40], hence reducing the sensing overhead and computational complexity. \u2022 The RSs inserted in data, e,g., DMRS, are user-specific\nand continuously transmitted during the data phase. Thus, they are suitable for constant user tracking, providing real-time positioning information. \u2022 As pilot signals, both the SSBs and RSs have a good\nauto-correlation property that leads to improved sensing performance [21], [22]. Additionally, both of them are time and frequency divided with the data payload which causes less interference to data reception.\nTherefore, we propose a scheme that jointly exploits SSBbased blockage detection and RSs-based user tracking, as in Fig.2 (b), named the Joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme. The procedures are summarized as the flow chart in Fig.2 (d), including the following three stages.\n1) Stage 1 Sensing signal configuration: As in Fig.2 (a), it starts with initializing the parameters for sensing signal configuration. The SSB configuration and the burst period \u03c4 is selected from 5G numerology. The size of the SSB burst is equal to the beam number nb. Configure the RS signal with a total NRS REs, allocating in time and frequency domain with a ratio of \u03b1. The RS insert spacings are U, V in frequency and time that are obtained using Theorem 1 given later in Sec.IV.\n2) Stage 2 JSRS-Aided Beam/Cell Switch: JSRS follows\nthe predict-and-prevent procedure, as plotted in Fig.2(b).\nDuring the beam sweeping phase, BS1 utilizes the scheduled periodical SSBs to detect potential blockages in the surroundings and periodically updates the environment information. During the data transmission phase, BS1 extracts the sensing information from the RSs to estimate the user speed v\u0303.\nIf BS1 detects potential blockages, it informs the closest available BS2 to transmit an additional SSB burst and informs the MT0 to prepare for inter-cell BS handover to BS2. If no blockage exists, BS1 further estimates user speed. Recall the beam misalignment challenge introduced in Sec.II-B. If the time that the user stayed within the beam coverage is shorter than the SSB period, he may miss the scheduled SSB burst. Thus, when the estimated speed of MT0 v\u0303 exceeds the threshold, that is\nv\u0303 \u2265 E[db] \u03c4 (\u2217) =\n\u03c0\nnb \u221a \u03bbB \u00b7 \u03c4 , (7)\nwhere (\u2217) comes from the fact that in Poisson Voronoi tessellation, the single beam coverage db follows an exponential distribution with density \u00b5g = nb \u221a \u03bbB/\u03c0 [7]. BS1 will send an additional SSB burst immediately to initiate a beam switch. The additional SSB burst can be transmitted immediately using the 5G-specified mini-slot, allowing timely assistance for beam measurement [36].\n3) Stage 3 Signal Pattern Adjustment: As in Fig.2(c), after Stage 2, if no SSB measurement report is received, sensing assistance is considered insufficient. To improve the sensing accuracy, BS1 allocates more REs for the RSs to increase the sensing resolutions. Return to Stage 1 to re-select the SSB configuration from the numerology, and re-design the RS pattern (\u03b1,U, V ) using Theorem 1."

According to 5GAA, V2X requires 0.1-1m positioning resolution, covers the intersection with a range of around 100m, supports an average speed of 70km/h in urban and 120km/h in highway [42]. Compared to the requirements, the sensing abilities of SSBs are sufficient to detect blockages in V2X networks with promising sensing coverage. For user tracking, RS-based sensing has the potential for localization, and the velocity range is able to detect vehicles with different mobility. It shows the standard configurations give SSBs and RSs the potential to be used for sensing assistance.\nNext, we tackle the rising problem of sensing signal pattern design to efficiently allocate the resources to enhance the sensing assistance in beam alignment."

In this section, we provide an optimal sensing signal configuration that allocates a fixed number of sensing resources in time and frequency domains to minimize the beam misalignment probability while satisfying the sensing requirements for unambiguous range and velocity.\nNote that the large delay caused by frequent link recovery is intolerable for latency-sensitive THz applications. The link failures caused by association timeout are also considered in beam misalignment modelling. Thus, two major causes of beam misalignment in JSRS-aided networks are\n1) Imperfect Sensing with A Probability of perr: The performance of JSRS is subjected to the signal perceptual accuracy, including the range and velocity resolutions. As analysed in TableII, the range resolution is sufficient for blockage detection, leaving the imperfect user positioning the major cause of the misguidance. Misled by the underestimated user speed, the BS may be unaware of the need for beam switches, causing failures to provide timely assistance.\n7 2) Association Timeout with A Probability of ptoB : The delay caused by successive beam reselections is non-negligible and results in link failures. In this paper, two failed attempts to establish the beam-pair between BS and MT are identified as one association timeout.

Interference and Noise Analysis\nFor LoS-dominant THz networks with narrow beams, the network interference is affected by the beam misalignment and LoS blockage [8]. Thanks to the highly-directional antennas, it is safe to assume that the signal leakage from BSs that are ideally oriented towards their targets is negligible [5]. Thus, the BS that interferes the typical MT0 when it satisfies:\ni) The BS is at the beam-searching phase, or it is transmit-\nting data but is misaligned with its associated MT;\nii) The transmit and receive beams of the BS and MT0 are\naccidentally oriented at each other;\niii) No blockage exists on their LoS-path.\nSatisfying the three conditions, The BS interfere-probability is\npI(ri) =\n[\nnbTSSB \u03c4 +\n(\n1\u2212nbTSSB \u03c4\n)\npsm\n]\n\u03b8b 2\u03c0 \u03b8m 2\u03c0 P IUB(ri),\n(22)\nwhere P IUB(ri) is the LoS-link unblocked probability.

We also reveal design insights in sensing signal configuration and network deployment for various conditions.\nSystem parameters are evolved from the 5G numerology to support THz communication, suggested by [38], [39]. Network deployment setups are based on the 5GAA requirements for general V2X use cases [42]. THz molecular absorption coefficients of the mean latitude are from the HITRAN database [43]. The parameter settings are set as listed in Table III. Unless otherwise stated, the central frequency fc = 0.34THz, the beam number nb = 128, the resources for RSs NRS = 5e3, the BS density \u03bb = 2e3/km2 and the user density \u03bbM = 5e3/km2. Note that, the accuracy of the derived expressions for beam misalignment probability, coverage probability and throughput has been verified by comparing with the MonteCarlo simulations in our previous works [8], [24], [34].\nTo illustrate the superiority of JSRS, its performance is compared to the following cases, representing the upper bound, baseline and peer level respectively.\n1) Perfect Sensing Case: As the upper bound, it stands for the ideal performance of the proposed sensing-aided scheme with no estimation error, labelled as Perfect sensing.\n10\n2) 5G Standard Sensing Case: As the benchmark, it represents the performance achieved with 5G-required sensing ability, labelled as 5G. Based on the 5GAA, the required sensing resolutions for general V2X use cases are set to \u2206db = 0.3m in range and \u2206V = 1m/s in velocity [42]. Substituting the resolutions into Lemma 1 and Theorem 2, we have the beam misalignment probability and coverage probability in 5G cases. In terms of the sensing cost in 5G cases, the RSs designed for channel estimation are considered as the major cost [36]. For the strictest comparison, we adopt the sparsest RS configuration, which is 1 OFDM symbol per slot [40]. The cost of sensing is then \u03b2 = 1/14.\n3) SSB-Based Sensing Case: For peer comparison, we select the single SSB-sensing scheme from work [24], labelled as SSB. In this case, SSBs are used for both blockage detection and user tracking. The motion and velocity resolutions are\n\u2206db = A\u03b8c/(2BSSB),\u2206v = c/(2fcTSSB).\nBecause only the SSBs are used for sensing, the sensing cost ratio is \u03b2 = NSSB/Ntot.\nFor fairness, the available bandwidth is the same for all cases as the 5G-supported Btot = 1GHz [36]. However, THz networks can practically support bandwidth up to hundreds of GHz, bringing in huge growth in throughput."

We also reveal design insights into the sensing signal pattern design for minimizing the beam misalignment probability.\nFig.3(a), (b) reveal design insights in the optimal time-tofrequency allocation ratio to achieve near-ideal performance with fixed sensing resources. Specifically, Fig.3(a) shows that utilizing the high angular resolution of narrower beams helps improve the beam alignment and reduce the cost of sensing. As shown in Fig.3(a), to cope with the frequent beam switches caused by narrower beams, the resources are more allocated to the time domain for higher velocity resolution, indicated as the increased allocation ratio. In contrast, Fig.3(b) shows that the\nresources are more allocated to bandwidth when using higherfrequency signals, thanks to their finer velocity resolution that spares more resources for frequency-domain range perception.\nFig.4(a) shows that JSRS-scheme significantly reduces the beam misalignment probability, compared to 5G and SSB cases. The near-ideal performance is achieved when nb \u2265 256 (\u03b8 \u2264 1.41\u25e6). Thanks to the high angular resolution of narrow beams, after reaching the peak, the beam misalignment of the sensing-aided network decreases with narrower beams. It suggests that the JSRS scheme turns the disadvantages of sharp beams into advantages, allowing sensing-aided THz networks to use narrower beams to enlarge the coverage.\nFig.4(b) plots the JSRS benefit versus its cost. It shows that JSRS requires low sensing cost to provide promising assistance, and outperforms the 5G and SSB-based networks even with insufficient sensing resources. A near-ideal performance is achieved when NRS \u2265 1500, i.e., TS = 0.085ms, BS = 0.15GHz, that is acceptable compared to the 10ms frame duration and 1GHz data bandwidth. Although the denser user increases the probability of beam misalignment, it can be compensated by increasing the sensing resource or using narrower beamwidth that both bring in more precise perception.\n11"

            "text": "As shown by Fig.4(c), under tested various scenarios, the JSRS-aided THz network achieves an average coverage probability of 90%, showing an increment by 75%, 20% compared to the 5G-case and the SSB-sensing case respectively. It achieves near-ideal performance with a small difference in probability of around 0.007. Satisfying a probability of pcvp \u2265 90%, JSRS-aided THz network covers around 60m when the SINR threshold T = 5dB, and reaches 30m when T = 10dB. Since sensing assistance cannot enhance signal power, the turning points of different cases are similar. But the JSRS scheme significantly enhances the coverage by improving the beam alignment, especially within the reachable range of the THz signals.\nFig.5 provides design insights in network deployment that maximizes the coverage probability. In tested cases, preferable BS density lies within 5e3 \u2212 9e3/km2, marked as the blue strips. Extra dense BS deployment causes a sharp drop in coverage, e.g., \u03bbB \u2265 1e4/km2, suggesting that the THz network needs to restrain the node density to guarantee the link quality. Specifically, Fig.5(a) shows that the increase of sensing resources allows the network to deploy denser BSs, because higher sensing accuracy helps mitigate severe LoS-blockage effect on the dense network. Thus, the JSRS scheme can improve the spatial throughput of THz networks. As shown in Fig.5(b), the LoS blockage caused by denser users also degrades the coverage probability, requiring more BSs to support massive links. Increasing the BS density within a reasonable range not only shortens the transmission distance but also reduces the probability of LoS blockage, improving the received signal power with fewer link failures. Thus, deploying more BSs within a preferable range helps the network support more users."

Averaged in various settings, the JSRS scheme realizes an increment of spatial throughput by 30%, compared to the network with 5G-sensing ability. It achieves near-ideal performance with a small gap of 3% difference per link throughput. Note that, the ultra-wide available THz bandwidth, i.e.,\n10\u2212100GHz, can provide significant growth in the throughput of THz networks.\nFig.6(a) shows that the JSRS-aided network achieves over 5Gbps link throughput, and near ideal performance is achieved when nb \u2265 360 in tested cases. It reveals the beamwidth tradeoff between the enhanced sensing ability of narrower beams and its larger synchronization overhead. The red arrow indicates that a wider beamwidth is preferred to facilitate denser BS deployment, because they help reduce the synchronization overhead caused by frequent beam switches. Using narrower beams helps reduce the sensing overhead, thanks to their finer angular resolution. Thus, more time and bandwidth can be spared for data transmission to increase the throughput.\nAs plotted in Fig.6(b) JSRS-aided network achieves an average spatial throughput of 0.1 \u2212 0.15Gbps/m2. It shows the accessed user density needs to be balanced between the increased spatial throughput by massive links and the severer blockage effect that degrades link quality. Comparing the lines with round markers, the blue dashed arrow shows that the network is able to support more users with increased BS density, enhancing the spatial throughput. Comparing the lines of the same color, the red arrow shows that when moderately increasing the sensing resource, network can achieve comparable throughput with lower-density users, suggesting a higher throughput per link achieved at the user side.\nFig.6(c) plots the effect of THz molecular absorption on the spectral efficiency, suggesting the preferable THz transmission bands. JSRS-aided THz network achieves an average 9bps/Hz spectral efficiency within the transmission windows, showing a 27% improvement compared to that of the 5G case. It shows that with the increase of central frequency, the spectral efficiency is enhanced because of the more accurate velocity estimation of the higher-frequency signals. Also, at higher bands, using fewer sensing resources can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to that of using more sensing resources. Thus, networks operating at higher THz-band require less sensing cost, sparing resources for data transmission."

In line with the 5G beam management, this paper proposes a JSRS scheme to assist THz beam alignment, which is highly compatible with the 5G air interface. Different from the traditional detectand-correct method, JSRS helps the BS predict the impending beam switches and thus prevent beam misalignment, enhancing the network coverage probability. We provide a sensing signal configuration that determines the optimal timeto-frequency pattern to minimize beam misalignment with fixed sensing resources. Based on stochastic geometry, we derive coverage probability and spatial throughput expressions, which reveal insights into ISAC-THz network deployment and can be used to evaluate the performance gain from sensing. They also play important roles in follow-up studies on sensing resource allocation. In tested urban V2X scenarios, numerical results show that JSRS achieves near-ideal performance and effectively reduces average 80% beam misalignment, and increases 75% coverage probability, compared to 5G cases."
