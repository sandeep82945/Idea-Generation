 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate biofilm formation on other common plastic types like polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. in different aquatic environments to see if similar patterns emerge. 

2. Conduct field studies placing plastic samples in various natural aquatic environments over longer time periods to validate lab findings.

3. Use metagenomic sequencing to identify the microbial species comprising the biofilms on the plastics from each environment. 

4. Develop mathematical models to predict biofilm growth rates and properties on plastics based on environmental factors like temperature, nutrients, etc.

5. Test anti-biofouling coatings or surface modifications of plastics to inhibit biofilm formation in aquatic environments.
