In driven-dissipative systems displaying macroscopic quantum coherence, as exciton polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, the phase dynamics can be mapped to the stochastic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. However, it was argued theoretically that in two dimensions the KPZ regime may be hindered by the presence of vortices, and a nonequilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior was reported close to the condensation threshold. We demonstrate here that, when a discretized two-dimensional (2D) polariton system is considered, universal KPZ properties can emerge. We support our analysis by extensive numerical simulations of the discrete stochastic generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We show that the first-order correlation function of the condensate exhibits stretched exponential behaviors in space and time with critical exponents characteristic of the 2D KPZ universality class and find that the related scaling function accurately matches the KPZ theoretical one, stemming from functional renormalization group. We also obtain the distribution of the phase fluctuations and find that it is non-Gaussian, as expected for a KPZ stochastic process.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.043207\nI. INTRODUCTION\nScale invariance and universality are the most striking features revealed by the study of equilibrium continuous phase transitions. They refer to the fact that in the vicinity of a critical point, systems of completely different nature can exhibit correlations in their order parameter fluctuations characterized by the same power law, with the same universal critical exponents.\nThe emergence of universality is well understood in systems at thermal equilibrium, but far less so out of equilibrium. In such systems, criticality can, for instance, emerge spontaneously during the time evolution of the system, a phenomenon known as self-organized criticality [1]. A paradigmatic example of this feature is the mechanism of kinetic roughening of a stochastically growing interface [2,3], for which the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation was originally derived [4]. It was realized later on that a strikingly large variety of systems actually belong to the KPZ universality class [5], such as switching fronts propagating\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nin liquid crystals [6] or the development of modern urban skylines under building constraints [7].\nRecently, KPZ universality was found in a surprising context: In the phase dynamics of driven-dissipative exciton polariton (polariton) condensates. Polaritons are nonequilibrium quasiparticles that form within semiconductor microcavities operating in the strong-coupling regime between bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and cavity photons. Under nonresonant excitation, polaritons can spontaneously condense into a macroscopic coherent state [8\u201310]. In this state, the microscopic model describing the dynamics of the condensate phase has been shown to map onto the KPZ equation [11\u201313]. This has far-reaching conceptual implications, as it shows that the nature of a polariton condensate is very different from its thermal equilibrium counterpart. Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality was confirmed numerically in a one-dimensional (1D) polariton condensate, both in terms of scaling of spatiotemporal correlations [14] and in terms of the phase fluctuation statistics [15,16]. In a polariton condensate, in contrast with more usual KPZ interfaces, space-time vortices can emerge stochastically due to the intrinsic 2\u03c0 periodicity of the phase [17]. However, KPZ dynamics can coexist with (and remain robust to) such defects. Indeed, KPZ scaling in a 1D polariton condensate has been reported experimentally [18], thus promoting polaritons as a compelling experimental platform to probe KPZ universality.\nIn two dimensions, far fewer results have been obtained for the KPZ equation: No exact result is available and mainly\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043207(13) 043207-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nfunctional renormalization group calculations [19\u201322] and numerical simulations [23\u201339] have provided quantitative information. Experimentally, polaritons offer a unique opportunity to investigate KPZ physics, as they are well suited to form a two-dimensional condensate. The dynamics of its phase in two dimensions enables the study of the 2D KPZ universality class releasing the stringent requirement of realizing a growing surface embedded in a three-dimensional physical space. In this work we address theoretically and numerically the emergence of KPZ physics in a nonresonantly driven discrete 2D polariton condensate. Our work is complementary to the studies on coherent excitations [40\u201342], the optical parametric oscillator [43], and the quadratic driving scheme [44], where the possibility of observing KPZ-like behavior was highlighted. All of the above correspond to different models with respect to the one considered here.\nIn two dimensions, equilibrium bosonic quantum fluids undergo the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition stemming from vortex-antivortex unbinding. Owing to the driven-dissipative nature of polaritons, the behavior of vortices is different: The attractive vortex-antivortex interaction is, for instance, dramatically damped at large distances and can even change sign to become repulsive [45,46], hindering their annihilation. In some specific nonequilibrium conditions, the vortex motion can also be self-accelerated, leading to the creation of additional vortex pairs [45,46]. The role of vortex unbinding in driven-dissipative condensates has also been studied using the duality with a theory for nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to charges [47,48]. Thus, vortexfilled phases are also present in nonequilibrium systems and could be detrimental to the emergence of KPZ universality in two dimensions. This is supported by an argument based on perturbative renormalization group (RG), which suggests that the proliferation of vortices, which happens at spatial scale Lv , spoils KPZ stretched exponential decay of coherence characterized by a much longer length scale [13]. Moreover, several studies, based on both experiments and numerical simulations of 2D polariton condensates, have reported BKT-like types of behaviors, with specificities that are related to the nonequilibrium regime [49\u201353].\nAn important feature of this system is that the dimensionality of the parameter space is large such that a multitude of realistic regimes dominated by the KPZ universality could still exist. For example, the momentum-dependent loss rate of the polaritons plays an important role in the magnitude of the KPZ nonlinearity \u03bb and hence in the possibility of reaching a KPZ regime. Indeed, KPZ scaling of spatiotemporal correlation functions were then found in some region of the parameter space, as well as vortex-free regimes [54]. However, this was obtained in the low-noise limit, while a realistic noise input is typically larger and fixed by the polariton pump and losses.\nIn this work we demonstrate the existence of a KPZ regime for the phase dynamics of polariton condensates in two dimensions, using, for most parameters, values that can be realistically achieved in experiments. We show that in this regime, the proliferation of topological defects such as spatial or spatiotemporal vortices can be limited by acting on the pump strength and by introducing a cutoff length scale via discretization of space due to the introduction of a lattice potential. Polariton lattices are routinely created in\nsemiconductor microcavities (see eg [55] for a review). We obtain the KPZ scaling in the spatiotemporal correlation function of the condensate wave function. This scaling is robust against some variations of the pump and of the lattice spacing. Furthermore, we compare the obtained scaling function with the one predicted for KPZ equation by functional renormalization group approaches, finding excellent agreement. Finally, we provide compelling evidence for the 2D KPZ universality via the analysis of the fluctuations of the condensate phase. We compute the probability distribution function of the phase fluctuations and show that it accurately matches the one obtained from large-scale numerical simulations of 2D KPZ systems [38,39,56].\nThe paper is organized as follows. The model studied, which is the generalized stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the dynamics of the condensate wave function, is introduced in Sec. II. We recall the mapping from this equation to the KPZ equation in Sec. III and review the universal properties of the KPZ equation in two dimensions in Sec. IV. We describe the numerical simulations we performed and we develop an analysis of the purely spatial and spatiotemporal vortices in Sec. V. We present our results for the spatiotemporal correlation function in Sec. VI and our results for the distribution of the phase fluctuations in Sec. VII. We summarize and present prospective work in Sec. VIII."

            "text": "As was shown in several studies, e.g., [14,15], the dynamics of the phase of a spatially homogeneous driven-dissipative condensate can be mapped onto the KPZ equation. To show this, one expresses the condensate field in the density-phase representation \u03c8 (t, r) = \u221an(t, r)ei\u03b8 (t,r). Under the assumption that the density fluctuations \u03b4n(t, r) = n(t, r) \u2212 \u3008n\u3009 are sufficiently smooth \u2207\u03b4n 0 and stationary \u2202t\u03b4n 0, one obtains for the phase dynamics the KPZ equation\n\u2202t\u03b8 = \u03bd\u22072\u03b8 + \u03bb 2 (\u2207\u03b8 )2 + \u221aD\u03b7, (2) where the noise \u03b7 is real and has zero mean and covariance \u3008\u03b7(t, r)\u03b7(t \u2032, r\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032)\u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032). The KPZ parameters are determined by the microscopic parameters of Eq. (1) as \u03bd = \u03b3l,2/2 + ah\u0304/2m, \u03bb = \u2212h\u0304/m + a\u03b3l,2, and D = \u03c3 (1 + a2)/2ns(p \u2212 1), where a = 2pgns(1 \u2212 2Pgr/p2g\u03b3rns)/h\u0304\u03b3l,0. Several remarks are required. First, the mapping is readily extended to the case of an external confinement (see, e.g., [16]). Then we note that for classical interfaces, the height field h(r, t ) describes a D-dimensional manifold embedded in a d = D + 1 space. The mapping hence relates the phase \u03b8 (t, r) of a condensate in D = 2 spatial dimensions to an interface of internal dimension 2 in a d = 2 + 1 space. It holds in any dimension provided the previous assumptions are fulfilled. Second, another fundamental difference lies in the compactness of the phase, which is periodically defined \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ], whereas the height of an interface is an unbounded field h \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e). This implies that the phase field can feature topological defects, such as phase jumps or vortices, as already mentioned. While a compact version of the KPZ equation turns out to be relevant in some systems such as driven vortex lattices in disordered superconductors [62] or polar active smectic phases [63], we show that the behavior of the phase in the regime studied in this work belongs to the noncompact KPZ universality class, as it involves only a few sporadic vortices and the condensate phase can be uniquely unwound. As a third remark we mention that several works introduce some anisotropy in the polariton effective mass (m\u2016, m\u22a5), which leads through a similar mapping to the anisotropic extension of the KPZ equation [13]. However, as long as m\u2016 and m\u22a5 have the same sign, the anisotropy is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense and the universal properties of the anisotropic KPZ dynamics are controlled by the isotropic fixed point. When they have opposite sign, the nonlinearity gKPZ = \u03bb2D/\u03bd3 becomes irrelevant and the effective properties of the system are governed by the anisotropic Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) fixed point [21,64,65]. Since we are interested in the nonlinear KPZ regime, we do not include any anisotropy and consider an isotropic polariton dispersion relation."

            "text": "While a wealth of exact results have been obtained for the KPZ equation in one dimension, no exact results are available in two dimensions, except the exact exponent relation \u03c7 + z = 2, which stems from the statistical tilt symmetry of the KPZ equation and holds in all dimensions. The\nuniversal properties of the KPZ equation in two dimensions have been thoroughly studied using numerical simulations of discrete models belonging to the KPZ universality class (see, e.g., Refs. [23\u201335]) or of the KPZ equation itself (e.g., Refs. [36,37,66\u201368]). The most precise estimates yield a roughness exponent \u03c7 0.39, z = 2 \u2212 \u03c7 1.61, and thus a growth exponent \u03b2 = \u03c7/z 0.24 (we recall that in one dimension, one has \u03c7 = 1/2 and \u03b2 = 1/3). The probability distribution of height fluctuations has also been computed numerically in Refs. [38,39,56], which suggest the existence of different universality subclasses, associated with different global geometries of the growth, as in one dimension (discussed below).\nOn the analytical side, the KPZ phase is described by a genuinely strong-coupling fixed point in D 2. Indeed, it was shown in [69] that the perturbative RG flow equation for the KPZ coupling gKPZ can be resummed exactly, yielding an expression valid to all orders in perturbation theory in the vicinity of two dimensions. However, this expression fails to capture the strong-coupling KPZ fixed point, yielding instead a runaway flow to infinity. Hence, we emphasize that one cannot extract any quantitative information about the KPZ fixed point in two dimensions or higher dimensions from the perturbative flow equation.\nA nonperturbative RG calculation was devised using functional renormalization group in Refs. [19,20,70], which allows accessing the strong-coupling KPZ fixed point in all dimensions. It shows that the KPZ fixed point is not connected to the Gaussian Edwards-Wilkinson fixed point in any dimension, which explains the failure of perturbation theory, even resummed at all orders. The KPZ universal scaling function F in two dimensions was calculated in [20] and will serve as our theoretical reference. It is defined as\nC( t, r) = C0 t2\u03b2F (\ny0 | r| t1/z\n) , (3)\nwhere C is the two-point connected correlation function\nC( t, r) = \u3008h(t + t, r + r)h(t, r)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008h(t + t, r + r)\u3009\u3008h(t, r)\u3009 (4)\nand C0 and y0 are nonuniversal normalization constants.

(6)\nWe numerically integrate the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GGPE) (6) using a split-step procedure for each\n043207-3\nnoise realization (see Appendix A for details). We use a 2D N \u00d7 N lattice grid with spatial spacing dx = 2.83 \u00b5m, with N = 64 for the analysis of the correlation functions and N = 32, 64, 128 for the study of the fluctuations distribution. In [18], where KPZ scaling was observed in a 1D lattice, the full dispersion of the system was approximated in the simulations by a parabolic dispersion, which provided a very accurate description. In two dimensions, we also approximate the dispersion of the lattice model (e.g., a cosine dispersion in the tight-binding regime) with a parabolic one. Indeed, the two dispersions are equivalent in the vicinity of k = 0 and differ only at large k. Thus, we expect the difference between the two to occur mainly at small spatial scales, which lie below the ones relevant for KPZ dynamics and which are not of direct interest in this study. We choose the following parameters: Effective mass m\u2217 = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125me, where me is the mass of the electron, corresponding to ReK/h\u0304 = 0.72 ps\u22121; \u03b3l,0 = 0.31 ps\u22121; \u03b3r = \u03b3l,0/10; and \u03b3l,2 = 0.1 \u00b5m2 ps\u22121, yielding ImK/h\u0304 = 0.05 ps\u22121. We note that the value of \u03b3l,0 corresponds to a polariton lifetime \u03c4 = 3.2 ps, which is much too fast for significant equilibration to take place. Furthermore, we consider a noninteracting system with g = 0, since this turned out to be a good description of the 1D experiment. We note that the presence of polariton-polariton (g) and polariton-reservoir (gr) interactions are not fundamental for the existence of a KPZ regime, since the mapping still holds for g = gr = 0. In fact, the study reported in Ref. [54] suggests that the development of the KPZ regime is favored by weak interactions. To further reduce the parameter space to explore, we also set gr = 0, although we stress that in order to faithfully model the experimental conditions one should take a nonzero value for this term. The saturation density is fixed at Ns = 120. The numerical integration is performed with a time step of dt = 0.16 ps to study the scaling and down to dt = 0.0016 ps to study the statistics of the fluctuations. This finer time discretization ensures that the phase can be uniquely unwrapped in time \u03b8 (t, r) \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ] \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e). The phase is unwrapped at a fixed space point by constraining the phase difference between two consecutive times to be less than 2\u03c0\u03b6 . In practice, we choose \u03b6 not exactly one but \u03b6 1 due to the final time resolution. This procedure is robust as long as \u03b6 is typically greater than 0.5.\nIn order to tentatively locate the KPZ regime, we first investigate the density of topological defects, which are either purely spatial vortices in the (x, y) plane or space-time vortices which have a nonvanishing projection of their vorticity in the (t, x) and/or (t, y) planes. The latter were shown to play an important role in one dimension [17,18]. Keeping the other parameters fixed, we vary the reduced pump p from low p 1 (close to threshold) to moderately high p = 2. For each value of p, we determine the density of purely spatial and space-time vortices in the stationary state, which is shown in Fig. 1, with typical phase configurations in the (x, y) plane [similar maps are obtained in the (t, x) and (t, y) planes]. The numerical procedure to detect the vortices and compute their density is detailed in Appendix A. We find that the number of vortices drastically decreases when increasing the pump power, and for p 1.6, very few spatial vortices are present, in agreement with Ref. [52], and also very few space-time vortices. Both appear only by pairs of closely located vortices and\nantivortices. We hence focus in the following on the highest value of the pump p = 2, which appears as more favorable for observing KPZ dynamics. We show in Appendix B that the KPZ regime is robust, to a certain extent, against decreasing the pump power.\nThe presence of topological defects turns out to be also sensitive to the discreteness of space, and we find that the presence of a lattice (of spacing dx) is favorable to the observation of the KPZ regime since the density of such defects is suppressed when increasing the grid spacing dx, as shown in Fig. 2. For dx 1 \u00b5m, the emergence of space-time vortices is rare and very short lived. In the following, we choose dx = 2.83 \u00b5m, which is close to the spacing in experimental micropillar lattices [18]. For this value, the fraction of both spatial and space-time vortices is below 10\u22123 and does not spoil the KPZ universal properties. Moreover, the core size of the spatial vortices was observed to be very narrow, of the order of the lattice spacing."

(3) and (5),\n\u22122 ln |g1,\u03c8 ( t = 0, r)| \u223c r2\u03c7 , (9a) \u22122 ln |g1,\u03c8 ( t, r = 0)| \u223c t2\u03b2, (9b)\nwith \u03c7 0.39 and \u03b2 0.24. We observe the expected scaling behavior in both space and time, as shown in Fig. 3. For temporal correlations, the KPZ scaling extends for time differences spanning over a decade, from 3 \u00d7 102 to 1.5 \u00d7 104 ps,\nwhereas for spatial correlations, the KPZ scaling is observed over a range from 10 to 40 \u00b5m. The limited space range is related to the relatively small size of our system, with a condensate of approximately 90 \u00b5m radius. Note that the polariton interaction with the reservoir gr is here set to zero, but it is likely to play a role in the typical space scales and timescales where KPZ dynamics dominates, as observed in one dimension [18].\nIn order to provide a quantitative estimate of the critical exponents \u03c7 and \u03b2, we compute the local exponents, given by the logarithmic derivatives\nd\nd ln r {ln[\u22122 ln |g1,\u03c8 ( t = 0, r)|]} \u223c 2\u03c7, (10a)\nd\nd ln t {ln[\u22122 ln |g1,\u03c8 ( t, r = 0)|]} \u223c 2\u03b2. (10b)\n043207-5\nThe result is shown in the insets of Fig. 3. We fit the obtained local exponents by a constant in the appropriate spatial and temporal windows, which yields the values of the universal exponents \u03b2EP 0.22 \u00b1 0.06 and \u03c7EP 0.36 \u00b1 0.04. These values are in good agreement with the results from numerical simulations for the 2D KPZ universality class [35].\nWe now study the scaling properties of the spatiotemporal correlations over the whole relevant domain ( t, r). For this, we first select the data lying within the scaling regime, indicated in the inset of Fig. 4. We then construct the scaling function F (y) defined in Eq. (3). The normalizations C0 and y0 are determined from fitting the equal-time and equal-space correlation functions with the power laws (9a) and (9b) in the appropriate ranges. Our results are shown in Fig. 4, together with the theoretical scaling function calculated from functional renormalization group. We observe a collapse of the data onto a single curve, which matches the theoretical one with excellent accuracy. This result shows that the phase of the two-dimensional polariton condensate follows a KPZ effective dynamics over extended length scales and timescales."

In order to discuss the 2D results, we first briefly summarize what is known for a 1D classical interface described by a height field h. In this case, the distribution of the reduced height fluctuations defined as h\u0303 = (h \u2212 v\u221et )/( t )1/3, with v\u221e and nonuniversal parameters, is known exactly. In fact, the distribution of h\u0303 was shown to be universal but sensitive to the global geometry of the growth, which led to the definition of three main universality subclasses. For flat, curved, or stationary geometries, the probability\ndistribution is given by Tracy-Widom Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, Tracy-Widom Gaussian unitary ensemble, or BaikRains distributions, respectively [71]. They all share the common feature of being non-Gaussian, with finite skewness and excess kurtosis. Strikingly, the three universality subclasses can also be realized in the polariton condensate in one dimension, where the role of global geometry can be emulated by appropriate external potentials [16].\nIn two dimensions, like in one dimension, the height field exhibits a linear growth in time with average velocity v\u221e, over which fluctuations develop with a t\u03b2 scaling. All 2D KPZ numerical works [38,39] find that the distribution of the reduced fluctuations h\u0303 are non-Gaussian and suggest, like in one dimension, the existence of different geometry-dependent universality subclasses. However, the corresponding distribution functions have no known analytical form like Tracy-Widom or Baik-Rains distributions in one dimension. To investigate the statistical properties of the phase fluctuations, we record 5120 independent realizations of the time evolution of \u03c8 , from which we extract the phase and unwrap it in time at a fixed space point. The presence of a few space-time vortexantivortex pairs with random core positions induces phase slips at the position of interest, which are noninstantaneous phase jumps close to (but lower than) 2\u03c0 .\nAs already evidenced in one dimension [18], these phase slips result in the existence of replicas of the distribution of the fluctuations separated by approximately 2\u03c0 . As detailed in Appendix D, one can select the main central distribution at each time instant in the KPZ window and sum them after appropriate rescaling. The obtained distribution is shown in Fig. 5. It is markedly distinct from a Gaussian distribution\n043207-6\nof the same mean and variance and matches the distribution1 computed in 2D KPZ large-scale numerical simulations for flat interfaces [38,39], which is the expected universality subclass for polaritons in the absence of confinement potential [16]. This result for the fluctuations distribution enforces the evidence for KPZ universality in 2D polariton condensates."

We have obtained the condensate spatiotemporal first-order correlation function and shown that, for the parameters studied, it exhibits stretched exponential behavior, in both space and time, with critical exponents characteristic of the 2D KPZ universality class. This scaling persists in a finite region of pump strength and grid spacing. Moreover, the associated scaling function accurately matches the theoretical KPZ scaling function given by functional renormalization group methods. We have also obtained the distribution of the phase fluctuations, which is highly non-Gaussian and very close to the distribution computed in numerical simulations of KPZ interfaces. This is compelling evidence that the phase fluctuations behave as the KPZ stochastic process.\nOur findings open promising perspectives. On the theoretical side, it would be desirable to obtain a complete description of the phase diagram of a polariton condensate in two dimensions, with a clear understanding of the interplay between the various possible regimes, e.g., nonequilibrium BKT and KPZ regimes. This remains a challenge as the parameter space to explore is very large. On the experimental side, the demonstration of the KPZ scaling in a 1D polariton condensate was recently realized in a lattice where real space was discretized [18]. Since our simulations predict that this is the optimal situation to prevent topological defect proliferation in two dimensions, similar techniques could be used in two dimensions. The evidence of a KPZ regime in a 2D polariton condensate would constitute a major breakthrough, especially since a convincing experimental realization of KPZ universality class in two dimensions is still missing and actively sought."

In the deep lattice regime, the condensate wave function can be expanded on the Wannier function basis \u03c8 (t, x) = \u2211 j w j (x)\u03c8 j (t ), with w j (x) = w(x \u2212 x j ), where w(x) is localized around x = 0. The Wannier functions are a set of real, localized, orthonormal wave functions centered on the lattice sites x j , where j = { jx, jy} identifies each lattice site of the 2D grid.\nWe will assume in the following for simplicity that the lattice potential is separable in the x and y directions, i.e., can be written as V (x) = V (x) + V (y), and we denote by dx the lattice spacing. Simple examples of V (x) are the sinusoidal case V (x) = V0 sin2(k0x), with k0 = \u03c0/dx, or the Kronig-Penney potential V (x) = V0 \u2211 n (x \u2212 (ndx + b)) ((n + 1)dx \u2212 x), with b a parameter associated with the width of the potential barrier and (x) the Heaviside step function. If the potential is separable, one also has w(x) = w1d (x)w1d (y), with w1d (x) the Wannier function for the one-dimensional lattice problem. We will further assume that |\u03c8 |2/ns 1 such that the terms involving the pump can be Taylor expanded to first order. This hypothesis may be easily released by treating in an analogous fashion the higher-order terms of the Taylor expansion.\n043207-7\nUnder the above assumptions, by projecting Eq.

The discretized noise is \u03be j (t ) =\u222b\nd2x w j (x)\u03be (t, x). In the numerical simulations, in order to make a connection with the continuous limit expressions, we have resummed the term p(1 \u2212 |\u03c8 j |2/Ns) onto p/(1 + |\u03c8 j |2/Ns). Also, for convenience, we have chosen the zero of the energy such that W0 = 4K .\nThe continuous limit of Eq. (A2) can be formally defined by the limit \u03c8 (x j ) = limdx\u21920 \u03c8 j/dx. This allows one to relate the parameters of the lattice model to the ones of the effective continuous model, for example, Re(K ) = h\u03042/2m\u2217dx2, with m\u2217 an effective mass. However, this limiting procedure assumes that the parameters entering the discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation are independent of the lattice spacing, which is, strictly speaking, not the case since the lattice potential enters in the definition of K . This implies that the effective mass will be slightly modified when changing dx."

If a quantized vortex is present at a point, then I = \u03ba2\u03c0 , where \u03ba is the vortex charge; otherwise I = 0 [73]. The closed contour C should be defined such that it encloses a small part of the fluid containing up to one vortex core, in which case the circulation does not depend on the precise form of the contour.\nHowever, this method quickly becomes intractable when applied to each point in a grid consisting of many points, such as a space grid with fine spatial discretization, or a space-time grid, defined by selecting one spatial direction and time. In the latter case, the time discretization is typically chosen as much finer than the spatial one, thus requiring an extremely large number of points in order to study the dynamics of the condensate until some time after the steady state has been reached. We circumvent this issue by computing the curl of the gradient of the phase of the condensate, \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207\u03b8 . By definition, the projection of this quantity in each of the three directions, the two spatial and the temporal ones, is related to the infinitesimal circulation of the gradient of the phase around each point of the grid,\n\u2207 \u00d7 \u2207\u03b8 \u00b7 S \u2192 I, (A4) where S is the normal vector\nS = dx2t\u0302 + dxdt x\u0302 + dxdt y\u0302, (A5) dx is the unit length, which is chosen equal for both the x and y directions, and dt is the unit time.\nFrom our numerical simulations, we extract the phase of the condensate in the (x, y) plane in an appropriate time window in the steady state, thus effectively creating a 3D data set. We then compute the components of the gradient numerically along each direction separately, once the phase has been unwrapped in that direction. Finally, we compute each of the components of the curl straightforwardly. Overall, this procedure allows us to identify, in a particularly efficient manner, both the spatial vortices and the space-time topological defects by mapping the (2 + 1)-dimensional problem to three distinct two-dimensional ones.\nIn order to compute the vortex density, we study each component of the curl separately. More specifically, for each component {x, y, t} we count the number of nonzero values Cvort of each curl component for each fixed \u201cslice\u201d {xi, yi, ti}, which allows us to compute the mean number of defects\nNvort,xy = 1 #ti \u2211 ti\u2208 t Cvort(ti ), (A6a)\nNvort,xt = 1 #yi \u2211 yi Cvort(yi ), (A6b)\nNvort,yt = 1 #xi \u2211 xi Cvort(xi ), (A6c)\nwhere t = 100 ps starting from an initial sampling time t0 = 100 ps. We then normalize our result by dividing with the total number of points in the 2D grid. We present our results for the mean occupation of the grid by topological defects in Figs. 1 and 2. In all our simulations, we observed that the size of the vortex cores is smaller or of the order of the spatial discretization dx. This is compatible with the\n043207-8\norder of magnitude of the typical length scale of our model, which can be estimated by comparing the dissipative part of the kinetic term with the gain term (since the interactions are zero). We find that it is proportional to the ratio \u221a \u03b3l,2/\u03b3l,0 and to the relative density fluctuations and is hence expected to be smaller than dx."

The equal-time and equal-space correlations, compensated by the KPZ power laws, are displayed in Fig. 6. We find that the temporal scaling is very robust, as plateaus for time delays spanning approximately 103\u2013104 ps are clearly identified for all values of the pump. The spatial scaling turns out to be more sensitive to the pump variations. Plateaus for spatial separations approximately 10\u201340 \u00b5m are apparent for p 1.8, but not for lower values of the pump. The progressive departure from the KPZ regime visible in the spatial scaling can be attributed to the increasing effect of density-phase correlations, as shown below. To summarize,\nwe find a robust KPZ scaling for the correlation functions in the moderately high pump regime, especially stable for the temporal behavior.\nAs expounded in the main text, the connection between the correlations of the condensate field \u03c8 and the correlations of the phase field \u03b8 itself relies on some assumptions. In order to check their validity, we extract the density n(t, r) and phase \u03b8 (t, r) from the condensate field and we compute separately the contributions to g1,\u03c8 from the density correlations\ng1,n( t, r) = \u3008 \u221a\nn(t0, r0)n(t0 + t, r0 + r)\u3009\u221a\u3008n(t0, r0)\u3009 \u221a\u3008n(t0 + t, r0 + r)\u3009 (B1)\nand the one from the phase correlations\ng1,\u03b8 ( t, r) = \u3008ei[\u03b8 (t0+ t,r0+ r)\u2212\u03b8 (t0,r0 )]\u3009. (B2) The results for p = 2 and 1.6 are displayed in Fig. 7. We observe that g1,n is very close to unity and constant over the whole KPZ spatial and temporal ranges for both pump powers. Thus, the role of density-density correlations is indeed negligible. The density-phase time correlations are\n043207-9\nalmost vanishing, since g1,\u03c8 ( t, 0) and g1,\u03b8 ( t, 0) almost perfectly coincide over the whole KPZ time range, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The density\u2013phase-space correlations are more important and their effect increases while decreasing the pump. They are shown in Fig. 7(b). For p = 2, the KPZ stretched exponential well models the behavior of both g1,\u03c8 and g1,\u03b8 . We checked that the difference between the two curves is just a multiplicative factor. Hence, the density-phase correlations are almost constant in the spatial KPZ window and the scaling of g1,\u03c8 follows the scaling of the phase-phase correlations, as expected in a KPZ regime. For p = 1.6, the KPZ stretched exponential no longer provides a good fit for the behavior of g1,\u03c8 (as already visible in Fig. 7) or for g1,\u03b8 . Moreover, the density-phase correlations start varying within the KPZ window and the difference between g1,\u03c8 and g1,\u03b8 is no longer a mere multiplicative factor. Thus, we conclude that for p = 2, the behavior of the correlations g1,\u03c8 indeed reflects the KPZ scaling of the phase itself, in both space and time, whereas for p = 1.6, the density\u2013phase-space correlations also contribute to the behavior of the g1,\u03c8 and the KPZ regime is hindered in space, although it persists in time."

As can be seen in the typical unwrapped phase trajectories shown in Fig. 8(a), these phase slips consist of abrupt but noninstantaneous changes of the phase of approximately 2\u03c0 . The existence of these jumps disrupts the leading linear behavior in time and thus prevents one from consistently defining the reduced fluctuations as \u03b4\u03b8 \u221d (\u03b8 \u2212 \u3008\u03b8\u3009)/t\u03b2 .\nIn order to circumvent this issue, we compute the probability density function P[\u03b8ti ] for each discrete time instant ti in the KPZ window. An example of such a distribution is shown in Fig. 8(b). Similarly to what was reported in one dimension [18], the phase slips give rise to secondary peaks in the distribution of the phase. The fluctuations of the realization where no, one, two, etc., jumps occurred populate the distribution in the first, second, third, etc., peak, where the different peaks are separated by approximately 2\u03c0 . These\n043207-10\npeaks have a similar shape, which shows that the dynamics is in fact piecewise KPZ dynamics in between the jumps. A similar behavior was also reported in [18] in one dimension and shown not to disrupt the emergence of KPZ universality. To study the shape of the main distribution with more accuracy, we concentrate on the fluctuations in the first peak for each time instant, by requiring |\u03b8ti \u2212 \u03b8ti,max| < , where \u03b8ti,max is the point for which P[\u03b8ti,max] = max(P[\u03b8ti ]), and we focus on the subset of them where P[\u03b8ti ] > Pmin.

We then sum the fluctuations of\nthe first peaks, properly normalized, for all time instants in the appropriate KPZ time window.\nWe mention that we have also performed a detailed analysis of the skewness and excess kurtosis of the phase fluctuations. These quantities are insensitive to normalization issues, whereas the data analysis of the distribution can suffer from unavoidable errors due to the empirical choice of and Pmin, and the small number of discrete bins for given ti. This analysis is reported in [74] and confirms that the skewness and excess kurtosis computed from our data are in good agreement with the universal values obtained from KPZ numerical simulations [38,39].\n[1] P.
