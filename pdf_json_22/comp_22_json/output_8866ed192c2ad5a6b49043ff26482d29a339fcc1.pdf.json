    "abstractText": "Due to the mechanical nature of container handling operations, as well as natural factors, container and handling infrastructure suffers various types of damage during use, especially within the tight and enclosed environments of a ship\u2019s hull. In this operational environment, it is critical to detect any sort of physical impacts between the vertical cell guides of the ship\u2019s hull and the container. Currently, an inspection of impacts and evaluation of any consequences is performed manually, via visual inspection processes. This process is time-consuming and relies on the technical expertise of the personnel involved. In this paper, we propose a five-step impact-detection methodology (IDM), intended to detect only the most significant impact events based on acceleration data. We conducted real measurements in a container terminal using a sensory device placed on the spreader of the quay crane. The proposed solution identified an average of 12.8 container impacts with the vertical cell guides during common handling operations. In addition, the results indicate that the presented IDM can be used to recognize repeated impacts in the same space of each bay of the ship, and can be used as a decision support tool for predictive maintenance systems.",

            "text": "Port operators and shipping companies constantly face several serious problems related to shipping container handling in the port environment while transporting shipping containers and performing handling operations with port infrastructure [1]. From an engineering perspective, the most common handling mistakes occur during the transportation of shipping containers from container ships [2]. On container ships, the position of containers is identified by a specific bay-row-tier coordinate system. This system is identical on almost all ships. The bays illustrate the cross-sections of the ship and are numbered from bow to stern. The rows run the length of the ship and are numbered from the middle of the ship outwards. Meanwhile, the tiers represent the layers of containers. Containers are raised and lowered within the holds with the aid of vertical cell guides. The placement of the shipping containers is performed by quay cranes (QC) and this process is known as handling the container. Depending on the structure, container ships can have several holds, specific spaces on the ship that can hold containers vertically, and which are divided into two parts depending on whether they are on-deck or under-deck (i.e., in the hold) within the ship\u2019s hull. Containers have exact cells, i.e., positions in these bays, along the ship\u2019s length [3]. Vertical cell guides are relatively simple structures that are serve to guide the containers inside the holds during their lowering and extraction. Without them, it would be impossible to place containers steadily and accurately in due time. However, they can be damaged quite easily by a few localized impacts from heavy containers if these are\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22072752 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752 2 of 26\nswinging without strict control inside the under-deck sections of the ship, halting the entire handling process for the whole ship. Even in such small spaces, with only 5 cm of free space from each side, a 30-ton container has enough dynamics to cause serious problems and damage both the metal infrastructure of the ship and the container itself. If the impacts occur repeatedly in the same places during a long period of operational time, this can cause structural damage to the ship, as well as to valuable goods. Without knowing where these impacts occur, it is difficult to mitigate against these risks of structural damage and cargo loss. Therefore, precise smart monitoring of these security events is a critical issue, which must be solved by employing various technological and methodological solutions. Security events related to container impacts with the vertical cell guides mostly occur naturally, due to many external factors, yet a small percentage of these events occur due to illegal or unprofessional actions. Containers tend to bend and shake heavily when subjected to such impacts, thus increasing the chances of breaching their integrity and allowing moisture, gases, or biological agents to enter and cause severe damage to cargo. The possibility of a critical impact is mostly random and is very difficult to detect in a realtime manner, even utilizing the smartest and the fastest methods available. Near real-time solutions are constantly introduced to the market and many intrusion scenarios are being tested by engineers worldwide. However, in real-life applications, trained operators still use ISO-regulated methods of visual detection, relying on their experience and supporting their decisions with the help of other personnel onboard the ship. In normal situations, structural damage can occur on a side wall, on the door, on the corners, or over multiple sections (see Figure 1) at any given moment, due to natural factors, unseen and undetected obstructions, poorly performed handling procedures, or simply due to corrosion of the container walls.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 27\nlowering and extraction.

Without knowing where these impacts occur, it is difficult to\nitigate against these risks of structural damage and cargo loss. Therefore, precise smart monitoring of these security events is a critical issue, which must be solved by employing various technological and methodological solutions. Security events related to container impacts with the vertical cell guides mostly occur naturally, due to many external factors, yet a small percentage of these events occur due to illegal or unprofessional actions. Containers tend to bend and shake heavily when subjected to such impacts, thus increasing the chances of breaching their integrity and allowing moisture, gases, or biological agents to enter and cause severe damage to cargo. The po sib lity of a critical impact is mostly random and is very difficult to detect in a realtime ma ner, even ut lizing the smartest and the fastest methods available. Near real-time solutions are constantly introduced to the market and many intrusion scenarios are being tested by engin ers worldwide. However, in real-life a plications, trained operators still use ISO-regulated methods of visual detection, relying on their experience and su porting their decisions with the help of other perso nel onboard the ship. In normal situations, structural damage can o cur on a side wall, on the d or, on the corners, or over multiple sections (s e Figure 1) at any given moment, due to natural factors, uns en and undetected obstructions, p orly performed handling procedures, or simply due to corrosion of the container walls.\nFigure 1. Example of a damaged marine container.\nIt should be noted that in such a harsh environment, where every object has its own dynamic properties, such as the constant movement of the ship near the berth, unpredictable wind gusts, operator actions, etc., it is extremely difficult to control the handling process with optimized coordination and to limit unnecessary contacts with other metal structures surrounding the handled container. Bad stowage can cause damage to multiple containers onboard the ship. Damage also occurs when heavyweight containers find their way into the upper tiers of container stacks on decks. The damage can be minimal or large enough to stop the entire transportation process within a single hold, sometimes destroying goods completely.\nFigure 1.

If performed inappropriately and without strict safety regulations, this could damage not only the container but also the guides, endangering the personnel working nearby (see Figure 3). Container movement along the vertical cell guides is performed using long cables, attached to the spreader of the QC. For this reason, the process itself is nonlinear; the observed motion of the spreader and the attached container follows a nonlinear state equation, more similar to a complex sinusoidal dependency, due to the natural swinging of the two attached bodies in free space.

If the inspection of the ship is performed regularly, the risk of vertical cell guide damage caused by containers in the later transportation process can be avoided. However, this detection method is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and places high demands on specialized personnel working aboard the ships [6]. Many researchers are studying methods and developing complex sensory systems [7] to assist or replace manual infrastructure inspection aboard ships, including optical devices, laser scanners, etc. However, the problem of vertical cell guide wear is not well considered in the literature [8]. In addition, the research literature does not consider the problem of the jamming of containers inside the holds during the handling process, which can cause serious damage to the ship\u2019s hull, the containers, and cargo handling equipment, halting the entire handling operation. Signal-processing algorithms applicable to real-world engineering solutions are a hotspot of data science research [9,10]. Although the related research is in the development stage, due to the aforementioned reasons, there is much scientific literature on this common research direction in the sub-sections of transportation [11,12] and computer science [13\u201315]. The current research on this topic shows the limitations of automated methods for detecting damage to container and handling infrastructure in the context of container\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752 5 of 26\nshipping, and suggests trends for future research. Firstly, fully automated and smartly digitized damage detection methods have not been applied on a large scale in the global supply chain, are limited by the operational environment, and lack standardized solutions [12]. Secondly, the proposed impact-detection methods highlight those features of a more complex multi-feature methodology for ship and container damage detection that are relative to the general and aforementioned container handling operations. The inclusion of a broader spectrum of parameters and sensory units could potentially increase the viability of these processes and enable more accurate estimations [16]. In addition, most of the existing research focuses on damage detection based on visual inspection, using real image datasets produced using visual inspection tools, collected by the repair personnel, related port authorities, and logistics companies [17]. However, most of the scientific community whose work focuses on damage detection systems for logistics does not have free access to such datasets, as most experiments are forbidden in the port environment for security and legal reasons. The lack of unified container and handling infrastructure datasets makes it extremely difficult for scientists and engineers to conduct objective experiments and comparison tests of various existing algorithms and sensory systems under uniform conditions. Regarding the safety and security of the containers and the cargo, a few research efforts have been reported in the literature [18]. However, none of the previous works discuss the application of acceleration sensors to detect container impacts in the inner parts of the ship during handling operations. The patterns of the container sway and natural vibrations of the metal structures are sensitive to many factors, such as the materials, the type and shape of the infrastructure, the speed of the handling procedures, the mass of the container, and the physical characteristics of the suspension system, along with the inclusions of the human factor and the general dimensionality of the test site. Moreover, the acceleration signal patterns can be valuable for forensics, i.e., the patterns can reveal if the container has been handled with care during the procedures, or if there have been collisions with the vertical cell guides aboard the ship, causing unnatural sway [19\u201321], sliding effects, and other modes of stability loss during transportation aboard the ship and beyond. However, the effective detection of genuine events is challenging, as the measured signals may be disrupted due to the handling processes or wireless data transmission losses [22], and containers may manifest multiple concurrent modes of stability loss during their placement within the inner holds. The recent literature contains many technological solutions for minimizing the number of real damage event occurrences. Smart Digital Technologies (SDT) integrated into the logistic processes of the port are becoming increasingly decisive due to the need for policymakers, urban planners, governmental administrators, managers, transport operators, related port authorities, and shipping companies to develop intelligently digitalized and overall sustainable logistic processes for the entire port and beyond [23\u201325]. To cope with the intense datafication and globalization of trade on a global scale [26], mostly using shipping containers, new data-driven approaches are being developed [27,28] to promote intelligent and sustainable development of digital and secure logistics [29,30]. The aim of this research further strengthens the research potential of the engineering community and participating organizations in the area of Smart Logistics [31], utilizing the new generation of Information technologies (IT), such as Cloud computing, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [32], 5G/LTE, and Big Data analytics [33]. The intention is to deepen our strategic knowledge of security and safety problems associated with Logistics 4.0, which entails highly flexible and adaptable logistics supply networks along with a variety of structural ICT solutions and multi-functional high-level security processes. Container handling operations within ports can be generally classified into the following two categories:\n\u2022 Planning methodologies, used for strategic/tactical purposes; \u2022 Control techniques, used for operational purposes.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752 6 of 26\nAs for the problem of planning, the main aim is to develop optimized online systems to govern the motion and transportation of containers in terms of routing, sequencing, and scheduling problems [34]. From the planning perspective, new data driven-solutions can have a critical influence on the efficiency of operations, including the security of containers, personnel, and handling equipment, but the data must provide real-time information for the predictive maintenance of the ship\u2019s infrastructure, including a signaling tool to inform repair units to check the containers and vertical cell guides of the holds in the event of a significant impact, or a collective data set that provides statistical evidence of multiple impacts to the same areas. If the management procedures include sophisticated algorithms intended to optimize resources, operation times, etc., then any form of disturbance [35], including damages or security-related events, can seriously impact planning, and can even cause chaos among the personnel. Regarding the control operations, Predictive Model Controllers (MPC) are widely used to control heavy machinery and they tend to perform quite well [36]. The application of AI methods in these MPC control systems [1,37,38] tends to result in more efficient performance compared to regular methods and on-site human operators. However, these kinds of systems are mainly developed to be used as supporting tools in the form of decision support programs that highlight the optimum speed of transportation and the best movement patterns for containers and other means of transport within the terminal. These systems rely on data and process synchronization systems that connect all means of transport within the container terminal, ranging from diesel trucks to autonomous electrical trucks and various port cranes (QC, and YC) [39,40]. Management of these processes is performed using smart software solutions with smart Edge-Cloud infrastructures [41]. IIoT sensors with efficient power management solutions work to receive data from shipping containers, detecting their position, movement trends, weather parameters, inner cargo dynamics, etc., [42], with the aim of minimizing delays caused by any disruption and disturbances. However, ships tend to have complex dynamics due to mechanical, natural, and other disturbances. Threats to the containers arise during all means of transportation, but major impacts occur during QC handling of containers aboard container ships. There is no doubt that controlling these multiple processes is an optimization task too great to be solved by any individual management or control system. If no opportunity exists to install complex smart controllers within the cranes, then a simplified decision support system can be implemented, supporting the control procedures, and suggesting control patterns by detecting impacts, registering relevant events, and calculating possible risks. However, optimized maneuvering of the container inside the holds of the ship is a serious and demanding task even for operators with years of experience, due to the extremely narrow spaces for maneuvering. That is why detection of all \u201ctrue\u201d impacts is a must for any practical decision support system adapted for managerial decision support and risk assessments [43,44]. It is also worth mentioning the problems posed by the integration of shipping containers with different transportation modes, the optimization of resources, and the use of specialized modeling tools to ensure the operational performance of intermodal transportation [45]. When containers are positioned and lowered through the vertical cell guides, they tend to impact the vertical cell guides quite often and with varying force. To stabilize the process, many control solutions have been developed over the years, yet they all have downfalls related to the complexity of the dynamics of the ship, the quay crane, the trucks, and all other means of transportation [46\u201348]. Optimization of the handling processes is a priority for all logistics companies and it is certainly a hot topic in the current literature [49\u201352], yet optimization of container handling processes only rarely takes into account the damage perspective [8], which relates to the physical impacts of containers and the surrounding infrastructure. On the other hand, novel data analytics methods are being developed along with the rising popularity of embedded IoT devices [53], which are capable of delivering adequate solutions for decision-critical operations [54]. Their applicability and effectiveness in solving specific monitoring and local decision support tasks are\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752 7 of 26\nastonishing [55] compared to conventional methods. Most of these systems rely on simple sensory signal filtering methods [10], while others use AI-based solutions [21,56], deep learning [57], and other machine learning methods [58] to filter noises in the raw data [59], classifying events [60], detecting patterns [61], eliminating cyber threats in communication networks [60,62,63], compressing the data [64], etc."

The data samples were collected every 100 ms via the sensory unit, allowing the system to collect real-time information on movements and impacts. Beacon intervals and data rates were 100 milliseconds and 250 kbit/s, respectively. The previous measurement results were sent to the server and the user, along with a blank alert message in the packet, forming a historical log remotely and in the SD card of the device as a reserve. Each new packet was formed from a t\u22121 measurement, allowing the system to form the packet and send it to the user, thus having a 100 ms delay.

The research method framework for vertical cell guide damage (impact) detection combined acceleration signal processing using a frequency threshold detection algorithm, a visual inspection policy, operational standards, and electronics.

The sensory device was placed on the spreader of the selected QC in a protected place with magnets and straps holding it in place. Data were collected by the sensors starting from the initial vertical movements of the spreader, up till the last moment. Although this would be inefficient within real-world applications, in this research a c mbinatio of several ke data transfer technologies must b used (LoRa, LTE, 5G, etc.), working in synergy and compensati g for the lack of network stability. Schematically, the pr cess of dete tion can be described as in Figure 6, which indicates the directions of the container movemen along all the measured axes. Contai ers are placed in stacks i side the ship\u2019s hull, one above the other. The Y-axis marks the ovement of the contai er alo g the ship\u2019s hull. Throughout t e entire handling procedure, the main movement of the container occurs along the X-axis. The mounting point of the sensory device is marked by the red dot. The entire process of transporting a single container from the lowest part of the container ship is presented in Figure 7. Each position from 1 to 7 marks the beginning of a new movement trend, either parallel movements along the ground or vertical movements on both sides of the crane. Thus, the operator uses pre-defined movement and control patterns for each case according to their expertise. Movement patterns between 1 and 2 indicate the process of container hooking by the spreader. Movement patterns between 3 and 4, and between 5 and 6 indicate the sudden change of dynamics with an increased degree of container sway, resulting in unnecessary security issues for the cargo inside and the surrounding infrastructure. Movement patterns between 2 and 3 indicate the movement of the container inside the container ship\u2019s hull. Herein, only the movement between 2 and 3 will be discussed, because the majority of security threats occur there.\nFigure 8 demonstrates the movement directions of the spreader of the quay crane.

Each of the five examples demonstrates similar movement patterns along all three movement axes. Therefore, it is concluded that most transportation processes and their dynamic properties have similarities and can be analyzed using a common method. In Figure 9, the blue line indicates acceleration along the X-axis; the red line indicates acceleration along the Y-axis; and the yellow line indicates acceleration along the Z-axis. Figure 10 shows the path of the container inside the ship from the first example provided in Figure 9. It can be observed that at the start of the procedure the accelerations values along the X and Y axes rose with each new movement, up until a certain point at around the 400 ms timestamp. They then decreased by a certain degree and reached a stable level, mostly due to constant interactions with the cell guides, sliding and hitting them in many areas.

They then decreased by a certain degree and reached a stable level, mostly due to constant interactions with the cell guides, sliding and hitting them in many areas.\nFigure 8.

Statistical analysis is used to determine the threshold. It finds the distribution function that best describes the peak values.

Results and Discussion The results show that the proposed solution can identify impacts to the vertical cell guides for each hold, and for each individual cell. A combination of the proposed methodology and the developed IoT device can detect critical impacts, filtering the signals according to the proposed threshold detection rule and logging the data for future use by the managers of the operations or sending critical alert information to the operators on site for predictive maintenance and possible damage evaluation, utilizing best practices from the adoption of the most suitable industrial wireless communication technologies. The convenience and effectiveness of the proposed vertical cell guide damage detection system could provide great advantages in largescale environments, enabling statistics to be gathered for each ship, while also proving logistics companies with critical information about possible damages to the goods inside the containers during the same impacts, drastically increasing the viability of these operations. Each impact event takes place over tens of milliseconds, while sliding events that occur along the vertical cell guides occur at time scales of a few seconds. Furthermore, the measured signals are contaminated by noise components from several other naturally occurring and unnatural processes extraneous to the natural motion of the container, including the quay crane and spreader dynamics, as well as environmental and electronic noise. This vast disparity in time scales, as well as the issues with signal contamination, pose serious signal processing and de-noising challenges for conventional methods, operating in harsh working conditions.

This vast disparity in time scales, as well as the issues with signal contamination, pose serious signal processing and de-noising challenges for conventional methods, operating in harsh working conditions. However, theoretically, these challenges can be effectively addressed through a combination of several separate system, with novel and known algorithms in a unified methodology. We tested several frequency ranges for the weighted values of potential events and RMS, and selected the best, as determined via the selective analysis provided in the methodology section. When the containers are lifted out of the ship\u2019s holds, they oscillate at a harmonic frequency. The frequency range between 0.4 Hz and 2.5 Hz has been determined for the specific cases of our physical experiment in the port of Klaipeda. However, the free space for the containers to move is very limited by the surrounding infrastructure and the vertical cell guides, meaning the contacts of the container with the guides generates oscillations with higher frequency components. In our case study, our proposed impact detection methodology analyzed the oscillation frequency range starting from 3.8 Hz. After setting the threshold at 78%, our method was able to detect the known impacts, which occurred an average of 12.8 times, without filtering the less important sliding effects that sometimes occur with each new impact. After close examination of other additional case studies, also shown in Figure 8, we obtained almost identical results; with the threshold set at 78%, the number of detected impacts varied from 6.8 to 14.6, due to different depths of the holds.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2752 23 of 26\nOur results indicate that it is possible to detect not only the impacts themselves but also the exact place and moment at which they occurred. This methodology was developed using historical data from a case study for true threshold detection. The methodological efficiency could be refined if a larger data set were used during the evaluation process, consisting of full-cycle operations, along with modified standards for the entire ship. In this way, if applied globally, it would be possible to detect a vast range of security events, monitoring the containers and the cargo, the handling infrastructure, and the different transport means. This solution can be used primarily in predictive maintenance and other decision support systems. However, for such an application, this methodology would need to be refined from the perspective of a single handling cycle for events detection. This proposed solution can be used for the risk assessment of a single container hold. The main advantage of this type of system its ability to track repeated impacts that occur with each individual cell. This allows sufficient data to be collected to enable adequate decision-making using the proposed methodology."

            "text": "The results show that the proposed methodology can identify impacts to the vertical cell guides. In our case study, we managed to detect 12.8 impacts on average during the handling of the container from the bottom of the hold. The proposed methodology adopted a 78% threshold, but the origin of the rest of the impacts still remains to be analyzed. The acquired data from the sensory unit and the impact results were presented to the personnel of the terminal, and the common discussions highlighted the strategic problem of vertical cell guide wear resulting from impacts, an issue that had previously received inadequate attention from the company and its personnel. Our research aim with the container terminal company was to detect these impacts as they continually occur within the same holds throughout the full unloading cycle of a ship, classifying different events and types of impacts (pattern detection), and providing the personnel of the terminal with more in-depth and reliable information about these critical incidents. Our future research will further examine the following aspects: increased reflection on the security and synchronization of the physical space during the entire process, taking into consideration other berths and transport means; and increased focus on any correlations between historical and real-time sensory data in order to improve the quality of the estimation results and the level of fidelity for each individual handling process. Regarding the IoT device, we intend to further optimize the data sampling technique locally, improving the Edge computing paradigm, while lowering its power consumption and computational strain, and promoting efficient wireless communication innovations. A new real-time monitoring system will be developed based on the existing prototype and methodology, and may be integrated into the Klaipeda city LKAB \u201cSmelte\u201d container terminal management system (as a sub-section of predictive maintenance and repairs). Finally, it is necessary to qualify the degree of detection accuracy with regards to the severity of any impacts with the vertical cell guides in order to support intelligent decision-making for the entire port operation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.J. and M.V.; methodology, M.V. and T.E.; software, P.P. and J.T.; validation, M.J. and P.P.; formal analysis, S.J. and T.E.; investigation, M.V.; resources, M.J. and V.J.; data curation, T.E.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.J.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.V.; visualization, V.J., P.P. and J.T.; supervision, S.J.; project administration, S.J.; funding acquisition, S.J.
