The modulation can occur as a response to pathological processes or pharmacological intervention. The receptor density can be monitored by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) of [11C] raclopride. To obtain accurate measurements of receptor-ligand interaction, it is essential to estimate binding parameters at true (if transient) equilibrium of bound and unbound ligand quantities. We designed this study as a comparison of two quantitative approaches to transient equilibrium, the TRansient EquilibriuM BoLus Estimation (TREMBLE) method and the Transient Equilibrium Model (TEM) method, to determine binding parameters at transient equilibrium with bolus injection of the radioligand. The data demonstrates that TREMBLE unlike TEM identified the time at which equilibrium existed. TREMBLE revealed that equilibrium prevailed at one or more times after bolus injection and identified differences of receptor density among regions such as putamen and caudate nucleus. We demonstrated that TREMBLE is a quantitative approach suitable for the study of pathophysiological conditions of certain types of neurotransmission the brain.\nKEYWORDS\nreceptor density, dopamine receptor, positron emission tomography, raclopride, bolus injection\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "The D2/D3 dopaminergic receptor antagonist [11C] raclopride has been widely used to study the dopaminergic system by means of in vivo PET since 1985, when the tracer was introduced for the first time for human brain studies (1). The radioligand [11C] raclopride binds with high selectivity to D2/D3 receptors, and the binding is inhibited by challenge from endogenous dopamine (DA) (2,3) and other dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists (4). Thus, [11C] raclopride satisfies pharmacological criteria of application to studies of dopaminergic neurotransmission and receptor occupancy by drugs.\nDopamine mediates its physiological action through five subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, D1-D5 with subtypes. Particularly, the D2/D3 receptors are highly expressed in brain areas critical for motor control, mesolimbic function, and memory processing, such as striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and hippocampus [reviewed in Beaulieu and Gainetdinov (5)]. Therefore, dopaminergic signalling at these receptors is of special interest to neurological disorders with dysregulated dopaminergic transmission, including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and schizophrenia among others (6,7). Deficient dopaminergic transmission is one of the main underlying causes of motor impairment in PD, and post-mortem examinations have shown that the loss of dopamine is regionally heterogeneous, with greater loss in putamen than in caudate nucleus (8). Patients with PD display correspondingly greater D2/D3 receptor binding in putamen than in caudate nucleus, suggesting compensatory upregulation in response to dopamine deficiency (9).\nContrary to the dopaminergic deficits observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease, increased dopaminergic activity is held to be an underlying pathophysiological characteristic of schizophrenia, as shown both by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET studies, in which amphetamine administration evokes greater dopamine release in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy control\nFrontiers in Nuclear Medicine 02\nsubjects (3,10\u201313). Interestingly, the magnitude of dopamine release in striatum evoked by amphetamine correlates significantly with changes of symptom severity on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (3), and the rate of dopamine synthesis is higher in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy control subjects, as determined by means of PET with 3,4-dihydroxy-6-(18)F-fluoro-lphenylalanine (FDOPA) (14).\nTo examine pathophysiology and effect of treatment by PET, it is necessary to estimate receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (1=KD) separately rather than binding potential. The necessity arises from the long-term modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission that is known to lead to adaptive changes of the receptor system, as originally shown by early reports of autoradiography revealing increased D2 receptor density in striatum by experimental administration of a selective D2 antagonist (15,16).\nThe binding potential term originally introduced to PET quantification by Mintun et al. (17) as an equilibrium parameter reflects the ratio of bound to unbound radioligand that equals the product of the density of receptors without ligand and the affinity of the ligand (B0maxK 1 D ). Therefore, long-term modulation that alters the receptor density is reflected in the binding potential estimate. Of the several formulations of the binding potential, the term for the binding potential relative to non-displaceable binding in a region (BPND) was introduced by Innis et al. (18).\nTrue receptor density and affinity must be determined at equilibrium with Eadie-Hofstee or Scatchard graphical analysis based on at least two levels of receptor occupancy. The gold standard of true albeit transient equilibrium in PET was achieved by continuous infusion of a radioligand that maintained a constant concentration in brain (19). However, continuous delivery of ligand experimentally is more difficult and any infusion conditions may not be more generalizable to all subjects in any given population than bolus injection approach. Therefore, quantitative kinetic models have been applied to bolus injection where the possible departure from the steady-state by continuous infusions are not an experimental limitation. The TRansient EquilibriuM BoLus Estimation (TREMBLE) method is an approach that yields the quantity of specifically bound radioligand on the assumption that the bound ligand reaches an equilibrium state at specific time points after bolus injection (20,21). The approach uses the radiolabelled metabolite-corrected plasma concentration of radioligand to specifically differentiate displaceable from nondisplaceable receptor bound quantities of the radioligand, as derived in subsection I of the Appendix below.\nTo avoid the demand for arterial blood sampling, several approaches were presented in the past that apply an alternative reference region-derived input. One example is the Transient Equilibrium Model (TEM) that uses a reference region, e.g., the cerebellum, as an approximation of\nfrontiersin.org\nthe tracer input from the activity in a region of nondisplaceable binding (22), as derived in subsection II in the Appendix below. Both TREMBLE and TEM were designed to identify time points of transient equilibrium, as derived below in the Appendix. The aim of the present study was to compare the two approaches for quantification of D2=D3 receptor density using [11C] raclopride binding in healthy human brain."

For the TEM analysis, we used the activity of the reference region (mREF) as an approximation of the unbound and non-displaceable tracer quantity in brain. For the TREMBLE analysis, we computed the equivalent exchangeable quantity (me) from the measured arterial plasma input concentrations. The computed curve of me initially was higher in the challenge condition than at baseline, suggesting a greater exchangeable quantity of [11C] raclopride as a result of displacement by unlabeled raclopride. This phenomenon was not observed with the TEM analysis.\nThe population average of the contents of respective compartments in putamen are shown in Figure 2. The population averaged curves consistently displayed the same time course pattern as curves of the single representative subject. In the challenge condition, at 0\u201320 min, the accumulation of ligand in the exchangeable compartment (me) exceeded that of the baseline condition, after which time the me curves approached similar levels in both conditions (Figure 2C). We considered the initially higher me quantity during the challenge condition a result of the lower receptor availability of receptors blocked by unlabeled ligand. This\nFrontiers in Nuclear Medicine 04\nbehavior of the exchangeable quantity was detected by the TREMBLE analysis but not by the TEM analysis.\nChallenge with non-radiolabeled raclopride significantly reduced the estimates of BPND by the two methods (Figure 3). The average reductions of the BPND estimates averaged 61+ 17% and 63+ 6% (mean+ SD) in putamen by TREMBLE and TEM, respectively. As the two models yielded similar reductions of BPND, we asked whether a scalable difference existed between the results of the two methods. We compared the percentage declines in each subject by TREMBLE and TEM (Figure 3C) and found no consistent pattern, implying that the outcomes of TREMBLE and TEM yield random differences.\nWith the estimates of specific binding (Mb,M b ) and binding potential (BPND) at two occupancy levels in the absence and presence of unlabelled raclopride, we applied Eadie-Hofstee plots to obtain the receptor density, Bmax , and half-saturation constant, KD, as presented in Figures 4A,B and subsection IV in the Appendix below. Comparison of receptor densities in Figure 4C revealed that TREMBLE detected a regional difference of Bmax with significantly higher density in putamen (26:7+ 11:9 pmol/cm3) than in caudate nucleus (18+ 8:9 pmol/cm3). In contrast, analysis with TEM yielded no difference of receptor density between the two parts of the striatum. Figure 4D shows the same values of KD in the two brain regions, regardless of analysis method.\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Population averaged time-activities in specific compartments of the putamen.

The arrows indicate the time of transient equilibrium (db/dt=0). The bound quantity as calculated with TEM is denoted with a star (m b), whereas mb without annotation reflects the bound quantity as computed with TREMBLE. Notably, the magnitude of exchangeable quantity (me) was initially greater at challenge condition compared to baseline (panel (C) middle). For all the curves, the solid lines show the population mean and the shaded areas indicate the standard deviation.\nWe examined the dynamic time courses of the apparent BPND estimates over time of bothmodels, because the result of the EadieHofstee plot reflects the magnitude of BPND. Interestingly, TREMBLE revealed that estimates of BPND reached a plateau at approximately 20 minutes after bolus injection when dmb=dt \u00bc 0 (Figures 5A and B). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that peaks or troughs identified by TREMBLE mark the times of true transient equilibrium. The apparent constant magnitudes of BPND reflect the times when the ratios of bound-to-free ligand quantities are sustained for longer intervals. In contrast, the apparent values of BPND continuously rose for 40 minutes when quantified by TEM.\nBecause the estimations of mv and me by TREMBLE is influenced by the magnitudes of two constants, V0 and Ve (Eqs. A1 and A5), we examined if the constants were affected by challenge with unlabeled raclopride. As shown in Figures 6A and B, the constants were not affected by the unlabelled raclopride."

Although, the averages of BPND decreased significantly upon blocking with unlabeled raclopride according to both methods, the individual estimates of BPND, Bmax and KD by the two models were not related.\nValues of Bmax and KD obtained by the Eadie-Hofstee plot of TEM data match the results of previous PET studies that included TEM analysis (see Table 1 for a summary). In the present study, the TEM analysis yielded no significant difference of receptor density between the regions of putamen and caudate nucleus. In contrast, TREMBLE analysis of the same dataset showed a significantly greater receptor density of putamen than caudate nucleus.\nFrom the PET studies listed in Table 1, Farde et al. (25) and Rinne et al. (26) reported the D2/D3 dopamine receptor density of putamen and caudate nucleus in healthy subjects obtained by application of TEM analysis and Scatchard plots. Farde et al. (25) reported 25% higher density in putamen than caudate nucleus, while the difference reported by Rinne et al. (26) was as low as 10%. In other studies of the receptor density with TEM analysis, the authors merged the subregions and reported densities in striatum that are comparable with the results of the present TEM analysis.\nfrontiersin.org\nIt was not clear from previous PET studies whether the density of D2/D3 receptors is higher in putamen than in caudate nucleus. Therefore, we compared the present results with data from in vitro autoradiography in healthy humans, presented in (Table 2). To make the comparison with in vitro studies possible, we converted the density per unit wet weight to density per unit dry weight of protein. Under the assumption that brain tissue contains 10% solid material, conversion of wet to dry weight units uses division by 10 (36). The autoradiography studies listed in Table 2 support considerably higher density in putamen than in caudate nucleus. As the studies were performed in vitro and with other ligands of the D2/D3 receptors, the results are not numerically translatable. However, the comparison of the relative regional difference shows that results from TREMBLE are consistent with data obtained by autoradiography.\nFrontiers in Nuclear Medicine 06\nWe also compared the values of BPND from the TEM and TREMBLE analyses of this study with the results reported in the literature. The Eadie-Hofstee regression is driven by the magnitudes of BPND and the bound quantity of tracer (Mb or M b , depending on method). Table 3 lists the publications that included values of BPND obtained by linear regression methods, including the reference region version of the Logan plot (42) and the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM) (43). The publications listed in Table 3 consistently report greater values of BPND in putamen than in caudate nucleus, with a difference of 20\u201330% that matches the results of TREMBLE. The lack of a difference between estimates of BPND for the two striatal regions with TEM analysis can be attributed to the use of cerebellum activity in TEM as an approximation of non-specifically bound ligand in regions of binding. Instead, the correct\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Estimates from Eadie-Hofstee plots. Eadie-Hofstee plots of putamen and caudate nucleus computed by TEM (A) and by TREMBLE (B).

Notably, the time of steady-state coincided with the time, where BPND approached a constant level as determined by TREMBLE.\nFrontiers in Nuclear Medicine 07 frontiersin.org\nestimate of unbound ligand in a region of specific binding depends on the number of receptors available. When receptors are blocked, the quantity of unbound ligand increases as the receptor availability declines. Thus, the use of cerebellum activity as an estimate of unbound and nondisplaceable ligand in the computation of specific binding is erroneous. Ito and colleagues (44) simulated a study to characterise the error associated with the use of cerebellum activity in TEM instead of the real plasma input function.\nFrontiers in Nuclear Medicine 09\nThe authors demonstrated that TEM caused larger errors and led to overestimation of the values of BPND when the assumed magnitudes of BPND and K1 both were low, and the authors also demonstrated mathematically that the concentration in cerebellum equals the free unbound and non-specifically bound ligand at the time of steady-state, but dm b=dt is not equal to zero and the bound ligand therefore is not at equilibrium at the time of steady-state identified by the TEM analysis.\nfrontiersin.org\nNotably, theapparentvaluesofBPND computedwithTREMBLE in the present study (Figures 5A andB) approached aconstant value at the timewhendmb=dt \u00bc 0.Theprolongedconstant ratiobetween bound and free ligand quantities with TREMBLE analysis strongly supports the contention that TREMBLE identifies the ultimately transient equilibrium that persisted for some time after bolus injection. Determination of BPND at equilibrium is crucial to obtain valid estimates of the binding potential that is defined only at instances of true equilibrium (17). Thus, identification of the time of equilibrium is critical to accurate and reproducible quantification of the values of Bmax and KD.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that the TREMBLE method yields valid estimates of receptor-ligand interaction at true (albeit transient) equilibrium after bolus injection of tracer. This conclusion would also apply to to experiments based on bolus-plus-infusion of the tracer, The reason is that the bolusplus-infusion experiments focus on the establishment of constant concentrations of all tracer molecules in the tissue, rather than on the requirement of constant levels of bound tracer associated with true equilibrium, a goal that is very difficult to reach. A disadvantage of TREMBLE is the requirement for arterial plasma concentration sampling that makes clinical studies labor intensive, but the approach is important to the detection of moderate changes as found especially in neuropsychiatric disorders, for example."

As illustrated in Figure A1, the kinetic model describes two simultaneous dynamics, the tracer transfer from the plasma compartment (mv) to the exchangeable tissue compartment (me) and to a separate compartment of specifically bound tracer (mb). The first order differential equation describes the distribution in the vascular compartment,\ndmv(t) dt \u00bc V0 dca\u00f0t\u00dedt , (A1)\nwhere mb is the mass of ligand detectable by the tomograph and V0 denotes the volume of the vascular bed, and ca\u00f0t\u00de is the timevariable concentration in plasma.

To avoid the uncertainty of many variables, the fundamental aim of the analysis is to identify the quantity in an intermediate compartment me that controls the exchange of ligands with subsequent compartments. Only in the initial phase of an tomography session is the quantity of ligand bound to receptors is negligible, and only then is the flux of ligand is controlled by the concentration gradient between plasma and brain tissue.

In this calculation, it is assumed that the free quantities in tissue and in plasma have equal magnitudes in mREF and mROI. As in TREMBLE, quantity of specifically bound ligand then is obtained in TEM at the time of transient equilibrium when the first derivative dm b(t)=dt equals zero. The equilibrium binding potential in TEM is determined from the ratio of the bound quantity in a region of binding and the total quantity of tracer in the reference region,\nBPND (TEM) \u00bc M b\nMREF : (A20)\nwhere it is important to note that the binding potential obtained by TREMBLE in principle therefore is different from the\nfrontiersin.org"

Panel (A) shows a overview of the percentage of blocked receptors (s) induced by challenge in all subjects. The coloured points highlight the excluded subjects denoted as Ex 1-3. These particular subjects were excluded because their mb curves in the TREMBLE analysis were fluctuating around zero, leading to incorrect BPND estimates. When the degree of blocked receptors exceeded 75%, the estimate of Bmax became unreliable because of inaccurate BPND values. The dashed line in (A) indicates the threshold separating outliers due to excessive receptor blocking. Panel (B) illustrate the three analogous plots, which are designed to determine receptor occupancy, including Inhibition (51,52), Saturation (53) and Occupancy (54) plots, as recently summarized by presented by Khodaii et al.
