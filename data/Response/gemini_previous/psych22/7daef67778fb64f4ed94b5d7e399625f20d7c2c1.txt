1. **Investigate the long-term effects of AADs on autistic children and their families.** The current study only examined the effects of AADs over a relatively short period of time (8-12 weeks). It would be beneficial to conduct a longitudinal study to examine the long-term effects of AADs on autistic children and their families. This would help to determine whether the positive effects of AADs are maintained over time.


2. **Compare the effects of AADs to other types of interventions for autism.** There are a variety of different interventions available for autism, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), speech therapy, and occupational therapy. It would be helpful to conduct a study to compare the effects of AADs to these other types of interventions. This would help to determine which interventions are most effective for autistic children and their families.


3. **Examine the mechanisms by which AADs exert their effects.** The current study did not examine the mechanisms by which AADs exert their effects. It would be beneficial to conduct a study to investigate the mechanisms by which AADs improve the lives of autistic children and their families. This would help to develop more effective interventions for autism.


4. **Explore the use of AADs for other populations with disabilities.** AADs have been shown to be beneficial for autistic children and their families. It would be beneficial to explore the use of AADs for other populations with disabilities, such as children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, or traumatic brain injury. This would help to determine whether AADs can be beneficial for a wider range of individuals with disabilities.


5. **Develop guidelines for the use of AADs for autism.** There are currently no guidelines for the use of AADs for autism. It would be beneficial to develop guidelines to help families and professionals determine whether an AAD is appropriate for a particular child. This would help to ensure that AADs are used appropriately and effectively.
