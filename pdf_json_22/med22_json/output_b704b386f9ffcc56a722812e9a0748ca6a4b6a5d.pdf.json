    "abstractText": "Bupivacaine, a local anaesthetic, is widely applied in the epidural or subarachnoid space to clinically manage acute and chronic pain. However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and unclear. Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) in the spinal cord plays a critical role in various pathologic pain conditions. Therefore, we sought to determine whether bupivacaine exerts its analgesic effect by regulating GlyT1 expression and to determine the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Primary astrocytes prepared from the spinal cord of rats were treated with bupivacaine. The protein levels of GlyT1, brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated adenosine 5\u2032\u2010monophosphate (AMP)\u2010activated protein kinase \u03b1 (p\u2010AMPK\u03b1) were measured by western blotting or immunofluorescence. In addition, 7,8\u2010dihydroxyflavone (7,8\u2010DHF, BDNF receptor agonist) and AMPK shRNA were applied to verify the relationship between the regulation of GlyT1 by bupivacaine and the p\u2010AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway. After treatment with bupivacaine, GlyT1 expression was diminished in a concentration\u2010dependent manner, while the expression of BDNF and p\u2010AMPK was increased. Moreover, 7,8\u2010DHF decreased GlyT1 expression, and AMPK knockdown suppressed the upregulation of BDNF expression by bupivacaine. Finally, we concluded that bupivacaine reduced GlyT1 expression in spinal astrocytes by activating the p\u2010AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway. These results provide a new mechanism for the analgesic effect of intrathecal bupivacaine in the treatment of acute and chronic pain.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and unclear. Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) in the spinal cord plays a critical role in various pathologic pain conditions. Therefore, we sought to determine whether bupivacaine exerts its analgesic effect by regulating GlyT1 expression and to determine the underlying mechanisms of regulation. Primary astrocytes prepared from the spinal cord of rats were treated with bupivacaine. The protein levels of GlyT1, brain\u2011derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated adenosine 5\u2032\u2011monophosphate (AMP)\u2011activated protein kinase \u03b1 (p\u2011AMPK\u03b1) were measured by western blotting or immunofluorescence. In addition, 7,8\u2011dihydroxyflavone (7,8\u2011DHF, BDNF receptor agonist) and AMPK shRNA were applied to verify the relationship between the regulation of GlyT1 by bupivacaine and the p\u2011AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway. After treatment with bupivacaine, GlyT1 expression was diminished in a concentration\u2011dependent manner, while the expression of BDNF and p\u2011AMPK was increased. Moreover, 7,8\u2011DHF decreased GlyT1 expression, and AMPK knockdown suppressed the upregulation of BDNF expression by bupivacaine. Finally, we concluded that bupivacaine reduced GlyT1 expression in spinal astrocytes by activating the p\u2011AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway. These results provide a new mechanism for the analgesic effect of intrathecal bupivacaine in the treatment of acute and chronic pain.\nIntrathecal bupivacaine is considered a treatment option in acute and chronic pain management1\u20133. However, the underlying mechanisms are more complex than simply blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels. Bupivacaine, in addition to blocking sodium channels, also affects the activity of many other membrane proteins and channels4\u20136. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that local anaesthetic can diminish glycine uptake mediated by glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1)7,8, which plays an important role in neuropathic pain. However, it is unclear whether the analgesic mechanism of intrathecal bupivacaine is related to the regulation of GlyT1 expression.\nGlycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and controls motor and sensory signal transduction. The glycine concentration in the synaptic cleft is strictly controlled by glycine transporters (GlyTs), including GlyT1 and GlyT2. GlyT1 is mainly expressed in astrocytes but also reported in neurons, whereas GlyT2 is exclusively expressed in glycinergic neurons9. At glycinergic synapses, GlyT1 plays a role in the removal of glycine from the synaptic cleft, while GlyT2 transports glycine from the synaptic cleft back into glycinergic neuron terminals. In addition, GlyT1 mediates excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission by removing glycine from the glutamatergic synaptic cleft10.\nThe important role of glycine inhibitory neurotransmission in central pain control has been demonstrated11. Increasing evidence suggests that the activity of inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord is compromised in neuropathic and inflammatory pain states12, and restoring this inhibition can reverse pain sensitivity. Likewise, the facilitation of inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission through GlyT inhibition has become a potential novel\nOPEN\n1Department of Anesthesiology, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China. 2Department of Anesthesiology, People\u2019s Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Yinchuan 750004, China. 3Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China. 4Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China. 5These authors contributed equally: Jianqiang Yu and Hanxiang Ma. *email: YujqLab@163.com; mahanxiang@hotmail.com\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:1378 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05478-3\ntreatment of acute and chronic pain13\u201316. In particular, inhibition of GlyT1 not only promotes glycine concentration in the glycine synaptic cleft but also reduces the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the glutamate synapse to ameliorate neuropathic pain17.\nGlyT1 expression is modulated by various factors, one of which is that BDNF promotes GlyT1 endocytosis and degradation and inhibits GlyT1-mediated glycine uptake18. BDNF is one of the major neurotrophic factors in the development, maturation, and maintenance of the CNS. Moreover, it modulates the morphology of astrocytes by interacting with tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB)19,20. Furthermore, BDNF expression is controlled by p-AMPK\u03b1 in the CNS21,22. AMPK is an important intracellular energy sensor involved in energy metabolism. The specific phosphorylation of AMPK can activate transcriptional regulators to affect protein expression. Furthermore, local anaesthetics have been demonstrated to activate AMPK23\u201325.\nTherefore, we speculated that bupivacaine might decrease GlyT1 expression by activating the p-AMPK\u03b1/ BDNF signalling pathway. To verify this hypothesis, we used primary astrocytes from the rat spinal cord to study the effect of bupivacaine on GlyT1, and the expression levels of GlyT1, BDNF, and p-AMPK\u03b1 were detected in astrocytes after treatment with bupivacaine. In addition, we used 7,8-DHF or AMPK shRNA to modulate related protein expression. Finally, the results supported our hypothesis that bupivacaine decreased GlyT1 expression in astrocytes, which was associated with the activation of the p-AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway. Thus, modulation of GlyT1 expression might represent a novel mechanism for the antinociceptive action of intrathecal bupivacaine."

In addition, the most significant decrease in GlyT1 expression was in the 3\u00a0mM bupivacaine group.

LV- AMPK-shRNA (shRNA1, shRNA2, shRNA3) was used to knock down AMPK expression, and LV-scrambled\u2013shRNA was used as a negative control. qPCR showed that shRNA1 had the strongest inhibition of AMPK expression (***p < 0.001) (Fig.\u00a0 4A). Therefore, shRNA1 was used for AMPK knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4B, shRNA1 significantly reversed the bupivacaine-induced increase in BDNF mRNA expression (***p < 0.001, ###p < 0.001). In addition, treatment with shRNA1 reversed the bupivacaine-induced increase in BDNF protein expression (*p < 0.05, #p < 0.05, Fig.\u00a04C).

In the CNS, GlyT1 was predominantly expressed in astrocytes, so primary astrocytes derived from the rat spinal cord were studied. Finally, we found that bupivacaine reduced GlyT1 expression in spinal astrocytes, which was associated with the potentiation of the p-AMPK\u03b1/BDNF signalling pathway.\nThe analgesic effects of intrathecal bupivacaine have been described but cannot be explained solely by its blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels. In addition to blocking Na+ channels, bupivacaine can also modulate many other membrane proteins, such as NMDA receptors26,27, nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-HT3A receptors28.\nFigure\u00a02.

However, it has not yet been established whether the antinociceptive mechanism of intrathecal bupivacaine is related to GlyT1 regulation. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of bupivacaine on GlyT1 in\u00a0vitro to elucidate the possible mechanism of the analgesic effect of intrathecal bupivacaine.\nThe restoration of inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission in the spinal cord plays a crucial role in the treatment of pathologic pain30,31. Glycinergic neurotransmission is controlled by GlyT1 and GlyT2. GlyT1 affects glycinergic neurotransmission by removing the glycine concentration at the glycinergic synaptic cleft, while GlyT2 mediates the reuptake of glycine into glycinergic nerve terminals. Inhibitions of GlyT1 and GlyT2 both have significant therapeutic effects on various pathologic pain conditions32. In particular, inhibition of GlyT1 can attenuate neuropathic pain by priming NMDA receptors for internalization17,33,34. In addition, it has been established that GlyT1 inhibitors can relieve pain sensitivity in different neuropathic pain models. This phenomenon is related to the enhancement of glycinergic neurotransmission and the inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission. A study in rats demonstrated that sciatic nerve constriction injury\u2013induced neuropathic pain was attenuated by intrathecal GlyT1 inhibitors35. In addition, Armbruster et\u00a0al.36 found that GlyT1 inhibition by intraperitoneal or oral bitopertin (GlyT1 inhibitor) could effectively alleviate hyperalgesia in rats with neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, in sciatic nerve ligation injury-induced neuropathic pain models, mechanical allodynia was ameliorated by intrathecal sarcosine (GlyT1 inhibitor) and GlyT1 knockdown of the spinal cord of mice37. The authors of these studies concluded that inhibition of GlyT1 in the spinal cord represents a new therapy for neuropathic pain. In this study, we found that bupivacaine dose-dependently reduced GlyT1 expression in spinal astrocytes at concentrations reported in previous studies4,5. According to\nFigure\u00a03.

Nevertheless, whether bupivacaine could regulate GlyT2 has to be elucidated in further investigations.\nIt has been reported that many factors affect GlyT1 expression in astrocytes. Aroeira et\u00a0al. reported that BDNF promoted GlyT1 internalization and degradation and suppressed GlyT1-mediated glycine uptake in astrocytes by acting on TrkB receptors18. Several investigations have been conducted to demonstrate that the\nFigure\u00a04. AMPK shRNA reversed the increase in BDNF by bupivacaine.

Additionally, another study proposed that calmodulin was involved in the regulation of GlyT1 surface expression and GlyT1-mediated glycine uptake39. In our study, we found that bupivacaine increased the expression of BDNF and decreased GlyT1 expression in astrocytes. Moreover, GlyT1 expression in astrocytes was reduced by 7,8-DHF. Therefore, we concluded that bupivacaine reduced GlyT1 expression by upregulating BDNF expression in astrocytes. However, whether bupivacaine reduces GlyT1 expression by modulating PKC or calmodulin remains to be studied.\nBDNF is one of the major neurotrophic factors produced by astrocytes to maintain the development and survival of neurons in the CNS. A previous study demonstrated that BDNF protected astrocytes from death through the TrkB signalling pathway and induced astrocytes to release neuroprotective factors40. In addition, BDNF plays an important role in astrocyte morphogenesis via astrocytic TrkB receptors20,41,42. Furthermore, many investigations have indicated that the expression of BDNF in brain astrocytes is promoted by the activation of AMPK43,44. AMPK is expressed ubiquitously and is a key regulator of metabolic pathways such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis45. AMPK is also active in CNS, and the activation of AMPK plays a neuroprotective or neurodegenerative role46,47. AMPK activation is regulated by various factors, previous studies have shown that AMPK is phosphorylated and activated by two major upstream kinases LKB1 and CAMKK\u03b2 in response to stimuli that increase intracellular AMP/ADP or calcium levels48. It has been reported that local anaesthetics have activating effects on AMPK7,23. Consistent with their findings, our study established that bupivacaine activated AMPK in spinal astrocytes, and bupivacaine increased BDNF expression by AMPK activation. But the mechanism of AMPK activation by bupivacaine remains to be further studied.\nIn conclusion, bupivacaine decreased GlyT1 expression in spinal astrocytes by potentiating the p-AMPK\u03b1/ BDNF signalling pathway. GlyT1 inhibition of bupivacaine on spinal astrocytes provides a new molecular mechanism for the analgesic effect of intrathecal bupivacaine. However, whether the mechanism of the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal bupivacaine is consistent with our in\u00a0vitro study needs to be further clarified."

Treatment with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a specific TrkB receptor (one of the BDNF receptors) agonists, mimicked the physiological effects of BDNF. It was purchased from MedChemExpress. Bupivacaine was diluted to 1\u00a0mM, 2\u00a0mM, and 3\u00a0mM with DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.5% FBS and then treated with primary astrocytes for 2\u00a0h. The concentration of bupivacaine was determined according to the research of Huang et\u00a0al. 24. Moreover, 7,8-DHF was diluted to 5\u00a0ng/mL, 10\u00a0ng/mL, and 20\u00a0ng/mL with DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.5% FBS and administered to primary astrocytes for 2\u00a0h. The concentration of 7,8-DHF was determined by CCK-8 assays for cell viability (see Supplementary Fig S6). Then, various experimental tests were carried out.\nCell transfection with shRNA. For knockdown of AMPK, the primary astrocytes were transfected with lentivirus vector containing AMPK short hairpin RNA and a green fluorescent protein expression marker (LVAMPK-shRNA\u2013green fluorescent protein; 5 \u00d7 108 TU/mL) to knock down AMPK expression and transfected with lentivirus expression vector containing scrambled\u2013short hairpin RNA\u2013green fluorescent protein (LVscrambled\u2013shRNA\u2013green fluorescent protein; 5 \u00d7 108 TU/mL) as a negative control. The nucleotide sequences of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting AMPK were as follows: 5\u2019-GCC GAC TTC GGT CTT TCA AAC-3\u2019 (shRNA1), 5\u2019-GGA CTA TGA ATG GAA GGT TG T-3\u2019 (shRNA2), and 5\u2019-GCA ACA AGC CCA CCC GAT TCT-3\u2019 (shRNA3). A scrambled sequence was also designed as a negative control (Scram): 5\u2019-TTC TCC GAA CGTGT CACGT-3\u2019 (Scram). The lentivirus vectors were designed and generated by Genomeditech (Shanghai, China).\nPrimary astrocytes were diluted to a density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells/ml, seeded in new plates and incubated until 70\u201380% confluent cells were reached. The viral vector containing shRNA was diluted to the corresponding concentration according to MOI = 50 and incubated with primary astrocytes for 48\u00a0h. Then, follow-up experiments\n7 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:1378 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05478-3\nwere performed after 48\u00a0h of cell recovery. This method was used to knock down AMPK expression in primary astrocytes.\nQuantitative real\u2011time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from astrocyte cultures by using a Total RNA Mini Isolation Kit (Axygen; Corning Incorporated, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The cDNA templates were synthesized by the One-Step gDNA Removal kit (TransGen Biotech, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All real-time PCRs were performed using TransStart TipTop Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech, China) and carried out by a Jena quantitative PCR instrument (qTOWER2.0, Jena, Germany). The list of specific primers applied for amplifying genes is shown in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. The relative gene expression values were calculated using the comparative 2-\u0394\u0394Cq method, and GAPDH was used as a control.\nWestern blotting analysis. Primary cultured astrocytes were lysed in lysis buffer (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30\u00a0min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected for protein quantification by the BCA protein assay (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China). The protein extracts with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer were heated in a 100\u00a0\u00b0C water bath for 10\u00a0min. The samples (40\u00a0\u03bcg sample-1) were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE for electrophoresis, and then, the gel that contained the proteins was cut according to the protein molecular size. Next, the same proteins come from two pieces of gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBS-T; 10\u00a0mmol litre-1 Tris\u2013HCl, 150\u00a0mmol litre-1 NaCl, 0.1% Tween; pH 8.0) for 2\u00a0h. Next, the membrane was probed overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibodies including rabbit antiGlyT1 (1:500; Proteintech Group, Inc.), rabbit anti-BDNF (1:500; Proteintech Group, Inc.), rabbit anti-AMPK\u03b1 (1:500; Proteintech Group, Inc.), and rabbit anti-p-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) (1:500; Affinity Biosciences, Inc.), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; Proteintech Group, Inc.) for 2\u00a0h. Blots were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and the protein bands were quantified by Quantity One software version 4.6.2. Normalization was performed with GAPDH expression.\nImmunofluorescence staining and microscopy. For immunocytochemistry assays, primary astrocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. All the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum in 0.01\u00a0mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with 0.3% Triton-X-100 for 2\u00a0g\u00a0h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibodies, including mouse anti-GlyT1 (1:25; Proteintech Group, Inc.), mouse anti-BDNF (1:50; Proteintech Group, Inc.), and rabbit anti-p-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) (1:50; Affinity Biosciences, Inc.). Then, the cells were incubated with TRITC\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or FITC\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Proteintech Group, Inc.) for 2\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were sealed with an antifluorescence attenuating tablet containing DAPI. Omission of the primary antibody served as a negative control. Images were captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (FluoView FV 1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was applied to quantify the fluorescence intensity of images, and GraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used to generate graphs.\nStatistical analysis. Data were analysed using SPSS 22.0 statistical software. All data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. All experiments were repeated at least three times. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the means of multiple samples. Statistical significance of the results was defined at p < 0.05.\nEthics approval and consent to participate. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningxia Medical University (date from 2021.6.1 to 2023.5.31, protocol number 2020\u2013834). All experimental processes complied with internationally accredited guidelines and ethical regulations."
