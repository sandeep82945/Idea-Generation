1. **Investigate the effect of different pH values on the stability and structure of human insulin polymorphs.** This could be done by conducting additional crystallization experiments at different pH values and analyzing the resulting crystals using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and other techniques. This information could be used to develop new methods for controlling the crystallization of human insulin and to improve the stability of insulin formulations.


2. **Study the role of zinc and thiocyanate ions in the formation of human insulin polymorphs.** This could be done by conducting crystallization experiments with different concentrations of zinc and thiocyanate ions and analyzing the resulting crystals using XRPD and other techniques. This information could be used to understand the mechanisms by which zinc and thiocyanate ions influence the crystallization of human insulin and to develop new methods for controlling the formation of specific polymorphs.


3. **Explore the conformational plasticity of human insulin in different polymorphs.** This could be done by conducting molecular dynamics simulations of the different polymorphs and analyzing the resulting trajectories. This information could be used to understand the structural changes that occur in human insulin upon crystallization and to identify the factors that contribute to the conformational plasticity of the protein.


4. **Investigate the relationship between the structure of human insulin polymorphs and their biological activity.** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the activity of the different polymorphs. This information could be used to develop new insulin formulations with improved efficacy and safety.


5. **Develop new methods for the production of specific human insulin polymorphs.** This could be done by optimizing the crystallization conditions for the different polymorphs and by developing new methods for separating the polymorphs from each other. This information could be used to develop new manufacturing processes for human insulin that produce a consistent and high-quality product.
