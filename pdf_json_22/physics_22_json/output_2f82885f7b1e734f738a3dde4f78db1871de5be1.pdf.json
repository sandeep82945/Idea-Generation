Magnetic properties are found to be isotropic in the paramagnetic state while we observe an enhancement of in-plane magnetic susceptibility at the temperature near T \u2217 =11.3 K, suggesting an easy-plane anisotropy at low temperatures. Magnetic transition temperature is lower than T \u2217 as specific heat shows a peak at TN =7.6 K. We reveal the magnetic modulation along the c axis by resonant x-ray scattering at Eu L2 edge, which suggests competing magnetic interaction among Eu triangular-lattice layers. We observe a double-peak structure in the intensity profile along (0, 0, L) below TN, which is mainly composed of a dominant helical modulation with q \u223c (0, 0, 0.4) coexisting with a secondary contribution from q \u223c (0, 0, 0.5). We reproduce the intensity profile with a random mixture of five- and four-sublattice helices with spin rotation skipping due to hexagonal in-plane anisotropy. The metallic conductivity is highly anisotropic with the ratio \u03c1zz/\u03c1xx exceeding 10 over the entire temperature range and additionally exhibits a sharp enhancement of \u03c1zz at TN giving rise to \u03c1zz/\u03c1xx \u223c 50, suggesting a coupling between out-of-plane electron conduction and the spiral magnetic modulations. In-plane magnetic field induces a spin-flop like transition, where the q = 0.4 peak disappears and an incommensurate peak of approximately qICM \u223c 0.47 emerges, while the q = 0.5 modulation retains a finite intensity. This transition correlates with non-monotonic magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity, suggesting a significant interplay between electrons and spin structures through Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nInterplay between conduction electrons and underlying magnetic textures is one of the central interests in modern condensed matter physics. Discoveries of new quantum materials showing novel magnetotransport responses are essential to facilitate future application to spintronic devices. Recent advances of this research field are, for example, discoveries of quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic topological insulators1,2, spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and Nernst effect in magnetic Weyl metals3,4, and topological Hall effect (THE) associated with non-coplanar spin textures such as skyrmion lattice states5\u20137.\nEuropium-based intermetallics are a group of materials having been investigated for long time and attracting recent interests as a source of various topological spin textures8\u201311, and exotic transport phenomena including anomalous Hall effect associated with topological band structures12\u201317, giant magnetoresistance18\u201321, coexistence of superconductivity and helimagnetism22, three-dimensional quantum Hall effect23, and valence transitions24.\nEuZnGe, the material of interest in this study, crystallizes in the centrosymmetric ZrBeSi type (P63/mmc) structure (Fig. 1(a)), which belongs to one of the RMX phases (R: alkali earths/europium/ytterbium, M : CuAu/Zn-Cd, X: anionic main group elements) with AlB2 as the aristotype structure25,26. Every other layer of the\nZn-Ge honeycomb network is rotated by 60\u25e6 with respect to each other, and they are stacked along the c axis sandwiching triangular lattices of Eu. Formal valence of each atom is Eu2+Zn2+Ge4\u2212, which can be described as an electron-precise Zintl phase27. Finite density of state at EF is ascribed to the overlap between the conduction and valence bands, resulting in a metallic behavior26. Previous studies of magnetism25,26,28 were performed with polycrystalline samples, reporting divalent Eu2+ nature with localized magnetic moments. Two antiferromagnetic-like transitions at 12.2 K and 9.5 K were observed though the dominant magnetic interaction was suggested to be ferromagnetic by the Weiss temperature \u0398W = 11 K. Together with a signature of metamagnetic transition at 0.6 T before the saturation, magnetic properties suggest the presence of inherent magnetic frustration in Eu-sublattice in EuZnGe.\nIn this work, we report the nature of magnetism and electric properties of single crystals of EuZnGe. We combine transport and thermodynamic measurements with resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) to reveal a strong correlation between magnetotransport properties and the spin structures with a double-modulation peak along the c axis. We simulate the spin structure to reproduce the magnetic diffraction profile to propose a helical configuration that is modified by the spin-skipping due to hexagonal in-plane anisotropy.\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n02 38\n5v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 2\n2 Se\np 20\n22\n2"

            "text": "Single crystals of EuZnGe were grown from Eu-Zn flux in a sealed tantalum crucible. The method proposed in Ref. 29 was applied to avoid the reaction of Eu with quartz tube and prevent the loss of volatile Eu-Zn flux. As shown in the ternary phase diagram (Fig. 1(b)), synthesis of the EuZnGe phase in Zn-rich flux (m.p.: 420\u25e6C) is inhibited by the tetragonal phase EuZn2Ge2\n30 (green line). We focused on the Eu-Zn flux as the binary phase diagram (Fig. 1(c)) exhibits low-temperature liquidus line below 800\u25e6C. The europium ingots (99.9%), zinc wires (99.99%), and germanium pieces (99.999%) were put into a tantalum tube with the molar ratio Eu:Zn:Ge = 2:2:1 (the composition for the flux 3, red cross in Fig. 1(b)), which was sealed by an arc furnace under Ar atmosphere. Eu ingots were handled in an Ar-filled glovebox. The tantalum tube was put into an evacuated quartz tube and heated to 950\u25e6C. After being held for 24 hours, it was then cooled to 750\u25e6C in 200 hours. After annealing for 4 days at this temperature, the excess flux was removed by centrifugation.\nThe atomic composition and the phase were checked by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS, JEOL model JSM-6010LA) and a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer using Cu K\u03b1 radiation, respectively. The crystal structure was investigated by a single-crystal x-ray diffractometer at the synchrotron facility SPring-8 (see Appendix). A He-gas-blowing device was employed to cool the crystal to 50 K.\nMagnetization was measured with a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-XL). Electrical transport measurements were performed by a conventional five probe method at typical frequency near 17 Hz. The transport properties at low temperatures in a magnetic field was measured using a commercial superconducting magnet and cryostat. The obtained longitudinal and transverse resistivities were symmetrized and antisymmetrized, respectively by field to correct contact misalignment. Thermal expansion and the magnetostriction was measured by the fiber-Bragggrating (FBG) technique using an optical sensing instrument (Hyperion si155, LUNA) in an Oxford Spectromag as described in Ref. 32. Optical fibers were glued using epoxy (Stycast1266) on the (001) and (100) surfaces of as-grown crystals to measure the elongation/compression along the a and c axes, respectively.\nSingle-crystal RXS measurement was carried out at BL-3A, Photon Factory, KEK, Japan, by using the horizontally polarized x-ray in resonance with Eu L2 absorption edge (7.615 keV). We attached a crystal with the as-grown (001) plane on an aluminum plate with GE varnish, and loaded it into a vertical-field superconducting magnet with the b axis parallel to the magnetic field direction. The scattering plane was set to be (H, 0, L). Unless stated, scattered x-rays were detected without polarization analysis."

            "text": "We obtained single crystals of thin hexagonal-prism shape with the typical dimension 1\u00d71\u00d70.5 mm3, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The atomic composition was checked to be Eu:Zn:Ge = 0.35:0.33:0.32, which fairly agrees with the nominal chemical formula. No trace of tantalum was detected in the crystals. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the single phase of EuZnGe. In the single-crystal XRD with synchrotron radiation, we observed odd l = 2n + 1 reflections as shown in Fig. 1(e), exemplifying a doubled-cell of the ZrBeSi-type structure along the c axis with respect to the AlB2-type unit cell due to the Zn/Ge-site ordering as shown in Fig. 1(a) (see Appendix). We refined the crystal structure and discerned negligible site mixing for Zn/Ge atoms or substitution of Ge for Zn as reported in Ref. 33. The\n3\nrefined lattice constants at room temperature are a = 4.3700(5) A\u030a and c = 8.5994(5) A\u030a, which is consistent with the previously reported values28 in polycrystalline samples. We also succeeded in synthesizing single crystals of BaZnGe with the same method. The lattice constants are a =4.47 A\u030a and c =9.62 A\u030a, consistent with that reported in Ref. 25. Single crystals of EuZnGe are stable in air while those of BaZnGe are oxidized within a few days. Prior to the growth with flux 3, we attempted different growth paths starting from flux 1 and 2 (brown crosses in Fig. 1(b)), which are on the line connecting EuZnGe and Eu0.74Zn0.26, the lowest Eu-Zn eutectic point. We failed obtaining EuZnGe phase in these runs. EuZn or Eu3Ge appeared instead as the dominant phases, potentially because of their compositional proximity and/or high melting point.\nWe summarize the temperature dependence of physical properties of single crystalline EuZnGe in Fig. 2. The magnetic transition at TN = 7.6 K can be detected as the specific heat peak at zero field (Fig. 2(a)). The high-temperature feature is dominated by phonons with no signature of structural phase transition as is similar with that of isostructural BaZnGe. The absence of structural transition is also confirmed by single-crystal XRD and thermal expansion at zero field (Fig. 2(b)). The magnetic susceptibilities (M/H) for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 a (Fig. 2(c)) exhibit Curie-Weiss feature characteristic for localized spins of Eu2+ in the paramagnetic state (Fig. 2(c)). The inverse susceptibility (H/M) gives the estimation of effective moments as peff\u2016c = 7.89 \u00b5B for H \u2016 c\nand peff\u22a5c = 7.92 \u00b5B for H \u2016 a, both of which are close to 7.94 \u00b5B for free Eu\n2+ ions with S = 72 . Weiss temperatures are \u0398W\u2016c = 16.2 K, and \u0398W\u22a5c = 15.7 K for H \u2016 c and H \u22a5 c, respectively, suggesting ferromagnetic interaction as the dominant coupling. At low temperatures, easy-plane type anisotropy starts to develop just above TN. Figure 2(d) compares resistivity for in-plane and out-of-plane current directions. The resistivity ratio \u03c1zz/\u03c1xx (see inset) exceeds ten at all temperatures, consistent with the layered crystal structure with quasi-2D nature of Fermi surface. At TN, \u03c1zz/\u03c1xx reaches near fifty, which we attribute to enhanced spin-electron scattering for out-of-plane transport.\nNext we move on to the low-temperature behavior associated with the magnetic ordering. We summarize the physical properties near TN in Fig. 3. A clear single peak in Cmag was observed at TN. The magnetic entropy Smag is obtained by the integration of Cmag/T with respect to T (Fig. 2(a)), and approaches R ln(2S + 1) with S = 72 at well above TN. This is consistent with the idea that the Eu2+ ions dominate the magnetism. The onset of the magnetic order at TN coincides with a steep change in the lattice distortion for both along a and c axes (Fig. 3(b)), which is clear in the thermal expansion coefficient\n4\n\u03b1 (= d(\u2206L/L)/dT ). The profiles of Cmag and \u03b1 reasonably agree with each other for the second order phase transition, indicating that the spin-lattice coupling does not appear to significantly facilitate the magnetic transition at TN 34.\nWe note that in the previous polycrystalline study28 the magnetic susceptibility suggests successive magnetic transitions at 12.2 K and 9.5 K. We also observed anomalous features in M -T curves under the application of \u00b50H = 5 mT, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Double-peak feature\nin M/H for H \u22a5 c at T = 10.5 K and 9.0 K is similar to the previous results28. By taking temperature derivative of M , we observe a peak at TN in dM/dT . For H \u2016 c, the transition near TN manifests as a dip and a broad peak near T \u2217 = 11.3 K implies another critical temperature while no obvious anomaly is observed in Cp or \u2206L/L (see dashed lines in Figs. 3(a)-(b)). We observed distinct responses between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivities to these transition(-like) temperatures (Fig. 3(d)). A sharp peak in \u03c1zz occurs only at TN, which correlates with the onset of the out-of-plane modulation as observed in similar Eu-based helimagnets9,35,36. \u03c1xx, on the other hand, takes a broad peak at T \u2217 and exhibit a weak kink at TN. These transport anomalies imply that T \u2217 corresponds to the steep growth of in-plane magnetic correlations, which may originate from low-dimensionality of Eu triangularlattice layers.\nIn order to clarify the magnetic structure of EuZnGe, we performed RXS. We used the Eu L2-edge resonance to observe the magnetic scattering due to Eu spin ordering. The intensity profile in the (0, 0, L) scan is shown in Fig. 4(a). We observed magnetic Bragg scattering around L = 7.5 \u2212 7.6, which disappears at T = 15 K (above TN and T\n\u2217). We found a double-peak feature with a dominant peak at L = 7.6 and a weak peak at L = 7.5, which correspond to magnetic modulations along the c\u2217 axis with q = 25 and q = 1 2 , respectively. The energy profiles at (0, 0, 7.6) and (0, 0, 7.5) (see Fig. 4(b)) show a resonant peak near the Eu L2 edge, E \u223c 7.615 keV, clarifying the Eu origin of the magnetic Bragg scattering. We performed polarization analysis for the q = 25 peak and confirmed the comparable intensities for \u03c0\u2032 and \u03c3\u2032 channels, which is consistent with a spiral modulation.\nWe note that the double-peak feature as well as the diffusive intensity in intermediate 0.4 < q < 0.5 cannot be reconciled with the proper-screw (helical) spin configuration with q = 0.4, which corresponds to undistorted interlayer-rotation of 72\u25e6 to exhibit a single peak at L = 7.6. Applying the broken-helix recently proposed in a related Eu-based intermetallics EuIn2As2\n35 is unlikely because in the present case the magnetic unit cell of q = 0.5 (four-sublattice) is incompatible in that of q = 0.4 (five-sublattice). To reproduce the intensity profile, we introduce two types of spin configuration as shown in Figs. 4(c)-(d), and consider the actual spin structure as a random mixture of the two. Figure 4(c) shows a five-sublattice spin configuration for q = 0.4 with a fourfold 60\u25e6 inter-layer spin rotation followed by a 120\u25e6 rotation (60\u25e6-60\u25e6-60\u25e6-60\u25e6-120\u25e6). Figure 4(d) corresponds to a four-sublattice model with 60\u25e6-120\u25e6-60\u25e6-120\u25e6 spin rotations. Such a model with discretized spin rotations by 60\u25e6 or 120\u25e6 is hypothesized in the limit of strong hexagonal in-plane anisotropy, which is consistent with the site symmetry of Eu ions. We construct a real-space spin configuration on a 1D-chain with \u2211 i ni sites (see Fig. 4(e)), where ni is the number of sites in each local ith section in which the spins modulate in either of the above two models. We randomly distribute the config-\n5\nuration for q = 0.4 or q = 0.5 onto the i-th section by a ratio of 7:3, and determined the number ni by a random variable among 0 \u223c 50. Figure 4(f) compares the square of the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of the spin configuration and the observed magnetic scattering intensity, where we obtain a reasonable agreement. In particular, the present model reproduces the intensity in the intermediate q region, which cannot be reconciled with a simple multi-domain model for q = 0.4 and 0.5.\nFigure 4(g) shows the intensity profile in the (0, 0, L) scan near L = 6 at selected temperatures. The intensity for q(= L \u2212 6) = 0.5 (I0.5) together with the intermediate diffusive intensity (IICM) disappear above T = 8 K, while that of q \u223c 0.4 (I\u223c0.4) persists with the shift to q = 0.38. We propose a realization of incommensurate smooth helical structure (namely the proper-screw) near TN, likely due to thermal fluctuations. As shown in Fig. 4(h), the double-peak structure disappears above TN, which is correlated with the sharp peak in \u03c1zz (Fig. 3(d)).\nResponses in a magnetic field clarify the coupling between magnetism and the underlying electric structure.\nWe measure magnetization for both H \u2016 c and H \u2016 a (Fig. 5(a)), and observe the saturation to near 7 \u00b5B for H > 4 T, consistent with the divalent nature of Eu. We note that the metamagnetic transition at \u223c0.6 T28 is reproduced only for the H \u22a5 c. It apparently corresponds to the transition from spiral to fan or transverse conical spin structure, as predicted in the magnetization process of helimagnets37. The resistivity shows distinct responses with respect to the direction of the electric currents (Fig. 5(b)). \u03c1zz shows a sharp peak at the critical field, as is commonly observed in metamagnetic transitions38,39. In the metamagnetic phase (SF phase), \u03c1zz shows a large negative magnetoresistance, implying the suppression of the out-of-plane modulation. In contrast to this, \u03c1xx shows a dip, which may be attributed to enhanced conduction at domain walls between regions with different q. We also observe magnetostriction associated with the metamagnetic transition (Fig. 5(c)). In contrast to \u2206La/La, \u2206Lc/Lc is nonmonotonic at the phase boundary, suggesting the coupling between spin configuration and inter-layer distance of triangular-lattices. We place the anomalies observed in various physical properties measurements for H \u22a5 c in the H-T phase diagram (Fig. 5(d)). The peaks of M\u2212T curve for H \u22a5 c (green squares) slightly deviate from the transition temperatures estimated for M \u2212 T in H \u2016 c, and dM/dT , Cp, \u03c1xx, and \u03c1zz in zero field.\nThe Hall resistivity also exhibits an intriguing field evolution with H \u2016 b\u2217 (Fig. 5(e)). At T = 1.8 K, \u03c1xz shows\n6 a valley-like feature selectively in the SF phase compared with a monotonic negative slope at T = 12 K, suggesting the dominant electron-type carrier transport at low temperatures. It is reminiscent of the THE due to the emergence of noncoplanar spin configuration as proposed in the distorted-spiral compound YMn6Sn6\n40,41. Nevertheless in the present case, it is difficult to disentangle possible topological Hall response from field-modulation of the scattering time evidenced in \u03c1xx (Fig. 5(b)) as the Hall signals across the metamagnetic transition in intermetallics with high-mobility carriers closely resemble that of \u03c1xx through the multi-carrier transport\n42. In Fig. 5(e), \u03c1xz shows a sign change above 100 K, clearly indicating the multi-carrier nature.\nTo gain the insight on the field-induced SF phase, we measured the RXS profile under different magnetic fields. Figure 6(a) shows that entering the SF phase at 0.8 T (see the peak in dM/dH in Fig. 6(b) defining the phase boundary) induces an enhancement of the peak at q = 0.5 and in contrast an abrupt shift of the modulation at q = 0.4 to qICM \u223c 0.47. Interestingly, the double-peak structure with q = 0.5 and qICM survives up to \u00b50H =1.8 T and disappears in the FM phase at \u00b50H = 3 T. Through the removal of the applied H, the double-peak structure recovers from the SF phase (0.8 T), and eventually settles near identical profile (but weaker intensity at q = 0.4) in the zero field. The hysteretic behaviors of the q position and the intensity of the magnetic scatterings are summarized in Figs. 6(c)(d). The step wise shift from q = 0.4 to qICM (Fig. 6(c)) coincides with the increase of the integrated intensity for q = 0.5, I0.5 (Fig. 6(d)). The double q-peak structure in the SF phase excludes the simple fan or transverse conical spin configuration (described by a single-q) with no scalar spin chirality. Further study is necessary to reveal possible noncoplanar spin configuration in the SF phase to understand the THE-like response in \u03c1xz(Fig. 5(e))."

Therefore, we performed synchrotron XRD experiments on BL02B1 at SPring-8 in Japan45 using a high-quality single crystal of EuZnGe. A two-dimensional detector CdTe PILATUS, which had a dynamic range of \u223c 107, was used to record the diffraction pattern. Diffraction data collection for crystal structural analysis was performed using a RIGAKU RAXIS IV diffractometer. Intensities of equivalent reflections were averaged and the structural parameters were refined by using Jana200646.\nThe results of the structural analysis of EuZnGe at 300 K are summarized in Tables I and II. When the Zn and Ge sites are completely mixed, the length of the c-axis can be regarded as half, resulting in the absence of the l = 2n + 1 reflections. We, however, found l = 2n + 1 reflections (Fig. 1(e)). The degree of the site mixing at the Zn and Ge sites was further analyzed. Although the occupancy of each of the Zn and Ge sites was refined by restricting the total value to 1, no signs of the site mixing were found, where the R factors were not improved and each occupancy of the Zn and Ge sites remained almost unchanged (see Tables II).\n7\n8 1 C.-Z.
