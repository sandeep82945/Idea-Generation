    "abstractText": "In this work, the synthesis of a new polysiloxane, poly {dimethylsiloxane-co-[4-(2,3-difluoro4-hydroxyphenoxy) butyl] methylsiloxane} (dubbed PMFOS), is presented. This polymer exhibits high hydrogen bond acidity and was designed to be used as a sensor layer in gas sensors. The description of the synthetic route of the PMFOS has been divided into two main stages: the synthesis of the functional substituent 4-(but-3-en-1-yloxy)-2,3-difluorophenol, and the post-polymerization functionalization of the polysiloxane chain (methylhydrosiloxane-dimethylsiloxane copolymer) via hydrosilylation. The synthesized material was subjected to instrumental analysis, which confirmed its structure. The performed thermal analysis made it possible to determine some properties important for the sensor application, such as glass transition temperature and decomposition temperature. The results showed that PMFOS meets the requirements for materials intended for use in gas sensors based on acoustoelectric transducers.",

            "text": "Nerve chemical warfare agents (CWAs) are a group of chemical substances classified as weapons of mass destruction. Recently, these substances have been used several times, reminding the public of their military importance. For this reason, it is very important to provide the first responders with the appropriate tools for the fast detection of these substances at the place of their use. Currently, on-site detection of nerve CWAs is possible with the use of gas analyzers that use various analytical techniques [1\u20134]. Among them, techniques allowing for the construction of cheap and compact gas analyzers (e.g., that are possible to be used as on-board equipment for unmanned aerial vehicles) are of particular interest. The above requirements are well met by gravimetric gas sensors based on a variety of acoustoelectric transducers, such as quartz crystal microbalances (QMB) [5], surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices utilizing both Rayleigh and Love waves [6,7], or microcantilever transducers [8,9]. A common design feature of all the above-mentioned devices is the presence of a sensor layer, which is the interface between the analyzed gas and the non-selective transducer part of the sensor. The task of the sensor layer is to selectively interact with the analyte. As a result of this interaction, the mass, elasticity, and electrical properties of the layer change. Changing the layer parameters affects the acoustic wave and, as a result, generates the analytical signal of the sensor. The type and properties of the layer used affect not only the selectivity of the sensor but also its sensitivity and dynamic properties. One of the most commonly used types of sensor layers is an absorption layer. In this case, the dissolution of the analyte molecules present in the analyzed gas takes place in the volume of the layer. The transport of the analyte continues until a thermodynamic\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1147. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14061147 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1147 2 of 11\nequilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, the partitioning of the analyte between the gas and liquid phases can be described by the value of the partition constant K [10]:\nK = CS CV\n(1)\nwhere:\nCs: equilibrium analyte concentration in the sensor layer; Cv: equilibrium analyte concentration in ambient gas.\nIn the process of designing and synthesizing materials for sensor layers, the aim is to obtain the greatest possible partition constant while maintaining maximum selectivity. Absorption-type sensor layers can be made of polymers which are in an elastomeric (rubbery) state at the sensor operating temperature. In this case, the sorption of the analyte to the volume of the sensor layer occurs many times faster than for polymers in the glassy state. This translates into faster sensor operation. Taking into account the fact that the sensor should work at a temperature close to room temperature (the K value usually drops significantly with increasing temperature), and at the same time, that the sensor layer should be in the elastomeric state (to ensure good dynamic properties), it is desirable to use polymers with a low glass transition temperature Tg. In practice, the Tg should be well below room temperature. Due to the natively low Tg, polysiloxane-based functional materials are of particular interest [11]. In addition, polysiloxanes exhibit several other features desirable in sensor applications, such as chemical and temperature stability or the possibility of immobilization on a quartz substrate. The solvation properties of functional polymers result from the presence of specific functional groups. Hydrogen-bond acidic (HBA) polysiloxanes usually contain alcoholic or phenolic functional substituents. The positively charged hydrogen atom in the hydroxyl group of such a substituent exhibits a high ability to form a hydrogen bond. This feature is complementary to the relatively specific ability of the nerve CWA molecule to act as a hydrogen acceptor in the hydrogen-bond formation process. Therefore, HBA polysiloxanes are widely used in sensors for the detection of nerve CWA vapors. A strongly acidic group found in the structure of many HBA polysiloxanes is hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) [12\u201316]. However, it shows a high affinity to water vapor that is always present in the environment. Apart from HFIP-containing polysiloxanes, materials with phenolic substituents, which interact less with water vapor, have also been developed [17\u201320]. The structures of selected HBA polysiloxanes used in acoustic wave sensors are shown in Figure 1. One of the most commonly used methods for the synthesis of functional polysiloxanes is the post-polymerization functionalization of the existing polymethylhydrosiloxane chain via hydrosilylation [13,15,21]. This method has been used many times for the synthesis of the HBA polysiloxanes used in the detection of nerve CWAs and their simulants. The greatest advantage of this method is the possibility of the one-step preparation of functional polysiloxanes. This work presents the synthesis of a new sensor polysiloxane that contains fluorophenol groups: poly {dimethylsiloxane-co-[4-(2,3-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenoxy) butyl] methylsiloxane}, dubbed PMFOS.

Structure of poly{dimethylsiloxane-co-[4-(2,3-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenoxy) butyl] methylsiloxane}\u2014PMFOS.\nThis material is structurally similar to PMDFPS (Figure 1e). An important difference between these materials is the position of the hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring. In the case of PMDFPS, the hydroxyl group is in the ortho position, in relation to the alkyl linker with the polysiloxane chain, which results from the adopted synthetic route using the Claisen rearrangement [18]. In turn, in the case of PMFOS, the -OH group is located in the para position to the alkoxy group, connecting the aromatic ring to the polysiloxane backbone. The transfer of the hydroxyl group to a more exposed position was to minimize steric hindrance during the formation of acidic hydrogen bonds with the analyte\nmolecule. The first step of the PMFOS synthesis was to obtain the functional substituent:\n4-(but-3-en-1-yloxy)-2,3-difluorophenol. The functional polymer was then obtained by a post-\npolymerization functionalization of existing polysiloxanes via Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 1147 4 of 11\nPMFOS has already been used in SAW sensors, as is described in our earlier work [22]. Additionally, its solvation properties were determined using inverse gas chromatography, and its acidic nature was confirmed [23]."

This is indicative of a residual Si\u2212H bond from the initial PMHS that was not converted. The Si\u2212H band was not visible in the IR spectrum, however. This is probably due to the differences in the sensitivities of the two methods, or the particular conditions of the analyses. Based on the 1H-NMR PMFOS and PMHS spectra, as well as the knowledge of the initial content of the Si\u2212H bonds declared by the PMHS manufacturer, the conversion rate of the Si\u2212H bond in the PMFOS material was estimated. Thus, the determined conversion rate was 97.2% (see Supplementary Material). The above spectrum also shows the peak corresponding to the protons in Si\u2212CH2 (0.48 ppm).

The response time of PMFOS sensors to DMMP vapor was investigated at 30 \u00b0C, which is well above the Tg of PMFOS (\u221244 \u00b0C). The temperature of 30 \u00b0C is close to room temperature, and providing sensor thermostating at such a temperature is not problematic, which is particularly important in the case of miniature, portable devices. The real-time DMMP response curve of the PMFOS sensor is presented in Figure 10."
