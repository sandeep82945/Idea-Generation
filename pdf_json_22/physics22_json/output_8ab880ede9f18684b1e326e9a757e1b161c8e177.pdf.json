            "text": "Diffusiophoresis is the phenomenon where colloidal particles move in response to solute concentration gradients. The understanding of this key physical principle and its applications is enabling innovation in paint film deposition 1, laundry2, membrane separation3,4, and hidden target searching 5. Solute concentration gradients in diffusiophoresis can be generated by a number of mechanisms 6: chemical reactions7, mineral dissolution8, and chemokine secretion 9, amongst others. The movement of colloidal particles due to concentration gradients can be divided into\na Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder CO 80303, USA.

In active diffusiophoresis10\u201313, colloidal particles generate their own concentration gradients, while in passive diffusiophoresis 14\u201318, particles respond to an externally generated gradient.\nRecently, there have been numerous experimental and theoretical reports exploring the motion of active diffusiophoretic particles. These include the effects of finite Peclet numbers19,20, asymmetry in the form of Janus particles and bent rods21\u201323, changes in the local fluid environment 10,13,24,25, and the use of active droplets instead of particles26\u201328. Such systems have been proposed for uses in applications29 such as environmental remediation 30, drug delivery31, and cellular transport32.\nIn contrast to active diffusiophoresis, there are several decades of literature on passive diffusiophoresis. One of the first series of studies to quantify the distribution of colloidal particles under diffusiophoresis was conducted by Staffeld et al.33,34. They showed,\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u201312 | 1\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n13 79\n5v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n1 0\nJa n\n20 23\nin electrolytic and non-electrolytic solutes, that the particle distribution exhibits a local maximum, resembling a band that moves with the diffusing solute front33,34. This laid the groundwork for studies of diffusiophoretic banding in other systems, including the well-studied dead-end pore geometry35\u201338. Experimental studies have been conducted on these dead-end pore systems to optimize nanoparticle transport in collagen hydrogels39, show the size dependence of particle transport into pores40, determine design criteria for particle capture by a pore41, and develop a low cost zeta-potentiometer42. In addition to dead-end pore geometries, similar studies have been conducted in other microfluidic systems. Cross-channel pores have been used to study surface-solute interactions17 and the aggregration of colloidal particles near flow junctions43. CO2-induced concentration gradients across microfluidic channels have been used to predict exclusion zone formation in channel flows 44, remove bacteria from surfaces45, provide crossflow migration of colloids46, and enable membraneless water filtration47. In a similar way, salt gradients have been used to induce colloidal banding in microfluidic channels16,48.\nIn addition to the breadth of experimental studies, analytical and numerical techniques have been used to study the phenomena observed in the aforementioned experimental systems. Anderson et al. showed that the diffusiophoretic velocity of a particle is dictated by surface interactions between the solute and particle49\u201351. For ionic solutes, the diffusiophoretic velocity is given as uDP = Me\u2207 ln c, where Me is the mobility of the particle and c is the electrolyte concentration 50. For a particle moving in non-ionic solutes, the diffusiophoretic velocity is given as, uDP = M\u2207c, where M is also a mobility parameter and c is the solute concentration 51. These mobility relationships can also be extended to include the effect of multiple ionic species 52\u201354, arbitrary double layer thicknesses55, and ion sizes 56,57, amongst others. Numerical studies have been conducted on the spreading of diffusiophoretic particles in response to applied solute gradients with hydrodynamic background flows 58, in one-dimensional transient gradients 59,60, in concentrated electrolyte solutions61, in solutes that exhibit Taylor dispersion due to a background/diffusioosmotic flow14,62, and in the presence of multiple electrolytes52.\nDespite the expansive literature on passive diffusiophoresis, most studies focus on the effects of one-dimensional transient or steady solute concentration profiles on particle motion. The number of studies that expand particle motion to two or three dimensions are limited14,17,41,44,52,62\u201364, with most focusing on diffusiophoretic motion in two- and three-dimensional channel flows with one-dimensional driving solute gradients.\nRecently, Bannerjee et al. 65 developed \u201csoluto-intertial\" beacons that enable them to enact spatio-temporal control over solute gradients surrounding their beacons. This allows them to control and study diffusiophoretic particles moving in response to two- and three-dimensional gradients. They initially designed cylindrical hydrogel posts loaded with sodium dodecyl sulfate that attracted decane droplets and repelled polystyrene particles by releasing solute over a timescale of tens of minutes 65. By determining the appropriate diffusiophoretic velocity scale analytically in 3D and numerically in 2D, they were able to collapse the\nradial dependence of particle velocity 65. This proof-of-concept study showed that diffusiophoresis can be used as a mechanism to move colloidal particles deterministically over a length scale of hundreds of microns65. The authors expanded this study to design temperature-triggered beacons, source and sink dipoles, dipoles with distinct solutes, and dipoles with reacting solutes66. In follow-up studies, they developed design principles 67, which enabled them to manipulate colloidal distributions in suspension by a sedimenting beacon 68 and deliver particles to hidden targets5.\nInspired by the work from Banerjee et al. 66 on source and sink dipoles, we envisioned that multiple solute sources and sinks can be spatially and temporally designed to optimize diffusiophoretic banding in two dimensions. To this end, we outline a numerical procedure for simulating diffusiophoretic colloidal transport in response to a non-electrolytic solute gradient generated by an arbitrary number of point sources and sinks. We determine an appropriate time-dependent molar rate by semi-analytically solving for the flux from a finite-sized solute source. Using our numerical scheme, we determine the timescales governing particle separation in a dipole and octupole source/sink system. For the dipole system, we show that there exists an optimum separation distance between the source and sink that maximizes particle enrichment in a specific region. This optimal distance is set by a balance between interdipole diffusion and molar rate decay timescales. We find that the optimal separation distance depends primarily on the partition coefficient, K, of the source/sink and is weakly dependent on the diffusivity ratio, D\u0302. Lastly, we show how these principles change the optimal geometric arrangement of sources and sinks in an octupole configuration. Interestingly, we find that the optimal design of an octupole configuration depends on both the spatial arrangement of sources and sinks and the temporal decay of solute molar rate. These results underscore the rich dynamics observed by expanding diffusiophoretic driving forces to two dimensions. Our results also broaden the potential design space of colloidal banding using diffusiophoresis and provide a numerical framework to study the banding of diffusiophoretic particles in response to an arbitrary arrangement of solute sources and sinks."

            "text": "To investigate the response of colloidal particles in twodimensional solute gradients, described here as \u2207c, we focus on the gradients generated by an arbitrary number of solute sources and sinks. As shown in Fig. 1, we denote the locations of the sources and sinks by ri, where the subscript i refers to the ith source or sink. The distance between the ith and jth source or sink is denoted as \u2206ij. For simplicity, we consider that the sources emit solute at a molar rate J(t) and that the sinks absorb solute at a molar rate of \u2212J(t). At time t = 0, we have a uniform concentration of particles and solute in our system. At t = 0+, the sinks and sources begin emitting and absorbing the solute, creating a time-dependent and spatially varying concentration gradient. The solute gradient generated by sources and sinks induces a diffusiophoretic velocity on particles, uDP = M\u2207c. If M > 0, particles are attracted to the sources and repelled from the sinks. In contrast, if M < 0, the particles are repelled from the sources\n2 | 1\u201312Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nand attracted to the sinks. At early times, the sources and sinks interact minimally, resulting in attraction/repulsion which transports particles towards the source and away from the sink (for M > 0). This creates local extrema of particle concentration, resulting in a banded distribution. As time progresses, the sources and sinks screen each other, much like electrostatic charges. At this timescale, the diffusiophoretic movement is diminished. In the following analysis, we seek to optimize particle enrichment by tuning the arrangement of sources and sinks, given a timedependent molar rate, J(t).\nWe acknowledge that in practical experimental setups, the emission and absorption rates are unlikely to be equal and opposite over time. However, while our numerical framework can handle arbitrary molar rates, we make this assumption to reduce the number of parameters in our system. In addition, we note that uDP described above uses the non-electrolyte mobility relationship. The rationale to use this relationship is two-fold. First, the non-electrolytic mobility expression does not possess the singularity found in the electrolytic mobility expression. We acknowledge that the singularity can be addressed by considering a concentration-dependent electrolytic mobility 61,69. For computational convenience, we refrain from incorporating a concentration dependent mobility relation. Second, if the concentration difference is relatively small, the two mobility relationships are equivalent; see Appendix A. Therefore, we choose the non-electrolytic mobility relationship. We acknowledge that there might be quantitative differences if a different mobility relationship is employed, and comment on this difference in Appendix A. Additionally, we acknowledge the limitation in using point sources and sinks, as spatial effects due to the presence of a finite-sized source/sink\nwill yield differences. However, we observe that the qualitative features remain the same as reported in prior experiments 66; see Appendix B."

As is evident from eqn (1), we treat solute sources and sinks as point sources. If the ith solute patch is a source, Ji = J(t), and if the ith solute patch is a sink, Ji = \u2212J(t). As we show later, we account for the finite-size effect of the patch by deriving the emitted flux from an isolated source. We note that eqn (1) neglects any advection terms in solute transport, which is typical for studies on diffusiophoresis without background flows61,70.\nWe calculate particle motion using two different approaches. First, we use Lagrangian particle tracking to determine the position of particles in time. The center of mass of the ith particle, xi, can be determined by solving the following differential equation\ndxi dt = uDP = M\u2207c \u2223\u2223 xi . (2)\nWe note that eqn (2) neglects Brownian fluctuations. This is a typical assumption for diffusiophoretic particles as particle radii are typically O(10\u22126) m62,63.\nSecond, we calculate the concentration of colloidal particles, n(r, t). The conservation equation for particle concentration is\n\u2202n \u2202t = Dn\u22072n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (n(M\u2207c)) , (3)\nwhere Dn is the diffusivity of the colloidal particles. The response of the particles to the generated solute field is included as an advective term. We retain Dn for numerical stability and assume Dn Ds 1. The retention of Dn helps smooth the sharp gradients near the moving particle band. Eqns (1) and (2) or eqns (1) and (3) are solved simultaneously to determine c(r, t), xi(r, t) and n(r, t).\nBefore numerically solving, we non-dimensionalize eqns (1)- (3) as\n\u2202c\u0303 \u2202\u03c4 = \u2207\u03032c\u0303+ \u2211 i Ji (\u03c4) \u03b4\u0303 (r\u0303 \u2212 r\u0303i) , (4)\ndx\u0303i d\u03c4 = M\u0303\u2207\u0303c\u0303 \u2223\u2223 x\u0303i , (5)\n\u2202n\u0303 \u2202\u03c4 = D\u0303\u2207\u03032n\u0303\u2212 \u2207\u0303 \u00b7\n( n\u0303(M\u0303\u2207\u0303c\u0303) ) , (6)\nwhere Ji = JiDscref , \u03b4\u0303 = \u03b4L 2, n\u0303 = n nref , c\u0303 = c cref , \u03c4 = t L2/Ds , M\u0303 = Mcref Ds , D\u0303 = Dn Ds , \u2207\u0303 = L\u2207, r\u0303 = r L , x\u0303 = x L\n, and L is a reference length scale. We do not employ a (i.e., the source/sink radius) or \u2206 as the reference length scale since a only enters through our molar rate calculations and \u2206 is the variable that\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u201312 | 3\nwe seek to vary. We emphasize that L is a reference length scale and does not influence our calculations. We solve these equations in a two-dimensional Cartesian domain with x\u0303, y\u0303 \u2208 [\u221210, 10]. We impose no-flux boundary conditions for both c\u0303 and n\u0303 on the domain boundaries. We set initial conditions n\u0303(r\u0303, 0) = n\u03030 = 1 and c\u0303(r\u0303, 0) = c\u03030 = 0. For simplicity, we take D\u0303 = 10\u22124 52,61. Additionally, we note that M\u0303 \u2264 1 for most colloids 61 and use M\u0303 = 0.5 for all simulations. To solve eqns (4)-(6), we need an input of J (\u03c4), which we discuss next.\nTo elucidate the effects of molar rate decay, we use three different scenarios for J (\u03c4). First, constant molar rates, J (\u03c4) = J0H(\u03c4), where J0 is the strength of the step molar rate and H is the heaviside function. In this scenario, there is no timescale associated with molar rate decay and the timescale for colloidal banding is dictated by the interaction between sources and sinks. The second choice of J (\u03c4) is a boxcar function profile given by J (\u03c4) = J0H(\u03c4)H (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4), where \u03c40 introduces an additional timescale.\nLastly, we derive J (\u03c4) by calculating the flux emitting from an isolated, finite-sized source of radius a. This allows us to incorporate experimentally relevant parameters, i.e., the partition coefficient of the solute into the source K, and the diffusivity ratio of solute between the source and the bulk D\u0302. To evaluate J (\u03c4), we briefly restore dimensions. We assume the origin to be the center of the source. The inner region refers to the concentration field inside of the source, i.e., r \u2264 a and the outer region corresponds to the concentration field outside of the source, i.e., r > a. We assume that the concentration in the outer region is initially uniform such that cout = cref , and the source is saturated with solute such that the concentration in the inner region is cin = Kcref . At t = 0+, the concentration outside is switched to cout = 0, which leads the source to start emitting solute. The conservation equations for solute inside and outside the source are\n\u2202cin \u2202t = Din r \u2202 \u2202r ( r \u2202cin \u2202r ) r \u2264 a, (7)\n\u2202cout \u2202t = Ds r \u2202 \u2202r ( r \u2202cout \u2202r ) r > a. (8)\nThe initial and boundary conditions are cin(r, t = 0) = Kcref cout(r, t = 0) = 0 \u2202cin \u2202r \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=0 = 0 cout(r \u2192\u221e, t) = 0 cin(r = a, t) = Kcout(r = a, t)\nDin \u2202cin \u2202r \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=a = Ds \u2202cout \u2202r \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=a\n(9)\nWe set the diffusivity of solute in the outer region to be the same as that of eqn (1) and the diffusivity of the inner region to be Din. In order to determine the appropriate time dependence of\nflux from the source, we first non-dimensionalize the equations as follows:\n\u2202c\u0303in \u2202T = D\u0302 1 r\u0303 \u2202 \u2202r\u0303 ( r\u0303 \u2202c\u0303in \u2202r\u0303 ) , r\u0303 < 1 (10)\n\u2202c\u0303out \u2202T = 1 r\u0303 \u2202 \u2202r\u0303 ( r\u0303 \u2202c\u0303out \u2202r\u0303 ) , r\u0303 > 1 (11)\nwhere c\u0303in = cincref , c\u0303out = cout cref , D\u0302 = Din Ds , r\u0303 = r a and T = \u03c4L 2 a2 . We note that T = \u03c4L 2\na2 = Dst a2 and is not influenced by L. By Laplace\ntransforming the set of equations from T -space to s-space, we find a solution for the interfacial flux F\u0302 (s); see Appendix C F\u0302 (s) = K \u221a D\u0302\u221a s K1,b( \u221a s)I1,b( \u221a s D\u0302 ) I0,b( \u221a s\nD\u0302 )K1,b(\n\u221a s) +K \u221a D\u0302I1,b( \u221a s\nD\u0302 )K0,b(\n\u221a s) ,\n(12) where In,b and Kn,b are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind, nth order. We numerically invert the flux from sspace to T -space, i.e. F (T ) = L\u22121 ( F\u0302 (s) ) , calculate the molar\nrelease rate, and appropriately scale the flux to get\nJ (\u03c4) = 2\u03c0F ( L2\na2 \u03c4\n) .\nJ (\u03c4) is dependent on the partition coefficient K and diffusivity ratio D\u0302, which we discuss later."

The time at which \u03a6(\u03c4) of the monopole overtakes \u03a6(\u03c4) of the dipoles is denoted as the crossover time, \u03c4c. Fig. 2(i) shows a linear trend between d2 and \u03c4c. To explain the trends outlined above, we examine eqn (6) more carefully. First, we ignore diffusion as D\u0303 = 10\u22124. Next, we integrate eqn (6) over \u21261 (defined by the shaded region shown in Fig. 2a), and write\u222b\n\u21261\n\u2202n\u0303 \u2202\u03c4 dV = \u2212 \u222b \u21261 \u2207\u0303 \u00b7 ( n\u0303(M\u0303\u2207\u0303c\u0303) ) dV. (14)\nBy employing eqn (13) and divergence theorem, we obtain\nd\u03a6 d\u03c4 = \u2212 M\u0303 N0 \u222b S1 ( n\u0303\u2207\u0303c\u0303 ) \u00b7 e\u0302ndS, (15)\nwhere N0 = \u222b\n\u2126 n\u03030dV , S1 defines the outer perimeter of region\n\u21261, and e\u0302n is the unit normal vector pointing outwards from S1. Essentially, eqn (15) states that d\u03a6\nd\u03c4 is affected by the convective\nflux entering through S1. The convective flux has two parameters, i.e., \u2207\u0303c\u0303 and n\u0303.\nAt early times, dipoles have not had sufficient time to interact with each other. Therefore, we argue that to a first approximation, \u2207\u0303c\u0303 are similar for both a monopole and the source in dipoles. If so, to explain the trend in Fig. 2(h inset), eqn (14)\nimplies that at early times, n\u0303 is higher for smaller d values. This appears surprising at first since the \u2207\u0303c\u0303 from sources and sinks do not interact at this timescale. However, the depletion of particles around the sink increases the concentration of particles at S1, which consequently increases d\u03a6d\u03c4 (see Appendix D), leading to a larger \u03a6.\nWe argue that dipoles start to interact with each other at \u03c4 \u223c d2, or the interdipole diffusion time. For \u03c4 & d2, the dipoles screen each other, causing a rapid decline in \u2207\u0303c\u0303. After the interdipole diffusion time, \u2207\u0303c\u0303 becomes localized between the source and sink and diminishes elsewhere. This results in a smaller d\u03a6\nd\u03c4 ;\nsee eqn (15). Since screening occurs later for larger d, the decay in d\u03a6\nd\u03c4 starts later and \u03a6(\u03c4) is higher; see Appendix D. Finally, for the monopole, screening never occurs, and concentration gradients do not diminish due to interactions with a sink. This is why the monopole overtakes dipoles around the interdipole diffusion time, which results in \u03c4c \u223c d2; see Fig. 2(i).\nThe aforementioned discussion highlights the time-dependent nature of enrichment. Therefore, we seek to study the effects of a time-dependent molar rate. To this end, we employ a molar rate profile given by J (\u03c4) = J0H(\u03c4)H (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4), whereH is the Heaviside function; see Fig. 3(a). This molar rate provides us with two parameters: the strength of the molar rate J0 and the time for the molar rate to decay to zero \u03c40. Fig 3(b) shows \u03a6(\u03c4) for J0 = 1, \u03c40 = 18.2 and d = 1\u22126. The choice for \u03c40 corresponds to the crossover time observed in Fig. 2 for d = 3. For \u03c4 > \u03c40 (rep-\n6 | 1\u201312Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nresented by the dashed line in Fig. 3(b)), \u03a6(\u03c4) increases slightly before leveling. At \u03c4 = \u03c40, we also observe that \u03a6(\u03c4) increases with separation distance until d = 3 and then slightly decreases. Thus, there is an optimal separation distance. Using the described optimization scheme, we determined the optimal separation distance, dopt as a function of \u03c40 and J0. In Fig. 3(c), we observe that a plot of d2opt versus \u03c40 results in a linear trend. Additionally, from Fig. 3(d) , we see that dopt is weakly dependent on J0.\nThe dopt is set by a balance between the interdipole diffusion and molar rate decay timescales. This is seen by the linear trend between d2opt and \u03c40 observed in Fig. 3(c). When d < \u221a \u03c40, the source and sink screen each other before the molar rate is turned off, leading to small \u03a6(\u03c4). When d \u223c \u221a\u03c40, the enrichment around the source is boosted due to depletion around the sink, however, the source and sink do not screen each other as the molar rate vanishes at the inter-dipole diffusion time. Finally, when d & \u221a \u03c40, the enrichment around the source is less impacted by the depletion around the sink. In effect, d \u223c \u221a\u03c40 becomes the optimal distance. In summary, the timescale of molar rate decay can be used as a parameter to optimize particle enrichment.\nJ (\u03c4) = H(\u03c4) and J (\u03c4) = J0H(\u03c4)H (\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4) are not easy to realize experimentally. Instead, as shown by Banerjee et al. 65\u201367, solute fluxes arise due to solute partitioning between source and the bulk, described by a partition coefficient, denoted here as K. We also define the diffusivity ratio, D\u0302, as the ratio of solute diffusivity in the source and in the bulk. As such, we incorporate\nthe effects of these parameters by determining J (\u03c4) = f(K, D\u0302) using eqn (12). Fig. 4(a) shows J (\u03c4) for different values of K and D\u0302. As expected, the molar rate has a higher strength for a larger K value, and the decay is slower for a smaller value of D\u0302.\nWe conduct dipole simulations by solving eqn (6) with J (\u03c4) determined by inverting eqn (12). We evaluate \u03a6(\u03c4) for different values for K and D\u0302. Fig. 4(b) shows \u03a6(\u03c4) with J (\u03c4) = f(K = 100, D\u0302 = 10\u22122) and for different d values. Much like Fig. 3, we observe an optimal separation distance, dopt \u2248 5. This demonstrates that dopt is a generic feature of a time-dependent molar rate. We investigate the dependence of dopt on K and D\u0302 using the optimization scheme described earlier. Fig. 4(c) shows the variation of dopt with D\u0302 for K = 500, where we observe that dopt is weakly dependent on D\u0302. However, Fig. 4(d) shows that dopt is strongly dependent on K.\nThe result of dopt showing a weak dependence on D\u0302 is surprising, as one would expect D\u0302 to impact the timescale of solute molar rate decay, which would ultimately impact the optimal separation distance. Therefore, we investigate this effect further. We note that there are two timescales for J (\u03c4) = f(K, D\u0302): a short timescale, during which solute transport occurs over a small boundary layer within the source, and a longer timescale where concentration gradients inside of the source are fully developed.\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u201312 | 7\n\u03a6(\u03c4=0)\nfor Cases 1-4 with R varying from 1\u2212 5.\nAn expansion of eqn (12) around large s (small \u03c4) shows that\nJ (\u03c4) \u223c K \u221a D\u0302\n(1 +K \u221a D\u0302) \u221a \u03c4 . (16)\nClearly, if the short timescale of molar rate decay balanced the interdipole diffusion timescale, then a dependence of dopt on D\u0302 would be observed. Interestingly, an expansion of eqn (12) around small s yields\nF\u0302 (s) \u223c K 2 +Ks ln 2\u2212 K\n2 s ln s\n. (17)\nEqn (17) is not analytically inverted, but we emphasize that it is only dependent on K. While an expansion for small s cannot be directly related to large \u03c4 , Fig. 4(d) shows that dopt only depends on K. To this end, we argue that dopt is determined by a balance between interdipole diffusion and long time scaling for J (\u03c4), which primarily depends on K.\nGiven our understanding of timescales and their impact on optimal banding in dipole systems, we seek to expand our work to probe how the geometric arrangment of four sources and four sinks around a circle of radiusR, termed here as an octupole sys-\ntem, affects banding. Fig. 5(a) shows the four octupole arrangements we study. Case 1 refers to the arrangement where each source is nearest to two sinks and vice-versa, i.e., a relatively symmetric arrangement. Case 4 refers to the most asymmetric scenario where four sources are arranged consecutively, followed by four sinks. Case 2 and Case 3 are in between, with Case 2 being more symmetric than Case 3. The shaded areas outlined by dashed lines represent the integration region that \u03a6(\u03c4) is calculated over. Fig. 5(b,c) show simulation snapshots at \u03c4 = 100 for J (\u03c4) = H(\u03c4)H(\u03c40 \u2212 \u03c4) with R = 3 (panel b) and R = 5 (panel c). \u03c40 = 18.2 is used for all simulations.\nWe quantify \u03b7 = \u03a6(\u03c4=100)\u2212\u03a6(\u03c4=0) \u03a6(\u03c4=0)\n, i.e., the relative increase in \u03a6. Fig. 5(d) shows \u03b7 for all four octupole arrangements, with R varying from 1 to 5. For R = 1, Case 1 experiences the smallest increase in \u03a6(\u03c4), while Case 4 experiences the largest increase. As R increases from 1 to 5, this trend reverses and Case-1 experiences the largest increase in \u03a6(\u03c4) while Case 4 experiences the smallest increase. To understand this trend, we invoke our understanding from the dipole arrangement. The octupole has multiple interpole diffusion timescales. The smallest timescale is associated with dij = \u2206ij L = 2R sin \u03c0 8\nand the longest timescale is associated with dij = 2R. When R = 1, the maximum dij . \u221a \u03c40.\n8 | 1\u201312Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nTherefore, all sources and sinks interact before the molar rate decays. In this scenario, the arrangement with the most geometric asymmetry, i.e., Case 4, has the largest \u03b7. Intuitively, in this case the source/sink screening is minimized, as the sources and sinks are collectively the furthest apart. When R = 5, the smallest dij & \u221a \u03c40, implying that none of the sources and sinks interact. Case 1 performs best in this regime, as sources are able to benefit from a local increase in n\u0303(r\u0303, \u03c4) due to depletion from multiple nearby sinks. This effect is similar to the increase in performance for dipoles compared to a monopole observed earlier, see Fig. 2(h). Lastly, we note that \u03b7, for all four cases, increases with R because dij also increases with R. As R increases, the sinks and sources enrich particles for longer before interacting. We underscore that such complex banding patterns are unlikely to occur in one-dimensional diffusiophoretic systems as the motion of colloidal particles is restricted to one direction."

            "text": "In summary, we present a numerical framework for studying the banding of colloidal particles in response to two-dimensional concentration gradients. By studying the enrichment of particles in a dipole system, we find that both the interdipole diffusion and molar rate decay timescales impact the optimal banding of colloidal particles. Interestingly, a balance between these two characteristic timescales yields an optimal dipole separation distance, one which balances enrichment before the source and sink screen each other. By determining the flux from a finite-sized partitioning source, we include the effects of a partition coefficientK and diffusivity ratio D\u0302 into our molar rate profiles. We find that the optimal separation distance in this scenario depends primarily on K, with D\u0302 only showing a weak effect. More importantly, we used the optimization of separation distance to elucidate that there are two timescales that impact the banding process. This discovery can be used to engineer complex systems with multiple sources and sinks. For instance, for an octupole arrangement of sources and sinks, we find that banding is also affected by geometric asymmetry. In fact, the optimal arrangement of sources and sinks is due to the interplay between multiple interpole diffusion timescales and the molar rate decay timescale.\nLooking forward, our results provide design principles for engineering microfluidic devices5,65\u201367 that utilize diffusiophoresis to move colloidal particles and create banded patterns. By utilizing partition coefficients and spatial arrangement, one can impart temporal and spatial control over the banded structure of colloidal particles. From a fundamental perspective, our results can also be expanded to include flow effects such as dispersion due to diffusiophoresis or diffusioosmosis14,37,52,58,62,71,72. Additionally, there is the potential to use such a system for applications that require precise control over colloid localization, such as biosensing73, colloids separation 74, and two-dimensional micropatterning75. Dipole and octupole systems, as envisioned, could be created using lithography similar to66. Our work also invites future studies that move away from point sinks and sources, include higher-order effects and investigate asymmetric fluxes between sources and sinks. The results, as outlined in this article, motivate future experimental and theoretical studies to investigate\ntwo- and three-dimensional diffusiophoretic banding."

We note the negative concentration values as the initial concentration was taken to be zero. The values can be offset simply by choosing a different initial condition. The results will remain unaffected since the particle velocities only rely on the difference of concentrations and are not influenced by the absolute value.\nConflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare."
