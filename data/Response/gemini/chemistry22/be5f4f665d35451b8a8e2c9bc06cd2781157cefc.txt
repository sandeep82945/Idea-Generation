1. **Investigate the effects of PCAEE on the fluidity and permeability of lipid membranes.** This could be done using techniques such as fluorescence anisotropy and liposome leakage assays. This information could help to understand how PCAEE affects the function of biological membranes.


2. **Study the interactions of PCAEE with other membrane components, such as proteins and cholesterol.** This could be done using techniques such as co-sedimentation assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. This information could help to understand how PCAEE interacts with complex biological membranes.


3. **Explore the effects of PCAEE on the activity of membrane-bound enzymes.** This could be done using enzyme activity assays. This information could help to understand how PCAEE affects the function of membrane-bound proteins.


4. **Investigate the effects of PCAEE on the structure and function of model cell membranes.** This could be done using techniques such as atomic force microscopy and electrophysiology. This information could help to understand how PCAEE affects the overall structure and function of biological membranes.


5. **Study the effects of PCAEE on the interactions of other drugs with lipid membranes.** This could be done using techniques such as surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. This information could help to understand how PCAEE affects the efficacy and toxicity of other drugs.
