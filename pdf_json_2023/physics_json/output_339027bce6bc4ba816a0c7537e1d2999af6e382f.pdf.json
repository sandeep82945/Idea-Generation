    "abstractText": "The packing interactions of a series of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) charge transfer (CT) near-IR absorbers based on platinum-dithiolene complexes are reinvestigated here as a case study also by using the Hirshfeld surface analysis. This analysis on systems, which exhibit the 1:1, 2:1 and 2:2 columnar stacking patterns between D and A, allows us to point out that several interactions of atoms and fragments are involved in the stacking interactions but also that only a limited fraction of these interactions, limited to the 1:1 D/A columnar stacking case, can be relatable to the absorption features of this class of compounds.",

The nature of the substituents at the C2S2 moieties affects the energy of the frontier orbitals where a significant mixing between the metal- a d ligand-centered orbitals occurs, as sho n i Scheme 2.\nScheme 2. Frontiers Molecular Orbitals for [ML2] compounds whose energies are pushed up [ML2]2+ or down [ML2]2\u2212 by strong \u03c0-donor or strong \u03c0\u2013acceptor substituent at the dithiolene core, respectively. Accordingly, [ML2]2+ or [ML2]2\u2212 can be isolated.\nThe HOMO\u2013LUMO transition in neutral complexes gives rise to an intense electronic transition at unusually low energies, and the related broad peak does not show vibrational fine structure, as occurs with organic dyes, such as the cyanines. Since the early 1990s, Mueller-Westerhoff highlighted the high potential of these complexes as NIR-dyes [3] tunable with the nature of substituents at the C2S2 moiety. Optical properties, combined with their thermal stability, have allowed their employment for a variety of applications including in Q-switching infrared lasers. More recently, dithiolene-dyes have been exploited in Photo Thermal Therapy (PTT) [4,5] and also proposed for bioimaging [6] by using the monoreduced 1,3-diisopropylimidazoline-2,4,5-trithione as a ligand, which is capable of providing dyes absorbing near 1000 nm, and with absorptivities falling in the range of the highest values so far achieved [7]. Moreover, heteroleptic dithiolene derivatives such as bipyridine/dithiolate Pt(II) square-planar complexes have been shown to be suitable precursors of NIR-dyes. The optical properties and related applications of these complexes have been widely investigated [8\u201310]. In these complexes, which display an asymmetric charge distribution, the HOMO has mixed contributions from both Pt and dithiolate orbitals, while the LUMO is diimine ligand based. Accordingly, the HOMO\u2013LUMO transition has a charge-transfer character (mixed metal\u2212ligand-to-ligandcharge transfer: MMLL\u2032CT) and gives rise to absorption peaks falling in the visible region at wavelengths that are tunable with the electro-donating\u2013accepting nature of the ligands. In addition, bipyridine/dithiolate Pt(II) square planar complexes have been employed as donors towards acceptors based on tetranitrile and nitrofluorenone system as acceptors [11] for the production of the so-called thin-film organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices [12\u201316]. OPVs comprise a molecular donor (D) in the form of a thin film (e.g., copper phthalocyanine, CuPc) together with a molecular acceptor (A) (e.g., fullerene), which interact in alternate or mixed layers. With the view to improve the properties of OPV devices by employing adducts with a better overlap of the absorption spectrum with the solar radiation Dunbar, Omary et al. [17], have deeply investigated the properties of the adducts 1\u20133, obtained by combining [Pt(dbbpy)(dmid)] with a planar tetranitrile system and adducts 4\u20137 obtained by combining [Pt(dbbpy)(tdt)] with nitrofluorenone derivatives (see compounds in Scheme 3).

An increase in absorbance across the visible and into the NIR region with respect that of the isolated donor and acceptors was observed in the adducts, but the desirable additional band into the NIR region at lower energy (with respect that of the isolated donor and acceptors) was observed only for adducts 5 and 7.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2566 3 of 12\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 13\nenergy (with respect that of the isolated donor and acceptors) was observed only for adducts 5 and 7.\nScheme 3.

Both the donor and the acceptor are based on d8-metal-dithiolenes [metal = Pd(II) or Pt(II)] with different charges (+2 and \u20132; see Scheme 2), associated with the nature of the substituents at the C2S2 moieties. In fact, taking into account the neutral form, the strong \u03c0-donor substituents close to the C2S2 (Me2pipdt and Et2dazdt) raise the energy of the frontier orbitals, thus yielding [ML2]2+ cationic complexes. In contrast, strong \u03c0-acceptor substituents (mnt and dtcr) lower the energies of the frontier orbitals, thus favoring the [ML2]2\u2212 anionic state (see Scheme 2).

            "text": "As shown in Scheme 3, the donor [Pt(dbbpy)(dmid)] (dbbpy = 4,4\u2032-di-tertbutyl-2,2\u2032bipyridine; dmid = 2-oxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dithiolate) is combined with the acceptors based on a planar tetranitrile system (TCNQ, TCNQF4 and TCNE), to form 1, 2 and 3 adducts as dark crystals. These adducts exhibited a 2:1 D/A ratio, even when a 1:1 D/A ratio was experimentally employed. In the diffuse reflectance spectra, the isolated donors exhibit the predictable MMLL\u2032CT peaks in the 550\u2013850 nm region. Moreover, in the 1, 2 and 3 adducts, no additional bands associated with the donor\u2013acceptor (DA) CT at lower energy are observed, but only an increase in absorbance across the visible and into the NIR region with respect that of the isolated donor and acceptors (\u03c0\u2192\u03c0*). The lack of DACT can be explained considering that the compounds 1\u20133 show a 2:1 donor\u2013acceptor stacking pattern, whereas it was established that a 1:1 DA arrangement is required to observe DACT absorption bands [26,27]. Despite the absence of a DACT, but considering the continuous absorption ranging from the UV to the NIR, these adducts were also tested as dyes in a TiO2 solar cell, and low conversion efficiencies were obtained. The adducts 4, 5, 6 and 7 comprise [Pt(dbbpy)(tdt)] as donor (tdt = 3,4-toluenedithiolate), whereas the acceptors are increasingly strong nitrofluorenone moieties: 2,7-dinitro-9-fluorenone (DNF), 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TRNF), or 2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenone (TENF). In 4, 5, 6 and 7, a 2:1 ratio of D/A molecules was employed to obtain the adducts (CH2Cl2 solutions of the donor with solutions of the organic acceptor in a CH2Cl2/C6H6 solution). Despite the experimental molar ratio adopted, adducts with a 1:1 D/A ratio were isolated in 4 and 5, while a 2:1 D/A ratio was invariably obtained in 6. Against this, 7 was obtained only when a 1:1 [Pt(dbbpy)tdt]:TENF ratio was used. No additional band with respect to the components was observed in 4 both in solution and in the solid state. Instead, the diffuse reflectance spectra show the presence of an additional band with respect to those of the components for 5 (825nm) and 7 (950 nm, see Figure 1). These bands, which become evident also in solution by the addition of TRNF or TENF to [Pt(dbbpy)(tdt)] falling in an NIR region free of peaks related to the reagents, are assigned to the DACT transition. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2566 5 of 12\nSingle crystal results have shown that the 1:1 D/A combination ratio gives rise to crystals with a 1:1 D/A stacking only for 5 and 7 (see related section), while a 2:2 -DDAAstacking is observed for 4. The absorptions features of 5 and 7 covering the visible region and significant ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths, have allowed us to include them among \u201cblack absorbers\u201d of interest for OPV devices (see Figure 1). As anticipated, the CT salts [Pt(Et2dazdt)2][Pt(mnt)2] (8), [Pt(Me2pipdt)2][Pt(mnt)2] (9), and [Pt(Me2pipdt)2][Pt(dtcr)2] (10) show the presence in the diffuse reflectance spectra of an additional band with respect to those of the components at 937 nm in 8, 1270 nm in 9 and 960 nm in 10. In Figure 1, the reflectance spectrum of 9 is reported as being a representative example to show the absorptions in the near-IR region where the donor and acceptor molecules alone do not absorb. Thus, according to the optical features of the adducts summarized above, it should be remarked that no growth of NIR peak is observed where adducts are based on donors displaying self-association. For electrostatic reasons, self-association is prevented when the donor entity is represented by a dianionic bis-dithiolate, and the acceptor is represented by bicationic Pt(II) complexes, while it may be competing for neutral donors showing an asymmetric charge distribution such as in the diimine-dithiolate cases. Another feature of paramount importance for both DACT and photovoltaic applications, is that related to the electrochemical properties of donors and acceptors (see Table 1). Concerning the CT, regardless of the packing motif, the more easily the donor is oxidized, and the acceptor reduced, the more important the DACT can be. However, for photovoltaic applications, in addition to suitable spectroscopic properties (absorption of light as intense and extended as possible) some electrochemical features are required. As an example, in the case of solar cell dyes, the molecular system (active medium) must present a first reduction peak a low potential (corresponding to an excited electronic state at higher energy than that of the conduction band of the semiconductor (SC)), as well as a first oxidation peak falling at higher potential then that of the redox electrolyte used in the cell. This allows an efficient electron transfer to the SC and the regeneration of the dye to its electronic ground state by reduction, respectively. The SC and the electrolyte usually employed are TiO2 and the couple I\u2212/I3\u2212, respectively; this requires reduction potentials more negative than \u22120.6 V and oxidation potentials more positive than +0.2 V. Analyzing the data reported in Table 1, it can be seen that whereas all the compounds fit the requirement for the oxidation potential, only 4, which do not present any additional CT absorption, shows a first reduction peak at values lower than \u22120.6 V. However, a higher number of compounds (i.e., 5, 8\u201310, in addition to 4) can be suitable for this kind of application if a SC with a conduction band at more positive energy value, such as SiO2 (\u22120.10 V), is used instead of TiO2."

In complexes 1\u20137, the acceptor is an organic molecule. At variance, in 8\u201310, the donor entity is represented by a dianionic bis-dithiolate Pt(II) complex, and the acceptor is represented by bicationic Pt(II) complexes. All systems form 1D columnar stacks, which differ by the type of stacking between the donor and acceptor. In particular, compounds 1\u20133 and 6 exhibit a 2:1 D/A ratio with a -DDADDADD- pattern, compounds 5, 7 and 8\u201310 exhibit a 1:1 D/A ratio with a -DADAD- pattern, and compound 4 exhibits a 2:2 D/A ratio with a -DDAADDAADD- pattern. In all cases, solvent molecules of crystallization are present in the structure, and they are usually interposed between the columnar stacking. The molecular structures of the complexes and their crystal packings were previously reported [11,17]. Nevertheless, a brief description of the crystal packing is summarized here with the view to highlight the DA interactions. Even though the compounds exhibit different stacking patterns, their structural arrangement can be divided into four groups according to the stacking similarities. Group 1 includes compounds 1, 2, 3 and 6, which exhibit a head-to-tail disposition of the donor D in both the -DAD- and in the -DD- sub-systems (Figure 2). Group 2 includes compounds 5 and 7, which exhibit a head-to-head arrangement in the -DAD- system (see Figure 3). Moreover, in 7, the presence of four nitro groups of the TENF molecule correspond to a larger steric hindrance with respect to the TRNF ligand. This implies that in 7, the acceptor TENF is slightly offside with respect to the stacking of the D functions.

The main difference is observed for the interactions exchanged by the donor in 5, in which there is a minor contribution deriving by the H atoms. The large contribution deriving by the H atoms in 1\u20137 is a consequence of the presence of t-butyl residues of dbbpy in the donor.

The acceptors of 4\u20137 show a trend which is in line with the increasing number of nitro groups along the series, and the O atoms in 6 and 7 dominates the interactions. The HS analysis on complexes 8\u201310 was already reported [22], and it is briefly summarized here for comparison purposes with those of compounds 1\u20137. According to the presence of the PtS4 system for both the donor and the acceptor entity, in 8\u201310, one of the dominant interactions is that involving the sulphur atoms. In addition, a considerable fraction of the interactions is exchanged by the N atoms in 8 and 9 and by the O atoms in 10, and this reflects the different molecular structure of the mnt and dtcr ligands. The C atoms of the donor are also involved in a good portion of the interactions. In the acceptor, the main type of interaction is that involving the H atoms followed by the S atoms. A distinctive feature that characterizes compound 9 and 10 with respect to the other ones is the presence of the Pt\u2013Pt interaction. This is a consequence of the alignment of the D and A moieties in the two complexes. The greater steric hindrance of Et2dadzt in 8, when compared to Me2pipdt in 9 and 10, limits the overlap between the molecular planes of A and D, and in particular, it has the effect of hindering the approach of the platinum atoms. In fact, in 8, the Pt atom of the acceptor is overlaid with the C-C fragment of the donor. In Figures 4\u20136, the interactions that occurs between D and A are highlighted."

            "text": "In the present work, we have analysed the stacking and interaction patters of ten D-A charge-transfer compounds consisting of donors based on platinum-dithiolene complexes and of acceptors based on tetranitrile, nitrofluorenone and platinum-dithiolene system, as a case study. All the compounds of known crystal structures exhibit columnar stack between D and A and the following stacking patterns are observed: 1:1 -DA- for complexes 5, 7\u201310; 2:1 -DDA- for complexes 1\u20133, 6; 2:2 -DDAA- for complex 4. The 1:1 -DA- stacking patterns alone (5, 7, 8, 9 and 10) have been shown to be suitable to give rise to the NIR CT transition. As a general observation, and according to the HS analysis, it is evident that the H atoms are responsible for a large portion of the interactions exchanged by the donor in 1\u20137 and by the acceptor in 8\u201310. This is a consequence of the functionalization with t-butyl, ethyl or methyl groups on the Bipy, Et2dazdt and Me2pipdt ligands, respectively. Moreover, the acceptor of 1\u20137 is an organic moiety, and the main source of interactions is provided by N (1\u20133) and O (4\u20137) atoms. It is reasonable to assume that the electronic communication between the donor and acceptor moieties leading to DACT transition (5, 7, 8, 9 and 10) is more efficient between electronically delocalized molecular fragments in D and A. In this respect, by analysing the HS results, it is evident that the charge transfer may occur through a minor fraction of the entire group of interactions exchanged by the D or A systems. An even more minor fraction is that involving the platinum atoms. Notwithstanding the limited fraction of these interactions, they play a crucial role in the charge transfer properties and absorption features of this class of DA compounds. Moreover, the A + D \u2192 A\u2212 + D+ CT process usually implies an electronic and structural reorganization of the A\u2212 and D+ components with respect to the parent A/D system. Thus, the structural analysis discussed here for 1\u201310, can describe the structural features of the initial A/D state but cannot describe the A\u2212/D+ one, which is not experimentally accessible. Nevertheless, the decomposition of the A/D system into different interacting fragments provides additional hints on the molecular components that can favour the CT process.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.P., P.D. and L.M.; methodology, D.E., L.P., F.A., A.S., P.D. and L.M.; formal analysis, L.P., F.A., P.D. and L.M.; investigation, D.E., L.P., F.A., A.S., P.D. and L.M.; resources, L.M.; data curation, L.P., F.A., P.D. and L.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.P., P.D. and L.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.E., L.P., F.A., A.S., P.D. and L.M.; visualization, D.E., L.P., F.A., P.D. and L.M.; supervision, L.P., F.A., P.D. and L.M.; project administration, L.P., P.D. and L.M.
