Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States, 3Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI, United States, 4College of Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States\nInfectious diseases, like COVID-19, pose serious challenges to university campuses, which typically adopt closure as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to control spread and ensure a gradual return to normalcy. Intervention policies, such as remote instruction (RI) where large classes are offered online, reduce potential contact but also have broad side-effects on campus by hampering the local economy, students\u2019 learning outcomes, and community wellbeing. In this paper, we demonstrate that university policymakers can mitigate these tradeoffs by leveraging anonymized data from their WiFi infrastructure to learn community mobility\u2014a methodology we refer to as WiFi mobility models (WIMOB). This approach enables policymakers to explore more granular policies like localized closures (LC). WIMOB can construct contact networks that capture behavior in various spaces, highlighting new potential transmission pathways and temporal variation in contact behavior. Additionally, WIMOB enables us to design LC policies that close super-spreader locations on campus. By simulating disease spread with contact networks from WIMOB, we find that LC maintains the same reduction in cumulative infections as RI while showing greater reduction in peak infections and internal transmission. Moreover, LC reduces campus burden by closing fewer locations, forcing fewer students into completely online schedules, and requiring no additional isolation. WIMOB can empower universities to conceive and assess a variety of closure policies to prevent future outbreaks.\nKEYWORDS\nCOVID-19, mobility, modeling, policy, non-pharmaceutical intervention, WiFi\n1. Introduction\nUniversity campuses are often hotspots for infectious disease outbreaks and hence are targeted for interventions. In the wake of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (1), the U.S. witnessed more than half a million cases at universities (2). On the event of infectious disease outbreaks, colleges must make crucial decisions to ensure continuity of operations in safe way (3,4). Controlling the disease at universities can be pivotal to securing the surrounding environment (5). To reduce on-campus infections and the likelihood of superspreading events, a recommended form of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) is partial closure of the campus (6).\n01 frontiersin.org\nDuring COVID-19, advancement in teleconferencing technology equips universities to continue operations by adopting a form of campus closure that relies on remote instruction (RI) (7). As a consequence, the campus community has fewer opportunities to visit spaces, such as classrooms, to congregate and risk transmission (8,9). One common approach campuses consider to design RI policies is to use enrollment data (EN) to assume contact and therefore, offer large classes online while other classes remain in person (10,11). In fact, during COVID-19, 44% colleges and universities in the U.S., primarily offered instruction online (12). However, these policies can still have broad, negative, and indiscriminate impact on the community by forcing students into completely remote course schedules. Such policies can have adverse effect on learning outcomes (13), where students can lose close to 7 months of education (14). Additionally, RI can disincentivize students to stay on campus and thus, universities incur losses in auxiliary revenue (e.g., boarding, parking, dining, etc.) (15,16), with universities standing to lose up to 50 million because of unused services (17). Even the local population unaffiliated with the university takes sustains losses to business due to university closures (18,19). Furthermore, with socioeconomic disparities and heterogeneous household contexts, the demands of remote\nFIGURE 1 The WiFi mobility models (WIMOB) methodology uses anonymized network lo logs reflect timestamps when people\u2019s devices associate with access points bipartite graph that describes people (e.g., P1, P2) visiting campus locations ( proxy their presence, we estimate collocation (e.g., P1 and P2 were collocat use the collocation network construct a SEIR\u2013based epidemiological ABM mobility behavior to evaluate and inform policy.

Relying on RI, university campuses struggle to balance community health with the demands of learning, economy, and broad wellbeing (22). Instead, there is a need for a more versatile approach to design closure policies that empowers policymakers to accurately assess impact of closure interventions and model more data-driven targeted intervention strategies.\nThis paper showcases a new approach that universities can take to design closure policies by leveraging data from their existing WiFi infrastructure. Our methodology, WiFi mobility models (WIMOB), involves constructing anonymized mobility networks of campus (Figure 1A), which helps determine extended periods of collocation\u2014or \u201cproximate contact\u201d (23)\u2014between individuals to describe contact networks on campus. Particularly, WIMOB enables a more expressive toolkit for university policymakers that represents contact longitudinally and allows them to assess closure at the granularity of a room, suite, or hall. Thus, it lends itself to the design of targeted interventions that focus on localized closures (LC). We demonstrate the utility of WIMOB with data collected over two years, of approximately 40,000 anonymous occupants and visitors of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), a large urban campus in the U.S.\u2014including about 16,000 undergraduate students, 9,000 graduate students, and 7,600 staff\ngs to model campus mobility for localized closures (LC) (A) WiFi network\n(APs) on campus.

In general, on comparing WIMOB to EN as an approach to model contact, we find that WIMOB captures contact behavior at a community scale for a variety of campus spaces, describes temporal variations in contact, and provides a better estimate of local context by being aware of occupancy and the non-student population. Using WIMOB also reveals that EN overestimates the impact of RI on reducing contact on campus. Hence, we propose a less burdensome alternative to RI, by deriving more targeted LC policies based on WIMOB (Figure 1) (indeed EN is too coarsegrained for designing targeted LC policies).\nWe further exhibit that LC presents better disease control outcomes than RI by constructing and simulating an agent-based epidemiological model (ABM) over the people\u2013people contact networks (Figure 1B) derived from the collocation identified with WIMOB (Figure 1A). Our ABM was calibrated with GT on-campus COVID-19 cases from the Fall semester of 2020 (24) and infection rates from Fulton County (25). To compare the effect of interventions, we construct a counterfactual semester\u2014 that is unaltered by other policy\u2013induced behaviors of 2020\u2014by leveraging WiFi data from Fall 2019 to determine the contact structure of the simulation. We assess the effectiveness of closure NPIs (Figure 1C) by simulating COVID-19 under various behavioral scenarios. We find LC is comparable to RI in controlling total infections but more effective at reducing the peak infections and internal transmission. Additionally, LC targets fewer locations, forces fewer students into fully online schedules, and does not isolate any more people than RI\u2014illustrating that WIMOB can help universities devise highly-specific closure policies, like LC, which can contain disease spread and mitigate campus disruption in comparison to RI policies.\nOur methodology also promises other advantages. Mobility generally has been used to dynamically model disease spread of influenza (26), rubella (27) and COVID-19 (9,28) showing the effectiveness of mobility restrictions at a regional\u2013, or city\u2013level (29\u201333). These studies typically rely on cell tower localization or aggregating GPS information from mobile phones (34). Neither of these data sources is easy to access for university campuses. At the same time, studies to infer campus mobility networks have relied on accessing user devices with specialized data logging applications (e.g., contact tracing mobile apps) (35\u201338), but these approaches are typically constrained for disease modeling because they require mass adoption to represent the entire community and continuous maintenance of software is needed to capture longitudinal behavior changes. In contrast, our work repurposes already existing managed WiFi networks to model mobility, which provides room level granularity for mobility (39\u201342) and consequently indicates proximate contact (23). Much like EN, universities internally archive such data over a long term for other purposes and do not need to install any additional surveillance infrastructure to access it. Prior work has repurposed such data for campuses of size 10,000\u201350,000 in different locations including Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S (39,43). With the appropriate privacy considerations, a university can obtain such data at a low cost, continuously and unobtrusively. The possibility of pandemic still looms large in the future (44,45). As campuses prepare for upcoming semestera and\nFrontiers in Digital Health 03\nunforeseen contagious diseases of tomorrow, WIMOB presents an attractive and practical method to inform better public health policies."

Before accessing the data we established a data-use agreement and an ethics protocol that was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Georgia Institute of Technology (Protocol H20208). For the WiFi data, we were provided access to logs from Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. We processed these logs to characterize mobility (WIMOB) and it encompasses all 40,000 unique visitors that connected to the network via 6,959 different access points (41). The logs did not contain any personally identifiable information and locations are also coded. The logs indicated the WiFi access point (AP) a device associates with and can therefore be used to infer dwelling locations of users across the entire campus. This is limited to indoor spaces where APs are located and the scope of this localization is at the granularity of a room or suite (39,43)). For EN we only used aggregate insights for enrollment, which were derived from course registration transcripts. Note, we did not cross-identify any students. We used publicly accessible course schedules to approximate schedules of de-identified nodes and infer if they were students or staff, and non-residential or residential. We elaborate on our data in Supplementary Material, Data.\nNote. Like most universities, GT\u2019s managed WiFi network is not equipped with any Real-Time Location System (RTLS) (46,47). RTLS systems use Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values from multiple neighboring APs to provide high precise localization of individuals in terms of time and space. However, deploying such systems requires surveying the entire network. Additionally, precision localization raises more privacy concerns. These factors together make it challenging for universities to justify the deployment of RTLS, unlike small retail settings that can monetize RTLS insights directly (e.g., insights on footfall can be tied to improving revenue).\nfrontiersin.org"

When using EN to model contacts, we implemented RI by removing connections between students who were only in contact through courses of size 30. When using WIMOB to model contacts, we removed connections between students if they were only connected because of collocations during scheduled lectures of such courses. Localized Closure (LC): We identified rooms\u2013level spaces that are\nhighly central location nodes in the network. We removed contacts between people who are only connected because of collocating at these locations.\nTo further elaborate, for RI we inferred enrollment size of each course in Fall 2019 by determining the number of unique individuals that visited lecture locations during scheduled times. After the first week, we applied the RI by removing all visiting edges in Kt for any lc [ LRI if visits were during lecture times of course c with an enrollment 30. This helped create counterfactual contact networks G0t . The removal of edges from K described the mobility budget of RI and the structure of G0t indicated the risk of exposure budget. We designed LC with these budgets by identifying locations for closure (LLC) with different algorithms, such as PageRank (48), Eigenvector Centrality (49), Load Centrality (50), and Betweenness Centrality (51). When a location was closed, we removed all edges in Kt connected to any lx [ LLC . We aggregated the movement graph\nFrontiers in Digital Health 04\nHt over a week and apply the algorithms to identify locations. Subsequently, we identified the number of top-ranked locations to remove such that the resultant counterfactual contact network G00t has is within 1% of the budget. More details for closure policies have been expanded in Supplementary Material, Identifying Locations for Closure.\nTo make the comparisons between the closure policies, we established fixed budgets to design LC based on the resource utilization on RI. We considered 2 kinds of budgets, (i) mobility reduction\u2014to depict space use on campus, and (ii) risk of exposure\u2014to reflect testing capacity. Also note, response to closure policies can lead to unpredictable side-effects in campus behavior, particularly when a student\u2019s schedule is entirely online. Therefore, we design policies within three behavioral scenarios (each with a varying budget):\n[S1] Persistence: Irrespective of the locations closed or classes\nrestricted, individuals continue their other visiting behaviors.\n[S2] Non-Residential Avoidance: Non-residential students stop all\nvisits to campus if they enrolled in at least 3 courses and the policy forces their entire academic schedule online. [S3] Complete Avoidance: Same as S2, but even residential students\navoid campus based on their schedule.\nThe budgets varied for different behavioral scenarios and we only compared policies within the same scenario. Similar to other works that model closure (11,52), we assume that when a location is shutdown, the individuals who ought to have visited that location isolated during the time.

External transmission arose because individuals could contract the virus outside campus and bring the infection back for local spread (7,53). We adopted data of positive cases from Fulton county (25) with a scaling factor a to estimate the probability that a susceptible individual, who is active on campus, was infected from interactions that take place outside campus. Internal transmissions are determined by p, as the probability of susceptible individuals in contact with an infectious one.

These drawbacks naturally motivate a new approach to design interventions. Since WIMOB mitigates the limitations of EN, we leveraged it to demonstrate the effectiveness of localized closure (LC) policies.\nWe used WIMOB to define the contact structure of each day and simulate COVID-19 with an agent-based model. Our ABM was overlayed by a modified SEIR compartmental model for COVID-19 for each agent. GT also had implemented a robust surveillance program on campus. Hence we calibrated the ABM on the positivity rate for COVID-19 for GT (24) in the first 5 weeks of Fall 2020 also incorporating external seeding from the surrounding Fulton County, GA (25). We validated our model by predicting future trends for the rest of Fall 2020. For robustness, we performed additional calibrations by varying time windows and university context (details in Supplementary Material, Sensitivity Analyses). We studied interventions by applying the ABM over the contact networks produced by WIMOB with data from Fall 2019\u2014a counterfactual to Fall 2020 if no closure had occurred (see Supplementary Material, Simulation Model for further details).

Additional details are present in Supplementary Material, Modeling Policy and Scenarios.\nWe present differences between LC and RI based on three infection reduction outcomes; peak infections (maximum active cases on a given day), internal transmission (exposure from infected individuals on campus), and total infections (cumulative cases at the end of the semester).

For example, in S2, RI achieved a 28:9% peak reduction, but LC showed reductions of 49:3% (mobility budget) and 48:1% (exposure risk budget). This was attained by closing 38 or 50 locations respectively. Therefore, with such policies, policymakers need to restrict fewer locations to remarkably minimize the pressure of active infections on campus (e.g., diagnoses, treatment, quarantining)."

In terms of internal transmission the\nfrontiersin.org\nreduction is significantly larger with LC (Table 2). However, when LC restricted the infections early in Fall 2019, it left more individuals susceptible to external transmission. College student behavior outside campus on weekends and breaks is known to impact local transmission (65). When policymakers consider LC they should also consider policies on re-entry or required testing based on off-campus activities. In terms of isolating individuals on campus, it\u2019s notable that LC and RI were similar in S2. Interestingly, in S3, where LC closed more than 100 locations, the percentage of isolated individuals per week was less than that of RI. This finding implies that LC can keep individuals on campus without forcing them into complete isolation. Here \u201cisolation\u201d refers to no form of proximate contact with any individual on campus\u2014extreme social distancing where individuals are not even collocated in the same suite or hall. While social distancing is a recommended countermeasure for COVID-19 (8), complete isolation can have adverse effects on psychological wellbeing (64,66,67). LC can help alleviate concerns of closure interventions that increase loneliness and limit social connectedness (66).\n3.2.5. LC identifies a wider variety of auxiliary spaces\nBy using WIMOB to design LC we were able to identify locations for closure at the granularity level of rooms, including unbound spaces such as lobbies and work areas. As policy design budgets changed with every behavioral scenario we found that LC identified different types of locations for closure. First, in S1, we found that most locations that LC targeted are a subset of the auditoriums\u2013like rooms where large classes would take place in Fall 2019. Note, LC needs to restrict only a few such spaces to utilize the same budget as RI. This is because, under S1, RI policies only altered visits to lectures, while these spaces are used for other purposes during other times (e.g., club activities and seminars). We also noted that LC targeted \u201chigh traffic\u201d locations like conference center lobbies which are typically used as waiting areas or for networking events. Next, in Scenario S2, we saw that in addition to spaces mentioned earlier, interestingly LC further restricted the use of smaller rooms (occupancy 13\u201335) which would not be affected by RI (as only classes of size 30 are offered online). LC also targeted areas in the recreation center (which includes locker rooms and indoor courts for 4\u201320 people). This insight indicates that our methodology WIMOB accounts for a diverse set of student activities. Moreover, we also found a selection of spaces that would not be frequented by the undergraduate population, such as lab areas and facility buildings like the police station. Lastly, in Scenario S3, LC targeted closure of activity in far more spaces than RI. However, the better outcomes can be attributed to the fact that LC diversified the potential restriction areas. LC restricted heavily used small study rooms or breakout rooms (for 1\u20136 people). Furthermore, it restricts use of spaces where multiple small groups of people can organically assemble, such as cafes, dining halls, and reading areas. We also observed that LC restricted activity in about 10 Greek Houses but does not target other housing areas\u2014 demonstrating its ability to restrict social behavior that could\nFrontiers in Digital Health 09\namplify disease spread. Figure S18D shows the diversity in locations for various LC policies."

This rate can be influenced by many latent factors (e.g., mask-wearing, hand washing, distancing, and compliance). To study any effect of these variations, we also calibrated on different time windows throughout the semester. We calibrate on weeks 5\u20139 and 10\u201314 in Fall 2020, and validate on the remaining semester. In both cases, compared to RI, we found that LC still exhibits better reduction in peak infections (up to 90%) and internal transmission (up to 77%). In the original calibration, LC maintained the same level of total infections as RI, but with the new periods we found total infections were substantially less than RI (Tables S8 and S9). Another important variable for positivity is the wider context of the campus e.g. urban/rural, the surrounding county, city, etc. To investigate this, we also calibrated our ABM on the positivity rate of different universities in the US in Fall 2020 (along with information from their county to seed external cases). Consider this as a hypothetical where the mobility of the GT community remains the same but disease outcomes resemble a different campus. We calibrated on data from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of California, Berkeley. We found no remarkable differences from our findings with GT (Tables S10 and S11)."

On a campus, a common form of NPI is closure (70). Universities consider enrollment data (EN) to design remote instruction (RI) for closure to support continued operations safely (11). However, EN can misconstrue contact on campus, and RI policies can have broad impacts despite their effects on curbing the disease spread. This paper demonstrates that repurposing logs from a managed WiFi network (WIMOB) can help design effective localized closure policies (LC). We show that WIMOB uncovers rich contact dynamics and provides policymakers multiple dimensions to design policies like LC. We simulate COVID-19 with an ABM that harnesses WIMOB to compare RI and LC. As universities plan for future semesters, our results present evidence that LC designed with WIMOB can lead to improved infection reduction outcomes, while simultaneously relaxing burdens on the campus caused by coarse-grained broad RI policies."

            "text": "In practice LC policies should be deployed in conjunction with the other tools as well like testing, tracing, and quarantining. WIMOB can complement disease-specific knowledge to identify closure spaces. For example, small indoor spaces with poor ventilation increase the risk of infection for COVID-19 (71), while\nfrontiersin.org\nother algorithm-identified locations for closure might not require closure because users of a space are compliant with mask-wearing and testing. Further, as a pandemic progresses and public health guidance develops (72), with WIMOB, campuses can regulate the restriction of LC policies and anticipate the path to \u201cnormal\u201d operations (3,4). Moreover, WIMOB captures various spillover effects that cannot be captured in methods like EN. For instance, with WIMOB we observe that the mobility in Fall 2020 was 39% of that in Fall 2019 because the on-ground policies lead to certain staff working remotely as well. With additional information, WIMOB enables policymakers to model such scenarios and design alternatives like LC with new budgets. Policymakers can use WIMOB as a versatile tool to explore dynamic intervention strategies as well. Prior work shows that staggering policy restrictions could have variable impact on campus (73). Accordingly, WIMOB could be used to build an adaptive version of LC that updates at different points in the semester based on expected mobility changes. Additionally, depending on campus priorities and resource limitations, different campuses can use this same data to model policies differently. The effectiveness of reopening policies is expected to be sensitive to a campus\u2019 specific context that includes physical infrastructure, overarching guidelines, and human compliance (5). For certain campuses policies might not need to be constrained by exposure risk as testing might be frequent, ubiquitous, and voluminous. Other campuses could have limits on quarantining capacity. Policymakers might even consider the cost trade-offs by actually forecasting actual financial losses incurred by reduction in mobility (31), or valuate loss of services based on community needs (74). We elaborate on these considerations in the Supplementary Material, Implications for Policy Design."

University can access logs from the managed network internally as it is passively collected. Moreover, it does not require any new form of surveillance sensing but universities must revise terms of use and stay sensitive to community perspectives. Despite population mobility being valuable for many applications (75), accumulating localization data can be a major privacy concern (76). Instead, operational applications need to conceive approaches that only retain insights on locations to shutdown but not individual data. Similarly, any operational use needs to employ differential privacy to limit what stakeholders can learn from the data (77) (e.g., decision-makers can only get a list of candidate locations to close). In the Supplementary Material, Discussion, we further detail approaches to reconcile privacy, ethics and legal considerations."

Our analyses capture heterogeneity in individual behavior but does not account for differences in intrinsic vulnerabilities, which are related to severity of risk (67,78,79) and disparity in burden of shutdowns on demographic groups (30). WIMOB can be extended with other streams of data to characterize subcontexts in the population and devise new forms of LC to explicitly study the impact of policies on specific vulnerable subgroups in the community. Additionally, our work explores the avoidance based behavioral responses to closure interventions with assumptions in line with prior work (11,52). Researchers and policymakers can be interested in substitution behaviors where the population visits new locations when others are closed. WIMOB has the flexibility to model more nuanced spillover effects. Exploring different ways to remove and reallocate edges in the contact network is interesting future work. Lastly, WIMOB was built on GT\u2019s managed WiFi infrastructure with expansive coverage reflecting a large proportion of the campus population and its physical space. The coverage at other campuses might vary depending on how the access points are setup as well as the populations connectivity preferences. These variations can lead to under-representation of certain behaviors during policy evaluation. Thus, future studies can investigate the efficacy of WIMOB by systematically simulating different configurations of WiFi coverage.
