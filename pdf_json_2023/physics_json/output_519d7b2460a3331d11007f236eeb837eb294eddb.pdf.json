            "text": "The strength of the aurophilicity or metallophilicity in multinuclear complexes has been discussed in many previous articles.1\u201314 Although several heterometallic complexes exhibit suitable optoelectronic properties there are fewer examples of coinagemetal containing molecules with short M\u2013M0 bonds. Molecules with closed-shell (d10\u2013d10)2\u20137,13 interactions have also been studied for their interesting luminescence properties in organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices.8\u201313 Omary et al. reported an approximately order-of-magnitude higher binding energy for the M\u2013M0 bond by comparing the relative strengths of closedshell M\u2013M interactions \u2013 all of which were pertaining to intermolecular M\u2013M0 bonding phenomena.6,7 Gambarotta, and co-workers12 reported an early synthesis of a ligand-supported pentameric structure of an arylcopper ([CuMes]5), 1, exhibiting a m2-C1-atom (i.e., the carbanionic C-atom in the 1-position) as a\nsingle-atom bridging mode for two adjacent metal atoms in each phenyl ring; see Fig. 1.

Later, the significant role of electron correlation in this type of closed-shell/closed-shell interaction was pointed out by Pyykko\u0308 et al.16\u201321 who have also mentioned the importance of relativistic effects on the Au(I)\u2013Au(I) aurophilic bonding (d10\u2013d10) in closed-shell molecules such as [Au(PH3)Cl]2.\n14\u201317 In these calculations, no M\u2013M interaction was observed with the Hartree-Fock (HF) treatment, whereas at the second-order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset (MP2) level, which includes electron correlation, relativistic calculations yield a deep potential minimum at an Au(I)\u2013Au(I) equilibrium distance of 2.657 \u00c5 19. On the other hand, extended Hu\u0308ckel theory (EHT)37\u201340 calculations carried out by Mehrotra and Hoffmann23\u201325 suggested the importance of the mixing of empty bonding combinations of the 4s/4p atomic orbitals (AOs) into the occupied 3d-block.

Herein we focus on the aforementioned experimental/ computational Gambarotta/Hoffmann\u2019s [CunAu5 n(m\nC1-Mes)5] complexes (starting with n = 3 in this first theoretical investigation en route to ongoing experimental/computational efforts with other n values and M\u2013M0 combinations). Distinct from previous efforts by members of this research team, the parent M\u2013M system being emulated is Cu\u2013Cu instead of Au\u2013Au. Hence, this allows for a higher chance of uncovering new M\u2013M0 species whereby theory predicts experiment in terms of shorter M\u2013M0 distances, but not necessarily larger dissociation energies, given the much shorter covalent radius of Cu(I) than Au(I) as reflected in the respective parent compounds. Indeed, some of the results obtained have attained both shorter distances and higher bonding energies in both the MM0 heterometallic and the MM or M0M0 homometallic clusters, which are guiding ongoing experiments.\nHere, we also show that the hybridization, which was suggested by Hoffmann, plays an important role for the M\u2013M0 interaction, whereas the metallophilic interaction plays a smaller role because it contributes significantly less than hybridization to the bonding when the M\u2013M0 distance is short, and the bonding is strong. We have here carried out calculations at the DFT and MP2 levels to investigate the short genuine M\u2013M0 quasi-covalent metallophilic bonds and to estimate the M\u2013M0 bonding energy in pentanuclear\nM3M 0 2 Mes5\u00f0 \u00de and the related analogous tetranuclear M2M 0 2 Me3SiCH2\u00f0 \u00de4 organometallic complexes (and the opposite nuclearity thereof to assess the thermodynamic/kinetic factors affecting the experimental nuclearity for each). The nature of the interaction between the closed-shell Cu(I)\u2013Cu(I), Ag(I)\u2013Cu(I) or Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) atoms at such short distances and the role of the d10\u2013 d10 bonding have been studied for complexes containing the three coinage metals."

Phys., 2023, 25, 7642\u20137647 This journal is \u00a9 the Owner Societies 2023\nThe DFT-optimized molecular structure of [Cu3Au2(Mes5)] 2 shown in Fig. 2 has short Cu\u2013Au distances of 2.587 \u00c5 (see Table 1) suggesting that there is a strong (d10\u2013d10) interaction between the Cu(I) and Au(I) ions. The elongation in the Cu\u2013Au and Cu\u2013Ag distances for models 2 or 3 as compared to the Cu\u2013Cu distance for model 1 is similar or even smaller than the B12 and B20 pm larger covalent radii of Au(I) and Ag(I) as compared to the one of Cu(I), respectively.46\nThe EHT calculations yield the short M\u2013M0 distances that result in a large overlap of the d orbitals of 0.125 in 1 and 0.102 in 2, suggesting that there is strong spd mixing in the bonding as previously reported by Hoffmann et al.23\u201325 Molecular structure optimization was also carried out at the MP2 level yielding an Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) distance of 2.720 \u00c5, which is also 0.24 \u00c5 shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii. The M\u2013C\u2013M0 angle obtained at the MP2 level is 76.21.\nThe calculated binding energy of [Cu5(Mes5)] is 256 kcal mol 1, which was obtained in an energy decomposition analysis (EDA) at the TPSS level with unrelaxed fragments. This corresponds to a binding energy of 51 kcal mol 1 for the Cu(I)\u2013Cu(I) bond in [Cu5(Mes5)]. The EDA calculation on [Cu3Au2(Mes5)] yields a binding energy of 251 kcal mol 1 suggesting that the strength of the Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bond is 50 kcal mol 1. Allowing structural relaxation of the fragments leads to a slightly smaller binding energy of 201 kcal mol 1 for both [Cu3Au2(Mes5)] and [Cu5(Mes5)], which is 40 kcal mol 1 per metal\u2013metal bond. Calculating the binding energies of [Cu5(Mes5)] and [Cu3Au2(Mes5)] at the MP2\nlevel yielded slightly larger values of 335 kcal mol 1 and 337 kcal mol 1, respectively, which correspond to binding energies of about 67 kcal mol 1 for both the Cu(I)\u2013Cu(I) and the Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bond.\nCalculations on a model compound with only one Cu\u2013Au bond and without the large mesityl ligands yielded an Au(I)\u2013 Cu(I) binding energy of 15.4 kcal mol 1 and a bond length of 2.87 \u00c5. The binding energy of the model compound is 18.7 kcal mol 1 at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles level with a Cu\u2013Au distance that is 25 pm longer than that obtained at the TPSS level. The model compound represents a system with a metallophilic interaction, whereas the polydentate bonding of the metals in the pentamers leads to short metal\u2013metal distances and strong metal\u2013metal bonds.\nThe bond strengths of the Cu(I)\u2013Cu(I) and Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bonds are significantly larger than metallophilic interactions suggesting that the Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bond in 2 has a significant contribution of a polar-covalent bond (nd10 (M) - (n + 1)s/p (M0) as opposed to nd10\u2013n0d10). The population analysis on 2 yielded the following occupations for Cu and Au orbitals: 3d9.78, 4s0.51, 4p0.23 and 5d9.65, 6s0.86, 6p0.25, respectively, demonstrating significant spd hybridization/mixing in the M\u2013M0 bonding.\nSimilar calculations on [Cu3Ag2(Mes5)] yielded a short Ag(I)\u2013 Cu(I) distance of 2.58 \u00c5 (see Table 1). The EDA calculations at the TPSS/def2-TZVP level yielded a binding energy of 241 kcal mol 1 for [Cu3Ag2(Mes5)], which corresponds to a bond strength of 47 kcal mol 1 for the Ag(I)\u2013Cu(I) bond. The EDA calculation suggests that it might also be possible to synthesize [Cu3Ag2(Mes5)]. For 3, we obtained the following shell occupations for Cu and Ag: 3d9.77, 4s0.49, 4p0.25 and 4d9.83, 5s0.53, 5p0.31, respectively. At the DFT-D3 level, the calculations yielded slightly shorter M\u2013M0 and M\u2013C bond lengths as compared to the bond distances obtained in the DFT calculations without the D3 correction (see Table 1). The atomic charges calculated from the charge density are 0.06/0.05e for the Au/Cu atoms in 2 and are 0.01/ 0.07e for Cu/Ag atoms in 3. The metals are practically neutral at the DFT level. Further details are in Table S3 (ESI\u2021), which suggests the general bond strength order Ag\u2013Cu 4 Au\u2013Cu 4 Cu\u2013Cu due to the reduction of Pauli repulsion in that order.\nAn alternative organometallic cluster with a silicon-containing ligand is shown in Fig. 3. It has attained a tetranuclear structure instead of the pentanuclear geometry.

Table 2 contains some geometric parameters of the coordination sphere plus the Si\u2013CH2 bond in the two mixed-metal clusters and in the parent Cu2L04 complex, which are compared to the available experimental data. The calculated M\u2013M0 distances and bond angles in Table 2 agree qualitatively to those in Table 1 and to the experimental Cu\u2013Cu distance in 4. That is, the elongation in the Cu\u2013Au or Cu\u2013Ag distance values in Table 2 for molecule 5 or molecule 6 as compared to the Cu\u2013Cu distance in molecule 4 is similar or smaller than the B12 and 20 pm elongation in Au(I) and Ag(I) covalent radii with respect to the one of Cu(I), respectively.46 The calculations on the M2M02L 0 4 and M3M02L5\nclusters suggest that stronger metal\u2013metal bonding could be anticipated in the MM0 containing clusters\nas compared to the homometallic Cu clusters. However, the present calculations yielded almost identical binding energies of the metal\u2013metal bonds, regardless of whether they are Cu(I)\u2013 Cu(I), Ag(I)\u2013Cu(I) or Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bonds.\nWe have investigated the effect of an alternative nuclearity in\nboth [Cu5L5] and Cu4L 0 4 clusters, the structural parameters of which are reported in Tables S1 and S2 of the ESI.\u2021 We have calculated the total energy at the TPSS/def2-TZVP and MP2/ def2-TZVP levels for [Cu5L5] where L = mesityl and have compared the energy to the one for [Cu4L4]. Comparison of the energy contribution from each CuL moiety shows that [Cu5L5] is slightly stabilized with respect to [Cu4L4] by the additional van der Waals interaction energy between the ligands. The pentamer is, therefore, obtained in the synthesis likely due to the combination of this small thermodynamic stabilization also with the possibly that it is the kinetic product. The Cu4L04 cluster, on the other hand, was obtained in a previous experimental study as a tetranuclear complex instead of the pentanuclear one,45 possibly due to the larger Sicontaining organometallic trimethylsilylmethyl ligand that would add strain to an alternative planar-pentanuclear cluster as that of the mesityl system. Another reason why the tetramer is obtained in the synthesis might be the smaller dispersion interaction between the trimethylsilylmethyl groups than between the mesityl groups. One of the present authors has engaged in related work on cyclic non-organometallic multinuclear pyrazolate complexes,47 which have shown a similar dependence on the steric effect of the ligand on the nuclearity of trinuclear vs. tetranuclear reaction products, akin to what we predict for the two organometallic systems studied here.\nWe also assessed the isomerisation energy of the [Cu3Au2L5] complex. The total energy of the [Cu3Au2L5] complex without any Au\u2013Au bonds is 3 kcal mol 1 lower than the energy of the [Cu3Au2L5] complex with one Au\u2013Au bond. Therefore, we have not investigated the other possible MM0 isomers with M0\u2013M0 bonds. An exhaustive theoretical study of all possible isomers is not needed at this stage when experimental studies are still missing.\nThe EHT calculations predict that the heterometallic complexes have an overlap population of B0.1, leading to a d\u2013s/d\u2013p mixing of the M and M0 atomic orbitals. The amount of mixing from the empty (n + 1)s and (n + 1)p orbitals with the orbitals of the closed (n)d shell depends on the length of the Cu(I)\u2013Au(I) bond. The orbital mixing in 2 occurs between the 6s/6p orbitals of Au(I) with the 3d orbitals of Cu(I) instead of the 4s/4p orbitals of Cu(I) with the 5d orbitals of Au(I), as concluded by Galassi et al. in the study of such systems and claimed Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) polarcovalent bonding.7\nThe extended Hu\u0308ckel molecular orbital (EHMO) diagram of the hypothetical [M2]\n2+ and [MM0]2+ complexes without or with significant spd mixing is shown in Fig. 4. The analysis reveals large differences in terms of the s and s* bond character of [M2]\n2+ and [MM0]2+. Since the energy levels of M and M0 are different, the (n)d/(n + 1)s/p interaction is also different, showing a wide gap between the s and s* orbitals, which is seen on the right-hand side of the MO diagram in Fig. 4.\nFig. 3 The experimental molecular structure of the tetranuclear cluster,\nCu4L 0 4 (4, top), and a proposed mixed-metal analogue, Cu2Au2L 0 2 (5,\nbottom).\nTable 2 Selected interatomic distances and bond angles for the tetranuclear M4L 0 4 and M2M 0 2L 0 4 complexes (L0 = Me3SiCH2) calculated at the TPSS/def2-TZVP level (columns 2\u20134) are compared to the HF values (column 5) and to the available experimental data for [Cu4L4] (column 6)\nCu4L 0 4 4 Cu2Au2L 0 4 5 Cu2Au2L 0 4 6\nCu2L 0 4 4\n(HF) Cu4L\n0 4 4\n(exp.)45\nSi\u2013CH2 1.891 1.892 1.861 1.851 M\u2013M0 2.544 2.575 M\u2013M 2.369 2.383 2. 384 2.810 2.417 M0\u2013C 2.371 2.171 2.574 2.112 2.417 M\u2013C 2.011 2.121 2.240 2.001 M\u2013C\u2013M 71.5 72.3 71.2 82.5 73.8 M\u2013C\u2013M0 73.4 71.8\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

At shorter M\u2013M0 distances, the empty s and p orbitals contribute to the bonding, primarily via hybridization of the dz2 and pz orbitals, which introduces partial s-bonding with polarcovalent character to the M\u2013M0 bond. The 4s and 4p orbitals on Cu(I) stabilize the bonding and antibonding combination of the Au 5d orbitals, leading to stronger Cu\u2013Au interactions for the dxy and dx2 y2 orbitals in the xy plane.\nThe question of metallophilic or covalent M\u2013M0 bonding was investigated in a simplified [Cu3Au2(Me5)] model using methyl groups instead of mesityl groups. We determined the equilibrium distance (Re) at the HF and TPSS/D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP levels of theory, i.e., without and with electron correlation included.\nThe HF calculations yielded a minimum at 2.65 \u00c5, showing a short M\u2013M0 bond. At the TPSS-D3 level, we obtained a shorter equilibrium distance of 2.46 \u00c5. While the shorter Cu\u2013Au distance and a deeper potential well are expected at the TPSS-D3 level than in the HF calculations, a potential energy scan yielded an unmistakable potential well at the HF level, which represents strong evidence for the polar-covalent character of the Au(I)\u2013Cu(I) bonding. This is in contrast to the non-covalent metallophilic bonding behaviour whereby this same kind of approach used by Pyykko\u0308 and co-workers had attained a significant potential well only when electron correlation was considered, which is usually done by performing MP2 calculations that then yield a potential well, whereas a non-bonding curve is obtained at the HF level.16\u201322 However, note that the electrostatic attraction and the small ligand bite size also contribute to the total binding energy. This situation may necessitate future investigations of the breakdown of the relative interaction strength of various attractive/repulsive forces by studying other species that are less\nsensitive to coulombic M\u2013L attraction, which is necessary to avoid interference with the concomitant variations in the potential energy surface of the M\u2013M0 interaction.\nTo assess the contribution of dispersion into the total cluster stabilization and geometry, we have done full optimization at the TPSS and TPSS-D3(BJ) levels. Optimization at the TPSSD3(BJ) level leads to distortions of the orientation of the ligands due to van der Waals interactions between the mesityl groups. Such distortions do not occur in the solid state.\nIn conclusion, optimization of the molecular structures of the studied pentanuclear M3M02 Mes5\u00f0 \u00de complexes yielded M\u2013M0 distances that are much shorter than the M\u2013M0 distances of molecules with metallophilic interactions, which are dominated by van der Waals interactions and strengthened by relativistic effects. Orbital analysis and EHT calculations show that the s, p and d orbitals form hybrid orbitals that contribute to the bond between the metals. The role of hybridization is verified by performing calculations at the Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) level. The HF calculations that do not consider electron correlations and van der Waals interactions also yielded a bound complex implying that a chemical bond with shared electrons is to some extent formed. The hybridization is stronger between metals with different electronegativities suggesting that it might be possible to synthesize mixed coinage metal complexes. The binding energy of the M\u2013M0 bond is 40\u201350 kcal mol 1. The Cu\u2013Au interaction energy and the equilibrium distance calculated for [Cu3Au2(Mes5)] complexes by using different levels of theory showed a deep minimum at a short M\u2013M0 distance."
