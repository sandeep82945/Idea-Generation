    "abstractText": "Realizing sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) magnets without any manipulation will greatly enrich potential application of spintronics devices. The simplest and most desirable situation should be 2D magnets with intrinsic DMI and intrinsic chiral spin textures. Here, we propose to realize DMI by designing periodic ripple structures with different curvatures in low-dimensional magnets and demonstrate the concept in both one-dimensional (1D) CrBr2 and two-dimensional (2D) MnSe2 magnets by using firstprinciples calculations. We find that DMIs in curved CrBr2 and MnSe2 can be efficiently controlled by varying the size of curvature c, where c is defined as the ratio between the height h and the length l of curved structure. Moreover, we unveil that the dependence of firstprinciples calculated DMI on size of curvature c can be well described by the three-site FertL\u00e9vy model. At last, we uncover that field-free magnetic skyrmions can be realized in curved MnSe2 by using atomistic spin model simulations based on first-principles calculated magnetic parameters. The work will open a new avenue for inducing DMI and chiral spin textures in simple 2D magnets via curvature.",

            "text": "Realizing sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in intrinsic two-dimensional (2D)\nmagnets without any manipulation will greatly enrich potential application of spintronics\ndevices. The simplest and most desirable situation should be 2D magnets with intrinsic DMI\nand intrinsic chiral spin textures. Here, we propose to realize DMI by designing periodic ripple\nstructures with different curvatures in low-dimensional magnets and demonstrate the concept\nin both one-dimensional (1D) CrBr2 and two-dimensional (2D) MnSe2 magnets by using first-\nprinciples calculations. We find that DMIs in curved CrBr2 and MnSe2 can be efficiently\ncontrolled by varying the size of curvature c, where c is defined as the ratio between the height\nh and the length l of curved structure. Moreover, we unveil that the dependence of first-\nprinciples calculated DMI on size of curvature c can be well described by the three-site Fert-\nL\u00e9vy model. At last, we uncover that field-free magnetic skyrmions can be realized in curved\nMnSe2 by using atomistic spin model simulations based on first-principles calculated magnetic\nparameters. The work will open a new avenue for inducing DMI and chiral spin textures in\nsimple 2D magnets via curvature.\nIntroduction.\u2014The antisymmetric exchange coupling, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) [1,2], arising from inversion symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), plays\nan essential role in stabilizing topological protected non-collinear chiral magnetic\nconfigurations [3-7]. The presence of DMI is confirmed in the noncentrosymmetric B20\nmaterial MnSi [8], in which magnetic skyrmions are first observed. Recently, many reports\nhave further demonstrated DMI can be induced at interfaces of 3d/5d metal [9-11],\nmetal/oxides [12-15], or light elements such as graphene [16,17], oxygen and hydrogen, etc.\n[18,19]. Notably, experimental progresses have demonstrated that magnetic order of two-\ndimensional (2D) magnets can persist down to monolayer, which is useful for the study of\nfundamental physics and for engineering spintronic devices [20-22]. As for non-collinear\nmagnetism, several effective methods are proposed to obtain sizeable DMI in 2D materials,\nsuch as in 2D Janus magnets [23-25], intrinsic 2D multiferroics [26,27] and van der Waals\nFerromagnet-Based heterostructures, etc. [28-32], in which inversion symmetry breaking plays\na significant role.\nIn practice, it is inevitable to induce ripples for a 2D material either free standing or on a\nsubstrate as long as the size of 2D material is large enough, which has been reported in graphene\n[33,34], and MoS2 [35,36], etc. If such a curved system is magnetic, it is highly possible to\nachieve DMI in pure 2D magnets. Here, we propose to realize sizeable DMI by designing\nperiodic ripple structures with different curvatures in low-dimensional magnets. We\ndemonstrate the concept in both 1D CrBr2 and 2D MnSe2 structures, in which DMI can be\nefficiently tuned by magnitude of curvatures. Moreover, we validate that the variation of\ncurvature-dependent DMI can be well interpreted by Fert-L\u00e9vy mechanism. Interestingly,\nusing atomistic spin model simulations based on first-principles calculated magnetic\nparameters, we find that field-free chiral magnetic skyrmions can be realized in 2D MnSe2.\nThese examples provide a new routine towards realizing chiral magnetic skyrmions in 2D\nmagnets with long-range magnetic orderings, e.g., CrGeTe2 [37], CrI3 [38] and Fe3GeTe2 [39],\netc.\nComputational details.\u2014Our first-principles calculations are performed within the\nframework of density-functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio\nsimulation package (VASP) [40]. We choose the Predev-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals of\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) [41] to deal with the exchange-correlation energy.\nBesides, Projector augmented plane wave (PAW) method [42,43] is adopted to deal with the\ninteraction between nuclear electrons and valence electrons. In order to correctly describe the\n3d electrons, we employ the GGA+U method [44] with an effective U = 2 eV and U = 3 eV for\nMn and Cr as reported in previous studies [45,46], respectively. We build up a 7 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 CrBr2 and 6\u221a3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 MnSe2 supercells to construct magnetic structures with different curvatures. The energy cutoff for plane wave expansion is set to 520 eV. \u0393-centered 7 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 for 1D CrBr2\nand 2 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 1 for 2D MnSe2 k-point meshes are adopted for the Brillouin zone (BZ) integration\nto relax supercell, respectively. All the structures are fully relaxed until the Hellmann-Feynman\nforce acting on each atom and convergence criteria for energy are 0.001 eV/\u00c5 and is 1\u00d710-7eV,\nrespectively.\n1-Dimensinal CrBr2.\u2014For simplification of analysis, we first investigate curvature-\ndependent DMI in 1D magnet CrBr2. Similar to CuCl2 and CuBr2, bulk CrBr2 has the\nmonoclinic space group C12/m1 [47-49]. In each CrBr2 layer, the ribbons made up of edge-\nsharing CrBr4 squares along b-axis. It has been not experimentally reported whether one-\ndimensional CrBr2 can be exfoliated from bulk so far. In our paper, we use the simple 1D\nstructure to demonstrate the dependence of DMI on size of curvature c. The obtained 1D CrBr2\nhas D2h crystal symmetry which preserved spatial inversion symmetry, as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nFor achieving ripples, a 7 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 supercell is constructed and the length l of entire supercell is\nadjusted gradually in our calculations. Next, we keep two unit cells (located at the edges of\nsupercell) fixed in z direction and relax all other atoms to obtain final curved structures (Figs.\n1(b)-1(d)). In order to articulate our ideas, we present the schematic diagram (Fig. 5) consisting\nof sine and piecewise functions, in which the inversion symmetry with symmetry center i of\nsine function (red dotted line) will be broken in the piecewise function (blue line). This\npiecewise structure is an approximation for the effect of substrate on curvature. With this\npremise, we study how magnetic parameters change under different size of curvature c for a\nseries of curved structures (Figs. 1(a)-1(d)). Firstly, we study curvature-dependent magnetic\nproperties of 1D CrBr2. Figure 6(a) shows the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nconfigurations. It is found that the calculated energy difference between AFM and FM\nevidently decreases with increasing c, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Moreover, the spin ordering tends\nto be AFM when c is larger than 15.4%. In Fig. 7(a), we also investigate absolute value of\nmagnetic moment per Cr atoms as c increases. In general, the magnetic moment variation of\neach magnetic atom is relatively weak and tends to decrease with increase of curvature.\nFigure 1(g) shows the result of DMI for curved 1D CrBr2 with different c. Obviously, DMI\nis strongly dependent on size of curvature c and the calculated DMI strength increases with the\nincrement of size of curvature c. Here, positive D represents spin configuration of\nanticlockwise (ACW) chirality, negative one represents clockwise (CW) chirality. For total\nFIG. 3. Summing over all M-X-M trimers based on Fert-L\u00e9vy model (Eq. (3)) in (a) 1D CrBr2 and (b) 2D MnSe2, respectively. Insets (i) and (j) represent structures with/without inversion symmetry, in which both \u03b8 (\u03b8i , i = 1,2) and a are bond angle of each M-X-M trimer and bond length between the nearest neighbor M atoms.\nDMI D of 1D CrBr2 with different size of curvature c, its value varies from 0 to 1.0 meV/f.u.. Otherwise, In Figs. 1(e)-1(f) the total energy ( ) and DMI energy \u2206 ( ) including SOC are presented as a function of spin spiral vector q along \u2212 direction in 2D BZ for c = 30.5% and c = 34.1%, respectively. The extracted DMI are found to be 0.93 and 1.00 meV/f.u.,\nrespectively, suggesting that DMI of 1D CrBr2 is directly associated with the existence of\ncurvature. Considering the fact that 2D magnets, such as CrGeTe3, CrI3, Fe3GeTe2, and MnSe2\n[50] with long-range ferromagnetic orderings have been synthesized experimentally, we take\nthe simplest one MnSe2 as an example to further investigate the feasibility of tunable DMI in\n2D magnets.\n2-Dimensional MnSe2.\u2014It is recently reported that monolayer 2D MnSe2 with D3d\ncrystalsymmetry is a room temperature ferromagnet [50]. The optimized MnSe2 structure is\npresented in Fig. 2(a). It can be seen that each Mn atom is surrounded by six non-magnetic Se atoms that make up an octahedron. Similar to 1D CrBr2, we construct a 6\u221a3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 supercell to obtain ripple structures, in which Mn atoms of three unit cells (located at initial and terminal\nof the supercell) are fixed in the z direction and the other atoms are relaxed (Figs. 2(b)-2(d)).\nTo understand magnetism associated with curved structures, we construct FM and AFM states\nin Fig. 6(b). It is found that the energy difference between AFM and FM suddenly decreases\nand then keeps increasing as the c gradually increases (Fig. 6d). We also compute the magnetic\nmoment of Mn atoms from Mn1 to Mn12, as shown in Fig. 7d. Compared to 1D CrBr2, there\nis a distinct difference that the magnetic moments of Mn atoms located at peaks and troughs\nFIG. 4. (a) Atomistic spin model simulated spin configurations for a curved MnSe2 with size of curvature c of 31.6%, (b) zoom in of an isolated skyrmion profile.\nhave large variation due to the locally severe structural deformation, while others don\u2019t change\nmuch.\nIn Fig. 2(i), we display the calculated results of DMI for 2D MnSe2 with curvature. In 2D\nMnSe2 structure, the global tendency of DMI is increasing as c gradually increases, similar as\nthat of 1D CrBr2. In 2D MnSe2, there are two DMI vectors when spin spiral vector q propagates along directions of \u2212 and \u2212 in the 2D BZ, in which the calculated values are in the range of 0-0.88 meV/f.u. and 0-26.29 meV/f.u., respectively. Obviously, compared to that \u2212 direction, the DMI strength along with \u2212 direction is almost negligible. Thus, we focus on the DMI vector in the \u2212 direction below. The energy dispersion ( ) and the DMI energy \u2206 ( ) associated with spin spiral vector q for c = 28.4% and c = 31.6% are shown in Figs. 2(e)-2(h). The extracted DMI parameters D by taking the slope of dispersion in the\nvicinity of ground state are 23.4 and 26.3 meV/f.u., respectively. For convenience in\ncomparison, we also convert the total DMI per supercell to per magnetic atom as the effective\nDMI Deff (Fig. 1(g) and Fig. 2(i)). The Deff, 0.21 and 0.24 meV/atom in 2D MnSe2 induced by\ncurvature with c = 28.4% and c = 31.6%, which are comparable to those of Co/Ru(0001) [51]\nor Co/graphene interfaces [16,17], are highly possible to stabilize magnetic chiral spin textures\nin 2D magnets with long-range magnetic orderings.\nDiscussion.\u2014To further understand the variation of curvature-induced DMI above, the\nDMI effect of curved structure can be modelled as the sum of each M-X-M trimer, where M\nand X represent the magnetic and nonmagnetic atoms, respectively. Based on three-site Fert-\nL\u00e9vy model [52], the hoping of spins between two magnetic atoms (i and j) can induce DMI\nthrough a nonmagnetic atom (l) with SOC. The theoretically formulism of antisymmetric DMI\ncan be expressed as: \u20d7 \u20d7 , \u20d7 , \u20d7 = \u2212 !\u20d7 \"#\u00b7!\u20d7 \"% !\u20d7 \"#\u00d7!\u20d7 \"% '!\u20d7 \"#'('!\u20d7 \"%'('!\u20d7 #%' , (1) where \u20d7 , \u20d7 , and \u20d7 are the corresponding distance vectors between atoms in the threesite model. Vsoc is a SOC-governed material parameter, its expressions can be written as [135 ,-./(sin(3-4/10))/(32789 8/)], in which \u03bbd, kF, EF, Zd are the SOC constant, Fermi vector, Fermi energy and the number of d electrons, respectively. . is the interaction parameter between the localized spins and the spins of conduction electrons. In a curved magnet, the total\nDMI can be obtained by summing over all M-X-M trimers and we can further simplify the\nabove Eq. (1) as:\n\u20d7 = \u2212 \u2211 /\u2217 =>(/?#)@ A B(CB?#)\nD#( A EF , (2)\nwhere i is the index of summation, \u03b8i and ai represent bond angle of each M-X-M trimer and\nbond length between the nearest neighbor M atoms in whole curved structure, respectively. In\norder to describe curvature dependence of DMI in Fert-L\u00e9vy model, we assume that Vsoc is a\nconstant for a given system. Then we can provide a quantitative understanding for curvature-\ninduced DMI based on Eq. (2). Insets i in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) present the schematic structures\nwith inversion symmetry, which will lead to the offset of total DMI. However, the inversion\nsymmetry breaking arising from curvature, will induce an uncompensated DMI in the\nnoncentrosymmetric three-site interaction (insets j in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)). For 1D CrBr2, in\norder to build up the relationship between curvature and DMI, the calculated \u03b8i and ai of each\nCr-Br-Cr trimer are brought into the Eq. (2). The result shows that D/2Vsoc increases with\nincreasing size of curvature c, as is shown in Fig. 3(a). Similar to that of 1D CrBr2, we can\ndetermine the \u03b8i and ai of each Mn-Se-Mn trimer in curved 2D MnSe2 and one can see that\nD/2Vsoc increases as size of curvature c increases when \u03b8i and ai are brought into Eq. (2) as\nshown in Fig. 3(b). These results are in line with given results from first-principles calculations.\nMore interestingly, notice that the whole curve structure is composed of several similar M-X-\nM trimers in our studied system, and we find that \u03b8i and ai of each M-X-M trimer present a\nsmall tendency of change as a whole in curved structure with increasing size of curvature c. Therefore, we propose a simple model, in which average bond angle G\u0305 of Cr-Br-Cr (Mn-SeMn) triples and average bond length I of the nearest neighbor Cr (Mn) atoms in whole curve magnet are described as key parameters to further examine the relationship between curvature and DMI. We plot the dependences of G\u0305 and I with respect to size of curvature c as shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b). We can further simplify Eq. (2) as:\n\u20d7 = \u2212 /\u2217 => /? @ A B(CB? )\nD ( . (3)\nOverall, one can see that D/2Vsoc increases for both 1D CrBr2 and 2D MnSe2 with increasing size of curvature c when G\u0305 and I are brought into Eq. (3), as shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b). This is also consistent with given results from first-principles calculations. Thus, our findings\nbased on both first-principles calculations and Fert-L\u00e9vy model demonstrate that curvature is\nan effective way to realized DMI in 1D CrBr2 and 2D MnSe2.\nRealization of skyrmions in 2D MnSe2.\u2014To explore the formation of such chiral spin\ntextures in curved 2D MnSe2, we apply atomistic spin model simulations [53] for the\nmagnetization dynamics simulation based on magnetic parameters with size of curvature c of\n31.6% from first-principles calculations. To obtain final spin configurations, the atomistic\nFIG. 8. Calculated average bond angle G\u0305 and average bond length I as a function of size of curvature c for (a) 1D CrBr2 and (b) 2D MnSe2.\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is given:\nJK# JL = \u2212 M(FNOB) PK \u00d7 QRSS + ,K \u00d7 K \u00d7 QRSS U, (4)\nHere V is the gyromagnetic ratio, , is the Gilbert damping constant and K is the unit vector, which is defined as\nW# |W#| , where Y represents the magnetic moment of ith magnetic atom.\nQRSS is the effective magnetic field on each K and can be obtained by following equation: QRSS = \u2212 FW# JZ J[#, in which Q represents the total spin Hamiltonian. In simulations, we set a 60-\nnm width square with periodic boundary condition from an initial random state to obtain final\nspin textures. These parameters including effective exchange constant Jeff, effective DMI\nparameter Deff, magnetic anisotropy K, dipole-dipole interaction KDip and magnetic moment of\nMn atoms are 14.94 meV, 0.24 meV, 0.17 meV, -0.176 meV and 3.58 \u00b5B, respectively, and the\nmethods to calculate Jeff, K, Deff and KDip are described in the supplementary material. In addition, we apply the theoretical formula = 4 \\ ]F^]_B`aB B_ [54] to predict the radius of skyrmion, which is close to 20 nm. We can find that the size of chiral structure is much larger\nthan the ripple wavelength. Thus, we used the flat crystal structure to simulate our chiral\nmagnetic structures in the atomic magnetic simulations. In simulations, Figure 4 shows the spin\nFIG. 9. Plotted theoretical curve and calculated results by using Fert-L\u00e9vy model (Eq. (2)).

Interestingly, magnetic skyrmion spin texture with\ndiameter of around 20 nm emerges under zero magnetic field as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The calculated topological charge Q is -1 for skyrmion by using the formula c = Fda e K \u2219 (ghK \u00d7 giK)jkjl, where K represents the unit vector, x and y are the coordinates.\nConclusion.\u2014In summary, we obtain sizeable DMI in both 1D CrBr2 and 2D MnSe2 by\nusing ripple structures with different curvatures via using first-principles calculations. We\nunveil that quite large DMI can be induced in curved structure, in which breaking of spatial\ninversion plays an important role. In addition, with the help of three-site Fert-L\u00e9vy model, the\nDMI dependence on the magnitude of curvature is successfully interpreted. Via atomistic spin\nmodel simulations, we further uncover that magnetic skyrmions can be induced without\nexternal field in curved 2D MnSe2. Considering the experimental progress in 2D magnets, such\nas CrGeTe3, CrI3 and Fe3GeTe2, etc., our results open up new opportunities for development of\nspintronics.\nNote added.

The energy term can be described as:\n= m n , \u22c5 K \u00d7 K , (2)\nwhere n represents the DMI vector, K and K are the spins of nearest neighbor magnetic atoms. We adopt the qSO method based on generalized Bloch theorem and treat SOC within\nthe first-order perturbation theory [26,56,57], in which the total energy E(q) as the function of spin-spiral vector p is calculated along the high symmetry direction of \u2212 and \u2212 in our studied system. To extract the DMI parameter, a \u0393-centered 7 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 for 1D CrBr2 and\n2 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 1 k mesh for 2D MnSe2 are considered to compute the spin spiral energy E(q) in the interval of q from -0.1 / D to 0.1 / D by a self-consistent way. The nonlinear spin spiral structure q = (sin(p \u2219 rs) , 0, cos (p. rs)) rotates along the axis of spin spiral parallel the y axis, where p represents the spin spiral vector and rs is the location of ith atom (When the rotation axis is x axis, the nonlinear spin spiral structure q = (0, sin(p \u2219 rs) , cos (p. rs)) ). Then, DMI energy can be written as:\n(p) = \u2211 ni , sin(p \u2219 rsw), (3) where ni represents the DM vector perpendicular to the propagation direction of spin spirals, and rsw is the unit vector between sites i and j. Finally, the DMI parameter can be obtained by taking the slope of \u2206 (p) with respect to spin spiral vector p, where \u2206 (p) is the energy difference between E(p ) and E(-p ). Furthermore, final form of DMI energy can be simplified as:\n\u2206 (p) = (p) \u2212 (\u2212p)=2\u2211 ni , sin(p \u2219 rsw), (4) For small p = ( ,0,0) vector, we have the relationships: \u2206 (p) = 2 \u2211 ix , y ,h= , (5) where =2\u2211 ix , y ,h. (6) Here, the direction of DM vector depends on the propagation direction of spin spiral p of the whole Brillouin zone.\n2. Effective DMI value Deff\nIn our calculations, we convert the total DMI D per supercell to per magnetic atom as the\neffective Deff. For 1D CrBr2, D = 14\u03c0Deff; For 2D MnSe2, D = 36\u03c0Deff.\n3. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy K\nK is defined as the energy difference between in-plane (100) and out-of-plane (001)\nmagnetized axis:\nK = E100 - E001 (7).\n4. Effective exchange coupling constant Jeff\nAs is shown in Fig. 6(b), we set different magnetic configurations FM and AFM for MnSe2.\nWe consider the Heisenberg model on a hexagonal lattice,\nQ = m zRSS {\u20d7 \u22c5 {\u20d7 (8) Then effective exchange coupling constant can be solved by following formula:\n8 = \u2212 F/ \u2217 12 \u2217 6zRSS + |L}R~, (9) ]8 = \u2212 F/ \u2217 12 \u2217 \u22122zRSS + |L}R~, (10) zRSS = ` d , (11)\nwhere the positive or negative value corresponds to FM or AFM coupling.\n5. Dipole-dipole contribution to KDip\nThe dipole-dipole interaction contribution to K is the sum of all magnetostatic dipole-\ndipole interactions up to infinity [58,59] and is calculated by following formula:\n- = \u2212 F/ W da . . \u2211 q#\u2219q% ~#%B `9\u2217(q#\u2219r#%)(q%\u2219r#%) ~#% , EF , (12)\nwhere q and q represent the unit vector of magnetization at position r and r , r is the unit vector between site i and j. In calculations, we choose a 150 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 1 supercell to obtain the dipole-dipole interaction between two magnetic atoms in 2D MnSe2.\nReferences [1] I.
