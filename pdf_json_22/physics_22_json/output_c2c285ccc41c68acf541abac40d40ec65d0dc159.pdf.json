Berry curvature and Chern number are used to define the topological structure of electronic bands. While Berry curvature and its effects in materials have been studied [1, 2], detecting changes in the topological invariant, Chern number, is challenging. In this regard, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) [3\u20137] has emerged as a promising platform to gain electrical control over the Berry curvature hotspots [8] and the valley Chern numbers of its flat bands [9, 10]. In addition, strain induced breaking of the three-fold rotation (C3) symmetry in TDBG, leads to a non-zero first moment of Berry curvature called the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which can be sensed using nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect [11]. We reveal, using TDBG, that the BCD detects topological transitions in the bands and changes its sign. In TDBG, the perpendicular electric field tunes the valley Chern number and the BCD simultaneously allowing us a tunable system to probe the physics of topological transitions. Furthermore, we find hysteresis of longitudinal and NLH responses with electric field that can be attributed to switching of electric polarization in moir\u00e9 systems. Such a hysteretic response holds promise for nextgeneration Berry curvature-based memory devices. Probing topological transitions, as we show, can be emulated in other 3D topological systems. Exploring materials with new topological phases and probing their symmetries has been at the forefront of modern research. Topology is often characterized by Berry curvature that manifests as quantum Hall effect [1] or as anomalous Hall effect in magnetic materials [1, 2]. While these effects have led to many breakthroughs in physics, these linear responses vanish in systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry. However,\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n02 84\n8v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n6 A\npr 2\n02 2\neven in time-reversal symmetry protected systems, broken inversion symmetry can lead to the first moment of Berry curvature, namely Berry curvature dipole (BCD), when further spatial symmetries are reduced [11]. In presence of an ac current (of frequency \u03c9) in such system, the BCD can drive a second-order electrical response, namely the nonlinear Hall (NLH) voltage with zero (DC) and second-harmonic (2\u03c9) frequency. Aligned with the recent interest in various nonlinear phenomena such as nonlinear optics, there is a rapidly growing interest to look for quantum materials that host the NLH effect [12, 13].\nThe topological phase of quantum materials can be characterized by the band-specific topological invariant Chern number. Often systems undergo transition between topological phases and these transitions are hard to detect, unlike phase transitions of order parameter. Recent proposals suggest that topological transitions are accompanied by simultaneous changes in BCD [14, 15]. Moir\u00e9 systems are known to be natural candidates to host topological bands [16]. While the NLH effect has been observed for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) [17\u201321] and corrugated bilayer graphene [22], the experimental study in two-dimensional moir\u00e9 systems is limited [23]. Furthermore, topological transitions along with BCD have not been experimentally observed thus far.\nRecently, the observation of several novel phenomena in moir\u00e9 systems such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has attracted attention [24\u201329]. Flat bands in twistronic systems give rise to various electron correlation phenomena such as Mott insulators and superconductivity [24\u201327]. In particular, the observation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital ferromagnetism point to the rich topology of these twisted systems [28, 29]. Flat bands of moir\u00e9 systems are also susceptible to symmetry breaking by strain [30]. Together with the fact that spatial symmetry breaking can lead to nonzero BCD [30\u201332], bands in 2D moir\u00e9 systems offer an interesting platform to electrically tune topology and detect it via the NLH effect.\nIn this work, we use twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), in which two copies of bilayer\ngraphene are stacked together with a small twist angle\u223c1.1\u25e6, as a candidate system to study topological transitions using the NLH effect. While the flat bands in TDBG host correlation induced physics as in twisted bilayer graphene, TDBG is additionally equipped with electric field tunability [3\u20137, 33]. The perpendicular electric field, apart from modulating the band structure, can also change the valley Chern number of a flat band [10]. Additionally, almost touching flat bands with small tunable energy gaps of few meV in TDBG gives rise to large Berry curvature in this system [8, 16, 34]. We use electric field tunability to demonstrate that TDBG hosts substantially large BCD due to strain. The BCD changes sign abruptly and this can be attributed to a topological transition, a change in valley Chern number, with the electric field. Additionally, hysteresis in both longitudinal resistance and NLH signal as a function of the electric field suggests switching between metastable states.\nIn TDBG, broken inversion symmetry allows nonzero Berry curvature (\u2126). Additionally, imaging of small-angle twisted moir\u00e9 devices reveals strain that breaks three-fold rotational (C3) symmetry [23, 35, 36]. Such reduced symmetry makes the Berry curvature distribution nonsymmetric and anisotropic over the moir\u00e9 Brillouin zone (mBZ), leading to nonzero BCD (\u039b\u03b1) given by,\n\u039b\u03b1 = \u2211 n \u222b mBZ dk (2\u03c0)2 \u2126nz \u2202 nk ~\u2202k\u03b1 \u2202f( nk) \u2202 nk . (1)\nHere \u03b1 stands for the spatial index (x, y), nk is the energy of the nth band and f( nk) is the FermiDirac function. In Eq. (1), a sum over all the bands crossing the Fermi energy is implied. To calculate the BCD in TDBG, we consider distorted hexagonal moir\u00e9 Brillouin zone with the C3 symmetry broken by strain as shown in the schematic of Fig. 1a. The effect of C3 symmetry breaking is reflected in the Berry curvature plots of Fig. 1b, c. Figure 1d shows the band structure for TDBG with a twist angle of 1.10\u25e6 under 0.1% strain with \u2126z of the flat bands indicated by the color. Together, nonzero Berry\ncurvature and broken C3 symmetry generate a nonzero BCD, as shown in Fig. 1e (see Methods and Supplementary Information section I-III for calculations).\nWe fabricate multiple TDBG devices to measure NLH voltage, which probes the BCD [11, 18]. The dual-gate geometry allows independent control of the charge density (n) and the perpendicular electric displacement field (D) (see Methods). Figure 1f shows our measurement schematic to probe NLH effect. We send a current with low-frequency \u03c9 and measure the longitudinal voltage (V \u03c9xx) and the second-harmonic NLH voltage (V 2\u03c9xy ) at frequencies \u03c9 and 2\u03c9, respectively. In Fig. 1g, we show V \u03c9xx and V 2\u03c9xy as a function of moir\u00e9 filling factor (\u03bd) at zero displacement field for a TDBG device with twist angle 1.10\u25e6. Here \u03bd = 4n/ns with ns representing the number of carriers to fill one moir\u00e9 band and factor 4 due to four-fold degeneracy of spin and valley. Peaks in V \u03c9xx at \u03bd = \u00b14 correspond to the two moir\u00e9 gaps. The substructures in the peaks of V \u03c9xx (indicated by arrows) result from slightly different twist angles, indicating an angle inhomogeneity of \u223c 0.03\u25e6 \u2013 a signature of strain [36] that causes BCD in our system. In Fig. 1h, we plot V \u03c9xx and V 2\u03c9xy for a non-zero perpendicular displacement field that creates a gap at \u03bd = 0 (charge neutrality point, CNP). We find NLH voltage V 2\u03c9xy is high in the vicinity of band edge around the moir\u00e9 gaps at \u03bd = \u00b14 and the CNP gap in our strained TDBG devices.\nWe now study the evolution of V \u03c9xx and the corresponding resistance (Rxx) in the experimentally accessible parameter space of \u03bd and D in Fig. 2a. Schematics adjacent to Fig. 2a show change in the underlying band structure with D (see Supplementary Information section III for calculated band structure). A finite displacement field opens up a gap at CNP between the conduction and the valence flat bands. These flat bands are separated from the remote moir\u00e9 bands by two moir\u00e9 gaps, which close at larger values of D. Apart from the peaks in V \u03c9xx corresponding to the CNP gap at \u03bd = 0 and the moir\u00e9 gaps at \u03bd = \u00b14, we observe other features like the cross towards the hole side (\u22124 < \u03bd < 0) and the halo around D/ 0 = \u00b10.3 Vnm\u22121 towards\nthe electron side (0 < \u03bd < 4). These characteristic features of TDBG within partial fillings of the flat bands are likely to be connected to structures in the density of states [33].\nFigure 2b shows the evolution of the NLH voltage V 2\u03c9xy in the same parameter space of \u03bd and D. In Fig. 2c, we have plotted few line slices of V 2\u03c9xy around \u03bd = 0 for different D. We find that V 2\u03c9xy peaks near the gaps at \u03bd = 0 (CNP gap) and \u03bd = \u00b14 (moir\u00e9 gaps). The coincidence of the NLH voltage with the TDBG bandgaps reveals that the Berry curvature hotspots, and hence the BCD, reside predominantly in the vicinity of the band edges. We explore this behavior further in Fig. 3. V 2\u03c9xy that we measure should scale quadratically with the in-plane ac electric field of frequency \u03c9. To verify the quadratic scaling, we plot V 2\u03c9xy against the square of simultaneously measured V \u03c9xx for two different (\u03bd,D) biasing points in Fig. 2d. The linear behavior of V 2\u03c9xy with the square of V \u03c9xx confirms the quadratic scaling near both the CNP gap and the moir\u00e9 gaps. Additionally, V 2\u03c9xy switches sign when we reverse the Hall voltage probes and the direction of current simultaneously as depicted in Fig. 2e. These observations clearly demonstrate the second-order nature of the measured NLH voltage, V 2\u03c9xy .\nHaving established V 2\u03c9xy as NLH voltage, we now use D as a parameter to study scaling between normalized NLH voltage V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 and square of longitudinal conductivity (\u03c32xx). Such scaling can be used to quantify BCD, as discussed later. In Fig. 3a, we plot V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 (left axis) and \u03c32xx (right axis) as a function of D for \u03bd = 0.125 (indicated by the green vertical line in inset of Fig. 3a). The metallic behavior at \u03bd = 0.125 ensures that the Fermi energy is near the band edge (see Extended Data Fig. 3a for the temperature (T ) dependence of Rxx). Both V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 and \u03c32xx show different trends in two different regimes of the displacement field separated at D/ 0 = \u22120.23 Vnm\u22121. Interestingly, the two regimes are characterized by different band structures\u2013 in regime-I, the flat bands are gapped and are isolated from the remote moir\u00e9 bands, while in regime-II the valence flat band\nmerges with the remote moir\u00e9 band (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). It is known that changes in band structure due to D lead to change in the valley Chern numbers of the bands [9, 10] which in turn should be reflected in the change in sign of the BCD [15].\nTo investigate the close connection of such topological transition with BCD, we first experimentally analyze the scaling between V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 and \u03c32xx and later present a detailed calculation. In Fig. 3b, we find linear scaling between V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 and \u03c32xx in both regime-I and regimeII. The slope of a linear V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 vs. \u03c32xx dependence characterizes the contribution from skew-scattering (\u03c43) process [37], while the BCD can be extracted from the y-intercept [17, 37] (see Supplementary Information section VI). A fixed temperature assures that the contributions from skew-scattering or side-jump in the NLH effect are not tuned within the linear fitted regimes [38, 39]. Interestingly, near-zero slope in regime-I suggests that the skew-scattering contribution is minimal when the flat bands are isolated from the remote moir\u00e9 bands.\nTo distinguish the intrinsic BCD from other extrinsic contributions like side-jump, we repeat the scaling analysis for different fillings close to the band edge (see Extended Data Fig. 1). Figures 3c and 3d show the extracted BCD from regime-II and regime-I respectively. The drop in extracted BCD away from CNP (\u03bd = 0), consistent with Berry curvature hotspot peaking at the band edge, suggests that the NLH effect we observe is BCD dominated. The most striking observation, central to our study, is the sign change of BCD across the topological transition between regime-I and regime-II.\nTo theoretically verify the connection between BCD sign change and the topological transition, we calculate the band structure for two different values of inter-layer potential in Fig. 3e, f. A change in valley Chern number marks the topological transition. Consistently, the BCD changes sign as seen in Fig. 3h and 3g before and after the topological transition, respectively (also see Extended Data Fig. 4). We also note from Fig. 3e and 3f that the Berry curvature changes sign, around the \u0393-point, across the topological\ntransition. Thus, the NLH effect acts as a good probe to detect topological transitions associated with the change in the valley Chern numbers [14].\nWe note that the BCD values in Fig. 3c, d are higher than the BCD observed in WTe2 [17, 18]. The scaling analysis using temperature as a parameter also gives a similar magnitude of BCD (see Extended Data Fig. 2). High BCD magnitude has been theoretically predicted in strained twisted systems [15, 23, 30\u201332]. The origin of high BCD in graphene-based moir\u00e9 systems, in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point, can be understood using the model of strained twisted bilayer graphene as a tilted Dirac system [40]. In this model, BCD \u221d t \u221d \u03bb3, where t is the tilt parameter and \u03bb is the moir\u00e9 wavelength. So, the BCD is expected to be higher in moir\u00e9 materials as compared to non-moir\u00e9 materials like bilayer graphene, etc. (see Supplementary Information section V for details).\nFinally, we examine the variation of NLH voltage V 2\u03c9xy at large displacement fields and, interestingly, observe a hysteretic response as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows the simultaneously measured V \u03c9xx, which also reveals hysteresis with D. The sense of hysteresis is doping dependent (see Supplementary Information section X.4) and cannot be explained by charge traps in dielectric. See Supplementary Information section X for temperature effects, rate dependence, and switching statistics of the hysteresis. The inset of Fig. 4b shows the difference in V \u03c9xx for up and down sweeps. Intriguingly, the hysteresis is maximal around D/ 0 = \u22120.23 Vnm\u22121 where a topological transition takes place as shown in Fig. 3b. However, more studies are required for a full microscopic understanding.\nOur experimental data suggest the existence of metastable states; the origin of these states can be due to two possible mechanisms. Firstly, metastable polarization states in the system can arise from a difference in charge density across layers due to symmetry breaking in the device geometry (see Methods for further discussion). Secondly, flexoelectric coupling between perpendicular electric field and the strain gradient across the domain interfaces can lead to electric polarization in moir\u00e9 systems [41]. Polarization from\nboth possible mechanisms can lead to change in strain profile that can be further pinned by defects; this can account for the hysteresis we observe. Strain and polarization, through the effective electric field, modify the band structure and hence the value of V \u03c9xx and V 2\u03c9xy .\nTunable BCD values, together with the coupling of BCD to hysteresis in the same platform, as we demonstrate using TDBG, may open new frontiers for next-generation memory devices. In general, probing topological transitions using electrical transport is challenging. Our experiment demonstrates that the NLH effect can probe topological transitions. Electric field tunable band structure of few-layer heterostructures provides a useful way for probing topological transitions, as we show using TDBG. Our approach to detect topological transitions using NLH effect is applicable for 3D systems as well."

Using the fact that the length and width of our device are 2 \u00b5m each, \u03b7 = 2\u00d7 y-intercept of V 2\u03c9 xy\n(V \u03c9xx) 2 vs. \u03c32xx dependence. We fit the D-parametric plot of\nV 2\u03c9xy (V \u03c9xx)\n2 vs. \u03c32xx with a linear dependence (see Supplementary Information section VI for details) to extract \u03b7 and use the relation \u039b = \u03b7EF\u03c0e to estimate the BCD [17]. We assume that EF is \u223c1% (limited by the energy scale kBT set by the temperature T = 1.5 K) of the bandwidth (\u223c10 meV) of the flat band. To ensure that we place the Fermi energy EF within the flat band and not at the gap, we measure the temperature dependence of Rxx and find a metallic behavior irrespective of the chosen value of D (see Extended Data Fig. 3a).\nTo verify the robustness of our observation of BCD sign change, we systematically show the scaling of normalized nonlinear Hall voltage (V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2) with square of longitudinal conductivity (\u03c32xx) for three different fillings (\u03bd) in Extended Data Fig. 1. Extended Data Fig. 1a, d, and g shows the measured nonlinear Hall voltage V 2\u03c9xy and longitudinal voltage V \u03c9xx as a function of the displacement field for three different \u03bd. The background color denotes the two regimes\u2013 regime-I and regime-II, across which a topological transition occurs. We see broad peaks in V \u03c9xx across the critical electric field of D/ 0 = \u22120.23 Vnm\u22121 in all three cases. Using the measured V \u03c9xx and V 2\u03c9xy as in Extended Data Fig. 1a, d, and g, we plot the corresponding normalized NLH voltage\nV 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 and \u03c32xx = (I/V \u03c9xx)2 as a function of displacement field for the three fillings in Extended Data Fig. 1b, e, and h. In Extended Data Fig. 1c, f, and i, we plot V 2\u03c9xy /(V \u03c9xx)2 vs. \u03c32xx, using displacement field as a parameter. The displacement field (D/ 0 = \u22120.23 Vnm\u22121), at which the change in sign of intercept occurs, remains invariant for different fillings. We extract the intercept and use it to estimate BCD as described above, and plot in Fig. 3c and 3d of the main manuscript.\nThe extracted BCD values from the two regimes are opposite in sign. A characteristic signature of a topological transition is a change in sign of BCD, as discussed in the main manuscript and also in Ref. [15] and Ref. [14]. As we show via resistance vs. temperature measurements in Extended Data Fig. 3c, displacement field closes the hole-side moir\u00e9 gap around the same D/ 0 = \u22120.23 Vnm\u22121. Displacement field, that causes the flat bands to touch the remote moir\u00e9 valence bands, changes the valley Chern number of the bands in TDBG [9, 10], as we independently show in our calculations (Fig. 3e,f of the main manuscript) for the twist angle of 1.1\u25e6. Such a change in sign of valley Chern number accounts for the two linear regimes with different signs of intercepts."

Interestingly, the outer h-BN monolayer breaks the sublattice-symmetry opening up a small gap at the Fermi level (see Extended Data\nFig. 5a), accompanied by a weak layer asymmetry in the constitution of frontier electronic states (bands of pz orbitals) reflecting on an accumulation of a small electronic charge on one of the two graphene monolayers. This is expected from the lack of inversion or horizontal reflection symmetries in the trilayer, and our estimate of its polarization (along the z-axis) is -0.34 \u00b5C/cm2. We analyze effects of perpendicular electric field on the TDBG in two steps, focusing first on the coupling of field with the DBG (twist angle = 0) and then discuss the effect of twist in terms of variation in stacking between the DBGs. Using a rigid band model of frontier electronic states of DBG (for details of rigid band model refer to Supplementary Information section XI), we demonstrate that electric field permits switching to two metastable states with opposite polarization (Extended Data Fig. 5d) arising from the inversion of frontier electronic states in one of the DBGs (see Extended Data Fig. 5c). However, these states are symmetry equivalent and would not explain the hysteresis observed in\nresistances of TDBG, which we argue to arise from two mechanisms: (a) the inhomogeneous doping across the layers in the TDBG due to differences in the top and bottom doping as evident in our calculations of gated TDBG with a twist angle of 21.78o, and (b) switchable ferroelectric polarization associated with redistribution of regions with different stacking sequences (AA versus AB) across the twisted layers as shown in [4].\nOur calculations of the TDBG (with 21.78o) with a bottom gate reveals the development of polarization upon doping with an estimate of 0.6 \u00b5C/cm2 (refer to Supplementary Fig. 19a). This is comparable to P \u223c 0.68 \u00b5C/cm2 of bilayered h-BN [4] and larger than that (P \u223c -0.18 \u00b5C/cm2) arising from the restructuring in terms of stacking sequence [5] in heterostructures. Thus, the observed hysteresis has possible contributions from inhomogeneous stacking as well as inhomogeneous, layer-dependent carrier concentration."

The AB-AB TDBG can be fabricated by placing two AB-stacked bilayer graphene (see the side view in Supplementary Fig. S1a) on top of each other and rotate the bilayers with respect to each other. For the band structure calculation, we assume that the upper bilayer (l = 1) is rotated by an angle \u03b8/2 and the lower bilayer (l = 2) is rotated by an angle \u2212\u03b8/2 adding to total twist angle \u03b8. The smallest continuum Hamiltonian near the K valley can be written as [34]\nH =  h+t + \u2206 + t t + k 0 0 t+k \u2020 h+b + \u2206 + b T (r) 0 0 T (r)\u2020 h\u2212t + \u2206 \u2212 t t \u2212 k\n0 0 t\u2212k \u2020\nh\u2212b + \u2206 \u2212 b  . (S1) Here, +(\u2212) sign stands for the l = 1(2) bilayer and t(b) represents the top (bottom) layer of each bilayer. Due to rotation, the Dirac Hamiltonian modifies as h\u00b1 = R(\u2213\u03b8/2)~vFk \u00b7 \u03c3, where k is the crystal momentum near the valley and \u03c3 = (\u03c3x, \u03c3y) are the Pauli matrices representing the sublattice degree of freedom of single-layer graphene. The effect of dimer site potential on each layer of a bilayer has been captured in the Hamiltonian by a parameter \u03b4 as h(t/b) = ~vF\u03c3 \u00b7k+ \u03b4(1\u2213\u03c3z)/2. The inter-layer coupling matrix tk within each bilayer is represented as\ntk = ( \u2212~v4\u03c0\u2020 \u2212~v3\u03c0 \u03b31 \u2212~v4\u03c0\u2020 ) ,\nwhere \u03c0 = kx + iky. The strong inter-layer coupling between the two dimer sites is denoted by \u03b31 (shown by solid line in Supplementary Fig. S1a), the inter-layer hopping between two nondimer sites is denoted by v3 (shown by dashed line in Supplementary Fig. S1a) and the inter-layer hopping between dimer and non-dimer sites is denoted by v4 (shown by dotted line in Supplementary Fig. S1a). The various velocities can be calculated from the corresponding hopping amplitudes (\u03b3i) using the conversion rule vi = \u221a 3|\u03b3i|a/(2~) with a = 2.46 \u00c5. For our calculations, we consider the following parameters: the dimer site potential \u03b4 = 15 meV, the intra-layer hopping \u03b30 = \u22123.1 eV, which gives the Fermi velocity, vF = 106 m/s and \u03b31 = 361 meV. The remote hopping amplitudes \u03b33 and \u03b34 are considered to be 283 meV and 138 meV, respectively.\nThe moir\u00e9 coupling between the twisted bilayers (coupling between the two adjacent rotated layers) in Eq.

However, it can not account for the measured nonlinear Hall voltage due to the presence of C3 symmetry in the continuum model. So to break the C3 symmetry we include the effect of uniaxial strain quantified as [3]\nE = ( \u2212 cos2 \u03c6+ \u03bd sin2 \u03c6 \u2212(1 + \u03bd) sin\u03c6 cos\u03c6 \u2212(1 + \u03bd) sin\u03c6 cos\u03c6 \u2212 sin2 \u03c6+ \u03bd cos2 \u03c6 ) , (S3)\nwhich breaks the C3 symmetry [2, 3, 15, 30]. In Eq. (S3) is the strength of strain, \u03bd is the Poisson ratio (\u223c 0.16 for graphene) and \u03c6 is the strain angle with respect to zigzag direction of graphene. The strain matrix has two fold impact on the model Hamiltonian\u2014i) The Dirac points of bilayer gets shifted toD= (1\u2212ET )K\u2212A from K with A = \u03b2d ( xx\u2212 yy,\u22122 xy) (where \u03b2 = 1.57 and d = 1.42 \u00c5 ) being the strain induced effective gauge field. As a result the moir\u00e9 coupling vectors and the hopping matrices get modified. ii) The Dirac Hamiltonian itself modifies to ~vF R\u0302 \u03b8\n2 [(1 + ET )k \u00b7 \u03c3]. In our\ncalculation we extend the strain implementation of Ref.

(S4)\nIn Supplementary Fig. S1c we have shown the Berry curvature distribution for the conduction (left column) and valence (right column) bands over the moir\u00e9 BZ. Due to the broken C3 symmetry, the distribution of Berry curvature in the k-space becomes non-symmetric. Such non-symmetric Berry curvature in the moir\u00e9 Brillouin zone (mBZ) recently has been shown to cause nonlinear Hall effect which is quantified by Berry curvature dipole (BCD) defined as\nDcd = \u2211 n,\u03be,gs \u222b mBZ dk (2\u03c0)2 \u2126nd \u2202 nk ~\u2202kc \u2202f( nk) \u2202 nk . (S5)\nHere, n is the band index, \u03be is the valley index, gs is the spin index and f0 is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

The right most panel reveals the BCD when only the CNP gap is present.\nIII Variation of band structure and Berry curvature dipole with electric field in presence of strain\nOne of the experimental advantages of TDBG in comparison to the TBG counterpart is that one can tune the electronic band dispersion and hence related physical properties by an external electric field. This electric field tunability is captured in our Hamiltonian, Eq. S1, by the \u2206 term. In this section, we discuss how the band structure and Berry curvature dipole evolve with the variation in external electric field in presence of strain. This is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 (with 0.1% strain) and we find that the evolution of the band structure is qualitatively consistent with our experimental findings. In absence of an external electric field, i.e. \u2206 = 0 meV, the strained flat bands overlap and promote a metallic state. At the same time the flat bands are separated from the higher moir\u00e9 bands by a finite energy gap, namely moir\u00e9 gap.\nApplication of finite external electric field pushes the flat bands away from each other. However, a gap at charge neutrality point (CNP) appears only after certain threshold electric field and in our model calculations we find it to be \u223c 9.5 meV. At \u2206 = 11 meV, the CNP gap as well as both the moir\u00e9 gaps exist simultaneously. The corresponding band structure and BCD are shown in the left most column of Supplementary Fig. S3. Gradual increment of \u2206 enhances the CNP gap and decreases the magnitude of both the moir\u00e9 gaps. At \u2206 \u223c 13 meV the valence flat band merges with higher moir\u00e9 bands while the conduction moir\u00e9 gap remains finite. This scenario of band structure and corresponding BCD are indicated in the middle column of Supplementary Fig. S3. Further increment in \u2206 eventually closes the moir\u00e9 gap at conduction band side and only the CNP gap persists. The right most column of Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the band structure and BCD at \u2206 = 25 meV."

            "heading": "IV Sign reversal of Berry curvature dipole across the topological phase transition",
            "text": "The electronic wave-functions in TDBG are known to be rich in topological aspects. It has been predicted that tuning the strength of the electric field or twist angle can give rise to a topological phase-transition in this system. However, to the best of our knowledge, topological phase transition in TBG/TDBG has not been experimentally demonstrated. In our experiment we observe a topological phase-transition by tuning the electric field, which manifests as the sign reversal of BCD.\nThe non-trivial topology of the electronic wave-functions in TDBG is characterized by the valley Chern number (Cv) [9]. For an isolated band, the Chern number in each valley can be calculated by integrating the Berry curvature in the mBZ as\nCnv = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b mBZ dk\u2126n. (S6)\nDue to the presence of time reversal symmetry, the Chern numbers for K and K \u2032 valley are equal and opposite which makes the total (adding the two valleys) Chern number, for a particular band, zero. So to distinguish different topological phases we define a topological invariant (Z) as Z = |(CK -CK\u2032)/2|, where CK and CK\u2032 are the Chern numbers for K and K\u2019 valley, respectively. A topological phase transition is identified with a change in the associated Z index, \u2206Z. In presence of = 0.1 % strain we find a topological phase-transition near \u2206 \u223c 34 meV in our calculation. We emphasize that both the phases across the topological transition are robust in a large window of \u2206.\nThe band dispersion, Chern number and Berry curvature dipole in these two distinct topological phases are shown in Fig. 3e-h of the main manuscript. The bands plotted in Fig. 3f indicate the phase before the transition (\u2206 = 25 meV) for the K valley. The corresponding Chern numbers of the first conduction and first valence bands are 2 and -2, respectively resulting in Z= 2 for both the bands. For \u2206 = 38 meV, the band dispersion after the phase-transition, is plotted in Fig. 3e. The calculated Chern numbers for this phase are 0 and 1 for the first conduction and first valence bands, respectively. This results in Z= 0 for the first conduction band and Z= 1 for the first valence band. Therefore the phase transition in conduction band is conveyed through \u2206Z = 2 and in the valence band through \u2206Z = 1. Note that some recent literature reports the Chern numbers of the flat bands can be tunable upto \u00b13 with variation in twist angle and electric field for the unstrained moir\u00e9 systems [3\u20135]. Interestingly the phase-transition near \u2206 = 34 meV is also evident from the band structure evolution across the critical point. Focusing on the conduction band side, we find that as we gradually increase the electric field from \u2206 = 25 meV, the first conduction band gets closer to the higher conduction bands. However, it starts to move away from the higher band as we cross the critical point. Remarkably, we find that the BCD changes its sign across this phase transition which is also highlighted in Fig. 3g, h of the main manuscript. The similar BCD peaks for two different phases are shown with arrows of same color. We emphasize here the exact values of Chern numbers crucially depends on the chosen parameters. However, the topological transition which is associated with finite value of \u2206Z for each flat band can be seen for a broad range of parameters.\nTo emphasize the topological phase-transition more comprehensively we have plotted the x- and y-components of BCD as a function of perpendicular electric field (\u2206) and chemical potential (\u00b5) in Supplementary Fig. S4 in presence of 0.1% strain along zigzag direction (\u03c6 = 0). A clear sign of perpendicular electric field induced phase-transition can be realized from the butterfly like structure near \u2206 = 34 meV. Before the phase-transition (\u2206 < 34 meV) the x-component of BCD of the first conduction band has positive sign (shown by the blue lobe) and the second conduction band has negative sign (shown by the red lobe). However, after the phase-transition this trend gets reversed as the first conduction band possesses negative BCDx (shown by the red lobe) and the second conduction band possesses positive \u039bx (shown by the blue lobe). Apart from the fact that the sign of the y-components of the BCD is opposite to the corresponding x-component, \u039by also shows a similar behavior. This abrupt change in the sign of BCD near \u2206 \u223c 34 meV indicates a topological transition. We emphasize here that we have considered \u00b5 = 0 to reside in the maxima of the valence band and the shaded region near \u00b5 \u223c 50 meV is contribution of the further higher conduction bands to the BCD.\n(m eV\n)\n\u03bc (meV) (meV)(meV)(meV)\n\u039b \u039b (\u212b)\n\u03bc (meV)\nSupplementary Fig. S4.

For that we calculate Berry curvature dipole for a low energy tilted massive Dirac model and extend it to strained two band model of twisted bilayer graphene [40]. The nonlinear Hall conductivity for a tilted massive Dirac Hamiltonian of the form\nH = ~tkx\u03c30 + ~vkx\u03c3x + ~vky\u03c3y +m\u03c3z (S7)\ncan be written as \u03c3yxx = e 3\u03c4 ~ BCDx in the limit \u03c9\u03c4 1, which is valid for transport experiments. Up to linear order in the tilt value, the x-component of the BCD at chemical potential \u00b5 is given by\nBCDx = 3m~t 8\u03c0\u00b52\n( 1\u2212 m 2\n\u00b52\n) . (S8)\nFrom this expression we infer that within the constant scattering time approximation the BCD is proportional to the tilt and the BCD peak in \u00b5-axis is determined by the tilt and Berry curvature hotspot.\nThe low energy mode for strained twisted bilayer graphene given, in vicinity of the charge neutrality point, is given by [40]\nH = \u2212 ~ 1 + 6\u03b12 \u03c8\u20200\n[ v0xkx + v0yky + \u03be\u03c3xvxkx + \u03c3yvyky + \u03be\u03c3xvxyky + \u03c3yvyxkx +m\u03c3z ] \u03c80.

(S9) while v0x, vx, vy are determined by the off-diagonal components of strain matrix, the other components v0y, vxy, vyx are determined by the diagonal components of strain matrix [40]. For a rough estimation, we will consider shear strain (diagonal components of strain are zero) where the tilt velocity is given by\nv0x = \u2212\u03bevF \u03b12 1 + 6\u03b12 16\u03c0 ak\u03b8 xy.

(S12)\nThe non-linear Hall conductivity can originate from three different sources: i) the Berry curvature dipole, ii) side-jump scattering and iii) skew-scattering (also called anti-symmetric scattering). For a tilted massive Dirac model Hamiltonian it can be shown that [39] the Berry curvature dipole and the side-jump contributions to \u03c3yxx are inversely proportional to the impurity concentration making the ratio in Eq. (S12) to be scattering independent. However, the skew-scattering part has different impurity concentration dependence. Accounting for all the terms, we can write a general scaling relation, following Du et al.

(S17)\nFor finite temperature, using \u03c1xxT = \u03c1xx \u2212 \u03c1xx0, we can write the scaling law in terms of the conductivities as\nV Ny (V Lx ) 2 \u2212 C1\u03c3\u22121xx0\u03c3 2 xx = (C2 + C4 \u2212 C3)\u03c3\u22122xx0\u03c3 2 xx\n+ (C3 \u2212 2C4)\u03c3\u22121xx0\u03c3xx + C4.

Using Drude formula, \u03c3xx = ne2\u03c4/m, where n is the charge density and m is the effective mass, and \u03c3xx = ILV \u03c9xxW = I V \u03c9xx (for our case, length (L)=width (W )=2 \u00b5m) in eq. (S20), we obtain\n\u039b = 2~2Wn em \u00d7\n( V 2\u03c9xy\n(V \u03c9xx) 2\n) . (S21)\nIn Supplementary Fig. S10, we plot the BCD using eq.

            "text": "Twisted double bilayer graphene, TDBG, in our experiments is composed of two AB-stacked bilayers of graphene rotated by an angle [10] \u03b8 and encapsulated from top and bottom by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN-TDBG-h-BN) (Supplementary Fig. S17b). Thus, parallelly stacked one atomic plane of hexagonal boron nitride and two layers of graphene (Gr-Gr-h-BN) is a building block making a half of h-BN-TDBG-h-BN (upper trilayer) (Supplementary Fig. S17a). Interestingly, a single Gr-Gr-h-BN unit is noncentrosymmetric and lacks the horizontal mirror symmetry. Hence, it is expected to have a non-vanishing polarization (dipole moment perpendicular to the plane). We consider two different configurations of Gr-Gr-h-BN which have been obtained by changing stacking sequences of Gr-Gr-h-BN (i) stacking of h-BN same as bottom graphene and (ii) stacking sequence of h-BN not matching with either of the two graphene layers. However, the energies of the two configurations are comparable (0.1 meV) and we carry out our theoretical analysis with the first configuration as a model.\nWe first examine the electronic structure of Gr-Gr-h-BN and find a band gap of \u223c 26 meV at K point (h-BN breaks sublattice symmetry of AB-stacked bilayer graphene, Supplementary Fig. S18a). From the slope of macroscopic average electrostatic potential in vacuum, our estimate of polarization of Gr-Gr-h-BN is Pz \u2248 -0.34 \u00b5C/cm2 (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Thus, Gr-Gr-hBN has a nonzero polarization due to the broken inversion and horizontal reflection symmetries. This mechanism is similar to ferroelectricity in bilayer h-BN [4]. The lower trilayer of TDBG is h-BN-Gr-Gr (Supplementary Fig. S17c) and has exactly the same polarization with opposite sign.\nThe sense of hysteresis in longitudinal and nonlinear Hall voltage for doping just below charge neutrality point (CNP) is flipped on changing the doping to a point just above CNP. To understand the metastable states governing this hysteresis, we present a rigid band model for h-BN-Gr-Gr (lower trilayer) and Gr-Gr-h-BN (upper trilayer) of electronic states coupling with electric field and determine polarization as a function of electric field. Evolution of band energies with perpendicular electric field is modeled as\nH i = i + eE\u3008Zi\u3009 (S22)\nwhere i is the band index (i = 1 to 4 for the four bands close to Fermi at K point), i is energy of i th band, e is charge of an electron, E is electric field, \u3008Z\u3009 is the average position of each state (Supplementary Fig. S18b-e). \u3008Z\u3009 is minus (-) for h-BN-Gr-Gr (lower trilayer) and plus (+)\nSupplementary Fig. S17. a, Structure of Gr-Gr-h-BN. b, Unit cell of twisted double bilayer graphene encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN-TDBG-h-BN) with a rotation angle of 21.78o. c, Structure of h-BN-Gr-Gr. The building blocks of h-BN-TDBG-h-BN are Gr-Gr-h-BN and h-BN-Gr-Gr. The atomic species C, B and N are displayed in yellow, grey and blue colors, respectively.\nfor Gr-Gr-h-BN (upper trilayer), respectively. Band 2 of the lower trilayer and band 3 of upper trilayer cross at E = -0.0039 V/\u00c5 (band 3 of lower trilayer and band 2 of upper trilayer cross at E = 0.0039 V/\u00c5), resulting in redistribution of charges among these bands (Extended Data Fig. 5c). We show that there exist two metastable states for (i) E < -0.0039 V/\u00c5 and (ii) E > 0.0039 V/\u00c5, with distinct polarization states in h-BN-TDBG-h-BN, that can be accessed with electric field within our rigid band model (Extended Data Fig. 5d). However, the resistance associated with the two metastable states remains the same. While the metastable states in h-BN-TDBG-h-BN are explained using the rigid band model, the hysteresis in resistance seen in experiments can originate from the broken symmetry, which can possibly arise from the distinction in coupling of top and bottom gates inducing inhomogeneous doping in the channel or by a twist between two trilayers.\nTo understand the role of a gate electrode, we obtain the difference in planar-averaged electron charge density, \u03c1\u0304(z ) for n = 4 \u00d71012/cm2, E = 0.00625 V/\u00c5 and n = 4 \u00d71012/cm2, E = 0 V/\u00c5 with and without electric boundary conditions of a gate (Supplementary Fig. S19b and S19c) in h-BNTDBG-h-BN with a twist angle \u03b8 = 21.78o. Asymmetry in \u2206\u03c1\u0304(z) at the atomic planes (red dashed lines in Supplementary Fig. S19b and S19c) indicate accumulation and depletion of electronic charge and local polarization arising from polarizability of pz orbitals and a transfer of a tiny amount of charge. In the presence of gate, a positive electric field (along z\u0302) pushes the electrons to the bottom gate (the scale of y-axis in Supplementary Fig. S19c is higher than Supplementary Fig. S19b), highlighting the inhomogeneity in doping. We note that a spontaneous electric dipole pz can also arise from the restructuring of the regions with AA, AB, BA and BB stacking upon application of electric field [4] and contribute to the observed hysteresis.\nSupplementary Fig. S18. a, Electronic structure of Gr-Gr-h-BN shows a band gap of 26 meV at K point. b-e, Visualization of wavefunctions of four states near Fermi energy at K point of Band 1 (b), Band 2 (c), Band 3 (d) and Band 4 (e) of Gr-Gr-h-BN shows contribution from pz orbitals of carbon of graphene. The average position, \u3008Z\u3009 in terms of interlayer distance d = 3.2 \u00c5 for bands 2 and 3 is 3/2d, and 1/2d, respectively.\nSupplementary Fig. S19. a, Polarization in TDBG calculated as a function of doping in the presence of a bottom gate. b, c, The difference in planar-averaged electron charge density, \u03c1\u0304(z ) for n = 4 \u00d71012/cm2, E = 0.00625 V/\u00c5 and n = 4 \u00d71012/cm2, E = 0 V/\u00c5 without (b) and with (c) gate set-up in h-BN-TDBG-h-BN with a twist angle \u03b8 = 21.78o.
