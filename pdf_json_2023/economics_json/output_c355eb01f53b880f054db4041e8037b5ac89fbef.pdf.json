Driving mechanism of supply chain transparency on consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity\nShaohua He*\nSchool of Economics and Management, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China\nIntroduction: To maintain sustainable poverty alleviation in the post-pandemic world, China encourages firms to participate in the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers Project.\u201d This study aims to explore the phenomenon of indirect reciprocity between firms, consumers, and farmers in the supply chain. This study explores how supply chain transparency stimulates indirect reciprocity among consumers through competence trust, goodwill trust, and integrity trust. Furthermore, we explore the impact of compassion and the need for social status on the model.\nMethods: We fit a partial least square analysis structural equationmodeling (PLS-SEM) using data from an online random vignette-based experiment questionnaire survey.\nResults: Supply chain transparency of social responsibility practices asymmetrically a ects three dimensions of consumer trust by improving perceived information quality. And the three dimensions of trust asymmetrically contribute to indirect reciprocity. Furthermore, compassion has a positive moderating e ect on the relationship between perceived information quality and trust. However, the moderating e ect of the need for social status on the relationship between the three dimensions of trust and indirect reciprocity di ered significantly.\nDiscussion: Our findings indicate that supply chain transparency improves consumer trust, making consumers more responsive and rewarding companies that assist vulnerable groups in their supply chains. Faced with a trust crisis, companies can take di erent measures to achieve their goals based on each dimension of trust. At the same time, companies need to consider di erences in the responses of consumers with di erent personality traits (e.g., compassion and the need for social status) when revealing their corporate social responsibility practices to consumers.\nKEYWORDS\ntrust, indirect reciprocity, alleviation poverty program, supply chain transparency, personality heterogeneity\nIntroduction\nEnding poverty in all its forms everywhere is the first goal of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Raising farmers\u2019 incomes is central to anti-poverty efforts because 80% the poor in developing countries live in rural areas (World Social Report, 2021). In the Millennium Declaration, the United Nations encouraged remote poor areas to make full use of information technology to escape poverty. Goh (2022) shows that e-commerce, as an application field of information technology, can effectively play the role of helping farmers by combining consumers and enterprises.\nSince 2015, Combined with the social commerce era background, China has piloted the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmer\u201d project. Especially since the outbreak of COVID19, enterprises on major S-commerce platforms, encouraged by the state and expected by society, have launched \u201chelping farmers\u201d projects, including agricultural products from poor areas or areas seriously affected by the epidemic into the procurement end of raw materials, and registered to help raw material producers. Social commerce functions on e-commerce websites establish a bridge of communication between enterprises and\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nconsumers (Huang and Benyoucef, 2013). The rise of social commerce has provided a platform for companies to provide transparent supply chain information to consumers. This offers the possibility for consumers to engage with and respond to the actions of companies. It also offers the possibility of sustainable operation of the project.\nTo be more specific, The core of achieving project objectives is that the market can drive the implementation of the project spontaneously, which means that the \u201chelping farmer\u201d behavior of firms arouses the positive response or indirect reciprocity of consumers toward firms. The participation of enterprises in helping farmers is a kind of corporate social responsibility practice or prosocial behavior. It is also a prosocial motivation when consumers engage in indirect reciprocity. This intention to promote the wellbeing of others is considered other-oriented prosocial behavior (Carlo, 2006; Pfattheicher et al., 2022). There is evidence to suggest that consumers respond to efforts of companies to promote their corporate social responsibility activities (Han et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2021).\nThe indirect reciprocity of consumers has served as an \u201cenabling\u201d factor, allowing the initiative to continue. Indirect reciprocity is the main mechanism fostering assistance or generosity between three unfamiliar subjects (Romano et al., 2022). Indirect reciprocity is proper to explain consumer reactions to \u201cthe ethical corporate conduct of assisting vulnerable supply chain groups.\u201d Following Engelmann and Fischbacher (2009), indirect reciprocity is when a third party rewards and punishes one party for friendly or hostile behavior against another. Therefore, indirect reciprocity occurs when individuals help those who have assisted others. This study is based on the following social scenarios: On the social commerce platform, The firm declares its participation in the \u201csocial commerce agriculture project.\u201d After viewing the information, consumers will initiate the process of indirect reciprocity. Our research can complement research on consumer motivation from the perspective of indirect reciprocity.\nIndirect reciprocity can predict whether consumers are willing to pay costs to reward firms, which is a crucial issue in business management andmarketing research (Jaeger andWeber, 2020; Diallo et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2022). When indirect reciprocity is unlikely, firms will stop investing in pro-social behavior (Simpson and Willer, 2008). Enterprises wish to obtain more evident consumer attitudes toward CSR practices (Mohr et al., 2001; Green and Peloza, 2011; Sodhi and Tang, 2019). Sodhi and Tang (2019) points out that it is costly to collect and disclose information in the supply chain on websites, and firms need to be clear about consumer responses to provide supply chain transparency.\nParticularly in developing countries, there needs to be further research on public responses to specific CSR programs in supply chains (Idemudia, 2011; Ackers, 2015). Increasing numbers of firms choose to collect and disclose this information (Marshall et al., 2016), but the benefits of such transparency have yet to be determined (Sodhi and Tang, 2019). Companies are discouraged from implementing CSR programs due to a lack of understanding of consumer descriptions of specific activities (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2004; Sen et al., 2016). For these firms, indirect reciprocity was a significant predictor. Charness and Rabin (2002) and Danz et al. (2022) demonstrates that consumers\u2019 strategy of considering the interests of others can be captured by indirect reciprocity.\nTrust is essential for generating fairness, care, and otheroriented concern (Mishler, 2002), which can stimulate other-directed prosocial behavior (Deutsch, 1958). Trust acts as a mediator in consumer research to influence consumers\u2019 positive perceptions and attitudes (Fang et al., 2014; Taheri and Shourmasti, 2016; Kamboj et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2019; Iglesias et al., 2020). Thus, trust is seen as the antecedent variable of consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity.\nIn the e-commerce transaction environment, trust remains a challenge (Hajli, 2019). Consumers cannot easily believe the company\u2019s simple statement because of the suspicion that the company may manipulate \u201cethical products\u201d (Vanhamme and Grobben, 2009; Skarmeas and Leonidou, 2013). This skepticism may hinder the positive perception of the firm by consumers, as well as the behavior that motivates good business (Skarmeas and Leonidou, 2013).\nIn the face of doubt, one of the solutions is increasing the transparency of a sustainable corporate social responsibility supply chain (Marshall et al., 2016). For instance, Clarke et al. (2007) studies on ethical consumption campaigns in the United Kingdom reveal that these campaigns emphasize providing people with information to support certain causes and extend their care and responsibility to daily consumption practices. Existing studies have examined the relationship between supply chain transparency and consumer trust (Xiao et al., 2019), but there is still a need for additional research on the three dimensions of trust (goodwill, competence, and integrity). The three dimensions of consumer trust may play different roles in different social contexts (Wu et al., 2021). Further, we intend to investigate the relationship between the three dimensions of trust and indirect reciprocity.\nCapturing consumer heterogeneity in decision-making plays a vital role (Shim, 2021). Compassion and the need for social status are the main driving forces for individuals to make decisions that benefit others (Goetz et al., 2010; Griskevicius et al., 2010; Lim and DeSteno, 2016; Khan and Fazili, 2019). Previous research has shown that individual differences in compassion and the need for social status influence consumers\u2019 prosocial behaviors (Grier and Deshpand\u00e9, 2001; Condon and DeSteno, 2011; Puska et al., 2018; de Morais et al., 2021). During the indirect reciprocity decisionmaking process, consumers\u2019 compassion preferences may resonate with the information provided, and the preference for social status needs may drive consumers to take action. Therefore, considering the effect of compassion and the need for social status preferences on consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity processes will be more in line with realistic decision-making situations.\nIn the context of China\u2019s \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers,\u201d we derive and verify an indirect reciprocity process theory framework to explore the following questions: 1. the relationship between supply chain transparency considering social responsibility and consumer trust in businesses; 2. the impact of supply chain transparency on consumer indirect reciprocity; 3. the role played by consumer trust in the relationships described above; and 4. the impact of consumer heterogeneity (compassion, need for social status) on the model.\nThe contribution of this study is fivefold: 1. presents a theoretical framework for China\u2019s poverty alleviation project, \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers.\u201d; 2. complements research that considers supply chain transparency in socially responsible practices; 3. supplements the study of the three dimensions of trust as an intermediary mechanism; 4. constructs and validates a theoretical framework for indirect reciprocity in consumer decision-making research; 5.\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nexplores the boundaries of indirect reciprocity theory: compassion and the need for social status."

            "text": "In response to national policies and consumer expectations, social commerce platforms and merchants on the platform began to carry out the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d project according to their product characteristics. Specifically, some companies have started to show on their product web pages that they are supporting poor growers of raw materials in the supply chain. However, the information displayed on the webwas distinct. Some companies show exactly how and where in the supply chain they help farmers, while others simply attach a few words near the product name to claim that they participate in programs that help farmers. Using such a design, customers can learn about the social practices of enterprises. We have this intuition that it\u2019s critical to see the process by which companies help farmers, or that supply chain transparency is key.\nThe foundation of the project lies in the rise of social commerce. As social media and Web 2.0 have rapidly developed, e-commerce has evolved from a product-centered environment to one that is customer-centered (Huang and Benyoucef, 2013). In this context, customers can make better decisions online by using transparent information (Busalim et al., 2016). Customers\u2019 positive responses will enable companies participating in the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d program to do more to assist farmers.\nIn 1987, indirect reciprocity theory was first proposed by Alexander to explain the moral system of biology (Alexander, 2017). As the origin of human ethics, indirect reciprocity facilitates the spreading of kindness among strangers. It evoked from the fields of anthropology and psychology to economics, sociology, and management (Boyd and Richerson, 1989; Bateson et al., 2006; Baker and Bulkley, 2014; Bock et al., 2021).\nIndirect reciprocity can be distinguished into upstream indirect reciprocity and downstream indirect reciprocity based on the direction of transmission of kindness (Nowak and Roch, 2007). In upstream reciprocity, B first accepts the kindness of A and then transmits it to C (Bartlett and DeSteno, 2006). Downstream indirect reciprocity is that B releases generosity to C first, and after A observes this generosity, A inspires kindness or rewards to B (Nowak and Sigmund, 1998; Chalub et al., 2006; Szczes\u0301niak et al., 2020). Upstream indirect reciprocity facilitates the virtuous circle of generosity, whereas downstream indirect reciprocity does not (Nowak and Roch, 2007).\nDownstream indirect reciprocity is constantly proliferating and evolving, and he focuses on the third party\u2019s behavior (O) (Roberts, 2008). The observer (O) first observes B\u2019s behavior toward A and then chooses how to treat B (Boyd and Richerson, 1989; Nowak and Sigmund, 2005). It explains the phenomenon that people pay a monetary cost to benefit unrelated strangers (Nowak and Sigmund, 2005; Thielmann et al., 2021; van Dijk and De Dreu, 2021).\nDownstream indirect reciprocity decisions rely on the clues about the partner (Roberts et al., 2021). An indirect reciprocity process begins with the observation information provided by B (Wedekind and Milinski, 2000; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003; Rockenbach and Milinski, 2006; Sommerfeld et al., 2007). Proactive and effective communication with third parties can benefit B (Nowak and Sigmund, 1998, 2005; Brandt and Sigmund, 2006; Ohtsuki and Iwasa, 2006).\nBy displaying information about how their supply chain benefits farmers, enterprises are able to encourage consumers to make indirect reciprocal decisions. Through social commerce platforms, enterprises can make information transparent to consumers (Huang and Benyoucef, 2013). It is vital that information be conveyed effectively (Sommerfeld et al., 2007; Rand and Nowak, 2013; Suzuki and Kimura, 2013). That is to say, \u201cthe clues provided by companies to help farmers\u201d (supply chain transparency) must be perceived by consumers (perception of information quality).\nConsumers\u2019 perceptions of information will translate into \u201cjudgments of cues\u201d (trust) that stimulate indirect reciprocity intentions. Transparency of other people\u2019s interest-oriented leads in online systems can affect customer trust (Bock et al., 2021). Establishing a credible system will bring economic value to the enterprise (Resnick et al., 2006). Transparent and credible information can facilitate effective indirect reciprocity (Schmid et al., 2021).\nFor consumers, indirect reciprocity is a prosocial decision process in the context of social commerce helping farmers. Since compassion and the need for social status are intrinsic drivers of prosocial decision-making (Grier and Deshpand\u00e9, 2001; Condon and DeSteno, 2011; Puska et al., 2018; de Morais et al., 2021), compassion (Trivers, 1971) and the need for social status (Seinen and Schram, 2006) may moderate this process. Compassion is a progressive emotion that refers to feeling sorry for the pain of others and arousing a desire to help others (Goetz et al., 2010). It affects the tendency of individuals to behave prosocially (Saslow et al., 2013). It affects trust, but in what direction is debated (Liu andWang, 2010; Spikins, 2015; Lupoli et al., 2020; Nathoo et al., 2021).\nThe need for social status refers to a primary human motivation for societal recognition and prestige (Eastman et al., 1999; Dubois et al., 2012). The level of need for social status affects people\u2019s prosocial behavior decisions (Blader and Chen, 2011). But there is some controversy about the direction of the impact (Stamos et al., 2020). Some studies suggest that the direction is positive: those with a higher need for social status are more motivated to help others (Flynn et al., 2006; Hardy and Van Vugt, 2006) and, the need for social status is one of the drivers of consumer involvement in prosocial activities (Pinto et al., 2019). Falk and Zehnder (2007), Kornd\u00f6rfer et al. (2015), and Silva and Mace (2015) also indicates that people from districts with high social status show more reporting in the trust game than people with low social status. However, some studies have come to the opposite conclusion: that people with a higher need for social status may be less likely to exhibit pro-social or perhaps even antisocial tendencies (Li andWright, 2014; Guinote et al., 2015). Piff et al. (2010), Piff and Robinson (2017), and Amir et al. (2018) points out that individuals from lower social status are more sensitive to the welfare of others and more likely to show generosity in the trust game than those from higher ones.\nThe effect of the need for social status on pro-social tendencies may be relevant depending on the context or the particular type of pro-social behavior (Kafashan et al., 2014). We will explore these paradoxes through differences in the performance of people with different needs for social status in the relationship between trust (goodwill, competence, and integrity) and indirect reciprocity. According to the relevant research (Tajfel et al., 1986; Zahavi, 1995; Tajfel and Turner, 2004), it affects people\u2019s final intentions toward the products of prosocial attributes; therefore, it may act as a situationalmechanism to influence the relationship between trust and indirect reciprocity.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Indirect reciprocity process.\nBased on theory and realistic circumstances, we developed the following framework (see Figure 1). Merchants on social commerce platforms generously assist poor farmers in the supply chain (C) and then disclose the information to consumers (A). This process is captured by supply chain transparency. Consumers (C) then evaluate and judge the observed information. This process involves perceived information quality and trust. Ultimately, consumers will likely have positive intentions or rewards for merchants (B). This intention is portrayed through indirect reciprocity.\nWe assume that trust is a prerequisite for indirect reciprocity in S-commerce. Similarly, some researchers in the field of philanthropy view trust as a prerequisite for philanthropic giving. They contend that if donors are to be effective altruists, they need to believe in an organization\u2019s ability to provide tangible benefits to its beneficiaries (Gaskin, 1999; Bekkers, 2006; Hager and Hedberg, 2016; Becker, 2018). Xu and Zhang (2022) used a Chinese national survey and found that institutional trust significantly predicted people\u2019s donations and volunteer activities. Moreover, it has been suggested that trust is one of the most critical determinants of prosocial behavior (Penner et al., 2005; Bear and Rand, 2016; Rand, 2016).\nResearch model and hypotheses development\nThis section develops several research hypotheses. Based on indirect reciprocity theory, we operationalize: \u201cthe clues for businesses to help farmers\u201d as supply chain transparency; \u201cconsumers\u2019 observations of cues\u201d as perceived information quality; \u201cconsumers\u2019 judgment of cues\u201d as integrity, competence, and goodwill; \u201cconsumers\u2019 sense of indirect reciprocity\u201d as indirect reciprocity; and \u201cexternal factors associated with indirect reciprocal decisions\u201d as compassion and the need for social status.\nWe propose that supply chain transparency can transfer from perceived information quality to trusting beliefs, forming indirect reciprocal intentions. Compassion and the need for social status may moderate the indirect reciprocity process. Compassion may enhance the transfer of perceived information quality to trust beliefs (integrity, competence, and goodwill). The need for social status may intensify the transfer of trust beliefs (integrity, competence, and goodwill) to indirect reciprocity. Figure 2 presents the researchmodel and hypotheses.\nSupply chain transparency and perceived information quality\nThe network trading system between organizations enables enterprises to realize transparent transactions. In the previous supply chain management model, companies gained value by controlling manufacturing quality and inter-organizational costs. Transparency in supplier trading systems means providing multiple quantities and types of information to facilitate stakeholder determination of whether to trade (Finel and Lord, 1999). Its focus is on cost information in transactions, which is mainly transparent to supply-side partners or corporate shareholders (Williams, 2005). For example, Nicolaou and McKnight (2006) explores the role of information quality in the success of data exchange between organizations and points out that the trading system\u2019s transparency will affect the counterparties\u2019 perception of information quality.\nThe emergence of social commerce provides a channel for transparent communication between enterprises and consumers. With the transformation of scarce resources from products to consumers, enterprise information sharing aims to meet consumers\u2019 information needs. Current research focuses on disclosing the information consumers expect to receive in the supply chain (Zhou et al., 2018; Busser and Shulga, 2019).\nSupply chain transparency has been redefined as companies disclosing information in the supply chain that consumers, investors, and other stakeholders need (Sodhi and Tang, 2019). Consumers want to encourage companies to do good through their decisionmaking behavior (G\u00f3mez-Corona, 2020). For example, Consumers expect organizations to behave socially responsibly, and they care about whether companies engage in specific practices (e.g., promoting minority employees, whether they hire children, whether they care about local schools) (Harrison et al., 2005). Additionally, consumers want to know as much as possible about CSR practices (Podnar, 2008) as it is challenging to determine whether companies are operating per their social responsibility standards.\nThe level of supply chain transparency affects consumers\u2019 perception of information quality (PIQ) (Nicolaou and McKnight, 2006; Chan et al., 2021). To achieve transparency, companies disclose precise information about supply chain operations and products, for example, the manufacturing processes and sustainability conditions of their suppliers (Egels-Zand\u00e9n et al., 2015; Bai and Sarkis, 2020). PIQ is the consumer\u2019s perception of the accuracy, reliability,\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 The theory framework and hypothesis. H4a, H4b, and H4c is the mediating e ect hypothesis.\nand utility of information (Yang, 2021). Therefore, we propose the following:\nHypothesis 1. Supply chain transparency positively affects perceived information quality.\nPerceived information quality and trust beliefs\nIn social commerce, the interaction between firms and consumers creates consumer value by integrating resources (Hajli et al., 2017). Firms achieve this interaction by making CSR practice information transparent to consumers. This value realization aims to reduce consumers\u2019 uncertainty or information asymmetry between merchants and consumers so that consumers can make favorable decisions (Kanani and Glavee-Geo, 2021). For example, In a study of users\u2019 willingness to exchange data, information quality translates into trust, then affects consumers\u2019 intention (Nicolaou et al., 2013).\nSince trust is a psychological perception factor, it can be categorized into different dimensions according to the characteristics of trust objects. For example, Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut (2020) divides trust into cognitive trust and affects trust when studying customers\u2019 perceived value of live streaming. Nicolaou et al. (2013) divides trust into competence trust and goodwill trust when studying the behavior of subjects in electronic data trading systems.\nIn our study, trust includes three dimensions: competence, integrity, and goodwill. Competence trust refers to the knowledge and skills required by the trustee to perform a particular task (Colquitt et al., 2007). Integrity refers to the trustee\u2019s attributes, such as impartiality, fairness, consistency, and performance of commitments (Colquitt et al., 2007). Goodwill trust refers to the belief that the trustee will take mutual benefit practice as promised (Sako, 2006). Specifically, in the research on social responsibility, goodwill trust pertains to the degree of perceived altruism of corporate CSR initiatives (Joo et al., 2019). We expect that when perceived information quality gets higher, competence, integrity, and goodwill trust get higher.\nApproval of a firm\u2019s ability to provide information increases consumer approval of the firm\u2019s goodwill (Nicolaou et al., 2013). The\neffort of firms to satisfy consumers\u2019 demand for information quality shows their sincerity toward consumers. This positive perception will inertially arouse the perception of corporate goodwill (Nooteboom, 2001). Therefore, the high level of information quality perception increases the goodwill perception of firms.\nHypothesis 2a. Perceived information quality will positively influence goodwill.\nThe more consumers feel that the information provided by firms is accurate and reliable, the more they believe in the professionalism and capabilities of enterprises. Consumer recognition of a firm\u2019s ability to provide information will increase trust in the firm\u2019s practical ability (McKnight et al., 2002). Therefore, we hypothesize that consumers will trust a firm\u2019s capabilities more when they perceive a high level of information quality.\nHypothesis 2b. Perceived information quality will positively influence competence.\nWhen consumers perceive the enterprise\u2019s ability to provide information, they will believe its commitment to reaching a deal (Brownlie and Howson, 2005). Consumers can trust firms to provide high-quality products and services for a successful transaction. A high level of information quality is likely to translate into trust in the firm\u2019s products and services.\nHypothesis 2c. Perceived information quality will positively influence integrity.\nTrust beliefs and indirect reciprocity\nTrust is often used to analyze human behavior, especially one party\u2019s perception of the other (Markov\u00e1 and Markov\u00e1, 2004). According to the indirect reciprocity theory, trust belief is the antecedent factor of indirect reciprocity. Trust in the firm reduces the perception of uncertainty and maximizes the transmission of information to consumers, affecting their decisions (Colquitt et al., 2007).\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nWe will analyze the relationship between the two based on the three dimensions of trust. Trust(competence, integrity, goodwill) can promote the relationship between the two parties (Dowell et al., 2015). Goodwill trust emphasizes trust in the altruistic tendencies of the trustee (Park and Tussyadiah, 2020). Trust in goodwill is based on the perception of the other party\u2019s sincere concern and intention to actively undertake social responsibilities (Lui and Ngo, 2004). It reduces the questioning of corporate care or reciprocal decisions (Das and Teng, 2001). Especially in the context that firms generally communicate with consumers by revealing information through commodity web pages, consumers\u2019 goodwill trust in the enterprise directly affects the purpose of communication. We propose the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 3a. Goodwill trust will positively influence indirect reciprocity.\nCompetence trust is one of the keys to unlocking trust intention, which often activates subsequent effective or positive perception (Ibrahim and Ribbers, 2009). Twyman et al. (2008) point that competence trust can promote cooperative intentions in risk communication. Therefore, we expect that trust in firm-specific skills (e.g., the ability to implement [helping farmers program]) will increase consumers\u2019 positive emotions and attitudes toward the firm (e.g., indirect reciprocity).\nHypothesis 3b. Competence trust will positively influence indirect reciprocity.\nIn different types of transactions, integrity trust will have different effects from competence trust (Connelly et al., 2018). An increase in integrity trust implies a decrease in perceived opportunistic threats, whereas trust in competence does not (Lui and Ngo, 2004). Compared with the crisis of trust in competence, the crisis of integrity trust may lead to more severe consequences (Kim et al., 2004). Integrity is a virtue with utilitarian tendency (McKnight et al., 2002). Consumers\u2019 integrity perception of the firm will make them believe that it will provide high-quality services and products as promised and will not hide information or evade obligations (Saleh et al., 2013). Critcher and Gilovich (2010) point out that people gradually form attitudes based on perceptions. Consumers, perceiving the firm\u2019s integrity, can stimulate their choice of indirect reciprocity.\nHypothesis 3c. Integrity trust will positively influence indirect reciprocity.\nPerceived information quality and indirect reciprocity\nThe credibility of the information provided by the firm may influence the purpose of transparent information. Samu and Tak\u00e1cs (2021) points out that credible information positively affects other people\u2019s decisions. Perceived information quality positively affects consumers\u2019 decision (Mannan et al., 2019). Trust is the mental mechanism through which influence arises (Cyr et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016). Thus, we expect trusting beliefs to mediate the effects of PIQ on indirect reciprocity.\nHypothesis 4a. Goodwill trust will mediate the effects of perceived information quality on indirect reciprocity. Hypothesis 4b. Competence trust will mediate the effects of perceived information quality on indirect reciprocity. Hypothesis 4c. Integrity trust will mediate the effects of perceived information quality on indirect reciprocity.\nExternal factors associated with a trusted context\nAlthough previous studies have shown the importance of compassion and the need for social status in understanding consumer prosocial behavior, there needs to be more exploration into otheroriented prosocial behavior driven by indirect reciprocity. Thus, their role in consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity is still worth exploring."

            "heading": "The role of di erent compassion",
            "text": "Compassion has been a hot topic in psychology research for the past 30 years (Gilbert, 2017; Szczes\u0301niak et al., 2020). Human compassion is a cognitive process involving reflection on the past and predicting future behavior (Gilbert, 2019). Alternatively, it is the transformation of an emotional state into actual behavior. This emotion is triggered when people see others suffering through hardship and then choose to help those people (Goetz et al., 2010).\nCompassion has individual differences. Compassionate people are more likely to feel the plight of others and be willing to help (Mayer et al., 1995). They pay more attention to the needs of others to establish a mutually supportive environment (Crocker and Canevello, 2008). They are also more willing to participate in and support projects that benefit social development (Horowitz et al., 2001; Crocker et al., 2009). Compassion affects how consumers view the responsible and irresponsible behaviors of enterprises (Xie et al., 2015).\nMayer et al. (1995) and Saslow et al. (2013) pointed out that compassion drives prosocial behaviors such as generosity. They view others with kindness, so they are more likely to trust others (Piferi and Lawler, 2006; Crocker and Canevello, 2008; Lemay Jr and Clark, 2008). An increase in compassion may predict an increase in trust (Colquitt et al., 2007; Crocker and Canevello, 2008). Liu and Wang (2010) and Nathoo et al. (2021) found that compassion promotes trust. Therefore, we propose the following possible hypotheses:\nHypothesis 5a. The effect of perceived information quality on goodwill trust is stronger for consumers with higher compassion. Hypothesis 5b. The effect of perceived information quality on competence trust is stronger for consumers with higher compassion. Hypothesis 5c. The effect of perceived information quality on integrity trust is stronger for consumers with higher compassion.\nThe role of di erent need for social status Berger et al. (1980) and Anderson et al. (2015) argue that the need for social status is a basic human desire. The need for social status illuminates an individual\u2019s desire to increase their influence in a social\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\ngroup in order to gain the respect and admiration of others (Dubois et al., 2012). The need for social status emphasizes the psychological satisfaction that comes from the admiration and respect of others (Galinsky et al., 2008; Blader and Chen, 2011; Dubois et al., 2012; Kastanakis and Balabanis, 2012).\nThis psychological factor will influence the consumer\u2019s decision (Dreze and Nunes, 2009; Ordabayeva and Chandon, 2011; Correia et al., 2018, 2019). Zhang et al. (2018) indicated that facing CSR information, the high-level need for social status customers exhibits a more positive attitude than the low-level need for social status customers. Some consumers gain the respect of others by consuming products with prosocial attributes and sending prosocial signals to others (e.g., buying products with altruistic attributes Johnson et al., 2018).\nOf course, they need to be convinced that the attributes of this product match their identity first (Ashforth andMael, 1989). We seek consistency between our self-image and the image of the product we own. Just as consumers will use luxury goods to demonstrate their social status, we believe that consumers may also engage in socalled \u201cconspicuous prosocial consumption\u201d to show their alignment with certain prosocial beliefs (Johnson et al., 2018). Therefore, we hypothesize that consumers with high demand for moral sense (the need for social status) will be more willing to support the firm if they believe it is doing something prosocial.\nHypothesis 6a.The goodwill trust impact on indirect reciprocity is stronger for consumers with a higher need for social status. Hypothesis 6b. The competence trust impact on indirect reciprocity is stronger for the consumer with a higher need for social status. Hypothesis 6c. The integrity trust impact on indirect reciprocity is stronger for the consumer with a higher need for social status."

This controls the homogeneity of other external factors in addition to the scene, which makes the results more credible. Random settings are such that there are no observable or unobservable differences other than the manipulated factor. Since treatment was the only aspect that differed between the groups, causal inferences were possible (Gerber and Green, 2012).\nIn the vignette experiment, participants were first told to imagine buying a box of walnut dates online. They would then be presented with a social commerce website for dates and walnut products. Each participant was provided with the same contextual information from the webpage banner: i.e., product images and names1.

We manipulate three levels of supply chain transparency to test the effects of supply chain transparency (see Table 1), which is captured by a categorical variable (0 = low supply chain transparency, 1 = medium supply chain transparency, 2 = high supply chain transparency). Transparency design is based on the practice in social commerce sites and the social responsibility report on the enterprise webpage. Then, we used items of indirect reciprocity to measure the effects of supply chain transparency on the consumer.\nAfter reading the transparency manipulation script, the participants checked whether the transparency manipulation was successful through the response scale.

A seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) was constructed to measure the respondent agreement level on all the items. All scale items and the operationalization of the related constructs are summarized in Table 2.\nIn the post-experiment survey, we set some questions to check whether the subjects read and filled out the questionnaires carefully. Depending on the choice of subjects, we will identify and eliminate some invalid questionnaires. Questions mostly ask for illustrated information or simple statements, for which there is a fixed answer.\nAlthough our research is not cross-national, we still refer to the methods of Collaborative and Iterative Translation (Douglas and Craig, 2007) and Back translation (Behr, 2017) regarding the translation of the questionnaire. First, two bilingual speakers whose native language is Chinese translated the English scale into Chinese. Then, it was sent to two experts in that field for review. Afterward, 30 consumers were randomly recruited online and asked about their opinions on each questionnaire item. Comprehension, to see if there is any deviation in semantic understanding; finally, it was translated into English by two bilingual staff whose native language is English. The final English-language questionnaire was then compared with the original version to make the scale easier for respondents to understand without deviating from the original meaning of the items. Certain steps in this process are iterated to ensure translation equivalence (Teo and Liu, 2007)."

Discriminant validity was thus verified.\nThe cross loading criterion meets subjective independence.Cross Loading Criterion-subjective independence can help reduce the presence of multicollinearity amongst the latent variables.

In addition, we adopt the proximal separation (Garg, 2019). Finally, We add a marker variable to the survey to use the marker technique in ex-post (Lindell and Whitney, 2001). In ex-post, we conduct Harman\u2019s single-factor test for common method bias (Ylitalo, 2009).\nIn our results, more than one factor emerged, and the highest level of covariance explained by one factor was <50% (Fuller et al., 2016). This means that no single latent variable could account for all indicators. Nevertheless, Some researchers (e.g., Podsakoff and Organ, 1986; Lindell and Whitney, 2001; Podsakoff, 2003; Podsakoff et al., 2012) pointed out that Harman\u2019s test to assess commonmethod bias was insufficiently sensitive. Thus, to solve the potential CMV issue in our studies, we followed the CFA marker variable approach and the unmeasured standard method variable approach (Podsakoff, 2003; Williams et al., 2010) to test the influence of CMV, which are widely used in the literature (e.g., Wu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2022).

That is, as perceived information quality rises, consumers with a high level of compassion are more likely to display a high level of goodwill, competence, and integrity trust than those with a lower level of compassion.\nAccording to Figure 5 (NS*TG->IR), the slopes of the three lines are as follows: the green line (NS at +1 SD) > the blue line (NS at Mean) > and the red line (NS at \u20131 SD), demonstrating that at high, compared to low, levels of goodwill trust, consumers high in the need for social status, compared to those low in the need for social status, are more likely to exhibit indirect reciprocity. In Figure 5 (NS*TC>IR), the slopes of the three lines are as follows: the green line (NS at +1 SD) < the blue line (NS at Mean) < and the red line (NS at \u20131 SD), demonstrating that consumers with a low need for social status are more likely to exhibit indirect reciprocity in the case of high competence trust than in the case of low competence trust, compared to consumers with a high need for social status.\nThen, in Figure 5 (NS*TI->IR), we find an interesting phenomenon: the slopes of the three lines are as follows: the green line (NS at +1 SD) <0, and the blue line (NS at Mean) < the red line (NS at \u20131 SD). The effect of integrity on indirect reciprocity is reversed for consumers with a low need for social status and for consumers with a high need for social status relative to the general group.

            "text": "In the context of digital agriculture and social commerce, we expect to examine the theoretical mechanism of \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d in China\u2019s poverty alleviation project from a market perspective. We found that Chinese consumers have positive attitudes toward companies participating in \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d projects and are willing to reward companies for participating in such socially responsible behavior.\nThe higher the transparency of the supply chain provided by the enterprise, the higher the quality of information consumers perceive, and the more willing they are to trust the enterprise. The empirical results show that supply chain transparency significantly affects perceived information quality, and perceived information quality significantly impacts consumer trust in three dimensions. The supply chain transparency of corporate social responsibility programs will have a stronger impact on consumers\u2019 trust in the company\u2019s goodwill and ability to implement programs. We find that perceived information quality is different extent effect to three dimensions of trust beliefs [goodwill (\u03b2 = 0.765; p < 0.001)>competence (\u03b2 = 0.729; p < 0.001) >integrity (\u03b2 = 0.671; p < 0.001)].\nThe difference also exists between consumer trust and perceptions of indirect reciprocity. Consumers\u2019 trust in the goodwill of companies and in their ability to implement \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d can translate into indirect reciprocity for companies. However, trust in the quality of services and products enterprises provide cannot be translated into indirect reciprocity. Goodwill (\u03b2 = 0.425; p < 0.001), competence (\u03b2 = 0.152; p < 0.05) and integrity (\u03b2 = 0.081; p > 0.05) differently affect indirect reciprocity.\nConsumer heterogeneity also asymmetrically affects the role of the three dimensions of trust. For consumers with high compassion, when they feel that the information provided by the company is of high quality, they will convert the recognition of the information into more trust in the service and quality of the company (integrity trust).\nWe found an interesting phenomenon regarding the moderating effect of the need for social status. Consumers with different levels of need for social status exhibit different levels of indirect reciprocity in the face of different dimensions of trust. When faced with higher levels of goodwill trust, consumers with a higher need for social status demonstrate higher levels of indirect reciprocity than consumers with a lower need for social status. When faced with higher levels of competence trust, consumers with a lower need for social status demonstrate higher levels of indirect reciprocity than consumers with a higher need for social status. Higher integrity trust exhibits greater indirect reciprocity for consumers with a lower-than-average level of need for social status. However, for consumers with aboveaverage social status needs, higher integrity trust exhibits lower indirect reciprocity.\nIn view of this, we propose that the contradictions found in previous studies regarding the effects of the need for social status on trust and pro-social behavior can be attributed to the different dimensions of the variables involved. At the same time, we presume that consumers with high social status needs will be more sensitive and have more pro-social tendencies under a pure altruistic dimension. However, when this altruistic tendency is weaker, consumers with a high need for social status will have a higher decrease in pro-social tendencies than consumers with a low need for social status. Thus, in the case of higher competence trust, consumers with a low need for social status will exhibit higher indirect reciprocity than those with a high need for social status. Also, in integrity trust, the same is true to the extent that consumers with a high need for social status exhibit resistance to indirect reciprocity."

            "text": "Our research provides a theoretical mechanism for analyzing the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmer\u201d project from a market perspective. According to the process of indirect reciprocity, we construct a research model of China\u2019s \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmer\u201d project and propose a new framework for analyzing consumers\u2019 prosocial behavior. This, in turn, enriches research on supply chain transparency, perceived information quality, consumer trust, indirect reciprocity, and consumer heterogeneity (compassion and need for social status).\nOur research complements the transparency of socially responsible supply chains in the context of China\u2019s \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmer.\u201d Different from the previous transparency focus on uniqueness of product quality (Sammer and W\u00fcstenhagen, 2006; Saberi et al., 2019), cost (Bai and Sarkis, 2020), nature of labor conditions in supplier factories (Leitch, 2017) and sustainable production (Garcia-Torres et al., 2019). Results support supply chain transparency as a pre-variable for perceived information quality.\nThe successful identification of perceived information quality antecedents enriched the existing theories on perceived information quality. Previous studies verified the significant impact of information disclosure and type on consumers\u2019 information perception (Gefen and Straub, 2000; Zhou et al., 2018). This study further analyzes how the CSR practice transparency affects consumers\u2019 perceived information quality.\nOur study not only enriched the existing empirical research on perceived information quality but also further proved the value of perceived information quality in pre-conversion into consumer trust (goodwill trust, competence trust, integrity trust) (Nicolaou and McKnight, 2006; Sarkar et al., 2020; Talwar et al., 2020). Although perceived information quality is considered a reliable perspective for predicting consumer trust, few studies have separately explored the correlation of perceived information quality with trust\u2019s three dimensions (goodwill, competence, and integrity). This is consistent with previous studies about different types of trust in networks (Silic and Ruf, 2018; Talwar et al., 2020).\nIt not only supplements the practical application of indirect reciprocity theory but also takes indirect reciprocity variables as research objects for the first time. According to the indirect reciprocity formation process, supply chain transparency serves\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nas a clue and stimulus source; information quality and trust are psychological perceptions; and consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity intention is the result of consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity. The indirect reciprocity theory has been studied for decades, but it remains almost exclusively a theoretical topic (Nowak and Sigmund, 2005). Our study fills a gap in empirical research on indirect reciprocity in the context of consumer motivation.\nBased on the research framework of indirect reciprocity theory, we explore the boundary conditions of the model. This will complement the study of the influence of consumer compassion and the need for social status on consumer decision processes. It explicitly complements research on how compassion moderates the relationship between perceived information quality and trust and how the need for social status moderates the relationship between trust and indirect reciprocity.\nWe hypothesize that the interaction between compassion and perceived information quality asymmetrically affects the three dimensions of consumer trust. That is, compassion divides consumers into different groups, and perceived information quality is the factor thatmotivates trust.We explain the interaction between the need for social status and trust by treating the need for social status as a trigger for differences in trust across dimensions and trust as a stimulus for indirect reciprocity.\nAccording to context, provide a theoretical basis for China\u2019s \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d project and participating enterprises. If we want to achieve the goal of alleviating poverty and not returning to poverty, we need to give full play to the incentive role of the market. Consumers\u2019 positive response to companies with high transparency in the \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d project will promote the enthusiasm of enterprises to help farmers and the transparent \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers\u201d project. The positive interaction between the two makes the social responsibility practice of helping farmers form a virtuous cycle and sustainable development. This study has positive practical implications in the current context of concerns about farmers returning to poverty, the persistence of farmers seeking help, and a general lack of consumer trust."

            "text": "We suggest that managers attempting to use social media communication to foster consumer trust must pay attention to supply chain transparency and consumer-perceived information quality. To cultivate consumer trust, managers should actively participate in corporate social responsibility activities, improve supply chain transparency, and give consumers a positive perception of information quality. Operators should also encourage transparency in socially responsible practices, create an atmosphere of trust between consumers and businesses, and inspire consumers to pay attention to and think deeply about businesses.\nIn addition, managers should recognize that in social commerce, the communication of different types of supply chain information by merchants can affect consumers\u2019 trust in goodwill, competence, and integrity differently. Focusing on communicating more social responsibility messages to companies with a reputation for excellent service and quality will increase consumer trust.\nConsumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity decisions are more sensitive to goodwill trust. This means that if managers want to reduce consumers\u2019 sensitivity to commodity prices (increase indirect reciprocity), they must pay attention to the disclosure of information on altruistic behaviors such as corporate social responsibility practices. Be adept at using web technology to provide authoritative methods of information verification and communicate with consumers at all times about what they expect from the supply chain.\nThird, by displaying ethical behavior in the supply chain on social commerce platforms, companies can not only activate customers\u2019 pro-social consciousness, increase positive consumer response to companies, and guide consumers to purchase prosocial goods but also attract consumers with pro-social values. In addition, companies can remind consumers in their messages that purchasing pro-social goods brings external social rewards and internal emotional satisfaction (e.g., the need for social status and compassion).\nFinally, our study may provide practical guidance for sustainable entrepreneurship. The social responsibility initiative of helping farmers belongs to environmental, social, economic, and fair issues in corporate sustainability (Amini and Bienstock, 2014). Our articles may contribute to research related to sustainable entrepreneurship. The core of its business model is sustainability orientation (Schaltegger et al., 2016), which can capture economic value while solving economic, ecological, and societal problems (Schaltegger and Wagner, 2011). Our research highlights the role of corporations (Patzelt and Shepherd, 2011) in addressing the noneconomic benefits of social development. At the same time, in the context of specific industry projects, we empirically analyze the relation mentioned by Centobelli et al. (2022) between technological capabilities (based on web 4. 0 supply chain transparency) and supply chain practices.\nLimitations and future research directions\nThe sample group we recruited comprises young and middleaged people with higher education levels, which is a relatively limited sample. Although the respondents were users with some experience using social commerce, future researchmay invite subjects from a more diverse population to increase the generalizability of the findings.\nWe examine the predictive effect of consumer trust on indirect reciprocity in \u201cSocial Commerce Helping Farmers.\u201d In other situations or for other research subjects, future research could consider the impact of other perceptual factors on indirect consumer reciprocity and additional boundary conditions.\nWhile comprehensive, this study is only an initial foray into the field. Future researchers should conduct in-depth research from multiple perspectives. For example, this study only discusses consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity pre-variable. This study focuses mainly on the process by which consumers generate indirect reciprocal intentions without extending to the actual indirect reciprocal behavior. In other words, our research is still stuck in the measurement of intention. Future research may analyze consumers\u2019 indirect reciprocity behavior in actual purchase situations to measure the impact of firms making prosocial practices transparent to consumers.\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org"
