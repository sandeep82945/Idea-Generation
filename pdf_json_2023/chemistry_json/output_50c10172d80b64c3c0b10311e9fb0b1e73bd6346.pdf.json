In anaerobic conditions, toxic aromatic amines can form, exacerbating the issue.4\nFor this purpose, researchers are researching new approaches and new functional materials for the removal of pollutants. Adsorption involves the removal of contaminants by attracting and binding them to a solid surface. It offers advantages such as high efficiency, simplicity, and versatility.5 However, it may require frequent replacement or regeneration of adsorbents and may be limited in capacity and selectivity. Photocatalysis uses light-activated catalysts to degrade contaminants and offers advantages such as rapid degradation rates, the potential for mineralization, and versatility in treating a wide range of contaminants. However, it can be hindered by catalyst stability, limited light penetration, and the formation of potentially toxic by-products.6,7 Microwave catalysis uses microwave energy to generate heat for enhanced contaminant degradation. It offers advantages like rapid reaction kinetics, energy efficiency, and scalability.8,9 However, challenges include careful optimization of operating conditions and the potential for heating non-target compounds.

These processes involve the generation of sulfate radicals (SO4c\u2212) via persulfate (PS) and peroxy-disulfate (PDS, S2O8\n2\u2212), or the coproduction of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals (HOc) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO5\n\u2212), as well as their redox potential (2.5\u20133.1 V vs. NHE), which surpasses that of the hydroxyl radical (1.9\u20132.7 V vs. NHE). Furthermore, these methods offer high stability and can operate over a wide pH range (3\u20139).10,11 There are several methods for the activation of PMS, namely thermal process, ultrasound, UV irradiation and transition metals.12 In particular, the activation of PMS by heterogeneous transition metal catalysts has attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent catalytic ability for the rapid decomposition of a wide variety of pollutants.13,14 Over the past few years, many researchers have been developing many catalysts based on tungstates,15 oxides,16,17 vanadates,18,19 metal\u2013organic frameworks20 for the decomposition of various organic pollutants as well as sewage treatment. Besides these materials, cobalt-based spinels (MCo2O4 where M = Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, etc.), based on their catalytic and structural properties, have received much attention in the degradation of organic pollutants. According to literature, various kinds of ternary spinels such as CuCo2O4,21 NiCo2O4,22,23 MnCo2O4,24 have been studied intensively as catalysts for PMS activation and decomposition of organic pollutants. Of the above, ZnCo2O4 has a normal spinel structure, with Zn2+ being located in the centers of the tetrahedral coordinate positions (Td), and Co3+ occupies the octahedral environment. Hence, in comparison to Co3O4, using ZnCo2O4 may reduce the rare and relatively costly element Co without any compromise in catalytic activity.25,26 For these reasons, Hu et al.27, developed another efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator, ZnCo2O4, via a microwave-assisted procedure for the degradation of bisphenol A in aqueous solutions. They reported a degradation efficacy of 99.28% that was achieved within 5 min under the following conditions (ZnCo2O4: 0.2 g l\n\u22121) and [PMS]/ [BPA]molar = 2. Similarly, Gao et al.28, succeeded in fabricating a three-dimensional ZnCo2O4 catalyst through a hydrothermal approach which was eventually employed as persulfate (PS) activators by microwave irradiation to degrade levooxacin (LVF). A removal of LVF of 69.8% within 40 min was recorded by TOC technique at [pH]0 = 5, [LVF] = 10 ppm, [PS] = 5 mM, [ZCO] = 2 g l\u22121, T = 70 \u00b0C and MW = 700 W. Recently, the same team.29, examined the degradation of ciprooxacin (CIP) using persulfate (PS) activated with the 3D hybrid C@ZnCo2O4. The radical trapping investigation indicated that the radicals responsible for CIP degradation under the microwave irradiation process were SO4c \u2212, OHc and O2c \u2212, moreover under conditions of [PS] = 0.25 Mm, [C@ZnCo2O4] = 1.5 g l \u22121, MW = 600 W, T = 40 \u00b0C and [pH]0 = 6.5, the CIP removal rate was 90% during 40 min.\nNevertheless, the use of powdered materials has delayed their applications for small-scale sewage treatment and their commercialization primarily because of the difficulty of recovery and recycling of ne nanoparticles.30 As a result, it seems that encapsulating small materials in a biopolymeric matrix would be a favorable approach for both simpler\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nrecovery and increased adsorption capabilities.31,32 The most appropriate biopolymers that have attracted the attention of researchers is alginate.33 Alginate is a natural polymer that is highly biocompatible, relatively inexpensive, non-toxic, biodegradable, and renewable, making it an excellent adsorbent for both organic and inorganic pollutants that can be extracted from brown algae and bacteria. This linear polysaccharide is composed of b-D-mannuronic acid and a-Lguluronic acid monomers arranged in a non-regular and blockwise manner along the chain.34 Additionally, alginate can create stable hydrogels due to the strong junctions formed between the G blocks and divalent cations based on the \u201ceggbox\u201d model.35 Moreover, its carboxylate function endows alginate with a negative charge, transforming it into a useful polyelectrolyte that can conveniently capture cationic dyes, such as Rhodamine B (RhB), primarily through strong electrostatic interactions that enhance the contact between rhodamine B and ZnCo2O4.36 On the other hand, the pollutant degradation process involves a lot of experimental factors interacting in a non-linear manner. In this situation, the traditional approach of dye degradation optimization becomes ineffective as it takes a lot of experimental tests and time. Furthermore, this approach fails to depict the interaction effects of all operational parameters implicated in the degradation pathway. In an effort to surmount these setbacks, researchers are relying on statistically based experimental designs such as surface response methodology (RSM) to achieve effective optimization of the degradation process.37,38 RSM is viewed as a robust statistical method to design experiments, establish models by examining the inuence of multiple process parameters by changing them simultaneously.39,40 Thus, the ultimate goal of using RSM is to determine the optimal operating conditions within a brief period of time and a few experiments. Among the different matrix designs the BBD consists of an incomplete three-level factorial design. The totality of the experiments is reduced into a quadratic tting model which is excellent for accurately expressing linear interactions and quadratic effects. For example, Bouzayani et al.41, highlighted the usefulness of RSM-BBD as a statistical method to enhance and optimise the catalytic oxidation process of Direct red 111 dye effluents. Three several factors were considered in the optimization procedure, namely the concentration of PMS, the catalyst dose, and the temperature. The purpose of this study is to prepare novel bionanocomposite beads based on ZnCo2O4/Ca-Alg via a simple, fast and green procedure, then investigate their efficiency in the degradation of RhB from aqueous solution as a new hybrid process. The RhB degradation was optimized by varying four operating variables namely the RhB initial concentration, the catalyst dose, the PMS dose and the contact time using Box\u2013 Behnken Design (BBD). Kinetics, pH and temperature effects on the degradation process were also examined to gain insight into the degradation mechanisms. The reuse of our prepared material was also studied. The outcomes of this study will help further to develop an eco-friendly biocomposite for the largescale sewage treatment.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20150\u201320163 | 20151\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As can be seen, there is a strong absorption bands at 665 cm\u22121 and 568 cm\u22121 which are assigned to the metal\u2013oxygen bond vibrations of the synthesized material at the tetrahedral and octahedral coordinating metal ions, respectively.43,44 It is conrmed by the absence of an absorption band in the region of higher wavenumbers that organic materials, which were used during the synthesis process, are not present, revealing the successful synthesis of the ZnCo2O4 spinel. Fig. 2a, displays the spectrum of the characteristic bands of the sodium alginate molecule (NaAlg). The vibrational FTIR spectrum of NaAlg displays various peaks indicating the stretching vibrations of different chemical groups. Specically, the absorption bands at 868 cm\u22121 and 911 cm\u22121 are associated with the stretching vibration of Na\u2013O,45 while the peak at 1035 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching vibration of C\u2013O of the COO\u2013 and the alcohol groups (\u2013C\u2013OH) present in the polysaccharide structure of NaAlg.46,47 Moreover, the absorption bands at 1601 cm\u22121 and 1407 cm\u22121 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups (\u2013COO\u2013), respectively.48 The broad peak observed at 3321 cm\u22121 is due to the hydroxyl (O\u2013H) stretching vibration mode.49 These same peaks are also present in the FTIR spectrum of the NaAlg/ZnCo2O4 nanocomposite, indicating that the sodium alginate has bound to the surface of ZnCo2O4 and conrming the formation of ZnCo2O4\u2013NaAlg beads through surface modication. The XRD technique was utilized to determine the phase, crystallinity, and purity of the manufactured materials. The XRD patterns in Fig. 2b conrmed the formation of ZnCo2O4 composite in the sample with cubic structure. The peaks were numbered and indexed.

The linear terms of the four factors, the quadratic terms (X22 and X 2 3), and the interactive terms (X2X4 and X3X4) were found to have a p-value (less than 5%).27,46 The regression coefficients analysis (Table S5\u2020) shows that the most signicant coefficients that have a synergetic effect on RhB degradation efficiency are the linear terms (X1, X2 and X4), and the interactive term X3X4. On the other hand, the linear term X3, the quadratic terms (X 2 2 and X23), and the interaction term (X2X4) have an antagonist effect on the response (degradation efficiency). The 2D and 3D response surface plots in Fig. 4 illustrate the importance of the binary interactions between the chosen variables on RhB decomposition efficiency (%), namely catalyst mass, PMS mass, initial RhB concentration, and contact time.\nFor instance, it may be noticed from Fig. 4a that the RhB decomposition efficiency is greatly impacted by the RhB initial concentration while the catalyst dose has no signicant effect on the response variation. Also, it can be observed from the Fig. 4f that the RhB degradation efficiency is highly inuenced by the interaction effect of PMS dose and time. In accordance\n20156 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20150\u201320163\nwith these plots, the predicted value of optimal RhB degradation is (97.65 \u00b1 1.80)% using 1 g l\u22121 of catalyst dose, 1 g l\u22121 of PMS dose, a RhB concentration of 25 mg l\u22121 for only 40 minutes of agitation. The chosen approach proved to be very efficient and the results achieved showed that the RSM-BBD method yielded high values of RhB degradation (%) according to several scenarios given by the soware. As a result, the optimal operational parameters were employed to investigate the kinetics of RhB decomposition."

When ZnCo2O4/Alg NPs were employed with PMS, 98.87% of RhB was discolored in only 40 min, which is much better than that of the Co3O4/Alg/PMS and ZnO/Alg/PMS systems in which the respective discoloration efficiency of RhB is 84.94% and 22.95%, respectively. These comparative study indicate that the ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst outperforms its oxide components (ZnO/Alg and Co3O4/Alg). The outstanding degradation performance of the ZnCo2O4/Alg/ PMS system could stem from a number of aspects such as: (i) their small particle size (as calculated by the Debye\u2013Scherrer equation and observed by TEM), (ii) the highest surface hydroxyl group density (as characterized via FTIR), (iii) the synergistic coupling of Zn\u2013Co like already seen and proposed for Cu\u2013Co,55 Fe\u2013Co.56 However, encapsulation of ZnCo2O4 with alginate to form ZnCo2O4/Alg beads may retard the diffusion of RhB molecules inside the bead membranes, yet the availability of negative functional groups on alginates (OH and \u2013COOH) is advantageous for the adsorption of the cationic dye, moreover the addition of alginate on ZnCo2O4 may enhance their chemical stability and separation capability.\n3.4.2. Effect of pH and thermodynamic behavior investigation. Under the heterogeneous catalytic setup, the solution pH has a crucial role that inuences the catalytic behavior.57 Consequently, the inuence of solution pH on RhB decomposition has been studied in the ZnCo2O4@Alg/PMS system. To make a detailed study of this effect, we regulated the pH of the solution to 3.2 and 11 at the temperature T = 25 \u00b0C, and under the optimum conditions found from the RSM study ([catalyst]= 1 g l\u22121, [RhB] = 25 mg l\u22121, [PMS] = 1 g l\u22121). As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the catalytic decomposition is dependent on the pH value of the aqueous solutions of RhB, of which the greatest removal occurred at a pH equal to 7.5 with a removal efficiency of 98.28% within 30 min of reaction and a rate constant (kobs = 0.1459 min\u22121). The measurement of the point of zero charge\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n(pHpzc) of the ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst (Fig. 6c), revealed that the surface of the material was negatively charged at pH > 7.2 and positively charged at pH < 7.2. In the same context the low degradation rate obtained at pH = 3.2 (44.92% with kobs = 0.0141 min\u22121) can be explained by the nature of RhB molecules which may have existed mostly as RhB+, as RhB has a dissociation constant (pKa) of 3.7, which resulted in electrostatic repulsion and hindered the adsorption of RhB onto the catalyst surface.50,58\nThis decrease may also be attributed to the H+ ion scavenging effect for SOc\u2212 and OHc (eqn (5) and (6)), also a comparatively higher concentration of H+ ions will restrict the dissociation of PMS and allow the formation of H2SO5 that will partially substitute HSO5\n\u2212, thus lowering the electrostatic attraction between positively charged ZnCo2O4/Alg and PMS.23,59\nIt is also well documented that the acid H2SO5 with a pKa1 < 0 corresponds to the reaction (H2SO54HSO5\n\u2212 + H+), while pKa2 z 9.4 corresponds to the reaction (HSO5 \u2212 4 SO5 2\u2212 + H+). PMS is mainly present in the form of SO5 2\u2212 in strongly alkaline media (pH > 9.4), as HSO5 \u2212 in acidic, neutral, and slightly alkaline solutions (pH < 9.4), and as both HSO5 \u2212and SO5\n2\u2212 at approximately pH 9.4.60,61 Increasing the pH from 9.1 to 11 reduces the elimination rate of RhB due to the inhibitory effect of strongly alkaline media on PMS cleavage (pKa = 9.4). At pH < 9.4, HSO5 \u2212 ions dominate while SO5 2\u2212 ions become dominant at higher pH.50 The higher the alkalinity of the solution, the greater the electrostatic repulsion between the negative surface of the catalyst (ZnCo2O4/Alg) and PMS, resulting in lower activation of PMS on the catalyst surface,62 and ultimately low catalytic activity at pH = 11. Additionally, under alkaline conditions, SO4c\u2212 radicals can combine with hydroxyl anions (OH\u2212) to form a less potent oxidant, HOc, (SO4c\n\u2212 + HOc\u2212 / SO4 2\u2212 + HOc).63\nOn the contrary, the impact of temperature on peroxymonosulfate activation is signicant. Therefore, three distinct temperature values of 25, 35, and 45 \u00b0C were utilized to investigate the effect of PMS activation, which is shown in Fig. 6d. The ndings indicate that at 45 \u00b0C, RhB degradation was accomplished in 12 minutes, demonstrating that temperature has a signicant effect on the speed of oxidative degradation of RhB. Moreover, the degradation of RhB at various temperatures was described using the kinetic modulus of pseudo rst order (ln(C/C0) = \u2212kt) Fig. 6e, where C and C0 denote the concentrations of RhB at time t = tmin and time t = 0, respectively. Here, k is the rate constant, and t is the reaction time in minutes. At 25 \u00b0C, the degradation constant for RhB was determined to be 0.1031 min\u22121 (R2 = 0.9948), while at 35 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C, the degradation constants were 0.2859 min\u22121 (R2 = 0.9886) and 0.5224 min\u22121 (R2 = 0.9806), respectively. These ndings can be attributed to the substantial liberation of SO4c\u2212 radicals at higher temperatures. Additionally, by utilizing the Arrhenius equation (eqn (7)), it was possible to determine the activation\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20150\u201320163 | 20157\nFig. 6 (a) The influence of various pH values upon the decomposition of RhB.

The calculated activation energy (Ea) was determined to be 64.14 kJ mol\u22121. From this, it may be concluded that the temperature was benecial for the decomposition of RhB.65 Moreover, the calculated activation energy (Ea) value was considerably higher than the diffusion-controlled Ea values (ranging from 10\u201313 kJ mol\u22121), implying that the observed reaction rate primarily depended on the chemical reaction rate of the ZnCo2O4/Alg surface, this is in agreement with previous reports.66,67\n3.4.3. Effect of the amount of sodium alginate on the catalytic activity. The amount of sodium alginate can signicantly inuence the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of the nanocomposites. To investigate this, a series of experiments were conducted by varying the amount of sodium alginate in the formulation (Fig. S6\u2020). The ZCO weight was kept constant at 0.5 g in 100 ml of water to minimize costs and prevent interference with alginate bead formation. Although the catalyst with a 1/1 ratio showed good results, the stability of the beads was compromised, rendering it unsuitable for use. The results indicate that the percentage of sodium alginate has an adverse impact on the efficiency of ZCO. This can be attributed\n20158 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 20150\u201320163\nto sodium alginate acting as a barrier for rhodamine B, leading to a delay in its degradation, however the availability of negative functional groups on alginates (OH and \u2013COOH) is advantageous for the adsorption of the cationic dye, moreover the addition of alginate on ZnCo2O4 may enhance their chemical stability and separation capability. Consequently, the experiment aimed to determine the optimal ratio by identifying the best-performing combination.\n3.4.4. A comparative study of different oxidants (PMS, PS, and H2O2). Besides PMS, other studies have evaluated PS and H2O2 in AOPs.68\u201370 In this study we have benchmarked the ability of ZnCo2O4/Alg NPs as a catalytic activator for the following oxidants (PMS, PS, H2O2) in the decomposition of RhB. As can be noticed in Fig. S7,\u2020 the decomposition efficacy of the ZnCo2O4/Alg/PMS, ZnCo2O4/Alg/PS and ZnCo2O4/Alg/H2O2 systems was 98.48%, 71.16% and 48.45% respectively. The greater oxidative potencies of the former two systems could be related to the fact which O\u2013O bond energy within PMS (140 < EPMS < 213.3) and PS (140 kJ mol\n\u22121) is smaller as compared to H2O2 (213.3 kJ mol\n\u22121), which renders the activation of PS and PMS energetically easier. Although the PMS oxidation potential (1.82 V) is smaller than that of PS (2.01 V), the degradation rate of PMS is greater than that of PS, this was caused by the nonsymmetric PMS structure which seems to render it more readily activated.71\n3.4.5. Stability of the ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst. One of the problems in wastewater processing is the durability of the catalyst activity throughout the depollution procedure.

Aer repeating the procedure 5 times, the catalyst efficiency slowly reduced from 98% to 78% of discoloration. The insignicant decrease in performance aer the h run can be associated with: (i) the covering of the active sites onto the surface of the catalyst. (ii) Low losse of activator elements in the separation/drying operation prior to the following cycle. The FTIR analysis (Fig. 7b) proves the stability of the ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst, since there are no changes in the bands corresponding to the ZnCo2O4 and the polymer aer their reuses. These ndings are indicative of the excellent stability and reusability of the ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst. In addition to their stability, the newly developed hydrogel beads catalysts are effective against RhB degradation, easily prepared, environmentally friendly, recyclable and therefore have potential future industrial applications.\n3.4.6. RhB mineralization by COD analysis. COD analyses were performed to illuminate the mineralization during the catalyst/PMS/dye operation. As illustrated in Fig. 8a and b the COD removal efficiency at 40 min was 82%. It is well noticed that the color reduction was higher compared to COD in this setup that is similar with other research.72 This might be justied based on the fact that the intermediates are tougher to decompose and their oxidation rate could be substantially slower than those of the original compound.73,74 Besides, it can be concluded that the use of the ZCO/PMS catalyst resulted in an acceptable removal efficiency per COD which shows the ability of the catalyst to activate the PMS and generate a surplus of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals.\n3.4.7. The proposed mechanism. PMS can be catalyzed by ZnCo2O4/Alg to yield SO4c\n\u2212 and OHc radicals. To nd out the catalytic behavior of every free radical upon the decomposition of RhB, chemical deactivation tests of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BA)\nFig. 7 (a) Recycling test of the ZCO/Alg catalyst. (b) FTIR spectrum of th\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nand ethanol (EtOH) were independently added in to the experimental system as deactivating agents. A number of investigations have beenmade in the literature demonstrating that alpha hydrogen-containing alcohols like EtOH may react readily with OHc and SO4c\n\u2212 radicals,75,76 and are capable of scavenging both OHc with (k = (1.2\u20132.8) \u00d7 109 M\u22121 s\u22121) and SO4c\n\u2212 with (k = (1.6\u2013 7.7) \u00d7 107 M\u22121 s\u22121).57,77 Whereas t-BA is regarded as a trapper of OHc radicals solely with (k = (3.8\u20137.6) \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121).78,79 As depicted in Fig. S8a,\u2020 the quenching tests are given in the form of a reaction rate constant. When a concentration of 1 mmol l\u22121 t-BA and EtOH were added into the combined ZnCo2O4/Alg system, the RhB elimination rates were reduced to 85% and 50%, respectively and the kinetic constants were dropped (Fig. S8b\u2020). Within the presence of EtOH there was a considerable decrease of the RhB, indicating that the OHc and SO4c \u2212 radicals were caught by the alcohol molecules, whereas a slight decrease of the RhB was observed when using t-BA. Outcomes clearly reveal that the main dominant radical involved in the decomposition process is SO4c\n\u2212 while OHc radicals can also be included; however, their participation is negligible in comparison to SO4c \u2212 radicals. Besides SO4c \u2212 and OHc radicals, the superoxide intermediate (O2c \u2212) also plays an inuential role as a reactive species in the free radical oxidation reaction. The O2c \u2212 scavenging tests were carried out using p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) as a selective quencher with high reaction rate toward O2c\n\u2212 (k = 9 \u00d7 108 M\u22121 s\u22121).80,81 Fig. S8a and b\u2020 indicate that the catalytic activities of ZCO/Alg are slightly reduced aer the addition of pBQ, and the reaction rate constant is weakly attenuated from 0.0959 min\u22121 (no quencher) to 0.0706 min\u22121, indicating that O2c\n\u2212 is not the dominant ROS in the ZCO/Alg system.

Comparison with catalyst systems described in the literature. The competitiveness of the currently developed catalyst has been examined in comparison to different catalysts mentioned in the literature for their RhB degradation efficiency via PMS activation, as illustrated in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, our produced catalyst exhibited highly competitive RhB degradation compared to other systems, such as NiO-NiFe2O4rGO (where 1.5 g l\u22121 of the catalyst degraded 20 ppm of RhB within 40 minutes),83 and 5% Ca\u2013Fe2O3 (achieving 99% degradation using 1 g l\u22121 of the catalyst for 120 minutes).84 Taking into account all the advantages and disadvantages of the reported catalyst systems, it is evident that the currently developed catalyst demonstrates a moderate degradation efficiency compared to other systems that required a recovery step either through centrifugation or magnetic separation."

            "text": "This paper outlines a pathway for the manufacture of novel bionanocomposite based on ZnCo2O4/Alg. The prepared ZCO coated with alginate was found to be capable of activating PMS and generating a large quantity of sulfate radicals able to decompose RhB molecules. The several key factors, including the RhB concentration, the dose of ZCO/Alg, the dose of PMS and the reaction time were mathematically investigated using a statistical tool called RSM. RhB decomposition efficacy of 98% was reached for the optimized conditions of a PMS dose of 1 g l\u22121, the catalyst dose of 1 g l\u22121, dye concentration of 25 mg l\u22121 and a time of 40 min. The trapping tests showed that the SO4c \u2212 radical plays a more critical function in the decomposition studies of RhB. Moreover, The ZnCo2O4/Alg catalyst has shown excellent stability and reusability based on recycling tests. The employment of ZCO/Alg composite as catalyst for the activation of PMS can be considered as a future efficient material for the organic contaminants deterioration and the sewage treatment through the decomposition procedure.\nAuthor contributions\nBadr-Eddine Channab: writing the dra, data curation; formal analysis.
