    "abstractText": "Objectives: Based on a real-world collaboration with innovators in applying early health economic modeling, we aimed to offer practical steps that health technology assessment (HTA) researchers and innovators can follow and promote the usage of early HTA among research and development (R&D) communities. Methods: The HTA researcher was approached by the innovator to carry out an early HTA ahead of the first clinical trial of the technology, a soft robotic sock for poststroke patients. Early health economic modeling was selected to understand the potential value of the technology and to help uncover the information gap. Threshold analysis was used to identify the target product profiles. Value-of-information analysis was conducted to understand the uncertainties and the need for further research. Results: Based on the expected price and clinical effectiveness by the innovator, the new technology was found to be cost-saving compared to the current practice. Risk reduction in deep vein thrombosis and ankle contracture, the incidence rate of ankle contracture, the compliance rate of the new technology, and utility scores were found to have high impacts on the value-for-money of the new technology. The value of information was low if the new technology can achieve the expected clinical effectiveness. A list of parameters was recommended for data collection in the impending clinical trial. Conclusions: This work, based on a real-world collaboration, has illustrated that early health economicmodeling can informmedical innovation development.We provided practical steps in order to achieve more efficient R&D investment in medical innovation moving forward.",

Methods: The HTA researcher was approached by the innovator to carry out an early HTA ahead of the first clinical trial of the technology, a soft robotic sock for poststroke patients. Early health economic modeling was selected to understand the potential value of the technology and to help uncover the information gap. Threshold analysis was used to identify the target product profiles. Value-of-information analysis was conducted to understand the uncertainties and the need for further research. Results: Based on the expected price and clinical effectiveness by the innovator, the new technology was found to be cost-saving compared to the current practice. Risk reduction in deep vein thrombosis and ankle contracture, the incidence rate of ankle contracture, the compliance rate of the new technology, and utility scores were found to have high impacts on the value-for-money of the new technology. The value of information was low if the new technology can achieve the expected clinical effectiveness. A list of parameters was recommended for data collection in the impending clinical trial. Conclusions: This work, based on a real-world collaboration, has illustrated that early health economicmodeling can informmedical innovation development.We provided practical steps in order to achieve more efficient R&D investment in medical innovation moving forward.\nIntroduction\nMedical innovation is critical for addressing unmet public health needs and often the answer in times of global health crises, like the cases of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies as well as vaccines for COVID-19 (1;2). Worldwide, billions of dollars are invested in medical product development annually (3). However, it is unclear whether all of these medical innovations can deliver the expected outcomes and bring additional health benefits to the society (4;5). Proper guidance is required tomaximize the chances of successful health technology development and to enhance the efficiency of the research and development (R&D) system.\nEarly health technology assessment (early HTA) has gained increasing attention from policymakers and researchers given its potential for guiding the medical innovation development. It embraces all methods used to inform industry and other stakeholders about the potential value of newmedical products in development, includingmethods to quantify andmanage uncertainty (6). Various conceptual frameworks have been developed to apply earlyHTA (7\u20139). Technicalmethods have also been proposed to deal with the challenges of conducting studies at the early innovation stages, such as lack of information and high uncertainties (10\u201313). The appropriate methods to use depend on the stage of the medical innovation and the purpose of the study.\nNevertheless, early HTA is not widely applied among R&D communities. There are several challenges for early HTA including a disconnection between R&D communities and HTA communities; a lack of awareness of early HTA and its benefits among R&D communities; no standardmethodological approach and process guidelines for early HTA; and a lack of examples of successful collaborations between HTA researchers and innovators in applying early HTA (6;14).\nMany existing hypothetical early-HTA studies without the involvement of innovators show the theoretical steps that innovators and researchers can follow (15\u201318); however, certain steps may not be feasible in reality given the considerable challenges faced by and concerns of\nCite this article: Wang Y, Low F-Z, Low Y-Y, Lai H-S, Lim J-H, Yeow C-H, Teerawattananon Y (2023).

Early HTA should be integrated into the innovation process which is frequently driven by the urgency of innovators to get the technology into the market, sometimes in a secretive manner (19). Challenges in integrating early HTA into real-world innovation process are, therefore, less well-studied (20). Real-world collaboration between innovators and HTA researchers is important to identify the challenges and bridge the gap.\nSeveral real-world early-HTA studies along the innovation process have been published, but looked at different innovation stages and settings from this present study (21;22). In our study, the innovator was at the stage with a product prototype before conducting its first clinical trial. We used early health economic modeling to address the request by the innovator. While early health economic modeling has been recommended for more than 20 years (23;24), the details of the early health economic modeling are less frequently published and remain an under-researched area (25).\nAt no time in history has theworld ever been in such demand for a health technology to be successfully developed, efficiently delivered and largely impactful than in the current global health pandemic of COVID-19. In this study, we illustrate a real-world collaboration betweenHTA researchers and innovators in applying early HTA along the innovation process using early health economic modeling. The aim of the early health economic modeling is to help the innovator understand the potential value of the technology and uncover the data and information gap. The objectives of this study are (i) to describe the steps taken during the entire collaboration; (ii) to present the methodological approaches and analyses; and (iii) to conclude the lessons learnt from the collaboration. We aim to use this real-world collaboration as a concrete example to demonstrate practical steps that HTA researchers and innovators can follow when carrying out similar activities.\nBackground: medical issues and the technology\nPatients with stroke who are unable to walk are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially during the period of inpatient stay (26;27). Subsequently, DVT can cause a fatal condition \u2013 pulmonary embolism (PE). Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is an inflatable device that can improve venous circulation in the limbs of patients. Evidence of IPC\u2019s effectiveness in reducing DVT is mixed in the literature (27\u201331). Spasticity is another common stroke complication, which could lead to joint contracture and functional impairment (32;33). Continuous passive motion (CPM), which repeatedly moves a joint through a predefined range, has been used to release joint contractures. In hospital wards, either bedside passive stretching can be applied to the patients regularly or splints can be prescribed to keep the joint stretched to maintain ankle joint mobility. The limitations of the contracture management in the hospital wards are that the passive stretching can be very labor-intensive to apply sufficiently. The effect will be limited by improper donning and further induced discomfort to the patients.\nThe medical problem that the clinical team faced for poststroke treatment was that there was not a single device that could simultaneously exercise the immobilized foot to prevent DVT and ankle joint contracture, where prolonged immobilization was a direct cause of both complications. Therefore, the innovator proposed a system named the Venous Assistance and Contracture Management (VACOM), as shown in Figure 1. The system incorporates soft fabric and pneumatic actuators to assist in ankle mobilization, and also conventional IPC device for improving venous circulation in the limbs of patients (34;35).\nThe benefits of the VACOM device over current standard practice are that first patients can maximize their rehabilitation and recovery poststroke by having a device that provides ankle mobilization while patients are resting in bed. Second, the device reduces the need for use of conventional bulky devices such as the CPM and manpower requirements."

During the inpatient stay, patients may develop DVT and/or PE. For patients who die during the inpatient stay, we assumed they die on the 15th day. For the discharged patients, we considered recurring stroke, recurring DVT, recurring PE, ankle contracture and death. All these adverse events were assumed to happen at the start of the 7th month. More detailed assumptions for the model are presented in the Supplementary Appendix.\nParameter Values\nThe clinical effectiveness and cost of VACOMwere proposed by the innovator based on their expectation and the results from the previous generation product (35). Epidemiology parameters including incidence rate of DVT, PE, and ankle contracture, mortality rate, and recurrent rate of stroke and complications were derived from the existing literature and government reports (27;37\u2013 41). Direct medical cost for stroke patients was collected by the clinical team and derived from the literature, with local studies being prioritized if available (27;42). All the costs were converted into 2019 Singapore dollars (S$). Utility parameters were derived from the literature (43\u201346).

We refer this extra price comparing VACOM with IPC plus manual ankle movement as price premium hereafter. VACOM is cost-saving under both the optimistic scenario and the conservative scenario, as shown in Table S2 of the Supplementary Appendix. Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix shows the relationship between price premium and ICER, demonstrating the maximum price premium given different ceiling thresholds. Figure S2 in the Supplementary Appendix shows the CEAC.\nThis price premium of S$150 was revised from the original price premium of S$300 initially set by the innovators. This is because, based on the results from the original analysis using the conservative scenario, the probability of VACOM being cost-effective at the original price premium is only 40\u201350 percent while this probability is above 90 percent at the revised price premium.\nRelative Importance of Key Parameters\nFigure 3 shows the tornado plots from one-way DSA using NMB.

The overall benefit of additional research is low. More specifically, if the innovator can justify the parameter values used in the analysis in the coming clinical trial, for example, the expected clinical efficacy of VACOM, additional study may not be required. Further, considering the price premium of S$300, EVPI is low under the optimistic scenario compared to the conservative scenario, which suggests a potential trade-off between investing money in improving VACOM and investing money in future research to minimize parameter uncertainty. To help the innovator understand how to prioritize parameters if uncertainties are high, we examined the EVPPI under the scenarios with high EVPI. Price premium of S $1,000 under the optimistic scenario and S$300 under the conservative scenario were considered. The results are presented in Figure S7 of the Supplementary Appendix.

However, early HTA is not widely applied among R&D communities due to various barriers. Our work contributes to the literature by showing the experience of a real-world collaboration between HTA researchers and innovators while the technology is in themiddle of the development process. A summary of the practical steps is presented in Table 1, in which other HTA researchers and innovators can follow. However, readers should be mindful that this work focused on early health economic modeling to inform medical innovation development based on economic values. HTA is a multidisciplinary process considering social, ethical, legal and organizational dimensions as well. These dimensions are also important to consider in developing and adopting the new technology.\nThe literature on the theoretical framework of early HTA and methodological development is abundant. While there are established guidelines and checklist for conducting traditional HTA (52), to the best of our knowledge, no such guideline exists for early HTA and early health economic modeling. Innovators are among the target audience of early HTA, which differs from traditional HTA for informing coverage decisions that targets national and hospital decision makers. However, there is little work in the early HTA literature on understanding the needs and concerns of innovators. Without a grasp on innovators\u2019 preferences, the research framework developed by the HTA researchers may not be accepted by innovators. Real-world collaborations betweenHTA researchers\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S026646232200335X Published online by Cambridge University Press\nand innovators are important in gauging the needs of innovators as well as to understand how to adaptmethods in early HTA setting to avoid undue delay in R&Dprocess while still maintain the quality of the work. These experiences can be harnessed to develop methodological and process guidelines for early HTA, which will be helpful in advancing early HTA collaborations between innovators and HTA researchers.\nEarly HTA includes many methods for different purposes depending on the innovation stage. While it is ideal to conduct early HTA from the conceptualization stage and throughout the product development process, this requires a strong commitment from innovators and understanding fromHTA researchers who are usually conducting assessments on market-approved products for coverage decisions. Practical constraints in conducting technology assessment at the development phases, such as innovation timeline, unavailability of input data and confidential information disclosure, should have special attention in early HTA. In our study, the innovator had a prototype product available; and wanted to understand the quantitative values of their product, cost drivers, profitability and TPP in order to get guidance on their coming clinical trials. They also wanted to prepare materials to facilitate discussion with stakeholders and policymakers on the potential of the innovation. Early health economic modeling is appropriate to help the innovator better understand the innovation\u2019s clinical pathway, service cost drivers and TPP. The model can be iteratively updated using new information from the clinical trials and the comments from relevant stakeholders during future stakeholder consultations. Further, additional analyses on social, ethical and institutional implications can be conducted and combined with the current study.\nDifferent from traditional health economic evaluation, where the baseline scenarios such as patient and product profiles are usually fixed, the baseline scenarios for early health economic modeling are dynamic. HTA researchers need to perform several rounds of analyses and deliberate the intermediate results with innovators. The intermediate results can help innovators form more realistic expectations of the technology and perhaps revisit their plan about technology applications. In this study, the innovator revised the expected price premium in the middle of the study and requested the HTA research team to update the analysis. HTA researchersmay also considermultiple baseline scenarios; however, the amount of analysis could be overwhelming without limiting the number of the baseline scenarios. Toomany baseline scenarios may also mask the key messages and make the results difficult to interpret by innovators. The design and selection of scenarios should center around the key issues, such as clinical efficacy/effectiveness and price of a new technology as compared to its comparator(s) (13).\nParameters that have a high impact on the value for money of VACOMwere suggested to the innovator based on the results from DSA and VOI analysis. In practice, expected value of sample information (EVSI) and expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS) can be used to optimize the clinical trial design such as optimizing the sample size (51). However, EVSI and ENBS analyses were not conducted in this work for the following reasons. First, one of the major aims of the coming clinical trial was to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the innovation. Innovators wanted to understand the other useful information that can also be collected along the first clinical trial to aid subsequent decision making. Hence, statistical power should be the main consideration for determining sample size at this stage. EVPPI is enough to demonstrate the parameters having high values. Second, calculating EVSI and ENBS require\ninformation about data generation process and entire distribution of the parameters. At the stage of the analysis, there was not enough information and many assumptions were required. The results from the EVSI and ENBS will be less accurate. Hence, results from EVSI and ENBS analysis could be more useful after the parameter values being updated from the first clinical trial. More weight should be given to the results fromVOIwhen designing subsequent clinical trials. The HTA researchers should always bear in mind the stage of the innovation and produce the most valuable information to aid decision making.\nThreshold analysis was conducted considering the selected top parameters from DSA and examining the relationship between these parameters and the price premium. Similar analysis could be carried out on other parameters pairs. The innovator can use these results to consider whether further R&D can be justified in improving VACOM. Different from the academia where researchers often use ICER, the innovator found NMB concept easier to understandwhich can be linked to price and profit directly. As such, we presented the results using NMB where possible. Implicitly, this requires an explicit cost-effectiveness threshold.\nThe results derived are relevant to Singapore and need adaptation in order to extend to other countries. Not only do we used and prioritized information from Singapore in the analysis, but we also used cost-effectiveness threshold relevant for Singapore when calculating NMB. Furthermore, clinical care pathway could also be different in other countries, which could require a different model structure.\nAlthough price or the profit made by the manufacturer from VACOM will be one of the key factors for the innovator when making VACOM available on the market, the HTA researcher recommended the innovator to focus on optimizing the profile of VACOMand identify the right clinical setting and patient group for VACOM. Price itself does not reflect the value of VACOM. The true value of VACOM to the society is in the health benefit that it can bring to the patients and the reduction in medical costs. The information gained from this early HTA exercise can be used for discussion with the national regulatory agency in order to get their agreement on the proposed clinical end point(s) used in the future clinical studies.\nOne issue that emerged during the work relates to the definition of compliance. The compliance rate was found to have a high impact on the cost-effectiveness of VACOM. While the HTA researcher can simplify the concept and model compliance as binary at a patient level, the clinical definition of compliance is unclear. Hence, the researcher recommended the innovator to incorporate a monitoring system in VACOM. First, given that the meaning of \u201ccompliance\u201d is unclear in the clinical setting, the monitoring system can help the innovator understand the minimum required duration and frequency of wear in order to achieve the desired clinical effect. Second, it can help the innovator better estimate the compliance rate. Third, it can help the innovator identify patient group with low compliance rate.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the model and parameter values used in the study were based on the existing literature, government reports, and the inputs from the clinical team and the innovator. Local electronicmedical records could have been used to get more accurate parameter values. Still, HTA researchers need to be mindful of and work within tight timelines. The ethical approval for accessing data may take a few months. Given the medical innovation industry being highly competitive, HTA researchers need to consider how to complete the work in a timely manner to fit innovators\u2019 overall schedule. However, this does not mean the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S026646232200335X Published online by Cambridge University Press\nquality of the work was compromised. Researchers need to weigh up these practical challenges when identifying the best and most suitable data, information source, and methods for the study.\nSecond, themodel used is not a comprehensive model capturing the entire caring pathways. For example, other DVT prevention strategies, such as antiplatelet therapy could be used in practice. It is unclear how these other strategies may interact with VACOM. A 5-year time horizon was proposed at the beginning to capture longterm impact. A 1-year time horizon was used due to the following reasons: (i) high-quality long-term data were lacking; (ii) the innovator considered 1-year time horizon more helpful as the planned follow-up period for the coming clinical trial is 6 months; (iii) results from a 1-yearmodel likely bring conservative estimates of the cost-effectiveness of VACOM.Having amodel that is acceptable by the decision makers and HTA agencies is important. The clinical team\u2019s involvement in this study is important in assuring the model validity. The HTA researcher could further improve the model and its parameters through consulting other stakeholders including policymakers, professional groups, and relevant patients. However, there are a few concerns regarding stakeholder involvement in an early HTA. Confidential information disclosure and conflict of interest were among major issues as the innovator may not be willing to share information to other stakeholders or require certain administrative processes, for example, signing a nondisclosure agreement before the stakeholder consultation can take place. In our setting, this kind of procedure has not been well-established and the wider group of stakeholders is not familiar. The government, innovators and HTA researchers should work together to standardize, ideally simplify, these protocols to overcome the aforementioned challenges.\nThe limitations faced during the study show the importance of long-term collaboration between HTA researchers and innovators. Models are not static and can be improved, and more accurate data can be located and used. A long-term collaboration also allows the involvement of external panels and acquiring themost suitable data source. The current model and analysis can serve as a starting point for the innovator to plan their next steps and facilitate the discussion with relevant stakeholders. By continuously updating the model with new information that arises, the model at the early stage can serve as an intermediate model for the final model in the traditional HTA analysis. As such, for this study, the innovator and the HTA researcher agreed to meet again after the first clinical trial to update the results. The innovator was also recommended to consider horizon scanning systems to identify potential competitors and to examine patient preference in the clinical trial, for example, conjoint analysis."

Our results show the new technology is expected to be cost-saving, and suggest the directions to improve the technology and the data to be collected in the future clinical trial. Practical steps were provided for the researchers and innovators to conduct similar works. Challenges of the collaboration were highlighted. Early HTA is helpful in guiding medical innovation development, but its application among R&D communities is low. Real-world collaboration can raise the awareness of early HTA among R&D communities and promote the application of early HTA.\nSupplementary material.
