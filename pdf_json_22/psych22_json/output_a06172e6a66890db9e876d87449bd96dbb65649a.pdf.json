Empathic\ntraits and ToM ability were measured using the children\u2019s Empathy Quotient and the\nChinese version of ToM toolkit. Generalized linear models were used to assess the\ndifferences of prosocial behaviors and empathic traits, ToM ability between the two\ngroups and the associations between empathic traits, ToM ability and prosocial behaviors\nin autistic children.\nResults: Compared with TD children, autistic children exhibited worse ToM ability\nand performed less pro-socially in the DG paradigm, while there were no differences\nregarding empathic traits. In autistic children, empathic traits especially affective empathy,\nwere positively associated with parent-reported prosocial behaviors [\u03b2 = 0.17, 95%\nconfidence interval (CI): 0.07\u20130.27; \u03b2 = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.33\u20130.60]. ToM ability was\nassociated with DG paradigm (\u03b2 = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.16\u20131.89).\nConclusion: Autistic children showed less pro-sociality and ToM ability than TD\nchildren. In autistic children, empathic trait was associated with parent-reported prosocial\nbehaviors while their ToM ability was associated with prosocial behaviors in experimental\ncondition. Our findings indicated that better ToM ability and empathic trait might promote\nprosocial behaviors in autistic children.\nKeywords: autism spectrum disorder, prosocial behavior, empathy, Theory of Mind, Dictator Game"

            "text": "Prosocial behaviors, which refer to actions that one engages in to benefit others, like helping, sharing, and comforting, is often believed to be the basis of human relationships (1). Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) might display fewer prosocial behaviors compared with typically developing (TD) children which are likely due to the social-communication deficits associated with an ASD diagnosis (2). For example, school-aged autistic children presented fewer prosocial behaviors in daily life than typically developing (TD) children when using parent- or teacher-reported rating scales (e.g., the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) (3, 4). However, in experimental settings, several studies have found that preschool autistic children do show helping behaviors (5, 6). In resource allocation tasks [e.g., Dictator Game (DG) and Ultimatum Game (UG)], autistic children showed a higher preference for equality than self-interest compared to TD children (7\u201310); but they tended to accept unfair offers (7, 10). Different measures might identify different situation of prosocial behaviors, resource allocation tasks such as DG is believed to be powerful to illuminate individuals\u2019 social interactions because it could examine the extent to which individuals attain their own goals while simultaneously displaying altruistic behavior toward unrelated individuals. However, directly measure of prosocial behavior in specific experimental environment may be lack of ecological validity (11). Therefore, it is particularly important to evaluate prosocial behaviors from different dimensions. In China, the study of prosocial behaviors in autistic children is limited and more studies are needed.\nEmpathy and Theory of Mind (ToM) are generally considered to be the major determinants of prosocial behaviors (12, 13). Empathy has been described as the ability to infer and share the emotional experiences with another (14), and consists of two components (15): the ability to understand the emotional state\nof others and distinguish another\u2019s feelings from one\u2019s own (i.e., cognitive empathy), and the ability to vicariously experience of\nthe emotional experiences of others and respond emotionally in an appropriate way (i.e., affective empathy) (15). ToM, on the other hand, has been referred to as the attribution of mental states, such as emotion, desires, intentions and beliefs to others (16, 17). Given the theoretical similarities, cognitive empathy refers to a complex cognitive capacity, largely overlapping with ToM ability (12, 15). However, increasing studies have argued that ToM ability differs from empathy because ToM does not denote a sharing of another person\u2019s affective states, but rather a cognitive understanding of another person\u2019s mental states (18) (Supplementary Table S1 in Appendix A). ToM deficits have been considered as one of the major features in autistic children (19, 20). Studies have also shown impaired cognitive empathy but intact affective empathy in autistic children (21\u2013 24). Specifically, previous studies also indicated that there might be different roles of empathy or ToM ability on prosocial behaviors in children. Numerous researches have shown that prosocial behaviors, such as helping, sharing and comforting, are associated with preschool- and school-aged children\u2019s disposition to empathize with others (25\u201330). A meta-analysis of 6,432\nchildren (2\u201312 years) revealed that children with advanced ToM abilities were more likely to show prosocial behaviors (r = 0.19), especially cooperating behaviors (r = 0.24) (13). When studying prosocial behaviors in relation to empathy and ToM simultaneously, Abrams et al. (31) found that empathy was positively associated with prosocial behaviors, but the association between ToM and prosocial behaviors was only shown in the non-competitive situation. Longobardi et al. (32) found that both empathic concern and ToM had direct positive effects on prosocial behaviors in primary school children. However, few studies focus on the associations between empathy, ToM and prosocial behaviors in autistic children with inconsistent results. For instance, a study of 20 school-aged autistic children and 20 language-age matched counterparts found that affective empathy was strongly related to peer interaction and prosocial behaviors (helping and sharing) in school-aged autistic children (33), while other studies found no associations between empathic responses and prosocial behaviors in preschool-aged and schoolaged autistic children (34, 35). These earlier studies of autistic children with relatively small sample sizes only consider the role of empathy and ToM ability in prosocial behaviors separately, and to our knowledge, no studies have considered the role of empathy and ToM ability in prosocial behaviors simultaneously or defined them distinctly. In this study, we measured empathy and ToM simultaneously and evaluated prosocial behaviors via both parent-reported rating scales and experiments in autistic children and TD children in mainland China. We aimed to investigate the role of empathy or ToM ability in prosocial behaviors between these two groups."

The rating scale we used was the subscale of prosocial behavior in the Chinese version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The subscale has five items rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = certainly true). The total score of the five items ranges from 0 to 10 (higher scores represent more prosocial behaviors). The Chinese version of SDQ has been validated with a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.73 for total score and 0.65 for subscale of prosocial behaviors (37).\nChildren\u2019s prosocial behaviors were also assessed using the Dictator Game (DG) paradigm (38), which has been validated in TD children aged 3\u201311 years in our previous study (39). In the DG paradigm, the dictator is given a windfall resource to allocate between him/herself and the virtual recipient who has no right to reject the offer. We arranged three settings to exclude factors that may affect children\u2019s decisions: (1) to avoid the influence of social distance, we set up a virtual anonymous character with the same gender and age as the participant (40); (2) to eliminate repeated interactions that might affect participant\u2019s willingness to share (i.e., in the repeated interaction settings, individuls may change his/her willingness to share by looking forward to the next round of feedback from the partner), we set up a one-shot interaction (40, 41); (3) to decrease the reputation effect caused by bystanders, we left the child alone in the room when he/she made decisions (42). We used stickers as allocated resources and prosocial behavior was measured based on the number of stickers that children shared and the decision to share or not. We also asked the children about their preference regarding the stickers by scores from 0 to 10.\nThe children\u2019s Empathy Questionnaire (EQ-C) was used to assess empathic traits. It has 27 items (13 reverse-scored items) rated on a 3-point scale: 2 = strongly agree, 1 = agree, 0 = disagree/strongly disagree (43). The Taiwan version was revised to 20 items (8 reverse-scored items) with three subscales of affective empathy, cognitive empathy and disrupt behaviors (44). We calculated the total score for all items and subscale scores for affective and cognitive empathy, and higher scores denoted stronger traits. The EQ-C and subscales have been validated with\na Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.84, 0.69, 0.79, and 0.74 (44) (The detail of Taiwan version of EQ-C is shown in Supplementary Table S3 in Appendix A).\nWe used a set of ToM tasks which were adapted for use in China and have previously shown a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of 0.75 (45). Three subtasks were included: emotion attribution task, unexpected content task (46), and Sally-Anne task (47). In each subtask, children were marked with a pass when they gave the correct answer. We defined passing the ToM tasks when the children gave correct answers for all the three subtasks.\nThe detailed materials of the DG paradigm and the ToM tasks are provided in Appendix B of the Supplementary Material."

WISC-IV provides a full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) based on the sum of scores from the 10 core subtests, as well as four index scores: Verbal Comprehension Index, Perceptual Reasoning Index,WorkingMemory Index, and Processing Speed Index (48).\nSeverity of ASD symptoms was assessed via the Chinese Social Response Scale (SRS) which is a 65-item questionnaire used for children between 4 to 18 years. Each item is scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not true) to 4 (almost always true). Total score was calculated ranging from 0 to 195, and higher scores indicated severe ASD symptoms.

The BRIEF is parent reported with 86 items using responses as follow: Never, Sometimes, or Often, coded as 1, 2, or 3, respectively.

Autistic children\u2019s mothers had low education levels with low household income compared with their counterparts (\u03c72 = 9.71 and 38.14, all P < 0.01). There were no differences between groups in child\u2019s age (t = 1.53, P = 0.11) or maternal age t = 0.57, P = 0.56).\nAs shown in Figure 1 (detailed data shown in Supplementary Table S6 in Appendix A), after adjusting for potential covariates, there were no significant difference in EQ-C total score and the subscale score of affective empathy and cognitive empathy between autistic children and TD children (10.8 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 19.4 \u00b1 6.2, 3.4 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 6.5 \u00b1 3.0, 2.4 \u00b1 1.9 vs. 5.5\u00b1 2.7; \u03b2 =\u22121.96, 95%CI:\u22124.05\u223c0.12, P = 0.06; \u03b2 =\u22120.52, 95%CI:\u22120.27\u223c-0.58, P = 0.40; \u03b2 =\u22120.12, 95%CI:\u22121.06\u223c0.82, P = 0.80).

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "When using parent-reported measurements, we did not find differences in prosocial behaviors between autistic children and TD children; and empathic traits, especially affective empathy, was associated with prosocial behaviors in autistic children. However, we found poorer prosocial behaviors in autistic children than those in TD children when using experimental measurements, which were found to be associated with ToM ability.\nInconsistent results were previously obtained in three observational studies [one in Japan (3), two in the UK (4, 52)], indicating that parent-reported prosocial behaviors in 6\u201312 yearold autistic children were poorer than TD children. These earlier studies did not consider several important confounders (i.e., socio-economic and cognitive factors), while our study employed a large sample size with comprehensive information on these potential confounders. However, the inconsistency might have also resulted from cultural differences, such as culturally-specific norms and different socialization processes, thus affecting Chinese parents\u2019 evaluation of their children\u2019s prosocial behaviors (53). Unlike parent-reported measurements, we found that autistic children performed less pro-socially in experimental conditions. Similarly, several studies conducted in Western countries with small sample sizes found that autistic children can share things in resource allocation tasks (6, 10), but showed a higher preference for equality than self-interest compared to TD children (7, 54). In our study, prosocial behaviors measured\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 844578\nby the DG paradigm is a form of strong reciprocity, which is a behavior that people may increase the fitness of unrelated individuals at a cost to themselves. This kind of prosocial behaviors is crucial for humans to establish cooperation (55, 56). In this paradigm, advanced social cognitive functions interact with others and an understanding of social norms are required when participants display prosocial behavior toward unrelated individuals (11, 55). Our results indicated that experimental measurements might be able to capture behavioral characteristics of prosocial behaviors in autistic children, and future studies should confirm our findings by using both parent-reported and experimental measurements.\nWhen studying ToM ability and empathic traits simultaneously, we found that autistic children exhibited worse ToM ability but similar empathic traits than TD children. Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed that the ToM ability of autistic children was significantly lower than that of TD children (20, 57\u201359). However, autistic children had similar empathic trait compared to TD children, which was inconsistent with previous studies (43, 44, 60). When we further considered different types of empathy, we did not find differences in both affective and cognitive empathy. The results of affective empathy were consistent with most previous studies, indicating an intact affective empathy in school-aged autistic children (21, 23, 34, 61). However, parent-reported cognitive empathy in autistic children was not significantly lower than those in TD children, which was not in line with some of the previous findings (23, 61). This inconsistency might have resulted from the differences\nbetween self-reported questionnaires and behavioral assessments (21\u201323, 62). Moreover, most of the behavioral measurements of cognitive empathy were bundled together or conflated with ToM ability, resulting in the difficulties to distinguish cognitive empathy and ToM ability in these studies (21, 22). Fletcher-Watson and Bird (24) proposed that empathy can be broken down into four component stages: (1) noticing another\u2019s feeling; (2) correctly interpreting another\u2019s feelings; (3) feeling empathy; (4) responding in line with social norms. Although the subscale of cognitive empathy can reflect the second component of empathy, some of the items in this subscale might overlap with other components (i.e., item of 8 and 17 listed in the Supplementary Table S3 of Appendix A), limiting the power of this subscale. Therefore, more studies are needed to consider different components of empathy when studying the behavioral characteristics of autistic children.\nIn the DG paradigm, we found that ToM ability played an important role in the prosocial behaviors of autistic children. However, our previous study found that ToM ability did not contribute to prosocial behaviors of the DG paradigm in Chinese TD children, while other complex cognitive functions (i.e., inhibition control) may play a role in deciding resource allocation (39). In China, routinely enforced parental instruction that children should share things might eliminate the need for social insight to act as a trigger for sharing behavior for TD children in experimental conditions (13). Regrading autistic children, the development of social cognition is affected by the social motivation (63).

The resource allocation task in the context of game theory (i.e., DG paradigm) is developed based on the assumption that individuals can predict other people\u2019s actions when they understand others\u2019 motivations, preferences, and beliefs (18). Consequently, better ToM ability might contribute to prosocial behaviors of DG paradigm in autistic children. Our results might have clinical insights for behavioral interventions targeting social skills in real life since prosocial behaviors are of importance to social interaction, cooperation and adaptation (64). In this study, we only observed a positive association between empathic traits and parent-reported prosocial behaviors in autistic children, and the associations were more pronounced when considering affective empathy. Autistic children might understand the emotions of others and respond appropriately since they have intact affective empathy (21, 34, 61). According to the Intense World Theory, autistic children might have hyperperception and hyper-emotionality caused by hyper-functioning of local neural microcircuits (65). The vicariously emotional experience with others in autistic children might be intact or amplified, which could promote them to perform more prosocial behavior. Meanwhile, parents of ASD children tended to believe that their children behaved more pro-socially when they had higher affective empathic traits in Western countries\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 844578"

However, the results should be interpreted cautiously because empathy traits and prosocial behaviors in daily life were parent-reported, indicating the potential measurement error (34). Parents might report higher levels of empathic traits or prosocial behaviors due to exaggerated parental perceptions (66). One previous study in the Netherlands showed that the prosocial responses to peer distress were similar in autistic children and TD children in a computer task, indicating that the association between affective empathy and prosocial behaviors was less pronounced in experimental conditions (34), which was consistent with our findings. Since this is the first study to reveal the different role of empathic traits and ToM ability on prosocial behaviors in autistic children, more studies are needed to confirm our findings.\nThis study has several limitations. First, we used simple ToM toolkit instead of advanced ToM tasks, which might introduce a ceiling effect in TD children. However, our previous study has confirmed thatmost autistic childrenmay have struggled with the advanced ToM tasks (20, 58, 59). Further research is needed to develop appropriate paradigms to compare ToM ability between autistic children and TD children. Second, we were not able to measure empathic traits and ToM ability by parent-report and experiment condition, which might introduce potential confounding of our findings. Third, we only performed one single task of the DG paradigm, and therefore it might be subject to measurement errors. Fourth, the behavioral characteristics of prosocial behaviors might be different when offering different resources (e.g., food, toys, attachment objects) (67). We only used stickers in this study as allocation resources although we have investigated the degree of sticker preference, and if the children disliked the stickers, we might not have been able to elicit prosocial behaviors. We found weak correlation between the prosocial behaviors measured by parent-report and by experiments (r = \u22120.10) which indicated that children might behave differently in their natural social environment than in experimental conditions. Future research is needed to study children\u2019s sharing behaviors of different resources in their natural environment.
