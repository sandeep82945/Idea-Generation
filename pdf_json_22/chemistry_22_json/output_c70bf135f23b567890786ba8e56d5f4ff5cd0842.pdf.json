    "abstractText": "Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious beta-class coronavirus. Although vaccinations have shown high efficacy, the emergence of novel variants of concern (VOCs) has already exhibited traits of immune evasion. Thus, the development of tailored antiviral medications for patients with incomplete, inefficient, or non-existent immunization, is essential. The attachment of viral surface proteins to the cell surface is the first crucial step in the viral replication cycle, which for SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the high affinity interaction of the viral trimeric spike with the host cell surface-located human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2). Here, we used a novel and efficient next generation sequencing (NGS) supported phage display strategy for the selection of a set of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)-targeting peptide ligands that bind to the target protein with low \u03bcM to nM dissociation constants. Compound CVRBDL-3 inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein association to hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner for preas well as post-complex formation conditions. Further rational optimization yielded a CVRBDL-3 based divalent compound, which demonstrated inhibitory efficacy with an IC50 value of 47 nM. The obtained compounds were not only efficient for the different spike constructs from the originally isolated \u201cwt\u201d SARS-CoV-2, but also for B.1.1.7 mutant trimeric spike protein. Our work demonstrates that phage display-derived peptide ligands are potential fusion inhibitors of viral cell entry. Moreover, we show that rational optimization of a combination of peptide sequences is a potential strategy in the further development of therapeutics for the treatment of acute COVID-19.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a beta class coronavirus with the ability for human-to-human transmission that was initially discovered and characterized in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 [1,2]. Since then, it has challenged health care systems due to its rapid spread and\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10020441 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 2 of 23\nthe transmission of COVID-19 throughout the world. Far more than the past coronavirus pandemics, caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012, the ongoing pandemic has claimed over 5.7 million lives with over 386 million total cases across the world [3\u20136]. The coronavirus replication depends on a multi-step process starting with the interaction of the viral trimeric spike protein (S) and the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) receptor that mediates uptake of the viral RNA into the host-cell cytoplasm. Each monomer of the spike protein consists of the two functional subunits S1 and S2. The S1 subunit comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD) that interacts via a defined motif sequence (RBM) with an N-terminally located helical structure of the hACE2. In accordance with previous observations from SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has been found to exist in two conformational states, from which the \u2018up\u2019 state initiates interaction with hACE2 and the \u2018down\u2019 state\u2019s main function is the shielding of receptor binding relevant proportions from immune reactions [7]. The S2 subunit plays a crucial role in the membrane fusion process. While the S1-hACE2 interaction allows viral attachment to the host cell surface, the S2 site is cleaved by the human endoprotease TMPRSS2. Together with cooperative actions of other tissue specific endogenous proteases, proteolytic cleavage results in irreversible conformational changes of the S protein that eventually results in cell membrane fusion and endocytic host-cell uptake [8]. Although the viral S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share ~73% amino acid sequence identity, SARS-CoV-2 shows significantly enhanced transmission efficiency when compared to SARS-CoV [9,10]. Structural studies suggest that alterations at the furin cleavage site, located at the boundary between S1 and S2 subunits, may result in reduced stability of the S protein, which facilitates the conformational adaptation that is required for receptor binding [11]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 specific amino acid residues identified within the RBM were shown to enhance the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 as compared to SARS-CoV [12\u201314]. Since its first appearance in 2019, the virus has undergone numerous mutational events, resulting in variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced fitness regarding their transmissibility and disease severity [15,16]. A large proportion of these mutations cluster in the spike protein, influencing its binding affinity towards hACE2 [13,17\u201320]. To date, the most widespread mutants such as B.1.617.2 (\u03b4-variant), P.1 (\u03b3-variant) and B.1.1.529 (o-variant) have widely replaced the originally identified SARS-CoV-2 virus due to their enhanced fitness [21\u201325]. Interestingly, most of the circulating variants that have enhanced infectivity as compared to the ancestral strain carry a D614G substitution in the S1 domain of the spike protein. Several indications suggest that the mutation may be directly linked to the enhanced transmissibility [21,24]. Although mRNA-based vaccines in particular turned out as a successful strategy for controlling the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, vaccinations have already been shown to be partially less effective for certain VOCs [19,25]. The selection pressure created by different immunization strategies in combination with naturally occurring spontaneous mutations consequently leads to the enforcement of variants with increased immune evasive traits, making adaptation of vaccines as well as repetitive renewal of immunization mandatory. This situation, which resembles the status quo of the influenza virus [26], requires the development of antiviral medication, especially for cases where either no sufficient immunity is present or already existing immunity is circumvented by novel viral strains. Hence, various research efforts have either focused on the development of novel drug candidates for a causative treatment such as Paxlovid (Pfizer), repurposing approved compounds such as Molnupiravir (Merck), or even screening components from natural sources [27\u201333]. However, there are no generally proven effective antiviral treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study, we present a novel phage display based strategy for the development of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeting peptide ligands. The resulting lead compounds show high binding affinity for the RBD in the nanomolar scale and binding selectivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, as well as for the B.1.1.7 mutant (\u03b1-variant). Moreover,\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 3 of 23\nwhen analyzed in binding experiments with the isolated proteins, one of the selected peptide sequences reduced the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding towards the cellular receptor hACE2 when added before complex formation on one side, but was also able to displace the spike protein from the already formed complex. In addition, a first optimization of the most promising lead compound resulted in an even more efficient compound."

            "text": "In phage display, exogenous peptides are presented on phage particles as fusion constructs with coat proteins. Consecutive rounds of biopanning and amplification increase the fraction of phages presenting strong target binders, which can be identified by sequencing of the variable portion of the genome [34]. For biopanning, the commercially available M13-bacteriophage library TriCo-16 (Creative Biolabs, Shirley, USA) was used. The library had a capacity of 2.6 \u00d7 1010 pIII fused 16-mer peptide variants. The biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD target protein (positions 319 to 541) was purchased as lyophilized powder from Acrobiosystems (# QHD43416, USA) with a purity of >95%. The protein carries a C-terminal His-Tag for Ni-NTA purification followed by an Avitag sequence (SPD-C82E9, [35]) for BirA catalyzed transfer of biotin. The protein was expressed in HEK293 cells and had a Mw of 28.2 kDa with additional 5 to 8 kDa due to glycosylation. For surface immobilization, the target protein was incubated on a streptavidin-functionalized polystyrene 96-well plate (High capacity, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h at RT using 70 pmol/well of target protein in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 100 \u00b5M EDTA (selection buffer). Non-coupled streptavidin was quenched by 10 min incubation with 100 \u00b5L of 10 \u00b5M biotin. Subsequent surface blocking was performed for 1 h by incubation with either 1% (w/v) BSA or nonfat milk powder in selection buffer. For the first selection round, 10 \u00b5L of the phage library (6 \u00d7 1011 phages/well) was diluted in 90 \u00b5L selection buffer with 0.2% (w/v) BSA or milk powder and incubated for 20 min. The subsequent washing steps with 200 \u00b5L washing buffer (0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and either 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) or milk powder in selection buffer) were gradually increased from 5 to 15 repetitions with the number of selection rounds. Phage elution was performed using 10 min incubation with 100 \u00b5L of 0.2 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), followed by neutralization in 25 \u00b5L of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Eluted phages were amplified for 4.5 h in 20 mL of LB-cultured E. coli K12 ER2783 with a starting OD600 of 0.1. The pelleted cells were discarded after 20 min centrifugation at 5000\u00d7 g and the phages were precipitated by addition of 7 mL 20% (w/v) PEG-8000, 2.5 M NaCl followed by overnight (ON) incubation at 4 \u25e6C. Phages were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u25e6C and resuspended in 1 mL PBS (pH 7.4). After additional centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was mixed with 200 \u00b5L of 20% (w/v) PEG-8000, 2.5 M NaCl and incubated for 1 h at 4 \u25e6C. The phages were pelleted in a last purification step for 1 h at 5000 rpm and the pellet was suspended in 100 \u00b5L selection buffer. Phage concentration of the purified phages was determined by serial dilution of the phage suspension and incubation with E. coli K12 ER2783 on IPTG/X Gal-LB titer plates ON at 37 \u25e6C. The concentration of input phages was calculated based on the serial dilution and a concentration of 6 \u00d7 1012 phage forming units ml\u22121 (PFU) was used as the input for all selection rounds and controls. The selection was performed for three consecutive rounds on the target (target selection = TS). Additionally, input phages resulting from selection rounds on the target were applied to a parallel selection (direct control = DC) on a surface without target, which was otherwise treated identically to the TS surface. As a second control, a consecutive selection was performed exclusively without target on otherwise identically treated surfaces (empty selection = ES)."

            "text": "NGS sequencing of phage-isolated ssDNA yielded about 500,000 to 600,000 sequence reads per sample. In order to identify sequences that were enriched during phage display selection due to specific binding to the target protein, the TS3 sequences were filtered according to their enrichment on the target during the selection (lib < TS1, TS2 < TS3), their frequency in the target selection as compared to selections missing the target protein (TS1 > ES1, TS2 > ES2, TS3 > ES3), and the rel tive frequency decrease when a targetselection-derived sequence was subjected to a surface without target (TS2 > DC2, TS3 > DC3). In total, 90,000 unique sequences were identified that passed the filtering process. Analysis of the sequence enrichment (enrichment score [TS3/lib]) revealed that 18 unique sequences were enriched by a factor of 1000 or more. More than 50% of the total number of all sequence reads that passed the filter are represented by th se 18 varian s (Figure 2A). Additionally, 14 of the 18 sequences were identified with an ES of at least 1000 (empty score [TS3/ES3]), which underlines the target specificity of these sequences. Next, the sequences were clustered according to their sequence homology in three consecutive rounds of cluster alignment and extension using Hammock clustering software (37). Clustering resulted in 16 clusters containing 57,712 unique and 383,503 total sequences, where ~96% of total sequence reads that passed the filter were assigned to five main clusters. The clusters were named CVRBDL-1 to -5, corresponding to the descending order of their total number of assigned sequence reads. The largest proportion by far, with over 70% of total sequence reads, was assigned to CVRBDL-1, followed by 10, 7, 6 and 3% for CVRBDL-2 to -5 (Figure 2B). Based on the sequence alignments, motifs were generated for each of the main clusters (Figure 2C), revealing five highly conserved sequence motifs, including amino acid residue variations, which can be used for potential sequence optimization steps. The amino acid residues with the highest occurrence at each position determined the peptide sequence of the peptides together with three C-terminally introduced arginine for enhanced solubility and C-termi l am dation: CVRBDL-1: MLDEWGWENYPSKFWHRRR-NH2; CVRBDL-2: WTYMKDPLSYWGGYYRRRNH2; CVRBDL-3: HDFWWEYDKKNDTWTRRRR-NH2; CVRBDL-4: EVWGINFYPNRVPEKV RRR-NH2; CVRBDL-5: IGINQVAQPWWYNKSDRRR-NH2.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 8 of 23\nBiomedicines\u00a02022,\u00a010,\u00a0441\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0NGS\u00a0sequence\u00a0filtering\u00a0and\u00a0clustering\u00a0reveals\u00a0five\u00a0main\u00a0sequence\u00a0motifs.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Evaluation\u00a0\nof\u00a0the\u00a0enrichment\u00a0factors\u00a0(TS3/lib)\u00a0and\u00a0empty\u00a0scores\u00a0(TS3/ES3)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a01000\u00a0sequences\u00a0as\u00a0ranked\u00a0\nby\u00a0their\u00a0enrichment\u00a0factor\u00a0or\u00a0empty\u00a0score,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0Sequences\u00a0were\u00a0filtered\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0their\u00a0\nenrichment\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0target\u00a0(lib\u00a0>\u00a0TS1\u00a0>\u00a0TS2\u00a0>\u00a0TS3),\u00a0their\u00a0frequency\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0target\u00a0selection\u00a0as\u00a0compared\u00a0\nto\u00a0the\u00a0empty\u00a0selection\u00a0(TS1\u00a0>\u00a0ES1;\u00a0TS2\u00a0>\u00a0ES2;\u00a0TS3\u00a0>\u00a0ES3)\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0their\u00a0frequency\u00a0decrease\u00a0when\u00a0\nthe\u00a0target\u00a0selection\u00a0was\u00a0subjected\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0surface\u00a0without\u00a0target\u00a0(TS2\u00a0>\u00a0DC2;\u00a0TS3\u00a0>\u00a0DC3).\u00a0(B)\u00a0Cluster\u00a0\ndistribution\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0filtered\u00a0sequences\u00a0after\u00a0three\u00a0consecutive\u00a0rounds\u00a0of\u00a0cluster\u00a0extension\u00a0and\u00a0merg\u2010\ning.\u00a0The\u00a0pie\u00a0chart\u00a0depicts\u00a0the\u00a0total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0sequences\u00a0that\u00a0were\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0one\u00a0cluster\u00a0including\u00a0\nmultiple\u00a0occurrences\u00a0of\u00a0identical\u00a0sequences.\u00a0The\u00a0legend\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0unique\u00a0sequences\u00a0that\u00a0\nwere\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0cluster.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0main\u00a0sequence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0cluster,\u00a0the\u00a0specific\u00a0empty\u00a0\nscore\u00a0and\u00a0enrichment\u00a0 factor\u00a0 is\u00a0 listed.\u00a0 (C)\u00a0Conserved\u00a0cluster\u00a0motifs\u00a0resulting\u00a0 from\u00a0cluster\u00a0assign\u2010\nments\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0(B)\u00a0derived\u00a0by\u00a0Hammock\u00a0clustering\u00a0software.\u00a0\nNext,\u00a0the\u00a0sequences\u00a0were\u00a0clustered\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0their\u00a0sequence\u00a0homology\u00a0in\u00a0three\u00a0 consecutive\u00a0rounds\u00a0of\u00a0cluster\u00a0alignment\u00a0and\u00a0extension\u00a0using\u00a0Hammock\u00a0clustering\u00a0soft\u2010 ware\u00a0(37).\u00a0Clustering\u00a0resulted\u00a0 in\u00a016\u00a0clusters\u00a0containing\u00a057,712\u00a0unique\u00a0and\u00a0383,503\u00a0total\u00a0 sequences,\u00a0where\u00a0~96%\u00a0of\u00a0total\u00a0sequence\u00a0reads\u00a0that\u00a0passed\u00a0the\u00a0filter\u00a0were\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0five\u00a0 main\u00a0clusters.\u00a0The\u00a0clusters\u00a0were\u00a0named\u00a0CVRBDL\u20101\u00a0to\u00a0\u20105,\u00a0corresponding\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0descending\u00a0 order\u00a0of\u00a0their\u00a0total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0assigned\u00a0sequence\u00a0reads.\u00a0The\u00a0largest\u00a0proportion\u00a0by\u00a0far,\u00a0with\u00a0 over\u00a070%\u00a0of\u00a0total\u00a0sequence\u00a0reads,\u00a0was\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0CVRBDL\u20101,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a010,\u00a07,\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a03%\u00a0 for\u00a0CVRBDL\u20102\u00a0to\u00a0\u20105\u00a0(Figure\u00a02B).\u00a0Based\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0sequence\u00a0alignments,\u00a0motifs\u00a0were\u00a0generated\u00a0 for\u00a0each\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0main\u00a0clusters\u00a0(Figure\u00a02C),\u00a0revealing\u00a0five\u00a0highly\u00a0conserved\u00a0sequence\u00a0motifs,\u00a0 including\u00a0amino\u00a0acid\u00a0residue\u00a0variations,\u00a0which\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0potential\u00a0sequence\u00a0opti\u2010 mization\u00a0steps.\u00a0The\u00a0amino\u00a0acid\u00a0residues\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0highest\u00a0occurrence\u00a0at\u00a0each\u00a0position\u00a0de\u2010 termined\u00a0 the\u00a0peptide\u00a0 sequence\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0peptides\u00a0 together\u00a0with\u00a0 three\u00a0C\u2010terminally\u00a0 intro\u2010 duced\u00a0 arginines\u00a0 for\u00a0 enhanced\u00a0 solubility\u00a0 and\u00a0 C\u2010terminal\u00a0 amidation:\u00a0 CVRBDL\u20101:\u00a0 MLDEWGWENYPSKFWHRRR\u2010NH2;\u00a0 CVRBDL\u20102:\u00a0 WTYMKDPLSYWGGYYRRR\u2010NH2;\u00a0 CVRBDL\u20103:\u00a0 HDFWWEYDKKNDTWTRRRR\u2010NH2;\u00a0 CVRBDL\u20104:\u00a0 EVWGINFYP\u2010 NRVPEKVRRR\u2010NH2;\u00a0CVRBDL\u20105:\u00a0IGINQVAQPWWYNKSDRRR\u2010NH2.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0"

            "heading": "3.3. Affinity of CVRBDL Peptides towards the SARS-CoV-2 RBD",
            "text": "To verify whether the compounds showed affinity towards th sel ction target, the biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD, as already used for phage display selection, was immobilized on a streptavidin-derivatized sensor surface and the compounds CVRBDL-1 to -5 were injected as analytes in a multicycle SPR experiment, which was subsequently evaluated by steady-state analysis. All of the tested peptides showed affinity towards the immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the low \u00b5M range as determined by steady-state analysis. As typical for peptides interacting with a folded binding partner, a transient binding behavi r was detected for most of the compounds (Figure 3). However, the transient binding proportion CVRBDL-1 and -2 showed a partially slower complex d cay, which can be recogniz d by a non-monoexponential complex decay during the dissociation phase. This suggests that multiple binding sites for these peptides may exist, which would be a reasonable explanation for these sequences to be assigned as main sequences of the most prominent clusters as shown previously (Figure 2). Interestingly, the lowest affinity constant and therefore highest complex stability was identified for CVRDBL-3 with a KD of 1.3 \u00b5M, showing a ~70-fold higher affinity than the least stable interaction with CVRBDL-5.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 9 of 23\nBiomedicines\u00a02022,\u00a010,\u00a0441\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0 3.3.\u00a0Affinity\u00a0of\u00a0CVRBDL\u00a0Peptides\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD\u00a0 To\u00a0verify\u00a0whether\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0showed\u00a0affinity\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0selection\u00a0target,\u00a0the\u00a0 biotinylated\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD,\u00a0as\u00a0already\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0phage\u00a0display\u00a0selection,\u00a0was\u00a0immobi\u2010 lized\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0streptavidin\u2010derivatized\u00a0sensor\u00a0surface\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0CVRBDL\u20101\u00a0to\u00a0 \u20105\u00a0 were\u00a0injected\u00a0as\u00a0analytes\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0multicycle\u00a0SPR\u00a0experiment,\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0subsequently\u00a0evalu\u2010 ated\u00a0by\u00a0steady\u2010state\u00a0analysis.\u00a0\nAll\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 tested\u00a0peptides\u00a0 showed\u00a0 affinity\u00a0 towards\u00a0 the\u00a0 immobilized\u00a0 SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0 RBD\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0low\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0range\u00a0as\u00a0determined\u00a0by\u00a0steady\u2010state\u00a0analysis.\u00a0As\u00a0typical\u00a0for\u00a0peptides\u00a0 interacting\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0folded\u00a0binding\u00a0partner,\u00a0a\u00a0transient\u00a0binding\u00a0behavior\u00a0was\u00a0detected\u00a0for\u00a0 most\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0(Figure\u00a03).\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0transient\u00a0binding\u00a0proportion\u00a0CVRBDL\u2010 1\u00a0and\u00a0\u20102\u00a0showed\u00a0a\u00a0partially\u00a0slower\u00a0complex\u00a0decay,\u00a0which\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0recognized\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0non\u2010 mono\u2010exponential\u00a0complex\u00a0decay\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0dissociation\u00a0phase.\u00a0This\u00a0suggests\u00a0that\u00a0mul\u2010 tiple\u00a0binding\u00a0sites\u00a0for\u00a0these\u00a0peptides\u00a0may\u00a0exist,\u00a0which\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0reasonable\u00a0explanation\u00a0 for\u00a0these\u00a0sequences\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0assigned\u00a0as\u00a0main\u00a0sequences\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0prominent\u00a0clusters\u00a0as\u00a0 shown\u00a0previously\u00a0(Figure\u00a02).\u00a0Interestingly,\u00a0the\u00a0lowest\u00a0affinity\u00a0constant\u00a0and\u00a0therefore\u00a0high\u2010 est\u00a0complex\u00a0stability\u00a0was\u00a0identified\u00a0for\u00a0CVRDBL\u20103\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0KD\u00a0of\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM,\u00a0showing\u00a0a\u00a0~70\u2010 fold\u00a0higher\u00a0affinity\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0least\u00a0stable\u00a0interaction\u00a0with\u00a0CVRBDL\u20105.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0SPR\u00a0affinity\u00a0measurement\u00a0of\u00a0compounds\u00a0CVDRBDL\u20101\u00a0to\u00a0 \u20105\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0 immobilized\u00a0SARS\u2010\nCoV\u20102\u00a0RBD\u00a0selection\u00a0target.\u00a0The\u00a0C\u2010terminally\u00a0biotinylated\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD\u00a0was\u00a0immobilized\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0\nstreptavidin\u2010derivatized\u00a0sensor\u00a0surface\u00a0 in\u00a0a\u00a0T200\u00a0SPR\u00a0device\u00a0(SA,\u00a0Cytiva,\u00a0USA).\u00a0The\u00a0compounds\u00a0\nwere\u00a0injected\u00a0for\u00a0300\u00a0s\u00a0with\u00a030\u00a0\u03bcL/min\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a00.01\u00a0to\u00a011.11\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0mM\u00a0HEPES\u00a0(pH\u00a07.4),\u00a0150\u00a0\nmM\u00a0NaCl,\u00a03\u00a0mM\u00a0EDTA,\u00a00.005%\u00a0(v/v)\u00a0Tween\u201020.\u00a0Surface\u00a0regeneration\u00a0in\u00a0between\u00a0cycles\u00a0was\u00a0per\u2010\nformed\u00a0using\u00a030\u00a0s\u00a0injections\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0acidic\u00a0regeneration\u00a0cocktail\u00a0(pH\u00a05.0),\u00a0(0.15\u00a0M\u00a0oxalic\u00a0acid,\u00a00.15\u00a0M\u00a0\nH3PO4,\u00a00.15\u00a0M\u00a0formic\u00a0acid,\u00a00.15\u00a0M\u00a0malonic\u00a0acid).\u00a0The\u00a0KD\u00a0was\u00a0determined\u00a0by\u00a0steady\u00a0state\u00a0fit\u00a0as\u00a0fol\u2010\nlows:\u00a0CVRBDL\u20101:\u00a08.6\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM;\u00a0CVRBDL\u20102:\u00a04.2\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0\u03bcM;\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103:\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0\u03bcM;\u00a0\nCVRBDL\u20104:\u00a012.0\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.87\u00a0\u03bcM;\u00a0CVRBDL\u20105:\u00a089.4\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.0\u00a0\u03bcM.\u00a0KD\u00a0evaluation\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0using\u00a0\nthe\u00a0Biacore\u00a0T200\u00a0data\u00a0evaluation\u00a0software\u00a0v.\u00a03.2\u00a0with\u00a0offset\u00a0set\u00a0to\u00a0zero.\u00a0\nFurther, binding properties of the peptide CVRBDL-3 to the RBD domain were investigated by solution NMR spectroscopy. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence) spectra of an 0.85 mM RBD domain sample (unlabeled, natural abundance) were recorded using a Bruker AvanceNeo 1.2 GHz spectrometer (Figure 4), as described in the Material and Methods Section. Figure 4A shows the 1H-15N correlation spectrum of the RBD domain. Roughly, every resonance in the spectrum corresponds to one amino acid residue of the protein sequence, with the nitrogen resonance correlated to the proton resonance of the backbone amide group. Therefore, the HMQC spectrum serves as a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the protein. Because of the natural abundance of the 15N isotope of only 0.37%, the \u201cNMR active\u201d concentration of the 0.85 mM RBD sample corresponds to about 3 \u00b5M. Therefore, presumably only the most intense (most dynamic) residues of the RBD domain are visible in the spectra, while the more rigid regions stay below the detection threshold and thus remain invisible. Next, the CVRBDL-3 peptide was added to the RBD domain at a molar ratio of about 1.1:1 (peptide: RBD domain). The resulting spectrum showed decreased intensities for several resonances of the RBD domain (Figure 4B, red spectrum), compared to the reference spectrum of the unbound RBD (black). A possible explanation is that residues involved in the binding become more rigidified upon peptide interaction, leading to decreased intensities, as a result of faster transverse relaxation. A second reference spectrum of the peptide only was recorded (blue, Figure 4B). Interestingly, the resonances of the peptide\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 10 of 23\n(natural abundance, 1.1 higher concentration than the RBD domain) disappear in the spectra of the RBD plus peptide sample (Figure 4B, red spectrum), clearly indicating binding. Presumably, the peptide binds to the more rigid (invisible) region of the RBD and therefore becomes invisible as well (as it assumes the same NMR relaxation properties as the invisible part of the RBD).\nBiomedicines\u00a02022,\u00a010,\u00a0441\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0

            "text": "Phage display selection was co bi ed with NGS to id ntify peptides that t rget the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with medium to low \u00b5M affinities. To further verify whether the CVRBDL peptides are able to interfere with the association of the spike protein towards hACE2, SPR-based inhibition assays were performed. hACE-fc was immobilized on a protein A-derivatized sensor surface and the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 protein (ectodomain of the spike protein) was injected as an analyte together with or without a 100-fold molar excess of one of the CVRBDL peptides. Three out of five peptides (CVRBDL-2, -3 and -4) were able to interfere with association of the monomeric S1S2 spike protein to hACE2 in our experimental setup, which can be recognized by a reduction in the binding signal of the S1S2 protein to hACE2 in the steady-state phase upon compound addition (Figure 5A). Here, CVRBDL-3 showed the strongest inhibitory effect by a steady-state reduction of ~33% as compared to the setup without compound. CVRBDL-2 and -4 reduced the steady-state signal only by ~10 and 5%, respectively (Figure 5B). To verify whether the effect observed for CVRBDL-3 was concentration-dependent, compound concentrations in the range of 6.4 nM to 100 \u00b5M were applied to the inhibition setup. When CVRBDL-3 is applied with increasing molar ratios concerning the SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 protein, a concentration-dependent inhibition of the S1S2-hACE2 complex formation can be observed (Figure 6A). Surprisingly, the compound was not able to inhibit the complex formation completely, which can be attributed either to an insufficient sterical inhibition of the hACE2 accessibility or to an inherent heterogeneity of the S1S2-hACE2 complex. The latter has already been described by us previously [42], where we identified the S1S2-hACE2 complex formation as undergoing a two-state reaction binding behavior. In this context, the compound CVRBDL-3 is able to block the primary association of the RBD with hACE2 but possibly not the secondary state transition, which is inherent to the already formed complex.

            "text": "We compared the affinity of the single peptide CVRBDL-3 and the tail-to-tail combination CVRBDL-3_3 to the poly-His tagged spike protein constructs of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1S2 monomer and the S1S2 trimer using SPR analysis. SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1S2 monomer and S1S2 trimer were immobilized via primary amino group coupling on a polycarboxylate sensor surface and the compounds were injected in a multicycle experiment using concentrations in the range of 0.04 to 5 \u00b5M. The subsequent evaluation was performed by steady-state analysis (Figure 8). The interaction of CVRBDL-3 towards the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was identified to be ~twofold more affine than for the original biotinylated selection target (KD: 680 nM vs. 1.3 \u00b5M, respectively), whereas slightly higher affinities were determined for the S1S2 monomer and the trimeric S1S2 (KD: 400 and 406 nM, respectively). As already observed during affinity measurement on the selection target protein, CVRBDL-3 shows again a transient binding behavior for all of the tested spike protein constructs. Additionally, the identified Rmax was found to be lower than the theoretical Rmax for all measurements, which indicates a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Notably, the CVRDBL-3 binding is not influenced when the RBD is presented in the context of the monomeric and trimeric spike ectodomain. This implies that the interaction of CVRBDL-3 with the RBD binding epitope is not significantly disturbed by the RBD switch between \u201cup-\u201c and \u201cdown-\u201c conformations. CVRBDL-3_3 shows increased binding affinity as compared to the single peptide alone. The complex stability increased by a factor of ~2 towards the RBD (KD: 327 nM) and by a factor of ~2.5 towards the monomeric and trimeric S1S2 (KD: 162 and 154 nM, respectively). The binding kinetics changed for CVRBDL-3_3 as compared to CVRBDL-3 from a transient binding mode with fast dissociation to a more stable complex with partially slower dissociation. However, the kinetics cannot be described with a 1:1 stoichiometric Langmuir binding behavior, indicating a distinct binding mode. Moreover, the bivalent analyte model was not able to sufficiently describe the interaction\u2019s heterogeneity. A possible explanation could be that the aforementioned continuous position switching between \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 13 of 23\nconformations of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD does not influence the interaction with CVRBDL-3 on the one side, but potentially restricts the association of CVRBDL-3_3 on the other site. This interference possibly hinders the assignment of a clear kinetic model to the observed sensograms. However, since the binding kinetics of CVRBDL-3_3 appears almost identical for monomeric and trimeric S1S2, a simultaneous binding of two RBD located epitopes with an increased avidity seems implausible, leaving room for further optimization of the linker length.\nBiomedicines\u00a02022,\u00a010,\u00a0441\u00a0 13\u00a0 of\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0\n3.6.\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103_3\u00a0Shows\u00a0Increased\u00a0Affinity\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0CoV\u20102\u00a0Spike\u00a0Protein\u00a0Compared\u00a0with\u00a0 CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0\nWe\u00a0compared\u00a0the\u00a0affinity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0single\u00a0peptide\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0tail\u2010to\u2010tail\u00a0combi\u2010 nation\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103_3\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0poly\u2010His\u00a0tagged\u00a0spike\u00a0protein\u00a0constructs\u00a0of\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD,\u00a0 S1S2\u00a0monomer\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0S1S2\u00a0trimer\u00a0using\u00a0SPR\u00a0analysis.\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD,\u00a0S1S2\u00a0monomer\u00a0 and\u00a0S1S2\u00a0trimer\u00a0were\u00a0immobilized\u00a0via\u00a0primary\u00a0amino\u00a0group\u00a0coupling\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0polycarbox\u2010 ylate\u00a0sensor\u00a0surface\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0compounds\u00a0were\u00a0injected\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0multicycle\u00a0experiment\u00a0using\u00a0 concentrations\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a00.04\u00a0to\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcM.\u00a0The\u00a0subsequent\u00a0evaluation\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0by\u00a0 steady\u2010state\u00a0analysis\u00a0(Figure\u00a08).\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a08.\u00a0SPR\u00a0affinity\u00a0measurement\u00a0of\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0and\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0_3\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD,\u00a0S1S2\u00a0\nmonomer\u00a0and\u00a0trimeric\u00a0spike\u00a0constructs.\u00a0The\u00a0spike\u00a0constructs\u00a0were\u00a0immobilized\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0polycarbox\u2010\nylate\u00a0matrix\u00a0by\u00a0coupling\u00a0via\u00a0primary\u00a0amino\u00a0groups\u00a0with\u00a0sulfo\u2010NHS\u00a0ester\u00a0at\u00a0pH\u00a05.5\u00a0(200\u00a0HCM,\u00a0Xan\u2010\ntec,\u00a0GE).\u00a0Measurements\u00a0were\u00a0performed\u00a0in\u00a010\u00a0mM\u00a0HEPES\u00a0(pH\u00a07.4),\u00a0150\u00a0mM\u00a0NaCl,\u00a03\u00a0mM\u00a0EDTA,\u00a0\n0.005%\u00a0Tween\u201020\u00a0solution\u00a0 in\u00a0a\u00a0T200\u00a0device\u00a0(Cytiva,\u00a0USA).\u00a0Six\u00a0concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0compound\u00a0\nwere\u00a0 injected\u00a0 for\u00a0 60\u00a0 s\u00a0with\u00a0 a\u00a0 1:1\u00a0 serial\u00a0dilution,\u00a0with5\u00a0 \u03bcM\u00a0 being\u00a0 the\u00a0 highest\u00a0 concentration\u00a0 for\u00a0\nCVRBDL\u20103\u00a0and\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0for\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103_3.\u00a0KD\u00a0evaluation\u00a0was\u00a0performed\u00a0using\u00a0Biacore\u00a0T200\u00a0data\u00a0\nevaluation\u00a0software\u00a0v.\u00a03.2\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0offset\u00a0of\u00a0zero.\u00a0The\u00a0theoretical\u00a0Rmax\u00a0was\u00a0calculated\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0\nmolecular\u00a0weight\u00a0ratio\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0interactants\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0immobilization\u00a0level\u00a0after\u00a0quenching.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0 interaction\u00a0of\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0 towards\u00a0 the\u00a0SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0RBD\u00a0was\u00a0 identified\u00a0 to\u00a0be\u00a0 ~two\u2010fold\u00a0more\u00a0affine\u00a0than\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0original\u00a0biotinylated\u00a0selection\u00a0target\u00a0(KD:\u00a0680\u00a0nM\u00a0vs.\u00a0 1.3\u00a0 \u03bcM,\u00a0 respectively),\u00a0whereas\u00a0 slightly\u00a0higher\u00a0 affinities\u00a0were\u00a0determined\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 S1S2\u00a0 monomer\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0trimeric\u00a0S1S2\u00a0(KD:\u00a0400\u00a0and\u00a0406\u00a0nM,\u00a0respectively).\u00a0As\u00a0already\u00a0observed\u00a0 during\u00a0affinity\u00a0measurement\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0selection\u00a0 target\u00a0protein,\u00a0CVRBDL\u20103\u00a0shows\u00a0again\u00a0a\u00a0 transient\u00a0binding\u00a0behavior\u00a0for\u00a0all\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0tested\u00a0spike\u00a0protein\u00a0constructs.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0the\u00a0 identified\u00a0Rmax\u00a0was\u00a0found\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0lower\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0theoretical\u00a0Rmax\u00a0for\u00a0all\u00a0measurements,\u00a0which\u00a0 indicates\u00a0a\u00a01:1\u00a0binding\u00a0stoichiometry.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0the\u00a0CVRDBL\u20103\u00a0binding\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0influenced\u00a0"

            "text": "We have previously shown that the compounds CVRBDL-3 and -3_3 show high affinity with nM binding constants towards the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1S2 monomer and trimer. Here, we additionally verify whether the binding specificity of the compounds is limited to the \u201cwt\u201d of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or can also be extended to mutant versions, where some have been found to show enhanced affinity for the cellular receptor hACE2. Therefore, we analyzed the binding affinity of the compounds towards the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 S1S2 trimeric spike mutant (\u03b1-variant) as a model for other emerging variants of the spike protein. In total, seven amino acid sequence positions differ between SARS-CoV-2 \u201cwt\u201d spike protein and the B.1.1.7 variant, whereas four mutations are located at intermolecular interaction sites of the subunits and one mutation, namely N501Y, is found in the RBM of the RBD [43]. This amino acid residue substitution has been shown to increase the binding affinity for the hACE2, which may be one of the reasons for the observed four to\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 14 of 23\nsix-fold increase in transmissibility in cooperation with other mutations that do not directly interfere with receptor binding but enhance binding e.g., by increasing RBD flexibility such as D614G [44\u201346]. The affinity measurement on the trimeric B.1.1.7 (Figure 9) shows clearly that the binding affinity of neither CVRBDL-3 nor -3_3 is influenced by the mutation sites of the B.1.1.7 variant. Similar binding constants as already identified for the SARS-CoV-2 \u201cwt\u201d S1S2 spike protein were identified (528 and 243 nM for -3 and -3_3), whereas the binding kinetics shows a clear transient binding mode for CBRBDL-3 and higher complex stability with slower complex decay for CVRBDL-3_3. Since the SARS-CoV 2002 RBD shares 73% sequence identity and high structural similarity with the SARS-CoV-2 \u201cwt\u201d RBD [47], we speculated that the compounds are also able to bind the COVID 2002 trimeric spike protein with high affinity.

-3_ do not have any affinity for this construct (both KD\u2019s in high mM range). Next, we verified the binding affinity to ards t l - - tri er [48]. For construct design, the spike protein was manipulated by the replacement of amino acid residues at positions 383 and 985 with cysteines in order to form a disulfide bond that fixes the RBD in its \u201cdown\u201d position. Hence, the relevant positions for interaction with hACE2 are masked in this construct. When the compounds\u2019 affinities were determined for this RBD \u201cdown\u201d fixed S1S2 construct, significantly decreased affinities were observed. Additionally, the experimental Rmax reached only 32 and 24% of the theoretical Rmax for CVRBDL-3 and -3_3, respectively.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 15 of 23"

            "text": "The tail-to-tail combination of the two CVRBDL-3 peptides achieved (CVRBDL-3_3) increased binding affinities and decreased dissociation rates for the different SARS-CoV-2 constructs. Moreover, CVRBDL-3_3 retained its target specificity and the high binding affinity towards the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 mutant spike protein. Here, we compared CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3 concerning their ability to (i) inhibit complex formation of the SARSCoV-2 S1S2 monomer with hACE2 and (ii) displace the spike protein from the pre-formed complex, consisting of the S1S2 monomer and hACE2. Two experimental setups allowed a complete evaluation of the compound\u2019s effectiveness in either pre- or post-complex formation conditions. We injected constant concentrations of the monomeric S1S2 spike protein with or without increasing CVRBDL-3_3 concentrations on the immobilized hACE2 receptor. As already observed for CVRBDL-3, CVRBDL-3_3 also shows a concentration-dependent reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 association towards hACE2 (Figure 10A). Interestingly, the inhibition saturates at 58% of the binding level without compound, which is identical with the saturation level that was previously identified for CVRBDL-3. Evaluation of the IC50 (Figure 10B) shows that the inhibition efficiency of complex formation increased by a factor of ~11 as compared to CVRBDL-3 (532 nM as compared to 47 nM for CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3, respectively).

Interest ngly, the inhibition satura es at 58% of the binding level without compound, hich is identical with the saturation l el that was previously identified for CVRBDL-3. Evaluation of the IC50 (Figure 10B) shows that the inhibition efficiency of complex formation increased by a factor of ~11 as compared to CVRBDL-3 (532 nM as compared to 47 nM for CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3, respectively).\nFigure 10. CVRBDL-3_3 much more efficiently inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 spike protein interaction with hACE2 as compared to CVRBDL-3. (A) hACE2-fc was immobilized on a Protein A/G- derivatized sensor surface in a T200 SPR device (Cytiva, USA). 50 nM SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 was injected with or without 6.4 nM to 100 \u00b5M CVRBDL-3_3. Injections without compound were performed prior and after the concentration row to verify reproducibility of the S1S2 binding level. All injections with compound and spike protein were referenced with the corresponding concentration of compound only injections on the hACE2 immobilized surface. Injections were performed with 30 \u00b5L/min in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20. (B) Relative response in steady state as detected 270 s after injection start (for CVRBDL-3 see Figure 6). The inhibitory effect of CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3 saturates at ~58% of the S1S2 binding level without compound. The IC50 was determined by Boltzman sigmoidal fit to be 532 nM (OriginPro, OriginLab, USA).\nNext, we analyzed the effectiveness of CVRBDL-3 and -3_3 in displacing SARS-CoV-\n2 S1S2 monomers from the pre-formed complex with hACE2. For this assay, a constant\nconcentration of monomeric S1S2 was injected on pre-immobilized hACE2 for all injection\ncycles. During dissociation, increasing concentrations of the compounds were applied to\nthe pre-formed complex.\nThe sensogram course during compound injection indicates whether the compound\npresence accelerates the complex decay by shifting the equilibrium between hACE2\nbound and unbound spike protein to the dissociated form (Figure 11A,B). For both\ncompounds, the effect of spike protein displacement was observed by a concentration-\ndependent acceleration of signal reduction during the compound injection phase. When\nthe remaining signal at t = 1050 s was plotted against the injected compound\nconcentration, the concentration dependent effect is best described with a mono-\nexponential decay function (Figure 11C). Here, again CVRBDL-3_3 shows an enhanced\neffect as compared to CVRBDL-3. Although the concentration needed for reaching 50% of\nthe maximum displacement just slightly differs between the two compounds (DC50: 510\nand 417 nM for CVRBDL-3 and 3_3, respectively), the maximum displacement of\nCVRBDL-3_3 surpasses the one observed for CVRBDL-3 by a factor of 1.6 (y0: 84 and 74%\nfor CVRBDL-3 and 3_3, respectively).\nFigure 10.

            "text": "In the present study, we used phage display selection in combination with a unique and very efficient NGS-based data analysis strategy to identify ligands for the SARSCoV-2 RBD. Filtering and clustering of the NGS-derived sequences using positive and negative control samples led to the identification of highly conserved cluster motifs that cover 96% of all sequences passing the analysis filter criteria and are represented by five disti ct main seque ces (Figures 1 and 2). Further affinity analysis showed all selected pepti es bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD selectio target with affinities in the low \u00b5M range,\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 17 of 23\nwhere the highest affinity was identified for sequence CVRBDL-3 with a KD of 1.3 \u00b5M (Figure 3). The existence of a specific interaction between CVRBDL-3 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD was further verified by 2D-NMR using 1H-15N natural abundance correlation of the RBD (Figure 5). Here, CVRBDL-3 selectively reduced side chain resonances of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD when added at equimolar concentrations. In addition, natural resonances of the peptide were invisible when the RBD was present, suggesting a high affinity interaction between RBD and CVRBDL-3. Further analysis in an SPR-based experiment using the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 spike and hACE2 proteins demonstrated that CVRBDL-3 inhibits the complex formation when it is injected together with the monomeric S1S2 spike protein on the immobilized hACE2 (Figure 5). CVRBDL-3 also displaced hACE2 from the spike protein when the complex was already preformed (Figure 11). These two experimental SPR set-ups resemble physiological conditions where the virus has either not attached to the cell surface or the spike protein is already attached to the cellular receptor. A potent inhibitor targeting fusion inhibition can be expected to interfere with pre- as well as post-complex formation states. Because CVRBDL-3 is efficient in both, the targeted binding site of CVRBDL-3 on the RBD surface appears to be critical for its complex formation with hACE2 and remains at least partially accessible for CVRBDL-3 once the complex with hACE2 has been formed. The divalent version of CVRBDL-3, CVRBDL-3_3, had a two- to three-fold higher affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD, S1S2 monomer, S1S2 trimer) as compared to CVRBDL-3. The dissociation rates for the interaction of CVRBDL-3_3 with monomeric and trimeric S1S2 were substantially decreased for CVRBDL-3_3. Because there was no difference between the KD values of CVRBDL-3_3 and monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 spike protein (Figure 8), we conclude that the designed divalent binding mode was realized, but the increased affinity is much more likely due to the increased local concentration of the CVRBDL-3 moiety leading to decreased dissociation rates due to enhanced rebinding effects [49]. This leaves room for much more enhanced affinities by optimizing the linker length within CVRBDL-3_3 in the future. Nevertheless, CVRBDL-3_3 demonstrated increased binding affinity as compared to CVRBDL-3 in pre- as well as in post-complex formation conditions (Figures 10 and 11). To further verify the binding specificity of CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3, we tested their affinity towards the trimeric spike protein constructs of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, SARS-CoV (2002) and a \u201cclosed\u201d SARS-CoV-2 spike, for which the RBD was fixed in a \u201cdown\u201d position. CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3 bind the B.1.1.7 mutant spike protein as efficiently as the \u201cwt\u201d spike trimer. This finding supports the idea that inhibitory binding sites do not necessarily overlap with the typical VOC mutational sites and thus future emerging variants may still be vulnerable to the compounds. On the other hand, the spike protein of the \u201cold\u201d SARS-CoV virus from the year 2002 did not show efficient binding by CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3. This result indicates that the binding site and the observed inhibitory effect of CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3 is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and probably not interchangeable with other SARS coronaviruses. The binding affinity, as well as the fraction of the theoretical Rmax that is achieved towards the \u201cclosed\u201d RBD trimeric CoV-2 constructs, is substantially decreased compared to the non-manipulated \u201cwt\u201d version. This result points to a decisive role of the inaccessible regions in the \u201cclosed\u201d trimer for interaction with the compounds. In conclusion, affinity measurements clearly show that the CVRBDL-3 and CVRBDL-3_3 compounds target a binding site of the RBD that (i) is specific to SARS-CoV-2, (ii) is conserved in a mutant version, (iii) shows reduced accessibility in the \u201cclosed\u201d conformation, and finally (iv) is critical for the interaction with hACE2. Phage display is an appropriate strategy for the identification of potent SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors. This concept is not limited to coronaviruses only, but is transferable to other viruses, opening an option for a general and straightforward identification of drug compounds against novel emerging VOCs. The presented compound selection strategy yields small peptide compounds that are not template-protein-derived and thus are less likely prone to exhibit\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 441 18 of 23\nundesired side effects under physiological conditions. This can, for example, be expected for hACE2-template-based peptides [50,51]. The expected poor bioavailability of such L-enantiomeric peptide therapeutics may be overcome by their conversion into D-enantiomeric derivatives, for example by \u201cretro-inverso\u201d strategies [52] that endow all-D-enantiomeric peptide compounds with enhanced proteolytic stability [53] but conserve binding specificity and affinity. After optimization of proteolytic stability and binding affinity, future studies will first address testing of the optimized compounds in viral proliferation assays to ensure transferability of the observed effects to the cellular level.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceived and designed the project outline: M.S.
