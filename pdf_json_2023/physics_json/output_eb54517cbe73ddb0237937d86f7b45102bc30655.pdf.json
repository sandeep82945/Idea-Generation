    "abstractText": "At present, phenolic acid derivatives and triazole derivatives have a good antifungal effect, which has attracted widespread attention. A series of novel phenolic acid triazole derivatives were synthesized, and their structures were characterized by IR, MS, NMR, and X-ray crystal diffraction. Compound methyl 4-(2-bromoethoxy)benzoate, methyl 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1yl) ethoxy)benzoate, 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethoxy)benzoic acid and 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethoxy)-3-methoxybenzoic acid crystallize in the monoclinic system with space group P21/n, the monoclinic system with space group P21, the monoclinic system with space group P21 and the orthorhombic system with space group Pca21, respectively. At a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL and 200 \u03bcg/mL, the antifungal activity against seven plant pathogen fungi was determined. Compound methyl 4-(2-bromoethoxy)benzoate has the best inhibitory effect on Rhizoctonia solani AG1, and the inhibitory rate reached 88.6% at 200 \u03bcg/mL. The inhibitory rates of compound methyl 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4triazol-1-yl) ethoxy)benzoate against Fusarium moniliforme and Sphaeropsis sapinea at a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/mL were 76.1% and 75.4%, respectively, which were better than that of carbendazim.",

The use of fungicides is the main control measure of agricultural crop diseases and has made great contributions to improving crop yields and quality benefit [2]. However, long-term use of existing traditional fungicides has caused environmental pollution, pesticide residue toxicity, and drug resistance to plant fungal diseases [3]. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop new and promising plantprotection antibacterial agents. A large number of derivatives can be obtained by structural modification of natural products with certain antibacterial activities. It is possible to screen antibacterial functional factors with high activity and little or no side effect, and it is a promising way to develop pesticides and fungicides. Phenolic acids are substances containing polyphenol hydroxyl groups, including chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid, which are widely found in natural plants [4,5]. It has pharmacological effects such as anti-oxidative stress [6], improvement of microcirculation [7], improvement of cell energy metabolism [8], etc., and can fully protect the cranial nerves and significantly improve the quality of life of patients with cerebral infarction. Widely used in ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, it has anti-free-radicals and anti-tumor effects [9,10]. Phenolic acid also has a good antibacterial effect [11,12].

A triazole is a five-membered heterocyclic compound containing three nitrogen atoms. Triazole compounds, as an important part of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, are widely used because of their unique structural characteristics. Triazole compounds have unique biological activity, low toxicity and strong systemic properties. They are often used as structural units of drugs and pesticides, and they play an important role in their synthesis [13,14]. Triazole derivatives have anti-corrosion, antibacterial [15], weeding [16], antivirus [17], anti-influenza [18], anti-cancer [19,20] and anti-oxidation characteristics [21]. Among them, triazole derivatives have a long history of application in sterilization and are an important class of fungicides. Triazole fungicides can be regarded as five-membered heterocyclic derivatives and the structures and positions of the connected atomic groups are different, which leads many triazole fungicides to have different functions (Figure 1) [22\u201324]. Most triazole pesticides are derivatives of a triazole ring substituted by alkyl or aralkyl.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13\nwith cerebral infarction.

Most triazole pesticides are derivatives of a triaz le ring substituted y alkyl or aralkyl.\nIt is known that the combination of two active groups can enhance its activity. For example, Li and Wu, who combined triazoles with pyrimidine, both obtained compounds with good antibacterial activity [25]. Slivka et al. synthesized several compounds with triazole, thiazole and phenol substituents and their copper complexes, and the synthesized compounds had good fungicidal activity [26]. We found that most triazole pesticides are derivatives in which the nitrogen atom of the triazole ring is substituted by alkyl or aralkyl. Because alkylating reagents can easily react with the nitrogen atoms of heterocyclic rings and phenolic hydroxyl groups of phenolic acid, it is very convenient and reasonable to connect triazole rings with phenolic fragments with alkyl chains. We have been committed to the synthesis of and antifungal activity research into natural product derivatives and their complexes, and we have reported a series of crystal structures and biological activity [27,28]. It is found that triazole pesticides have a good inhibitory effect on common crop pathogenic fungi. Therefore, we used 1,2-dibromoethane to introduce 1,2,4- triazole into the phenolic hydroxyl of hydroxybenzoate and used vanillic acid and syringic acid to synthesize a series of phenolic acid triazole derivatives, and we studied their\ni r . tr t r l f r l s f s l t tri l f i i s.\n. l , i , i t i l it i i i , t t i\nit a ti t ri l acti it [25]. li t al. s t si s r l s it triaz le, thiazole and phenol substituents and their copper complexes, and the synthesized compounds ha goo fungicidal activity [26].

Compound 2a has a very good inhibitory effect on Fusarium moniliforme and Sphaeropsis sapinea, even better than that of carbendazim. Compared with triazole fungicides such as triadimefon and phenoxymethoxazole, compound 2a has a simple structure and is easy to modify. We will also try to modify 2a in the future, possibly by introducing halogen or modifying the methyl ester into an amide structure."

Reaction was monitored by TLC. After the reaction was completed, the pH of the obtained solution was adjusted to 5\u20136 with diluted hydrochloric acid. A large amount of white solids was precipitated, filtered and dried, and the products 3a\u20133c were obtained. The crystals were obtained after one week of slow volatilization at room temperature.

We used Carbendazim as a bactericide comparison. The preparation of the test sample: 20 mg of the test sample was dissolved in 1 mL of acetone, then the solution was transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask, with 0.1% tween-80 aqueous solution used for constant volume. The prepared solution was poured into 90 mL (50~55 \u25e6C) potato glucose agar (PDA) medium, mixed evenly, and then quickly poured into 6 Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter) to detect 2 kinds of fungus. At the same time, a blank control group (0.1% tween-80 aqueous solution) without drugs was set up. Inoculation of pathogenic fungus: the fungus was cut from the edge of the colony with a sterile drill (5 mm) and was inoculated in the center of the dish containing the medicine with an inoculation stick. Then, the Petri dishes were cultured in an illumination incubator (28 \u25e6C) for 5\u20137 days. When the hyphae of the fungi in blank control group grew to 7\u20138 cm, all experimental data of the fungi were recorded. The diameter of the mycelium was measured using the cross method. Each antifungal test was repeated separately three times. The inhibition ratio I (%) was calculated by the following formula, in which C represents the diameter of control group (untreated with compound) and T represents the diameter of treated group [36]:\nI(%) = (C \u2212 T) (C \u2212 0.5) \u00d7 100.

The structures of all the target compounds were characterized by IR, MS and NMR. Single crystals were cultured with synthetic compounds, and compound methyl 4-(2-bromoethoxy) benzoate, methyl 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethoxy) benzoate, 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethoxy)benzoic acid and 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethoxy)-3-methoxybenzoic acid were cultured with X-ray crystal. The potential antifungal activity against seven plant pathogens at 100 \u00b5g/mL and 200 \u00b5g/mL were tested. Research has shown that the compounds have antifungal activity against plant pathogens. Compound methyl 4-(2-bromoethoxy) benzoate has a good inhibitory effect on the tested fungi. Among them, compound methyl 4-(2-bromoethoxy) benzoate has the highest inhibitory rate against Rhizoctonia solani AG1, which reaches 88.6% at 200 \u00b5g/mL. The inhibitory rates of compound methyl 4-(2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethoxy)benzoate against Fusarium moniliforme and Sphaeropsis sapinea at 200 \u00b5g/mL were 76.1% and 75.4%, respectively, which were superior to those of carbendazim.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28196970/s1, Table S1: Crystal and structure refinement data of 1a\u20133a and 3b; Table S2: Selected bond lengths (\u00c5) and bond angles (\u25e6) of 1a\u20133a and 3b.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft, P.-L.X.; data curation, X.-Y.S.; investigation, X.-Y.S.; methodology, X.-T.X.; supervision, D.-Y.P.; supervision, X.-L.N.
