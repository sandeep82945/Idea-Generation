    "abstractText": "In recent years, the \u201cfinancial-like\u201d behavior of non-financial enterprises has contributed to the \u201coff real to virtual,\u201d which has seriously restricted the virtuous cycle of finance and economy. This study selects non-financial enterprises listed on Chinese A-shares from 2008 to 2019 as the research sample, and empirically analyzes the impact of CEOs\u2019 financial background (FB) on the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises and its mechanism. The results show that: (1) CEOs\u2019 FB has a positive effect on shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises; among which, the positive effect generated by non-banking FB is stronger. The conclusions still hold after robustness tests by replacing the measurement of variables, controlling for other shocks, changing the parameter estimation method, and considering the endogeneity problem. (2) The mechanism analysis reveals the positive effect mainly by reducing the level of entity investment by enterprises. (3) The heterogeneity analysis finds that, on the one hand, with respect to the internal micro characteristics of enterprises, the positive effect is more significant in state-owned enterprises, non-manufacturing enterprises, and non-growth stage enterprises. On the other hand, with respect to the external macro environment, the positive effect is more significant in periods of easy monetary policy, in industries with a higher competition or in regions with a better institutional environment. This study reveals the intrinsic mechanism of CEOs\u2019 FB and non-financial enterprises\u2019 shadow banking business, enriches the study of the influencing factors of non-financial enterprises\u2019 shadow banking business, and provides micro-level empirical support to alleviate the \u201coff real to virtual\u201d of the economy.",

The results show that: (1) CEOs\u2019 FB has a positive effect on shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises; among which, the positive effect generated by non-banking FB is stronger.

Increasingly, non-financial enterprises are devoting their resources to shadow banking business, including entrusted loans at higher costs, exacerbating corporate governance problems. Shadow banking, which plays the role of \u201cbank-like,\u201d is a variety of financial intermediary businesses outside the conventional banking system (Acharya et al., 2013). Shadow banking usually relies on non-bank financial institutions as carriers to convert risk factors such as credit, liquidity, and maturity of financial assets (Guo and Xia, 2014). As it turns out, shadow banking has existed\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\nin China for some time. It has been part of China\u2019s financial system since the 1980s (Allen and Gu, 2020; Zhu, 2021). By the end of 2019, the scale of broad shadow banking in China was RMB 84.80 trillion, while that in the narrow sense was RMB 39.14 trillion.1 There is a hidden debt network and guarantee system in shadow banking. The continued convergence of systemic risks in the financial market may accelerate the spread of financial risks. Suppose there is a substantial impairment of financial assets or the bursting of bubbles. In that case, enterprises will fall into a serious financial dilemma, increasing in non-performing loans and corporate defaults, and destabilizing the stability of the traditional financial system and the real economy (Liang, 2016; Jiang and Fang, 2021). Governments have become increasingly concerned with shadow banking governance as one of the most important ways to prevent systemic financial risks.\nShadow banking has attracted the attention of practical and theoretical circles due to its rapid expansion. The majority of existing studies on shadow banking have focused on the offbalance sheet business of commercial banks, the channel business of banks, securities and insurance, and various quasi-financial institutions, etc. There has been little attention paid to the lending behavior of the enterprise sector in emerging markets and transition economies (Du J. L. et al., 2017; Rapih, 2021). The re-lending of the enterprise sector is usually found in emerging markets and transitional economies where financial development is low and the financial system has not yet been developed (Wang et al., 2015; Han et al., 2019). Along with the growing gap between financial and real yields, the corporate sector has a growing tendency to engage in shadow banking business. Figure 1 shows the trend of shadow banking business of sample enterprises from 2008 to 2019, which is in line with the trend of shadow banking development in China. Since the financial crisis in 2008, the growth rate of shadow banking slowed down; from 2011 to 2016, shadow banking entered a rapid growth phase; since the beginning of 2017, the financial management department has focused on rectifying the chaos of shadow banking, and the scale of shadow banking dropped significantly from the historical high. The growth rate declined significantly after 2018. Although there have been more studies on the shadow banking system and financialization of enterprises, there are still relatively few studies on the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises. The academic has explored shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises based on different research perspectives. For example, identification of shadow banking activities (Wang et al., 2015), social welfare loss (Liu et al., 2014), business and operating risks (Li and Han, 2019), systemic risk (Allen et al., 2019), stock price crash risk (Si et al., 2021), business performance (Han et al., 2019), etc.\nTo discuss the long-term mechanism of shadow banking governance, we need to focus on its root. According to the Upper Echelons Theory, executives\u2019 different traits and experiences impact business management and strategic decisions (Dearborn and Simon, 1958; Hambrick, 2007; Mun et al., 2020). In addition, the human capital theory suggests that the knowledge and\n1The data come from the \u201cChina\u2019s Shadow Banking Report\u201d released by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.\ncompetencies possessed by managers can be significant factors of organizational performance (Amit and Shoemaker, 1993; Coff, 2002). Thus, as the maker and executor of corporate decisions, the CEO\u2019s characteristics will play a crucial role in the decision-making of enterprises shadow banking business. Thus, it would be invaluable to examine the influence factors of shadow banking business in non-financial enterprises by analyzing the background characteristics of CEOs. However, little literature has focused on the influencing factors of non-financial enterprises engaged in shadow banking business, especially the impact of the background characteristics of those managers who play a leading role in shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises. Based on the research on the background characteristics of managers, few studies directly explore the relationship between CEOs\u2019 financial backgrounds (FBs) and their classification and the shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises. The imprinting theory holds that executives\u2019 growth, learning, and work experiences during sensitive periods may produce a psychological imprint that has a lasting cognitive and competence effect on their careers (Mathias et al., 2015). Given the unique operation mode and the highly stressful environment of the financial industry, CEOs\u2019 time in this industry becomes a \u201csensitive period\u201d (Du et al., 2019). Therefore, the experience of working in the financial industry leaves CEOs with a deeper memory and habit, which will have a significant impact on their career behavior. Our study assumed that the CEO had FBs if they had worked in regulatory agencies, policy banks, or other financial institutions. Then, do the FBs of the CEO and their classification affect the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises? And what will be the impact? How do CEOs with FBs affect the shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises? And what is the mechanism of the influence between the two? China is currently undergoing a critical period of economic transformation. Thinking on the above issues is helpful to clarify the influencing factors of shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises from the perspective of managerial behavior, restrain the tendency of shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises from the root, promote China\u2019s future economic system reform, and achieve high-quality economic development.\nOur study makes the following potential contribution. First, it explores the relationship between \u201cCEOs\u2019 FBs and shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises,\u201d which extends the study of the influencing factors of non-financial enterprises\u2019 shadow banking business, and enriches the study of the impact of CEOs\u2019 FBs and their classification on the real economy. In this way, the factors that influence shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises in emerging markets can be clarified. This can also provide a reference for better regulating the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises and promoting high-quality economic and financial development. Second, we examined the heterogeneity of the impact from the internal micro characteristics and the external macro environment of enterprises. We are committed to analyzing whether the impact is different for non-financial enterprises with different equity, industry, and life cycles. Moreover, we are committed to analyzing whether the impact differs for non-financial enterprises\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\nin monetary policy periods, industry competition levels, and institutional environments. Third, using the mediating effect model constructed by Wen and Ye (2014), we identified the path between CEOs\u2019 FBs and non-financial enterprises\u2019 shadow banking business based on \u201coverconfidence and the entity investment level,\u201d and revealed the influencing mechanisms and deeper logical relationship.\nThe main structure is organized as follows: section \u201cLiterature Review and Hypothesis Development\u201d reviews the literature and presents the development of the hypothesis, section \u201cResearch Design\u201d describes the research design, section \u201cEmpirical Results and Analysis\u201d presents the empirical results and analysis, section \u201cMechanism Analysis\u201d performs mechanism analysis, section \u201cExtended Analysis\u201d conducts the extended analysis, and section \u201cConclusion and Implications\u201d discusses the conclusion and implications."

            "text": "Shadow banking in China is dominated by banks. It is primarily made up of commercial banks and non-banking institutions with close ties to banks. Its uniqueness is primarily manifested in financial products, bank-trust cooperation, private finance, etc. The emergence of shadow banking evades the need for various loan restrictions imposed by the central government on banks. It is a disguised loan and the shadow of banks. The participants of shadow banking are usually non-bank financial institutions that stray outside the boundaries of financial regulation (Acharya et al., 2013). In addition, China\u2019s financial repression, underdeveloped financial capital markets, and the\nlack of supervision of shadow financial activities have led nonfinancial enterprises to invest in the credit market and engage in the shadow banking business with high risk and high interest rates. Non-financial enterprises have become participants in shadow banking activities (Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). The upper echelon theory suggests that managers will have a significant impact on the strategic behavior of the organization, and that the personal characteristics of managers will have an impact on the organization\u2019s results (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). In previous studies, managerial characteristics have been demonstrated to have a significant impact on enterprises\u2019 financial decisions (Gore et al., 2011; Malmendier et al., 2011). Managers with FBs have a strong financial consulting function, which will affect enterprises\u2019 financial decisions (Gore et al., 2011; Malmendier et al., 2011). As an important financial decision, non-financial enterprises engaged in shadow banking business will inevitably be affected by the FBs of managers.\nOn the one hand, non-financial enterprises evade regulation through non-traditional financing channels, convert maturity and liquidity, and create many non-monetary financial assets (Gennaioli et al., 2013). Shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises will inevitably exacerbate the trend of industrial hollowing out, and strengthen the cross-contagion effect between enterprise sectors and between enterprise sectors and financial markets. The existence of shadow banking will increase in systemic risk (Liang, 2016; Fan and Pan, 2020; Pan and Fan, 2020). CEOs who have worked in financial institutions are more financially sophisticated (Custodio and Metzger, 2014) and can endure greater investment risks, navigate more complex investment environments, and manage more diverse investment projects. In addition, CEOs with FBs may perceive and manage financial investment risks, process and react\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\nto financial-related information, and identify and select financial investment opportunities more effectively than CEOs without FBs (Du et al., 2019; Cheng and Wu, 2022). Compared with CEOs without FBs, CEOs with FBs are more likely to be better at identifying, coping with, and taking risks, and more daring in participating in shadow banking business, and, thus, their enterprises have a higher degree of shadow banking.\nOn the other hand, non-financial enterprises have an extremely good reason to get involved with and expand shadow banking businesses because of financing constraints (Chen et al., 2001). The credit regulatory policies adopted in China seriously restrict the ability of enterprises to obtain capital in the existing capital market, and restrict commercial banks from providing credit to certain types of enterprises (Song et al., 2011). CEOs with FBs have richer financial resources than CEOs without FBs. According to the theory of social capital, they can use their financial \u201ccircles\u201d and \u201cguanxi\u201d to provide invisible guarantees for their firms, build access to financial resources (Guner et al., 2008), and integrate more funds from capital markets and financial intermediaries. Signal theory suggests that the FB of the CEO might convey credit advantage signals upstream and downstream in the supply chain (Zhang and Wiersema, 2009; Bernile et al., 2018). Companies with CEOs with FBs can also be suitable lenders upstream and downstream of the supply chain, which participates in the shadow credit market by acting as a bank that provides funding to firms with financial difficulties.\nIn addition, managers will focus more on achieving higher short-term performance to make profits. Shadow banking business may bring more short-term profits, conducive to managers dealing with short-term assessment pressure (Sen and Dasgupta, 2018). Deng et al. (2021) studied that compensation deferral policy induced CEOs to engage more in shadow banking business to avoid regulating balance sheet risks and improve performance. CEOs with FBs possess financial expertise and a background in the financial industry, which gives them an advantage in financial investment (Francis et al., 2015). Nonfinancial enterprises may find that shadow banking business provides a higher return on investment than real economy investments when faced with a low return on real investment and a lack of real investment opportunities (Tori and Onaran, 2018). Due to the pressures of performance assessment and selfworth realization, CEOs with FBs are more inclined to utilize their advantage and allocate the firm\u2019s resources to financial investments while reducing industrial investments (Liu et al., 2020). If properly positioned, this type of investment can generate excellent short-term profits for the organization.\nTherefore, the enterprises whose CEOs have FBs have a higher degree of shadow banking business. Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH1: Enterprises with CEOs with FBs are more likely to engage in the shadow banking business, that is, the larger their shadow banking business is.\nThe upper echelons theory states that individuals or teams can only gather limited information due to objective realities. Even if they work with the same information, different managers\nwill make different judgments based on their heterogeneous experiences, values, and cognition, and then make differentiated strategic decisions (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). However, there are differences between different financial institutions regarding their business scope, rules, risk management, resource attributes, and other characteristics, which create a differentiated environment (Du et al., 2019; Cheng and Wu, 2022). Therefore, CEOs from different financial institutions have differing characteristics, which will affect their decision-making processes.\nCEOs with previous experience in non-bank financial institutions exhibit a risk-taking style that leads to their engagement in shadow banking activities. Upper echelons theory states that managers\u2019 experiences influence their decisions and preferences (Hambrick and Mason, 1984). Generally, traditional banks, which are primarily engaged in lending and settlement, have stable sources of funds. They have a relatively homogeneous business and low risks. Non-bank financial institutions have more types of business, a more complex working environment and higher risks (Du et al., 2019). As most of the collective investment in shadow banking business is financial innovation tools, such as structuring and asset securitization with high risks, it is generally faced with run-and-fire sale losses (Hanson et al., 2015). Moreover, the maturity mismatch characteristic of structured investment, which is unique to shadow banking, will trigger its inherent instability and aggravate the evolution of risks (Hanson et al., 2015). CEOs who worked for non-bank financial institutions had a higher risk appetite, resulting in a riskier investment strategy (Hertwig et al., 2004; Du et al., 2019). Therefore, compared with CEOs with banking backgrounds, CEOs with non-banking FBs are considered to have higher risk preferences and are more likely to engage in shadow banking business. Our hypothesis is, thus, as follows:\nH2a: Enterprises with CEOs with non-banking FBs are more likely to engage in the shadow banking business, that is, the larger their shadow banking business is.\nCEOs\u2019 experience in banks enables them to exploit their advantages in resource acquisition and financial skills, allowing non-financial enterprises to become involved in shadow banking business. With the \u201cvacancy\u201d in formal institutions, we can see the role of informal institutions, such as social capital and interpersonal relationships, in the transition of the economy (Peng and Luo, 2000). In China, the capital market is still in the initial stages of development, and the primary source of financing is the credit granted by banks. As a result of banks\u2019 reluctance to lend, enterprises have difficulty obtaining financing and are more likely to suffer financial deterioration (Baum et al., 2009; Zhu, 2021). CEOs with banking backgrounds are ideally positioned to develop new capital flow channels for enterprises because of the financial resources during their tenure in banks. CEOs with bank backgrounds are likely to have enhanced resource acquisition skills, and their organizations have access to various sources of funds to finance enterprises that may be suffering from financing restrictions (Allen et al., 2019). Furthermore, managers may prefer areas they are familiar with when faced with multiple investment options. Shadow banking is a form of financial\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\ninnovation that stimulates lending behaviors for enterprises by expanding existing investment and generating new investments (Simsek, 2013). In shadow banking, the financial products carried out by banks account for a significant portion. There are various financial products, such as credit loans, beneficial rights of trust, entrusted loans, specific asset income, and asset pools. CEOs who have worked in banks are more familiar with the process and scheme of shadow banking business, and can provide guidance and suggestions for shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises (Francis et al., 2015). Accordingly, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH2b: Enterprises with CEOs with non-banking FBs are more likely to engage in the shadow banking business, that is, the smaller their shadow banking business is."

These companies were screened as follows: (1) excluded listed companies in the financial and insurance sectors, and listed companies in the real estate sector; (2) excluded ST and \u2217ST companies; (3) excluded financial-listed companies with missing data; (4) we performed all continuous variables in the model with 1 and 99% tailing to mitigate the influence of an extreme value on the research findings; and (5) all standard errors of regression results are adjusted by firm-level clustering to control for potential autocorrelation problems. We obtained the data for this study from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. In total, we obtained 27,782 firm-years observations from 3,504 companies.\nMain Variables Explained Variables The size of shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises (lnShadow). Referring to Jiang et al. (2010) and Han et al. (2019), we measured the size of shadow banking business by taking the logarithm of the sum of entrusted loans, entrusted finance, and private lending. (i) Entrusted loans. To estimate entrusted loans, we selected other current assets, non-current assets with maturity within 1 year, and other non-current assets from the \u201cBalance Sheet\u201d of the CSMAR database company research series \u2013 Financial Statements Section. (ii) Entrusted finance.

Otherwise, the value is 0. Moreover, this study examines the factors affecting the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises by categorizing CEOs\u2019 FBs into bank-only backgrounds (Bank_Fin) and nonbank backgrounds (NBank_Fin). Namely, (i) CEO\u2019s banking background (Bank_Fin). It takes the value of 1 when the CEO has only worked in a banking-type financial institution; otherwise, it is 0. (ii) CEO\u2019s non-banking FB (NBank_Fin). The value is 1 when the CEO has only worked in non-bank financial institutions; otherwise, it is 0.\nControl Variables Referring to Han et al. (2019) and Deng et al. (2021), and other studies on shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises, we introduced the following control variables that may affect shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises: enterprise size (InSize), enterprise age (Age), nature of equity (State), profitability (ROA), enterprise growth (TobinQ), financial leverage (Lev), current assets ratio (Liquidity), CEO duality (Dual), largest ownership (LShare), and the proportion of independent directors (Indep). In addition, we controlled for year-and-industry-fixed effects in the regression analysis results to mitigate potential endogeneity issues.

CEOs with FBs have a competitive advantage over CEOs without a FB in understanding investments, controlling risks, grasping opportunities, and processing information. Due to their greater business experience and stronger professional qualifications in the field of investment, they believe that they are more likely to succeed in investment projects and create greater value for enterprises (Cheng and Wu, 2022). Therefore, CEOs with FBs may be overconfident, while overconfident CEOs prefer high-risk shadow banking businesses, such as entrusted loans (Wu et al., 2021). Thus, we attempted to use overconfidence (Overcon) as a mediator variable. Referring to Hayward and Hambrick (1997); Liu and Li (2021), et al., we employed the executive relative compensation method to measure managerial overconfidence (Overcon). Specifically, we compared the ratio of the sum of the top three executives\u2019 compensation and the sum of all the top executives\u2019 compensation with the median. If the ratio is greater than the median, the value is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\nTable 6 shows the estimation results for overconfidence as a mediating variable.

Therefore, overconfidence is not a channel for CEOs with FBs to influence the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises. This is different from the findings of Du et al. (2019), who argue that CEOs\u2019 FB promotes enterprises financialization by increasing CEOs\u2019 confidence. This also confirms from the side that, although shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises still belongs to the category of enterprise financialization in essence, it is distinct from investing in mainstream financial assets, such as stocks and bonds."

Demir (2009) found that financial investment by non-financial enterprises will crowd out investment in the real economy. If enterprises spend too much money on shadow banking activities, they will not be able to upgrade their facilities and develop new products. As enterprises\u2019 profits from investment in the real industry keep decreasing, while those from financial assets keep increasing, enterprises reduce their investment in fixed assets (Tori and Onaran, 2018). In particular, enterprises with CEOs with FBs have even less endogenous incentives to make real investments (Liu et al., 2020), and they prefer to invest in the shadow banking business with funds originally used for their main business or other businesses. CEOs with FBs impact shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises by influencing enterprises\u2019 willingness to invest in real entities. Therefore, we examined enterprise entities investment levels (Entity) as a mediating variable. Referring to Han and Li (2020), we adopted the natural logarithm of the cash paid for the purchase of fixed assets, intangible assets, and other long-term assets to measure it.\nTable 7 shows the estimated results for the level of entity investment as a mediating variable.

As can be seen from Columns (5) and (6) of Table 9, the FB of the CEO is significantly and positively correlated with the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises at the 5% level when the institutional environment is better. While it does not pass the significance\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\ntest when the institutional environment is worse, although they are positively correlated. Shadow banking grows in scale with the improvement of economic growth (Tan et al., 2021). Shadow banking is a product of financial development at a certain stage. The phenomenon tends to occur in areas with a relatively high degree of marketization and relatively diversified capital. When the institutional environment is better, there is relatively less government intervention in enterprises, and CEOs have higher decision-making discretion (Wei and Ling, 2015). There is a more relaxed investment environment at this time, and CEOs with FBs can leverage their financial advantages to engage in shadow banking business."

            "text": "The \u201cfinance-like\u201d behavior of non-financial enterprises has encouraged the \u201coff real to virtual,\u201d which has seriously restricted the virtuous cycle of finance and economy. In the long run, to explore the long-term mechanism of shadow banking governance, we need to focus on its root, guide non-financial enterprises to carry out shadow banking business in a reasonable and compliant manner, and promote the improvement of China\u2019s financial market and the high-quality economic development. This study analyzes samples of nonfinancial enterprises in China\u2019s A-share-listed companies from 2008 to 2019 and empirically tests the influence and mechanism of the CEO\u2019s FB on the shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises. The results show that, first, the CEO\u2019s FB positively affects the shadow banking business of nonfinancial enterprises. Among them, the positive effect of nonbank FB is stronger. The results are still valid after robustness tests by replacing the measurement of variables, transforming the sample interval, controlling for other shocks, changing the parameter estimation method, and considering the endogeneity problem. Second, the mechanism analysis shows that CEOs\u2019 FB mainly promotes the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises by reducing investment in corporate entities. Third, the heterogeneity analysis finds that the relationship between the two is affected by different situational factors, such as the internal and external environments of enterprises. On the one hand, in terms of the micro characteristics of enterprises, the positive effect is more obvious in SOEs, non-MEs, and non-growth enterprises. On the other hand, with respect to the external macro\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 903637\nenvironment, CEOs with FBs have a stronger positive impact on the shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises in the period of easy monetary policy, in industries with higher competition or regions with better institutional environment. Our study reveals the internal mechanism of the CEO\u2019s FB and shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises. This study also enriches the research into the influencing factors of shadow banking business of non-financial enterprises and provides micro-level empirical support to alleviate the \u201coff real to virtual\u201d of the economy."

            "text": "From the perspective of the government, first, the government should effectively reduce the burden and operating cost of enterprises, promote the transformation and upgrading of enterprises, enhance the core competitiveness of enterprises in the real economy, and improve the benefits of investment in the real economy. Second, the government can strengthen the \u201cpenetrating supervision\u201d of the financial system, integrate the shadow banking market into the formal market, break through the boundary between formal and informal finances, and improve the structural regulation function of financial services in the real economy. Third, the government can take advantage of data resources to promote the integration of digitalization and marketization, establish a multilevel financial market, and create a favorable market environment for non-financial enterprises.\nFrom the perspective of enterprises, first, enterprises need to establish a mechanism for evaluating management experience and explore the potential advantages of utilizing the previous experience of managers. In addition, when selecting the management team, the enterprise should also consider the\ndifferent backgrounds of members, fully understand how the team\u2019s members complement one another, and encourage the members to perform their managerial duties effectively. Second, enterprises should develop a compensation system linked to the cost of risk, establish and improve the relevant performance assessment mechanism, and restrain the excessive speculative behavior of its decision makers. Third, enterprises can use big data to conduct in-depth research and explore market demand, improve the enthusiasm of non-financial enterprises to carry out their main businesses, and increase the expected benefits of industrial investment.\nIn addition, senior management should grasp the current situation of the enterprise and avoid habitual thinking. The senior management should, depending on the actual situation of the enterprise, clarify the extent of risks it can take to prevent the enterprise from hindering or even damaging the development of its main business."
