1. **Investigate the use of PolyGET for predicting the properties of polymers.** This could include properties such as mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. This information could be used to design new polymers with specific properties for various applications.


2. **Explore the use of PolyGET for studying the behavior of polymers in different environments.** This could include studying the effects of temperature, pressure, and chemical exposure on the properties of polymers. This information could be used to develop new materials that are resistant to harsh conditions.


3. **Develop new machine learning algorithms for training PolyGET.** This could include algorithms that are more efficient, more accurate, or more robust to noise. These algorithms could be used to train PolyGET on larger datasets and to improve the accuracy of its predictions.


4. **Apply PolyGET to the study of other materials.** This could include materials such as metals, ceramics, and glasses. This could help to develop new materials with improved properties for a variety of applications.


5. **Use PolyGET to design new drugs and materials.** This could be done by using PolyGET to predict the properties of different molecules and then selecting molecules with the desired properties. This could lead to the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects, as well as new materials that are stronger, lighter, and more durable.
