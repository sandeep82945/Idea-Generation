Based on the provided text, here are the portions mentioning future research directions:

1. "Identification and prediction of patients who may respond well to a certain treatment mechanism as well as clinical measurement of a patientâ€™s alcohol exposure are bottlenecks in AUD research which should be further addressed."

2. "In addition, greater focus must be placed on the development of novel strategies of drug design aimed at targeting the integrated neural pathways implicated in AUD pathogenesis, so that next-generation AUD treatment protocols can address the broad and systemic effects of AUD and its comorbid conditions."

3. "More AUD-specific genomic investigation is needed to determine whether any SNP drug targets have potential for targeted medications, which could allow for new, gene-specific mechanisms of pharmacological interventions."

4. "The field should move toward more reliable objective measures to assess alcohol consumption."

5. "Real-time daily assessments for alcohol consumption using biosensors that can continuously monitor alcohol levels may alleviate these concerns, and should be further explored as an objective assessment of drinking behavior."

6. "This inability of existing medications to effectively treat AUD illustrates the need to pursue new neuroscience-based pharmacotherapies that target the various neural and molecular pathways of addiction individually."

7. "Better understanding of the neurofunctional domains underlying AUD by assessing severity, modeling heterogeneity, predicting course, and targeting treatments can lead to improved medications."

8. "Novel strategies are needed to identify new treatments that address how the target interacts with other pathways and mechanisms."

9. "Further research is needed to clearly establish the role of current pharmacological interventions in treating AUD in the long term."

10. "Long-term studies with more complex statistical models are needed in order to better estimate the potential of pharmacological interventions for treating AUD and comorbid diagnoses together."

11. "Innovative approaches to identify novel targets and treatments are needed."

12. "Coordination of care between medical specialties is necessary to provide individuals suffering from AUD/ALD integrative care to maximize preventive measures and to minimize adverse health outcomes."

These quotes highlight the areas where the paper suggests future research should be directed to improve understanding, treatment, and management of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).
