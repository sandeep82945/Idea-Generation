This stigma not only causes harm to the mental health of these infertility patients, but also a ects their quality of life, making them bear the adverse social consequences such as domestic violence, marriage breakdown, or even delay in receiving the treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the patients\u2019 stigma and e ective intervention in alleviating it.\nAims/Question: This study aims to discuss and summarize the stigma in infertile women and its impact on patients, and to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment and nursing intervention of disease stigma in infertile female patients.\nMethods: The literature search used four English databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang). The search time of the literature ranges from the establishment of the library to 2022, with no language restriction.\nResults: The review included 28 studies, with 20 cross-sectional studies and 8 qualitative studies. This study found that social support, living environment, education level, occupation, and fertility awareness were themajor influencing factors of infertility stigma.\nConclusions: Infertility stigma can bring heavy mental pressure and psychological burden to female infertility patients and a ect their quality of life. Therefore, e ective and targeted psychological interventions should be developed to reduce the patients\u2019 stigma and improve their quality of life.\nImplications for practice: Healthcare workers must develop targeted nursing interventions, provide professional counseling services to reduce the level of stigma in female infertility patients, alleviate fertility stress, and improve their quality of life.\nKEYWORDS\nmental health, infertility, stigma, quality of life, review\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "Infertility refers to a situation in which both the husband and the wife want to have children, have a normal sexual life, and have not used contraception for more than a year but still cannot conceive (Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2017). Due to the influence of adverse factors such as environmental pollution, work pressure, and changes in living habits, the number of infertility patients increases annually (Fu et al., 2015).\nInfertility has become a major public health concern worldwide (Tsevat et al., 2017). According to theWHO statistics, infertility has become the third major disease in the twentyfirst century, after tumors, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases, threatening human health (Mascarenhas et al., 2013). Studies have shown that the proportion of infertile women is between 3.5 and 16.7% in developed countries and between 6.9 and 9.3% in developing countries. About 72\u223c80 million women of childbearing age worldwide currently have infertility (Khakbazan et al., 2020).\nAlthough the male-female ratio of infertility patients has increased recently, the female infertility patients seem to bemore psychologically stressed and bear the brunt of more severe social consequences in the face of infertility. Studies have revealed that both seeking and not seeking treatments can lead to an emotional distress in infertile women (McQuillan et al., 2003). In traditional cultural societies, not having children is often considered a woman\u2019s fault (Tiu et al., 2018). Infertile women are often observed as worthless or alien (Fledderjohann, 2012; Zhang et al., 2021). Some unreasonable social cognition and prejudice make many infertile women suffer different forms of discrimination in their lives and bear the social consequences such as violence from family, marriage breakdown, or malicious evaluation from surrounding people (Batool and de Visser, 2014; Dag et al., 2014; Kaya and Oskay, 2020). In Turkey, childless women are observed as \u201ctrees of no fruit\u201d (Ko\u00e7yigit, 2012). A similar phenomenon has occurred in Jordan, where infertile women are described as \u201cThe wings are broken,\u201d \u201cdead wood,\u201d and \u201chalf male and half female\u201d (Daibes et al., 2018). In this social environment, female infertility patients are highly susceptible to the stigmatization of the disease (Yilmaz and Kavak, 2019). The concept of stigma was first introduced by the American sociologist (Goffman, 2009), defining it as \u201can indecent social mark.\u201d When some people are given this label, they are often treated with contempt by ordinary people (Goffman, 1963). It can also lead to humiliation and discrimination for infertile women suffering from identity stigma because they believe they cannot meet social expectations, resulting in painful conditions such as anxiety and depression (Davern and O\u2019Donnell, 2018). Recently, it has been studied primarily in patients with cancer or stroke (Fujisawa andHagiwara, 2015; Zhu et al., 2019). However, there is no uniform definition of stigma in infertility patients. Rie Yokota, a Japan scholar, stated that after being diagnosed with infertility, the female infertility patients suffer from feelings of\nguilt, shame, and self-depreciation due to fear of rejection and social and family humiliation, which lead to negative emotions, rigidmarital relationships, and decreased quality of life, affecting the normal life of patients (Yokota et al., 2022).\nThe stigma of the disease negatively affects the female infertility patient\u2019s body and mind (Ying et al., 2015; Freeman et al., 2018). In addition, this stigma can severely affect the patient\u2019s social skills, segregating the patient from some positive social interactions (Cousineau and Domar, 2007; Slade et al., 2007). Due to the stigma of the disease, some patients are even unwilling to contact the members of the society at large, shut themselves up, produce more severe anxiety and depression-related symptoms, or delay medical treatment, thereby aggravating or impeding infertility treatment (Miles et al., 2009; Schwerdtfeger and Shreffler, 2009; \u00d6zt\u00fcrk R. et al., 2021).\nThe stigmatization of the disease has such a tremendous negative impact on the patient\u2019s body and mind, and the quality of daily life also declines. This review aims to investigate whether disease stigma affects the mental health and the quality of life of women experiencing fertility difficulties and provide a reasonable method for the medical staff to develop effective interventions in the future, reduce patient stigma, reduce the patient psychological burden, and improve the quality of life."

            "text": "Studies have revealed that infertile women worldwide are stigmatized for infertility (Whiteford andGonzalez, 1995; Jansen and Saint Onge, 2015; Anokye et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021).\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nAlthough infertile women in different countries and regionsmay differ in stigma due to cultural, religious, ideological, economic, and other differences (Karaca andUnsal, 2015), there is no doubt that all infertile women with stigma have poor mental health and quality of daily life (Brown, 2022; Yokota et al., 2022).\nSocial support is essential and is significantly associated with stress levels in infertile women (Gibson, 2000; Martins et al., 2011). Family and partners are important for infertile women to seek outside help. However, the social stigma and personal shame of infertility force infertile women to conceal their condition, preferring to keep their infertility a secret rather than communicate with family or friends. They can\nuse self-isolation to reduce the effects and injuries caused by the surrounding environment (Whiteford and Gonzalez, 1995; Ramazan et al., 2009; Karaca and Unsal, 2015). In a study of 21 infertile women, the patients highlighted their difficulties with friends who had children and found that they experienced social withdrawal at family and friend gatherings because they felt marginalized (Pedro, 2015). In another study, the authors found that infertile women deliberately avoided topics related to family or children to avoid sad or uncomfortable conversations (Remennick, 2000). These negative social interactions may reduce infertile women\u2019s perception of social support, further increase patients\u2019\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 PRISMA flow diagram.\nstigma, threaten their mental health, and exacerbate anxiety and depression.\nIn addition to social support, living environment, education level, occupation, and fertility awareness can also impact patients\u2019 stigma. The living environment in which infertile women live can impact their stigma. Compared to developed countries, women who live in traditional societies or accept traditional cultural beliefs believe that infertility places the most significant burden, stigma, and suffering (Greil et al., 2010; Ying et al., 2015). This may be because, in countries with sociocultural and traditional notions, the status of being a mother is important for a woman, and failure to take on\nthis responsibility can be socially ostracized and humiliated (Jansen and Saint Onge, 2015). This makes many female infertility patients more eager to get pregnant andmore sensitive to words such as \u201cpregnancy\u201d and \u201cchild,\u201d which increase their fertility pressure (Zhang et al., 2021). In addition to sociocultural factors in different countries leading to female stigma, different regions in each country produce different levels of stigma. Studies have indicated that infertile women with rural lifestyles are more discriminated against than infertile women with urban lifestyles (Donkor and Sandall, 2007; Li et al., 2017; Yilmaz and Kavak, 2019; Ozturk A. et al., 2021). Traditional culture is often more prevalent in rural areas, and\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nbecause of the rapid spread of information, infertile women are more vulnerable to social isolation and neglect (Ko\u00e7yigit, 2012). The family environment can also increase the stigma among infertile women. Two studies have found that living with parents may increase women\u2019s anxiety and make them more pressurized to have children (Li et al., 2017; Yokota et al., 2022).\nSome studies have found that stigma is associated with educational level (Donkor and Sandall, 2007; Lin et al., 2021; Ozturk A. et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and Kili\u00e7, 2022; Zhao et al., 2022). Patients with higher education levels have lower stigma than those with lower education levels, and patients with lower education levels are more likely to fall into an inferiority complex, leading to more severe stigma (Donkor and Sandall, 2007; Alhassan et al., 2014). This may be because highly educated women have more opportunities and abilities to learn about diseases. This helps them have access to real-time, effective treatment and the ability to overcome discrimination and infertility-related stigma in a positive manner (Alhassan et al., 2014; Jing et al., 2021).\nOccupation is also an important factor in the perception of stigma (Donkor and Sandall, 2007; Lin et al., 2021; Ozturk A. et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and Kili\u00e7, 2022; Zhao et al., 2022). On the one hand, occupation may be related to income level. One study observed that the psychological distress of infertile women whose income was lower than their expenditure was more severe (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckkaya and Kili\u00e7, 2022). Other studies have also shown that the cost of treatment can carry tremendous psychological stress on infertile patients (McQuillan et al., 2003; Ozkan and Baysal, 2006). Conversely, women with higher incomes experience a smaller psychological burden. They can devote their energy to work and career, distract themselves from the disease, and at the same time, learn some psychological skills to strengthen their psychological strength (Zhang et al., 2021). On the other hand, it may be related to whether the infertile woman is working or not. Women with fixed jobs and incomes can earn a sense of accomplishment through work and also have a stable source of income, ensuring their daily quality of life, and their guilt and sensitivity to diseases will be relatively low compared to unemployed women (Alhassan et al., 2014; Jing et al., 2021). Homemakers cannot obtain information about infertility and its consequences because they have little communication with the outside world. The work creates an environment for infertile women to help cope with infertility and support women, so that they can express their ideas and discuss and communicate with colleagues, relieving pressure on infertile patients to a certain extent (Nahar and van der Geest, 2014; Verma and Baniya, 2016).\nAn Iranian study revealed that the higher the level of irrational reproductive cognition, the higher the depression (Farzadi and Ghasemzadeh, 2008). This may be because infertile patients with a high level of irrational fertility cognition will have\na strong willingness to have children, and when the willingness to have children cannot be realized, the patient will think that she is not a complete woman, resulting in self-deprecating cognition, triggering the sense of stigma (Fekkes et al., 2003; Farzadi and Ghasemzadeh, 2008)."

            "text": "Because of fertility defects, infertile women suffer a double whammy from themselves and the outside world (Keramat et al., 2013; Yeshua-Katz, 2018). First, it makes patients very prone to stigma, and the stigma increases the psychological burden of patients, causing them to fall into negative emotions such as pain, inferiority, anxiety, depression, etc., which seriously affects the patient\u2019s physical and mental health and the treatment of diseases (Yagmur and Oltuluoglu, 2012; Li et al., 2017; Yilmaz and Kavak, 2019). Infertility patients from different cultural backgrounds are constantly faced with various unavoidable problems, which can cause significant psychological damage (Slade et al., 2007; Kaya and Oskay, 2020; Yokota et al., 2022). In this review, 17 out of 28 studies explored the impact of stigma on infertile women\u2019s mental health. Among these, 15 out of 28 studies found that stigma was significantly positively correlated with anxiety and depression, and the negative psychological emotions of infertile patients would increase with the stigma caused by infertility (Li et al., 2017). The remaining two studies focused on patients\u2019 feelings of hopelessness and sadness. One study of infertile women in Turkey found that female infertile patients felt hopelessness, which increased with the stigma (Kaya and Oskay, 2020). Another study from China compared their data with those of other infertility studies in China and found that women who had difficulty getting pregnant reported higher levels of sadness than healthy women (Zhao et al., 2022).\nAccording to the literature, some couples view infertility as the enemy of life (Yari et al., 2019; Alamin et al., 2020). Furthermore, a study found that after 12 months of treatment, the suffering of both unpregnant men and women in the social sphere increased (Schmidt et al., 2005). In this review, three studies compared infertility couples and found that women scored higher on stress, anxiety, and depression than men (Slade et al., 2007; Kaya and Oskay, 2020; Fang et al., 2021). In other words, women face a higher psychological stress in the face of infertility and are more likely to suffer stigma because of fertility difficulties. This could be because cultural factors and gender roles make women more likely than men to feel ashamed and negatively self-critical (Galhardo et al., 2011; Kaya and Oskay, 2020).\nIn addition to directly causing the psychological distress associated with infertility, stigma can lead to reduced social support for infertility patients, further increasing their distress.\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nSpecifically, when infertile patients feel more ashamed, they seek less social support and tend to avoid social activities in the form of avoidance and marginalization, followed by greater distress (Slade et al., 2007; Ozturk A. et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022)."

Society and the public are prone to give birth to a negative evaluation of infertility patients, leading to their social rejection, which increases patients\u2019 anxiety, depression, feelings of inferiority, and serious self-devaluation (Fu et al., 2015; Daibes et al., 2018). It can also lead to social withdrawal and reluctance to contact and communicate with others (Fu et al., 2015; Daibes et al., 2018). In the long run, the resulting stigma can negatively affect the quality of life of infertile women by reducing their self-esteem and self-efficacy (Remennick, 2000; \u00c7apik et al., 2019).\nTherefore, targeted, long-term interventions are needed to reduce the stigma in infertile patients to improve their quality of life. Healthcare workers should strengthen psychological counseling for infertile patients and encourage them to participate in fun group activities to improve their well-being (Domar, 2018). In addition, studies have shown that health insurance is vital for infertile women, and the purchase of insurance can reduce the burden of treatment on patients, so that their quality of life remains unchanged (Jing et al., 2022). In the future, more assistance will be required for uninsured infertile women to ensure their basic living standards."

            "text": "Infertile women have different levels of stigma, either from themselves or from family, friends, classmates, and society (Slade et al., 2007). Stigma not only leads to negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem in infertile patients but also leads to decreased life satisfaction, social isolation, and social avoidance, which severely affects their daily work and communication ability with others (Naab and Kwashie, 2018; Hassan et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a need for stigma interventions for infertile women. First, giving patients adequate social support. The most common source of stigma is external rejection and humiliation. A Nigerian study found that lack of support from the partner increased depression and anxiety in infertile women (Slade et al., 2007). Another study found that the adverse effects of infertility decreased significantly as infertile women received more social support\n(Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2017). Therefore, family members should be encouraged to give patients more companionship and care, comfort them when depressed, and prevent them from feeling alienated. Second, providing themwith professional psychological counseling. When patients seek outside help, consultants must deeply understand their emotional and psychological change, understand their social avoidance and the cause of the pain, provide them with scientific cognitive intervention therapy and psychological guidance, help improve their sense of shame and sadness, and help them better fit into society and participate in regular social activities with a positive attitude. Third, improving themedical and public health service system. The high cost of infertility treatment places a huge economic burden on patients who are already reeling under great psychological stress. Developing targeted health insurance schemes or reimbursement of costs can help meet the health protection needs of patients, thereby reducing their medical burden and enabling them to receive treatment in a more positive mindset. Fourth, education is the most powerful weapon against social stigma. Infertility education should be strengthened to raise awareness of social stigma among infertile women. Simultaneously, rational fertility concepts can be introduced to patients, and their notion of fertility can be changed through active peer guidance."

            "heading": "5. Discussion",
            "text": "Infertility is not a simple condition. It affects the physical and mental health of patients in many ways. This review summarized 28 studies and found that infertility-related stigma can negatively impact the psychology and daily life of women with infertility. The stigma can reflect a patient\u2019s psychological attitude toward infertility and the quality of life. Patients with high stigma have high fertility pressure and are prone to anxiety and depression, affecting their quality of life.\nThis review found that negative social interactions or inadequate social support can increase stigma and make patients suffer more (Slade et al., 2007; Akizuki and Kai, 2008). During interpersonal communications, infertile patients with high stigma often suffer from feelings of inferiority, loneliness, and self-blame due to the fear of being ostracized by society and hurt by gossip, and avoid social activities in the form of self-seclusion, marginalization, and reluctance to communicate with family and friends, and then suffer from more severe psychological problems (Van Rooij et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). A Chinese study showed that social support could protect infertile women in China from depression (Zhang et al., 2021). Stigmatized infertile women may be psychologically burdened by confiding in their husbands or other family members (Li et al., 2017). Another study discovered that infertile women were significantly less negatively\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\naffected by infertility as their social support increased (ZegersHochschild et al., 2017). Therefore, adequate social support may eliminate the anxiety and stress that comes with infertility. Healthcare professionals can create a comfortable environment for patients and provide appropriate psychological counseling to let them know that they are not alone and to help them face the disease with an optimistic attitude (Zhao et al., 2022).\nAt the same time, the study also found that improving education level and increasing employment opportunities are very important external factors in reducing the stigma of infertile women. Most articles report that the improvement in women\u2019s education level can help reduce female stigma, which may be because the improvement in women\u2019s education level will affect women\u2019s sense of identity with traditional gender concepts, and women with a higher education level have better self-regulation ability in the face of stressful events. The improvement in women\u2019s education level contributes to a better economic position and provides them with more opportunities and income in the labor market.\nIn traditional societies, childbirth and procreation are determinants of social status in society and the family and are seen as the main tasks of women, and women who fail to perform this responsibility are blamed and ostracized (Keskin and Babacan G\u00fcm, 2014). As a result, infertility patients are more concerned about childbearing\u2019s importance and potential significance and show a stronger sense of stigma. This review found that adverse effects on mental health only occur when infertile people agree with others to endorse the stigma and internalize this stigma as self-stigma (Corrigan and Rao, 2012). For example, women with a high level of irrational fertility in some traditional cultural environments tend to identify with the importance of childbearing. When they discover they are infertile, they define themselves as having negative traits, believing they are inferior, worthless, and flawed, and feel selfblame and guilt because they are unable to meet social norms and family expectations (Ergin et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019). A previous study showed that individuals with lower selfesteem experienced more severe psychological distress when they experienced major stress or setbacks. Conversely, high self-esteem protects individuals from emotional distress (Fang et al., 2021). Therefore, self-esteem is an essential element that mental health professionals must consider when dealing with mental health issues in infertile patients. Research suggests that psychological resilience plays a vital role in fighting the pain and impaired quality of life specific to infertility and can be seen as a nonspecific protective factor (Herrmann et al., 2011). Therefore, when counseling patients with involuntary infertility, due consideration should be given to help improve their psychological resilience so that they learn to appreciate and accept themselves, boost their self-confidence and self-esteem, and help them cope with daily social activities with a more powerful mindset.\nBased on the assessment results, regardless of the cause, women today suffer more self- and social stigma from infertility. Therefore, in the future, countries should expand the learning opportunities for girls and women, especially those living in poor areas and hailing from poor families. And to build a harmonious and inclusive culture, it is imperative to further integrate gender equality awareness into the whole process of education and even every aspect of economic and social life, and create a more gender-friendly educational and social environment. At the medical level, infertility-related stigma should be included within the scope of nursing evaluation, and the psychological state and quality of life of patients should be evaluated further. Psychosocial support is essential for infertility patients, and professionals can use psychological methods such as cognitive therapy and mindfulness therapy to improve their irrational fertility cognition level, thereby reducing the sense of shame. Meanwhile, nonmental health professionals can offer different types of stress-relieving measures such as relaxation, meditation, yoga, and other classes to help relieve negative emotions and improve the quality of life."
