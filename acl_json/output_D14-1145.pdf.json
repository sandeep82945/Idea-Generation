    "abstractText": "Languages spoken by immigrants change due to contact with the local languages. Capturing these changes is problematic for current language technologies, which are typically developed for speakers of the standard dialect only. Even when dialectal variants are available for such technologies, we still need to predict which dialect is being used. In this study, we distinguish between the immigrant and the standard dialect of Turkish by focusing on Light Verb Constructions. We experiment with a number of grammatical and contextual features, achieving over 84% accuracy (56% baseline).",

            "text": "Human languages are in constant evolution, driven in part by contact with other languages (Uriel, 1953; Thomason, 2008). In immigrant contexts, bilingual and multilingual speakers act as agents of change by transmitting borrowed words and expressions across languages (Grosjean, 2014). Depending on social factors such as duration and intensity of contact with the local languages, largescale spread of borrowed elements could lead to differences between the contact and non-contact dialects of the same language (Winford, 2005). For example, Spanish spoken by immigrants in USA sounds different in comparison to Spanish spoken in South America (Corvala\u0301n, 2003).\nIn this study, we focus on the immigrant dialect of Turkish as spoken in the Netherlands (NL-Turkish), which differs from Turkish spoken in Turkey (TR-Turkish). In contact situations, it is common for verbs to be borrowed across languages and integrated as nominal complements of Light Verb Constructions (LVCs) (Edwards and Gardner-Chloros, 2007; Butt, 2010).\nNL-Turkish LVCs are changing due to Dutch influence (Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Backus, 2007; Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Backus, 2009; Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Gries, 2012). However, assessing Dutch influence is not always easy since NL-Turkish LVCs still co-exist with the TRTurkish LVCs. This study aims to automatically identify the features that can distinguish between NL-Turkish and TR-Turkish LVCs.\nOur study would benefit Machine Translation systems targeting dialectal variation. It differs from studies concerning the well-established dialectal variations of Arabic, e.g., Levantine, Gulf, Egyptian, Maghrebi (Salloum and Habash, 2012), EU vs. Brazilian Portuguese (Marujo et al., 2011) or Turkish vs. Tatar (Altintas and Cicekli, 2002). In contrast, we are interested in developing language technologies for immigrant dialects, which are often understudied and lack written resources due to their unofficial status. When immigrant speakers face communication difficulties (e.g., bureaucratic affairs with the local officials, teacherparent meetings, doctor-patient conversations) in the local languages (e.g., Dutch) of the host country, they are often provided with translation equivalents in the standard dialect (e.g., TR-Turkish) of their native languages. However, these translations ignore the evolution of the immigrant dialect.1 By identifying the differences between two dialects of the same variety, we aim to improve Machine Translation systems targeting immigrant speakers. Our contributions are the following:\n\u2022 We are the first to predict on-going dialect variation in immigrant contexts as opposed to studying established dialect variations.\n\u2022 We are also the first to compare bilingual LVCs with the monolingual ones across two dialects of the same language.\n1One of the authors failed the driving test in the Netherlands due to the dialect variation in the Turkish translation.\n1391\n\u2022 Our comparison of grammatical versus contextual features reveals context to be much more important.\n\u2022 We experiment with LVCs extracted from natural spoken data rather than relying on isolated occurences, out of context."

In this study, we focus on Turkish LVCs with the verbal complements of yapmak/etmek, which both can be translated as \u201cmake/do\u201d. LVCs with these verbal complements are undergoing change in NL-Turkish (Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Backus, 2009).\nWe experiment with the following features to predict NL-Turkish vs. TR-Turkish LVCs."

            "text": "Dutch Influence In example (1), the Dutch verb overplaats is nominalized through the infinitive marker (-en) and precedes the Turkish verb yapmak to form a Turkish-Dutch bilingual LVC.\nExample 1: O arkadas\u0327 [overplaats-en yap-\u0131l-acak-t\u0131.]\nThat friend [replace-inf2 do-pass-fut-past]. That friend would have been replaced.\nIn addition to borrowing nominalized Dutch verbs to form bilingual LVCs, Dutch LVCs are also translated as a chunk into NL-Turkish. These translated LVCs sound unconventional to TRTurkish speakers (Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Gries, 2012). In example (2), the LVC [s\u0131nav yapmak] \u201cexam do\u201d is a literal translation of the Dutch [examen doen] \u201cexam-pl do\u201d, which is used to describe how students take high school exams to graduate.\n2acc: accusative, fut:future, inf:infinitive, past:past tense, part: participle, pres: present tense, pl: plural, poss: possesive, prog:progressive tense, sg: singular\nIn a similar context, TR-Turkish speakers would have used [s\u0131nav-a girmek] \u201cexam enter\u201d instead. These LVCs are also classified as having their origins in another language.\nExample 2: U\u0308c\u0327 gu\u0308ndu\u0308r [s\u0131nav yap-\u0131yor-uz].\nThree day [exam do-prog-1pl]. We are having exams for the last three days.\nOther Foreign Influences Although Dutch influence is clearly present in NL-Turkish LVCs, TR-Turkish LVCs are also not free of foreign influence. We have come across Arabic, Persian, French and English influences on Turkish LVCs with nominalized foreign verbs or literally translated LVCs as chunks. Example (3) illustrates how a borrowed Arabic verb (hitap, \u201caddress\u201d) is integrated as a nominal complement into a Turkish LVC [hitap etmek] \u201caddress do\u201d.\nExample 3: Hoca-m diye [hitap edi-yo-z] biz. Teacher-poss.1sg like [address do-prog-1pl] we. We address (him) as the teacher.\nExample (4) illustrates how an English LVC [do sports] is borrowed into Turkish as a chunk [spor yapmak] \u201csports do\u201d.\nExample 4: Yaz\u0131n [spor yap-\u0131yo-z].\nsummer spor do-prog-1pl We do sports in summer.\nWe have identified the etymological origins of LVCs in both corpora using an online etymological dictionary.3 Although LVCs of Dutch origin only occur in NL-Turkish, LVCs borrowed from other languages (e.g., Arabic, English, French) occur both in NL-Turkish and in TR-Turkish."

In example (5), the nominal element is the object of the verb, and thus it has the accusative marker.\nExample 5: Ben kendi [is\u0327-im-i yap-\u0131yor-um.]\nI own [work-poss.1sg-acc do-prog-1sg]. I do my own work.\n3http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/\nHowever, indefinite objects of the verb are left unmarked for case. In example (6), yapmak takes an indefinite object (food) as the complement. The boundary between [N V] constructions with indefinite nominal objects and LVCs are somewhat blurry. In both cases, the meaning of the verbal complement is bleached out and the nominal complement weighs heavier than the verbal one. We will not dwell further on this subtle distinction, but we plan future work on this topic following Cook et al. (2007) and Vincze et al. (2013).\nExample 6: Bazen [yemek yap-ar-d\u0131-m]\nSometimes [food do-pres-past-1sg] I used to sometimes prepare food.\nSince Dutch does not mark objects of the verb morphologically, NL-Turkish speakers have difficulty (e.g., unnecessary addition or omission of case markers) in determining the definiteness of the nominal complements in [N V] constructions (Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Backus, 2009). Therefore, we expect this feature to differentiate well between NLTurkish and TR-Turkish [N V] constructions and LVCs with yapmak/etmek as verbal complements."

Therefore, we encoded the finiteness on yapmak/etmek as a binary (yes/no) feature in both data sets. Example (7) illustrates a non-finite LVC where the verb stem (et) is accompanied with an infinitive marker (-mek).\nExample 7: Misafir-ler-e [ikram et-mek] ic\u0327in al-d\u0131-k\nGuest-pl-dat [serve do-inf.] for buy-past-1pl We bought (it) to serve the guests."

To capture this difference between the two dialects, we include the verb type as a feature as well.\nExample 8: Orda kad\u0131n [dog\u0306um et-ti].\nThere lady [birth do-past].

Although Turkish has a relatively flexible constituent order, object-verb (OV) is the most frequent word order for both NL-Turkish and TRTurkish (Dog\u0306ruo\u0308z and Backus, 2007). NL-Turkish speakers have adopted Dutch word order verbobject (VO) for some syntactic constructions, but we know little about the word order variation for LVCs. Encoding the word order of LVCs as a binary feature (OV vs. VO) could give us clues about differences or similarities of LVC use in NLTurkish and in TR-Turkish. In example (9), the nominal complement (one thing) follows the verbal complement instead of preceding it as seen in earlier examples.\nExample 9: [Yap-acak bir s\u0327ey] yok.\n[Do-part. one thing] exist.not There is nothing to do."

Since our data comes from natural conversations, we also experimented with the contextual information (words surrounding LVCs) as a feature for both data sets."

The reason to experiment with option (a) is due to the potential importance of the word order. While the word order variation is already modeled through feature (6), we also include the context as an additional feature to test its effect. On the down side, adding context doubles the feature space size and could lead to data sparseness issues. For the context words, we did not filter out stopwords since they are part of natural speech.\nFor our experiments, we used an SVM classifier as implemented in LibSVM. We used a linear kernel; more complex kernels did not help. We report results for a 5-fold cross-validation."

All models outperform the majority class baseline of always predicting TR-Turkish (which is 56.38% accuracy) by a sizable margin. Furthermore, splitting the context into left/right yields approximately 1.5% absolute drop in accuracy.\nThe lower part of the table shows the results when turning off each of the feature types. The context seems to be the most important feature since its exclusion leads to a drop from low-tomid eighties to about 70% accuracy. Except the nominal complements and the information about etymological origins, most other features seem to have marginal impact on accuracy. Excluding the two features (nominal complements and etymological origins) lead to approximately 0.5% absolute drop in accuracy. The impact of the last four features in the table is tiny; excluding some of them even leads to a tiny improvement.\nOverall, we can conclude that by far the most important features are the context features (without the left/right context split). The other useful features are the nominal complements and the information about the etymological origin of the borrowed LVCs. The remaining four linguistic features seem to be largely irrelevant."

            "text": "Language technologies are usually developed for standard dialects, ignoring the linguistic differences in other dialects such as those in immigrant contexts. One of the reasons for this is the difficulty of assessing and predicting linguistic differences across dialects. This is similar to efforts to translate well-established Arabic dialects (Bakr et al., 2008; Sawaf, 2010), or to adapt between Brazilian and European Portuguese (Marujo et al., 2011), Czech\u2013Slovak (Hajic\u030c et al., 2000), Spanish\u2013Portuguese (Nakov and Ng, 2009; Nakov and Ng, 2012), Turkish\u2013Crimean Tatar (Altintas and Cicekli, 2002), Irish\u2013Scottish Gaelic (Scannell, 2006), Bulgarian\u2013Macedonian (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012), Malay\u2013Indonesian (Wang et al., 2012) or Mandarin\u2013Cantonese (Zhang, 1998).\nIn this work, we have built a classifier that uses LVCs to differentiate between two different Turkish dialects: standard and immigrant. The results indicate that contextual features are most useful for this task. Although this requires further investigation, we can explain it by the thousands of features context generates: each contextual word is a feature. Thus, it is very hard for our grammatical features to compete against contextual features but they do have an impact.\nWe are planning to extend our study to dialects in other immigrant settings (e.g., Turkish in Germany) and to other types of multiword expressions (e.g., [N N] compounds)."
