    "abstractText": "Identification, and subsequent quantification of quantum correlations, is critical for understanding, controlling, and engineering quantum devices and processes. We derive and implement a general method to quantify various forms of quantum correlations using solely the experimental intensity moments up to the fourth order. This is possible as these moments allow for an exact determination of the global and marginal impurities of two-beam Gaussian fields. This leads to the determination of steering, tight lower and upper bounds for the negativity, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence used as a quantifier of state nonseparability. The principal squeezing variances are determined as well using the intensity moments. The approach is demonstrated on the experimental twin beams with increasing intensity and the squeezed super-Gaussian beams composed of photon pairs. Our method is readily applicable to multibeam Gaussian fields to characterize their quantum correlations.",

We derive and implement a general method to quantify various forms of quantum correlations using solely the experimental intensity moments up to the fourth order. This is possible as these moments allow for an exact determination of the global and marginal impurities of two-beam Gaussian fields. This leads to the determination of steering, tight lower and upper bounds for the negativity, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence used as a quantifier of state nonseparability. The principal squeezing variances are determined as well using the intensity moments. The approach is demonstrated on the experimental twin beams with increasing intensity and the squeezed super-Gaussian beams composed of photon pairs. Our method is readily applicable to multibeam Gaussian fields to characterize their quantum correlations.\nQuantum theory allows for correlations between spatially separated systems or degrees of freedom that are fundamentally different from their classical counterparts. For composite systems, quantum correlations (QCs) manifest themselves in many different (inequivalent) forms [1\u20134], including the Bell nonlocality, quantum steering, and entanglement. They can be exploited to achieve qualitatively better performance in information processing tasks compared to purely classical scenarios. Though the question of which kind of QCs is a necessary resource for a given quantum information protocol remains still open, particularly when multipart systems are considered, the analysis of QCs among different subsystems is extraordinarily important [5, 6]. It belongs to fundamental problems in quantum information science and quantum many-body physics at present. Applying very general quantum theories and models, the structure of QCs is elucidated and nontrivial limitations on the strength of physically allowed QCs are revealed.\nOver the years, several methods for the analysis of QCs have been proposed based on, e.g., the violation of various inequalities [7\u201310], geometrical considerations [11], or even interference among multiple copies of the investigated state [12\u201314]. However, such methods usually require certain initial knowledge about the analyzed state density matrix, which is never experimentally acquired without technical difficulties. Similarly, the homodyne tomography [15] in quantum optical experiments with continuous-variable states, which provides the complete characterization of the detected field, has to rely on a coherent local oscillator with the varying phase [16]. Contrary to this, we routinely measure the photocount distributions in numerous experiments by photon-numberresolving detectors [17]. So it is very important to develop methods allowing to extract the maximum information about QCs in the analyzed field using just these photoncount distributions. While there are numerous\nnonclassicality witnesses at our disposal [18\u201320], revealing the structure of QCs represents a much more complicated task. Several schemes for solving this problem have already been suggested using, however, some form of homodyning of the analyzed field [21\u201323]. Interestingly, an exact copy of the analyzed state can be used in a suitable interferometric setup [13] instead of a local coherent oscillator of the homodyne scheme to reveal all four invariants of a two-beam Gaussian field, which is equivalent to the determination of all elements of its covariance matrix.\nIn this Letter, we address this problem for a wide group of in-practice important Gaussian fields. We propose a scheme based solely on the intensity moments of optical fields to estimate their global and marginal purities. Although the photocount measurements do not allow for the determination of all coefficients characterizing such Gaussian fields (information about the phases of complex coefficients is missing), the needed information can partly be inferred from the values of higher-order intensity moments [24]. In our scheme, both the global and marginal field purities are expressed in terms of higherorder intensity moments. This opens the door for direct determination of important QC quantifiers, involving the R\u00e9nyi-2 entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, one- and two-way Gaussian steering, and even tight lower and upper bounds for the logarithmic negativity. Also, the squeezing of Gaussian states can be determined. In practice, direct measurements of the intensity moments of optical fields are standardly performed using various types of photon-number-resolving detectors including intensified CCD cameras [25, 26] or superconducting bolometers [27], to name a few. This makes our scheme qualitatively simpler compared to those based on various forms of homodyning. Using two-beam states originated in parametric down-conversion, we experimentally demonstrate the suggested approach.\n2 Purity estimation of Gaussian fields.\u2014 We begin with defining the normal characteristic function CN (\u03b21, \u03b22) [24] for general single-mode two-beam fields,\nCN (\u03b21, \u03b22) = \u3008exp\n[\n\u2211\nj=1,2\n\u03b2j a\u0302 \u2020 j\n]\nexp\n[\n\u2212 \u2211\nj=1,2\n\u03b2\u2217j a\u0302j\n]\n\u3009,\n(1) where a\u0302j (a\u0302 \u2020 j) stands for the annihilation (creation) operator of beam j, j = 1, 2 and \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 denotes quantummechanical averaging. For quantum Gaussian fields the characteristic function CN (\u03b21, \u03b22) takes the form [24]\nCN (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b2 \u2217 1 , \u03b2 \u2217 2) = exp\n[\n\u2212 \u2211\nj=1,2\n[Bj |\u03b2j | 2 (2)\n+(Cj\u03b2 \u22172 j /2 + c.c.)] + (D12\u03b2 \u2217 1\u03b2 \u2217 2 + D\u030412\u03b21\u03b2 \u2217 2 + c.c.\n)]\nwith real (Bj) and complex (Cj , Djk, D\u0304jk) parameters characterizing the Gaussian state; c.c. replaces the complex-conjugated terms.\nThe measured intensity moments \u3008W k1 W l 2\u3009, given as the normally ordered photon-number moments and obtained via the Stirling numbers from the measured photon-number moments [24], contain partial information about the state parameters:\n\u3008W k1 W l 2\u3009 = (\u22121)\nk+l \u2202 2(k+l)CN (\u03b21,\u03b22,\u03b2 \u2217 1 ,\u03b2 \u2217 2 )\n\u2202k\u03b21\u2202k(\u03b2\u22171 )\u2202 l\u03b22\u2202l(\u03b2\u22172 )\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\n\u03b21=...=\u03b2\u22172=0\n.\n(3)\nConsidering the intensity moments up to the second order, we reveal the following relations for the looked-for parameters:\nBj = \u3008Wj\u3009,\n|Cj | 2 = \u3008W 2j \u3009 \u2212 2\u3008Wj\u3009 2, j = 1, 2,\n|D12| 2 + |D\u030412| 2 = \u3008W1W2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009. (4)\nThe third-order intensity moments give us additional information about the looked-for parameters:\n\u22124\u211c{C1D\u030412D \u2217 12} = \u22124\u3008W1\u3009\n( \u3008W1W2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009 )\n+ \u3008W 21W2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008W 2 1 \u3009\u3008W2\u3009,\n\u22124\u211c{C\u22172D\u030412D12} = \u22124\u3008W2\u3009 ( \u3008W1W2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009 )\n+ \u3008W1W 2 2 \u3009 \u2212 \u3008W1\u3009\u3008W 2 2 \u3009. (5)\nWe note that, alternatively, the expressions in Eq. (5) can be obtained from the third-order moments \u3008W 3j \u3009, j = 1, 2 or even fourth-order moments \u3008W 31W2\u3009 and \u3008W1W 3 2 \u3009. Finally, also the fourth-order intensity moment \u3008W 21W 2 2 \u3009 reveals a useful relation among the looked-for parame-\nters,\n4(2|D12| 2|D\u030412| 2 + \u211c{C1C \u2217 2 D\u0304 2 12}+ \u211c{C1C2(D \u2217 12) 2}) =\n\u3008W 21W 2 2 \u3009 \u2212 4\u3008W1W2\u3009 2 \u2212 \u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009\u3008W1W2\u3009+ \u3008W1\u3009 2\u3008W2\u3009 2\n\u2212 2[\u3008W1\u3009 2(\u3008W 22 \u3009 \u2212 2\u3008W2\u3009 2) + \u3008W2\u3009 2(\u3008W 21 \u3009 \u2212 2\u3008W1\u3009 2)]\n\u2212 (\u3008W 22 \u3009 \u2212 2\u3008W2\u3009 2) (\u3008W 21 \u3009 \u2212 2\u3008W1\u3009 2)\n+ 16\u3008W2\u3009\u211c{C1D\u030412D \u2217 12}+ 16\u3008W1\u3009\u211c{C \u2217 2 D\u030412D12}. (6)\nSurprisingly, Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) are sufficient to obtain the global and marginal purities of the two-beam Gaussian fields. In order to show that, we need to know the corresponding covariance matrix \u03c3 \u2261 \u3008\u03be\u0302\u03be\u0302 T \u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03be\u0302\u3009\u3008\u03be\u0302 T \u3009 containing the second-order moments of the position x\u0302j = (a\u0302j + a\u0302 \u2020 j)/2 and momentum p\u0302j = (a\u0302j \u2212 a\u0302 \u2020 j)/(2i) operators embedded in vector \u03be\u0302 T = (x\u03021, p\u03021, x\u03022, p\u03022). Using the parameters of the normal characteristic function CN in Eq. (2), the covariance matrix \u03c3 is expressed as\n\u03c3 =\n[\n\u03c31 \u03b3 \u03b3T \u03c32\n]\n, (7)\nwhere\n\u03c3j =\n[\n1 + 2Bj + 2\u211c{Cj} 2\u2111{Cj} 2\u2111{Cj} 1 + 2Bj \u2212 2\u211c{Cj}\n]\n,\n\u03b3 =\n[\n2\u211c{D12 \u2212 D\u030412} 2\u2111{D12 \u2212 D\u030412} 2\u2111{D12 + D\u030412} \u22122\u211c{D12 + D\u030412}\n]\n. (8)\nNow, one can easily verify that the determinants of the global \u03c3 and local \u03c3j , j = 1, 2, covariance matrices are given in terms of the intensity moments as\ndet\u03c3 = 1 + 4(\u3008W1\u3009+ \u3008W2\u3009) + 12(\u3008W1\u3009+ \u3008W2\u3009) 2\n\u22124\u3008W 21 \u3009(1 + 6\u3008W2\u3009+ 24\u3008W2\u3009 2)\u2212 4\u3008W 22 \u3009 \u00d7(1 + 6\u3008W1\u3009+ 24\u3008W1\u3009 2) + 8\u3008W 21W2\u3009 \u00d7(1 + 6\u3008W2\u3009) + 8\u3008W1W 2 2 \u3009(1 + 6\u3008W1\u3009)\n\u22128\u3008W1W2\u3009(1 + 6\u3008W1\u3009+ 6\u3008W2\u3009+ 48\u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009)\n+96\u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009(\u3008W1\u3009+ \u3008W2\u3009+ 5\u3008W1\u3009\u3008W2\u3009)\n+24\u3008W 21 \u3009\u3008W 2 2 \u3009 \u2212 8\u3008W 2 1W 2 2 \u3009+ 48\u3008W1W2\u3009 2, (9)\ndet\u03c3j = 1 + 4\u3008Wj\u3009+ 12\u3008Wj\u3009 2 \u2212 4\u3008W 2j \u3009, j = 1, 2. (10)\nKnowing these determinants, the corresponding purities \u00b5 = 1/(det\u03c3)1/2 and \u00b5j = 1/(det\u03c3j)1/2 are established [1]. Contrary to this, seralian \u2206, the last of four global invariants of two-beam Gaussian states, requires \u03b3 to be determined, \u2206 = det\u03c31 + det\u03c32 + 2det\u03b3 [3, 28].\nThis central result allows us to determine various quantities that characterize the structure of two-beam QCs [29\u201332]. Using the purities \u00b5 and \u00b5j , j = 1, 2, we immediately obtain the R\u00e9nyi-2 entropies along the formula SR = \u2212 ln(\u00b5) [31]. We note that SR represents the continuous analog of the Shannon entropy. The R\u00e9nyi2 entropy SR can then be used to quantify the total quadrature correlations via the Kullback-Leibler divergence (distance) H between the analyzed two-beam state\n3 \u03c1\u0302 and its factorized counterpart Tr2{\u03c1\u0302}Tr1{\u03c1\u0302} [31]:\nH = SR,1 + SR,2 \u2212 SR = ln\n(\n\u00b5\n\u00b51\u00b52\n)\n. (11)\nAlso the degree of (one-way) Gaussian steering of beam 2 by beam 1 [30] is expressed in terms of purities [32]:\nG1\u21922 = max{0, ln(\u00b5/\u00b51)}. (12)\nWe note that two-way steering occurs provided that both G1\u21922 and G2\u21921 are nonzero.\nUsing purities, even the logarithmic negativityEN [29], giving the degree of entanglement revealed, e.g., by the Simon criterion [33], is established through its tight lower and upper bounds derived by Adesso et al. [34]:\nEmax(\u03c1) = \u2212 1\n2 ln\n[\n\u2212 1\n\u00b5 +\n(\n\u00b51 + \u00b52 2\u00b521\u00b5 2 2\n)\n(\n\u00b51 + \u00b52 \u2212\n\u221a\n(\u00b51 + \u00b52)2 \u2212 4\u00b521\u00b5 2 2\n\u00b5\n)]\n,\nEmin(\u03c1) = \u2212 1\n2 ln\n[\n1\n\u00b521 +\n1\n\u00b522 \u2212\n1\n2\u00b52 \u2212\n1\n2\n\u2212\n\u221a\n(\n1\n\u00b521 +\n1\n\u00b522 \u2212\n1\n2\u00b52 \u2212\n1\n2\n)2\n\u2212 1\n\u00b52\n]\n. (13)\nApplication to experimental data.\u2014 We tested the derived formulas on a set of the experimental spatiospectrally multimode twin beams (TWBs) [35] with increasing intensity [for mean photon number \u3008n1\u3009 of beam 1, see Fig. 1(a)] that were obtained by adding the photocounts registered by two single-photon counting modules positioned in the signal (1) and idler (2) beams in subsequent detection windows (for details, see the Supplemental Material [36] and [37]). The TWBs at 710 nm originated in type-I parametric down-conversion in a LiIO3 nonlinear crystal pumped by the third harmonic of an Nd-YAG laser at 355 nm. We arrived this way at the compound multimode TWBs with mean photon numbers extending over 2 orders in magnitude (from 0.1 to 10 mean photons per beam). The experimental photocount histograms were reconstructed by the maximum-likelihood approach to obtain the joint photon-number distribution p(n1, n2) and its photon number moments \u3008nk1n l 2\u3009m = \u2211\u221e n1,n2=0 nk1n l 2p(n1, n2). Also entropy S of the fields was determined along the formula S = \u2212\n\u2211\u221e n1,n2=0\np(n1, n2) ln[p(n1, n2)] and plotted in Fig. 1(b). The intensity moments, that are the normally ordered photon-number moments, were then derived as linear combinations of photon-number moments using the Stirling numbers of the first kind [18].\nWe note that, when correcting the experimental data for nonunit detection efficiencies \u03b71 and \u03b72, the use of any reconstruction method is not required. We may simply determine the intensity moments \u3008W k1 W l 2\u3009E directly from the detected photocount histogram and derive the needed\nintensity moments as \u3008W k1 W l 2\u3009 = \u3008W k 1 W l 2\u3009E/(\u03b7 k 1\u03b7 l 2). On the other hand, reconstruction methods allow us to correct also for other detector parameters like dark-count rates, cross talk, etc. In real experiments, sufficiently large detection efficiencies are needed to arrive at acceptably low errors in the determination of the reconstructed intensity moments.\nThese experimental beams are multimode as they are generated in parametric down-conversion in the runningwave configuration and detected in multiple detection windows. They also suffer from imperfections that oc-\n4 cur both during the generation process and transmission to the detectors. As a consequence, they decline from the theoretically expected form of a multimode noisy TWB whose coefficients obey C1 = C2 = D\u030412 = 0 in Eq. (2). These declinations can be quantified using the derived formulas for the tested quantum information quantities. However, these quantities are derived for two single-mode Gaussian beams and so their application is conditioned by the reduction of the experimental multimode photon-\nnumber moments \u3008nk1n l 2\u3009m to one typical mode in each beam. Estimating the number M of effective modes in each beam [20, 38] we may follow the procedure outlined in the Supplemental Material [36].\nWe compare the values of the obtained quantities per mode with those characterizing a single-mode Gaussian noisy TWB [39], that is fully characterized by three firstand second-order photon-number moments (Bj = \u3008wj\u3009 = \u3008nj\u3009, |D12|2 = \u3008w1w2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008w1\u3009\u3008w2\u3009 = \u3008n1n2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008n1\u3009\u3008n2\u3009). For the formulas, see the Supplemental Material [36].\nAccording to the experimental results reduced to one mode and plotted in Figs. 1(c)\u2014(f), the R\u00e9nyi-2 entropies SmR /M , the Kullback-Leibler divergence H\nm/M , the negativity EmN/M as well as the steering parameter Gm1\u21922/M do not considerably change with the increasing field intensity, i.e., the increasing number N of grouped detection windows (M = 10N).\nAs the values of R\u00e9nyi-2 entropy SmR of the two-beam fields are smaller than the entropies SmR,1 and S m R,2 of the constituting signal and idler beams [see Fig. 1(c)], the purities of the two-beam fields are greater than those of the constituting beams. This implies, according to the general classification of two-beam Gaussian states (see\nTable I in [40]), that the analyzed two-beam fields are entangled.\nThe experimental values of HmR /M , G m 1\u21922/M and EmN/M reduced per one mode and determined by the derived formulas (11)\u2014(13) are systematically greater (by approximately 10% \u2013 20%) than those characterizing the Gaussian noisy TWBs (determined by the formulas in the Supplemental Material [36]). This means that the states of the detected two-beam fields are more general than those of the Gaussian noisy TWBs with the vanishing coefficients C1, C2, and D\u030412. The consideration of the experimental third- and fourth-order intensity moments reveals that also the complex parameters (C1, C2, and D\u030412) of the detected two-beam Gaussian fields are nonzero, which leads, according to our results, to stronger QCs described by the above quantities. We note here, that our results do not allow us to judge the declination (non-Gaussianity) of the analyzed state from the general form of Gaussian states as described by the characteristic function in Eq. (2).\nThe Kullback-Leibler divergence HmR , the steering parameter Gm1\u21922 and the negativity E m N of the two-beam fields increase practically linearly with the increasing TWB intensity. This contrasts with the behavior of\n0 1 2 3 0\n1\n2\n3\n/ 1\n/ 2\n-3.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5\nlog10(EN ) av\n0 1 2 3 0\n1\n2\n3\n/ 1\n/ 2\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\nlog10( EN ) max\n(a) (b)\nFIG. 2. (a) Average negativity EavN and (b) maximum \u03b4E max N of relative error as they depend on ratios \u00b5/\u00b51 and \u00b5/\u00b52. In the white areas no entangled states exist. For \u00b51 = \u00b52, see also in [32].\nthe entropy Sm of the two-beam fields whose increase is smaller: The entropy Sm/M per mode plotted in Fig. 1(b) decreases with the increasing TWB intensity. This means that the capacity of available QCs increases linearly with the dimensionality (number of modes M) of the analyzed fields. The capacity of QCs thus grows faster than disorder in the analyzed fields quantified by the entropy Sm.\nWe note that nonzero negativity EmN and the KullbackLeibler divergence HmR are obtained also directly for the experimental photocount histograms, i.e., without reconstructing the experimental data. This contrasts with the steering parameters Gm1\u21922 and G m 2\u21921 being zero in this case.\nThe negativity EN is the most commonly used parameter to quantify QCs. However, we have only the lower and upper bounds in Eq. (13) at disposal for single-mode two-beam Gaussian fields. Nevertheless, the experimental data plotted in Fig. 1(f) show that these bounds are very close to each other: The uncertainty in determining EN is practically given only by the experimental errors. This observation is valid in general. Indeed, from the point of view of the entanglement, two-beam Gaussian states are divided into groups of states with identical amount of EN . These groups are parameterized by four parameters: purities \u00b5, \u00b51, \u00b52, and seralian \u2206. The minimal and maximal values of the negativity EN given in Eq. (13) in fact represent the extremal values with respect to seralian \u2206 for fixed values of the purities. The general behavior of these extremal values can conveniently be quantified taking into account that the negativity EN increases (decreases) with the increasing global purity \u00b5 (marginal purities \u00b51 and \u00b52). This suggests the ratios \u00b5/\u00b5j, j = 1, 2, as suitable parameters for quantifying the uncertainty in the determination of EN : The greater the ratios are, the greater the negativity EN is. This is documented in the graph of Fig. 2(a) where the negativity EavN averaged over the states with fixed ratios \u00b5/\u00b51 and \u00b5/\u00b52 is plotted. The maximum of the relative error\n5 \u03b4EmaxN [34],\n\u03b4EN = EmaxN \u2212 E min N\nEmaxN + E min N\n, (14)\ntaken over the states with the fixed ratios \u00b5/\u00b51 and \u00b5/\u00b52 is then shown in Fig. 2(b). According to Fig. 2(b), the relative error \u03b4EN is smaller than 10% (1%) when the ratios \u00b5/\u00b5j are greater than 1.5 (2.5), i.e., when the states exhibit considerable entanglement. This makes the use of the bounds for negativity EN very efficient.\nSingle beam properties.\u2014 The approach presented above for two-beam Gaussian fields is applicable also to single-beam Gaussian fields. The intensity moments allow us to determine the principal squeezing variance [41, 42] in this case. Merging the intensities of the signal and idler beams of the above discussed two-beam fields, we arrive at single-beam super-Gaussian fields with phase fluctuations reduced below the shot-noise limit, as discussed in detail in the Supplemental Material [36].\nFurther extension and application.\u2014 Our results also allow for the analysis of QCs of general n-beam Gaussian states. This is so as the appropriate covariance matrix is composed of blocks of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices similar to those written in Eq. (7) [43, 44]. This allows us to analyze its properties by considering all possible two-beam subsystems of the whole n-beam Gaussian field. The formulas in Eqs. (9) and (10) hold for such subsystems and allow us to quantify QCs in these two-beam reductions. Relying on various monogamy relations, we may establish the lower bound for the genuine multipartite QCs in the whole n-beam field [31, 45, 46].\nIn conclusion, we have shown how various forms of quantum correlations of two-beam Gaussian fields (with spatiospectral multimode structure), that naturally depend on the fields phase properties, can be quantified solely from the measured intensity moments up to the fourth order. The determination of the global and marginal purities of the involved beams in terms of the intensity moments represents the key step. The principal squeezing variances can solely be derived from the intensity moments as well. We have demonstrated usefulness and practicality of this approach by considering suitable experimental fields. Our method is readily applicable to multipartite systems for the detection and characterization of their quantum correlations. As the Gaussian states are exploited in numerous metrology applications and quantum-information protocols with continuous variables, we foresee numerous applications of the suggested and demonstrated method in the near future.\nA.B. and A.\u010c. acknowledge financial support by the Czech Science Foundation under the project No. 20-17765S.
