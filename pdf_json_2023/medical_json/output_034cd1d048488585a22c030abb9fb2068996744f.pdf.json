Singapore General Hospital 3 (SGH) established the Perioperative and Anesthesia Subject Area Registry (PASAR) to unify data 4 from the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative stages. This study presents the 5 methodology employed to create this database. 6 Methods: Since 2016, data from surgical patients have been collected (CIRB 2021/2547) from the 7 hospital electronic medical record systems, de-identified, and stored securely in compliance with 8 privacy and data protection laws. As a representative sample, data from initiation in 2016 to 9\nDecember 2022 were collected. 10 Results: As of December 2022, PASAR data comprise 26 tables, encompassing 153,312 patient 11 admissions and 168,977 operation sessions. For this period, the median age of the patients was 60.0 12 years, sex distribution was balanced, and the majority were Chinese. Hypertension and 13 cardiovascular comorbidities were also prevalent. Information including operation type and time, 14 intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were collected. 15 Emergency surgeries resulted in longer ICU stays, but shorter operation times than elective 16 surgeries. 17 Conclusions: The PASAR provides a comprehensive and automated approach to gathering high-18 quality perioperative patient data. 19 20\nKeywords: Anaesthesia; Data registry; Operation outcomes; PASAR; Perioperative care; 21 Perioperative registry. 22\n23\n8\nIntroduction 2\nAccording to the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, 4.2 million people worldwide die within 30 3 d of surgery per year. This major mortality risk exceeds that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 4 malaria, and tuberculosis combined [1,2]. Many of these deaths are potentially preventable [3\u20135]. 5 This is in addition to other nonfatal perioperative complications, which can cause negative long-term 6 health outcomes [6,7] and contribute to high healthcare costs [8,9]. Hence, improving perioperative 7 outcomes is essential, as not only individual patients but also health systems as a whole benefit. 8\nBoth research and quality improvement in healthcare require an accurate understanding of patient 9 profiles and care trajectories. To enable such efforts, a curated registry comprising high-quality real-10 world data for the entire perioperative period, including the preoperative, intraoperative, and 11 postoperative periods of hospitalization, is paramount. Such a registry would provide the essential 12 data for retrospective studies of factors influencing patient outcomes and prospective evaluations of 13 clinical interventions. By consolidating and organizing perioperative data in an integrated database, 14 researchers could easily access and analyze a large amount of collected data, which could lead to 15 more accurate predictive models, an improvement in patient outcomes, and ultimately, improvements 16 in clinical decision-making. In addition, an integrated perioperative registry would ensure access to 17 data that is standardized and high quality, through the use of quality assessment methods. This is 18 critical for accurate data analysis and the development of machine-learning models. By enforcing 19 data standards and quality checks, researchers can minimize the risk of bias and errors in statistical 20 analysis and develop machine-learning models. Furthermore, the use of a registry could address the 21 data sharing and privacy concerns associated with the use of large institutional datasets. A secure and 22\n9\nand can only be accessed by authorized personnel. 2\nCurrently available high-resolution datasets include those derived from intensive care unit (ICU) 3 stays, such as the frequently cited Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and IV 4 datasets and the eICU, Amsterdam UMCdb, and HiRID databases [10\u201312]. Other datasets, such as 5 the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) dataset, have focused on perioperative 6 information in the western populations [13,14]. These datasets have enabled important research such 7 as predictive analytics using machine learning and waveform processing [15]. However, no large 8 high-resolution databases integrating all patient-care areas throughout the perioperative period are 9 currently available. To address this gap, we established an integrated, standardized, and curated 10 perioperative registry database at our institution. 11\nSingapore General Hospital (SGH) is a quaternary care and academic medical center. It is the largest 12 hospital in Singapore, with approximately 28,000\u201330,000 surgeries conducted each year. A 13 comprehensive electronic medical record (EMR) has been implemented at SGH along with a fully 14 digital anesthesia information and monitoring system (AIMS) for the operating room. Every patient\u2019s 15 surgical journey generates a digital footprint that encompasses the medical doctors, nursing, and allied 16 health consultation notes; laboratory and imaging results; physiological patient monitoring; 17 medication or blood product prescriptions; operation time; and length of hospital stay. These data 18 exist in the following formats: structured data (e.g. patient demographics and comorbidities), 19 unstructured data (e.g. patient communication notes), high-resolution physiological time-series data 20 (e.g. intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure), and imaging data (e.g. radiology images). 21\nThis study aims to describe the methodology used to set up the perioperative data mart used at SGH, 22 the Perioperative and Anesthesia Subject Area Registry (PASAR), which combines data from the 23\n10\npatient\u2019s entire journey from the operating room to the ICU. An overview of the case mix and 2 available data within this registry is also presented. 3\n11\nThe PASAR covers all patients who undergo surgery at SGH. It was initiated in 2016 and continues 2 to be populated with data to the present day. 3\nApproval for the database was granted by the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board 4 (Singhealth CIRB 2014/651/D, 2020/2915, and 2021/2547). The requirement for individual patient 5 consent was waived as the data are collected during routine clinical care and de-identified. The 6 PASAR operates in compliance with Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act and the Human 7 Biomedical Research Act as well as other ethical guidelines based on the Declaration of Helsinki, 8 2013 [16\u201318]. The pipeline from routine clinical data and de-identification protocols are described 9\nbelow. 10 The main data source for the registry is the EMR (Sunrise Clinical Manager, Allscripts, IL), AIMS 11 (WinChart\u00ae , WinChart Health Informatics, Sydney, NSW, Australia), and administrative billing 12 (SAP ISH, SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) systems at SGH. All data from internal sources are acquired 13 during routine patient care (i.e., no specific data are collected for research). The Singapore National 14 Registration Identification (NRIC) number is a national identifier unique to each individual and is the 15 common identifier for data contained in various systems throughout Singapore. 16\nAll hospital data are stored in raw format in our enterprise data warehouse system (SingHealth-IHiS 17 Electronic Health Intelligence System \u2014 eHINTS). This structured query language (SQL) database 18 allows for data staging before it is uploaded to the registry. Manual data entries are unavailable. All 19 data are stored securely within an approved access-controlled facility at SGH in a manner compliant 20 with local privacy and data protection laws. The database is synchronized with the National Registry 21 of Births and Deaths to ensure that all out-of-hospital deaths are captured. 22\n12\nelectronic clinical document has been used since 2016 to identify individuals who qualify for 2 inclusion in the database. All patients aged \u2265 18 years who undergo surgery under anesthesia care at 3 SGH are included. 4 De-identification processes are performed by a trusted third party within SGH that is not involved in 5 research-related activities using PASAR data. This trusted third party acts in accordance with 6 Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act and Human Biomedical Research Act [16,17]. 7\nOur institution mandates the de-identification of 15 direct identifiers, which include case and visit 8 numbers, death dates, postal codes, and names in structured fields and free-text data. De-identification 9 of case and visit numbers is performed by pseudonymization using a hashing algorithm (SHA-256) 10 that returns substitute values. Before hashing, the identifiers are salted with project-specific values at 11 the beginning and end. This process of salting and hashing the case and visit numbers is used 12 consistently to ensure that the study team is able to link cases across all tables using substitute values. 13 Death dates are de-identified by generalization to months and years (i.e., the exact day is censored). 14\nIn addition to fields that explicitly contain these 15 direct identifiers, other high-risk data fields, such 15 as unstructured text (which can contain names and other identifiers) are completely concealed. 16 For each individual, data are collected during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative 17 periods. 18\nThe clinical variables included in the data registry have expanded over time. At the time the PASAR 19 was initiated in 2016, data on preoperative medical history and laboratory results as well as important 20 clinical outcomes such as length of hospital stay, ICU admissions, and death were included [19,20]. 21 Currently, additional data routinely captured during preoperative anesthesia assessment visits are 22 included, such as patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory test results, and 23\n13\nperformed, and high-velocity vital signs time series data; and postoperative data including post-2 anesthesia care unit (PACU), ICU, 30-d vital signs, and fluid balance data. Furthermore, discharge 3 summaries in both free-text entries and structured ICD-10 codes are included for all case entries. A 4 full data dictionary is available for accredited users. 5 Establishing clear data ownership ensures that the data are properly collected, stored, and maintained, 6 and that all stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities regarding the data. Ownership 7 of the PASAR lies with the first author (HRA), who is responsible for ensuring proper delegation to 8 authorized nominees and users. Only authorized users with a legitimate need to access the data are 9 granted access, and access is monitored and audited regularly to ensure that the data is not being 10 accessed inappropriately. The Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DSAIL) at SGH 11 is a data management team that is responsible for establishing data quality checks and ensuring that 12 the data are stored securely. 13\nData sharing is essential to facilitate research collaboration and advance perioperative research. 14 However, data sharing must be performed in a manner that protects patient privacy and 15 confidentiality. This includes establishing data-sharing agreements that specify how data can be 16 used and who can access it. All data are anonymized before being released to researchers, and 17 researchers must sign a data-use agreement that prohibits re-identification and unauthorized 18 redistribution of the data. The authors can be contacted for details on the data-sharing agreement 19 and protocols. 20\n14\nAs of December 2022, the PASAR consists of a relational database containing 26 tables linked by 2 the patient\u2019s case number (a unique identifier for every admission), operation session identifier, and 3 operation identifier (as multiple operations can be performed in a single session). The database is 4 segmented into three schemata based on the perioperative period the data were collected: pre_op 5 (preoperative), intra_op (intraoperative), and post_op (postoperative). The pre_op, intra_op, and 6 post_op schemata consist of 5, 7, and 14 tables, respectively. Detailed entity relationship diagrams of 7 these three schemata and variable descriptions are available in Supplementary Material Figure e1 and 8 Table e1. A total of 153,312 patients were admitted, among which 168,977 operation sessions 9\ncontaining 183,687 operations were conducted. Fig. 1 shows these data broken down by year. 10\nThe profiles of the patients included in the study are listed in Table 1. Discrete variables are reported 11 as counts and percentages and continuous variables are reported as medians and interquartile ranges 12 (IQRs). These measures provide a concise overview of patient characteristics, allowing for other 13 studies or populations to be easily compared. This patient cohort consisted of 153,312 patients, with 14 a median age of 60.0 years (IQR 45.0, 69.0) and a balanced sex distribution (females: 50.2%). The 15 majority of patients were Chinese (72.4%), followed by Indian (10.6%) and Malay (9.6%). Almost 16 half of the patients had hypertension (44.9%) and a significant number of cardiovascular 17 comorbidities were reported, such as ischemic heart disease (12.7%), kidney dysfunction (5.8%), 18 diabetes mellitus on insulin (4.8%), and congestive heart failure (3.3%). Operation characteristics are 19 provided in Table 2. Summary statistics were calculated on a per-operation basis. Counts and 20 percentages are presented for discrete variables, while medians and IQRs are presented for continuous 21 variables. Most patients had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status scores of 22 2 (50.0%) and 3 (35.1%), while 14.6% of the patients underwent emergency surgeries 23\n15\noperation basis. Counts and percentages are presented for discrete variables, while medians and IQRs 2 are presented for continuous variables. Clinically relevant outcomes included the operation time, ICU 3 length of stay, and 30-d and 1-year mortality. The median ICU length of stay after emergency surgery 4 was 3 d longer than that after elective operations (5.1 d vs 1.9 d); however, the median operation time 5 was shorter (0.9 h vs 1.2 h). 6 7\n16"

            "text": "The PASAR can be used to obtain high-fidelity data on a patient\u2019s perioperative journey at scale via 3 automated retrieval from EMR sources and clinical databases. This ensures complete coverage of all 4 relevant cases without requiring human data entry, thus reducing human labor, ensuring data accuracy, 5 and minimizing the risk of privacy and security breaches. We believe that the link between high-6 frequency intraoperative data and long-term postoperative outcomes will further facilitate quality 7 improvements and research in perioperative medicine. Moreover, a large-scale perioperative registry 8 provides a centralized location for perioperative data, ensures data quality and standardization, and 9\naddresses the privacy concerns associated with the use of large institutional datasets. The availability 10 of such data repositories can drive innovation in perioperative medicine and improve patient 11 outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large database in Asia to achieve this. 12\nOur cases follow national gender and ethnic distributions [21]. Patients in our cohort were older adults, 13 with a median age of 60 years. This is similar to the MPOG database, where older adults aged > 65 14 years comprised a significant proportion of patients. However, patient distribution may be atypical or 15 skewed owing to the reduction in elective surgeries performed due to COVID pandemic measures. 16 Only semi-urgent elective procedures, such as malignancy operations, were permitted [22] in our 17 institution from February 2020 [23], and normal operations resumed slowly over the course of 2021\u201318 2022. This may have affected the summary statistics for the median age, length of stay, and mortality 19 rates. However, with elective operations resuming in the post-pandemic period, the case distributions 20 are expected to normalize. 21\nWe recognize that an EMR-based approach to data collection has limitations [24] and may not fully 22 capture every aspect of a patient\u2019s perioperative status. For example, events recorded in the EMR 23\n17\ndocumentation may be retrospective in emergencies. Important qualitative observations such as 2 patient discomfort are also challenging to capture. Records external to electronic data sources, such 3 as laboratory results and prescriptions from different healthcare hospitals, cannot be directly accessed. 4 Although free-text records may provide useful information, they are censored in the current database 5 because of the lack of standardized de-identification protocols for free text. These factors can cause 6 unmeasured data loss and bias within the PASAR, similar to other EMR-based registries. Data users 7 must be aware of these limitations. 8\nWe envision the PASAR as the cornerstone for Singaporean researchers interested in leading and 9 participating in international perioperative studies. Although this registry is currently not available as 10 an open-access resource for international researchers owing to prevailing local regulatory limitations, 11 collaborative access with legal and infrastructural safeguards is possible. Further steps to improve 12 data usability would include implementing mappings to a widely accepted data model such as the 13 common data model (CDM) promulgated by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership 14 (OMOP) [25]. The OMOP CDM is an open community data standard designed to standardize the 15 structure and content of observational data to enable efficient analyses and produce reliable evidence. 16 The use of such a model would allow for pooled analyses using the PASAR and other databases [26]. 17 At present, no perioperative databases have been fully mapped using the OMOP CDM. We envision 18 our PASAR dataset to act as a leading case study to form a perioperative research consortium for our 19 region. 20 21 Limitations and Future Work 22 The handling of large relational databases can be challenging for average clinical users. Even after 23 taking steps to manage the \u201c4 Vs of big data\u201d (volume, velocity, variety, veracity), EHR data often 24\n18\ndatabases can be challenging to navigate, particularly for users unfamiliar with the underlying data 2 model, making complex queries or data analysis tasks difficult to perform. At present, information 3 technology tools such as SQL, which require further technical training, are used to query databases. 4 The lack of user-friendly and convenient access to structured data for clinical providers is frequently 5 a rate-limiting step in clinical research and quality improvements. We hope to implement low-code 6 or no-code interfaces in the future to facilitate clinician interaction with the data. 7\nIn conclusion, the PASAR provides a comprehensive and automated approach to collecting high-8 fidelity data on a patient\u2019s perioperative journey. By linking high-frequency intraoperative data with 9 long-term postoperative outcomes, this database has the potential to facilitate quality improvements 10 and research in perioperative medicine. 11 12\n19\n1.
