    "abstractText": "Nanocomposites of cyanate ester resin (CER) filled with three different reactive aminofunctionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) were synthesized and characterized. The addition of a small quantity (0.1 wt.%) of amino-POSS chemically grafted to the CER network led to the increasing thermal stability of the CER matrix by 12\u201315 \u25e6C, depending on the type of aminoPOSS. A significant increase of the glass transition temperature, Tg (DSC data), and the temperature of \u03b1 relaxation, T\u03b1 (DMTA data), by 45\u201355 \u25e6C of the CER matrix with loading of nanofillers was evidenced. CER/POSS films exhibited a higher storage modulus than that of neat CER in the temperature range investigated. It was evidenced that CER/aminopropylisobutyl (APIB)-POSS, CER/N-phenylaminopropyl (NPAP)-POSS, and CER/aminoethyl aminopropylisobutyl (AEAPIB)POSS nanocomposites induced a more homogenous \u03b1 relaxation phenomenon with higher T\u03b1 values and an enhanced nanocomposite elastic behavior. The value of the storage modulus, E\u2032, at 25 \u25e6C increased from 2.72 GPa for the pure CER matrix to 2.99\u20133.24 GPa for the nanocomposites with aminofunctionalized POSS nanoparticles. Furthermore, CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites possessed a higher specific surface area, gas permeability (CO2, He), and diffusion coefficients (CO2) values than those for neat CER, due to an increasing free volume of the nanocomposites studied that is very important for their gas transport properties. Permeability grew by about 2 (He) and 3.5\u20134 times (CO2), respectively, and the diffusion coefficient of CO2 increased approximately twice for CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites in comparison with the neat CER network. The efficiency of amino-functionalized POSS in improving the thermal and transport properties of the CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites increased in a raw of reactive POSS containing one primary (APIB-POSS) < eight secondary (NPAPPOSS) < one secondary and one primary (AEAPIB-POSS) amino groups. APIB-POSS had the least strongly pronounced effect, since it could form covalent bonds with the CER network only by a reaction of one -NH2 group, while AEAPIB-POSS displayed the most highly marked effect, since it could easily be incorporated into the CER network via a reaction of \u2013NH2 and \u2013NH\u2013 groups with \u2013O\u2013C\u2261N groups from CER.",

            "text": "Cyanate Ester Resins (CER) constitute a very attractive class of high-performance polymers, which differ from others by a very regular structure of the polymer networks, namely polycyanurates (PCNs), obtained by dicyanate polycyclotrimerization [1\u20135]. They have received much attention because of their unique combination of physical properties, including a high thermal stability (>400 \u25e6C), high glass transition temperature (>270 \u25e6C), high fire-radiation and chemical resistance, low water absorption and low outgassing, high adhesion to different substrates, and excellent dielectric properties (\u03b5 = 2.64\u22123.11) [2\u20134]. As a result, CERs are currently used as structural or functional materials in aeronautics, space structures (composite strakes, fins, nose radar domes, heat shields), and printed circuit boards, as well as adhesives [6]. The following companies manufacture CERs for these applications: Cytec Aerospace Materials, Hexcel, Huntsman Advanced Materials, JFC Technologies, Lonza, Henkel, and TenCate Advanced Composites. However, like for most thermosets, their main drawback is brittleness. To overcome this limitation, modifications of CERs have been developed over the past decades, and it is still of great interest. CERs can be modified by many different additives, such as engineering thermoplastics, elastomers, or reactive oligomers [2\u20135,7\u201314] with a formation of semi-IPNs, IPNs and hybrid networks [7\u201334]. The improvement of mechanical properties can thus be attained, due to the microphase-separated morphology generation, and especially in the case of a co-continuous morphology. Unfortunately, the latter improvement is often achieved at the expense of thermal stability. This deficiency is remedied by the synthesis of nanocomposites of CER with montmorillonite (MMT) [35\u201340], carbon nanotubes [41,42], nanostructured aluminum borate [43], ZnO [44], ZrW2O8 [45], nanosilica [46\u201348], polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) [49\u201373], and other nanofillers. The most pronounced effect on mechanical and thermal properties of CERs is achieved when nanoparticles with organically modified surface are used, as they may react with polymer networks. POSS represent cage structures with the formula (RSiO1.5)n where n = 8, 10, 12 and R is hydrogen, reactive, or non-reactive organic groups. Each silicon atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a cage and to a single R substituent out of a cage. These substituents improve the compatibility of POSS molecules with polymers or monomers. In the case of reactive R, 3-D POSS molecules with diameters of 1\u20132 nm, they may graft chemically to polymer structures. New hybrid organic\u2013inorganic CER-based thermosets with hydroxyl[49,51,52,55,69,72], amino- [50,53], epoxy- [59\u201366,68\u201370], cyanate- [67], benzoxazinyl- [71] or methacrylate-functionalized [73] POSS units have thus been obtained with improved thermal and mechanical properties. Recently, thermostable nanocomposites based on densely crosslinked CER doped by 0.01\u201310 wt.% epoxycyclohexyl-functionalized POSS (ECH-POSS) were synthesized and characterized using TEM, SAXS, EDXS, FTIR, DSC, DMA, TGA, far-IR, and creep rate spectroscopy techniques [60,61]. It was revealed that ultra-low POSS contents (<<1 wt.%) covalently embedded into a CER network substantially changed its nanostructure and properties [60,61,64]. This resulted in changing network dynamics, increasing glass transition temperatures by 20\u201350 \u25e6C, enhancing high temperature elastic and creep resistance properties, and increasing thermal stability under an inert atmosphere at T < 400 \u25e6C. The effects decreased, or even became zero or negative, while increasing POSS content, especially from 2 to 10 wt.%, due to arising the structural nanorod- or platelet-like formations and POSS enriched nanodomains. At ultra-low POSS contents, the data obtained suggested basically molecular POSS dispersion, their quasi-periodic spatial distribution in the matrix, and not only chemical modifying the CER network, but also the possible manifestation of the enhanced long-range action of the \u201cconstrained dynamics\u201d effect. The aim of this present work is to synthesize and investigate the structure-properties relationships for nanocomposites of CER filled with amino-functionalized POSS of different reactivities, i.e., possessing different numbers of primary and/or secondary amino-groups. We intend to determine the effect of amino-functionalized POSS nanoparticles on phase\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 3 of 19\nstructure, morphology, physical properties, and gas permeability of the CER/amino-POSS films. Amino groups are very reactive towards cyanate groups [2,74,75], therefore, during mixing and heating of the amino-POSS nanoparticles with CER monomer, the nanoparticles may react and be chemically incorporated into the growing network to form hybrid organic/inorganic networks with improved physical and chemical properties."

Amino groups are very reactive towards cyanate groups [2,74,75], therefore, during mixing and heating of the amino-POSS nanoparticles with CER mono-\ner, the nanoparticles may react and be chemically incorporated into the growing network to form hybrid organic/inorganic networks with improved physical and chemical properties.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials\nThe CER network was formed using 1,1\u2032-bis(4-cyanatophenyl) ethane (dicyanate ester of bisphenol E, DCBE), under the trade name PRIMASET\u00ae LECy, kindly supplied by Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). POSS derivatives, viz., aminopropylisobutyl POSS\u00ae (APIBPOSS), aminoethyl aminopropylisobutyl POSS\u00ae (AEAPIB-POSS), and N-phenylaminopropyl POSS\u00ae (NPAP-POSS) from Hybrid Plastics Inc. (Hattiesburg, MS, USA), were used as received. The chemical structures and basic physical characteristics for these components are given in Table 1.\n2. Synthe is Procedure The initial DCBE/PO S mixtures were first stirred with a magnetic stirrer (15 0 rpm) at T \u2248 65 \u00b0 f r SS dispersion and chemical grafting through the reaction between cyanate r s i groups of PO S. Then, the obtained mixtures w re poured into a PTFE-coated mold and cured over the temperature range from 25 \u00b0C to 300 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 0.5 \u00b0C/min. All polymer nanocomposites derived from DCBE w re synthesized with a constant mass rop rti n of different amino-POSS equal to 0.1 wt.% wit a thickness of 8 \u2013115 \u00b5m.\n2.3. Characterization Techniques Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was performed using a TA Instruments Q800 analyzer operating with 0.05% of strain amplitude and a frequency of 1 Hz. The samples were heated from \u2212150 \u00b0C to 320 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 3 \u00b0C/min. Loss modulus peaks corresponding to the \u03b1 relaxation were deconvoluted with the IgorPro 6.38 software. The surface of deconvoluted peaks was calculated via the MultiPeak 1.4 function of this software by fitting the peaks with Gaussian distribution functions. The molar mass between crosslinks Mc was then calculated according to Equation (1) [76]: \ud835\udc40 = \ud835\udc38\u2032\u00f8\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc53 (1) where E\u2019 is the elastic mod lus taken at T\u03b1 + 50 \u00b0C, R is the ideal gas constant equal to 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K, T = T\u03b1 + 50 \u00b0C, f is t e net ork functionality which for the studied samples was consid red equal to 3, and \u03d5 is a factor linked to the network model.

The downstream pressure, P2, was measured as a function of time. The permeability coefficient, P, was calculated from the slope of the linear time dependence of P2 in a steady state, and the diffusion coefficient, D, was deduced from the time lag, \u03b8, as determined by the extrapolation of the steady-state line on the time axis (Equation (4) [80]):\nD = L2\n6\u03b8 (4)\nwhere L is the film thickness. D was expressed in cm2\u00b7s\u22121 and P in barrer (with 1 barrer = 10\u221210 cm3(STP)\u00b7cm/ ( cm2\u00b7s\u00b7cmHg)). Water sorption isotherms of the different films were determined at 25 \u25e6C by using the dynamic vapor sorption analyzer, DVS Advantage (London, United Kingdom). Each sample was pre-dried in the DVS Advantage by exposure to dry nitrogen until the equilibrated dry mass was obtained (m0). A partial pressure of vapor (Pi) was then established within the apparatus by mixing controlled amounts of dry and saturated nitrogen and the mass of the sample (mt) was followed as a function of time. The mass of the sample at equilibrium (meq) was considered to be reached when changes in mass with time (dm/dt) were lower than 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 mg\u00b7min\u22121 for at least 5 min. Then, vapor pressure was increased in suitable activity (aw: 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, respectively). The value of the mass gain at equilibrium (G) was defined by Equation (5) [80]:\nG = meq \u2212m0\nm0 (5)\nFor each water activity (aw), it permitted to plot the water sorption isotherm. The precision on the values of G was estimated to be better than 5%.\nThe diffusion coefficient (D) was determined according to Equation (6) [80]:\nD = 0.04909\u00b7L2\nt1/2 (6)\nwhere t1/2 is the half sorption time and L is the sample thickness."

In a previous study [40], some of us observed the same band as well in the cured CER/amino-MMT nanocomposites. In this present work, the initial stage of amino-POSS chemical grafting or incorporation into the CER network is schematically shown in Figure 1.

The uniform distribution of amino-POSS nanoparticles in the CER network without their aggregation was undoubte ly achieved due to two main reasons: (i) a sufficiently low (0.1 wt.%) nanofiller c ntent, and (ii) the use of a special pr heating procedure (before\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 8 of 19\nthe main synthesis) for ensuring chemical interactions between the functional groups of CER and amino-POSS. Each POSS nanoparticle was thus surrounded by CER molecules transforming into the polymer network at further high temperature curing, without agglomeration. As a result, the high crosslink density organic-inorganic hybrid polymer network was formed obviously without significant defects. Recently, Zhang et al. [81] mathematically processed the curves E\u2032\u2032 = f (T) for an individual CER using inverse convolution by the contributions of single relaxation processes. Four distinct peaks corresponding to the main \u03b1-relaxation of a higher intensity at a higher temperature, and secondary \u03b3- and \u03b2-relaxations of lower intensities at lower temperatures were detected. From Figure 2b, one could see that both neat CER and all CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites exhibited broad \u03b3-relaxation assigned to the phenylene and methyl groups rotations present in the links between the planar six-member three-arm cyanurate rings of CER structure [82] with a maximum at T \u2248 \u221285 \u25e6C and in the temperature range from \u221290 \u25e6C to \u2212100 \u25e6C, correspondingly. Secondary relaxations appeared with a maximum at T\u03b2 (from \u221243 to \u221211 \u25e6C, Table 2) and at T\u03b2\u2032 \u2248 100 \u25e6C, corresponding to the \u03b2 and \u03b2\u2032 relaxations associated with the mobility of the chain fragments between the crosslink sites of the CER network [83]. One could see from Figure 2 and Table 2 that the CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites possessed higher values of T\u03b1 compared to the unfilled CER network. Herewith, loading the APIB-POSS into the CER network resulted in a temperature shift towards higher T\u03b1 values by 18 \u25e6C, whereas the addition of NPAP-POSS and AEAPIB-POSS sharply increased the T\u03b1 values by 44 \u25e6C and 50 \u25e6C, respectively (see Table 2). Thus, the introduction of amino-POSS nanoparticles chemically grafted/incorporated into the CER networks led to the formation of new hybrid crosslinking sites. As a result, the additional steric obstacles reduced the amplitude of the spatial mobility of the kinetic segments of the macromolecules of the CER network, which caused an increase in the value of T\u03b1, thus confirming conclusions of Bershtein et al. [61] about the enhanced long-range action of the \u201cconstrained dynamics\u201d effect. Therefore, in the presence of amino-POSS, the values of T\u03b3 decreased, whereas the values of T\u03b2, T\u03b1, E\u2032, and Mc increased, evidencing that amino-POSS behaved as both thermal and mechanical antiplasticizers i.e., reinforcements. The curves for E\u2032\u2032 and tan \u03b4 seemed to be in contradiction to what the E\u2032 and T\u03b1 values showed. Indeed, an apparent increase in the E\u2032\u2032 and tan \u03b4 peak intensities is observed for \u03b1 relaxation in the presence of APIB-POSS, NPAP-POSS, and AEAPIB-POSS, whereas a \u201cclassical\u201d anti-plasticization effect (i.e., increase of T\u03b1) would tend toward the reduction of such peak intensities, since the material would be considered stiffer. However, it should be considered that not only the intensity of E\u2032\u2032 and tan \u03b4 peaks represent the viscoelastic behavior of a polymer, but also the peak amplitude and half-width. This is due to the fact that the main \u03b1 relaxation is a heterogeneous phenomenon spanning a range of temperatures. In order to really distinguish the influence of added nanofillers on the viscoelastic behavior of CER networks, the surfaces of the E\u2032\u2032 peaks, representing the total modulus loss during the whole \u03b1 relaxation phenomenon should be compared. The E\u2032\u2032 peaks observed for the \u03b1 relaxation were deconvoluted and integrated as detailed in the Experimental section. A single Gaussian function was considered for CER/APIB-POSS, CER/NPAP-POSS, and CER/AEAPIB-POSS samples whereas two Gaussian functions were considered for neat CER. The computed surfaces are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 shows that CER/APIB-POSS and neat CER had similar E\u2032\u2032 peak surfaces, that of CER/APIB-POSS being slightly lower. The reduction of the E\u2032\u2032 peak surfaces was further observed for CER/NPAP-POSS, and CER/AEAPIB-POSS nanocomposites. This meant that the introduction of APIB-POSS, NPAP-POSS, and AEAPIB-POSS actually reduced the viscous behavior of CER, as the surface of these peaks correspond to the loss due to the viscoelastic nature of polymers during the \u03b1 relaxation phenomenon, as detailed in the previous paragraph. As such, the observed increase in E\u2032 \u2032 and tan \u03b4 intensities was not due to an increase in a viscous behavior but could be correlated to a more homogeneous \u03b1 relaxation phenomenon induced by the presence of the amino-based nanofiller. Finally, it could be concluded that CER/APIB-POSS, CER/NPAP-POSS, and CER/AEAPIB-POSS\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 9 of 19\nnanocomposites induced a more homogenous \u03b1 relaxation phenomenon with higher T\u03b1 values, and an enhanced nanocomposite elastic behavior compared to unfilled CER network."

The main stage was in a region of ~374\u2013440 \u00b0\u0421 related to the degradation of cyanurate skeleton [2,3], and a second stage at 467\u2013531 \u00b0\u0421. The residual char was determined to be ~46\u201351% at 630 \u00b0C. Nevertheless, the thermal stability of the nanocomposites increased when only 0.1 wt.% of different amino-POSS were loaded compared to the unfilled CER matrix. Thus, one could conclude that the temperature of the intensive decomposition onset for the unfilled CER matrix was quite high (Td1 onset = 374 \u00b0C), and it increased by \u22489\u201315 \u00b0\u0421 when introducing the amino-POSS nanoparticles. The temperature of the maximal degradation rate Td1 max shifted to higher temperatures by \u22485\u201312 \u00b0\u0421 as well depending on the functionality of the amino-POSS used.

More interestingly, the greatest impact on thermal stability (increasing by 12\u201315 \u00b0C) was observed with loading of AEAPIB-POSS with one secondary and one primary amino group. It was obvious that primary amino groups had a reactivity higher than that of secondary amino groups, which resulted in a higher degree of POSS nanoparticles grafting to CER network.\nTable 4.

It was obvious that primary amino groups had a reactivity higher than that of secondary amino groups, which\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 11 of 19\nresulted in a higher degree of POSS nanoparticles grafting to CER network. In conclusion, the highest effect was logically observed for the AEAPIB-POSS, where the effect of the primary amino group was further enhanced by the presence of a secondary amino group. The increase in thermal stability of the nanocomposites studied was undoubtedly associated with the creation of numerous additional organic-inorganic nodes in the hybrid CER/amino-POSS network and, probably with the formation of an additional network of hydrogen bonds between the functional groups of POSS and CER. It is noteworthy that the ultra-low amount (0.1 wt.%) of amino-POSS and the special preheating/mixing synthesis procedure used for sample preparation prevented the aggregation of POSS nanoparticles and promoted efficient dispersion and chemical incorporation of the nanoparticles into the CER matrix. The higher the number and reactivity (with respect to the CER cyanate groups) of the amino groups in amino-POSS, the stronger the effect of POSS on the thermal stability of the nanocomposite. It is clear that additional energy was required to destroy multiple hybrid cross-links in the nanocomposites studied. Obviously enough, at high POSS contents, due to the increased aggregation of nanoparticles and occurrence of defects in the highly regular structure of the CER network, a decrease in the thermal stability of the samples could be observed [58,61,64]. It was of interest to compare the properties of CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites studied in this work with experimental data published elsewhere [50,53,82]; the corresponding comparative data are given in Table 5. Unfortunately, due to significant differences in the composition of the samples under investigation (CER matrix, component content), synthesis methods, as well as experimental conditions of analysis, it was impossible to directly compare the properties of the nanocomposites from the different references. However, some general conclusions could be drawn below.\nFirst, it was clear that the CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites studied in this work were synthesized and studied for the first time. Second, the concentration of the nanofillers in the nanocomposites studied was 10\u2013200 times lower than in previous reports [50,53,82], where the concentration of amino-POSS varied from 1 to 20 wt.%. Third, the strong synergistic effect of ultra-small amounts (0.1 wt.%) of amino-POSS on the viscoelastic properties and thermal stability of the synthesized nanocomposites was also demonstrated for the first time. For example, the greatest increase in the Tg value by 52 \u25e6C (compared to the unfilled CER) was recorded in this work for CER/AEAPIB-POSS nanocomposite (Table 5), while for the nanocomposites described in the literature, the maximum increase in the Tg value was equal to 31 \u25e6C only (PT-15/OAP-POSS = 99/1 wt.%, [53]) and the maximum increase in Tg(end)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 12 of 19\nvalue was equal to 43 \u25e6C only (PT-15/OAPr-POSS = 80/20 wt.%, [82]). Additionally, for the nanocomposites herein investigated, the values of moduli E\u2032 at 40 \u25e6C were 1.5\u20132.3 times higher than those for the nanocomposites previously studied (Table 5) [52,53,82]. We also found a significant effect of low concentrations of amino-POSS on the thermal stability of the nanocomposites studied: for CER/APIB-POSS and CER/AEAPIB-POSS, the Td5% value increased by 25 \u25e6C and 36 \u25e6C (in comparison to neat CER network), respectively. Thus, one could conclude that using ultra-low amounts of amino-POSS additives was an effective way to improve the properties of novel nanocomposites based on CER matrixes of different chemical structures."

Conclusions Nanocomposites of cyanate ester resin (CER) filled with different types of reactive\namino functionalized POSS were synthesized and characterized. For the first time, a comparative analysis of the effect of ultra-low concentrations of amino-functionalized POSS with different numbers of primary and/or secondary amino groups covalently bonded to CER-based polymer networks on basic properties of resulting nanocomposites was completed. Improvement of thermal, mechanical, and gas transport properties was evidenced. It was found that the addition of a small quantity (0.1 wt.%) of amino-POSS chemically grafted to the CER network led to a significant increase in the thermal stability of the CER matrix. Namely, the degradation temperature onset, Td onset, and the temperature of maximal degradation rate, Td max, shifted to higher temperatures by \u224812\u201315 \u00b0\u0421, depending on the type of amino-POSS. The significant growth of glass transition and \u03b1 relaxation temperatures, Tg and T\u03b1, by 45\u201355 \u00b0\u0421 of the CER matrix with the loading of nanofillers was demonstrated by means of DSC and DMTA, respectively.

Namely, the degradation temperature onset, Td onset, and the temperature of maximal degradation rate, Td max, shifted to higher temperatures by\u224812\u201315 \u25e6C, depending on the type of amino-POSS. The significant growth of glass transition and \u03b1 relaxation temperatures, Tg and T\u03b1, by 45\u201355 \u25e6C of the CER matrix with the loading of nanofillers was demonstrated by means of DSC and DMTA, respectiv ly. The ssential increase in storage mo ulus valu s in the temperature region investigated was observed as well. Formation of looser structures in hybrid CER-based nanocomposite networks was also confirmed by increasing \u2206Cp (DSC data) and increasing Mc values (DMTA data) with incorporation of amino-POSS nanoparticles into the CER network. It was shown that CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites possessed specific surface area, gas permeability (CO2, He), and d ffusion coefficients (CO2 and H2O at low ac vity) higher than that for neat CER. The efficiency of amino-functionalized POSS in improving the thermal and gas transport properties of the CER/amino-POSS nanocomposites increased\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4654 14 of 19\nin a raw of POSS containing one primary amino group (APIB-POSS) < eight secondary amino groups (NPAP-POSS) < one secondary and one primary amino groups (AEAPIBPOSS). APIB-POSS had the least strong effect, since it could form covalent bonds with CER network only by reaction of one \u2013NH2 group. NPAP-POSS could connect to the CER network through reaction of 8 \u2013NH\u2013 groups but reactivity of \u2013NH\u2013 groups was quite low, so its effect was slightly diminished. AEAPIB-POSS had the strongest effect, since it could easily be incorporated into the CER network via reaction of one \u2013NH2 and one \u2013NH\u2013 groups with \u2013O\u2013C\u2261N groups of CER.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, O.G., A.F. and D.G.; methodology, O.G., E.E. and A.F.; validation, E.E., D.S. and O.S.; investigation, O.S., D.S., F.G. and A.R.d.A.; formal analysis, O.G., A.F., O.S. and D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, O.S., E.E. and A.R.d.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, O.G., A.F. and D.G.; visualization, D.S. and F.G.; supervision, A.F. and D.G.; project administration, A.F. and D.G.
