    "abstractText": "Highly efficient indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based yellow light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with low efficiency droop have always been pursued for next-generation displays and lighting products. In this work, we report an InGaN quantum barrier (QB) with linear-increase In-composition along [0001] direction for InGaN-based yellow LEDs. With the In-composition in QBs systematically engineered, three QB structures including linear-increase QB (LIQB), linear-decrease QB (LDQB) and commonly used flat QB (FQB) were investigated by simulation. The results show that the LIQB not only yields enhanced electron confinement, but also contributes to suppressed polarization field. Consequently, the yellow LED incorporated with LIQBs demonstrates improved radiative recombination rates and the efficiency droop is alleviated. Under a current density of 100 A/cm2, the efficiency droop ratios of LEDs with FQBs, LDQBs and LIQBs are 58.7%, 62.2% and 51.5%, respectively. When current density varies from 1 A/cm2 to 60 A/cm2, the blueshift values of peak emission wavelength for LEDs with FQBs, LDQBs and LIQBs are 14.4 nm, 16.5 nm and 13.0 nm, respectively. This work is believed to provide a feasible solution for high-performance InGaN-based LEDs in long-wavelength spectral region.",

            "text": "Indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have developed over decades and demonstrated extensive potential in solid-state lighting and highresolution displays [1\u20136]. The wide emission spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared can be achieved through modulating the In composition in multiple quantum wells (MQWs). Moreover, the color mixing of red/green/blue emitters is seen to be promising for highresolution full-color displays [7\u20139]. However, there is still a challenge to obtain efficient LEDs emitting in green-yellow region. While the efficiency of blue and red LEDs exceeds 80% and 50%, respectively, InGaN-based yellow LEDs exhibit unsatisfactory quantum efficiency [10\u201312]. This phenomenon is commonly referred to be the \u201cgreen-yellow gap\u201d and limits the large-scale application of yellow LEDs [13]. The increment of In concentration in InxGa1\u2212xN quantum well (QW) in yellow LEDs can be involved with this efficiency gap [14]. With the high In-content in QWs, lattice mismatch inevitably becomes severe between the InGaN QW layer and GaN quantum barrier (QB). This eventually gives rise to internal electrostatic fields and a quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) along the growth direction [15,16]. The optoelectronic performance of yellow LEDs degenerates for the reason that the QCSE brings a drop in electron-hole wavefunction overlap, further deteriorating the radiative recombination rate in yellow LEDs [17]. More importantly, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of LEDs decreases drastically as the operating current density increases [18]. This problem is the so-called \u201cefficiency droop\u201d, which is a crucial issue for InGaN-based LEDs, especially yellow LEDs [19]. The separation of carrier wavefunction\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8649. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15238649 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8649 2 of 9\narising from strong polarization effects is supposedly one of the main causes, although it is not the only explanation [20,21]. Many approaches focusing on polarization manipulation have been proven effective in addressing the QCSE, and the efficiency droop ratio can be reduced. For example, some numerical analyses have proved that novel MQW structures, such as graded QWs [22], staggered QWs [23] and triangular QWs [24], are effective in boosting the luminous efficiency. Because of this, the detrimental impact of polarization mismatch, that is, the poor carrier injection into MQWs, can be countered to some extent. In experiments, to relieve the in-plane residual stress and improve the crystal quality of InGaN alloys, semipolar and nonpolar GaN films are selected as the substrates on which InGaN/GaN MQWs are grown [25]. The reasonably high cost of these materials cannot be ignored, despite the low density of defects and advanced device performance [26]. Furthermore, the parameters of QB also serve a major role in electric field modulation, carrier distribution and crystal quality across the MQWs [27,28]. Nevertheless, efforts to the effect of QB modifications on yellow emission are currently inadequate and therefore the corresponding mechanisms are worth further investigation. Here, we have proposed a bandgap-engineering strategy to alleviate the polarization effect for InGaN-based yellow LEDs. By adopting an In-composition linear-increase QB (LIQB) in yellow LEDs, the electron leakage is significantly reduced compared to LEDs with In-composition linear-decrease QB (LDQB) and flat QB (FQB). The specially designed LIQB structure can effectively mitigate the QCSE induced from the polarization of electric fields. As a result, the yellow LED with LIQBs earns facilitated radiative efficiency and bears a less severe efficiency droop. Moreover, in the yellow LED with LIQBs, a relatively moderate blueshift of peak emission wavelength is observed."

The device structure of an LED with LDQBs (denoted as sample B) and sample A are identical except for each QB, which has linear-decrease In-composition from 0.06 to 0 along [0001] direction. Similarly, the LED with LIQBs (denoted as sample C) possesses an identical epitaxial structure other than nine InGaN QBs. The In-composition of QBs in sample C increases linearly from 0 to 0.06 along [0001] direction. Figure 1 is the schematic representation for the yellow LED epitaxial structures of the three samples. Numerical calculations were conducted by the SiLENSe version 5.14 software [29] to analyze the device properties of LEDs with three different QB structures.

According to the Equations (2) and (3), we can safely deduce that the polarization-induced electric field is alleviated in sample C but that the polarization effect of sample B becomes even more severe. This phenomenon is obviously indicated in Figure 3d. From Figure 3d, it can be observed that sample C shows the weakest electric fields in MQWs when compared to sample A and sample B. Thanks to the polarizationinduced bulk charge in LIQBs, the polarization electric field is manipulated, and thus QCSE is self-screened. In general, reduced internal electric field in MQWs can contribute\nto the increasing electron-hole wavefunction. The calculated electron-hole wavefunction\noverlap integrals in each QW for sample A, sample B and sample C are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, the carrier wavefunction overlap of sample C is the highest among the three samples due to the mitigation of QCSE. As a result, the radiative recombination rate of sample C is substantially boosted, although a considerable improvement in carrier concentration is not attained in sample C.

As shown in Figure 4, the maximum IQE values of sample A, sample B and sample C are 73.2%, 70.1% and 76.8%, respectively. This is consistent with the radiative recombination rate in the MQWs of the three samples. More significantly, at 100 A/cm2, the efficiency droop ratios of sample A, sample B and sample C are 58.7%, 62.2% and 51.5%, respectively. Based on our previous discussions, the excellent performance in efficiency droop of sample C is mainly ascribed to the enhanced radiative efficiency. Among the three sets of LED samples, sample C with LIQBs has the highest radiative recombination rate in MQWs. The suppressed QCSE in sample C definitely contributes to the overlap probability of electrons and holes.

            "text": "To summarize, LIQBs were proposed and numerically investigated for highly efficient InGaN-based yellow LEDs. The device characteristics, including energy band, carrier concentration, radiative recombination rate, electric field, IQE and emission spectrum, have been extensively investigated in simulation. As compared to LEDs with FQBs and LIQBs, the yellow LED with LIQBs demonstrates boosted electron concentration and radiative recombination rates. Our analysis indicates that the polarization effect and QCSE can be eliminated by utilizing the LIQB structure. Therefore, the efficiency droop is less severe, and the blueshift of peak wavelength becomes relatively moderate in LEDs with LIQBs. Our unique LIQB design is suggested to provide a new insight into InGaN-based LEDs emitting in long wavelength.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.Z.; methodology, S.C., G.T. and S.Z.; formal analysis, S.C. and G.T.; investigation, S.C., G.T., L.G. and S.Z.; data curation, S.C. and G.T.; resources, S.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, G.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.T., L.G., X.Z. and S.Z.; supervision, S.Z.; project administration, S.Z.; funding acquisition, S.Z.
