    "abstractText": "The expression and cellular mechanisms of programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1) and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in renal cancer cells are not well known. Here, we aimed to investigate the response of renal carcinoma subtypes to the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and its impact on related signaling pathways. All cell lines analyzed (clear cell (cc)RCC (Caki-1, RCC31) and papillary (p)RCC (ACHN, RCC30)) expressed PD-1 and both ccRCC cell lines, and RCC30 expressed PD-L1. Nivolumab treatment at increasing doses led to increased PD-1 levels in analyzed cells and resulted in aggressive behavior of pRCC but diminished this behavior in ccRCC. The analysis of PD-1/PD-L1-associated signaling pathways demonstrated increased AKT activity in Caki-1 and RCC30 cells but decreased activity in ACHN and RCC31 cells, while ribosomal protein S6 remained largely unchanged. Androgen receptors are related to RCC and were predominantly increased in RCC30 cells, which were the only cells that formed nivolumab-dependent spheroids. Finally, all cell lines exhibited a complex response to nivolumab treatment. Since the pRCC cells responded with increased tumorigenicity and PD-1/PD-L1 levels while ccRCC tumorigenicity was diminished, further studies are needed to improve nivolumab-based therapy for renal carcinoma subtypes, especially the identification of response-involved molecular pathways.",

            "text": "Kidney cancer is one of the most common cancers, as more than 403,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, which accounts for 2.2% of all newly diagnosed cancers worldwide [1]. The two most common variants, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), originate from proximal tubule epithelial cells and display morphological differences [2,3]. The clinical prognosis of patients with pRCC is better than that of patients with ccRCC, who may develop metastasis to the lung, liver, bones or lymph nodes [2,3]. Tumor expansion is complex. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has transformed therapeutic options in oncology by inhibiting the survival of tumor cells through the escape from immunological destruction. Nivolumab, an agent that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), is approved for the treatment of many cancers, including renal carcinoma (RCC). As with other therapies, many patients experience a good quality of life during treatment; however, some patients can experience immune-related adverse events, which can induce atypical responses, such as hyperprogressive disease or pseudoprogressive disease, and increase the mortality risk [4\u20136]. To improve quality of life, the efficacy of combined therapy (example TKI/PD-1/PD-L1) was tested [7]. For a long time, it was believed that the PD-1 expression was limited to mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes, while its ligands were primarily expressed by tumors. Recently, Wang et al. [8] described an analysis of the intrinsic expression of PD-1 in different tumors, including renal carcinoma. Little information has been reported on the signaling pathways\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 3244. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10123244 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 3244 2 of 14\nof PD-1/PD-L1 molecules. As reviewed by Han et al. [9], the silencing of cell-intrinsic PD-1 results in higher proliferation of the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines NCI-H1299 and Calu-1 as well as increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) (p-AKT) and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) (p-ERK). This suggests the involvement of pathways similar to those of T-cells [8] and indicates that intrinsic PD-1 is a potential tumor suppressor [9]. In melanoma cells, PD-L1 signaling is correlated with AKT and S6 protein phosphorylation, which suggests the activation of the mTOR pathway. The incidence of RCC is higher in men than in women, which implies the participation of steroid hormones in tumor development. It has been suggested that supportive treatment based on steroid receptor signaling pathways should be considered for renal carcinoma [10]. Expression of androgen receptor (AR) was analyzed in many tumors [11\u201316] supplying information about tumor growth, survival time [12] and advancement for antiandrogen therapy [17]. The relationship between AR and RCCs was analyzed in many studies. Among others, AR has been considered as a marker of indolent RCC and is associated with tumor-suppressive activity [10]. However, its role in RCC is still controversial. In their review, Czarnecka et al. [10] discuss the utility of AR in the prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of RCC. The authors describe AR as a favorable marker in RCC that is correlated with a low stage or grade as well as with primary tumor tissues rather than metastases. However, many reports present opposed results [18\u201320]. In our previous studies, we found that AR was differentially expressed in different types of RCC [21]. In many gender disparity tumors, such as HCC or thyroid, AR bind the PD-L1 promotor and so downregulates PD-L1 expression [22,23]. Guan et al. [24] noted that blocking AR and PD-L1 correlated with a reduction in prostate tumor growth, which provides a connection between androgens and therapy resistance. Additionally, cathepsin B (Cath B) is correlated with therapy resistance [25], and overexpression of this protease is associated with invasive phenotypes of many cancers [26]; moreover, this protein has been demonstrated to have a tumor-protective role [27]. This is why its expression was analyzed as a marker of the effectiveness of several therapies [26]. In our study, we investigated the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in two ccRCC and two pRCC cell lines and the functional response of these cells to the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. Furthermore, we tested the expression of proteins such as AR as well as the typical ones of signaling pathways that were previously identified as related to PD-1/PD-L1 cascades."

The PD-L1 as a marker for the treatment outcomes seems to be dependent on tumor type or histologic class [30]. PD-1 was described for the first time in murine hematopoietic progenitor and murine T- hybridoma cell lines in 1992 [31]. As reviewed by Han et al. [9], this immune response\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 3244 10 of 14\ninhibitor is present in activated T-cells, natural killer cells and B lymphocytes as well as macrophages, dendritic cells and monocytes. PD-1 binds PD-L1 on cancer cells and initiates the immune escape of tumor cells. This process can be blocked with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, which bind PD-1 and prevent the interaction with PD-L1. Recently, intrinsic tumor expression of PD-1 was described in various cancer cells [32\u201334], including renal cancer [8]. Wang et al. [8] demonstrated PD-1 transcripts in four renal cancer cell lines (ACHN, Caki-1, 769-P, 786-O). In our study, we observed PD-1 protein in ACHN and Caki-1 cells as well as in the two in-house established cell lines RCC30 (pRCC) and RCC31 (ccRCC). In papillary RCC, PD-1 expression is constant when PD-L1 expression is weak (RCC30) or absent (ACHN). In contrast, the clear cell carcinoma cell lines Caki-1 and RCC31 strongly express both proteins. Our study shows that exposure of tumor cells to increasing concentrations of nivolumab seems to downregulate the PD-1 expression and partially downregulate PD-L1 in ccRCC, but seems to increase PD-1 expression in pRCC. This partly coincides with our analysis of the metabolic activity in cells treated with nivolumab. At high concentrations, we observed a reduction in WST-1 generation in ccRCC cells but an increase in pRCC cells. The results obtained in our study suggest the activation of intrinsic PD-1 without the necessary involvement of PD-L1 in papillary RCCs. This lead probably to the initiation of still not known signaling cascades, which induce aggressive behavior of the cells. Lately, the results of open-label phase IIIb/IV CheckMate 374 study established monotherapy with nivolumab as the treatment option for advanced nccRCC. From the pRCC patients of the cohort and only one demonstrated partial response (PR), 9\u2014stable disease but 11\u2014progressive disease [35]. In other studies, in combination with ipilimumab treatment (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) also only 1/18 pRCC patients responded complete (CR) for the treatment, when 4/18 were PR [36]. Du et al. [33] observed that the NSCLC cell line M109 xenotransplanted into mice demonstrated increased viability associated with exposure to anti-PD-1 blockade. Kleffel et al. [32] and Wang et al. [8], however, noticed suppression of melanoma and lung tumor cell growth, respectively, after antibody blockade. Interestingly, the PD-1 protein differed significantly in the size and number of detected bands (~55 kDa [8] and ~32 kDa [32]) between the two studies. The results of Denize et al. [37] raise the possibility that PD-L1 expression in ccRCC cancer cells might require intrinsic pro-oncogenic signals from tumor cells. When coexpressed in tumors, PD-L1 can activate intrinsic PD-1 in an immune-independent manner and thus modulate signaling cascades in tumor cells [38]. Considering the differential intrinsic expression and potentially differential PD-1/PD-L1 interaction intensity within the two (clear and papillary) types of renal carcinoma, one could speculate the activation of different signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT, MAPK, mTOR). The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is implicated in the development of many human malignancies, including RCC [37]. The PD-1/PD-L1 cascade is thought to be involved in the initiation of mTOR signaling. Intrinsic PD-1, activated by PD-L1, activates mTOR [38], while the inhibition of mTOR increases the level of PD-L1 [39]. Kleffel et al. [32] also demonstrated a positive influence of PD-1 on the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), a downstream signaling target of mTOR and marker of its activity, which is associated with poor prognosis in renal cancer [40] and many other cancers [41,42]. In our study, nivolumab did not change the level of pS6 in three cell lines. We detected higher S6 activity levels after nivolumab treatment only in Caki-1 cells. Moreover, contrary to PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, the increase in S6 was noticed at higher concentrations of nivolumab treatment. Additionally, we could not detect PD-L1 protein in the ACHN cell line in the presence of pS6 and increasing levels of PD-1. To implicate this signaling pathway in the treatment of RCC, additional investigations, such as determining the PD-L1 promoter activity or the perturbance of PD-L1 degradation, are planned. The analysis of AKT activity revealed that in ACHN cells, the ratio of pAKT/AKT was decreased, while in Caki-1 cells, this ratio was elevated. The significance of AKT activity in tumor development is controversial. Since some investigators indicate a relationship\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 3244 11 of 14\nbetween pAKT, poor differentiation and lymph node (LN) metastasis [43], others provide evidence for the association of pAKT with high differentiation and no LN metastasis [44]. In addition, the correlation of pAKT with PD-1 was also investigated. Wang et al. [8] observed an increase in pAKT after the knockdown of PDCD1 (PD-1 coding gene) and a decrease after overexpression by stable phosphorylation of the S6 protein. In their analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Dong et al. [45] described a correlation between PD-L1 and pAKT expression with clinicopathological characteristics. The detection of both proteins in tumors significantly reduced the positive prognosis of the patients compared with patients whose tumors expressed only one of the proteins. The authors suggest using a combination of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies together with AKT/mTOR inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach for DLBCL. In our study, three cell lines (Caki-1, RCC30 and RCC31) express both proteins when by ACHN PD-L1 is absent. In their manuscript, Guan et al. [24] proposed that androgens may be responsible for therapy resistance in advanced prostate cancer patients. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the blockade of both AR and PD-L1 reduces tumor growth and that the inhibition of AR improves T-cell function. Our previous analysis showed differences in the frequency of AR-FL expression and that of its splice variant between ccRCC and normal tissues. We also observed an increased AR expression in pRCC compared with ccRCC [21]. Our current study confirms this observation but only for the in-house established cell lines. In our case, the cell line with the highest AR expression was pRCC30. In further experiments, we tested the abilities of the cell lines to form aggregates. Both clear-cell carcinoma cells and ACHN cells formed masses with low cell-cell adhesion, but only RCC30 cells formed spheroids whose growth was dependent on nivolumab. In 2D culture, RCC30 displayed higher expression of AR than the other cell lines. However, still no evidence indicates a relationship between AR and spheroid formation. Nevertheless, Niture et al. [46] described an increased ability of prostate cancer cells to create spheroids after microRNA-99b-5p silencing, which was accompanied by the upregulation of the AR axis. However, the relationship between AR expression and spheroid formation remains open. Another aspect is that the growth of cells in a 3D structure may enforce morphological and transcriptional changes or hinder the diffusion of nutrients or drugs (such as nivolumab), which can influence protein expression. These questions require further investigation. Transcriptome analysis of the treated spheroids is the next step to analyze the influence of nivolumab on RCC cells. As mentioned previously, some patients treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can induce atypical responses, such as hyperprogressive disease (HPD) or pseudoprogressive disease [4\u20136]. A protein implicated in the prevention of the cytotoxic effects of many drugs is cathepsin B [47]. Increased expression of cathepsin B in RCC indicates its role in tumor progression [48]. Our results show that even if Cath B is expressed and active (except in ACHN cells) in RCC, nivolumab did not influence the expression or activity of this protein. This suggests its limited role in processes initiated by this immune checkpoint inhibitor blockade. According to the S3 guideline renal cell carcinoma (S3-Leitlinie Nierenzellkarzinom) and international guidelines [49] nivolumab can be used as the first-line medicament in combination with other medicaments (ipilimumab, cabozantinib) or as the second-line therapy after the failure of the VEGF/R- or mTOR-based treatment. It is known that VEGFR TKIs affect the protein expression pattern of tumor cells [25] and metabolic cargo and activity in small extracellular vesicles of RCC [50]. Chen et al. [25] describe increased Cath B expression as a response to TKI. In our study with nivolumab, we did not notice any changes in Cath B expression. Our analysis, however, was performed as a simulation of the monotherapy without previous treatment. It is an intriguing question if previous treatment of our cells with TKI would induce similar changes and if further incubation or coincubation with nivoumab would reduce such differences. This question should be addressed in future studies.\nBiomedicines 2022, 10, 3244 12 of 14"
