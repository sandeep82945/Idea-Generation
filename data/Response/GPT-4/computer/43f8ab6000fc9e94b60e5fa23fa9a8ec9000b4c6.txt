Enhanced Temporal Consistency for Video Generation: Develop methods to improve the temporal consistency of generated talking faces in videos, especially under sudden movements or changes in expression. This could involve innovative strategies for frame-by-frame generation that reduce error propagation and enhance the smooth transition between frames, potentially leveraging advanced temporal coherence techniques or sequence-to-sequence models.

Real-time Generation and Efficiency Improvements: Focus on increasing the efficiency of the diffusion model to enable real-time talking face generation. This could include research on optimizing the diffusion process, reducing the number of required denoising steps without compromising quality, or developing more efficient model architectures that can operate at higher resolutions with lower computational costs.

High-Resolution and High-Fidelity Face Generation: Explore methods to generate high-resolution talking faces without losing fidelity or introducing artifacts, potentially by integrating techniques from state-of-the-art image generation models like StyleGAN. This could also involve research on how to efficiently train diffusion models on high-resolution data or adapt current methods to support larger image sizes.

Unseen Emotion and Expression Generalization: Investigate ways to further enhance the model's ability to generate faces with unseen emotions or expressions, leveraging rich semantic knowledge. This could involve exploring more advanced text-to-emotion encoding schemes, integrating additional modalities for emotion representation, or using unsupervised learning techniques to discover and generate a broader range of emotional expressions.

Comprehensive Multimodal Fusion for Talking Faces: Conduct research on more sophisticated methods for fusing multiple modalities (text, audio, image, video) in the process of generating talking faces. This could include developing novel architectures that better capture and integrate the nuances of each modality, as well as exploring new types of multimodal datasets for training and evaluation.
