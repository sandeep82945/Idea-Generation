 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a larger scale study with more participants to further validate the effectiveness of the lifting intervention in reducing biomechanical risk factors for injury. The small sample size in this proof-of-concept study limits generalizability.  

2. Test the intervention in actual healthcare settings like hospitals and nursing homes to examine its effectiveness in real-world conditions. The controlled lab environment may not fully replicate the challenges of patient handling in practice.

3. Examine injury rates and musculoskeletal disorders over a longer period of time among healthcare workers who adopt the lifting intervention compared to standard practices. This could more directly assess the impact on reducing injuries.

4. Refine the lifting techniques to target strengthening of the rear deltoids and latissimus dorsi to further optimize body mechanics and reduce strain during movements. The study noted the need to improve activation of these muscle groups.

5. Develop standardized training programs for healthcare workers that incorporate these optimized lifting techniques. Widespread formal training could improve adoption and compliance with proper techniques for injury prevention.
