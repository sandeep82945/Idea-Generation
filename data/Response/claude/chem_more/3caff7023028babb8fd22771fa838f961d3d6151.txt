 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a more in-depth analysis on a larger set of drugs to validate and expand upon the functional group-ADR associations identified in this initial study. Analyze additional ADRs beyond GI and CNS effects. 

2. Investigate the underlying mechanisms of the identified functional group-ADR associations through pharmacological studies, QSAR modeling, etc. to better understand why certain groups are associated with higher or lower ADR rates.

3. Develop computational models utilizing functional group data along with other molecular properties to predict ADR profiles of new drug candidates and aid drug development.

4. Explore whether functional group information could help optimize pharmacotherapy by guiding drug selection and dosage adjustments in individual patients based on their risk factors. 

5. Analyze how functional groups may interact with patient factors like age, genetics, comorbidities etc. to influence ADR susceptibility. This could uncover patient subpopulations more prone to ADRs from certain functional groups.
