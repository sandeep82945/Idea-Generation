Exploration of Zinc and Other Metal Ions in Insulin Polymorphism: Investigating the role of different metal ions (e.g., magnesium, calcium) on insulin polymorphism in addition to zinc could provide insights into their potential effects on insulin structure and stability. This could include examining the impact of varying metal ion concentrations on the formation of insulin hexamers and dimers across different pH conditions.

High-Resolution Structure Determination of Other Insulin Polymorphs: Given the detailed structural analysis of the cubic human insulin polymorph, similar high-resolution studies could be conducted for other insulin polymorphs, such as the T6 and T3Rf3 hexamers. Advanced crystallography techniques and molecular dynamics simulations could be used to elucidate their structures and compare them to the cubic form, enhancing understanding of insulin's conformational flexibility and its implications for insulin-receptor interactions.

Development of pH-Sensitive Insulin Formulations: Based on the observed pH-driven phase transitions of insulin polymorphs, research could focus on developing innovative insulin formulations that exploit these transitions for controlled insulin release. By engineering insulin formulations that respond to physiological pH changes, it may be possible to create more effective and patient-friendly diabetes treatments.

Impact of Thiocyanate and Other Anions on Insulin Structure: Further studies could explore how thiocyanate and other anions influence insulin's structural transitions and oligomerization states. This could involve investigating a wider range of anions, particularly those that might mimic physiological conditions or offer therapeutic benefits, to understand their potential as modulators of insulin activity and stability.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Insulin-Receptor Interactions: Utilizing coarse-grained and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions between various insulin polymorphs (especially the less studied ones) and the insulin receptor could provide new insights into the mechanism of insulin receptor activation. This could help in designing modified insulins with enhanced receptor affinity or specificity, potentially leading to the development of novel insulin analogues with improved pharmacological profiles.
