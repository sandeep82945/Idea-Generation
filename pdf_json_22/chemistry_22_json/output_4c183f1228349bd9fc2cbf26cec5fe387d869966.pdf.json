    "abstractText": "The liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach is a powerful technology for discovering novel biologically active molecules. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profiling of Orchidaceae species using LC-HRMS/MS data combined with chemometric methods and dereplication tools to discover antifungal compounds. We analyze twenty ethanolic plant extracts from Vanda and Cattleya (Orchidaceae) genera. Molecular networking and chemometric methods were used to discriminate ions that differentiate healthy and fungal-infected plant samples. Fifty-three metabolites were rapidly annotated through spectral library matching and in silico fragmentation tools. The metabolomic profiling showed a large production of polyphenols, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, chromones, stilbenoids, and tannins, which varied in relative abundance across species. Considering the presence and abundance of metabolites in both groups of samples, we can infer that these constituents are associated with biochemical responses to microbial attacks. In addition, we evaluated the metabolic dynamic through the synthesis of stilbenoids in fungal-infected plants. The tricin derivative flavonoidand the loliolide terpenoidfound only in healthy plant samples, are promising antifungal metabolites. LC-HRMS/MS, combined with stateof-the-art tools, proved to be a rapid and reliable technique for fingerprinting medicinal plants and discovering new hits and leads.",

            "text": "Orchidaceae is one of the largest and most diverse families in the plant kingdom, with more than 28,000 species and 763 genera [1,2]. Orchidaceae species, popularly known as orchids, are sold commercially for presenting beautiful and diverse flowers and the economically important spice known as vanilla [3]. Many species have been studied for their chemical composition and pharmacological activities, including anticancer, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antivirus, and antimicrobial [3]. Several orchid species are known to produce stilbenoids, phytoalexins responsible for protection against predation and antimicrobial activities [4\u20136]. Orchinol and hircinol are two stilbenoid compounds isolated from the Orchis and Loroglossum genera, respectively, which were reported with antifungal activity and play a role in the defense of orchid tubes [7]. Considering the antifungal activity of the secondary metabolites present in orchids and the low rate of new drug discovery, there is an urgent need to develop fast and efficient methodologies for screening new antimicrobial agents. Since the classic process of screening bioactive natural products is a time-consuming and labor-intensive step, analytical techniques applied to separating and characterizing phytocompounds stand out for their high ability to dereplicate complex samples and detect constituents even at low concentrations that can be useful in planning new drugs [8,9].\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27227937 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 2 of 15\nMass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platforms are established as the technique of choice in metabolomic investigations due to their high selectivity, sensitivity, speed, and versatility in detecting a wide range of analytes with different physicochemical properties. In addition, the development of increasingly sensitive instruments allows the detection of trace-level molecules and provides analysis with sub-ppm mass accuracy that allows describing the molecular formula with high precision based on the mass defect [10,11]. In this way, the high resolving power offered by this new equipment provides essential information for reliable annotation and accurate quantification of metabolites [12]. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry hyphenated to ultra-resolution chromatographic techniques represents one of the most widely employed high-throughput screening technologies in metabolomic approaches and yields greater metabolic coverage in natural product research [11,13\u201315]. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) could offer advantages in the metabolomic analysis, such as its better resolution of the complex sample allowing a good evaluation of molecular diversity content. In addition, it provides more detailed information on the metabolic composition of the samples by some chromatographic parameters such as retention time and peak shape of the analytes, allows comparison with standards improving the confidence level in structural annotations, distinguishing isobaric and isomeric metabolites that are not resolved through the fragmentation pattern and accurate molecular mass [16\u201319]. Numerous applications of LC-HRMS/MS, combined with state-of-the-art tools for structural annotations (such as Classical Molecular Networking [20], Dereplicator+ [21], Network Annotation Propagation [22], and Moldiscovery [23]), are reported in the literature, and many findings obtained from their applications have boosted analytical research throughout and metabolites coverage. This approach has been widely employed to annotate flavonoids and selaginellins of the roots and shoots from Selaginella convolute [24]; phenolic compounds of the leaves and seeds from Erythrina velutina [25]; several metabolites, including four phenanthrene with the antinociceptive activity of the roots from Laelia anceps and Cyrtopodium macrobulbon [26]; several flavonoids and alkaloids of the bulbs and flowers from Fritillaria thunbergii [27]; various compounds of the leaves, stems and roots from Peperomia pellucida, including compounds annotated for the first time for the genus [28]; and unique cassaine-type diterpenoids of the leaves from Erythrophleum suaveolens and E. ivorense, which were employed to distinguish morphologically-close species [29]. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the presence and abundance of secondary metabolites in healthy and fungal-infected plants from the Orchidaceae family to select potential antimicrobial candidates and a metabolic dynamic assessment. The metabolite production of ten species of Orchidaceae belonging to the genera Vanda and Cattleya was evaluated using tandem mass spectral libraries, in silico fragmentation tools, and chemometric methods from MS data obtained by Orbitrap LC-MS."

            "text": "In this work, we used ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography to investigate the metabolic dynamic of healthy and fungal-infected plants of the same botanical family to identify substances with antifungal properties. Metabolome-based antifungal screening approach was evaluated in twelve species of the Orchidaceae family by evaluating the spectral similarity of samples and applying chemometric methods. Initially, the ions were discriminated using data mining and organization tools from the GNPS\u2014Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/ (accessed on 16 August 2022) platform, and the structural annotation of the metabolites was based on accurate mass (m/z), MS/MS fragmentation pattern, chromatographic retention time, and chemotaxonomy data from Orchidaceae family. We used metadata and data mining tools according to the GNPS platform documentation, and the structural information and metabolic coverage data were inspected in detail. All library hits classified as gold (thoroughly characterized as struc-\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 3 of 15\ntures), silver (compound crude extract), and bronze (partial annotation) [20] were evaluated, and chemophenetics data from the Orchidaceae family confirmed the metabolic annotation. The structural annotation of the metabolites was confirmed through the analysis of candidates and their analogs suggested by the natural products databases, reference mass spectral libraries, and spectral similarity networks resulting in level 2 identification according to the Metabolomic Standard Initiative-MSI [30]. Lyophilized extracts from two groups of samples (healthy and fungal-infected plants) of species of the genus Vanda (five samples) and Cattleya (five samples) were submitted to the evaluation of the presence of metabolites through metabolite annotations were based on searching the experimental spectra against the GNPS spectral library using the tools Classical Molecular Networking\u2014MN [20], Dereplicator+ [21], Network Annotation Propagation\u2014NAP [22], Moldiscovery [23], MS2LDA [31], MolNetEnhancer [32], and analysis of chromatographic data such as retention time and UV spectra unit of absorbance. The ion abundance assessment was performed using the Feature-Based Molecular Networking\u2014FBMN [33] tool obtained from MS/MS data in positive ionization mode (ESI(+)). Annotations with high spectral similarity were prioritized, resulting in the structural annotation of 50 compounds."

            "text": "To obtain hits with higher structural similarity and the biosynthetic origin within molecular families from molecular networking, the threshold for the cosine score similarity was set to 0.7. LC-HRMS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics approaches showed a considerable variation in compounds mainly belonging to the class of secondary metabolites of the flavonoids, stilbenoids, phenolic acids, chromones, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids. Dereplication methodologies have been extensively applied in plant metabolomics and provided the structural annotation of fifty-three metabolites belonging to different classes of natural products in aglycone and heteroside form. However, most putatively annotated polyphenols were classified as heterosides, mainly glycosylated flavonoids. Among the fifty-three compounds annotated, 35 metabolites were annotated as flavonoids (22 flavones, 7 flavonols, 1 flavanone, and 5 isoflavones) and 10 stilbenoids. Regarding the phenols class, 10 compounds were annotated, being 50% cinnamic acids derivatives. Among the 20 terpenoids detected, were annotated 9 diterpenoids, 2 monoterpenoids, 7 sesquiterpenoids, and 2 triterpenoids. The library matches showed alkaloids (8) classified as tryptophan alkaloids (1), anthranilic acid alkaloids (3), nicotinic acid alkaloids (3), and histidine alkaloids (1). Other oxygenated aromatic metabolites belonging to the coumarins (5), anthraquinones (1), xanthones (1), and chromones (1) classes were found in low abundance (Figure 1). Furthermore, a wide array of primary metabolites was detected in all samples, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. The library matches using the classical molecular network (MN) from Cattleya and Vanda genera assessment in both physiological conditions (healthy and fungal-infected) yielded a total of 1.220 hits with 315 unique library compounds. We found 60 hits with a high confidence level, a high number of hits with gold classification, represented by spectral similarity greater than 90% (cosine score > 0.9), mz error (ppm) less than 5, and a high amount of shared peaks in the MS/MS spectrum. The analysis of the candidates suggested by the spectral library after inspection of the profile of MS/MS fragmentation patterns, evaluation of high-resolution calculation of empirical formula, and chromatographic analysis data, yielded the compounds described in Table 1. All the annotated metabolites have been previously described in the Orchidaceae family [34,35]. From the MS/MS fragmentation pattern analysis, it was observed that the O-glycosylated phenolic compounds were more abundant than the C-glycosylated compounds. O-glycosylated flavonoids exhibited a neutral loss of a sugar moiety, which corresponds to a loss of 162 Da for hexosides, 146 Da for deoxyhexosides and 132 Da for pentosides. The O-glycosylated flavonoids Rutin (C27H30O16), Saponarin (C27H30O15), Isovitexin 2\u2032\u2032-O-arabinoside (C26H28O14),\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 4 of 15\nIsoschaftoside (C26H28O14), Tricin 5-glucoside (C23H24O12), Isorhamnetin 3-galactoside (C22H22O12), Hyperoside (C21H20O12), and Isovitexin (C21H20O10) were identified by the consecutive losses of sugar moieties, and the flavonoids aglycone Acacetin, 4\u2032-Methoxy6-methylflavone, and Liquiritigenin were identified by fragments originating from retro Diels\u2013Alder reactions, and data from chromatographic analysis such as UV spectra and retention times. In addition, it was possible to perform structure-based propagation and guided detection of phenolic compounds not annotated by the spectral library. The stilbenoids Rhapontin, Erianin, 3-O-Methylgigantol, Gigantol, Dendrosinene B, Tristin, 3\u2032-O-Methylbatatasin III, 3-[2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-5-methoxyphenol, and Thunalbene, metabolites found in both Vanda and Cattleya genera, were putatively annotated through accurate mass precursor and characteristic product ions such as consecutive losses of C2H2O and methoxyl groups.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 5 of 15\nTo narrow the focus to identify metabolites with antifungal potential using the strategy of investigating the metabolome of healthy plants compared with the metabolome of fungal-infected plants from the Cattleya and Vanda genera, we eliminate metabolites common to all species. The two set plants shared about 75% of their metabolome. Healthy plant species exhibited a richness of secondary metabolites (approximately 60% of hits) compared to fungal-infected plants (approximately 40% of hits), evidencing the role of these metabolites in defense against microbial attack. The attack of pathogens on plants generates a biochemical response. Therefore, the production of these chemical constituents in infected plants belonging to the same genus or species may be suppressed by environmental factors [36\u201338]. In addition, the quantitative alterations of these metabolites may also be a consequence of environmental stimuli, explaining the low abundance of some compounds in plants of the same species affected by microbiological attacks. Moreover, other factors, such as nutrient and water availability in the soil, can influence metabolic pathways and considerably affect the synthesis of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial action [39,40]. The chromatographic profile and molecular networking show subtle differences between the sample groups for both species analyzed under the same chromatographic and spectrometric conditions (Figure 2).\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 6 of 15\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 16\nFigure 1.

We used metadata to organize compound information according to the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) online workflow (https: //ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/ (accessed on 16 August 2022). Metabolite annotations were based on searching the experimental spectra against the GNPS spectral library using the tools Classical Molecular Networking\u2014MN [20], FeatureBased Molecular Networking\u2014FBMN [33], DEREPLICATOR+ [21], Network Annotation Propagation\u2014NAP [22], MOLDISCOVERY [23], MS2LDA [31], MolNetEnhancer [32], and analysis of chromatographic data such as retention time and UV spectra."

The obtained .raw files were converted into .cdf format and imported to Matlab R2020a (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA), where all chemometric tools were applied. An exploratory data analysis was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) [50] to visualize the Vanda and Cattleya genus and healthy and fungal-infected samples in multidimensional space. PCA was carried out on the normalized and autoscale dataset with twenty samples and 1,021,894 variables (m/z 80 to 1200). Additionally, partial least squares for discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) [51], a classification method based on PLS regression, was applied in healthy and fungal-infected samples. The ordered predictors selection (OPS) [52], a variable selection method adapted for classification, was applied to find the more essential and interpretative variables for healthy and fungal-infected classification."

            "text": "In this study, we presented the application of the integrated metabolomics approach and the state-of-the-art computational tools to provide acute insights regarding the characterization of phytochemicals of healthy and fungal-infected leaves from Vanda and Cattleya species. The data analysis pipelines of untargeted metabolomics analysis enabled the characterization of a considerable variation in compounds belonging primarily to the class of flavonoids, phenolic acids, chromones, stilbenoids, tannins, terpenoids, and steroids. Flavonoids were identified as the major compounds in both species independent of the physiological condition (healthy or fungal-infected). The flavonoids afrormosin, acacetin, and stilbenoids were found chiefly in fungal-infected plants, while nitrogen compounds were found predominantly in samples from healthy plants. The tricin derivative flavonoid, and the loliolide terpenoid were found only in healthy plants. From the dereplication and in silico fragmentation tools, 202 and 145 unique metabolites were detected in healthy, and fungal-infected Cattleya leaves. For the genus Vanda, 166 and 146 unique metabolites were detected in healthy and fungal-infected leaves. The integrated metabolomics approach and the combination of structural annotation, data mining, and chemometric tools could be applied as a reference dataset for MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis of\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7937 13 of 15\nspecies from the Orchidaceae. In addition, based on the interesting results shown in the present study, the model data on the molecular annotation adopted here may be further explored with high efficiency through other species from the Orchidaceae family.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.S.L., N.M.L., G.F.d.S. and B.G.V.; methodology, G.S.L., G.F.d.S., N.M.L., D.V.A.d.A., J.V.A.O. and J.V.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, G.S.L., N.M.L. and J.V.R.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.d.S.
