Traditional measures of RAN tests only take into account the naming time and accuracy and cannot reflect temporal-spatial features during RAN tests. Although the eye tracking approach appears to be a promising tool for characterizing the essential temporal-spatial characteristics of RAN tests, no research has been conducted to investigate whether and how gender, age, and task-type alter those characteristics. Additionally, no study has examined eye movements during a Chinese adaptation of RAN in order to expand the applicability of RAN to developmental dyslexia in Chinese. To address the concerns stated above, this article recruited 408 children (206 males, aged 7\u201311 years) and adopted eight measures to quantify features of eye movements during a Chinese adaptation of RAN. Findings showed that: (1) eight eye-movement measures had the main effects of task-type and age, but only five of them had the main effect of gender (in particular, females outperformed males); (2) RAN abilities observed by eight eye-movement measures initially developed quickly before the age of 9, and then entered a relatively sluggish development phase; (3) non-alphanumeric RAN tasks generally required higher mental load (implying more fixation counts, saccade counts, and regression counts, smaller average saccade amplitude, fixation duration fluctuation and saccade amplitude fluctuation, and longer average fixation duration and total time of naming) than alphanumeric ones; (4) there were significant correlations between total time of naming (a widely-used behavioral parameter) and other eye-movement measures; and (5) there were significant correlation between eight eye-movement measures and three attention-related skills observed from a number cancellation task. The current study might offer some perspectives on the understanding of normative data of eye movements during RAN in Chinese school-aged children, as well as the applications (e.g., developmental dyslexia) associated with RAN.\nKEYWORDS\ndevelopmental dyslexia, rapid automatized naming, eye tracking, school - aged children, reading abilities\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tests (1\u201312) have been proposed to evaluate an individual\u2019s ability to read letters, digits, objects, or other visual stimuli such as colors or geometric shapes as quickly as possible. These RAN tasks were initially used in studies on reading behavior and child development in healthy children, but they have gradually become recognized as a popular and useful psychometric test for identifying a variety of cognitive and neurobiological abnormalities, including developmental dyslexia (13\u201315), specific language impairment (16), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (17), learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (18, 19). In particular, findings (16, 20\u201324) have demonstrated that the RAN deficits may more accurately describe the characteristics of developmental dyslexia than other cognitive skill deficits. The goal of the current study was to offer some new perspectives on how to understand RAN more fully.\nTraditional measures of RAN tests only take into account the naming time and accuracy and cannot reflect dynamical temporal-spatial features during RAN tests. While eye tracking techniques can be used to monitor the focus points in sequence and record the essential ocular activities throughout visual cognitive processes. Therefore, eye tracking approach would be a promising tool to characterize the visual cognitive features of RAN. Only a small number of studies (19, 25) have explored the characteristics of eye movements during RAN tests, but none of them have examined whether and how gender, age, and task type alter those characteristics. Additionally, no study has been done to analyze eye movements during a Chinese adaptation of RAN in order to expand the applicability of RAN to developmental dyslexia in Chinese. This study sought to identify the patterns or characteristics of Chinese school-aged children\u2019s eye movements during a Chinese adaptation of RAN (including naming Chinese characters). It should be noted that normative data of eye movement during RAN must be established in order to identify developmental abnormalities connected to RAN from eye movement data. However, thus far, no study has been conducted to establish normative data of eye movements during RAN in school-aged children, especially in China.\nTaken together, we used the eye tracking technique to measure the characteristics of RAN eye movements and identified RAN eye movement characteristics in Chinese children aged 7\u201311 years. We specifically examined the characteristics of eye movements in Chinese children between the ages of 7 and 11 while they named Chinese characters. This is the first time, as far as we are aware, that eye movement characteristics during RAN testing for Chinese\nFrontiers in Pediatrics 02\nchildren aged 7\u201311 have been reported. In order to determine how the gender, age, and task type affect the characteristics of eye movements during RAN, we recruited 408 kids (206 of them were boys, ages 7\u201311). The relationship between eyemovement characteristics was examined. It was also explored how features of eye movements connect to abilities associated with attention."

According to the districts\u2019 rankings of GDP per person in 2020, the districts of Sanmenxia were divided into three levels, i.e., strong economic level (>90,000 RMB), medium economic level (70,000\u201390,000 RMB), weak economic level (<70,000 RMB). In order to prevent bias in sample selection, we randomly selected a district with medium economic level and randomly selected an ordinary primary school locally from the district. This primary school included 1,387 kids (aged 7\u201311). According to the sequence number chosen randomly, a coding number was given to each child who was recruited. We only invited kids whose coding numbers with 3, 6 or 9 in the ones digit were to participate in our experiments.\nExclusion criteria were as follows: (a) abnormal hearing functioning (i.e., hearing threshold levels bigger than 25 dB HL) and vision functioning (i.e., naked or corrected monocular visual acuities below than 1.0); (b) significant sensory or motor impairment; (c) a history of previous neurological or psychiatric disorders; (d) IQ score lower than 85 or bigger than 115; (e) children who had repeated a grade; and (f) incomplete measure data.\nBy steps above, a total of 408 children (206 males) attended the current experiments (see Table 1 for detailed information). This survey complied with the sampling criteria since, according to Weeks\u2019 work (26), the sample size to be obtained in the event of a 95% confidence level and +5% accuracy was calculated to be n = 384.\nfrontiersin.org\nTABLE 1 Demographic characteristics of participants.\nAge groups Males (N, %) Total (N ) Age (years)\n7-years children 33 (50.00) 66 7.55 \u00b1 0.24\n8-years children 45 (47.87) 94 8.46 \u00b1 0.28\n9-years children 45 (54.88) 82 9.43 \u00b1 0.28\n10-years children 31 (45.59) 68 10.41 \u00b1 0.30\n11-years children 52 (53.06) 98 11.50 \u00b1 0.28\nTotal 496 (50.49) 408 N/A"

While, N-object and N-color were nonalphanumeric RAN tasks; N-number and N-character were alphanumeric RAN tasks. For each task, a 5 \u00d7 10 matrix of objects was presented, in which each matrix used five repetitions of each of the ten different objects with the order pseudo-randomized.\nThe subject was situated between 60 and 90 cm away from the 21.5 in.

The Digital Pen\u2019s technical advantage was the use of a smart mini-camera, which was designed to measure temporal-spatial features from the perspective of handwriting kinematics, such as pre-movement time (initiating), movement time (moving pen to a stimulus), drawing time (completing a cancellation), circumference of a drawn curve, real-time spatial positions (trajectory) of drawing, and drawing time sequence.

The fixation duration fluctuation was defined as follows:\nF \u00bc 1 n 1\nXn 1 i\u00bc1 jduration(i\u00fe 1) duration(i)j (1)\nwhere duration(i) is the time length of the i-th fixation.\nWhile, the saccade amplitude fluctuation was defined as\nfollows:\nF \u00bc 1 n 2\nXn 2 i\u00bc1 jdistance(i\u00fe 1) distance(i)j (2)\nwhere distance(i) is the Euclidean distance between the (i + 1)-th and i-th fixation. In summary, this article will examine eight eye-movement measures (parameters).\nMeasures of a number cancellation test Several temporal-spatial parameters can be measured with the Digital Pen (which has an integrated smart mini-camera) during NCT (28). In this study, we selected only three parameters (28) to evaluate individuals\u2019 performance during the NCT. Those parameters were defined as follows.\n(1) Speed of cognitive processing (SpC) was defined as:\nSpC \u00bc M XN\ni\u00bc1 Ri (3)\nwhere M was the amount of numbers in one row (here M = 40); N was the total number of rows to be\nfrontiersin.org\ncircled; Ri \u00bc 1 represented the case if any number in the i-th row has been circled; and Ri \u00bc 0 represented the case if no number in the i-th row had been circled.\n(2) Selective attention (SA) was defined as:\nSA \u00bc 1 T m v m\u00fe o SpC (4)\nwhere O was the amount of omitted targets; v was the number of distractors being circled; and m was the total amount of targets that should be circled; T was the task time (here T = 120); SpC was defined by Equation (1).\n(3) Averaged time of circlings (ATC) was defined as:\nATC \u00bc 1 n Xn\ni\u00bc1 ti (5)\nwhere n was the amount of numbers being circled; and ti was the time to circle the i-th number."

After confirming that our data (i.e., eight eyemovement measures) failed to pass the normality test and variance homogeneity test, we conducted a number of nonparametric ANOVA procedures [i.e., the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) procedures] using ARTool software package (29, 30). Traditional nonparametric statistical tests (like the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, Friedman test, or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) are one-way tests and only permit the analysis of one factor at a time, whereas ARTool can be used to analyze multiple factors nonparametrically (29, 30). Additionally, for post-hoc multiple comparisons, we utilized the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test with the \u201cFDR\u201d approach to control the false discovery rate. The effect size was determined by the parameter r (low effect: 0.1\u2264 r < 0.3; medium effect: 0.3\u2264 r < 0.5; efficient response: r\u2265 0.5).\nPearson\u2019s correlation method was used to calculate the correlation among eight eye-movement measures, as well as the correlation between eight eye-movement features and three parameters of the number cancellation test (28).

It would be interesting to see if there were any correlation differences between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric RAN tasks. Our findings (see Figure 9) showed that while the correlations between 6 pairs of measures (i.e., Nos. 5, 7, 16, 21, and 28 in Table 2) in alphanumeric RAN tasks may be higher than those in non-alphanumeric RAN tasks, the correlations between 12 pairs of measures (i.e., Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, and 26 in Table 2) may be lower in alphanumeric RAN tasks than in non-alphanumeric RAN tasks.\nSome important correlations between pairs of measures were listed as follows: (i) The correlations (corresponding to Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 in Figure 9) between total time of naming and five measures were positive (r between 0.56 and 0.87); the correlation (corresponding to No. 3 Figure 9) between total time of naming and one measures was negative (r between \u22120.68 and \u22120.58); and the correlation (corresponding to No. 7 in Figure 9)\nsures.\no.

            "text": "RAN tests have been utilized extensively in the examination of numerous cognitive and neurobiological disorders (13\u201319), as well as in studies on reading behavior and child development in healthy children (2\u20138). This article aimed to offer some new perspectives on RAN understanding by the eye tracking method, which is able to capture the visual and cognitive characteristics of RAN. To resolve issues with earlier research, this article involved measures of eye movements during RAN tests for Chinese children aged 7\u201311 years. This study\u2019s primary goal was to determine how age, gender, and task type affected measures of eye movements made by Chinese children aged 7\u201311 during RAN. Eight parameters (including two fluctuation parameters proposed in this article) were designed to measure eye movements.\nFirst of all, our findings showed that all eye-movement measures had the main effects of task-type and age, but only five of them (i.e., fixation counts, saccade counts, regression counts, average saccade amplitude, total time of naming) had the main effect of gender. Additionally, three measures (i.e., saccade counts, regression counts, and total time of naming) had interaction effects between task-type and gender, and between age and gender; two measures (i.e., fixation counts and fixation duration fluctuation) had an interaction effect between gender and task-type, only; one measure (i.e., average saccade amplitude) had an interaction effect between age and gender, only.\nOur results confirm that almost all eye-movement measures initially develop quickly before the age of 9, and then enter a relatively sluggish development phase without a ceiling or floor impact for kids between the ages of 7 and 11. In\nfrontiersin.org\nparticular, children aged 7\u201311 years can be roughly separated into three stages for the development of RAN-related skills: 7\u20138 years old, 9\u201310 years old, and 11 years old. This is in line with the widely-used three-stage model in Chinese educational practices, where the low stage corresponds to Grades 1\u20132 (corresponding to children aged 7\u20138), the middle stage corresponds to Grades 3\u20134 (corresponding to children aged 9\u201310), and the high stage corresponds to Grades 5\u20136 (corresponding to children aged 11\u201312 years old).\nIt is well established that females have a faster cognitive and social development up to the end of adolescence than males of the same age. Our results can likewise be used to support this conclusion. Indeed, we demonstrated that females outperformed males in RAN tasks as measured by five eyemovement parameters: fixation counts, saccade counts, regression counts, average saccade amplitude, and total time of naming. Additionally, the fixation duration fluctuation in tasks N-number and N-object was significantly different between males and females, as shown in Figure 5A. We also discovered that there was no gender difference in saccade amplitude fluctuation. Furthermore, almost all measures (except average fixation duration) had an interaction effect between gender and task-type, or between gender and age. These findings might offer some new perspectives on how gender affects children\u2019s cognitive development and neurological and psychiatric disorders connected to RAN.\nRAN tasks can generally be grouped into two categories, i.e., alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric RAN tasks. Naming of numbers, letters, words, or Chinese characters are examples of alphanumeric RAN tasks, whereas naming of colors or objects are examples of non-alphanumeric RAN tasks. Alphanumeric RAN might necessitate primarily phonological processing because the associated linguistic codes of these stimuli are easily available at the surface level (31). While nonalphanumeric RAN appears to necessitate extra steps and need conceptual processing to establish meaning and then the appropriate name code, before phonological processing results in articulating a response (31). This suggests that nonalphanumeric RAN is more complex than alphanumeric RAN and hence generally takes more mental effort. This inference may be supported by our findings that in comparison to alphanumeric RAN tasks, non-alphanumeric RAN tasks generally required more fixation counts, saccade counts, regression counts, smaller average saccade amplitude, smaller fixation duration fluctuation and saccade amplitude fluctuation, and longer average fixation duration and total time of naming. This suggests that eight parameters used in this article may inherit key features of eye movements during RAN tasks, and more importantly, may be able to distinguish between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric RAN.\nThe fluctuation, defined as the sum of absolute first-order differences in Equation (1) or (2), is taken from an earlier work (32), which can be applied to measure the oscillation,\nFrontiers in Pediatrics 14\nvariability, and unpredictability of time series in a variety of nonlinear physical systems. According to the work of Paulson (33), eye movement can be considered as a self-similar nonlinear dynamic process, and thus can be measured using the fluctuation. The eye-movement changes associated with age or task-type may be observed by both fluctuation parameters, as shown in Figures 5, 7. Additionally, the gender differences in tasks N-number and N-object may be reflected in the fixation duration fluctuation, but not in the saccade amplitude fluctuation.\nRather than emphasizing the superiority of the fluctuation definition, this study attempted to employ fluctuation as a supplement to the original measures of eye movements. In fact, we also examined how well the standard deviation performed as a definition of fluctuation and discovered that it had a strong correlation (r\u2019s\u2265 0.85) with our technique (i.e., the sum of absolute first-order differences) for all RAN tasks. It can be easily seen from Figure 9 that the correlations among eight measures of eye movements may be positive, negative and null. Some correlations between two measures may decrease with the task complexity, but some of them may increase with the task complexity. While, two pairs of measures had significant correlations in tasks N-number and N-character, only, but not in other tasks. The principle of assessing total time of naming remains the same, even though it was measured in this study using an eye tracking method that differed from the traditional behavioral methodology. It should be noted that total time of naming was welldocumented in traditional RAN measures. It was fascinating to see if there were any relationships between total time of naming and other RAN measures. Our findings showed that there were highly correlated between total time of naming and other six measures (|r| between 0.56 and 0.87); and there was moderately correlated between total time of naming and saccade amplitude fluctuation (r between \u22120.45 and \u22120.34). This partially supports the effectiveness and feasibility of the eye-movement measures suggested in the current article.\nThe correlations among three count-related measures (i.e., fixation counts, saccade counts, regression counts) were significantly positive (r between 0.74 and 0.91). This implies that internal consistency among three count-related measures was high. Additionally, the correlation between two fixationduration-related measures (i.e., average fixation duration and fixation duration fluctuation) was highly positive in all tasks (r between 0.72 and 0.82).\nFindings (see Tables 4\u20136) showed that there were moderate correlations between eight eye-movement measures and three attention-related skills (p\u2019s < 0.05). This supports the weak correlation but strong dependence between RAN and NCT tasks. The NCT was applied to measure attention-related abilities, which involved cognitive skills in selective and sustained attention, motor inhibition, visuospatial search, planning, organizing, psychomotor speed, intact visual-\nfrontiersin.org\nperception abilities, fine motor coordination, and sensory motor integration (28). On the other hand, both RAN and NCT might share several visual and cognitive neural circuits because they both need a similar \u201cvisual scanning\u201d processing. Additionally, NCT and RAN are associated with \u201cwriting\u201d and \u201creading\u201d, respectively. Hence, it is hypothesized that RAN, in combination with NCT, may bring some new insights into the understanding of developmental dyslexia and learning disabilities (34).\nIt is natural to adopt a Chinese adaptation of RAN in the understanding of developmental dyslexia in Chinese. The difference between both the original RAN and Chinese version is due to the features of Chinese characters: (i) Chinese characters not only have shape and sound attributes like English letters, but also represent meaning; (ii) Chinese characters have no clear form-to-sound conversion rules, so readers need to remember the pronunciation of Chinese characters; and (iii) The visual complexity of Chinese characters are much higher than that of English letters. Consequently, compared with the original RAN, the Chinese adaptation may have higher cognitive complexity, and thus activate a wider range of brain regions (35, 36). To extend the application of RAN to developmental dyslexia in Chinese, we suggested a Chinese adaptation of RAN (i.e., the C-RAN) by substituting Chinese characters (highly-frequently used) for English letters. We expect that the C-RAN should be more suitable in the evaluation of developmental dyslexia in Chinese than the original RAN.\nFuture study will explore a few issues. First, we will explore gender differences in eye-movement measures taken during RAN throughout the lifespan (especially for children older than 11-years). Second, we will examine the possibility that the apparent gender disparities in RAN-related neurological and mental disorders are due to age-related changes in RAN skills. Third, we will detect whether the diagnostic criteria for RAN-related neurological and psychiatric disorders might be biased or poorly specified for one gender and/or grade group. Finally, we will seek a new definition of fluctuation with increased performance."
