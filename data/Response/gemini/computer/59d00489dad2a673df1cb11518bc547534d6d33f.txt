1. **Investigate the use of different self-supervised signals for scale invariance.** The paper proposes using scale as a self-supervised signal for Masked Image Modeling (MIM). However, other self-supervised signals could also be used, such as color, texture, or depth. It would be interesting to compare the performance of SRMAE with other MIM models that use different self-supervised signals.


2. **Explore the use of SRMAE for other low-resolution tasks.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SRMAE for low-resolution digit classification and facial expression classification. However, SRMAE could also be used for other low-resolution tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and video classification. It would be interesting to see how SRMAE performs on these tasks.


3. **Investigate the use of SRMAE for real-world applications.** The paper evaluates SRMAE on benchmark datasets. However, it would be interesting to see how SRMAE performs on real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics. It would be necessary to adapt SRMAE to these applications, but it has the potential to significantly improve the performance of these systems.


4. **Develop a theoretical understanding of SRMAE.** The paper provides an empirical evaluation of SRMAE, but it does not provide a theoretical understanding of why SRMAE works. It would be interesting to develop a theoretical understanding of SRMAE, which could help to improve the model and extend it to new applications.


5. **Combine SRMAE with other techniques for low-resolution image processing.** SRMAE could be combined with other techniques for low-resolution image processing, such as super-resolution, denoising, and deblurring. This could lead to the development of new and improved methods for low-resolution image processing.
