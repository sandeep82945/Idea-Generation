    "abstractText": "This paper focus on the fault tolerance control associated with complete loss of controller one rotor for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). As the quadrotor UAV is widely used in many industrial filed, it is critical to ensure the safety flight even when losing one rotor completely. The quadrotor UAV is a typical compact under-actuated mechanical system, which indicating that there is no more redundant generated thrust when one of the four rotors is complete loss. Thus, in this paper, the dynamic model of the quadrotor is degraded, and the yaw control is sacrificed for stabilizing the attitude and the altitude control. Then, the reduced attitude controller is proposed for maintaining the flight property when losing one rotor completely, and the disturbance observer is combined to compensate the modelling uncertainties and the unknown external disturbances. Furthermore, the integral geometric position controller is also developed to guarantee the flight performance under the effects of unknown external disturbances. The stability of the control system is ensured via the Lyapunov based stability analysis. At last, numerical simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The good position and attitude tracking performance can be achieved despite complete loss of one rotor.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE quadrotor UAV has become popular due to its advan-tage of simple mechanical structure, hovering in the air ability and agile flight maneuver. It exhibits great significant potential application prospects in many fields, such as aerial photography, military reconnaissance, agricultural irrigation and so on [1]\u2013[5]. However, due to the high-frequency vibration and long-time working consumption, it is inevitable that the actuator faults occur when manipulating practical flight, whichmay deteriorate flight performance greatly, even to lose control [6].\nThe quadrotor is the most utilized UAV, as for its simple mechanical structure, agile flight property and high flight efficiency [7]. On the other hand, the quadrotor UAV is also a compacted under-actuated mechanical system, which implies that no more extra thrust generating device is equipped when flying in the air. Thus, it is necessary to consider the fault tolerance control for the quadrotor UAV, which will ensure the safety flight to the greatest extent.\nMany existed works have been done associated with the fault tolerance control for the quadrotor UAV [6], [8]\u2013[12]. In [10], [12], [13], partial failure for the quadrotor\u2019s actuator\nis discussed and the adaptive robust fault tolerance control methods are proposed to compensate the partial loss of the thrust. Numerical simulation or practical flight results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive robust fault tolerance control methods. But the case that completing loss of one rotor for the quadrotor UAV can not be treated as the modelling uncertainties or disturbances, and the controllers mentioned above may not work well. In contrast, they may drive the whole system into the unstable mode.\nThe attitude rotation for the quadrotor UAV can be divided into the torsion rotation and tilt rotation, the former mainly refers to the attitude rotation in yaw channel, and the latter refers to the attitude rotation in roll or pitch channel [14]. It can be noticed that the preservation of the tilt rotation is much more important than that of the torsion rotation. When the quadrotor UAV completely loses one of the four rotors, the original equilibrium point is very hard to maintain, and one feasible solution is to sacrifice the control for torsion rotation [11], [15], [16].\nIn [8], when the quadrotor UAV completely loses one or more propellers during the flight, the open loop stability of the quadrotor UAV\u2019s dynamics is discussed, and the LQR\nVOLUME 11, 2023 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the robust controller. But in the practical flight, the modelling uncertainties are non-negligible. In [17], by considering removing one rotor of the quadrotor UAV during the practical flight, one three-loop nonlinear robust controller is developed. The incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion(INDI) controller is combined in the inner loop to enhance the robustness under the effects of the modelling uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. Free flight experiments are performed in a large wind tunnel to verify the feasibility for the proposed controller. Moreover, in [15], the uniform nonlinear controller, which is also based on the INDI control strategy in the inner loop, is proposed to ensure the safety flight when an arbitrary rotor completely fails. The nonlinear controller doesn\u2019t need the controller\u2019s switching module when the fault occurs, and the practical flight results outdoors demonstrate the good control performance.\nHowever, the invoked INDI control strategy requires high order derivative of the system states which may not be easy to be obtained accurately, and the controller gains in INDI make great influence on the flight performance. On the other hand, inspired by [18], one disturbance observer, which is based on the position dynamics, is proposed in this paper for the quadrotor UAV when completely removing one propeller during the flight. Thus, by considering the agile and safety flight of the quadrotor UAV, the integral geometric reduced attitude controller, which can eliminate singularity existed in Euler angle expression and unwinding behavior existed in quaternion expression, is proposed. Then, the geometric position controller, which is combined with the disturbance observer, is developed to ensure the quadrotor UAV to track the desired trajectory. The proposed nonlinear controller can guarantee the safety flight of the quadrotor UAV after one rotor fails completely under the effects of the modeling uncertainties and unknown external disturbances.\nThe main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1) The complete loss of one rotor for the quadrotor UAV is considered, and the modeling uncertainties in the dynamics of the quadrotor, which is easy to be motivated when the fault occurs, are fully considered. Then, the reduced integral geometric attitude control strategy is proposed to guarantee the safety flight of the quadrotor UAV after one rotor fails completely. 2) The geometric position controller, which is combined with the disturbance observer, is proposed in this paper. It can further ensure the good tracking performance even losing of one rotor completely. 3) The detailed Lyapunov based stability analysis for the closed dynamics is provided, and the numerical simulation results show that good position and attitude tracking performances can be achieved.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The dynamic model for the quadrotor UAV is introduced, and the control objective is addressed in Section II. Then, the reduced attitude\ncontroller, which is combined with the disturbance observer is developed in Section III. And in Section IV, the integral geometric position controller is designed. The numerical simulation results and the associated discussion are provided in Section V. Finally, the conclusion and future work are given in Section VI."

In this paper, the modelling uncertainties in the dynamics of the quadrotor UAV and the unknown external\ndisturbances are named lumped uncertainties, and the control objective is to design the nonlinear robust controller, which can guarantee the position tracking errors converge to zeros under the effects of completely loss of one rotor and the lumped uncertainties."

From Fig.7, it can be known that before the occurrence of one rotor fails completely, the quadrotor UAV exhibits good attitude tracking performance. The attitude tracking errors are within 2 degrees. Then, at 15 seconds, when the one rotor fails completely, there is a significant fluctuation in the attitude tracking performance of a quadrotor UAV in the roll and pitch channels. The fault which occurs at 15 seconds causes an error of 15 degrees in the pitch channel and 5 degrees in the roll channel. Subsequently, it converged to a steady state within 2 seconds. It is worth mentioning that, for maintaining balance, the quadrotor UAV starts high speed spinning in the yaw channel after the fault occur, which can be found in Fig.7 and Fig.8. In brief, the simulation results demonstrate good tracking performance of the quadrotor UAV in the roll and pitch channels.\nRemark 3 To better understanding of the attitude of the quadrotor UAV, the attitude angles are expressed in Euler angles as [\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c8]. The notation \u03c6(t) represents the attitude angle in roll channel, the notation \u03b8(t) represents the attitude angle in pitch channel, and the notation \u03c8(t) represents the attitude angle in yaw channel.\nFig.9 shows the control input of the quadrotor UAV. It can be known from the Fig.9 that the control inputs are within a reasonable scope.\nFig.10 shows the real-time rotor spin speeds for the quadrotor UAV. It can be known that before one rotor fails completely, the motor speeds of the quadrotor UAV are approximately 700 rotations per second(RPS). Then, at 15 seconds, the third rotor is set to lose power completely, which means the motor speed of the third rotor drops to 0. At the same time,\nVOLUME 11, 2023 7\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

CASE2 COMPARING EXPERIMENTAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS. Furthermore, to better demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed nonlinear fault tolerance control strategy in this paper, the control strategy proposed in [11] is selected as a comparison. In this case the quadrotor UAV is set to ascend by 0.5meters within 5 seconds, and then proceeds to perform a cyclic figure-eight trajectory with a gradual descent in z direction. At 15 seconds, the third rotor of the quadrotor UAV fails completely. Then the quadrotor UAV continues to fly and eventually returns to the starting point (0,0,0). Fig.11 to Fig.17 show the numerical simulation results.\nRemark 4 In Case 2, the parameters of the control strategy proposed in this paper are selected the same as that in Case 1. The model parameters and the given external disturbances are selected the same as that in Case 1.\nFrom Fig.11 to Fig.13, it can be known that both control strategies are capable of enabling the quadrotor UAV to track the desired trajectory effectively, even in the event of complete failure of one rotor. What\u2019s more, it can be known from Fig.13 that, by invoking the disturbance observer in the position loop, better flight performance is achieved, especially at the moment of failure at 15 seconds. The control strategy proposed in this paper achieves rapid convergence rate within 2 seconds and exhibits minor fluctuation at 15 seconds. Compared to the control strategy in [11], the introduced disturbance observer in the proposed control strategy provides good compensation for unknown external disturbances in the position subsystem, resulting in improved tracking accuracy.\nIn Fig.14 and Fig.15, the subscript notation s represents the attitude tracking and the attitude tracking errors by using the control strategy in [11]. From Fig.14 and Fig.15, it can be known that both the proposed control strategy in this paper and the control strategy in [11] achieve small steady-state attitude tracking errors. However, after 15 seconds, when one rotor fails completely, the control strategy proposed in this paper exhibits smaller attitude tracking errors and lower steady-state fluctuations. The attitude tracking errors of the quadrotor UAV fluctuate within a range of 20 degrees, and they come into the steady state in 3 seconds. At the same time, the quadrotor UAV starts high-speed spinning to maintain stability. In Fig.16 the notation $s(t) represents the motor\u2019s rotation speeds by using the control strategy in [11]. It can be concluded from Fig.16 that due to the third rotor of the"

The rotation speed of the first motor decreases, while the motor speed of the second rotor and fourth rotor increase to maintain the flight altitude.\nRemark 5 There is a periodic high-speed rotation within the error range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees in the yaw channel of the quadrotor UAV, and the attitude tracking performance in yaw channel is not be displayed in this case.\nFig.17 shows the control input in Case 2, and it can be known that the control inputs of both control strategy are within reasonable scope. To better compare the flight performance between the proposed control strategy in this paper and the control strategy in [11], the average steady-state error (ASSE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) are introduced to represent the steady-state accuracy of the desired trajectory tracking.

Thus, when one rotor fails completely for the quadrotor UAV, the proposed fault tolerance control strategy in this paper demonstrates superior flight performance in agile flight and strong robustness against the unknown external disturbances.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a novel fault tolerance control strategy is developed for the quadrotor UAV when one rotor fails completely during the flight. The controller in yaw channel is abandoned for maintaining the position tracking performance, and the disturbance observer is combined to compensate the unknown external disturbances acting on the dynamics of the quadrotor UAV. Then, the closed loop steady can be guaranteed via the Lyapunov based steady analysis method. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault tolerance control strategy and show strong robustness to the external unknown disturbances, even when one rotor fails completely. Future work will consider applying the proposed control strategy into the quadrotor UAV, and conducting experiments outdoors for safety flight.\nREFERENCES [1] B. Xian, S. Wang, S.
