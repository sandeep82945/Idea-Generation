 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the antibacterial activity of the enzymatically modified lysozyme preparations against a wider range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The paper mentions conducting a full study on antibacterial activity, so expanding the types of bacteria tested could provide useful insights.

2. Investigate the potential anticancer effects of the lysozyme peptide preparations. The introduction mentions lysozyme's application in cancer treatment, so the bioactive peptides could have anticancer properties worth exploring. 

3. Analyze the amino acid sequences and composition of the lysozyme peptides released during enzymatic modification. This could identify bioactive peptide sequences and their mechanisms of action.

4. Test combinations of different proteolytic enzymes beyond pepsin and trypsin to optimize peptide release from lysozyme. The paper suggests trypsin works better with other enzymes, so testing other combinations could improve yields.

5. Evaluate the functional properties of the lysozyme peptides in food systems. Since the paper mentions applications in the food industry, studying how the peptides affect food qualities like texture, stability and shelf-life could be valuable.
