    "abstractText": "Objectives: (1) To analyze the preferential pathways of sound transmission and sound waves travelling properties in the skull and (2) to identify the location(s) on the skull where bone conduction to the cochlea is optimal. Study design: Basic research Methods: Nine cadaveric heads were placed in an anechoic chamber and equipped with six Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHATM) implants (CochlearTM, Sydney, NSW, Australia) and fifteen accelerometers. A laser velocimeter was used to measure cochlear response by placing a reflector on the round window. Different frequency sweeps were applied to each implant, and measurements were recorded simultaneously by the laser velocimeter and accelerometers. Results: Low-frequency sound waves mostly travel the frontal transmission pathways, and there is no clear predominant pattern for the high frequencies. The mean inter-aural time lag is 0.1 ms. Optimal sound transmission to the cochlea occurs between 1000 and 2500 Hz with a contralateral 5 to 10 dB attenuation. The implant location does not influence mean transmission to the cochlea. Conclusion: There is a pattern of transmission for low frequencies through a frontal pathway but none for high frequencies. We were also able to demonstrate that the localization of the BAHATM implant on the skull had no significant impact on the sound transmission, either ipsi or contralaterally.",

Conditions like otosclerosis or anatomical anomalies can sometimes be addressed surgically, but technical difficulties or refusal of the patient to undergo an operation can be obstacles to treatment. Historically, tuning forks were used to help in the diagnosis of hearing loss, using the comparison of air and bone sound transmission [2]. More recently, bone conduction devices and implants have been used to improve the hearing of people suffering from conductive hearing loss, whatever the initial cause of the condition. Clinical experience and research have proved the efficacy of this technology [3]. However, not many fundamental studies were conducted on the pathways of sound conduction in the skull, a topic relevant to the future optimization of the use of bone implants. Studies have theorized about how the sound itself was transmitted\nAudiol. Res. 2022, 12, 162\u2013170. https://doi.org/10.3390/audiolres12020019 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/audiolres\nAudiol.

We used the 1/3 octa scale because it corresponds to the scale used in acoustic engineering as a match for human perception [10].\nIndependent of the location of the implant, the low frequencies (100 to 1500 Hz) are preferentially transmitted via the most frontally located accelerometer (#5).

In the uppermost frequencies analyzed, a dominance of transmission is observed from accelerator #3 situated on the superior part of the skull.\nAudiol.

The displacement speed of the window was the value measured. The amplitude of the signal indicates the magnitude of the movement of the cochlear fluids in the internal ear for each frequency. The graph in Figure 6 shows the average for all heads of the frequency response in both ipsilateral and contralateral cases for each of the implant locations. The initial noisy data for each curve was smoothed by performing a moving frequency average over a band of 300 Hz. This smoothed data set was subsequently averaged over all tested heads. For ease of visualization, a normalization factor of 50 was used to multiply the data. This is equivalent to an upward shift of 33 dB in the zero-reference signal level. All the statistical analyses were carried out on the original data, and this normalization obviously does not affect any conclusions as to the relative amplification levels of the signals with respect to one another.

Ipsilateral and contralateral averaged round window response: 0 to 10,000 Hz.\nThe ipsilateral cases show, for each complete frequency sweep, a response peaking in a zone extending from 1000 to 2500 Hz with subsequent slow damping of the higher frequencies. For the contralateral cases, the peak response is lower by 5 to 10 dB and happens at lower frequencies between 500 and 1200 Hz. This behavior of the average values of the cochlear frequency responses is consistent with the results of the analysis of the timing signals. It is important to note that, for the average over all heads, no significant difference exists in the transmission of the signal to the cochlear fluids coming from the different locations of the sound source, whether at 0, 45, or 90 degrees from the Frankfort plane."

Even though we can clearly appreciate, in Figure 4, that above 7000 Hz there seems to be a clear predominance of accelerator #3, only the 90 degrees and combined signals were transmitting preferentially through the superior part of the skull with a statistically significant p value of less than 0.05 (p < 0.001). Taken alone, the 0 and 45 degrees BAHA\u2122 implants seemed to show a tendency to use that pathway, although not in a statistically significant manner.

It is statistically significant due to the very low p value of the 90 degrees set (p < 0.001), which influences the mean in a disproportionate way. There is no clear explanation of why the signal transmits that way. We hypothesize that lower frequencies signals adopt a more frontal pathway because the frontal sinus might be creating a less dense region with more resonance, advantaging the transfer of those frequencies. We could argue that the presence of the mastoid posteriorly could play a similar role [13], but the frontal sinus is more aerated than the mastoid, and all three implants\u2019 locations are on or above the Frankfort plane, therefore above the plane of most of the mastoid region.

For the higher frequencies, accelerator #3 is the closest to the vertex, and there is no aeration in the upper skull, optimizing transmission at higher frequencies. As mentioned in the results section, the laser velocimeter frequency sweep shows a response that peaks in the 1000 to 2500 Hz zone for the ipsilateral case, while this same peak is damped by 5 to 10 dB and shifted to lower frequencies for the contralateral side. This effect is due to the transmission response of the skull that both shifts frequency and damps the signal from the implant. The same effect is also visible in the time response curves shown in Figure 5. Even though some small differences in average response can be seen between the implant location for both the ipsi and contralateral cases, no statistically significant differences that would favor a particular implant location are shown. Other studies [6,7] tested implant locations not applicable in a clinical setting. This experiment tested potential locations that could be used on patients for surgical implantation. Thus, the data collected could be relevant in the greater aim of improving vibratory implant auditory results. It is important to note the potential effects of using cadaveric heads. No osseointegration of the implant of the BAHA\u2122 is possible, leaving open the possibility of a slightly weaker and less than optimal sound transmission to the skull from the vibration of the implant. However, the implant is already in firm mechanical contact with the skull by itself, as we could detect from the large signal amplitudes observed in the experiment. The end results should, therefore, be unaffected by this limitation. The second limitation comes from dehydration of the tissues, especially the cochlear fluids. It is very difficult to know or extrapolate the effect of brain dehydration on the transmission in the skull and the cochlea [14]. In living persons, the brain and its fluid, which are in contact with the whole cranial vault, most probably drive a part of the bone-conducted cues. However, in cadavers, the dehydration of the brain may result in an air interface underneath the skull that may impact or dampen the sound wave transmission. For the cochlea, the limitation is expected to be a weaker transmission to the velocimeter due to less fluid being available to make the round window move when stimulated with sound. If no liquid was present in the cochlea, the velocimeter would have picked-up air displacement, which is similar to liquid displacement although weaker. As with the non-ossification of the BAHA\u2122, this attenuation would not change the relative results but only slightly diminish the signal amplitude. The skin needed to be removed to place the implants and accelerometers. We minimized the skin removed to make sure the pathways taken by the vibrations were mostly intact. Finally, the embalmment and preservation of the head itself is a limitation. Mc Elhaney et al. studied the effect of embalmment on bones and noted generally for all methods a loss of compressive strength and an increase in hardness [15]. Since the change in property would apply to all the bones, it could affect the raw results numbers but not the interpretation of those numbers. We compared our results with data observed in a clinical and experimental context [16]. As noted previously, the interaural attenuation was of 5 to 10 dB, as would be expected in clinic. The time delay response was also compatible when converted into a distance in cm, with the known speed of transmission of sound in bone [12]. Those parameters confirmed that the data collected are relevant and will be comparable to true clinical features.\nAudiol. Res. 2022, 12 169\nWhile the averaged data presented in the results section show strong regularities, there is still a notable morphology-dependent effect on the different heads. This implies that further studies on the different types of morphologies and what they imply in terms of optimal implant location need to be pursued, using the interaural time signals and the ratio of contra to ipsilateral frequency sweeps to obtain individual skull response functions is an example. In the future, a good understanding of the pathways of transmission and the significant morphological features related to them could lead to the possibility of a tailored selection of device and implantation location for each patient. During the experiment, we also scanned and modelized the heads. The present data set, as it includes both time and frequency response spectra and a CT-scan of each head, could be used in the future to build and verify a finite-element model of the skull in order to propose a virtual benchmark for the development of further bone conductions devices. Throughout this study, great care was taken to ensure the reproducibility of the results. The work was carried out in the best possible audio conditions to minimize artifact signals. Using an anechoic chamber, anti-vibration tables, and a spine fixation considerably reduced the likelihood of spurious audio signals corrupting the data. This technique ensured reproducibility of the results by guaranteeing consistent and minimal damping of vibrations. The data were presented and analyzed in a way that would allow other researchers to easily compare their results to ours. An example is the use of fractions in the analysis of the sound transmission pathways through the coronal plane of the skull. With this technique, any type of sound transmitter and vibration receptor could be used as long as they are set in the pattern described in the methods section. The results, when normalized as a fraction of the total sound transmission through the sagittal accelerometers, could be directly compared to the present work."
