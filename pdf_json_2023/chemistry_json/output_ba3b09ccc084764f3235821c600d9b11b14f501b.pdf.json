    "abstractText": "For the first time, antimony oxide nanoparticles were produced using a microwave technique and evaluated as a supercapacitor electrode. The specific capacitance derived from the material's galvanostatic charge\u2013 discharge curve was 98 F g\u22121 in 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte at 0.1 A g \u22121 current density. The charge storage mechanism visible in the CV curve is nearly rectangular and identical to the EDLC charge storage mechanism. Additionally, antimony species were chemically attached to graphene oxide using an antimony(III) chloride precursor and subsequently microwave aided procedures were used to convert the antimony species to SbO-G nanocomposites. The results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy demonstrated the pure character of the produced material. In a three-electrode cell arrangement, the resulting composite was electrochemically characterized. The cyclic voltammogram results showed that among the pristine SbO, graphene, and SbO-G materials, SbO-G had a higher specific capacitance value of 37.58 F g\u22121, at a scan rate of 10 mV s\u22121. The material has also demonstrated good conductivity characteristics based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy research. After 3500 galvanostatic charge\u2013discharge cycles, the material had excellent cycling stability of \u223c100%.

            "text": "As a result of the rapid development in the chemical industry, nding a good balance between gaining more resources and maintaining a good sustainable environment is gaining more attention.1 The need to have access to clean, reliable and renewable energy is an urgent need to create a sustainable society, therefore emerging technologies associated with energy conversion and storage have become highly paramount. A supercapacitor is one of the energy storage devices capable of satisfying our energy requirement. Compared to batteries, supercapacitors have a higher power density and life cycle and are safer to use.2 Due to their high power density, their electrochemical and morphological characteristics have gained a great deal of interest in the manufacturing of these devices. Their energy density, however, is low, and new materials are always being researched to improve it.3,4 Many antimony-based composites have recently demonstrated high capacity, which has spurred a lot of research into their use for energy storage.\nSensor Laboratories), Chemical Sciences ellville 7535, Cape Town, South Africa. wc.ac.za tion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nBecause of its large theoretical capacity and adequate working voltage, antimony chalcogenide, for example, is now widely researched as a promising electrode material for batteries. Currently, antimony is widely used in semiconductors, antifriction alloys, small arms and tracer bullets, and cable sheathing, as a ame retardant addition in large amounts5 and has a large alloying/dealloying potential as well as a high capacity (660 mA h g\u22121).6 It is well known that antimony corrodes easily, and can ow through a negative electrode in lead batteries, through corrosion of current leads, leading to a reduction in battery service life.7 However, further research has shown that the antimony-containing corrosion layer discharges slowly, allowing the active material to discharge faster than the corrosion layer and preventing the formation of a passivation layer at the electrolyte/active material interface.8 As a result, it appears that adding antimony to the electrode's active material effectively reduces capacitance loss. Antimony has been widely investigated as an addition in newer energy storage sources, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), liquid metal batteries, and fuel cells. Antimony is hypothesized to perform two roles in LIBs: rst, it functions as a spacer to prevent major volume changes in the electrode during the charging/discharging cycles; second, it can hold up to three lithium atoms and provide additional capacitance. Metallic antimony in a sodium-ion battery (SIB) or LIB, on the other\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153 | 5137\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Several methods have been employed to decrease volume expansion, including (1) the production of metallic alloys, (2) the formation of a stable heterostructure oxide (e.g., Sb/S2bO3), and (3) nanoscale tailoring and anchoring in a carbon matrix. Antimony's excellent performance and long and steady cycle life can be achieved by anchoring it in or with carbon. Several studies on the synthesis of an antimony carbon composite for usage in energy storage have recently been published.\nCiszewski et al.9 reported on reduced graphene oxide for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes using an established polyol method. Sahoo et al.10 designed sulfur-doped carbon sheet anchored or encapsulated Sb2S3 nanoparticles for high-performance using microwave-assisted synthesis. Xio et al.11 presented a novel tin antimony oxide/graphene anode material for lithium-ion batteries, by a hydrothermal method. Hai et al.12 also synthesized a paste electrode made of multiwall carbon nanotubes modied with antimony oxide (Sb2O3/ MWCNTs) for simultaneous electrochemical detection of cadmium and lead ions. The key goals of combining carbon with Sb as the buffer layer are to (i) provide structural stability with improved conductivity and surface area, hence increasing the capacitance, and (ii) decrease the volume expansion and agglomeration of Sb particles during the cycle life. LIBs, as well as catalytic and supercapacitive applications, have shown that Sb particles anchored in carbon and Sb-based chalcogenides offer greater potential.\nIn this study we present the synthesis of two types of materials, SbO and SbO-G nanoparticles, using a simple microwave approach. Various techniques are used to analyze the structure, morphology, crystalline phase, and surface area of both samples. In a 1M Li2SO4 electrolyte, the SC performance of each material is measured using a three-electrode electrochemical setup. In a positive potential window (0\u20130.6 V), the SbO and SbO-G electrodes exhibit an electrostatic double-layer capacitance characteristic. The specic capacitance, rate capability, energy density, power density, and durability of an asymmetric SC were also tested. The carbon in the SbO nanoparticles served as a buffer layer that prevented structural degradation while also increasing the effective contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte. These studies suggest that antimony chemistry could be important in the development of new energy storage devices. Although antimony has been used severally as a dopant or an additive in supercapacitor materials, as far as we know, we have not found any application of antimony oxide as a supercapacitor electrode reported. This research could lead to new ideas for using SbO-based electrodes with high reversible capacities in SC applications."

Fig. 1a depicts spherically shaped particles ranging in size from 10 to 50 nm that are uniformly dispersed. The SEM microgram of SbO-G shows a visible graphene sheet with SbO nanoparticles dispersed randomly on the surface. As a result, antimony nanoparticles must have acted as spacers, reducing graphene aggregation. This will result in increased surface area and, consequently, increased charge storage and capacitance.\n3.1.2 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For the pure SbO, the TEM image in Fig. 1b shows highly spherically shaped randomly distributed nanoparticles as seen in the SEM with particle sizes ranging from 10 to 45 nm. The spherical nanoparticles may be seen randomly distributed on the surface of the graphinized material with an average particle size between 10 and 40 nm. This shows that SbO nanoparticles were successfully graphinised. Despite the high degree of aggregation, the material's small grain size indicates that it is highly permeable.13,14 Porosity would improve the ion transfer process and, as a result, the energy storage efficiency.15 In the\n5140 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153\ncorresponding SAED pattern, all rings can be indexed to the diffraction peaks of orthorhombic Sb2O3.

Higher the crystallinity of the material, faster the ion transit within the grains and higher the conductivity.14 The interlayer spacing was also calculated from the SAED images. The d spacing for SbO and SbO-G was calculated to be 2.07 and 2.32 nm respectively. This shows that the incorporation of graphene into the SbO lattice increased the interlayer spacing of the material. The increased spacing will give rise to quicker ion movement thus higher power density. The HRTEM conrms a structural change with the inclusion of graphene."

Both samples seem to have the same phases, however, with the addition of graphene, the peak intensity increased and broadened in SbO-G. For example, when comparing the intensities of SbO and SbO-G XRD diffraction peaks, the (012) plane in the XRD spectrum had the highest diffraction peak intensity. A graph of SbO overlayed on SbO-G as shown in the ESI\u2020 clearly shows the higher peak intensity of SbO-G compared to SbO. The (012) plane of SbO was situated at 28.59\u00b0, and the (002) plane of graphene was also located at 28.54\u00b0. The coincidence of the two crystal surface diffraction peaks may be the cause of the increase in the intensity of (012) diffraction peaks in the SbO-G XRD spectrum.11 The crystal plane values of SbO-G (002) are 2q = 28.59 and d012 = 3.12, respectively, compared to those of SbO-G, which are 2q = 28.4 and d012 = 3.29. The interplanar spacing of SbO-G (3.29) is slightly higher than that of SbO (3.12) due to the retention of a few functional groups and curved surface structures following reduction.16 The most intense peak in the SbO-G composite (2q = 28.54\u00b0) is slightly shied to a lower angle as compared to pristine SbO nanoparticles (2q = 28.59\u00b0) indicating the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

All distinct functional groups present in the samples are shown in Table 1.\n3.2.4 Raman spectroscopy. The SbO and SbO-G materials were further characterized using Raman spectroscopy, which provided the structural ngerprint by which antimony oxide is detected. SbO and SbO-G revealed a visible peak at 87.6 cm\u22121 that belonged to F2g Sb2O3 in the Raman spectra, Fig. 2c.20 The typical Eg (113.1 cm \u22121) and A1g (153.2 cm \u22121) belonging to the inplane and out-of-plane vibrational modes of Sb\u2013O were also identied,21\u201323 conrming that SbO nanoparticles have been obtained aer reduction.

The graphene in SbO-G has less defects than pristine graphene, based on the ID/IG ratio and the very low intensity of D.26 This is obvious in the TEM results.\n3.2.5 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Fig. 2d shows the NMR spectra of SbO-G and graphene. The carbon environment of pure graphene was compared to that of graphene samples with SbO-G. The prominent peak at 117 ppm, which belongs to graphitic sp2 carbon as seen in graphene, shied to 143 ppm, while a shoulder peak can be seen at 169 ppm which when deconvoluted (the inset) reveals a broad peak with FWHM-34 ppm, indicating that the chemical environment of carbon must have been inuenced by the interaction of SbO nanoparticles with graphene.27\n3.2.6 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS is a useful supplementary technique for determining the oxidation states and stoichiometry of SbO and SbO-G. In Fig. 3a, the elements Sb and O were detected in the SbO nanomaterial. The highresolution O1s spectrum of SbO was split into three peaks at 540, 532 and 531 eV. The peaks at 540 and 531 eV can be attributed to Sb2O5/Sb2O3, implying that the SbO sample contains a considerable quantity of Sb2.28 The MW synthesis successfully introduced antimony atoms into the graphene matrix, according to Fig. 3b. The high-resolution Sb 3d + O1s spectrum of SbO-G (Fig. 3c) was split into six peaks at 540, 533, 531, and 530 eV. The peaks at 540 and 530 eV can be attributed to Sb2O5/Sb2O3, implying that the SbO-G samples contain Sb2 in a large amount at its outer surface. C]O and C\u2013O can be ascribed to the 533 and 531 eV peaks, respectively. The presence of Sb2O5 is suggested by the high peaks at 540 and 530 eV. The presence of carbon\u2013oxygen components, such as C\u2013O, C]O, and O\u2013C]O, was demonstrated by the presence of peaks at 287, 285, and 284 eV in the C1s spectrum (Fig. 3d).

Fig. 3e shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of SbO and SbO-G. The UV-vis absorption spectra revealed that SbO and SbO-G have a broad UV-vis absorption range, with the highest absorption at 206 nm. The absorption intensity of SbO-G is higher than that of pure SbO, which may be attributed to the sum of the absorption for graphene and SbO,31,32 indicating that the SbO-G nanoparticles were successfully synthesized. With the addition of graphene, the curve exhibits a more evident exponential decay, indicating that the SbO-G nanoparticles have increased dispersion capacities. Using the Tauc plot from Origin soware (the inset a and b), the band gaps of SbO and SbO-G were estimated to be 0.46 and 0.34 eV, respectively.31 When compared to pure SbO nanoparticles, the bandgap of the SbO-G composite is lowered due to the development of Sb\u2013O\u2013C bonds.32,33 The charge transmission is facilitated by the link that exists between Sb and C. It is worth mentioning that the lower bandgap value found in this study could be attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of the nanoparticles.34"

            "text": "3.3.1 Cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the SbO and SbO-G compounds in a 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte. At scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV s\u22121, capacitive currents were observed between 0.0 and 0.6 V vs. Ag/ AgCl electrode. Both materials showed a steady increase in cathodic currents as potential rises with no pseudocapacitive/ redox peak (Fig. 4a and b). This demonstrates superior capacitive behaviour, resulting in increased power.33 As the scan rate increases, the capacitive currents in the cyclic voltammograms indicate a substantial increase. This means the charge storage mechanism is capacitive and the process is reversible electrochemically.34 Voltammograms of SbO have a nearly rectangular shape, resembling the behaviour of a perfect EDLC. According to Trasitti et al.,35 the charge storage mechanism of a metal oxide is divided into outer and inner site charge contributions.36 As a result, at a high scan rate, when the inner sites are all exonerated from the capacitance contribution, the charge/ discharge occurs so quickly at the outer site, giving rise to the rectangular shape seen in the carbon voltammogram. Secondly, if the material is porous and the inner sites are easily accessible, charge and discharge will occur at a rapid rate, resulting in a rectangular shape.37 Therefore, the voltammogram of SbO suggests high porosity of the material. SbO-G voltammogram shows a slight deviation from perfect EDLC behaviour. The quasi-rectangular voltammogram of the SbO-G materials demonstrates that EDLC and the pseudocapacitance charge storage mechanism both play a role. The deviation of the voltammogram from the ideal rectangular form increased as the voltage scan rate increased. This could be due to the electrode's electrochemical polarization. The pseudocapacitance contribution and the electrochemical polarization of the electrode are caused by the numerous functional groups present in the SbO-G as shown in the FTIR.38 The specic capacitance of the three materials was calculated from the equation below:\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153 | 5143\nFig. 4 SbO and SbO-G: (a and b) CV plots at different scan rates, (c) CV plots comparing their voltammograms at 40 mV s\u22121 scan rate, (d) their specific capacitances at different scan rates.

SbO-G showed a better electrochemical performance with a specic capacitance of 37.58 F g\u22121 at 10 mV s\u22121 and up to 11.41 F g\u22121 at 100 mV s\u22121. The values were 16.80 F g\u22121 at 10 mV s\u22121 and 6.32 F g\u22121 at 100 mV s\u22121 for SbO. The CV curves of SbO and SbO-G are shown in Fig. 4c at a scan rate of 40 mV s\u22121. The area under the CV curve of SbO-G is greater than the area of SbO. Because the average value of the area under the CV curves is directly related to the capacitance value, this nding demonstrated that SbO-G had enhanced capacitive behavior. Greater the area under the CV curves, greater the amount of charge held by the electrode material. The high capacitance of SbO-G is mostly owing to the composite's large specic surface area and the high conductivity of graphene.39\n5144 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153\nThe specic capacitance values are plotted against potential sweep rates as shown in Fig. 4d. The specic capacitance values for both materials gradually reduced when the voltage scan rate was increased as shown in Table 2. This is owing to the short time interval, which precludes the contribution of the electrode's inner surfaces.40\n3.3.2 Galvanostatic charge discharge. The performance of SbO and SbO-G electrodes was investigated at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2 and 5 A g\u22121 (Fig. 5a and b). The SbO-G electrode's GCD curves show a high specic capacitance when compared to SbO. The presence of typical triangular curves conrms the electric double layer capacitive charge storage mechanism occurring at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface.41 The GCD curves are nearly symmetrical, with only a minor voltage drop due to the equivalent series resistance (ESR).

From the rate capability analysis, the SbO electrode exhibits better capacitance retention retaining \u223c80% of its capacitance at 1 A g\u22121 and \u223c40% at 5 A g\u22121. The SbO-G electrode has the highest specic capacitance at the same current density when compared to SbO electrodes. The highest capacitance of the SbO-G electrode, for example, reached 98 F g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121, while that of SbO was 25.11 F g\u22121. This is due to the contribution of EDLC and pseudocapacitance and the more porous microstructure, which facilitate electrolyte inltration and contribute to the development of electrical double-layer capacitance. The specic capacitance decreases as the current increases (5d). The drop in specic capacitance values was noticeable in the discharge time of GCD curves.

As illustrated in Fig. 6a, Nyquist plots were used to analyze the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data and were displayed with an equivalent circuit inset.43 In the highfrequency region, the intersection of the curve at the real component reveals the bulk resistance of the electrochemical system. This includes ionic resistance from the electrolytes, intrinsic grain to grain resistance of the electrode, and contact resistance at the interphase between the active material and the substrate.44,45 The radius of the semicircle in the high-frequency region displays the charge-transfer process, at the interface of the electrode and the electrolyte. As we approach lower frequencies the semicircle breaks into a 45\u00b0 nearly vertical line which is related to the Warburg (W2) diffusion of ions within the\n5146 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153\nelectrode inter-phase.33 The EIS graphs demonstrated that SbO (4.8 U) had a greater Rs than SbO-G (3.2 U). SbO also shows a small semi-circle in the high-frequency region; however, with the addition of graphene the semi-circle disappears given a near-perfect capacitive response. SbO and SbO-G have tting Rct values of 7.35 and 3.75 U respectively. Also, as observed in the curve, the SbO-G electrodes exhibit better capacitive behaviour with an almost vertical line.46 The slope of the 45\u00b0 section of the curves in the intermediate frequency area was\nFig. 7 AC//SbO and AC//SbO-G: (a and b) GCD plots at different current densities, (c) GCD plots comparing their charge and discharge profile at 0.2 A g \u22121 current density, (d) relationship between specific capacitance and current density (e) is the Ragone plot.

Furthermore, the Warburg resistance value (Table 3) is lower in SbO-G. Because of the low charge transfer resistance and lower diffusion effect, relatively reversible reactions can occur at the interface, which may explain the rectangular voltammogram of both materials and why the rectangular nature is retained even at high scan rates.\nThe Bode plot from the EIS data is shown as the phase angle and total impedance plot in Fig. 6b. The phase angle for SbO was 64.4\u00b0 while that of SbO-G was 75.7\u00b0. The phase angle of SbO-G is closer to 90\u00b0, therefore, showingmore capacitive phase angles as seen in the Warburg diffusion area. It is clear from the face angle that the materials store charges utilizing both the EDL and the pseudocapacitive mechanisms. The magnitude of total impedance was lowest in SbO-G as seen in Fig. 6c. The constant phase element (CPE) was also derived from the Bode total impedance plot. The CPE impedance is given by\nZCPE = a \u22121(jw)\u2212n (3)\nwhere a is the frequency-independent constant related to the roughness of the surface features, and the exponent n is determined by the slope of log z vs. log f. The coefficient \u2018a\u2019 is resistive when n = 0, capacitive for n = 1 and a Warburg impedance (charge transfer impedance) for n= 0.5. The value of n for SbO and SbO-G was 0.78 and 0.69 respectively. The change in n conrms a change in the morphology of the material, both values show that the materials are capacitive as their values approach 1 (ref. 47). The total CPE values obtained from the tted Nyquist plot are shown in Table 3."

The charge storage in activated carbon occurs via the creation of an electrical double layer. The performance of AC in an aqueous solution of 1 M Li2SO4 in a half-cell arrangement with the SbO electrode was done. This ascertained the suitability of activated carbon as a negative electrode (Fig. 10 ESI\u2020).\n3.4.1 Galvanostatic charge discharge. The GCD plot as shown in Fig. 7a and b was obtained at different current densities (0.1 A g\u22121, 0.2 A g\u22121, 0.4 A g\u22121, 0.5 A g\u22121, 0.6 A g\u22121, 0.8 A g\u22121, 1 A g\u22121 and 2 A g\u22121). The capacitance at each current density was calculated and the result is as shown in Tables 4 and 5. The result showed an improved performance in the SbOG device compared to the SbO electrode device. Fig. 7d shows the relationship between the capacitance and the current density, the capacitance reduced with an increase in the current density. At a current density of 0.2 A g\u22121, SbO-G has a specic capacitance of 32.89 F g\u22121, which is higher than that of SbO (5.5 F g\u22121). Notably, as the current density increased to 1 A g\u22121, SbOG maintained a high capacitance of 9.33 F g\u22121, retaining 64% of its capacitance. The SbO device, on the other hand, exhibits poorer capacitance retention of 12.6%, indicating that the\n5148 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5137\u20135153\nstructure of the graphene improved electrolyte ion diffusion.

Fig. 7e is a Ragone plot which depicts the relationship between the asymmetric device's energy density and power density, at various current densities. An ideal supercapacitor device would have a high energy density while also having a high-power density. Interestingly, the asymmetric Cs cell had the highest energy density of 2.50 W h kg\n\u22121, at a power density of 720 W kg\u22121, at 0.2 A g\u22121 current density for SbO, while SbO-G delivered an energy density of 14.8 W h kg\u22121, at a power density of 360 W kg\u22121, at 0.2 A g\u22121 current density.

This shows that more facile charge transfer occurred between the Li+ and SO4\n2\u2212 ions and SbO-G.48,49 A well-dened, near-vertical, and shorter Warburg area part in the SbO-G device compared to the SbO device demonstrates that the ions in the electrolyte have a short and equal diffusion path length. Thus, because of the low charge transfer resistance and lower diffusion effect, relatively reversible reactions can occur at the interface, which explains the shape of the voltammogram and GCD prole.46 The Bode plot from the EIS data is shown as the phase angle and total impedance plot in Fig. 8b. The phase angle of SbO is 68.06\u00b0 while that of SbO-G device is 72.5\u00b0, indicating a capacitive behaviour which is from the contribution of both EDLC and pseudocapacitance.

The SbO-G device showed better capacitance retention as seen in Fig. 9b. The device maintained 100% capacitance retention aer the cycling test. This is evident in the voltammogram which did not change aer the charge and discharge test. The Coulombic efficiency was also maintained at 100% throughout the cycling. This improved stability is because of the incorporation of a more stable carbon matrix, thus improving the cycle life of the device.

The charge storage mechanism visible in the CV curve of SbO is nearly rectangular and identical to the EDLC charge storage mechanism. The total capacitance increased from 25.11 F g\u22121 for the SbO to 98.00 F g\u22121 for the SbO-G.

This is due to the utilization of the combined advantages of separated graphene nanosheets, and a high conductive network of ne SbO nanoparticles. SbO and SbO-G were used to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor device as a positive electrode, while activated carbon was used as the negative electrode. The asymmetric Cs cell delivered a maximum energy density of 2.52 W h kg\u22121, at a power density of 720 W kg\u22121, at 0.2 A g\u22121 current density for SbO, while SbO-G delivered an energy density of 14.80 W h kg\u22121, at a power density of 360 W kg\u22121, at the same current density. The energy density and power density were enhanced by the addition of graphene which led to increased surface area for charge discharge. This result shows that, apart from the conventional ruthenium oxide and carbon material used for supercapacitors, antimony oxides upon optimization will result in an excellent electrode material for energy storage.
