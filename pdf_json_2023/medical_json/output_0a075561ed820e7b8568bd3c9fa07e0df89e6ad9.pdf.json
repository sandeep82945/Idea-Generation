    "abstractText": "Mesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the peritoneum, pleura, and other sites. These NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) focus on peritoneal mesothelioma (PeM). The NCCN Guidelines for PeM provide recommendations for workup, diagnosis, and treatment of primary as well as previously treated PeM. The diagnosis of PeMmay be delayed because PeM mimics other diseases and conditions and because the disease is so rare. The pathology section was recently updated to include new information aboutmarkers used to identify mesothelioma, which is difficult to diagnose. The term \u201cmalignant\u201d is no longer used to classify mesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are now defined asmalignant. J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2023;21(9):961\u2013979 doi:10.6004/jnccn.2023.0045 NCCN CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE AND CONSENSUS Category 1: Based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. Category 2A: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. Category 2B: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate. Category 3: Based upon any level of evidence, there is major NCCN disagreement that the intervention is appropriate. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise noted. Clinical trials: NCCN believes that the best management of any patient with cancer is in a clinical trial. Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.",

            "text": "Mesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the peritoneum, pleura, and other sites that is estimated to occur in approximately 3,500 people in the United States every year.1\u20135 These NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) focus on peritoneal mesothelioma (PeM), which is a less common type (approximately 15%). Most mesothelioma occurs in the pleura (approximately 85%); it can also occur very rarely in other sites, such as the pericardium and tunica vaginalis testis.6\u20139 It is estimated that PeM occurs in approximately 300 to 400 people in the United States every year.10 The true incidence may be higher because PeM may not be coded correctly; it may be misdiagnosed as other cancers that typically involve the peritoneum, such as ovarian cancer. The mean age is about 69 years at diagnosis of PeM. One-year overall survival is approximately 46% in patients with PeM, and 5-year overall survival is about 20%; cure is rare.11 Survival is improved for patients who are able to undergo complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.12\u201316 There are multiple intravenous systemic therapy options for patients who are not candidates for CRS, or those whose disease recurs following CRS with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).\nSimilar to pleural mesothelioma, the histologic subtypes of PeM include epithelioid (most common), sarcomatoid, and biphasic (also known as mixed, containing both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components).4,17\u201319 Patients with epithelioid histology have better outcomes than those with either biphasic or sarcomatoid histologies; histology is used to direct treatment.15 Similarities exist between PeM and pleural mesothelioma, but there are unique differences.15 PeM is diagnosed in equal numbers of males and females; pleural mesothelioma is more common in males.11 In addition, PeM may occur in younger patients, whereas pleural mesothelioma typically occurs in older patients. Many patients with PeM have idiopathic disease.20 Pleural mesothelioma is typically caused by asbestos exposure; however, PeM is less frequently associated with asbestos exposure.21\u201324 The incidence of pleural mesothelioma and PeM is decreasing in the United States because asbestos use has decreased since the 1970s.1,5,25\u201328 Although asbestos is no longer mined in the United States, it is still imported.28 Genetic factors play a role in some patients with PeM, with families carrying a germline mutation in the BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene; a few patients have somatic mutations, such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK ) rearrangements or rare fusions.29\u201337\n962 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 9 | September 2023\nPatients with PeM present with abdominal signs and symptoms, such as ascites, pain, distension, and an abdominal mass.11,38 They often have a high symptom burden compared with patients who have other types of cancer. The diagnosis of PeM may be delayed, because symptoms are nonspecific.11,21,24,38 Thus, many patients with PeM have advanced disease at diagnosis.11 Although PeM can spread extensively in the abdomen, it less commonly metastasizes beyond the abdominal cavity.24\nThese NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Peritoneal were first published in 2021 and will be updated at least once every year. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel revised the title of the guideline to \u201cMesothelioma: Peritoneal\u201d to align with the pleural mesothelioma guidelines; the previous title was \u201cMalignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma.\u201d The term \u201cmalignant\u201d is no longer used to classifymesotheliomas, because allmesotheliomas are now defined as malignant.39 The pathology section was also updated to include new information about markers used to identify mesothelioma, which is difficult to diagnose; PeM has distinct molecular features when compared with pleural mesothelioma (see \u201cPrinciples of Pathologic Review\u201d in the algorithm, page 967).40 A newabbreviations list was also added to the guidelines. Additional supplementarymaterial in the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Peritoneal\nincludes the \u201cPrinciples of Pathologic Review\u201d (page 967), \u201cPrinciples of Surgery\u201d (page 972), \u201cPrinciples of Systemic Therapy\u201d (page 974), and \u201cPrinciples of Supportive Care\u201d (page 975).

Using paracentesis fluid (cytology) is also not recommended for diagnosis because invasion cannot be detected using cytology.21,24 Measurement of soluble mesothelin-related peptide andCA-125 levelsmay be considered, and these levels may correlate with disease status.

            "text": "Tissue biopsy of the abdominal mass/nodule(s) with histopathology is essential for an accurate diagnosis of PeM, because symptoms, imaging findings, and serum markers are not specific. Patients may have benign and preinvasive mesothelial tumors such as peritoneal inclusion cyst, welldifferentiated papillary mesothelial tumor, or mesothelioma in situ.44\u201346 Peritoneal inclusion cyst is very rare; it was\npreviously termed \u201cbenign multicystic PeM,\u201d but this term was revised based on the recent WHO classification.47\u201349 Diffuse PeM is malignant and further divided into specific histologic subtypes, including epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic histology (epithelioid and sarcomatoid histology, also known as \u201cmixed\u201d).17,50 Unless otherwise indicated, these PeM guidelines refer to diffuse PeM, because most patients have diffuse mesothelioma. Although localized pleural mesothelioma may occur, it is very rare; localized PeM is extremely rare.33,51\u201353 Accurate histology is essential, because the treatment options depend on histology. Patients with an epithelioid subtype have longer median overall survival (39 months) compared with patients who have a biphasic subtype (14 months).15 However, median survival is improved if patients are able to undergo cytoreductive surgery (55 months for epithelial histology vs 13 months for biphasic).54 Distinguishing diffuse PeM from peritoneal inclusion cyst and well-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumor is important because treatment options differ; it is also important to distinguish PeM from metastatic carcinomas such as breast, gastrointestinal, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and renal cell (see \u201cPrinciples of Pathologic Review\u201d in the algorithm, page 967).55 The differential diagnosis of PeM includes peritoneal\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 9 | September 2023 965\ncarcinomatosis, serous peritoneal carcinoma, tuberculous peritonitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis.24,56\nDetailed information about the pathologic evaluation of PeM is provided in the algorithm (see \u201cPrinciples of Pathologic Review,\u201d page 967) and summarized in this discussion. Because PeM and pleural mesothelioma are similar, the pathology section also contains content about pleural mesothelioma. The classification for pleural mesothelioma was revised based on new recommendations from theWHO.39,57 The classification for PeMhas also been revised to align with the pleural mesothelioma guidelines. The term \u201cmalignant\u201d is no longer used to classify mesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are now defined as malignant.39\nHistologic assessment and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are the main tools used in the diagnosis of diffuse PeM; however, cytogenetics and molecular techniques are also used. For a diagnosis of mesothelioma, the lesion needs to be diffuse, mesothelial, and malignant. There is no single IHC marker to diagnose PeM. Different IHC markers need to be used to distinguish PeMs from other carcinomas, such as gynecologic malignancies or renal cell carcinomas. A panel of markers is recommended as follows: (1) two mesothelial markers (ie, positive markers), including calretinin and podoplanin (D2-40); and (2) two\ncarcinomamarkers (ie, negativemarkers) including claudin 4, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), polyclonal CEA, and paired box gene 8 (PAX8).17,50,58\u201364 Although PAX8 is a carcinoma marker, sometimes PeMs will stain for PAX8.17,65 Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT-1) is generally positive for PeM; however, it is also positive for papillary serous carcinoma.63 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel deleted WT-1 and added PAX8 for the differential diagnosis of PeM. It is important to note that IHCmarkers for diagnosing PeM differ slightly from those for diagnosing pleural mesothelioma. For example, TTF-1 and D2-40 are not useful for diagnosing PeM, although they are useful for diagnosing pleural mesothelioma.17\nBAP1 IHC loss is a molecular marker that is useful for diagnosing mesothelioma, especially mesothelioma in situ, which is difficult to diagnose.11,66\u201371 BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in mesothelioma and other carcinomas. Recurrent somatic and/or germline mutations in BAP1 occur in mesothelioma.11,71 Aberrant BAP1 protein expression, which is defined as absence of nuclear BAP1 IHC staining, occurs in about 50% to 70% of patients with epithelioid mesothelioma but in fewer than 20% of those with sarcomatoid mesothelioma.72 BAP1 IHC is useful for distinguishing mesotheliomas from benign mesothelial tumors. For the 2023 update\n966 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 9 | September 2023\n(Version 1), the panel clarified that complete absence of expression or cytoplasmic staining is considered a loss of BAP1 expression. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase IHC is another molecular marker that is useful for diagnosing pleural mesotheliomas. Cytoplasmic loss of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase IHC is used to quickly assess the presence of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A deletions, which can be measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, fewer patients with PeMs have these deletions (8%\u201335%) compared with patients with pleural mesotheliomas (60%\u201374%).40,66,67,73"

Surgery is typically contraindicated in patients with bicavitary disease and those with biphasic or sarcomatoid histology; however, surgery may be considered in select patients with bicavitary disease or low-volume biphasic disease (see \u201cPrinciples of Surgery\u201d in the algorithm, page 972).78 It is essential that patients receive a careful assessment before surgery is performed. Complete cytoreduction is recommended for eligible patients with epithelioid histology and unicavitary PeM who aremedically operable.21,74,76,79\nThe surgical goal for PeM is CRS to achieve macroscopic complete resection by removing all visible or palpable tumors, which frequently involves a total parietal peritonectomy (see \u201cPrinciples of Surgery\u201d in the algorithm, page 972). If macroscopic complete resection or near complete cytoreduction is not possible, then surgery should be aborted. Palliative surgery and/or HIPEC can be considered but only if there will be minimal morbidity. There is no accepted staging system for PeM. The peritoneal cancer index scoring system is used to indicate the severity of the symptom burden (see \u201cPrinciples of Surgery,\u201d page 972).74 A completeness of cytoreduction\nscore of zero (CC-0) indicates no residual disease (see \u201cPrinciples of Surgery,\u201d page 972).80 A novel staging system based on the peritoneal carcinomatosis index is available.81"

This discussion text for PeM describes the recommendations in the algorithm in greater detail, for example, by including the clinical trial\nJNCCN.org | Volume 21 Issue 9 | September 2023 973\ndata and other references that support the NCCN panel\u2019s recommendations in the algorithm. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel revised the title of the guideline to \u201cMesothelioma: Peritoneal\u201d to align with the pleural mesothelioma guidelines; the previous title was \u201cMalignant PeritonealMesothelioma.\u201d The term \u201cmalignant\u201d is no longer used to classifymesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are now defined as malignant.39 The classification for pleural mesothelioma was revised based on new recommendations from the WHO.39,57 The classification for PeM has been revised to align with the pleural mesothelioma guidelines. A new abbreviations list was also added to the guidelines.\nMesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the peritoneum (15%), pleura (85%), and other sites. It is estimated to occur in approximately 3,500 people in the United States every year.1\u20134 PeM is estimated to occur in approximately 300 to 400 people in the United States every year.10 The mean age is approximately 69 years at diagnosis of PeM. One-year overall survival is approximately 46% in patients with PeM, and 5-year overall survival is approximately 20%; cure is rare.2,11,121\u2013124\nPatients with PeM present with abdominal signs and symptoms such aspain, distension, ascites, andanabdominalmass.11,38 Patients with PeMoften have a high symptom\nburden compared with patients who have other types of cancer. The diagnosis of PeM may be delayed because symptoms are nonspecific.11,24,38 Thus, many patients have advanced disease at diagnosis.11 Although PeM can spread extensively in the abdomen, it rarely metastasizes beyond the abdominal cavity.24 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel revised the pathology section to include new information about markers used to identify PeM, which is difficult to diagnose and has distinct molecular features when compared with pleural mesothelioma (see \u201cPrinciples of Pathologic Review,\u201d in the algorithm, page 967).40 There is no single IHC marker to diagnose PeM. Different IHC markers need to be used to distinguish PeMs from other carcinomas, such as gynecologicmalignancies or renal cell carcinomas. A panel of markers is recommended as follows: (1) two mesothelial markers (ie, positive markers), including calretinin and podoplanin (D2-40); and (2) two carcinomamarkers (ie, negative markers) including claudin 4, TTF-1, polyclonal CEA, and PAX8.17,50,58\u201364 Although PAX8 is a carcinoma marker, sometimes PeMwill stain for PAX8.17,65 WT-1 is generally positive for PeM; however, it is also positive for papillary serous carcinoma.63 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel deleted WT-1 and added PAX8 for the differential diagnosis of PeM.\n974 \u00a9 JNCCN\u2014Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | Volume 21 Issue 9 | September 2023\nData show good outcomes for eligible patients with PeM who have CRS and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.13,14,75\u201377 Therefore, a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to assess whether patients are eligible for surgery. Multiple intravenous systemic therapy options exist for patients who are not candidates for CRS or whose disease recurs after CRS with or without HIPEC. Recommended systemic therapy regimens for PeM are mainly based on clinical trials with patients with pleural mesothelioma; the NCCN panel has decided that these regimens are equally efficacious for\nboth disease sites.21,74,89 Details about the systemic therapy clinical trials for pleural mesothelioma are described in the discussion for pleural mesothelioma (see the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural, available at NCCN.org). For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN panel reorganized the systemic therapy recommendations for PeM based on histology and line of therapy. The NCCN panel also clarified that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab should only be considered as a subsequent therapy option for patients with PeM if they have not previously been treated with ICIs."
