We\u00a0 will evaluate of the impact of potential mental health improvements on human capital outcomes, including educational and employment outcomes.\nConclusion: Findings will help to make conclusions about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and it will assess its effectiveness to improve the mental health and human capital outcomes of beneficiaries. This will enable the identification of strategies to address mental health problems among socioeconomically vulnerable young people that can be\u00a0 adapted to different contexts in in low and middle-income countries."

            "text": "Internal conflicts lead to substantial human and economic losses for civilian populations (1). Physical assets are often destroyed or seized, and armed groups disrupt markets, seeking territorial strong-holds. Internal conflicts leave a legacy of structural poverty (2) and undermine young people\u2019s development of human capital \u2013 defined as skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to succeed economically and improve their future. Human capital costs of armed conflict persist long after peace agreements have been reached (3). In turn, armed conflicts also have severe mental health consequences: young people exposed to conflict experience losses of relatives and friends, witness violent events, or can be\u00a0the direct victims of violence, increasing the risk of mental health problems (MHP), such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (4). MHPs can affect young people\u2019s ability to build human capital and increase the risk of structural poverty, undermining peacebuilding efforts and restoring the vicious cycle.\nMental health interventions for conflict victims\nColombia endured more than five decades of internal armed conflict, leaving high rates of MHP among Colombian youth between the ages of 13 and 28 (5). Epidemiological studies in conflict-affected areas have shown high prevalence rates of anxiety (52%), depression (43%), and PTSD (11\u201347%) (6\u20138), which often intersect with socioeconomic deprivation. Mental health interventions can help young people overcome the psychological effects of war and conflict, build resilience, and increase their ability to engage and succeed in their educational and training program (9), thus reducing the future risk of poverty. Our project aligns with recently enacted legislation in Colombia that aims to expand mental healthcare provision for the population affected by the internal conflict. This legislation led to the creation of the \u201cProgram of Psychosocial Care and Integral Health for Victims\u201d (PAPSIVI) (10), together with a newly adopted National Mental Health Policy (11). Yet, evidence suggests that mental health services remain inadequate and underfunded, especially for young people (12). Less than 10% of the 9.3 million people recognized as conflict victims in Colombia have received some form of psychosocial support (13), and a treatment gap remains, with poor access to mental health services, particularly for those displaced by the conflict and more severe and complex problems that require specialist treatment (14).\nDigital mental health interventions and young people\u2019s human capital\nMental health is essential to human capital formation, influencing educational attainments and labor productivity (15, 16). Human capital and mental health can thus be\u00a0part of a vicious cycle that limit young people\u2019s ability to escape poverty in post-conflict societies. This\nproject aims to demonstrate that jointly strengthening human capital (through the Youth in Action program) and improving mental wellbeing (through our intervention), can improve young people\u2019s chances to enhance their learning outcomes and potentially interrupt the vicious cycle of poor attainment, poverty, and mental health problems. The combination of poverty and mental health problems (MHP) makes conflict-affected areas in Colombia a clear example of a vicious cycle (Figure\u00a01). This project examines whether this vicious cycle can be\u00a0broken through a mental health intervention embedded within a national cash transfer program that supports young people in accessing post-secondary education.\nOur study builds upon evidence that training and education interventions with mental health programs substantially increase the likelihood of breaking the \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of poverty and poor mental health in young adulthood (18). There is some evidence that mental health interventions can help young people affected by conflict, but significant gaps in knowledge, with a lack of research evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of interventions (13). Some mental health interventions have shown partial success (13, 14). Still, high levels of mental comorbidity, low uptake and adherence, high dropout rates, lack of flexibility and trained therapists, and difficulties accessing treatment remain critical challenges.\n\u2018Youth in Action\u2019 program\nThe \u2018Youth in Action\u2019 program (J\u00f3venes en Acci\u00f3n in Spanish-JeA) is a major initiative of the Colombian government to decrease\nFIGURE\u00a01 The vicious cycle of poverty, armed conflict, and mental health in low-and-middle-income countries (17).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\neconomic disparities by strengthening the formation of human capital among vulnerable young people living in poverty. Introduced in 2012, JeA supports young beneficiaries undertaking vocational training or university education with tuition fees and a living allowance given upon successful attendance and performance verification. JeA also offers a \u201cskills for life\u201d (Habilidades Para la Vida, in Spanish) training component to strengthen general skills that might increase long-term employability. The program currently hosts 445,000 beneficiaries, 14% living in conflict-affected municipalities. Although the program has been shown to impact educational outcomes and employment opportunities significantly, high levels of MHP among beneficiaries have been identified as an essential barrier to success (14).\nDigital mental health interventions in Colombia\nThere are few studies on the feasibility and impact of digital mental health interventions in Colombia. A recent study of an internet intervention for college students, assisted by a trained person, showed positive results but high dropout rates (around 80%) (19). Members of our team have developed and tested several simple mental health digital tools with good adherence and outcomes in other Latin American countries (20\u201323). With the advent of the COVID-19 epidemic, remote delivery is an additional underexplored challenge that this project aims to address. This study is particularly unique in that we\u00a0work directly with Government within a public program. So far, no studies have assessed the impact of incorporating a mental health intervention within an existing public cash transfer program to address poverty."

We\u00a0 aim to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a mental health intervention that addresses comorbid mental health problems among beneficiaries of the JeA program. We\u00a0also aim to make a first evaluation of the impact of potential mental health improvements on human capital outcomes, including educational and employment outcomes.\nWe will also assess the several outcomes of the mental health intervention to improve the chances of JeA beneficiaries of completing the program and building human capital. Specifically, we\u00a0will assess preliminary clinical outcomes of the relationship between the mental health intervention, compared to a control group, with dimensions related to human capital formation using a combination of administrative data and survey data collected as part of the intervention, that includes data on academic performance and attendance, as well as data on employment following the completion of the program. We\u00a0also assess cross-site comparisons in efficacy to see if the effect differs by region. An analysis of the most recent national mental health survey data for conflict victims has not highlighted regional differences in the prevalence of common mental health disorders for victims of the conflict (7). They underscore the\nneed for increased mental health services for this population in their regions. Notwithstanding, we\u00a0will include in our statistical analysis tests for regional differences, comparing against control groups.\nThe project has three main research questions leading to methodological, empirical, and policy-related contributions:\n1. Can a stepped-care mental health with a digital component improve young people\u2019s mental health and human capital in conflict-affected areas? 2. Can this stepped-care mental health intervention improve young people\u2019s chances of succeeding in their training and educational outcomes? 3. Is a stepped-care mental health with a digital component feasible and acceptable for inclusion in the JeA program in conflict-affected areas in Colombia?\nWe expect to address these aims in a period of 36 months (3 years)."

A guide to interview participants and \u201cYouth in Action\u201d staff has been developed based on field work conducted in previous projects, where several of the authors participated, that studied the relation between mental health and poverty (24). The guide seeks to find the mental health resources that are available to our population and disposition to seek or recommend seeking help their willingness to participate in a mental health program. Participants and staffers will be\u00a0encouraged to discuss these themes presented in the Appendix 1. The core of the discussion will be\u00a0formative research that focuses on their understanding of mental health access to mental health services, and barriers/facilitators to access a mental health intervention. Questions will focus on ways to\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 04 frontiersin.org\novercome stigma and recommendations on forms to generate acceptability of language related to mental health themes that will impinge on the willingness to answer our surveys. The invitations to participate in the intervention where we\u00a0plan to outline the stepped care program will be\u00a0 co-written by JeA youth and staff to optimize engagement.\nWe will conduct semi-structured one-to-one interviews with 8 JeA staff to explore their experiences supporting young people with mental health issues and their views on potential barriers and facilitators to embedding the intervention in the JeA program. We\u00a0will also carry 10 one-to-one interviews with young people who are beneficiaries of the JeA program to explore their views around mental health and their experiences of seeking or providing (to friends, for example) support for emotional distress and mental well-being. We\u00a0will include young people enrolled in the JeA program, which will include youth with different characteristics, e.g., displaced people, victims of the armed conflict, indigenous people, and some who do not belong to any of these groups. The recruitment of these participants will be\u00a0done by the regional staff of Youth in Action. They will provide us with a list of potential beneficiaries who are interested on participating and the research team will randomly select ten of them.\nOnce the intervention is finalized, we\u00a0will also re-engage with participants to further understand the perceptions of usability, engagement, and acceptability of our program. In this initial stage, we\u00a0 also intend to prepare for difficulties with technology in the population we\u00a0plan to engage. We\u00a0have anticipated, using our most recent post-COVID national mental-health surveys, what the most present needs of this population might be. Our surveys will not be\u00a0used to categorize participants to their assigned strategy but will help us complement these findings for conflict zones to potentially suggest policy initiatives to the governmental agency involved in this project.\nThe qualitative interviews will be\u00a0recorded via Teams in video or audio, according to the participants\u2019 preferences. Trained research team members will carry them out after informed consent is signed and before administering the questionnaires and starting the intervention. Recordings will be\u00a0 de-identified and kept on safe online servers.\nPhase 2 (12 months) Phase 2 consists of the co-design and adaptations of the proposed intervention with JeA participants. Currently, the program does not have a mental health program that caters specifically to its beneficiaries. To design the intervention, the research team will invite JeA beneficiaries and staff to three group discussions led by a facilitator and based on co-design principles and practices. Participants will be\u00a0recruited using a list of beneficiaries who stated their interest in participating in qualitative research through the pre-pilot survey sent in Phase 1 Furthermore, participants who were interviewed in Phase 1 will also be\u00a0invited to participate in these interactions. These sessions will enable participants to share their perspectives on mental health issues for young people in Colombia and then discuss and refine the essential features of the intervention and its delivery strategies. The guiding questions to elicit opinions and points of view will focus on the acceptability of a digital platform and encourage the use of mental health platforms available on a trial basis (Appendix 2). If no changes are possible on the digital intervention, we\u00a0will listen to young people\u2019s\nviews about how this platform could be\u00a0better delivered and use this information to adapt our intervention framework. The refined intervention will then be\u00a0presented to JeA beneficiaries during a final co-design meeting to identify any more necessary adaptations. In this phase, we\u00a0will also pilot the survey from which we\u00a0will obtain the data."

To anticipate this possibility, we\u00a0will hold a virtual workshop with stakeholders (six JeA central staff and four from the FSFB) to draw a joint Theory of Change plan and a clear plan of action to launch the pilot study (Phase 3). The main stakeholders involved in the intervention development are JeA beneficiaries and staff. We\u00a0will aim to conduct this work in small groups of between 4 and 8 people for staff-only and beneficiaries-only discussions and 10\u201315 people for joint workshops, representing all the territories involved. Team members with experience in facilitating will plan each group session. These team members will also facilitate the workshops. Potential participants will be\u00a0 identified and recruited with the help of JeA staff members.\nPhase 3 (18 months) During Phase 3, we\u00a0will pilot the intervention to determine its feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and usefulness in \u2018real settings\u2019. Results will inform if the intervention improves clinical, educational and employment prospects among those who use it. A sample of beneficiaries studying in our areas of interest will be\u00a0 invited to participate in a survey containing measures of mental health human capital.

The digital intervention will not be\u00a0developed by the research team. Instead, we\u00a0will use a third-party platform (SilverCloud\u00ae) a virtual mental health platform with eight modules with different tools for comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms. This platform has been adapted for use by student populations that mainly attend private universities in Colombia and has proven to be\u00a0effective (25).\nThis program is designed to facilitate the participants\u2019 social and labor insertion. The intervention will target depression, anxiety, PTSD, and comorbidities. Participants from the intervention sites will be\u00a0classified in four levels of severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe) according to their scores in these three dimensions encompassing access to a mental-health digital platform and individualized care. They will be\u00a0 offered differential attention strategies (see Figure\u00a02). We\u00a0will use a transdiagnostic stepped-care intervention program, in which three levels of attention will be\u00a0in place to respond to the severity of the symptoms as determined by three screening questionnaires encompassing access to a mentalhealth digital platform and individualized care. This strategy has been planned to provide individualized care for those in severe conditions and considering the high degree of comorbidity documented in\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nconflict zones. The protocol also considers the number of sessions we\u00a0anticipate will be\u00a0amenable to our participants. Participants with moderate and mild symptoms will also have access to the digital platform. People with moderate symptoms will have a coach to monitor their progress while the platform is available; people with mild conditions will only be\u00a0offered the platform. Unlike previous mental health initiatives, we\u00a0 intend to ascertain how to foster the acceptability of a digital strategy, in our initial co-design phase, and the acceptability of personalized virtual sessions with our psychologists.\nAsymptomatic participants will receive an email with online resources and tools to help them manage their mental health, and they will not be\u00a0included as part of the study. The online resources are digital health and psychoeducation platforms that are available nationally and are part of the social outreach initiatives of the Fundaci\u00f3n Santa Fe de Bogota. Participants with mild symptoms will receive access to SilverCloud\u00ae, a virtual mental health platform with eight modules with different tools for comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms (26). This platform has been adapted for use by student populations that mainly attend private universities in Colombia, and has proven to be\u00a0effective (25). The access to the web-based platform will be\u00a0self-guided. They will also receive an invitation to participate in a mental health workshop in their territories.\nFor participants with moderate symptoms, the platform will also be\u00a0available, but in addition, asynchronous feedback will be\u00a0provided by trained guides (27). The asynchronous feedback will consist of motivational messages as the participants progress through the different modules. The platform also offers participants the opportunity to send messages to the guide and for the guide to respond. Those with severe symptoms will also access SilverCloud\u00ae with asynchronous feedback and receive a person-centered intervention delivered by trained psychologists face-to-face or virtually, depending on the participant\u2019s choice.\nA group of local psychologists will be\u00a0 trained on different evidence-based tools for depression and anxiety. The training will be\u00a0 done through virtual sessions, and they will receive a manual (developed by the research team on Phase 2) with a step-by-step guide\non the intervention. A pre-pilot of the intervention will be\u00a0done with 10\u201315 participants with severe scores to supervise adherence to the manual from the psychologists and adjust the protocol, if needed. The intervention is based on CBT and transdiagnostic techniques. It consists of up to five face-to-face or online sessions in which participants will be\u00a0 offered one introduction session with psychoeducation of depression and anxiety from a CBT approach, and at least two psychological tools depending on their symptoms. These tools will include problem-solving, behavioral activation, strengthening of social support, and reduction of safety behaviors. Psychologists will access the participant\u2019s screening scores and progress in SilverCloud\u00ae and choose the tools depending on what they observe in the first session. Participants will also receive a workbook containing infographic material on each tool that may be\u00a0suggested for use by the participants by the psychologists during individualized sessions. Additionally, psychologists will regularly meet with a clinical psychiatrist to discuss participants\u2019 progress.\nThis strategy has been planned to provide individualized care for those in severe conditions and considering the high degree of comorbidity documented in conflict zones. The protocol also considers the number of sessions we\u00a0anticipate will be\u00a0amenable to our participants. Unlike previous mental health initiatives, we\u00a0intend to ascertain how to foster the acceptability of a digital strategy, and the acceptability of personalized virtual sessions with psychologists.\nParticipants from the control groups will not receive the intervention until the measures are completed. Afterwards, they will receive access to SilverCloud\u00ae (self-guided) and an email with mental health promotion tools. Those who are at risk and need specialized mental health attention (e.g., those with suicidal risk) will be\u00a0referred to the psychologist of their institutions.\nThe intervention lasts 16 weeks (4 months), approximately. Phase 3 also includes: one month of recruitment and meetings with the universities and staff from each territory, baseline interview, intervention, endline interview (immediately after the intervention, open for a couple weeks while we\u00a0 reach the target number of participants), follow up (3 months after the deadline), data analysis and presentation of results to the territories.\nFIGURE\u00a02 Flow chart of strategies offer within the stepped-care mental health program intervention sites to four levels of severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nStudy design, sample, and recruitment"

This approach considers human capital as an outcome embodied in individuals by exploring the variation in individual knowledge (cognitive skills captured by academic performance) and individual abilities\nFIGURE\u00a03 Summary of pilot study phases.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\n(non-cognitive skills acquired as life competencies). Thus, we\u00a0will look at the magnitude of mental health-based rehabilitation on young adult students across different dimensions of mental health (depression and anxiety, fundamentally), which is considered beneficial due to human capital accumulation.\nSince individual observations will be\u00a0collected in different regions, we\u00a0 will adjust for clustered data. In the absence of treatment randomization that assures that treatment and control groups are exchangeable, this quasi-experimental design helps us to control for time-invariant differences between treatment and control areas by focusing on changes, rather than levels, in outcomes. To address bias from time-varying confounders, we\u00a0will incorporate controls for timevarying factors in all analyses. We\u00a0will all report the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, along with their commodities and the effectiveness outcome, which will be\u00a0the proportion of participants with a reduction in their baseline symptoms.

JeA is a major national program of the Colombian government to decrease economic disparities by promoting post-secondary education among vulnerable young people from low-income backgrounds. Yet, participants in the program face major mental health problems and lack adequate access to treatment and support. Our project aims to test the impact of a stepped-care mental health intervention that offers digital and professional mental health support to students with symptoms of depression, anxiety or PTSD who live in conflict-affected areas in Colombia. The study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and it will assess its effectiveness to improve the mental health and human capital outcomes of beneficiaries.\nFindings from this study will help identify strategies to address mental health problems among socioeconomically vulnerable young people that can be\u00a0adapted to different contexts in in low and middleincome countries. Our study will help to address a research gap on the implementation and efficacy of transdiagnostic stepped-care interventions that incorporate a digital mental health component for young people, an important gap highlighted in recent reports (14). Through collaboration with the Government department responsible for implementation, we\u00a0 also aim to provide evidence that will potentially enable long-term adoption of the intervention in the Youth in Action program. Our findings will have an important impact for victims of the conflict, whose mental health is now established as a priority in law, though evidence of the effectiveness of interventions is lacking. Should a digital mental health intervention be\u00a0shown to be\u00a0 both feasible and effective, policies may support digital interventions as a way to improve access for people displaced by the conflict and struggling to access in person treatment."
