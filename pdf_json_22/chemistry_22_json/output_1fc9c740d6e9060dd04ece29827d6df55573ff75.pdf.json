    "abstractText": "The liver is vulnerable to oxidative attacks from heavy metals, such as iron, as well as some drugs, including acetaminophen. It has been shown that enhanced oxidative stress in the liver leads to excessive ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in organ injury. The beneficial effects of Spatholobi Caulis (SC), a natural herbal medicine, include treating ischemic stroke, inhibiting tumor cell invasion, pro-angiogenic activities, and anti-inflammatory properties. Scientific studies on its effects against hepatotoxic reagents (e.g., iron and acetaminophen), as well as their underlying mechanisms, are insufficient. This study examined the antioxidant effects and mechanisms of SC in vitro and in vivo. In cells, the proinflammatory mediator, arachidonic acid (AA), plus iron, significantly induced an increase in ROS generation, the damage in mitochondrial membrane potential, and the resulting apoptosis, which were markedly blocked by SC. More importantly, SC affected the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related proteins, which were vital to regulating oxidative stress in cells. In addition, SC mediated the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP)-related proteins. Among the active compounds in SC, the procyanidin B2, but not liquiritigenin, daidzein, and genistein, significantly inhibited the cytotoxicity induced by AA + iron, and activated the LKB1-AMPK pathway. In mice, the oral administration of SC alleviated the elevations of ALT and histological changes by the acetaminophen-induced liver injury. These results reveal the potential of SC and a key bioactive component, procyanidin B2, as antioxidant candidates for hepatoprotection.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress contributes to the progression of various diseases in humans [1,2]. In particular, chronic liver damage caused by oxidative stress can progress to hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and liver cancer [3,4]. Oxidative stress results in the excessive production of oxidative free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [5]. ROS generated in the normal aerobic metabolism perform intracellular signaling molecules in various biological processes [6]. In addition, it enhances the immunologic defense against bacteria and other pathogens [7]. On the other hand, the excessive production of ROS sometimes leads to cellular dysfunction, including mitochondrial DNA mutations, hyperactivation of inflammatory responses, and inflammation [8]. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an essential enzyme in regulating cellular energy homeostasis. It is activated by increased intracellular AMP and changes in the ADP/ATP ratios, such as hypoglycemia, hypoxia, high-intensity exercise, and ischemia [9]. The activation of AMPK enhances glucose uptake and inhibits gluconeogenesis. In addition, it promotes fatty acid oxidation and inhibits fat synthesis and cholesterol synthesis [10]. Therefore, it is expected to be important in preventing and treating metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [11]. Moreover, the activation of AMPK has been reported to protect cardiac muscle cells, osteoblastic cells, nerve cells, and liver cells [12\u201315].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13730. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232213730 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13730 2 of 13\nThe Hippo\u2013Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway is a kinase cascade that regulates vital cellular functions; in this pathway, the YAP is a key transcriptional regulator [16]. In previous studies, the activation of AMPK and inhibition of YAP indicated hepatocellular protection, suggesting that the AMPK pathway and Hippo\u2013YAP are connected [17]. It has been reported that YAP attenuated acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity [18]. A previous study reported that regulating AMPK signaling and YAP pathways attenuated CCl4-induced acute liver injury in mice [19]. Spatholobi Caulis (SC), a dried vine of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn included in Leguminosae, has reported effects on the treatment of ischemic stroke, inhibition of tumor cell invasion and pro-angiogenic activity, and anti-hepatitis C virus activity [20\u201323]. In addition, SC can potentially prevent deep vein thrombosis through anti-inflammation by promoting SIRT1 and Nrf2 expression [24], and induce an increase in anti-obesity by upregulation of the AMPK pathway in mice [25]. On the other hand, there have been few studies on the hepatoprotective effects of SC and its mechanism. Based on the reported studies, it was hypothesized that SC would protect hepatocytes by inhibiting oxidative stress, possibly related to the activation of AMPK-related signaling. This study examined the protective effect of SC against cytotoxicity induced by arachidonic acid (AA) + iron treatment in vitro and acute acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo. In addition, the signaling pathway affecting the antioxidant effects of SC was demonstrated, and the hepatoprotective effects of a critical bioactive component of SC were verified."

            "text": "Drugs and therapeutic candidates with cytoprotective effects have been reported to inhibit oxidative stress via AMPK activation and the induction of antioxidant enzymes [26]. Rifampicin, an antibiotic, activates the LKB1-AMPK pathway to suppress oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in liver cells [27]. Metformin, a medication for diabetes, has been reported to prevent vascular damage by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through AMPK activation [28]. Rhizoma Coptidis, a medicinal herb, and its bioactive component, berberine, have pharmaceutical potential for aging-related diseases by anti-oxidation and AMPK activation [29]. Activation of the LKB1-AMPK pathway by Liqustri lucidi Fructus protected hepatocytes and alleviated acute hepatic injury in an in vivo model [30]. In the present study, SC protected hepatocytes against oxidative stress induced by AA + iron through mediation with the AMPK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. The Hippo\u2013Yap pathway is another crucial regulator in cell protection. Upon activation of the Hippo signaling pathway, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 included in the Hippo pathway kinase cascade are phosphorylated, which directly phosphorylates and inactivates YAP and TAZ [31,32]. The inactivation of YAP/TAZ interferes with its localization into the cell and inhibits the formation of a complex with TEAD, a YAP target transcription factor. As a result, the inhibition of YAP/TAZ and TEAD complex formation does not lead to the expression of the target genes that regulate the cell cycle, cell migration, and cell fate [31,32]. It has also been shown that AMPK-dependent LATS phosphorylation induced YAP phosphorylation, and AMPK sometimes directly phosphorylates the YAP Ser94 residue, the site of interaction with TEAD [33,34]. In this study, SC regulated the Yap signals under the AMPK pathway, which helps protect the hepatocytes against oxidative stress induced by AA + iron. In the cell assays, the AA + iron model was enrolled to test the effects of SC on oxidative stress. AA increases the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and impairs the regulation of hepatic and adipose function, predisposing to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [35]. In hepatocytes, a high ratio of omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid, AA) to omega-3 fatty acids may promote the lipogenic pathways and induce high levels of ROS production, which can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction [36]. The excessive production of intracellular ROS activates phospholipase A2, which hydrolyzes phospholipase and fatty acids that form the cell membrane, and results in the release of AA [37]. The isolated AA increases ROS, which is linked to impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity [38,39]. Consequently, excessive ROS causes liver disease and activates hepatic stellate cells, which are one of the keys to liver injury and fibrogenesis [40]. Iron is another key component of oxygen transport and storage and is stored in the liver, muscles, spleen, and bone marrow. On the other hand, excess iron deposition generates ROS, which leads to liver injury and hepatic fibrosis through several mechanisms [41]. In addition, iron overload enhances AA release and eicosanoid production in cardiomyocytes and induces cardiomyopathy [42]. A combined treatment of AA and iron, which induces synergistic cytotoxicity, is considered a model of oxidative stress-induced hepatocellular injury [43,44]. In previous studies applying the AA and iron model, AA + iron-induced cytotoxicity led to ROS generation, GSH reduction, and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes [45,46]. In this study, PCB2 was active in the aspect of the antioxidant effects of SC. PCB2 contained in grape seeds, apples, and cacao beans has been reported to be the major bioactive component of SC [47]. Previous studies showed that PCB2 had anti-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelial cells, inhibited neurological deficits and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, and alleviated chronic nonbacterial prostatitis [48\u201350]. PCB2 attenuates colitis-associated cancer formation by inhibiting oxidative stress and diet-induced hepatic steatosis [51,52]. In particular, it protects hepatocytes against CCl4-induced acute hepatotoxicity [53]. In in vitro experiments, we applied HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines derived from humans. These three kinds of cell lines represent epithelial features and well-differentiated HCC in the early phases [54\u201356]. Using a line of cells, it is possible to observe variously the expression level and time of major signal\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 13730 9 of 13\ntransduction proteins. In particular, it was observed that the activation time of the molecules by the drug was slightly different in signal transduction, including AMPK. The effects of SC and PCB2 in the cells derived from other animals need to be confirmed in the future. In animals, the acute hepatic damage model induced by APAP was used. The annual incidence of acute liver failure is approximately 5.5 per million of the population, and most acute liver failure cases are drug-induced hepatotoxicity [57]. In particular, intentional or unintentional acetaminophen overdose explained 46% of cases in the United States [58]. Although acute liver failure is uncommon, interest and study continue in multiple disciplines because it affects all organ systems and has a mortality rate of 30% [59]. The mechanism of APAP-induced liver cell death is the release of intermembrane proteins, such as endonuclease G, which induces DNA fragmentation via the induction of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition caused by enhanced oxidative stress [60]. Therefore, APAP is important in drug-induced hepatotoxicity as assessed by disruption of the cellular defense system and induction of mitochondrial dysfunction [61,62]. In this study, SC inhibited APAP-induced liver failure, which means SC has protective effects in vivo."

PCB2, a representative component of SC, inhibited cytotoxicity and activated the LKB1-AMPK pathway, a key bioactive component. In mice, oral injection of SC ameliorates APAP-induced liver injury and phosphorylates AMPK in the liver. These results reveal the potential of SC and key bioactive components as candidates for hepatoprotection via antioxidants.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigated the study design, performed the experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the draft manuscript, S.-J.B.; performed the experiments, S.B.B.; developed the study design and initial idea, revised the manuscript and acquired the funding, Y.W.K.
