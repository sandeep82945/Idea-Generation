 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of other naturally occurring oxyprenylated coumarins on mitochondrial function when exposed to stressors like pesticides. The paper found auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin had protective effects, so studying other similar compounds could reveal new therapeutic agents. 

2. Further explore the mechanism of action of auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in protecting mitochondria from pesticide damage. Understanding the specific biomolecular pathways involved could help optimize their usage. 

3. Test auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to see if they provide neuroprotection in vivo. The paper suggests they could be beneficial for such conditions.  

4. Investigate the effects of auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin on mitochondrial function in other cell types beyond the bronchial epithelial cells used in this study. Determining their efficacy across multiple tissue types would broaden their therapeutic potential.

5. Explore the use of auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin as additives to pesticide formulations to mitigate mitochondrial damage. Their protective effects could make pesticide use safer if they are co-administered.
