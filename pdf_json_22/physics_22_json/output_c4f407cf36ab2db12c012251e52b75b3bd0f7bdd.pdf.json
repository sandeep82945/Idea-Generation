    "abstractText": "Investigating the physical and chemical structures of massive star-forming regions is critical for understanding the formation and the early evolution of massive stars. We performed a detailed line survey toward six dense cores named as MM1, MM4, MM6, MM7, MM8, and MM11 in G9.62+0.19 star-forming region resolved in ALMA band 3 observations. Toward these cores, about 172 transitions have been identified and attributed to 16 species including organic Oxygen-, Nitrogen-, Sulfur-bearing molecules and their isotopologues. Four dense cores MM7, MM8, MM4, and MM11 are line rich sources. Modeling of these spectral lines reveals the rotational temperature in a range of 72\u2212115 K, 100\u2212163 K, 102\u2212204 K, and 84\u2212123 K for the MM7, MM8, MM4, and MM11, respectively. The molecular column densities are 1.6 \u00d7 1015 \u2212 9.2 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 toward the four cores. The cores MM8 and MM4 show chemical difference between Oxygenand Nitrogen-bearing species, i.e., MM4 is rich in oxygen-bearing molecules while nitrogen-bearing molecules especially vibrationally excited HC3N lines are mainly observed in MM8. The distinct initial temperature at accretion phase may lead to this N/O differentiation. Through analyzing column densities and spatial distributions of O-bearing Complex Organic Molecules (COMs), we found that C2H5OH and CH3OCH3 might have a common precursor, CH3OH. CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 are likely chemically linked. In addition, the observed variation in HC3N and HC5N emission may indicate that their different formation mechanism at hot and cold regions.",

            "text": "High-mass stars play a major role in the evolution of the galaxies. They affect the formation and evolution of planets, stars, and galaxies (Kennicutt 1998; Bally et al. 2005). But the formation process of high-mass star remains much less understood because of their comparatively larger distances and shorter lifetimes than low-mass star. In addition, high-mass stars are usually born in complicated cluster environments. The process of star formation will inevitably be influenced by nearby protostars (Krumholz et al. 2014), which complicates the physical and chemical structures of high-mass star formation. During the earliest phases high-mass stars remain embedded in their natal molecular clouds. Observationally, their embedded phases can generally be subdivided into four different evolutionary stages: massive dense cores (including starless cores), highmass protostellar objects (HMPOs), hot molecular cores (HMCs), and Hyper/ultra compact Hii regions (H/UC Hii) (e.g., Kurtz et al. 2000; Hoare et al. 2007; Beltr\u00e1n et al. 2009; Tan et al. 2013; Liu et\n? E-mail: pyp893@163.com \u2020 E-mail: liutie@shao.ac.cn\nal. 2021). Investigating the physical and chemical properties of highmass star forming cores at different evolutionary stages is important for understanding the formation and early evolution of massive stars.\nG9.62+0.19 is a well known high-mass star forming region at a distance of 5.2 kpc (Sanna et al. 2009), which hosts several massive cores at different evolutionary phases (e.g., Testi et al. 1998; Hofner et al. 1994, 2001; Liu et al. 2017). Multi-wavelength VLA observations identified nine radio continuum sources (denoted as AI) in this region (Garay et al. 1993; Testi et al. 2000). The extended Hii region \"A\", cometary-shaped Hii region \"B\" and compact Hii region \"C\" are three evolved Hii regions (Kurtz et al. 1994). The JCMT/SCUBA 450 \u00b5m observations found that new generations of high-mass young stellar objects (\"G9.62 clump\") are forming in the region which is located to the east of the evolved Hii regions (Liu et al. 2011, 2017). Twelve dense cores (MM1-MM12) have been identified in this clump through 1.3 mm observations with ALMA (Liu et al. 2017). Recent ALMA observations at 1 mm wavelength (band 7) with higher resolution further resolved \"G9.62 clump\" into 23 dense cores (Dall \u2032 Olio et al. 2019). Among of them, MM4, MM7, MM8, and MM11 are associated with radio sources \"E\", \"G\", \"F\", and \"D\", respectively. Five cores (MM4/E, MM6, MM7/G, MM8/F\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n12 25\n5v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n2 3"

            "text": "and MM11/D) are considered as high-mass protostars. Based on observations of CH3OH vt =1 line and the existence of the outflow, Liu et al. (2017) further classified their evolutionary sequence as following: MM6 (HMPO), MM7 (early HMC), MM8 (HMC), MM4 (late HMC or HC Hii), and MM11 (UC Hii). Presence of collimated SiO (5-4) and CO (2-1) outflows and absence of CH3OH vt =1 emission in MM6 are indicative of it to be at HMPO stage. MM7 and MM8 are associated with centimeter continuum emission (Testi et al. 2000), outflows, and strong CH3OH vt =1 line emission, and are thus at comparatively more evolved stage than MM6. CH3OCHO vt=1 was detected toward the MM8 while not for MM7, indicating that MM8 is hotter and older than MM7. MM4 has centimeter continuum counterpart (Testi et al. 2000), while no outflows implying MM4 to be at a more evolved phase. Weaker CH3OH vt =1 emission toward MM11 than MM4 suggest that MM11 should be at a more evolved phase, since the abundance of CH3OH should be close to maximum at hot core stage and decrease in the UC Hii phase (Gerner et al. 2014). The other seven cores (MM1, MM2, MM3, MM5, MM9, MM10, and MM12) are considered to be starless core as they do not show any signature of outflows. They only show the signature of rare interstellar molecules, especially complex organic molecules (COMs). Su et al. (2005) reported that many molecular lines including Nitrogenbearing molecules and organic molecules have been detected toward the source F(MM8) and E(MM4) in G9.62+0.19 by Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations (345 GHz). In general, G9.62+0.19 contains different evolutionary types of dense cores, and harbours rich chemistry indicating that it is an ideal object to explore the distinct chemical properties of cores at different evolutionary stages.\nInterstellar molecules especially the COMs are useful diagnosis to study the interstellar environments and evolutionary stages of various astronomical sources since they usually exist in special physical environments. COMs have been detected in warm regions including hot cores in high-mass star-forming regions such as SgrB2(N) (e.g., Belloche et al. 2013, 2016, 2017; Bonfand et al. 2019), G31.41+0.31 (e.g., Rivilla et al. 2017b; Mininni et al. 2020; Colzi et al. 2021), AFGL 4176 (B\u00f8gelund et al. 2019), NGC 6334I (e.g., Zernickel et al. 2012; B\u00f8gelund et al. 2018; Ligterink et al. 2020), W51 e2 (Remijan et al. 2004a; Rivilla et al. 2017a), G34.3+0.2 (Lykke et al. 2015), Orion KL (e.g., Crockett et al. 2014; Cernicharo et al. 2016; Tercero et al. 2018), G331.512-0.103 (Herv\u00edas-Caimapo et al. 2019; Duronea et al. 2019) and hot corinos in low-mass starforming regions such as NGC 1333-IRAS 2A and -IRAS 4A (Taquet et al. 2015), IRAS 16293-2422 (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2012; Richard et al. 2013), and in cold environments such as dark clouds (TMC-1 (e.g., McGuire et al. 2018; Ag\u00fandez et al. 2021) and L134N (Dickens et al. 2000)), starless cores (e.g., Bacmann et al. 2012; Vastel et al. 2014; Jim\u00e9nez-Serra et al. 2016; Molet et al. 2019), and cold outer envelopes of protostars (e.g., \u00d6berg et al. 2010; Bergner et al. 2017), Galatic Center molecular clouds such as G-0.02-0.07, G-0.11-0.08, and G+0.693-0.027 (Requena-Torres et al. 2006, 2008; Zeng et al. 2018; Rodr\u00edguez-Almeida et al. 2021), and the disk of an outbursting young star, V883 Ori (Lee et al. 2019). The chemistry in different interstellar environments, and the formation of COMs in these environments are complex and long-standing quest that has been explored by many researches in the past several years (e.g., Herbst & van Dishoeck. 2009; Laas et al. 2011; Bacmann et al. 2012; Woods et al. 2013; Vasyunin & Herbst. 2013; Ruaud et al. 2015; Abplanalp et al. 2016; Skouteris et al. 2018; Shingledecker et al. 2019). Yet, there remain huge challenges for revealing a clearer picture of COMs formation. Fundamentally, the chemistry is the result of interactions of different physical and chemical parameters that are tangled with each other, with the former includes but not limited to the tempera-\nture, density and evolutionary stages of the cores, and the later primarily depends on the elemental content, grain mantle compositions and reaction network that represents the chemical contents of the cores. Thus, when the physical properties of the core are well constrained, the observational results, such as the column density and abundance of individual molecule and the correlations between different molecules, could be used to retrieve the intrinsic chemical properties.\nHere we preform a detailed analysis of the physical and chemical conditions (e.g., temperature, density, and possible chemical formation routes of COMs) of dense cores in G9.62+0.19 through ALMA band 3 observations. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the observations and the data reduction. The results for continuum and line survey are presented in Sect. 3. We model the spectral lines and calculate the parameters under the LTE assumption in Sect. 4. A general discussion about properties of each core and chemical differentiation among these cores is presented in Sect. 5. In Sect.6 we give our summary, with a possibility of future investigations of massive star formation at different evolutionary stages."

Six dense cores (MM1, MM4, MM6, MM7, MM8, and MM11) that have been previously observed by 1.3 mm continuum emission with higher angular resolution (0.94\u2032\u2032 \u00d70.71\u2032\u2032) (Liu et al. 2017) in G9.62 clump are also resolved in our 3 mm data. The positions of MM2, MM3, MM5, MM9, and MM10 are also marked in Figure 1. However, these cores are not resolved in 3 mm map possibly because of the relatively lower spatial resolution of our observations. The expanding cometary-like Hii region \"B\" is observed to the west of the G9.62 clump (see Figure 2). The positions, sizes, peak flux density (Ipeak) and total flux density (S \u03bd) of six dense cores obtained by two dimensional Gaussian fitting are listed in Table 1. We found that the size, Ipeak and S \u03bd of each core observed from combined data are larger than those from 12-m observations alone, since 12-m array observations are affected by missing flux, then extended emission is not sampled completely. The observations of 12-m array missed \u223c 5% of extended emissions compared to the observations of 12-m + ACA combined data. More information on continuum emission also can be found in Liu et al.

The software includes myXCLASS program, which is used to model data by solving the radiative transfer equation. Under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), XCLASS takes the beam dilution, dust attenuation, the line opacity, and line blending into account (M\u00f6ller et al. 2017). A few constraints are set for proper identification of the molecular species. The rest frequency must be consistent with the value from laboratory measurement; for a certain species, all detected transitions from the same source must have a similar LSR velocity; and transitions for a specific species should have similar spatial distribution owing to that they are excited by similar conditions (Peng et al. 2017). Furthermore, all lines above the 3\u03c3 \"detection level\" are available in our identification and follow-up analyses. The spectrum from 12-m array observations are used for line identification and following data modeling. In the Appendix A, we make a comparison between 12-m array and combined data, suggesting there is no difference when using them to study the hot core chemistry."

Analyzed the spatial distribution, we note that on the whole, transitions with low upper-level energy are expected to trace more extended and diffuse gas structures than with high upper-level energy. Three main results for emissions of O-, N-, and S-bearing species are as follows:\n(i) Emission of CH3OH v=0 covers extended parts, while emission of its torsional state CH3OH vt=1 with higher upper-level energy only distributes over the four dense cores MM4, MM7, MM8, and MM11. The spatial distributions of CH3OCHO vt=1 and C2H5OH concentrate on MM4 and MM8, the other O-bearing molecules primarily originate from MM4, MM7, MM8, and MM11 (see Figure 5). Meanwhile, the emission from MM4 is stronger than that from MM8 for O-bearing species except for CH3CHO. The gas distributions of CH3CHO extended to the eastern region, which is likely to be affected by an outflow.\n(ii) Figure 6a shows the spatial distribution of HC3N v=0, covering a large scale and extending to MM1 and MM11. In addition, an outflow originating from MM6 along the northeast-southwest direction is also traced by HC3N v=0. Emission of its isotopologues HC13CCN v=0 peaks at MM4, MM7, and MM8, since isotopic molecules trace denser and more optically thin gas compare to its main species. HC3N in vibrationally excited state v7=1 peaks at MM4, MM7, and MM8, and higher energy v6=1 (747 K) only\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)\nATOMS X 5\npeaks toward the MM8, implying MM8 to have very warm environment. Nitrogen-bearing molecule C2H5CN has similar emission with those of HC13CCN v=0 and HC3N v7=1. Unlike the above Oxygen-bearing species that mainly peak at the position of MM4, the strongest emission of these N-bearing species is mostly located at MM8 with the exception of HC5N for which the strongest emission is associated with MM4. Moreover, there is offset between its main emission peak and continuum emission peak MM4. A similar scenario is also seen for MM7 (see Figure 6e).\n(iii) Similar to N-bearing species, S-bearing molecules mainly come from the MM4, MM7, and MM8. Observation shows that SO with low Eu=9 K and CS trace very extended regions. Furthermore, the collimated northeast-southwest outflow that comes from MM6 can be seen in CS and SO (Eu = 9 K) emission. The gas emission of SO2 v2=1 with Eu of 900 K is very compact and peaks at MM8. Emission of CH3SH in low energy (Eu = 14 K) also comes from MM8, but it is not extremely compact."

            "text": "The fractional abundance of a certain molecule relative to H2 (\u03c7 = NT/NH2 ) can be estimated from the source-averaged total column density of the certain molecule and that of the molecular hydrogen. With assumption of optically thin emission from dust, the column density of H2 can be derived by using the following equation (e.g., Frau et al. 2010; Bonfand et al. 2019; Gieser et al. 2021):\nNH2 = S \u03bd\u03b7\n\u00b5mH\u2126\u03ba\u03bdB\u03bd(Td) , (1)\nwhere S\u03bd is the total integrated flux of the continuum, \u03b7 = 100 is gasto-dust mass ratio (Lis et al. 1991; Hasegawa et al. 1992), \u00b5 =2.8 is the mean molecular mass per H2 molecule (Kauffmann et al. 2008), mH is the mass of the hydrogen atom, \u2126 is the solid angle subtended by the source, \u03ba\u03bd is the dust absorption coefficient per unit density, and B\u03bd(Td) is the Planck function at the dust temperature Td.\nThe dust temperature should equal to the rotation temperature of the core derived from COMs, since gas and dust are expected to be thermally coupled well at density higher than 106 cm\u22123 (Goldsmith 2001). In our case, the H2 densities at four cores are larger than 106 cm\u22123 (see Table 3). We use the dust continuum emission to estimate the column density of H2. However, at 3 mm observations, free-free emission from ionized gas could contribute to the continuum emission (detailed analyses are provided in Liu et al. 2020a, 2021), which will overestimate the column density of H2. Instead, we use 1.3 mm continuum data from Liu et al. (2017), and smooth it to the same spatial resolution as that of 3 mm continuum data. \u03ba\u03bd of 0.899 cm2g\u22121 at 1.3 mm for dust grains with thin ice mantles at a gas density of 106 cm\u22123 is adopted (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). The NH2 derived from 1.3 mm continuum emission are: (2.3\u00b10.2) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 for MM7, (3.8\u00b10.3) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 for MM8, (3.3\u00b10.4) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 for MM4 and (2.8\u00b10.2) \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 for MM11. The mean optical depth of continuum can be calculated by (e.g., Frau et al. 2010; Gieser et al. 2021)\n\u03c4\u03bd = \u2212ln ( 1\u2212 S\u03bd\n\u2126B\u03bd(Td)\n) . (2)\nThe derived \u03c4\u03bd toward four cores are on the order of 10\u22122, guaranteeing reliable H2 column density. Toward four cores, the deconvolved sizes, dust temperatures, total flux densities, values of optical depth, column densities of H2, and volume densities of H2 are listed in Table 3.\nThe fractional abundances of different species at each position are given in Table 2. Toward four cores (MM4, MM7, MM8 and MM11), H2CCO has the lowest abundance, compared with other O-bearing molecules. The abundances of O-bearing COMs such as CH3OH, CH3OCHO, C2H5OH and CH3OCH3 toward MM4 are higher than that toward MM8, while the abundance of C2H5CN is largest toward MM8."

            "text": "In this section we mainly discuss the physical parameters of detected H2CCO, HC5N and other complex molecules. We also compare molecular abundances with respect to H2 and CH3OH derived in our work with those derived in other sources including highmass star forming regions (HMSFRs), low-mass star forming regions (LMSFRs) and Galactic Center molecular clouds (GCMCs). Molecular abundances for individual source and corresponding references can be found in Table 5. Figure 8 shows the molecular abundance with respect to H2 toward the sources in Table 5. On average, H2CCO, CH3CHO, and CH3COCH3, which have mean abundances of 8.8\u00d710\u22129 \u2212 3.4\u00d710\u22128 (see Table 5), are relatively less abundant than other six COMs in HMSFRs, while CH3OH, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO and C2H5CN are usually rich in these sources. They are 1.2\u00d710\u22127 \u2212 3.4\u00d710\u22126 in molecular abundances. In addition, averaged abundances of C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, C2H5CN and CH3SH from HMSFRs are higher than those from LMSFRs and GCMCs by almost 1-3 orders of magnitude. The following is the detailed discussion for each species:\nKetene (H2CCO): When compared the rotational temperatures Trot (72\u2212102 K) and abundance \u03c7 ((6.0\u221215.0) \u00d7 10\u22129) of H2CCO with those of other O-bearing species, H2CCO has the lowest Trot and \u03c7 in the four cores (MM4, MM7, MM8, and MM11). It suggests that this molecule is not produced in very hot and compact regions, but rather in warm envelopes compared to other species. Previous observations show that H2CCO has been detected in massive starforming regions such as Sgr B2 (e.g., Turner 1977; Nummelin et al. 2000) and Orion KL (Johansson et al. 1984; Crockett et al. 2014), cold dark cloud TMC-1 (Ohishi et al. 1991), and several deeply embedded protostars like NGC 6334I and NGC 7538 I1 (Ruiterkamp et al. 2007). Furthermore, these observations reveal that H2CCO has abundances of \u223c 10\u221210 relative to H2, which is slightly lower than the values of the four cores (MM7, MM8, MM4, and MM11) of G9.62+0.19. Previous observations also shown that H2CCO is more abundant in the cooler and extended region (Maity et al. 2014).\nAcetaldehyde (CH3CHO): Under the assumption of fixed temperature, relatively lower column densities ((3.4\u22125.3) \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122) and abundances ((1.3\u22121.6) \u00d7 10\u22128) of CH3CHO are obtained toward four cores than that for other species. Moreover, the spatial distribution of CH3CHO is not well coincident with the positions of MM4, MM8, and MM11. It might imply that CH3CHO tend to trace more externally extended gas.\nMethanol (CH3OH): CH3OH v=0 has high abundances between 7.1\u00d710\u22127 and 2.3\u00d710\u22126 toward four cores. This species is efficiently formed in molecular clouds from early to evolved stage. The gas distributions cover a more extended region. The much higher temperature (204 K) and abundance (2.8\u00d710\u22126) for CH3OH in the first excited torsional state (vt=1) derived toward MM4. CH3OH vt=1 with very high excitation energy should originate from a very warm and compact region.\nEthanol (C2H5OH): The abundances toward MM7 ((4.8\u00b11.0)\u00d710\u22128), MM8 ((5.5\u00b11.9)\u00d710\u22128), and MM11 (\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)"

The abundance increases to (1.4\u00b10.2)\u00d710\u22127 toward MM4. The derived temperature are 149\u00b132 K for MM8 and 131\u00b14 K for MM4, which is consistent with the understanding that C2H5OH usually has rotational temperature higher than 100 K in in massive hot cores (e.g., Bisschop et al. 2007). Column density ratios between C2H5OH and CH3OH in four dense cores range from 0.037 to 0.061 (see Table 5), which consistent with the mean value 0.064+0.066\u22120.041 measured from several HMSFRs (Taquet et al. 2015).\nDimethyl ether (CH3OCH3): CH3OCH3 is an isomer of C2H5OH. It has a lower temperature (MM8: 111\u00b130 K, MM4: 106\u00b113 K) than C2H5OH. The CH3OCH3/C2H5OH abundance ratios are \u223c1.6, 2.3, 1.4, and 3.2 toward MM7, MM8, MM4, and MM11, respectively, indicating that CH3OCH3 is more abundant than C2H5OH in dense cores. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Figure 8 that abundances of CH3OCH3 are generally higher than those of C2H5OH in HMSFRs. Also, the averaged abundance ratio between CH3OCH3 and C2H5OH for those regions is around 2.5. The abundances of two species are nearly same for three LMSFRs IRAS 16293-2422B, NGC 1333-IRAS 2A, and NGC 1333-IRAS 4A. The formation efficiency of these two isomers in various environments may be different.\nMethyl Formate (CH3OCHO): For the G9.62+0.19, its temperatures are between 108 K and 152 K. The abundance increases by an order of magnitude from MM7 (4.8\u00d710\u22128) to MM4 (3.9\u00d710\u22127). The rotational temperatures of ground state and first torsional excited state are similar considering the uncertainties. This is consistent with the findings of Favre et al. (2011), who obtained similar temperatures between CH3OCHO v=0 and CH3OCHO vt=1 in Orion KL region. Taquet et al. (2015) gives an averaged CH3OCHO abundance with respect to CH3OH of 0.14+0.18\u22120.06 for HMSFRs. The\nabundances in our three cores MM4, MM8, and MM11 are 0.17, 0.15, and 0.16, respectively, which are consistent with 0.14+0.18\u22120.06. However, the abundance of 0.037 toward MM7 are lower than the mean value derived in other HMSFRs.\nAcetone (CH3COCH3): CH3COCH3 shows low temperature (100\u2212113 K) and abundance (2.6\u00d710\u22128 \u2212 3.3\u00d7 10\u22128) in MM8 and MM4. The abundances are larger than those derived from Orion KL hot core and compact ridge regions (\u223c 10\u22129 for Orion KL; see Table 5).\nEthyl Cyanide (C2H5CN): C2H5CN is usually used as a hot core tracer because of its high rotational temperature. We found that the temperatures are 115\u00b126 K, 140\u00b121 K and 124\u00b121 K for the MM7, MM8 and MM4, respectively. It may be destroyed by UV radiation in the MM11 region. Its abundance is larger by nearly one order of magnitude toward MM8 than that toward MM7 and MM4. Furthermore, C2H5CN abundances toward HMSFRs (average value of \u223c10\u22127) are obviously higher than those toward LMSFRs and GCMCs (\u223c10\u221210) (see Table 5).\nCyanobutadiyne (HC5N): Because fewer than three lines were detected, Trot and NT could not be obtained from spectral line fits. We derived column densities and abundances of HC5N v=0 toward three cores with the assumption of Trot = 99 K, 134 K, and 137 K for MM7, MM8, and MM4, respectively. The derived HC5N abundance in the range of (7.0\u221218) \u00d7 10\u221210 are slightly lower than that in other four hot cores G10.30-0.15, G12.89+0.49, G16.86-2.16 and G28.28-0.36 (6.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 \u2212 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22129) (Taniguchi et al. 2017) and in Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 (1.9 \u00d7 10\u22129) (Zeng et al. 2018), and slightly higher than the value measured from L1527 (WCCC) ((1.2\u00b10.3) \u00d7 10\u221210) (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2002; Sakai & Yamamoto 2013). A very low HC5N abundance, 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221211 has been measured toward the outer cold envelope of IRAS 16293 (Jaber et al. 2017). The peaks of the gas emission are not well associated with the continuum peaks MM4, MM7 and MM8. Such results seem to imply that HC5N is not excited in the densest part of three dense cores, especially for MM4 and MM7. Fontani et al. (2017) also found that the emission of HC5N in the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4 is not associated with continuum emission.\nMethyl Mercaptan (CH3SH): Few S-bearing COMs has been detected in the ISM so far. As one of the simplest S-bearing COMs, CH3SH has been detected in a few high-mass star-forming regions like Sgr B2(N) (M\u00fcller et al. 2016), Orion KL (Kolesnikov\u00e1 2014), G327.3-6 (Gibb et al. 2000) and G31.41+0.31 (Gorai et al. 2021), low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 (Majumdar et al. 2016), and Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 (Rodr\u00edguezAlmeida et al. 2021). In these sources, CH3SH has the temperature range \u223c 68\u2212200 K and abundance from 1.0\u00d710\u22129 to 9.4\u00d710\u22128 for above hot cores, but lower temperature (32 K) and abundance (5.0\u00d710\u221210) for solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422, a much\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)\nATOMS X 13\nlower temperatures of 8.5\u221214.9 K and abundance of 4.8\u00d710\u22129 for G+0.693-0.027.

            "heading": "5.2 Evolution of dense cores",
            "text": "In order to study the variations of temperatures and molecular abundance with the evolutionary sequence of the dense cores, the stage of each core need to be evaluated. According to the detected molecular species, molecular abundance, and line kinematic properties (e.g., outflow) of each core, the stage of the cores are classified as listed in Table 6. The general criteria for determining the relative evolutionary stage of the cores are summarized as follows.\nStarless core/prestellar core should not drive an outflow. Spectra of this kind of core appears line-poor. MM3 and MM9 were not observed by centimeter continuum (Testi et al. 2000) and do not have outflow activities. They also do not excite abundant molecular lines (see Figure C1). Those lines (e.g., CS, SO, 34SO, H2CO, CH3OH v=0, HC3N v=0, etc.) detected in MM3 and MM9 are probably remnant emission from MM4 and MM11, respectively. MM3 and MM9 are considered as massive starless core candidates.\nMM6 is more evolved, in which a collimated outflow is seen through CS (2\u20131), SO (32\u201321) and SiO (2\u20131) (see Figure 7 and Figure 9) emission. SiO (5\u20134) emission with ALMA 1.3 mm data presented by Liu et al. (2017) also showed this bar-like structure associated with MM6, which is very collimated and dominated by blueshifted emission. A small population of molecules such as CH3OH are excited in this stage.\nMM7, MM8, and MM4 may evolved into HMC phase. HMCs should have outflows, but this kind of outflows are not as highly collimated as from HMPOs. The significant feature of HMCs is that rich complex organic molecules and even in vibrationally and torsionally excited states (e.g., HC3N v7=1, HC3N v6=1, CH3OH vt=1, and CH3OCHO vt=1) exist in this phase. The vibrationally and torsionally excited states of molecules have higher upper energy levels and should be excited at a higher kinetic temperature. It suggests that molecules with higher Eu are good indicators for a more evolved region (Gieser et al. 2021). CH3OCHO vt=1 is not detected toward MM7, suggesting MM7 is less evolved than MM8 and MM4. For MM8 and MM4, we note that CH3OH v=0 with 889 K and CH3OH vt=1 with 771 K are excited at MM4 but absent at MM8. Gas emission of outflow tracers (CS, SO, and SiO, see Figure 7 and 9), along with the spectra of HCO+, SiO, and CS lines (Figure 10) which show broader wing structure in the MM8 compared to MM4. All tracers do not show any signature of molecular outflows in MM4. So maybe MM4 is older than MM8.\nH40\u03b1 recombination line toward MM1 and MM11 indicating that they evolved into an H/UC Hii stage. In this phase, molecules are hard to be detected since they are destroyed by UV radiation. Meanwhile hydrogen recombination lines emerge. MM1 is line-poor with only a few simple molecules like CS, SO, and HC3N v=0 detected and is not associated with outflows. However, ionized gas tracer H40\u03b1 is observed in this core. MM1 lies \u223c0.8\u2032\u2032 to the south-east of the Hii region C, it is likely that H40\u03b1 line is from the envelope of the Hii region C. A few COMs emission still exist in the MM11 region, meanwhile H40\u03b1 and H50\u03b2 lines are excited.\nIn spite of different phases presenting different physical conditions, it should be noted that during the star-forming process, different evolutionary stages show a vague boundary, and they are not fully separable.\nFigure 11 shows that the rotational temperatures Trot and molecular abundances (CH3OH, CH3OCHO, C2H5OH, C2H5CN, CH2CO, CH3OCH3, CH3COCH3, and CH3SH) vary with evolutionary stage. This figure only present those parameters that have been derived via LTE fitting to uncontaminated molecules. The mean values of the two parameters are: Trot = 99\u00b128 K, \u03c7= (3.0\u00b11.2)\u00d710\u22128 for\nMM7, Trot = 134\u00b127 K, \u03c7= (1.0\u00b10.2)\u00d710\u22127 for MM8, Trot = 137\u00b121 K, \u03c7= (6.9\u00b11.7)\u00d710\u22127 for MM4, and Trot = 100\u00b118 K, \u03c7= (7.4\u00b12.6)\u00d710\u22128 for MM11. The data points of molecules (e.g., CH3CHO and CH3OCH3 in MM7) for which column density is derived under the fixed rotational temperature are excluded from the figure. The molecular excitation temperature was adopted to be the gas temperature for each core. Among the four regions, the temperature of MM8/hot-core is similar to MM4/evolved-hot-core, which is higher than those of MM7/early-hot-core and MM11/UC Hii. MM7 should not have a comparatively hotter environment because it has not evolved into typical hot core phase. Methanol in torsional state was observed toward MM4 containing three transition lines with Eu up to 340\u2212902 K, which trace very hot and dense region. So the highest temperature appears toward the MM4. MM11/UC H Hii is slightly colder than MM8 and MM4, which is due to the colder and outer part of the gas components traced by CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3 and H2CCO. From the Figure 11 and Table 2, one can see that MM4/evolved-hot-core has higher abundances of O-bearing species than other regions, while the highest abundance of C2H5CN is seen in MM8. Methanol in ground and torsional states has high abundance \u223c 2.5\u00d710\u22126, making the mean value of abundance of MM4 to be seven times higher than those of MM8. In brief, molecular abundance increases with increasing age, except in the last phase MM11 which shows a decrease in abundance probably due to the destruction of molecules by the UV radiation. The molecular abundances increasing with evolution were also found by Gerner et al. (2014) and Coletta et al. (2020)."

            "text": "Chemical differentiation between N-bearing and O-bearing species was found both in high-mass star-forming regions such as Orion KL (Friedel & Snyder 2008; Wang et al. 2009; Crockett et al. 2015), W3(OH) (Wyrowski et al. 1999; Qin et al. 2015), W75N (Remijan et al. 2004b), and G19.61-0.23 (Qin et al. 2010), and in lowmass star-forming regions such as IRAS 16293\u22122422 (Kuan et al. 2004). These results imply that N-bearing and O-bearing molecules mainly exist in different environments. Our spectral line survey further revealed that the chemical difference between N-bearing and O-bearing molecules also exists in G9.62+0.19. While O-bearing molecules such as CH3OH, CH3OCHO, C2H5OH, and CH3OCH3 mostly associated with MM4 (see Figure 5), the strongest emission peaks of N-bearing species C2H5CN and HC3N are located toward the MM8 (see Figure 6). The derived abundances shows that MM4 is an O-rich source, while MM8 is rich in N-bearing species. This result is consistent with the previous interferometric observations that C2H5CN emission is the strongest toward the region F (MM8) whereas CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 are the brightest toward the region E (MM4) (Su et al. 2005).\nThe N- and O-bearing difference may arise because of different physical properties (initial temperature) during the gravitational collapse phase (Caselli et al. 1993; Yamamoto 2017). As predicted by chemical models, the relatively low initial temperature (lower than 20 K) at molecular accretion phase could keep CO for a long duration on the grain surface and thus may produce O-bearing molecules by the hydrogenation of CO. In contrast, if the temperature at this phase is as high as 40 K (Caselli et al. 1993), grain surface CO could be easily desorbed to the gas phase, leading to the formation of more N-bearing COMs compared to the O-bearing species.

This hinders the formation of O-bearing species. In contrast, atoms C and N easily migrate on dust grain surface, forming CnN and thus initiate the N-bearing COM chemistry. A consistent findings from recent work (Wang et al., in preparation) also presented that the initial temperature of 15 K and 23 K at collapse phase can produce abundant O-bearing and N-bearing species, respectively. Considering that the MM8 region could be externally heated at the gravitationally collapse phase due to its proximity to H II \"B\", its initial temperature at accretion phase is likely to be higher than that of\nMM4. The N/O variation seen in MM8 and MM4 is very likely to be caused by the different initial environments of these two cores."

COMs with formula C2HnO (n=2, 4 and 6) are also chemical links through hydrogenation reaction on interstellar grains: H2CCO 2H\u2212\u2192CH3CHO\n2H\u2212\u2192C2H5OH (Charnley & Rodgers 2005). In our work, C2HnO family such as H2CCO, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, and CH3OCH3, C2HnO2 family like CH3OCHO, and CH3OH which is\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)\nATOMS X 17\nconsidered as the precursor of some larger O-bearing COMs (e.g., C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO) (Blake et al. 1987; \u00d6berg et al. 2009; Maity et al. 2015; Bergantini, Maksyutenko & Kaiser. 2017) are simultaneously detected. In order to explore possible chemical links among O-bearing molecules, we compare the column density of several molecules (see Figure 12), as the formation process of COMs can be tested by investigating how their abundances/column densities are related.\nMoreover, comparisons of the very limited sample can not testify the potential chemical link among species well. We included more observing results from HMSFRs, to LMSFRs and GCMCs as listed in Table 5. Since column densities of these O-bearing COMs have been derived from various observational equipments with different spatial resolution and spectral setup, comparison of column density is not very helpful to derive sound conclusions for chemical links among O-bearing COMs. It is more reliable to compare the abundance of COMs relative to CH3OH. The column density ratios between O-bearing species and CH3OH from other types of sources in Table 5 are plotted in Figure 13. By the analyses of the molecular relationship in our four dense cores (see Figure 12), together with molecules from literature (see Figure 13), the main points for possible chemical correlations between specific molecules are discussed as follows:\n(1) CH3OH/C2H5OH, CH3OH/CH3OCH3: The preliminary results from Figure 12 reveal that there is a tight positive correlation between CH3OH and C2H5OH, and also the positive correlation between CH3OH and CH3OCH3, is suggestive of similar formation route for both the species. Here, the synthesis of C2H6O isomers ethanol (C2H5OH) and dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) has great potential via radical-radical recombination that the hydroxymethyl radical (CH2OH) and methoxy radical (CH3O) react with methyl radical (CH3) (Maity et al. 2015).\nCH3 + CH2OH \u2212\u2192 C2H5OH (grain surface) (4)\nCH3 + CH3O \u2212\u2192 CH3OCH3 (grain surface) (5)\nThe productions of hydroxymethyl radical (CH2OH) and methoxy radical (CH3O) through unimolecular decomposition of methanol have been identified in Bennett & Kaiser (2007); Bennett et al. (2007). Then the main path to produce the radical CH3O and CH2OH would likely be the photodissociation process as follows:\nCH3OH + h\u03bd \u2212\u2192 CH2OH + H (grain surface) (6)\nCH3OH + h\u03bd \u2212\u2192 CH3O + H (grain surface) (7)\nThe spatial distributions of CH3OH, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH that are mainly shown toward the MM4, MM7, MM8, and MM11, suggest that C2H5OH and CH3OCH3 might have a common precursor, CH3OH. Correlation coefficient of 0.89 for CH3OH/CH3OCH3 toward G10.6-0.4 (Law et al. 2021) and 0.86 for CH3OH/CH3OCH3 and CH3OH/C2H5OH toward seven high-mass hot cores (Bisschop et al. 2007) also support that C2H5OH and CH3OCH3 are tightly correlated with CH3OH.\n(2) CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3: Column densities between CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3, from each type of core, are also correlated (see Figure 12). Moreover, abundances of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 relative to CH3OH (see Figure 13) from three kinds of objects present the positive correlation. The tight correlation of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 was presented from Bisschop et al. (2007); Brouillet et al. (2013); Coletta et al. (2020) as well. The molecular abundance ratio between CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 is found to be \u223c1 in different type of source including high-mass star-forming regions (e.g., Bisschop et al. 2007; Brouillet et al. 2013; Rivilla et al. 2017b; Law et al. 2021), intermediate-mass starforming regions (Ospina-Zamudio et al. 2018), hot corinos (Taquet et al. 2015), Galactic centre clouds (Requena-Torres et al. 2006) and protostellar shock region (Lefloch et al. 2017). However, the ratio is reported to be \u223c2 for prestellar cores (Jim\u00e9nez-Serra et al. 2016) and Comets (Biver & Bockel\u00e9e-Morvan 2019). In our work, ratios are estimated to be 0.6\u00b10.3, 1.3\u00b10.1, 2.0\u00b10.3, and 1.1\u00b10.5 toward the MM7, MM8, MM4, and MM11, respectively. In addition, our 3 mm observations showed that CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 have similar gas distributions. These observation results may imply a potential link between these two species, which shares common precursor methoxy radical (CH3O) through reactions (8) and (9) (Garrod & Herbst. 2006; Garrod et al. 2008; \u00d6berg et al. 2010), protonated methanol CH3OH+2 with reactions (10) and (11) (Blake et al. 1987), or production of CH3OCHO from CH3OCH3 via the sequence (12) (Balucani et al. 2015):\nCH3O + HCO \u2212\u2192 CH3OCHO (grain surface) (8)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)\n18 Y.

The gas distribution of CH3CHO extend to east, which shows that the emission of CH3CHO is not very similar to H2CCO and C2H5OH. These results challenge the prediction that COMs in the formula of C2HnO have chemical correlation. Figure 13 shows a positive correlations between N(H2CCO)/N(CH3OH) and N(C2H5OH)/N(CH3OH), and weak correlation between N(H2CCO)/N(CH3OH) and N(CH3OCH3)/N(CH3OH). The chem-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201340 (2022)\nATOMS X 19\nical links among molecules in C2HnO formula cannot be determined at the moment.\n(4) CH3OCHO and CH3CHO: Although Figure 12 and Figure 13 showed another possible chemical link between CH3OCHO and CH3CHO, gas distributions of CH3OCHO are considerably different from those of CH3CHO. The chemical correlation between them should be further investigated.\nTo better characterize the chemical properties, more samples in various astrochemical environments and future chemical models are needed. In the near future, we are on track to study the chemistry of the COMs by considering more sources observed in the ATOMS project. In addition, these sources belong to different evolutionary stages so that we can draw a general picture on the properties of the COMs revealed from these sources. This will help us to set strong constraints on the chemical networks."

Earlier, longer chain cyanopolyynes HC2n+1N (n>2) have been thought to be detected in the early stage of star formation and absent in protostellar cores (e.g., Suzuki et al. 1992; Hirota et al. 2009). Recent observations found that longer cyanopolyynes have been detected in hot cores (e.g., Belloche et al. 2013; Esplugues et al. 2013; Green et al. 2014; Taniguchi et al. 2017, 2018). Previous papers proposed that cyanopolyynes are efficiently formed via the neutral\u2013neutral reaction \"C2nH2 + CN \u2212\u2192 HC2n+1N + H\" in the warm region (e.g., Chapman et al. 2009; Taniguchi et al. 2019). HC5N also can be formed via the reaction \"CCH + HC3N \u2212\u2192 HC5N + H\" in the gas phase (Taniguchi et al. 2019). At low temperature, the route \"N + Cn+1H \u2212\u2192 HCnN + C\", where n = 3, 5, 7, is thought to significantly contribute to the formation of cyanopolyynes. Recently, it has been suggested that HC5N/HC3N abundance ratios in the cold objects are higher than those in massive hot cores (Jaber et al. 2017). So, there exists contradiction between HC5N and HC3N in production rates. The formation mechanism of cyanopolyynes is not fully understood by now.\nIn our work, Figure 6 shows the integrated intensity maps of HC3N v=0, and its isotopes, and HC3N in vibrationally excited state v7=1 all peak at the position of the continuum peak. However, the distribution of HC5N has its own unique characteristics which differ from the distributions of HC3N. Therefore, it seems that HC5N is not generated from HC3N. Fontani et al. (2017) studied the intermediate mass protocluster OMC-2 FIR4, and found that the spatial distribution of HC3N is not coincident with that of HC5N, namely that HC3N emission is associated with the continuum peak FIR4, HC5N distributes over the eastern part of the continuum peak. They proposed that enhanced cosmic-ray ionisation rate will promote the production of HC5N. For HC5N in G9.62+0.19, the line intensity ratio between MM3 and MM4 is about 1.3, while for HC3N the ratio is around 0.5. Additionally, MM3 and MM4 are supposed to be at starless core and evolved HMCs stage, respectively. This imply that the synthesis of HC5N is different from HC3N in the early stage. The neutral\u2013neutral reaction between C4H2 and CN may not be the formation pathway of HC5N in G9.62+0.19, which support the idea that formation mechanisms of HC3N and HC5N may differ in various interstellar environments (Taniguchi et al. 2019).\nIn addition, the distribution of C2H5CN (see Figure 6) is almost identical to that of HC3N, predicting that C2H5CN is correlated with HC3N in formation mechanism (e.g., hydrogenation of HC3N on grain surface to form C2H5CN)."

MM11 shows a combination of HMCs and UC Hii region, as it has the detection of COMs (such as CH3CHO, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3, and C2H5OH), and hydrogen recombination lines such as H40\u03b1 and H50\u03b2. In short, their evolutionary sequence is MM6\u2192MM7\u2192MM8\u2192MM4\u2192MM11\u2192MM1.\n2. Modeling of the detected spectral lines, we have derived rotational temperatures from 72 to 115 K toward MM7, 100 to 163 K toward MM8, 102 to 204 K toward MM4, and 84 to 123 K toward MM11. Molecular column densities are on the orders of 1015 \u2212 1016 cm\u22122 toward MM7, MM8, and MM11, 1015 \u2212 1017 cm\u22122 toward MM4.\n3. The emission of N-bearing and S-bearing molecules is strongest toward MM8, while emission of O-bearings is dominated by core MM4. Besides, the largest abundances of N-bearing and Obearing molecules appear in MM8 and MM4, respectively. These all indicate clear chemical differentiation of N/O between MM8 and MM4. Such chemical differentiation might be affected by different initial temperature toward the MM8 and MM4 at their accretion phase.\n4. We found tight correlations between the column density of molecular pairs CH3OH/C2H5OH, CH3OH/CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO/CH3OCH3. Furthermore, the similar spatial distribution between them is seen, indicating that each pair is likely chemically linked, and may share a common precursor. The gas distribution of CH3CHO is less correlated to H2CCO and C2H5OH. Their column density/abundance correlations are not very clear. It seems likely that the chemical link of O-bearing COMs in the formula C2HnO is uncertain at present work.\n5. The comparison of HC3N and HC5N suggests that they trace different gas structures, and the formation mechanisms of HC3N and HC5N may differ in hot and cold regions."

The combination data from interferometric and single-dish observations sample small-scale components and extended structures simultaneously. In this work, the spectra we used is from 12-m observations alone. We claim that this is safe for our data modeling, because the dense cores of G9.62+0.19 are very compact (see Table 1). The information from these cores are not lost. Figure A1 compare the spectrum of MM8 from 12-m with 12-m + ACA combined data. It exhibited that 2\u2032\u2032-averaged spectrum from two observations are very similar in line intensity and line profile (see panel (a) and (b) in Figure A1). Spectrum extracted from 10\u2032\u2032area showed that strong lines such as CS and HC3N appeared minor difference in line intensity(see panel (c) and (d)). This implies that the structures smaller than 10\u2032\u2032are almost unaffected by missing flux, while larger scale structures may be affected. Therefore, 12-m array and combined data have no difference when using them to study the hot core chemistry, but 12-m array data have higher angular resolution for better investigating the compact cores."
