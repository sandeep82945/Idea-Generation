    "abstractText": "We give a geometric account of the relative motion or the shape dynamics of N point vortices on the sphere exploiting the SO(3)-symmetry of the system. The main idea is to bypass the technical difficulty of the SO(3)-reduction by first lifting the dynamics from S to C. We then perform the U(2)-reduction using a dual pair to obtain a Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics for the shape dynamics. This Lie\u2013Poisson structure helps us find a family of Casimirs for the shape dynamics. We further reduce the system by TN\u22121-symmetry to obtain a Poisson structure for the shape dynamics involving fewer shape variables than those of the previous work by Borisov and Pavlov. As an application of the shape dynamics, we prove that the tetrahedron relative equilibria are stable when all of their circulations have the same sign, generalizing some existing results on tetrahedron relative equilibria of identical vortices.",

The main idea is to bypass the technical difficulty of the SO(3)-reduction by first lifting the dynamics from S2 to C2. We then perform the U(2)-reduction using a dual pair to obtain a Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics for the shape dynamics. This Lie\u2013Poisson structure helps us find a family of Casimirs for the shape dynamics. We further reduce the system by TN\u22121-symmetry to obtain a Poisson structure for the shape dynamics involving fewer shape variables than those of the previous work by Borisov and Pavlov. As an application of the shape dynamics, we prove that the tetrahedron relative equilibria are stable when all of their circulations have the same sign, generalizing some existing results on tetrahedron relative equilibria of identical vortices.\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Dynamics of Point Vortices on Sphere. Consider N point vortices on the two-sphere S2R \u2282 R3 with (fixed) radius R > 0 centered at the origin. Let {xi \u2208 S2R}Ni=1 be the positions of the point vortices with circulations {\u0393i}Ni=1. Then the equations of motion of the point vortices are\nx\u0307i = 1\n2\u03c0R \u2211 1\u2264j\u2264N j 6=i \u0393j xj \u00d7 xi |xi \u2212 xj |2\n(1)\nfor i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}; see, e.g., Bogomolov [3], Kimura and Okamoto [17], and Newton [34, Chapter 4]. This system of equations is Hamiltonian in the following sense: Let \u2126i be the area form of the i-th copy of S2R and define the following two-form on (S2R)N :\n\u2126S2R := N\u2211 i=1 \u0393i\u03c0 \u2217 i \u2126i with \u2126i(xi)(vi,wi) := 1 R xi \u00b7 (vi \u00d7wi) (2)\nwhere \u03c0i : (S2R)N \u2192 S2R is the projection to the i-th copy. The corresponding Poisson bracket on (R3)N (see Appendix B for details) is, for all smooth F,H : (R3)N \u2192 R,\n{F,H}R3 (x) := N\u2211 i=1 R \u0393i xi \u00b7 ( \u2202F \u2202xi \u00d7 \u2202H \u2202xi ) . (3)\nDefine the Hamiltonians on (S2R)N and (R3)N as follows:\nHS2R (x1, . . . ,xN ) := \u2212\n1\n4\u03c0R2 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264N \u0393i\u0393j ln ( 2(R2 \u2212 xi \u00b7 xj) ) , (4a)\nDate: March 24, 2023. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 37J37,53D20,70G65,76B47.

(4b)\nNote that the former is the restriction of the latter to (S2R)N . Then we obtain (1) as a Hamiltonian system on (S2R)N or (R3)N as follows:\niX\u2126S2R = dHS2R\nor x\u0307i = {xi, HR3} , (5)\nwhere X is a vector field on (S2R)N .\nRemark 1.1. The Hamiltonians (4) have singularities at the collision points, i.e., xi = xj with i 6= j. Following Kirwan [19, Remark 1.1], we will ignore this issue for now because the concrete expression for the Hamiltonian does not affect the geometry of our problem as long as it possesses the SO(3)-symmetry described below. Once we obtain the Hamiltonian for the shape dynamics, we may remove the singularities by imposing conditions on the corresponding variables accordingly. Alternatively, one may also introduce a regularization parameter to remove the singularities from the outset; see, e.g., Vankerschaver and Leok [48].\nThe dynamics of point vortices on the sphere has been studied quite extensively because it is not only interesting mathematically but also has geophysical and astrophysical applications. For example, Dibattista and Polvani [7] and Kimura [16] studied the motion of a vortex pair (N = 2), and Kidambi and Newton [15] solved the equations of relative motion (see (6) below) for N = 3. Borisov and Lebedev [5] and Sakajo [41] studied the integrable three-vortex motions on the sphere; see also Sakajo [42] for an integrable four-vortex motion on sphere with zero moment of vorticity, and Sakajo and Yagasaki [43, 44] for studies on chaotic motions of N point vortices on the sphere.\nOne can also generalize the basic equations (1) to those vortices on a rotating sphere, and their dynamics has been studied in, e.g., Jamaloodeen and Newton [14], Newton and Sakajo [35], Newton and Shokraneh [36] and Laurent-Polz [23].\nStability of fixed and relative equilibria of point vortices on the sphere is one of the major topics of research as well. The linear stability of rings of identical vortices was studied by Polvani and Dritschel [40], and its nonlinear stability by Boatto and Cabral [2] (see also Laurent-Polz et al. [24]). Lim et al. [26] proved the existence of a number of relative equilibria of identical vortices, and Laurent-Polz et al. [24] studied nonlinear stability of many different types of relative equilibria involving one or two ring of vortices\u2014each consisting of identical vortices\u2014with and without one or two polar vortices; see also Laurent-Polz [22] and Boatto and Simo\u0301 [1]. See also [9] for the existence of periodic orbits of N identical vortices and small nonlinear oscillations near the Platonic solid equilibria, and also Montaldi and Tokieda [32] for the bifurcation of the heptagon equilibrium with the Gaussian curvature being the parameter.\n1.2. Relative Motion and Shape Dynamics. The focus of this paper is the relative motion or the shape dynamics of the point vortices, i.e., we are interested in the set of equations that governs the evolution of the \u201cshape\u201d or relative positions of the point vortices\u2014regardless of where the vortices are located on the sphere. For example, for N = 3, it is the dynamics of the shape of the triangle formed by the three point vortices, regardless of its position and orientation on the sphere.\nDefining the inter-vortex (Euclidean) distance\n`ij := |xi \u2212 xj |\n3 for i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N} with i 6= j and the (signed) volume\nVijk := xi \u00b7 (xj \u00d7 xk)\nof the parallelepiped formed by vectors xi,xj ,xk for i, j, k \u2208 {1, . . . , N} with i 6= j 6= k, we can derive the equations of relative motion\nd dt `2ij = 1 \u03c0R N\u2211 1\u2264k\u2264N k 6=i 6=j \u0393kVijk\n( 1\n`2jk \u2212 1 `2ki\n) (6)\nfrom (1); see, e.g., Newton [34, Section 4.2].\n1.3. Hamiltonian Formulation of Shape Dynamics. Given that the original equation (1) is a Hamiltonian system, a natural question to ask is whether the equations (6) of relative motion or shape dynamics are also a Hamiltonian system. In fact, Borisov and Pavlov [6] derived the Poisson bracket for the above \u201cinternal\u201d variables {`ij}1\u2264i<j\u2264N \u222a{Vijk}1\u2264i<j<k\u2264N in a direct manner from the Poisson bracket (3) for the original dynamics (1).\nA more geometric perspective of this question is the following: Intuitively, it is clear that the dynamics of N point vortices governed by (1) would have SO(3)-symmetry under the rotational action SO(3)\u00d7 (S2R)N \u2192 (S2R)N ; (A, (x1, . . . ,xN )) 7\u2192 (Ax1, . . . , AxN ). This action is clearly symplectic with respect to the symplectic form (2) because the volume form of each sphere is invariant under the rotational action. One also sees that the Hamiltonian (4a) is SO(3)-invariant as well. Taking the quotient by SO(3), we identify all the configurations of the vortices that are congruent to each other as a single \u201cshape\u201d. So if we could perform the symplectic reduction (see Marsden and Weinstein [29] and [30, Sections 1.1 and 1.2]) of (1) by the SO(3)-symmetry, then the resulting reduced dynamics would be essentially the equations (6) of relative motion. Such a geometric picture of shape dynamics has been also applied to the N -body problem of classical mechanics (see, e.g., Iwai [13], Montgomery [33], and references therein) and also point vortices on the plane; see, e.g., Koiller et al. [20], [4], and [37].\nUnfortunately, the reduction by SO(3)-symmetry is quite intricate. The momentum map asso-\nciated with the above SO(3)-action gives the following well-known invariant:\nI : (S2R)N \u2192 so(3)\u2217 \u223c= R3; I(x1, . . . ,xN ) := 1\nR N\u2211 i=1 \u0393ixi.\nThe difficulty is that the reduced space or the Marsden\u2013Weinstein quotient I\u22121(c)/SO(3)c with c \u2208 R3 is tricky to work with when describing the reduced dynamics, where SO(3)c stands for the isotropy group {A \u2208 SO(3) | Ac = c}. While Kirwan [19] found some topological invariants of the reduced space, the focus was rather on the topology of the space than the dynamics. Indeed, it is difficult to find coordinates for the reduced space in general, and concrete treatments of the reduced dynamics are limited to some special cases; see Pekarsky and Marsden [39] for the corresponding Poisson reduction in the special case with N = 3 and Lim [27] for an explicit treatment of the reduction for N = 4.\n1.4. Main Results and Outline. Our main contribution is the geometric treatment of the shape dynamics exploiting the SO(3)-symmetry mentioned above. Specifically, we proceed as follows to sidestep the difficulty of the SO(3)-reduction; see also Figure 1."

            "text": "1. We first lift the dynamics of vortices from S2R to C2 in Section 2. For N vortices, the lifted dynamics is then in (C2)N , which is identified with the space C2\u00d7N of 2\u00d7N complex matrices. The lifted dynamics possesses a TN := S1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S1 (N copies)-symmetry, and the symplectic reduction by the symmetry recovers the vortex dynamics on the sphere; see Proposition 2.1.\n2. In Section 3, we perform a U(2)-reduction of the lifted dynamics using a dual pair of Skerritt\nand Vizman [46] defined on C2\u00d7N . This essentially corresponds to the SO(3)-reduction of the original dynamics because its SU(2) subgroup symmetry gives the SO(3)-symmetry of the original dynamics on the sphere. The use of the dual pair facilitates the reduction, because the dual pair essentially allows one to embed the reduced space to the dual of a Lie algebra, yielding a Lie\u2013Poisson equation for the reduced dynamics; see, e.g., Weinstein [49], Libermann and Marle [25, Section IV.7], and Ortega and Ratiu [38, Chapter 11]. In other words, instead of having the reduced dynamics in a complicated quotient manifold, the reduced dynamics is given by an ODE on a vector space. It also helps us find a family of Casimirs associated with the Lie\u2013Poisson structure; see Proposition 3.6. 3. In Section 4, we further reduce the Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics using the TN\u22121-symmetry to get rid of the extra symmetry picked up by the lifting1. The resulting Poisson structure gives a\nThis geometric treatment results in fewer variables for the shape dynamics compared to those \u201cinternal\u201d variables of Borisov and Pavlov [6]. In fact, our shape dynamics is described using (N \u2212 1)2 variables, but it turns out that (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2)/2 of those implicitly depend on the rest; hence N(N \u2212 1)/2 variables essentially. On the other hand, the number of the \u201cinternal\u201d variables of [6] is N(N2 \u2212 1)/6.\nAnother advantage of our formulation is that we can find a family of Casimirs exploiting the underlying algebraic structure of the Lie\u2013Poisson bracket on O. This is not easy with the Poisson bracket of [6] because they obtained it \u201cby hand\u201d, i.e., the algebraic structure of their Poisson bracket is not clear.\n1The reason why we have TN\u22121-symmetry as opposed to TN is that one copy of S1 is taken care of in the U(2)-reduction in the previous step.\n5 Note that our parametrization does not in general give actual coordinate charts for the shape space. Indeed, since the original dynamics is 2N -dimensional, the shape space after the SO(3)reduction would not have dimensions such as (N\u22121)2. Instead, we sidestep the difficulty of directly dealing with the shape space by describing the shape dynamics using the (N \u2212 1)2 coordinates for the ambient space for the shape space. The reason for the increase in the number of variables is that the U(2)-reduced dynamics in the coadjoint orbit O (see Figure 1) is described in terms of the coordinates for u(D\u0393) \u2217; note that this is generally the case with Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics.\nAlthough this redundancy of shape variables is certainly a drawback, the resulting shape dynamics provides a means to analyze the stability of relative equilibria (i.e., the stability of the shape formed by the vortices). To demonstrate this idea, we apply the energy\u2013Casimir method to our shape dynamics with N = 4 and find a sufficient condition for the stability of tetrahedron relative equilibria in Section 5. Our result concerns the non-identical case, i.e., \u03931 6= \u03932 6= \u03933 6= \u03934, and generalizes those results of Kurakin [21] and Meleshko et al. [31] for the identical case with \u03931 = \u03932 = \u03933 = \u03934. We also mention in passing that Pekarsky and Marsden [39] used the energy\u2013 momentum method to find a sufficient condition for stability of non-identical equilateral triangle relative equilibria, i.e., N = 3 with \u03931 6= \u03932 6= \u03933. So our result is also an extension of theirs to N = 4 as well.\n2. Lifted Vortex Dynamics in C2\nWe would like to first lift the vortex dynamics from S2R to C2. This idea is inspired by Vankerschaver and Leok [48], where they lift the dynamics from S2R to S3\u221aR via the Hopf fibration S3\u221a\nR \u2192 S2R. We shall show that our approach naturally gives rise to the Hopf fibration by identifying\nthe reduced space S2R = S3\u221aR/S 1 as a Marsden\u2013Weinstein quotient.\n2.1. Vortex Equations in C2. Let us show how the lifting from Figure 1 works. Since the Hopf fibration map gives rise to a map from C2 to R3, one may relate the distance in C2 with that in R3 as shown in (D.2) of Appendix D.2. Replacing the inter-vortex distance in R3 in the Hamiltonian (4b) by the corresponding distance in C2 using (D.2), we define a Hamiltonian H : (C2)N \u2192 R as\nH(\u03d5) := \u2212 1 4\u03c0R2 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264N \u0393i\u0393j ln [( \u2016\u03d5i\u20162 + \u2016\u03d5j\u20162 )2 \u2212 4|\u03d5\u2217i\u03d5j |2 ] , (7)\nwhere we used the shorthand\n\u03d5 = (\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5N ) \u2208 (C2)N ,\nand defined the norm \u2016\u03d5\u2016 := \u221a \u03d5\u2217\u03d5 induced by the natural inner product on C2. We also write\n\u03d5i = [ zi ui ] with zi, ui \u2208 C \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}.\nWe define a symplectic form \u2126 on (C2)N as follows:\n\u2126 := \u2212 2 R N\u2211 i=1 \u0393i Im(d\u03d5 \u2217 i \u2227 d\u03d5i) ,\nor \u2126 = \u2212d\u0398 with\n\u0398 := \u2212 2 R N\u2211 i=1 \u0393i Im(\u03d5 \u2217 id\u03d5i) .

S1-Reduction. Now let us explain the TN -reduction part from Figure 1. Since the Hamiltonian (7) is invariant under the above TN -action, its associated momentum map J is an invariant of (9). Therefore, setting \u0393 := (\u03931, . . . ,\u0393N ) \u2208 RN , the level set\nJ\u22121(\u22122\u0393) = S3\u221a R \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S3\u221a R = ( S3\u221a R )N is an invariant manifold of the dynamics. In fact, one can show the following:\nProposition 2.1. The symplectic reduction of (C2)N by the above TN -symmetry yields the Marsden\u2013 Weinstein quotient\nJ\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/TN = ( S3\u221a R /S1 ) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 ( S3\u221a R /S1 ) = ( S2R )N .\nIn addition, the lifted dynamics (9) is reduced to the point vortex dynamics (1) on ( S2R )N .\nProof. See Appendix B.\n7 3. U(2)-Reduction of N-vortex Dynamics in C2\nThis section corresponds to the U(2)-reduction part in Figure 1. The lifted dynamics turns out to possess a U(2)-symmetry, and its SU(2) subgroup symmetry corresponds to the SO(3)-symmetry of the original system on S2R. The advantage of the lifted dynamics is that the corresponding U(2)-action on C2 is much more tractable compared to the SO(3)-action on S2R when it comes to the symplectic reduction. We exploit the dual pair of Skerritt and Vizman [46] to show that the U(2)-reduced dynamics is a Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics.\nThe upshot of this section is that we have a pair of momentum maps on (C2)N \u223c= C2\u00d7N :\nu(2)\u2217 C2\u00d7N u(N)\u2217\u0393. K L\nWe shall explain the notation and the details along the way, but the dual pair implies that the reduction by U(2)-symmetry of the lifted dynamics (9) in C2\u00d7N yields a Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics in u(N)\u2217\u0393.\n3.1. U(2)-Symmetry of Lifted N-vortex Dynamics. Let us first identify (C2)N with the space of 2\u00d7N complex matrices as follows:\n(C2)N \u2192 C2\u00d7N ; \u03d5 = (\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5N ) 7\u2192 \u03a6 = [\u03d51 . . . \u03d5N ].\nThen we may rewrite the canonical one-form (8) as\n\u0398(\u03a6) = \u2212 2 R Im(tr(D\u0393\u03a6 \u2217d\u03a6)) , (10)\nwhere we defined\nD\u0393 := diag(\u03931, . . . ,\u0393N ) =  \u03931 0 0 0 \u03932\n0\n0 0 \u0393N . (11) Now consider the (left) U(2)-action on C2\u00d7N defined as\nU(2)\u00d7 C2\u00d7N \u2192 C2\u00d7N ; (Y,\u03a6) 7\u2192 Y \u03a6. (12)\nIt is clear that this action leaves \u0398 invariant, and hence is a canonical action with respect to the symplectic form \u2126 = \u2212d\u0398. It is also easy to see that the Hamiltonian (7) is invariant under the action as well; hence U(2) is a symmetry group of the lifted dynamics (9).\nRemark 3.1. As is well known, it is not the U(2)-action but the SU(2)-action on C2 that gives rise to the natural SO(3)-action on R3. So the above U(2)-symmetry does not exactly correspond to the rotational symmetry of the point vortices dynamics on S2R. In fact, the above U(2)-symmetry combines the global phase symmetry (see Remark 4.1 below) and the rotational symmetry of the system. We perform the U(2)-reduction here because the dual pair to be employed below is readily available with this setting, whereas it is unknown with SU(2).\nLemma 3.2. The momentum map K : C2\u00d7N \u2192 u(2)\u2217 associated with the above U(2)-action (12) is\nK(\u03a6) = \u2212 i R \u03a6D\u0393\u03a6 \u2217 = \u2212 i R N\u2211 i=1 \u0393i\u03d5i\u03d5 \u2217 i = \u2212 i R N\u2211 i=1 \u0393i [ |zi|2 ziu\u0304i z\u0304iui |ui|2 ] .

Lie Group U(D\u0393) and Lie Algebras u(D\u0393) and u(N)\u0393. Using D\u0393 defined in (11), let us also define a Lie group\nU(D\u0393) := { U \u2208 CN\u00d7N | UD\u0393U\u2217 = D\u0393 } ,\nand its (right) action on C2\u00d7N :\nU(D\u0393)\u00d7 C2\u00d7N \u2192 C2\u00d7N ; (U,\u03a6) 7\u2192 \u03a6U.\nAgain, it is clear that this action leaves \u0398 invariant as well; see (10).\nThe Lie algebra of U(D\u0393) is given by u(D\u0393) := { \u03b6\u0303 \u2208 CN\u00d7N | \u03b6\u0303D\u0393 +D\u0393\u03b6\u0303\u2217 = 0 } .\nThen we have the following vector space isomorphism between u(D\u0393) and the Lie algebra u(N) of the unitary group U(N):\nu(D\u0393)\u2192 u(N); \u03b6\u0303 7\u2192 \u03b6\u0303D\u0393 =: \u03b6.\nNote that this is not a Lie algebra isomorphism. However, we may equip u(N) with the modified Lie bracket\n[\u03be, \u03b7]\u0393 := \u03beD \u22121 \u0393 \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7D \u22121 \u0393 \u03be (15)\nto define a Lie algebra u(N)\u0393. Then the above vector space isomorphism becomes a Lie algebra isomorphism between u(D\u0393) (with the standard commutator) and u(N)\u0393 with the modified Lie bracket (15).\nLet us equip u(N)\u0393 with the inner product in the same form as in (14), and identify the dual u(N)\u2217\u0393 with u(N)\u0393 via this inner product; hence we may identify u(D\u0393) \u2217 with u(N)\u0393 as well. Under this identification, the adjoint and coadjoint representations of U(D\u0393) on u(N)\u0393 and u(N) \u2217 \u0393 are\nAdU \u03be = U\u03beU \u2217, Ad\u2217U \u03bb = U \u2217\u03bbU, (16)\n9 and also the corresponding u(D\u0393)-representations are\nad\u03be \u03b7 = [\u03be, \u03b7]\u0393, ad \u2217 \u03be \u03bb = \u03bb\u03beD \u22121 \u0393 \u2212D \u22121 \u0393 \u03be\u03bb (17)\nfor every U \u2208 U(D\u0393), \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 u(N)\u0393, and \u03bb \u2208 u(N)\u2217\u0393. Lemma 3.3. The momentum map L : C2\u00d7N \u2192 u(N)\u2217\u0393 associated with the above U(D\u0393)-action is\nL(\u03a6) = \u2212 i R \u03a6\u2217\u03a6 = \u2212 i R  \u2016\u03d51\u20162 \u03d5\u22171\u03d52 \u03d5\u22171\u03d5N \u03d5\u22172\u03d51 \u2016\u03d52\u2016 2\n\u03d5\u2217N\u22121\u03d5N \u03d5\u2217N\u03d51 \u03d5 \u2217 N\u03d5N\u22121 \u2016\u03d5N\u2016 2 . (18) Proof. The infinitesimal generator of an arbitrary element \u03b6\u0303 \u2208 u(D\u0393) is\n\u03b6\u0303C2\u00d7N (\u03a6) = \u03a6\u03b6\u0303 = \u03a6\u03b6D \u22121 \u0393 .\nHence the associated momentum map L : C2\u00d7N \u2192 u(N)\u2217\u0393 satisfies\n\u3008L(\u03a6), \u03b6\u3009 = \u0398(\u03a6) \u00b7 \u03b6\u0303C2\u00d7N (\u03a6)\n= \u2212 2 R\nIm ( tr ( D\u0393\u03a6 \u2217\u03a6\u03b6D\u22121\u0393 ))\n= \u2212 2 R Im(tr(\u03a6\u2217\u03a6\u03b6)) = 2\nR i tr(\u03a6\u2217\u03a6\u03b6)\n= 2\nR tr((\u2212i\u03a6\u2217\u03a6)\u2217\u03b6)\n= \u2329 \u2212 i R \u03a6\u2217\u03a6, \u03b6 \u232a ,\nwhere we used the fact that tr(\u03a6\u2217\u03a6\u03b6) is pure imaginary. Hence the expression (18) follows.\n3.3. U(2)-Reduction via a Dual Pair.\nProposition 3.4. The Hamiltonian reduction of the lifted dynamics (9) by the U(2)-symmetry yields the Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics\n\u03bb\u0307 = ad\u2217\u03b4h/\u03b4\u03bb \u03bb (19)\nin u(N)\u2217\u0393, where h : u(N) \u2217 \u0393 \u2192 R is defined as\nh(\u03bb) := \u2212 1 4\u03c0R2 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264N \u0393i\u0393j ln ( R2 ( 1 2 (\u03bbi + \u03bbj) 2 \u2212 |\u03bbij |2 )) . (20)\nProof. As alluded at the beginning of the section, the pair of momentum maps K and L form a dual pair in the sense of Weinstein [49]; see also [25, Section IV.7] and [38, Chapter 11]. Specifically, the above U(2)- and U(D\u0393)-actions along with the associated momentum maps K and L define so-called mutually transitive actions on C2\u00d7N (see Skerritt [45] and Skerritt and Vizman [46]) in the following sense: (i) The U(2)-action and the U(D\u0393)-action commute; (ii) they are symplectic actions; (iii) the momentum maps K and L are equivariant; (iv) each level set of K is a U(D\u0393)-orbit, and each level set of L is an U(2)-orbit. In fact, this is essentially a special case of Skerritt and Vizman [46, Section 3].\nThis implies the following (see, e.g., [46, Proposition 2.8]): For every \u03a60 \u2208 C2\u00d7N , let \u03ba0 := K(\u03a60) and \u03bb0 := L(\u03a60); then the Marsden\u2013Weinstein quotient K \u22121(\u03ba0)/U(2)\u03ba0 is symplectomorphic to"

(23)\nWe also define a collective Hamiltonian [11] h so that h \u25e6 L = H (see (7) for an expression of H). Then, the reduced dynamics in the the Marsden\u2013Weinstein quotient K\u22121(\u03ba0)/U(2)\u03ba0 is equivalent to the Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics (19) in u(N)\u2217\u0393.\n3.4. Lie\u2013Poisson Bracket on u(N)\u2217\u0393. One may also write the Lie\u2013Poisson equation (19) as\n\u03bb\u0307 = {\u03bb, h} ,\nwhere the Poisson bracket is the (\u2212)-Lie\u2013Poisson bracket on u(N)\u2217\u0393 corresponding to the above symplectic form (21), i.e.,\n{f, h} (\u03bb) := \u2212 \u2329 \u03bb, [ \u03b4f\n\u03b4\u03bb , \u03b4h \u03b4\u03bb ] \u0393 \u232a (24)\nfor all smooth f, h : u(N)\u2217\u0393 \u2192 R. In this subsection, we would like to find a concrete expression for the bracket.\nTo that end, let us first define an orthonormal basis for u(N)\u0393. Let ei \u2208 RN be the unit vector whose i-th component is 1, and define\nDi := \u2212 i\u221a 2 eie T i = \u2212 i\u221a 2 diag(ei) for i \u2208 {1, . . . , N},\nEij := \u2212 i\n2\n( eie T j + eje T i ) , Fij := 1\n2\n( eie T j \u2212 ejeTi ) for i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N}.\nNote that Eii = \u221a 2Di and Fii = 0 for i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}. One then sees that\n{Di}Ni=1 \u222a {Eij , Fij}1\u2264i<j\u2264N\n11\nforms a basis for u(N)\u0393. Hence we may write an arbitrary element \u03be \u2208 u(N)\u0393 as follows:\n\u03be = (\u03be1, . . . , \u03beN , \u03be12, . . . , \u03beN\u22121,N )\n= N\u2211 i=1 \u03beiDi + \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u2264N ((Re \u03beij)Eij + (Im \u03beij)Fij)\n= \u2212 i 2  \u221a 2\u03be1 \u03be12 \u03be1N \u03be\u030412 \u221a 2\u03be2\n\u03beN\u22121,N \u03be\u03041N \u03be\u0304N\u22121,N \u221a 2\u03beN . (25) So we may identify u(N)\u0393 with RN \u00d7 RN(N\u22121) = RN 2 as a vector space.\nIt is then straightforward calculations to see that the Lie bracket (15) on u(N)\u0393 satisfies the\nfollowing for all i, j, k, l \u2208 {1, . . . , N}:\n[Di, Ejk]\u0393 = \u2212 \u0393\u22121i\u221a\n2 (\u03b4ijFik + \u03b4ikFij), [Di,Fjk]\u0393 = \u0393\u22121i\u221a 2 (\u03b4ijEik \u2212 \u03b4ikEij),\n[Eij , Ekl]\u0393 = \u2212 1\n2\n( \u0393\u22121i (\u03b4ikFjl + \u03b4ilFjk) + \u0393 \u22121 j (\u03b4jkFil + \u03b4jlFik) ) ,\n[Fij ,Fkl]\u0393 = \u2212 1\n2\n( \u0393\u22121i (\u03b4ikFjl \u2212 \u03b4ilFjk)\u2212 \u0393 \u22121 j (\u03b4jkFil \u2212 \u03b4jlFik) ) ,\n[Eij ,Fkl]\u0393 = 1\n2\n( \u0393\u22121i (\u03b4ikEjl \u2212 \u03b4ilEjk) + \u0393 \u22121 j (\u03b4jkEil \u2212 \u03b4jlEik) ) ,\nwhere we did not assume Einstein\u2019s summation convention. Note that the first two are in fact special cases of the third and the last ones, respectively, because Di = Eii/ \u221a 2.\nUsing the coordinates for u(N)\u2217\u0393 \u223c= u(N)\u0393 with respect to the above basis, we may write an arbitrary element \u03bb \u2208 u(N)\u2217\u0393 using the coordinates (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbN , \u03bb12, . . . , \u03bbN\u22121,N ) just as we did in (25) for \u03be \u2208 u(N)\u0393. Then we may express the Lie\u2013Poisson bracket (24) as follows: For all i, j, k, l \u2208 {1, . . . , N},\n{\u03bbi, \u03bbj} = 0, {\u03bbi, \u03bbjk} = \u2212i \u0393\u22121i\u221a\n2 (\u03b4ij\u03bbik \u2212 \u03b4ik\u03bbji), {\u03bbij , \u03bbkl} = i ( \u0393\u22121i \u03b4il\u03bbkj \u2212 \u0393 \u22121 j \u03b4jk\u03bbil ) .\n(26)\nRemark 3.5. As one can see in (25), we do not use entries \u03bbij with i \u2265 j explicitly as coordinates in u(N)\u0393 or u(N) \u2217 \u0393, but such entries may appear in the above Poisson bracket formulas. However, one may define \u03bbij := \u3008\u03bb, Eij\u3009 + i\u3008\u03bb,Fij\u3009 even if i \u2265 j. Then it follows that \u03bbij = \u03bb\u0304ji if i > j as well as that \u03bbii = \u221a 2\u03bbi. So we may rewrite the above Poisson bracket formulas in terms of the coordinates for u(N)\u2217\u0393.\nThe above Lie\u2013Poisson bracket has the following family of Casimirs:\nProposition 3.6.\n(i) For every j \u2208 N, the function Cj : u(N)\u2217\u0393 \u2192 R defined by Cj(\u03bb) := tr ( (iD\u0393\u03bb) j )\nis a Casimir function for the Lie\u2013Poisson bracket (26).\n(ii) Those Casimirs Cj with j \u2265 N can be expressed in terms of {Cj}N\u22121j=1 ."

Why do we consider the TN\u22121-action instead of the more natural TN -action? It is because the above U(2)-symmetry took into account an S1-symmetry out of the TN -symmetry already. This is the \u201cglobal\u201d S1-phase symmetry alluded in Remark 3.1: A part of the TN -symmetry is the invariance under the S1-action that changes the phase of the entire system by the same amount \u03a6 7\u2192 ei\u03b8\u03a6, but this is an S1 subgroup action of (12). The above TN\u22121-action takes care of the rest of the TN -symmetry the lifted dynamics picked up.\nClearly the symplectic structure (21) and the collective Hamiltonian (20) are invariant under the above TN\u22121-action, and thus the U(2)-reduced dynamics (19) has the TN\u22121-symmetry.

Then we see that \u03c9u(N)\u2217\u0393(\u03bb) = ad \u2217 \u03b4N\u03c9/\u03b4\u03bb \u03bb with N \u03c9 : u(N)\u2217\u0393 \u2192 R defined by\nN \u03c9(\u03bb) = \u3008\u03bb,\u2212iD\u03c9\u0393\u3009 = \u22122i tr(\u03bb \u2217D\u03c9\u0393) = \u221a 2 N\u22121\u2211 i=1 \u0393i\u03bbi\u03c9i.\nThe associated momentum map N : u(N)\u2217\u0393 \u2192 (RN\u22121)\u2217 \u223c= RN\u22121 then satisfies N\u03c9(\u03bb) = N(\u03bb) \u00b7 \u03c9\u0393, and thus we obtain\nN(\u03bb) = \u221a\n2 (\u03931\u03bb1, . . . ,\u0393N\u22121\u03bbN\u22121).\nThese turn out to be trivial invariants in our setting because, in view of (23) and using \u03d5i \u2208 S3\u221aR, we have \u03bbi = \u221a 2 for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}.\nNote that the action (27) is not free. However, if we restrict the action to the open subset\nu\u030a(N)\u2217\u0393 := {\u03bb \u2208 u(N)\u2217\u0393 | \u03bbij 6= 0 for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N} with i 6= j } ,\nthen the action becomes free. Its geometric interpretation is the following: If, for example, \u03bb12 = 0 then \u03d5\u22171\u03d52 = 0, and this along with (D.3) implies |x1 \u2212 x2| = 2R, i.e., vortices 1 and 2 are in the antipodal points. In this case, there is no well-defined geodesic connecting the two vortices on the sphere, and hence the \u201cshape\u201d of the vortices on the sphere is not well-defined.\n4.2.

Let us define\n\u00b5ijk := \u03bbij\u03bbki\u03bbjk \u2208 C\u030a with C\u030a := C\\{0},\nand, also as a shorthand,\n\u00b5ij := \u00b5ijN = \u03bbij \u03bb\u0304iN\u03bbjN = \u03bbij\u03bbNi\u03bbjN \u2208 C\u030a (28)\nfor all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N \u2212 1} with i < j. These variables provide an alternative parametrization of the entries {\u03bbij}1\u2264i<j\u2264N\u22121 of \u03bb, i.e., those (N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2)/2 entries of \u03bb in (22) that are above the main diagonal except those in the last column.\nTherefore, we may parametrize \u03bb \u2208 u\u030a(N)\u2217\u0393 as follows:\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbN , \u03bb1N , . . . , \u03bbN\u22121,N , \u00b512, . . . , \u00b5N\u22122,N\u22121) \u2208 RN \u00d7 C\u030aN\u22121 \u00d7 C\u030a(N\u22121)(N\u22122)/2.\nThen the TN\u22121-action (27) becomes trivial on the variables {\u00b5ij}1\u2264i<j\u2264N\u22121, and hence we have u\u030a(N)\u2217\u0393/TN\u22121 = RN \u00d7 ( C\u030aN\u22121/TN\u22121 ) \u00d7 C\u030a(N\u22121)(N\u22122)/2\n= RN \u00d7 RN\u22121+ \u00d7 C\u030a(N\u22121)(N\u22122)/2 ={(\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbN , |\u03bb1N |, . . . , |\u03bbN\u22121,N |, \u00b512, . . . , \u00b5N\u22122,N\u22121)} ."

How do the variables for SN determine the \u201cshape\u201d formed by the vortices? In view of (D.3), (D.4), and (23), we may relate our variables with the inter-vortex distances `ij := |xi \u2212 xj | and the signed volume Vijk = xi \u00b7 (xj \u00d7 xk) as follows:\n`2ij = 4 ( R2 \u2212 |\u03d5\u2217i\u03d5j |2 ) = R2(4\u2212 |\u03bbij |2) \u21d0\u21d2 |\u03bbij |2 = 4\u2212 `2ij R2 ,\nVijk = 4 Im ( (\u03d5\u2217i\u03d5j)(\u03d5 \u2217 k\u03d5i)(\u03d5 \u2217 j\u03d5k) ) = R3\n2 Im\u00b5ijk \u21d0\u21d2 Im\u00b5ijk =\n2\nR3 Vijk.\n(31)\n15\nTherefore, |\u03bbik| and |\u03bbjk| specify the lengths `ik and `jk of two edges of the triangle formed by the vortices {i, j, k}, whereas Im\u00b5ijk specifies the angle between the edges, thereby determining the triangle formed by the vortices {i, j, k}. Note also that the above equations (31) give the relationship between our variables and the following \u201cinternal\u201d variables of [6]:\n{Mij := `2ij}1\u2264i<j\u2264N \u222a {\u2206ijk := Vijk}1\u2264i<j<k\u2264N .\nUsing the Lie\u2013Poisson bracket (26), we find the Poisson structure on the space of our shape\nvariables as follows: For 1 \u2264 i, j, k, l \u2264 N \u2212 1,{ |\u03bbij |2, |\u03bbkl|2 } = 2 (( \u03b4ik \u0393i \u2212 \u03b4jk \u0393j ) Im\u00b5ijl + ( \u03b4il \u0393i \u2212 \u03b4jl \u0393j ) Im\u00b5ijk ) .\nThis along with (31) recovers (2.11) of Borisov and Pavlov [6]2.

(33)\nRemark 4.2. The terms inside the logarithmic functions in the above Hamiltonian are positive if we exclude collisions and antipodal configurations. In fact, using the definition (28) of \u00b5ij ,\n|\u00b5ij | = |\u03bbij | |\u03bbiN | |\u03bbjN | < 2|\u03bbiN | |\u03bbjN | \u21d0\u21d2 |\u00b5ij |\n|\u03bbiN ||\u03bbjN | < 2\n2Note that our Poisson bracket (3) for the original dynamics is R2 times their bracket and hence the difference by\nthe factor R2 carries over here as well."

First recall from Theorem 4.3 (ii) that the variables {Re\u00b5ij}1\u2264i<j\u22643 depend on the rest of the variables implicitly as\nfij(\u03b6) := Re\u00b5ij \u2212 (Re\u00b5ij)\n2 + (Im\u00b5ij) 2\n|\u03bbiN |2|\u03bbjN |2 \u2212 |\u03bbiN |2 \u2212 |\u03bbjN |2 + 4 = 0 with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 3.\nThe Hamiltonian for the shape dynamics is\nH(\u03b6) := \u2212 1 4\u03c0R2  \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u22643 \u0393i\u0393j ln ( R2 ( 4\u2212 |\u00b5ij | 2 |\u03bbi4|2|\u03bbj4|2 )) + \u03934 \u2211 1\u2264i\u22643 \u0393i ln ( R2(4\u2212 |\u03bbi4|2) ) , and, recall from Theorem 4.3 (iii) (see also Proposition 3.6) that the shape dynamics possesses a family of Casimirs. Particularly, we have\nC2(\u03b6) := 4\u2211 i=1 \u03932i + 1 2 \u2211 1\u2264i<j\u22643 \u0393i\u0393j |\u00b5ij |2 |\u03bbi4|2|\u03bbj4|2 + \u03934 2 \u2211 1\u2264i\u22643 \u0393i |\u03bbi4|2 .\nWe would like to use the energy\u2013Casimir method using {fij}1\u2264i<j\u22643 as additional invariants as well. Specifically, let us write the tetrahedron (relative) equilibrium as\n\u03b6e := ( 2\u221a 3 , 2\u221a 3 , 2\u221a 3 , 8 3 \u221a 3 i, \u2212 8 3 \u221a 3 i, 8 3 \u221a 3 i ) ,\nand seek a Lyapunov function of the form\nE(\u03b6) := H(\u03b6) + 1 \u03c0R2\n( 1\n8 \u03a6(C2(\u03b6)\u2212 C2|e) +\n3\n256 \u03a8(f12(\u03b6), f13(\u03b6), f23(\u03b6)) ) with some smooth functions \u03a6: R \u2192 R and \u03a8: R3 \u2192 R, where C2|e := C2(\u03b6e). Then E is an invariant of the shape dynamics because H, C2, and {fij}1\u2264i<j\u22643 are all invariants.\nIt is then a straightforward computation to show that the gradient DE(\u03b6e) vanishes if\n\u03a6\u2032(0) = \u22123 2 , D\u03a8(0) = 0. (35)\nIn order to show that \u03b6e is stable, it suffices to show that there exist \u03a6 and \u03a8 such that (35) holds and also the Hessian D2E(\u03b6e) is positive definite. To that end, set\nA := 256\n9 \u03c0R2D2E(\u03b6e),\n19\nand let D2ij\u03a8 denote the second derivative DiDj\u03a8 with i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Assuming that \u03a6\u2032\u2032(0) = 0 and D2ij\u03a8(0) = 0 for i 6= j, the leading principal minors {di}9i=1 of A satisfy\nd1 = \u03931(\u03932 + \u03933 + \u03934), d2 = \u03931\u03932(\u03933 + \u03934)(\u03931 + \u03932 + \u03933 + \u03934), d3 = \u03931\u03932\u03933 ( \u039321\u03934 + \u03934(\u03932 + \u03933 + \u03934) 2 + 2\u03931(\u03934(\u03933 + \u03934) + \u03932(2\u03933 + \u03934)) ) ,\nand\nd4 d3 = 1 3 D211\u03a8(0),\nd5 d2 = \u03931\u03932\u03933\u03934D 2 11\u03a8(0),\nd6 d5 = 1 3 D222\u03a8(0),\nd7 d1 =(\u03931\u03932\u03933\u03934) 2D211\u03a8(0)D 2 22\u03a8(0),\nd8 d7 = 1 3 D233\u03a8(0),\nd9 d7/d1 = \u03931\u03932\u03933\u03934D 2 33\u03a8(0).\nTherefore, if \u0393i > 0 (or \u0393i < 0) for every i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}, then dk > 0 for k \u2208 {1, . . . , 9}, and hence A is positive definite, provided that D2ii\u03a8(0) > 0 for every i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}; for example, one may take\n\u03a6(x) = \u22123 2 x, \u03a8(y1, y2, y3) = y 2 1 + y 2 2 + y 2 3\nto satisfy the conditions we impose.\n6. Conclusion and Outlook\n6.1. Conclusion. We found the Hamiltonian formulation for the shape dynamics of N point vortices on the sphere by first lifting the dynamics from S2R to C2 and then applying U(2)-reduction followed by TN\u22121-reduction, as opposed to performing the (direct) SO(3)-reduction.\nThe U(2)-reduction was facilitated by a dual pair found by Skerritt and Vizman [46] and yields a Lie\u2013Poisson dynamics on the dual of the Lie algebra u(N)\u0393 defined in Section 3.2, whereas the TN\u22121reduction was a standard Poisson reduction. The resulting shape variables give a parametrization of an ambient space of the (SO(3)-reduced) shape space that is hard to parametrize directly. As a result, our approach yields a concrete expression for the shape dynamics that is difficult to obtain by the SO(3)-reduction.\nWe also found a family of Casimirs for the shape dynamics exploiting the Lie\u2013Poisson structure. As an application, we applied our formulation to the tetrahedron relative equilibrium of nonidentical vortices, and proved that it is a stable equilibrium of the shape dynamics if all the circulations have the same sign, generalizing some of existing works on the problem.\n6.2. Outlook. There are several topics to explore for future work that are suggested by the reviewers.\nIt is interesting to see if our shape variables facilitate explicit integration for those integrable\ncases, particularly N = 3.\nIn order to better understand the geometry of the shape dynamics, we need to know the geometry of the coadjoint orbit O \u2282 u(N)\u2217\u0393. This is fairly simple if all the circulations have the same sign\u2014 in which case U(D\u0393) is isomorphic to U(N) (and compact), and so O is essentially the coadjoint orbit in u(N)\u2217. However, the general case requires a classification of the coadjoint orbits of the (non-compact) indefinite unitary group U(p, q) with signature (p, q). Also, given the compactness of the shape space, this suggests that the momentum map N is proper, giving an insight into the structure of O."

We define a basis {\u03c4i}3i=1 for su(2) by setting\n\u03c41 := \u2212 i\n2\n[ 0 1\n1 0\n] , \u03c42 := \u2212 i\n2 [ 0 \u2212i i 0 ] , \u03c43 := \u2212 i 2 [ 1 0 0 \u22121 ] so that [\u03c4i, \u03c4j ] = \u03c4k for every even permutation (i, j, k) of (1, 2, 3). We may then identify su(2) with R3 via the map\nf : R3 \u2192 su(2); \u03be = (\u03be1, \u03be2, \u03be3) 7\u2192 3\u2211 j=1 \u03bej\u03c4j = \u2212 i 2 [ \u03be3 \u03be1 \u2212 i\u03be2 \u03be1 + i\u03be2 \u2212\u03be3 ] . (A.1)\nThe inner product on su(2) is inherited from u(2):\n\u3008\u03be, \u03b7\u3009 := 2 tr(\u03be\u2217\u03b7) = \u03be \u00b7 \u03b7, (A.2)\ni.e., it is compatible with the standard dot product in R3 under the above identification. It is also straightforward to see that the commutator in su(2) is compatible with the cross product in R3 in the sense that, for all \u03be,\u03b7 \u2208 R3,\nf(\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7) = [f(\u03be), f(\u03b7)]. (A.3)\nThat is, f gives a Lie algebra isomorphism between R3 and su(2).\nA.2. The ad and ad\u2217 operators in su(2) and R3. The property (A.3) indicates that\nf(\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7) = [\u03be, \u03b7] = ad\u03be \u03b7.\nHence for every \u00b5 \u2208 su(2)\u2217, we have\u2329 ad\u2217\u03be \u00b5, \u03b7 \u232a = \u3008\u00b5, ad\u03be \u03b7\u3009 = \u00b5 \u00b7 (\u03be \u00d7 \u03b7) = (\u00b5\u00d7 \u03be) \u00b7 \u03b7.\nSo we have\nad\u2217\u03be \u00b5 = \u00b5\u00d7 \u03be\nunder the above identification of su(2) and su(2)\u2217 with R3.\nAppendix B. Recovering Original Dynamics from Lifted Dynamics\nThis appendix gives a proof of Proposition 2.1. The main idea is to use a dual pair to find a\nnatural parametrization of the Hopf fibration S3\u221a R \u2192 S2R.\n21\nB.1. Symplectic Reduction via Dual Pair. Since the reduction is performed for each copy of C2 in (C2)N separately, we first perform the reduction for a single copy of C2. Hence the momentum map J is, dropping the subscripts for \u03d5,\nJ : C2 \u2192 R; J(\u03d5) = \u2212 2 R \u0393\u2016\u03d5\u20162.\nIn order to construct a dual pair, we also define an action of SU(2) on C2 as follows:\nSU(2)\u00d7 C2 \u2192 C2; (U,\u03d5) 7\u2192 U\u03d5.\nFor every \u03be \u2208 su(2), its corresponding infinitesimal generator is\n\u03beC2(\u03d5) = \u03be\u03d5.\nWe identify su(2)\u2217 with su(2) via the inner product (A.2) from Appendix A.

Notice that the above expression for M essentially gives the Hopf fibration.\nAs a result, we have a pair of momentum maps defined on C2:\nR C2 su(2)\u2217.J M\nThis pair of momentum maps is known to constitute a dual pair; see Golubitsky et al. [10] and Holm and Vizman [12]. This implies that the Marsden\u2013Weinstein quotient J\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/S1 is symplectomorphic to a coadjoint orbit O in su(2)\u2217. More specifically, the momentum map M restricted to the level set J\u22121(\u22122\u0393) gives rise to the symplectomorphism M : J\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/S1 \u2192 O, where O is equipped with the (+)-Kirillov\u2013Kostant\u2013Souriau (KKS) symplectic structure (see, e.g., Kirillov"

It is well known that O is a two-dimensional sphere as well. One can also see it from the expression (B.1) that if \u03d5 \u2208 J\u22121(\u22122\u0393), then \u2016\u03d5\u2016 = \u221a R, and so M(\u03d5), as a vector in R3, is in the sphere with radius \u0393 centered at the origin. Hence J\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/S1 is a sphere as well. In order to show that the reduced dynamics is indeed the point vortex dynamics on S2R, we identify J\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/S1 with S2R via\nM : J\u22121(\u22122\u0393)/S1 \u223c= S2R \u2192 O \u223c= S2\u0393; x 7\u2192 \u0393\nR x.\nIn other words, we are setting \u0393Rx = M(\u03d5).

Vortex Dynamics on S2R and Lie\u2013Poisson Equation. Now let us come back to the lifted dynamics of N vortices in (C2)N . The above argument applies to each copy of C2, and so we have the momentum map\nM : (C2)N \u2192 (su(2)\u2217)N \u223c= (R3)N ; (\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5N ) 7\u2192 1\nR (\u03931x1, . . . ,\u0393NxN ),\nwhere, for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , N},\nxi := ( 2 Re(z\u0304iui), 2 Im(z\u0304iui), |zi|2 \u2212 |ui|2 ) \u2208 R3. (B.3)\nSince each copy of S2R is equipped with the symplectic form (B.2), this gives rise to the symplectic form (2) on (S2R)N . The corresponding Poisson bracket on (R3)N is then (3).\nOne then sees that HR3 : (R3)N \u2192 R from (4b) is the collective Hamiltonian, i.e., H\u0304 \u25e6M = H where H is defined in (7). As a result, the reduced dynamics is the Hamiltonian system (5). This completes the proof of Proposition 2.1.\n23\nAppendix C. Proof of Proposition 3.6\n(i) Let j \u2208 N be arbitrary. Let us first show that Cj is indeed a real-valued function: For every \u03bb \u2208 u(N)\u2217\u0393, we have\nCj(\u03bb) = tr ( (\u2212iD\u0393\u03bb)j ) = tr [( (\u2212iD\u0393\u03bb)T\n)j] = tr ( (\u2212i\u03bb\u2217D\u0393)j\n) = tr ( (i\u03bbD\u0393) j )\n= tr ( (iD\u0393\u03bb) j ) = Cj(\u03bb).\nWe also see that Cj is Ad \u2217-invariant: For every U \u2208 U(D\u0393), we have\nCj(Ad \u2217 U \u03bb) = tr ( (iD\u0393U \u2217\u03bbU)j )\n= tr ( (iUD\u0393U \u2217\u03bb)j )\n= tr ( (iD\u0393\u03bb) j ) = Cj(\u03bb).\nSince any Ad\u2217-invariant differentiable function is a Casimir (see, e.g., Marsden and Ratiu [28, Corollary 14.4.3]), this implies that Cj is a Casimir function for the Lie\u2013Poisson bracket (26).\n(ii) Let us set A := iD\u0393\u03bb so that we have Cj(\u03bb) = tr ( Aj ) . By the Cayley\u2013Hamilton Theorem, we\nhave p(A) = 0, where p is the characteristic polynomial of A:\np(x) := det(xI \u2212A) = xN \u2212 c1xN\u22121 \u2212 c2xN\u22122 \u2212 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2212 cN ,\nwhere the coefficients {ck(\u03bb)}Nk=1 are determined by the Faddeev\u2013LeVerrier algorithm (see, e.g., Gantmacher [8, p. 87]):\nA1 := A, c1 = tr(A1), B1 := A1 \u2212 c1I, A2 := AB1, c2 = 1\n2 tr(A2), B2 := A2 \u2212 c2I,\n...\nAN := ABN\u22121, cN = 1\nN tr(AN ).\nSpecifically, this implies that each cj with j \u2208 {1, . . . , N} depends on A as a smooth function of { tr ( Ak )}j\nk=1 . We also obtain the expression\ncN = 1\nN tr(AN ) + . . . ,\nwhere the remaining terms do not contain tr(AN ).

It implies\nthat CN (\u03bb) can be expressed in terms of {Cj(\u03bb)}N\u22121j=1 . This argument extends to Cj(\u03bb) for j \u2265 N + 1 recursively."

The dot product in R3 is related to the inner product in C2 as follows:\nx1 \u00b7 x2 = 4(Re(z\u03041u1) Re(z\u03042u2) + Im(z\u03041u1) Im(z\u03042u2)) + ( |z1|2 \u2212 |u1|2 )( |z2|2 \u2212 |u2|2 ) = 4 Re(z\u03041u1z2u\u03042) + ( |z1|2 \u2212 |u1|2 )( |z2|2 \u2212 |u2|2\n) = 2(z\u03041u1z2u\u03042 + z1u\u03041z\u03042u2) + ( |z1|2 \u2212 |u1|2 )( |z2|2 \u2212 |u2|2\n) = 2 ( z\u03041u1z2u\u03042 + z1u\u03041z\u03042u2 + |z1|2|z2|2 + |u1|2|u2|2 ) \u2212 ( |z1|2 + |u1|2 )( |z2|2 + |u2|2\n) = 2(z\u03041z2 + u\u03041u2)(z1z\u03042 + u1u\u03042)\u2212 ( |z1|2 + |u1|2 )( |z2|2 + |u2|2\n) = 2|z\u03041z2 + u\u03041u2|2 \u2212 ( |z1|2 + |u1|2 )( |z2|2 + |u2|2\n) = 2|\u03d5\u22171\u03d52|2 \u2212 \u2016\u03d51\u2016 2\u2016\u03d52\u20162. (D.1)\nHence we have |x1|2 = \u2016\u03d51\u20164. This implies that that the three sphere with radius \u221a R is mapped to the two-sphere with radius R (both centered at the origin) under the map (B.3).\nWe also have\n|x1 \u2212 x2|2 = |x1|2 + |x2|2 \u2212 2x1 \u00b7 x2 = \u2016\u03d51\u20164 + \u2016\u03d52\u20164 \u2212 4|\u03d5\u22171\u03d52|2 + 2\u2016\u03d51\u2016 2\u2016\u03d52\u20162\n= ( \u2016\u03d51\u20162 + \u2016\u03d52\u20162 )2 \u2212 4|\u03d5\u22171\u03d52|2, (D.2)\nand so, if \u03d51, \u03d52 \u2208 S3\u221aR, then x1,x2 \u2208 S 2 R, and |x1 \u2212 x2|2 = 4 ( R2 \u2212 |\u03d5\u22171\u03d52|2 ) . (D.3)\nD.3. Triple Product in R3. We have\n(\u03d5\u22171\u03d52)(\u03d5 \u2217 3\u03d51)(\u03d5 \u2217 2\u03d53) = (z\u03041z2 + u\u03041u2)(z\u03043z1 + u\u03043u1)(z\u03042z3 + u\u03042u3)\n= |z1|2|z2|2|z3|2 + |u1|2|u2|2|u3|2 + \u2211\n(i,j,k)\u2208Z3\n( |zi|2zj z\u0304ku\u0304juk + |ui|2z\u0304jzkuj u\u0304k ) ,\nwhere Z3 is the set of all cyclic permutations of (1, 2, 3), i.e., Z3 := {(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2)}.\n25\nHowever,\n|z1|2|z2|2|z3|2 + |u1|2|u2|2|u3|2\n= 3\u220f i=1 ( 1 2 (|zi|2 + |ui|2) + 1 2 (|zi|2 \u2212 |ui|2) ) + 3\u220f i=1 ( 1 2 (|zi|2 + |ui|2)\u2212 1 2 (|zi|2 \u2212 |ui|2) )\n= 1\n4  3\u220f i=1 (|zi|2 + |ui|2) + \u2211\n(i,j,k)\u2208Z3\n(|zi|2 + |ui|2)(|zj |2 \u2212 |uj |2)(|zk|2 \u2212 |uk|2)  = 1\n4 |x1||x2||x3|+ \u2211 (i,j,k)\u2208Z3 |xi|x3jx3k  . We also have\nRe(zj z\u0304ku\u0304juk) = Re(z\u0304juj z\u0304kuk)\n= Re(z\u0304juj) Re(z\u0304kuk) + Im(z\u0304juj) Im(z\u0304kuk) = 1\n4 (x1jx 1 k + x 2 jx 2 k)\n= 1\n4 (xj \u00b7 xk \u2212 x3jx3k)\nand\nIm(zj z\u0304ku\u0304juk) = Im(z\u0304juj z\u0304kuk)\n= Re(z\u0304juj) Im(z\u0304kuk)\u2212 Im(z\u0304juj) Re(z\u0304kuk) = 1\n4 (x1jx 2 k \u2212 x2jx1k)\n= 1\n4 (xj \u00d7 xk)3,\nwhere we wrote the components of xi as (x 1 i , x 2 i , x 3 i ), and (xj \u00d7 xk)3 signifies the third component of xj \u00d7 xk. As a result, we obtain\nRe((\u03d5\u22171\u03d52)(\u03d5 \u2217 3\u03d51)(\u03d5 \u2217 2\u03d53)) =\n1\n4 |x1||x2||x3|+ \u2211 (i,j,k)\u2208Z3 |xi|x3jx3k  + 1\n4 \u2211 (i,j,k)\u2208Z3 ( |zi|2 + |ui|2 ) (xj \u00b7 xk \u2212 x3jx3k)\n= 1\n4 |x1||x2||x3|+ \u2211 (i,j,k)\u2208Z3 |xi|xj \u00b7 xk \n26 TOMOKI OHSAWA\nand\nIm((\u03d5\u22171\u03d52)(\u03d5 \u2217 3\u03d51)(\u03d5 \u2217 2\u03d53)) =\n1\n4\n( |z1|2 \u2212 |u1|2 ) (x2 \u00d7 x3)3\n+ 1\n4\n( |z2|2 \u2212 |u2|2 ) (x3 \u00d7 x1)3 + 1\n4\n( |z3|2 \u2212 |u3|2 ) (x1 \u00d7 x2)3\n= 1\n4\n[ x31(x2 \u00d7 x3)3 + x32(x3 \u00d7 x1)3 + x33(x1 \u00d7 x2)3 ] = 1\n4 det[x1 x2 x3]\n= 1\n4 x1 \u00b7 (x2 \u00d7 x3). (D.4)\nParticularly, if xi \u2208 S2R then \u03d5i \u2208 S3\u221aR for i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, and so (D.1) gives, for all i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3},\nxi \u00b7 xj = 2|\u03d5\u2217i\u03d5j |2 \u2212R2.\nSo we have\nRe((\u03d5\u22171\u03d52)(\u03d5 \u2217 3\u03d51)(\u03d5 \u2217 2\u03d53)) =\nR\n4\n( R2 + x1 \u00b7 x2 + x3 \u00b7 x1 + x2 \u00b7 x3 ) = R\n2\n( |\u03d5\u22171\u03d52| 2 + |\u03d5\u22173\u03d51| 2 + |\u03d5\u22172\u03d53| 2 \u2212R2 ) .\n(D.5)\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Melvin Leok for helpful comments and discussions, and the reviewers for their comments and suggestions including the possible future work discussed in Section 6.2.
