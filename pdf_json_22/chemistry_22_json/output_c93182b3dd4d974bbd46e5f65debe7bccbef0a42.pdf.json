    "abstractText": "In view of the intense interest in applications of silver nanoparticles in products for the medical field and in food preservation packaging due to their antimicrobial properties, the ecotoxicology of silver nanocomposites was evaluated in films. Test with the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter, to evaluate embryonic development and contamination by the action of silver and titanium nanoparticles in polyethylene nanocomposite films presents new results. The silver nanoparticle\u2019s stability in polymeric materials can be enhanced by adding carriers, such as titanium dioxide and montmorillonite clay (MMT) without to producing one unfriendly material. For this research, low-density polyethylene (LDPE)/linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) were used processed in a twin-screw extruder, followed by gamma irradiation with 25 kGy and characterized by ecotoxicology assays, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM\u2013EDX), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and mechanical properties. The antibacterial properties of the LDPE films were investigated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The gamma irradiation had an important effect in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles resulting in bactericidal activity and the death of 100% of the tested bacteria. The evaluation of the environment was considered with the ecotoxicological investigation carried out. The results indicated that the polymeric films with silver nanoparticles and TiO2 do not contaminate the environment and neither interfere with the larval development of Echinometra lucunter. The obtained materials can be used in various applications with antimicrobial properties. * Washington Luiz Oliani washoliani@yahoo.com.br 1 Nuclear and Energy Research Institute, IPEN-CNEN/SP, Av.

The current nanocomposites present a relatively easy technology of preparation and application with low cost to produce new materials in substitution of available products [1, 2].\nWith the emergence of pathogenic bacterial strains resistant to one or more antibiotics, the medicine needs new disinfection systems. Metallic nanoparticle systems are one of the most promising systems for fulfilling this function [3\u20136].\nAntimicrobial materials are not only used in medical applications, such as catheters [7] and prostheses [8], but also in food packaging [9, 10] and in paint industry [11] among others. One must be aware of the different public sectors where there is the possibility of proliferation of bacteria and fungi, such as hospitals, schools, offices, etc., where infectious diseases can be transmitted through surfaces [12]. In our days, plastics more than ever constitute these surfaces. Among the polyolefins, LDPE has important properties: low (weight, temperature toughness, density, moisture absorption), great mechanical properties, good processability, high stiffness in molded parts, tear-resistance besides being recyclable [13\u201318]. For these properties, LDPE has a wide field of applications in which the biocidal activity can be added based on many examples of polymers cited in the literature. For example, the Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) with different types of nanoparticles showed antibacterial properties. It gained mechanical resistance compared to conventional polymers [19].\n10951\n1 3\nPolymer Bulletin (2022) 79:10949\u201310968\nPolyacrylonitrile nanocomposite (PAN) films containing silver nanoparticles developed as multifunctional film matrix with has biocidal activity [20]. In parallel, direct surfaces treatment of as for PP (amphiphilic polymer) of PP-g-PEG sheets having embedded metal nanoparticles were synthesized with antibacterial efficiency [6]. Investigation of it on biomaterials, as the literature reports, showed the efficacy in preventing infection of a newly developed PP-g-PEG and Ag-PPg-PEG polymer-coated shunt catheters. Especially Ag-PP-g-PEG polymer coating was effective to prevent implant-related infections in the central nervous system in rats [21].\nAnother example is the study of PET-g-MAA fibers coated with AgNPs that had an antimicrobial effect on both bacterial species (E. coli and S. aureus). The synthesized material was obtained easily and cheaply with surface-bound Ag + ions converted to AgNPs (silver nanoparticles) without using any chemical reducing agents and had no cytotoxicity effects on L929 fibroblast cells [22].\nSilver nanoparticles coated with poly(styrene-g-soybean oil) graft copolymers using soy oil macroperoxide as a nanosilver carrier. The polyolefin became an efficient bactericide, in addition to producing nanocomposites with fluorescence properties, making them promising materials [11]. PET fabrics knew for not preventing the growth of microorganisms, when PET surfaces were firstly modified by MAA grafting and HMDA attaching, and after modified by silk Sirina-AgNPs immobilization. It was found that the PET S-AgNPs had antimicrobial activity on both gramnegative and gram-positive bacteria [23]. The number of applications for AgNPs increases exponentially, including nanosilver in association with other metallic nanoparticles [24]. With this, the search for new antimicrobial and antiviral materials becomes timely and eminet, including in the fight against Covid 19 [25, 26].\nSilver and titanium nanoparticles are known for their biomedical properties in common uses [27]. TiO2 is an antimicrobial agent effective in bacterial cells, fungi, algae, and viruses. Its photodegradation is due to the high oxidizing action and hydroxyl radicals (OH*) species in oxidation systems. The photocatalytic property of TiO2 is manifested under ultraviolet light. The doping of Ag nanoparticles in TiO2 not only increases the photocatalytic activity of titania, but also promotes properties of antibacterial activity for the material in the absence of ultraviolet light [28].\nThe improved photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO2 thin film for disinfection can be attributed to the higher production rate of ROS reactive species, compared to TiO2 [29].\nThe addition of clay-like montmorillonite strengthens the polymeric compound favoring the nucleation of silver nanoparticles. The parallel stacked layered clay structure facilitates the controlled diffusion of silver nanoparticles [30]. The creation of a biocidal material with slow release of silver species can prolong the biocidal activity [31, 32].\nAt the cellular level, many mechanisms of AgNPs toxicity were reported. This includes the generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS), DNA damage, and cytokine induction during in\u00a0vitro studies [33]. On the surfaces, the dissolution of AgNPs releases silver ions that trigger the inactivation of respiratory enzymes, interrupt electron transport, and alter the permeability of the bacterial membrane and viral protein wrap, which causes the death of cells [29].\n10952 Polymer Bulletin (2022) 79:10949\u201310968\n1 3\nIn contrast to the benefits, it can increase the disposal of nanoparticles into the environment. Consequently, it is necessary to be very careful with the application of nanomaterials, as the beneficial properties derived from them can be lost due to inadequate use in biological systems [27] in which cytotoxicity testing [34] and ecotoxicity testing [35] are of great importance.\nIn this context, the literature also describes the interest in ecotoxicology tests for the evaluation of nanocomposites. The sea urchin Echinometra lucunter, which populates all the Brazilian coast, is used in ecotoxicology tests due to the sensitivity of the early embryonary stages for numerous laboratories of marine coast. For pollutants present in seawater, even in very low concentrations, bioassays routinely use sea urchin larvae embryos to assess water quality [36\u201338].\nFor these senses, in present work on LDPE nanocomposites proposed the investigation of ecotoxicity of the material in urchin larvae. The innovative aspect of our study is to improve antimicrobial properties to the surface of LDPE nanocomposites by gamma irradiation, as an effective process for totally reducing metallic ions simultaneously to sterilization without chemicals. Evaluation of nanocomposites activity evolving the irradiation for efficient silver nanoparticles on TiO2 carrier reduced the formation of agglomerates, consequently, improved bactericidal efficiency."

After the exposure period, the test was ended by adding of 0.5\u00a0mL of borax-buffered formaldehyde to all replicates.\nSubsequently, the content of each replica was observed using a Sedgewick-Rafter microscope. The first 100 embryos were counted and their degree of development was assessed. Embryos that reached a well-developed pluteus larva stage were considered normal, while those that presented morphological changes and/or developmental delay were considered affected.

Morphological properties of the AgNPs influence their biocidal activity, for example: size, shape, and surface coating. It is important to note that same property also influences the cito and ecotoxicity of the AgNPs. These properties of AgNPs, combined with their high production volume, are a stimulus for research on the impact and harmfulness of silver nanoparticles [47, 48].\nThere is concern about increasing the use of manufactured nanomaterials, for example, TiO2 and AgNPs, and their possible release into the environment via wastewater treatment plants. It poses a potential threat for aquatic organisms, and its effect on the ecosystem is of great importance for environmental risk assessment.

The percentage of surviving microorganisms decreased\n1 3\nsignificantly in the PENC1 sample with 5.83% for S. aureus and 8.89% for E. coli, whereas for the PENC2 sample is increased to 21.25% for S. aureus and 26.30% for E. coli, also indicative of a good result. For the PENC3 film, the results were more expressive (S. aureus = 5.42% and E. coli = 7.78%) suggests that increasing silver to 1 wt% has one significant effect on activity against microorganisms.\nThe PENC4 and 5 films originated, respectively, from PENC1 and PENC3 irradiated at a dose of 25\u00a0kGy. The results showed a remarkable efficiency of irradiation in the reduction of ions to nanosilver with consequence of total bacteria death, reaching values very close to zero.\nTable\u00a02 reports the antibacterial reduction rate of samples composed of PENC films, using samples in dimensions of (40 \u00d7 40) mm2, according to standard test JIS Z 2801 [42].\n10959\n1 3\nPolymer Bulletin (2022) 79:10949\u201310968\nRegarding PENC3 compounds with 1 wt% of silver particles and titanium, is remarkable a significant antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with antimicrobial activity values of 1.27 and 1.11 for E. coli, respectively (see Table\u00a02). In addition, the results of the sample irradiated with 25\u00a0kGy, PENC4, showed a very significant antimicrobial activity for S. aureus, 3.04, and E. coli, 2.94, and also for the PENC5 sample S. aureus 2.85 and E. coli 2.71.\nThe results of logarithmic reduction, are very expressive for the irradiated samples PENC4 and PENC5 that presented values 2.85 for S. aureus and 2.71 for E. coli.\nThe high visible light photocatalytic activity of the Ag/TiO2/MMT is ascribed owing to the increase in surface-active centers and the localized surface plasmon effect of the silver nanoparticles. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons generated on the silver nanoparticles from the plasmon excitation are transferred to the neighboring TiO2 particles, which function as the photocatalytic centers [49].\nThe release of Ag+ present in the polymer surface depends on the diffusion of water molecules coming from the bacteria medium into the surface of particles [50]. Highly non-polar polymers such as allows the diffusion of those water molecules on interface through holes or micron-scale defects [51]. Gamma irradiation induces ionization and excitation of the water molecules, generating radiolytic molecular and radical species such as solvated electrons, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen atoms. The solvated electrons and hydrogen atoms reduce the metal ions to metal atoms, which coalesce to form more nanoparticles [52].\nPolymeric nanocomposites irradiated with gamma radiation acquire more comprehensive biocidal properties compared to non-irradiated ones. The nanocomposite is effective against tested pathogenic microorganisms due to its high surface area and reduction in aggregates size due to the gamma rays [53] in surface of the carrier TiO2/MMT to perform a more stable bactericide activity."

Benhacine et\u00a0al. [56] corroborate with that idea and the silver incorporation in MMT plays an important role in the crystallinity degree of PENC that increases when added Ag\u2013MMT. Another important aspect reported by Ghosh et\u00a0al.
