    "abstractText": "Molecular generation (MG) via machine learning (ML) has speeded drug structural optimization, especially for targets with a large amount of reported bioactivity data. However, molecular generation for structural optimization is often powerless for new targets. DNA-encoded library (DEL) can generate systematic, target-specific activity data, including novel targets with few or unknown activity data. Therefore, this study aims to overcome the limitation of molecular generation in the structural optimization for the new target. Firstly, we generated molecules using the structure-affinity data (2.96 million samples) for 3C-like protease (3CLpro) from our own-built DEL platform to get rid of using public databases (e.g., CHEMBL and ZINC). Subsequently, to analyze the effect of transfer learning on the positive rate of the molecule generation model, molecular docking and affinity model based on DEL data were applied to explore the enhanced impact of transfer learning on molecule generation. In addition, the generated molecules are subjected to multiple filtering, including physicochemical properties, drug-like properties, and pharmacophore evaluation, molecular docking to determine themolecules for further study and verified by molecular dynamics simulation.",

However, molecular generation for structural optimization is often powerless for new targets. DNA-encoded library (DEL) can generate systematic, target-specific activity data, including novel targets with few or unknown activity data. Therefore, this study aims to overcome the limitation of molecular generation in the structural optimization for the new target. Firstly, we generated molecules using the structure-affinity data (2.96 million samples) for 3C-like protease (3CLpro) from our own-built DEL platform to get rid of using public databases (e.g., CHEMBL and ZINC). Subsequently, to analyze the effect of transfer learning on the positive rate of the molecule generation model, molecular docking and affinity model based on DEL data were applied to explore the enhanced impact of transfer learning on molecule generation. In addition, the generated molecules are subjected to multiple filtering, including physicochemical properties, drug-like properties, and pharmacophore evaluation, molecular docking to determine themolecules for further study and verified by molecular dynamics simulation.\nKEYWORDS\ndel, machine learning, molecule generation, 3C-like protease, transfer learning\n1 Introduction\nDrug structural optimization (Stokes et al., 2020; Wang Z.-Y. et al., 2022) is to design new molecules with better specific properties, either to increase desired bioactivities or decrease side effects. In the early stages, the conception and evaluation of new proposed molecules rely on medicinal chemists\u2019 experience and knowledge of basic chemistry and biology. Later, with the improved computer-aided drug programming level, the ligandbased quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model (Cherkasov et al., 2014) combined withmolecular docking andmolecular dynamics simulation were used for large numbers of molecule screening to obtain molecules efficiently.

Zhavoronkov et al. (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019) discovered a kinase inhibitor of DDR1 in 41 days by building a deep-learning molecular generation architecture GENTRL. Then, applying deep learning in drug design became one of the top 10 breakthrough technologies in MIT Technology Review 2020 (MIT Technology Review, 2020). Full use of this tool can explore more expansive chemical space and generate molecules of desired physicochemical and pharmacological properties, accelerating drug development (Xu et al., 2019; Ar\u00fas-Pous et al., 2020; Kotsias et al., 2020).\nThe strategy for molecular generative models through deep learning can be divided into ligand-based and structure-based (also called receptor-based). Ligand-based molecule generation requires a set of experimentally validated active compounds. ML generates molecules by learning the common features of the active compounds (Liu et al., 2021; Wang M.-Y. et al., 2022). Structure-based molecular generation considers ligand and receptor interactions. Traditional structure-based molecular generation is a fragment-based approach that adds, deletes, or replaces chemical fragments of ligands in pockets (Batool et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2022). The Algorithm using the protein\u2019s structural information to design new molecules has not been\nwidely validated due to the limitation of high computational resource consumption (Skalic et al., 2019; Born et al., 2021; Grechishnikova, 2021). A structure-based molecular generation often requires three-dimensional information on the binding pockets within ligands (Wang M.-Y. et al., 2022; Long et al., 2022). Facing new targets, often there are neither revealed binding pockets nor experimentally validated ligands. The datasets used for ligand-based molecule generation usually come from public databases (such as CHEMBLE, ZINC, etc.), and the specific targets sub-datasets are generally needed to guide the structural optimization. Such a procedure has an unavoidable limitation because of its heavily dependent on public experimental data. For new targets, such dataset is severely lacking. Machine learning cannot be developed without an available dataset. This is the main reason for molecular generation, and even AIDD is still challenging to apply to the structure optimization of hit compounds for new targets. DNAencoded library (DEL) (Dickson et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022; Nie et al., 2022; Song et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2022) is a powerful tool from combinatorial screening and DNA-encoded technology. Compared with traditional highthroughput screening (HTS), DEL technology can efficiently and\nSCHEME 1 DNA-encoded library1 and library2 designed information (A,B); Structures and corresponding inhibition activity for 3CLpro (IC50/\u00b5M) ofH1 and H2 (C,D).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\neconomically generate a large amount of affinity data for specific targets, including new target data (hundreds of billions scale) (Buller et al., 2010; Kalliokoski, 2015). Therefore, using the DEL dataset, mainly the structure-affinity relationship, for molecular generation could be a reasonable solution to the problem of efficient structural optimization for new target drug development.\nDeep learning generative algorithms have been explored for aided drug design. Generally, standard inputs in generative models are linear input symbols like Simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) and molecular graphs. Common generative model architectures include recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Bjerrum and Threlfall, 2017; Segler et al., 2018; Kotsias et al., 2020), autoencoders [AE, VAE (variational AE), AAE (adversarial AE)] (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Makhzani et al., 2015), generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2020). Optimization strategies for generative models include transfer learning (Segler et al., 2018), Bayesian optimization (G\u00f3mezBombarelli et al., 2018), reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2021), and conditional generation (Li et al., 2018). Transfer learning is a strategy for transferring knowledge from prelearned tasks to improve learning performance. Public datasets are usually needed for pre-training till obtaining a greater probability of generating valid molecules. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is retrained using known active molecules. Generally, the overall distribution of the pre-trained CHEMBL or ZINC large dataset is quite different from that of specific target active molecules, negatively affecting transfer learning (Zhao\net al., 2014). Transfer learning using the DEL dataset is expected to address this obstacle effectively. The DEL dataset herein is composed of 3 groups of building blocks. We used the high-affinity molecules from DEL (which appeared as compounds with high count values in DEL) to reduce the distribution inconsistency between the pre-trained model and transfer learning. The beneficial effect of transfer learning herein is confirmed and consistent with the DEL dataset. In this experiment, we used the molecular dataset with higher counts in DEL, molecules with more potent binding force to the target 3CLpro, for transfer learning, thereby increasing the probability of generating active molecules.\nIn this study, we set out to solve the following challenges: using DEL technology to construct two DEL libraries for 3CLpro and performing data analysis combined with chemical synthesis. Active hit compounds H1 and H2 (Scheme 1) were found via bioactivity assay. Subsequently, the own-built DEL dataset was used to establish a molecular generative model to obtain a dataset with broad chemical space distribution. The obtained molecule dataset was directly applied with several subsequent filtering steps. On the other hand, molecules with high count values in the DEL dataset were defined as positive samples for transfer learning to obtain another dataset. The above two datasets were filtered by the druggability and pharmacophore model. Finally, the obtained molecules were verified by molecular docking and dynamics simulation, which confirmed the potential bioactivity of the newly designed molecule (Figure 1)."

            "text": "SMILES or molecular graphs are commonly used for molecular representation. SMILES is a text of molecular structures (Weininger, 1988). Molecular graphs represent the structure of molecules as graphs, where the edges of the graph represent bonds and the dots represent atomic structures (Sun et al., 2020). Molecules were represented as SMILES in three models, RNN, VAE, and AAE, to perform molecule generation. We used pytorch, sklearn, numpy, rdkit,umap-learn, and MOSES benchmark platform (Polykovskiy et al., 2020) to complete the experiments.\nRecurrent neural network (RNN) (Segler et al., 2018) are designed to learn sequential data such as text or speech. The SMILES in DEL are made into a corpus. RNN can learn the grammatical information about the SMILES to know which parts of molecules tend to be connected. RNN can generate sequences through forward propagation (Bjerrum and Threlfall, 2017). By treating the molecule generation process as a series of steps and sampling the network at each step, generating effective molecules is highly probable and structurally similar to the training molecules. The architecture used in RNN consists of an embedding layer, three LSTM layers, and a linear layer.\nVariational autoencoder (VAE) (Bowman et al., 2015) consists of an encoder and a decoder. The former encodes the input data into a latent vector, which obeys the Gaussian Distribution. The decoder restores the latent vector result to the target sample. SMILES are used as the model\u2019s input and output to establish a VAE model. The VAE architecture consists of an embedding layer, an encoder layer, and a decoder layer. The encoder and decoder layers consist of a GRU layer and two linear layers.\nAdversarial Autoencoder (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2015) is similar to VAE principally. The difference is that based on the encoder and the decoder, a discriminator is introduced, which is responsible for distinguishing the calculated latent vector in the encoder from the real sample. The encoder and decoder are still accountable for encoding and reconstructing the data. AAE also uses SMILES as input and output. The AAE\u2019s encoder part includes an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a linear layer. The decoder consists of two linear layers, one embedding layer, and one LSTM layer. The discriminator consists of two linear layers where the activation function is ELU (Clevert et al., 2015)."

In detail, the 3CLPro protein with N2 and the ligand N2 showed steady kinetics after 30 and 50 ns, respectively (Figure 5). By monitoring the fluctuation of RMSD, each system is in the range of 2\u00c5 after 50 ns. This suggests that the complex undergoes a conformational change during the simulation that promotes tight binding between the N2 and receptor, and finally, the system reaches a steady state. The RMSF value showed minimal fluctuation, and it remained in the range of 0.05\u20130.2 nm throughout the simulation period for most residues, except that a peak in RMSF value was observed only at residue 1. The less fluctuating performance confirms the strong attachment of the ligand to the protein (Figure 6)."

            "text": "As far as we know, this is the first study that DEL\u2019s dataset has been used for the molecular generation, which will promote the development of the application field of DEL combined with AI. This study preliminarily found that it may be feasible to use DEL data instead of public databases for molecular generation. In particular, for the new target pipeline, molecular generation and affinity model establishment based on DEL data are expected to become a tool with dual functions of drug discovery and further structural optimization. This advantage would be difficult to achieve with public databases due to the scarcity of datasets."
