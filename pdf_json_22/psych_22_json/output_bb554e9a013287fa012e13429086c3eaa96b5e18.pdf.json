Compulsory isolation detoxification is the main treatment measure for drug dependents, whereas psychological interventions in compulsory isolation detoxification centers are extremely inadequate. The current study aimed to examine the effects of mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) on methamphetamine dependence patients in Chinese compulsory isolation detoxification treatment institutions. Forty-one methamphetamine dependent patients received 16-sessions of MBRP in 8 weeks and assessments were conducted at the baseline, 4-, 8-week (after the whole intervention). Results of repeatedmeasured ANOVAs showed there was no significant effect on emotions and cravings. Findings indicated that the effects of MBRP are still difficult to make firm conclusions due to the insignificant results. Future studies should modify the MBRP and ensure that it is suitable for compulsory isolation detoxification treatment institutions in China.",

            "text": "Substance use is a serious public health problem and social problem. According to a report by the Chinese government, the number of drug users in China has reached 1.801million in 2020, 57.2% of them abuse synthetic drugs such asmethamphetamine and ketamine, andmethamphetamine abuse remains a serious problem (1). Compared to traditional drugs, methamphetamine showed higher addictive and neurotoxicity which would cause brain dysfunction, psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, and high risks of relapse (2). Methamphetamine dependent patients generally showed higher craving, impulsive, and negative emotions, and worse cognitive functions (3\u20135).\nIn China, compulsory isolation detoxification is the main treatment measure for drug dependents. Compared with the previous treatment system, compulsory isolation detoxification addresses the importance of psychological intervention among the drug dependents since according to the \u201cDrug Control Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d drug dependents have been defined as both offenders and patients, and psychological interventions should be delivered to help them to keep abstinence. To meet the requirement of \u201cDrug Control Law,\u201d we try to find new psychological intervention strategies which are eligible for compulsory isolation treatment sites.\nMindfulness-based relapse prevention therapy (MBRP) developed by Witkiewitz et al. (6) is one of the psychotherapies targeted at substance use disorders (SUDs). MBRP integrated mindfulness meditation and traditional relapse prevention and aimed to help participants develop a sustainable lifestyle and utilize mindfulness skills as effective coping strategies in the face of high-risk situations to prevent relapse (6).\nThe effect of MBRP on SUDs has received considerable empirical support (7). Compared to the control group, MBRP could reduce patients\u2019 craving for drugs and improve their ability to control their negative emotions which is the high-risk factor for relapse. But whether this intervention is appropriate for Chinese compulsory treatment institutions has not been verified.\nThe pilot study aimed to examine the effectiveness of MBRP on methamphetamine dependent patients in Chinese compulsory isolation detoxification treatment institutes."

Previous studies found that in the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 819075\nFIGURE 1 | The flow chart of the current study.\nFIGURE 2 | The main content of each intervention sessions.\nrehabilitation period, the depression level of methamphetamine dependent patients improved during the time course, which was consistent with the current findings (10). Most notably, the interactions between time and group were not significant on emotions and craving. These results indicated thatMBRP showed no significant improved effects on patients\u2019 depression, anxiety, and craving. Previous studies generally suggested that MBRP is effective for SUDs to improve emotions and reduce cravings (11). Glasner et al. (12) proved that MBRP could significantly reduce stimulant abuse patients\u2019 depression. Similarly, Zullig et al. (13) found that MBRP showed considerable effects on improving opioid use patients\u2019 anxiety.\nHowever, numerous studies have suggested that the MBRP intervention has no significant effects on the improvement of emotions and cravings among SUDs. Previous research observed no significant effects of MBRP on anxiety and craving\n(13). According to Zullig et al. (13), current results may be at least partially explained by the goals of MBRP are to increase the awareness of cravings and reduce behavioral and emotional reactivity to cravings, but not to eliminate the cravings themselves.\nRegarding the current study, it was conducted in the compulsory isolation detoxification treatment institutes, in which patients\u2019 daily schedules were strictly arranged. Thus, the lacking meditation practice might reduce the intervention effect. Another impacting factor is the changing motivation. The participants in the compulsory isolation detoxification treatment institutes are relatively lacking in changing motivation, which might be an important reason for the insignificant effect ofMBRP intervention in the current study (14). Other factors include small sample size, gender bias (all males), which will affect the research findings to a certain extend. More importantly, previous studies\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 819075"

Further studies could conduct in a larger sample size and combine other techniques (such as virtual realit or motivation intervention) with MBRP to improve the effectiveness of MBRP in methamphetamine dependent patients.\nEven the results were negative, the present study still provides preliminary evidence for the implementation of MBRP on methamphetamine patients. Given the specific settings for\ncompulsory rehabilitation treatment in China, it might be necessary to modify MBRP and ensure it is suitable for the current situation.\nLimitations to this study include assessing all data via selfreport scales which might be impacted by social desirability bias, all the included methamphetamine dependent patients are male while gender might influence the vulnerability to methamphetamine toxicity, and lack of biological indicators as the biological improvements might not be reflected in behaviors\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 819075\n(15, 16). It would be worthwhile to conduct further study in a larger sample using comprehensive measurements, such as the behavioral tasks to expand the result."
