In clinical practice, the evaluation approaches are\nmainly based on psychological scales and doctor-patient interviews, which\nare time-consuming and labor-intensive. Also, the accuracy of results mainly\ndepends on the subjective judgment of the clinician. With the development\nof artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more and more machine learning\nmethods are used to diagnose depression by appearance characteristics. Most\nof the previous research focused on the study of single-modal data; however,\nin recent years, many studies have shown that multi-modal data has better\nprediction performance than single-modal data. This study aimed to develop\na measurement of depression severity from expression and action features\nand to assess its validity among the patients with MDD.\nMethods: We proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms in real-time, which\nwas based on the detection of patients\u2019 facial expression and body movement\nfrom videos captured by ordinary cameras. We established behavioral\ndepression degree (BDD) metrics, which combines expression entropy and\naction entropy to measure the depression severity of MDD patients.\nResults: We found that the information extracted from different modes, when\nintegrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nof the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies. This\nmethod presented an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and self-\nrating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Hamilton\ndepression scale (HAMD). In addition, we tracked and evaluated the changes\nof BDD in patients at different stages of a course of treatment and the results\nobtained were in agreement with the evaluation from the scales.\nDiscussion: The BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients\u2019\ndepression and its changing trend according to the patient\u2019s expression and\naction features. Our model may provide an automatic auxiliary tool for the\ndiagnosis and treatment of MDD.\nKEYWORDS\nsmart medical, depression, behavioral entropy, deep learning, artificial intelligence"

            "text": "With a high prevalence, high recurrence rate, high disability rate, and high fatality rate, major depressive disorder (MDD) is becoming a leading issue in the global burden of disease (1). According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately 350 million people suffering from depression worldwide, and about one million people who commit suicide as a result of depression every year (2). According to the Global Burden of Disease Survey, depression has the largest weight in the burden of mental illness in terms of disability-adjusted life years, accounting for about 40.5% (3, 4). The latest epidemiological survey conducted in 31 provinces in China showed that the lifetime prevalence of depression is 6.8% (5). Depression severely affects quality of life (6) and brings heavy mental and economic burdens to the family structures and society as a whole.\nSo far, the cause of depression is ambiguous. It is only confirmed that depression is associated with biological, psychological, and social environmental factors. The clinical diagnosis of depression is mainly based on a doctor\u2019s interview combined with some psychological rating scales to make a comprehensive assessment. At present, however, there is an extreme shortage of mental health professionals in developing countries, such as China, resulting in poor access to professional\nmedical services for depression, a lack of timely assessment of symptoms, and greatly increased chances of depression relapse.\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) based on big data analysis brings promising advancements to doctors and patients. With the fourth industrial revolution initiated in the 21st century, AI has increasingly been utilized in the research of mental diseases (7). Machine learning models can provide an accurate prediction of the onset of depressive disorder for patients (8\u201314). The diagnostic model includes age measurement, a simplified mental state examination score, and structural imaging. The treatment response model includes measures of structural and functional connectivity.\nDeep representation features, such as body movements, gestures, eye movement, and periodic muscle movement, can be used for the biological analysis of depression. The analysis includes the recognition, judgment, tracking, and understanding of human behaviors (15\u201317). An individual can produce specific expressions through certain forms of muscle contraction, and these expressions can be used as a carrier of emotions, intentions, desires, and other information (18, 19). The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) uses these biological signals to identify depression and has achieved promising results (20\u201329). In this way, an AI-based solution to assess symptom severity may be utilized for the assessment and auxiliary diagnosis of patients with depression. By making individual and objective predictions on mental disorders, we can improve the accuracy of patient diagnosis and treatment decisions. The application of AI over the whole course of depression will profoundly affect the evaluation, prediction, and treatment of depression (30).\nMost of the previous AI models focus on single-modal information of a certain feature of the patient. In recent years, some studies have shown that multi-modal information has a better prediction performance than single-modal data (20, 31). In this paper, we proposed a multi-modal deep convolutional\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nneural network (CNN) model based on facial expressions and body movements to evaluate the severity of depression. The model included two modules: an expression recognition module to predict the probability of 7 facial expressions of patients, using expression entropy to represent the complexity of facial expressions, and a movement recognition module to locate the position of 18 body joints of the patient, using action entropy to represent the complexity of the body movement. According to the expression and movement features output by the model, a behavioral depression degree (BDD) was derived to quantify the severity of depression, which was used as the detection result of our model. Our results demonstrated an over 74% Pearson similarity between BDD and self-rating depression scale (SDS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), indicating that the BDD can effectively measure the current state of patients\u2019 depression and its changing trend according to the patient\u2019s expression and action features."

In order to obtain the continuous change process of the patient\u2019s facial expressions and movements, the patients with MDD who received any kinds of psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy were selected, and the entire process was recorded with 40\u201360 min of video recording in the symptoms assessment every week. Two patients were randomly selected for receiving systematic cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for seven sessions from the subject pool, and video data was collected during the whole process of psychotherapeutic interviews. Each psychological assessment was conducted in a fixed room, and psychotherapy was conducted in a quiet treatment room with soft lighting, to ensure undisturbed talks. During the psychological assessment, the camera targeted at the sitting subject\u2019s face and whole body. During the psychotherapy, the therapist and the subject seated at an angle of 90\u2013120\u25e6, and a camera lens targeted at the subject\u2019s face and whole body. We used the Shadow Giant portable 4K camera with 2560\u22171440/30fps resolution for recording, and all videos were saved as \u201cmov\u201d or \u201cmp4\u201d format in hard disk. The video data was processed by a computer server with Intel Xeon 3.20GHz CPU, 500G SSD, 2T HHD, 32GB RAM, and two GTX 1080Ti GPU.\nWe used behavioral entropy (BE) to describe the degree of discreteness in patients\u2019 facial expression and action features. We then established the behavioral depression degree (BDD) based on BE to represent the degree of depression we assessed."

The video data were preprocessed and fed into the expression and body recognition modules. The expression module includes face detection and facial expression recognition. We used open-source Python package DBFace1 for face detection. Then we constructed a deep convolution neural network (Table 1) and trained a facial expression recognition module using Facial Expression Recognition 2013 Dataset (Fer2013),2 which contains about 30,000 facial images, with each image labeled as one of the seven universal facial expressions\n1 https://github.com/dlunion/DBFace\n2 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013\n(32) (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral). In the action module we use the open-source Python package tf-poseestimation,3 which includes human body region recognition, adaptation layer, and pose estimation based on TensorFlow (33). The position of the 18 nodes of the human body is output by this module. Finally, our model outputs the BDD which represents the patient\u2019s behavioral depression degree."

At the same time, to prevent the model from overfitting, we added a dropout layer for discarding. The network architecture is shown in Table 1. We trained our CNN network using Fer2013 dataset and achieve 70.71% accuracy in the task of facial expression recognition, which exceeds the human accuracy of 65% (36). After using DBFace to detect the patient\u2019s face from the psychotherapeutic interviews video, we then used our trained model to estimate the patient\u2019s expression and obtained the probability of seven expressions of the patient\u2019s face in each frame of the video.\nFinally, we introduced the expression entropy through the following:\nH (X) = \u2212 7\u2211 1 p (xi) logp (xi) (1)\n3 https://github.com/tryagainconcepts/tf-pose-estimation\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 04 frontiersin.org\nH(X) is the expression entropy, xi is the i-th expression, and p(xi) is the probability of the i-th expression calculated by the facial expression recognition model. The expression entropy reflects the degree of discreteness of the patient\u2019s expression. A high value indicates that the patient\u2019s expression is rich and lively. On the contrary, a low value indicates that the patient\u2019s expression is relatively simple and the degree of depression is more serious (16, 37)."

The SDS index decreased by 28.6%. The SAS, as a selfrating scale, has a strong correlation with the SDS.

The HAMD total score of patient 1 dropped from 26 at the end of the first treatment to 9 at the end of the seventh treatment, a score of which belongs to mild depression.

The SAS total score of patient 2 decreased from 58 at baseline to 51 at the end of the seventh treatment, with a slight decrease of 12.1% compared with baseline, but still higher than the clinical threshold (>50). The HAMD total score of patient 2 decreased from 39 at baseline to 23 at the end of the seventh treatment which belongs to moderate depression. Compared with baseline, the HAMD index of patient 2 decreased by 41.0%.\nExpression features of the two selected patients\nFigure 3A shows the expression distribution of patient 1 and patient 2 during the second session of treatment. The larger the upper shadow area is, the better the emotional state is, while the lower shadow represents bad emotions. We can see that the proportion of sad and angry expressions is significantly higher than other expressions.\nAs shown in Figure 3B, throughout the entire 7 sessions of treatment, the proportion of sad and angry expressions of patient 1 is relatively high but gradually decreases, and the emotional state of the patient has been significantly improved as the treatment progressed. Meanwhile, patient 2\u2019s sad expression accounts for a larger proportion in the entire psychotherapy. Throughout the process of the treatments, the proportion of sadness gradually decreases, which reveals that the emotional state of patient 2 has been improved to a certain extent.\nAction features of the two selected patients\nAs shown in Figure 4A, we compare the amplitude of the two patients\u2019 limbs in the second session during the treatment process. 0\u201317 represents nose, neck, right shoulder, right elbow, right wrist, left shoulder, left elbow, left wrist, right hip, right knee, right ankle, left hip, left knee, left ankle, right eye, left eye, right ear, and left ear. The average amplitude of each joint in patient 1 is 0.0084, and that of patient 2 is 0.0042. Additionally, the joint motion range of patient 2 is significantly lower than that of patient 1. As for the empty joints in the picture (such as patient 2\u2019s right ankle and left ankle), the camera failed to capture the corresponding picture due to the motion of the subject.\nFigure 4B shows the motion amplitude changes of each limb node during the entire treatment process of the two patients. Patient 1\u2019s motion amplitude at all key points is small except for the 7th treatment, which is consistent with the correlation between the severity of depressive symptoms and the decreased motion in previous studies. The motion amplitude of patient 2 remained stable during the entire course of psychotherapy, without obvious peaks and valleys. Patient 2\u2019s motion amplitude is generally smaller, which is consistent with its low expression entropy and high frequency of sad expressions.\nPearson correlation between BDD output and total scores of SDS, SAS, and HAMD of the two selected patients\nFigure 5 shows the Pearson similarity between BDD output from the model and clinically validated SDS, SAS, and HAMD\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nscores, respectively. We adjust the proportion of expression entropy and action entropy in BDD by adjusting the parameter \u03bb. In all tested cases, we found that when \u03bb is 0.94, the mean Pearson similarity between BDD and each variate can reach more than 74%. This reveals the validity of our measurement model.\nWhen \u03bb is 0.94, we can calculate the BDD of patient 1 and patient 2 separately. As shown in Figure 2B, the BDD of patient 1 decreases continuously from 0.35 at baseline to 0.23 at the end of treatment, with a decrease of 34.3%. The overall trend is consistent with each clinically validated variate of patient 1. The BDD of patient 2 decreases from 0.47 at baseline to 0.35 at the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nend of treatment. After the 7th treatment, the BDD of patient 2 decreased by 25.5% due to the loss of suicidal thoughts. The overall trend is consistent with each clinically validated variate of patient 2. In addition, the BDD of patient 2 is lower than that of patient 1 because the depression severity of patient 2 is much more serious than that of patient 1. The trend in BDD of patient 1 and patient 2 is positively correlated with their clinically validated index of patient 1 and patient 2, with 74% Pearson similarity."

            "text": "Previous AI detection models usually focus on a patient\u2019s biological signals, such as blood pressure, pulse, EEG, and other physiological and biochemical information (41), or only consider unimodal appearance information such as facial expression (42, 43). In this manuscript, we proposed a multimodal deep convolution neural network to detect the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\nseverity of depression. Compared to an existing multimodal model (20, 31), our model has the following improvements: (i) we integrated facial expression information that is an important feature in evaluating the severity of depression; (ii) we constructed the BDD metrics to quantify the severity of depression and achieved a good performance; (iii) we found that the information extracted from different modes, when integrated in appropriate proportions, can significantly improve the accuracy of the evaluation, which has not been reported in previous studies.\nWe developed the BDD to measure the severity of depression symptoms in patients with MDD based on their facial expression and body movement, and analyzed the changes. Our study showed that the BDD is consistent with the SDS, SAS, and HAMD scores of patients with a 74% Pearson similarity. Through the progress of treatment, patients\u2019 BDD decreased to various degrees after psychotherapy. This indicated that overall depression in the patients has been improved to a certain extent after treatment.\nAlthough both the BDD and the patients\u2019 symptoms showed that patients\u2019 depressive symptoms were improved, the analysis showed that the probability of the patients\u2019 sad expression was still significantly higher than other six expressions. This might be because it takes longer for the facial expression of depression to improve than the inner experience of depression. It might also\nFIGURE 5 The Pearson similarity of the proposed model.\nbe due to the complex etiology and pathogenesis of depressive disorder, such as genetics, personality, cognitive type, early life environment, social environment, and other factors, resulting in the \u201csusceptibility\u201d of some individuals to depression being higher than others (44).\nMeanwhile, there is a link between the severity of depressive symptoms and facial expressions. The more severe\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 09 frontiersin.org\nthe symptoms are, the more sad the expression is and the less the patient smiled (37). With the improvement of a depressed mood, depressed expression, and body motion range of patients can be improved accordingly (45). Facial expressions are the immediate manifestation of personal emotions. For patients with depression, a low mood and single facial expression are the primary symptoms. Anxiety,\nanger, pain, and other emotions caused by pressure are expressed through facial expressions (46), resulting in the facial expression as the major feature for the assessment of depression conditions.\nWe determined the proportion of facial expression and body movement in BDD in two patients, and found that when \u03bb was 0.94, BDD effectively matched the patients\u2019 scale trends,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\nhaving a Pearson similarity exceeding 74% with the SDS, SAS, and HAMD scores. It is proposed that the BDD can effectively reflect the changes in a patient\u2019s depressive condition, which shows a high degree of consistency with the trend of their psychological scale. At the same time, we verified that BDD could effectively fit the trend of SDS, SAS, and HAMD in all 164 patients. This demonstrated the validity of the fitting model in assessing depression conditions. In the process of information communication between people, facial expressions can convey 55% of the information while 38% of the information comes from pronunciation, intonation, and speech rhythm, and only 7% of the information comes from language content itself (47). This explains why our model has a large proportion of expression entropy.\nIn the future, research on the changes of facial expressions and motion amplitude of patients in the process of psychological treatment of depression based on deep learning algorithms can lay the foundation for the intelligent evaluation and monitoring of different kinds of treatment for patients dealing with depression."

            "text": "In conclusion, we presented a multi-modal deep learning method which combines expression and action features. The BDD proposed in this paper has demonstrated a beneficial function in effectively assessing the depression severity of MDD patients through the observation of their facial expressions and body movements.\nThis technique has significant applications in mental health treatments. It can monitor the symptoms of depression patients during psychotherapy and accurately assess the interaction between patients and therapists. At the same time, based on the patient\u2019s psychological assessment, facial features, action features, and other data, we can develop a reliable deep learning evaluation model to train and process the patient\u2019s multidimensional data, and evaluate the psychological changes of MDD patients accurately in real-time to guide the treatment. In addition, this study provides a new paradigm to research on depression and effectively solves the shortage of medical resources faced by patients with mental illness.\nAlthough the model proposed in this paper has demonstrated its effectiveness in depression detection, there are still some limitations in the algorithm. Firstly, the accuracy of expression recognition and pose estimation needs to be further improved. For example, in future work, the 2D pose estimation algorithm can be replaced by 3D algorithms. Secondly, our multimodal model only includes two features: facial expressions and body movements. More features, such as voice tone, eye changes, and micro movements of patients can be considered in the future work. We hope this work will inspire others to build AI-based tools for understanding mental health disorders even beyond depression."
