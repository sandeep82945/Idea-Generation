    "abstractText": "This paper presents a generalized registration form for systematic reviews that can be used when currently available forms are not adequate. The form is designed to be applicable across disciplines (i.e., psychology, economics, law, physics, or any other field) and across review types (i.e., scoping review, review of qualitative studies, meta\u2010analysis, or any other type of review). That means that the reviewed records may include research reports as well as archive documents, case law, books, poems, etc. Items were selected and formulated to optimize broad applicability instead of specificity, forgoing some benefits afforded by a tighter focus. This PRISMA 2020 compliant form is a fallback for more specialized forms and can be used if no specialized form or registration platform is available. When accessing this form on the Open Science Framework website, users will therefore first be guided to specialized forms when they exist. In addition to this use case, the form can also serve as a starting point for creating registration forms that cater to specific fields or review types.",

            "text": "Systematic reviews are systematic in the sense that they involve a systematic process to transparently, reproducibly, and often exhaustively identify and synthesize the literature on a given research topic. Even though objectivity is desirable for systematic reviews, the process is not immune to bias. Systematic reviewers are well aware of this, and many initiatives have been undertaken to identify and prevent biases. In 2011, a registry of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) was created to help researchers prospectively register health-related systematic review protocols [1]. This registry was an important step in making the systematic review process more transparent as it facilitated documentation of the process and justifications for deviations from the protocol. The registry also allowed third parties to check the extent to which completed systematic reviews (as presented in journal articles) are carried out in line with the protocol, making it easier to identify decisions that may have introduced bias (e.g., a change in the criteria for study inclusion or the omission of an analysis without a valid rationale). Finally, PROSPERO allows researchers to check whether similar endeavors are underway prior to engaging in a systematic review, facilitating collaboration and synergy. In all, PROSPERO makes the systematic review process more transparent, and makes it feasible to identify and address biases so that they are less likely to influence the results of systematic reviews.\nWhen registering a systematic review in the PROSPERO registry, researchers are presented with a registration form that they can use to specify their protocol (see Appendix\u00a01 for the PROSPERO registration form). However, this form is optimized for health-related systematic reviews (either in humans or in animals). This serves PROSPERO\u2019s goal well but is necessarily exclusive to other systematic reviews. Specifically, PROSPERO directly excludes all systematic reviews without health outcomes, systematic reviews that are noninterventional, scoping reviews, evidence maps, and qualitative systematic reviews. PROSPERO\u2019s focus on health-related reviews also manifests itself through the items included in the registration form. For example, the form prompts specification of the \u201cdisease, condition or healthcare domain being studied\u201d, and the form assumes that some kind of intervention will take place, including mandatory fields where the intervention(s)/ exposure(s) and the comparator(s)/control are specified, even though much research does not involve interventions.\nTo enable researchers to register systematic reviews for which PROSPERO is not suitable, we developed a generalized form for registering systematic reviews that is designed to be applicable across disciplines (i.e., psychology, economics, law, physics, or any other field) and across review types (i.e., scoping review, review of qualitative studies, meta-analysis, or any other type of review). This means that the reviewed records may include research reports as well as archive documents, case law, books, poems, etc. Therefore, our selection of items and formulation of each item were optimized for broad applicability instead of specificity. Such generic formulation means some benefits afforded by a tighter focus (e.g., on a given method) may have been forgone. This form, therefore, is well suited as a fallback for more specialized forms and can be used if no specialized form or registration platform is available. When accessing this form on the Open Science Framework website [2] users will therefore first be guided to specialized forms when they exist.\u00a0 If such a specialized form does not exist, we encourage users to reflect on whether this generalized form suits their needs, or whether it would be better to adapt the form into a form that better caters to the user\u2019s specific\u00a0 field or review type.\u00a0 As such, this generalized form can also function\u00a0as a starting point for creating new registration forms.\u00a0\nTo select items for this form, we assessed the items of several reporting guidelines and guides, most notably the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. PRISMA was published to help researchers create reproducible reports of their systematic reviews, and with that alleviate biases in the reporting phase of systematic reviews ([3, 4], for an updated version see [5]). Inspired by PRISMA, additional reporting guidelines have been developed for specific disciplines (e.g., ROSES is tailored to systematic reviews in environmental research, and MOOSE is tailored to systematic reviews in epidemiology) and specific types of reviews (e.g., PRISMA-IPD is tailored to systematic reviews of individual participant data, and PRISMA-DTA is tailored to systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy). Where the Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form is optimized for accurate and comprehensive a priori documentation of systematic review procedures, reporting guidelines were optimized for application after completion of a systematic review. Because of these different end goals, reporting guidelines like PRISMA lack detail with respect to decisions that are important regarding the planning of a systematic review.\nIn contrast, this form includes several decisions that are important to transparently document before data collection for the systematic review begins. At the same time, some PRISMA items can only be filled out once a systematic review is finished.\nNonetheless, there is also considerable overlap: these reporting guidelines do partly capture the same information as registration forms. Therefore, for each item in this form, we specified the corresponding PRISMA item (PRISMA items P1-P22 and P25-27 were applicable; P16-P23 cover reporting of results and P24 refers to registration forms like this). Researchers planning to use a specific reporting standard to report the results of their review, should enter the information required by that reporting standard in the corresponding (overarching) fields of this form.\nThe Generalized Systematic Review Registration Form is the result of a collaborative effort of several groups of researchers that independently identified the need for a systematic review registration form that is not restricted to a specific context. These groups initially started to build such forms based on their own research needs but when they learnt about each other\u2019s initiatives through Twitter and academic conferences they decided to combine resources and create this form. These existing resources were the PRISMA statement outlined above, a preregistration template specifically designed for non-interventional research [6], a registration form drafted at the conference of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science in 2018, and a registration form drafted for systematic reviews in animal research. We included all items that overlapped between two or more resources in the new form. For the remaining items, we decided collectively through Zoom-meetings and e-mail discussions whether and how to include them. In the final stage, the form was presented to experts in the scientific community to solicit feedback to improve generalizability and usability even more [7]. Based on this feedback, the template was polished into its current state."

            "heading": "Instructions",
            "text": "To align with general use and open science best practices, when you fill out the form on the Open Science Framework, all items are mandatory. Being as comprehensive as possible makes your registration more useful for readers, funders, yourself, and others, so check carefully whether\nyou did not accidently omit an item. If an item asks about a procedure you do not plan to use or is not applicable, indicate that in the corresponding field (including, ideally, the underlying reason).\nYou should be transparent about any deviations from the preregistration and provide the rationale for these deviations in your final review. If you already foresee some deviations when filling out the form (e.g., you anticipate that you will not have enough studies in a moderator group), provide a contingency plan for these deviations in the relevant parts of the registration. In addition, we recommend publishing updated registrations, allowing you to document and justify your decisions along the way in the same uniform format.\nThe aim of this registration form is to be optimally inclusive (i.e., to be usable for registration of any systematic review, regardless of scientific discipline or review type). This inclusivity is also signified by the fact that this form has been used for published papers involving scoping reviews, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and meta-analyses from areas as diverse as psychology, political science, and biomedicine [8\u201312]. Moreover, since it was made public on the Open Science Framework (10 April 2023), the form has already been used 68 times as per 2 May 2023, which amounts to more than 20 completed registrations per week. Readers can see how the template is being used in research on the OSF Registry [13]. Given that the form is relatively new and awareness of the form is expected to grow, we expect this average to increase more in later months and years.\nBecause this aim precludes 1:1 correspondence with the existing reporting guidelines,\u00a0 we want to emphasize that\u00a0this form is also intended as a basis to develop more specialized forms that do correspond closely to more specific reporting guidelines. Such specialized forms can include, for example, additional fields, added comments, and worked examples. This form is included in the preregr R package [14], and the underlying preregr form specification [15, 16]\u00a0 can be used to develop adapted versions of this form\u00a0 (e.g., [17]). Note that preregr can also be used to produce an R Markdown template containing this form presented in this paper, including the item labels and descriptions using the command \u201cpreregr::form_to_rmd_template( 'genSysRev_v1' , file = 'C:/path/to/file.Rmd');\u201d.\nThe registration form is presented below. The items of the form are denoted by GSRRF, while the corresponding items from the PRISMA checklist are denoted by PRISMA."

Note that all analyses pertaining to primary research questions should normally be reported in the final report. PRISMA: 4.\n[GSRRF-12] Secondary research question(s): List additional research questions that you will examine, but that took less central roles in informing the review\u2019s design. Note that all analyses pertaining to secondary research questions should normally be reported in the final report.

These can pertain to your research questions, the types of sources you will find, social and political contexts, and contextual information that you know may color your interpretations and decisions (common for qualitative approaches). PRISMA: 3\n[GSRRF-14] Dependent variable(s) / outcome(s) / main variables: List the dependent / outcome / main variables you are interested in. If this review concerns one or more associations, list the outcome variable(s) or dependent variables.

If there are no conflicts of interest, please state this as such. PRISMA: 26.\n[GSRRF-20] Overlapping authorships: Declare whether you expect that anyone involved in this review is a co-author of one of the studies that will likely be included in the review (based on your search strategy) and, if so, how you will address potential bias (i.e., that reviewer is not involved in screening, data extraction, quality assessment, or synthesis of that study). If you are confident that this does not represent a conflict of interest, explain why you think so. PRISMA: 26."

PRISMA: 8.\n[GSRRF-34] Screened fields / blinding: Describe which bibliographic fields (e.g., title, abstract, authors) are visible during the screening, and which fields are blinded. For example, journal names, authors, and publication years can be hidden from screeners in an effort to minimize bias. PRISMA: 8.\n[GSRRF-35] Used exclusion criteria: List the specific exclusion criteria that you apply in your screening to eliminate sources from the set of sources identified in your search.

Synthesis and Quality Assessment In this section, you register the procedure for the review\u2019s synthesis: the procedure you designed to use the data that was extracted from each source to answer your research question(s). This often includes transforming the raw extracted data, verifying validity, applying predefined inference criteria, interpreting results, and presenting results. Additionally, you register procedures you designed to assess bias in individual sources and the synthesis itself.\n[GSRRF-52] Planned data transformations: Describe your plans for transforming the raw extracted data. This may include converting effect sizes to other metrics (e.g., convert all metrics to Pearson correlation coefficients); recoding or (re)categorizing extracted qualitative data fragments (e.g., coding extracted music genres within an existing taxonomy); and aggregating extracted data prior to the main synthesis procedures (e.g., compute the mean of a variable over all samples in one source). Applying these transformations to the raw extracted entities from the Extraction section should yield data that corresponds to the variables of interest listed in the Review Methods section. PRISMA: 13b.\n[GSRRF-53] Missing data: Describe how you will deal with missing data (i.e., cases where it is not possible to extract one or more entities from the source material, and your efforts to obtain the missing information, for example by contacting the authors, are not fruitful). PRISMA: 10b.\n[GSRRF-54] Data validation: Describe your process of ensuring that the data are correct and useful (e.g., identifying outliers, identifying retractions, or triangulating with other sources). Also describe your criteria for assessing data validity and how you will deal with data violating those criteria. PRISMA: 10b.\n[GSRRF-55] Quality assessment: Describe the analyses you plan to do to assess and weigh the quality of the included sources with respect to your research question(s). Examples of tools to use for quality evaluation are Cochr ane\u2019s Risk of Bias 2 tool, GRADE, and GRADE- CERQu al. PRISMA: 11.\n[GSRRF-56] Synthesis plan: Describe the specific procedure you will apply to arrive at an answer to the research question(s). For example, in meta-analyses this is the full analysis plan, including any planned subgroup analyses and moderator analyses, the (multilevel) model specification, and preferably the analysis code. For a qualitative review, it is the procedure you plan to use to collate your results into a coherent picture. If you distinguish synthesis tiers (e.g., primary and secondary analysis, or confirmatory and exploratory analyses), list them and indicate which procedures you plan to use for each. Also specify what you will do if parts of the plan can\u2019t be properly executed. PRISMA: 13c, 13d, and 13e.\n[GSRRF-57] Criteria for conclusions / inference criteria: If you plan to draw your conclusions based on pre-specified criteria (e.g., a minimal effect size of interest, a signifi-\ncance level, or a saturation point), list these here. PRISMA: 20b.\n[GSRRF-58] Synthesist blinding: Describe the procedure, if any, used to blind synthesists (i.e., the persons synthesizing the extracted data to arrive at answers to your research question(s)) from the research questions, hypotheses, and/or specific roles of each extracted entity/variable in this review. For example, for meta-analyses, an analyst external to the main research team can be engaged to perform the analyses without knowing the study\u2019s hypotheses. For qualitative reviews, for the synthesis, other researchers can be involved who are unaware of and are not informed about the research process and expectations.

For an overview of commonly used publica-\ntion bias correction methods, see Table\u00a01 in Van Aert, Wicherts, & Van Assen (2019) PRISMA: 14.\n[GSRRF-62] Sensitivity analyses / robustness checks: Describe the sensitivity analyses or robustness checks you plan to conduct (if any). PRISMA: 13f and 15.\n[GSRRF-63] Synthesis procedure justification: Extraction procedures are sometimes compromises, balancing pragmatic considerations with scientific rigour. Here, describe the justifications for your decisions about your planned transformations (e.g., if based on assumptions, how do you know those are feasible), your data integrity and missing data checks and corrections, your synthesis plan, the criteria you chose to drive your conclusions/inferences (if any), and your procedures for blinding, and reliability assurance/reconciliation if you use multiple synthesists. PRISMA: 13d.\n[GSRRF-64] Synthesis data management and sharing: Describe whether and how you will share the files with the analysis scripts, notes, and outputs. List both the file format (e.g., R scripts, Rmarkdown files, plain text files, Open Document files), the repository, and any potential embargos or conditions for access.

The preferred format includes details of both inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nFor reviews of qualitative studies give details of the focus of the review.\nExample: Population-level tobacco control interventions are defined as those applied to populations, groups, areas, jurisdictions or institutions with the aim of changing the social, physical, economic or legislative environment to make them less conducive to smoking. These are approaches that mainly rely on state or institutional control, either of a link in the supply chain or of smokers\u2019 behaviour in the presence of others.\nExamples include tobacco crop substitution or diversification, removing subsidies on tobacco production, restricting trade in tobacco products, measures to prevent smuggling, measures to reduce illicit cross-border shopping, restricting advertising of tobacco products, restrictions on selling tobacco products to minors, mandatory health warning labels on tobacco products, increasing the price of tobacco products, restricting access to cigarette vending machines, restricting smoking in the workplace, and restricting smoking in public places. Such approaches could also form part of wider, multifaceted interventions in schools, workplaces or communities.3"
