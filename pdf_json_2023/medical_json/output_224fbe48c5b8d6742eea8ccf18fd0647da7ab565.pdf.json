    "abstractText": "The phage T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) and lysozyme form the basis of the widely used pET expression system for recombinant expression in the biotechnology field and as a tool in microbial synthetic biology. Attempts to transfer this genetic circuitry from Escherichia coli to non-model bacterial organisms with high potential have been restricted by the cytotoxicity of the T7 RNAP in the receiving hosts. We here explore the diversity of T7-like RNAPs mined directly from Pseudomonas phages for implementation in Pseudomonas species, thus relying on the co-evolution and natural adaptation of the system towards its host. By screening and characterizing different viral transcription machinery using a vector-based system in P. putida., we identified a set of four non-toxic phage RNAPs from phages phi15, PPPL-1, Pf-10, and 67PfluR64PP, showing a broad activity range and orthogonality to each other and the T7 RNAP. In addition, we confirmed the transcription start sites of their predicted promoters and improved the stringency of the phage RNAP expression systems by introducing and optimizing phage lysozymes for RNAP inhibition. This set of viral RNAPs expands the adaption of T7-inspired circuitry towards Pseudomonas species and highlights the potential of mining tailored genetic parts and tools from phages for their non-model host.",

            "text": "Due to their long-standing co-evolution, bacteriophage genomes encode unique biological parts and cell modulators that are integrally adapted to their host, including viral RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and orthogonal promoters [1]. The main example hereof is the transcriptional machinery of coliphage T7. Since its discovery over 30 years ago, the T7 transcription elements have become indispensable for both high-yield protein production in Escherichia coli and the construction of complex Synthetic Biology (SynBio) circuitry [2,3]. The transcriptional machinery of T7, including its small, single subunit, RNAP, 17 bp promoter (PT7), and specific T7 lysozyme, has since been commercialized by Novagen (Merck Group, Darmstadt, Germany) as the well-known pET system. The pET system consists of three modules and can be induced with isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which drives the expression of the T7 RNAP by the LacI expression system (Figure 1). Next, the T7 RNAP transcribes any gene of interest from PT7 to extremely high levels, resulting in a high (recombinant) protein yield. Due to the strong activity of the T7 RNAP, strict regulation of this system is required to avoid the unwanted expression of the gene of interest in pre-production cultures. The presence of the T7 lysozyme supports this regulation, as it inhibits the T7 RNAP when expressed in low basal amounts prior to IPTG induction.\nInt. J. Mol.

Second, the modular structure of the T7 RNAP allows the splitting of\nthe T7 RNAP gene into two parts to create AND and OR gates in synthetic circuits [6\u201310].\nIn addition, the separate T7 RNAP modules can be fused to other enzymes, such as\ndeaminases, to enable base-editing of a target sequence [11].

In the past decade, several bacterial species beyond E. coli have emerged as valuable hosts for biotechnological and SynBio applications.

As a result, the pET system is rarely used in P. putida, and researchers instead rely on the established XylS/Pm and RhaRS/PrhaBAD expression systems for protein production. These expression systems are generally well-regulated and characterized in P. putida but lack the extremely high transcription levels enabled by the T7 RNAP. In this work, we characterize four alternative RNAPs from Pseudomonas phages that exhibit a broad range of expression levels, do not show any toxicity to their host, and operate orthogonally to each other and the T7 RNAP. Efficient expression of these RNAPs was achieved using the XylS/Pm system, and tight regulation was improved by introducing the corresponding phage lysozymes."

            "text": "First, the four phage RNAPs were screened for low cytotoxicity in P. putida and P. aeruginosa, compared to the T7 reference model. As the Pseudomonas phages co-evolved with their host, we hypothesized that their early-expressed RNAP should have primed efficient production of viral particles and not trigger the host\u2019s toxicity. To confirm this hypothesis, the RNAP from our selected Pseudomonas phages, Pf-10, phi15, PPPL-1, and 67PfluR64PP, were cloned into pSTDesX, introduced in either P. putida or P. aeruginosa and induced with 1 mM 3mBz (3-methylbenzoate) from the XylS/Pm expression system. This expression system is considered the golden standard for P. putida and has successfully driven T7 RNAP expression in previous research to circumvent LacI-related regulatory issues in Pseudomonas [5,17]. As anticipated, the T7-like RNAPs did not significantly reduce the final OD600 of the host after 12 h of induction, with the exception of some limited growth reduction induced by the expression of the 67PfluR64PP RNAP in P. aeruginosa (Tukey HSD, p < 0.001) (Figure 3a). By contrast, the T7 RNAP caused a significant growth stop and growth retardation in both species, as anticipated (Tukey HSD, p < 0.0001) (Figures 3a and S3a). It should be noted that to include the T7 RNAP as a positive control in further assays, its inducer concentration should be reduced from 1 mM to 0.3 mM 3mBz in subsequent experiments to limit the toxic effect. Next, the transcriptional activity of the RNAPs was assessed indirectly by measuring the level of the msfGFP (monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein) fluorescence from a phage promoter-msfGFP reporter construct. The predicted phage promoters and 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) from the phages\u2019 major capsid protein (MCP) are shown in Figure 2b and were cloned upstream of the msfGFP gene in the pBGDes. The reporter construct in the pBGDes was genomically integrated as a single copy in the host\u2019s Tn7 attB site to limit noise from the copy number differences. These reporter constructs were first tested individually in the host in the absence of the phage RNAPs to confirm whether the phage promoters are not recognized by the host RNAP, which would be indicated by a lack of msfGFP expression (Figure 3b). In both P. putida and P. aeruginosa, no significant gene expression was observed from any of the phage promoters by the host RNAP, except for the T7 promoter. This result suggests that the T7 promoter can be recognized by the host RNAP (albeit very weakly) and is therefore not fully orthogonal to the host RNAP in Pseudomonas, contrary to previous assumptions [17]. Next, all of the phage RNAPs were introduced in the corresponding reporter strains, and msfGFP expression was monitored for 12 h in the absence and presence of 0.3 mM of a 3mBz inducer. All of the tested phage RNAPs displayed significant transcriptional activity in P. putida after 12 h of induction (pairwise Wilcoxon, p < 0.001), whereas only T7, phi15, and PPPL-1 RNAP produced significant msfGFPs in P. aeruginosa (pairwise Student\u2019s t-test, p < 0.05 (T7, phi15) and p > 0.05 (PPPL-1); individual Student\u2019s t-tests for PPPL-1 vs. NC, p < 0.05) (Figure 3c). The reason for the apparent inactivity of Pf-10 and 67PfluR64PP RNAP in P. aeruginosa is unclear but could be due to improper expression of these RNAPs in this species, as the RNAP genes were not codon-optimized to the respective hosts. In the current setup, the T7 RNAP generated the highest msfGFP production per cell of 1185 nM and 1972 nM 5(6)-FAM/OD600 in P. putida and P. aeruginosa after 12 h of induction, followed by 543 nM and 512 nM 5(6)-FAM/OD600 for phi15 RNAP, respectively. In P. putida, the phage RNAPs of PPPL-1, Pf-10, and 67PfluR64PP showed reduced expression levels. Taken together, these less-active enzymes provide an RNAP library together with T7 and phi15 RNAP, covering a broad range of transcriptional expression. In this regard, it should be noted that while the transcriptional activity of T7 RNAP remained highest in this experiment, its cytotoxicity and the difficulty this brings for cloning, handling, and expressing the T7 RNAP in Pseudomonas should be considered.

T7-like Phage Lysozymes Inhibit Transcriptional Activity of Their Corresponding\nPhage RNAP\nDue to the strong transcriptional activity of T7-like phage RNAPs, a limited\nproduction of the phage RNAP can rapidly lead to significant expression levels of the\nreporter gene in uninduced conditions. This observation can also be made for the\nuninduced P. putida samples from the previous assay, where all strains except the\n67PfluR64PP RNAP produced msfGFP in significantly higher concentrations compared to\nthe negative control (Tukey HSD, p < 0.05) (Figure 3c). The highest levels of leaky\nexpression in P. putida are observed for phi15 (160 5(6)-FAM/OD600) and T7 (120 5(6)-\nFAM/OD600). This leaky msfGFP expression is likely caused by the low basal expression\nof the phage RNAP from the XylS/Pm expression system [18]. To limit this leaky\nexpression, the corresponding phage lysozyme can be added to the system to inhibit the\nphage RNAP and therefore decrease the transcription of the reporter gene, analogous to\nprevious work [3,31]. As indicated in Figure 2, the genomes of phi15, PPPL-1, Pf-10, and\n67PfluR64PP all encode an early-expressed lysozyme with high similarity to the T7\nlysozyme. This lysozyme could potentially inhibit the corresponding phage RNAP but\ncould also exhibit cytotoxicity due to their intrinsic amidase activity, as shown by the\noverexpression of the T7 lysozyme [3]. Therefore, all of the lysozymes were cloned into\npSTDesR with the RhaRS/PrhaBAD expression system, introduced into P. putida KT2440 and\nP. aeruginosa PAO1, induced with 10 mM Rha (rhamnose), and screened for the host\u2019s\ntoxicity. Interestingly, all of the phage lysozymes significantly reduced the cell growth of\nP. aeruginosa (Tukey HSD, p < 0.01), while in P. putida, no significant toxicity was observed\nfrom the expression of the phi15, PPPL-1, and Pf-10 lysozymes after induction (Tukey\nHSD, p > 0.1) (Figure 6a). This is in contrast to the moderate toxicity observed by the T7\nand 67PfluR64PP lysozymes, respectively (Tukey HSD, p < 0.01) (Figure 6a).

            "text": "The viral RNAP from phage phi15 resulted in high expression levels in P. putida and P. aeruginosa (Figure 3) but also exhibited significant leakiness, even in the presence of the phi15 lysozyme (Figure 6b). In an attempt to further reduce the leaky expression, the rhamnose concentration was increased up to 100 mM in P. putida, to no avail (Figure S7). As shown for the T7 system, the lysozyme inhibitory action stems from its N-terminal tail, with which it binds to the phage RNAP and causes allosteric inhibition of this enzyme [23,32,33]. Changes in the N-terminal tail sequence can, therefore, result in either weaker or stronger binding of the RNAP, which can, in turn, influence the inhibitory activity. The five studied phage lysozymes in this work show a range of inhibitory performances and encode distinct N-terminal regions (Figure S8). Therefore, we paired the lysozymes of T7, phi15, PPPL-1, Pf-10, and 67PfluR64PP with the phi15 RNAP and Pphi15-msfGFP reporter construct to test whether these lysozymes also have different abilities to bind and inhibit the phi15 RNAP. The resulting P. putida strains were induced with 4 mM rhamnose to express the lysozyme, after which the msfGFP output was measured for 12 h (Figure 7a). Despite a significant growth reduction caused by the 67PfluR64PP and Pf-10 lysozymes upon induction, similar to the previous assay, these lysozymes showed a remarked reduction in the leakiness caused by the phi15 RNAP. The 67PfluR64PP lysozyme reduced the leaky expression by \u221258%. Interestingly, the Pf-10 lysozyme even significantly outperformed the phi15 lysozyme with an \u221284% decrease in the msfGFP output (Tukey HSD, p < 0.0001). To verify that this striking result was due to the unique N-terminal region of the Pf-10 lysozyme and not to any other amino acid differences between the sequences of the Pf-10 and phi15 lysozymes (or even due to the slight toxicity of the Pf-10 lysozyme), a phi15 lysozyme mutant was engineered in which the first nine N-terminal amino acids were substituted for the first ten amino acids of the Pf-10 lysozyme while maintaining the other 145 amino acids of the phi15 lysozyme. The resulting P. putida strain with the phi15 RNAP, reporter construct, and phi15 lysozyme (AA1-9 > Pf-10(AA1-10)) showed no reduction in cell growth and generated a fluorescent output that was nearly identical to the sample with the Pf-10 lysozyme when induced with 5 mM rhamnose (Tukey HSD, p > 0.05) (Figure 7b). This confirms the determining role of the N-terminal region on RNAP inhibition and strongly suggests that the N-terminal region of the Pf-10 lysozyme allows a stronger binding interaction with the phi15 RNAP than the phi15 lysozyme. To pinpoint the exact amino acids causing the increased inhibitory activity, five additional phi15 lysozyme mutants were created and introduced in P. putida with the phi15 RNAP and reporter construct: phi15 lysozyme (G3R), (G3Q), (G3RQ), (K5Q), and (K7N,E8K). Except for the G3Q mutant (p < 0.01), none of the mutants had a significant impact on cell growth.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7175 10 of 18Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of"

This is a significant improvement compared to the 122 nM 5(6)-FAM/OD600 observed for the wild-type phi15 lysozyme. Moreover, the results of the G3RQ mutant even outperformed those of the phi15 lysozyme (AA1-9 > Pf-10(AA1-10) (23 nM 5(6)-FAM/OD600) (Tukey HSD, p < 0.05). To confirm that this mutant functions in other Pseudomonads, the experimental setup was also analyzed in P. aeruginosa. In this host, the (G3RQ) mutant considerably reduced the leaky expression from the phi15 RNAP to 29 5(6)-FAM/OD600 upon induction with 5 mM rhamnose, a remarkable 13-fold lower compared to the wild-type phi15 lysozyme (one-sided Student\u2019s t-test, p < 0.01) (Figure 7c). The results also indicate that the third position in the amino acid sequence plays an important role in RNAP inhibition and that a charged amino acid (R,Q) is preferred over the small glycine residue in the phi15 lysozyme sequence to create a strong interaction with the phi15 RNAP. These results correspond to previous work where point mutations in the N-terminal region of the T7 lysozyme caused a lack of RNAP inhibition, thus showing that even single point mutations can significantly impact the lysozyme\u2013RNAP interaction [32]. Lastly, it can be noted that there are also large differences in the msfGFP output between the strains in the uninduced condition (Figure 7b), which could be attributed to the minor leaky expression of the lysozymes from the RhaRS/prhaBAD system [18,34]. Overall, these results suggest that the other phage lysozymes could also be optimized for reduced toxicity and increased RNAP inhibition in a similar manner to enable tightlycontrolled expression systems for SynBio applications."

In addition, these RNAPs displayed a broad range of transcriptional activity, a high level of orthogonality towards each other, and orthogonality to the host RNAP. This is in contrast to minor T7 promoter recognition that was observed for the host machinery. Two of the phage RNAPs, phi15 and PPPL-1 RNAP, also showed significant activity in P. aeruginosa, while no transcriptional activity was observed from the Pf-10 and 67PfluR64PP RNAPs in this host. The reason for this inactivity remains unclear but could potentially be due to improper expression of the RNAP genes, as they were not codon-optimized to the host. Although the T7-like RNAPs did not display the same extremely high transcriptional activity as the T7 RNAP control, we argue that this should not be considered a disadvantage. Their non-toxicity, full host orthogonality, and more balanced activity allow easier cloning and flexibility toward different experimental setups compared to their T7 counterpart [14,15]. Furthermore, this mini orthogonal RNAP library enables considered selection of an RNAP for a specific application, in which phi15 and PPPL-1 RNAP are more suited towards applications that require high-yield of the gene of interest, while Pf-10 and 67PluR64PP RNAP enable more tightly-regulated and balanced expression of toxic intermediates or end products. For example, high amounts of the fluorinase enzyme are required for in vivo biofluorination with P. putida [36], whereas overexpression of the glycolate oxidase enzyme in P. putida allows efficient ethylene glycol conversion into polyhydroxyalkanoates [37]. On the other hand, tight expression control is preferred for endolysin expression for the controlled cell lysis of putida [38] and the study of toxic phage proteins in P. aeruginosa [39]. Furthermore, the orthogonal RNAP library allows the creation of various AND gates, OR gates, and resource allocators [6,8]. Due to the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7175 13 of 18\nmodularity of the T7-like RNAPs, these enzymes can be split into an enzymatic module and a promoter-recognition module. An AND gate is created by placing the two modules under the control of different inducible promoters and the desired output under the phage promoter, which only yields the output when both inducers are present. In addition, the enzymatic module of one RNAP can be paired with the promoter-recognition module of other phage RNAPs, thus enabling the creation of multiple AND gates in parallel, which all rely on the same core module. This concept was coined as a resource allocator, as the total amount of output solely depends on the core module and does not increase and overburden the cell when multiple promoter-recognition modules are expressed simultaneously. Thirdly, the T7 and phi15 RNAPs can be assembled into an AND gate in combination with the T7 promoter. When either the T7 or the phi15 RNAP are expressed, the desired output will be produced\u2014though in lower amounts by the phi15 RNAP. The remarkable transcriptional activity of viral RNAPs often leads to high levels of leaky expression of the gene of interest under uninduced conditions. We successfully tackled this problem by introducing the corresponding phage lysozymes in the expression hosts, mirroring the proven strategy of the T7 system [3]. Interestingly, while the phage RNAPs showed high specificity towards their native phage promoter, the phage lysozymes proved to be much more promiscuous. Indeed, the Pf-10 lysozyme reduced leakiness from the phi15 RNAP by 84%, whereas the native phi15 lysozyme only showed a 30% reduction in leaky msfGFP expression. These surprising results inspired a directed mutation analysis of the phi15 lysozyme for improved RNAP inhibition, leading to the engineering of the high-performant, non-toxic phi15 lysozyme (G3RQ) mutant. This result is consistent with the work by Cheng et al. [32], where an R3S mutation in the T7 lysozyme reduced the T7 RNAP inhibitory effect. In addition, the performance of the 67PfluR64PP and PPPL-1 lysozymes could be improved to reduce the basal expression from their corresponding RNAPs. Furthermore, the toxicity observed upon overexpression of the phage lysozymes can be alleviated by knocking out the amidase activity of these enzymes, as this activity is the likely source of the observed toxicity [32,40]. Overall, this work provides a set of non-toxic, orthogonal viral RNAPs with welldefined promoter sequences and lysozyme-based RNAP repressors for the Pseudomonas species to expand the SynBio toolbox of this genus and allow the design of a plethora of synthetic genetic circuitry, inspired by years of T7-based research. In future work, the potential of these phage-based expression systems can be further optimized and validated with proofs-of-concept with industrially relevant compounds. Several improvements could be investigated, including increased genomic stability with genomic integration of the phage RNAP and an optimized and standardized reporter construct with reliable promoter variants and potent transcriptional terminators, as well as tackling potential protein aggregation issues [17,21]."

To screen phage RNAPs, promoters, and lysozymes from T7-related phages in a similar setup, all necessary vectors were assembled using SEVAtile-shuffling by first amplifying the phageencode parts with a tail-PCR to add the required overhangs for SEVAtile-shuffling [34].

The fluorescent intensity of the msfGFP was measured at a 485 nm excitation wavelength and 528 nm emission wavelength with the enhanced dynamic range setting of the apparatus. All relative fluorescent measurements were blank-corrected for a sterile medium and normalized for cell growth by dividing by the corresponding OD600 value. To convert the relative fluorescence units of the msfGFP to absolute units, a calibration curve was added to each experiment [46]. More specifically, 0, 375, 750, and 1500 nM of 5(6)- carboxyfluorescein (5(6)-FAM) (Sigma Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to each plate in duplicate. All (normalized) fluorescent measurements of the msfGFP were subsequently converted to the equivalent 5(6)-FAM concentration. The data were analyzed, visualized, and verified for statistical significance using JMP 16 Pro. Statistical significance assays were performed on the final timepoint by first confirming the normality of the data for each sample (Shapiro\u2013Wilk), followed by an appropriate mean (multiple) comparisons test. In particular, if the data were normally distributed, a (pairwise) Student\u2019s t-test (\u03b1 = 0.05) was performed, while for non-normally distributed data, a (pairwise) Wilcoxon assay (\u03b1 = 0.05) was employed. No corrections for multiple comparisons were made due to large differences in variance between samples, except for the lysozyme optimization assays for inhibition of the phi15 RNAP, where variances were equal (Tukey HSD test, \u03b1 = 0.05)."
