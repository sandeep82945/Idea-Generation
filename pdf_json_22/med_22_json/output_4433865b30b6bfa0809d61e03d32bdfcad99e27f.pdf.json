    "abstractText": "Through the approaches in this article, an attempt was made to analyze the bonding of Al-Cu bimetallic composite layers and the highlight of the diffusion at the boundary between the layers, by hot rolling. An aluminum alloy 6060 plate (EN-AW AlMgSi) and a Cu-ETP 1/2 hard (CW004A) plate were used. All of these layers of materials were TIG-welded, at both ends, into a heat-treated layered composite and subsequently subjected to the hot-rolling process. The Al-Cu composite material obtained was analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) analysis, after being subjected to the tensile test, as well as energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The obtained results highlighted the diffusion at the boundary between the layers of the Al-Cu composite as well as its ductile breakage and the distribution of the amount of Al and Cu at the interface of the layers.",

Introduction\nThe discovery of new materials with special properties, against the background of resource depletion and the need to recycle existing materials, always arouses the interest of researchers [1\u201314] around the world. The production of light-resistant materials, which is necessary for the aeronautical, naval, energy, electrical, and electronic industries, pushes research towards the association of materials with completely different properties [15\u201322]. Aluminum, copper, and their alloys were used as a matrix in the component of rolling composite materials [23\u201325]. Copper\u2019s properties such as its high thermal and electrical conductivity, high modulus of elasticity, and good strength makes it widely useable for gas and water pipe devices, which allows heat transfer such as boilers, electronic circuits, and electrical components within the fields of industry: energy, aeronautical, naval, and automotive. Copper was used as a reinforcing element in the production of rolling composite materials [8,9,11,17,21,23\u201325], through the ARB process (accumulative roll bonding) [7,9\u201312,19\u201325] or hot rolling [1,2,17,18]. Along with other materials such as Ti, Sn, Mg, Fe, Nb, and Al, the properties of rolled composites have increased [3,9,15,17,21,23\u201325]. The problem with the bonding mechanism within layers of composite materials was the main subject of numerous studies [1,2,7,9\u201312,15\u201325], throughout the last decades. Regarding the mechanism of the bonding of the layers, the theories were dependent on the choice of the deformation process [3,16\u201318] (in this case rolling), which can take place through hot or cold conditions. These theories have been narrowed down to four: two are attributed to cold bonding [7,10\u201312,19\u201325], they include the film theory and the energy\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8807. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15248807 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8807 2 of 14\nbarrier theory; and two are attributed to hot bonding [1,3,17,18], these include the theory of diffusion bonding and the theory of diffusion bonding and the joint recrystallization theory. Research in the field of layered composites has intensified since 2013. Lee K.S. et al. analyzed the influence of the reduction ratio [26]; Kim I.-K. et al. analyzed the effect of component layer [27]; Kocich R. et al. analyzed the fabrication of cold-swaged multilayered [28]; Li X-B. et al. and Yu C. analyzed the roll bonding [29,30]; Jandaghi M.R. analyzed the impact on the corrosion [31]; Ebrahimi M. analyzed the characteristic investigation of the tri-layered composite [32]; and Mo T. et al. [33] and Zhang J.-P. et al. [34] analyzed the interface effect on the microstructure. The microstructure problems were also investigated by Liu T. [35], Shayanpoor A.A. [36], Venugopal S. [37], and Zhu Y. [38]. Cheng, J. et al. proposed a post-weld composite-treatment process for improving the mechanical properties of AA 6061-T6 aluminum alloy welded joints [39]. The main objective of this work is to obtain a multilayer Al-Cu composite by hot rolling and determine the characteristics of this layered composite. This composite could lead to the accumulation of advantages offered by both materials with very different properties and a reduction in their major disadvantages. The obtained material should have well-connected layers, and the entire composite system should be highly resistant to tensile strength and to wear value and consist of ductile properties.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sample Preparation\nThe purpose of this work was to create multilayer type samples of copper and aluminum. To make these samples, were used commercial extrusion aluminum from the 6000 series (EN-AW-6060 T6) and Cu-ETP (electrolytic tough pitch copper) 1/2 hard (CW004A). The multilayering of the composite was made after hot rolling. The samples were made of four layers (Figure 1), two of aluminum and two of copper, which were clamped alternately by front faces welding (Figure 2) type TIG (tungsten inert gas welding) with the addition of aluminum at both ends of the sample to reduce the possibility of sliding between the layers at the entrance to the rolling mill. Before TIG welding, the four layers were mechanically cleaned, degreased, and individually sprayed with a solution of 30% Al2O3 + 70% H2O2.\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 15\nor cold conditions.

Initial sample of multilayer Al-Cu composite.\nFigure 2. TIG welding with addition of aluminum at both ends of the initial sample. Figure 2. TIG welding with addition of aluminum at both ends of the initial sample.\nThe materials used in this work were chosen for reasons of hardness and resistance to shocks, but at the same time to have a high ductility. The materials used were aluminum EN AW-6060 T6 (AlMgSi) and Cu-ETP 1/2 hard (CW004A) with chemical composition, presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, and the mechanical properties in Tables 3 and 4.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8807 3 of 14\nThe chosen materials were commercial materials delivered in the form of a plate with dimensions of 20 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4000 mm. In the first stage, several pieces of plates of decreasing size were cut from the following materials: aluminum, one plate of 300 mm and one of 290 mm, after cutting two plates of copper, one of 295 mm and one of 285 mm, which were arranged as seen in the Figure 2. The Cu plates were annealed in advance in an electric furnace type Carbolite CTF/12/75/700 at a temperature of 700 \u25e6C and kept for one hour, after which the copper plates were removed and cooled in water. The pieces were then placed one on top of the other, which then made a multilayer composite specimen (Figure 1). The samples were TIG-welded with additional aluminum (Figure 2) at both ends to minimize the risk of layer slippage. Four cycles of annealing and hot rolling were performed (Figure 3). Before the hotrolling cycle with a reduction of 50% by one pass, the composites samples were placed in the electric furnace for 1 h at 500 \u25e6C. The rolling multilayer composites samples were performed using a rolling machine with a rolling diameter of 220 mm and a rolling speed of 36 rpm. After the first cycle of annealing and hot rolling, the copper layer underneath bonded. It can be deduced that the micro volumes at the interface did not adhere very well together, and the existence of some oxides can prevent bonding. Another hypothesis can be the different friction coefficient between the roll of the rolling mill and the copper layer and between the roll of the rolling mill and the aluminum layer. The second cycle of annealing and hot rolling (with 3 layers) was carried out with a reduction of 50%. The sample with three layers was cut. The two pieces were stacked, and a sample with 6 layers was obtained, to achieve the third cycle of annealing and hot rolling with the same reduction percent. In the fourth cycle of annealing and hot rolling, at the same reduction, the debonding of 2 layers (one of Cu and the other of Al) occurred. Therefore, a sample with 4 layers, Al-Cu-Al-Al, was obtained.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8807 4 of 14\nFigure 4 shows the annealing of the copper layer at 700 \u25e6C and the 4 cycles of annealing at 500 \u25e6C followed by hot rolling.

It can be seen that the first broken layer was the Al layer, from the outside, at a stress value of 157 MPa. The second breakage occurred simultaneously, within the two layers of Al and Cu, at 108 MPa. In the fracture zone, the layers have unbonded. The elongation to failure, of the first aluminum layer, was increased after the first two cycles of annealing and hot rolling up to 23%. The elongation to failure of simultaneously broken Al-Cu layers was 34%.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 8807 6 of 14\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 For the sample composites, after two cycles of annealing 1 h at 500 \u00b0C and hot rolling with 50% theoretical reduction, the dimensions obtained were 480 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 3 mm (Figure 5).

It can be seen\nthat the first broken layer was the Al layer, from the outside, at a stress value of 157 MPa.\nThe second breakage occurred simultaneously, within the two layers of Al and Cu, at 108\nMPa.\nIn the fracture zone, the layers have unbonded. The elongation to failure, of the first\naluminum layer, was increased after the first two cycles of annealing and hot rolling up\nto 23%. The elongation to failure of simultaneously broken Al-Cu layers was 34%.\nIt can be said that the mechanical properties obtained from engineering stress\u2013strain\ncurves are similar to those obtained in specialized literature by Taiqian Mo et al.

The specimen\u2019s microstructures and mechanical properties were investigated. The findings are summarized below:\n1. The Al-Cu rolling sheets show poor interfacial bonding. A heterogeneous structure can be observed with discrete cracks and defects at the interface of the Al-Cu layers. With an increased number of cycles of the annealing\u2013hot rolling of the multilayer Al-Cu composite, this becomes a more homogeneous structure. 2. The rolling reduction has a significant effect on the deformation of Al-Cu hot-rolled sheets. The deformation of each layer was analyzed. Severe deformation by hot rolling leads to better bonding. As the number of severe hot rolling increases, diffusion occurs, and a better bond between them is obtained. 3. The stress\u2013strain curve indicates that the fracture appears first in the Al layer. 4. The elongation to failure was increased after the first two cycles of annealing and hot\nrolling up to 23% (first break of aluminum) and was increased at 34% (second break).\nAuthor Contributions: Author contributions: conceptualization, I.-M.S.-B. methodology, I.-M.S.-B., M.T., D.I.F., F.P. and D.-A.I.-V.; software, I.-M.S.-B., F.P. and C.A.; validation, I.-M.S.-B., M.T., D.I.F. and D.-A.I.-V.; investigation, I.-M.S.-B., D.I.F., M.T. and F.P.; resources, D.I.F., D.-A.I.-V., F.P. and C.A.; data curation, I.-M.S.-B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.-M.S.-B.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.-M.S.-B., M.T., D.-A.I.-V., F.P. and C.A.; visualization, I.-M.S.-B., M.T., D.-A.I.-V., D.I.F., F.P. and C.A.; and supervision, I.-M.S.-B. and D.-A.I.-V.
