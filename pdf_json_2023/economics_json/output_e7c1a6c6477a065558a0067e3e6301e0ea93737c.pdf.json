COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on environmentally sound invention e ciency in China\nXuan Wei1*, Ranran Liu2* and Zhouzhou Lin3*\n1School of Statistics and Mathematics, Shandong University of Finance and Economics, Jinan, China, 2School of Technology and Business, Shandong Management University, Jinan, China, 3School of Politics and Public Administration, Soochow University, Suzhou, China\nIntroduction: The environmentally sound invention (ESI) is a \u201cbridge\u201d between environmental sound technologies (ESTs) and green productions. This study investigates the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on ESI e ciency using a multimethods model in three stages.\nMethods: The ESI e ciency is measured using the Slack-Based Measure (SBM) method in the first stage. By excluding the environmental e ect of the pandemic on each province using the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model\u2019s results in the second stage, this study compares the ESI e ciency change with or without the influence of the pandemic in the third stage.\nResults: The results show that the pandemic can be a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the short term, but an \u201copportunity\u201d in the long term. First, the SBM e ciency results in the first stage show a decrease in the number of the average e cient provinces in which the pandemic is more severe during 2020-2021. Second, results of the spatial Tobit and SFA models provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts the ESI e ciency during 2020, this impact is decreasing in 2021, and this impact has a spatial di usion e ect.\nDiscussion: Based on these results, this study discussed the theoretical and political implications. This paper enriches the knowledge of ESTs research and development by proposing a three-stage approach with multi-methods to investigate the influence of the pandemic\u2019s impact on ESI e ciency.\nKEYWORDS\nCOVID-19 pandemic, environmentally sound invention (ESI), ESI e ciency, environmental sound technologies (ESTs), Slack-Based Measure (SBM), spatial Tobit, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA)\n1. Introduction\nTo improve environmental performance and against climate change, Environmentally Sound Technology (EST) was defined and became a major component of international collaborations since the Rio Summit in 1992 (1). In September 2020, China put forward the dual-carbon goals, including carbon peaking before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. One of the operational guidelines in the Chinese action plan to reach such goals is leveraging the government\u2019s and the market\u2019s strengths (2). The operational guideline aims to accelerate the low-carbon technological revolution, emphasizing the importance of ESTs.\nChina has been paying attention to ESTs and their innovation for several years, and their origin and development can be seen in a series of studies since the 2000s (3). It can also be seen from the left part of Figure 1 that the number of Environmentally Sound Invention (ESI)\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 The trend of EST and the economy under the COVID-19.\npatents granted in China has shown an exponential growth trend since the 1990s. It is of great significance to ensure the steady improvement of ESTs for an eco-friendly development pattern (4).\nHowever, in the dual-carbon goals scenario, the COVID19 pandemic, a major public health emergency that began in December 2019, has widely affected many aspects of socio-economic development (e.g., the trend of the cumulative growth rate of retail sales of consumers in China shows in the right part of Figure 1). From a theoretical perspective, this pandemic contains two aspects: \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d, i.e., the occurrence of the pandemic generates forces that hinder development and promote development simultaneously. In terms of \u201ccrisis\u201d, the pandemic has resulted in the accelerated decoupling of China from global supply chains and the relocation of strategic manufacturing out of China (5). In terms of \u201copportunity\u201d, the large-scale government interventions to cope with the pandemic are expected to give rise to an opportunity for a green recovery (6).\nThe ESTs listed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (7) provided a reference to measure the quantity information of the ESI and its efficiency. However, the aspects of \u201ccrisis\u201d or \u201copportunity\u201d that dominate the impact on the ESI efficiency still lack empirical evidence. Therefore, the main goals of this study are as follows. First, this study needs to measure the ESI efficiency before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. ESI patent data are used as the output indicators. The rationale for this measure is the good nature of invention patents. I.e., the \u201cChina Patent Law (Revised in 2020)\u201d stipulates that \u201cthe invention granted with the patent right shall be novel, creative and practical\u201d, which implies that the patent examination system has a good function of checking technological innovation. Past empirical studies have also shown the effectiveness of measuring innovation through patent statistics (8). Second, this study aims to measure the different impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quantity and efficiency of the ESI. Third, this study tries to answer the question of whether the direction and significance of the efficiency change will be different without the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe main contributions of this study are as follows. First, ESI and ESI efficiency are new notions in academic research, although they are familiar in practice. A provincial level\u2019s ESI efficiency based on the Slack-Based measure (SBM) method is\nconstructed in this study. This study uses three types of regional ESI patent data, including firms, universities, and firm-university collaborations (FUCs), as the output of ESI and uses the SBM method to calculate the ESI efficiency from 2013 to 2021. Therefore, the efficiency difference before and after the pandemic in different regions can be compared preliminarily.\nSecond, a multi-methods model in three stages to examine the impact of COVID-19 on ESI efficiency is constructed. In particular, this study establishes the spatial Tobit and SFA models to test the direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on ESI output and ESI efficiency. The Tobit model captures the pandemic\u2019s impact on the ESI efficiency. The SFA model captures the impact on the potential increase of the output of ESI. This study also distinguishes the pandemic\u2019s heterogeneous impact on the ESI efficiency of firms, universities, and FUCs.\nThird, this study provides empirical evidence that the pandemic can be a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the short term but an \u201copportunity\u201d in the long term for the ESI efficiency. This research uses the environmental condition adjusting technology to calculate the ESI efficiency under the same environmental condition and makes a comparative analysis with the efficiency in the first stage.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a literature review including the theoretical background of ESI and its efficiency. The research design, material, and methods are described in Section 3. Section 4 is the empirical findings. Following the discussion in Section 5 to explore the theoretical and practical implications of this study. We make the conclusions and practical implications in Section 6 and practical implications and give limitations and future research in Section 7."

            "text": "From a narrow sense, inventions are new or improved devices\u2019, products\u2019, or processes of systems\u2019 ideas, sketches, or models (9). From a broad sense, inventions are the production of knowledge\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Concepts and their relationships related to ESI.\n(10). Although the invention is not unfamiliar in both practice and academic research documents (11). Environmentally sound invention (ESI) is a new notion in academic research to our knowledge. Figure 2 shows key concepts and their relationships related to ESI according to previous research. It is important because ESI can be a \u201cbridge\u201d between EST and green products/processes.\nThe right part of Figure 2 describes that ESI is a part of the process of green innovation (11). There are some different concepts to explain similar innovation processes toward sustainable development. Two representative concepts are eco-innovation (12) and environmental innovation (13). It can be divided into green product innovation (14) and green process innovation (15). Innovation can be successful or unsuccessful (16). Therefore, there is a capability view that suggests that ESI\u2019s producers should enhance their related capabilities such as environmental capability (17) and green core competence (18).\nThe left part of Figure 2 is the source of ESI. Studies on EST began in about 1990s after the Agenda 21 defined it (19). R&D activities based on internal and external EST accumulation have seemed as the direct source of ESI, i.e., the so-called technology push (20). Porter and Van der Linde\u2019s (21) foundational work clarifies the relationship between environmental goals and industrial performance, i.e., environmental regulation can reduce innovation offsets. Therefore, institutional factors can influence R&D activities on ESI. Related connotations include abatement pressure (22), pressure of environmental regulation (23), and government\u2019s greengrip (24). Another driving force of R&D activities on ESI is marketing, i.e., the so-called demand-pull (20). Related connotations include industry concentration (25), consumer environmental awareness (26), and pressure of the environmentalism (27).\nThen, the connotation of ESI in the center of Figure 2 and how to measure its efficiency can be clearer. In Figure 2, from the left part to the central part, ESI is the output of R&D activity which is influenced by marketing and institution. From the central part to the right part, ESI is the source of eco-innovation and green products. There are\nseveral similar concepts compared with ESI, including green product design (28), environmental patents (29), and green creativity (30). In sum, for measuring the ESI efficiency, the input and influencing factors can be found in studies of R&D activities on the base of EST, marketing, and institution regulation. The output factors can be found in studies of eco-innovation and environmental capabilities."

            "text": "When the innovation theory was put forward, Schumpeter (9) had already clarified that the crisis can breed innovation and development in the economic cycle. Moreover, although the \u201ccrisis\u201d Schumpeter mentioned belongs to the economic category, it is defined as the result of external things acting on the economic field and causing interference. Therefore, external disturbances can play a significant role in innovation-driven economic cycles. In environmental and sustainable studies, other connotations of external disturbances that have been defined include environmental uncertainty (31) and environmental dynamism (32). On the one hand, major public emergencies may disrupt innovation in the previous economic process (33). On the other hand, public emergencies can breed new innovations through demand-pull, supply-push (34), or the emergence of crowd wisdom (35).\nThe empirical research results support this contradictory theory. On the one hand, from the perspective of the input of ESI, some empirical studies are optimistic about the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on ESI. For example, previous research has drawn attention to the environmental pollutant treatment technology (36) and the food supply chain\u2019s waste problem (37) due to the pandemic and expects substantial progress in related technologies (38). The investment in smart city projects in China during the COVID-19\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\npandemic reduced the infection rate and promoted the innovative development of digital industries and urban sustainable technologies (39). Studies in Brazil and Portugal show that the pandemic has significantly enhanced the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable consumption among the residents of Baby Boomers and Generations X and Y (40).\nOn the other hand, from the perspective of the output of ESI, there is also evidence highlighting the negative impact of the pandemic on ESI. For example, a survey of 526 companies in Norway showed that the average level of firms\u2019 adoption of environmental innovations had dropped significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic (41). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the implementation of plastic reduction policies in Europe and around the world, thus leading to an increase in plastic waste, which harms the environment and human health (42). The macroeconomic blockade effect caused by the pandemic has brought many adverse effects on the innovation of SMEs (43).\nIt can be noticed that topics of the optimistic studies, including promotion in EST, investment in smart city projects, environmental protection awareness, and sustainable consumption, are all input factors for ESI. Topics of pessimistic studies, including firms\u2019 adoption of environmental innovations, increase in plastic waste, and negative effects on SMEs\u2019 innovation, are all output factors for ESI.\nAccording to this background, although there is still no previous study research on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on ESI efficiency, this study put forward the following hypotheses.\nHYPOTHESIS 1. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative effect on regions\u2019 ESI efficiency.\nMoreover, the spatial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on human activities may result in changes in ESI efficiency across regions. For example, Chen et al. (44) found that the lockdown policy because of the pandemic had resulted in a decrease in the flow of goods and services between cities. Huggins and Thompson (45) argued that the pandemic is likely to heighten rather than slow down the trend that more spatially distributed patterns of entrepreneurial innovation are emerging across a wider range of cities and regions. Korkmaz et al. (46) revealed that the response to the pandemic had caused education inequalities across regions. Dannenberg et al. (47) believed that the increase in online trade which was led by the pandemic has changed the trend of the spatial economics of innovation. Therefore, this study put forward the following hypotheses.\nHYPOTHESIS 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant spatial effect on ESI efficiency."

And we test the significance of the influence of the pandemic on the potential increase of different types of ESI output using the spatial SFA model.

The output variable is selected according to the type of inventors\u2019 organizations (53), including the number of ESI patent applications of firms, universities, and FUCs. The reason for choosing the number of ESI patent applications is that invention patents have higher requirements for novelty and creativity than utility model and design patents, and the measurement of technological innovation is more accurate (54). On the other hand, the number of applications has better timeliness and stability than the number of authorized patents. The data source of the ESI patent applications is the Patsnap Database (https://www.patsnap.com/). We screened the ESI patents using the International Green Patent Inventory published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (https://www.wipo.int/ classifications/ipc/green-inventory/).

From the following two perspectives, it can be preliminarily judged that the pandemic has negatively affected the ESI efficiency.\nFirst, from the number of provinces at the frontier each year, the ESI efficiency from 2013 to 2021 can be roughly divided into three stages. The first stage is from 2013 to 2016, and the number of provinces at the frontier is 4\u20135 each year. The second stage is from 2017 to 2019, and the number of provinces at the frontier is 9\u201310 each year. The third stage is from 2020 to 2021, and the number of provinces at the frontier is 7 each year.\nSecond, this study divides different provinces into four types based on the severity of the pandemic. When the number of confirmed cases in a province is in the first half of all provinces in a year, the severity is defined as \u201cHigh\u201d. Otherwise, the severity is defined as \u201cLow\u201d. There are four different types of provinces: High in 2020 and Low in 2021 (HL), High in 2020 and High in 2021 (HH), Low in 2020 and High in 2021 (LH), Low in 2020 and Low in 2021 (LL). This study analyzes the average rank of ESI efficiency scores of different types of provinces. The more efficient DMUs, the little the average rank of ESI efficiency scores. Its trend chart is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen from Figure 3 that there is a peak of the average rank of all types of provinces in 2017. And the average rank of the four types of provinces is at the lowest point in 2019. The average rank of the HH provinces is the lowest in 2020 and 2021. While the leader of the rank is the HL provinces in 2020 and LL provinces in\n2021. Moreover, the rank of HH and LH provinces has a declining trend, and the rank of HL and LL provinces has an increasing trend.\nThese efficiency rank results show an abnormal decline in the number of efficient DMUs in 2020, which is synchronized with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trend of the average rank of different types of provinces also shows a correlation between the pandemic and ESI efficiency. Therefore, these results preliminarily prove that the pandemic has a negative effect on ESI efficiency. However, it is uncertain whether there is an explanation-to-explained relationship between the outbreak\u2019s severity and this phenomenon. Therefore, more inspection is necessary."

From Table 5, the Moran\u2019s I of the dependent variables, including the ESI efficiency score and the total number of ESI patent applications, are both nonsignificant. Therefore, the spatial lag model is initially excluded. Among the independent variables, the p-value of theMoran\u2019s I of confirmed cases is significant in 2020 and nonsignificant in 2021. The pandemic outbreak in 2020 may make a more significant spatial impact, and in 2021, the effective control policies curb the spread between regions. The p-values of the Moran\u2019s I for the control variables are all significant. It implies that it is necessary to consider the spatial effect of independent variables and control variables.\nTable 6 further shows the judgment and selection of the spatial econometricmodel. Themain judgment indicators includeMoran\u2019s I,\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org\nLagrangian multiplier (LM), and Robust Lagrangian multiplier (Robust LM). It can be found that the fitting results of the spatial error model and the spatial lag model of the four different dependent variables are all poor. Additionally, considering that the p-values of the efficiency in Table 5 are not significant, this study excluded the spatial error model and the spatial lagmodel. The spatial independent variable lag model is used without spatial error and spatial lag.\nIn a spatial independent variable lag model without spatial error and dependent variable lag effect, the classical linear model\u2019s estimation and statistical inference methods are unbiased. Therefore, special estimation and statistical inference methods are unnecessary (60). Table 7 shows the regression results with spatial effects of independent variables. The dependent variables of Model (1) and Model (2) are the numbers of ESI patent applications in 2021\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 07 frontiersin.org\nand 2020, respectively. The dependent variables of Model (3) and Model (4) are ESI efficiency scores measured in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFrom the results of Model (1) and Model (2), the number of confirmed cases has no significant impact on the output of ESI patents in the current and next years. It shows that the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ESI is not significant. From Model (3) and Model (4), the number of confirmed cases has no significant impact on ESI efficiency in 2020, but the impact of the confirmed cases on ESI efficiency in 2021 is significantly negative. In addition, the spatial effect of the confirmed cases in 2020 on ESI efficiency 2020 is significantly positive. It implies at the first year of the outbreak, although the COVID-19 pandemic has no significant direct impact on ESI efficiency, and a province\u2019s ESI efficiency will increase as the number of confirmed cases in the surrounding region increases.\nThese results are accordant with the results shown in Table 4 that the rank of the ESI efficiency of provinces with fewer confirmed cases is relatively higher than provinces with severe pandemic environments. This evidence further supports the hypothesis that the pandemic has a negative effect on ESI efficiency."

            "text": "Considering the spatial autocorrelation, the spatial effects of independent and control variables are incorporated into the SFA model. The results are shown in Table 8. The results include a total of 6 models. The dependent variables of Model (1)\u2013Model (3) are the slack values of the output variables in the SBMmodel in 2020, i.e., the number of ESI patent applications of firms, universities, and FCUs, respectively. The dependent variables of Model (4)\u2013Model (6) are the slack values of the output variables in the SBMmodel in 2021.\nThe results of Model (1)\u2013Model (3) show that in 2020, the confirmed cases have a negative impact on the slack of ESI output. The spatial effect of the confirmed cases in 2020 also has a significant negative impact on the slack of ESI output. That indicates that a province with more confirmed cases may negatively impact the potential increase of ESI not only itself but also its surrounding regions. The results of Model (4)\u2013Model (6) show that the impact of the confirmed cases is not significant on the slack of ESI output in 2021. Additionally, the spatial effect term of the confirmed cases in 2020 negatively impacts the slack values of universities in 2021. That indicates that the negative effect of the COVID-19 is decreasing in the second year. Moreover, the values of \u03b3 of Model (1)\u2013(6) are between 0.1 and 0.4, indicating that environmental variables and statistical noise dominate the disturbance of insufficient output of ESI in firms. Therefore, it is judged that the continuous impact of the COVID-19 has created a more challenging external environment for EST innovation. These results indicate that a region with a more severe pandemic led to a more difficult environment for ESI output in 2020 and 2021 for both the region itself and regions surrounding it. Therefore, this evidence supports both hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2.\nTABLE 6 Spatial measurement model selection.\nDependent variable Spatial error Spatial lag\nMoran\u2019s I LM Robust LM LM Robust LM\nESI efficiency in 2021 Statistic 0.47 0.24 0.63 0.68 1.07\np-value 0.64 0.63 0.43 0.41 0.30\nESI efficiency in 2020 Statistic 0.65 0.05 0.36 0.27 0.57\np-value 0.51 0.82 0.55 0.61 0.45\nTotal ESI patent applications in 2021 Statistic 0.44 0.36 0.71 0.07 0.43\np-value 0.66 0.55 0.40 0.79 0.52\nTotal ESI patent applications in 2020 Statistic 0.61 0.14 0.35 0.02 0.22\np-value 0.54 0.70 0.55 0.90 0.64\nTABLE 7 Spatial Tobit regression results.\nVariable Total invention patent applications\nin 2021\nTotal invention patent applications\nin 2020\nE ciency in 2021 E ciency in 2020\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\nConfirmed in 2021 \u22120.8488\n(\u22120.4798)\n\u22120.0001\u2217 (2.0543)\nConfirmed in 2020 \u22121.8555\n(\u22120.5071)\n\u22121105.9037\n(\u22120.6491)\n\u22120.0000\n(\u22120.1411)\n0.0001\n(0.8938)\nWconfirmed in 2020 0.1496\n(0.0655)\n\u22120.5565\n(\u22120.2842)\n0.0001\u2217 (1.8437)\n0.0001\n(1.6133)\nWconfirmed in 2021 \u22120.6570\n(\u22120.6049)\n\u22120.0000\n(\u22120.4866)\nControl variable and its spatial effect Yes Yes Yes Yes\nOne-year lag of the dependent variable Yes Yes Yes Yes\nVar(e.te2021) 0.0067\u2217\u2217\n(3.1117)\nVar(e.te2020) 0.0158\u2217\u2217\n(2.9937)\nN 27 27 27 27\nAdj.

These results basically support HYPOTHESIS 1: The COVID19 pandemic has a negative effect on regions\u2019 ESI efficiency. However, the negative effect of the pandemic is a decrease in the second year. These results coincide with indirect evidence from previous studies. On the one hand, the pandemic results in an increase in the driving force of ESTs\u2019 R&D activities including demand-pull [e.g., environmental protection awareness and sustainable consumption (40)], technology-push [e.g., environmental pollutant treatment technology (36)], and institution regulation [e.g., altering geopolitical and socio-economic norms (61)]. On the other hand, the pandemic results in a decrease in the output of the eco-innovation [e.g., (43)] and green capabilities [e.g., (62)]. To sum up, the efficiency is reduced because of the increase in input and the decrease in output.\nSecond, this study finds that there is a spatial effect on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and ESI efficiency. These results support HYPOTHESIS 2: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant spatial effect on ESI efficiency. Additionally, the results of this study show that external environmental factors significantly affect the slack term of ESI efficiency, that is, the potential increase in output. That means the ESI efficiency can be improved in a suitable environment (63). These results have two inspirations: how to create a better production environment for ESI and how to improve the environmental adaptability of regional ESI. This study argues that a common solution to these two issues is strengthening regional innovation cooperation (64). The ESI patent data collected by this research show that the main form of cooperation in China\u2019s ESI is FUCs. However, the two sides of the cooperation are often firms and universities in the same province. The number of green invention patents from FUCs accounted for 19% of the total from 2013 to 2021. The proportion of the green invention patent from the cooperation between provinces is much lower than this. For example, from 2013 to 2021, the proportion of the green invention patent that came from\nthe cooperation between Beijing and other provinces was<0.3% of all green invention patents in Beijing. Previous studies have proved the beneficial of collaborations between regions to ESTs\u2019 innovation (65). So we suggest that ESI activities should break the barrier of the border between regions to enhance the robustness of the whole system (66).\nBased on these results, the theoretical implication of this study\ncan be summarized as follows.\nFirst, a new connotation, ESI, is introduced in this study. This new connotation may fill in gaps between the driving force and ecoinnovation. There are several benefits to embedding the ESI in the process from driving force to eco-innovation. On the one hand, ESI can be beneficial to classify the type of eco-innovation. Schumpeter (67) classified five types of innovation from the perspective of \u201cnew combination\u201d. There are also various types of eco-innovation. For example, Rennings (68) classified eco-innovations nature as technological, organizational, social, and institutional innovation. So \u201cstudies from the driving force to eco-innovation\u201d is in a broad sense. A mediated indicator of factors such as ESI can make the theoretical path clearer. On the other hand, the concept of ESI can be beneficial to alleviate the indicator confusion problem in eco-innovation studies. Eco-innovation is not only a result but also a process, which makes the indicator of eco-innovation can be confusion (8). Some studies evaluate eco-innovation use indicators before innovation\u2019s market entry such as R&D (69), EST (70), or patents (71), some other studies evaluate eco-innovation use indicators after innovation\u2019s commercialization such as quality certifications (72). That may make a large measuring error using different indicators to evaluate the same connotation (73). Therefore, the measure of the ESI is a more appropriate way to evaluate eco-innovation from different perspectives.\nSecond, this study\u2019s results enrich the knowledge of the relationship between emergencies such as the pandemic and sustainable development of cleaner production. Previous studies have constructed two controversial theoretical paths of the relationship between emergencies and technological innovation in a broad sense. One of them takes an emergency as an \u201copportunity\u201d for related development (74). The other one takes an emergency as \u201cdamage\u201d\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org\nfor related development (33). This study enriches the knowledge of this relationship by providing new empirical evidence.\nThird, for the change of ESI efficiency, is the pandemic a \u201ccrisis\u201d or an \u201copportunity\u201d? It\u2019s about time. The results of this study show that the negative effect of the pandemic is breaking out in 2020 and decreasing in 2021. Specifically, in the short term, the potential of the ESI increasing is reduced because of the pandemic. Previous studies also argue that innovating in response to the crisis, time seems crucial (75). Ebersberger and Kuckertz (76) recognized that start-ups have a short response time to the pandemic compared with universities. In the short-term, the pandemic can lead to increased input of the ESI innovation because of the pandemic\u2019s effect on the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable consumption\n(40), the increasing investment in environmental pollutant treatment technology (36), and the increasing investment on the digital economics for the sustainable development (39). However, it takes time to get the rewards of the increased input (77). Based on this result, we argue that the pandemic can be a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the short term but an \u201copportunity\u201d in the long term."

The theoretical background from the driving force to eco-innovation with themediated of ESI is sorted out. The empirical study is divided into three stages and conducted stepby-step tests using a multi-method model, including SBM efficiency measurement, spatial Tobit regression, SFA model, and three-stage DEA analysis.\nFirst, the efficiency measure results indicate a decrease in the ESI efficiency after the outbreak of the pandemic. The results of the spatial Tobit model further show that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 harms the efficiency of green technological innovation in both 2020 and 2021. The results of the SFA model show that the direct and spatial effect is different in different years and for different inventors. These results support our assumptions that the ESI efficiency is negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the spatial effect exists.\nSecond, additional implications can be drawn from the empirical results. We compared the original and environmentally adjusted efficiency scores in 2020 and 2021. It can be found that the average efficiency rank of HH and LH provinces is more affected than in other areas in 2020. And combined with some other studies\u2019 results which have been referred in the discussion section, we argue that the pandemic can be a \u201ccrisis\u201d in the short term but an \u201copportunity\u201d in the long term.\nThird, this study\u2019s results provide a new model to evaluate the influence of exogenous shocks to the process of eco-innovation. And the connotation of ESI makes the skeleton of the theoretical system\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nfrom the driving force of EST R&D activities to eco-innovation/green capabilities clearer."

            "text": "Based on the analysis of this research, the ESI efficiency under and post the COVID-19 pandemic is a complex system problem. The influence can be direct and indirect, on both input and output, on both regional macro andmicro levels, and both public ESI innovation and private ESI innovation. On the base of these results, the practical implications and policy suggestions can be drawn as follows.\nFirst, policymakers can try to learn from provinces that keep a high ESI efficiency with the high severity of the pandemic. This study\u2019s analysis identified the high and low-efficiency regions in China, the method is suitable for other countries or regions. For example, HH provinces such as Jiangsu, HL provinces such as Beijing are efficient provinces during 2020\u20132021. The experience can be found in other documents such as the system of environmental regulation policies (78) and recovery strategies (79).\nSecond, through the experience of provinces that have low severity of the pandemic, policies makers could learn how to decrease the damage of the pandemic to the ESI efficiency from other regions. For example, Zhejiang has a high severity in 2020 and low severity in 2021, the efficiency value is 1 no matter whether exclude the effect of the pandemic. Previous research has found that the institutional innovation in Zhejiang which emerged against the COVID-19 pandemic offers a way to transform the crisis into an opportunity (80)."
