    "abstractText": "A passive seismic experiment is carried out at the non-volcanic highly degassing site of Mefite d\u2019Ansanto located at the northern tip of the Irpinia region (southern Italy), where the 1980 MS 6.9 destructive earthquake occurred. Between 2020 and 2021, background seismic noise was recorded by deploying a broadband seismic station and a seismic array composed of seven 1 Hz three-component sensors. Using two different array configurations, we were allowed to explore in detail the 1\u201320 Hz frequency band of the seismic noise wavefield as well as Rayleigh wave phase velocities in the 400\u2013800 m/s range. Spectral analyses and array techniques were applied to one year of data showing that the frequency content of the signal is very stable in time. High frequency peaks are likely linked to the emission source, whereas at low frequencies seismic noise is clearly correlated to meteorological parameters. The results of this study show that small aperture seismic arrays probe the subsurface of tectonic CO2-rich emission areas and contribute to the understanding of the link between fluid circulation and seismogenesis in seismically active regions.",

            "text": "In the Mefite valley of the Irpinia region (southern Italy, Figures 1 and 2), the existence of large and lethal CO2 emissions has aroused interest since ancient times [1]. The Mefite gas emission site was mentioned by M\u00f6rner and Etiope [2] in a review paper on the worldwide non-volcanic CO2 gas escaping from the upper mantle. The authors highlighted how carbon dioxide measured in non-volcanic \u201ccolder\u201d environments, such as Mefite, is much greater than previously assumed and how it significantly affects the global CO2 amount. Chiodini et al. [3] estimated a total CO2 flux of \u223c2000 tons per day at Mefite that is the largest non-volcanic gas emission measured on the Earth. They also found that, under low-wind conditions, the gas flows along a narrow natural channel, producing a persistent invisible and lethal gas river. Roberts et al. [4] considered that the CO2 released at Mefite could originate from a source in the underlying anticline in proximity of faults with high permeability able to favor gas migration, providing efficient fluid pathways into the overburden. Giustini and Brilli [5] estimated a reservoir fluid temperature up to 120\u2013125 \u25e6C at the depth of about 3000 m below the ground level.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1630. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23031630 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 1630 2 of 18\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\nfluid pathways into the overburden. Giustini and Brilli [5] estimated a reservoir fluid temperature up to 120\u2013125 \u00b0C at the depth of about 3000 m below the ground level.\nMefite is set in the Ansanto Valley between the Sannio (to the north) and Irpinia seismogenic regions, at the northern tip of the Irpinia fault system that is associated with the destructive MS 6.9, 1980 Irpinia earthquake [8,9]. This zone falls in the axial part of the southern Apennine that, since the middle-late Pleistocene, experienced a SW-NE extension that determined the formation NW\u2013SE striking dip-slip normal faults [10,11]. The gas leakage at Mefite is probably linked to the presence of these active fault systems that are responsible for the large historical earthquakes in the region [3,7]. The Mefite degassing area lies on the western flank of the structural high of the Frigento Antiform (FA, Figure 1), where calcareous-siliciclastic and marly deposits of the Lagonegro Units crop out [12,13]. At depth, well and seismic profile data show that Miocene siliciclastic deposits of the Lagonegro Units tectonically cover the Cretaceous Apulian Platform carbonates [14,15] that can be found at shallow depths (top at 1128 m depth, Mt. Forcuso 1 well [16]). The area is characterized by the presence of vents and small boiling mud lakes that emit gases, among which CO2 is the most abundant [3].

The main fluid emission center consists of a bubbling mud pool, the Gray Lake (Figure 2b). From the emission site, the gas flows due to its density and channelizes at the bottom of a narrow valley to the west [5].\nThe isotopic signature of the CO2 testifies a deep origin of the gases emitted at Mefite, whose source is probably the mantle wedge beneath the Apennines along the Tyrrhenian side [3]. Deeply generated fluids may ascent through an interconnected network of fractures and faults and then they may be trapped in crustal pockets, which feed the gas emissions at the surface [3]. The Mefite degassing area is likely fed by the CO2 reservoir of Mt. Forcuso 1 well, at about 2 km east of Mefite, that is hosted at the top of the Apulian Platform carbonates and sealed by clayey and calcareous marly sediments of Lagonegrese Units [3,7]. The role of CO2 emissions in seismicity occurrence has been discussed by a large number of studies worldwide. Cusano et al.

[17] investigated the source properties of long-period earthquakes recorded at Campi Flegrei (Italy) during the 2005\u20132006 mini-uplift episode, which was quickly followed by CO2 outflux increase. A locally fracturing process was hypothesized to increase the medium permeability enhancing fluid migration, which in turn generates earthquakes and a higher fluid flux at surface. Chiodini et al. [18] analyzed repeated seismic sequences in 2009\u20132018 in central Apennine (Italy) and records of CO2 flux whose rate varies accordingly to the seismicity occurrence. Those authors retrieved a model\nSensors 2023, 23, 1630 4 of 18\nin which the CO2 flux modulates the analyzed seismic sequences and highlighted how the CO2-enriched slab-derived fluids ascend in the crust and interact with Apennine chain aquifers; in tectonically active zones, the fluid ascent is likely favored by crust fracturing during earthquakes and the pressurized rising fluids can trigger earthquakes. Yamada et al. [19] analyzed multidisciplinary data at Kusatsu-Shirane volcano (Japan), relative to the eruption of 2018, where the onset of surface activity was preceded by volcanic tremor, within a frequency band of 5\u201320 Hz. Those authors hypothesized a link between the observed seismicity and shear fracture mechanisms induced by sudden hydrothermal fluid injection, containing CO2 [20]. In a recent review paper, Di Luccio et al. [9] presented an updated overview of the fluids (CO2) and seismicity relationships in the Apennines mountain range (Italy) through a multidisciplinary approach. Those authors highlight the necessity of multiparametric monitoring and long-term analysis of different observables to formulate a reliable conceptual model on the role of fluids in the preparatory phase of earthquakes in the southern Apennines. A few recent seismological studies have focused on the Mefite area. Pischiutta et al. [7] applied a seismic noise polarization analysis and a single station horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio method to study the seismic wavefield. They performed 25 measurements of 20 min duration, within 5 km distance from the main emissions and found that the ground motion was significantly polarized in the horizontal plane with a N115 predominant trend in the gas emission area. This polarization vanished moving away from the vents, and Pischiutta et al. [7] explained this directional effect as due to fault-induced fractures. Panebianco et al. [21] tested an automated machine learning technique in the 6\u201320 Hz frequency band to retrieve tremor signals from the background noise recorded from 30 October to 2 November 2019. Both these studies are based on a short-term dataset. FURTHER (the role of FlUids in the pReparaTory pHase of EaRthquakes in Southern Apennines, https://progetti.ingv.it/en/further, last access 28 November 2022) is a multidisciplinary Departmental Strategic Project of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) started in 2020 to investigate the involvement of fluids in the seismogenesis of the southern Apennines, Italy. One of the goals of the project is to detect the footprint of fluid contribution to the seismogenic process in the seismic signal recorded at Mefite d\u2019Ansanto [22]. In the present work, we describe the seismic survey carried out at Mefite from September 2020 to September 2021 and present a first insight in the local seismic wavefield properties throughout the inspection of the temporal patterns and the spectral characteristics of the continuous seismic noise signals. Moreover, we show some preliminary results obtained from the application of array techniques."

MTST was equipped with two sensors, one short period (1 Hz) and one broadband (20 s). The main spectral content of the recorded noise resulted between 1 and 20 Hz. On 20 November 2020, we installed a seismic station at about 100 m from the Gray Lake to the north in a farmhouse.

            "text": "Seismic arrays are largely used in hydrothermal environments [23\u201326] to investigate the seismic noise wavefield and to track sources of non-impulsive signals, such as volcanic or non-volcanic tremor, since they improve the signal-to-noise ratio. To design the array at Mefite, we evaluate how different configurations correctly sample the recorded signal by using the Array Transfer Function (ATF). Under the hypothesis of a vertically incident monochromatic plane wavefield, the response of the array is given by the beamforming method [23], which in the horizontal plane (kx, ky) is expressed as (https://www.geopsy.org/wiki/index.php/Array_signal_processing, last access 22 December 2022):\nATF(k \u2212 k0) = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 1N N\u2211i=1 exp(\u2212jxi\u00b7(k \u2212 k0)) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 (1) where k0 is the true wavenumber vector of a single plane wave, k = (kx, ky), N is the number of sensors, j is the imaginary unit, and xi is the position vector of the i-th sensor. This function exhibits a central peak in which the value is 1 (kx and ky = 0) and secondary aliasing peaks in which the amplitude is less than or equal to 1. The phase velocity values can be derived as a function of wavenumber (k) or frequency, and their limits depend on the array geometry. Figure 3a shows the performance of the first array configuration (Figure 2), composed of 7 sensors with inter-sensor distance between 45 and 200 m. The resolution limit, kmin/2, is taken as the radius of the central peak of the ATF measured at the mid-height (0.5). The aliasing limit, kmax, is the lowest k value, greater than kmin/2, obtained at the intersection of ATF with the diagonal line at 0.5 (diagonal black line in Figure 3b), in correspondence of the azimuths with the most restrictive limit (Figure 3c). In Figure 3d, the domain of velocities/frequencies that can be correctly reproduced by the array is the portion of the plane comprised between the continuous black curve and the dashed one. The two parameters, kmin and kmax, are directly related to the geometry of the array in terms of interstation distance and aperture [27]. AME first configuration shown in Figure 2, whose ATF is reported in Figure 3, was appropriate to explore the 1.8\u20135 Hz frequency band and Rayleigh wave phase velocities in the 480\u2013800 m/s range. This array acquired data from 8 June to 24 August 2021. On 24 August, three stations were moved to the new locations (Figure 2), reducing the interstation distances to better analyze higher frequency signals likely coming from the main emission field. The new array configuration recorded data until 28 September 2021. Figure 4 shows the performance of the second array configuration, which is composed of 7 sensors with inter-sensor distance between 38 and 191 m.

AME stations were uninstalled on 28 September 2021.\nArray techniques [28] strongly contribute to distinguish one source from another by tracking the incoming wavefield directions (backazimuth estimation), by discriminating if a wavepacket propagatioin is surficial or deep (high or low slowness values, respectively) by establishing if a signal is coherent (well identified source) or incoherent (i.e., diffuse sources such as anthropogenic multiple sources). Among the array techniques, beamforming and high resolution [27] allow one to retrieve the wavefield propagation characteristics throughout the estimation of the semblance in time domain [29] and coherence in frequency domain, and the slowness and backazimuth of the seismic wavefield. These methods are commonly applied over sliding time-windows of signals synchronized among the array stations, and filtered in limited frequency bands.\nFigure 4. (a) AME second configuration.

The coherence of the seismic wavefield at the array stations (Figure 10, second panel) is characterized by scattered values, with most of them between 0.3 and 0.6. Such low values can be determined by seismic wave trains coming from different directions that make up as an uncoherent wavefield. Sometimes, a higher coherence, up to 0.9, indicates a more coherent wavefield, likely due to the short-term predominance of a well-defined seismic source. The backazimuth of the analyzed signals (third panel in Figure 10) indicates that most of the noise sources are in the northern sector (300\u2013360\u25e6 and 0\u201360\u25e6). The slowness is also characterized by very scattered values, with most of them between 1 and 2 s/km corresponding to apparent velocities between 0.5 and 1.0 km/s typical of surface waves. These features characterize the first 20 h of the day. After 20 UTC, the results of backazimuth and slowness become very different compared to those in the previous hours. The backazimuth values are in a narrow range centered at about 160\u25e6 that means SE of the array center. The slowness values vary in a narrow range centered at about 2.2 s/km, corresponding to an apparent velocity of about 0.45 km/s. The direction SE from the array center corresponds to the Mefite emission field (Figure 2). Therefore, results of the array analyses indicate that the background seismic signal at 3 Hz contains a contribution likely radiated from the hydrothermal system. However, such hydrothermal tremor has very low amplitude; thus, it is overcome by anthropogenic noise during the daytime.

Our fieldwork explored the north\u2013western portion of the Mefite emission zone, where the ascent to the surface of deeply derived CO2 fluids is favored by high permeability fractures and active faults [3]. The seismic noise spectral content clearly displays four frequency bands, 0.2\u20131 Hz (blp), 1\u20135 Hz (b1), 5\u201310 Hz (b2) and 10\u201315 Hz (b3) (Table 3). The b1, b2 and b3 bands were always identified (Figures 6 and 9), with the higher spectral amplitude in b2 and b3 in proximity of the main vents (Figure 9). This agrees with Panebianco et al. [21], who retrieved similar spectral distribution by the seismic noise analysis over a limited time period of four days. The stations closer to the main vents (AME4, AME5 and MTST) show a significant spectral peak at frequencies higher than 15 Hz (Figure 9). Similar behaviors are consistent with those in Pischiutta et al. [7], indicating that the peculiar spectral pattern tends to disappear away from the gas emission site. Moreover, the higher the frequencies, the lesser the associated signal patterns seem affected by the 24h periodicity (Figure 7). These observations let us to suppose the existence of a seismic source around the main vents with the most energetic components associated to the b2 and b3 bands and above 15 Hz. In the b1 band, the wavefield seems to be composed of different contributions, none of which appears definitively dominating, whereas the sharp spectral component at 1.4 Hz likely has an anthropogenic origin. Results of the array analyses obtained so far confirm that uncoherent seismic noise is often predominant in this frequency band. A significant seismic signal at 3 Hz is also found and is likely produced by the degassing activity nearby. In hydrothermal environments, spectral peaks possibly generated by the degassing process are mixed with the contribution from different sources, some of them being probably of anthropogenic origin. These are mainly recorded in the b1 band. Exploring the seismic noise properties at Mt. Vesuvius (Italy) by using array analyses, Saccorotti et al. [32] attributed daily changes of the noise spectral power in the 1\u20134 Hz band to artificial sources but did not exclude the concomitant action of natural sources. Falanga et al. [33], by performing a detailed investigation of the seismic noise at Ischia Island, found three independent seismic signals in the 1\u20135 Hz band. A dominant and persistent signal was found at 1\u20132 Hz and demonstrated as being due to the hydrothermal system, its overtone at 2\u20134 Hz, and a component linked to anthropogenic activities, which shares the same frequencies of the overtone. Although the very low amplitude of the signal between 1 and 5 Hz does not allow for the unique characterization of the wavefield and source, results from our work motivate further investigation of the background seismicity. A larger number of seismic stations in and around the Mefite emission site would greatly help the comprehension of the hydrothermal tremor by applying array techniques. Small aperture arrays, with inter-sensor distances such as AME configurations, were deployed for several studies to explore the wavefield characteristics in hydrothermal environments and allowed to explore low-frequency (<10 Hz) wavefields in detail. The investigation of Saccorotti et al. [32] was based on data recorded by an array of 20 stations, with an interstation distance of 40\u2013500 m. Their configuration allowed them to explore the 1\u201310 Hz frequency band, in which they were able to discriminate three distinct components of the wavefield associated to three different sources. By applying array analysis to data at Campi Flegrei Caldera (Italy), La Rocca and Galluzzo [23] found the presence of nearly continuous coherent signals that include bursts of 10\u201315 s duration and spectral content in 1\u20133 Hz. Those authors interpreted the signals as a sequence of low-frequency earthquakes\nSensors 2023, 23, 1630 14 of 18\nproduced by the same source and linked to the hydrothermal activity. Their deployment was composed of 10 short period sensors (1 Hz) with small aperture (400 m). These small aperture array configurations do not allow for a correct use of array techniques below 1 Hz, which could give more information about the hydrothermal system dynamics. A more extended array was used by Wu et al. [24] in two weeks of 2015 to investigate the shallow hydrothermal system of Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone (USA). The deployment consisted of 133 three-component geophones, with an interstation spacing of about 50 m and an aperture of about 1 km, and allowed for an exploration, in great spatial detail, of the hydrothermal activity of the study area. The recorded seismic tremor was associated to the hydrothermal fluid dynamics and steam migration at a low frequency (<10 Hz) and to boiling water and bubble collapse at a high frequency (>10 Hz). In addition, a first-order estimation of the fluid content from seismic data was also possible. In the case of Mefite, the limited area to install the array does not allow for a significant increase in the array maximum aperture, and this also limits the application of array techniques at shallow phenomena (about 300\u2013400 m). The blp band results unaffected by 24 h periodicity but shows an evident link with rainfall; although, a relation seems to also exist in the other bands. In general, seismic noise in the blp band is related to natural sources, such as the ocean/sea wave climate [34]. In the Irpinia region, Vassallo et al. [35] observed a strong correlation between peaks in the noise PSDs and wind intensity for time windows longer than one day, thus attributing noise variations to meteorological factors. However, in hydrothermal areas, a link between seismicity and rainfall is commonly observed and correlated to phenomena such as rainfall water percolation [36\u201338]. Commonly, the RMS pattern is compared with meteorological parameter behaviors, especially rainfall, to highlight some exogenous source features. In hydrothermal systems, discharged fluids of deep origin could be significantly contaminated by shallow infiltrations, especially meteoric water (rainfall). Di Napoli et al.\u2019s [39] investigations in 2002\u20132007 at Ischia island (Italy) evidenced how the rainfall influences the dynamics of the hydrothermal system lowering CO2 emissions especially during the winter. Rainfall and seismic series from the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano (Montserrat) were analyzed by Matthews et al. [40] to investigate the exogenous forcing on the volcanic system in 2001\u20132003. The real-time seismic amplitude pattern, used as a proxy for volcanic activity, indicates that volcanic response to rainfall gradually penetrates and favors long period and hybrid earthquake nucleation. To detect possible hydrological and tidal triggers of hydrothermal and seismic activity at Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy), Petrosino et al. [41] found that the most numerous and energetic earthquake swarm occurrence in 2005\u20132016 resulted in the wet season, evidencing a strong influence of tidal and hydrological cycles. Although the relation between seismic noise and meteorological parameters is clear at Mefite site, we have to account for the considerable distance between the seismic stations and the meteorological station (11 km), which makes any interpretation only speculative at this stage. To investigate at what extent the weather conditions affect the seismic signal, in May 2022 we installed an ad hoc meteorological station close to the Mefite vents. This is a Vantage Pro 2 Wireless Davis equipped with an anemometer, a rain collector, a temperature and a humidity sensor, and a Weatherlink datalogger. It is located close to a broadband seismic station installed within the framework of the FURTHER project and will acquire data at least for a dry\u2013wet season cycle. The identification of the sources inside the noise requires the extension of the already performed analysis to all available data, as well as more detailed analyses, such as the polarization [42] that allows one to track the wavefield components inside restricted frequency bands. Unfortunately, no CO2 flux measures were performed [9] during the array functioning period, which would have permitted to directly associate the seismic wavefield components to the degassing activity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 1630 15 of 18"

Although the results are preliminary, they reveal interesting features of the noise amplitude at frequencies <5 and >5 Hz that motivate further studies for a better understanding of the dynamics of the reservoir as well as the involvement of fluids in the seismogenic processes on a regional scale. The clear link between seismic noise and CO2 emissions from a cold and thermal spring in southern Italy points out the importance of investigating in more detail the mutual interaction of seismogenic sources and fluid reservoirs at depth. Seismological analyses prove that accurate and ad hoc studies are required to understand the dynamics of a hydrothermal source such as the one at Mefite that contributes to the natural CO2 emission budget.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.M., P.C. and D.G.; methodology, S.M., P.C., D.G. and M.L.R.; validation, S.M., P.C., D.G., L.N., A.G., M.L.R., G.M., S.P. and F.D.L.; formal analysis, S.M., P.C., D.G., L.N., A.G., M.L.R., G.M. and S.P.; investigation, S.M., P.C., D.G., L.N., A.G., M.L.R., G.M., S.P. and F.D.L.; resources, S.M., P.C., D.G., G.G., L.N., P.D.G., M.L.R., G.M., R.M. and C.B.; data curation, S.M., D.G., G.G. and L.N.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.M., P.C., D.G. and F.D.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.M., P.C., D.G., G.G., L.N., P.D.G., A.G., M.L.R., G.M., S.P., L.Z., R.M., C.B. and F.D.L.; visualization, S.M., P.C., D.G., G.G., L.N., P.D.G., A.G., M.L.R., G.M., S.P., L.Z., R.M., C.B. and F.D.L.; supervision, S.M., P.C., D.G. and F.D.L.; project administration, P.C. and F.D.L.; funding acquisition, P.C.
