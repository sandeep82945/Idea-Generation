            "text": "The parent oxoborane, HBO is a compound that features boron with both a \u2013B]O and a B\u2013H functional group. This ephemeral compound has only been detected in the gas phase or by lowtemperature matrix isolation studies.1 Signicant effort has recently been focused on generating oxoborane derivatives RBO. The rst report of a B]O double bond (A) came from Cowley's group in 2005.2 Subsequently, the concept of donor/ acceptor stabilization has been successfully employed by the groups of Cui, Kinjo, Rivard, and others (Scheme 1) to generate compounds with B]O double bonds (B\u2013D).3\u20135 The groups of Aldridge and Xie were able to isolate an acid-free, anionic and neutral B]O doubly bound species, respectively (E & F).6,7 Braunschweig and coworkers adopted a different strategy for the isolation of multiply bound boron compounds by trapping them within the coordination sphere of a transition metal,8\u201310 and they were able to isolate the compounds with a B^O triple bond (G & H).11 Last year, Braunschweig and coworkers isolated a base-stabilized derivative of the parent borylene carbonyl (HB]C]O) and provided substantial evidence of the\n, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Dr India.

We demonstrated substitution reactions of 6- SIDipp$BH3, ring expansion with 6-SIDipp$9BBN, and activation of the B\u2013H bond of HBpin with 6-SIDipp.17\u201319 These studies have indicated that 6-SNHC has a notably higher donating capacity than 5-NHC. Our hypothesis was that by incorporating the 6-SNHC framework, along with bulky Dipp groups, and using a Lewis acid, we could potentially achieve the isolation of a single, parent oxoborane molecule."

However, such hydride-bridged dimer was reported by the Vedejs group by the treatment of R3N\u2013BH3 with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]21 and by Alcarazo and coworkers upon reaction with 5-IDipp$BH3 with B(C6F5)3.22 The reaction of 6-SIDipp$BH3 with 1.2 equivalent of gallium trichloride in toluene at room temperature resulted in complete disappearance of the 11B{1H} NMR quartet of 6-SIDipp$BH3 at \u221231.3 ppm (JB\u2013H = 84.1 Hz)17 and the appearance of a new multiplet at \u221227.4 ppm (JB\u2013H = 72.1 Hz), which is in good agreement with several NHC supported boronium cations.22,23 Single crystal X-ray studies conrm the constitution of 1 (Fig. 1). The B\u2013H\u2013Ga binding mode in 1 can be best described as a three-center two-electron (3c\u20132e) bond. The location of the two bridging hydrogens and a single terminal hydrogen in each could be inferred from the difference Fourier map. The C1\u2013B1 distance in 1 is 1.596(6) \u00c5, which is good agreement with that in 6-SIDipp$BH3 [1.602(3) \u00c5].17 The terminal B\u2013H bond distance [1.10(4) \u00c5] is slightly\nScheme 2 Diverse reactivity of NHC$BH3.

The B\u2013Ga distance for 1 is 2.280(5) \u00c5, which is longer than the reported B\u2013 Ga coordinate bond in HC[MeC(2,6-iPr2C6H3)N]2Ga/B(C6F5)3 [2.156(1) and 2.142(3) \u00c5],24 indicating the absence of any interaction between boron and the gallium center. The Ga\u2013H bond distance is 1.83(3) \u00c5, which is slightly shorter than in the Ga\u2013H\u2013 Ga bridges.25 The geometry of the boron atom is distorted tetrahedral, while the gallium atom adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.\nIn order to investigate the electronic structure of compound 1, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The B3LYP functional and the def2-TZVP basis set have been employed in the calculations (please see the ESI\u2020 for further details). The NBO analysis shows that there are two signicant electron donations from the BD orbital (which denotes a bonding orbital) of the B1\u2013H2 bond to the vacant s and p orbitals of gallium in 1, with stabilization energies of 24.3 kcal mol\u22121 and 27.6 kcal mol\u22121 (see Fig. S17\u2020). Similarly, the BD orbital of the second B\u2013H bond (which is identically denoted as B1\u2013H2 in Fig. 2) also shows two signicant electron donations to the vacant s and p orbitals of gallium, with identical (to that of the rst B\u2013H bond) stabilization energies of 24.3 kcal mol\u22121 and 27.6 kcal mol\u22121 (see Fig. S17\u2020). It should be noted that the NBO analysis in this case resulted in a misinterpretation of the nature of the Ga\u2013Cl bonds as ionic instead of covalent, due to the limitations in NBO in accurately locating polar bonds. Conceptually, the B\u2013H bonding orbitals can donate electron density to either an initially vacant p orbital located on Ga or to a Ga\u2013Cl s* antibonding orbital, in which the lobe is predominantly located on Ga. This corroborates the experimental observation of two identical B\u2013H bonds and also suggests a 3c\u20132e bond character in B\u2013H\u2013Ga interactions.\nBoranes have been identied as promising candidates for facilitating hydrogen release from water, as documented in several early microwave spectroscopic studies, and theoretical\nChem.

Recently, Kraka and co-workers investigated the mechanism of H2 release from BH3 in water and demonstrated that one H2O molecule interacting with BH3 led to an activation energy of 24.9 kcal mol\u22121.27\nWe have reacted 1 with 1.1 equivalent of H2O, which resulted in the formation of 2 with simultaneous elimination of dihydrogen (Scheme 3). 2 is a heterodinuclear compound that can be considered as the acid-stabilized parent oxoborane containing an unusual H(B]O) linkage. The elimination of dihydrogen was detected using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS. The amount of simultaneous hydrogen production is quite large (2.1 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121). Most importantly, the NHC moiety remained intact during the reaction, which was not the case for 5-IDipp$BH2I and 5-IDipp$BH2OTf as their reactions with water (or methanol) resulted in fast hydrolysis (or methanolysis) to the corresponding imidazolium salts.28 The 11B{1H} NMR spectrum of 2 displays a broad signal at 21.6 ppm for the B]O\nScheme 3 Stepwise synthesis of -hydrido and -hydroxy oxoboranes, 2 and 3 from the reaction of 1 with water.\n5896 | Chem.

The characteristic terminal n(B\u2013O) stretch frequency appeared at 1665 cm\u22121 for 2, which is in good agreement with the previously reported oxoboranes (1558\u2013 1646 cm\u22121).5,6\nAttempts to crystallize 2 resulted in two types of colorless single crystals: one is block shaped, and the other one is needle shaped. While the needle shaped crystals belong to 2, the block shaped crystals account for 2$GaCl3. Though the constitution and the connectivity of 2 can be unambiguously established from the single crystal X-ray data (Fig. S16, ESI\u2020), we refrain from a discussion of bonding parameters because of the low quality of the data. The molecular structure of 2$GaCl3 is displayed in Fig. 2. One of the GaCl3 molecule cocrystallizes with 2. The main feature of 2$GaCl3 is that the central boron atom has bonded to one terminal hydrogen atom and oxygen atom which is connected to the gallium center. The boron atom exhibits a highly distorted trigonal planar coordination site with the carbon atom of NHC, the hydride ligand, and the (m-O) atom. The gallium atom has a distorted tetrahedral coordination sphere comprised of the (m-O) atom and the three chloride ligands. The B\u2013H [1.09 (3) \u00c5] and B\u2013C [1.621(4) \u00c5] bond lengths compare well with their typical bond lengths. It is noted that the B]O distance in 2$GaCl3 [1.307(3) \u00c5] is in good agreement with the reported acid stabilized oxoboranes,3\u20136 slightly longer compared to Aldridge's acid free anionic oxoboranes [1.256(3) \u00c5, 1.273(8) \u00c5 and 1.287 (2) \u00c5],7 and substantially longer than Braunschweig's B^O triply bound complex.11 The Ga\u2013O bond length in 2$GaCl3 [1.807(2) \u00c5] is in good agreement with that in Roesky's Ga(Me)\u2013O\u2013Bi linkage [1.815(13) \u00c5].29\nHaving found that water undergoes facile dehydrocoupling with the bridging hydride of 1, it seemed plausible that further addition of H2O may lead to the release of another molecule of H2 and convert the terminal B\u2013H bond to a B\u2013OH bond to generate a (hydroxy)oxoborane. Gratifyingly, the reaction of 2 with another molecule of H2O led to the formation of 3 containing a B(OH)]O\u2013GaCl3 motif with concomitant elimination of H2 (Scheme 3). The NHC moiety and the (B]O)\u2013GaCl3 remained intact, while the B\u2013H bond underwent hydrolysis with H2O to generate the terminal B\u2013OH bond. 3 possesses a rare unit of [B(OH)]O], and it is the second example of a monomeric boracarboxylic acid complex that has been isolated, followed by Rivard's discovery of D.5 The [B(OH)]O] unit is transient and can only be observed in the gas phase during the thermal conversion of orthoboric acid (B(OH)3) to metaboric acid [(HOBO)3].30 The boron atom resonates at 23.6 ppm. The solid-state structure of 3 is displayed in Fig. 3. The terminal B\u2013O bond length [1.334(10) \u00c5] in 3 is very similar with the B\u2013O double bond [1.320(9)] \u00c5 as they overlap within three times of estimated standard deviation. For a note, the B\u2013O double bond in 3 is also comparable to that in 2 [1.307(3) \u00c5]. The characteristic terminal n(B]O) stretching frequency of 3 appeared at 1595 cm\u22121.\nTo investigate the electronic structure of 2 and 3, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed.

Moreover, the natural population analysis (NPA) charges on B and O were found to be +0.77 and \u22121.04, respectively, indicating a multiple bond character of the B\u2013O bond, which is polarized towards oxygen. Similarly, the Wiberg Bond Index (WBI) of the B\u2013O bond in compound 3 is 1.09, which is slightly lower than that of compound 2, indicating a weaker B\u2013O bond in compound 3. The natural population analysis (NPA) charges on B and O were determined to be +1.08 and \u22121.06, respectively. The higher positive charge on the boron atom in compound 3 is likely due to its bonding with two oxygen atoms, in contrast to one oxygen and one hydrogen in compound 2.\nFurthermore, the NBO analysis shows a signicant electron donation from the LP orbital (which denotes a lone pair orbital) of oxygen to the vacant p orbital of boron in 2, with a stabilization energy of 85.4 kcal mol\u22121 (see Fig. 4).

We accessed 2 by reacting an unusual 3c\u20132e boron\u2013gallium compound (1) with water as an oxygen source, with concomitant elimination of H2. The strong s-donation from 6-SIDipp and coordination of the B]O unit to gallium can be attributed for the stabilization of 2. Further reaction of 2 with another molecule of water resulted in a bora-carboxylic acid derivative (3), which is a monomer of metaboric acid. Investigation of the reactivity 2 and synthesis of other multiply bound boron compounds is underway in our laboratory, and will be published in due course."
