            "text": "Domain boundaries typically constitute only a minute fraction of the total volume of a crystal. However, a special (but not unusual) situation can occur in which the domain boundary energy becomes very small. Specifically, the domain size is sometimes miniaturized to near-atomic scales and the domain boundary density becomes extremely high.1\u20135 In such cases, the properties of the crystal become dominated by a combination of both the domains and the domain boundaries. In this perspective article we focus on a specific property of domain boundaries, namely that they allow much faster chemical diffusion inside domain walls than in the bulk. This makes it possible to modify the composition of domain walls without changing the composition of the bulk.6\u201310 Domain boundary dominated systems also differ from most bulk dominated materials because the motion of the domain boundaries dominates the response to external forces. Novel emergent phenomena are then expected. Typical examples for high-density domain boundaries include tweed-like structures11,12 (e.g. in morphotropic phase boundary piezoelectric crystals13,14) conventional and ferromagnetic shape memory alloys,15,16 and pre-martensitic states.17 In these materials, the properties of the twin boundaries represent the principal contributors to the functionality of the sample.\nBesides twin boundaries the effect of dislocations and surfaces for the electronic properties and conductivity has been investigated in great detail in SrTiO3 and zirconia.\n18\u201320 The effect of impurities and defects was already highlighted by several authors e.g.21,22 while in this paper we focus on the\neffect of twin boundaries while being well aware that similar developments exist for other microstructures. Even when only few twin boundaries exist in a crystal, their properties can still dominate specific applications. A typical example is the race-track technology,23 based on the controlled movement of domain walls in magnetic nanowires by short pulses of spinpolarized current. They are projected to serves as nonvolatile memory devices with the high performance and reliability of conventional solid-state memory but at the low cost of conventional magnetic disk drive storage. The racetrack memory is an array of magnetic nanowires arranged horizontally or vertically on a silicon chip with 10 to 100 domain walls per nano-wire.\nOften it is possible to isolate the domain boundary-related properties from bulk properties also in non-magnetic materials. Such emerging local properties include highly conducting interfaces,24,25 polarity,26 memory effects,27 photovoltaic signals,28,29 domain wall transistors,30 superconducting domain walls for Josephson junctions,31 memristor devices in neuromorphic computation,32 and creating pliable materials with highly reduced elastic stiffnesses of otherwise hard materials, such as special alloys.33 Several of these features were already predicted in 201034 and these ideas were expanded in 2022.35 In fact, it seems that we are at the verge of developments that could result in tailoring functional properties for a desired outcome. The term \u2018domain boundary engineering\u2019 was first coined for this endeavour, which describes particularly the design of novel chemical properties inside twin boundaries that are not the properties of the domains. An additional feature of domain boundary engineering, which only came to light during the last decade, is that their dynamics differs greatly from predictions of continuous processes like the drift of domains under a constant field. This idea was already understood in the development of \u2018Barkhausen jumps\u2019 in magnetic materials but was revived to great depth by the a Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

In domain dominated system the concrete origin of such noise is the sudden movement of domain walls37 which is directly correlated with the dynamics behaviour of avalanches.38 Defects play a crucial role in such domain movements, and we will discuss this aspect below.\nLooking forward, domain boundaries offer hence an important aspect for enhancing the properties of the bulk and create unique properties where the twin boundary is the device (and not the bulk).\nIn this perspective article, the focus is on the chemical modifications of twin boundaries. Two main properties of twin boundaries are at the core of the argument. Firstly, a domain wall cannot just stop in the middle of a crystal. Any domain wall ends at an interface or the surface of the crystal, join with another domain wall (forming a needle domain or a 901 configuration in ferroelastics), or on itself (forming a bubble domain). Domain walls are nanoscopically thin and macroscopically long, providing a continuous path between different interfaces of a crystal irrespective of how big the crystal is. This \u2018\u2018topologically protected\u2019\u2019 percolation path is most useful for transport applications.39\u201341 Secondly, domain walls are mobile; they shift their position as domains grow or shrink in response to external fields. This mobility sets domain walls apart from other types of interfaces as the required fields are usually very weak.42\u201344 The high mobility means that domain walls need not only be regarded as just a transport medium but also as a \u2018\u2018container\u2019\u2019 of chemical compounds that can itself be moved into and out of specific nano-scale locations, carrying with it whatever wall-specific physical property is of interest, such as, e.g. internal magnetization or polarization.45 Such processes may be relevant to medical applications46 where field induced healing processes may occur in bones. Twin boundaries can also be preferential sites for precipitation of new phases.47,48 It is the purpose of this paper to briefly discuss the multitude of issues related with abovementioned functionalities of domain walls:\n\u2013 Transport of dopants and intrinsic defects along immobile twin boundaries (their transport applications);\n\u2013 Container-type behaviour of the twin boundaries; \u2013 Transport of dopants and intrinsic defects by moving twin boundaries. A large body of theoretical work relates to the transport in networks as described in this paper. It is generally accepted that diffusing ions migrate along a network of sites that have different energies and that are separated by configuration dependent activation barriers as considered in ref. 49 using first-principles calculation of the diffusion coefficient in solids exhibiting configurational disorder. The formalism involves the implementation of a local cluster expansion to describe the configuration dependence of activation barriers. Local cluster expansions were used to obtain the activation barrier for migration in any configuration. A study of the activation barriers in LiCoO2 within the local density approximation shows that the migration mechanism and activation barriers depend strongly\non the local lithium-vacancy arrangement around the migrating lithium ion.50 The strain effect for oxygen anion diffusivity in Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) was calculated\n51 by density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) methods. These authors found that the oxygen diffusivity exhibits an exponential increase up to a critical value of tensile strain. At the strain states higher than the critical strain, the diffusivity decreases. This is attributed to the local relaxations at large strain states beyond a limit of elastic bond strain, resulting in the strengthening of the local oxygen\u2013cation bonds that increases the migration barrier. In this article we use simple Landau\u2013Ginzburg approaches for the structure of the domain walls and their effect on defect migration. We refer the reader for further information to other reviews of more technical coverage on charged domain walls,52 other topological structures in ferroics53,54 and details on the interplay of ferroelectric and magnetic domain walls in multiferroics.55\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. First, the experimental methods, mostly the acoustic properties, which are especially sensitive to the mobility of twin boundaries, will be introduced in Section 2. The most relevant basic ingredients of dopant/intrinsic defect interactions with twin boundaries will be mentioned in Section 3. Finally, ideas and examples of applications of twin boundaries for different modes of transport of dopants will be given in Section 4."

            "text": "Our main interest is the segregation of the dopants onto twin boundaries and the twin boundary motion, especially together with segregated dopants or other localized lattice defects.\nTwo strategies to observe and characterize the segregation of dopants and intrinsic defects onto twin boundaries are commonly used. The first employs measurements of bulk property which are sensitive to the concentration of point defects (e.g. electrical conductivity, positron annihilation, optical methods, internal friction studies). The downside of this approach is that it does not seem to be reliable when only a small fraction of defects interact with twin boundaries and when materials contain several types of defects. The second way is to characterize the properties of twin boundaries directly by methods sensitive to their state, including direct observations by means of various types of microscopy. Once it is established that twin boundaries move, their position can be determined by optical inspection56,57 or by atomic force microscopy, AFM.58 Using direct observations, the twin boundary patterns can be established, usually by standard micro-manipulators.\nA parameter directly related to the movement of twin boundaries is the anelastic strain. If a periodic stress is applied to a twinned crystal, moving twin boundaries provoke apparent modulus softening (modulus defect) and absorption of elastic energy (internal friction). Studying of these parameters, e.g. in ferroics, is the subject of so-called \u2018mechanical spectroscopy\u2019.59 The motion of twin boundaries is hindered by the dopants or\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Often non-linearity exclusively relates to domain walls and then serves as a highly selective method of tracking domain wall dynamics.\nTo measure the pinning power of the dopants and investigate the change of the internal structure of the twin boundaries, several spectroscopic techniques were previously developed. Among these methods are Resonance Ultrasonic Spectroscopy (RUS),60\u201362 Resonant Piezoelectric Spectroscopy (RPS),62 and Acoustic Emission Spectroscopy (AE) [ref. 63\u201366]. In all three cases an external force is applied to a sample, either as a weak mechanical force in form of acoustic waves in RUS, a weak electric force to interact with local sample polarities in RPS, or strong mechanical, electrical or magnetic forces in AE, which lead to moving domain boundaries on a much larger scale. When domain boundaries clash with defects, other domain boundaries or surfaces, they emit acoustic signals in AE. In contrast to RUS and RPS, the Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Composite Oscillator Technique (PUCOT)67\u201369 is a method of continuous scanning the dynamics of the twin boundaries over a wide range of oscillatory stresses, covering several orders of magnitude. Linear and non-linear responses of twin boundaries and the transition between them can be studied in detail by this technique. Some typical experimental arrangements are shown in Fig. 1.\nVery promising for future studies of domain wall dynamics is the Acoustic Coupling Technique (ACT).68 ACT consists of the simultaneous application of low-frequency periodic bias stresses and pulse-echo ultrasonic measurements of the absorption and elastic modulus defect. This method was initially developed to identify different modes of interaction between dopants and dislocations: it yields absorption characteristics of various mechanisms that impede the motion of dislocations such as Peierls relief, dopant pinning, depinning and dragging of defects at sufficiently high temperatures.68 Another possible novel way to pursue in spectroscopy experiments can be a combination of the PUCOT and RPS to study the intrinsic and domain wall-related polarization over a wide range of applied stresses. This method proved to be efficient in ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials71,72 where it is referred to as mechanomagnetic spectroscopy.73"

            "text": "We focus on atomic scale obstacles such as dopants, intrinsic defects, and Peierls relief and will not discuss the interactions of twin boundaries with heterophase inclusions, tweed, dislocations, and effects of phonon viscosity. First, one may ask why twin walls are not (always) pinned by the lattice Peierls potential. Computer simulations have shown that pinning by the crystal lattice is possible if the twin boundaries are extremely thin but that Peierls pinning disappears when the wall thickness is comparable to or larger than the lattice spacings when the twin boundaries slide through the crystal lattice with very little interaction.74,75 A key indicator for pinning is, thus, the thickness of twin boundaries. Most ferroelastic walls are too thick to experience the Peierls effect so that dopants and defects become the main pinners. Model calculations were undertaken by He et al.76 using a generic ferroelastic model where the double well Landau potential is represented by anharmonic and harmonic springs between atoms (Fig. 2). The potential for these simulations is composed of the nearest neighbour interaction UNN = 20 (r 1)2 (0.8 o r o 1.2), the second nearest neighbour interaction is a Landau spring with UNNN = 10 (r 21/2)2 + 2000 (r 21/2)4 (1.207 o r o 1.621) and the third nearest neighbour interaction UNNNN = (r 2)4 (1.8 o r o 2.2), where r is the relevant inter-atomic distance.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The energy range is rather large even in the same material because twin boundaries are not homogeneous. They contain topological defects like kinks and junctions between domain\nboundaries. Three configurations are shown in Fig. 3 whereby the interatomic distances in a simple monoatomic lattice are calibrated to be 0.1 nm per unit cell. The twin boundaries potentials decay to the bulk value after distances slightly larger than one unit cell while kink energies extend to 42 unit cells and junction energies to 44 unit cells. The local strains are more delocalized (Fig. 3a). The binding energy for vacancies at twin boundaries, kinks and junctions are DEVa-TB = 0.014 eV, DEVa-kink = 0.051 eV and DEVa-junction = 0.114 eV at the core of the defects (r = 0) as simulated for a simple model by He et al.76 Thermal movements overcome the binding energies at sufficiently high temperatures (Fig. 3c). The relevant temperature scale is given by the background relaxation77 where the stress induced domain relaxation follows a Vogel\u2013 Fulcher relaxation over a very wide temperature interval. The simulations76 show that wall attractions disappear at temperatures above 3TVF. As a typical example, the Vogel\u2013Fulcher temperature in LaAlO3 is ca. 230 K so that the wall attraction is no longer relevant above 700 K which is well below the phase transition temperature of 813 K.78 The calculated binding energies of vacancies and domain boundaries are of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by experiments and density functional theory (DFT). For example, the binding\nFig. 2 Interatomic potential for generic ferroelastic toy-model.

(b) The variation of binding energy of vacancy at twin boundary, kink and junction as a function to the core site of corresponding defects. The binding energy is defined as the potential energy difference of a vacancy at the twin boundary, kink and junction sites and the reference in the bulk. Specifically, the binding energies at the core position of defects are DEVa-TB = 0.014 eV (green data), DEVa-kink = 0.051 eV (blue and red data), and DEVa-junction = 0.114 eV (grey, purple and black data) at r = 0 \u00c5, respectively. Due to the orientation-dependent distribution of the binding energy, we show the change of DEVa-kink along 01 and 451 directions, and DEVa-junction along 01, 451 and 1201 directions.

Similar binding energies of oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 are 23 meV and 299 meV, respectively.\n81 The equivalent twin boundary energies range between 10 mJ m 2 and 300 mJ m 2 for most twinned materials with wall thicknesses of a few nanometers.82\nA compilation of wall thicknesses and energies of twin boundaries is found in ref. 83. These two energies are very similar for simple models (1 eV = 1.6 10 19 J, i.e. wall energies are 16 J m 2 if the wall is one atomic diameter thick), so that the dopants do not change the absolute values of wall energies too much. The relevant mechanism is hence the pinning of domain boundary movements rather than the increase of the effective mass of defects in a twin boundary. The vacancy concentration rVA in domain boundaries (=number of vacancy positions relative to the total number of atoms) for a total vacancy concentration of 500 ppm diminishes with temperature (Fig. 4). The ratio decreases to B2.45 at T = 0.8TVF, indicating that twin boundaries only weakly trap vacancies at high temperatures while the trapping is very strong at low temperatures."

Pinning and de-pinning decrease and increase the total energy of a sample. The energy loss due to de-pinning can be measured as internal friction (IF). The dissipated energy of mechanical oscillations eventually transforms into the energy of phonons. Macroscopically, the ballistic movement\nof rather complex domain patterns is dominated by the progression and retraction of needle domains and, for larger forces, by the sideways movement of twin walls.83\nThe efficiency of dopant or intrinsic defect transport by moving twin boundaries depends on several factors: temperature, applied stress and frequency in case of periodic excitation. Detailed experimental data for SrTiO3\n84 are used to construct a schematic temperature\u2013stress amplitude \u2018\u2018phase diagram\u2019\u2019 of pinning\u2013depinning\u2013dragging modes of twin boundary-dopant interactions and find the conditions for efficient defect transport by twin boundaries.

On cooling, twin boundaries become gradually pinned since obstacles become less mobile and cannot be dragged by twin boundaries. The depinning is characterized by the nonlinearity of the strain amplitude dependence, Fig. 6b and c. Between 80 and 40 K the critical depinning strain amplitude decreases notably from 4 10 7 to ca. 10 7. Limited ability of twin boundaries to move obstacles at lower temperatures is the origin of the strain amplitude hysteresis when the damping during increasing and decreasing strain amplitude do not coincide. Another characteristic feature of dragging\u2013depinning mode is the macroscopically jerky damping behaviour beyond depinning strain amplitude, Fig. 6b and c. At even lower temperatures the boundaries move collectively due to stronger wall\u2013wall couplings. These regimes are called, depending on the strength of the interactions, either a quantum domain glass or a quantum domain solid.84 The transition to the glassy state is marked, firstly, by an abrupt switch from jerky to continuous domain dynamics. Secondly, the low-amplitude range of linear (independent of strain amplitude) anelastic response disappears, Fig. 6c and d. The damping below 40 K is nonlinear over the entire strain amplitude range down to 2 10 8. This property is typical for glassy dynamics90,91 due to divergence of the barrier height with decreasing strain amplitudes.92,93 The observed onset of the glassy dynamics coincides with the high polarity of the twin boundaries and the onset of the glassy twin dynamics seen by electric field driven experiments.32 Data from Fig. 5 and 6 are used to construct a \u2018\u2018pinning\u2013 depinning\u2013dragging\u2019\u2019 stress amplitude-temperature phase diagram,94 Fig. 7. The temperature T-stress amplitude s0 plane is separated by a dotted vertical line at a temperature T = T1 into two temperature domains wherein the dopants or intrinsic defects are immobile and start to move together with twin boundaries. The position of this line is frequency-dependent. The solid line divided into Sections I\u2013IV shows the variation of the frequency-dependent critical depinning stress with temperature. Small lower panels show selected strain amplitude dependences of damping from Fig. 6 representative of each mode of twin boundary motion. Sections IV and III fall within the range of transport of dopants/intrinsic defects by twin boundaries. The most efficient transport occurs below the critical depinning stress in Section IV of pure dragging. It is quite remarkable that, over the range of transport by pure dragging, twin boundary dynamics remains linear and no depinning occurs. That is, the pure dragging range corresponds to the unusual increase of the critical depinning stress with temperature. In domain III of dragging\u2013depinning stage, the motion of dopants with twin boundaries is intermittent of the stick-slip type. Of course, new portions of defects participate in each stick-slip event. Dragging-depinning mode can be activated at rather low temperatures.

The typical values for moving twin walls are between the mean field values 4/3 and 5/3 and values close to 2 in martensitic compounds.37 Besides energies, other avalanche parameters, like their amplitudes, durations and aftershock probabilities can be derived from experimental observations.37 Defects delay the domain boundary movements so that the avalanche related translational motion of twin boundaries dominates when the pinning potential is strong: the periods of rather low-velocity slow twin boundary motion are intercalated with jumps in avalanches. Slowly moving twin boundaries can then accumulate dopants during the intervals of their slow motion but leave the defects behind once the jump is activated (and often at the jump position, Fig. 10). An important consequence of the intermittence of the twin boundary motion in complex structures is the heterogeneous distribution of dopants in the volume swept by twin boundaries. This feature is crucial for the formation of large number of nanoprecipitates through low-temperature ageing, for example in Ni\u2013Ti.100,101"

The memristor-type formation of filaments inducing conduction spikes near a percolation point105\u2013107 can, potentially, be replaced by injected ions in domain walls. This has several advantages.

Moreover, ferroelectric walls and highly conducting walls can help to overcome the bottleneck between memory and synaptic data transfer. Neuromorphic computers imitate the functionality of brain neurons and connecting synapses, where the synapses combine logical operations with memory effects. For this purpose, the dual functionality of the domain walls may be the key ingredient. Injected defects can stop transport currents in domain walls. Furthermore, synapses are dynamical elements, which is also the case for mobile domain walls.\nThe path of the electrical current can be switched at the percolation point. The percolation point is modified by shifting the position of the domain wall or of defects, which blocks the transport of atoms along the domain walls. Defect movements by electric fields can greatly change the ionic current.108 The changes occur rapidly because the wall movements proceed by jerks which are extremely fast.109 Equally, the connection and the blocking of atomic transport can occur over extremely short time intervals.33,110\u2013112 The work by Sharma et al.110 is particularly important and gives much hope for future developments. These authors demonstrated that by using nanofabricated electrodes and scanning probe techniques, a prototypic nonvolatile ferroelectric memory element can be constructed which is entirely based on the transport inside domain boundaries. The element was scalable to below 100 mm. The binary memory element is the conductivity which is present or absent in the boundary. They demonstrated that the device could be read non-destructively at less than 3 V with an on\u2013off ratio of B1000.\nMuch work has been directed into such use of ferroelectric domain boundary engineering in neuromorphic computation over the last decade, but several key issues remain obscure. First, ferroelectric and ferroelastic domains and domain walls generate many complex domain patterns113 so that choosing\nthe most appropriate domain configuration and producing it reproducibly is extremely challenging. Each domain boundary may carry specific chemical loading, which can be tailored to change the percolation point for the memristive carrier transport. Even additional magnetic interactions, generated by the polar and rough domain boundaries, have been postulated114 but not confirmed experimentally. Ion transport, some examples. Not all domain walls are fast ionic connectors (such as the case of quartz where the c-axis transport in the twin wall is slower than in the bulk7) while in most cases they are. CaTiO3 is a good example of a perovskite material which contains oxygen vacancies. The trapping energies for oxygen vacancies were determined in ref. 6 and 9 for all potential wall positions and compared with the bulk. It was found that the defects have local potential energies which are ca. 0.8 eV lower than the bulk potentials so that even without external forces, the oxygen vacancies accumulate in the twin boundaries. Under sufficiently strong external electric fields, the accumulated defects will then move along the twin boundaries.\nNie et al. have shown that the presence of (10%1) twin boundaries in anode SnO2 nanowires strongly enhances lithiation processes.99 The presence of twins changes the scenario of lithiation through the enhancement of lattice strain and formation of Sn vacancies at the twin boundary. This potential application is an example of smart domain engineering of electrodes for high-rate batteries."

The vapour covers the sample surface and penetrates the sample along the domain boundaries. The sample is then cleaved to eliminate the surface-near regions and the Na content is measured using a microprobe (right). Very strong enrichment of Na is seen at the twin boundaries. No significant difference between the two domain boundary types was observed.\nThe same experiment was undertaken by heating the sample for several hours which lead to loss of oxygen. The outwards diffusion of oxygen was strongest along the twin boundaries.115 The ease with which boundaries can be doped suggests that samples which were subjected to vapour or liquid with different chemical compositions are, in their majority, doped. This situation is likely to be widely encountered in minerals in a metamorphic environment116 so that geochemical characterisation of global chemical compositions can be misleading. A better way to determine compositional characterizations for geochronological processes would be to analyse the dopants in twin boundaries. Alas, this has not yet been done because of technical difficulties to restrict the chemical analysis to small enough regions in the crystal. Future work in this field is highly desirable. On the other hand, so-called \u2018ghost domain walls\u2019 have been well documented.117 They occur when external forces are applied to material which are strong enough to move the twin boundaries. In some cases, the moving boundary leaves the segregated dopants behind as a \u2018ghost\u2019 wall, which is easily seen in transmission electron microscopy.\nPreferential precipitation along habit plane twin boundaries in martensitic alloys. Castro et al.47 studied precipitation in a Cu\u2013Zn\u2013Al martensitic shape memory alloy. Samples quenched into the low temperature twinned martensitic phase inherit high concentration of vacancies which promote diffusion. If quenched samples are aged in the high-temperature cubic phase, preferential precipitation is found along the positions of habit plane twin boundaries in the martensitic phase. This is an indication that nuclei of precipitates are formed in the twinned martensitic phase in habit plane twin boundaries."

If deformation proceeds in the temperature interval wherein dopants or intrinsic defects can be dragged by twin boundaries, classical strain ageing effects can be observed. In order to detect strain ageing, measurements of linear and non-linear internal friction were performed in situ during deformation of quenched Cu\u2013Al\u2013Ni single crystals in the martensitic twinned state.118 Measurements in situ during deformation show jerky non-linear response of the crystal with strain-rate dependent critical depinning strain amplitude.\nKinetic stabilization of martensite. Examples of accumulation of dopants or intrinsic defects by moving twin boundaries can be extended to interphase boundaries moving during first\norder ferroelastic transitions. In quenched martensitic alloys with high density of quenched-in defects, the one-time effect similar to strain ageing in twinned structures is then transformed into blocking of the conventional thermoelastic transition into the high-temperature phase or stabilization of martensite.119,120 This stabilization mode is found in Cu-based martensites and is referred to as kinetic stabilization.121 A necessary condition for intense kinetic stabilization is a high defect density, rather high phase transformation temperatures and low heating rates to activate the accumulation of defects.\nPhase transition induced ageing effect. Dragging of vacancies or substitutional defects by interphase boundaries can affect functionality of the widely used Ni\u2013Ti alloys. Conventional bulk diffusion in NiTi is negligible17 at ambient temperature. However, diffusion assistance by moving interphase boundaries can activate ageing at ambient temperature and affect functional properties of working elements suppressing the direct martensitic transformation.48,100,101 This lowtemperature ageing is thus a consequence of thermal cycling across the phase transition range where the activation of ageing requires thermal cycling with a low rate to permit defectassisted diffusion. Strong ageing near martensitic transformation temperatures implies the creation of a large number of nanoscale precipitates. The high density of nuclei of precipitates is formed in the volume of a crystal due to the intermittent avalanche-like nature of the martensitic transformation.65,66 A schematic model of thermal cycling and ageing is shown in Fig. 13. Initial quenching creates a homogeneous distribution of vacancies and substitutional atoms, Fig. 13a, since the quenching rate is high. During phase transitions, interphase boundaries capture defects in those parts of the crystal where the motion of boundaries is slow. Segregated defects are left behind moving boundary when the boundary participates in an avalanche-like displacement, Fig. 13b. Segregated defects detached from the boundaries form nanoprecipitates during low-temperature ageing through short-range diffusion, Fig. 13c."

They also constitute reservoirs of dopants which are enriched in the twin boundaries relative to the bulk. Once a specific twin pattern is generated, it serves as template for chemical doping where boundaries are structurally and chemically very different from the bulk material. This can be the starting point for self-generated device structures where both the domain structure and the subsequent doping are equilibrium structures under appropriate boundary conditions.\nWe argue here that moving domain boundaries can be used as carriers to move dopants through a sample. Device materials can hence be modified, and dopants can be transported to assigned locations.

The useful interval for applicable strain rates is hence the intermediate interval which is easily accessible in most applications. Such applications extend from material sciences, medical applications to geochemistry and metamorphic petrology.\nApplications are still hampered by experimental limitations, although much progress was made during the last decade. Further developments may include promising approaches, like the Acoustic Coupling Technique68 to identify specific mechanisms of interaction of moving twin boundaries with dopants\nand intrinsic defects or the PUCOT69 + RPS60 technique to study non-linear dynamics of polarized domain walls. Insight into the atomic mechanism was initially based on simple analytical models. Great progress was made by the development of simple toy models where the local mechanisms can be studied in systems with some 100 000 particles.122\u2013124 Future work needs now to extend the models to more realistic interatomic potentials and larger simulation boxes.
