It has\nbeen reported that orlistat, an anti-obesity drug, inhibits the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate, a common substrate of the major drug-metabolizing hydrolases, carboxylesterase (CES) 1, CES2, and arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC), in vitro. The aim of this study was to examine whether orlistat affects the pharmacokinetics of drug(s) metabolized by hydrolases in vivo, after evaluating its inhibitory potencies against CES1, CES2, and AADAC in vitro. Orlistat potently inhibited the hydrolysis of acebutolol, a specific substrate of CES2, in a non-competitive manner (Ki = 2.95 \u00b1 0.16 nM), whereas it slightly inhibited the hydrolysis of temocapril and eslicarbazepine acetate, specific substrates of CES1 and AADAC, respectively (IC50 > 100 nM). The in vivo DDI potential was elucidated using mice, in which orlistat showed strong inhibition against acebutolol hydrolase activities in the liver and intestinal microsomes, similar to humans. The AUC of acebutolol was increased by 43%, whereas the AUC of acetolol, a hydrolyzed metabolite of acebutolol, was decreased by 47% by co-administration of orlistat. The ratio of the Ki value to the maximum unbound plasma concentration of orlistat (< 0.012) is lower than the risk criteria for DDI in the liver defined by the FDA guideline (> 0.02), whereas the ratio of the Ki value to the estimated intestinal luminal concentration (3.3 \u00d7 105) is considerably higher than the risk criteria in the intestine (> 10). Therefore, this suggests that orlistat causes DDI by inhibiting hydrolases in the intestine.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n4"

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "Drug-drug interactions (DDI) are classified into pharmacokinetic interactions and\npharmacodynamic interactions. Both types of DDI could affect drug efficacy and toxicity (Palleria et al., 2013). Pharmacokinetic interactions account for approximately half of the DDI observed in clinics, 68% of which are related to drug metabolism (Tesfaye and Nedi, 2017). Cytochrome P450 (P450) is involved in the metabolism of 60% of clinical drugs (Fukami et al., 2022), and most of the DDI associated with drug metabolism are caused by inhibition or induction of P450s (Palleria et al., 2013). Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have guidelines for assessment of the risk of DDI via inhibition or induction of P450s in the development of new chemical entities and require that clinical trials for DDI be conducted as needed.\nBecause P450s have large interindividual differences in enzymatic activity and the\npotential for DDI, an increasing number of drugs designed to avoid metabolism by P450s have been developed in recent years. Consequently, the contribution of non-P450 enzymes to drug metabolism tends to increase. Hydrolases are responsible for the metabolism of over 25% of clinical drugs, showing the highest contribution to drug metabolism among all non-P450s (Fukami et al., 2022). Carboxylesterase (CES) 1, CES2, and arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) play major roles in the hydrolysis of drugs. For example, CES1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of temocapril (an anti-hypertensive drug) and oseltamivir (an anti-influenza drug) (Takai et al., 1997; Shi et al., 2006), CES2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of irinotecan (an anticancer drug) and acebutolol (an anti-hypertensive and anti-arrhythmic drug) (Sanghani et al., 2004; Muta et al., 2015), and AADAC catalyzes the hydrolysis of rifampicin (antibiotics) and eslicarbazepine acetate (an anti-epileptic drug) (Nakajima et al., 2011; Hirosawa et al., 2021). CES1 is predominantly expressed in the liver, whereas CES2 and AADAC are expressed in the small intestine as well as the liver (Watanabe et al., 2009). Although several drugs that inhibit the enzymatic activities of these drug-metabolizing\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n6\nhydrolases have been identified by in vitro studies (Quinney et al., 2005; Fukami et al., 2010; Shimizu et al., 2014), their effects on the pharmacokinetics of victim drugs in vivo have not been evaluated.\nPatients with lifestyle diseases such as obesity and hypertension have an increased risk for DDI because they often take multiple medications. Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug that reduces lipid absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase in the gastrointestinal tract. It has been reported that orlistat inhibits the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate, a common substrate of the above drug-metabolizing hydrolases, in human liver microsomes (Xiao et al., 2013). In addition, our previous study clarified that orlistat inhibits the hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate (an anti-prostate cancer drug), a specific substrate of AADAC (Sakai et al., 2021). However, whether orlistat causes DDI at clinical doses has not been evaluated in vivo as with other inhibitors for hydrolases as described above.\nThe aim of this study was to examine whether orlistat affects the pharmacokinetics of\ndrug(s) metabolized by hydrolases in vivo, after evaluating its inhibitory potencies against CES1, CES2, and AADAC in vitro.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n7"

As shown in Fig. 1, the acebutolol hydrolase activity by recombinant CES2 was potently inhibited by orlistat (IC50 = 2.64 \u00b1 0.45 nM), whereas the temocapril and eslicarbazepine acetate hydrolase activities by recombinant CES1 and AADAC, respectively, remained more than 50% even at 100 nM orlistat. These results suggest that orlistat potently inhibits human CES2."

This type of inhibition is also called time-dependent inhibition (TDI) because the IC50 value is decreased by the pre-incubation of enzymes and inhibitors. The IC50 shift assay (Lee and Kim, 2013) was performed to determine whether the mechanism by which orlistat inhibits human CES2 is TDI. For evaluation of TDI, the substrate concentrations are recommended to be more than 4 times higher than the Km value because this condition minimizes reversible inhibition by inhibitors or their metabolites. Accordingly, the substrate concentration was set at 50 mM, which is considerably higher than the Km value. As shown in Fig. 2A, the IC50 value of orlistat against acebutolol hydrolase activity by recombinant CES2 was not changed\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n15\nfrom 0-min to 30-min pre-incubation (from 2.18 \u00b1 0.29 to 1.91 \u00b1 0.12 nM), indicating that the mechanism by which orlistat inhibits human CES2 is direct inhibition, not TDI.\nThen, to elucidate the inhibition mechanism, a kinetic analysis of acebutolol hydrolase\nactivity in the presence of orlistat was performed (Figs. 2B and C). The Km value was almost unchanged by orlistat, whereas the Vmax value was decreased by orlistat in a concentration-dependent manner (Table 1). This result suggests that the mechanism by which orlistat inhibits human CES2 is non-competitive inhibition, and the Ki value was calculated to be 2.95 \u00b1 0.16 nM.\nOrlistat Inhibits the Hydrolysis of Irinotecan and Ampiroxicam.\nTo investigate whether the inhibition of human CES2-catalyzing hydrolysis by orlistat is\nnot acebutolol specific, the inhibition potencies of orlistat against the hydrolysis of irinotecan (Sanghani et al., 2004) and ampiroxicam (Hirosawa et al., in preparation), other CES2 substrates, were evaluated (Fig. 3). Similar to the results in acebutolol hydrolysis, the hydrolysis of both irinotecan and ampiroxicam by recombinant CES2 was potently inhibited by orlistat (IC50 = 3.31 \u00b1 0.95 and 0.75 \u00b1 0.20 nM, respectively), indicating that orlistat inhibits hydrolysis by CES2 regardless of the substrate."

            "text": "To determine the appropriate animal species for evaluating the DDI between acebutolol\nand orlistat in vivo, species differences in the inhibitory effects of orlistat were examined. The inhibitory effects of orlistat on acebutolol hydrolase activities in the liver and intestinal microsomes from mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, which are frequently used for in vivo studies in drug development, were compared with those from humans (Fig. 5). The control activities in the liver and intestinal microsomes from each animal species are shown in Table 2. In humans, the acebutolol hydrolase activity in the intestinal microsomes was higher than that in the liver microsomes, while in mice, rats, and dogs, the activities in the intestinal microsomes were lower than those in the liver microsomes (Table 2). The activity in dog intestinal microsomes was below the limit of quantitation (< 3 pmol/min/mg protein). The acebutolol hydrolase activities in human liver (IC50 = 19.73 \u00b1 1.22 nM) and intestinal (IC50 = 4.12 \u00b1 0.07 nM) microsomes were potently inhibited by orlistat (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the activities in mouse liver (IC50 = 3.61 \u00b1 0.42 nM) and intestinal (IC50 = 1.70 \u00b1 0.15 nM) microsomes were potently inhibited (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effects of orlistat on the activities in rat liver and intestinal microsomes were relatively weak, and the activities remained more than 50% even at 100 nM orlistat (Fig. 5C). The activity in dog (Fig. 5D) and monkey (Fig. 5E) liver microsomes was not inhibited by orlistat (Fig. 5D). Accordingly, the DDI between acebutolol and orlistat in vivo was evaluated using mice in a subsequent study.\nOrlistat Increases the Exposure of Acebutolol in vivo.\nAlthough several drugs including telmisartan and loperamide have been reported to inhibit\nhuman CES2 in vitro (Quinney et al., 2005; Shimizu et al., 2014), there are no reports that these inhibitors have altered the pharmacokinetics of CES2 substrates at clinical doses in vivo. It is possible that orlistat affects the pharmacokinetics of victims (CES2 substrates) in vivo because of its lower Ki value than those of other CES2 inhibitors, which are on the order of \u00b5M.

Because acebutolol is hydrolyzed to acetolol and then acetylated to diacetolol (Fig. 6A), plasma concentrations of acebutolol and its two metabolites were measured. The plasma concentration of acebutolol was significantly increased by co-administration of orlistat, resulting in a 43% increase in the AUC (from 2.70 \u00b1 1.01 to 3.85 \u00b1 1.42 \u00b5g \u00d7 hr/mL) (Fig. 6B; Table 3). The plasma concentrations of acetolol and diacetolol were significantly decreased by co-administration of orlistat, resulting in 47% (from 3.89 \u00b1 0.70 to 2.04 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b5g \u00d7 hr/mL) and 28% (from 2.74 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 0.46 \u00d7 106 to 1.96 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 0.49 \u00d7 106 peak area \u00d7 hr) decreases in the AUC, respectively (Figs. 6C and D; Table 3).

            "text": "DDI has a significant impact on the efficacy and safety of drugs. Although several\ncompounds have been demonstrated to inhibit drug-metabolizing hydrolases by in vitro studies (Fukami et al., 2010; Shimizu et al., 2014), an in vivo risk assessment has not been conducted. Patients with lifestyle diseases such as obesity and hypertension have an increased risk for DDI because they often take multiple medications. It has been reported that orlistat inhibits the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol acetate, a common substrate of CES1, CES2, and AADAC, in human liver microsomes with an IC50 value of approximately 50 nM (Xiao et al., 2013), and abiraterone acetate, a specific substrate of AADAC, in recombinant human AADAC with an IC50 value of 1.2 nM (Sakai et al., 2021). In this study, the inhibitory potencies of the anti-obesity drug orlistat on the major drug-metabolizing hydrolases, CES1, CES2, and AADAC, were compared in vitro, and the effects on the pharmacokinetics of a victim drug in vivo were evaluated.\nOrlistat potently inhibited human CES2 among the major drug-metabolizing hydrolases,\nCES1, CES2, and AADAC (Fig. 1). Xiao et al. (2013) reported that the inhibition potency of orlistat on p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolase activity by recombinant human CES2 was stronger than that by recombinant human CES1, which is consistent with the results of this study. Our previous study revealed that human AADAC-catalyzing hydrolase activity for abiraterone acetate is potently inhibited by orlistat (IC50 = 1.2 nM; Sakai et al., 2021). However, in this study, eslicarbazepine acetate hydrolase activity by recombinant human AADAC was hardly inhibited by 100 nM orlistat (Fig. 1). The hydrolase activities of other AADAC substrates, flutamide and ketoconazole, were also not inhibited by 100 nM orlistat (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitory effects of orlistat on human AADAC appear to be specific to abiraterone acetate among substrates, although further study is needed. It is conceivable that orlistat might reduce the accessibility of abiraterone acetate to AADAC by causing conformational changes in AADAC. Molecular docking of orlistat with AADAC and its substrates to examine changes in accessibility may demonstrate this hypothesis.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n19\nThe inhibitory pattern of orlistat against human CES2-catalyzing acebutolol hydrolase\nactivity was non-competitive inhibition (Ki = 2.95 \u00b1 0.16 nM, Fig. 2), indicating that orlistat binds to sites other than the substrate pocket of the CES2 protein. Orlistat has an alanine structure as with sofosbuvir (an anti-hepatitis C virus drug) and remdesivir (an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug), which are other potent inhibitors of CES2 with IC50 values against p-nitrophenyl acetate and/or 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate hydrolase activity on the nM order (Shen and Yan, 2017; Shen et al., 2021); therefore, the structure may be key for the inhibition of CES2. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that cetilistat, which does not have the alanine structure, did not inhibit CES2 (Fig. 4). Upon developing new chemical entities containing alanine in the structures, the potential for CES2 inhibition may need to be evaluated.\nIn our previous study, acebutolol hydrolysis was clarified to be primarily catalyzed by\nCES2 in humans (Muta et al., 2015), but the responsible enzyme(s) in the other animal species are unknown. According to the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/), CES2 in humans, dogs, or monkeys is a unigene, whereas there are multiple isoforms in mice (Ces2a\u2013c, Ces2e\u2013h) and rats (Ces2a, Ces2c, Ces2e, Ces2g\u2013j) (Holmes et al., 2010). In addition, tissue distributions of CES2 are different between animal species as follows: in humans, mice, and monkeys, CES2 protein is expressed in both the liver and intestine, whereas it is expressed only in the intestine in rats and hardly expressed in both the liver and intestine in dogs (Taketani et al., 2007; Satoh and Hosokawa, 2010; Yoshida et al., 2018). Like in humans, acebutolol hydrolase activities in mouse liver and intestinal microsomes were inhibited by orlistat (Figs. 5A and B). Mouse Ces2c is recognized as an ortholog of human CES2 (Eisner et al., 2022), but amino acid homology is not as high (71%), and whether Ces2c catalyzes acebutolol needs to be examined using the expression system. Although rat Ces2 is not expressed in the liver (Taketani et al., 2007; Satoh and Hosokawa, 2010), acebutolol hydrolase activity in rat liver microsomes was higher than that in intestinal microsomes (Table 2; Fig. 5C). Therefore, enzyme(s) other than Ces2 would be responsible for acebutolol hydrolysis in rats, which may explain the weak inhibition by orlistat. The acebutolol\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n20\nhydrolase activity in dog liver microsomes was not inhibited by orlistat, and the activity in the intestinal microsomes was marginal (Fig. 5D). Considering the lack of CES2 expression, it is reasonable that acebutolol hydrolysis did not proceed in the dog intestine, and the activity observed in the liver was probably due to enzyme(s) other than CES2, which may explain the weak inhibition by orlistat. In the monkey liver, CES2 protein is expressed (Taketani et al., 2007), and the amino acid homology between human and monkey CES2 proteins is as high as 89%, but the acebutolol hydrolase activity was not inhibited by orlistat (Fig. 5E). To investigate the cause of the difference in the inhibitory effects of orlistat on acebutolol hydrolase activity between humans and monkeys, acebutolol hydrolase activities were measured using recombinant monkey CES1, CES2, and AADAC, which were prepared in our previous study (Honda et al., 2021) (Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, acebutolol was hardly hydrolyzed by monkey CES2 but was rather efficiently hydrolyzed by monkey AADAC, and the inhibition potency of orlistat against acebutolol hydrolase activity by recombinant monkey CES2 was much weaker than that in humans. Some specific residue(s) out of the 11% amino acid residues, which are different between human and monkey CES2, would determine the recognition by orlistat. The in vivo DDI potential was elucidated using mice, in which orlistat showed strong inhibition against acebutolol hydrolase activities in the liver and intestine, similar to humans. The plasma concentration of acebutolol was significantly increased, and the plasma concentration of acetolol, a hydrolyzed metabolite of acebutolol, was significantly decreased by co-administration of orlistat (Fig. 6), indicating that concomitant use of orlistat altered the pharmacokinetics of acebutolol. PMDA, EMA, and FDA guidelines define the risk criteria for DDI in the liver or intestine using the ratio of the Ki value to the maximum unbound plasma concentration (Imax, u) or the estimated intestinal luminal concentration (Igut) of the inhibitor, respectively (liver: Imax, u / Ki > 0.02; intestine: Igut / Ki > 10). According to the package insert of XENICAL\u00ae, plasma orlistat was near the detection limit (< 10 nM) when 360 mg of orlistat was orally administered to humans, with >99% binding to plasma proteins. Therefore, the maximum unbound plasma concentration (Imax, u) of orlistat at the clinical dose of 120 mg\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n21\nis estimated to be less than 0.03 nM, and Imax, u / Ki was below 0.012, which is lower than the risk criteria for DDI in the liver. On the other hand, the estimated intestinal luminal concentration (Igut) of orlistat was calculated to be 968 \u00b5M according to the formula in the PMDA, EMA, and FDA guidelines (dose/250 mL), and Igut / Ki was 3.3 \u00d7 105, which is considerably higher than the risk criteria for DDI in the intestine. Therefore, DDI via inhibition of hydrolases by orlistat would occur primarily in the intestine, indicating that orlistat could cause DDI with orally administered drugs that are substrates of CES2. Although the possibility of systemic or hepatic CES2 inhibition cannot be completely excluded, DDI by orlistat would occur primarily in the intestine because acebutolol is efficiently hydrolyzed in intestinal first-pass metabolism and orlistat is hardly absorbed and present at high concentrations in the intestine.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that orlistat causes DDI in vivo by potently inhibiting\nCES2. This is the first evidence that inhibition of hydrolases causes DDI. The establishment of risk assessment platforms for DDI mediated by hydrolases would be useful for the development of safe drugs.\nat A SPE T Journals on January 9, 2024\ndm d.aspetjournals.org\nD ow nloaded from\n22"
