Current technological advances enable the multi-disease, pan-ethnic carrier screening, also called \u201cexpanded carrier screening (ECS),\u201d which is performed by genotyping, sequencing, deletion/duplication analysis, or a combination of these methodologies (Kaback, 2000; Kraft et al., 2019). Since the number of copy number variation (CNV) analyses in carrier screening, pre-symptomatic, and prenatal testing has increased, more CNVs unrelated to referral are expected to be incidentally found. However, the pathogenicity of CNVs should be interpreted with caution.\nEdited by: Desheng Liang,\nCentral South University, China\nReviewed by: Wanjin Chen,\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, China Enrique Medina-Acosta,\nState University of the North Fluminense Darcy Ribeiro, Brazil\n*Correspondence: Li Wang fccwangl56@zzu.edu.cn Xiangdong Kong kongxd@263.net\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Genetics of Common and Rare Diseases,\na section of the journal Frontiers in Genetics\nReceived: 18 February 2022 Accepted: 31 March 2022 Published: 09 May 2022\nCitation: Bai Y, Liu J, Xu J, Sun Y, Li J, Gao Y, Liu L, Jia C, Kong X andWang L (2022)\nLong-Read Sequencing Revealed Extragenic and Intragenic Duplications\nof Exons 56\u201361 in DMD in an Asymptomatic Male and a\nDMD Patient.

In large-scale CNV analyses performed for genetic screening in pre-symptomatic and prenatal testing, a large proportion of DMD variants are CNVs; thus, more CNVs in DMD genes unrelated to referral are expected to be incidentally found. However, it is challenging to define an explicit relationship between DMD CNVs (especially duplications) and the phenotypic spectrum of male carriers. Generally, to assess the potential pathogenicity of CNVs, different databases (Leiden Open Variation Database and UMD-DMD France Database) are consulted for genotype\u2013phenotype correlations of DMD duplications (Tuffery-Giraud et al., 2009; Ling et al., 2020). For unreported CNVs, these may be predicted using the frameshift rule and family history.\nAlthough individuals with different phenotypes may have the same duplication, their breakpoints can differ. However, the mechanisms underlying multi-exonic duplications have not been explored due to the technical limitations of conventional sequencing techniques. In this study, we identified the duplication of exons 56\u201361 in DMD of two men from two unrelated families, one with and the other without DMD. Long-read sequencing (LRS) and PacBio single-molecule realtime (PacBio SMRT) target sequencing were used to perform breakpoint analysis to ascertain the pathogenicity and explore the phenotypic differences, which could provide accurate guidance for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis."

Moreover, we explored, for the first time, the potential mechanism for phenotypic differences through breakpoint analysis. DMD duplication as a tandem repeat resulted in a frameshift variation that could produce a pathogenic C-terminally truncated protein p.(Thr3055Argfs*5). The breakpoints of DMD duplications occurred mainly in the introns, which are too large to be detected by MLPA or WES analysis (Ling et al., 2020). LRS is an alternative approach to analyzing SVs. Sequencing results revealed that breakpoints of DMD duplications were located in different genomic regions, which were consistent with the predictions from PacBio SMRT target sequencing data. The phenotypic differences between the two males could be explained by the differences in the breakpoint junctions.\nSeveral studies have identifiedDMD duplications in females or fetuses during carrier screening and pre-symptomatic and prenatal testing, which were not detected in any male family member. For example, the duplication of exons 3\u20137 in DMD was incidentally identified by array comparative genomic hybridization in a girl without a family history of DMD, who\nTABLE 1 | Molecular signatures at breakpoint sequence.\nFamily Case Breakpoint (chrX) Confirmation methods Repeated elements\nSINE LINE LTR Satellite\nF1 III:2 31347969\u0394 Sanger, LRS, SMRT target sequencing AluSc \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 31599228* Sanger, LRS, SMRT target sequencing \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 35854874\u0394 Sanger, LRS, SMRT target sequencing AluSp \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 35857033 LRS, SMRT target sequencing \u2014 \u2014 MER83B-int \u2014 III:2 35861970 LRS, SMRT target sequencing \u2014 L1MC1 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 35878354 LRS, SMRT target sequencing AluSg L1MA6 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 35891965 LRS, SMRT target sequencing AluSx1 L1MB3 \u2014 \u2014 III:2 35945179* Sanger, LRS, SMRT target sequencing AluJb \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 F2 II:6 31344444# Sanger, SMRT target sequencing \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 AT_rich II:6 31567961# Sanger, SMRT target sequencing \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nRepeated elements were defined according to Repeat Masker.

(B) A tandem repeat of exons 56\u201361 in the DMD gene was identified in the male (\u2161:6) from family 2 by the target PacBio SMRT sequencing and Sanger sequencing. A schematic representation showed the junction of breakpoint was located at chrX:31567959, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The breakpoint sequences of a tandem repeat are shown in the 3\u2032-5\u2032 orientation.\nFrontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8788065\nwas affected by cystic fibrosis and maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 (MODY5) due to a classical 17q12 microdeletion (Nguyen et al., 2015). Moreover, an out-of-frame duplication of exons 51\u201362 in DMD was detected in a female fetus based on the data of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPS), which was inherited from the mother and not present in any male family member (Brison et al., 2019). Since the family segregation was not informative, the variant classification of DMD duplication was a major challenge. Therefore, breakpoint mapping is recommended to ascertain the pathogenicity, and it could provide accurate guidance for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.\nSeveral different mechanisms have been hypothesized to initiate genomic recombination: 1) homologous recombination including non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), gene conversion, single-strand annealing, and break-induced replication; 2) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); 3) microhomology-mediated replication-dependent recombination (MMRDR); 4) LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition; and 5) telomere healing (Chen et al., 2010). Among these, MMRDR and NHEJ are the two main mechanisms involved in DMD intragenic deletions in the previous studies (Ling et al., 2020). In order to yield insights into the mechanism of SV formation, mutational features around breakpoint junctions were analyzed. In the present study, microhomologies were found in both DMD duplication individuals. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MMRDR might lead to replication fork stalling and template switching, which could produce complex deletions and duplication rearrangements (Ling et al., 2020).We also found SINE (Alu) and LINE (L1) elements near the breakpoint junctions in the SVs of the asymptomatic male, which was consistent with other studies (Gu et al., 2016). Repetitive sequences (Alu, LINE, and human endogenous retroviral element repeats) may form aberrant secondary structures, which are particularly susceptible to rearrangement. Repetitive elements have been recognized as SV hotspots and may give rise to recurrent SVs mediated by NAHR (Weckselblatt and Rudd, 2015). Therefore, we predicted that these repeat regions might be fragile and prone to chromosomal abnormalities caused by interference with DNA replication, recombination, and repair (Sen et al., 2006). Other junctions\u2019 sequence of breakpoints outside the DMD gene need to be further validated by Sanger sequencing."

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of breakpoint analysis in two men with different phenotypes carrying the same DMD duplication. Therefore, caution is recommended in the use of carrier screening duplications for clinical prediction, especially with no family history of genetic disease. The breakpoint analysis\nis necessary when clinical phenotypes are inconsistent with genotypes, which also applies to prenatal testing. Our results reinforce the importance of detailed clinical evaluation, precise molecular detection, and appropriate genetic counseling."
