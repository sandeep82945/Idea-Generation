The research found that the contribution of human capital stock to innovative performance is the greatest, of which technical human capital has the most impact on the output of innovative performance; and the flow of human capital flow and investment are positive to promote innovative performance output, and the level of contribution is basically the same.\nINDEX TERMS High-tech enterprises, Human capital, Innovative performance, Simulation\nI. INTRODUCTION A. RESEARCH BACKGROUND In the 1960s, the famous economist Schultz [56] made a speech entitled \"Human Capital Investment\" in the United States, which means the birth of modern human capital theory, and obtained a great response in the academic world. Erz has also published related works such as \"Education Economic Value\" and \"Human Capital Investment\", and the theory of human capital has been formally established. At the same time, today's society is in a new era of transition from the industrial economy to the knowledge economy. The market environment facing enterprises is becoming more and more complicated, and competition is becoming more and more intense. Technical updates are the most distinctive features of this era [78]. In the face of such a market environment where\nchallenges and opportunities coexist, they must maintain a competitive advantage. Human capital is an important resource in the enterprise, which has obvious heterogeneity. As the most representative existence of high-tech enterprises, it is the main force of the upgrading of industrial structure and\nenhanced competitiveness and has a strategic position in the national economy [80].\nTherefore, considering the above economic background, this article uses the study of human capital and innovative performance, using the research method of the VENSIM PLE system simulation to analyze the level of human capital from the micro level of high-tech enterprises, and deeply study the human capital pairs of high -tech enterprises. The impact of innovative performance output provides practical and feasible suggestions for high-tech enterprises to improve the level of human capital, better and faster to promote the output of innovative performance."

First of all, most of the relevant research on \"human capital\", is mostly from the macro-regional level [58/62/74] or micro-individual level [63/66] research, which involves less corporate levels, especially high-tech enterprises as research. Object. Thirdly, the relevant research on \"human capital\" at this stage is less combined with performance output. From different dimensions to analyze the human capital of high-tech enterprises, and study the impact of human capital on the output of innovative performance, this research field is relatively blank.\nSecondly, this article starts from the system dynamics,\nusing the VENSIM PLE simulation software to study the simulation design of the impact model of high-tech enterprises' human capital dimensional dimension and hightech enterprise human capital on innovative performance. At present, most of the research on \"human capital\" uses questionnaires or research methods for second-hand public data and has not further explained the constituent mechanism of high-tech enterprise human capital itself. Therefore, on the basis of previous research, this article uses simulation to analyze the environment to explain the inherent mechanism of high-tech enterprise human capital itself, unveil the formation mechanism of the human capital of high-tech enterprises, and analyze its impact on the output of innovative performance.\n2)PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nIn the current era of information and knowledge, innovation and research and development are increasingly significant to enterprises. Compared with material capital, human capital has unique advantages, so the enterprise has paid more and more attention to the education and training of employees and \"people\" [75]. As a unique intellectual and technical collection, high-tech enterprise employees have become increasingly improved in enterprises. This article is aimed at the research of high-tech enterprises' human capital and innovative performance. The importance has great practical significance."

            "heading": "1) HUMAN CAPITAL THEORY",
            "text": "The human capital theory opens up an emerging field of research in modern economics. At present, there are different opinions on the definition of human capital theory in academic circles, but from the source of its concept, it mainly includes two main lines of perspective, one is based on the academic development of human capital theory; the other is based on the history of human capital theory. Development process.\nFirst, it is based on the theoretical and academic development perspective of human capital theory. The definition of human capital theory from this perspective is deeply influenced by Western classical economics. It elaborates more on the study of capital and starts with the impact of human resources on the economy. Value is assigned to manpower. It is mainly based on three development stages of human capital theory: the traditional human capital theory\nstage represented by Adam Smith, Friedrich List, and Alfred Marshall. The stage of traditional human capital theory is represented by Schultz, Becker, and Ming The stage of modern human capital theory is represented by Searle; the stage of contemporary human capital theory is represented by Lucas, Romer, and Herbert Spencer.\nThe second is based on the historical development process of human capital theory. Scholars based on this perspective start from the foundation established by human capital theory, that is, from the concept of human resource management. Since the development of human resource theory originated from personnel management, so For the\ndefinition of the theoretical concept of human capital, more emphasis is placed on people, focusing on highlighting the importance of human resources, starting from human resources, and looking for the root cause of employee management. The roots of human management can be traced back to the British Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. During the Second World War between 1939 and 1945, due to the development of the global economic and political background, the war prompted the demand for labor and personnel experts. Everything provides the corresponding premise and foundation for the emergence of employee management. The IPM (Institute for Personnel Management) was established in 1946; in the 1960s, the passage of labor laws promoted the development of the role of employees; in the 1970s, new laws proposed employment standards, combined with the provisions of the Donovan government report, the status of the personnel function It has been improved; in the 1980s and 1990s, the content and form of employee management underwent a complete change, and personnel management began to be divided into \"hard\" and \"soft\" explanations. \"It emphasizes the meaning of interpreting people. Scholars who are based on the historical development process of human capital theory have followed the \"soft\" interpretation when interpreting human capital theory. The development of this historical process emphasizes\nthe meaning of human beings, from the needs and importance of the objective environment to employees to The management of employees and the establishment of labor laws to protect the interests of employees are all carried out around people.\n2)HUMAN CAPITAL Since the economist Schultz systematically expounded the human capital theory in \"Human Capital Investment\", it has triggered a lot of discussion and research on human capital in the academic circle. Different fields and application fields, so scholars explain the meaning of human capital from different perspectives.\nTABLE I DIFFERENT SCHOLARS' DEFINITIONS OF THE CONNOTATION OF HUMAN CAPITAL\nscholar The connotation of human capital\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Influence of human capital, so there are differences in human capital, that is, human capital has heterogeneity characteristics, and this difference is the basis for the classification of human capital. Views on human capital have their priorities.\nTABLE2 CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN CAPITAL\nscholars standard View\nSchultz [55] Social role General, management, and skill.\nY.L.

Ding\n[65]\nPattern of\nproductivity\nHeterogeneous or homogeneous\nhuman capital.\nCombined with the characteristics of high-tech enterprises, this article has a few explanations of the definition of human capital: \u2460 Human capital must be part of the knowledge, technology, and capabilities that can increase the labor productivity of enterprises; \u2461 \"people\" in human capital are all employees, and all employees, Including corporate managers, operators, and producers; \u2462 human capital as \"living capital\", with innovation, creativity, effective allocation of resources, adjustment of corporate development and other marketing capabilities. Therefore, this article divides high-tech human capital from the perspective of general human capital, technical human capital, and executive human capital, and builds a sub -dimensional model of high-tech enterprise human capital. 3) HIGH-TECH ENTERPRISE MANPOWER CAPITAL As an emerging economic entity in the modern market, hightech enterprises have obvious high knowledge and high-tech characteristics. The significance of human capital to high-tech\nenterprises in high-tech enterprises has some significant characteristics of high-tech enterprises.\nFirst, the human capital of high -tech enterprises has heterogeneity. Due to the different educational background, professional scope, work experience, personal talent, and environment, human capital has a layered. Among them The manpower capital you have to complete the work goals, and during the work process, the conditions provided by the organization give full play to the subjective initiative for innovative activities. This innovation is reflected in corporate products, services, and management. The innovation ability of human capital will be transformed into Real productivity, creating greater corporate value.\nSecond, the human capital of high-tech enterprises is scarce. The quality that high-tech enterprises must have included scientific and technological research and development capabilities, technological renewal capabilities, and management innovation capabilities. The formation of these capabilities requires long-term accumulation. Employees need to receive a formal education, participate in professional training, and accumulate practical experience. During this accumulation process, due to the influence of various factors, the complexity of human capital formation is exacerbated, especially high-level human capital to accumulate more investment accumulation to form.\nThird, the human capital of high-tech enterprises has high liquidity. On the one hand, the market demand for the hightech industry has changed greatly. Enterprises will recruit and streamline employees according to the specific production and operation conditions, causing the inflow and outflow of human capital. On the other hand, high -tech high -quality enterprise employees with a considerable proportion of high-quality technology. It means that the individual human capital of hightech enterprises has more career choices.\nFourth, the human capital of high-tech enterprises has high value added. Material capital will be lost during wear, depreciation, and consumption. As a kind of intangible capital, human capital will not be consumed. Intellectuality determines its strong innovation capabilities. This innovation ability will be transformed into strong real productivity and promotes the improvement of labor productivity to create the more corporate performance.\nIn summary, the composition of the human capital of high-tech enterprises also has obvious characteristics. Compared with ordinary enterprises, the general human capital of high-tech enterprises is small, and middle-level technical human capital is obviously obvious. The overall structure is the body shape. Technical personnel is the core talents of the enterprise. High-tech enterprises have richer professional knowledge and innovation capabilities than other industries. Under the environment of the knowledge economy, high-tech enterprises have a bright prospect, and market demand is getting wider and wider. B. INNOVATION PERFORMANCE REVIEW 1)DEFINITION OF INNOVATION PERFORMANCE\nAccording to the literal meaning, enterprise innovation performance is innovation performance, refers to the positive results obtained by the enterprise through innovation, and is\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nZ.Wu et al: Innovative consortium, high -tech enterprise's human capital of human capital on the impact of the impact of innovative performance design research\nVOLUME XX, 2022 9\nan important index to measure the effect of enterprise innovation activities. The academic circle has not formed a unified opinion on the definition of innovation performance, and the existing researches mainly define it from the perspective of process and result. From the perspective of process, Meeus and Oerlemans believe that innovation performance is the process by which enterprises introduce new technologies and products developed into the market and the economic performance achieved by enterprises through innovation [67]. Hagedoorn and Cloodt pointed out that innovation performance refers to the whole process of an enterprise from putting forward new ideas, developing new technologies, and creating new products and services [68]. Eckhardt and Shane defined innovation performance as the process by which enterprises turn technologies into commodities and finally obtain economic benefits [69]. From the perspective of results, Ahuja and Katila believe that innovation performance refers to the achievements of enterprises in technology, invention, and innovation in the process of new idea proposal, technology development, product production, and commercialization of results [70]. Gemunden believes that innovation performance includes both the effect of innovation and the efficiency of innovation, which is reflected in the benefit of product innovation and the benefit of process innovation [71].\nTABLE 11 PERSPECTIVES ON INNOVATION PERFORMANCE\nscholars standard View\nMeeus, Oerlemans [66] Process\nThe process by which a firm introduces new technologies and products into the market is the economic performance achieved by the firm through innovation.\nHagedoorn, Cloodt[67] Process\nThe whole process of an enterprise from coming up with new ideas, to developing new technologies, to creating new products and services.\nEckhardt, Shane[68]\nProcess\nThe process in which enterprises turn technology into commodities and finally obtain economic benefits.\nAhuja, Katila[69]\nResults\nThe achievement of technology, invention, and innovation in the process of developing new ideas, developing technologies, producing products, and commercializing results.\nGem\u00fcnden [70]\nResults\nIt includes both the effect of innovation and the efficiency of innovation, which is reflected in the benefit of product innovation and the benefit of process innovation.\nSource: Compiled by the author To sum up, the definition of innovation performance as a construct has not been unified in academic circles. This paper defines innovation performance from the perspective of results and considers that innovation performance is the results obtained by enterprises through innovation activities. This paper holds that no matter what kind of innovation form, it will eventually be reflected in developing new products and improving enterprise profits. 2) MEASUREMENT OF INNOVATION PERFORMANCE\nThe research on innovative performance measurement is\nsufficient. Many scholars give measurement methods from different perspectives, which can be roughly divided into three\ncategories: one is a single indicator measurement; second, multi-dimensional indicators measurement; third, the Likud measurement table is used for measurement.\nSome representative scholars using indexes using single\ndimensions are mostly carried out from indicators such as patent authorization, new product sales revenue, and new product output value [72-75]. Some scholars who use multidimensional indicators to measure innovative performance mostly use a combination of single indicators, such as the number of new equipment, labor productivity, patent growth rate, new product output value, etc. [76-80]. In addition, some scholars also designed the test performance of the five-point or seven-point surface measurement of Licker [81-83].\nThe above classification does not cover all measurement methods, but only the most basic and commonly used ones. There are a variety of measurement methods for innovation performance in specific research. No matter it is a secondary data method or a questionnaire survey method, we should not blindly be paranoid and simply judge. It depends on which measurement method in specific research is more consistent with the research situation and the research content and\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Therefore, the measurement method of innovation performance should be selected by researchers after comprehensive consideration of their research content, research context, and theoretical framework. C. THEORETICAL BASIS 1)THE IMPACT MECHANISM OF GENERAL HUMAN CAPITAL ON INNOVATION PERFORMANCE Ordinary employees in the enterprise have received certain education and have the ability to learn, work and analyze. The characteristics of general human capital are that the amount of human capital of each individual is less, but because the number of ordinary employees in the enterprise accounts for a large number The proportion, so the overall extension of the general human capital, the general human capital creates performance for enterprises by completing the tasks prescribed by superiors and operating on the front line. 2)THE INFLUENCE MECHANISM OF TECHNICAL HUMAN CAPITAL ON INNOVATION PERFORMANCE The inexhaustible motivation of high-tech enterprises can continue to develop is technological innovation, and technical personnel are the carrier of technological innovation. This is why the proportion of technical personnel in high-tech enterprises is far higher than that of traditional enterprises. It is a group of employees who determine the core competitiveness of the enterprise and the core talents of hightech enterprises. Therefore, many countries use the ratio of scientific and technological personnel to the total number of employees as the condition for measuring high-tech enterprises. It can obtain 2.5 times the economic benefits. Technical personnel relies on professional knowledge and professional skills to conduct a series of innovative activities in enterprise production and operation activities. From this, it can be seen that technical human capital is a direct creator of corporate value among high-tech enterprises. For innovation, innovation Performance has greatly contributed. 3)THE INFLUENCE MECHANISM OF EXECUTIVE HUMAN CAPITAL ON INNOVATION PERFORMANCE In the era of the knowledge economy, the competition in the international and domestic markets is increasingly fierce and the market environment is unpredictable. If high-tech companies want to survive in such an environment, they must be a keen insight into the market and make rapid and timely market changes. Reaction, combine the resources owned by the enterprise with the market demand, excavate the potential capabilities within the enterprise and use this ability, continue to find new market opportunities to cope with market changes, make timely decisions, and convert into the improvement of innovation performance. Sex, these all require senior managers of the enterprise to bear [13]. According to the external conditions and internal resources, the enterprise formulates the development strategy and plan of the enterprise\nin a macro. According to the plan, the enterprise can operate in an orderly and efficient operation, and also rely on the management experience of senior management personnel. Therefore, decision and management capabilities contribute to innovative performance [14].\nHuman capital at different levels has different degrees of impact on high-tech innovation performance. Compared with other traditional enterprises, high-tech enterprises in other traditional enterprises show high dependence on knowledge applications and technological innovation. Employees' ability, technology, and information to use and give play to their ability to actively innovate. Based on this high-tech enterprise, it adopts corresponding personnel structural configuration, organizational management measures, and incentive methods for different types of human capital to promote corporate human capital to form the core competitive advantage of hightech enterprises."

The added value of high-tech enterprises' human capital increase is composed of three parts: the amount of general human capital increase, the increase in the amount of technical human capital, and the amount of human capital increase in executives. Among them, knowledge integration application capabilities, knowledge transformation capabilities, willingness to improve human capital and human capital increase, and human capital enhancement threshold activate the above three. Similarly, the part of the reduction value of high-tech enterprises' human capital reduction values is also jointly impacted by the reduction of the amount of general human capital, the reduction of the amount of technical human capital, and the\nreduction of the amount of manpower capital of executives. Among them, the market competition coefficient, market demand factor, human capital flow, and human capital investment jointly act on the commercialization value of human capital, affect the reduction of the human capital of high-tech enterprises, and then affect the level of human capital stock and innovative performance of high -tech enterprises."

The effectiveness test is to verify whether the behavior obtained by the model reflects the characteristics and changes of the actual system. Solved problem [84]. 1) EFFECTIVE INSPECTION OF HIGH -TECH ENTERPRISE'S HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK\nIt can be seen from the validity of high-tech enterprises' human capital stock: the increase in the amount of human capital increase in high-tech enterprises has risen at a constant speed, from 10 million yuan to a loss of 10 million yuan in the 100 million yuan; and high -tech enterprises The reduction in human capital shows the opposite trend, from the initial 10 million yuan to the final loss of 1,000 yuan. In the 70th year, the two intersect, indicating that around the 70th year, the increase in human capital increases of high-tech enterprises and the reduction of the same value. Under the common role of the two, high-tech enterprises' human capital stock and high-tech enterprise manpower. The same changes in the capital increase, but the absolute value of the high-tech enterprise's human capital stock is less than the increase in human capital increases of high-tech enterprises. This may be due to the special nature of the high-tech enterprise itself. In the early days of the establishment of the enterprise, because employees are still unfamiliar with each other and the work cooperation is not tacit, resulting in low work efficiency, the reduction of the human capital of high-tech enterprises is larger in the early stage. At the same time, high-tech enterprises have a wealthy investment in human capital in the early stage. Therefore, the increase in high-tech human capital increased a large increase, which led to the overall growth trend of high-tech enterprises' human capital stock. 2) TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN CAPITAL INCREASE OF HIGH-TECH ENTERPRISES\nThe validity test map of high-tech enterprises' human capital increases can be seen that the increase in a human capital increase in high -tech enterprises are commonly used by the increase in the amount of general human capital, the increase in the amount of technical human capital, and the increase in the amount of manpower capital of executives. High -tech enterprises' human capital increase has shown a rapid growth trend, and the trend of changes in general human capital, technical and human capital, and executive human capital. Stable situation. Among them, the largest growth rate of technical human capital is the biggest. Senior manpower capital is second, and general manpower capital has the minimum effect on the existing human capital stock of hightech enterprises. This may be caused by the high-tech and high -value of high-tech enterprises themselves. Core technicians in high-tech enterprises as the most representative of existence, making the most prominent contribution to the improvement of high-tech enterprises' human capital. 3)HIGH-TECH ENTERPRISE HUMAN CAPITAL REDUCTION OF THE VALIDITY INSPECTION\nIt can be seen from the reduction of the effectiveness of the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises: the reduction of the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises is reduced by the reduction of the amount of the general human capital, the reduction of the amount of technical human capital, and the reduction of the amount of manpower capital of executives. The decrease in the reduction of human capital of high-tech enterprises has continued to decline, while the reduction of general human capital, the reduction in the amount of technical human capital, and the reduction of the amount of manpower capital of executives. Among them, the decrease in technical human capital is the largest. Senior manpower capital is second, and the minimum absolute value of general manpower capital is the smallest. This shows that within high-tech enterprises at this stage, the flow of core technology employees is more frequent and out of the flow. For the individual technical employees, this is not conducive to the improvement of employees' personal human capital; from the perspective of the long-term development of enterprises, the outflow of technical employees is not conducive to enterprises mastering core technologies and forming a competitive advantage. 4) THE VALIDITY TEST OF INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nZ.Wu et al: Innovative consortium, high -tech enterprise's human capital of human capital on the impact of the impact of innovative performance design research\nVOLUME XX, 2022 9\nIt can be seen from the validity of innovative performance: the high-tech enterprise's human capital stock and innovative performance have shown a basically consistent change trend, but the absolute value of the high-tech enterprise's human capital stock growth is greater than the absolute value of innovative performance growth. In the 10th to 10th year, the changes between the two are basically the same; starting from the 10th year, the human capital stock of high-tech enterprises has begun to be slightly greater than innovative performance. This shows that high-tech enterprises' human capital stocks can significantly positively affect the output of innovative performance. However, due to the loss of human capital in practice, the stock of high-tech human capital is not completely consistent. Therefore, at this stage, high-tech enterprises need to increase the recruitment of technical employees, increase investment and training of employee human capital, stabilize the composition of different types of human capital in enterprises, etc. Performance output. C. SENSITIVITY TEST The sensitivity analysis is to change the parameters or structures in the model and compare the output of the model, so as to determine its influence and provide a theoretical basis and decision support for actual work [85]. After the previous section of the model built, the validity inspection of the models, this section adjusts the number of the human capital increase, the commercialization value of human capital, the increase in the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises, and the reduction of the amount of human capital of high -tech enterprises. Dynamic simulation sensitivity test. 1) CHANGE THE THRESHOLD FOR INCREASING HUMAN CAPITAL Changing the main parameters in the threshold of manpower capital: employee distance, trust, the distribution rate between employees, and the differences between the belief between employees, change the ability to integrate knowledge, and then change the ability of knowledge transformation, which affects human capital to improve the threshold. To conduct sensitivity inspection and analysis of human capital increase thresholds. PLAN1 is the amount of trust and interest between employees; reducing the distance between employees and the differences between the belief between employees; the amount of knowledge integrating application capabilities to 100. Plan the model to the opposite of PLAN1 to form PLAN2.\nIt can be seen from Figure 8 that the human capital increase thresholds of the three different schemes are different.\nThe current (Current) and Plan1's human capital increase threshold change curve, while Plan2's human capital increase threshold is negative, and no change occurs. However, the absolute value of PLAN1's human capital increase threshold is greater than the absolute value of the current period, and the time node of the decrease is earlier. In the current period, in the 10th to the 10th year, the threshold of the increase in human capital increased to 5,000 yuan, while in the 10th to the 30th year, fell to 0 yuan, until the end of the 100th; In the 0th to 5th year, the threshold of human capital increase was maintained around 15,000 yuan, while the 5th to 15th year dropped to near 10,000 yuan until the end of the 100th. It can be seen from FIG. 9: Under PLAN1, the output level of innovative performance is the largest. In the current period, the innovative performance level under PLAN2 is the worst.\nand PLAN2 Due to the direct impact of the parameters of the three schemes on the threshold of human capital, the human capital increase threshold of the three schemes has significantly differentiated, and it has a significant impact on innovative performance. It can be concluded that through effective measures to increase the trust distribution rate between members of high-tech enterprises and the interest distribution rate between employees, reducing employees' distance, and differences in belief between employees can effectively improve their ability to integrate knowledge, and then enhance human capital and improve Threshold, affecting innovative performance output. 2) CHANGE THE VALUE OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF HUMAN CAPITAL By changing the main parameters of the commercialization value of human capital: market competition coefficient,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nZ.Wu et al: Innovative consortium, high -tech enterprise's human capital of human capital on the impact of the impact of innovative performance design research\nVOLUME XX, 2022 9\nmarket demand factor, human capital flow, and human capital investment, the sensitivity test analysis of the commercial value of human capital. PLAN 3 is through increasing market demand factor, human capital inflows and inflow rates, human capital investment income, and investment rates; reducing the formation of market competition coefficients. PLAN4 is formed by changing the model opposite PLAN3.\nIt can be seen from Figure 10 that the commercialization value of human capital of three different solutions is inconsistent. The value of commercialization value of human capital under PLAN3 is the largest, and the value of the current period (Current) has the least commercialization value of human capital at PLAN4, and the current curve of the Current is similar to the changing curve under PLAN4. In the current period, the commercialization value of human capital remains at a stable trend of about 100,000 yuan; in PLAN3, the value of human capital commercialization has increased rapidly from the 0th year to the 5th year In the end; in PLAN4, the commercialization value of human capital remained stable around 0 yuan. It can be seen from Figure 11 that the innovative performance output under PLAN3 is the largest, the current value of (CURRENT) is in the middle, and the innovative performance output under PLAN4 is the worst.\nand PLAN4 Due to the direct impact of the parameters of the three schemes on the commercialization value of human capital, the commercialization value of human capital of the three schemes has significantly differentiated, and it has a significant impact on innovative performance. It can be concluded that through effective measures to increase the flow of human capital, investment, and market demand coefficients\nof high-tech enterprises; reducing market competition coefficients can effectively enhance the ability to integrate knowledge, thereby enhancing the value of commercialization of human capital, and increasing the level of innovative performance output. 3) CHANGE HIGH-TECH ENTERPRISE'S HUMAN CAPITAL INCREASE INCREASES By changing the main parameters in the increase in human capital increases of high-tech enterprises: the increased rate of general human capital, the increase in technical human capital increase and the increase of the human capital increase rate of executives, respectively. The increase in capital increases, which will affect the sensitivity inspection analysis of the increase in the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises. PLAN5 is formed by increasing the increase in general human capital, the increase in technical human capital increase and the increase in the increase of the human capital of executives; PLAN6 is formed by adjusting the increase in the general human capital increase, the increase in technical human capital increase and the increase in the number of executive human capital increase rates.\nIt can be seen from Figure 12 that the number of high - tech enterprises with high -tech enterprises with different solutions shows an inconsistent trend. The increase in increase in human capital increase in high-tech enterprises under PLAN5 is the largest. The value of the current period (Current), the absolute value of the high-tech enterprise's human capital increase in PLAN6 is the least, and the curve trend formed by PLAN5 and PLAN6 shows the opposite situation. In the current period, the increase in the human capital of high-tech enterprises has increased slightly from 0 yuan in the 0 yuan in the 0th year; at PLAN5, the increase in human capital increase in high-tech enterprises shows a stable and constant growth trend. The yuan rose to about 52 million yuan in the 100th year; at PLAN6, the increase in human capital increases of hightech enterprises decreased by year by year, from 0 yuan to the end of the initial period to the end of the period of about 50 million yuan. From FIG. 13, it can be seen that the innovative performance in the three schemes shows different changes. The innovative performance output under PLAN5 is the largest, and the current period is the worst.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

It can be concluded that effective measures to increase the increase in general human capital, the increase in the technical human capital increase, and the increase in the human capital increase rate of executives, can increase the amount of general human capital, the increase in the amount of technical human capital, and the increase in the amount of manpower capital of executives. Bible increases the level of the increased human capital of high-tech enterprises and affects the output of innovative performance. 4) CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF HUMAN CAPITAL OF HIGHTECH ENTERPRISES By changing the main parameters in the reduction of high-tech enterprises' human capital reduction: the reduction rate of general human capital, the reduction of technical and human capital, and the reduction of the human capital reduction rate of executives to affect the amount of general human capital, the amount of technical human capital, and the executive human capital Reduce the amount of output and perform the sensitivity inspection analysis of high -tech enterprises' human capital. PLAN7 is formed by reducing the reduction rate of general human capital, the reduction in technical human capital, and the reduction of the human capital reduction rate of executives; PLAN8 is formed by increasing the reduction rate of general human capital, the reduction of technical human capital, and the reduction of the reduction in the human capital of executives by increasing the general human capital reduction rate, the reduction of technical human capital and the reduction of executive human capital.\nIt can be seen from FIG. 14 that the reduction of the human capital of high-tech enterprises with three different solutions shows an inconsistent trend. The number of hightech enterprises under PLAN7 decreases the largest growth rate of human capital, and the value of the current period (CURRENT) has a minimum reduction in high -tech enterprise's human capital under PLAN8, and the changes in PLAN7 and PLAN8 show the opposite situation. In the current period, the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises has a stable and small growth trend; under PLAN7, the\nreduction of the human capital of high-tech enterprises shows a constant speed growth trend. On the contrary, under PLAN8, high-tech enterprises' human capital Reduces the amount of decrease in a constant speed. It can be seen from Figure 15 that the level of innovative performance output under PLAN7 is the best. In the current value of (Current), the innovative performance output under PLAN8 is poor.\nBecause the parameters of the three scheme changes have a direct impact on the reduction of high -tech enterprise's human capital, the number of high-tech enterprises with high-tech enterprises in the three schemes have significantly different from the amount of human capital, and it has a significant impact on innovative performance. It can be concluded that effective measures to reduce the reduction rate of general human capital, the reduction in technical human capital, and the reduction of the human capital of executive manpower, can reduce the reduction of general, technical, and executive human capital, and then reduce the human capital of high -tech enterprises' human capital reduces the amount, thereby affecting the existence of human capital of high -tech enterprises, and eventually positively affect innovative performance."

            "heading": "A. THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS",
            "text": "The first is the impact of general human capital on\ninnovative performance. Ordinary employees occupy the largest proportion in one organization. Although the knowledge literacy and technical level of general employees have no core technical talents, general employees occupy an important position in the survival and development of hightech enterprises. Core technical personnel have developed and improved new technologies, and through the production labor of ordinary employees, these research and development and improved technologies are put into practice, and they are used to improve the innovative performance of high-tech enterprises. Therefore, although general human capital has not been very obvious in promoting the innovative performance of high-tech enterprises, general human capital is still very important for the survival and development of high-tech enterprises. Enterprises provide technical training for ordinary employees, improve their level of knowledge reserves and technological innovation, and lay a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the organization.\nThe second is the impact of technical human capital on innovative performance. The basis of the survival and development of high-tech enterprises is core competition technology, and technical employees play an important role in it. Because most of the employees flowing out of high-tech enterprises are technical personnel, on the one hand, high-tech enterprises belong to the knowledge-intensive emerging\nindustries. Because their business technology is stronger, it will inevitably depend on technical employees to depend on higher level Employees who are the main targets for competitors in the same industry. To this end, competitors in the same industry may give higher treatment to attract the need for technical employees; on the other hand, knowledge absorption and high-quality employees with strong technical capabilities and high -quality employees Strong technical innovation ability, means that there are more choice rights in work opportunities, especially the core technical personnel and senior executives of the enterprise will choose more appropriate enterprises and jobs based on their career planning\nand vision. The loss of these core technical employees will lead to the risk of technology leakage, weakening the core competitive advantage of enterprises in terms of technical level, and eventually, it will have a negative impact on the innovative performance of the enterprise. The third is the impact of executive human capital on innovative performance.\nThe management of senior executives can master the direction of corporate survival and development, which can minimize the direction of technology research and development and innovation in the organization. High-tech enterprises' requirements for professional knowledge and innovation capabilities are stricter than other industries. Under the macro policy of the knowledge and economic environment and the national key support, the high-tech industry has a bright prospect, market demand is getting wider and wider, and competition is getting more and more. Fierce, high-tech enterprises are facing environmental backgrounds that coexist with opportunities and challenges. To gain competitive\nadvantages in such an environment, high-tech enterprises must pay attention to the introduction of three high-level technical talents. Strong and experienced R&D talents. The second is technical personnel who have advanced technologies and strong operating skills. The third is senior managers with composite backgrounds and management knowledge and practical experience.\nIn general, high-tech enterprises generally exert their human capital stocks ideal and significantly promote the improvement of innovative performance. It has verified the theoretical analysis of the key factors that affect the key factors of innovation performance. The importance of increasing the amount of human capital of high-tech enterprises and the positive impact on the output of innovative performance. Therefore, enterprises need to meet the interests of technical employees to the greatest extent through effective measures, stabilize the flow of technical employees in the enterprise, form the competitive advantage of the enterprise, and promote the innovative performance output of the enterprise."
