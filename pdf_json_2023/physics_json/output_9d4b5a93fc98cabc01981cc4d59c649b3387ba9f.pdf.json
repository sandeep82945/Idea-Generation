    "abstractText": "Diagnosing mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute setting is challenging due to the nonspecific and often transient or delayed symptoms. Further, the criteria for acute head imaging are frequently not fulfilled, which may lead to a missed diagnosis. A rapid test to diagnose TBI using body fluids would be highly useful. Urine and saliva samples were collected from 28 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, eight years two months [four years three months]) with acute, clinically diagnosed mild TBI and 30 healthy volunteers at Satasairaala Hospital, Pori, Finland, over 11 months. The mean (SD) time from trauma to first sampling was 3 h 56 min (1 h 14 min). Samples were analyzed to determine the number of lectin-binding glycan molecules, indicating nerve tissue damage. The relative levels of several lectin-bound glycans were measured by fluorescence. Compared with healthy controls, the TBI group showed significant increases (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum two-sided test) in nine glycans in the saliva, one glycan in the urine, and a significant decrease in seven glycans in the urine. These findings of potentially diagnostic glycans in body fluids after TBI warrant further research and may enable the development of a rapid body fluid-based point-of-care test to identify pediatric patients with TBI after a head injury.",

            "text": "An impact to the head or rapid movement of the head, may cause a traumatic brain injury (TBI), which leads to altered brain function. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), especially its mildest form, concussion, is particularly challenging to diagnose [1\u20133]. Computed tomography (CT) is used to detect traumatic intracranial findings in patients with head injuries, but it cannot be used to exclude TBI. In addition to CT, some biomarkers may detect brain injuries, e.g., S100\u03b2, which was introduced more than 50 years ago [4]. Recently, the use of S100\u03b2 as a biomarker has been recommended in Scandinavian countries, and it has been validated in the Finnish population [5]. A recent study assessing whether S-100\u03b2 protein could be measured in the urine after its detection in the plasma following mTBI, however, found that urine sampling for S-100\u03b2 protein was not useful during the acute phase [6]. To detect intracranial injuries, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (GFAP-UCH-L1) [7]. Some biomarkers for detecting mTBI have been developed over the years, but none are considered ideal or have the potential to replace clinical evaluation and CT. Review articles of biomarkers available for TBI have been published by Carney et al., Harel et al., and Wang et al. [8\u201310]. Alterations in glycans have been shown to indicate TBI in adult patients [11]. The present study was conducted to collect clinical samples from children for the discovery of a novel biomarker for TBI. Using either saliva or urine instead of blood for testing is a potential advantage in clinical practice. The intention of this study was to demonstrate the\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 2181. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13132181 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\npossibility of using saliva or urine as a source of biomarkers for detecting mTBI. A rapid diagnostic test based on a new biomarker would significantly improve the quality of the diagnostic process concerning mTBI. This will improve the treatment of patients with head injuries [9,12,13]. Our hypothesis was that altered levels of some glycans may function as early indicators of brain injury in children."

All patients were under 18 years of age. After obtaining informed consent from the patients/parents/guardian to participate in the study, body fluid samples were collected. All 28 patients with suspected TBI were diagnosed with mTBI. The patients, who were treated in the Emergency Department of the hospital because of a clinically diagnosed mTBI, were classified as TBI patients (total of 28 patients). The control group comprised 30 uninjured volunteers who had not suffered any head trauma during the previous three months. The diagnosis of positive TBI required a pediatrician\u2019s assessment of the case history, injury mechanism, and symptoms in combination with the pediatric Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) evaluation and brain imaging results. Patients with relevant TBI-related symptoms and a GCS of 13\u201315 were classified as having mTBI. From the patients with suspected TBI, 1\u20132 mL of saliva and ~10 mL of urine were collected at two time points after the injury. Saliva samples were collected at least 1 h after eating. In children aged \u22644 years, saliva samples were collected using a syringe without a needle from the sublingual space in the mouth. Patients >4 years of age were asked to rinse their mouths twice with pure water and then to spit saliva into a clean plastic cup. Urine samples were collected in a plastic cup or potty and transferred to storage vials. All specimens were frozen as quickly as possible at a temperature of \u221270 \u25e6C and stored (up to a few months) until analyzed together in the laboratory.

A biochemical glycan-binding analysis was used for the sample analysis [14]. Each sample was applied to a glass slide containing 95 different lectins printed on the surface to capture the glycans of interest from the sample. The visualization of bound glycans was enabled using a fluorescent reporter complex. The lectins used for screening represented multiple different glycan binding specificities (Lectin Array 95, RayBiotech\u00ae, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA). The fluorescence intensity measured from each lectin spot was proportional to the amount of that lectin-binding glycan in the sample. The levels and intensities were analyzed and compared between the study groups. Statistical analyses of the results were conducted using a t-test for comparisons between the TBI group and the healthy control subjects. p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and the fold-change was calculated to indicate the relationship of the mean values between the TBI group and controls."

One patient, a 15-year-old boy with an undisputable TBI finding on MRI, had increased values for eight lectin-binding values in saliva (LPA, WFA, DISCOIDIN-II, RCA 120, SBA, LEA, PA-IL, and STL), whereas half of the tested lectins showed decreased values in comparison with the healthy controls.

            "text": "Glycans are components of glycoproteins and other glycosylated macromolecules that are released from nerve tissue in the brain when a patient incurs a TBI and damage to the blood-brain barrier. The amounts of glycans can be measured in vitro by lectin-based bio affinity binding assays. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins originating mainly from plants. Different lectins have different affinities for different glycan structures or sequences. The null hypothesis for this study was that no differences in the glycan concentrations of the two tested body fluid types (saliva and urine) would be detected in pediatric patients with acute TBI in comparison with healthy subjects. Analysis of the glycan content in body fluids revealed significant changes in both types of body fluid. Significant increases in nine lectins, indicating eight different glycans in saliva and one in urine, were detected in suspected TBI patients. Thus, the null hypothesis could be rejected. The diagnosis of mTBI is troublesome and controversial [1,2]. It is also controversial whether mTBI can be reflected by abnormal CT scan results. According to the current guidelines for the management of TBI, a small abnormal finding in the imaging may still be classified as mTBI when the duration of the loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia is short [1,15]. Even if the GCS is 13\u201315, a positive finding from a CT scan is always evidence of mTBI [16]. In the present study, the diagnosis of TBI was made by the clinician in charge of the patients in the Emergency Department. The diagnosis was based on both clinical evidence, the GCS score, and CT imaging results. However, the information may still be inconclusive. Additional diagnostic means, such as biomarkers, may fill the current gap in mTBI diagnostics. A few biomarkers show promise for detecting TBI [5,7,8]. Currently, S100\u03b2 is the only biomarker recommended by task groups such as the Scandinavian Guidelines for the diagnosis of head injuries [2]. Other injuries may also influence the level of this biomarker, however, making it less specific [17]. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized the first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussions in adults [18]. Most of the biomarkers studied focus on measuring proteins in the blood or plasma. Here, we focused on changes in glycan components in the saliva and urine obtained from patients with acute TBI. The aim was to discover brain trauma indicators that could be measured by non-invasive sampling and, owing to easy sampling, also be applicable for use in an ambulatory setting. This study tentatively indicated altered responses of certain glycans both in saliva and in urine in patients with TBI compared to healthy subjects. The biggest differences between TBI samples and control samples were found in the urine (Table 6). The use of a valid and reliable biomarker would be a valuable addition to the diagnostic process for TBI in conjunction with clinical evaluation and imaging diagnostics.\nThe hazards of radiation exposure are well known, as reported by Brenner and Hall, Smith-Bindman et al., and Braganza et al. [19\u201321]. In this study, the patient group was selected among children treated in a hospital ward for suspected acute TBI. At hospital discharge, all the patients had received a diagnosis of mTBI. Family members of the hospital staff members formed the healthy control group. Surprisingly, among the healthy controls, two study subjects showed significant changes in glycan levels in saliva, and two others showed significant changes in glycan levels in urine; neither were aware of any previous TBI. It is possible that the subjects had earlier suffered a mTBI but were not aware of the symptoms at the time of recruitment into the study, thereby considering themselves healthy. Males are generally overrepresented among TBI patients in comparison to females [22]. In order to secure age and sex matching in each study group, the recruitment period was extended in this study until adequate matching was obtained. Of the 28 patients hospitalized with TBI, only three (11%) were assessed to have TBI-induced changes in brain imaging (either CT or MRI). In other studies, the prevalence of positive findings varied between 4.7% and 19% among TBI patients that underwent brain CT imaging [8]. The number of patients in this study was limited, and thus it is premature to conclude whether glycan detection could help with decision-making in cases of mTBI. The main objective of the study was to determine whether concentrations of glycans were altered by brain injury. The findings are of sufficient interest to continue with the study by including more patients with only mTBI and CT or MRI images showing clear traumatic lesions. Significant increases in some glycans were observed in the saliva and urine, implying that, upon further development, such glycans may serve as biomarkers of TBI and could possibly be detected with a rapid and portable diagnostic kit. The use of a rapid test to detect TBI offers several advantages [3]. A rapid test would facilitate decision-making when the test results are easily available at a low cost. A sufficiently sensitive biomarker test may accelerate and facilitate the diagnostic process and thus reduce the need for a head CT scan. A biomarker test can easily be repeated when the initial results are negative but suspicion of mTBI remains. A multivariate analysis of all 95 lectin-binding results could potentially offer additional information on usable combinations of biomarkers for testing TBI. One patient with TBI had a surprisingly pathologically elevated blood sugar level (11.2 mmol/L), implying diabetes. Strictly speaking, the patient should have been excluded from the study based on the exclusion criteria but was included as the disease was not previously diagnosed. The mean (SD) blood sugar level for the injured patients was 6.8 mmol/L (2.06 mmol/L). The accuracy of the assessment depends on the number of people making the patient assessments. In this study, the GCS scores were independently assessed by a total of 15 health professionals; radiologic statements were made by eight radiologists; and the number of doctors in charge of the treatment was eight. The fact that multiple people participated in the treatment of the patients may lead to some variation among the results, but this is difficult to control and normalize in a clinical setting. Imaging, while considered the gold standard for assessing brain damage, carries a risk of radiation. In general, CT is available in the emergency department, whereas MRI is not. Children\u2019s brains are extremely vulnerable to radiation [19\u201322] and a CT of the brain introduces a radiation dose of 2.1 mSv [19]. In the present study, only 10 of 28 patients underwent a head scan by either CT or MRI. In cases of mTBI, radiologic reports have limited use for assessing TBI cases. Patients suspected of having a more severe injury were referred for imaging. The clinicians found three patients with signs of brain injury based on the imaging, but according to the statements of the radiologists, only one patient had possible intracerebral bleeding. The other two patients had skull bone fractures, but no brain bleeding. The results are consistent with expectations, as the selection criterion for the study group was suspected mild TBI.\nThe glycan results are parallel to the clinical assessment since all patients had statistically significant differences in at least some glycans in both saliva and urine in comparison to the healthy group. It may be assumed that glycans, or something that affects glycan detection, are released by a rupture of the blood-brain barrier, and altered glycan levels serve as an indication of brain injury. Intact brain blood barrier levels would be associated with normal glycan levels. The literature on the connection between human TBI and glycans is limited. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification, and it is suggested that more than half of all proteins are glycosylated [23]. The concept of glycans as potential biomarkers of disease has only recently emerged. Changes in glycan expression in cancer cells have been studied as a cancer diagnostic, and recent research on glycan biomarkers has yielded several new diagnostic approaches [24,25]. For example, a glycosylated fraction of \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker for liver tumor, was found to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma from benign liver disease better than the total protein analysis of AFP [26,27]. In the central nervous system, changes in glycan profiles have been detected in animal studies in connection with neurological pathologies and the development of neurodegenerative conditions after TBI [28,29]. A recent study reported alterations in human serum glycome in moderate and severe TBI [30]. The clinical usefulness of biomarkers for mTBI diagnostics is overt, as the results of the study suggest. The use of a biomarker test does not require the involvement of professional staff nor sophisticated imaging equipment. It will be time-saving and expedite the diagnostic process. The ideal biomarker of brain injury should exclude a brain injury and thereby reduce the need for acute radiological examinations. This study involved a small number of patients, and therefore, all findings should be regarded as preliminary. However, glycans may bear potential for serving as biomarkers of brain injury, and they can be detected using straightforward binding tests, which grounds the development of easier and more affordable detection methods for concussion and mild brain injury."
