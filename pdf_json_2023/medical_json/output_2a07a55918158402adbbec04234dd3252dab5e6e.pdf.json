    "abstractText": "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Yet, the autoimmune targets are still undefined. The extracellular e1 sequence of KCNJ10, the inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1, has been subject to fierce debate for its role as a candidate autoantigen in multiple sclerosis. Inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 is expressed in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues, raising concerns about the central nervous system-specificity of such autoreactivity. Immunization of C57Bl6/J female mice with the e1 peptide (amino acids 83\u2013120 of Kir4.1) induced anti-e1 immunoglobulin Gand T-cell responses and promoted demyelinating encephalomyelitis with B cell central nervous system enrichment in leptomeninges and T cells/macrophages in central nervous system parenchyma from forebrain to spinal cord, mostly in the white matter. Within our cohort of multiple sclerosis patients (n = 252), 6% exhibited high anti-e1 immunoglobulin G levels in serum as compared to 0.7% in the control cohort (n = 127; P = 0.015). Immunolabelling of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1-expressing white matter glia with the anti-e1 serum from immunized mice increased during murine autoimmune neuroinflammation and in multiple sclerosis white matter as compared with controls. Strikingly, the mouse and human anti-e1 sera labelled astrocytoma cells when N-glycosylation was blocked with tunicamycin. Western blot confirmed that neuroinflammation induces Kir4.1 expression, including its shorter aglycosylated form in murine experimental autoencephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. In addition, recognition of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 using mouse anti-e1 serum in Western blot experiments under unreduced conditions or in cells transfected with the N-glycosylation defective N104Q mutant as compared to the wild type further suggests that autoantibodies target an e1 conformational epitope in its aglycosylated form. These data highlight the e1 sequence of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 as a valid central nervous system autoantigen with a disease/tissue-specific post-translational antigen modification as potential contributor to autoimmunity in some multiple sclerosis patients.",

Yet, the autoimmune targets are still undefined. The extracellular e1 sequence of KCNJ10, the inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1, has been subject to fierce debate for its role as a candidate autoantigen in multiple sclerosis. Inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 is expressed in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues, raising concerns about the central nervous system-specificity of such autoreactivity. Immunization of C57Bl6/J female mice with the e1 peptide (amino acids 83\u2013120 of Kir4.1) induced anti-e1 immunoglobulin G- and T-cell responses and promoted demyelinating encephalomyelitis with B cell central nervous system enrichment in leptomeninges and T cells/macrophages in central nervous system parenchyma from forebrain to spinal cord, mostly in the white matter. Within our cohort of multiple sclerosis patients (n = 252), 6% exhibited high anti-e1 immunoglobulin G levels in serum as compared to 0.7% in the control cohort (n = 127; P = 0.015). Immunolabelling of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1-expressing white matter glia with the anti-e1 serum from immunized mice increased during murine autoimmune neuroinflammation and in multiple sclerosis white matter as compared with controls. Strikingly, the mouse and human anti-e1 sera labelled astrocytoma cells when N-glycosylation was blocked with tunicamycin. Western blot confirmed that neuroinflammation induces Kir4.1 expression, including its shorter aglycosylated form in murine experimental autoencephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. In addition, recognition of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 using mouse anti-e1 serum in Western blot experiments under unreduced conditions or in cells transfected with the N-glycosylation defective N104Q mutant as compared to the wild type further suggests that autoantibodies target an e1 conformational epitope in its aglycosylated form. These data highlight the e1 sequence of inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 as a valid central nervous system autoantigen with a disease/tissue-specific post-translational antigen modification as potential contributor to autoimmunity in some multiple sclerosis patients.\n1 INSERM, Nantes Universit\u00e9, CHU Nantes, Center for Research in Transplantation and Translational Immunology (CR2TI), UMR 1064, Nantes 44000, France 2 Service de Neurologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes 44000, France 3 CIC Inserm 1413, CHU Nantes, Nantes 44000, France 4 Neurologie, Institute of Neuroscience, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Bruxelles 1200, Belgium\nReceived April 01, 2022.

Now, MOG\u2013IgG-associated encephalomyelitis is considered a disease entity on its own.15 Thus, high Kir4.1 IgG-positive patients could also belong to a specific nosological entity within a larger multiple sclerosis spectrum disorder. However, the absence of an in vivo model showing deleterious effects of e1 autoreactivity in the CNS has impeded the consideration of Kir4.1 as a valid autoantigen candidate.\nInwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 (encoded from KCNJ10 gene) is expressed by astrocytes and oligodendroglia16\u201320 and plays a role in K + spatial buffering and myelination.21\u201323 The loss-of-function mutations in human KCNJ10 lead to SeSAME (seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, mental impairment and renal electrolyte imbalance) syndrome.24,25 Glial Kir4.1 deficiency in mice results in ataxia, seizures, hindlimb paralysis, white matter (WM) vacuolization, growth retardation and premature death26 while Kir4.1 loss in kidney tubules accounts for the salt retention defect.27 In the context of multiple sclerosis, it is likely that e1 autoreactivity, if present, does not affect peripheral cells such as renal tubular cells. Increasing molecular insights into tissue-specificity and epitope-specific targeting is a key issue for understanding autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the e1 sequence contains an asparagine at position 104, offering a potential N-glycosylation site,28 and molecular weight (MW) of Kir4.1 monomer in the brain has been reported lower than in the kidney.29 Post-translational modifications are increasingly recognized as determinant for antibody\u2013antigen interactions by favouring either antigen recognition11 or immune camouflage via N-glycosylation.30 The use of recombinant Kir4.1 protein with high levels of N-glycosylation may partly explain the difficulty in determining Kir4.1 IgG \u2018high responders\u2019 in some of the previous studies.31 How anti-e1 autoreactivity could target CNS cells while sparing other cells that express high levels of Kir4.1 remains undefined. Here, we present in vivo and in vitro data that support the aglycosylated e1 loop of Kir4.1 as a valid CNS WM-specific antigen candidate, notably for a subset of multiple sclerosis patients that exhibit high anti-e1 IgG autoreactivity."

One month after, all mice were challenged s.c. with 100 \u00b5l of PBS/CFA emulsion, followed immediately and 48 h after by 300 ng i.p. pertussis toxin injections. Mice were scored daily for typical experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) signs according to the standard 0\u20135 paralysis (typical EAE) scale with an additional score +1 added when atypical EAE was observed (see extended methods for details in Supplementary Material). At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate buffer. The spinal cords and brains were post-fixed and sucrose-protected at 4\u00b0C, frozen in dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until cutting. In order to measure anti-e1 serum IgG, blood sampling was performed at the sinus at 1 and 2 months after the first boot. A pool of sera from five e1-immunized mice was kept for immunofluorescence and Western blots.

The gender ratio was 115F/ 64M and the average age of 42 \u00b1 1 years (range: 19\u201373). Four patients were treated with glatiramer acetate, four with dimethylfumarate, 9 with natalizumab, 9 with an S1P modulator, 13 with mycophenolate mofetil, 13 with teriflunomide and 17 with interferon beta. The sera from 86 healthy volunteers (HV gender ratio, 65F/21M; age, 36 \u00b1 1 years, range: 20\u201365) collected at the same time were processed simultaneously. The second cohort consisted of patients that presented, at time of blood sampling, a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), defined as a first mono- or multifocal neurological deficit lasting for more than 24 h and not associated with fever or infection, thus compatible with a first presentation of multiple sclerosis.32,33 Clinically isolated syndrome patients from UCLouvain34 and from the Nantes Hospital were used. The gender ratio was 70F/15M and the average age of 41 \u00b1 1 years (range: 17\u201378). None were under treatment at blood sampling. Sera from 41 HV (gender ratio, 34F/7M; age, 38 \u00b1 2 years, range: 25\u201362) received at the same time were processed simultaneously. All sera were coded, alternating HV and patients to allow an appropriate repartition for serum testing in each ELISA plate. Sera were coded and kept at \u221220\u00b0C until use. All donors from the Nantes Hospital provided informed consent in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and our local hospital ethical committee. Samples from the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain) were obtained in conformity with local regulatory and ethical requirements for the residual use of serum samples collected for routine diagnostic procedures or patient care, without additional requirement for informed consent (ethical approval 2007/10SEP/233).\nAnti-e1 immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay After coating 96-well NuncMaxiSorp\u2122 plates overnight at 4\u00b0C with e1 peptide diluted at 10 \u00b5g/ml in 25 mM borate buffer (pH 9), wells were blocked with PBS Tween-20 0.05% (PBST) and 5% BSA for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, incubated with mouse (1:500\u20131:2000) or human (1:2000) sera in PBST and 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After three PBST\nwashes, the corresponding secondary antibody coupled to HRP (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. TMB substrate (Sigma Aldrich) was added, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5l H2SO4 0.5 M. Optical density was read at 450 nm using Spark10M multimode microplate reader (Tecan). For human samples, sera were processed in duplicate with 2\u20133 plates per series. In each plate, eight serial dilutions of a pooled serum internal control from e1-immunized mice and of a human serum internal control (pooled from three multiple sclerosis samples) served as positive day-to-day and plate-to-plate controls. Human specimens were considered high responders (HR) when the optical density exceeded the cutoff value, set at 2.5 SD above the HV mean.\nInwardly rectifying potassium channel"

This was insufficient to trigger EAE, but when the recipients of the Kir4.1 peptide pool were co-immunized with 50 \u00b5g MOG35-55 that induces mild relapsing\u2013remitting EAE, we observed that these animals later developed significantly more severe symptoms between 1 and 2 months postimmunization as compared to animals immunized with MOG35-55 alone (Supplementary Fig. 1). This suggested that a delayed Kir4.1 autoantibody response was responsible for the increased deficits. To increase anti-e1 antibody production, mice were vaccinated with three boluses of e1 peptide in PBS/IFA. The e1-immunized mice did not develop neurologic symptoms. One month after the first bolus, the CFA/pertussis toxin (PTX) challenge was used to alter the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, as previously reported.38,39 In this context, one-third of the e1-immunized mice develop clinical signs of encephalomyelitis (Fig. 1A), starting with well-known symptoms of typical EAE (7/23 mice, mean day of onset: 10.3 \u00b1 0.5) and further signs of\natypical EAE (9/23 mice, mean day of onset: 22.6 \u00b1 2.4).

CD45-immunoreactivity (IR) confirmed the lack of immune cell parenchymal infiltrates in two non-symptomatic e1-immunized mice and three IFA/CFA/PBS control mice (not shown). In symptomatic mice, the most striking observation was the presence of CNS B cells in forebrain leptomeninges at the border of demyelinated WM tracts and in perivascular cuffs in demyelinated cerebellar WM; these B cells, as Ly6G + cells (granulocytes) did not invade deeply the parenchyma (Fig. 2A\u2013J). Parenchymal inflammatory foci were however enriched in CD3+ T cells and macrophages/activated microglia (F4/80 + or Iba+). Scarce T cells were also found in the WM tracts such as corpus callosum, fimbria, stria terminalis, ventral hippocampal commissure or spinal trigeminal tract in the brainstem. Moreover, some small foci of perivascular T cells were observed in the grey matter such as in the striatum, and isolated T cells could be observed in the cortical grey matter, such as the somatomotor and occipital cortices (Supplementary Fig. 3B, D\u2013F). Close to demyelinated arbor vitae cerebelli (Fig. 2K\u2013R), isolated T cells were found in the molecular layer of the cerebellum (mo) with scarce immune cells in the granule layer (gr, Fig. 2R). In the spinal cord (Fig. 3A and B, D\u2013G), perimeningeal patches of demyelination (Fig. 3D) or immune cell infiltration (Fig. 3E\u2013G) were observed all along the rostro\u2013caudal axis in the five symptomatic mice tested, with B-cell clusters mostly restricted to leptomeninges and\u2014as in the brain\u2014with only few B cells invading the nearby WM. The optic nerves presented variable immune cell infiltration, ranging from 1 to 50 CD45 + immune cells per section (Fig. 3C) with scarce parenchymal B cells. Moreover, as numerous T cells infiltrated the molecular layer of two mice that exhibited severe cerebellar demyelination, we examined the integrity of the underlaying Purkinje cell monolayer using Neurotrace (Fig. 3H\u2013K) and of Kir4.1-expressing Bergman glia, that form a strictly arranged system of parallel GFAP-labelled fibres (Fig. 3L) important for Purkinje cell function and survival.16 Just above the inflammatory cuffs in the arbor vitae, the Purkinje layer was indeed discontinued (Fig. 3J) with an estimated 30% reduction in cell number, and the Bergman glial fibres were disrupted with GFAP patchy-like staining (Fig. 3M), in contrast to lobules from control mice (Fig. 3I and L) or to distant lobules from the same mice (Fig. 3K and N)."

In mouse kidney, cortical tubules were highly labelled with the Cter antibody but not with the mouse anti-e1 serum (Fig. 5G\u2013I), suggesting that posttranslational modifications such as the high N-glycosylation of Kir4.1 reported in this tissue28,29 prevents recognition by the anti-e1 serum. In the CNS, e1-immunoreactivity was also barely detected on Bergman glial fibres, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes of WM tracts, layer I cortical astrocytes (data not shown) and cortical perivascular endfeet or hippocampal stellate astrocytes in contrast to the strong Cter-immunoreactivity. However, treatment of sections with PNGase F resulted in increased e1-immunoreactivity on cortical microvessel astrocytic endfeet and hippocampal stellate astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 4) suggesting that a higher e1 glycosylation status in these cell populations hampered detection by the mouse anti-e1 serum.\nIncreased e1-immunoreactity in astrocytoma cells after tunicamycin treatment Western blot analysis of crude membrane preparations from U-251 astrocytoma cells revealed major bands between 42\u2013 45 and 50 kDa with the rabbit anti-Cter antibody, whereas the human HR serum and the mouse anti-e1 serum failed to give significant signal (data not shown) suggesting that anti-e1 antibodies contained in these sera poorly recognize the linear (denatured and reduced) forms (glycosylated or not) of Kir4.1. We thus examined e1-immunoreactivity on fixed U-251 astrocytoma cells that were treated or not with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. Using the Cter antibody, we confirmed that this cell line highly expresses Kir4.1 at the cell surface and intracellularly, whereas the mouse anti-e1 serum only gave a faint signal around the\nFigure 4 High Kir4.1 anti-e1 IgG reactivity in a subset of multiple sclerosis/CIS patients. According to the new criteria,40 we examined whether CIS patients were presenting lesion dissemination in space at time of blood sampling (group DIS+) or not (group DIS-), or whether they developed a second clinical attack within 6 months (multiple sclerosis conversion, CONV group) or not (non-CONV group). Information for dissemination was not available for four patients. The CIS patients that were DIS + and/or CONV (CIS + group, n = 73), representing a first episode of multiple sclerosis (MS), were added to the first multiple sclerosis cohort to calculate the % of HR patients in multiple sclerosis.

Tunicamycin treatment resulted in increased e1-immunoreactivity that was abolished by preadsorbtion of the mouse serum with e1 peptide (Fig. 5M\u2013O). Similarly, the HR serum gave only punctate signals in the cytoplasm of untreated U-251 cells, and tunicamycin treatment resulted in increased intracellular immunoreactivity that was inhibited by e1-preadsorbtion of the serum (Fig. 5P\u2013R). Taken together, these data showed that the anti-e1 mouse and HR sera preferentially bind to the aglycosylated e1 domain of Kir4.1.\nIncreased glial e1 inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1 immunoreactivity in multiple sclerosis white matter We further determined whether e1-immunoreactivity differs from Cter-immunoreactivity in human control and multiple sclerosis brains. In control samples, Cter-labelling was well identified and homogenously distributed on glial fibres. However, the immunolabelling of the glial fibres with the mouse anti-e1 serum was faint, and only few oligodendrocyte-like cells were weakly labelled (with a ringshaped pattern above the nucleus) by this antibody as for scarce astrocytes (Fig. 6A\u2013C, Supplementary Fig. 5). In multiple sclerosis (Fig. 6D\u2013I), increased Cter-immunoreactivity was observed on glial fibres in active WM lesions as compared to normal appearing white matter (NAWM). The mouse anti-e1 serum-stained oligodendrocyte-like cells and revealed ring-shaped and fibre-like labelling. Several strongly labelled WM astrocytes were also evidenced. The quantification of Cter or anti-e1 fluorescence intensities in multiple sclerosis lesions versus controls indicated a 1.5-fold and a 2-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 6M). To determine whether inflammation in the periphery increases similarly anti-e1 reactivity, we analysed two specimens of kidney cortices obtained by biopsy from humans affected by chronic tubule interstitial nephritis versus two healthy preimplant controls. Anti-Cter Kir4.1 antibodies clearly labelled a subset of tubules, whereas the mouse anti-e1 serum did not stain\nthese structures (Fig. 6J\u2013L). Taken together, these results suggest that inflammation increases anti-e1 reactivity in the CNS but not in the peripheral tissues such as kidney.\nCentral nervous system inwardly rectifying potassium channel 4.1, including its shorter form, is upregulated during neuroinflammation We first evaluate Kir4.1 expression and molecular weight forms by Western blot using archival fresh-frozen EAE spinal cords from five MOG35-55-immunized mice (classical EAE, mean score 3, days post-immunization 16\u201324) and their corresponding CFA/PBS-treated controls. Using crude membrane extracts, a major band between 37 and 45 kDa was evidenced with the Cter antibody (Fig. 7A, top). Relative quantification indicates a 2-fold increase of Kir4.1 expression at 37\u201342 kDa and a 3-fold increase at \u223c30 kDa in EAE samples. As expected, mouse IgG was highly detected in EAE samples (Fig. 7A, bottom). Total protein labelling on the PVDF membrane with DB71 stain ensured homogeneity of samples (data not shown). Altogether, this suggests an increase in Kir4.1 expression in the inflamed spinal cord, including a smaller \u223c30 kDa Kir4.1 form, representing about 10% of Cter Kir4.1 signal. Overnight PNGase treatment of a mouse spinal cord sample decreased the intensity of the bands above 39 kDa and favoured the appearance of the 33 kDa form, likely corresponding to a cleavage fragment of the deglycosylated Kir4.1 monomer (Fig. 7B). Reprobing with the mouse anti-e1 and the HR serum failed to give any significant signal above background (data not shown).\nWe then examined Kir4.1 expression in human WM active lesions and controls. Kir4.1 detection using the anti-Cter antibody revealed molecular forms between 37 and 48 kDa, that were strongly increased in multiple sclerosis samples (Fig. 7C). We next compared samples from a control subject and from a patient affected by severe acute neuroinflammation, after or without overnight PNGase treatment. Since our mouse anti-e1 serum failed to detect\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /braincom m s/article/5/2/fcad044/7050919 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nFigure 6 Increased Kir4.1 immunoreactivity in multiple sclerosis brain.

This antibody identified Kir4.1 at 37 and 42 kDa in the control sample, whereas only a 37\u2013 38 kDa band was detected in the inflamed white matter which is highly enriched in human IgGs (Fig. 7D). PNGase digestion resulted in the appearance of a 30\u201333 kDa form at the expense of the 37\u201342 kDa forms; this was even more noticeable with the inflamed WM. Since the 30\u201333 kDa band was not detected by the anti-Kir4.193-106, we conclude that it is a Cter cleavage fragment of Kir4.1 missing its \u223c100 first amino acids. Thus, the lowest molecular weight form of intact linear Kir4.1 monomer corresponds to the 37 kDa band. In conclusion, Kir4.1 expression is not only increased but also exhibits a shorter form in inflamed white matter.\nRecognition of the conformational aglycosylated e1 domain As our mouse and HR anti-e1 sera poorly detected the linear forms of Kir4.1 in classical Western blots, we also used unreduced conditions (without DTT) using crude membrane extracts of a multiple sclerosis WM-enriched sample with Kir4.1 bands between 37 and 50 kDa. We hypothesized that keeping disulphide bonds including Cys108\u2013Cys14043 would help maintain some e1 secondary structure, favouring its recognition by anti-conformational e1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7E, the Kir4.1 bands revealed by anti-Cter in reduced conditions were again barely detected with the mouse anti-e1 serum. The unreduced condition delayed Kir4.1 monomer migration as expected, with new signals detected between 130 and 120 kDa with the anti-Cter. Only, this latter band was detected with the mouse anti-e1 serum, suggesting recognition of the unreduced Kir4.1 monomer with its aglycosylated e1 domain.\nTaken together, Western blot data with immunocytochemical experiments suggest that the mouse or HR anti-e1 IgGs better recognize the aglycosylated conformational e1 domain (Fig. 8A and B). In order to better visualize epitope accessibility, we used free-available bioinformatics tools. As shown in Fig. 8C\u2013E, the peptide sequence around Asn104 appears well accessible to putative antibodies when Asn is not glycosylated. Using the GlycoEP prediction tool,45 we checked that the sequence flanking Asn104 indeed fulfilled the characteristics of a prototypic N-glycosylation\nsite (score: + 0.81 for Kir4.1). In contrast, Asn104 is not in a favorable N-glycosylation site for Kir5.1 (score: \u22120.78). The GlyProt tool46 was used to visualize in silico a simple or complex N-glycans attached to Asn104 on the 3D protein structure of Kir4.1 tetramer, showing that glycosylation of the e1 epitope can hinder accessibility to conformational e1 autoantibodies (Fig. 8F).\nFinally, to support the importance of the glycosylation state in the e1 loop for antibody recognition, we used CHO cells that were transfected with a wild-type human Kir4.1 construct versus its mutant with defective N-glycosylation at amino acid 104 (N104Q). Indeed, while Cter antibody detected equally WT and N104Q transfected cells, anti-e1 serum recognized 3-fold better N104Q Kir4.1 transfected cells than the WT version (Fig. 8G)."

All the immunized mice developed high levels of serum anti-e1 IgGs, suggesting that tolerance to this sequence can be broken despite peripheral Kir4.1 expression. This is the first report showing that the immunization with the e1 sequence promotes in vivo CNS autoimmune damage, supporting Kir4.1 as a valid antigen candidate that could favour CNS autoimmunity. We indeed found that a subset of multiple sclerosis patients exhibits high serum levels of anti-e1 IgG. Moreover, our data point that the peculiar autoreactivity against the conformational aglycosylated e1 domain explain why previous cell-based assays or classical Western blot were not suitable to accurately detect this specific autoreactivity.5,47\nAnti-e1 autoreactivity promotes central nervous system immune cell infiltration and demyelinating encephalomyelitis A specific feature of e1-immunized mice is the development of atypical EAE associated with typical EAE.

Another specific observation is the unexpected presence of B cells in WM perivascular regions and periventricular or spinal cord leptomeninges. Moreover, in the cerebellum of mice severely affected by atypical EAE, demyelinated foci with high inflammatory cuffs were associated with adjacent alterations in the Purkinje cell layer and Bergman glia integrity. Symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia, dysarthria or tremor) are commonly observed in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis, and in few cases Purkinje cell loss adjacent to focal demyelinated folia has been indeed reported.48,49 Whether such focal leukocortical lesions associated with adjacent grey matter lesions can be a feature of deleterious Kir4.1 autoreactivity in humans\u2014as observed in e1-immunized mice\u2014will require further investigation. Besides cerebellum, most grey matter and WM astrocytes were preserved in e1-immunized mice since there was no cavitation such as observed in prototypic astrocytopathies (e.g. Alexander disease). Moreover, high glycosylated Kir4.1 may protect most cell populations from autoantibody recognition. It is striking that the aglycosylated e1-immunoreactivity was not detected in grey matter Kir4.1-positive astrocytes. Accordingly, in our HR patients, no neurological signs associated with grey matter astrocytic Kir4.1-linked dysfunctions were reported, such as those reported in autism-associated disorders50 or Huntington\u2019s disease model.51 Similarly, we did not see anti-conformational e1-immunoreactivity on Cter-immunoreactive distal tubules in human kidney biopsies. KCNJ10 mutations are often associated with SeSAME syndrome including salt retention deficits in tubules that express Kir4.1.24,25 However, the HR patients had no reported signs of kidney dysfunction as in multiple sclerosis in general. This suggests that the e1-autoimmunity develops in the inflamed CNS but not in periphery. Indeed, Kir4.1 expression is weak in normal white matter but increases in EAE and multiple sclerosis. The aglycosylated e1-immunoreactivity follows this pattern supporting the notion that preferential targets of e1 autoreactivity reside in oligodendroglia and some astrocytes, especially during neuroinflammation. Interestingly, KCNJ10 mutations are not necessarily associated with renal tubulopathy52 and have been recently associated with WM oedema, supporting an important role of\nKir4.1 for CNS glia,53 restricted slowly progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy53,54 or progressive spasticity,55 thus giving importance of the phenotypic heterogeneity and localized role of Kir4.1 dysfunction.\nImportance of detecting anti-conformational e1 epitope autoreactivity in multiple sclerosis Since the initial report indicating that half of multiple sclerosis patients exhibit anti-Kir4.1(e1) IgG, low reliability of anti-e1 IgG reactivity in multiple sclerosis has been claimed by others. Transfected cells are often used to assess IgG reactivity towards MOG or other candidate antigens in their most natural conformational state.14,56 However, these cells can have high glycosylation activity and thus may not be suitable to reproduce aglycosylated or low glycosylated candidate CNS autoantigens. Our data imply that standard cell lines may not be adequate to screen anti-e1 antibodies. Indeed, the high level or complexity of Kir4.1 glycosylation by cell lines such as the U-251 line does not correspond with the endogenous protein expressed by glial cells in situ, especially during neuroinflammation, where the e1-glycosylation status is reduced. Another issue is that glycosylation generally results in protein stabilization.57 The reduced glycosylation state of Kir4.1 during inflammation may favour protein degradation and help antigen processing by immune cells. We indeed observed more Kir4.1 cleavage product when the CNS extracts were subjected to prolonged deglycosylation in vitro. The presence of antibody against myelin antigens and e1 from Kir4.1, associated with the reduced glycosylation state during neuroinflammation, may synergistically favour disease progression. Moreover, we noticed in immunized mice that B cells were present around blood vessels or in leptomeninges but had not infiltrated deeply the parenchyma, in line with the few cells of the B lineage reported in the neuroparenchyma in multiple sclerosis. Previous work using MOG-derived models has uncovered various modes of actions to explain how B cells and autoantibodies mediate autoimmune demyelination, including the deleterious role of autoantibodies,58,59 the priming of T cells by peripheral antigen-specific B cells60 and the reactivation of T cells in the CNS by B cell-derived cytokines61 or via secreted autoantibodies which concentrate and increase\nFigure 8 Continued and Asn104 exposed at the extracellular surface.

Our findings imply that lower e1 glycosylation expose a conformational neoepitope to the immune system. In line with this, it has been shown that decreasing general maturation of N-glycans in mice can lead to spontaneous autoimmunity63 with glycosylated myelin proteins normally contributing to the maintenance of immune tolerance.64 Similarly, N-glycosylation can favour immune evasion for non-self antigens.30 Strikingly, dysregulation of N-glycosylation due to combined genetic and environmental factors may increase the risk of multiple sclerosis.65 The link between dysregulated protein glycosylation in autoimmune diseases needs to be further addressed to open new avenues of specific biomarkers. Moreover, improving the knowledge of the various antigen reactivities is important since possible induction of specific Tregs using antigenic peptide-coated nanoparticules66 or of antigen-specific B regulatory cells67 may be used in the future to control the autoimmunity process.68"
