The Taiwan analyses used data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database (NHID) linked to temperature data from the Atmospheric and Hydrological Research Database. The study periods for both countries were limited to warm-season months (1 June\u2013 30 September) from 2016 through 2019.\nOur base study populations included unique patients 1) aged 65\u2013100 years, 2) with at least 90 days of Part D eligibility or NHID eligibility during the study period, and 3) at least one dispensing for insulin (including mixed products) during the 90 days of eligibility prior to the case day. We also defined mutually exclusive cohorts of sulfonylurea users (not concomitantly on insulin), defined as at least one prescription for an oral sulfonylurea medication up to 90 days prior to the index date, and a group of metformin users who were not prescribed any other diabetes medications during the Part D eligibility period (U.S. sample) and across all NHID eligibility (Taiwan cohort).\nIn each of the three cohorts for each country, we identified beneficiaries who developed serious hypoglycemia, defined as a primary emergency department (ED) visit or unplanned inpatient admission for hypoglycemia from 1 June through 30 September using a modified version of the ICD-10\u2013based algorithm originally developed by Ginde et al. (5,6) (Supplementary Materials). Daily HI values were determined for all ZIP codes in the contiguous U.S. using the PRISM model estimates closest to a ZIP code\u2019s population centroid. These data were then linked to patient-level data by residential ZIP code (4,7). For the Taiwan sample, postal code-level HI data were linked to the NHID by postal code. We calculated the daily HI for each ZIP/postal code using a regression equation by Rothfusz (8). We determined HI percentile cut points for each ZIP code and day based on the historical distribution of HI in the ZIP code from 1981 through 2010 on the day \u00b1 10 days (7,8). This distribution was then categorized into$99th, 95\u201398th, 85\u201394th, 75\u201384th, 25\u201374th, and <25th\npercentiles. Average HI in the $99th percentile by ZIP code is represented in Supplementary Fig. 1.\nCovariates examined included demographic factors (age group, sex, race/ ethnicity, climatic region), health care use factors (numbers of hospitalizations, medications, and ED or outpatient visits), comorbidities assessed from ICD-10 codes, and case-related covariates, including case month, year, and type of case (ED visit only vs. inpatient stay following ED admission).\nWe estimated the association between HI percentile and hypoglycemia among insulin users, sulfonylurea users, and metformin users using conditional logistic regression with a time-stratified case-crossover study design (9), for which we sampled up to five summer control days prior to the case day on the same day of the week within 5 weeks of the case date. We adjusted for time-varying factors (number of hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient visits, and medications). We also conducted additional analyses stratified by case month and climatic region. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with a two-sided statistical significance level of 0.05."

Among insulin users, the incidence of hypoglycemic events was 25.6 per 1,000 person-years (Supplementary Fig. 2). The Taiwan NHID covers 4 million older adults, of whom 282,716 had at least one insulin prescription in 2016\u20132019. Among insulin users, the incidence of serious hypoglycemia was 17.3 per 1,000 person-years (Supplementary Fig. 2). Insulin users in both countries had a high prevalence of cardiometabolic comorbidities, including >30% with diabetes complications (Supplementary\nFig. 3). Insulin users had a higher incidence of hypoglycemia than users of metformin (U.S.: 1.5, Taiwan: 4.7 per 1,000 person-years) and sulfonylureas (U.S.: 11.2, Taiwan: 8.3 per 1,000 personyears). Taiwanese patients overall had lower proportions of comorbidities than U.S. patients and were more likely to experience an inpatient hospitalization (Tables 1 and 2).\nThe risk of a serious hypoglycemic event among insulin users was 40% higher on days with a HI $99th percentile compared with the 25\u201374th percentile (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.38 [95% CI 1.28\u20131.48] for U.S. and 1.40 [1.21\u20131.62] for Taiwan). These findings remained largely consistent after adjustment for time-varying confounders (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Conversely, HI <25th percentile was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia (Fig. 1). Among U.S. beneficiaries, adjusted associations were stronger in September than in other summer months (Supplementary Table 2). Among U.S. beneficiaries using only long-acting insulin and among patients with type 1 diabetes, associations were similar to patterns seen in all insulin users (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Changing exposure to maximum temperature rather than HI also did not impact risk estimates (Supplementary Table 5). We did not observe substantial differences in overall risk of hypoglycemic events by climatic region (Supplementary\nTable 6).\nAmong 92,742 beneficiaries using sulfonylureas only, the unadjusted odds of a serious hypoglycemic event were 38% higher on days with a HI $99th percentile compared with a HI in the 25\u201374th percentile (OR 1.38 [95% CI 1.28\u20131.53]) for the U.S. (Fig. 2). These significant positive associations and the pattern of increasing risk with a higher HI seen in the U.S. were not seen among case subjects using only metformin (Fig. 2)."

A small singlecenter study in Germany (10) assessed the risk of hypoglycemia among patients seen by emergency medical personnel throughout the year and found that hypoglycemia risk was 15\u201318% higher at temperatures >20 C and <10 C compared\nD ow nloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/doi/10.2337/dc23-1189/740416/dc231189.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nD ow nloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/doi/10.2337/dc23-1189/740416/dc231189.pdf by guest on 09 January 2024\nwith 10\u201320 C, whereas an ecological study in Taiwan (11) assessing correlations between monthly average ambient temperatures and hypoglycemia ED visits showed higher rates of serious hypoglycemia during winter months compared with summer months; however, within the summer months, higher temperatures were associated with greater monthly incidence of hypoglycemia, which is in line with our findings. Physiologically, high temperatures, in a fashion akin to exercise, can increase peripheral and cutaneous vasodilation and insulin sensitivity (13). The combination of vasodilation, which can increase insulin delivery to peripheral tissues, and insulin sensitivity can result in significant drops in plasma glucose. The paradoxical increases in risk of hypoglycemia at colder temperatures in prior studies may be in part due to\n1) increases in metabolic rate in cold temperatures consuming glucose, 2) reactive hypoglycemia after a stress/shiver response, or 3) changes in exogenous insulin absorption at colder temperatures.\nOur study had several peculiar findings, most notably, the marked differences in risk of hypoglycemia by summer month, especially in September. We speculate that the higher risk in September in the U.S. is in part due to overall cooler, average temperatures decreasing physiological and behavioral preparedness for extreme heat (13). We speculate that Taiwan\u2019s higher risk in June/July may be in part due to decreased humidity and rainfall in August and September and greater adaptability to high temperatures.\nOur study has several limitations. Individuals with hypoglycemia were older, more frequently non-Hispanic Black in the U.S, and had more comorbidities than those without hypoglycemia. Since we used a case-only design, caution should be exercised in generalizing our results to broader populations and mild/ moderate hypoglycemia that may be asymptomatic. We were unable to capture sociobehavioral variables, such as outdoor activity, exercise, and diet, or changes in these variables and insulin dosing from control to case days, all of which can alter the risk of serious hypoglycemia. Furthermore, although the risk of exposure misclassification due to our short study period is low, there may still be differential misclassification of insulin use (e.g., a single dispensing may not reflect adherence or medication use across all 90 days of eligibility).\nOur study also has several strengths. We conducted a patient-level analysis\n1.00.5 1.5 1.70.3\n<25% (N=63)\n25-74% (N=2,338)\n75-84% (N=1,830)\n85-94% (N=2,360)\n95-98% (N=1,392)\n\u226599% (N=371)\nOdds ra o (95% CI)\n1.00.5 1.5 1.70.3\n<25% (N=4,316)\n25-74% (N=14,518)\n75-84% (N=3,986)\n85-94% (N=4,557)\n95-98% (N=1,940)\n\u226599% (N=1,012)\nOdds ra o (95% CI)\nU.S. Taiwan A B\nFigure 1\u2014The odds of hypoglycemia among insulin users are presented by percentile category of heat exposure, relative to the 25th to 74th percentile HI in the U.S. (A) and Taiwan (B).

We also matched on all measured and unmeasured time-invariant covariates using the case-crossover design. Our finding of elevated risk of hypoglycemia-related ED visits in older adults using insulin and exposed to extreme heat underscores the need for patients and providers to be aware and cautious that extreme heat may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Future studies should incorporate individual-level glucose data (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring) and temperature data to additionally understand the relationship between climate and mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia.\nAcknowledgments.
