As far as palladium catalysis is concerned, apart from the well-established direct activation and reaction patterns, the alkyne moiety has been introduced in some molecules as a directing group for the C\u2212H activation of aromatic rings under PdII catalysis, affording functionalised aryl substances (Scheme 1a).6\nRecently, our group and others uncovered that Pd0 could chemoselectively form h2-complexes with the alkene moiety of 1,3-enynes.7 As a result, the alkyne group could be HOMO (the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital)-raised upon p-Lewis\nDelivery System of the Education Ministry\nCenter for Drug Precision Industrial y, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, @scu.edu.cn; Fax: +86 28 85502609 dical University, Shapingba, Chongqing u.cn\nSI) available: Experimental procedures, s, NMR, HRMS spectra, and HPLC s 3i, rac-4d, 6c, 9f, 11g and 21.

It is expected that a ve-membered heteroarene tethered to an electron-withdrawing propiolate motif would be deactivated in a Friedel\u2212Cras (FC) reaction;9 nevertheless, the chemoselective coordination of Pd0 to the alkyne group, rather than the 2,3-double bond of the heteroarene, would be favoured, as illustrated in complex I (Scheme 1c). Therefore, an unusual FC addition reaction at 3-position of the heteroarene might be enhanced upon vinylogous activation of Pd0-p-Lewis base, even enantioselectively through remote control.10 Next, the resultant h3-complex II would undergo aromatisation via a b-H elimination or deprotonation process to give the FC adduct and Pd0 catalyst. Nevertheless, a few challenging issues, as briey summarised in Scheme 1c, need to be conquered.\nTable 1 Screening conditons for the asymmetric FC and Michael addition cascade of 2-indolyl propiolates 1 and a-cyano chalcone 2aa\nEntry 1 L Additive Solvent Yieldb (%) eec (%)\n1d 1a / / Toluene NR / 2e 1a / / Toluene 3a, 64 / 3f 1a / / Toluene NR / 4e 1a\u2032 / / Toluene NR / 5 1a L1 / Toluene 3a, 68 89 6 1a L2 / Toluene 3a, 68 77 7 1a L3 / Toluene 3a, 46 39 8 1a L4 / Toluene 3a, 76 41 9 1a L1 TBAB Toluene 3a, 86 86 10 1a L1 TBAB 1,4-Dioxane 3a, 89 84 11 1b L1 / 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 49 92 12 1b L1 TBAB 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 70 91 13g 1b L1 TBAB 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 86 92 14g 1b L1 TBAC 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 76 92 15g 1b L1 TBAI 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 81 91 16g 1b L1 KBr 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 52 92 17g,h 1b L1 TBAB 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 83 91 18g,i 1b L1 TBAB 1,4-Dioxane 3b, 50 73\na Unless noted otherwise, reactions were carried out with 1 (0.025 mmol), 2a (0.03 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (5 mol%), L (10 mol%) and additive (20 mol%) in solvent (0.25 mL) at 60 \u00b0C under Ar. b Yield of the isolated product. c Determined by HPLC analysis on a chiral stationary phase. d Without catalyst, for 24 h. e With Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mol%). f With Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%).\ng With 1b (0.1 mmol) and 2a (0.13 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (0.5 mL). h With Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol%), L1 (5 mol%) at 60 \u00b0C for 96 h. i With Pd2(dba)3 (1.25 mol%), L1 (2.5 mol%) at 80 \u00b0C for 96 h.\n10868 | Chem.

No reaction occurred aer heating in toluene at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h, indicating the indole moiety was indeed deactivated (Table 1, entry 1).11 Pleasingly, the conversions were smoothly promoted under the catalysis of Pd(PPh3)4, and a [3 + 2] annulation product 3a, via cascade FC reaction and intramolecular Michael addition, was isolated in a moderate yield with exclusive diastereoselectivity and E/Z-selectivity (entry 2). Nevertheless, no product was observed when Pd(OAc)2 was employed, suggesting a Lewis acid catalytic mode might not be involved (entry 3). In addition, no reaction occurred under Pd0 catalysis by using ester 1a\u2032, indicating the alkyne moiety was vital forthe vinylogous-type activation (entry 4). Encouraged by the above results, the asymmetric version was investigated by combining Pd2(dba)3 and various chiral phosphine ligands. Trost\u2019s ligand L1 showed good reactivity as well as enantioselectivity (entry 5), whereas inferior results were obtained with L2 and L3 bearing other aryl groups (entries 6 and 7). The one derived from chiral 1,2-cyclohexanediol (L4) gave a good yield, but poor enantioselectivity was observed, indicating the N-H group of L1might play an important role as a H-bonding donor (entry 8). Aer more screenings, interestingly, adding catalytic amounts of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) signicantly improved the yield without apparent effect on the enantioselectivity (entry 9). Further screenings of solvents indicated that using 1,4-dioxane was benecial for the reactivity (entry 10). In addition, employing N-benzyl indole 1b improved the ee value of corresponding adduct 3b (entry 11), and the yieldalso was signicantly improved by adding TBAB (entry 12). A better yield was obtained at a higher concentration (entry 13). Other additives were further tested. Both TBAC and TBAI provided comparable results (entries 14 and 15), but KBr demonstrated to be less effective (entry 16). These results indicated the ammonium cation was important to the reactivity, which was speculated that the ammonium salt might act as a counterion to stablilise intermeidate II aer the FC addition to acceptor 2a.12 Moreover, comparable data were gained with 5 mol% of Pd (entry 17), whereas both yield and enantioselectivity were dramatically decreased by further reducing catalyst loadings (entry 18)."

Actually, it has been demonstrated that Pd0 could form a stable complex by coordinating to a triple or double bond.20 In our case, the proposed intermediate I-1a or I7a indeed has been successfully detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis by mixing alkyne 1a or alkene 7a with Pd(PPh3)4, respectively (Fig. 2). Moreover, we carried out NMR studies on the in situ generated complexes. As outlined in Fig. 2a, the 1H NMR analysis showed that 3-H (H1) of alkyne 1a experienced apparent high-eld shis when Pd(PPh3)4 was added (6.06 vs. 6.83 ppm).

In addition, the\n13C NMR analysisexhibited that the signals of the triple bond of 1a disappeared (around 70\u221280 ppm) aer adding Pd(PPh3)4 (Fig. 2b), whereas new peaks were observedat the sp2-carbon region (C2 and C3, around 136 ppm); in contrast, C1 of 1a experienced signicant high-eld shis (105.1 vs. 112.4 ppm). Similarly, the signals of H1, H2, H3, C1, C2 and C3 of 7a were all high-eld shied in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4, according to the NMR experiments (Fig. 2c and d). These results well supported that the proposed complexes I-1a and I-7a would be formed, and veried the p-Lewis base activation of Pd0 through strong coordination to the unsaturated group.20\nWe also investigated the origins of enantioselectivity in the reaction of alkyne 1a and enone 2a. Based on the DFT calculation results, the FC addition step in which the rst C\u2212C bond was constructed, is the rate- and stereo-determining step.21 As shown in Fig. 3, four related transition states were considered. Transition states (R,S)-TS and (S,S)-TSwould lead to product (S,R)-3a via (R,S)-II and (S,S)-II, respectively, and the stereogenic centre at 3-C of indole would disappear through deprotonation/ aromatization. On the other hand, (R,R)-TS and (S,R)-TS would lead to enantiomer (R,S)-3a via similar transformations. Notably, H-bonding interaction between the NH group of L1 and the\n10872 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 10867\u201310874\ncarbonyl group of 1a is observed in (R,S)-TS and (R,R)-TS, while the other two transition states without H-bonding interaction exhibit higher energies [5.2 kcal/mol\u22121 for (S,S)-TS; 2.9 kcal/ mol\u22121 for (S,R)-TS]. The results indicate that the H-bonding is benecial for the reaction, which is consistent with the experimental results (Table 1, entry 5 vs. entry 8). Geometric structure analyses show that the forming C\u2212C bond in (R,R)-TS presents a pseudogauche conformation to avoid the steric repulsion between the ester group of 1a and the carbonyl of 2a. As a result, the dihedral angle DC1\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013H is 45.4 with apparent torsional strain. In contrast, (R,S)-TS possesses smaller torsional strain (referring to the corresponding DC1\u2013C2\u2013C3\u2013H = 57.4), thus leading to lower energy [0 kcal/mol\u22121 for (R,S)-TS vs. 1.0 kcal/mol\u22121 for (R,R)-TS]. Therefore, the most favourable transition state (R,S)-TS would afford (S,R)-3a as the major product aer annulation, which is consistent with the experimental observation.21"

Excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity were generally achieved for substantial substrate assemblies by employing a chiral Trost\u2019s bisphosphine ligand. Moreover, this vinylogous activation strategy via p-Lewis base catalysis was successfully expanded to deactivated indoles tethered to a 2-enone or acrylate motif, and even very remote C5-selective Friedel\u2212Cras reactions of similarly deactivated pyrroles and furans could be realised with remarkable enantioselectivity by using a chiral bifunctional phosphine ligand, further enriching the structural diversity and skeletal versatility of relevant products. In addition, NMR analysis and DFT calculations were conducted to rationalise the activation and stereocontrol pathways. We believe that this Pd0-p-Lewis base catalysis would nd more application in asymmetric synthesis."
