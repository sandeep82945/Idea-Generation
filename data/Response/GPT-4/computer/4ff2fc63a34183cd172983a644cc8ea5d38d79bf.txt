Empirical Validation of the Proposed Framework: While the proposed framework for mitigating challenges in distributed Scrum has been theoretically developed and preliminarily validated by expert review, there is a need for empirical validation. Future research could focus on conducting longitudinal case studies across various organizations that implement the framework. This would help in understanding the practical implications, adaptations required in different contexts, and the real-world effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Development of Advanced Communication and Collaboration Tools: The paper identifies communication, coordination, and collaboration as major challenges. There is an opportunity to research and develop advanced software tools specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration in distributed Scrum environments. These tools could integrate aspects of artificial intelligence to predict and mitigate communication gaps, cultural misunderstandings, and facilitate more effective project management.

Cross-Cultural Management Strategies in Distributed Scrum: Given the socio-cultural distances mentioned, future research could delve deeper into strategies for managing cross-cultural teams in distributed Scrum settings. This could involve studying the interplay between different cultural dimensions and Scrum practices, and how they affect team dynamics, trust, and project success. Developing a cultural competence framework tailored for Scrum teams could be an innovative contribution.

Investigation of Agile Practices in Large-Scale Distributed Projects: The paper focuses on distributed Scrum, which is typically more suited to smaller, co-located teams. An interesting area for future research could be the scalability of agile practices, including Scrum, in large-scale distributed software development projects. This research could explore modifications or integrations of Scrum with other agile frameworks (e.g., SAFe, LeSS) to address scalability challenges.

Hybrid Models of Distributed Scrum and Traditional Methodologies: Considering the unique challenges of distributed Scrum, there could be potential in exploring hybrid models that combine agile practices with traditional project management methodologies (such as Waterfall) for distributed settings. Research could focus on developing and testing these hybrid models to see if they offer a better balance of flexibility and structure, especially in complex projects with stringent regulatory requirements.
