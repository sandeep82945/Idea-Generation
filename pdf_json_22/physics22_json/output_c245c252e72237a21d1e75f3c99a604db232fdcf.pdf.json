Lyngby\nImplementing superconductors capable of proximity-inducing a large energy-gap in semiconductors in the presence of strong magnetic fields is a major goal towards applications of semiconductor/superconductor hybrid materials in future quantum information technologies. Here, we study the performance of devices consisting of InAs nanowires in electrical contact to molybdenum-rhenium (MoRe) superconducting alloys. The MoRe thin films exhibit transition temperatures \u223c 10 K and critical fields exceeding 6 T. Normal/superconductor devices enabled tunnel spectroscopy of the corresponding induced superconductivity, which was maintained up to \u223c 10 K, and MoRe based Josephson devices exhibit supercurrents and multiple Andreev reflections. We determine an induced superconducting gap lower than expected from the transition temperature, and observe gap softening at finite magnetic field. These may be common features for hybrids based on large gap, type-II superconductors. The results encourage further development of MoRe-based hybrids.\nThe potential for building topologically protected quantum information processors from low-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor hybrid materials1,2 drives significant efforts across a range of fields including experimental and theoretical physics, device engineering, and material science.3 The main branch of experimental studies centers around hybrid semiconductorsuperconductor devices employing a low band-gap, strong spin-orbit semiconductor such as InAs or InSb electrically connected to conventional superconductors such as aluminum4 or niobium.5 Aluminum is a type-I superconductor with a transition temperature of TC \u223c 1.5 K and low bulk critical magnetic field BC \u223c 10mT. Although restricting to thin (\u2264 10 nm) films and inplane fields allows operating devices in high fields, obviating these restrictions motivates the development of hybrid materials with higher transition temperatures and bulk compatibility with magnetic fields.6\u20138 Type-II superconducting films of niobium and niobium based alloys (NbT, NbTiN) are well developed for metallic superconducting devices and have been incorporated in semi/super hybrid materials and devices.5,6,9\u201311 However, despite a bulk TC \u2265 9 K, the induced superconducting gap in mesoscopic hybrids is often reduced to values comparable to those of Al5,6,12,13. This is typically attributed to the formation of Nb oxides, which are superconducting with a lower TNbOC \u2248 1.4 K, metallic, or magnetic,14 and prompts efforts to develop semiconductor/superconductor hybrids where the favourable bulk superconducting properties are retained at the mesoscale.6\u20138 Since epitaxy between the highest single-element TC superconductor and InAs has been demonstrated,8 focus must now turn to compound superconductors to further increase TC.\nHere we investigate type-II molybdenum-rhenium (MoRe) alloys with high TC \u2248 10 K and BC > 6 T15 as alternative materials for proximitizing InAs nanowires (NWs). The investigation of MoRe is further motivated\nby recent demonstrations of high quality MoRe superconducting resonators16 and bulk-like superconducting properties in very thin (4 nm) films, even with a relatively large oxygen content \u223c 10%17 suggesting tolerance to impurity incorporation exceeding that of Nb-based films. Finally, MoRe has been used as an electrode material in graphene,18\u201320 carbon nanotubes,21 and molecular22 superconducting devices, enabling operation in high magnetic field. However, a detailed spectroscopic study of the (sub-)gap properties of induced superconductivity from MoRe contacts has not been undertaken, and devices featuring semiconductors with large g-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling1,2 are lacking. We therefore fabricated MoRe/InAs-nanowire/TiAu (S-NW-N) tunneling spectroscopy devices and MoRe/InAs-nanowire/MoRe (S-NW-S) Josephson devices and demonstrate crucial features of hybrid devices, including an induced superconducting gap present up to TC, sub-gap states and multiple Andreev reflections, with high yield. Unexpectedly, we find a reduced induced superconducting gap compared to that expected from the measured TC of the contacts and a softening of the superconducting gap at low fields compared to BC of the contacts. We discuss possible reasons for these observations and future directions.\nMoRe thin films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering from a commercially available target of Mo0.5Re0.5 using a power of 150 W under a 4 mTorr of Ar. The resulting deposition rate was of 11 nm/min and 250 nm thick films were deposited on doped silicon substrates capped with 200 nm of SiO2 and patterning was achieved by conventional electron beam lithography and liftoff using a \u223c 350 nm thick poly methyl methacrylate resist. A 250 nm film thickness was chosen to ensure complete nanowire coverage, matching the typical thicknesses for Ti/Au contacts.6,8,23,24 Devices for bulk characterization of the MoRe films were in the form of 3 \u00b5m wide MoRe strips measured in a four-terminal configuration with a 20 \u00b5m separation of the inner voltage ar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n02 45\n4v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n4 N\nov 2\n02 2\n2 0.3\n0.1\n0.2\n0\n\u03c1 (\u00b5 \u2126 .m\n)\n20 \u03bcm\n1\u00b5m\n0\n0 3 B (T)T (K) 60 6 12\n0\n2\n4\nVg (V)\nG (2\ne2 /h\n)\n10 20 30 Device #11\nDevice #4 MoRe-NW-MoRe\n...\nMoRe Au Au\nDevice #3\nMoRe-NW-Au Device #1...\n(a) (b)\n(c)(d)\nMoRe\nMoRe\nTi/Au\n\u2534\nFIG. 1. (a,b) Dependence of the resistivity, \u03c1, on temperature and out-of-plane magnetic field, B\u22a5, respectively, for a 250 nm thick MoRe film. The transition temperature TC was 9.9 K, while the critical field was not reached up to 6 T. (c) SEM image of a typical S-NW-N device with MoRe (grey) and normal Ti/Au (yellow) electrodes. (d) Gate-dependence of the four terminal differential conductance G = dI/dV measured at fixed source-drain bias Vsd = 4 mV for eleven devices. In (b,d) the temperature was 15 mK\nprobes (see sketch on Fig. 1a). For hybrid devices, InAs NWs were grown by molecular beam epitaxy using Au catalyst particles following standard recipes23. NWs have diameters dNW = 100\u2212115 nm and lengths \u223c 10 \u00b5m. Individual NWs were transferred from the growth substrate to the device substrate using a manual micro-manipulator and located with respect to a predefined alignment grid by optical microscopy. SNW-N and S-NW-S devices have electrode separations of 95\u2212 130 nm and 140\u2212 365 nm, respectively, and Ar+ milling was performed before metal deposition with the aim of reducing native oxides and facilitating ohmic contacts. Figure 1c shows an SEM micrograph of a typical S-NW-N device. The electron density of the NW between the contacts was tuned by biasing the doped Si substrate at voltage Vg, and each electrode was split into two to allow a pseudo four-terminal measurement of the differential conductance G = dI/dVsd. As such, contributions from in-line resistances due to cryostat wiring/filtering are absent from measurements. Experiments were performed using standard lock-in techniques in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of \u223c 15 mK and equipped with a 6-1-1 T vector magnet. In total, we measured four S-NW-N devices, fabricated on the same chip, three of which \u2013 Devices 1-3 \u2013 exhibited a superconducting gap in tunneling spectroscopy, and nine S-NW-S devices (Devices 4-12, fabricated on a second chip), all of which exhibited a supercurrent (Supporting Figs. S2 and S3). In the following we present results from one representative device of each class; data from remaining\ndevices is presented in the Supporting Information. Figures 1a,b show the MoRe thin film resistivity, \u03c1, as a function of temperature and out-of-plane magnetic field (B\u22a5), respectively. The transition temperature was TC = 9.9 K and at base temperature, the film remained superconducting up to the highest possible fields in our setup, and thus the critical field BCMoRe exceeds 6 T. These values are similar to recent studies of MoRe thin films having TC of 8-10 K and BC of 8 T18,19, confirming the good quality and stoichiometry of our films.\nFigure 1d shows G(Vg) for all devices. The measurements were performed with finite bias Vsd = 4 mV, outside the MoRe superconducting gap (see Supporting information for measurement schematics). The conductance increases with Vg as expected for n-type InAs and reaches G \u223c 6\u22128e2/h at the highest Vg. The fluctuations in G(Vg) are reproducible for each device and attributed to universal conductance fluctuations as expected under these conditions.25 The data at the highest Vg in Fig. 1d implies an upper bound on the contact resistance of a few k\u2126, typical for metal contacts to InAs nanowires. Due to screening by the grounded, semi-conformal contact metal, the gate is expected to predominately tune the nanowire segment between the contacts, however, a weak gate-dependence of the contact resistance cannot be ruled out, which may occur due to the generation of potential barriers that extend laterally beyond the contacts, as observed previously for InAs nanowires26. The deviceto-device variation in conductance and threshold voltage is typical for these types of NWs, while the high yield (11/12) exceeds that typically obtained.6,8 The positive threshold voltage may be due to a Fermi level matching at the InAs/MoRe interface different from conventional InAs/Al or InAs/Au contacts, but other factors \u2013 charge traps, diameters, condition of cooldown, work-function etc. also influence the value. Positive threshold voltages as observed here are less common for InAs nanowires but key features of semiconductor/superconductor hybrids, e.g., hard induced gap, 2e-charging of islands, induced sub-gap states have also been demonstrated for wires with positive threshold voltages.8\nTo investigate the induced superconducting properties we focus first on the S-NW-N devices. Figure 2a shows G vs. Vsd and Vg close to pinch off. In this regime, quantum dots (QD) form in the junction,25 and when operated in Coulomb blockade, the QD acts as a tunnel barrier and the differential conductance, G = dI/dV , measures the density of states of the proximitized InAs24. The Vgdependent features observed at low bias are associated with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states arising from hybridisation between the QD levels and the superconducting contact28. Gate-independent features at higher bias can be associated with the superconducting gap, and/or bound states with an energy close to that of the gap. The induced superconducting gap is therefore estimated to be \u2206\u2217 \u223c 0.9 meV, although better certainty may be obtained in future measurements by utilising a device geometry where the density of states underneath the supercon-\n3 3\n0\n-3 3\n0\n-3 3\n0\n-3\nVg (V)\n(e)\n(d)\n(a)\n(c)\n(b)\n0.4\n0.2\n0 Linear\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\nLog\n-1.51.4 1.8 2.2 1.5 Vsd (mV)\nV sd\n(m V)\nV sd\n(m V)\nV sd\n(m V)\n0\n0 0.6\nG (2\ne2 /h ) G (2 e2 /h )\nG (2e2/h)\nB =1T\u2534\nB =0T\u2534\nB =2T\u2534\nFIG. 2.

Corresponding measurements for other devices yield \u2206\u2217 = 0.5 \u2212 0.9 meV (Supporting Fig. S1); we return to this variation below. The conventional Coulomb blockade (CB) diamonds are resolved in the corresponding measurements at finite perpendicular out-of-plane magnetic field, (B\u22a5), in Fig 2b,c, from which the charging energy EC \u223c 3 meV, level-spacing \u03b4E \u223c 1 meV, and a level broadening of \u223c 0.1 meV are estimated. The g-factor g \u223c 10.5 was estimated from the Zeeman splitting of the excited state and corresponding co-tunneling lines around Vg = 1.6 V (dotted lines in Fig. 2c).\nAn important metric for semiconductor/superconductor hybrids is the hardness of the induced gap24,30,31 conventionally quantified by the ratio of GS \u2261 G(Vsd = 0) to the out-of-gap conductance GN = G(Vsd > \u2206/e). Figures 2d,e show G(Vsd) for Vg fixed at the centre of three consequtive CB diamonds as indicated in Fig. 2a where YSR-states are pushed towards the gap edge. From Figure 2e we find a GN/GS \u223c 100 \u2212 150, close to the values found for hybrids with epitaxial and impurity-free interfaces6\u20138,23,24. However, contrary to the results of high-purity hybrids and metallic superconductors, the conductance in Fig. 2e is not uniformly reduced over the range of energies eVsd < \u2206\n\u2217 but rapidly increases with Vsd. This \u2019V\u2019-shape of G(Vsd)30 is observed in all three charge states and can be observed at biases below 0.25 meV far below any contributions to non-linearities of G(Vsd) related to inelastic co-tunneling through the excited state at \u03b4E\nwith a broadening of 0.1 meV. Instead, we attribute the \u2018V\u2019 shaped G(Vsd) to a disorder-related continuum of interface states,23,24,30\u201332 possibly related to our fabrication scheme which includes mechanical Ar-ion milling of the InAs surface in contrast to the \u2018U\u2019 shaped gap-profile of epitaxial electrodes24,32. In-situ deposition of MoRe,6,8,23,24,32 or careful surface cleaning7,33 would likely improve the sub-gap conductance profile. Note that the \u2018U\u2019-shape profile observed for hard-gap devices based on hybrids with similar \u2206, EC and \u03b4E \u223c 1 meV7,8 supports the notion that the presence of interface inhomogeneities dominates the G(Vsd) profile over possible secondary effects of, e.g., broadening due to Coulomb blockade at high biases, consistent with theory.30\nWe note that the magnitude of the induced gap \u2206\u2217 = 0.9 meV is lower than the value \u2206bulk = 1.75kBTC = 1.4 meV expected from the transition temperature TC = 9.9 K of the MoRe film (Fig. 1a). This is similar to MoRe/graphene devices showing a reduced \u2206\u2217 = 1.2 meV.18,20 In analogy with results from Nb-based devices this could be a consequence of oxidized or contaminated layers at the non-ideal InAs/MoRe interface9,12,24,30, defects in the superconductor34, and/or carrier density-dependent interface transparency.35 Alternatively, the larger \u2206bulk leads to a shorter coherence length \u2013 LBC = ~vF/\u2206bulk for ballistic transport and LDC = \u221a ~vFle/(2\u2206bulk) for diffusive transport \u2013 setting the scale beyond which \u2206\u2217 decays from the contact.36\u201338 Taking a typical Fermi velocity vF \u223c 2\u00d7 105 m/s and mean free paths le = 50\u2212 200 nm for InAs and \u2206bulk = 1.4 meV, we find LBC = 100 nm and LDC = 50\u2212100 nm, smaller than the electrode separation (130 nm for Dev. 1). Thus, the gap measured by tunnel spectroscopy through the QD may be reduced compared value immediately below the MoRe contacts.36\u201339 We therefore posit that we primarily probe the induced proximity properties of the InAs adjacent to the MoRe contacts, which may account for the varying values of \u2206\u2217 obtained throughout. Advanced device architectures featuring in-situ deposition of a thin, few facet, impurityfree MoRe layer would likely enable gate tuning of the proximitised region underneath the MoRe and exploration of its properties.29 Relatedly, the bias-asymmetry in conductance in Fig. 2a likely arises from an asymmetric coupling to the leads.\nA key motivation for investigating MoRe as an electrode material is the compatibility of its superconducting phase with magnetic fields. Returning to Figs 2b,c \u2013 which show bias spectra with B\u22a5 = 1 T and B\u22a5 = 2 T, respectively \u2013 we observe that although the MoRe films are superconducting to BCbulk > 6 T (Fig. 1a), the superconductivity-related features around zero bias are strongly suppressed (white arrows) compared to the zero field case in Fig. 1a. The field dependence is detailed in Fig. 3a,b which show measurements of G(Vsd) vs. B\u22a5 and B\u2016, respectively, at a fixed Vg = 1.8 V within a CB diamond corresponding to even occupancy of the QD (red arrow in Fig. 2a).

The slight differences in each G(Vsd)|B=0,T=15mK trace for the same Vg = 1.8 V arise from stochastic charge switches observed in e.g. (a) around B = 0.5 T. These small differences do not affect the qualitative conclusions of this work, and all data in this figure were collected within the same Coulomb blockade diamond.\nthe axis of the NW. In both cases, states detach from the gap edge and fill the gap at \u223c 0.35 T and 0.45 T for B\u22a5 andB\u2016, respectively. This evolution is emphasized in Fig. 3c,d showing extracted G(Vsd) for different fields, and in Fig. 3h, which shows GS and GN as a function of B. A reduced gap remains visible and GN/GS rapidly decreases for fields above 0.25 T. Similar observations have been reported for devices based on type-II superconductors Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN40,41 and associated to the formation of vortices in the electrodes, causing \u2206 to locally vanish thus softening the superconducting gap,41,42 and/or shifting spectral weight from the coherence peaks to energies within the gap.43 We note, that for B = 210 mT the average vortex separation \u221a 4\u03c6/3B reaches the NW diameter44 and thus \u2206 = 0 vortex cores will be found proximal to the nanowire tunnel probe, softening the local density of states measurement.\nFigure 3e,f,g show measurements similar to Fig. 3a,c,h except measured as a function of temperature and for Vg = 2.38 V (green arrow in Fig. 2a). The coherence peaks weaken with temperature and the in-gap conductance increases markedly from \u223c 1 K and reaches GN at \u223c 10 K (see Supporting Information Fig. S5) consistent with TC of the bulk MoRe film. Assuming \u2206\u2217 is temperature independent at T TCbulk the zero bias conductance was fitted to\nthe conventional expression for the N-S tunnelling45 GS|VSD=0 = GN \u221a 2\u03c0\u2206\u2217/(kBT ) exp (\u2212\u2206\u2217/kBT ). The solid red (dashed orange) line in Fig. 3g shows extrapolation of a fit performed up to 1.5 K (3 K), yielding \u2206\u2217 = 0.52 meV (0.62 meV). The dependence on fitting range, relatively poor fit at low T (see Supporting Information for data plotted on a linear scale), and low values of \u2206\u2217 compared to those obtained from bias spectroscopy, suggests this fit may be affected by additional contributions to the conductance in addition to thermal excitation above \u2206\u2217, likely mediated by a high density of sub-gap states due to the non-ideal MoRe /InAs interface as discussed in connection with Fig. 2.24 Future experiments involving high-purity interfaces6\u20138,24,33 may solve this issue.\nTransport in S-NW-S Josephson devices where both electrodes are made from MoRe is governed by different phenomena than in S-NW-N devices: Dissipation-less supercurrents carried by Andreev bounds states dominate at zero bias, while multiple Andreev reflections dominate at finite bias. Figure 4a shows the differential resistance dV/dI of S-NW-S device 4 as a function of Vg and the current I through the device in a regime far from pinch-off (GN & 2 e2/h).

A zero-resistance state is observed at low currents with a switching current Isw (white line) which decreases upon reducing Vg due to the depletion of the NW. In addition, Isw exhibits modulations with Vg due to conductance fluctuations in the coherent InAs NW46. In Fig. 4a, the current was swept from negative to positive and the minimal switching/retrapping hysteresis indicates overdamped junction dynamics and/or Joule heating.45 A maximal IC = 23 nA was found at Vg = 20 V with a product ICRN = 0.1mV \u03c0\u2206/(2e) = 2.2 mV. The critical currents of nanowire JJs have been widely investigated and similar to the present findings, ICRN is commonly found to considerably underestimate \u2206. A complete description of the underlying cause(s) is lack-\ning, however disorder and/or inhomogeneity of materials and interfaces are likely an important factor46,47.\nFigure 4b shows the dV/dI vs. B\u22a5 at Vg = 20 V. The switching current Isw decreases monotonically as expected from diffusive transport in narrow, long nanowire junctions where flux pick-up in the junction is suppressed.48,49 For a diffusive junction the decay is expected to follow the relation Isw(B\u22a5) =\nI0sw exp [ \u2212 0.1456 ( \u03c0dNWLB\u22a5\n\u03c60\n)2] ,48 with flux quantum\n\u03c60 = h/2e and I0sw = Isw(B\u22a5 = 0). The dashed line in Fig. 4c shows a fit to the measured Isw with a fixed NW diameter dNW = 115 nm determined from SEM images of Dev. 4 and taking the length of the NW junction, L, as a free parameter. The fitted L \u223c 240 nm is larger than the contact separation \u223c 175 nm as previously observed for devices with a substantial semiconductor/superconductor overlap.50 This supports that the reduction of the measured induced gap, \u2206\u2217, in the SNW-N may be influenced by a decay from the electrode to the QD position as discussed above. The temperature dependence of Isw in Fig. 4c exhibits a decay typical for a diffusive junction and similar to the observed Isw suppression below BbulkC , complete suppression of Isw occurs for T \u2248 3 K < TC around the same temperature where \u2206\u2217(T ) vanishes \u2013 cf. Fig. 3e,f.\nFinally, we show in Fig. 4d,e bias spectroscopy in a regime close to pinch off Vg . 0 V where the device is dominated by a quantum dot in Coulomb blockade analogous to Fig. 2. For Vg and Vsd inside Coulomb blockade, sequential transport is suppressed, and the current is mediated by co-tunneling. As typical for this situation, the conductance exhibits gate independent structure at finite bias eVsd = \u00b12\u2206\u2217/n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . due to the successive opening and closing of the allowed multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) processes. Since the MAR processes in Coulomb blockade regime occur across a randomly located quantum dot, the superconducting leads consist of the proximitized NW segments either side of the dot;51 thus analysis of the MAR allows an alternative method for determining \u2206\u2217.46,52,53 Figure 4e shows the extracted G(Vsd) averaged over the Vg-range indicated by a white arrow in Fig. 4d. A series of peaks are observed following the expected harmonic series with the indicated MAR order n. The inset shows the extracted peak positions as a function of 1/n and a linear fit gives \u2206\u2217 = 1.1 meV. This value is consistent with that obtained from N-NW-S tunnel spectroscopy given the observed sample to sample variation and close to the value obtained for MoRe/graphene devices.18,20 Continuous tunability between the \u2018open\u2019 and Coulomb blockade regimes was seen in all devices (Supporting Figs. S2,S3).\nTo summarize, we have investigated the sputtered alloy molybdenum-rhenium Mo0.5Re0.5 as a superconducting contact material to InAs nanowires. Both MoRe-NWN tunnel spectroscopy devices and MoRe-NW-MoRe Josephson devices were successfully fabricated and electrically characterized at cryogenic temperatures. The\n6 MoRe electrode films have a transition temperature of 9\u221210 K corresponding to a superconducting gap \u2206bulk = 1.4 meV, and the critical field exceeds 6 T. S-NW-N tunnel spectroscopy and analysis of the sub-gap structure in the conductance of S-NW-S devices shows an induced superconducting gap in the NW of \u223c 0.5\u22121.1 meV. This is lower than \u2206bulk which we associate with disordered MoRe/NW interfaces or effects of a diffusive junction. Applying a magnetic field, we find that features associated with induced superconductivity are visible even for high perpendicular fields B\u22a5 > 2 T, however, the subgap conductance of the tunnel devices increases and the critical current of JJ devices decreases rapidly already within 500 mT. This finding is similar to previous studies of type-II superconductor/semiconductor hybrid devices. Although the nanowire exhibits a soft, \u2018V\u2019-shaped gap, we expect that the hardness could be improved by careful cleaning of the semiconductor interface,33 or by in-situ deposition after nanowire growth.23 MoRe thus appears a promising candidate to extend semiconductor/superconductor hybrids towards higher TC operation, and potentially extended magnetic field ranges, if the role of vortices can be elucidated through, e.g., STM studies. In particular, we expect device performance to improve further if shadow epitaxy techniques6,7,32,33,47,54 can be applied to the sputter deposited films. In the short term, our results suggest MoRe as an alternative to Nb or NbTiN, offering simple processing, with superconducting properties less sensitive to oxide formation, and larger residual resistance ratios for RF applications.
