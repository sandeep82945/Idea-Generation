Out of the 7279 \u03b2-lactamases reported so far, 38 are NDM-1 and 74 are VIM-2 variants,13 with further \u03b2-lactamases being continuously identified.14\nBesides the design of novel \u03b2-lactams reluctant to hydrolysis by metallo-\u03b2-lactamases, the development of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors is the most promising strategy to counteract metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-based antibiotic resistance.15 These inhibitors, when combined with antibiotics and formulated into a single product, may prolong the usefulness of existing \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.

They possess different structures, active sites and catalytic mechanisms. Consequently, serine-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are inactive against metallo-\u03b2-lactamases, except for the recently developed taniborbactam.18 Captopril derivatives, thiorphan, tiopronin, 2,3-dimercaprol, ML302F, L-CS319, 2-(4- fluorobenzoyl)benzoic acid, 3-formylchromone, cyclic boronates and ANT-2681 are examples of compounds that act by ligand replacement, whereas SIT-Z5 and aspergillomarasmine A19 act by metal sequestration. These are both Zn-dependent strategies.20,21 Schofield's isoquinolines (IC50 10\u20131000 \u03bcM)\n22 are the most successful Zn-independent inhibitors. Most inhibitors discovered so far have IC50s in the \u03bcM range, although a few compounds with nM potency have also been reported.23 The field has been extensively reviewed.24\u201327 Importantly, no clinically applicable metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are available to date, and merely two candidates have yet been reported to have reached clinical trials.8 Consequently, the development of new classes of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors that provide protection to some of our clinically most precious antibiotics is expected to be one of the possibly most valuable contributions to combating antibiotic resistance.28"

The active site of NDM-1 and of VIM-2 are structurally similar (Fig. 2, and section S3 of ESI\u2020), and involve the same amino acid residues to facilitate zinc coordination. In addition, both enzymes use flexible loops to allow for adjustment of the active site to enable the binding of a wide range of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.\nIn our design of novel inhibitors, we introduced a phosphonic acid and a piperidine ring as key binding motives (Scheme 1). Phosphonic acid derivatives30 and\nphosphonamidates31 have previously been studied in the context of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibition. The phosphonate group was incorporated to mimic the amide carbonyl of \u03b2-lactams and is expected to coordinate the zinc ions of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases.32,33 The piperidine possibly interacts with the catalytic site of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases. Initially, phospholactams (I) showed low stability in aqueous solutions in preliminary experiments,34 so we turned to their chemically stable analogues II, as their tetrahedral phosphonate motif resembles the tetrahedral transition state of hydrolysed \u03b2-lactams (Scheme 1). The phosphonic acid core is thus expected to interact within the active site, by strongly coordinating the zinc ions with its oxygens, analogous to that reported for structurally related phosphonate-based metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (see for example pdb: 5HH6).32,35\nWe further introduced thiophene moieties with variation in their regioisomeric pattern, steric bulk and flexibility (Scheme 2) as sulfur substitution is common in several classes of \u03b2-lactams (penams, penems, cephems, etc.).

These sidechains vary in hydrophobicity, which we deemed worth exploring. In SAR studies of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, the properties of aromatic moieties were found important as they contribute to crucial \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions.37 The structural variation of the aromatic moiety in the present series is also expected to affect the solubility of the compounds."

Next, the benzyl protecting group of 2 was hydrogenated under mild conditions using Pearlman's catalyst,39 Pd(OH)2/C and H2 under atmospheric pressure, yielding 3. Subsequently, a variety of amides 4a\u2013l were generated from this\nintermediate with a range of carboxylic acids (Scheme 3). Out of the variety of coupling reagents and solvents examined, HATU in combination with dry EtOAc as solvent provided the highest yields.40 The diastereomers of 4a\u2013l were separated using preparative HPLC, and one set of enantiomeric pairs was crystalized to identify the relative configuration of the intermediates by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (section 5, ESI\u2020). The phosphonic ester was then hydrolyzed with McKenna's method using TMSBr, resulting in simultaneous Boc-deprotection of 4a\u2013l. However, it was observed that ethyl bromide liberated as a side product led to unwanted N-alkylation of the target compounds 5a\u2013l. This could be avoided by the addition of Et3N in combination with 3-mercaptopropyl functionalized silica gel to the reaction mixture. To enhance the aqueous solubility, the final products were converted to their hydrochloric salts (5a\u2013l). In our hands, the compounds were chemically stable in solution for a prolonged time (weeks to months, Fig. S187\u2013S192, ESI\u2020)."

Each data point was measured in triplicates. Almost all compounds showed metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitory activities with 5g-2 being the most active (IC50 = 4.1 \u03bcM, VIM-2). A larger number of compounds inhibited VIM-2 than NDM-1 or GIM-1, and those with RR/SS configuration typically inhibited VIM-2 at lower concentrations. Our observation that a larger number of compounds inhibited VIM-2 than NDM-1 may be unexpected as both enzymes belong to the B1-subclass of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases. This is in line with previous reports.42,43 In general, the more rigid compounds showed higher affinity (compare 5b to 5j, for instance). Accordingly, upon introduction of a flexible methylene group, inhibitors with a 3-thiophene ring showed a 10-fold reduction of activity, whilst 2-thiophene substituted ones showed up to 45-fold decreased activity.

Titrations with concentrated ligand samples were preferred to minimize dilution-induced chemical shift changes. Titrations were carried out with NDM-1 and VIM-2 due to their high clinical relevance.\nThroughout the titrations of NDM-1 with selected inhibitors (Table 2), Phe70, Asp124, and Lys211 surrounding the suggested \u03b2-lactam binding site showed significant chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 4 and S164\u2013S168, ESI\u2020). We also observed large chemical shift perturbations for Ser191, which has previously been reported to take part in substrate\nbinding (numbered as Ser198).44,50 The observed spectral changes are characteristic for binding whereas not compatible with zinc(II)-depletion of the enzyme.44,51 Some amino acid residues in the C-terminal increased in intensity with increasing concentration of the added inhibitor, suggesting binding-induced alteration corresponding to the rate of the conformational dynamics of this enzyme.52\nWe observed significant chemical shift perturbations for Tyr65, His177, Tyr199, Arg203, Ser205, and His238 of VIM-2, in the expected binding site (Fig. 5 and S169\u2013S174, section S7, ESI\u2020), and for a few additional amino acid residues at the Nterminal, the latter presumably due to binding induced conformational change of the enzyme. The line broadening was observed for Tyr65, Gly69, Thr83, His177, Tyr199, Ser202, Ser205, Ala206, His238, and Gly239 throughout at least one of the titrations, indicating the presence of a process with intermediate rate exchange, possibly related to the binding of the inhibitor and/or a binding induced conformational change.\nComparable chemical shift perturbations were observed for NDM-1 upon titrations with 5i-1, 5b-1, 5c-1 and 5j-1 to that observed for 5i-2 (R2 \u223c 0.81\u20130.84, Fig. 6), a compound that inhibits both NDM-1 and VIM-2, and revealed that the \u03b1-amino-phosphonate inhibitors bind to the same binding cleft and have comparable binding modes. Due to the structural differences leading to certain amino acid residues being involved in the binding of one but not of another inhibitor, the chemical shift perturbations are not expected to show perfect correlation. However, a reasonable correlation reveals the involvement of certain amino acid residues in the binding of all inhibitors studied herein.

Factors such as tautomerisation, metal binding, and the presence or absence of salts were also taken into account. To avoid bias or forced positions, docking was performed up to 40 times for each generated state for each ligand without experimental restraints. The resulting docking modes were evaluated in comparison to the experimentally observed 1H,15N NMR chemical shift perturbations (see the ESI\u2020) and those compatible with the experimental data were kept. Next, they were ranked according to their binding free energies (\u0394G) obtained by MM-GBSA rescoring, and the most feasible binding pose was selected. The stronger binding of the RS as compared to the SR, and of the RR as compared to\nthe SS diastereomers of the studied inhibitors to both VIM-2 and NDM-1 (Tables S8 and S9, ESI\u2020) was observed, as a general trend. This suggests that these stereoisomers (RS, RR) are primarily responsible for the enzyme inhibitory activities are shown in Table 1. The superposition of the binding modes (Fig. 4, VIM-2, and Fig. 5, NDM-1, pdb coordinates are provided as ESI\u2020) indicates that the \u03b1-aminophosphonatetype inhibitors coordinate Zn1 of both NDM-1 (Fig. 9) and VIM-2 (Fig. 10) via an oxygen of the phosphonic acid. This computational observation is corroborated by the line broadening of the 1H,15N HSQC signal of His177 that directly coordinates Zn-1, and is in agreement with our design (inhibition by a tetrahedral phosphonate). Moreover, another oxygen of the phosphonic acid forms a hydrogen bond with Asn220 of NDM-1 or a salt bridge to Arg203 of VIM-2. The piperidine nitrogen of the inhibitors is involved in a \u03c0\u2013cation interaction53,54 with Phe70 of NDM-1 or Tyr65 in case of VIM2, whereas the thiophene ring of the inhibitors is oriented towards loop 10 of the enzyme. The binding poses of the inhibitors are similar, as revealed by the average RMSD55 of 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00c5 for NDM-1, and 2.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u00c5 for VIM-2 binding (Fig. 4 and 5). The latter similarity is expected for structurally related inhibitors, and is supported by the good correlation of the NMR chemical shift perturbations observed for the same protein upon titration with different \u03b1-aminophosphonates (Fig. 6 and 7). Overall, the energetically preferred binding modes (Fig. 9 and 10) are in good agreement with the NMR chemical shift perturbations.\nPemberton et al.32 have shown that the binding pose of phosphonate-bearing coumarin inhibitors of NDM-1 may be pH dependent. At pH 7.5, the active site hydroxide is retained, and the phosphonate group interacts with this hydroxide and Zn2, rather than with both Zn(II) ions as at lower pH. The NMR titrations reported herein were performed at pH 7, however, based on the 15N NMR chemical shift perturbation data the possibility that 5a\u2013l could bind via a bridging hydroxide ion cannot be excluded. The binding poses of phosphonates presented herein and of the coumarin phosphonate derivatives of Pemberton, an example being depicted in Fig. 11, show noticeable similarities.\nComparing our data, we note that the ligand-induced chemical shift perturbation observed upon titration with 5a\u2013l showed a wider spread of chemical shift changes for VIM-2 (Fig. 6) as compared to NDM-1 (Fig. 7), and that the binding modes of the inhibitors to VIM-2 are being slightly more dissimilar (Fig. 4) as compared to those of NDM-1 (Fig. 5). This may indicate somewhat higher flexibility of VIM-2 as compared to NDM-1, which may allow it to offer a larger degree of substrate promiscuity. This is corroborated by the observation of a larger number of \u03b1-aminophosphonate inhibitors showing activity against VIM-2 than NDM-1 in this study."

These compounds were designed to enhance the activity of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as meropenem. Being the first members of a new type of inhibitors, they showed moderate to low inhibitory potency and are obviously not directly applicable in the clinical treatment of NDM-1 and VIM-2 expressing bacterial strains. As none of the\nenantiomers of 5a\u2013l can be expected to have nM activity, it was not worth to separate or selectively generate their isomers. The development of stereoselective synthetic routes to \u03b1-aminophosphonates will therefore be the task for upcoming studies at the identification of more active members of this structural group. This may be achieved, for instance, by the structural modifications of the piperidine moiety of 5a\u2013l. Hence, whereas these compounds aren't clinically applicable, their future structural modifications may yield compounds applicable for the treatment of NDM-1 and VIM-2 expressing bacterial strains. The inhibitor binding sites were indicated by 1H/15N NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments, evaluating the data of selected compounds in the series. Comparable magnitudes of chemical shift perturbation on the same amino acid residues upon titration with differently substituted inhibitors indicated that the \u03b1-aminophosphonic acid derivatives have a common binding site on both enzymes. Computational docking revealed that the RS and RR stereoisomers of the synthesized inhibitors are primarily responsible for NDM-1 and VIM-2 binding (Kd = 0.4\u20133.1 mM). A stronger correlation of the inhibitor induced chemical shift perturbations on NDM-1 as compared to that observed for VIM-2 may indicate a lower substrate specificity of VIM-2. This was corroborated by the observation of VIM-2 binding a larger number of phosphonates with more different binding poses, as\nFig. 9 The interactions of (RS)-5c-1 with the active site of NDM-1 (pdb: 6NY7), as determined by computational docking directed by NMR (ligand induced protein chemical shift perturbation).

The crystal structures of VIM-2 (pdb 6O5T) and NDM-1 (pdb 6NY7) were prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard;60 involving Prime52 to fill in missing side chains and loops, Epik61,62 to generate heteroatom states (pH 7.0 \u00b1 2.0), PropKa (pH 7) to optimize the hydrogen bond network (sampling of water orientations when appropriate), and the OPLS3e force field63 in the restrained minimization (hydrogens only). The Receptor Grid Generation module in Glide64\u201366 was used to define the active site by creating a rectangular box centered on the native ligand (crystal structure) and extending in all directions to encompass ligands of similar size (i.e. 16.5 \u00c5) or ligands <22 \u00c5. Grids with no water molecules in the active site were generated and validated. The ligands were converted to 3D all atom structures using LigPrep. Epik was used to generate possible ionization states at target pH 7 \u00b1 2, including metal binding states. Tautomers were selected to be generated. The molecular docking was performed using Glide. The inhibitors were docked using the flexible docking mode, with sampling of nitrogen inversions and ring conformations, and with extra precision (XP) rescoring. Biased sampling of torsions was selected for amides by penalizing non-planar conformations. Epik state penalties was selected to be added to the docking score. A maximum of 40 poses were selected to be generated for each ligand. Post-docking minimization was used, and per-residue interaction scores were written for residues within 10 \u00c5 from the grid center. Prime MM-GBSA rescoring of docking poses (VSGB 2.0 solvation model and OPLS3e force field) were performed providing poses ranked based on free energy of binding (\u0394Gbind in kcal mol\n\u22121). For these calculations, flexibility was allowed for residues within 10 \u00c5 from the ligands, and minimization was selected as sampling method. Structural interaction fingerprints (SIFts) in Canvas was used for representation and analysis of the docking poses. Side chain, zinc ion, and hydrogen bonding interactions were used to generate the SIFts. The similarity between the SIFts were evaluated using the Tanimoto similarity metric, and clustering was performed using the Flexible Beta linkage method. Epik (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2020) was used for empirical predictions of aqueous pKa values.\nDose rate inhibition studies for IC50 determination\nThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against the NDM-1, VIM-2 and GIM-1 enzymes were determined by using\ntwelve different concentration of inhibitor compounds ranging from 0 \u03bcM to 800 \u03bcM. A 100 \u03bcl solution with buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 \u03bcM ZnCl2, 2.5% DMSO), purified enzyme (0.1 nM VIM-2, 10 nM NDM-1 or 1 nM GIM1) and 800\u20130 \u03bcM inhibitor was incubated in a 96 well plate at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min. In addition, the enzyme buffer contained 400 \u03bcg ml\u22121 bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prevent protein unfolding and loss of activity due to low concentrations.67,68 100 \u03bcM of the reporter substrate nitrocefin (VIM-2, GIM-1) or imipenem (NDM-1) was added to the enzyme\u2013inhibitor solution and the increase in absorbance at 482 nm (nitrocefin) or 300 nm (imipenem) was recorded on a Spectramax M4 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Each data point was performed in triplicates and the initial velocity for each inhibitor concentration was analyzed by a log [inhibitor] vs. response curve fitting to calculate IC50 in GraphPad Prism 9.2 software."
