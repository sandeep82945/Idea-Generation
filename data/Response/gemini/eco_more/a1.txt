1. **Investigate the approximation ratio of strategyproof mechanisms for the facility location problem with scaling functions under different assumptions on the scaling function.** For example, what is the approximation ratio of the median mechanism when the scaling function is a piecewise linear function with a bounded number of line segments?
2. **Design strategyproof mechanisms for the facility location problem with scaling functions that are not single-peaked.** This could be done by relaxing the assumption that the scaling function is continuous or by considering more general classes of preferences.
3. **Extend the results of this paper to the multi-dimensional facility location problem.** This would involve considering scaling functions that depend on multiple dimensions of the facility location.
4. **Apply the concept of scaling functions to other facility location problems, such as capacitated facilities and obnoxious facility location.** This could lead to new insights into the design of strategyproof mechanisms for these problems.
5. **Investigate the computational complexity of finding the optimal facility location for different classes of scaling functions.** This could help to identify efficient algorithms for solving the facility location problem with scaling functions.
