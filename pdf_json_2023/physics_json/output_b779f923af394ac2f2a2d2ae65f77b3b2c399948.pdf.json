    "abstractText": "The characterization and dynamics of protein structures upon adsorption at the air/water interface are important for understanding the mechanism of the foamability of proteins. Hydrogen\u2013 deuterium exchange, coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), is an advantageous technique for providing conformational information for proteins. In this work, an air/water interface, HDX-MS, for the adsorbed proteins at the interface was developed. The model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) was deuterium-labeled at the air/water interface in situ for different predetermined times (10 min and 4 h), and then the resulting mass shifts were analyzed by MS. The results indicated that peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366 of BSA might be involved in the adsorption to the air/water interface. Moreover, the residues L55, H63, R232, A233, L234, K235, A236, R359, and V366 of these peptides might interact with the air/water interface through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Meanwhile, the results showed that conformational changes of peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366 could lead to structural changes in their surrounding peptides, 204\u2013208 and 349\u2013354, which could cause the reduction of the content of helical structures in the rearrangement process of interfacial proteins. Therefore, our air/water interface HDX-MS method could provide new and meaningful insights into the spatial conformational changes of proteins at the air/water interface, which could help us to further understand the mechanism of protein foaming properties.",

            "text": "Proteins are amphiphilic biopolymers that can quickly adsorb to the air/water interface, reduce surface tension, and further stabilize foam-based food systems [1]. The solubility, hydrophobicity, flexibility, and charge of protein molecules are the major factors impacting the interfacial adsorption process [2\u20134]. The interfacial adsorption of proteins includes two basic steps: (i) the protein molecules move rapidly to the air/water interface and their attachment; (ii) the polymer chains uncoil and rearrange (surface denaturation) [5]. Previous research has demonstrated that proteins adsorb to the air/water interface by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions [6]. Therefore, hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid residues are the potential sites interacting with the interface. After the adsorption of proteins at the interface, changes are achieved not only quantitatively but also conformationally [7,8]. The degree of conformational changes of proteins at the air/water interface strongly affects the rheological properties of the interfacial films formed by proteins [9,10]. The\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12081601 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601 2 of 15\ndegree of conformational changes of globulins is low, and the viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films is high. On the contrary, flexible proteins exhibit more conformational changes at the air/water interface, resulting in a lower viscoelastic modulus of the interfacial films [11\u201313]. The rheological properties of interfacial films further influence the properties of foams stabilized by proteins [6]. The higher viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films contributes to higher foam stability [14,15]. Thus, it is of great significance to study the conformational changes of proteins at the air/water interface, which is beneficial to further understand the properties of macroscopic foams and develop foam-based food systems. The conformational changes of flexible and structured proteins at the air/water interface are different. The typical flexible protein, \u03b2-casein, presented a conformation of a random coil in solution and transformed to a \u03b2-sheet structure after adsorbing to the air/water interface via in situ circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy [16] and infrared reflection\u2013absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) [17]. However, changes in the secondary structure of structured proteins were often accompanied by an increase in random coils or \u03b2-sheets, and a decrease in \u03b1-helices [18]. For example, bovine serum albumin (BSA), the typical structured globular protein, missed its helical structure and transformed into a random coil at the air/water interface studied by in situ CD spectroscopy [16]. Lysozyme, another structured protein, was an \u03b1+\u03b2-type protein in the solution. It transformed its \u03b1-helix into a \u03b2-sheet upon adsorption to the air/water interface, as revealed by external reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ER-FTIR) spectroscopy [19]. However, these spectral results can only reflect the conformational transitions of proteins adsorbed to the interface at the secondary structure level. The information on the influence of the interface on the protein structure at the peptide level and their interaction sites is still unclear. Thus, an accurate and effective method to determine the structural changes of proteins at the air/water interface in situ at the peptide and amino acid residue level is urgently needed. Hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a promising technique to monitor conformational changes of proteins. It is capable of overcoming the disadvantage of the techniques above. Its principle is that amide hydrogens of the protein backbone exchange with deuterium atoms in the surrounding solvent over defined periods of time. Since the mass of deuterium is roughly double the mass of hydrogen, the resulting mass shifts can be determined by MS to monitor the rate of HDX, which can provide information on the solvent accessibility of the protein, and further information on the protein structure [20\u201322]. Hydrogens on the surface of the protein that are more exposed to D2O demonstrate a faster HDX rate than those located inside or involved in hydrogen bonding [23,24]. As the conformation of proteins influences the rate of HDX in proteins, monitoring the deuteration level of proteins over time can reveal the characteristics of protein conformation and conformational changes under the influence of a variety of factors: protein interactions, ligands, surface denaturation, etc. [25]. Compared to the spectral methods, CD and FTIR, which can only reflect structural changes of proteins at the secondary structure level, HDX-MS can provide a resolution of the conformational changes of proteins at the peptide and amino acid residue level. Proteins can interact with proteins, ligands, and membranes, resulting in a decreased HDX rate on interaction sites. Thus, we can monitor the HDX rate to identify the interaction sites. The HDX-MS analysis of IL-23R with its cognate cytokine IL-23 indicated that, compared to the HDX rate without IL-23, two peptides (residues 24\u201342 and 88\u2013113) located in the N-terminal showed a lower HDX rate. Therefore, residues 24\u201342 and 88\u2013113 of IL-23R might be the main sites between IL-23R and IL-23 interaction [26]. After the binding of AMP to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the conformational changes of AMPK mainly happened to the \u03b3-subunit [27]. In order to analyze conformational information for membrane-associated HIV-1 Nef protein, a novel type of HDX-MS utilization was developed, combined with Langmuir monolayers [28]. However, the HDX-MS study of BSA was limited. The researchers used HDX-MS to study conformational changes of ultrasonicated BSA, and the structural unfolding of BSA after ultrasonication was\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601 3 of 15\nrevealed [29]. Here, we applied HDX-MS for food research to explore conformational changes and interaction sites of BSA upon adsorption to the air/water interface. In this article, BSA was used as the model protein to develop an HDX-MS method to monitor the conformational transitions of proteins at the air/water interface in situ. Furthermore, we combined information about protein structural changes with its interfacial adsorption properties to clarify the molecular mechanism of protein foaming properties, establishing the relationship between the structure and foaming function of proteins. We hope our work provides theoretical support for the development of foam-based food products that are stabilized by proteins."

A microsyringe was used to carry out the procedure of depositing the protein layer at the air/water interface. The protein layer was considered to reach dynamic equilibrium after 10 min [34]. Following that, a peristaltic pump was used to circulate 48 mL of subphase buffer and 12 mL of D2O through the trough, which took 5 min and did not disturb the adsorbed proteins at the air/water interface. The adsorbed proteins were labeled for predetermined times\u20140 s, 10 min, and 4 h\u2014identical to the solution hydrogen\u2013 deuterium exchange experiments.

The flow rate used was 300 nL/min. Using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), a data-dependent MS/MS analysis was carried out. A distal 2.5-kV spray voltage was used to electrospray the eluted peptides from the LC column straight into the mass spectrometer. A cycle of one full scan of the MS spectrum (m/z 300\u20131800) was obtained. Then, the top 20 MS/MS events were created on the first to the twentieth most intense ions chosen from the full MS spectrum at a 30% normalized collision energy. With an automated gain control (AGC) target of 3 \u00d7 106, the full scan resolution was set at 70,000. With an isolation window of 1.8 m/z and an AGC target of 1 \u00d7 105, the MS/MS scan resolution was set at 17,500. For both the MS and MS/MS scans, there was one microscan, and the maximum ion injection times were 50 and 100 ms, respectively. The parameters for the dynamic exclusion were as follows: exclusion time, 30 s; exclude isotopes, on; and charge exclusion, 1 and >8. The Xcalibur data system (Thermo Scientific) managed the LC solvent gradients and MS scan operations. Using the HDExaminer software (Version 3.3, Sierra Analytics), the deuterium incorporation (# Deut, Da) and deuteration percentage (% Deut, %) of each tested peptide at various exchange time points were computed, both of which represented the deuteration level. The deuterium incorporation was the number of deuterons corresponding to the difference between the deuterated and undeuterated centroids, while the deuteration percentage was the ratio of the deuterium incorporation to the theoretical maximum deuteration (Max D). The deuterium incorporation (# Deut, Da) and deuteration percentage (% Deut, %) for each peptide were calculated by Equations (5) and (6), respectively.\n# Deut = (Dcentroid \u2212 UDcentroid)\u00d7 z (5)\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601 6 of 15\n% Deut = # Deut Max D\n(6)\nwhere # Deut represents the deuterium incorporation (Da), Dcentroid represents the deuterated centroids, UDcentroid represents the undeuterated centroids, z is the constant coefficient, % Deut is the deuteration percentage (%), and Max D represents the theoretical maximum deuteration (Da) for each peptide.

Although any concentration of D2O could be used for HDX experiments, higher concentrations are often used to obtain a higher deuteration level [39].

Thus, in this study, we adopted BSA as the model protein to analyze protein structural alterations upon adsorption to the air/water interface by HDX-MS.\nOur results from the HDX-MS analysis show that, in total, 36 digested peptides of the BSA were detected, leading to a 67.1% sequence coverage (Figure 4). In Figure 4A, the results of the 10 min labeling time showed that the degree of deuterium incorporation for most peptides of the BSA was quite low, both in the solution and at the air/water interface. This was because the rates of deuterium incorporation depended on the stability of the protein structures [25]. The flexible proteins fundamentally tended to show fast deuterium incorporation rates, contributing to a larger mass shift in a shorter labeling time. However, for the typical globular protein, BSA, which contains 17 disulfide bonds and is relatively stable, there were extensive regions with a low deuterium incorporation rate. When the labeling time increased to 4 h (Figure 4B), the majority of BSA peptides showed increased deuterium incorporation. The deuterium incorporation of peptides 54\u2013 63, 97\u2013103, 165\u2013174, 227\u2013236, 229\u2013251, 355\u2013366, 361\u2013369, 370\u2013377, 561\u2013567, and 567\u2013574 in the solution labeling at 4 h showed a significant increase compared to the labeling at 10 min. The results indicated that these peptides were located on the surface of the BSA and more exposed to the solvent (D2O), which facilitated the adsorption of these peptides to the air/water interface, leading to a certain orientation of BSA at the air/water interface [6]. The peptides 54\u201363, 165\u2013174, and 355\u2013366 all contained random coil structures, proving the reliability of the HDX-MS results [25]. However, the deuterium incorporation of peptides 448\u2013456 and 519\u2013529 in the solution labeling at 4 h showed a large decrease compared to the labeling at 10 min, as a result of steric solvent shielding (caused by the random protein\u2013protein interaction) and conformational changes [41,42]. As shown in Figure 4, there were significant differences for some peptides in deuterium incorporation between the protein at the air/water interface and in the solution for the interface effect, such as peptides 37\u201343, 54\u201363, 97\u2013103, 165\u2013174, 178\u2013186, 204\u2013208, 227\u2013236,\nthe BSA were detected, leading to a 67.1% sequence coverage (Figure 4).

Meanwhile, the interfacial rheology of BSA was analyzed. After adsorbing to the interface, proteins can greatly lower the interfacial tension to stabilize foam systems. At pH 7.0, the BSA (5%, m/v) reduced the interfacial tension from 71.85 mNm\u22121 to 45.13 mNm\u22121 after two hours of adsorption. When the adsorption time reached 4000 s, the interfacial tension of the BSA was relatively stable, indicating that this stage was close to the dynamic adsor tion quilibrium. The results in Figure 5A show the curv of interfacial pressure (\u03c0) versus the square root of time (t1/2) for the BSA protein at 5% (m/v). Within 100 s,\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601 9 of 15\nthe diffusion-controlled fast adsorption process took place. To determine the diffusion rate (kdiff), the slope of the linear plot of the curve between 0 and 100 s was calculated [0.58 (0.98) mNm\u22121 s\u22120.5]. The high molecular weight of BSA (66 k Da) explains why the value was smaller than that of other proteins [40]. In Figure 5B, the typical plot of ln[(\u03c07200 \u2212 \u03c0t)/(\u03c07200 \u2212 \u03c00)] with the time of the BSA at 5% (m/v) is displayed. The penetration rate (kP) of the protein is represented by the slope of the first linear area (2000\u20136000 s), while its rearrangement rate (kR) is shown by the slope of the second linear region (6000\u20137200 s). The second linear area demonstrates that the BSA completed the structural uncoiling and rearrangement within 2 h. The values of kP and kR were 5.84 \u00d7 10\u22124 (0.98) s\u22121 and 18 \u00d7 10\u22124 (0.96) s\u22121, respectively, smaller than other flexible proteins, indicating that relatively less conformational rearrangement of the BSA occurred at the air/water interface [43,44].

However, the same peptide, 54\u201363, at the air/water interface showed low deuterium incorporation labeling at both 10 min and 4 h, indicating that the air/water interface offered protection from deuterium exchange. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of peptides 227\u2013236 and 355\u2013366. Compared to the BSA in the solution labeling at 4 h, peptide 227\u2013236 at the air/water interface showed a reduction >3.5 Da, and peptide 355\u2013366 demonstrated a decrease >6 Da in the deuterium incorporation (Figure 4B). Figure 6A,B displays the 3D structures of BSA mapped by the relative deuteration percentage labeling at 10 min and 4 h, respectively. From the spatial positions of peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366 in Figure 6C, it was observed that they were on a plane, where the protein interacted with the air/water interface. Thus, we deduced that peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366 were involved in the adsorption of the BSA to the interface, resulting in the certain orientation of the BSA at the air/water interface after 4 h labeling [45]. Our results are in agreement with the current theories: when proteins (especially structured globular proteins) adsorb to the air/water interface, most of the protein molecules remain in the aqueous phase, and only a small part mosaic on the air/water interface [46,47].\nFigure 5.

Thus, we deduced that peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366 were involved in the adsorption of the BSA to th interface, resulting in the certain orientation of the BSA at the air/water interface after 4 h labeling [45]. Our results are in agreement with the current theories: when proteins (especially structured globular proteins) adsorb to the air/water interface, most of the protein molecules remain in the aqueous phase, and only a small part mosaic on the air/water interface [46,47]. Previous res arch has shown the role of hydrophobic int raction. In that theory, the hydrophobic part of proteins extends to the air phase in the interfacial adsorption [6]. Hydrophobic amino acids (non-polar amino acids, containing Ala, Leu, Ile, Val, Pro, Trp, Phe, and Met) were favorable for protein adsorption to the interface. Moreover, Li et al. [45] examined cryo-electron microscopy information from frozen proteins using various detergents (anionic, cationic, nonionic, and zwitterionic detergents) and found that the electrostatic interaction between proteins and air/water interface carrying negative charges also had an influence on the protein adsorption to the interface. The peptides possessing positively charged amino acid residues (Lys, Arg, and His) were more likely to adsorb to the interface, leading to a preferred orientation of the protein at the interface. Therefore, peptides composed of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid residues are likely\nFoods 2023, 12, 1601 11 of 15\nto be involved in the protein adsorption to the air/water interface.

Therefore, peptides composed of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid residues are likely to be involved in the protein adsorption to the air/water interface. These interactions are supposed to affect the orientation of adsorbed proteins on air/water interfaces. To determine the residues involved in the interactions between the protein residues and the air/water interface, the relative deuteration percentage of each residue was calculated by subtracting the deuteration percentage of the BSA in the solution from that at the air/water interface. We assumed that the obvious decrease in the residue\u2019s relative deuteration percentage (<\u221290%) was caused by the interaction between the protein residues and the air/water interface. In our experiment, peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013 366 showed significant reductions in their relative deuteration percentage. The results in Figure 7 display the difference heatmap denoted by the relative deuteration percentage after labeling at 10 min and 4 h. In peptide 54\u201363, one positively charged amino acid residue, H63, was located at the end of the peptide. The relative deuteration percentage of L55 was <\u221290%, which was considered to be involved in the process of adsorption to the air/water interface. For peptide 227\u2013236, the hydrophobic amino acid residues (F229, A233, L234, and A236), and the positively charged amino acid residues (K228, R232, and K235) accounted for 70%. Moreover, the relative deuteration percentages of A233, L234, K235, and A236 were <-90% and the relative deuteration percentage of R232 was <\u221270%. Peptide 355\u2013366 had three hydrophobic amino acid residues (P362, A365, and V366) and three positively charged amino acid residues (R359, R360, and H361), playing a key role in the adsorption process. Furthermore, the relative deuteration percentage of R359 was <\u221270%, and the relative deuteration percentage of V366 was <\u221250%.

The hydrophobic amino acid residues and positively charged amino acid residues accounted for 78% among the amino acid residues, whose relative deuteration percentages were <\u221270% from peptides 54\u201363, 227\u2013236, and 355\u2013366, which was consistent with the theory that the protein interacts with the negatively charged air/wa er interface via hydrophobic and lectrostatic interactio s. When the fragments of BSA adsorbed to the air/water interface, the conformation and solvent accessibility of the surrounding peptides were also affected. In Figures 4B and 6C, peptide 204\u2013208, located in the vicinity of peptide 227\u2013236, displayed an increment of >3 Da in the deuterium incorporation on the interface at 4 h labeling.
