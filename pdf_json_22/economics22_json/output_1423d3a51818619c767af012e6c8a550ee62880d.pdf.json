    "abstractText": "This study used information theory and network theory to predict the fluctuations of currency values of the machine learning model. For experiments, we calculate the causal relationships between currencies using loarithmic return (log-return) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) values of gold price per troy ounce in 48 currencies over 25 years. To quantify the causal relationships, we used the concept of transfer entropy. After quantifying their information flow, we modeled and analyzed those nonlinear causal relationships as a network. The network analysis results confirmed that information flow-based nonlinear causal relationships differed from the commonly-known key currency order. Then, we classified currencies using hierarchical clustering methods based on the configured networks. We predicted fluctuations in currency values using machine learning algorithms based on network topology-based information. As a result, we show that using the data columns in the same communities based on statistically significant nonlinear causal relationships can improve most machinelearning-based fluctuations of currency values for various countries from the perspective of data efficiency.",

Issues regarding trade conflicts and own country first policy have\nB Woo Chang Kim wkim@kaist.ac.kr\nInsu Choi jl.cheivly@kaist.ac.kr\nWonje Yun wjy1993@kaist.ac.kr\n1 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, KAIST, Yuseong-gu Daehakro 291, Daejeon 34141, Republic of Korea\ntriggered movements to enhance the domestic economy at the cost of foreign countries. Furthermore, with the global economic recession after the outbreak of COVID-19, economically significant countries worldwide have competitively implemented currency issuance to stimulate the economy. Such situations have increased the downside risk of the exchange rates within the global economic system. Due to the exchange rates being a factor influencing global investment and the economy, it is essential to find proper methods to hedge possible risks. One of the most straightforward methods to hedge downside risk is to predict the future price or risk fluctuations of financial assets.\nIn finance, prediction is a significant field. In other words, finding a model for predicting the objects of financial markets is still a highly researched topic despite major challenges, such as bankruptcy (S\u00e9verin & Veganzones, 2021), credit risk (Belhadi et al., 2021), and even financial products\u2019 prices (Gupta et al., 2022; Jabeur et al., 2021). Especially predicting financial assets\u2019 prices is very complicated due to their nonlinear, dynamic, confusing, and unpredictable characteristics.\nHowever, among the various attempts to predict the financial time series, machine learning models have recently been most studied, given their ability to recognize complex patterns in various applications. Accordingly, many prior studies have used machine learning to predict economic indicators such as stock prices and exchange rates. For example, short-term exchange rate prediction has shown to be possible to some extent through machine learning techniques (Galeshchuk, 2016). In addition, forecasts through machine learning techniques have been argued to can be able to be more predictive compared to the Chaos model and the behavioral model (Lisi & Schiavo, 1999).\nBased on this trend, we attempted to present and verify the entropy information flow and network theory to help predict the long-term exchange rates of the change via fluctuations of currency values. Here, as will mention in Chapter 2 in more detail, the current value refers to the amount of money required for the same commodity. To analyze the relationship between currencies as an information flow of fluctuations of currency values illustrated as network theory is a method suggested in studies by Liu et al. (2010) and Cao et al. (2017). Both studies attempted to intuitively model the global currency relationship through network analysis by recognizing logarithmic returns (log-returns) and their downside risks as the flow of information. In other words, this study aims to model the global trend of exchange rates by viewing the causal relationship between currency values\u2019 logarithmic return and downside risk values between currencies as information flows between currencies and quantifying them through entropymeasures. In addition, themodeled network is visualized to present the global currency order viewed from the information theory perspective based on PageRank. Finally, based on the hierarchical clustering results, we used machine learning techniques to forecast currency value using downside risk fluctuations and long-term exchange rates.\nThe remaining part of this study consists as follows. Chapter 2 confirms the justification for using the transfer entropy intended to be used in this paper through research data description and exploratory data analysis, and Chapter 3 explains the research methodology. Chapter 4 describes the results of a significant causal relationship according to the effective transfer entropy calculated based on the research methodology and includes the schematic results. In addition, network analysis was conducted using the configured nonlinear causal networks based on their log-returns and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR). Then we generated information flow-based communities with their network topology. In Chapter 5, based on the analysis in Chapter 4, whether the results of the nonlinear causal network analysis in this paper can derive improved results in predicting the fluctuations of currency values were analyzed. Finally, Chapter 6 describes the discussions and conclusions."

            "text": "The data in this paper are based on each country\u2019s exchange rates against the US dollar. However, excluding the US dollar when performing a global currency network analysis would be futile. Thus, it was necessary to develop a unit encompassing the dollar, which has been used globally. Thus, this study converted all monetary units into the gold price per troy ounce. Gold is a globally recognized good and has been used as a global currency in the early days, making it the apt unit for our study. To this end, the currency value data were constructed by multiplying the dollar price of gold per troy ounce and the exchange rates of each currency in dollars, which means that the currency amount to buy a troy ounce amount of gold. We will call this currency amount as \u2018currency value\u2019 in this paper.\nThe source of the raw data in this paper is mainly the PACIFIC exchange rates Service, which is provided by Professor Werner Antweiler of the University of British Columbia in Canada (Antweiler, 2008). The above database provides exchange rates for 88 countries and three precious metals (gold, silver, and platinum) since 1971. This study extracted the exchange rate data from as many countries as possible from this database. Unfortunately, the available data decreased as the analysis time increased; thus, we compromised between periods and countries. As a result, the most suitable period and countries have been chosen to be from 1995 to 2020 in 48 countries.\nThe raw dataset also provides up-to-date exchange rates of countries integrated into the Eurozone. When included in the Eurozone, existing currencies are fixed their currencies to specific exchange rates and converted into euros. The current exchange rates were calculated by multiplying these fixed exchange rates by the current euro exchange rates. Among the raw dataset, a total of 0.3% were missing. We processed additional data from the central banks to complement the missing values. For Chile, Sri Lanka, and Kuwait, data were provided by the central bank, and for Brazil, the missing values were filled by the exchange rates data provided by the US Federal Reserve (Chile Banco Central, 2021; Central Bank of Kuwait, 2021; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2021; Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2021). The remaining missing values of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were supplemented through the ECOS database provided by the Bank of Korea (Korea Economic Statistics System, 2021). The remaining missing values were estimated using cubic spline interpolation.\nAs mentioned above, we used gold price data to create a global currency network. To create our datasets, data from the World Gold Council(WGC), which oversees the global gold industry, were used (World Gold Council, 2021). Through the data provided by the WGC, we obtained the dollar price of gold per troy ounce of gold from 1995 to 2020 for 48 countries. Within this dataset, Vietnam\u2019s gold price per troy ounce could be obtained, which was added to the analysis target of this study. The names and ISO 4217 code of 48 selected currencies are as follows: United States dollar(USD), Australian dollar(AUD), Austrian schilling(ATS), Belgian franc(BEF), Brazilian real(BRL), Pound sterling(GBP), Canadian dollar(CAD), Chilean peso(CLP), Chinese Yuan Renminbi(CNY), Danish krone(DKK), Dutch Gulden(NLG), Egyptian pound(EGP), European euro(EUR), Finnish markka (FIM), French franc(FRF), German mark(DEM), Greek drachma(GRD), Hong Kong dollar(HKD), Hungarian forint(HUF), Icelandic krona(ISK), Indian rupee(INR), Indonesian rupiah(IDR), Irish pound(IEP), Israeli new shekel(ILS), Italian lira(ITL), Japanese yen(JPY), Kuwaiti dinar(KWD), Malaysian ringgit(MYR), Mexican peso(MXN), New Zealand dollar(NZD),\nNorwegian krone(NOK), Philippine peso(PHP), Polish zloty(PLN), Portugese Escudo(PTE), Russian ruble(RUB), Saudi Arabian riyal(SAR), Singapore dollar(SGD), South African rand(ZAR), South Korean won(KRW), Spanish peseta(ESP), Sri Lankan rupee(LKR), Swedish krona(SEK), Swiss franc(CFH), New Taiwan dollar(TWD), Thai baht(THB), Turkish lira(TRY), UAE dirham(AED), and Vietnamese dong(VND)."

            "text": "Basedon the configureddata, this study attempted tomeasure the causal relationships between currency values and exchange risk. After measuring them, we used them to predict the fluctunation of currency values. To this end, this study used the concept of the Entropic Value-at-risk (EVaR) (Ahmadi-Javid, 2012; Bohdalov\u00e1, 2007). EVaR is a concept used to quantify downside risk in finance and probability optimization. At this time, EVaR results in an upper-bound value for Value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR). VaR and CVaR have commonly used risk measure indicators when measuring price-based risk by Chernoff inequality; therefore, this study used EVaR as a downside risk indicator for robustness. For a probability space ( , F, P), if the random variableX and LM+ is a Borel measurable function in X : \u2192 R and has an moment generating function Mx (z), the EVar of X \u2208 LM+ with the significance level 1 \u2212 \u03b1 is:\nEVaR1\u2212\u03b1(X) := in fz>0 { z\u22121ln Mx (z))\n\u03b1\n} (1)\nSome representative methods to calculate EVaR include the delta-normal method, Monte Carlo simulationmethod, and historical simulationmethod. In this paper, EVaRwas estimated using a historical simulation method. We used the historical simulation method because the historical simulation method does not assume changes in risk factors of a particular distribution compared to the other two methods. Furthermore, as a nonparametric method, the historical simulations method does not include estimating statistical parameters such as variance or covariance and avoids inevitable estimation errors.\nConsequently, we used the four primary datasets in this paper: 25 years\u2019 worth (1996\u2013 2020) of gold price and the rates of change of 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days of EVaR. Each dataset has 48 columns(countries) and 6,761 rows (days). In this paper, basic statistics were identified for the four datasets. Then the normality of the data was verified through the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Jacque-Bera test. Also, the autocorrelation for the rates of change in the time series data of 5, 10, and 20 business days was examined through the Ljung-Box test. In addition, time-series stationarity was confirmed through three tests: the Augmented Decky-Fuller test (ADF), Phillips-Perron test (PP), and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test (KPSS). Homoscedasticity was confirmed through theWhite test. The calculation results are given in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4.\nTables 1, 2, 3, 4 represents the number of columns in every four datasets (at least 0, up to 48) satisfying normality, autocorrelation, stationarity, and homoscedasticity under significance levels of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively. As seen in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, all dataset used in this paper does not satisfy the normality at the significance level of \u03b1 = 0.01. In addition, it can be confirmed that the ADF, PP, and KPSS tests satisfy stationarity at all three significance levels. On the other hand, no data column satisfied homoscedasticity and autocorrelation due to the difference between data.\nTa bl e 1\nSt at is tic al re su lts\nof lo gre tu rn s of\ncu rr en cy\nva lu e\nN or m al ity\nSt at io na ri ty\nH om\nos ke da st ic ity\n5d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 10 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 20 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn\n\u03b1 =\n0. 1\n0 48\n3 46\n46 46\n\u03b1 =\n0. 05\n0 48\n3 46\n46 46\n\u03b1 =\n0. 01\n0 48\n1 46\n46 46\nTa bl e 2\nSt at is tic al re su lts\nof 5- da y E V aR\nN or m al ity\nSt at io na ri ty\nH om\nos ke da st ic ity\n5d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 10 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 20 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn\n\u03b1 =\n0. 1\n0 48\n46 1\n1 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 05\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 01\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0\nTa bl e 3\nSt at is tic al re su lts\nof 10 -d ay\nE V aR\nN or m al ity\nSt at io na ri ty\nH om\nos ke da st ic ity\n5d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 10 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 20 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn\n\u03b1 =\n0. 1\n0 48\n46 1\n1 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 05\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 01\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0\nTa bl e 4\nSt at is tic al re su lts\nof 20 -d ay\nE V aR\nN or m al ity\nSt at io na ri ty\nH om\nos ke da st ic ity\n5d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 10 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn 20 d A ut oc or re la tio\nn\n\u03b1 =\n0. 1\n0 48\n46 1\n1 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 05\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0\n\u03b1 =\n0. 01\n0 48\n46 1\n0 0"

Granger causality is the most used indicator, which measures linear causal relationships. In calculating the Granger causality, properties such as normality, stationarity, and linearity must be assumed. However, as seen in the results of Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, the datasets do not satisfy normality at all, which follows the results of prior studies that the rates of change in financial data generally do not satisfy normality (Dimpfl & Peter, 2013; Galeshchuk, 2016; Granger, 1969). Therefore, this study used a transfer entropy-based nonlinear causal measure, which measures causal relationships based on information theory to overcome the problems (Schreiber, 2000; Sheikh & Qiao, 2009; Tsai, 2011). Information theory has the advantage of using the model regardless of the characteristic of the data, making it possible to measure nonlinear causal relationships. Since transfer entropy is an entropy-based causal indicator, the advantage of the information theory is also valid. In this paper, the effective transfer entropy, a form of transfer entropy that has removed the finitesize effect, was used (Dimpfl & Peter, 2013; Boba et al., 2015).\nTransfer entropy is a nonparametric measure for confirming the flow of information between two variables based on Shannon entropy. Transfer entropy quantifies the causal relationship in the system based on measuring the resolved uncertainty according to the flow of information and the magnitude of the causal relationship from the source to the target variable. Transfer entropy has been used in the financial sector to confirm the causal relationship between financial assets and financial markets in various studies (Marschinski & Kantz, 2002; Kwon & Yang, 2008; Dimpfl & Peter, 2013; Sensoy et al., 2014; Bekiros et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2017; Jang et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2020a, b; Choi & Kim, 2021). Based on the prior studies, this study chose transfer entropy to analyze exchange rates and exchange rates risk fluctuations. It is used as an indicator of causal relationships."

For example, networks can be divided into directional or directional networks depending on whether there is a direction. Also, if the network is weighted, it is called a weighted network, and if not, a binary network (Kwak, 2017).\nIn representing networks, graphs and matrices are used. The two methods each have advantages in mathematical processing and visual explanation (Kwak, 2017). Graph format is a way to visualize the network and intuitively show the shape of the network by assigning shape, color, size, label, and arrow to the nodes and links. Matrix format is a method of representing the properties of the network as a matrix, called an adjacency matrix. In the adjacent matrix X , the value xi j indicates the connection from the i th node to the j th node and its corresponding properties (Lee, 2013).\nSince this study quantified the causal relationship between log-returns and EVaR of gold price per ounce in currencies as transfer entropy, these information flows were expressed as a directed weighted network.

Measuring centrality can be primarily divided into degree centrality, betweenness centrality, harmonic centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. We focused on the eigenvector centrality of the constructed networks in this paper. Especially, PageRank is a centrality algorithm designed to measure the ranking of web pages in Google\u2019s search engine and is the most famous eigenvector centrality measure (Page et al., 1999). PageRank is a directed network analysis method that can measure each node\u2019s influence and current and future information flow.\nThe method to calculate the PageRank is as follows. For a network with N nodes, the network can be expressed in an adjacencymatrix A \u2208 RN\u00d7N . Through this adjacencymatrix, we can mathematically calculate the column vector r \u2208 RN that has the PageRank value of each node as its elements as in (6).\nr = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)(I \u2212 \u03b1AT D\u22121)\u221211 (6)\nIn (6), I \u2208 RN\u00d7N is the identity matrix, 1 \u2208 RN is the all-ones vector, and D \u2208 RN\u00d7N is a diagonal matrix with max(K iout , 1) as the i th element, where K i out denotes the number of edges from the i th node. \u03b1 is a damping coefficient ranging from 0 to 1, which in this paper, we have used the same value as in the original paper, 0.85 (Page et al., 1999). From (6), we can numerically calculate the PageRank value using the power method.\nIn this paper, PageRank was used as a criterion for determining whether the currency of each country has a characteristic of a key currency. This interpretation can be applied because we constructed networks based only on the currency values\u2019 causal relationships. Therefore, a more considerable PageRank value of a currency would imply a stronger node\u2019s centrality. Thus, we concluded that such currency would strongly influence the network, which can be translated as the key currency from the perspective of log-returns and downside risks."

Among the clustering techniques in network analysis, we have used hierarchical clustering, generating communities by gradually combining the most similar communities.\nFor hierarchical clustering, the similarity between communities must be measured first. A primary method of measuring similarity is measuring the distance between communities. A path length is denoted as the number of connections within the path. Also, the distance between the nodes is defined as the shortest path among the various paths between those nodes.\nWith the node distances calculated, a proximity matrix is derived with the node distances as an element, and the clustering algorithm is executed on the proximity matrix. Methods of clustering algorithms include single connection, full connection, average connection, and word connection, where each algorithm differs in determining which nodes to cluster.\nThis study assumed that the clustering process results in a highly relevant community in the information flow-based network of log-returns and downside risks of currency values. Thus, in Chapter 5, we examined whether the uncertainty of predicting fluctuations of currency values can be improved using only intra-cluster information."

Thus,we considered both classification and regression problems to take into account the robustness of our experimental results.\nIn constructing these experiments, we referred to other prior research that planned experiments similar to this study and suggested improvements in the existingmodels and evaluation performances (Jana, 2021a; Liu et al., 2019; Jana, 2021b; Jana & Ghosh, 2018; Jana & Pal, 2021; Jana et al., 2021).

Experiment 1was used as a baseline experiment by using the log-returns and EVaR of gold price per ounce in currencies data of the entire 48 countries in prediction. The other three experiments were designed to check the influence using the information flow network-based clustering results and PageRank-based key currency results. Experiment 2 used network-based clustering results, which means it used only the data columns in the same communities.

Experiment 2 used other currency data from the same community to predict currency prices. Centrality result refers to the outcomes from Sect. 4.2.2, where key currencies were chosen based on the PageRank of the network. Experiment 3 included the currency price data from the key currencies in predicting the currency price of one country, and Experiment 4 contained both clustering and centrality data in the prediction. Finally, we conducted prediction experiments of the fluctuations and\nlog-return values, including 5-day EVaR, 10-day EVaR, and 20-day EVaR values, also using their centrality measures as we mentioned above.\nTwo sub-experiments were performed for each experiment: predicting the fluctuation and the value.

First, we selected the most widely used algorithms in recent studies: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam, andAdaDelta. Then,we selected the bestmodel from the experiments using different optimizers. The metrics for evaluating the models were used differently for two sub-experiments: in predicting the fluctuation, accuracy and macro F1 score were used, and for predicting the value, we used MAE, RMSE, and MDAE.

The result implies that Experiment 2, Experiment 3, and Experiment 4 showed statistically better\nTable 11 Experiment description\nML Model Experiment 1 Experiment 2 Experiment 3 Experiment 4\nLR 52.55 \u00b1 0.13 54.87 \u00b1 0.09 53.43 \u00b1 0.05 53.93 \u00b1 0.01 DT 51.09 \u00b1 0.05 52.55 \u00b1 0.05 51.34 \u00b1 0.08 51.70 \u00b1 0.01 KM 53.76 \u00b1 0.09 54.36 \u00b1 0.11 54.17 \u00b1 0.05 54.35 \u00b1 0.03 XGB 53.37 \u00b1 0.04 55.02 \u00b1 0.04 53.54 \u00b1 0.12 53.72 \u00b1 0.02 LBM 53.24 \u00b1 0.02 54.16 \u00b1 0.02 53.43 \u00b1 0.14 53.00 \u00b1 0.06 SVM 51.01 \u00b1 0.02 51.82 \u00b1 0.08 51.54 \u00b1 0.16 51.04 \u00b1 0.04 RF 53.54 \u00b1 0.06 54.84 \u00b1 0.03 54.34 \u00b1 0.09 54.27 \u00b1 0.03 GNB 52.11 \u00b1 0.09 52.59 \u00b1 0.04 51.86 \u00b1 0.18 52.14 \u00b1 0.05 MLP 53.70 \u00b1 0.04 55.23 \u00b1 0.10 54.29 \u00b1 0.11 53.47 \u00b1 0.09\nTable 14 Average MAE scores in predicting log-returns of gold price per ounce in currencies (%)\nML Model Experiment 1 Experiment 2 Experiment 3 Experiment 4\nCNN 3.55 4.20 3.49 2.44\n(35, 72.92%) (36, 75.00%) (42, 87.50%)\nRNN 3.57 4.13 3.49 3.53\n(35, 72.92%) (36, 75.00%) (42, 87.50%)\nLSTM 3.56 4.12 3.48 3.51\n(35, 72.92%) (36, 75.00%) (42, 87.50%)\nGRU 3.57 4.12 3.48 3.51\n(35, 72.92%) (36, 75.00%) (43, 89.58%)\nThe first value in the parentheses refers to the number of improved currencies compared to the first experiment, and the second value refers to the improvement in percentage\nprediction results for predicting rise and fall of the currency values on the following day compared to Experiment 1.\nSecond, the average result value and the 95% confidence interval in the case of predicting the log-returns are given in Tables 14, 15, 16. Although all log-return forecasts do not indicate a strong statement as in the classification problem, deriving the number of currencies that showed improved metric scores showed meaningful results. In Experiment 2, it was confirmed that approximately 70% or more (34\u201336) of data displayed improved metric scores. Furthermore, by comparing the number of improved countries, Experiment 3 showed slightly better results than Experiment 2. Experiment 4, which combined the clustering and centrality results, showed the most improved prediction results: Over 80% improved currencies compared to Experiment 1. From Table 14, there were cases where the average MAE, RMSE, and MDAE values increased while the number of improved results increased. Such results could be understood as an outlier due to tremendous error values in some countries. Also, those currencies with very few constituents in their communities in EVaR got relatively worse results.\nIn sum, the results of this study can be translated as that predictive power can be improved like the results of prior research as mentioned at the top of Sect. 5.1. This result means that methods using network characteristics can improve predictive power through more efficient data utilization.\nTable 16 Average MDAE scores in predicting log-returns of gold price per ounce in currencies (%)\nML Model Experiment 1 Experiment 2 Experiment 3 Experiment 4\nCNN 3.04 3.53 2.93 3.09\n(34, 70.83%) (38, 79.17%) (43, 89.58%)\nRNN 2.97 3.51 3.03 3.01\n(34, 70.83%) (38, 79.17%) (43, 89.58%)\nLSTM 2.96 3.51 2.98 2.99\n(34, 70.83%) (37, 77.08%) (43, 89.58%)\nGRU 2.96 3.50 2.99 2.99\n(34, 70.83%) (38, 79.17%) (43, 89.58%)\nThe first value in the parentheses refers to the number of improved currencies compared to the first experiment, and the second value refers to the improvement in percentage"

            "text": "This study aimed to improve the exchange rates prediction performance using the causal relationships between log-returns and downside risks of currency values derived from gold and modeling them as networks. We have calculated the causal relationship of log-return, 5-day EVaR, 10-day EVaR, and 20-day EVaR values of currency values through effective transfer entropy. Based on the constructed networks, we generated communities based on their network topology and used them to improve the machine learning-based prediction performance of fluctuations in currency values.\nAs a result of visualizing the directed weighted networks with the transfer entropy as weights, we discovered the novel relationships based on log-return and downside risk values of currency values. For example, the primary currency based on global economic power and the major currency based on causality networks\u2019 centrality measures differed. Using the clustering results derived from the topology of constructed networks for machine learning, we found that the performance statistically significantly improved despite decreasing the number of data columns. Thus, these results can help predict exchange rates in a roundabout way.\nThis study attempted to present a novelmethodology for predicting exchange rates and analyzing exchange rates via log-returns and downside risks of gold price per ounce in currencies. However, factors affecting macroeconomic variables are vast and highly uncertain, making them difficult to quantify. Moreover, quantifying factors based only on currency-related variables may result in a bias, resulting in poor prediction performance as in Experiment 1 of Sect. 5.\nHowever, this study\u2019s novel contribution can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We illustrated causal relationships based on log-returns and downside risks of gold price per ounce in currencies calculated by effective transfer entropy and analyzed through network theory. \u2022 Based on the illustrated log-return and downside risk networks, We used them to reduce information uncertainty in exchange rate prediction, resulting in better or almost similar results even though fewer data were used. \u2022 Since resolving information uncertainty is a significant factor in prediction, the results of this study can be expected to provide a different view on forecasting exchange rate prediction from the perspective of computation efficiency and feature selection.\nIt would be possible to apply more advanced machine learning algorithms for further studies. The models we used were basic machine learning algorithms utilized widely but not conducted based on the latest machine learning model. In addition, the relationship network we constructed only considered causal relationships between currencies and did not encompass other macroeconomic variables that would affect the exchange rates. The following research could derivemore quantitatively developed results considering those improvements. Finally, it would be possible to combine the results with reinforcement learning-based foreign exchange investment methodology and expand in predicting the future price rates of change and risk fluctuations.\nAcknowledgements The authors sincerely appreciate the editors and anonymous reviewers for their feedback and suggestions for improving this study.\nAvailability of data and materials The datasets generated or analyzed during the current study are available in the pacific exchange rates service repository, http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/data.html.
