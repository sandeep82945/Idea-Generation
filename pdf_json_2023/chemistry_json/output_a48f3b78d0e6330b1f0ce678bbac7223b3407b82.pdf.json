Similar to other compounds from the capsaicin class, nonivamide is used as a food additive to confer pungency to foods, as an active ingredient in various anti-inammatory and analgesic topical formulations, and as an anti-riot agent due to its lachrymatory effect.1,2 Moreover, it has been proven that it can be used as a marine antifouling paint, which prevents various marine organisms from adhering to or growing on underwater surfaces.3,4 Recently, nonivamide has been shown to have anti-obesity properties by regulating\nnivamide.\nAB, National Institute of Research for 02 Splaiul Independentei Str., 060021, den@gmail.com; Tel: +40751507779 otechnologies, Politehnica University of\n632\nlipid metabolism and satiety, making it suitable for use as a dietary supplement in maintaining normal body weight.5,6\nWhen considering the adverse effects of capsaicinoids, such as severe cough, transient spasms of the respiratory tract, and irritation of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes, their use should be properly managed since they may lead to signicant impairment in the functions of the human body.\nTo date, several methods have been reported for the determination of nonivamide, these being liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC\u2013MS/MS), and UPLC with UV detection.7\u20139 While these techniques are reliable, repeatable, and sensitive, they possess certain disadvantages such as expensive instruments and reagents, time-consuming sample pretreatment, and the necessity of trained professionals. Since electrochemical methods are sensitive, selective, easier to use, inexpensive, and require minimal sample processing, they may be a suitable alternative for the determination of nonivamide. Only one electrochemical sensor has been developed for this purpose.10\nThe stochastic sensor-based determination approach allows both qualitative and quantitative analysis. To date, many stochastic sensors have been proposed for screening certain diseases, assessing water quality, and determining certain pharmaceutically active ingredients.11\u201314\nIn this work, we propose the use of a portable platform based on a sensor obtained by modifying a matrix comprising TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide paste with calix[6]arene (C6A/TiO2/\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Calix[6]arene was chosen as a material in the sensor design because it presents the cavity (channel) of 5 \u00c5 (ref. 15) needed for producing the stochastic signal. Reduced graphene oxide has excellent conductive and electrical properties, similar to those of pristine graphene due to its heterogeneous structure composed of basal planes of hexagonally displayed sp2 hybridized carbon atoms. As a result, it is oen utilized in the development of electrochemical sensors.16,17 TiO2 is an inexpensive, stable, non-toxic, electrically conductive material capable of improving both sensor response and stability.18 The novelty of the work is given by the utilization of a C6A/TiO2/rGOPE-based sensor as part of a portable platform for on-site analysis of nonivamide in pharmaceutical compounds and water samples."

            "text": "Response characteristics of the sensor in the stochastic mode\nStochastic detection is a two-step process. In the rst step, the current ows through the channel at an applied potential of 200 mV and is modied by the extraction of the analyte from the solution at the membrane\u2013solution interface, blocking the channel and causing the current to drop to 0. This step is called pattern recognition and the period of time during which it occurs denes the analyte signature (toff parameter) and provides information on the qualitative analysis. The analyte signature, and therefore, the time in which the rst step takes place is dependent on the size, geometry, and, in the case of proteins, the rate at which they unfold. In the second phase, called the binding phase, the analyte enters the channel where it binds to the channel wall and undergoes redox processes according to the following equilibrium equation:\nCh(i) + nonivamide(i) 5 Ch$nonivamide(i)\nwhere Ch \u2013 is the channel and i \u2013 the interface. The duration of the second stage represents the ton parameter that provides useful information for quantitative analysis. In Table 1, the response characteristics of the C6A/TiO2/ rGOPE platform obtained from the values of the ton parameter are presented. By correlating the wide linear range with the very low quantication limit and high sensitivity obtained, it can be concluded that the proposed platform represents a reliable method for the determination of nonivamide in pharmaceutical and water samples with minimal sample processing. Hence, the proposed method can be applied in the quality control of topical pharmaceutical dosage forms as well as in the on-site monitoring of surface water quality.\nThe proposed platform demonstrated a very low limit of quantication (LOQ) and a larger linear concentration range when compared with previous methods reported for nonivamide determination. The comparison is presented in Table 2.\nThe stability of the proposed stochastic platform was checked in time. The platform was tested for a period of 6 months, and the sensitivity was measured every day during this\nperiod of time. The variation of the sensitivity was 0.73% at the end of the six months period of measurements, proving its high stability in time. Also, high recoveries were recorded when used for on-site continuous assay of nonivamide in surface water samples for a period of one month. The platform was also used continuously to assess the uniformity content of nonivamide in topical pharmaceutical dosages in a specialized laboratory when, aer one month, the accuracy of measurements vs.HPLC methods was as high as 99.00%.\nThe selectivity of the proposed stochastic platform was checked versus capsaicin (a pharmaceutical compound with a similar structure), diisopropyl adipate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sorbic acid (used as excipients in the formulation of topical pharmaceutical dosages). The signatures obtained for these substances were far higher than 0.4 s proving that nonivamide can be determined selectively in their presence in either water or pharmaceutical formulations. To date, we did not nd any interferent (a compound that may have the same signature), although we tested several similar compounds that may be found as by-products or in surface water, and therefore there may be interferences related to other unknown compounds, to date.\nDetermination of nonivamide from a topical pharmaceutical dosage form and surface water samples\nThe proposed detection platform was used for the determination of nonivamide in topical pharmaceutical dosage and surface water samples. Aer the measurements, the nonivamide signature (toff) together with the corresponding ton value were identied and read off the recorded diagrams, as depicted in Fig. 2. The nonivamide concentrations in the samples were determined using the obtained calibration curve. The calculated recovery and RSD values are summarized in Table 3.\nAccording to the results, the proposed platform is highly reliable for the qualitative and quantitative assay of nonivamide in real samples and can be used for on-site analysis of pharmaceutical products and waters. In addition, the use of the portable platform with the stochastic method, which requires minimal pretreatment of the samples, makes it suitable for onsite analysis in both drug quality control and surface water quality screening.\nUtilization of stochastic mode facilitates the qualitative and quantitative analysis in very complex matrices because the\nge form sample and spiked surface water samples using the proposed\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
