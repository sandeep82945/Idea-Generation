    "abstractText": "Increasing social connection and access to care has been found to decrease the rate of suicide in U.S. veterans. The Veteran Outreach Into the Community to Expand Social Support (VOICES) is an intervention developed by Department Veteran Affairs (VA) staff to improve social connection and provide information about services by implementing community-based Veterans Socials. Seventy veterans at eight locations completed an anonymous cross-sectional survey. This evaluation examined three domains, acceptability (i.e., perceived value), demand (i.e., estimated or actual use), and expansion (i.e., sustainability and increase of Veterans Socials across time and locations). Findings indicated considerable levels of acceptability, demand for, and expansion of this intervention. Additionally, data suggested this intervention may increase social connection and utilization of VA services among attendees.",

            "text": "Veteran suicide prevention continues to be a main priority of the U.S. government (Rubin, 2019). Since 2001, suicide rates among veterans who did not receive care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) increased by a rate of more than four times of those connected to VA care (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2016). Only an estimated 35.5% of veterans with current suicidal ideation are engaged in mental health care, with VA users being much more likely\nto be engaged than non-users (54.7% vs. 23.8%; Nichter et\u00a0al., 2021). The absence or infrequent seeking of care presents a substantial challenge to suicide prevention efforts and connecting veterans to care for unmet health needs.\nBoth internal and external barriers limit access to mental health treatment. Internal barriers are perceptions of mental health, motivation, stigma, and attitudes for seeking treatment (Bovin et\u00a0al., 2019; Pietrzak et\u00a0al., 2010; Zinzow et\u00a0al., 2012). External barriers include lack of awareness about eligibility, services and how to access them (Farmer et\u00a0al., 2017), challenges scheduling appointments (Pietrzak et\u00a0al., 2010), and lack of input from supportive others (Bovin et\u00a0al., 2019). More outreach efforts are needed to overcome these obstacles and provide access to veterans living with mental health conditions (Tsai et\u00a0al., 2020).\nVeteran peer support is an underused intervention that can address both internal and external barriers. Establishing regular contact with knowledgeable peer specialists may increase opportunities for information about available healthcare resources and how to access them. Peer specialists can also help veterans challenge stigma, increase motivation for treatment while collaborating with healthcare providers to link veterans to needed services, and promote wellness (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018a, 2018b).\n* Elizabeth S.

            "text": "Interventions that can increase social connection and feelings of belongingness, promote access to care, and decrease feelings of being a burden may help to bolster suicide prevention efforts. Disrupted social connectedness is related to both suicidal thoughts and behaviors (You et\u00a0al., 2011). According to You et\u00a0al. (2011), one way to mitigate this disruption may be to focus efforts on perceived belonging, which is aligned with the interpersonal theory of suicide. The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that the desire for suicide emerges when someone experiences thwarted belongingness and feelings of burdensomeness (Joiner, 2005). The need to belong consists of the desire for frequent, affectively pleasant interactions with the same individuals over a long period of time (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). When this is thwarted, a person will feel alone and alienated from valued others, whereas perceived burdensomeness refers to the belief that one\u2019s existence is a burden on friends, family, and/or society (Van Orden et\u00a0al., 2010). This framework suggests interventions build a sense of belonging and limit perceived burdensomeness can decrease suicide risk (Van Orden et\u00a0al., 2008).\nRelatedly, Hare-Duke et\u00a0 al. (2019) identified five dimensions of social connectedness. These include (1) closeness (the level individuals feel mutual dependence to specific people or a social group); (2) identity and common bond (the belief that one person shares an important characteristic of others who are part of a group); (3) valued relationships (the positive appraisal of the current relationship); (4) involvement (group engagement and the companionship of others, that is, the perceived availability of others to participate in shared activities); and (5) cared for and accepted (groups acceptance and support). Research consistently shows that individuals with higher levels of social connectedness are physically (Ashida & Heaney, 2008) and mentally (Schwartz & Litwin, 2019) healthier and have higher levels of knowledge, skills, and confidence to manage one's health when experiencing depressive symptoms (Teo et\u00a0al., 2018). Social connectedness has been found to mitigate risk for a variety of mental health circumstances, such as moral injury (Kelley et\u00a0al., 2019), posttraumatic stress disorder (Kintzle et\u00a0al., 2018), feelings of hostility (Sippel et\u00a0al., 2016), depressive symptoms (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019), and feelings of loneliness (Hare-Duke et\u00a0al., 2019).\nResearch that examines U.S. veteran populations suggests that interventions that limit perceived burdensomeness (Compton et. al., 2021; Monteith et\u00a0al., 2013) and enhance social connectedness (Smith et\u00a0al., 2016) and belongingness (Rogers et\u00a0al., 2017) may be protective against the onset of suicidal ideation. These findings\nunderscore the importance of upstream suicide prevention interventions that can act upon multiple social risk factors to better serve veterans.\nCommunity\u2011Building in\u00a0Action\nImproving social risk factors at the community level is important for comprehensive upstream suicide prevention efforts (Caine et\u00a0al., 2018). Various community-based interventions may impact social connectedness and perceived belonging for veterans. Veteran-centered non-governmental organizations can play an important role in enhancing veterans\u2019 social connection and perceived belonging. For example, Team Red, White, & Blue engage in social activities that increase physical activity and team building areas as part of an intervention to bring veterans out of isolation and reintegrate (Angel et\u00a0al., 2018). Other efforts, such as filmmaking and storytelling, have been used to increase a sense of understanding and belonging between veterans and their communities (Mamon et\u00a0al., 2020; Tuval-Mashiach et\u00a0al., 2018). Other approaches have targeted efforts in specific communities, such as rural areas with large numbers of veterans. One approach (i.e., Together with Veterans) provides education in reducing mental health stigma, promoting helpseeking behaviors, and training community leaders to better support veterans and their families (Monteith et\u00a0al., 2020). While these approaches impact veteran connections with others in their community, complementary efforts that seek to engage veterans without expectations of continued participation, may be attractive to veterans with varying levels of community involvement. An intervention that offers social connection and access to care, is inclusive of nonveterans and supportive others, and has a low barrier for participation (e.g., inclusive to all interested and no expectations of continued participation) may fill a gap in community-based approaches for veterans.\nVeterans Coffee Socials (VCS) began in 2014 by peer specialists employed at a Veterans\u00a0Affairs Medical Center and later evolved into other community activities (e.g., volunteer groups, bowling team, gaming club), collectively known as Veteran Outreach Into the Community to Expand Social Support (VOICES) events. The design of the intervention was to (1) improve social connection and support systems through community building that attract veterans with a wide variety of interests and preferences; (2) implement adaptive strategies to remove barriers for veterans to access information, resources, and care; (3) be low-cost and sustainable; and (4) increase community partnerships to improve the lives of veterans.\nThe purpose of this program evaluation was to explore the feasibility of Veterans Coffee Socials (VCS), one type of VOICES intervention, across three domains: acceptability, demand, and expansion. Acceptability examined how the\n1 3\nrecipients valued and responded to the intervention, demand assessed the estimated use of the intervention, and expansion focused on the spread of the intervention across different locations (Bowen et\u00a0al., 2009). This evaluation also explored variables important to access to care (i.e., number of veterans reached who were (a) not in VA care when first engaged in a VCS and (b) later accessed VA care) as well as increased social connection (i.e., if VCS attendees met someone new at these events and socialized with them at least monthly). Moreover, this program evaluation also examined acceptability, demand, and expansion to better understand process outcomes."

            "heading": "Method",
            "text": "Although VOICES can be implemented using multiple platforms (e.g., video gaming, volunteer groups), this evaluation focused only on VCS. The VCS examined were weekly 90-min events with informal agendas primarily based on spending time with others at a set location (Gorman et\u00a0al., 2018). While a VCS can begin with a veteran host in the community, the VCS in this evaluation began with a peer specialist host (a VA employed veteran) who was responsible for reaching out to community stakeholders, veterans\u2019 organizations, veteran-friendly businesses, and local veterans to start the VCS. The VCS were inclusive to all nonveteran supporters (e.g., family, friends, and caregivers) who wanted to attend. During a VCS, hosts could refer veterans to needed services within the VA and implement patient navigation techniques if the opportunity arose (e.g., active listening and referral; DeGroff et\u00a0al., 2019). After approximately six months, once attendance became stable, the peer specialist asked a group of regular veteran attendees to take ownership of the VCS and host it (i.e., ensure that the VCS continued to run within their community). This gradual transition to a new community host allowed the peer specialist to then begin VCS in other locales.\nVCS is consistent with effective peer support models (Davidson et\u00a0al., 1999) and seeks to use these strategies to increase community-based social support among veterans (Drebing et\u00a0al., 2018). Moreover, the interactions during these events builds trust and friendships, which could be particularly helpful because the source of the social support matters; relationships with friends impact the association between stress and loneliness significantly more than any other support system (Lee & Goldstein, 2016). VCS attendees may experience this relaxed environment as less stigmatizing than traditional interventions because of the unofficial structure and use of peer hosts. Further, this open arrangement enables attendees of the VCS to make changes in format, structure, or activity as they see fit and can evolve\ninto other social, volunteer, virtual, or recreational events external to or in place of the original VCS platform."

Data were collected from eight weekly VCS which met for approximately 90\u00a0min and had been meeting for at least two years. All but one VCS had transitioned to a community-based veteran host prior to collecting data with VA peer specialist staff attending at least monthly. All VCS locations were in the northeastern part of the United States. To be included in this evaluation, a VCS had to meet four criteria: (1) meet weekly and be operational for at least six months; (2) maintain multiple attendees who attended more than twice per month for multiple months; (3) be open to nonveteran supporters; and (4) allow for new attendees. VCS had at least three procedural components that include: (1) welcoming, in which the host informally introduced themselves and set expectations of the event to each new attendee; (2) engaging, which involved creating an atmosphere for attendees to connect interpersonally, whether through commonality, interests, or goals; and (3) building opportunities for future social interactions, by informing attendees of upcoming events in the community to connect outside the VCS on their own. Further, hosts have information about local resources readily available, they also have the contact information of VA peer specialists whom they have met multiple times and can reach out to when needed. Hosts\u2019 relationships with peer specialists allows hosts to guide or refer attendees to an approachable and knowledgeable veteran that can connect them to Veterans Affairs (VA) and community resources or services as needed. Once chosen, a peer specialist met with hosts of the VCS to review the data collection process and program quality improvement efforts and explained that participation was optional and that surveys were anonymous. Verbal consent was given, and the peer specialist was available to answer any further questions about the survey.\nSurveys were collected only once at each location over 4 months in 2018\u20132019 to minimize disruption to the intervention. The survey was self-report and took approximately 15\u00a0min to complete. Completed surveys were placed in a sealed envelope by the participant. All participants completed the survey during their scheduled VCS meeting time, and no compensation was given. Some attendees participated in multiple VCS, so instructions were given for attendees to complete this survey on only one occasion.\nIn addition to the survey collected at the VCS, programlevel data (e.g., number of VCS each year, start dates of each VCS, frequency of VCS) was also gathered to better frame this intervention over time.\n1 3"

Acceptability was measured by the value participants attached to the VCS (e.g., How valuable to you is this coffee social?). The estimated or actual use of an intervention, or demand, was investigated through questions about attendance (e.g., How many times have you attended this coffee social in the past three months?). Expansion focused on the proliferation of the intervention in different locations (program level-data) and the sustainability or continuity of VCS gatherings across time. Moreover, this evaluation explored evidence of social connection through attendee reports of socializing with one another outside of the VCS, and observations related to attendee introduction to VA care.

Exploring the long-term benefit of participating in a VCS intervention, specifically on social support systems, healthcare utilization, and clinical outcomes, would better direct implementation efforts. Most veterans currently experiencing suicidal ideation are not engaged in mental health care (Nichter et\u00a0al., 2021), so community-based interventions that can engage veterans could bolster suicide prevention efforts.\nThis is the first feasibility evaluation of the Veterans Coffee Socials (VCS) an innovative, community-based suicide prevention program targeting elements of suicide prevention among veterans, specifically delayed access to needed healthcare and social connectedness. The primary aim of this evaluation was to examine the feasibility of VCS. Findings from our evaluation suggest that VCS are feasible with respect to acceptability (most attendees surveyed described the VCS as a valued activity in their lives), demand (frequency of attendance, sustained participation over time, attendees participating in multiple locations, and reported interest in growing the intervention\u2019s type and content), and expansion (growth of VCS over time to new geographic locations).

Although the direct cause of choosing to connect to VA care is unknown, these preliminary findings are suggestive that VCS provide a pathway to care for veterans in the community. This is a particularly salient finding as veterans who are not connected to care may not respond to traditional VA outreach. VCS could play a role in engaging veterans who are not currently being engaged. Veterans report numerous barriers to accessing VA care (Elnitsky et\u00a0al., 2013). Unfortunately, the rate of suicide is far higher in veterans who do not use VA services than those veterans in VA care (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2019). Connecting veterans through interventions with low-barrier models of participation, where the only requirements is attending with no obligation to attend regularly, can play an important role in upstream suicide prevention strategies."

These types of partnerships are being prioritized through policy in both the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide 2018\u20132028 (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018a) and Department of Veterans Affairs Strategic Plan 2018\u20132024 (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018b) as well as through programming in rural communities (Monteith et\u00a0al., 2020). Further, this intervention addresses upstream risk and protective factors, one of the five priorities for reducing military and veteran suicide set by the Biden administration (United States, 2021). Specifically, VCS may complement these efforts through building social support systems with few barriers to participation, consequently facilitating the growth of other community interventions, partnerships, and stakeholder organizations."

            "text": "This evaluation was designed to be unobtrusive. The length of the survey, the depth of the questions and demographic variables were limited. Although it is known how long participants have been involved in the VCS or attended in the past three months, the exact number of total events attended is unknown prior to completing the survey, which could impact the variables examined (e.g., feelings of companionship). Participants who completed the survey after six events may have different perceptions of the VCS compared to participants who completed the survey after 20 events. Further, since the study is crosssectional, it is uncertain if ratings for some individuals could be stable over time regardless of how many events they attended. In addition, the VCS surveyed were held\non different days, had different hosts, and it is possible that some groups had overlapping members, even though explicit instructions were given to only complete the survey for a single VCS. As a result, group equivalency across multiple characteristics is unknown.\nUsing a self-report survey to collect declared information rather than more observable data increases the risk of the data being affected by participant error. Further, VCS chosen for this evaluation were established; they had been active for at least two\u00a0years. It is unclear if newer or less established VCS would have elicited different results. In this study, data on dropout rates were unavailable, so it is unknown if the dropout rate was a significant concern for this intervention. Although embedding peer specialists within a VCS will likely impact retention (Minick et\u00a0al., 2016), it remains unknown if a VCS without any peer specialist involvement will lead to results comparable to our findings.\nWith these limitations in mind, the findings provide evidence of the feasibility of VCS, thus supporting future research inquiry into the effectiveness of this intervention (Bowen et\u00a0al., 2009). Moreover, preliminary findings suggest that VCSs play a role in facilitating access to healthcare services and social connection. Future studies might explore the impact of the intervention across different ethnic, racial, and cultural groups and targeted programming aimed at reaching vulnerable and disconnected subpopulations of veterans. Exploring the long-term benefit of participating in a VCS intervention, specifically on social support systems, healthcare utilization, and clinical outcomes, would better direct implementation efforts. In general, studies focusing on the effectiveness of the intervention would bolster this promising community-building intervention. It may be beneficial to inquire more around perceived burdensomeness, a significant challenge in suicide prevention efforts (Compton et\u00a0al., 2021; Monteith et\u00a0al., 2013), because the flexibility in the structure of a VCS allows for attendees who may have once needed help, to then take on the role of helping others (e.g., hosting or information sharing).\nFurther, since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected this typically in-person intervention, efforts to transition and evaluate VCS to a virtual setting are currently in progress. Examining different platforms (e.g., gaming club or volunteer group) to engage veterans in the community may have the added effect of facilitating social connection for veterans who have different interests, goals, and concerns. Finally, more research and implementation related to seeking partnerships and collaborating with pre-existing veteran community networks will be critical to more efficiently support veterans. Overall, developing and working with the social systems veterans already trust can help to build capacity\n1 3\nin their communities, create a space for veterans help one another, and better serve their needs.\nFunding This work was supported by the United States (U.S.) Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention."
