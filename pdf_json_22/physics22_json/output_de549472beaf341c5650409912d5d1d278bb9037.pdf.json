    "abstractText": "Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is known to gain coherent amplification of molecular vibrations that allow for rapid and label-free chemical imaging in the microscopy setting. However, the tightly focused laser spot has limited the detection sensitivity, partly due to the tiny interaction volume. Here, we report the use of metal-lined hollow-core fiber (MLHCF) to improve the sensitivity of SRS in sensing dilute solutions by extending the light\u2013matter interaction volume through the fiber waveguide. With a focusing lens (100 mm FL) and 320 \u03bcm diameter fiber, we demonstrated an optimum enhancement factor of ~20 at a fiber length of 8.3 cm. More importantly, the MLHCF exhibited a significantly suppressed cross-phase modulation (XPM) background, enabling the detection of ~0.7 mM DMSO in water. Furthermore, the relationship between fiber length and SRS signal could be well explained theoretically. The fiber-enhanced SRS (FE-SRS) method may be further optimized and bears potential in the sensitive detection of molecules in the solution and gas phases.",

            "text": "Raman scattering spectroscopy, a fundamental technique based on molecular rotation and bond vibration, is used to provide intrinsic molecular information of samples noninvasively [1]. Spontaneous Raman scattering is known to be limited by the weak scattering cross-section that hinders its application for sensitive detection and biomedical imaging. A few types of techniques have been developed to boost the scattering efficiency including surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) via plasmonic enhanced local electric field [2], UV-enhanced Raman (UV-Raman) via electronic resonance [3], and coherent Raman scattering (CRS) via coherent nonlinear optical amplification [4\u20136]. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is a type of CRS with well-preserved spectral line shapes, in contrast to the other\u2014coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) with distorted spectra [7\u20139]. In addition, SRS signal is linearly proportional to molecular concentration, whereas CARS is nonlinear; hence, SRS is preferred for quantitative chemical analysis [9\u201312]. Most commonly adapted in the microscopy mode, SRS is attracting growing interest for rapid chemical imaging in various research areas including label-free tissue histology, metabolic imaging, drug delivery, and material science [6,13\u201323]. However, SRS microscopy has limited detectability for low-concentration analytes, with a typical detection limit of a few mM for small molecules such as DMSO [24]. Given the signal of ISRS \u221d NIpIS, although the tightly focused laser beams gain much in power densities of the pump Ip and Stokes IS beams, it sacrifices the number of probed molecules N because of the small focal volume. Since the excitation laser powers cannot exceed the damage threshold, the detection of dilute solutions remains a challenge. Furthermore, as the analyte concentration\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 243. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12040243 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 243 2 of 11\nbecomes lower, the non-Raman background (e.g., cross-phase modulation\u2014XPM) begins to overwhelm the true SRS signal, causing signal-to-background issues [8,25,26]. An alternative way to gain the signal is to increase the number of interacting molecules. For spontaneous Raman, fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) has been developed for the real-time detection of molecules filled in hollow-core optical fibers [27]. The fiber core waveguide confines the optical fields and effectively extends the interaction volume with molecules. Hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) [28] and metal-lined hollowcore fiber (MLHCF) [29\u201331] are the two major types of fiber used for detection, which have their advantages and disadvantages [32]. For HC-PCF, the low transmission loss and large numerical aperture (NA) allow for the efficient generation of spontaneous and stimulated Raman scattering [33\u201335], and it has demonstrated potential in the sensitive sensing of biomolecules and pharmaceuticals [36\u201339]. However, the small core diameter of HC-PCF tends to generate detrimental nonlinear optical signals such as the XPM and four-wave mixing (FWM). Moreover, it also restricts the efficient transport of liquid or gas, limiting the potential applications for fast sensing. Furthermore, liquid-filled HC-PCF results in a much narrowed optical bandwidth and increased transmission loss [37,40], introducing additional difficulties for SRS detection. In contrast, MLHCF with a larger core diameter enables rapid chemical exchange under normal pressure [29,41], and the metal surface reflection ensures a broad bandwidth; hence, MLHCF may be more suited for real-time sensing of gas or liquid with SRS. Despite extensive studies on hollow-core fiber sensing with spontaneous Raman scattering and fluorescence measurements [38,42], the properties of the SRS signal of molecules in hollow-core fibers remain unexplored. In this work, we demonstrated the use of MLHCF to enhance SRS signal for detecting low-concentration solutions. Our results showed the competing effects of SRS signal amplification and power loss with increasing fiber length, which agreed well with the theoretical model. In our particular system, composed of a 100 mm focal length lens and a 320 \u00b5m diameter MLHCF with a sample volume of 6.7 \u00b5L, a maximum enhancement factor of ~20 was achieved with a fiber length of 8.3 cm. More interestingly, we found the XPM background was significantly suppressed in MLHCF. A detection limit down to ~0.7 mM of DMSO/water solution was achieved in the loose focusing geometry."

            "text": "As a nonlinear optical process, SRS requires two synchronized pulsed lasers, the pump (\u03c9p) and Stokes (\u03c9s) beams. When the frequency difference between two beams matches the bond vibration (\u2126) of interest (i.e., \u03c9p\u2212\u03c9s = \u2126), the molecules inside the laser focal volume are coherently excited (Figure 1A), with orders of magnitude (~103\u2013105) gain of efficiency compared with spontaneous Raman scattering. In our study, a commercial femtosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO, Insight DS+, Newport, CA, USA) with dual outputs was used as the laser source. The fundamental 1040 nm beam was used as the Stokes beam (~150 fs), and the tunable OPO output (680\u20131300 nm, 120 fs) was used as the pump beam. To obtain a higher spectral resolution with the \u201cspectral focusing\u201d mode, high-dispersive glass rods (SF57) were used to chirp the pump and Stokes beams to ~2.3 and ~1.2 ps, respectively [43]. The Stokes beam was modulated by an electrooptical modulator (EOM, EO-AM-R-20-C2, Thorlabs) at 20 MHz and aligned with pump beam through a dichroic mirror (DMSP1000, Thorlabs) and focused into the hollow-core fiber by a lens (AC254-100-B, Thorlabs), while the output was collimated by another lens,\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 243 3 of 11\nthrough a bandpass filter (CARS ET890/220, Chroma) to pass the pump beam, and sent to a homemade back-biased photodiode (PD). The stimulated Raman loss (SRL, Figure 1B) signal was collected by a lock-in amplifier (LIA) (HF2LI, Zurich Instruments) to demodulate the 20 MHz signal from the PD (Figure 1C). The power of the pump and Stokes beams incident into the focusing lens were kept at 200 and 100 mW, respectively. The SRS spectra were measured by scanning the time delay between the pump and Stokes pulses, with 50 ms integration time for each spectral point.\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\nmode,\u00a0high\u2010dispersive\u00a0glass\u00a0rods\u00a0(SF57)\u00a0were\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0chirp\u00a0the\u00a0pump\u00a0and\u00a0Stokes\u00a0beams\u00a0 to\u00a0~2.3\u00a0and\u00a0~1.2\u00a0ps,\u00a0respectively\u00a0[43].\u00a0The\u00a0Stokes\u00a0beam\u00a0was\u00a0modulated\u00a0by\u00a0an\u00a0electro\u2010optical\u00a0 modulator\u00a0(EOM,\u00a0EO\u2010AM\u2010R\u201020\u2010C2,\u00a0Thorlabs)\u00a0at\u00a020\u00a0MHz\u00a0and\u00a0aligned\u00a0with\u00a0pump\u00a0beam\u00a0 through\u00a0a\u00a0dichroic\u00a0mirror\u00a0(DMSP1000,\u00a0Thorlabs)\u00a0and\u00a0focused\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0hollow\u2010core\u00a0fiber\u00a0 by\u00a0 a\u00a0 lens\u00a0 (AC254\u2010100\u2010B,\u00a0Thorlabs),\u00a0while\u00a0 the\u00a0 output\u00a0was\u00a0 collimated\u00a0 by\u00a0 another\u00a0 lens,\u00a0 through\u00a0a\u00a0bandpass\u00a0filter\u00a0(CARS\u00a0ET890/220,\u00a0Chroma)\u00a0to\u00a0pass\u00a0the\u00a0pump\u00a0beam,\u00a0and\u00a0sent\u00a0to\u00a0 a\u00a0homemade\u00a0back\u2010biased\u00a0photodiode\u00a0(PD).\u00a0The\u00a0stimulated\u00a0Raman\u00a0loss\u00a0(SRL,\u00a0Figure\u00a01B)\u00a0 signal\u00a0was\u00a0collected\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0lock\u2010in\u00a0amplifier\u00a0(LIA)\u00a0(HF2LI,\u00a0Zurich\u00a0Instruments)\u00a0to\u00a0demodu\u2010 late\u00a0the\u00a020\u00a0MHz\u00a0signal\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0PD\u00a0(Figure\u00a01C).\u00a0The\u00a0power\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pump\u00a0and\u00a0Stokes\u00a0beams\u00a0 incident\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0focusing\u00a0lens\u00a0were\u00a0kept\u00a0at\u00a0200\u00a0and\u00a0100\u00a0mW,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0 were\u00a0measured\u00a0by\u00a0scanning\u00a0the\u00a0time\u00a0delay\u00a0bet een\u00a0the\u00a0pu p\u00a0and\u00a0Stokes\u00a0pulses,\u00a0 ith\u00a050\u00a0 ms\u00a0integration\u00a0time\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0spectral\u00a0point.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Experimental\u00a0design:\u00a0(A)\u00a0energy\u00a0diagram\u00a0of\u00a0stimulated\u00a0Raman\u00a0scattering\u00a0(SRS);\u00a0(B)\u00a0illus\u2010\ntration\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0laser\u00a0intensity\u00a0changes\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0result\u00a0of\u00a0stimulated\u00a0Raman\u00a0loss\u00a0(SRL)\u00a0and\u00a0stimulated\u00a0Ra\u2010\nman\u00a0gain\u00a0(SRG);\u00a0(C)\u00a0optical\u00a0layout\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0fiber\u2010enhanced\u00a0stimulated\u00a0Raman\u00a0scattering\u00a0setup.\u00a0EOM:\u00a0\nelectro\u2010optic\u00a0modulator;\u00a0MLHCF:\u00a0metal\u2010lined\u00a0hollow\u2010core\u00a0fiber;\u00a0BP:\u00a0bandpass\u00a0filter;\u00a0PD:\u00a0photodi\u2010\node;\u00a0LIA:\u00a0lock\u2010in\u00a0amplifier.\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0Fiber\u00a0Adapter\u00a0 As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a01C,\u00a0our\u00a0designed\u00a0fiber\u00a0adapter\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0of\u00a0aluminum\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0 small\u00a0chamber\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0liquid\u00a0cell,\u00a0an\u00a0inlet\u00a0and\u00a0an\u00a0outlet\u00a0side\u2010holes\u00a0to\u00a0inject\u00a0or\u00a0extract\u00a0the\u00a0 sample.\u00a0The\u00a0front\u00a0surface\u00a0was\u00a0sealed\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0coverslip,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0back\u00a0surface\u00a0was\u00a0connected\u00a0 with\u00a0a\u00a0ceramic\u00a0ferrule\u00a0to\u00a0guide\u00a0the\u00a0MLHCF\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0liquid\u00a0cell.\u00a0The\u00a0adapters\u00a0were\u00a0installed\u00a0 at\u00a0both\u00a0ends\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0fiber\u00a0to\u00a0stably\u00a0mount\u00a0the\u00a0MLHCF.\u00a0Precise\u00a0micrometer\u00a0alignment\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0"

In addition, the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens (~0.01) was smaller than the effective NA of the MLHCF (0.05), and the coupling efficiency of the beams into the fiber could reach to approximately 100%. When the core of the MLHCF was filled with liquid sample, the absorption of near infrared (NIR) light by the long-path liquid resulted in power loss. To quantify the attenuation coefficient (\u03b1), we measured the laser power losses caused by the fiber. The input power (P0) and transmitted power (PT) of the pump and Stokes beams before and after the fibers with different lengths (L) were measured, and the transmission efficiency \u03b7 = PT/P0 of the fibers filled with sample solutions could be calculated. As shown in Figure S1, air-filled hollow-core fiber showed minimal attenuation. In contrast, the attenuation coefficients of the laser beams through the ethanol-filled fiber were found to be \u03b1p = 8.1 m\u22121 and \u03b1s = 13.7 m\u22121 at the wavelengths of 952 and 1040 nm, respectively, which qualitatively agree with the absorption spectrum of ethanol [44]."

            "text": "The principle and optical design of the fiber coupled SRS is illustrated in Figure 1. We first characterized the dependence of SRS on fiber length with ethanol (95 v/v%, 16.3 M), targeting at the Raman band of ~881 cm\u22121 (C-C-O symmetric stretching vibration modes) [45]. The SRS spectrum of ethanol was found to agree well with its spontaneous Raman spectrum (Figure 2A and Figure S2). In our study, the additional dispersion of liquids did not seem to significantly affect the SRS spectra. Figure 2B shows the measured SRS spectra of ethanol with different fiber lengths, ranging from 2.7 to 49.5 cm. SRS intensity demonstrated an initial increase with increasing fiber length, followed by a decay as the fiber further lengthened (Figure 2C). Such a behavior indicates a competing effect between a gain and a loss mechanism as the light waves propagate through the liquid. It is known that the SRS process results in the annihilation of the pump photons and the generation of Stokes photons, while the net photon energy loss is converted to the molecular vibrational excited states (Figure 1A). As a result, the pump beam experiences a reduction in intensity\u2014stimulated Raman loss (SRL), and the Stokes beam experiences an increase in intensity\u2014stimulated Raman gain (SRG) [5]. Further taking the laser attenuation into account, the coupled equations of the pump and Stokes beams intensities can be written as [46]:\ndIp dz = \u2212 \u03c9p \u03c9s gR Ip Is \u2212 \u03b1p Ip (1)\ndIs dz = gR Ip Is \u2212 \u03b1s Is (2)\nwhere gR is the Raman-gain coefficient, and \u03b1 is the attenuation constant of the fiber.

The fractional change in SRS could also be analyzed in Figure 2D, indicating that although the absolute SRS intensity decays almost exponentially as the fiber length becomes much longer, and the fractional change reaches a maximum constant, in our case, ~10\u22123. By fitting the fractional change in SRS, the Raman gain coefficient of the particular mode can be extracted as gR = 0.058 m\u22121 \u00b7W\u22121. The slight difference between the numerical and analytical solutions can be found in Figure S3.

Even by removing the background, the detectable concentration was limited to as large as ~340 mM (Figure 3B). The XPM background is the nonlinear optical effect that alters the refractive index of the medium by intense light pulses, changing its spectral property as well as the spatial profile. It can be concluded that the XPM is a significant issue for detecting dilute solutions, in both the microscopy mode and in the single-focusing lens mode. In strong contrast, the detectability of SRS with MLHCF was greatly enhanced. SRS signal through a MLHCF (8.3 cm long) was enhanced almost 20 times compared with the result from the 1 mm thick cuvette. As shown in Figure 3C, the detection limit could reach down to ~17 mM. The linear dependence of signal intensity on ethanol concentration was shown in Figure S4. In addition to the signal enhancement, MLHCF exhibited much suppressed XPM background, which is of great importance for SRS detection. The suppression of the nonlinear XPM might be because of the much weaker power density in the large-core fiber waveguide. As illustrated in Figure 3D, for 1.72 M ethanol, while the SRS spectrum from the cuvette was already overwhelmed by the large background, the spectrum from the fiber had a negligible XPM background and showed a single narrow Raman band at approximately 881 cm\u22121."

The raw SRS spectra of the DMSO/water solutions sealed in the cuvette with varying concentrations are presented in Figure 4A. Although the overall SRS signal in this spectral range was approximately an order of magnitude larger than the intensity in the fingerprint region, obvious XPM background still becomes dominant for low-concentration solutions. After background correction, the detection limit was estimated to be ~14.1 mM as demonstrated in Figure 4B. As for MLHCF (8.3 cm long), the detectable concentration could be pushed down to ~0.7 mM (Figure 4C).

Similar to the fingerprint region results, the suppression of the XPM background was also significant (Figure 4D). The combined advantages of remarkable signal enhancement and efficient background reduction ensured that fibre-enhanced SRS (FE-SRS) with MLHCF could be used for sensitive detection of dilute solutions. Our proof-of-principle work demonstrated the feasibility of FE-SRS coupled with MLHCF. Although the signal enhancement compared with single-lens geometry was significant, the improvement in the detectability relative to the microscopy geometry was only moderate at the current stage [24]. The enhancement factor may be further improved in a few ways. Firstly, using a smaller fiber diameter (d) should increase the laser power density, and the overall SRS signal is estimated to be proportional to d\u22122. However, the XPM background may also be increased with a smaller diameter. Hence, the optimum diameter size will need to be experimentally decided to balance the SRS enhancement and XPM. Secondly, the optimum fiber length and enhancement factor is closely related to the absorption loss of the laser beams in liquids. Our simulation results showed that the optimum fiber length of SRS intensity was strongly dependent on the loss coefficient (\u03b1p), while it was less sensitive to the Raman gain coefficient (gR) (Figure S5). Since water and ordinary organic solvents have much less absorption in the visible wavelength range than in the NIR, FE-SRS is expected to be improved using visible light, which has additional gain in Raman scattering efficiency with shorter wavelengths. Therefore, systematic optimization of FE-SRS effect should consider the aforementioned factors, which requires the engineering of MLHCF and frequency-doubled SRS for further investigations. In addition, the small volume in the fiber (~6.7 \u00b5L) was advantageous for the measurement of valuable samples,\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 243 8 of 11\nbut the current chamber in the home-made fiber adapter was spared quite a large volume (~192 \u00b5L), which could be reduced with improved design of the adapter.\nBiosensors\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0\nat\u00a0~2915\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0(C\u2010H\u00a0band,\u00a0antisymmetric\u00a0stretching)\u00a0was\u00a0chosen\u00a0to\u00a0quantify\u00a0SRS\u00a0intensity\u00a0 of\u00a0DMSO\u00a0 (Figure\u00a0S2).\u00a0The\u00a0raw\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0DMSO/water\u00a0solutions\u00a0sealed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 cuvette\u00a0with\u00a0varying\u00a0concentrations\u00a0are\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04A.\u00a0Although\u00a0the\u00a0overall\u00a0SRS\u00a0 signal\u00a0 in\u00a0 this\u00a0spectral\u00a0range\u00a0was\u00a0approximately\u00a0an\u00a0order\u00a0of\u00a0magnitude\u00a0 larger\u00a0 than\u00a0 the\u00a0 intensity\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0fingerprint\u00a0region,\u00a0obvious\u00a0XPM\u00a0background\u00a0still\u00a0becomes\u00a0dominant\u00a0for\u00a0 low\u2010concentration\u00a0 solutions.\u00a0After\u00a0background\u00a0correction,\u00a0 the\u00a0detection\u00a0 limit\u00a0was\u00a0esti\u2010 mated\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0~14.1\u00a0mM\u00a0as\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04B.\u00a0As\u00a0for\u00a0MLHCF\u00a0(8.3\u00a0cm\u00a0long),\u00a0the\u00a0 detectable\u00a0concentration\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0pushed\u00a0down\u00a0to\u00a0~0.7\u00a0mM\u00a0(Figure\u00a04C).\u00a0The\u00a0linear\u00a0con\u2010 centration\u00a0dependence\u00a0of\u00a0SRS\u00a0intensity\u00a0is\u00a0plotted\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a0S4,\u00a0indicating\u00a0the\u00a0capability\u00a0of\u00a0 quantitative\u00a0measurements.\u00a0Similar\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0fingerprint\u00a0region\u00a0results,\u00a0the\u00a0suppression\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0XPM\u00a0background\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0significant\u00a0(Figure\u00a04D).\u00a0The\u00a0combined\u00a0advantages\u00a0of\u00a0re\u2010 markable\u00a0signal\u00a0enhancement\u00a0and\u00a0efficient\u00a0background\u00a0reduction\u00a0ensured\u00a0that\u00a0fibre\u2010en\u2010 hanced\u00a0SRS\u00a0(FE\u2010SRS)\u00a0with\u00a0MLHCF\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0for\u00a0sensitive\u00a0detection\u00a0of\u00a0dilute\u00a0solu\u2010 tions.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Original\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0DMSO/water\u00a0solutions\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0cuvette\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0concentra\u2010\ntions;\u00a0(B)\u00a0background\u2010corrected\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0DMSO/water\u00a0solutions\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0cuvette\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0\nconcentrations;\u00a0(C)\u00a0background\u2010corrected\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0(2915\u00a0cm\u22121)\u00a0of\u00a0DMSO\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0concen\u2010\ntrations\u00a0via\u00a0MLHCF\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0length\u00a0of\u00a08.3\u00a0cm;\u00a0(D)\u00a0SRS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0704\u00a0mM\u00a0DMSO\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0cuvette\u00a0and\u00a0\nthe\u00a08.3\u00a0cm\u00a0fiber.\u00a0\nOur\u00a0proof\u2010of\u2010principle\u00a0work\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0 the\u00a0 feasibility\u00a0of\u00a0FE\u2010SRS\u00a0 coupled\u00a0with\u00a0 MLHCF.\u00a0Although\u00a0the\u00a0signal\u00a0enhancement\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0single\u2010lens\u00a0geometry\u00a0was\u00a0sig\u2010 nificant,\u00a0 the\u00a0 improvement\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0detectability\u00a0relative\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0microscopy\u00a0geometry\u00a0was\u00a0 only\u00a0moderate\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0current\u00a0stage\u00a0[24].\u00a0The\u00a0enhancement\u00a0factor\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0further\u00a0improved\u00a0 in\u00a0a\u00a0few\u00a0ways.\u00a0Firstly,\u00a0using\u00a0a\u00a0smaller\u00a0fiber\u00a0diameter\u00a0(d)\u00a0should\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0laser\u00a0power\u00a0 density,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0overall\u00a0SRS\u00a0signal\u00a0is\u00a0estimated\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0proportional\u00a0to\u00a0d\u22122.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0 XPM\u00a0background\u00a0may\u00a0also\u00a0be\u00a0 increased\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0smaller\u00a0diameter.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0 the\u00a0optimum\u00a0\nIn terms of applications, FE-SRS may open up new opportunities for sensing dilute solutions of biomolecules, drugs, etc. It will also be useful to rigorously compare the detectability of fiber-enhanced SRS with spontaneous Raman scattering. Especially for molecules with a low laser damage threshold, the much lower power density in the fiber waveguide may become a key advantage for stable measurements, compared with the common confocal Raman geometry where th focused laser spot is pro e to cause sample degradation. Furthermore, CARS spectro copy may be wo th expl ring with MLHCF, which is superior in a broader spectral range and improved spectroscopy with the help of advanced spectral analysis techniques [47]."
