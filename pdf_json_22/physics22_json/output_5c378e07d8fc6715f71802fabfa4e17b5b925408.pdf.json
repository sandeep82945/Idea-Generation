    "abstractText": "Multifunctional two-dimensional (2D) multiferroics are promising materials for designing lowdimensional multipurpose devices. The key to multifunctionality in these materials is breaking the space-inversion and the time-reversal symmetry, which results in spontaneous electric polarization and magnetization in the same phase. A new class of 2D materials, Janus 2D materials, has emerged, which works on a similar principle of breaking out-of-plane symmetry to invoke new exciting functionalities in the 2D materials, such as an out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. In this work, a new group of 2D multiferroic Janus monolayers VOXY (X/Y = F, Cl, Br, or I, and X 6=Y) is derived by breaking the out-of-plane symmetry in the parent multiferroics VOX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, or I). The structural, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of multiferroics VOX2 are compared with their Janus derivatives. We calculated in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization for VOX2 and VOXY series, where VOFCl, VOFBr, VOFI, and VOClI are found to have significant out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. Our theoretical work predicts a new series of 2D multiferroic materials and encourages their further investigation for high-performance nanoelectronic devices.",

            "text": "Prediction of Magnetoelectric Multiferroic Janus Monolayers VOXY(X/Y = F, Cl, Br, or I, and X6=Y) with in-plane ferroelectricity and out-of-plane piezoelectricity\nAkshay Mahajan1, \u2217 and Somnath Bhowmick1, \u2020 1Department of Materials Science and Engineering,\nIndian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Kanpur 208016, India (Dated: August 31, 2022)\nMultifunctional two-dimensional (2D) multiferroics are promising materials for designing lowdimensional multipurpose devices. The key to multifunctionality in these materials is breaking the space-inversion and the time-reversal symmetry, which results in spontaneous electric polarization and magnetization in the same phase. A new class of 2D materials, Janus 2D materials, has emerged, which works on a similar principle of breaking out-of-plane symmetry to invoke new exciting functionalities in the 2D materials, such as an out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. In this work, a new group of 2D multiferroic Janus monolayers VOXY (X/Y = F, Cl, Br, or I, and X 6=Y) is derived by breaking the out-of-plane symmetry in the parent multiferroics VOX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, or I). The structural, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of multiferroics VOX2 are compared with their Janus derivatives. We calculated in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization for VOX2 and VOXY series, where VOFCl, VOFBr, VOFI, and VOClI are found to have significant out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization. Our theoretical work predicts a new series of 2D multiferroic materials and encourages their further investigation for high-performance nanoelectronic devices.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMultiferroics are multifunctional materials that exhibit more than one ferroic ordering, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity, or ferrotoroidicity, in the same phase. Different combinations of these ferroic orderings can lead to various multiferroic types, like ferroelectric-ferroelastic or ferromagneticferroelastic. Among these different types, the most relevant ones for microelectronics are magnetoelectric multiferroics[1, 2], which combine ferroelectric and magnetic behaviors. Nowadays, the multiferroic term most often refers only to these magnetoelectric multiferroics because of their technological significance. These multiferroics combine spontaneous electric polarization and magnetization that an applied electric and magnetic field can switch, along with some coupling between the two ferroics in certain instances.\nDepending on the microscopic source of ferroelectricity, multiferroics can be further classified as type-I and type-II multiferroics[3]. Multiferroics with independent sources for ferroelectricity and magnetism belong to typeI, which have large polarization values and high transition temperatures but weak magnetoelectric coupling. Multiferroics in which ferroelectricity originates due to the breaking of space-inversion symmetry by the magnetic ordering belong to type-II, which exhibits strong magnetoelectric coupling but smaller polarization values and low transition temperatures. Type-II multiferroics are rare compared to type-I multiferroics but are more attractive due to the possibility of electric-field control of magnetism, a revolution for low-energy data storage[4, 5].\nScientists are challenged to discover and engineer atomically thick multiferroics to incorporate multifunctionality for energy-conserving nanoscale devices with entirely new architectures. However, conventional\nthin films of three-dimensional (3D) multiferroics suffer from quantum tunneling, electron screening, dangling bonds, surface effects, and depolarization[6\u20139]. Therefore, new low-dimensional multiferroic materials are vital for advancing nanoelectronics. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) multiferroics[6, 10], because of their clean surfaces and high dielectric constants, have emerged as a viable option to realize multifunctional nanoscale devices.\nAnother new family of 2D materials that has attracted increasing interest in the 2D research community is the Janus 2D materials[11, 12]. Since the landmark experimental discovery of graphene in 2004[13], several 2D materials have been discovered and investigated for their unique properties and promising applications in diverse fields[14\u201318]. With the further exploration of the remarkable properties of 2D materials by manipulating their structures using several approaches like asymmetrical functionalization by various molecular groups[19\u2013 21], the class of Janus 2D materials has emerged from the concept of asymmetrical facial properties[11, 22]. The breaking of the out-of-plane symmetry in Janus 2D materials arouses many interesting physical phenomena such as strong Rashba spin splitting[23, 24] and outof-plane piezoelectric polarization[25\u201327]. Following the recent experimental investigations where Janus MoSSe monolayer has been fabricated using a modified CVD method[28, 29], several Janus 2D materials have been discovered and investigated both theoretically[30\u201334] and experimentally[35, 36].\nThough the first-ever experimental realization of a 2D multiferroic has been confirmed recently in 2022 only for monolayer NiI2[37], several 2D multiferroics have been discovered in the past decade using density functional theory (DFT) based theoretical methods[10, 38\u2013 46]. Most of them have been identified as type-I multiferroics with very few type-II 2D multiferroics[38, 43].\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n14 20\n3v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n3 0\nA ug\n2 02\n2\n2 Recently, several studies have discovered and investigated a new family of 2D type-I multiferroic VOX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, or I)[47\u201353]. VOX2 monolayers show in-plane ferroelectricity while violating the d0 rule[48] since distortion of V ion with partially occupied d1 electronic configuration is responsible for ferroelectricity. Among the four members, VOF2 and VOI2 have been predicted to have ferromagnetic (FM) ground state spin ordering[48, 51]. Although, later studies predict non-collinear spin texture as the ground state for VOI2 polar structure because the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the heavy element iodine leads to large Dzyaloshinki-Moriya interaction (DMI)[50, 52]. To the best of our knowledge, among all the VOX2 monolayers, only VOCl2 and VOBr2 have\nexperimental data for their 3D counterpart from which VOCl2 and VOBr2 monolayers can be exfoliated[54, 55].\nWe revisited the VOX2 family in the present work and derived the Janus multiferroic VOXY (X/Y = F, Cl, Br, or I, and X6=Y) by creating asymmetry along the out-of-plane direction and breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry. We compared the crystal structure of the Janus VOXY monolayers and discovered a significant change in the bond angles and bond lengths from their parent VOX2, especially in the out-of-plane direction. The VOXY monolayers show FM ground-state magnetic ordering, except VOClBr, without considering SOC effects. Electronic band structure calculations reveal VOClI and VOBrI as direct bandgap semiconductors. Considering collinear magnetism, all FM VOXY monolayers, except VOBrI, predicted to have higher Curie temperature than FM VOF2. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAEs) for VOXY monolayers were compared to VOX2 monolayers, suggesting a significant possibility for FM collinear magnetism in VOFCl. Ferroelectric polarization values and energy barriers for polarization switching pathways for VOXY monolayers are also compared with the VOX2 series. Out-of-plane electric polarization is also calculated for Janus VOXY monolayers. In the end, piezoelectric coefficients are calculated for VOXY and VOX2 monolayers. Large values for in-plane piezoelectric coefficients (e11 from 11.12 to 16.90 \u00d710\u221210 C/m, e12 from -2.54 to -3.91 \u00d710\u221210 C/m) are obtained for all the VOXY monolayers which is also observed in their parent VOX2 monolayers as well. Out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization values for VOFCl, VOFBr, VOFI, and VOClI are comparable to other 2D Janus materials. Our work introduces new series of 2D Janus multiferroics and encourages their further theoretical and experimental investigations for new advanced architectures in nanodevices."

A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 supercell was constructed to consider different possible magnetic orderings. An energy cutoff of 550 eV was used with a gamma-centered k -grid of 9 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 1 to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ). During structural relaxation, atomic positions and lattice constants are optimized using a conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm with the criterion of 0.001 eV/\u00c5 for the HellmanFeynman forces. The energy convergence criterion was fixed to 10\u22126 eV. A vacuum layer of 20 \u00c5 was added in the out-of-plane direction to avoid interactions between the monolayer and its periodic images. The LDIPOLE tag in VASP was used to apply dipole correction for correcting the errors introduced by the periodic boundary conditions.[66] The phonon spectra calculations were done using DFPT+ Phonopy method.[67, 68] Magnetic Anisotropy Energies (MAEs) for each monolayer were calculated using the magnetic force theorem.[69\u201371] During spin-orbit coupling (SOC) calculations to determine MAE, a denser k -grid of 11\u00d7 11\u00d7 1 was used for better convergence of MAE values. The electric polarization values were computed using the standard Berry phase method.[72, 73] See the additional note on electric polarization calculations performed in this work in the Supplemental Material[]. For the calculation of the piezoelectric coefficients, strain is defined as \u03b5 = (a-ao)/ao = (b-bo)/bo, where a, b are in-plane lattice parameters after applied strain and ao, bo are the equilibrium values for the in-plane lattice parameters.\n3"

            "text": "In order to create Janus VOXY monolayers, we started from the ground-state structures of parent VOX2 monolayers and replaced the top layer of halogen atoms with another halogen of higher electronegativity. The higher electronegative halogen atom in the upper layer results in an electric dipole moment within the monolayer pointing towards the positive c-axis. Figure 1 shows the groundstate structure of the VOFCl monolayer, which is the template for the atomic structure of the other VOXY monolayers. The VOXY structures have lower symmetry Pm compared to their parent VOX2 monolayers, which belong to a space group of Pmm2. Lowering the symmetry in the VOXY monolayers results from breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry. Similar to their parent VOX2 monolayers, V ion displacement from its in-plane centrosymmetric position along the a-axis persist in the VOXY monolayers, and thus they are supposed to show similar in-plane ferroelectric properties[47\u201349, 51]. We then verified the stability of these Janus VOXY monolayers by obtaining their phonon spectra, as shown in Figure S1 of the Supplemental Material[]. Since no significant imaginary phonon frequency is observed for any VOXY monolayers, we believe these monolayers to be dynamically stable.\nThe structural parameters for VOXY monolayers are compared with the parent VOX2 monolayers in Table S1 of the Supplemental Materials[]. The lattice constant b increases with the addition of a heavier halogen atom in the monolayer while lattice parameter a does not show significant variation for both VOXY and VOX2 monolayers, similar to the previous works on the VOX2 monolayers[48]. The b lattice constant for VOXY monolayers has values between those for their parent VOX2 monolayers, which is expected. The thickness of the monolayers, which can be considered as the distance between halogen layers as given by X-Y length in Table S1[], increases with the increase in the radii of the halogen atoms. The vanadium-halogen bond length, given as V-X/Y in Table S1 where X is halogen with higher electronegativity, decreases with an increase in the electronegativity of the halogen atom, as can be seen in Table S1 where V-X is always smaller than V-Y. The vanadiumhalogen bond length also depends on the monolayer\u2019s other halogen. For example, comparing the V-X(=F) bond lengths in VOFCl, VOFBr, and VOFI, it increases with the addition of lower electronegative Y halogen atoms (Cl, Br, and I) as 2.028 \u00c5, 2.043 \u00c5, and 2.067 \u00c5, respectively, which are higher than the V-F bond length in VOF2 of 2.001 \u00c5. Similarly, the V-Cl bond increases in VOClBr to 2.597 \u00c5 compared to 2.435 \u00c5 in VOCl2. The difference in vanadium-oxygen bond lengths (V-O1 and V-O2) in each VOXY monolayer provides the polar displacement of the V ion along the in-plane polar axis (a- axis), shown in Table S1. This V ion polar displacement is responsible for possible in-plane ferroelectricity in these systems similar to their parent VOX2 monolay-\ners as investigated in our previous work for VOCl2[49]. X-V-X bond angle is larger than the Y-V-Y bond angle due to higher repulsion among halogen atoms with higher electronegativity. X-V-X bond angle increases further with the decrease in electronegativity of Y halogen and vice versa for the Y-V-Y bond angle, which decreases in the presence of higher electronegative X halogen. Outof-plane asymmetry in VOXY monolayers also results in buckling in the V-O chain, as seen from the O-V-O bond angle values differing from 180\u25e6.\nWe considered four different magnetic orderings, one ferromagnetic (FM) and three antiferromagnetic (AFM1, AFM2, and AFM3), for the VOXY monolayers similar to the ones considered in the previous studies for their parent VOX2 monolayers[47\u201349, 51], which are shown in Figure 1(c). The energy values for these four different magnetic orderings are compared in Table I. All the VOXY monolayers have FM as the lowest energy magnetic ordering, except for VOClBr, which has AFM3 as the minimum energy ordering. From these results, we can predict that for the possibility of an intrinsic ferromagnetic ground state for VOXY monolayers, either F or I is required within the structure. This result is consistent with those for VOX2 monolayers, where only VOF2 and VOI2 monolayers show FM as the lowest energy magnetic ordering. We also calculated the V ion\u2019s magnetic moment for each VOXY and VOX2 monolayers, as shown in Table I. A higher magnetic moment is obtained for monolayers with FM ordering, and the magnetic moment increases with adding a heavier halogen atom to the structure.\nFigure 2 (a) shows the electronic band structure for the VOFCl monolayer with FM magnetic ordering. We observed an indirect band gap of 0.802 eV and a direct band gap of 2.738 eV for the spin-up (black) and spindown (red) bands, respectively. The Supplemental Material provides electronic band structure plots for other VOXY and VOX2 monolayers in Figures S2 and S3, respectively[]. For all VOXY monolayers with FM orderings, one can observe that the spin-down (red) bands have a direct band gap at the \u0393 point larger than the one for spin-up (black) bands. Interestingly, VOClI and VOBrI monolayers show a direct band gap for both spinup (black) and spin-down (red) bands at the \u0393 point. For VOClI monolayer, the electronic band gaps are 0.423 eV and 0.853 eV for spin-up (black) and spin-down (red) bands, respectively. Furthermore, for the VOBrI monolayer, the electronic band gaps are 0.358 eV and 0.833 eV for spin-up (black) and spin-down (red) bands, respectively. Thus, we can predict VOClI and VOBrI monolayers as 2D direct band gap semiconductors with FM ordering.\nTable I shows the electronic band gaps for all the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers. The lowest band gap among the spin-up and spin-down bands should be considered the majority band gap. We observe that heavier halogen atoms lead to the lowering of the electronic band gaps. Also, the VOClBr monolayer has the highest majority band gap of 0.997 eV among the VOXY mono-\n4 Y S X\u0393 (a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFIG. 2. (a) Electronic band structure of the VOFCl monolayer.

Figure S3 in the Supplemental Material[] and band gap data from Table I show that VOF2 has an indirect majority band gap, while VOI2 has a direct majority band gap (although of a minimal magnitude of 0.001 eV). Comparing this with the data for other VOXY monolayers in Table I, we can conclude that while I in VOXY structure can lead to a direct band gap, the presence of F results in an indirect band gap.\nFigure 2 (b) illustrates the orbital-resolved density of states (DOS) plot for the VOFCl monolayer. We observe that the V atoms predominantly contribute to valence and conduction states near the Fermi level. On further zooming into the valence states in the DOS, as shown in Figure 2 (b), we observe that there are also minor contributions from the F and Cl atoms to the valence states, and among them, the F atom has a more considerable contribution. Note that no significant contribution from O atoms to the valence states is observed. Figure S4 shows the DOS plots for other VOXY monolayers[]. The predominance of V atom in near Fermi level valence and conduction states with minor contributions from halogen atoms in the valence states remains consistent for all VOXY monolayers. In the case of VOFBr and VOFI monolayers, similar to VOFCl, F atoms have a more significant contribution compared to Br and I atoms, respectively. While in the case of VOClI and VOBrI monolayers, I atoms have a more considerable contribution than Cl and Br atoms, respectively. For the VOClBr monolayer, both Cl and Br atoms show a similar contribu-\ntion to the valence state with a little higher from the Cl atoms. Combining the results from these DOS plots and the comparison we have done of the properties of VOXY monolayers with VOX2 monolayers, we can conclude that the halogen atom with the higher contribution in the near Fermi level valence state can significantly affect the electronic and magnetic properties of the VOXY monolayers. For example, the VOFI monolayer has an indirect band gap just like the VOF2 monolayer instead of a direct band gap like the VOI2 monolayer since the valence state in the VOFI monolayer has a higher contribution from F atoms rather than I atoms. Similarly, the FM nature of the VOFCl and VOFBr monolayers could be attributed to the higher contribution of the F atoms in the valence states than other halogen atoms in those monolayers. In the case of VOClI and VOBrI monolayers, we can also correlate the direct band gap observed in these monolayers to the higher I atom contribution in the valence states.\nIn our previous work[49], we observed that we could tune the ground-state magnetic ordering and the ferroelectric polarization due to the change in the V ion\u2019s polar displacement of the VOCl2 monolayer using strainengineering. A similar effect of strain-engineering on the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of the VOF2 monolayer is also reported.[51] Since Janus monolayers exhibit properties similar to their parent monolayers, we applied biaxial strain on the VOFCl monolayer to determine the effect of strain-engineering on the energies of different magnetic orderings and the V ion\u2019s polar displacement in the VOFCl monolayer, as shown in Figure 2 (c) and (d), respectively. We observe a change in the lowest energy magnetic ordering from FM to AFM1 at around 2% compressive strain. Also, with increasing tensile strain, the FM ordering becomes more stable compared to AFM1 and AFM3 since their energy differences increase. Similar results have also been observed for VOF2 monolayer[51] and for VOCl2 monolayer[49], where the ground state magnetic ordering change from AFM3 to FM on applying tensile strain. The V ion\u2019s polar displacement increases with the increase in tensile strain, and vice versa decreases for compressive strain in the VOFCl monolayer, with similar polar displacement values for different magnetic orderings. VOCl2 also shows a similar trend for change in the polar displacement with strain for different magnetic orderings, as reported in our previous work[49].\nContinuing with our comparative analysis of the properties of VOXY and VOX2 monolayers, we revisited the band structure of the VOFCl monolayer and compared it with the electronic band structure of the VOF2 monolayer and VOCl2 monolayer, with FM ordering. Figure 3 (a) shows the near Fermi level band structure for VOFCl, VOF2, and VOCl2 (FM). We can observe that band structures of both VOFCl and VOF2 show similar characteristics with certain distinctive differences, other than the electronic band gap, in both the conduction and valence bands. Figure 3 (b) shows the enhanced plots for the conduction bands of VOFCl, VOF2, and VOCl2\n5 Y S X\u0393 (a)\n(b)\n(c)\nVOFCl VOF2 VOCl2 (FM)\nFIG. 3. Comparison of the (a) electronic band structure near Fermi level, (b) conduction band, and (c) valence band, for the VOFCl, VOF2, and FM ordered VOCl2 monolayers. Black and red colour bands represent spin-up and spin-down bands, respectively.\n(FM). In the VOF2 conduction band, we observe two degenerate spin-up (black) bands along the \u0393-Y direction and two degenerate spin-down (red) bands at the \u0393 point. In the case of the VOFCl monolayer\u2019s conduction band, such degeneracies are observed to be lifted. For the VOCl2 (FM) conduction band, similar to VOFCl, we observe four non-degenerate spin-up (black) bands along the \u0393-Y direction but a four-fold degeneracy at the Y point. Figure 3 (c) shows the enhanced version of the valence band of VOFCl, VOF2, and VOCl2 (FM) monolayers. Both VOFCl and VOF2 have similar bands for the valence states with higher bandwidth in the case of the VOFCl monolayer, which can be attributed to the Cl atoms since the VOCl2 (FM) monolayer also has large bandwidth for the valence band.\nThen the magnetic exchange coupling parameters are calculated for nearest-neighbor (NN) V ions along the a and b axes represented by Ja and Jb, respectively, and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) V ions represented by Jab, as shown in Figure 1(b). Using the Ising model Hamiltonian presented in our previous work[49], we can write following energy equations for different magnetic orderings -:\nEFM = E0 \u2212 4M2FM (Ja + Jb + 2Jab), (1) EAFM1 = E0 \u2212 4M2AFM1(Ja \u2212 Jb \u2212 2Jab), (2) EAFM2 = E0 \u2212 4M2AFM2(\u2212Ja + Jb \u2212 2Jab), (3) EAFM3 = E0 \u2212 4M2AFM3(\u2212Ja \u2212 Jb + 2Jab). (4)\nHere E0 is the non-magnetic part of the energy, and MMO (where MO=FM, AFM1, AFM2, AFM3) is the magnetic moment for different magnetic orderings. Using the energy values for different magnetic orderings (provided in Table I) in the above equations, we can extract the values for exchange parameters, Ja, Jb, and Jab, for all the\nVOXY and VOX2 monolayers. The calculated exchange parameters are then used to provide an estimate for the transition temperature within the mean-field approximation[74] using the formula below-:\nT = M2\nkB |2Ja + 2Jb + 4Jab| (5)\nHere, kB is the Boltzman constant, and M is the magnitude of the V ion\u2019s magnetic moment for the ground-state spin-order.\nThe calculated values for exchange parameters and the transition temperatures (TC and TN ) for VOXY and VOX2 monolayers are provided in Table II. Note that the negative (positive) exchange parameter suggests antiparallel (parallel) ordering between the coupled pair, and the values of exchange parameters affect the magnetic ordering as per the equations discussed earlier. Thus, for VOXY and VOX2 monolayers with all exchange parameters positive, V ion spins are parallelly ordered to each other, resulting in an FM ground state order. For VOBrI, although Jb is negative, it is closer to zero and has a much lower value than other positive exchange parameters resulting in FM order. For VOClBr, VOCl2 and VOBr2, the high negative value for Jb results in antiparallel spin-ordering along the b-axis, and the Ja value is smaller than the twice of the Jab value resulting parallel ordering along the direction of Jab coupling resulting in AFM3 order.\nBy comparing the TC (Curie Temperature) values for FM monolayers, we found that for the monolayers with larger radii I atom, the TC value decreases with the increase in the radii of the other halogen atom. On the other hand, for the FM monolayers with F atoms, adding a larger radii halogen increases the TC value resulting in a higher TC value for VOFBr compared to VOFCl, which is larger than that for VOF2 as well. For AFM3 monolayers, larger halogen radii reduce TN (Neel Temperature) values, resulting in lower TN value for VOClBr than VOCl2. Although the calculated transition temperature (TC and TN ) values are expected to be overestimated, comparing the values gives a qualitative understanding of magnetism in the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers in the case of a collinear magnetic ground state\nMagnetic anisotropy is an essential requirement for stabilizing long-range magnetic ordering in the 2D materials by lifting the restrictions imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theory[75, 76]. To determine the stability of the magnetic orderings in the VOXY monolayers, we calculated the magnetic anisotropy energies (MAEs) by considering the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) approximation. The values for MAEs for all the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers are given in Table III. For MAE calculations, we considered magnetization along the [100], [010], [001], [110], and [111] directions. We observe that VOFCl, VOBrI, VOF2, and VOI2 monolayers have a magnetic easy axis along the [010] direction or the b-axis, which is in-plane but perpendicular to the polar axis, a-axis. On the other hand,\n6 for VOFI and VOClI monolayers, the easy axis is along the polar a-axis, [100] direction. For VOClBr, VOFBr, VOCl2, and VOBr2 monolayers, the magnetic easy axis points out-of-plane along the c-axis, [001] direction.\nIn some recent studies[50, 52], a spiral spin texture has been reported as the ground state for VOI2 monolayer instead of a collinear FM ordering. This distortion of FM spin texture of VOI2 monolayer to a non-collinear ground-state has been pointed out as the result of the strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)[77, 78]. Although DMI is directly associated with the polar distortion in the VOX2 monolayers, it was revealed that the presence of heavy element I, which provides a strong spin-orbit coupling(SOC), results in an effective DMI in the polar structure that can lead to the distortion of collinear FM ordering to a short-period spiral structure. On the other hand, VOF2 has been reported to have a collinear FM ground state since it shows weak magnetoelectric anisotropy and DMI in the absence of any heavy element with a strong SOC like iodine[51]. For FM VOXY monolayers, we can compare the MAE values with those of VOF2 and VOI2 monolayers from Table III and observe that VOFCl shows smaller values compared to even VOF2 monolayer, while VOFBr, VOFI, VOClI, and VOBrI shows MAE values much larger than the ones for VOF2 but still smaller than those for VOI2 monolayer. Although properly commenting on the actual magnetic ground states for these VOXY monolayers even within DFT approximation requires some advanced calculations, from our results and conclusions of previous studies, we can predict that VOFCl has an excellent possibility of having a collinear FM ground state. In addition, VOFCl is expected to have a higher TC value for collinear FM ordering than VOF2 monolayer, as shown in Table II, making it a desirable candidate for further exploration for a 2D collinear ferromagnet.\nNext, we analyze the in-plane ferroelectric properties and the out-of-plane polarization in the VOXY monolayers. Figure 4 (a) shows the energy versus in-plane polarization for the VOFCl monolayer, which looks like a double-well potential curve, a characteristic feature of ferroelectrics with switchable spontaneous electric polarization. VOFCl has a spontaneous in-plane ferroelectric polarization (PS) of 3.03 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m with an energy barrier (EG) of 292.11 meV/f.u.(formula unit) for polarization switching via a high-symmetry paraelectric phase. Previous work on VOCl2 monolayer revealed a polarization switching pathway via an antiferroelectric (AFE) phase as the pathway with the lowest energy barrier according to the climbing image nudged elastic band calculations[47]. Figure 4 (b) shows a similar in-plane ferroelectric polarization switching pathway via the AFE phase for the VOFCl monolayer. The energy barrier for polarization switching via the FE-AFE-FE pathway is defined by \u2206E, as shown in Figure 4 (b), which is equal to 150.22 meV/f.u. for VOFCl, smaller than that of EG. Note that the AFE phase in Figure 4 (b) has lower energy than the VOFCl monolayer\u2019s FE phase. Figure 4\nEG\nPS\n(a)\n(b)\nE\n-PS +PS\nAFEFE FE\n(c) shows the variation of in-plane polarization with the displacement of V ion along the polar axis (a-axis). We can observe that the in-plane polarization switches direction from being along the negative a-axis to the positive a-axis with the V ion\u2019s displacement from its centrosymmetric position to along the positive and negative a-axis, respectively. Figure 4 (d) shows the variation of out-ofplane polarization with the V ion\u2019s displacement along the a-axis. Although the V ion\u2019s displacement affects the magnitude of out-of-plane polarization in such a way that it forms a double-well curve, the polarization does not change its direction, which was expected.\nTable IV provides the values for spontaneous in-plane ferroelectric polarization (PS), the energy barriers for polarization switching (EG and \u2206E), and the energy difference between FE and AFE phase, and the out-ofplane polarization for the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers. Among the VOXY monolayers, VOFCl and VOBrI show the highest and the lowest in-plane ferroelectric polarization of 3.03 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m and 2.37 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m, respectively. From the obtained data for PS , we can conclude that the heavier halogen atoms lead to a decrease in PS values in the VOXY monolayers, which is supported by the results for VOX2 monolayers where VOF2 with lighter F has highest PS value of 3.31 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m while VOI2 with heavier I has the lowest PS value of 2.13 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m. The energy barriers, EG and \u2206E, follow a similar trend as the PS values with the highest EG and \u2206E values of 292.11 meV/f.u. and 150.22 meV/f.u., respectively, for VOFCl monolayer, and lowest EG and \u2206E values of 145.51 meV/f.u. and 71.12\n7 meV/f.u., respectively, for VOBrI monolayer, among the VOXY monolayers. This direct relation between ferroelectric polarization and polarization switching energy barrier is expected, in general, for ferroelectric materials. We can observe that \u2206E values are always smaller than the EG values for all the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers, and thus we can conclude that the FE-AFE-FE pathway, shown in Figure 4 (b), is the minimum energy pathway for in-plane ferroelectric polarization switching.\nFrom Table IV, we can also observe that VOFCl, VOFBr, VOF2, and VOI2 monolayers have lower energy for the AFE phase, which suggests an AFE ground state for these monolayers. Note that for Figure 4 (b) and for the values outside the brackets in the FE\u2212AFE column of Table IV, the AFE phase has the same lattice parameters as the FE phase. On allowing lattice parameter optimization of the AFE phase, the stability of the AFE phase to the FE phase increases, as can be seen from the values provided in the brackets in the FE\u2212AFE column. Although AFE phase has lower energy compared to FE phase in these monolayers, large energy barriers \u2206E between FE and AFE phases, which are larger than the room temperature thermal energy of 25 meV, ensure stability of the FE phase. In the end, we also calculated the out-of-plane polarization for the VOXY monolayers and obtained non-zero polarization for all the monolayers with the highest value of 0.11 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m for the VOFI monolayer, which has highest electronegativity difference between the halogens.\nOne of the exciting properties that Janus monolayers show is the out-of-plane piezoelectric effect[11]. To complete our analysis for the Janus VOXY monolayers, we calculated the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients for VOXY monolayers and compared their values with those for VOX2 monolayers. The piezoelectric coefficient (eij) is defined as \u2202Pi\u2202 j which provides the electromechanical coupling between strain and electrical polarization in terms of change in polarization (\u2202Pi) in the i th direction by strain (\u2202 j) in the j th direction. Figure 5 shows the curve for change in the in-plane and out-ofplane polarization with uniaxial strain along a-axis and b-axis for the VOFCl monolayer. To determine the piezoelectric coefficients, we did a linear fit, using the linear regression method as done in MATLAB, for the data of the magnitude of change in polarization with strain from -1.5% to 1.5% in steps of 0.3. The slopes of the obtained linear curves provide the piezoelectric coefficients, as given in Figure 5. For VOXY monolayers other than VOFCl, the plots for determining the piezoelectric coefficients are given in Figures S5-S9 in the Supplemental Material[].\nTable V contains the calculated values of the piezoelectric coefficients for all the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers. The R2 value provides information about the goodness of our linear fit, where a high value of R2 is considered a better fit with R2 equal to 1 as the exact fit. For the VOFCl monolayer and other VOXY monolayers, the R2 values are provided at the bottom of the plots in Figure\n(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 5. Change in the electric polarization for strain (a) along the a-axis and (b) along the b-axis for the VOFCl monolayer. The slope of the linear fit to the curve provides the monolayer\u2019s in-plane (e11 and e12) and out-of-plane (e31 and e32) piezoelectric coefficients. The R-squared values for the linear fit for both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric polarization are provided in the bottom-right and bottom-left corners in (a) and (b), respectively.\n5 and the Figures S5-S9 in the Supplemental Material[], respectively. In Table V, we have provided the piezoelectric coefficient values for only those plots with a R2 value of at least 0.9 and have considered only those values in our analysis.\nAmong the VOXY monolayers, VOBrI and VOClBr have the highest and lowest values for e11 of 13.97 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m and 11.46 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m, respectively. The e11 value for VOFCl is 11.56 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m, close to that of VOClBr. In the case of e12 piezoelectric coefficient, VOFCl and VOBrI have the highest and lowest values of -3.32 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m and -2.54 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m, respectively. VOFCl, VOFBr, and VOFI show significant values for both out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, e31 and e32, while VOClI only has a significant value for e31 coefficient. The values for e31 coefficient are -0.16, -0.24, - 0.42, and -0.19 in units of 10\u221210 C/m for VOFCl, VOFBr,\n8 VOFI, and VOClI monolayers, respectively. On the other hand, the values for the e32 coefficient are -0.19, -0.25, and -0.25 in units of 10\u221210 C/m for VOFCl, VOFBr, and VOFI monolayers, respectively. Note that the negative sign for piezoelectric coefficients means the reduction of polarization with the applied strain. Smaller values for e12 than e11 suggest stronger control of ferroelectric polarization via strain engineering along the polar axis, which has also been explored in our previous work on VOCl2 monolayer[49].\nThe e11 values for the VOXY monolayers are an order of magnitude larger than that for both the measured[79] (2.9\u00d7 10\u221210 C/m) and calculated[80](3.64\u00d7 10\u221210 C/m) values for MoS2 monolayer, which is a well known 2D piezoelectric material. Although the e12 coefficients are much smaller than that for e11 coefficients for the VOXY monolayers, they are still comparable to the e11 coefficient for the MoS2 monolayer and higher than the e11 values calculated for other 2D materials like h-BN[80](1.38 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m) and group-III monochalcogenides[81]. The giant piezoelectric coefficient e11 values for the VOXY monolayers are comparable to that for the groupIV monochalcogenide monolayers[82], that also show the similar anisotropic in-plane piezoelectric effect as shown by VOXY monolayers. The out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, e31 and e32, are of the same magnitude as that of ferromagnetic Janus VSSe monolayer[27] (0.948 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m) and comparable to that for Janus group-III chalcogenide monolayers[26], which have values ranging from 0.08 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m to 0.30 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m.\nWe also calculated the piezoelectric coefficients for VOX2 monolayers, as shown in Table V. Like VOXY monolayers, VOX2 monolayers also have an asymmetric piezoelectric effect with giant values for e11 and smaller values with a negative sign for e12 piezoelectric coefficients. For VOCl2, VOBr2, and VOI2 monolayers, the e11 coefficients are 11.12, 11.92, and 16.90, respectively, in the unit of 10\u221210 C/m, indicating an increase in the piezoelectric effect for strain along a-axis with heavier halogen (or larger halogen radii). VOF2 stands as an outlier to the observed trend with e11 coefficient value of 12.04 \u00d7 10\u221210 C/m, which is larger than that for VOCl2 and VOBr2 monolayers. VOI2 monolayer has the highest value for e11 piezoelectric coefficients compared to all the VOX2 monolayers and all the VOXY monolayers as well. The trend observed in VOX2 monolayers for the increase of piezoelectric effect for strain along a-axis with heavier halogen (or larger halogen radii) could explain the trend of e11 values in VOXY monolayers, except for some out-\nliers like higher e11 values for VOFCl and VOFBr compared to VOClBr, or the higher e11 value for VOFI compared to VOClI, that can be explained as a result of VOF2 being an outlier to this trend. The e12 coefficient values for VOF2, VOCl2, VOBr2, VOI2 monolayers are -3.91, -2.95, -2.70, and -2.77, respectively, in the unit of 10\u221210 C/m, suggesting a decrease in the piezoelectric effect for strain along b-axis with heavier halogen (or larger halogen radii). A similar trend of lower e12 values with heavier halogen (or larger halogen radii) is also observed in the VOXY monolayers, leading to the highest e12 value for the VOF2 monolayer among all the VOXY and VOX2 monolayers."

            "text": "In summary, we have predicted a new series of 2D Janus multiferroic materials with promising applications in future nanotechnologies, which requires multifunctional materials for multipurpose nanodevices. Our strategic comparison of the properties of the Janus VOXY monolayers with their parent VOX2 monolayers provided better insight into the trend observed in those properties. Here, we would like to emphasize our findings for the VOFCl monolayer, which predicts it to possess collinear ferromagnetism with in-plane ferroelectricity and both in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectricity. Since experimental data are available for the bulk VOCl2, we encourage experimental studies to exfoliate and obtain VOCl2 monolayer and create a Janus VOFCl monolayer by replacing Cl with F atoms using CVD, a process that we expect thermodynamically more favourable because of higher electronegativity of F compared to Cl. If experimentally realized, multifunctional materials like VOFCl and other Janus VOXY monolayers could accelerate the development of energy-conserving and wastereducing nanoelectronics and nanosensors. Meanwhile, we also encourage more theoretical studies on these predicted Janus multiferroic VOXY monolayers to enhance our understanding of these systems."
