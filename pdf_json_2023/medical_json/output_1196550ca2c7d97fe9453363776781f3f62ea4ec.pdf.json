    "abstractText": "Background AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Proximal humerus fr ctur s (PHFs) are common fractures, especially in older female patients. These fractures are commonly treated surgically, but the consensus on the best treatment is still lacking. Methods and findings The primary aim of this multicenter, randomized 3-arm superiority, open-label trial was to assess the results of nonoperative treatment and operative treatment either with locking plate (LP) or hemiarthroplasty (HA) of 3and 4-part PHF with the primary outcome of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) at 2-year follow-up. Between February 2011 and December 2019, 160 patients 60 years and older with 3and 4-part PHFs were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 fashion in block size of 10 to undergo nonoperative treatment (control) or operative intervention with LP or HA. In total, 54 patients were assigned to the nonoperative group, 52 to the LP group, and 54 to the HA group. Five patients assigned to the LP group were reassigned to the HA group perioperatively due to PLOS MEDICINE PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308 November 28, 2023 1 / 18 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

Recently, several studies have reported a significant increase in the surgical treatment of the PHF, mainly due to the introduction of locking plates (LPs) suitable for treating osteoporotic bone.\n\u2022 In this study, we investigated whether surgery with an LP or hemiarthroplasty (HA) is\nsuperior to nonoperative treatment with a collar-cuff and early physiotherapy in the treatment of 3- or 4-part PHF involving the surgical neck.\nWhat did the researchers do and find?\n\u2022 We randomly allocated 160 patients to either nonoperative treatment orAU : Pleasecheckandconfirmthattheeditsto}Werandomlyallocated160patientstoeithernonoperativetreatmentor:::}didnotaltertheintendedmeaningofthesentence:operative treatment with HA or LP.\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308 November 28, 2023 2 / 18\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nAbbreviations: AE, AU : Anabbreviationlisthasbeencompiledforthoseusedthroughoutthetext:Pleaseverifythatallentriesarecorrectlyabbreviated:adverse event; AVN, avascular necrosis; CI, confidence interval; CS, Constant\u2013 Murley Score; CT, computed tomography; DASH, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand; EQ-5D, EuroQol Group\u2019s 5-dimension self-reported questionnaire; HA, hemiarthroplasty; ISF, investigator site file; ITT, intention-to-treat; LP, locking plate; MCID, minimal clinically important difference; NITEP, Nordic Innovative Trial to Evaluate Osteoporotic Fractures; OSS, Oxford Shoulder Score; PHF, proximal humerus fracture; PI, principal investigator; PROM, patient-reported outcome measure; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RSA, reverse shoulder arthroplasty; SAE, serious adverse event; SD, standard deviation; SE, standard error; VAS, visual analog scale.\n\u2022 We recorded the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, other mea-\nsures of shoulder function and quality of life, and complications at 2-year follow-up.\n\u2022 We found no significant or clinically important between-group differences in any of the\noutcomes.\nWhat do these findings mean?\n\u2022 This trial provides no evidence that surgery is superior to nonoperative treatment in the\ntreatment of displaced 3- or 4-part PHF involving the surgical neck in older adults.\n\u2022 These results suggest that the current practice of performing surgery on the majority of\ndisplaced 3- or 4-part proximal fractures of the humerus in older adults may not be beneficial.\n\u2022 The limitation is the trial was ended before intended group sizes."

            "text": "Proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) are one of the main fractures in the upper extremities sustained by older female patients [1]. According to a Swedish registry study, the incidence of PHF is 175 per 100,000 person-years in adult females [2]. At 48 months after fracture, mortality reaches a peak of up to 24%, which is similar to hip fracture rates, indicating the frailty of patients with PHF [3\u20136]. Over the past decades, our understanding of the nature of the fracture has changed, and treatment has subsequently evolved. Previously, these fractures were considered to be osteoporotic, and, therefore, research focused solely on the fracture and its morphology [7\u201311]. However, while trying to find a suitable treatment, the features of frail patients were not always considered.\nTo date, several attempts have been made to describe the fracture using various current and\nupdated classifications. However, none of these have shown acceptable potential for clinical decision-making, not to mention acceptable reproducibility [12\u201316]. Moreover, none of the current classification systems can help in deciding on the best treatment for an individual patient. In addition, several studies have reported interobserver variability to be poor at best [17,18]. The introduction of anatomical locking plates (LPs) in the 2000s led to anticipation that restorating the anatomy would improve clinical results. However, subsequent trials showed that LP did not render better clinical results in the older adult population [7,10,19]. Hemiarthroplasty (HA) also became popular, but its use revealed shortcomings, especially tubercle resorption [20], and it was not better than nonoperative treatment [8,9]. In previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HA and nonoperative treatment, no superiority of operative treatment could be detected [8,9]. Therefore, a wider understanding of the effects of operative treatments is needed, and the present study aims to fill this knowledge gap with this, to our knowledge, novel 3-arm trial setting.\nIn a recent Cochrane review, insufficient evidence was found to support the use of any of\nthe operative methods in the treatment of 3- and 4-part PHF [21]. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no previous 3-arm RCT has compared nonoperative treatment with HA and LP in the same setting. The primary aim of this current international multicenter, randomized control trial was to assess the results of the nonoperative treatment of 3- and 4-part PHF\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308 November 28, 2023 3 / 18\ncompared to operative treatment with either LP or HA with the primary outcome of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) [22]."

The DASH is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), which measures self-reported disability and symptoms with 36 questions regarding different daily tasks [22]. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, with the lower end of the scale describing better outcomes. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for DASH is determined to be between 10 and 15 points, but our predefined value for clinical importance was set at 10 points [22]. At the time, there was no fracture specific MCID available for DASH. A variety of secondary outcomes were selected in order to help the future meta-analysis and in a result generalizability. As secondary outcomes, we assessed the DASH at 3, 6, and 12 months. Additionally, we used the shoulder specific Constant\u2013Murley Score (CS) [26], the visual analog scale for pain (VAS; 0 to 100 millimeters) [27], the quality-of-life EuroQol Group\u2019s 5-dimension self-reported questionnaire EQ-5D(-3L) [28], another quality-of-life questionnaire 15D [28], and the shoulder-specific Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) [29]. During the follow-up visits, complications and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Complications were defined as clinical (infections) or radiological (hardware related, nonunions). AEs were defined as unexpected medical events related to the initial treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were complications requiring further inpatient care.\nThe patient data acquired were stored in paper portfolios from where they were extracted\nafter the final patient\u2019s 2-year follow-up was completed in December 2021. The portfolios contained the patients\u2019 baseline characteristics, questionnaires, and case report files in which the allocation, collected radiographs, crossovers, complications, AEs, and SAEs were recorded.\nIn order to avoid the wide interobserver variation reported with the CS, we arranged pretraining sessions for the assessors to standardize the measurements [30].

Our pretrial assumption was that the operative treatment arms (LP and HA) would gain an average improvement of 10 points of difference compared to nonoperative treatment (arms 1:1:1), and we used ANOVA (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8). We assumed a common SD of 18 points and a between-group variance as 25 points. That would have led to an estimated sample size of 66 patients per group, making a total of 198 patients, including an estimated 10% dropout rate. We conducted a preinterim analysis and found no significant differences between the groups. The nonoperative treatment became more common during the study period in the Nordic countries, and in the cases needed, the reverse prosthesis was used. These factors led to a higher-than-expected exclusion rate toward the end of the trial, followed by a premature termination of the trial.\nThe baseline characteristics were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The primary analysis\nwas carried out with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after all patients had completed the 2-year follow-up after initial treatment.\nThe difference between groups was estimated using a linear mixed model allowing for\nrepeated measures. Study group and time of assessment (baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24 months) were included as fixed factors, patients as random factors. The model included interactions between study group and time of assessment. The model was used to estimate the treatment effect as the absolute difference between the groups in DASH score (mean and 95% CIs) and p-value at 24 months. Due to the sample size, we used the Satterthwaite method to estimate degrees of freedom [31]. A similar model was used to analyze secondary outcomes where applicable (EQ5D, 15D, and CS score). For categorical response variables, chi-squared test was used to compare study groups. Because of the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, findings for analyses of secondary end points should be interpreted as exploratory. The mixed model allows for missing data. Thus, no data were imputed. We used full analysis population, meaning that all patients having at least 1 posttreatment measurement were included in the analysis.\nContinuous outcomes were compared using the Student t test. The homogeneity of variance was tested using Levene\u2019s test meeting the assumption of the Student t test. Due to the found skewness of the PROMs, we used Mann\u2013Whitney U test to compare the ranks between the groups (against the original plan). All appropriate tests were 2-sided. The analyses were carried out in accordance with a prespecified statistical plan in an intention-to-treat (ITT) manner; the data were analyzed by a randomized group using R software version 4.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

            "text": "This multicenter, assessor-blinded, randomized trial involving adult patients aged 60 years and older with 3- and 4-part PHF revealed that operative treatment with LP or HA was not superior to nonoperative treatment with regard to the primary outcome, DASH, assessed at 24-month follow-up. Moreover, the nonoperative group had significantly fewer complications and AEs leading to reoperations. Although all groups showed significant improvement in primary outcome until 12 months, there was no further improvement at 24 months, which is in contrast to the findings of previous smaller trials [7\u20139,19].\nIn this study, we found no between-group differences based on the confidence intervals in\nany of the used outcome measures, including our primary outcome DASH and secondary outcomes CS, OSS, EQ-5D, 15D, VAS, or mortality.\nAfter completing our previous and present PHF studies, combined with the recent\nCochrane review, we can acknowledge that the operative treatment of PHF does not provide\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308.g002\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308 November 28, 2023 9 / 18\nadded benefits in outcomes compared to nonoperative treatment [21,24,32]. Instead, operative treatment enhances morbidity, increasing complications, AEs, and SAEs.\nWe detected a high rate of complications of up to 45% in the LP group. However, our complication rates were mainly higher than those reported in the current literature, where rates of up to 29% have been reported [7\u201310,19,33]. In contrast, in our study, the reoperation rates in the LP group were lower than those reported in a previous study [7]. The tubercle resorption rate of 32% in the HA group was at the same level as previously reported [20]. As there is a high risk for complications and reoperations with LPs, they should not be used with the older adult population. For this reason, and in general, patients should be informed about the low complication rates seen in the nonoperative group in this trial before deciding on different treatment options, preferably based on a shared decision-making [34].\nIn all 3 treatment methods, the shoulder function, measured with DASH, CS, or OSS,\nremained clinically worse at 1 and 2 years after the fracture when compared to the prefracture baseline level. Recovery after multipart fracture seems to differ from that of 2-part fractures. Indeed, the results of our previous study showed that patients with 2-part fractures regained the prefracture level of function at 1 year [24].\nInterestingly, the best DASH scores but at the same time the poorest CS scores (not exceeding the MCID) were observed in the HA group. The discrepancy between these 2 contradicting results might be explained by the assumption that patients slowly adapt to the poor postfracture function in their shoulder, as a portion of the raw points in CS is formed from muscle\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308.g003\nPLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004308 November 28, 2023 10 / 18"

We can reasonably assume that the PHF is a result of the diminished functioning of a person\u2019s reserves, which highlights the need to concentrate on rehabilitation and overall coping in the patient\u2019s daily living. Patients must be considered as individuals and not only as patients with a fracture. PHF in older patients shows that we are mostly dealing with frailty patients who represent a high risk for mortality after sustaining the fracture.\nSome limitations in this trial warrant discussion. We ceased recruitment before the predefined power calculation. The results of the preplanned interim analysis after two-thirds of the recruitment was completed revealed no significant differences between treatment alternatives. The trial recruitment period was longer than expected due to a high number of exclusions after assessment of eligibility, since the nonoperative treatment grew more standard in the Nordic countries during the trial. A strength of the study is the multinational, multicenter nature of this NITEP group collaboration, which gives the results high external validity.\nIt must be acknowledged that in the study, we only investigated nonoperative, HA, and LP\ntreatment options for 3- and 4-part PHF. These were, however, the most relevant treatment options at the start of the trial. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has emerged as a treatment option but was not included in the present study. Furthermore, the number of RSA operations was not screened during the trial. Nevertheless, the NITEP group has already initiated a trial to investigate the outcomes of RSA in comparison to nonoperative treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03531463).\nThe main conclusion of the present trial is that no benefit was observed between operative\ntreatment with LP or HA and nonoperative treatment in displaced 3- and 4-part PHFs in patients aged 60 years and older. When compared to the prefracture level, functional outcomes still remain at a lower level 1 and 2 years after the fracture. In addition, we observed a high rate of complications related to operative treatments. Further studies should focus on nonoperative methods of treatment, for example, the rehabilitation of these frail patients."
