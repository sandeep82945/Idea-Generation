However, the significant functions of mitochondrial genes related to oxidative stress (MTGs-OS) in pancreatic cancer (PC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) are yet to be investigated integrally. Therefore, in pan-cancer, particularly PC and PNET, a thorough assessment of the MTGs-OS is required.\nMethods: Expression patterns, prognostic significance, mutation data, methylation rates, and pathway-regulation interactions were studied to comprehensively elucidate the involvement of MTGs-OS in pan-cancer. Next, we separated the 930 PC and 226 PNET patients into 3 clusters according to MTGs-OS expression and MTGs-OS scores. LASSO regression analysis was utilized to construct a novel prognostic model for PC. qRT-PCR(Quantitative real-time PCR) experiments were performed to verify the expression levels of model genes.\nResults: The subtype associated with the poorest prognosis and lowerest MTGsOS scores was Cluster 3, which could demonstrate the vital function of MTGs-OS for the pathophysiological processes of PC. The three clusters displayed distinct variations in the expression of conventional cancer-associated genes and the\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\ninfiltration of immune cells. Similar molecular heterogeneity was observed in patients with PNET. PNET patients with S1 and S2 subtypes also showed distinct MTGs-OS scores. Given the important function of MTGs-OS in PC, a novel and robust MTGs-related prognostic signature (MTGs-RPS) was established and identified for predicting clinical outcomes for PC accurately. Patients with PC were separated into the training, internal validation, and external validation datasets at random; the expression profile of MTGs-OS was used to classify patients into high-risk (poor prognosis) or low-risk (good prognosis) categories. The variations in the tumor immune microenvironment may account for the better prognoses observed in high-risk individuals relative to low-risk ones.\nConclusions: Overall, our study for the first time identified and validated eleven MTGs-OS remarkably linked to the progression of PC and PNET, and elaborated the biological function and prognostic value of MTGs-OS. Most importantly, we established a novel protocol for the prognostic evaluation and individualized treatment for patients with PC.\nKEYWORDS\npancreatic cancer, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, molecular heterogeneity, precision medicine, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor"

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most prevalent types of malignancies that may develop in the digestive system and is the major contributor to cancer-associated deaths globally. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) is a heterogeneous tumor originating from neuroendocrine system pluripotent stem cells. In the last 25 years, the cases of PC have increased by more than doubled (1). At this time, the incorporation of major surgery during the early stages of the disease is the most successful therapy for people who have PC and PNET. Over 80% of patients could not be identified at an early phase since there was a lacking of prominent early diagnostic signs and biological markers. During diagnosis, the majority of patients with PC are already in the terminal phase with distant metastases, which results in a loss of ideal prospects for surgery (2, 3). Furthermore, postoperatively, around 80% of individuals with PC often develop metastasis and experience disease recurrence (4). Notwithstanding the significant advancements in treatment methods, people diagnosed with PC continue to have a dismal prognosis worldwide (5). Hence, chemotherapy sensitivity for PC is still a challenge that has to be overcome. It is urgent warrant to establish an innovative and precise model for prognosis prediction in PC and PNET individuals.\nMitochondria acted as metabolic hubs at the cellular and tissue level, which were significant both for cellular energy production and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) formation (6). Mitochondrial dysfunction (MDF) could produce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which performs an instrumental function in diabetes mellitus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and hydrocephaly (6, 7). The mtROS could activate signaling cascades that modify the expression of genes and influence cell\n02\nactivation, proliferation, and differentiation (8). Oxidative stress (OS) is an imbalance between the production of ROS/RNS and antioxidant protection effect, which is considered to be involved in varieties of disorders including DNA damage and repair (DDR) related diseases and neoplasm (9). Notably, the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the primary contributor to intracellular ROS and performs a fundamental function in modulating cellular redox homeostasis (10). Therefore, MDF could disrupt the normal functional activities of cells by increasing intracellular ROS (11). An overabundance of ROS will promote the oxidation of protein DNA and lipid macromolecules, resulting in genomic instability and further promoting transformation. Consequently, elevating ROS might promote the occurrence of tumors. Nevertheless, some research reports suggest increasing oxidative damage and enhancing ROS-dependent death signals might also be effective in preventing certain steps of tumorigenesis (12\u201314). Although oxidative stress-mediated alterations in mitochondria contribute significantly to tumorigenesis, their causative relationship is still up for debate (14). In addition, research has shown the molecular features of mitochondrial genes related to oxidative stress (MTGsOS) and reported their predictive function in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (15). Based on the above analysis, we included MTGsOS in this research. Moreover, no correlation between MTGs-OS and clinical outcomes or chemotherapy response has been reported in PC. Hence, the research exploring the expression patterns of MTGs-OS and constructing MTGs-OS molecular subtypes is promising.\nIn the study, PC patients\u2019 prognoses were closely correlated with 56 MTGs-OS that were confirmed to be substantially upregulated in the disease. Next, we conducted a thorough analysis of the MTGsOS expression profiles and genetic alterations across various\nfrontiersin.org\ncancers. We grouped PC and PNET patients into three clusters as per MTGs-OS scores and MTGs-OS expression and evaluated the correlations between these clusters and prognosis, immune microenvironments, and drug sensitivities. Furthermore, we developed and extensively validated a new and independent prognostic model using MTGs-OS. The approach has the potential to shed light on the mechanisms behind PC and PNET, leading to more targeted therapy and better clinical results for PC and PNET patients."

In this analysis, only PC patients who had full follow-up data were included. Data from RNA seq (values expressed as FPKM) were translated into TPM for the TCGA-PC cohort to make them more similar to microarray results. To avoid the batch effect, we use the ComBat function in the SVA package to correct the data from different platforms (41). Overall, we complied the expression profile and clinical information of 930 PC patients consisting of TCGAPC, GSE62452, GSE28735, GSE57495, ICGC-AU, ICGC-CA, and MTAB-6134 datasets (16\u201319).\nWe also downloaded and complied the transcriptomic data of PNET patients from the following three cohorts: GSE73338, GSE98894, and ICGC-PAEN-AU cohorts (20). Similar de-batch technologies were also employed to correct the data from different platforms. Overall, a total of 226 patients with PNET were obtained for the subsequent analysis.\nSubsequently, 1136 MTGs were obtained from the MitoCarta3.0 database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mitocarta), and using the query \u201coxidative stress,\u201d the GeneCard database (https://www.genecards.org/) provided information on 9512 human genes associated with OS. Finally, 469 MTGs-OS were preserved for further analysis after taking the intersection.\n2.2 Identification and validation of differentially expressed MTGs-OS associated with PC prognosis\nOverall, 178 PC and 171 normal pancreas tissues in the GTEx and TCGA cohorts were obtained for performing differential expression analysis. Subsequently, prognosis-related analysis was conducted on 930 PC samples with complete follow-up records. The \u2018limma\u2019 tool in R was employed to evaluate differentially expressed MTGs-OS between PC and normal pancreas tissues from the GTEx and TCGA cohorts.

First, we downloaded and compiled the raw data and clinical records of pan-cancer cohorts from the XENA website. We systematically studied whether the differentially expressed genes in PC and para-cancerous tissues had similar expression characteristics in other malignant tumors. In addition, we investigated the prognostic performances, mutation traits, and methylation levels of MTGs-OS in a series of human cancers. Finally, the ssGSEA algorithm was utilized to derive the MTGs scores of each cancer patient. The GSEA method was then applied to predict the discrepancies in pathway activities between patients with high- and low- MTGs scores (23)."

A higher MTGs scores means that patients with a subtype of PC have a relatively high-activity MTGs phenotype, whereas a lower MTGs score implies a low-activity MTGs phenotype. Based on the MTGs scores, we then classified 930 patients with pancreatic cancer into three subtypes: MTGs active (cluster 2 or C2), MTGs inactive (cluster 3 or C3), and normal MTGs (cluster 1 or C1). Finally, the clustering outcome and the expression characteristics of each MTGs is shown in the form of a heat map.\nTo highlight the clinical value of MTGs scores, we compared the clinical outcomes and treatment strategies of different subgroups of pancreatic cancer patients. To examine the variation in prognosis among these 3 categories, the \u201csurvival\u201d and \u201csurvminer\u201d R programs were used.

The expression profiles of numerous tumor suppressor genes and\nfrontiersin.org\noncogenes in PC were subjected to comparison across clusters by means of the Kruskal-Wallis test. Furthermore, the enrichment scores of established metabolic and immune-related pathways were derived through ssGSEA, and a similar strategy was applied to characterize the differences in these pathways across three MTGs clusters.\n2.4.3 Association of MTGs scores with immune cell infiltration\nSimilar to the method previously reported in the literature (24), the ssGSEA algorithm was adopted to evaluate the characteristics of the immune microenvironment, including immune cell infiltrations and immune-related functions, in 930 patients with PC. To further investigate the critical modulatory role of MTGs on the immune microenvironment in PC, we assessed the association of each MTG with the aforementioned immune cell infiltrations and immunerelated activities using the Spearman test. We computed the spearman\u2019s correlation value and produced a lollipop map to illustrate our findings on the association of MTGs score with immune cell infiltration in PC from a wider perspective. In addition, we generated a scatter plot with the \u201cggscatterstats\u201d package to display the associations of the five classical immune traits (neutrophils, APC co-inhibition, CCR, T cell co-inhibition, and macrophages) with the MTGs scores.\nMore importantly, a series of immune-prediction algorithms were applied to intensively evaluate the discrepancies in the immune cell infiltration among different subpopulations of PC patients. First , based on the transcriptomic data, the \u201cESTIMATE\u201d package was adopted to evaluate the variations in immunological features across the three PC subtypes (on the basis of the Immune Score, Stromal Score, and ESTIMATE Score) (25). Then, cell immune responses or cellular components were contrasted among the three PC subtypes using the EPIC, MCPCOUNTER, TIMER, XCELL, CIBERSORT-ABS, and CIBERSORT, algorithms (26). We conducted the Kruskal-Wallis test to examine the relative differences in immune checkpoint expression across distinct subtypes of PC, as immune checkpoints perform a fundamental role in the functioning of immune cells.\n2.5 A novel prognostic signature development and verification\n2.5.1 Development and verification of a novel MTGs-related prognostic signature for 930 PC patients\nThe expression of MTGs-OS was used to develop an innovative prognostic signature that was verified to more accurately predict a patient\u2019s chance of survival. Signature cohort 1 comprised 635 patients from the TCGA-PC, MTAB-6134, GSE62452, GSE57495, and GSE28735 datasets, whereas signature cohort 2 comprised 295 patients from the ICGC-CA and ICGC-AU datasets.\nSubsequently, approximately 70% of samples in signature cohort1 were randomly obtained and designated as the train dataset used for developing MTGs-RPS (n=447). The remaining 30% of samples in signature cohort1 were defined as the test1 cohort (n=188). All samples in signature cohort1 were allocated to the test2\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 04\ncohort (n=635) and all samples in the signature cohort2 were allocated to the test3 cohort (n=295).\nTo avoid overfitting and identify feasible factors from the MTGs, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was conducted on the train set. Subsequently, to develop an MTG-RPS, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was established, and the risk scores were estimated with the help of the equation below: risk score = o n\nk=1\nexpk*bk.\nFollowing the completion of the calculations necessary to determine each patient\u2019s individual risk score within the train set, patients were then classified into high-risk and low-risk groups (categories) as per the median risk score. The PC patients in the internal (i.e. test1 and test2) and external (test3) validation datasets were further classified into high- and low-risk categories as per the train cohort-related median risk score.\nThe analyses below were conducted on the train, (i.e. test1 and test2) and external (test3) validation datasets to develop and validate the MTGs-RPS: (1) The \u2018pheatmap\u2019 R program was utilized to produce a heatmap that illustrates the various degrees of expression of the MTGs. (2) A survival study was conducted with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method to ascertain if the MTGs-RPS is useful for forecasting prognosis; (3) We created receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for evaluating the diagnostic capability of the MTGs-RPS based on the area under the curve (AUC)."

As depicted in Figure 3B, we performed a univariate cox regression analysis to determine the MTGs-OS that served as risk\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 06\nfactors (HR>1 and p<0.05) and those with protective function (HR<1 and p<0.05). We discovered that certain MTGs-OS are risk factors in part of malignancies, including UVM, ACC, LIHC, KICH, and LGG; however, similar to the protective function of MTGs-OS in PC, these genes also had protective properties in KIRC, MESO, and KIRP. To investigate the mutational characteristics of the 56 MTGs-OS in tumors, the proportion of CNV was studied, and the outcomes showed that CNV happened at high frequency (nearly within the range of 10 to 60%) in the diverse types of cancer (Figure 3C). Then, we discovered that BLCA, BRCA, COAD, LUAD, SKCM, STAD, and UCEC, all exhibited a higher frequency of SNVs, especially for UCEC; conversely, the SNV frequency in CHOL, ACC, DLBC, UVM, THYM, THCA, TGCT, PCPG, MESO, LAML, and KICH was low, especially for CHOL and UVM. Interestingly, we found that the SNV of ACACB,\nB\nC\nD\nE\nA\nfrontiersin.org\nALDH1L1, and GLDC was in significantly high frequencies than that of the other MTGs-OS, as illustrated by the heatmap and waterfall diagram of SNV (Figures 3D, E). Notably, the methylation of promoters and abnormal DNA methylation might influence gene expression (27). Therefore, we discovered that MTGs-OS had complicated methylation patterns in different types of cancer. As a whole, the changes in methylation levels of MTGs-OS were not significant in most human cancers, including PC, according to the result (Figure 3F). EPHX2, ACSF2, CYP27A1, ACSS1, and ALDH1L1 showed hypermethylation in several types of human cancer; on the contrary, AKR1B10, POLG2, NDUFB8, ACACB, and MRPS22 consistently showed hypomethylation in several types of human cancer.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 07"

The levels of ROS in the TME are critical for regulating the levels of immune cells and their functions in the TME, particularly the activation, expansion, and effector function of T lymphocytes (31, 32). Within the scope of this research, we delved deeper into the link between MTGs-OS and the infiltration levels of immune cells as well as the corresponding immune functions (Figure 6D). The expression of following genes, NDUFA7, NDUFA3, MMAB, MCRIP2, and COQ4, were negatively correlated with immunocyte infiltration and immune-related functions. Conversely, UCP2, ACAT1, CYP27A1, DLAT, FTH1, MPV17, PMAIP1, PPTC7, and GLDC, were positively linked to the infiltration levels of immune cells. Notably, ICGs contributed to anti-tumor immunity by modulating the function of effector T\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 10\nlymphocytes. Therefore, we studied the relationship between ICGs in the 3 clusters (Figure 6E). We discovered that the MTGs-OSinactive cluster was correlated with overexpression of ICGs, illustrating that MTGs-OS-inactive patients had the weakest antitumor immunity and a poor prognosis. Subsequently, we assessed the association of MTGs-OS scores with immune cell infiltration (Figures 6F\u2013K). Most infiltrating immune cells, comprising neutrophils, APC co-inhibition, CCR, T cell co-inhibition, and macrophages, were shown to have a negative link to MTGs-OS scores.

At the same time, we evaluated immune cell responses or cellular components in the three PC subtypes according to the EPIC, MCPCOUNTER, CIBERSORT-ABS, XCELL, CIBERSORT, and TIMER algorithms (Figure 7E). Overall, the cellular immune responses or cellular components were significantly different among three clusters, which suggested that there was a close link between the infiltration status of most immune cells and the MTGs-OS score.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 11\n3.7 Construction and verification of a novel MTGs-RPS for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with PC\nPrevious 56 differentially expressed MTGs-OS with prognostic values were used for conducting the following LASSO-Cox regression analysis. LASSO regression analysis identified 18 candidate molecules and multivariate Cox regression analysis determined 11 hub MTGs-OS (i.e., COQ4, MCRIP2, SOD1, NDUFB8, MRPL50, BIK, MRPL14, RFK, NMNAT3, BNIP3L, MRPS5) for constructing the\nfrontiersin.org\nprognostic model (Supplementary Figures 1A\u2013C). To additionally validate the fundamental function of the selected modeling genes in the onset and progression of PC, we investigated the association of the eleven model genes with PAAD stage and metastasis based on the GEPIA and BEST platforms (Figure 8).\nSubsequently, 11 hub MTGs-OS\u2019s expression levels were verified by RT-PCR in four cell lines (Figure 9). We observed that the mRNA expression trend of the 11 hub MTGs-OS was almost consistent with the results predicted by our bioinformatics analysis. As for BxPC-3 cell line, the expression levels of BIK, COQ4, MRPL14, MRPL50, and NMNAT3 were significantly upregulated. As for CF-PAC1 cell line, the expression level of BIK was significantly up-regulated and the expression level of MRPL50 was significantly down-regulated. As for Panc-1 cell line, there is no significant difference as regards above eleven model genes. As for Mia-Paca-2, the expression levels of BNIP3L and NMNAT3 were significantly up-regulated. Using the HPA database, we searched through immunohistochemical findings of tumor and normal pancreatic tissues to verify the expression pattern of 11 hub MTGs-OS at the protein levels (Figure 10). At the same time, we studied the cellular localization of the 11 MTGs-OS, however, we did not find the information of cellular localization of BIK and MCRIP2 in the HPA database. Therefore, we showed cellular localization of the other 9 MTGs-OS (COQ4, SOD1, NDUFB8, MRPL50, MRPL14, RFK, NMNAT3, BNIP3L, MRPS5) in Figure 10. The expression products of COQ4, MRPS5, MRPL14, NDUFB8, and NMNAT3 were mainly located in the mitochondria. The expression products of RFK, MRPL50, and SOD1 were located Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and cytosol, nucleoplasm and plasma membrane and cytosol, and mitochondria and nuclear speckles, respectively.\nBased on the result above, the evaluation of the prognostic performance of the MTGs-RPS was displayed in Figure 11. PC patients in the train set were classified into two subgroups by KM survival analysis. The high-risk category recorded a lower overall survival time than the low-risk category, which suggested that the MTGs-RPS could precisely differentiate patients with a poor and a favorable prognosis for PC (Figure 11A). As per ROC analysis, we proved the accuracy and robustness of MTGs-RPS as a diagnostic tool. The 5-year survival AUC of the ROC curve AUC was 0.780 (Figure 11E). Furthermore, both internal and external validations of survival data found that PC patients with low-risk scores recorded superior overall survival rates (Figures 11B\u2013D). In addition, when comparing the test1 with the test2 and external validation sets, we discovered that the AUC values of the 5-year ROC curve were 0.658, 0.742, and 0.673, respectively (Figures 11F\u2013H). The results above could suggest the dependability and accuracy of the MTGs-RPS.\nDuring the process of establishing the MTGs-RPS, we classified 447 PC patients into low- and high-risk categories as per the median risk in the train set (Supplementary Figure 2A). As per the distributions of risk scores, the mortality rate was remarkably greater among the high-risk subset of PC patients (Supplementary Figure 2E). The prognostic signature encompassed 11 different MTGs-OS, and their expression patterns were displayed in a heatmap (Supplementary Figure 2I). As we had anticipated, the same technique effectively classified PC patients into low- and high-\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 12\nrisk categories across all three cohorts (test1, test 2, and test 3) (Supplementary Figures 2B\u2013D). Notably, the median risk score functioned as a benchmark in the train dataset when separating the samples in test1, test2, and test3. In the three cohorts, similarities were observed between the risk score distributions and survival status recorded in the train set and those reported in the internal (test1 and test2 cohorts) and the external validation dataset (Supplementary Figures 2F\u2013H). The expression patterns of the MTGs-OS reported by heatmaps in the test1, test2, and test3 cohorts were similar to that in the train cohort (Supplementary Figures 2G\u2013L)."

It is one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of cancer with a five-year survival rate of just 8% in the United States (33). And it is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in China (34). As we all know, the pancreas is the largest endocrine gland in the body. When the hormone-producing pancreatic cells, such as islet A cells and B cells and so on, become cancerous, which could lead to the PNET (35). And the incidence of PNET is increasing in the past decades and account for 3%-7% of pancreatic tumors (35). The MDF can lead to mitochondrial OS producing excessive ROS, which could contribute to base replacement mutations of T/C or G/A in mtDNA. Therefore, the mtDNA mutation is related to the oxidative stress environment caused by the MDF, which is carcinogenesis (36, 37). Additionally, the MDF can lead to an increase in pancreatitis, which can also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer (38\u201340).

Similarly, the functions of hormone-producing pancreatic cells depend on the mitochondria, so the MDF may affect the normal function of pancreatic cells leading to the occurrence of PNET (45, 46). At present, patients with PC has poor prognosis and strong individual heterogeneity. Nevertheless, there is no study investigating the omics of mitochondrial disorders and oxidative stress to identify individual differences in patients with PC and PNET. Consequently, we evaluated the activity of MTGs-OS in each patient based on a series of bioinformatics algorithms, which are beneficial to the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with PC and PNET.\nFirst, we identified 469 differentially expressed MTGs-OS guided by the MitoCarta3.0 and GeneCard database using the traditional method of difference analysis. Notably, key genes in disease pathogenesis often have both variable expression patterns and high clinical relevance. Therefore, we discovered 56 differentially expressed MTGs-OS between PC and normal pancreatic tissues and correlating with PC prognoses. In addition, MTGs-OS were shown to be protective factors against PC. We also illustrated the co-expressed relationship among the 56 MTGs-OS. We discovered that all genes have at least one interaction with each other, with most of these interactions being positively correlated.\nThe expression features, prognostic implications, mutation profiles, methylation patterns, and signaling pathway correlations\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 14\nof MTGs-OS were then investigated in various human tumors using bioinformatics-related methods for the first time. For instance, ALDH1L1 regulates the overall flow of one carbon group in the folate-dependent biosynthetic pathway. Through promoter methylation, it is significantly and frequently down-regulated in malignant tumors (47\u201349). Recent research has highlighted the enzyme\u2019s potential as a marker of invasive carcinoma and as a tumor suppressor, which was in accordance with our bioinformatics analyses (49).\nAccording to the MTGs-OS, we plotted the pan-cancer map for the first time, which provided novel insights and preliminary research foundation into the involvements of MTGs-OS in pancancer. Considering the importance and relevance for MTGs-OS in pan-cancer, we could try to classify the human tumors based on the MTGs-OS. And MTGs-OS identification might help translate specific immunotherapies for one type of cancer into patients with other types of cancer. At the same time, the pan-cancer map might provide the guidance for the basic scientific research exploration of the MTGs-OS in the future. For patients with PC, we discovered that most MTGs-OS existed as putative protective genes. This result is consistent with the earlier studies (50\u201352), which show that appropriate upregulation of MTGs-OS might contribute to improved patients\u2019 prognoses in PC. The mitochondrial ROS were shown to be beneficial to PC, which could provide new insights and points for exploring the\nfrontiersin.org\nmechanism of action of MTGs-OS in fundamental researches and treating the patients with PC in clinical.\nWe then classified PC patients into three clusters according to their MTGs-OS expression. Patients with PC who belonged to the MTGs-OS inactive cluster had a worse survival rate compared to those belonging to the MTGs-OS active cluster. Similar to these findings, we discovered that MTGs-OS were mostly protective.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 15\nAt present, targeted drugs exist for several neoplasms, including breast and ovarian malignancies, but not for PC (53). Considering the crucial effects of MTGs-OS in PC, we explored the roles of several commonly used drugs that target MTGs-OS in the treatment of PC. We found that the three clusters responded differentially depending on the drug selected.

Patients with inactive MTGs-OS, for instance, could respond better to AICAR (AMPK activator) and cisplatin, gemcitabine, AZD6482(PI3Kb inhibitors), and so on.\nNotably, the balance between tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes may exert a role in the onset and advancement of PC and related patient prognosis. By disrupting the balance between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, MTGs-OS may improve the prognoses of PC individuals. For example, the increased levels of oncogenes expression (STAB1, TENM3, PIK3CA, ZFHX4, ADAMTS12, GLI3, HMCN1) and attenuated expression of tumor suppressors, such as RNF4, in the C3 cluster were correlated with dismal prognoses.

Consequently, we examined the link between immune cell infiltration and MTGs-OS. Our findings illustrated that MTGs-OS performs an essential function in immune activation, which suggests that the MTGs-OS-inactive subgroup of PC has a higher grade of malignancy. Further, we discovered that MTGs-OS can trigger both primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint activators. As a result of its overexpression of\nB\nC D\nA\nFIGURE 12 Difference in drug sensitivity between low and high-risk patients in train, test1, test2, and test3 cohorts.

This may explain the worse clinical outcomes for patients in MTGs-OS-inactive. Treg cells, mast cells, and the T helper cell might enhance the development of neoplasm and promote tumor metastasis resulting in a poor prognosis in PC (56\u201358). The data show that patients in the C3 subtype have the poorest prognosis, which may be attributed to a negative correlation between immune cells that promote the malignancy and the MTGs-OS score. Our study identified the molecular inhibition of MTGs-OS in patients with PC and revealed the different characteristics in the 3clusters, such as the expression of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, the activation of vital pathway and TME and so on. In addition, according to the characteristic, it is beneficial to carry out personalized intervention for PC patients in clinical and promote the research development of PC.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 17\nBased on the results above, we could consider the MTGs-OS play an important role in the development of PC. However, because of the MTGs-OS molecular heterogeneity complex function of each MTGs-OS, the classification cannot be able to accurately calculate the clinical outcome of each patient. Therefore, we established a molecular prognostic signature that can accurately predict the clinical outcomes in patients with PC. We used the LASSO-Cox regression analysis to formulate a prognostic signature consisting of 11 MTGs-OS that can be applied in the prediction of PC patients\u2019 overall survival status. The 11 hub MTGs-OS were BIK, COQ4, MCRIP2, SOD1, NDUFB8, MRPL50, MRPL14, RFK, NMNAT3, BNIP3L, MRPS5. The MTGs-RPS we established could predict the prognosis of PC stably and reliably, which was verified by the internal validation and external validation sets. The MTGs-RPS might help the clinical doctors to choose the suitable and personal treatment therapy for patient with PC. Furthermore, we found the\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nH\nFIGURE 13 MTG-RPS-based analysis of tumor immune microenvironment.

We verified the reliability of the bioinformatics analysis results by qRT-PCR in five kinds of cell lines(vitro) and IHC(vivo) in the HPA database. Almost the validated results were consistent with those predicted by the bioinformatics analysis.\nThe similar function of the 11 hub genes in tumor or pancreatic cancer has been reported in other researches. BIK is a proapoptotic gene, there were research showing liposome complexed with mutant Bik(T33D/S35D) gene could enhance the anti-tumor effect of BIK in various animal cancer models, including the pancreatic cancer (59). SOD1 could eliminate toxic radicals. Study show the SOD1 could accelerate the invasive and migratory of pancreatic cancer by the H2O2/ERK/NF-kB axis and regulate the expression of EMT-related genes (60). Moreover, accumulating evidence have shown that the expression of SOD1 is significantly up-regulated in many types of malignant tumors, which may lead to the deterioration of the disease and poor prognosis by regulating cell proliferation and oxidative stress (61). As for BNIP3, demethylation of BNIP3 with a methyltransferase inhibitor restores gene expression and induces hypoxic-mediated cell death. We can consider the BNIP3 as a potential target for new therapies aimed at treating pancreatic cancer (62). And MRPS5 could help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. The knockdown of MRPS5 obviously could inhibit the pancreatic cell lines proliferation (63). NMNAT3 might play a positive role in the immunotherapy treatment of tumors by suppling NAD+ precursors (64). And NDUFB8 participate in the constitute of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Lots of researches revealed the NDUFB8 is a potential target in many kinds of human tumors, such as cervical cancer tissue, gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and glioblastoma (65\u201370), nevertheless, no study explored the relationship between the NDUFB8 and pancreatic cancer. COQ4 is the component of the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway, the COQ4 mutations might lead to early-onset mitochondrial diseases (71). MRPL14 is part of 2 intersubunit bridges in the assembled ribosome, which might be involved in the occurrence and development of thyroid tumors (72). RFK is essential for TNFinduced ROS production, which can influence the progress of breast invasive carcinoma and human prostate cancer (71, 73). However, the role of COQ4, MCRIP2, MRPL50, MRPL14, RFK, and NMNAT3 in pancreatic tumor has not been reported.\nBased on the prognostic signature, we grouped the patients with PC into high-risk and low-risk categories by using bioinformatics technology. The findings of KM analysis illustrated that the highrisk patients exhibited a shorter overall survival compared to the low-risk patients. Based on the ROC curve, it was determined that the MTGs-RPS was highly accurate in anticipating 5-year survival rates. Seventeen different types of drugs were evaluated across both the training and validation datasets. All 17 drugs were more effective for the patients with PC in the high-risk subgroup, which might guide the clinical treatment. The scientificity, reliability, and precision of MTGs-RPS were confirmed in the training, internal validation, and external validation sets.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology 18\nIndependently, our MTGs-RPS was able to predict the prognosis in PC, hence it may be used as a prognostic marker in PC.\nGiven the significance of immune infiltration in PC, we investigated its potential functions in the MTGs-RPS in further depth. The study indicated that high- and low-risk patients had different patterns of immune cell infiltration. We discovered that the high-risk patients had an immunosuppressive phenotype, which is only accompanied by a multitude of M0 macrophage infiltration; conversely, the low-risk subgroup was named active anti-tumor immune with many antitumor immune cells (e.g. CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, B cells). Additionally, the varied clinical results might be attributed to the varying expression levels of immune checkpoints.\nConsider that most PNETs are malignant and more than 60% of patients have tumor metastasis when diagnosed, which is accounting for 3%-7% of PC (74, 75), we also explored the function of MTGs-OS in PNET. Similar as in PC, 226 patients with PNET were separated into 3 clusters, named C1, C2 and C3. And patients in C1 and C2 were included in S1 subtype because of semblable high MTGs-OS scores. Patients in C3 were low MTGsOS scores named S2. For patients in S1 represented the high MTGsOS scores, the activation of sphingolipid metabolism and inhibition of B cell and T cell receptor signaling pathway and the high expression of oncogenes(especially for GNAS, HRAS, PDZRN3, and SYNE2) were more active than that in S2 subgroup. The results revealed the activation level of MTGs-OS also play important role in PNET, which might predict prognosis of patients with PNET innovatively and precisely in further research. More important, our findings might provide novel target in the MTGs-OS for tumor therapy improving the outcomes of patients with PC and PNET.\nThere are a several limitations that should be mentioned in the study. Firstly, the novel prognostic model was both constructed and validated with retrospective data from public. More prospective real-world data are need to warrant to validate the clinical utility of the MTGs-RPS. Secondly, further mechanism investigations are needed to explain the role of the 11MTGs-OS in the occurrence and progression of PC and PNET. Thirdly, the multi-omics data of PC and PNET did not provide the clinical information, such as the tumor recurrence and metastasis data. Neither the classification nor the MTGs-OS could provide valuable guidance and help for tumor recurrence and metastasis. Despite the limitations, the advantages and clinical significance of our results cannot be ignored. Our research could still provide guidance for MTGs-OS -related basic research of and clinical treatment of PC and PNET."

Furthermore, abnormal MTGs-OS activity was linked to the oncogenesis of PC and PNET in the first place. In addition, the activation of MTGs-OS served as a protective factor for PC. Moreover, patients with PC can be classified into three clusters (i.e. MTGs-OS-normal, MTGs-OS-active, and MTGs-OS-inactive)\nfrontiersin.org\nwith different characteristics of prognosis, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity. And patients with PNET were successfully stratified into 2 subtypes(S1 and S2). The different characteristics for expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and immune and metabolism pathway between S1 and S2 subtypes were compared. Finally, we construct a novel MTGs-RPS signature that provides a superior prognostic prediction for PC patients. In addition to enhancing the treatment plan, the signature will provide individual direction for clinical medication use, making it highly effective for patients with PC. In conclusion, the research might offer a novel strategy to predict the prognosis provide clinical guidance for the treatment of PC."
