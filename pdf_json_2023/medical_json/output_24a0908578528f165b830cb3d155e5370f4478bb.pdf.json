All images were captured with a Leica LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope. For PCNA and Caspase 3 staining images, number of positively stained cells were manually annotated by counting only DAPI-stained cells with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) signals for the entire frame and normalised to area (positive cell/mm2). For cortisol (Alexa Fluor 546)/HNF4a (Alexa Fluor 488) or Tgfb1a (Alexa Fluor 546)/HNF4a (Alexa Fluor 488) co-immunostainings, hepatocytes (HNF4a+) cells were firstly identified by manually annotating Alexa Fluor 488 (green)+ cells in the entire frame. Following which, % of hepatocytes with Alexa Fluor 546 (red) staining were counted for either cortisol or Tgfb1a.\u201d\nOPEN\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:8825 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35711-6\nxmrk+ Myc+A B\nC D\nFe m\nal e\nM al\ne\nwt\nFe m\nal e\nM al\ne PCNA po si tiv e ce lls / m m 2 wt M wt F xm rk+ M xm rk+ F My c+ M My c+ F 0 500 1000 1500 * * *\nwt M wt F\nxm rk+\nM\nxm rk+\nF\nMy c+\nM\nMy c+\nF\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\nCaspase 3\npo si\ntiv e\nce lls\n/ m\nm 2\nns\n* *\nPCNA DAPI\nCaspase 3 DAPI\nFigure\u00a02.
