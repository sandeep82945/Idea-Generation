    "abstractText": "Background: Stressful situations can have an impact on an individual\u2019s eating behavior. People vulnerable to the influence of stress tend to change the quantity and quality of their food intake. Variables such as sex and body mass index (BMI) seem to be related to this stress-eating behavior, but it is rather unclear what factors account to the parameters associated with stress-eating behavior. The aim of this survey was to identify further characteristics of adults in Germany related to stress-overeating, focusing on stress perception, coping, eating motives and comfort foods as well as personality types. Methods: This online survey was performed throughout Germany and comprised a 38-item pre-tested questionnaire. Stress-induced overeating was classified based on the Salzburg Stress Eating Scale (SSES). Moreover, validated questionnaires were used to identify additional characteristics of stress eaters. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach, and data were collected between January and April 2021. Results: The overall sample consisted of 1222 participants (female 80.8%, aged 31.5\u00b112.8). 42.1% of participants were identified as stress-overeaters. Among the remaining group, 78.9% stated to eat less, 21.1% to eat equally when stressed. Female participants had a higher mean SSES score compared to male participants. The BMI was positively correlated to SSES, r(1220)=0.28, p>0.005. \u2018Agreeableness\u2019 (BigFive) was found to be a negative predictor of stress-overeating. The most pronounced difference in eating motives (The Eating Motivation Survey, TEMS) was found for \u2018Affect Regulation\u2019 and \u2018Weight Control\u2019. Conclusions: The results indicate that stress-overeating affects a large proportion of the surveyed population. BMI, personality and eating motives additionally characterize stress-overeaters and may contribute to develop new approaches to address unhealthy stress-related eating patterns.",

Stress-induced overeating was classified based on the Salzburg Stress Eating Scale (SSES). Moreover, validated questionnaires were used to identify additional characteristics of stress eaters. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach, and data were collected between January and April 2021.\nResults: The overall sample consisted of 1222 participants (female 80.8%, aged 31.5\u00b112.8). 42.1% of participants were identified as stress-overeaters. Among the remaining group, 78.9% stated to eat less, 21.1% to eat equally when stressed. Female participants had a higher mean SSES score compared to male participants. The BMI was positively correlated to SSES, r(1220)=0.28, p>0.005. \u2018Agreeableness\u2019 (BigFive) was found to be a negative predictor of stress-overeating. The most pronounced difference in eating motives (The Eating Motivation Survey, TEMS) was found for \u2018Affect Regulation\u2019 and \u2018Weight Control\u2019.\nConclusions: The results indicate that stress-overeating affects a large proportion of the surveyed population. BMI, personality and eating motives additionally characterize stress-overeaters and may contribute to develop new approaches to address unhealthy stress-related eating patterns.\nKeywords: Stress, Nutrition, Overeating, Coping, Eating motives, Personality\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Especially, a high intake of sodium as well as insufficient intakes of whole grains fiber and fruit were found to be leading dietary risk factors. Unhealthy dietary patterns (e.g., energy-dense food) particularly contribute to the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome [2]. Stress is one risk factors for the development of unhealthy eating habits (e.g., binge eating or overeating), which can lead to serious health problems like overweight and obesity [3, 4].\n*Correspondence: kgedrich@tum.de 1 Research Group Public Health Nutrition, ZIEL - Institute for Food & Health, Technical University of Munich, Weihenstephaner Berg 1, 85354 Freising, Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nLazarus and Folkman (1984, p.19) defined stress as \u201ca particular relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being\u201d [5]. Different mechanisms to compensate stress are activated to maintain the homeostasis of the organism. Stress triggers the autonomic nervous system (ANS), signaling alert, to prepare the organism for a fight or flight reaction by ,e.g., increasing the heart rate and releasing stress hormones [6]. The activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) triggers the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), which mediates the suppression of food intake. The CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which contributes to the release of glucocorticoid hormones, e.g., cortisol. After less severe stress, increased levels of glucocorticoids and cortisol are associated with increased appetite [7].\nIt was shown that 82% of a population change the amount of their food intake in the context of stress [8]. People who eat more when stressed are defined as hyperphagic and people who eat less when stressed are defined as hypophagic [9]. Besides the general increase or decrease of food quantities due to the experience of stress, research focuses on the quality of the consumed foods. Stress tends to stimulate the sensitivity of the reward system, leading to craving for hyperpalatable or comfort foods [10]. Additionally, the prioritization of eating motives changes and the eating behavior is shifted to emotional instead of nutritional needs [11]. Stress-related changes in eating behavior are associated with various factors. Regarding anthropometrics, perceived stress has been found to be positively correlated with short-term weight change (r = 0.35, p = 0.01) [12]. Forms of overeating due to perceived stress and negative affect have a higher prevalence in women than in men [13].\nAdditionally, emotion-based eating is mediated by individual differences in stress perception. Brouwer et\u00a0al. [14] described the association of certain types of personality and stress sensitivity. To categorize personality types, the five-factor model is often used [15]. Whereas on the one hand, neuroticism is positively correlated with stress sensitivity, conscientiousness, on the other hand, is negatively correlated with stress sensitivity. Supplementary, certain types of personality are associated with emotional eating, specifically neuroticism, low conscientiousness and low extraversion [16].\nFurthermore, adequate stress coping capabilities (e.g., social support) are seen to have a mediating effect on the perception of stress (e.g., depression) [17]. \u2018Positive Thinking\u2019, seeing the good side of stress, \u2018Active Stress Coping\u2019, being proactive to prevent stress, \u2018Social Support\u2019, having people around who help to manage stress\nand \u2018Keeping Faith\u2019, finding hold in faith, are adaptive coping strategies. \u2018Increased Alcohol and Cigarette Consumption\u2019, relying on alcohol and cigarettes if stress gets overwhelming, is categorized as maladaptive coping strategy [18]. Inadequate coping strategies, however, can lead to disordered eating behaviors [19]. Taken together, various aspects seem to influence the vulnerability of individuals to stress-induced unhealthy eating patterns.\nEvidence on other relevant factors associated with overeating in the context of stress is still rare. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore stress-eating behavior of people in Germany. In detail, this study focused on the identification of associations between stress-overeating behavior and 1) anthropometric variables, 2) perceived stress, 3) stress coping, 4) eating motives and behavior (including comfort foods) and 5) type of personality."

Information about the research project, protection of data privacy and voluntary participation were integrated within the introductory section. The survey focused on five key aspects: eating behavior, stress (perception and coping), stress-eating, technical behavior (general technical innovativeness and IT adoption and acceptance of fictive digital stress application) and personality. Sociodemographic and self-reported anthropometric data were collected at the end of the survey. Most survey items were issued as short and easy to understand\nquestion items with closed, open, single or multiplechoice answering options. Filter questions were integrated to simplify the completion of the questionnaire. Items on technical behavior are beyond the scope of the current considerations and were therefore neglected for analysis. Five psychometrical tools and eight additional question items were appraised for primary analysis within this manuscript."

Stress-eaters are defined as individuals who change their eating behavior due to stress situations, irrespective of the direction of change (hyper- as well as hypophagia) [28]. Accordingly, respondents who were categorized as \u2018eats more\u2019 when stressed according to the SSES valuation, are hereinafter referred to as stress-overeaters, respondents categorized as \u2018eats less\u2019 are referred to as stress-undereaters and participants categorized as \u2018eats equal\u2019 when stressed are referred to as stress-insensitive eaters.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In this survey stress-overeaters were compared to non stress-overeaters (stress-undereaters and stress-insensitive eaters) regarding associations to (stress-related)\nbehavioural characteristics and personality types. We were able to identify certain characteristics of stressovereaters that need to be discussed in more detail.\nBased on the validated SSES [21], we identified about 42% of participants as stress-overeaters and 58% as non stress-overeaters (among the latter 79% eating less, 21% eating equal). The results of the stress-eating selfassignment revealed that subjectively more participants rated themselves as stress-overeaters (48%). Objective and subjective stress-eating classifications were strongly related, indicating that most of the affected individuals are aware of their vulnerability to overeating in stressful situations. Similar stress-eating distributions were found by Oliver and Wardle [32], investigating a sample of 212 undergraduate students. They also identified 42% of their participants being hyperphagic in stressful situations, but only 38% to eat less under stress. Furthermore, our results disclose a positive association between stressovereating and levels of perceived stress.\nRegarding socio-economic and anthropometric characteristics, stress-overeating was significantly associated with sex and BMI. The latter is in line with Cotter and Kelly [33] examining cross-sectional data from 3,708 adults presenting a positive association between experienced stress and BMI as well as waist circumferences after controlling for age and other variables (2% variance).\nStress-eating can also be seen as a maladaptive response towards stress [34]. Therefore, participants\u2019 stress-coping behaviour should be considered in relation to stress-eating. While most survey participants reported \u2018Social Support\u2019 as the most important coping strategy, none of the SCI strategies was found to be positively associated with stress-overeating. Wichianson et\u00a0al. [35] investigated the link between perceived stress and night-eating syndrome in a sample of 95 undergraduate students. Their results revealed an association between maladaptive coping and unhealthy night-eating (\u03b2=0.25, p<0.05). Adequate coping was also found to be positively related to adherence to own dietary goals [36] and healthier food choices [37].\nBesides coping behaviour, eating motivation was found to affect eating patterns. Our results demonstrate that the eating motives \u2018Habits\u2019 and \u2018Weight Control\u2018 can predict stress-overeating. Regarding habits, it has been shown that the experience of stress activates habitual behaviour rather than goal-directed behavioural strategies [38]. In the context of this research, it can be interpreted that goal-orientated healthy eating behaviour is suppressed by unhealthy comfort eating habits to cope with stress. This is in line with findings by O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Connor [39] reporting about a group of 155 females trying to lose weight who increased the consumption of between-meal snacks in stressful situations. Additionally, persons identified as stress-overeaters had significantly higher importance scores of \u2018Affect Regulation\u2019 and \u2018Weight Control\u2019. These results are confirmed by Sproesser et\u00a0al. [40] reporting a negative relation between \u2018Affect Regulation\u2019 and healthy eating patterns as well as an association between weight control and emotional eating on a sample of 761 females. Pool et\u00a0al. [41] showed that the experience of stress provokes habitual eating patterns, which have long been established.\nStress not only influences the amount of food intake, but also food choices towards unhealthier food items. Our results demonstrate that chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, chips and crackers, salted nuts, sweets, as well as fast and fried foods were found to be positively associated with stress-overeating. This is in line with the findings by Macht and Mueller [42] depicting emotional eaters to have more intense chocolate cravings and accordingly a higher chocolate consumption. Similarly, Errisuriz et\u00a0 al. [43] found a positive association between perceived stress and the consumption of salty snacks and fast food as well as soda, coffee and energy drinks (p<0.05), in a sample of 613 students. In total, our results reveal that stress-overeaters tend to have a preference for snack-related food items, especially sweets. This is in agreement with a study of Oliver, Wardle and Gibson [44], showing in a sample of 68 healthy individuals that perceived stress is positively correlated with the consumption of less healthy foods, especially high-fat and energy-dense ones.\nRegarding the link between stress and comfort foods, it should be taken into account that stress coping as well as dieting status were shown to have effects on the consumption of comfort foods. According to literature, individuals with a low ability to manage stress were found to have a greater consumption of sweet snacks [43]. Restrained eaters (i.e., dieters) tend to eat more when stressed, whereas non-restrained eaters (i.e., non-dieters) tend to eat less when stressed [32]. There is also a difference by sex. Women tend to be more vulnerable to stress-eating, increasing their food consumption when\nstressed [45, 46]. Our results also reveal a slightly higher stress-eating score (4.0%) for females compared to males.\nOur study addressed the association between certain types of personality and stress-overeating. Out of the BigFive dimensions, only two dimensions were associated with stress-overeating. \u2018Neuroticism\u2019 was found to significantly differ between stress-overeaters and stressinsensitive eaters. This finding can be explained by the fact that individuals with high scoring in \u2018Neuroticism\u2019 tend to be insecure, nervous and depressed [27] and perceive stress more intensely than other types of personality [47]. Furthermore, Keller and Siegrist [48] reported a promoting effect of \u2018Neuroticism\u2019 for unfavourable food choices and overeating styles. \u2018Agreeableness\u2019, in contrast, was revealed as a negative predictor for stress-overeating. Recording to literature, high scores of \u2018Agreeableness\u2019 are assigned to persons with a high level of interpersonal trust and cooperation as well as altruistic behaviour [27]. In contrast, low levels of \u2018Agreeableness\u2019 are considered as a risk factor for the development of eating disorders [49]. A high level of \u2018Conscientiousness\u2019 was found to be associated with healthy dietary behaviour as well as better health in general [50]. Additionally, \u2018Conscientiousness\u2019 and \u2018Openness\u2019 are related to a higher intake of fruit and vegetables [49]."

The selection of predictors was based on an intense literature search and validated questionnaires were used for the assessment of potential predictors. This paper can therefore only serve as a contribution for a better characterization of stress-overeaters, covering a broad spectrum, ranging from personality dimensions over coping strategies up to anthropometric measurements. However, we cannot claim that the complete set of predictors for stressinduced hyperphagia was considered and additional research is needed. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design only allows for conclusions on potential associations between parameters, but it does not provide proof of causal relationships. The examined large German sample is not representative for the general population. It mainly consisted of young female students, therefore results cannot be generalized and further research in other population groups is necessary. Besides, the survey was conducted within a period of time, where governmental restrictions due to the global COVID-pandemic were legislated in Germany. Possible effects of the pandemic might contribute to unconsidered influences on stress and eating behaviour in the context of different types of personality."

            "text": "The objective of this study was to identify characteristics of stress-overeaters. Taken together perceived stress, dietary behaviour aspects and certain personality dimensions seem to be relevant predictors for stress-overeating. Especially, \u2018Agreeableness\u2019 personality and eating motives \u2018Hunger\u2019 and \u2018Traditional Eating\u2019, are negatively associated with stress-overeating, while the eating motives \u2018Habits\u2019, \u2018Health\u2019 \u2018Weight Control\u2019 and \u2018Affect Regulation\u2019 positively predict stress-overeating. Stress-overeating was found to evoke unhealthy, especially snack-related sweet food choices, called \u2018comfort foods\u2019. This hyperphagic behaviour affects about 42% of the survey population. The identified characteristics could possibly help to better predict potentially vulnerable subgroups and to develop target group-specific interventions to support healthier dietary patterns in the context of stress.\nAbbreviations BFI-10: Big Five Inventory (10 items); BMBF: German Ministry for Education and Research (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung); BMI: Body Mass Index; CRH: Corticotropin Releasing Hormone; DALY: Disability-Adjusted Life Years; HPA: Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal; PSS: Perceived Stress Scale; SCI: Stress and Coping Inventory; SSES: Salzburg Stress Eating Scale; TEMS: The Eating Motivation Survey.\nAcknowledgements Authors would like to thank BMBF and enable to facilitate this study.
