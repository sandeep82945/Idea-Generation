The materials which are used in these classes of apparatus have diverse head starts, such as simple making, mechanical elasticity, and the potential large-area manufacture affordable. At the same time, some other optoelectronic apparatus such as light-emitting diodes and sensors benefit from potential applications [1\u20133] Titanium oxide is one of the metal oxide semiconductors which have been most fairly studied and owing to its special optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, it is used in various practical applications.\nTitanium dioxide (TiO2) may be utilized in numerous applications and it is attractive for high technology due to its amazing electrical, optical, and chemical properties; comprising vast band gap energy, antitoxic and diaphaneity in the visible light, well index of refraction, electrochemical stability, and fine isolating features [4]. Apart from these, particularly photocatalysis, photovoltaic and gas sensing have utilized titanium dioxide [5,8], and owing to its high conversion efficiency, also dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have used it in the alternative energy field in which porous TiO2 electrodes are used [9]. On the other hand, the opportunities to use this material in the above-mentioned applications mainly regard their production cost and performance. Thus, it is an important factor to search for low-cost production technologies in these applications development in the future [10]. Beneath the distinct impression of solar radiation and photogenerated carriers, for enhancing photo-absorption of the TiO2-based materials, various strategies have been studied and doping with metal and nonmetal ions [11], altered with excellent metals [12], connected with other semiconductors (Bi2WO6, ZnO, MoO3, and CdS etc.) [13] and sensitization via various organic materials delicate to sunlight [14\u201316] instance can be given. For the generation of a hetero-junction structure, it has been accepted as an efficient method to couple TiO2 with other semiconductors to gain a better photo-catalytic movement of TiO2 [17].\nMolybdenum oxide (MoO3) is among transition metal oxides and it is a large band gap n-type semiconductor material. MoO3, which is among the most significant stratified materials has conspicuousness in many areas such as photochromic and electrochromic devices, catalysis, energy stowage, and gas sensors due to its unique features. MoO3 has been implemented as a gas sensor [18]. On the other hand, studies have reported that MoTiO5 can act as a charge capture layer in memory devices [19]. The transfer of photo-excited electrons from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to the conduction band (CB) of MoO3 via direct Ti/O/Mo junction and prolonging the lifetime of the photo-excited electron-hole pairs likely enhance photosensitivity [20].\nKey words: Photoelectrode, MoO3, TiO2, MoTiO5, SILAR\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nUntil this point in time, different strategies have been created to magnify nanoparticles of IV\u2013VI semiconducting materials. To prepare IV\u2013VI semiconductors, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [21], chemical bath deposition (CBD) [22], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [23], and consecutive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) [24] have been traditionally used. SILAR depends on the dip of the substrate into independently positioned cations and anions followed by washing after every response, it makes possible to give a heterogeneous response among the solid stage and the solvated ions in the solution. In order to form thin films which are uniform, compact and crystalline, it is ideal to use the SILAR method. Moreover, SILAR does not need a target or vacuum, the deposition rate and the film thickness can be easily controlled over a long range by varying the number of deposition cycles.\nIn this study, a different new method for synthesis of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 nano-structures based on SILAR to indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes is presented. MoO3/TiO2/MoTiO5 nano-structures obtained were recognized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction, and photo-current analysis. Improvement in photocurrent density between MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 electrodes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the charge transfer resistance at the interface studies have been done. It is indicated by the test results that, by setting the spool time, control of the morphology and size of MoO3, TiO2, MoTiO5 nano-structures can be possible. Good photovoltaic properties are shown by the nano-structured MoO3, TiO2, MoTiO5 photo-electrodes formed and they can be utilized in applications of solar energy conversion. Using optical-quality enlarged nano-structures with a low defect concentration which has a stable and repeatable photo-current through many cycles is the general test strategy of this study as can be given in Figure 1."

All of the electrolyte solutions used in this study were prepared using deionized water (i.e.>18M\u2126) from a Milli-\u2126system. In this method, 25 mL of 0.05 M Titanium III chloride (TiCl3) and 25 mL of 0.05 M of sodium molybdate (MoNa2O4) as cationic and 25 mL of 0.02 M of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as an ionic pioneer were expended. Four beaker SILAR contrivance was used to prepare MoO3 and TiO2 thin films with different nanostructures, where cationic and ionic precursors were formed from two rinse steps. The cleaned ITO substrate was submersed for 20 s in a cationic solution (MoNa2O4) for the adsorption of molybdenum ions onto the substrate and in the anionic solution (NaOH) for 20 s to form MoO3 materials. One might as well say, the well-cleaned ITO substrate was submersed in a cationic solution (TiCl3) for 20 s for the adsorption of the titanium ions on the substrate and anionic solution (NaOH) for 20 s to form TiO2 materials. A six-beaker SILAR system was expended to arrange MoTiO5 nanostructured thin films, where cationic and ionic solutions were individuated by a rinse step. The cleaned ITO substrate was submersed in a cationic solution (MoNa2O4) for 20 s for the adsorption of molybdenum ions on the substrate and a cationic solution (TiCl3) for 20 s for the adsorption of the titanium ions on the substrate. The ITO substrate was washed in deionized water for 10 s to remove the loosely bound molybdenum, titanium, and hydroxide ions. Washing the substrate using deionized water for 10 s again distinguish surplus or nonreaction ions. In this manner, a SILAR cycle of accumulating each of MoO3, TiO2, MoTiO5 is finished. This type of 80 SILAR period was reiterated to obtain the optimum thickness of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 thin films."

ITO-coated quartz (10 \u2126 cm\u22122) was used as the working electrode for the electrochemical measurements and the photoelectrochemical measurements. The counter and reference electrodes that were used included a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl), respectively. The photocatalytic performance of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 electrodes was determined by performing cyclic voltammetry studies for the one-electron reduction of reversible Fe(CN)6 3\u2212/Fe(CN)6 4\u2212 redox system in a solution containing 10.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 0.1 M KCl. X-ray diffraction plots of the deposited films were registered with a Rigaku powder X-ray diffraction meter with a CuK X-ray source (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u1ea2). Morphological workout and identification of the elemental composition (Mo/O), (Ti/O), and (Mo/Ti/O) of MoO3, TiO2, MoTiO5 nanostructures were performed by an EDS united with a scanning electron microscope (ZEISS system). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Spect-Flex spectrometer) measurements of metal oxide samples were obtained by using a standard Al X-ray source. Atomic force microscopy images of electrodeposits were acquired in ambient conditions, with a Hitachi 5100N instrument. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy measurements were obtained from a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus spectrophotometer. Photoelectrochemical quantifications of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 nanostructures were made at room temperature using 0.1 M KCl solution.

            "text": "Figure 2 indicates the AFM and SEM images of the coated electrode surface and it emphasizes the tremendously special surface of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 film. Controlling metal oxides synthesized by the SILAR method on the substrate (Figure 2), its ability to easily adjust the shape and size of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 nanostructures has been demonstrated by the results and SEM and AFM images. Pure MoO3 nano-belts at low and high magnification are shown in Figures 2(a)\u2013 2(d) and MoO3 is seen as scattered nano-belts about 500 nm long and 50 nm thick. Figures 2(b)-2(e) show AFM and SEM micrographs of TiO2 nanostructures with diameters of approximately 50 nm shaped as nano-discs. While its morphology owns great changes when comparing the TiO2 and MoO3 precursor, TiO2 nanoparticles in nano-disc shape own nano-belts structures on the MoO3 surface. SEM and AFM data (Figures 2c\u20132f) show MoTiO5, the combined structures of nanobelts and nano-discs. With the increase of photo-absorption efficiency on MoTiO5 nanostructured thin films, which have impressive photosensitivity, light absorption, reflection and scattering can be increased significantly. The SEM image of MoTiO5 can be seen in Figure 2(f) and the results indicate that the MoTiO5 nanostructures [25] were designed perfectly after the SILAR procedure. Well connection between MoO3 nanoparticles in nano-belts shape and TiO2 nanoparticles in nano-disc shape can be observed. Additionally, to verify the elements\u2019 composition, the EDX analysis of the MoTiO5 was performed and the results are given in Figure 2(f). The existence of Ti, Mo, and O atoms in the region elected and each component\u2019s respective heaviness proportions being 52.98% (O), 17.14% (Mo), and 19.63% (Ti) can be seen.\nTo examine the crystal growth of the as-designed samples, a systematic XRD study was performed and Figure 3 shows the results. The diffraction peaks with reference to the (101), (111), (2 0 0), (2 1 1), (2 0 4), and (301) crystal orientations with the lattice constants a = 3.755 \u00c5 and c = 9.5114 \u00c5 confirm the tetragonal anatase phases of the TiO2 nanoparticles in compliance with the JCPDS file 21-1272 [26]. Regarding the unalloyed MoO3, the XRD planes displayed at 2\u03b8 = 12.8\u00b0, 25.8\u00b0, 38.9\u00b0, 46.1\u00b0, and 49.3\u00b0correspond to the (020), (040), (021), (061), and (002) orientations of orthorhombic construction MoO3 with the JCPDS Card no. 05-0508 and the lattice literals a 5 3.96 \u00c5 and c 5 3.7 \u00c5 [27]. It was shown in the sample that nano-belts average thickness is approximately 50 nm. The MoTiO5 sample exhibited diffraction peaks at 28.3\u00b0, 47.1\u00b0, and 49.9\u00b0, which MoTiO5 had phases with peaks at (101), (301), and (311), respectively. From the MoTiO5 curve [28], it can be well observed that the diffraction peaks of MoTiO5 can be successfully prepared by this process.\nFigure 4(a) indicates UV\u2013visible absorption spectra of arrant TiO2, MoO3, and MoTiO5. In Figure 4a, it is clearly seen that the absorption intensity in MoTiO5 is higher at about 300 nm compared to TiO2 and MoO3. The band gap values of the films were calculated by plotting (Ah\u03bd)2 vs. (h\u03bd) and extrapolating the linear portion of the graph to the energy axis (Figure 4b) [29]. The plots of (Ah\u03bd)2 versus (h\u03bd) are illustrated in Figure 4(b), the band gaps of the synthesized MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 thin films were found to be 3.0 eV, 3.2 eV, and 3.6 eV, respectively. As can be seen, among the developed materials, MoTiO5 is one of the semiconductor metal oxides with a wide band gap of 3.6 eV.\nXPS study was performed to indicate the presence of Mo/Ti/O bond in the nano-composites and Figure 5 shows the results. It is shown in Figure 5(a) that it is shown in the large-scan XPS spectrum that the overborne C. Ti, O, and Mo elements are formed through patterns among these elements and the C element is from the XPS instrument itself, and no\nother elements are appointed. The high-definition XPS spectrum of O 1s and the location of the binding energy of 530.3 eV are shown in Figure 5(b). O 1 s spectra indicate, that the O\u2013H content increases with respect to the O lattice in Mo\u2013O and Ti-O, thus surface hydroxyl groups are the primary source of protons. It is shown in Figures 5(c) and 5(d), for TiO2 that the binding energies of Ti 2p1/2, and Ti 2p3/2 peaks are detected at 464.3 eV and 458.5 eV, and the binding energies of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks are detected at 236.4 eV and 233.6 eV, sequentially. In contrast, in case of the MoTiO5, it is reported that the binding energies of Ti 2p1/2, and Ti 2p3/2 peaks are detected at 464.2 eV and 458.9 eV, and the binding energies of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks are detected at 236.1 eV and 233.4 eV, sequentially. With the creation of MoTiO5 increase in the binding energies of Ti 2p and a decrease in Mo 3d can be observed. As a result, the bonds formed by Ti oxidation and Mo reduction are the main reasons for the excellent photocurrent property. Thus, it is implied that strong interaction exists between Mo/O/Ti and MoTiO5 is generated on ITO [30].\nFigure 6 shows the transient photocurrent of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 nanostructured electrodes produced under chopped one-sunlight illumination. Chrono-Amperometry measurements were carried out in 0.1 M KCl electrolyte under the irradiance of 100 mW/cm2 from SolarLight-16 S for Pt counter and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes. The photocurrent counterpart was measured in 8 s on-off cycles at the short-circuit potential in 0.10 M KCl electrolyte solution without compromising reactive or co-catalysts. When exposed to solar illumination, photocurrents of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 electrodes rise to 1.03 mA cm\u20132, 1.68 mA cm\u20132, and 14.89 mA cm\u20132, respectively. When there is no solar illumination, the photocurrent value drops to zero.\nFigure 6 depicts the quick and monotonic photocurrent in these transients and the rapid change transport mechanism and its connection to single crystalline MoTiO5. Furthermore, the photocurrents produced by the MoTiO5 nanostructures are constant and reproducible across several cycles, showing that the electrode is photocorrosion-free. The chronoamperometry study present in Figure 6, also supports the results obtained from CV and EIS measurements. Moreover, it is also beneficial for their photocatalytic performance that the peerless structure of MoTiO5 would make the light storage better [31,32].\nElectrochemical performances of MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 materials were investigated by using CV and EIS techniques. CVs obtained in an electrochemical solution containing 0.1 M KNO3 and 10 mM Fe(CN)6 3\u2013/ Fe(CN)6 4\u2013 for MoO3, TiO2 and MoTiO5 prepared in metal oxide materials are shown in Figure 7a. While the electrochemical activity of MoO3, and TiO2 materials was quite low, the electrochemical activity of MoTiO5 improved as seen in Figure 7a. Nyquist graphs obtained for TiO, MoO3, and MoTiO5 composite films prepared on ITO electrode in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 10 mM Fe(CN)6\n3\u2212/ Fe(CN)6\n4\u2212 are shown in Figure 7b. Nyquist graphs are fitted according to the electrical circuit given in Figure 7b. Here, the faradaic electron transfer resistance (Rp) corresponds to the diameter of the formed semicircle. The solution resistance (Rw) is the intersection point of the Real Z\u2019 axis of the graph [33]. The stationary phase element (CPE) is the capacitance of the double layer [34]. Accordingly, electron transfer resistances for MoO3, TiO2, and MoTiO5 composite films were determined as 862 \u03a9, 179 \u03a9, and 10 \u03a9, respectively. When the electron transfer values obtained were evaluated, it was determined that the electron transfer resistance was quite low since the electrochemical activity of the MoTiO5 composite film was the highest. Thus, the impedance study carried out also supported the photocurrent studies."

The photocurrent produced by the MoTiO5 nanostructures is steady and reproducible over many cycles, showing that the electrode is photocorrosion-free. The characterization methods and photoelectrochemical studies on these metal oxides have shown that the method applied in the synthesis of these materials affects the crystal structure and grade of the materials at the same time, the nanosize of the synthesized material has a direct effect on the electronic properties and performances of these materials."
