Development of Advanced Drug Delivery Systems: Explore the use of natural cross-linking agents in the development of hydrogels for targeted and controlled drug delivery systems. Focusing on enhancing the precision of drug release rates, improving patient compliance, and minimizing side effects. This research can particularly target chronic diseases, where controlled release of medication over extended periods is beneficial.

Biodegradable and Biocompatible Wound Dressings: Investigate the application of these hydrogels in creating next-generation wound dressings that are biodegradable, biocompatible, and have inherent antibacterial properties. These dressings could also be imbued with the ability to deliver therapeutic agents directly to the wound site, promoting faster healing and reducing infection risk.

Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine: Explore the use of hydrogels cross-linked with natural agents in tissue engineering applications, focusing on the creation of scaffolds for the regeneration of damaged tissues or organs. Research can be directed towards enhancing the mechanical properties of these hydrogels to mimic the extracellular matrix more closely, thereby improving cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.

Cosmetic Applications: Develop hydrogel-based cosmetic products using natural cross-linking agents, such as anti-aging skin care products that provide sustained release of active compounds. The research can focus on improving the penetration of active ingredients through the skin barrier while ensuring the products remain biocompatible and non-toxic.

Environmentally Sensitive Hydrogels for Agricultural Use: Investigate the creation of hydrogels that respond to environmental stimuli (pH, temperature, moisture) for agricultural applications, such as smart delivery systems for fertilizers and pesticides. These hydrogels could help in reducing the environmental impact of agricultural practices by releasing their contents only when needed, thus minimizing waste and pollution.
