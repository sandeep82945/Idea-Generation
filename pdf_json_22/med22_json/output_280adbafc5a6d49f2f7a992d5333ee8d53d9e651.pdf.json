    "abstractText": "Hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) is the increased sensitivity to low doses of ionizing radiation observed in most cell lines. We previously demonstrated that HRS is permanently abolished in cells irradiated at a low dose rate (LDR), in a mechanism dependent on transforming growth factor \u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the activation and receptor binding of TGF-\u03b23 in this mechanism. T-47D cells were pretreated with inhibitors of potential receptors and activators of TGF-\u03b23, along with addition of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from LDR primed cells, before their radiosensitivity was assessed by the clonogenic assay. The protein content of sEVs from LDR primed cells was analyzed with mass spectrometry. Our results show that sEVs contain TGF-\u03b23 regardless of priming status, but only sEVs from LDR primed cells remove HRS in reporter cells. Inhibition of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family prevents removal of HRS, suggesting an MMP-dependent activation of TGF-\u03b23 in the LDR primed cells. We demonstrate a functional interaction between TGF-\u03b23 and activin receptor like kinase 1 (ALK1) by showing that TGF-\u03b23 removes HRS through ALK1 binding, independent of ALK5 and TGF-\u03b2RII. These results are an important contribution to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism behind TGF-\u03b23 mediated removal of HRS.",

            "text": "The low dose region of ionizing radiation (IR) is of concern in cancer radiotherapy, especially through inevitable irradiation of healthy tissue in the radiation field. The extensive use of fractionated radiotherapy calls for an understanding of the mechanisms induced by repeated low-dose exposures. An increased awareness of how these mechanisms differ between malignant and healthy tissues may lead to the discovery of approaches to manipulate the response of these tissues in order to increase the sensitivity of the former, or the resistance of the latter. When irradiated with doses below approximately 0.5 Gy, about 80% of tested cell lines exhibit a hyper-radiosensitive (HRS) response to X-ray, \u03b3-ray, proton, carbon ion, and pi-meson irradiation [1\u20136]. It is well documented that subjecting HRS-competent cells to an acute, high-dose-rate (HDR) priming dose of 0.2\u20130.3 Gy transiently removes the HRS response to subsequent challenge irradiation [7\u201311]. In these cases, HRS is recovered within about 48 h. We have previously shown that giving the same priming dose at a low dose\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2022, 23, 8147 2 of 18\nrate (LDR) of approximately 0.3 Gy/h permanently removes the HRS response from the cells and their progeny [7]. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is a family of pleiotropic proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissue. The three family members that are found in humans, TGF-\u03b21\u20133, have high structural similarity and exercise both overlapping and separate functions in a range of physiological and pathological processes including wound healing and fibrosis, inflammation and cancer [12]. Proteins of the TGF-\u03b2 family signal through a heteromeric complex with two transmembrane serine/threonine receptors. TGF-\u03b2 first binds to a type II receptor, which then recruits and activates a type I receptor [13]. There are seven known type I receptors (Activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1\u20137) and five type II receptors (ActRIIA, ActRIIB, BMPRII, TGF\u03b2RII and AMHRII) [14]. Generally, ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7 bind to TGF-\u03b2, whereas ligands for ALK1, ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 belong to the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and growth differentiation families of proteins [15]. The TGF-\u03b2RII/ALK5 receptor complex is the best described signaling system for all three TGF-\u03b2s. The bound and activated receptor complex phosphorylates Smad proteins to propagate the signal [13]. TGF-\u03b2 family members are transcribed as proproteins and remain inactive after initial intracellular cleaving by furin-type enzymes because of an unusually high affinity between the propeptide latency-associated peptide (LAP) and TGF-\u03b2 [12]. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2-LAP is often found as a tricomplex with the latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein (LTBP), termed the large latent complex (LLT). The LLT is capable of binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) components and thereby act as a depository of TGF-\u03b2. Activation of TGF-\u03b2 requires separation from LAP and is necessary for binding to the TGF-\u03b2 receptor complex. Separation and subsequent activation may follow from diverse processes such as exposure to acidic or basic solutions, heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS). A number of biological molecules, including several members of the metzincin superfamily, also have the ability to activate TGF-\u03b2 family members [16\u201319]. The metzincin superfamily of endopeptidases consists of 23 matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 13 disintegrin metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and 19 ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS). In addition to activation of TGF-\u03b2, members of the metzincin superfamily have a large variety of targets that in turn mediate a range of cellular mechanisms such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, cell motility and structural stability of the ECM [20]. In previous publications, we showed that cell medium that had been conditioned by LDR primed cells and later transferred to unirradiated reporter cells transiently removed HRS in the reporter cells upon subsequent challenge irradiation [21]. We also showed that medium conditioned by unirradiated cells that was collected and LDR irradiated without cells present affected the reporter cells in an equivalent manner [22]. Both mechanisms were TGF-\u03b23 dependent, as neutralizing TGF-\u03b23 antibody retained HRS in the reporter cells. Together, these results suggested that TGF-\u03b23 is secreted from LDR-primed and unirradiated cells and needs to be activated by LDR irradiation in order to remove HRS. The exact nature of the activation process is still unclear, due to the above-mentioned variety of potential activation methods for TGF-\u03b2. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the process of TGF-\u03b23 activation and transfer from LDR primed cells to unirradiated reporter cells. We show that the factors in the cell medium responsible for removing HRS are released from LDR irradiated cells in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). We also show that sEVs contain TGF-\u03b23 regardless of irradiation, indicating an irradiation-dependent activation of TGF-\u03b23 in sEVs from LDR-primed cells. We demonstrate that TGF-\u03b23 is activated by one or several members of the MMP or ADAM protein families in LDR irradiation-induced removal of HRS. In the reporter cells, we show that the TGF-\u03b2RII/ALK5 receptor complex is not responsible for HRS removal. We identify for the first time a functional interaction between TGF-\u03b23 and ALK1 when we show that removal of HRS is dependent on TGF-\u03b23 binding to ALK1. We also uncover a competition between ALK5 and ALK1 for the ligand, where ALK5 demonstrates the higher affinity, whereas ALK1 mediates the mechanism of HRS abolition.\nInt. J. Mol.

The radiosensitivity of the reporter cells was then analyzed via the clonogenic survival assay. Isolation of sEVs was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and the presence of proteins specific to sEVs detected by mass spectroscopy [23] (Figures S1 and S2). While sEVs from control cells did not influence the radiosensitivity of reporter cells, sEVs from LDR primed cells altered their survival curve to that consistent with removal of HRS (Figure 1a). This effect is similar to the direct LDR irradiation and transfer of medium from LDR primed cells (irradiated cell-conditioned medium, ICCM) (Figure 1b). We confirmed that removal of HRS by sEV transfer was dependent on TGF-\u03b23 by adding a neutralizing antibody of TGF-\u03b23 to the sEVs during transfer, a process that retained the HRS response in the reporter cells (Figure 1c). The involvement of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was confirmed by addition of iNOS inhibitor 1400 W, which negated the effect of sEVs from LDR primed cells."

Inhibition of Metalloproteinases Retained HRS in Reporter Cells To assess the involvement of MMP, ADAM or ADAMTS proteins in the activation of TGF-\u03b23 in ICCM- and sEV-mediated removal of HRS in reporter cells, we used a broadspectrum MMP/ADAM inhibitor, TAPI-2, which was added to the medium of LDR primed T-47D cells. After conditioning of the medium, the cells were filtered out, and the ICCM with TAPI-2 was transferred to unirradiated T-47D reporter cells. The reporter cells were then cultivated for 24 hours before re-seeding in fresh medium and subjected to challenge irradiation. Indeed, when metalloproteinases were inhibited in the ICCM, the resulting surviving fraction after 0.1 Gy x-irradiation was consistent with HRS, and lower than that after transfer of ICCM alone, which was similar to that after LDR priming of the cells (Figure 5a). Pretreatment with TAPI-2 alone, without transfer of ICCM, did not influence the surviving fraction of cells that had been irradiated with 0.1 or 0.3 Gy (Figure\nFigure 3.

TGF-\u03b23 Binds to ALK1 to Remove HRS in Reporter Cells\nTo elucidate TGF-\u03b23 mediated removal of HRS in cells, we wanted to identify the receptor involved in this mechanism. While the TGF-\u03b2RII/ALK5 receptor complex is the best described for all three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, ALK1 has been identified as an alternative receptor for TGF-\u03b21/TGF-\u03b2RII, and TGF-\u03b23 has been assigned as a ligand to ALK1 [29,30]. We first tested whether ALK5 was involved in the function of TGF-\u03b23 on removal of HRS by adding an ALK5 inhibitor together with TGF-\u03b23 to cells prior to challenge irradiation. The resulting survival curve was consistent with removal of HRS (Figure 6a, Figure 7a), indicating that TGF-\u03b23 mediates its radioprotection by binding to another receptor. Next, we used K02288, a selective type BMP receptor inhibitor with effect on ALK1, ALK2 and ALK6, to investigate the involvement of these three receptors, and found that HRS was indeed removed (Figure 6b, Figure 7b). To exclude the involvement of ALK2 and ALK6, we tested LDN193189, a blocker of ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M, and found that this did not affect the ability of TGF-\u03b23 to remove HRS in reporter cells. Interestingly, inhibition of TGF-\u03b2RII with a neutralizing antibody had no effect on removal of HRS by TGF-\u03b23. Thus, TGF-\u03b23 appears to remove HRS through ALK1 by a mechanism independent of TGF-\u03b2RII.\nFigure 5. Survival of T-47D cells after pretreatment with MMP/ADAM inhibitor.

While the TGF-\u03b2RII/ALK5 receptor complex is the best described for all three TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, ALK1 has been identified as an alternative receptor for TGF-\u03b21/TGF-\u03b2RII, and TGF-\u03b23 has been assigned as a ligand to ALK1 [29,30]. We first tested whether ALK5 was involved in the function of TGF-\u03b23 on removal of HRS by adding an ALK5 inhibitor together with TGF-\u03b23 to cells prior to challenge irradiation. The resulting survival curve was consistent with removal of HRS (Figures 6a and 7a),\nInt. J. Mol.

Next, we used K02288, a selective type BMP receptor inhibitor with effect on ALK1, ALK2 and ALK6, to investigate the involvement of these three receptors, and found that HRS was indeed removed (Figures 6b and 7b). To exclude the involvement of ALK2 and ALK6, we tested LDN193189, a blocker of ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M, and found that this did not affect the ability of TGF-\u03b23 to remove HRS in reporter cells. Interestingly, inhibition of TGF-\u03b2RII with a neutralizing antibody had no effect on removal of HRS by TGF-\u03b23.

Similarly, inhibition of ALK1 and ALK5 together did not remove HRS. Together, these findings point to a competition between ALK1 and ALK5 for the ligand TGF-\u03b23, where ALK5 has the higher affinity, but ALK1 modifies the radiation response. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 (FKBP4), which was upregulated in sEVs from LDR primed cells, is known to associate with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to form steroid receptor heterocomplexes [31]. HSP90 has in turn been shown to interact with and stabilize ALK5 [32\u201334], and therefore, we considered the possibility that an increase in the FKBP4 concentration in LDR primed cells led to a decrease in the amount of HSP90 available to stabilize ALK5, leading to a condition similar to inhibition of ALK5 and thereby removal of HRS. However, addition of recombinant FKBP4 did not alter the radiosensitivity of T-47D cells or remove the HRS response (Figure S4)."

            "text": "We showed here that sEVs from LDR primed T-47D cells removed the HRS response to low-dose challenge irradiation in previously unirradiated reporter cells. This effect was equivalent to the one that was previously observed after pretreatment with LDR ICCM [21]. We also showed that removal of HRS via pretreatment with sEVs was dependent on TGF-\u03b23 and iNOS, as neutralizing antibody to TGF-\u03b23 or iNOS inhibitor 1400 W retained HRS in the reporter cells. The roles of TGF-\u03b23 and iNOS in removal of HRS via pretreatment with ICCM were previously established [24,35]. On this basis, we propose that removal of HRS with transfer of ICCM or sEVs is the same process, governed by sEVs in the cell medium. It is possible that the active factor(s) that removes HRS is secreted both in sEVs and via other secretion pathways. However, sEVs and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide a method of communication between cells where a specific selection of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids can be packaged and delivered together to the recipient cell. This could be the transfer mechanism for the factors necessary for removal of HRS. We have previously demonstrated that these factors include TGF-\u03b23, iNOS, IL13 and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212) [24,35,36], and in the present study, we have shown that a member of the MMP or ADAM protein families is included as activator of TGF-\u03b23. Several studies have shown sEVs and other EVs to be mediators of radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo [37] and in vitro [38,39]. AL-Mayah et al. observed that sEVs from unirradiated cells that exhibited bystander effects via sEVs transfer could in turn induce bystander effects in other unirradiated cells [40]. In previous studies, we concluded that TGF-\u03b23 was the active factor in ICCM that removed HRS in reporter cells. However, the HRS response was also removed from recipient cells by taking medium from unirradiated cells and LDR irradiating the medium without cells present with 0.3 Gy at 0.3 Gy/h [24], indicating a possibility of post-secretion activation of TGF-\u03b23. Thus, either the unirradiated control cells secrete TGF-\u03b23 in an inactive complex with the propeptide LAP, while the LDR primed cells secrete the activated form dissociated from LAP, or more likely, the LDR primed cells secrete the inactive complex with LAP together with something that induces activation. TGF-\u03b23 was detected in sEVs from both LDR primed and unirradiated cells. During MS/MS analysis, peptide fragments from a partially digested protein were counted and used to identify the protein. Digestion by trypsin cut the peptide into fragments next to the amino acids lysine (K) or arginine (R). When analyzing the content of sEVs from LDR primed and control T-47D cells, peptide fragments from both the propeptide LAP section (amino acid 1\u2013300) and the mature TGF-\u03b23 section (amino acid 300\u2013412) of the TGF-\u03b23 molecule were detected in similar amounts in both groups. The last amino acid in the LAP section was arginine, which is a potential cleavage site, even if TGF-\u03b23 was initially bound to LAP. It was, therefore, impossible to determine from the MS/MS analysis if the detected TGF-\u03b23 was in its active or latent form. However, since sEVs from unirradiated\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8147 11 of 18\ncontrol cells did not remove the HRS response in reporter cells, and sEVs from LDR primed cells only did so when TGF-\u03b23 was present and active, it is reasonable to believe that TGF-\u03b23 is the active factor in removal of HRS by transfer of sEVs from LDR primed cells. This supports the claim that TGF-\u03b23 is produced and secreted in sEVs regardless of priming irradiation, and that it is activated by LDR irradiation. In this case, several potential activation mechanisms should be considered, one of them being activation via endopeptidases or other proteins."

TIMPs are inhibitors of selected MMP/ADAM/ADAMTS proteins, which are possible activators of TGF-\u03b2 [12]. While TIMP1 was upregulated in LDR sEVs, TIMP2 mRNA was found to be significantly downregulated in LDR primed whole cells. This led us to explore the possibility that a shift in the balance of TIMP1 and TIMP2 through LDR irradiation could influence activation of TGF-\u03b23 via a change in the availability of specific MMPs/ADAMs/ADAMTSs. Inhibition of MMP/ADAMs in ICCM before transfer to reporter cells led to a surviving fraction after 0.1 Gy that was consistent with HRS, and lower than that of cells that had been treated with ICCM without the inhibitor. This points to an involvement of at least one member of either the MMP or ADAM protein families in the TGF-\u03b23 dependent mechanism of HRS removal. Of the MMPs that were detected either as proteins in sEVs or as mRNA in whole cells, MMP2 [16], MMP13 [18] and MMP14 [41] are known to activate TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22, and could possibly activate TGF-\u03b23 considering their similarity. In addition, MMP9 has been shown to activate TGF-\u03b23 [17] and is another possible candidate, although it was not detected in either of our analyses. While TIMP1 and TIMP2 have similar effects on most MMPs, they differ in their action on MMP14, which is inactivated by TIMP2, but not by TIMP1 [42]. Therefore, we conclude that at least one protein in the MMP or ADAM families is responsible for activation of TGF-\u03b23 and removal of HRS, and consider MMP2, MMP9, MMP13 and MMP14 to be likely candidates."

Therefore, we first tested inhibition of ALK5 using ALK5 inhibitor SB431542, which did not alter the effect of TGF-\u03b23 on HRS. SB431542 is also an inhibitor of ALK4 and ALK7 [43], so the involvement of either of these receptors with TGF-\u03b23 in modifying HRS appears to be unlikely. We then tested inhibitor K02288, a blocker of ALK1, ALK2, and to some degree ALK6. In this case, a full HRS response was seen. To exclude involvement of ALK2 and ALK6, LDN193189, a blocker of ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 was also tested, and we conclude that ALK1 is the most likely receptor mediating the effect of TGF-\u03b23 on HRS. TGF-\u03b23 has previously been shown to be a ligand to ALK1 [30]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a cellular function of TGF-\u03b23 to depend on ALK1 activity independently of ALK5 and TGF-\u03b2RII. ALK5 and ALK1 activate different Smad pathways. While activated, ALK5 phosphorylates Smad 2/3, whereas activated ALK1 phosphorylates Smad 1/5/8 [44,45]. TGF-\u03b21 has been shown to regulate the activation state of the endothelium via a fine balance between ALK5 and ALK1 signaling. Whereas the TGF-\u03b21/ALK5 pathway led to inhibition of cell migration and proliferation [46], the TGF- \u03b21/ALK1 pathway induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation. However, another group found that ALK1 signaling inhibited the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [47]. Increased ALK1/ALK5 ratio has also been seen to correlate with MMP13 expression in age-dependent osteoarthritis. During angiogenesis, ALK1 and ALK5 signaling pathways in endothelial cells have been found to play a crucial role in determining vascular endothelial properties [48].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 8147 12 of 18\nThe type II TGF-\u03b2 receptors function primarily as binding receptors. On binding their ligand, type II receptors associate with and phosphorylate type I receptors, which in turn activate downstream Smad proteins. TGF-\u03b2RII is the only type II receptor that has been shown to interact with TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b23 [49]. TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 use ALK5 as a type I receptor in most cells after first binding to TGF-\u03b2RII, but ALK1 has also been shown to be activated by TGF-\u03b21 in complex with TGF-\u03b2RII in endothelial cells [48]. The effect of TGF-\u03b23 on HRS did not appear to be prevented by inhibiting TGF-\u03b2RII, suggesting that TGF-\u03b23 either binds ALK 1 directly or uses another type II receptor. However, TGF-\u03b2RII has no close human relatives [15]. Park et al. found that TGF-\u03b2RII was not relevant to ALK1 signaling, as TGF-\u03b2RII-conditional deletion did not affect vessel morphogenesis in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) in mice. They suggested that impaired signaling through TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands outside of the TGF-\u03b2 subfamily was involved in HHT2 pathogenesis [49]."

Interestingly, adding ALK5 inhibitor without TGF-\u03b23 also led to removal of the HRS response. However, when anti-TGF-\u03b23 neutralizing antibody was added concurrently, the HRS response was retained. We interpret these findings as ALK5 and ALK1 competing for TGF-\u03b23, suggesting a low presence of active TGF-\u03b23 even in unirradiated T-47D cells, which is normally scavenged by ALK5. When the function of ALK5 is inhibited, the amount of TGF-\u03b23 available for ALK1 binding reaches a level where ALK1 is activated and HRS is removed. In light of these results, ALK5 inhibition, as an alternative to activation of TGF-\u03b23, emerges as a possible mechanism of removal of HRS in reporter cells. In the proteomic analysis, FKBP4 was found to be upregulated in sEVs from LDR primed cells compared to controls. FKBP4 could potentially function as an indirect inhibitor of ALK5 through its association with HSP90, a known stabilizer of ALK5 [31\u201334]. However, the radiosensitivity of T-47D cells was not altered after pretreatment with FKBP4, an indication that it is not involved in the removal of HRS through LDR priming."

HRS is observed in healthy as well as cancerous cell lines [1\u20136]. It is, therefore, of interest to investigate modification of low-dose radiosensitivity not only in cancer cell lines, but also in normal cells. An accurate and extensive understanding of these mechanisms in both types of tissue could potentially permit an improvement of the therapeutic ratio by manipulating their response to low-dose IR."

Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 2000) were acquired in the Orbitrap with the resolution R = 60,000 at m/z 400 (after accumulation to a target of 1,000,000 charges in the LTQ). The method used allowed for the sequential isolation of up to the seven most intense ions, depending on signal intensity, for fragmentation on the linear ion trap using collision-induced dissociation at a target value of 10,000 charges. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 60 s. The lock mass option was enabled in MS mode for internal recalibration during the analysis. Other instrument parameters were set as previously described [57]."

Log-odds of whether the genes were differentially transcribed (B-statistics) were used to rank the genes. p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery [60].

            "text": "Our current paper investigated the TGF-\u03b23 dependent mechanism of removal of HRS through LDR priming of cells. We found that TGF-\u03b23 was secreted in similar amounts in sEVs from LDR primed and control cells and did not detect TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b22 in sEVs. Whereas sEVs from unirradiated control cells did not affect the radiosensitivity of reporter cells, sEVs from LDR primed cells removed HRS upon subsequent challenged irradiation. We conclude that TGF-\u03b23 is secreted in an inactive complex with LAP from cells regardless of priming, but with an activating factor from cells that have been LDR primed. Our results show that HRS is not removed from reporter cells if proteins from the MMP and ADAM protein families are inhibited, identifying these as probable activators of TGF-\u03b23 in this mechanism. We demonstrated for the first time a cellular function of TGF-\u03b23 to depend on the receptor ALK1 in the removal of HRS. This function was independent on ALK5 and TGF\u03b2RII. We also revealed a competition between ALK1 and ALK5 for binding TGF-\u03b23, where ALK5 had higher affinity for the ligand, but ALK1 mediated the radioprotective effect.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms23158147/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: I.H.\u2014Investigation, formal analysis, data curation, visualization and writing\u2014original draft; K.E.P.\u2014Conceptualization; U.A.\u2014Conceptualization and validation; C\u030c.A.\u2014Conceptualization and validation; E.M.\u2014Funding acquisition, project administration, resources, supervision and writing\u2014review and editing; N.F.J.E.\u2014Conceptualization, methodology, investigation, formal analysis, funding acquisition, project administration, resources, supervision and writing\u2014review and editing.
