1. **Investigate the relationship between the psychophysiological state of CP children during RAGT and the effectiveness of the therapy.** This could be done by measuring the children's engagement, motivation, and adherence to the therapy, and then examining how these factors relate to their clinical outcomes.


2. **Develop a standardized protocol for using IRT to assess the psychophysiological state of CP children during RAGT.** This would allow clinicians to use IRT in a consistent and reliable way, and would help to ensure that the results of different studies are comparable.


3. **Explore the use of IRT to monitor the psychophysiological state of CP children during other types of rehabilitation therapies.** This could help to identify the therapies that are most effective for individual children, and could also help to track the children's progress over time.


4. **Investigate the use of IRT to assess the psychophysiological state of children with other neurological conditions.** This could help to identify new ways to improve the rehabilitation of these children.


5. **Develop a mobile IRT system that can be used to monitor the psychophysiological state of CP children in their home environment.** This would allow clinicians to track the children's progress over time and to identify any problems that may arise.
