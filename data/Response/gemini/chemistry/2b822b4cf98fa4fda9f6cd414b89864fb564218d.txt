1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the overexpression of MDM2 in LGG cancer:** 
   - Conduct in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in MDM2 overexpression.
   - Identify potential therapeutic targets that can modulate MDM2 expression or activity.


2. **Explore the role of MDM2 in LGG cancer stem cells:** 
   - Investigate the expression of MDM2 in LGG cancer stem cells and its contribution to tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy.
   - Determine whether targeting MDM2 can inhibit cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumor growth.


3. **Evaluate the potential of MDM2 inhibitors in combination with other therapeutic agents:** 
   - Investigate the synergistic effects of MDM2 inhibitors with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy in LGG cancer models.
   - Determine the optimal dosing and scheduling of combination therapies to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.


4. **Develop novel MDM2 inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity:** 
   - Utilize structure-based drug design and high-throughput screening approaches to identify new chemical entities that target MDM2.
   - Optimize the lead compounds to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors in LGG cancer patients:** 
   - Design and conduct Phase I/II clinical trials to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors in patients with LGG cancer.
   - Evaluate the potential biomarkers that can predict response to MDM2 inhibition and monitor treatment efficacy.
