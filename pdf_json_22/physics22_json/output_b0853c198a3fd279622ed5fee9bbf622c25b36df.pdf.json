            "text": "Strong gravitational lensing by galaxies is a valuable tool for studying cosmology and extragalactic astronomy. Since lensing is sensitive to the total mass distribution of the galaxy, including both baryonic and dark matter, it serves as a unique probe of galaxies\u2019 internal structure. Strong lensing has been used to study the total density profile (e.g., Koopmans et al. 2006; Koopmans et al. 2009; Auger et al. 2010), the stellar initial mass function (e.g., Treu et al. 2010; Sonnenfeld et al. 2019), and the distribution of dark matter subhalos around the lens galaxy (e.g., Vegetti et al. 2010; Vegetti et al. 2012; Vegetti et al. 2014; Nierenberg et al. 2014; Nierenberg et al. 2017; Gilman et al. 2020), among other properties. Lensed quasars can also be used to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant (Refsdal 1964), through a measurement of their time delays, providing an important independent measure of the expansion rate of the Universe (e.g., Wong et al. 2020; Birrer et al. 2020).\nHowever, strong lensing is a relatively rare phenomenon, requiring a chance alignment between a foreground massive galaxy or galaxy cluster with a bright background source. Because of their rarity, deep and wide imaging surveys are required to build statistical samples of strong lenses. In particular, lenses at intermediate redshifts (0.3<\u223c zL<\u223c 1.0) are important for studying the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.\nThe recently-completed Hyper Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP; Aihara et al. 2018) is an ideal dataset for discovering new gravitational lenses from deep multiband imaging data across a wide area of the sky. The HSC SSP covers a large area (> 1000 deg2) in the grizy bands to a depth (i \u223c 26.2) greater than comparable surveys (e.g., Dark Energy Survey). Our ongoing lens search, the Survey of Gravitationally lensed objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI), has already resulted in hundreds of new gravitational lens candidates at both the galaxy scale (SuGOHI-g; Sonnenfeld et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2018; Sonnenfeld et al. 2020) and the galaxy group/cluster scale (SuGOHI-c; Jaelani et al. 2020), including a number of lensed quasar candidates (SuGOHI-q; Chan et al. 2020). These lenses have been found through a variety of search methodologies, including automated algorithms, visual inspection, citizen science, and machine learning methods.\nIn this paper, we apply the YattaLens algorithm (Sonnenfeld et al. 2018) to the latest data release of the HSC SSP, covering 1310 deg2 of the sky. YattaLens is a proven method that has been used in the past on\nHSC SSP data to discover new galaxy-scale lenses (e.g., Sonnenfeld et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2018). Starting with a catalog of known massive galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we use YattaLens to automatically identify potential lens candidates in the multiband imaging data, which are then visually inspected and evaluated to find the most promising systems.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the imaging and spectroscopic data used in this study. Section 3 describes our lens search methodology. In Section 4, we present our newly-discovered strong lens candidates. We summarize our results and conclusions in Section 5. All magnitudes given are on the AB system. All images are oriented with North up and East to the left."

The BOSS sample consists primarily of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) out to a redshift of z <\u223c 0.7. The redshifts used in this study come from Data Release 15 (Aguado et al. 2019). In principle, this search could be scaled up to any input catalog of objects, with or without spectroscopic redshifts. We use the BOSS LRG sample because these are the most massive galaxies, and therefore are more likely to be strong lenses due to their large lensing cross-section, as well as the fact that they have existing spectroscopy that could be valuable for follow-up."

            "text": "We use the lens-finding algorithm YattaLens (Sonnenfeld et al. 2018) to select lens candidates from our input catalog. Here, we briefly describe the YattaLens algorithm and the settings we use to run it.\nWe start by obtaining cutouts roughly 10\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 60\u00d7 60 pixels at the HSC pixel scale) in size centered on each of the input objects in the gri bands, as well as the corresponding point spread functions (PSF). YattaLens fits an elliptical de Vaucouleurs profile (de Vaucouleurs 1948) to the i-band image within a 3\u2032\u2032 radius region around the center of the galaxy. The best-fit profile is then convolved with the PSF and subtracted from all three bands. YattaLens then calls SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to search the lens-subtracted g-band cutout for objects that could be lensed arcs using the following criteria:\n1. Distance from the lens center between 3 and 30 pixels\n(roughly 0.\u2032\u20325<R< 5.\u2032\u20320).\n2. Major-to-minor axis ratio > 1.4. 3. Maximum difference of 30\u25e6 between the position an-\ngle of the major axis of the object and the direction tangential to a circle centered on the lens and passing through the object centroid. 4. Minimum angular aperture (the angle subtended by\nthe object as measured from the lens centroid) of 25\u25e6.\n5. A footprint size between 20 and 500 pixels.\nObjects that satisfy all of these criteria are considered to be potential lensed arcs. If at least one candidate arc is detected, the objects detected in the g-band are masked out in the corresponding i-band image and the main galaxy is fit again, this time with a more flexible\nSe\u0301rsic profile. Additional non-arc-like objects in the iband image are either fit with a Se\u0301rsic profile if it is within 1.3 times the distance of the farthest arc candidate from the lens, or are masked out of it is further away.\nYattaLens then applies a color cut of g\u2212 i < 2.0 to the lensed arc candidates. This cut removes satellite galaxies that happen to be elongated tangential to the lens galaxy, which is a frequent source of contamination. The object fluxes in the g and i-bands are measured by summing over the pixels in the g-band footprint from SExtractor, factoring in an additional 20% systematic uncertainty that accounts for residuals in the lens light subtraction. Different objects are considered to be multiple lensed images of the same source if their g\u2212 i color is consistent within 2\u03c3. Other arc-like objects with a different color that are within 1.3 times the distance of the farthest arc candidate from the lens are classified as foreground objects and are fitted with a Se\u0301rsic profile. Further-away objects are masked out. This process is then repeated for non-arc-like objects.\nEach set of arcs is then fit with a simple lens model consisting of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE). The source light is modeled as a circular exponential profile. The mass centroid is fixed to the lens light centroid. The model\u2019s free parameters are the lens Einstein radius, lens axis ratio and associated position angle, the source position, source effective radius, and the amplitude of the lens, source, and foreground objects\u2019 surface brightness distributions. Foreground objects are treated as massless and do not contribute to the lens potential. The maximum-likelihood model fit is found using a modified version of the code developed by Auger et al. (2011). We do not report the lens model parameters, as YattaLens is designed purely for identifying lens candidates rather than detailed modeling, and the best-fit parameters can often be substantially off from the true values (A. Sonnenfeld, private communication).\nYattaLens also fits the image with a ring galaxy model and a Se\u0301rsic model with disky/boxy isophotes to see if either can fit the data better than the lens model. This filters out common interlopers such as spiral arms and elongated foreground galaxies. If the lens model has a higher \u03c72 than the ring or Se\u0301rsic models for each set of multiple image candidates, the object is deemed to not be a lens, otherwise it is considered to be a legitimate lens candidate. We refer the reader to Sonnenfeld et al. (2018), particularly Figures 1 and 2, for visual examples of this procedure.\nAfter running YattaLens on the 103191 objects in the input catalog, we are left with 2319 lens candidates."

The \u03c72 information from YattaLens is not used as part of the scoring procedure. The 2319 candidates were initially split into two subsamples, which were each scored independently by four graders. After this initial round of scoring, candidates that were unanimously agreed to be non-lenses were removed, and the remaining candidates were then scored by all eight graders. The scores were then compiled and averaged, and the scores given by each grader were revealed and compared. Graders were then allowed to discuss individual candidates and adjust their scores, particularly for controversial objects where the scores were discrepant or were close to the boundary of a lens grade. The final classification of candidates is based on their mean score according to the following scheme, which has been used in previous SuGOHI publications:\n\u2022 A (definite lens): \u3008score\u3009> 2.5 \u2022 B (probable lens): 2.5\u2265 \u3008score\u3009> 1.5 \u2022 C (possible lens): 1.5\u2265 \u3008score\u3009> 0.5 \u2022 D (non-lens): \u3008score\u3009 \u2264 0.5"

The new lens candidates have spectroscopic lens redshifts spanning the range 0.3 \u2264 zL \u2264 0.9. For comparison, we show the redshift distribution of our 36 grade A and grade B lenses in Figure 4 along with the 106 previously-identified galaxy-galaxy lens candidates with grades A or B from the SuGOHI-g sample (Sonnenfeld et al. 2018; Sonnenfeld et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2018; Jaelani et al. 2020) that have known lens redshifts. For completeness, we list the\ngrade C lens candidates in the Appendix.\nWe search the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database1 (NED) to see if spectroscopic source redshifts have been found for any of our grade A and B candidates. We also check recent lens searches (Section 4.1) for spectroscopic source redshift measurements. These are indicated in Table 1 where available. Interestingly, the three cases in which a source redshift is known are all grade B. While the knowledge of a source redshift in these cases should, in principle, serve as strong evidence for the lensing nature of these objects (enough to elevate them to grade A), we report the original grade for consistency. This, along with the somewhat lower proportion of grade A/B/C lenses relative to Sonnenfeld et al. (2018) and Wong et al. (2018), does suggest that our grading is conservative in that the likelihood of a candidate being a lens may be higher than their grade suggests."

We have indicated these candidates and cited the appropriate references in Table 1. While some of these previous searches graded the lens candidates in a similar way to this study, they are often based on lower-quality data or used a slightly different grading scheme.

            "text": "We compare the statistics of lens candidates selected in this paper to previous searches in the HSC SSP using YattaLens. The Sonnenfeld et al. (2018) sample includes candidates selected through other methods, so it\u2019s not quite a fair comparison to this work. Wong et al. (2018) used YattaLens to analyze \u223c 31000\n1 http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/\nLRGs and identify 772 candidates, while this paper analyzes 103191 LRGs and returns 2319 candidates, which is a comparable rate. After inspection, Wong et al. (2018) finds 200 definite/probable/possible candidates out of 776, while this paper finds 174 such candidates out of 2319. This difference can be partially explained by our pre-selection, which removed \u223c 150 known and previously-selected candidates from entire SuGOHI sample of galaxy-scale lenses. Had these systems not been filtered out, many of them likely would have been identified by YattaLens and graded as possible candidates. The lower rate in this paper may also be partially due to more conservative scoring, as was suggested in Section 4.1.\nIt is difficult to directly compare the number lens candidates found in various surveys due to different survey depths, image quality, and area, as well as differences in the criteria used to judge the quality of a lens candidate. Nevertheless, we can comment on a few comparable datasets and the size of the of lens candidate samples from them to the SuGOHI-g sample to give a broad overview of where our sample stands in relation to them. Restricting the sample to galaxy-galaxy lenses with a grade of either A, B, or C from SuGOHI publications (i.e., not including external publications such as Can\u0303ameras et al. 2021, Shu et al. 2022, etc.), we have identified 1464 lens candidates (of which 282 are grade A or B) to date in the HSC SSP in 1310 deg2 through the latest data release. By comparison, a search for strong lenses2 in the\n2 https://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/DR4/hqlenses.php\nKilo-Degree Survey found 268 \u201chigh-quality\u201d candidates (Petrillo et al. 2019; Li et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021) in \u223c1350 deg2. A search through \u223c 30000 deg2 in Pan-STARRS by Can\u0303ameras et al. (2020) found 353 candidates with a grade roughly equivalent to our grade A and B lenses. Finally, the survey most comparable to the HSC SSP is the Dark Energy Survey, in which lens searches through \u223c 5000 deg2 have yielded \u223c 500 \u201cprobable\u201d lenses and \u223c 750 \u201cpossible\u201d lenses (Jacobs et al. 2019), with an additional 186 candidates identified by Rojas et al. (2021). In this context, the HSC SSP is quite competitive in number of lens candidates identified relative to survey area. It should be noted again that the greater depth of the HSC SSP makes us more likely to detect fainter and higherredshift lenses, which fills a valuable niche."

Only a handful of galaxy-scale DSPLs been discovered so far, including one spectroscopicallyconfirmed system from the HSC SSP (the\u201cEye of Horus\u201d; Tanaka et al. 2016).\nThe large northern arc in HSCJ234114+031506 is an obvious lensed feature, but it is unclear whether the compact image just south of the lens galaxy is the counterimage of this arc, or of the other nearby clump (northeast of the lens galaxy) interior to the arc.
