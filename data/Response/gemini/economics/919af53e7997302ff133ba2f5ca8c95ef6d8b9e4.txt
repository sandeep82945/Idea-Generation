1. **Investigate the effectiveness of different financial incentive policies in controlling the spread of infectious diseases.** This could involve comparing the cost-effectiveness of different policies, such as those that provide a lump sum payment to those who test positive for an infectious disease versus those that provide a series of smaller payments over time.


2. **Explore the use of financial incentives to encourage people to get vaccinated against infectious diseases.** This could involve studying the impact of different incentive amounts and structures on vaccination rates, as well as the cost-effectiveness of vaccination incentive programs.


3. **Develop methods for estimating the total cost of financial incentive programs for controlling infectious diseases.** This could involve developing mathematical models or conducting simulations to estimate the costs of different incentive policies, taking into account factors such as the number of people who are infected, the cost of testing and treatment, and the economic impact of the disease.


4. **Study the ethical implications of using financial incentives to control the spread of infectious diseases.** This could involve examining issues such as fairness, equity, and the potential for coercion.


5. **Investigate the use of financial incentives to encourage people to adopt healthy behaviors that can help to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.** This could involve studying the impact of financial incentives on behaviors such as handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing.
