conclusion The MAOStress response of PVA-Borax was thoroughly studied, showing that stress-controlled measurements can offer another route for testing the weakly nonlinear regime and answer fundamental questions regarding the origins of nonlinearity in viscoelastic materials. The MAOStress results confirmed the stiffening nature of PVA-Borax and showed that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength across a wide range of De, consistent with the microstructure of PVA-Borax. Moreover, the measured linearity limits can be interpreted as Pipkin map regime boundaries, offering experimental testing and validation of theoretical predictions. The SSTNM model was used to derive a viable normalization of the nonlinear MAOStress material functions that account for their scaling with the linear material properties. The frequency dependence of the normalized material functions revealed a simplicity in the features of MAOStress material functions compared to MAOStrain. The intrinsic nonlinearities were used to derive a threshold-independent critical forcing amplitude and to show that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength as its frequency variability at the emergence of nonlinearity is much smaller than MAOStrain. This fundamental result should be considered when studying deformation-induced physical phenomena at different timescales or frequencies. Moreover, this result has significant implications for small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements (SAOS). A common practice for choosing a strain or stress amplitude for a linear SAOS measurement is to do an amplitude sweep at different frequencies and choose a strain or stress in different frequency ranges with a good signal-to-noise ratio without being in the nonlinear regime. With the insights from section IV, it may suffice to only do an amplitude sweep at each end of the frequency range to find a suitable stress amplitude for the entire frequency range of a measurement.
