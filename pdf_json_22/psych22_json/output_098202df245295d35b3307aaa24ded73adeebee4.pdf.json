    "abstractText": "Objective The early expression of lifespan health and disease states can often be detected in early childhood. Currently, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS R ) includes over 300 measures of health for individuals ages 5 years and older. We extended PROMIS to early childhood by creating developmentally appropriate, lifespan coherent parent-report measures for 1\u20135-year-olds. This paper describes the psychometric approaches used for these efforts; Methods 2 waves of data from parents of children ages 1\u20135 were collected via 2 internet panel companies. Wave 1 data (n1\u20444 1,400) were used to evaluate item pool unidimensionality, model fit, and initial item parameters. Combined data from wave 1 and wave 2 (reference sample; n1\u20444 1,057) were used to estimate final item parameters. Using item response theory methods, we developed and tested 12 item pools: Global Health, Physical Activity, Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-related Impairment, Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Positive Affect, SelfRegulation, Engagement, Family Relationships, and Peer Relationships; Results Wave 1 analyses supported the unidimensionality of Physical Activity, Positive Affect, Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, and Global Health. Family Relationships and Peer Relationships were combined to form \u201cSocial Relationships\u201d; Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-related Impairment were combined to form \u201cSleep Problems.\u201d Self-Regulation was divided into \u201cFlexibility\u201d and \u201cFrustration Tolerance\u201d; Engagement was divided into \u201cCuriosity\u201d and \u201cPersistence.\u201d Short forms were developed for item banks with more than 10 items; and Conclusions Using rigorous mixed-methods, we successfully extended PROMIS to early childhood (1\u20135-year-olds). Measures are now publicly available in English and Spanish (www.healthmeasures.net).",

National and international efforts to understand children\u2019s health often rely on large-scale\npopulation-based surveys. For example, the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (Blumberg et al., 2012) provides snapshots of U.S. children\u2019s health across a range of conditions and contextual factors (e.g., social determinants of health), and aggregated metrics based on vital statistics, clinical records, and administrative\nVC The Author(s) 2022.

Conversely, there are many validated\u2014but lengthy\u2014developmentally based assessment tools to conduct deeper and dimensional phenotyping of specific health conditions, precursors, and underlying processes (Halle & Darling-Churchill, 2016). However, these rarely include systematic consideration of quality of life and related health constructs in a unified measurement system (Coghill et al., 2009).\nGiven our experiences in the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMISV R\n; Cella et al., 2008, 2010) and other similar measurement systems (e.g., Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders; Neuro-QoLTM; Lai et al., 2012), we set out to create parent-report measures to capture quality of life and related health constructs of children aged 1\u20135 years, as described in Cella et al. (in this issue). These developmentally sensitive measures were created with item response theory (IRT) models for calibration and norming to overcome measurement challenges of monitoring children\u2019s quality of life and related health constructs across developmental phases in a psychometrically sound manner. These measure applications include computer adaptive tests (CATs), in which the most informative items of respondents\u2019 trait levels (e.g., function, well-being) are selected and administered based on participants\u2019 responses to the previously administered item from a \u201cbank\u201d of items. Also, fixed-length short forms (SFs) (Lai, Butt, et al., 2011; Lai, Cella, et al., 2011; Pilkonis et al., 2011) can be customized from these calibrated item banks to consist the most relevant questions for a given context. Both CATs and SFs can produce brief-yet-precise score estimations that are comparable to scores produced by the corresponding full-length item bank. Subsequently, investigators can administer measures tapping multiple key domains of interests without adding significant response burden. The PROMIS provides a well-validated framework for advancing this goal. However, until now, PROMIS only extends down to age 5.\nThe overarching aim of the PROMIS Early Childhood (EC) initiative was to fill this assessment void by generating and validating psychometrically sound and developmentally appropriate PROMIS parent report measures that can be used in large-scale research studies and clinical practice to evaluate physical, mental, and social health outcomes of 1\u20135-year-olds.\nSee Blackwell et al. (2020) for conceptual considerations of this initiative. See Cella et al. (this issue) for a discussion on the general qualitative approaches used to develop the PROMIS EC measures.

            "text": "The sampling strategy was designed to (a) ensure variability across participants whose scores are spread across the measurement continuum of the targeted domains, such that resulting item parameters are more stable across different sample groups (i.e., wave 1 data collection) and (b) establish population-based reference values (i.e., wave 2 data collection).\nTo accomplish these goals, we enlisted two internet survey panel companies, Op4G and Ipsos, to partner with us in the collection of two waves of data. The primary goal of the wave 1 testing was to determine items to be included in item banks or calibrated scales. Op4G, an internet panel company, was chosen because of previously successful collaborations for PROMIS pediatric measurement development initiatives (e.g., Paller et al., 2021) in which they were able to recruit sufficient diverse samples within a reasonable timeline. The purpose of wave 2 testing was to finalize item calibrations and establish norms. Ipsos, an internal panel company, was chosen because they have the largest nationally representative probabilitybased panel. Inclusion criteria for both wave 1 and wave 2 were: (a) 18 years or older; (b) parent (i.e., biological, foster, adoptive, or step-parent) of at least one child aged 12 months to 5 years, 11 months, 30 days at the time of survey collection; and (c) able to read and respond in English. All participants provided informed consent via the panel companies prior to completing surveys (as described below), and Northwestern received deidentified data.\nThe wave 1 sample consisted of 1,400 parents of children ages 1\u20135 years (ages 1\u20133 years: n\u00bc 700; ages 4\u20135: n\u00bc 700) recruited by Op4G through its partnership with nonprofit organizations. When a member joins the Op4G panel, they complete a demographic questionnaire, which is used for targeting individuals for participation in specific research projects. For this study, Op4G identified English-speaking parents in the U.S. with children in the desired age range to complete the wave 1 survey. Those parents then received an e-mail notifying them of a new survey opportunity. Parents were screened to ensure they had a child who\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jpepsy/article/47/5/510/6565719 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 16 January 2024\nmet the age inclusion criteria, and, if they agreed to participate, they were randomly assigned to either survey form A or form B. This strategy was taken to lessen respondent burden. Form A (n\u00bc85 items) covered the domains of Family Relationships, Peer Relationships, Physical Activity, Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-Related Impairment, and Global Health; form B (n\u00bc 109 items) covered Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Positive Affect, Engagement, Self-Regulation, and Global Health. Both forms also included two checklists for parents to identify if their child had (a) any physical health conditions or (b) any emotional or behavioral conditions or developmental disorders (EBD) such as anxiety, attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder. Figure 1 shows the number of items included in each item pool in wave 1 testing. Data collection ended when sample composition matched the ratio of race, sex, and education of the 2010 U.S. Census. No response rate was estimated by Op4G.\nThe wave 2 sample included 1,057 parents of children ages 1\u20135 years who were recruited by Ipsos. Ipsos hosts the longest-standing all-online research panel that is representative of the entire U.S. population. The Ipsos \u201cKnowledgePanel\u201d includes more than 55,000 members who are randomly recruited through probability sampling. If needed, households are provided with Internet access and a computer. Ipsos recruits panel members by using address-based sampling methods. Once household members are recruited for the panel and assigned to a study sample, they are notified by email for survey participation; panelists can also visit their online member page for survey opportunity updates. This allows surveys to be fielded quickly, economically, and with less burden on participants. Final data were weighted using the Ipsos standard categories: sex (male, female), age (18\u201329, 30\u2013 34, 35\u201339, 40\u00fe years), race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic, 2\u00fe races), census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), metropolitan status (metro, nonmetro), education (less than high school/high school, some college, bachelor or higher), and household income (under $25,000, $25\u2013$49,999, $50\u2013 $74,999, $75\u2013$99,999, $100\u2013$149,999, $150,000 and over). Weights-matched parents who were at least 18-year-old with one or more children of ages 1\u20135 from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s March 2018 Current Population Survey. More information regarding weighting and how wave 2 reflected the general U.S. population is available upon request. Unlike the wave 1 sample who completed all items (including those subsequently excluded) on some domains, the wave 2 sample completed items on all domains resulting from the end of wave 1 testing (see Figure 1). We took this approach to evaluate statistical relationships across\ndomains to further refine measures. With the consideration of response burden, for measures consisting of more than eight items, an 8-item SF was created and administered in wave 2 testing. More detailed information about the SF item section process can be found in the domain-specific papers in this special section. The wave 2 sample also completed the same health conditions checklists as in wave 1. The reported response rate was 43%."

            "text": "Two stages of data analyses were conducted (see Figure 2). Using data from wave 1 testing, we evaluated the dimensionality of item pools to determine the number of measures to develop. We then evaluated measurement stability between subsamples and estimated measure item parameters to construct the SFs to be used in wave 2 testing. Wave 2 data were then used, in combination with wave 1 data, to finalize item parameters and establish reference values. Some specific analytic approaches varied across domains, but underlying measurement principles and analytic goals were the same. We describe here the general analytical approaches taken, with other details provided in the domain-specific manuscripts. For the final measures, we refer to calibrated item sets of 10 or more items as \u201citem banks\u201d; those with fewer than 10 items are referred to as \u201ccalibrated scales.\u201d This is the PROMIS arbitrary semantic distinction; item banks and calibrated scales were developed using the same psychometric standards and can be administered using the same approaches (e.g., SFs and CAT).\nWave 1 Analyses The first part of the wave 1 analyses focused on evaluation of the unidimensionality of item pools using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We applied EFA to obtain a quantitative sense of the dimensionality of proposed item sets. We explored the number of potential factors using the following criteria: (a) number of factors with eigenvalue > 1; (b) review of the scree plot (i.e., number of factors before the break in scree plot); (c) percentage of variance explained by eigenvalue 1 (criterion: 40); (d) ratio of eigenvalue 1-to-2 (criterion: 4); and (e) number of factors that explain >5% of variance (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2008; Lai et al., 2006; Lai, Zelko, et al., 2011). A promax rotation with polychoric correlations was then used to examine the association among factors and items and to examine item loadings (criterion: >0.4). Promax rotation was chosen to allow factors to be correlated so we could explore potential multidimensionality among items. Polychoric correlations were implemented to adjust for the ordinal nature of the item response data. Either SAS 9.4 (Gary, NC: SAS Institute) or\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jpepsy/article/47/5/510/6565719 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 16 January 2024\nMplus v7.4 (Los Angeles, CA: Muthen & Muthen) was used to conduct EFA modeling analyses.\nIf items within the item pool had hypothesized factor structures available, CFAs were conducted to test the hypothesized structure using the weighted least square-mean and variance adjusted estimator with polychoric correlations, as is recommended for ordinal response data (Muthen et al., 1997). Item sets were considered unidimensional, with their items retained in the item pool, when the following criteria were met: comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.9; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.10; R2 > 0.30; residual correlations < 0.20 (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2008; Lai et al., 2006; Lai, Zelko, et al., 2011). We employed Mplus v7.4 to conduct CFA modeling analyses.\nBi-factor analysis (BFA; McDonald, 1999), in the CFA family, was used to evaluate sufficient unidimensionality when we took subdomains into account (i.e., for Social Relationships and Sleep Problems). The BFA specifies a general factor (defined by loadings from all included items) and local factors (or subdomains, defined by loadings from prespecified groups of items related to their subdomains). The general factor and local factors are modeled as orthogonal; therefore, the relationship between items and the general factor is not constrained to be proportional to the relationship between first- and second-order factors, as demonstrated in other hierarchical CFAs. When the general factor explains the covariance between items, uniformly high standardized item loadings on the general factor are observed; it is then appropriate to\nFigure 1. Domains and number of items across wave 1 and wave 2 testing. aFamily Relationships and Peer Relationships were combined into one Social Relationships item bank. Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-related Impairment were combined into one Sleep Problems item bank. Self-regulation was separated into Flexibility and Frustration Tolerance calibrated scales. Engagement was separated into Curiosity and Persistence calibrated scales. bFull-length: number of items included in the final PROMIS EC measures. Measures with 10 or more items are named \u201citem banks.\u201d Measures with less than 10 items are named \u201ccalibrated scales.\u201d cTesting: number of items used for wave 2 testing.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jpepsy/article/47/5/510/6565719 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 16 January 2024\nreport a single score representing the domain of interest. If the subdomains represent demonstrably separate concepts, loadings on the general factor will not be uniformly high, and we reject the conclusion that the item set was sufficiently unidimensional, making it more appropriate to report scores of subdomains separately (Lai, Butt, et al., 2011; Lai et al., 2006). Sufficient unidimensionality was confirmed when factor loadings to local factors were less than those to the general factor and the BFA model had acceptable fit indices (i.e., CFI > 0.90; RMSEA < 0.10; R2 > 0.30; residual correlations < 0.20). Additionally, variance explained by the general factor should be greater than that explained by local factors if sufficient unidimensionality is supported.\nThe second part of wave 1 analyses focused on IRT modeling and item misfit. We modeled responses to candidate item sets using the graded response model (GRM; Samejima, 1997) as implemented in IRTPRO v3.1 (Chapel Hill, NC: Vector Psychometric Group). We defined item misfit as occurring when the item fit test ratio of chi-squared to degrees of freedom was >3.0 (Cris\u0327an et al., 2017; Stark et al., 2006).\nItem parameters were used to estimate item information functions at both the level of individual items and\nthe level of the entire item bank, in order to characterize the precision of items and the overall scale across the measurement continuum. Items with higher information function values are more likely to be chosen by computerized adaptive testing (CAT), given their high precision and reduced error rate at measuring the domain of interest. For a measure with more than eight items, we constructed an 8-item SF to be included in the wave 2 testing with consideration of response burden. Items were chosen by the study team of clinicians and measurement experts based on the item\u2019s clinicalrepresentative and information function value that provided the best attainable score-level reliabilities across our targeted T-score range. We also simulated CAT administration for item banks with more than eight items using the following settings: (a) minimum number of items to administer\u00bc4; (b) maximum number of items to administer\u00bc 8; and (c) SE stopping criterion: < 0.4.\nDifferential item functioning (DIF). We investigated stability of measurement properties of items by evaluating DIF on the factors of developmental differences for toddlers versus preschoolers (1\u20132-year-olds vs. 3\u2013 5-year-olds), parent\u2019s sex (female vs. male), and child\u2019s sex (female vs. male) using data from the full-length\nFigure 2.

However, because there were significantly fewer fathers versus mothers who completed the testing, evaluation of DIF on parent sex was considered exploratory and not included in the flowchart.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jpepsy/article/47/5/510/6565719 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 16 January 2024\nmeasures administered in wave 1. However, because there were significantly fewer fathers compared to mothers, DIF on parent sex was investigated for exploratory purposes only. Differential item functioning was conducted by using lordif (Choi et al., 2011), a hybrid logistic ordinal regression/IRT ability score framework. We flagged items for potential DIF if they had a Nagelkerke pseudo-R-squared value 0.20. We evaluated DIF \u201cscore impact\u201d by comparing scores with and without DIF items by computing the standard deviation (SD) of score differences and their root mean square difference (RMSD). We also calculated the percent of individual cases whose \u201cscore impact\u201d (absolute value) exceeded their scores\u2019 standard error (SE) estimate when all items were administered. We considered \u201cscore impacts\u201d exceeding score SEs as nontrivial differences."

We first conducted multigroup item calibration analyses, using wave 2 item response data as our reference sample. Because the wave 2 sample was collected using a random probability-based sampling strategy and weighted on key variables as described above to match U.S. parents with children ages 1\u20135 years, we centered the final item parameters on the wave 2 sample.\nStep 2. In consideration of response burden, the wave 2 sample did not complete all items included in final measures (see Figure 1). Therefore, after completing Step 1 analyses, we created measurement links to items that were not administered in wave 2 so that all item parameters were placed on the same metric defined by Step 1. This was done by using \u201cfixed parameter calibration\u201d (FPC), as implemented in the PROsetta Stone linking methodology (Cella et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2014); in which, items that were not administered to wave 2 participants were calibrated by fixing item parameters obtained in Step 1. As a result, all items were on the same metric. We employed IRTPRO v3.1 to conduct the multigroup IRT centering and item calibration analyses. Measures were reported using the PROMIS T-score metric, where mean (of wave 2 sample) \u00bc 50 and standard deviation\u00bc10.

The IRTbased overall reliability is a distribution-informed estimate, calculated from score SD and median SE. Individual score-level reliability is also derived from a SE estimate (i.e., reciprocal of test information). Reliabilities at individual T-score levels varied across the measurement continuum. We focused on the T-score range most likely to require clinical attention. A reliability 0.70 was considered acceptable (Reeve et al., 2007).\nWe examined the associations between each PROMIS EC domain using both Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman\u2019s rho correlations, as appropriate per measure score distribution. We evaluated the strength of correlations using standard intervals established in the literature (r\u00bc 0, no correlation; r\u00bc below 60.10, low; r\u00bc60.30, moderate; r 60.50, large; r\u00bc 1, perfect correlation; Cohen, 1988).

More detailed analysis results for each measure, including factor analyses, are described in the special section domain specific manuscripts that follow.\nIn Figure 1, we show the initial and revised domains from wave 1 to wave 2 testing, as well as the items per domain for each wave. In wave 1, 178 items across 12 domains (item pools) were developed and tested. Different factor analysis techniques (EFA, CFA, or BFA) were applied depending on the nature of the item pools being evaluated (details are described in domain specific manuscripts in this issue). Results from factor analyses, along with input from psychometric and developmental experts, led to refinement of some domains; specifically, Engagement was separated into Curiosity and Persistence; Self-Regulation was divided into Flexibility and Frustration Tolerance; Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-related Impairment were combined into one Sleep Problems item bank; and Family Relationships and Peer Relationships were combined into one Social Relationships item bank.\nThe other six domains (Global Health, Positive Affect, Physical Activity, Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms) stayed the same.\nWe further analyzed items, estimating item parameters, and evaluating item fit using the GRM. We did not identify any significant DIF on all comparisons across measures. Therefore, no items were removed due to DIF evaluations for item bias. As a result, 138 items across 12 measures were retained at the end of wave 1 testing.\nShort forms were created for measures without subdomains and with more than eight items (Positive Affect, Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms); they were subsequently used for wave 2 testing. For Social Relationships, a 6-item SF with two items from each subdomain was created; meanwhile, 21 items representing subdomains of Family Relationships (8 items), Peer Relationships (8 items), and Caregiver\u2013Child Interactions (5 items) were retained for wave 2 testing. For Sleep Problems, an 8- item SF with 4 items from each subdomain was created; meanwhile, all 16 items (8 items for Disturbance and 8 items for Impairment) were retained for wave 2 testing (see Figure 1)."

Final parameters were centered on the wave 2 sample, and scores were reported using the PROMIS T-score metric. Both CTT- and IRTbased reliabilities were greater than 0.70 (see Table II). Item response theory-based reliabilities at the individual level varied across the measurement continuum. For all measures, higher reliabilities tended to be associated with worse well-being (e.g., GH T scores 55 where IRT-based score-level reliabilities are 0.70) or worse symptoms (e.g., higher Sleep Problems T scores 40 where IRT-based scorelevel reliabilities are 0.70); lower reliabilities tended to be associated with better well-being or less symptom burden. These results coincide with the test information function curves for all measures, as depicted in Figure 3a and b. It was not surprising to find that measures with fewer items showed relatively smaller test information function values (i.e., lower reliabilities), as the information function value at the measure level is the accumulation of information values across all items. Regardless of measure item counts, all measures exhibited acceptable reliabilities ( 0.70) across at least a 30-point T-score range (e.g., T scores\u00bc 20\u2013 50 for Physical Activity and T scores\u00bc50\u201380 for Depressive Symptoms).\nDescriptive statistics of all measures are shown in Table III.

Going forward, these measures can be enhanced with additional item content, as clinicians, parents, and measurement experts recognize or identify new domain-specific content that would\nimportantly supplement existing content. One of the unique advantages of item banks and calibrated scales developed using IRT is that they can quite easily accept new item content without changing the score\nmetric, after proper testing and analysis to confirm their fit. Validation against developmental gold standard direct assessment, such as task- and observationbased paradigms, will also be important for some domains. Because of the use of state-of-the-science psychometric methods, proposed new items can be linked to the current item banks and calibrated scales using IRT-based linking methods. Thus, these new measures provide a foundation which can be expanded upon, enriching item content and increasing\nmeasurement range and precision. A critical next step for real world use in the context of pediatric research will be validation for clinical populations and testing implementation within the healthcare decision making and outcome evaluation settings. The brevity and ease of use of CAT and SFs enable precise estimation of a trait and also multiple traits while simultaneously minimizing response burden to informants. This is particularly important given symptoms can coexist (e.g., a cluster of fatigue, depression, and sleep\nFigure 3. (Continued)\nTable III.

Regarding administration, several options exist for SF use; in addition, CAT administration is available\u2014a feature particularly useful for item banks that have more than 10 items (Anger/Irritability, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Positive Affect, and Social Relationships) as CATs decrease response burden yet produce similarly precise estimates.\nOur study had several limitations. First, because we did not collect any short time period time-separated data, during which child health status would be expected to remain stable, we were not able to evaluate test\u2013retest reliability. Second, because we also did not collect any longitudinal data, during which child health status might potentially change, we were not able to evaluate responsiveness or sensitivity to change. Finally, we relied predominantly on parent report data for our measure validity analyses and evidence gathering; thus, validity data from objective sources as well as other nonparent sources were not available or analyzed.\nIn summary, using rigorous mixed-method approaches as described in Cella et al. (this issue; qualitative methods) and here (quantitative methods), we successfully extended PROMIS to early childhood for young children aged 1\u20135 years. This extension includes six-item banks ( 10 items) and six calibrated scales (<10 items) measuring key domains of young children\u2019s health that closely align with PROMIS pediatric and adult physical, mental, and social health domains. All PROMIS EC measures have been translated into Spanish and evidence to support their psychometric properties is not yet available. The deliberate development of the measures for pragmatic use, including SFs and CATs and their public availability in English and Spanish (Healthmeasures.net), has them poised for rapid translation to epidemiologic research, clinical research, and clinical care."
