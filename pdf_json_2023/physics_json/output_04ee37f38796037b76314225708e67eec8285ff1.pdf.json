    "abstractText": "Owing to their high redox potential and availability of numerous diffusion channels in metal\u2013organic frameworks, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are attractive for metal ion storage applications. Recently, vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) have received a great deal of attention for application in sodium-ion batteries, as they demonstrate a stable capacity with high redox potential of ~3.3 V vs. Na/Na+. Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the application of VFCN in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, a facile synthesis of VFCN was performed using a simple solvothermal method under ambient air conditions through the redox reaction of VCl3 with K3[Fe(CN)6]. VFCN exhibited a high redox potential of ~3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ and a reversible capacity of ~50 mAh g\u20131. The differential capacity plots revealed changes in the electrochemical properties of VFCN after 50 cycles, in which the low spin of Fe ions was partially converted to high spin. Ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the unchanged VFCN structure during cycling. This demonstrated the high structural stability of VFCN. The low cost of precursors, simplicity of the process, high stability, and reversibility of VFCN suggest that it can be a candidate for large-scale production of cathode materials for LIBs.",

            "text": "The development of cathode materials with high capacity, high-voltage flatform, and high stability in metal-ion batteries is always a challenge to scientists [1\u20134]. The traditionally used cathode materials (NCM, LFP) in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have some limitations, such as the complexity of fabrication, high cost of precursors (Ni, Co), and toxicity of the fabrication or recycling process [5\u201310]. The NCM cathode is not ready for use after single-step fabrication and should be combined with carbon derivatives such as carbon nanotubes or graphene. Therefore, the complex processing from raw materials to the final active materials would increase the product cost [11\u201313]. Thus, the development of sustainable materials that meet cathode requirements is essential. In the last decade, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have received great attention owing to their metal\u2013organic framework structure, which allows facile diffusion channels for cations (Li+/Na+/K+) [14\u201318]. PBAs consist of Fe ions with other metal ions (such as Na, K, Fe, Cr, Cu, and Mn) with the (CN)\u2212 groups as the linkers, creating cubic or monoclinic structures, and as cages, which can capture the metal ions [19,20]. The synthesis of PBA via the solvothermal method is simple and can easily be modified by changing the metal sources [15,21,22]. Therefore, much research on PBAs for alkaline-ion-storage applications has been simulated and/or experimented. Alkaline metals consisting of Prussian blue, such as sodium/potassium ferrocyanide or their derivatives with other transition metals (Mn, Cr, V, and Fe), demonstrated high capacities for alkaline ion batteries [23\u201326]. For example, Qian et al. used a Na4Fe(CN)6/C composite that exhibited a high redox capacity of ~90 mAh g\u22121 in sodiumion batteries (SIBs) [27]. Baster et al. employed sodium chromium hexacyanoferrate in SIBs and achieved a capacity of approximately 64 mAh g\u22121 [28]. Paulitsch et al. used\nMolecules 2023, 28, 461. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28020461 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nthe electrodeposition method to form a Na2VOx[Fe(CN)6] film as a cathode in aqueous SIBs, which exhibited a high specific capacity of ~80 mAh g\u22121 [29]. Lim et al. investigated Prussian white Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6], which exhibited a capacity of 169 mAh g\u22121, a value close to the theoretical capacity of ~171 mAh g\u22121 [30]. However, the unstable voltage flatform and fast degradation of these cathodes limit their practical application. Recently, the use of vanadium in PBA compounds has shown a highly improved voltage flatform and stability of the cathode materials [31,32]. Baster et al. fabricated sodium\u2013vanadium hexacyanoferrate (NaVHCF) by the coprecipitation method using VCl2 with the mixture of Na4Fe(CN)6/NaCl in an inert atmosphere [31]. Pan et al. prepared NaVHCFs from a VOC2O4 precursor [32]. All NaVHCF materials possess high redox potentials, leading to an improvement in the stability of the cathode materials for SIBs. However, PBAs are rarely employed in LIBs. Based on this scenario, in this study, we demonstrate a facile synthesis of vanadium ferrocyanides (VFCN) by a one-step solvothermal method using a redox reaction between VCl3 and K3Fe(CN)6. These materials, when employed as cathode materials in LIBs, exhibited high stability. Kinetic analysis, in situ differential capacity plots, and ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to further investigate the behavior of the VFCN cathode in LIBs."

            "text": "For the synthesis of VFCN, VCl3 was premixed with ethanol; thus, the combination resulted in VCl2OC2H5 (VCl3 + xC2H5\u2192 VCl3\u2212x(OC2H5)x + xHCl), preventing unexpected reactions with water or moisture (VCl3 + xH2O\u2192 VCl3\u2212x(OH)x + xHCl). According to the electrochemical series, the reduction potential of V4+ \u2192 V3+ is approximately 0.337 V, which is lower than that of [Fe(CN6)]3\u2212 \u2192 [Fe(CN6)]4\u2212 (0.358 V) [33]. Therefore, V3+ can be oxidized to V4+, while [Fe(CN6)]3\u2212 can be reduced to [Fe(CN6)]4\u2212. The reaction was completed after 1 h under a heating supplement at 80 \u25e6C, and the resultant was a green precipitate of VFCN (Prussian green). Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern of the VFCN and Fe[Fe(CN)6] (FFCN) samples, which matches the V1.5[Fe(CN)6] pattern with a cubic structure (JCPDS#00-042-1440). In addition, a peak at ~12\u25e6 is observed, which can be the (110) plane in VFCN or the spacing distance of the stacking layer observed in the synthesis of several 2D materials [34\u201336]. The FeFe(CN)6 was also confirmed with peaks corresponding to JCPDS #01-0239 [37]. It should be noted that the XRD patterns of these two materials were quite similar because of the same cubic structure, with a small difference in the lattice constant around 10.2 \u00c5 [38]. The SEM images in Figure 1b,c show aggregated VFCN and FFCN with a size distribution below 100 nm. To further reveal the morphology of the VFCN sample, TEM images were obtained, as shown in Figure 1d\u2013f. As shown in the TEM images in Figure 1d, the obtained sample had a nanosheet structure with a size of a few tens of nanometers. The lattice spacing of the (400) plane was well measured in Figure 1e in addition to the amorphous points on the surface of the layer, which could be due to the small oxidation of the surface. The SAED pattern in Figure 1f also supports the low crystallinity of the as-prepared VFCN owing to the small particle size and surface oxidation of the sample. It can be considered that the prepared VFCN sample is a nanosheet with a cubic Prussian blue structure and an amorphous surface. Based on the aforementioned information, VFCN and FFCN have a similar cubic structure with a lattice constant of ~10.2 \u00c5. However, VFCN revealed a less crystalline structure than FFCN. To further investigate the surface of the VFCN material, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are shown in Figure 2a\u2013d. The core levels of V, Fe, N, and C were well recorded at ~516.3, 708.4, and 398.7/284.5 eV, which indicate the V4+, Fe2+, and N\u2261C binding states, respectively. The Fe2+ and V4+ states can be described as V3+ being oxidized to V4+ and Fe3+ in [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212 being reduced to Fe2+, resulting in [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212. In addition, the small peaks of V5+ were deconvoluted at ~517.4 and 524.8 eV, indicating the oxidation of V on the surface, as illustrated in Figure 2a. This is consistent with the small Fe3+, N-O, and C-O/C=O peaks, both of which indicate that the surface of\nthe material was slightly oxidized.

The core levels of V, Fe, N, and C were well recorded at ~516.3, 708.4, and 398.7/284.5 eV, which indicate the V4+, Fe2+, and NC binding states, respectively. The Fe2+ and V4+ states can be described as V3+ being oxidized to V4+ and Fe3+ in [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212 being reduced to Fe2+, resulting in [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212. In addition, the small peaks of V5+ were deconvoluted at ~517.4 and 524.8 eV, indicating the oxidation of V on the surface, as illustrated in Figure 2a. This is consistent with the small Fe3+, N-O, and C-O/C=O peaks, both of which indicate that the surface of the material was slightly oxidized. Therefore, it can be concluded that VFCN Prussian green was well prepared using the redox reactions of VCl3 and K3Fe(CN)6 (KFCN) in the solvothermal process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 12\nFigure 2.

Figure 3a\u2013c show their CV curves in the range of 2.5\u20134.2 V vs. Li/Li+ at 0.1 mV s\u22121. FFCN as a typical PBA showed four redox peaks, which are related to the redox reactions of low spin and high spin Fe2+/Fe3+ at ~3.6/3.9 and 2.85/3.2 V vs. Li/Li+ [34,39,40]. However, VFCN shows only two stable redox potential peaks, which were recorded at 3.66 and 3.85 V vs. Li/Li+. This implies that the high-spin state of Fe2+/Fe3+ was significantly reduced or inactivated. Furthermore, Pan et al. reported that only Fe was active and V was inactive in the electrochemical process [32]. The small change from the first cycle could be due to a side reaction related to the interaction of Li ions on the VFCN amorphous surface and formation of a solid electrolyte layer in the first cycle [41,42]. Figure 3b,d show the plots of the voltage profiles of FFCN and VFCN at a current of 50 mA g\u22121, respectively. The FFCN electrode shows two voltage flatforms at ~2.8 and ~3.5 V during the discharge process, which could be related to the two redox states of high and low spin Fe3+ ions. Therefore, the voltage gap was mostly distributed between ~2.6 and 3.8 V. In contrast, the VFCN electrode shows a stable voltage flatform from ~3.2 to 3.8 V due to the inactive high-spin Fe2+ ions during the electrochemical reactions. Thus, the VFCN cathode has higher redox potential than that of the FFCN cathode. Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of V and deactivated high-spin Fe2+ ions stabilized the electrochemical reactions, resulting in the formation of a stable voltage flatform.\nFigure 2.

The VFCN cathode was run at 50 mA g\u22121 (corresponding to 1 C) for 100 cycles, and then high-current rate performance tests at 2, 4, 10, and 20 C were performed. This shows that the VFCN cathode possesses high stability during cycling, and the capacity is maintained at ~90.7% of the initial discharge capacity after 100 cycles. The high stability of VFCN cathode could be due to the more stable VFCN structure resulting from the existence of the V4+ ions and the V-O binding. As discussed above, the V ions are not involved in the electrochemical process. Therefore, they can act as stable elements in the VFCN lattice structure. This helps the restoration of the material during lithium insertion/extraction, leading to high stability during electrochemical process. The capacities decreased to 82.4, 73.0, 52.5, and 22.1% at 2, 4, 10, and 20 C, respectively. The capacities were highly responsive to changes in the current rate. Hence, after the high-current-rate test, the VFCN cathode showed a fast restoration from 20 to 2 and 1 C, where the capacity retention changed from low capacity values of ~15 mAh g\u22121, and then it was immediately restored to a stable capacity. Interestingly, at 1 C, the capacity was restored to 47.3 mAh g\u22121, which is 92.7% of the initial discharge capacity and is similar to the capacity at the 100th cycle (90.7%). This result indicates that the decrease in capacity may not be related to the degradation of the cathode material, but to the degradation of the lithium foil or electrolyte [43,44]. In contrast, the FFCN cathode showed a higher capacity of ~72 mAh g\u22121 in the first cycle, and then the capacity decreased to 72% compared to the first capacity value at the 100th cycle. It is noted that VFCN has a lower capacity than FFCN; however, the VFCN electrode demonstrated high stability and a high-voltage flatform, which is applicable to LIB cathodes.\nFigure 3.

In the charging process, the oxidation peak started changing from the 20th cycle and was maintained from the 50th cycle. The oxidation peak was divided from a single peak at ~3.8 V vs. Li/Li+ to two peaks at ~3.4 and 3.8 V vs. Li/Li+. Consistent with this change, the discharge process shown in Figure 5b shows a similar tendency. The single reduction peak at ~3.7 V vs. Li/Li+ was divided into two reduction peaks at ~3.3 and 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+. The couple peaks at 3.3/3.4 and 3.7/3.8 V are related to the redox potential of high spin and low spin Fe2+ ions, respectively [34,39,40]. Thus, the lithium ion insertion/desertion changed the states of Fe from only low-spin to the mixed states of high- and low-spin Fe ions. This could be due to the effect of lithium ions, which partially transferred their dynamic momentum to the VFCN structure. Lithium or some alkaline metal ions (Na, K) have been reported as effective ions for the phase modification of transition metal chalcogenides from 2H to 1T [45]. In our study, the Li ions affected the spin of Fe, in which the balance of low and high spins was established after 50 cycles.

The ex situ differential capacity plots revealed that the spin of Fe ions changed from low spin to mixed states of low and high spins, which could be because of the effectiveness of Li ions during insertion/desertion. The ex situ XRD patterns confirmed the high stability of the VFCN structure. In addition, kinetic analysis showed that the capacitance behavior was the major mechanism for Li storage of the VFCN electrode. The simplicity of the process, low cost of material, high stability, and high-voltage flatform of VFCN can contribute to future economic and environmentally friendly LIBs.\nAuthor Contributions: T.P.N.: Conceptualization, methodology, validation, visualization, writing, review, and editing.
