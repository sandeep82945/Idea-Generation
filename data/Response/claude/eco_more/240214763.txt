 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop methods to address endogeneity in the covariates. The paper treats the covariates as exogenous for simplicity, but allowing for endogeneity could lead to more credible causal inferences. This could involve using additional instrumental variables or structural equation modeling approaches.

2. Extend the model and methods to allow for spatial and/or temporal dynamics. The current model is static, but incorporating dynamics over space and/or time could be useful for certain applications. This could require different estimation techniques like panel data methods.

3. Consider nonparametric or semiparametric specifications for the spatial interaction function α(t,s). The current paper uses a series expansion, but a more flexible approach could be appropriate if this function is unknown. Kernel or sieve methods could be options.

4. Develop methods for optimal selection of tuning parameters like the regularization penalty λ and number of basis functions K. The paper uses basic rules of thumb, but more data-driven approaches like cross-validation could improve performance. 

5. Apply the methods to other types of functional data exhibiting spatial interactions. The age distribution example is just one application - the techniques could be relevant for other spatial functional data like pollution levels, housing prices, etc. Further theoretical and empirical case studies would be useful.
