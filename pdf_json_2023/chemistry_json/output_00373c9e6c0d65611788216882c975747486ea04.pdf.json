    "abstractText": "Non-oxidative coupling of methane (NOCM) is a sought-after reaction that has been studied for decades. Harsh reaction conditions (T >800 \u00b0C) in the face of limited catalyst stability lead to rapid catalyst deactivation and strong coking, preventing application thus far. Recent reports have shown the significance of an interplay of catalyst nature and reaction conditions, whereas metal carbides have prevailed to play a crucial role which involves incorporation of carbidic carbon in C2Hx and aromatic products. This perspective gives an overview of proposed mechanistic pathways and considerations about experiment conditions in order to foster a rational catalyst design platform for NOCM.",
