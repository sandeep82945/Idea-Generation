This\nstudy investigated the antioxidant\u2013structure activity relationship of eight flavonoids isolated from\nCentaurea scoparia using DFT studies and in vitro radical scavenging and xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition\nassays, and to correlate the theoretical values with the experimental findings. Docking analysis was\ncarried out to explore the binding modes of the isolated phytochemicals with XO and bovine b-\nlactoglobulin (BLG). Interactions of the isolated compounds with BLG were studied using molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations which revealed the involvement of hydrogen bonding. The root-mean-\nsquare deviation (RMSD) of BLG and BLG-flavonoid complexes reached equilibrium and fluctuated\nduring the 10 ns MD simulations. The radius of gyration (Rg) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA)\nrevealed that various systems were stabilized at approximately 2500 ps. In addition, the RMS fluctuations\nprofile indicated that the ligand's active site exerted rigidity behavior during the simulation. The hydrogen\natom transfer (HAT) and the energies of hydrogen abstractions were estimated by calculating the bond\ndissociation enthalpy (BDE) of O\u2013H in gas phase and water. The isolated compounds showed radical\nscavenging and XO inhibitory activities along with binding affinity with XO as revealed in silico. The BDE\nwas linked to the radical scavenging processes occurring in polar solvents.

Therefore, investigating their action mechanisms with a transport protein such as bovine blactoglobulin (BLG) would provide more trustworthy predictions to nd tools for controlling their transport to the target active site. BLG is a major whey protein belonging to the lipocalin family. It consists of nine antiparallel b-sheets and one ahelix and has a molecular weight of 18 400 Da. This protein was proven to show a high tendency towards hydrophobic ligands.17,18 As a result of being biocompatible and biodegradable, BLG is considered to be the main protein responsible for carrying the lipid-soluble drugs. Consequently, BLG would be an appropriate carrier for avonoids and might enhance the solubility and bioavailability of these compounds.19 Given that BLG can inuence various polyphenols and that its sensitization and stability are strongly inuenced by binding to avonoids, the study of their interaction is important.\nStudies on the antioxidant activity of avonoids revealed interesting biological activities and highlighted the structure\u2013 antioxidant activity relationship of these compounds. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are in silico techniques that foretell the particle interactions in a specic system in which the initial parameters and conditions are specied. MD tools are generally employed by researchers to gure out drug\u2013enzyme interactions and reactivities. Given the tremendous development in DFT, the preferred method for examining electronic properties of avonoids, theoretical studies have raised the curiosity for greater understanding of the mechanism of action of avonoids as antioxidants. The antioxidant action of avonoids strongly depends on its chemical structure as previously reported.20 Generally, the activity of avonoids as antioxidants was agreed to proceed via one-step H-atom transfer (HAT), single-electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT) or sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) mechanisms.21\u201323 In the HAT pathway, the radical accepts one hydrogen atom from a hydroxyl (OH) of the avonoid to be stabilized and afford a comparatively stable phenoxy radical which may donate another hydrogen atom to form a stable quinoid structure.24 The homolytic bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the OH group is the main parameter representing the HAT mechanism. BDE value is a good indicator for the avonoid radical scavenging activity. A lower BDE value denotes a higher ability to loss hydrogen and\n12362 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12361\u201312374\nconsequently more facile radical scavenging action. According to the SET-PT mechanism, the avonoid donates an electron to the radical forming Flav-OHc+ and consequently the interaction of both Flav-Oc and Flav-OHc+ causes the stabilization of radicals and inhibition of the radical chain reaction.24 This electron transfer process is characterized by calculating the ionization potential (IP). Deprotonation of the previously formed avonoid radical cation occurs aer the single electron transfer process. This step can be described as the hydroxyl proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE). On the other hand, the SPLET mechanism proceeds via deprotonation of the avonoids to afford a phenoxide anion in a rst step depicting the anion proton affinity (PA). The next step is the electron transfer from the phenoxide anion that reveals the electron transfer enthalpy (ETE). Although the overall result of SET-PT and SPLET mechanisms is equivalent to HAT, these routes are thermodynamically favorable in polar media because of the charge separation. In addition, SET-PT and SPLET are preferred for radicals with higher electron affinities.25,26 Based on the output of these mechanisms, the structure-antioxidant activity relationship estimation of the isolated phenolics could be assessed by calculating BDE, IP, PDE and ETE.22,27\nThis study aimed to isolate and characterize avonoids of C. scoparia aerial parts and to investigate their antioxidant activity. DFT calculations to compute the BDE values and compare the outputs with the experimental ndings of the antioxidant activity of the isolated avonoids were carried out. In addition, the radical scavenging mechanisms (HAT, SPLET and SET-PT) of the isolated avonoids were characterized by calculating BDE, IP, PDE, PA and ETE. Furthermore, we assessed the interaction of BLG with the isolated avonoids by molecular docking and MD simulations."

The chemical structure of isolated phytochemicals (Fig. 1) was elucidated according to data obtained from spectroscopic tools (MS, UV, 1D and 2D NMR) (ESI Fig. S1\u2013S16\u2020). By comparison with data in the literature, the isolated compounds were identied as 3\u2032-geranyl-5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxyisoavone (1),54,55 6-prenyl5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxyisoavone (2),56,57 3\u2032-geranyl-5,7,2\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxyisoavone (3),58 6-prenyl-3,5,7,4\u2032-tetrahydroxyavone (4),59 5,7,2\u2032-trihydroxyavone (5),60,61 5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy-6,3\u2032-dimethoxyavone (6),62 5,7,4\u2032,5\u2032-tetrahydroxy-6,3\u2032-dimethoxyavone (7)63 and 5,4\u2032-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyavone (8).64\n3.2. The binding modes of C. scoparia avonoids with BLG\nWe carried out molecular docking investigations to assess the potential binding affinity of C. scoparia avonoids (1\u20138) with BLG. The binding affinities, polar bonding, and probable hydrophobic interactions of the isolated phytochemicals with BLG are represented in Table 1, and the binding modes are represented in Fig. 2 and 3.\nThe stability of geometrical conformation of biological macromolecules is believed to be dependent on ligand-protein polar and hydrophobic interactions. Polar bonding represents the main route for the binding of drugs at the binding cavity of a specic protein. Consequently, these hydrogen bonds effectively participate in ligand's alliance and correlation to the target active site.65 The contribution of these polar interactions to the binding affinity depends mainly on desolvation power and the newly generated hydrogen bonds.

Thus, the protein backbone atoms RMSD demonstrate comparable patterns of all structures, reecting their stability and equilibrium for most of the time (between 2.5 and 10 ns). Reduced values of RMSD of BLG-avonoid complexes indicate that the bonding between avonoids and BLG minimized the degrees of freedom of the target protein dynamic. In addition, the obtained values of radius of gyration (Rg) of the standard BLG and BLG\u2013avonoid complexes were plotted as a function of time, as shown in Fig. 5B. The tightness of the protein skeleton along the folding and unfolding capacities during the 10 ns MD run were estimated from the obtained thermodynamically based Rg values. The Rg values attained a stabilized pattern at approximately 2500 ps in different systems, suggesting that the simulation reached equilibrium aer this time. As shown in Fig. 5B, the compactness of the protein skeleton along the simulation was estimated because of the decrease in Rg values of the backbone atoms. The initial Rg value of BLG and BLG-avonoid complexes was close to 1.44 nm, which agrees with the previously published experimental data. Furthermore, Fig. 5B demonstrates that the Rg estimation of BLG is not affected by the forming complexes with avonoids. This implied that the nature of BLG was not altered during binding to ligands.\nThe total solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) were studied for the protein in free and liganded form (1\u20138) during the 10 ns MD simulations as shown in Fig. 5C. Interestingly, the divergence behaviors of SASA in free BLG and BLG-liganded complexes (1\u20138) resemble the alteration in Rg values. This variation conrmed the accuracy and precision of the outcomes of our MD calculations.\nA detailed analysis of the RMSF prole of free BLG and BLGavonoid complexes (1\u20138) was performed, and the assessed ndings manifested the uctuations of interacting residues in the free and liganded forms (Fig. 5D). The obtained plot was developed as a function of the number of interacting residues\n12368 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12361\u201312374\naccording to the 10 ns trajectory. Fluctuations at the binding site of BLG were detected in the range of 0.04 to 0.05 nm in the obtained RMSF prole. Contrary to BLG in its free form, no considerable uctuations were detected at the drug's binding cavity in various complexes (Fig. 5D). Consequently, the resulted data is obviously pointed out to the fact that amino acids at the active site in the main central channel show minimized uctuations for each avonoid. Thus, the active site of isolated drugs architecture is mainly exhibiting an almost rigid behavior along the MD simulation run. The interaction between the target BLG and isolated avonoids is represented in Fig. 6."

The adverse inuence, particularly the cellular damage, caused by free radicals on the human body is alleviated by the antioxidant defense system. Incompetence of the antioxidant defense system is compensated by outside source antioxidants. Natural antioxidant can be found in food, and the vast majority exist in the form of avonoids.66 Flavonoids are naturally occurring antioxidant phenolics with a potent ability to contend free radicals via chelating, scavenging, deactivating prooxidant enzymes, and activating detoxication enzymes.67 It has been depicted that the ability of avonoids to act as antioxidants is determined by its activity toward scavenging free radicals.68 The ease of H-abstraction is agreed to be the leading factor controlling the antioxidant activity of avonoids.23 Therefore, three conceivable mechanisms (HAT, SET-PT and SPLET) are proposed for the radical scavenging activities of the isolated avonoids (1\u20138).

The variation of the active site in compound 4 between positions 4\u2032 in gas phase and 3 in water is obviously due to hydrogen bonding. In water, the hydrogen bonding between OH at position 3 and the carbonyl oxygen is attenuated by the hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Consequently, the ease of H-abstraction from position 3 is increased in water. The majority of 4\u2032-Flav-Oc possessing stabilities are higher than their rivals because of the hydrogen bonding with the neighboring oxo moiety in most cases. The data shown in Table 2 revealed that the homolytic hydroxyl bond dissociation is the thermodynamically prevailing mechanism for the radical scavenging activity. Compounds 7 and 6 showed the lowest BDE values and consequently they are considered the most active antioxidant agents among all isolated avonoids. This notion was supported by the coincided results obtained by the DPPH assay in which these compounds possessed the lowest IC50 values. Contrary to the small discrimination in BDE values of the isolated avonoids, there is a great variation in IC50 values which might be attributed to the environment that plays a crucial role in the antioxidant potential of the compounds under investigation. By checking the\nFig. 7 (A) Plot of the experimental DPPH assay values against total energy demand for the SPLET mechanism in water solution.

Generally, the energy requirements of the initial step in SPLET route (PA) are lower than that needed for the homolytic bond dissociation, and consequently the SPLET route is the predominant pathway for the radical scavenging activities of isolated avonoids in water solution. Furthermore, a plot of the IC50 values of the isolated compounds versus overall energy demand of the SPLET mechanism afforded a linear relationship with a square correlation value of 0.962 (Fig. 7A).\nData in Table 2 represents the estimated BDE (in kcal mol\u22121 at 298.15 K) in gas and aqueous phases for various O\u2013H groups in the isolated compounds (1\u20138). The arrangement of BDE values of OH substituents in gas phase is similar to that calculated in water solution. Because water system is more imitative to the bulk polarity of the cell environments and gas phase is generally seen as an ideal state, our ndings targeted the mechanisms of antioxidant activities in water solution. Interestingly, the order of experimental antioxidant efficacy of different drugs is correlated with the theoretically predicted arrangement, emphasizing that H-abstraction from OH substituents is likely to be the optimum evidence for the radical scavenging activity of phenolics (Fig. 7B).\nThe spin density is a rationally trustworthy parameter that offers representation of stabilities of various radical species.21 The minimal BDE and the ease of radical formation are mainly attributed to high delocalization of the radical spin density.69 The inuence of H-abstraction on the electron delocalization of various radical species was undertaken by evaluating local spin densities distributions at the depletion site (Fig. S19\u2013S26\u2020). Interestingly, the spin densities of various avonoids radicals are more likely to be delocalized for radicals resulting from B ring than those originating from A ring (5-OH and 7-OH). This inference is conrmed by the fact that all active sites (minimum BDE values) in studied phytochemicals are located in B ring (4\u2032- OH and 2\u2032-OH). For instance, in compound 1 the Mulliken spin population is 0.357 on the oxygen atom at position 4\u2032 of the radical and 0.431 on position 7 of the same compound. Consequently, this effect results in lowering the BDE values of OH groups in B rings than the A ring counterparts. Compound 7 showed the highest antioxidant potential and minimum BDE value (4\u2032-OH) with two radical species originating from B ring and two from A ring. This compound showed the lowest spin density (0.307) at position 4\u2032 among all radical species. On the other hand, compounds 2 and 5 showed the lowest antioxidant activities with the highest BDE values of the active sites. The spin densities of the active sites of these compounds (4\u2032-OH and 2\u2032-OH, respectively) were 0.382 and 4, respectively. The assessment of spin populations of isolated avonoid radicals revealed carbon atom at position 1\u2032 is the most likely radical center followed by oxygen atom from which hydrogen is removed. These outputs lead to the conclusion that spin densities distributions play a crucial role in predicting stabilities of radical species.\nGenerally, the activity of avonoids as antioxidant agents is strongly inuenced by variation of hydroxyl substitution on\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Also, the existence of both 3-OH and 5-OH groups might result in improving the antioxidant activity as seen in compound 4. Another leading factor for maximizing stability of the phenoxy radical in compound 7 (minimum BDE, highest RSA) is the o-dihydroxylation at the B ring (4'-, 5\u2032-OH), this structural feature offers extra stability and better radical scavenging activity by hydrogen bonding or expanded electron delocalization.\n3.5. XO inhibitory activity of C. scoparia avonoids\nXO is a molybdenum-containing enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine and the production of uric acid. Activation of XO and its mediated ROS production and oxidative stress are implicated in several diseases.71 Besides the radical scavenging activity of the isolated avonoids, we investigated their XO inhibitory activity using in vitro assay and molecular docking simulations. The results represented in Fig. 8 show the inhibitory effect of C. scoparia avonoids and allopurinol (AL). Compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 showed lower IC50 values when compared with the other compounds. The output of molecular docking revealed the activity of isolated phytochemicals against XO as represented in Table 5 and, Fig. 9 and supplementary Fig. S17 and S18.\u2020 All isolated avonoids were shown to occupy the main central\n12372 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12361\u201312374\ncavity of the enzyme. A relatively low binding energies (\u22127.2 to \u22129.0 kcal mol\u22121) were obtained with compounds 1 and 4 showed the lowest binding energy. The estimated low binding energy indicated the activity of isolated compounds against XO. All ligands were shown to exhibit polar interactions with the binding cavity of the enzyme. A large number of hydrophobic interactions were detected for compounds 4 and 5. In addition, many commonly known signicant amino acid residues were included in the binding interactions of these complexes. These ndings highlighted the XO inhibitory activity of C. scoparia avonoids."

            "text": "The outcomes of our DFT calculations indicated that the antioxidant activity mechanism of the isolated avonoids might be operated by SPLET pathway in water dissolution and by HAT mechanism in the gas phase. The compounds showed in vitro radical scavenging and XO inhibitory activities. Themost potent antioxidants are compounds 6 and 7 that possess the lowest ionization potential and BDE values. The SET-PT route is a thermodynamically less favorable mechanism for all avonoids. The nature of hydrogen atom transfer and neighboring group effect in avonoids would have a great effect on the thermodynamic features of these avonoids. Based on docking outcomes, the isolated avonoids can bind to the appropriate binding site on BLG structure exhibiting polar and hydrophobic interactions, and the obtained low binding affinities suggested the formation of stable drug\u2013protein complexes. The MD simulation investigations produced signicant contributions to gure out the impact of the ligand interaction on BLG congurational modication and the stability of BLG-avonoid complexes in the water phase. Our MD calculations revealed the relative energy minimization of the target protein and avonoid complexes around 2500 ps. Besides, the resemblance of BLG and BLG-avonoid complexes atomic uctuations pattern proposed the rigidity of the ligand-binding pocket structure along the course of 10 ns MD simulations.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
