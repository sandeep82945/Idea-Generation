Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, United States\nSuccessful aging (SA) was proposed by Robert J Havighurst in 1961 to capture how older adults add \u201clives onto (their) years.\u201d While there is a consensus regarding the multidimensionality of the concept, the set of criteria that should be applied to older adults of advanced age remain controversial. Notwithstanding their inevitable decline in physical health, adults of advanced age may still enjoy good psychosocial well-being. In this light, we compared the proportion of \u201csuccessful agers\u201d in two cohorts of adults aged 95 or above who lived with their families in 2011 (Nf77) and 2021/22 (Nf120) in Hong Kong using two models \u2013 Model A: i: Good subjective health, ii: more well-off than average, iii: as happy as young (Cho et\u00a0al., 2012)\u00a0and Model B: i: Weekly social activities, ii: absence of dementia, iii: intact sight and hearing ability, iv: intact mobility (Nosraty et\u00a0al, 2012). Both models have been applied in adults aged 90 or above. In the 2011 cohort, 13.0% and 16.9% of our sample fulfilled the SA criteria of Model A\u00a0& B respectively. The percentages fell to 1.7% and 13.7% respectively in the 2021/22 cohort. The decrease is due to less participants fulfilling the financial criterion of Model A, as well as the criteria on intact sight and hearing ability and the absence of dementia of Model B.\u00a0COVID presents multidimensional challenges for adults of advanced age. Examining the dimensions that are most impacted will help orient recovery works along the direction of SA.\nSESSION 5082 (PAPER)"

To the extent that methylation (and other biomarkers) are valid surrogates for biological age, the testing of antiaging interventions has thus become radically cheaper, faster, and more practical. Together with colleagues at McGill University, I\u00a0have initiated a clinical trial to evaluate some of the most popular antiaging strategies currently deployed by \u2018\u2018early adopters\u2019\u2019 in the lay community of personal health activists. We are recruiting 5000 subjects, age 45\u201365, and interviewing them in detail about their diet, drugs and supplements, exercise, social, and other practices that plausibly contribute to modulate the rate of aging. They agree to submit saliva samples for analysis of methylation age at the beginning and end of a 2-year test period. Primary endpoint is the difference in methylation age over the course of 2\u00a0years. Results will be viewed as an exploratory study to identify synergistic combinations of age-retarding treatments.

University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\nSelf-efficacy among older adults has been associated with better sleep, increased vitality, decreased pain and discomfort as well as overall satisfaction with life. Interventions designed to increase general self-efficacy can therefore have wide-ranging effects on individual\u2019s health as well as reduce the burden on healthcare systems. In this abstract we present preliminary data examining the impact of Wits Wellness on general self-efficacy among participants. Middle aged and older adults, Nf285 (Mean age 65.58 yrs, males=28) were randomized to either a Wits Wellness group or a Waitlist Control for 12-weeks. The 12-week wellness program addresses multiple factors including physical activity, stress, sleep, social isolation and diet with the goal of empowering older adults to make healthier lifestyle choices. At baseline and end of the 12-week trial, the 10-item PROMIS general self-efficacy scale was used to assess global self-efficacy which reflects a problem-solving approach despite perceived\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /innovateage/article/6/Supplem ent_1/749/6939432 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nobstacles and challenges. Older participants aged 65 and above, who attended 8 or more weeks (Nf123, n=63 in Wits Wellness group) of the program demonstrated significant increases in their general self-efficacy. Results showed a significant group*time effect favoring the Wits Wellness intervention (F(1,120)=4.10, p=.045, partial eta2=.03). The intervention was most effective in boosting confidence among the older adults within the trial (>65 yrs.). These findings demonstrate preliminary efficacy of the Wits Wellness program and are significant as general self-efficacy is considered an important moderator of healthy adaptation to illness which is critical in old age.

A\u00a0combined approach to the care of older adult fracture patients was first reported in the early 1990s, emphasizing geriatric and orthopedic co-management. Early studies showed significant improvements in complications, function, and discharge rates to nursing homes. Subsequent studies demonstrated shorter time-to-surgery, lengths of stay (LOS), lower readmission rates, reduced in-hospital mortality, and lower cost of care. The studies are from large academic centers whose physicians are employed faculty or have dedicated geriatric units. Less studied is whether similar models could be implemented in community health systems/mixed practice settings like Cedars-Sinai. Cedars-Sinai\u2019s older adult fracture program integrates inpatient and outpatient care and uses best practices of the 4Ms Framework of an Age-Friendly Health System, including What Matters Most, Mentation, Medications, and Mobility. The program was designed through the consensus of interprofessional champions and empirical evidence. Results showed enrolled patients with all fracture types had significantly lower LOS (marginal effect [ME]: -2.12, 95%CI: -2.61, -1.63), LOS index (ME: -0.33, 95%CI: -0.42, -0.25), and total direct costs (ME: -$5316.4, 95%CI: -6806.31, -3826.5). There was no significant difference in time-to-surgery. Of the 746 enrolled patients, 170 (23%) had a post-discharge visit with a participating geriatrician within 6\u00a0months. Findings indicate a systematic approach to improving care for older adults with fractures improves inpatient outcomes in a mixed practice setting. Future studies will examine the effectiveness of Cedar-Sinai\u2019s outpatient program."

Researchers collaborated with Oklahoma APS to understand characteristics of allegedly self-neglecting clients who were reported to APS (focus of this paper), and to subsequently refer a random sub-sample to home-and community-based services and track outcomes. Clients (n\u00a0=\u00a0188) were interviewed by phone; data were collected on demographic and background characteristics, physical and mental health, social support, social isolation, and the impact of COVID-19 on them. Most clients were white, 18% were American Indian, and 14% were African American. Their ages ranged from 18\u201392\u00a0years, 63% were women, most were low-income ($12,000-$15,000 annually), and 60% lived alone. Many used public benefits such as Medicare (75%), Social Security, and Medicaid. Based on PHQ scores, about a third had moderate to severe symptoms of depression; and 27% scored similarly on anxiety. More than a third saw family and friends less often during the pandemic. APS administrative data was also obtained on these clients and preliminary analyses indicated that the 188 study participants had a total of 205 allegations of self-neglect prior to the study, with 76% of the allegations needing a referral for community services. During the intervention phase, however, only 31 clients had any type of abuse allegations with 24 being for self-neglect. About half needed community services. It is possible that services they were referred to prior and during the study was related to the decline in self-neglect allegations during the study period."
