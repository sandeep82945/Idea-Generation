            "text": "1,2-Aminoalcohols are a ubiquitous structural motif found in a diverse array of natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals (Fig. 1a).1 They also play a pivotal role in organic synthesis as privileged ligands and catalysts.2 Therefore, the development of efficient methods for the preparation of these motifs, particularly in a stereoselective manner, is undoubtedly an important area of chemical research. While various approaches, including the oxyamination of alkenes,3a\u2013c ringopening of epoxides,3d reductive cross-coupling of carbonyls with imines,3e and others,3f\u2013m have been reported to date, most of them suffer from intrinsic drawbacks. These include the necessity for noble metals and/or toxic chemicals, as well as multi-step synthesis for the preparation of specic substrates. Given the abundance and wide availability of aliphatic alcohols as feedstock chemicals, the direct conversion of primary or secondary alcohols into synthetically valuable 1,2-aminoalcohols would be an ideal approach. However, such methods are currently limited to a few reports where primary alcohols are the only applicable substrates.4\nHydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) is a powerful strategy to functionalize C(sp3)\u2013H bonds via the generation of carboncentred radicals.5 The recent development of photoinduced\nences, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto a.3c@kyoto-u.ac.jp; maruoka.keiji.4w@\nght Industry, Guangdong University of\nESI) available: Experimental procedures elevant compounds. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nHAT catalytic systems, most of which are enabled by the combination with a photoredox catalyst (PC), has offered a unique opportunity to manipulate the C(sp3)\u2013H bonds of a wide range of substrates under mild conditions in high atom and step economy.6 Imine derivatives are attractive acceptors for the carbon-centred radicals generated by the HAT process, providing structurally diverse amine derivatives. Indeed, photochemical methods for C\u2013H aminoalkylation of a variety of substrates with different HAT catalysts have been reported in recent years (Fig. 1b).7 Surprisingly, however, the use of alcohols as substrates for radical addition to imines via the HAT process has not been included in these reports, although site-selective HAT from the a-C\u2013H bond of aliphatic alcohols has been achieved in several other C\u2013H functionalization reactions.8 Herein, we addressed this underexplored area by using a cationic HAT catalyst based on 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which was recently developed by our group (Fig. 1c).9 We envisioned that the highly electrophilic dicationic aminium radical I would be suitable for selective HAT from a strong but hydridic a-C\u2013H bond of an alcohol with the aid of a favourable polar effect.10 Meanwhile, imine derivatives were investigated in detail to identify an appropriate structure as an acceptor for the carboncentred radical generated in situ from the alcohol substrate.\nBased on our previous research,9 the proposed mechanism for the present PC/HAT dual catalytic system is outlined in Fig. 2. Upon irradiation with visible light, the organophotoredox catalyst 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium perchlorate (Mes-Acr+) transitions to a long-lived excited state (Mes-Acr+*) with a high oxidation potential (Ered[Mes-Acr+*/Mes-Acrc] of 2.06 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in MeCN),11 which oxidizes the HAT catalyst (DABCO+) via single-electron transfer (SET) to generate the dicationic aminium radical I. The subsequent HAT process between the alcohol and I furnishes the corresponding\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13879\u201313884 | 13879\nFig. 1 (a) 1,2-Aminoalcohol as a ubiquitous structural motif.

            "text": "We commenced our investigation by screening imine derivatives as acceptors for the a-hydroxy carbon-centred radical generated in situ from ethanol (Fig. 3). Imine derivatives from pchlorobenzaldehyde, including N-Boc imine 1a, N-tosyl imine 1b, and N-tosylhydrazone 1c, provided none of the corresponding products. A more electrophilic N-tosylhydrazone derived from ethyl glyoxylate (1d) gave a detectable amount of the expected 1,2-aminoalcohol product, and the further introduction of an electron-withdrawing triuoromethyl group at the sp2 carbon of the hydrazone moiety (1e) signicantly increased the yield. These trends indicate that the highly electrophilic\n13880 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 13879\u201313884\ncharacter at the imine moiety is crucial to achieve sufficient reactivity. Given the good balance between electrophilicity and chemical stability, applicability to asymmetric synthesis, and ease of deprotection, we focused on N-sulnyl a-iminoesters as the imine partners. Gratifyingly, the reaction of ethyl (E)-N-(ptoluenesulnyl)iminoacetate (1f) with ethanol gave the 1,2- aminoalcohol product in a good yield. We then moved on further investigations of the substituent of the sulnyl moiety (Fig. 4). Since Ellman's tert-butyl-substituted N-sulnyl imine is known to be incompatible with radical-mediated conditions, we focused on aryl-substituted N-sulnyl derivatives.12 Although para- or ortho-monosubstituted phenyl groups (1f\u2013h) gave good yields of 1,2-aminoalcohol products, the stereochemistry of the a-carbon relative to the chiral sulfur centre in the sulnyl moiety was not well controlled (<3 : 1 dr, Fig. 4, entries 1\u20133). On the other hand, the sterically more hindered mesityl group (1i)\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nFig. 4 Screening of N-sulfinyl a-iminoesters. Yields and ratios of isomers were determined by 1H NMR using 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as an internal standard. Syn/anti selectivity of the 1,2-aminoalcohol moiety was <1.3 : 1 in all cases. aThe reaction was run for 6 h using 3 equiv. of EtOH.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Thus, we expected that the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups at the two ortho-positions of the phenyl ring would facilitate the transfer of chirality from the sulfur centre to the a-carbon while maintaining the high electrophilicity at the imine carbon, thereby delivering both high reactivity and diastereoselectivity. Indeed, the orthodiuorophenyl group (1j) efficiently produced the product with an increased diastereoselectivity (Fig. 4, entry 5). Finally, the slightly bulkier ortho-dichlorophenyl group (1k) was found to be the optimal substituent of the sulnyl moiety, affording the desired 1,2-aminoalcohol in a good yield with a high diastereoselectivity at the a-carbon (Fig. 4, entry 6). Although the syn/ anti selectivity of the 1,2-aminoalcohol moiety was not controlled even aer the optimization of reaction conditions (<1.3 : 1 in all cases), it was found that both the equivalents of ethanol and the reaction time could be reduced (Fig. 4, entry 7). Notably, other HAT catalysts, including those used in the reported conditions for radical addition to imine derivatives,7 did not provide the desired radical adduct from ethanol and (\u00b1)-1k (See the ESI for details\u2020). These results demonstrate an advantage of our photocatalytic system where the exceptionally electrophilic aminium radical I is responsible for an efficient HAT process from the a-C\u2013H bond of the alcohol.\nWith the optimal N-sulnyl a-iminoester in hand, the scope of primary and secondary alcohols was evaluated (Fig. 5). The\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nrelative stereochemistry between the a-carbon and the sulfur centre in the 1,2-aminoalcohol products was fully controlled in all cases (>19 : 1 dr). A series of (deuterated) methanol and primary alcohols with varying degrees of steric bulk were good substrates for hydrogen-atom abstraction by the cationic DABCO-based HAT catalyst, affording the corresponding products in moderate to high yields (2k and 3\u20139). Alcohols bearing several functional groups, such as acetoxy (10), siloxy (11), chloro (12), para-substituted benzoyloxy (13\u201316), and phthaloyl groups (17), were well tolerated. Of note, these reactions occurred selectively at the a-C\u2013H bond to the hydroxy group. Moreover, despite the increased steric hindrance, both acyclic (18, 19, and 23\u201325) and cyclic (20\u201322) secondary alcohols successfully afforded bulky 1,2-aminoalcohols. It was also possible to switch the ester group in the N-sulnyl a-iminoester from ethyl to benzyl (26 and 27), suggesting the utility of our method for the synthesis of amino acids by the subsequent removal of the benzyl protecting groups. In addition to alcohols, the reactivity of other substrates was briey examined. Cyclohexane, a representative of hydrocarbons containing stronger C\u2013H bonds than the a-C\u2013H bond of alcohols, afforded the amonoalkylated amino acid derivative 28 in a good yield. The etheric substrates THF and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane were also suitable substrates, furnishing the corresponding products 29 and 30, respectively, in high yields.\nHaving established our protocol for the facile construction of 1,2-aminoalcohols, an asymmetric synthesis was conducted by using optically active N-sulnyl a-iminoesters (Fig. 6). Both enantiomers of 1k were prepared according to Senanayake's method (see the ESI\u2020).13 The a-C\u2013H aminoalkylation of cyclopentanol with (R)-1k under optimal conditions, followed by the deprotection of the sulnyl moiety and N-benzoylation, afforded the enantiomerically enriched 1,2-aminoalcohol (R)-31 with 98% ee. We then demonstrated the synthesis of all possible isomers of threonine and allothreonine derivatives. The use of ethanol and (S)-1k in this protocol provided amixture of (2S,3S)32 and (2S,3R)-32 as derivatives of L-allothreonine and L-threonine, respectively. Similarly, the reaction of ethanol with (R)-1k gave a mixture of (2R,3S)-32 and (2R,3R)-32, which are derivatives of D-threonine and D-allothreonine, respectively. These results indicate that the present method can be used for rapid access to the desired stereoisomers of chiral 1,2-aminoalcohols starting from an aliphatic alcohol.\nWe performed analytical studies to better understand the reaction mechanism (Fig. 7). Stern\u2013Volmer uorescence quenching studies revealed that DABCO+ quenches the excited state of photocatalyst Mes-Acr+*, whereas quenching by (\u00b1)-1k is negligible (Fig. 7a). The reduction potential of (\u00b1)-1k was \u22121.2 V vs. SCE according to the cyclic voltammetry measurement, indicating that the single-electron reduction of (\u00b1)-1k by acridine radicalMes-Acrc (E1/2[Mes-Acr\n+/Mes-Acrc] = \u22120.57 V vs. SCE) would not be favoured (Fig. 7b).11 Therefore, a radical\u2013 radical coupling between an a-hydroxy radical and an a-amino radical generated in situ from the alcohol and N-sulnyl a-iminoester, respectively, would be unlikely. On the other hand, the efficient diastereocontrol at the a-carbon relative to the sulfur centre supports the radical addition pathway to the s-cis form of\nChem.
