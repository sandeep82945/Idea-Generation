This has made video gaming a topic of interest for behavioral and higher brain cognitive function researchers. The present study investigated the impact and consequences of action video gaming on human behavior\u2014specifically, attention, anxiety levels, and sleep patterns. Objective: The study aimed to investigate the potential associations between action video gaming and attention, anxiety, and sleep. Methods: Recruited participants (N = 97) were asked to independently complete an online questionnaire consisting of 4 sections: demographic data, gaming behavior, 8-item Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale. Participants were further divided into 2 groups (expert and non-expert video gamers) based on the number of hours they spent on action video games. After completing the questionnaires, the patients attended an on-site session, where they completed a validated psychological online battery test that assessed their sustained attention. Results: The mean age of the participants was 21 years. There was a significant difference in attention between expert and non-expert video gamers; when exposed to stimuli, expert gamers displayed significantly shorter reaction times than the non-expert gamers (p < 0.05). Both groups showed a non-significant decrease in attention span throughout time. The data demonstrated no statistically significant difference in anxiety levels or daytime sleepiness between expert and non-expert video gamers, and minimal to mild anxiety levels were reported in most expert and non-expert gamers. Conclusion: Expert video gamers were significantly more attentive compared to non-expert gamers, and most participants showed low levels of generalized anxiety. Accordingly, expanding our knowledge on the effects of action video games on attention span is important for creatively using games in the field of education, especially for those who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.

Studies have shown a significant increase in the prevalence of gaming among children and adolescents in recent years.1 This has led to many emerging studies on the effects of video gaming, especially for educators, social workers, and researchers. This increasing attention toward video gaming is also due to the variable possible impacts on individual well-being associated with gaming behavior. There are many studies that aimed to determine the prevalence and the correlation of gaming behavior on multiple psychological aspects, particularly on attention.1,2 These studies resulted with a prevalence of video gaming addiction ranging from 0.7% to 15.6%.1 Some studies showed that playing action video games could be associated with improvement of some cognitive functions.3,4 Other studies detected poor academic\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 151\u2013160 151 \u00a9 2022 Alsaad et al.

Many studies have investigated this correlation using various methods. One study showed that people with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) demonstrated abnormal emotional regulation, expressed as anxiety and other psychological symptoms.5 Some studies detected an association between anxiety and online gaming and IGD.6 Furthermore, this association may not only exist in individuals with IGD; there is a possible correlation between anxiety and video gaming even in average gamers, as anxiety itself is a major concerning symptom that could interprets a person\u2019s well-being.7,8\nIn addition, poor sleep quality is one of the most common issue being possible associated with video gaming. Poor sleep quality is known to be associated with various other mental health problems and can contribute to both attention changes and anxiety related to video or internet gaming.9,10 Video gaming can also indirectly induce negative physical or psychological effects due to sleep deprivation.10,11 Further research is necessary to investigate the association between gaming behavior and sleep. This study aimed to explore the possible associations between action gaming behavior and attention, anxiety, and sleep. It also aimed to explore the relationships between the number of hours spent on video gaming (expert versus non-expert) and attentiveness, anxiety, and sleep disturbances."

Attention is defined as the ability to focus on a specific goal or information while successfully avoiding derailment due to distractions. In that regard, video games channel the facilitation of selective information processing in individuals. Efficient attention is essential in everyday life and is also considered an integral part of action video games.18 The current study examined the effects of action video gaming among expert and non-expert gamers on 2 domains of attention. First, players\u2019 processing speed of reaction time was measured. Secondly, the reaction time trials were divided into 5 bins to extract the effect of action video games on sustained attention. To ensure elimination of the test\u2019s novelty effect, the test trials were complemented with the pre-practice test. Reaction time was found to be superior in the group of expert gamers (358.25 ms) compared to the non-expert gamers (391.2 ms) (p=0.013). This finding is in concordance with a review of studies that tested reaction times between action video game players and non-players and found that the former group had 10% faster responses compared to the latter group. The study tested the speed of gamers\u2019 responses using\nTable 2 Attention Span in All Types of Gamers\nReaction Time Total Group p-value\nExpert Gamers Non-Expert Gamers\nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD\n1st 8 trials 375.8 95.9 376.0 96.7 375.6 96.0 0.983 2nd 7 trials 376.6 72.0 384.0 74.2 367.0 68.7 0.253 3rd 8 trials 362.9 54.6 354.6 46.8 373.8 62.4 0.086 4th 7 trials 374.5 82.8 362.0 74.0 390.9 91.3 0.088 5th 7 trials 375.9 64.2 375.0 67.6 377.1 60.3 0.873\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S347694 DovePress\n155\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nbuilt-in data analysis software and found them to be very fast\u2014to the level that the software documented most of their reactions being anticipatory, reaching response times of 200 ms or less.19 Cross-sectional and interventional study designs have investigated net reaction times and reported decreases over time.19\u201321 This net decrease in reaction time corresponding to action video games has also had its effect beyond the games themselves, extending to daily activities.22 One study reported that action video games helped dyslexic children increase their reading pace.23 Another study found that these games were associated with faster operational skills in surgeons performing laparoscopic surgeries.24\nIn the present study, reaction time was measured using 37 trials. We divided the trials into 5 bins, with an average of 7 trials each, to extract another observation related to attention\u2014attention span. We found no significant difference between the study groups regarding attention span, but we observed a trend of decline in both groups (p=0.93). The effect of action video games on sustaining attention has been extensively studied compared to other aspects of attention. A 2017 study found that expert gamers were better able to maintain attention at the beginning of the task; however, similarly to our study, their performance steadily declined near the end of the task.4 The observed similarity of reaction time and the trend of decline in performance throughout the test in both expert and non-expert gamers groups might be\nTable 3 GAD Levels for Expert and Non-Expert Gamers\nGamers n (%) Total (%) p-value\nMinimal Mild Moderate Severe\nExpert gamers 32 (58.2%) 16 (29.1%) 5 (9.1%) 2 (3.6%) 55 (56.7%)\nNon-expert gamers 17 (40.5%) 17 (40.5%) 6 (14.3%) 2 (4.8%) 42 (43.3%) 0.388\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S347694 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 156\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nexplained by the nature of monotony and lack of exciting stimuli during the test. This makes both groups equal regarding attention span, with no superiority of gaming expertise in the improvements of this domain.\nThe second purpose of our contemporary study was to determine whether action video games were associated with elevated anxiety levels among healthy adolescents. We found no significant association between playing action video games and developing anxiety in expert or non-expert gamers (p=0.39). Overall, 87.3% of expert and 81% of non-expert gamers reported having minimal to mild anxiety symptoms, reflecting no direct relationship between anxiety and gaming regimens. These results are consistent with those of a previous review that observed the relationship between addictive use of social media and video games and psychiatric disorders; the results suggested that playing video games had no impact on anxiety (even for addicted video gamers) in terms of improvement or worsening, and more gamers were found to be depressed than anxious.25 A separate randomized controlled trial examined the effect of video games on adolescent anxiety symptoms; it showed a steeper decrease in personalized anxiety scores than in total anxiety scores. Two plausible explanations for the absence of impact were the duration of the intervention and the type of video game used.26 The first conflicting results were from a randomized controlled trial created by a multidisciplinary team of psychologists, clinicians, game designers, and children themselves; participants showed improvement in anxiety levels after maintaining the evidence-based therapeutic video games for 6 months.27 Another study indicated that female gamers experienced\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nhigher anxiety in comparison to males, but the reason behind that was unclear.28 Additional studies reported variability based on the type of video games, anxiety scales used, age, and gender. One 2019 study revealed that anxiety was a risk factor for gaming addiction symptoms, and players who had higher anxiety levels tended to have higher addiction scores.29 Finally, one study found a direct relationship between video game addiction and psychological factors such as depression, stress, and anxiety,30 and one additional study supported this finding.31\nThe effect of technology usage on human sleep is an ever-growing area of study. The third objective of the present study was to examine the effect of video games on sleep. Results showed that 85.5% of expert and 78.5% of non-expert video gamers reported normal daytime sleepiness, while the rest reported excessive daytime sleepiness. These results contradict the established results from existing literature stating that video games have a negative impact on sleep.32 The discrepancy between our results and those in the literature may be explained by several limitations and methodological means observed in literature. Although the effects of video games on sleep appears to be extensively studied, previous studies investigating this relationship are actually very limited. This may be the result of confusing the term \u201cvideo gaming\u201d with media use (television, personal computer, or Internet) rather than regarding these things as separate entities with different effects.33\u201335 Another limitation was the wide variety of methodological instruments and protocols used in each study, making it difficult to generalize and harmonize conclusions between them.32 Furthermore, many factors are linked to disturbances in sleeping patterns\u2014specifically, the previous day\u2019s activities and increased arousal states.36 This highlights the importance of separating the effect of video gaming on sleep from those of concurrent factors in daily life.\nThere are some limitations within this study that should be considered. The study was conducted among a small group of participants with some similar characteristics, such as age. This fact may limit the generalizability of the results. We suggest applying the study to a larger population with comparable demographics."

            "text": "This study showed that expert video gamers were significantly more attentive compared to non-expert video gamers. Additionally, attention span decreased gradually toward the end of the trials in both groups of gamers, indicating that attention is not sustained with time. Although most of the participants showed mild levels of anxiety, there was no association between the severity of gaming and either anxiety level or daytime sleepiness. This study assessed the effects of gaming on attention and concluded that attention can be altered by certain types of games. That is, certain types of games can be used as tools to alter higher cognitive brain functions, such as attention, especially in those members of society who suffer from attention disorders that affect their day-to-day performances. This study also calls for the development of targeted video games that benefit members of society with disabilities in cognitive function. Further studies examining different types of video games and their effects on higher cognitive functions are recommended. Regarding the effects of gaming on cognitive functions, the test we used to assess attention focused on reaction time and did not take more than 10 minutes for 1 participant to finish. In further research, more complex tests that measure other parameters of cognition might be used to give more detailed information about different cognitive domains affected by gaming behavior, rather than just attention. Although online questionnaires are commonly used in other studies in this field and are reported to be an effective method, the nature of online surveys has some limitations regarding the selfreporting of symptoms; mainly, this method not as accurate as an interview with a clinician."
