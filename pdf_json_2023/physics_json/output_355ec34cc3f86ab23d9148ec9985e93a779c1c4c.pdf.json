In this report, we used SARS-CoV-2 as a specific test-32 case example and explore to use RNA-degrading chimeras to inhibit virus replication. SARS-33 CoV-2 is an enveloped ssRNA(+) virus. The whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 (~30,000 34 nucleotides) is encoded in a single RNA molecule2. The viral RNA in transmitted virions is 5' 35 capped and 3' polyadenylated, so that it is recognized and treated as an mRNA3. In this step, 36 the 5\u2019 UTR is used to hijack the host ribosome to translate viral proteins4. Furthermore, the 5\u2019 37\nUTR plays an essential role in RNA transcription for each coronavirus structural protein, which 38 is accomplished through a \"discontinuous\u201d transcription mechanism. Specifically, the replication 39 transcription complex binds to the 5\u2019 UTR leader transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS-L), 40 and then \u201chops\u201d onto the body TRS (TRS-B) sequence located at the 5\u2019-end of each structural 41 gene5,6. That said, all SARS-CoV-2 transcripts share the same 5\u2019 UTR leader sequence. In 42 addition, the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR was reported essential for viral RNA packaging7. 43\nGiven the importance of the UTRs in SARS-CoV-2, we and others elucidated the RNA 44 structures in SARS-CoV-2 UTRs8\u201312. The 5\u2019 UTR RNA structures in cell-free buffers, in virus-45 infected cells, and in our reporter cell model are highly consistent 8\u201313, suggesting superior 46 stability and suitability serving as drug targets. The 5\u2019 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 contains five stem-47 loops, namely SL1\u20135. The start codon resides in SL5, a unique four-way helix8\u201312 (Fig. 1a). SL5 48 exists in all betacoronovirus species, including MERS and SARS-CoV, and the shapes of this 49 RNA structure are similar9. We aligned the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq and different lineages and 50 demonstrated that the SL5 is highly conserved among all strains1. Although a predominant 51 mutation was found in SL5B loop region from recent lineages (C241T), this mutation is unlikely 52 to change the overall structure of SL51. In SARS-CoV-2, several structures in the 5\u2019 UTR, 53 including SL4, SL5A, and SL6, were found binding to amilorides14 (Fig. 1a). Amilorides 54 demonstrated antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. 55\nHere, we report a pipeline in antiviral discovery and optimization of RNA-degrading chimeras 56 targeting SL5, highlighting a novel sequencing-based method namely chemical-guided (cg) 57 selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) sequencing (seq), or 58 cgSHAPE-seq, to rapidly locate the RNA ligand binding site (Fig. 1a). First, we screened a small 59 coumarin derivative library in SL5 RNA binding assay and optimized the hit through structure-60 activity-relationship studies. To elucidate the RNA ligand binding site, we synthesized and 61 applied a new type of chemical probe that can selectively acylate the 2\u2019-OH on the ribose at the 62 location of binding (Fig. 1b)26,27. The 2\u2019-OH acylation locations were \u201crecorded\u201d onto RNA 63 molecules by reverse transcriptase as single-point mutations at the modification sites during 64 primer extension. The mutation sites were then captured and deconvoluted by next-generation 65 sequencing28,29. Mutational profiling analysis in cgSHAPE-seq unambiguously identified a 66 bulged G in SL5 as the primary binding site in the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR. In the literature, other 67 sequencing-based methods were reported using affinity probes bearing nitrogen mustard or 68 diazirine moiety (e.g., ChemCLIP-seq15\u201319 and PEARL-seq20). However, a major limitation of 69 these methods is a strong labeling bias toward guanosines21. Similar to the SHAPE, cgSHAPE-70 seq reacts with 2\u2019-OH of A, U, G, or C at similar rates. This can potentially increase the scope 71 and accuracy of proximity-induced chemical reactions on RNAs for mapping purposes. 72\nWe further developed RNA-degrading chimeras by replacing the 2\u2019-OH acylating moiety with 73 RNase L recruiter (RLR) moieties on the cgSHAPE probe, as well as by conjugating the RLR 74 moieties on other putative solvent accessible site on the RNA ligand. RNA-degrading chimera 75 utilizing endogenous ribonuclease (RNase) L was first reported by the Silverman group in 76 199322. Recently, the modality of RNA-degrading chimera was further developed by the Disney 77 group and was demonstrated to be active using small-molecule RNA ligands23\u201330 (Fig. 1c). The 78 Disney group also coined the name ribonuclease targeting chimera or RIBOTAC for this type of 79\nRNA degraders. RIBOTACs were shown efficacious to degrade microRNA in cells24,25 and 80 mouse models26. Importantly, a small-molecule RIBOTAC was recently used to degrade the 81 SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome by targeting an RNA structure named attenuator hairpin near the 82 programmed frameshift (PFS) regulatory element23. The viral RNA transcript level was shown to 83 be reduced in a model cell system by ~50% at 8 \u03bcM RIBOTAC23. Antisense-based RNA-84 degrading chimeras targeting spike-protein or envelope-protein encoding RNAs were also 85 demonstrated efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells28. Our optimized RIBOTAC robustly 86 degraded SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cellular models at 1 \u03bcM and inhibited virus replication at 20 \u00b5M 87 in lung epithelial cells. No significant toxicity was observed. Interestingly, we discovered the 88 natural RNase L binding moiety is similar or less active than the synthetic RLR in the RIBOTAC 89 modality. 90\nResults 99\nChemical optimization of the coumarin derivatives for SL5 RNA binding 100\nWe previously synthesized a collection of coumarin derivatives that are known to bind to 101 RNAs31. Each of these coumarin derivatives is fluorescent (excitation/emission = 400/480 nm), 102 enabling us to use fluorescence polarization (FP) to determine the in vitro binding affinity with 103 the RNA receptors. We in vitro transcribed SL5 RNA (144\u2013303, RefSeq NC_045512) and 104 screened the compound library using the FP assay (Extended Data Fig. 1). C2 binds to SL5 at a 105 dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.45 \u03bcM (Table 1). Elimination of the ethyl substituent on the A ring 106 (C4) did not improve the binding affinity to SL5 RNA (Table 1). In contrast, a bulky substituent 107 on the A ring (C6) impeded the interaction with SL5 (Table 1). This indicated that a non-108 sterically hindered linker might be suitable for conjugation on ring A without affecting the ligand 109 binding affinity to SL5 RNA. We found C29 the best ligand in our compound collection, which 110 binds to SL5 RNA at a Kd of 0.47 \u03bcM. Comparing to C4, C29 has a different set of substituents 111 on ring E, and therefore, we further investigated ring E while keep ring A as unsubstituted 112 piperazine (Table 1). In vitro FP assay showed that a fluorinated analog, C30, further improves 113 the binding affinity (Kd = 0.22 \u00b5M). Changing the F group into Cl (C32) or CF3 (C36) groups or 114 alternating the fluorinated site (C31) all reduced the binding affinities (Table 1). To our 115 knowledge, C30 is the strongest small-molecule ligand to the SARS-CoV-2 SL5 RNA. 116\ncgSHAPE-seq uncovered the bulged G in SL5 as the C30 binding site 120\nWe were inspired by a commonly used method for RNA structure elucidation called SHAPE and 121 sought to develop a new chemical-guided sequencing-based method to identify the binding site 122 of C30 in SL5 RNA. We named the new chemical probing method chemical-guided SHAPE 123 sequencing, or cgSHAPE-seq. Conventional SHAPE uses electrophilic reagents that can form 124 ester adducts on the 2\u2019-OH of the ribose. The unpaired nucleotides have higher accessibility for 125 acylation reactions, which is the basis of structure-based differential acylation activity. 126 Therefore, identification of the acylation site would provide information in RNA base-pairing in 127\nthe conventional SHAPE. Importantly, the electrophile-ribose adduct can create a mutation 128 during reverse transcription (i.e., primer extension). As a result, conventional SHAPE coupled 129 with quantitative mutational profiling has become a gold standard method to explore RNA 130 topology in vitro and in vivo32\u201336. The key advantage of SHAPE is that the electrophile can 131 usually react with all four nucleotides (A, U, G, or C) with similar activity. We wondered if the 132 ribose acylation could be repurposed for identification of small-molecule binding sites by 133 covalently linking electrophile moieties to RNA-binding chemical ligands. 134\nFirst, we selected furoyl acylimidazole (FAI) as the electrophile for synthesizing the chemical 135 probe. Compared to other electrophile moieties such as anhydride and acyl cyanide, FAI is 136 more resistant to hydrolysis with a half-life of 73 min in H2O37,38. The hydrolysis-resistant probe 137 design renders the synthesis and storage less demanding for anhydrous experimental facilities. 138 An azide group on the furoyl moiety was used to provide a click-chemistry handle to conjugate 139 with C30 (Fig. 2a). After the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, the carboxylic acid was then converted 140 into an acyl imidazole moiety under a mild condition, finalizing the synthesis of C30-FAI probe 141 (Fig. 2a). The acyl imidazole probe was prepared freshly and used directly without further 142 purification (see Method). We tested the reactivity of FAI-N3 with a denatured RNA and 143 confirmed that FAI-N3 can react with all four nucleotides and generate SHAPE signal at a high 144 concentration (Extended Data Fig. 2). 145\nNext, we applied C30-FAI in SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR RNA to elucidate the binding site of C30. It is 146 known that conventional SHAPE experiments usually require high concentration (10\u2013100 mM) 147 of acyl imidazole (e.g., FAI) for ribose acylation. To avoid obtaining structure-based differential 148 acylation activity caused by FAI moiety alone, we chose to use a much lower dose of the 149 chemical probe for cgSHAPE-seq. We reasoned that at low concentration of the probe (0.02\u20131 150 mM), the differential acylation activity would be predominantly caused by ligand binding (i.e., 151 proximity-promoted acylation). Briefly, the total RNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR 152 expressing cells (see Method) and refolded in buffer. C30-FAI, FAI-N3, or DMSO was 153 individually reacted with the folded RNA for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. After the reaction, we used 154 ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of MnCl2 (3 mM) for 155 primer extension using a protocol modified from the literature report (see Method)32. The cDNA 156 was then amplified by PCR in the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR region and the resulting amplicon was 157 subsequently sequenced. We applied an existing software package ShapeMapper2 developed 158 by the Weeks group for mutational profiling analysis32,39. We calculated the background 159 \u0394mutation rate (FAI-N3 \u2013 DMSO) for each nucleotide and pleasingly observed a low background 160 signal at 0.02 and 0.1 mM of FAI-N3, indicating that the structure-based differential acylation 161 activity is negligible in cgSHAPE-seq at these concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 3). We then 162 calculated the RNA ligand-induced \u0394\u0394mutation rate [(C30-FAI \u2013 DMSO) \u2013 (FAI-N3 \u2013 DMSO)] for 163 each nucleotide and identified G174 as the only significantly mutated nucleotides in 0.1 mM 164 probe-treated samples (Fig. 2b,c). In 1 mM probe treated samples, a lower signal-to-noise ratio 165 was observed even though the mutational result also implied the G174 as the primary C30 166 binding site (Fig. 2d). At 1 mM, FAI-N3 also significantly increased the \u0394mutation rate at G174, 167 implying the contribution of structure-based SHAPE activities started to emerge (Fig. 2d). 168 Mapping the nucleotide with previously identified secondary structures uncovered that G174 is a 169 single-nucleotide bulge in the SL5 stem region8\u201312. 170\nWe then validated the C30 binding site in SL5 by testing individual substructures of the SL5 181 RNA. The loop region of SL5A, SL5B, and a minimized four-helix junction, named SL5M 182 (containing shorter stems) were synthesized chemically or enzymatically (Fig. 3a). The in vitro 183 binding results demonstrated that only SL5M retained similar binding affinity to C30 (Fig. 3a, 184 Extended Data Fig. 4). To further validate the putative binding site G174 in SL5M, we designed 185 and synthesized SL5M RNAs with different mutations that disrupt the bulged G or other RNA 186 structures (Fig. 3b). As expected, deletion of G174 or base-pairing G174 with an additional C 187 both resulted in a 7-fold decrease in binding affinity to C30. Replacement of G174 with A, C or U 188 also significantly reduced C30 binding. We also expanded the bulged G by inserting different 189 nucleotides between C173 and U175 or between A270 and G271, all these mutated RNAs were 190 demonstrated 5\u20136-fold reduced binding affinity to C30. These results suggested the importance 191 of a single bulged G in accommodating C30\u2019s binding. Changing the closing U-A base pair into 192 C-G (3\u2019-end of G174) or C-G base pair into U-A (5\u2019-end of G174) also resulted in a 4-fold 193 decreased binding. Mutations on other parts of the RNA has less impact (i.e., within 2-fold) in 194 changing the binding affinity to C30 (Fig. 3b). Altogether, these observations validated that the 195 bulged G region is the primarily binding site in SL5 RNA for C30. We concluded that cgSHAPE-196 seq is a validated method for identifying the binding site of RNA-binding small molecules. 197\nComparison of two RNase L recruiting moieties in RIBOTACs 201\nWe then conjugated C30 with RLRs to synthesize SL5-targeting RNA degraders (RIBOTACs). 202 Two different conjugation sites were used on rings A and E of C30, respectively (Fig. 4a). For 203 RLR conjugation on the A ring, the acylating moiety in the above cgSHAPE probe (C30-FAI) 204 was replaced with RLR moieties. We notice that in most reported co-NMR structures of RNA 205 bulges and small molecules that are similar to C30, both ends of the small molecules are 206 solvent accessible40\u201342. Therefore, ring E was also explored for conjugation to RLRs. We 207 replaced the electronegative fluorine atom on ring E into an oxygen, which was further used for 208 RLR attachment (Fig. 4a). 209\nFor RLR moieties, the natural RNase L ligand 2\u2019-5\u2019-lined oligoadenylate (2-5A) and its synthetic 210 mimic D1 were both previously reported to be used in RNA-degrading chimeras (Extended Data 211\nFig. 5)23,24. Combining the two conjugation sites and two RLR structures, we obtained four 212 RIBOTAC candidates, C47, C48, C64, and C65, for SL5 RNA degradation (Fig. 4a). We 213 validated that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker on 2-5A does not affect the activity in a 214 reported RNase L degradation assay with a 5\u2019 6-fluorescein-tagged model RNA containing 215 multiple RNase L cleavage sites43,44 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). It was demonstrated that the 216 binding affinity between RNase L and D1 (Kd \u2248 18 \u03bcM) is 80,000-fold weaker than that observed 217 for 2-5A43. Consistent with this reported in vitro binding data, the synthetic D1 alone is > 10,000 218 times weaker than 2-5A in the in vitro RNase L degradation assay (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). 219\nNext, we tested the four RIBOTACs in the RNase L degradation assay with purified SL5 RNA 220 and observed their activities in order: C64 > C47 \u2248 C48 > C65 (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6a). 221 To our surprise, the RIBOTAC C64 with D1 as the RLR moiety is much stronger than C65 with 222 2-5A at 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 4b). This result is contrary to what we would have predicted based on the 223 activities of the RLR moieties per se. We validated these in vitro findings in SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 224\nUTR expressing 293T cells. In this cell model, the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR sequence was fused to 225 a CMV promoter-controlled Gaussia luciferase expression cassette (Fig. 4c; for sequences, see 226 Method). Consistent with the RNase L degradation assay result, the maximum potency of C64 227 (i.e., RNA reduction level) was significantly better than C65 (Fig. 4c). The activities of C47 and 228 C48 in this cell model are similar, between those of C64 and C65 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). 229\nEfficacy of RIBOTAC in live virus infection assay 237\nFinally, we tested the activity of C64 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was 238 engineered to include a Nano Luciferase (NLuc) reporter by fusing NLuc onto ORF7 of the 239 SARS-CoV-2 genome45. In this way, the NLuc signal is proportional to the viral protein copy 240 number in cells. We applied a human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line A549 expressing high 241 level of ACE2 as the host cell45. The cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2-NLuc virus at a 242 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.0 at 1 h before the treatment with RIBOTACs C64 for 3 d. To 243 our satisfactory, C64 showed > 95% inhibition at 20 \u03bcM (Fig. 4d). At the same concentration, no 244 major toxicity is observed in A549 cells (Fig. 4d). 245\nDiscussion 246 cgSHAPE-seq has several potential limitations in application. For example, the FAI-based 247 probes used in this report would not be compatible with strong nucleophilic RNA ligands14 due 248 to self-reaction. In addition, as shown in conventional SHAPE, FAI moiety has a higher reactivity 249\ntowards unpaired RNA nucleotides. Although most of reported RNA ligands targets the unpaired 250 region46,47, cgSHAPE-seq may be less reactive for ligands that binds to the double-stranded 251 RNA grooves. Finally, in our model denatured RNA, FAI-N3 react with all four nucleotides. 252 However, the reactivity of FAI-N3 and A, U, G, and C are not equal. In this model, we found FAI-253 N3 has a higher reactivity bias towards G and against U (Extended Data Fig. 2). For this reason, 254 the cgSHAPE activities on G and U might be over- and under-estimated, respectively. 255\nIn our cgSHAPE-seq result, apart from G174, we also observed a cluster of nucleotides from 256 A131 to G149 showing slightly higher mutation rate than others (Fig. 2c). This can be potentially 257 caused by the nonspecific binding of C30 with flexible sequence31. RNA targeting strategies are 258 known to have off-target effects due to shallow binding sites on RNAs and relatively weak 259 binding affinity for small molecules. C64 at 3 \u03bcM can cause 13 gene down regulation 260 (log2FoldChange < \u20132) and > 23 gene upregulation (log2FoldChange > 2) in the transcriptome 261 (Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Table S1). The activity of the RIBOTAC might be 262 improved if a more potent and selective RNase L recruiter is used48. Specifically, we showed 263 that the natural RNase L recruiter/activator 2-5A, which is negatively charged, is sometimes not 264 compatible with the positively charged RNA binder C30 (Fig. 4b). For this reason, new synthetic 265 RNase L recruiter should probably be considered to be neutral or positively charged as most of 266 the reported RNA ligands are also positively charged49\u201351. 267\nIn summary, we developed a new generalizable chemical probing method called cgSHAPE-seq 268 for quickly identifying small molecule-RNA binding sites by sequencing. cgSHAPE probes react 269 with the 2\u2019-OH groups on the ribose close to the binding sites with a mitigated dependency of 270 the nucleobase identity observed in other reported methods. We used cgSHAPE-seq to identify 271 a bulged G on SL5 as the primary binding site on the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR targeted by the 272 newly discovered coumarin derivative C30. Finally, we developed a novel C30-based RNA 273 degrader (RIBOTAC) capable of degrading viral RNA transcripts in cells and inhibiting virus 274 replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, offering crucial insights into RNA degrading chimeras' 275 design. 276\nReferences 277 1.

The reaction mixture contains ~75% C30-FAI and ~25% unreacted C30-415 FCA (see Supplementary Information) and was used directly in RNA modification. The stock 416 solution was used as a 75 mM and can be stored at \u201380 \u00b0C for long-term storage. 417\ncgSHAPE-seq using Total RNA Extract from Cells 418\nSARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR expressing cells were harvested and pelleted. Total RNA was extracted 419 using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) per the user\u2019s manual. An on-column DNA digestion was 420 performed to remove the residual genomic DNA in total RNA using DNase I (10 U/\u03bcL, Roche) 421 and RDD buffer (Qiagen). Purified total RNA was dissolved in water and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C before 422 use. For RNA modification, 5 \u03bcg total RNA was used for each reaction. C30-FAI and FAI-N3 423 were prepared at 20 mM, 2 mM, and 0.4 mM in DMSO as 20\u00d7 working solution. Briefly, total 424 RNA was added water and 5\u00d7 folding/reaction buffer (500 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 500 mM KCl, 30 425 mM MgCl2) to make a 47.5 \u03bcL solution. The solution was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to refold. 426 2.5 \u03bcL C30-FAI (cgSHAPE probe), FAI-N3 (background control) or DMSO was added to the 427 total RNA and mix well by pipetting. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min and then 428 quenched by adding RLT buffer (Qiagen). The RNA was then extracted using RNeasy kit 429\n(Qiagen). 500 ng total RNA was used for reverse transcription and then PCR as described 430 below. All reactions were performed in triplicates. 431\nFor reverse transcription (10 \u03bcL reaction), probe or DMSO treated RNA and reverse 432 transcription primer (0.5 \u03bcM in final reaction buffer) were heated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min and snap-433 cooled on ice for 1min. 5\u00d7 reaction buffer (375 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MnCl2, pH 434 7.4, 2 \u03bcL), DTT (100 mM, 1 \u03bcL), dNTP (10 mM, 0.5 \u03bcL), ProtoScript II (0.5 \u03bcL, New England 435 Biolabs, M0368L) and RNase inhibitor (0.2 \u03bcL, ApexBio, K1046) were added. The reaction was 436 incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h and deactivated at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. In each PCR reaction (50 \u03bcL), 437 cDNA (2.5 \u03bcL) was mixed with Phire Hot Start II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher, 1 \u03bcL), dNTP 438 (10 mM, 1 \u03bcL), 5\u00d7 Phire Green reaction buffer (10 \u03bcL), primers (0.5 \u03bcM in final reaction buffer) 439 and water (35.5 \u03bcL). After reaction, the amplicon was purified using a DNA Clean & 440 Concentrator kit (Zymo Research) following user\u2019s manual. The purified DNA was submitted for 441 next-generation sequencing (Amplicon-EZ, Azenta Life Sciences). 442\nAn integrated software package developed by Busan and Weeks, ShapeMapper2 was used to 443 analyze the fastq files for mutational profiling and the rresult was used to generate Figures 2b, 444 2c, and Extended Data Fig. 339.

For RNase L degradation of SL5 RNA, T7 transcribed SL5 RNA was first purified by 460 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and recovered using small-RNA PAGE Recovery Kit 461 (Zymo Research, R1070). RNase L (1.3 \u00b5g in 5 \u00b5L) was incubated in the presence of C47, C48, 462 C64, C65, or DMSO control in the cleavage buffer (final reaction volume is 8 \u00b5L) at 4 \u00b0C for 12 463 h. The 1X cleavage buffer contains 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 50 464 \u00b5M ATP, and 7 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The SL5 RNA (120 ng in 2 \u00b5l H2O) was then added into 465 the reaction mixture and incubated for another 2 h at 22 \u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by 466 adding RNA Gel Loading Dye (Thermo Fisher, R0641) at 1:1 ratio. The samples (4 \u00b5l) were 467 then loaded on TBE-urea polyacrylamide gel (20%) for electrophoresis (180 V for 85 min). The 468\ngel was stained with SYBR safe (1/50,000, ApexBio, A8743) in TBE buffer for 1 min and 469 visualized on gel imager (Thermo Fisher, iBright FL1500). 470\nThe RNA sequence of SL5 used in this assay is: 5\u2019-471 UCGUUGACAGGACACGAGUAACUCGUCU 472 AUCUUCUGCAGGCUGCUUACGGUUUCGUCCGUGUUGCAGCCGAUCAUCAGCACAUCUA473 GGUUUCGUCCGGGUGUGACCGAAAGGUAAGAUGGAGAGCCUUGUCCCUGGUUUCAACG474 A. 475\nFor RNase L degradation of a model 6-FAM-tagged RNA, RIBOTACs in the above protocol 476 were replaced with D1 (0.37 \u00b5g in 0.75 \u00b5l DMSO) or 2-5A-N3 (0.12 ng in 0.75 \u00b5l H2O)43,44. After 477 electrophoresis, the gel was not stained and was directly visualized on the gel imager at the 6-478 FAM fluorescence channel. The 6-FAM RNA (5\u2019-6-FAM-479 UUAUCAAAUUCUUAUUUGCCCCAUU 480 UUUUUGGUUUA-BHQ) was purchased from IDT. 481\n482\nSARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR Expressing Stable Cell Line 483\n293T cells (Thermo Fisher, R70007) were cultured in DMEM growth medium (Gibco, 11995040) 484 supplemented with 10% FBS (Cytiva, SH30910.03) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco, 485 15240062) at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. For producing the lentivirus, 293T cells were 486 seeded in a 6-well plate (Fisher, FBO12927) at 3 x 105 cells per well and transfected with 1 \u00b5g 487 of SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR expressing lentivirus vector (pLV-SARS-CoV-2-5\u2019UTR-GLuc) along with 488 the packaging plasmids pMD2.G (0.4 \u00b5g) and psPAX2 (0.6 \u00b5g) using Lipofectamine 2000 489 (Invitrogen, 11668019). At 24 h post-transfection, the cell medium was replaced with fresh 490 growth medium. 48 h after the change of media, the supernatant containing the lentivirus 491 particles was siphoned and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris. 492 The virus particles were further concentrated at 10X in volume using Lenti-X-concentrator 493 (Clontech, PT4421-2) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The lentivirus can be quantified 494 using literature method52. Usually, 107\u2013108 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL lentivirus was obtained 495 after the concentrator treatment. For lentiviral transduction, 293T cells were inoculated with the 496 concentrated viral suspension (multiplicity of infection ~10) using polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, TR-497 1003-G) at a final concentration of 8 \u03bcg/mL. At 24 h post-transduction, the culture medium was 498 replaced with fresh growth media. After recovery for 24 h, the transduced cells were then 499 selected in blasticidin (10 \u03bcg/mL, Invivogen, ant-bl) for 2 weeks. For stable single clone 500 selection, the cells were diluted in the growth medium containing blasticidin (10 \u03bcg/mL) to a final 501 density of 1 cell per 100 \u00b5L. The diluted cell suspension was then dispensed to a 96-well plate 502 (100 \u00b5L per well). The plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 weeks. A single cell colony from one 503 of the wells was then selected for experiments. 504\npLV-SARS-CoV-2-5UTR-Luc was constructed by inserting the SARS-CoV-2 5\u2019 UTR and 505 Gaussian luciferase into the pLV vector, under the control of the CMV promoter.

The cells were then treated with the compounds 522 (C47, C48, C64, or C65) at various concentrations (1.3 nM\u20133 \u00b5M) for 48 h. After treatment, the 523 supernatant was aspirated from each well and the total RNA was then extracted from the cells 524 using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74104). The total RNAs were quantified by ultraviolet absorption 525 at 260 nm (Thermo Fisher, NanoDrop 1000). Usually 10\u201320 \u03bcg total RNA was obtained from 526 each well. cDNAs were synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA for each sample using M-MLV 527 reverse transcriptase (Promega, M1701) and (dT)25 according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 1 528 \u00b5l of cDNA mixture was used in a 15 \u00b5l RT-qPCR reaction (Apex-Bio, K1070). The human 529 GAPDH RNA level was used as the reference for normalization. The RT-qPCR primer 530 sequences used for the PCR are shown below: 531\nSL5-SYBR-FW: 5\u2019-CGTTGACAGGACACGAGTAA 532\nSL5-SYBR-RV: 5\u2019-TTGAAACCAGGGACAAGGCTC 533\nGAPDH-FW: 5\u2019-GACAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT 534\nGAPDH-RV: 5\u2019-CAGGACGCATTGCTGATGAT 535\n536\nSARS-CoV-2 Inhibition Assay 537\nVero-E6 cells (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586\u2122) and A549 cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-185) were cultured in 538 Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Cytiva Life Science, SH30022) with addition of 539 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Millipore Sigma, F0926) at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. 540 A549 cells were transduced with a human ACE2-expressing lentivirus vector, and the 541 transduced were cultured in the DMEM plus 2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L puromycin45. 542\nVirus and titration 543\nSARS-CoV-2-Nluc was created by engineering the nanoluciferase (Nluc) gene into the OFR7 of 544 the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The insertion site of Nluc at ORF7 was based on previous 545 mNeonGreen reporter SARS-CoV-253. The virus was propagated in Vero-E6 cells once, 546 aliquoted in DMEM, and stored at \u201380\u02daC. A biosafety protocol to work on SARS-CoV-2 in the 547 BSL3 Lab was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of Kansas 548 Medical Center. 549\nPlaque assay54,55 550\nVero-E6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 0.5 \u00d7106 cells per well. A virus stock 551 was serially diluted at 10-fold in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4 (DPBS). 200 \u00b5L of 552 the diluent were added to each well and incubated for 1 h on a rocking rotator. After removing 553 the virus diluent, 0.5 mL of overlay media (1% methylcellulose in DMEM with 5% FBS) were 554 added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 4 days. The 555 methylcellulose overlays were aspirated, and the cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde 556 solution for 30 min and stained with 1% crystal violet solution followed by extensive washing. 557 Plaques in each well were counted and multiplied by the dilution factor to determine the virus 558 titer at pfu/mL. 559\nDetermination of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)45,56 560\nACE2-A549 cells were seeded into 96 well plates. When the cells were confluent, SARS-CoV-2-561 NLuc viruses were diluted with cold PBS and added into each well at a multiplicity of infection 562 (MOI) of 2 (2 pfu/cell). The plates were kept in the CO2 incubator for 1 hour. Compound C64 563 was diluted at 2 x serials from 20 \u00b5M to 0.002 \u00b5M. The virus-PBS solution was aspirated. Each 564 well was washed with cold PBS three times, and was loaded with the diluted compounds. Each 565 concentration was loaded in triple wells in the plates, and the total volume of each well was 0.2 566 mL. The plates were kept in the incubator. After 3 days post-infection, the culture media were 567 aspirated from each well and the wells were washed with PBS for three times. The nano-568 luciferase activity assay (Promega, N1110) was carried out by following the manufacturer\u2019s 569 instructions. Briefly, 100 ul of cell lysis buffer were added to each well for 10 minutes to 570 completely lyse the cells. Then 100 ul of nano-luciferase reaction reagent were add to each well 571 and the luminescent signal was determined at A490 absorbance on a plate reader (Bio-Tek, 572 Synergy). The IC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. 573\n574\nStatistical Analysis 575\nAll data shown as means \u00b1 s.d. with sample size (N) listed for each experiment. Statistical 576 analysis was carried out with Prism GraphPad 8.0. Unpaired two-sample t-tests were used to 577 analyze significant differences between the group means. The P values were calculated by 578 Prism GraphPad 8.0 or R. For data generated from ShapeMapper2, the standard error (stderr) 579 associated with the mutation rate at a given nucleotide in the S (probe treated) or U (DMSO 580\ntreated) samples was calculated as: stderr = \u221a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52/\u221a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60. The standard error of the 581\n\u0394mutation rate at a given nucleotide is: \u221a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc46 2 + \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc48 2 . 582\n583\nData Availability 584\nThe cgSHAPE-seq data for C30-FAI, FAI-N3 or DMSO-treated total RNAs, and RNA-seq data 585 for C64-treated cells were deposited in NCBI SRA with accession numbers PRJNA950557 and 586 PRJNA947619, respectively. 587\n588\nReferences 589\n52.
