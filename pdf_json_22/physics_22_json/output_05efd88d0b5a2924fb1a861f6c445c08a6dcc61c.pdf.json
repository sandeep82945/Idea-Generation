    "abstractText": "We perturbatively compute the Polyakov loop potential at high temperature with finite imaginary angular velocity. This imaginary rotation does not violate the causality, and the thermodynamic limit is well defined. We analytically show that the imaginary angular velocity induces the perturbatively confined phase and serves as a new probe to confinement physics. We discuss a possible phase diagram that exhibits adiabatic continuity from the perturbative confinement to the confined phase at low temperature. We also mention subtlety in the analytical continuation from imaginary to real angular velocity by imposing a causality bound.",

This imaginary rotation does not violate the causality, and the thermodynamic limit is well defined. We analytically show that the imaginary angular velocity induces the perturbatively confined phase and serves as a new probe to confinement physics. We discuss a possible phase diagram that exhibits adiabatic continuity from the perturbative confinement to the confined phase at low temperature. We also mention subtlety in the analytical continuation from imaginary to real angular velocity by imposing a causality bound.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.242002\nIntroduction.\u2014Confinement of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has been a long-standing problem. There are traditional strategies to idealize the problem. One can take special limits such as the strongcoupling limit [1,2], the large-Nc limit [3], etc. to scrutinize the confinement mechanism in a nonperturbative and yet analytical way. Such deformations of the theory belong to a category which we call the QCD-like theory approach. Examples of QCD-like theories include holographic QCD models [4\u20136] and a supersymmetric extension [7\u201310]. In particular, an interesting idea of the \u201cadiabatic continuity\u201d on a small circle [10\u201312] based on the Polyakov mechanism [13] has been recognized. Another stream of research toward the confinement\nmechanism is the introduction of external parameters corresponding to extreme environments such as the temperature T, the density or the chemical potential \u03bc, the magnetic field B, and so on, which we call the extreme QCD approach [14,15]. QCD at high temperature is perturbatively tractable, and the loop calculation of the confinement order parameter, i.e., the Polyakov loop, has led to a deconfined phase [16\u201320] (for a review, see Ref. [21]). Generally speaking, extreme environments provide an energy scale greater than the QCD scale, so that the perturbative calculation in favor of deconfinement is justified. The perturbative analysis breaks down with decreasing T=\u03bc=B, and it is usually impossible to go into the confinement regime. Nevertheless, one may perceive a precursory tendency of a confinement phase transition (see\nalso Refs. [22,23] for approaches to enforce confinement to come closer to the transition point). One could also employ other external probes like the electric field E [24], the isospin chemical potential \u03bciso [25,26], the scalar curvature R [27,28], the rotational angular velocity \u03c9 [29\u201336], and their mixtures [37,38]. Since an extraordinary value of \u03c9 \u223c 1022 s\u22121 was reported in the heavy-ion collision experiment [39], the effect of as large \u03c9 as the QCD scale has been attracting theoretical and experimental interests. Model calculations implied similarity between the angular velocity and the chemical potential [30], which was summarized in a form of the QCD phase diagram on an \u03c9-T plane [31]. The lattice-QCD simulation suffers from the sign problem at finite \u03c9 in the same way as the finite-\u03bc case. However, the lattice-QCD simulation with the analytical continuation from the imaginary angular velocity \u03a9I to \u03c9 via \u03a9I \u00bc \u2212i\u03c9 is feasible because \u03a9I does not cause the sign problem [29,34,35]. Here, we shall emphasize that such a system with imaginary rotation \u03a9I is quite intriguing on its own. With explicit calculations we show that the pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory at sufficiently large \u03a9I goes through a confinement phase transition even perturbatively. One might also obtain the perturbatively confining phase\nby adding finely tuned quark contents, such as a massless adjoint Dirac fermion with imaginary chemical potential, \u03bcI \u00bc \u03c0. However, the present Letter is the very first report of perturbative confinement from purely gluonic loops, to the best of our knowledge. In the literature, confining mechanisms that are essentially gluonic are all nonperturbative. They hinge on either semiclassical contribution [10\u2013 13], lattice regularization [1,2], electricity-magnetism duality [7\u20139], or dressed ghost and gluon propagators [40\u201343]. In contrast to these preceding works, surprisingly, we find that purely gluonic confinement in \u00f03\u00fe 1\u00deD is possible without invoking any nonperturbative machinery.

Under imaginary rotation by \u03a9I [32], we find a system of Euclidean cylindrical coordinates, i.e., x\u03bc \u00bc \u00f0\u03c4; \u03b8; r; z\u00de, with the flat metric g\u03bc\u03bd \u00bc diagf1; r2; 1; 1g and the following boundary condition:\n\u00f0\u03c4; \u03b8; r; z\u00de \u223c \u00f0\u03c4 \u00fe \u03b2; \u03b8 \u2212 \u03a9\u0303I; r; z\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03b2 \u00bc 1=T is inverse temperature and \u03a9\u0303I \u2254 \u03a9I=T. Clearly, \u03a9\u0303I and \u03a9\u0303I \u00fe 2\u03c0 describe the same geometry. In the presence of the Polyakov loop background, \u2202\u03c4 is replaced by the covariant derivative D\u03c4 as\nD\u03c4 \u00bc \u2202\u03c4 \u00fe i \u03d5 \u00b7H \u03b2 : \u00f02\u00de\nThe g-valued vector H is an orthonormal basis of a Cartan subalgebra of g, the Lie algebra of the gauge group. Thus the Polyakov loop is labeled with a real vector \u03d5. We take homogeneous \u03d5 backgrounds because they are the classical vacua even in the presence of \u03a9I. To perform the one-loop integral, we need to diagonalize\nthe fluctuation operator. For ghosts, it is the scalar Laplacian, \u2212D2s \u00bc \u2212D2\u03c4 \u2212 r\u22121\u2202r\u00f0r\u2202r\u00de \u2212 r\u22122\u22022\u03b8 \u2212 \u22022z . We solve the eigenequation, \u2212D2s\u03a6 \u00bc \u03bb\u03a6, with the twisted boundary condition (1) to find the spectrum. Since we are merely interested in a potential of \u03d5, we drop the eigenmodes that commute with H.

The loops of these unphysical eigenmodes are canceled by the ghost loop.

At \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc 0 mod 2\u03c0, Eq. (8) loses its r dependence and recovers the well-known GPY-W potential [16\u201318]. For a concrete reference, we shall focus on the rotation center r\u0303 \u00bc 0 in this Letter. However, we note that, at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0 mod 2\u03c0, the r-dependent potential in Eq. (8) results in homogeneous \u03d5 vacua in the SU(2) case. We shall shortly reveal that the most nontrivial physics exactly inhabits this homogeneous region, so that we can extend our conclusion to r\u0303 \u2260 0. At r\u0303 \u00bc 0we can complete the l summation to find:\nV\u00f0\u03d5;\u03a9\u0303I\u00dejr\u0303\u00bc0\u00bc \u03c02T4\n3\nX\n\u03b1\nX s\u00bc 1 B4\n\u03d5 \u00b7\u03b1\u00fes\u03a9\u0303I 2\u03c0\nmod 1\n: \u00f09\u00de\nHere B4\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc x4 \u2212 2x3 \u00fe x2 \u2212 \u00f01=30\u00de is the fourth Bernoulli polynomial. Equation (9) has quite rich physical contents despite its simple appearance. Perturbative confinement phase transition.\u2014We now investigate the evolution of the Polyakov loop potential with increasing \u03a9\u0303I . Let us start with the simplest SU(2)\n242002-2\ngauge group. Here we define \u03d5 \u2254 \u03d5 \u00b7 \u03b1 for the only positive root \u03b1. Modulo periodicities and the Weyl group, \u03d5 runs in \u00bd0; 2\u03c0 and the Z2 center symmetry acts as \u03d5 \u2192 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03d5. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the Polyakov loop potential in terms of \u03d5=2\u03c0 with increasing \u03a9\u0303I at r\u0303 \u00bc 0. The solid curve in Fig. 1 for \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc 0 reproduces the center breaking GPY-W potential with minima located at \u03d5 \u00bc 0 and 2\u03c0. The positive curvature around the minima then corresponds to the Debye screening mass that stabilizes the deconfined phase at high temperature [44]. We clearly see that the curvature is suppressed as \u03a9\u0303I gets larger, and eventually the sign of the curvature flips around \u03a9\u0303I \u2243 \u03c0=2. Then, the potential minima deviate from the deconfined vacua and the confined vacuum at \u03d5 \u00bc \u03c0 is energetically favored. We can visualize this phase transition by plotting hLi, the expectation value of the fundamental Polyakov loop L, as a function of \u03a9\u0303I as shown in Fig. 2. We see that hLi starts to decrease from \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u00f01 \u2212 1= ffiffiffi 3 p \u00de\u03c0. The dropping curve hits hLi \u00bc 0 at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0= ffiffiffi 3 p\n, indicating a second-order confinement phase transition. We can intuitively understand the confining force at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0 from the twisted geometry (1). It assigns the\nantiperiodic boundary condition to all odd-m transverse modes Eq. (6). But these modes still obey bosonic statistics such that their loops have no overall sign of \u22121. At r \u00bc 0, only the modes of m \u00bc 1 contribute. Such antiperiodic gluons reverse the one-loop potential just in analogy to periodic gluinos. We move on to the SU(3) case. The positive roots are \u03b11 \u00bc \u00f01; 0\u00de, \u03b12 \u00bc \u00f01=2; ffiffiffi 3 p =2\u00de, and \u03b13 \u00bc \u00f01=2;\u2212 ffiffiffi 3 p\n=2\u00de. Accordingly, the order parameter has two components, namely, \u03d5 \u00bc \u00f0\u03d51;\u03d52\u00de. Modulo periodicities and the Weyl group, \u03d5 runs in a triangular region spanned by the vertices (0,0), \u00f02\u03c0; 2\u03c0= ffiffiffi3p \u00de, and \u00f02\u03c0;\u22122\u03c0= ffiffiffi3p \u00de, as drawn in Fig. 3. The points in this triangle bijectively represent conjugacy classes of SU(3). The Z3 center symmetry acts on this equilateral triangle as its rotational geometry symmetry. We show the SU(3) potential height in the form of the contour plot in Fig. 3. The lighter (darker) color indicates the region of larger (smaller) potential values. The left-hand figure in Fig. 3 presents the potential profile at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc 0. The minima are located at (0,0) and its center symmetry images, which signifies the spontaneous breaking of center symmetry. With increasing \u03a9\u0303I , these minima depart from the conventional vacua as we observed in the SU(2) case. A crucial difference of SU(3) from the SU(2) case is, as shown in the middle of Fig. 3, the center symmetric point \u00f04\u03c0=3; 0\u00de is pushed down and eventually at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2 we see degeneracy between three shifted deconfined vacua and the center symmetric point. The degeneracy indicates a first-order phase transition, and the center symmetric (confining) state is energetically favored for \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0, as shown in the right-hand figure of Fig. 3. We can also visualize this first-order nature by plotting hLi as shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, we see a sudden jump of hLi at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2. This difference in the order of the phase transition between SU(3) and SU(2) is consistent with the universality class argument [45]. Our formulas hold for any semisimple Lie algebra. We can show that, for any simply connected compact gauge group with a nontrivial center, Eq. (9) at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0 always favors a center symmetric vacuum. For example, Spin(5) also exhibits a first-order confinement phase transition at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2. A more interesting case is G2 which has no center symmetry. Consistently, we observed no phase\n242002-3\ntransition; the location of its potential minimum just moves continuously as a function of \u03a9\u0303I . Phase diagram and adiabatic continuity.\u2014It is an intriguing question whether, on the \u03a9\u0303I-T plane, the perturbatively confined phase we found above is smoothly connected to the conventional confined phase. Although our loop calculations cannot constrain the low-T physics, the Kugo-Ojima-Gribov-Zwanziger (KOGZ) mechanism [40\u201342] still allows us to grasp some hints as follows. The ghost contribution to the one-loop potential that\nfavors confinement is just negative of Eq. (7) with Jm 1 replaced by Jm. Around r \u00bc 0, because only the m \u00bc 0 component remains, this ghost contribution does not depend on \u03a9\u0303I . At high T, perturbatively, this ghost potential cancels out with the contribution from unphysically polarized gluons. At low T, the KOGZ mechanism asserts that the ghost propagator is nonperturbatively enhanced at infrared (nearly divergently) [43]. Therefore, as the system is cooled down, the ghost makes the system increasingly confining, uniformly for any \u03a9\u0303I. Based on the arguments above, taking the SU(3) case, we\nsketch a phase diagram as shown in Fig. 4. A remarkable feature is the uniform confinement for all T around \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0. Let us elaborate our speculated physics in this region. Like the Debye mass in the deconfined phase, the string tension \u03c3 in the confined phase is indicated by the curvature of the effective potential around minima. Thus we have \u03c3 \u223c g2T2 at very high T. As we cool down the system, this perturbative string tension decreases until it reaches \u03c3 \u223c \u039b2YM, where \u039bYM is the dynamical scale from conformal anomaly. At smaller temperature the system goes into the nonperturbative confining region and the string tension is kept about \u03c3 \u223c \u039b2YM. In our speculated phase diagram in Fig. 4, our perturbatively confined phase around \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0 is connected to the conventional confined phase at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc 0 without a phase transition. Then, by adiabatic continuity, we can study quite a few features of the conventional confinement phase\ntransition even using loop calculations. For example, we already predicted the scaling of the string tension, the order of the phase transition, etc. It would be fascinating to examine our conjectured phase diagram, as well as the realization of adiabatic continuity, by feasible nonperturbative methods such as the lattice numerical simulation. Analytical continuation to real rotation.\u2014We finally apply our results to real rotation. It is customary in the literature to study the real rotation effect by the analytical continuation from \u03a9I to \u03c9 [34,35]. For example, once Tc\u00f0\u03a9\u0303I\u00de is known, then Tc\u00f0\u03c9\u00de is inferred from the replacement of \u03a92I \u00bc \u2212\u03c92. However, we explicate that such a procedure might be problematic using our perturbative expression. For any complex \u03a9\u0303I outside the real axis, Eq. (7) yields singularity at some \u03d5. In fact, our derivation of Eq. (8) is valid for real \u03a9\u0303I only. A nonzero Im\u03a9I would drive the Maclaurin series of ln\u00f01 \u2212 z\u00de out of its convergence radius. If we naively perform the analytical continuation to Eq. (8), we would also encounter the following problem. For r\u0303 > 0, Eq. (8) is analytical everywhere except on the imaginary \u03a9\u0303I axis. There, infinitely many poles are accumulated around \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc 0. As for r\u0303 \u00bc 0, the poles are gone, but the infinite summation just blows up for nonreal \u03a9\u0303I. The physical origin of these singularities is clear. At finite angular velocity \u03c9, the long-wave modes with k\u22a5 \u2272 \u03c9 violate the causality so we should introduce an infrared cutoff; i.e., r\u03c9 must not exceed the unity. Let us set the system size as r \u2264 R with R\u03c9 \u2264 1. This discretizes the momentum k\u22a5 such that k\u22a5R is a zero of the Bessel functions. Here, we denote the \u03bath zero of J\u03bd\u00f0\u03be > 0\u00de as \u03be\u03bd;\u03ba. The phase space integration in Eq. (7) is replaced as follows:\nZ\n\u221e\n0\nk\u22a5dk\u22a5J2m\u00f0k\u22a5r\u00def\u00f0k\u22a5\u00de\n\u2192 X\n\u221e\n\u03ba\u00bc1\n2\nR2J2m\u00fe1\u00f0\u03bem;\u03ba\u00de J2m \u03bem;\u03bar R f \u03bem;\u03ba R : \u00f010\u00de\nWe have performed the numerical integration and summation of Eq. (7) for real \u03c9 with Eq. (10) substituted. We cut off the sum over m, \u03ba, and the kz integration by sufficiently large numbers and confirm the convergence. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the SU(2) Polyakov loop potential with increasing \u03c9 at r\u0303 \u00bc 0. We chose the parameters as R \u00bc 10 GeV\u22121 (\u22432 fm) and T \u00bc 0.15 GeV. The potential minima are located at \u03d5 \u00bc 0 mod 2\u03c0 for any \u03c9, so that the system stays in the deconfined phase. Yet, we can quantify the effect of \u03c9 onto the vacuum stability by the potential curvature around the minimum which represents the Debye screening mass squared. As we see in Fig. 5, the curvature increases with increasing \u03c9, and this means that rotation favors deconfinement. This behavior makes a contrast to the results from Refs. [34,35], while the recent lattice results from Ref. [46] support our conclusion. We\n242002-4\nfound that the Polyakov loop potential even around r \u00bc 0 is sensitive to the system size R and the boundary treatments. We are now investigating the effects of boundary and axial symmetry breaking on the lattice to clarify the validity range of analytical continuation to real rotation. Outlook.\u2014An intriguing and immediate extension of our Letter would be the lattice simulation to explore the whole \u03a9\u0303I-T phase structure as conjectured in Fig. 4, complementary to preceding efforts [34,35] with a boundary condition. Actually, we can have the lattice simulation at our fingertips for \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2 and \u03c0 by moving to the Cartesian coordinates \u00f0\u03c4; x; y; z\u00de, where the boundary condition (1) reduces to \u00f0\u03c4; x; y; z\u00de \u223c \u00f0\u03c4 \u00fe \u03b2; y;\u2212x; z\u00de at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2 and \u00f0\u03c4; x; y; z\u00de \u223c \u00f0\u03c4 \u00fe \u03b2;\u2212x;\u2212y; z\u00de at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0, respectively. Therefore, for \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2 and \u03c0, we do not have to deal with nontrivial geometry, but just take the square lattice and the Cartesian spacetime only with a twisted thermal boundary condition. Once we manage to know the physics at \u03a9\u0303I \u00bc \u03c0=2 and \u03c0 for various temperatures, we can justify our speculated scenario of adiabatic continuity in Fig. 4. Another exciting extension is to include the fundamental or adjoint quark contributions and to discuss a relation to chiral symmetry.\nThe authors thank Maxim Chernodub, Yuki Fujimoto, andArataYamamoto for useful discussions.
