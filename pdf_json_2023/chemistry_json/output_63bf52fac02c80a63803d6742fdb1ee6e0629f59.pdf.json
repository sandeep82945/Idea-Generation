    "abstractText": "Although lithium\u2013sulfur batteries possess the highest theoretical capacity and lowest cost among all known rechargeable batteries, their commercialization is still hampered by the intrinsic disadvantages of low conductivity of sulfur and polysulfide shuttle effect, which is most critical. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to solving these difficulties for every part of Li\u2013S batteries. Separator modification with metal electrocatalysts is a promising approach to overcome the major part of these disadvantages. This work focuses on the development of Ni nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layer nitrogen-doped graphene supported by nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Ni@NGC) with different metal loadings as separator modifications. The effect of metal loading on the Li\u2013S electrochemical reaction kinetics and performance of Li\u2013S batteries was investigated. Controlling the Ni loading allowed for the modulation of the surface area-to-metal content ratio, which influenced the reaction kinetics and cycling performance of Li\u2013S cells. Among the separators with different Ni loadings, the one with 9 wt% Ni exhibited the most efficient acceleration of the polysulfide redox reaction and minimized the polysulfide shuttling effect. Batteries with this separator retained 77.2% capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5C, with a high sulfur loading of \u223c4.0 mg cm\u22122, while a bare separator showed 51.3% capacity retention after 200 cycles under the same conditions. This work reveals that there is a vast utility space for carbon-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles in electrochemical energy storage devices with optimal selection and rational design.",

Moreover, a multiphase solid\u2013liquid\u2013solid sulfur/LiPSs/sulde conversion is sluggish at the electrode/ electrolyte interface due to the insulating nature of sulfur and lithium sulde.5 In this regard, it is crucial to develop advanced sulfur-based cathode materials to accelerate the sulfur redox reaction, inhibit the dissolution of LiPSs and restrict their shuttle/diffusion.\nTremendous efforts have been made to enhance the LiPS conversion reaction kinetics and affinity of the conductive host material to LiPSs (physical blocking and chemical adsorption). Because of their high conductivity and large surface area, carbon materials including graphenes, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanobers (CNFs), and porous carbon materials are frequently employed in Li\u2013S batteries.2,6,7 However, physical adsorption is frequently ineffective at suppressing LiPS dissolution, but chemical interaction can efficiently anchor polar LiPS and inhibit their diffusion in the electrochemical processes of Li\u2013S batteries.8 Active materials such as transition metal compounds (-oxides,9\u201311 -suldes,12\u201314 -nitrides,15\u201317 etc.) exhibit strong chemical attraction to polar LiPS and enhance the reversible redox kinetics of sulfur compounds.

Moreover, the sluggish redox kinetics of the immobilized LiPS on these active materials would result in low utilization of sulfur and poor electrochemical performance of Li\u2013S batteries.18 In this regard, combination of a conductive carbon matrix with chemical/ physical adsorption ability and a metal with catalytic effects towards the reaction of solid\u2013liquid, liquid\u2013liquid and liquid\u2013 solid conversion of sulfur species is of great value for the construction of high-rate Li\u2013S batteries.19\u201322\nIncreasing attention has recently been paid to the use of conductive metal electrocatalysts to boost the rate of electrochemical reactions in Li\u2013S batteries. The promising electrocatalytic activity of single atoms and metal nanoparticles has been studied extensively as effective modication for host materials, interlayer membranes and separators.23\u201325 Among them, the separator modication is considered as a relative simple method that also eliminates direct mixing of sulfur and the material to avoid oxidation, which may affect the conductivity of carbon materials.26,27 Recently, due to their promising electrocatalytic activity, Ni nanoparticles and single atoms have been extensively studied for the separator modication. Yang et al. reported that Ni nanoparticles and Ni3Fe in nitrogendoped carbon nanotubes (Ni@NCNTs and Ni3Fe@NCNTs) can increase the reaction rate of liquid\u2013liquid and liquid\u2013solid conversion compared with the bare NCNT material, from the results of symmetric cells and Li2S nucleation.19 Xie et al. reported that graphene-impregnated Ni, Fe, and Co single atoms efficiently modied separators, reduced the potential gap and improved the cycle life of Li\u2013S batteries.21 Niu et al. reported that Ni single atoms are partially oxidized and formed a Ni\u2013N4 structure, which can act as a polysulde trap.28 In this regard, efficient immobilization of metal electrocatalysts and understanding the role of metal content/loading within a carbon matrix on the electrochemical reaction kinetics are critically important. However, such studies have rarely been reported in the literature up to date.\nHerein, Ni nanoparticles encapsulated in a few-layer Ndoped graphene supported by nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Ni@NGC) with different metal loadings were designed as separator modicators. Ni@NGC with different metal loadings of 18, 12, 9 and 7 wt%, denoted further as Ni@NGC_18, Ni@NGC_12, Ni@NGC_9 and Ni@NGC_7, respectively, were synthesized via carbonization and hot acidic treatment of a mixture of urea and Ni acetylacetonate taken in different molar ratios. With the increase in the molar ratio of urea, the formation of nanotubes on the surface of stacked sheets increased, which, in turn, favored the development of porous structures with a large active surface area. N-doped graphitic carbon and Ni nanoparticles, dispersed in the matrix, form a highly conductive network, which is benecial for a rapid electron transfer between LiPSs and the carbon matrix. The encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles with several layers of Ndoped graphenes eliminates the direct contact of metal nanoparticles with LiPSs, and thus suppresses their oxidization by LiPSs. The effect of Ni@NGC modication with 18, 12, 9 and 7 wt% Ni loadings on the reaction kinetics and their interaction with LiPSs were investigated. Modied separators with 9 wt% Ni\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The NGCmaterial showed amorphology similar to that of Ni@NGC, with the thickness of the coating of commercial separator (Celgard 2400) around 6 mm.\nFig. 3a displays the Raman spectra of NGC and Ni@NGC samples in the Raman shi ranging from 900 cm\u22121 to 2800 cm\u22121. Two peaks at about 1350 cm\u22121 and 1580 cm\u22121 found in all spectra are the characteristic features of carbonaceous materials. The peak at 1350 cm\u22121 (D band) corresponds to the defect in the carbon structure, whereas the peak at 1580 cm\u22121 (G band) has risen due to the graphitic carbon. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is increasing with the increase in the molar ratio of urea precursor, suggesting a higher degree of disorder and formation of carbon nanotubes in Ni@NGC, which is consistent with the XRD and SEM results.\nThe porous structure of the samples was further investigated by nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption measurements (Fig. 3b). Ni@NGC exhibited a type IV hysteresis in the relative pressure region of 0.4\u20130.9 P/P0 andmoderately smooth adsorption curves throughout the whole relative pressure region, indicating the presence of mesopores.31,32 The respective pore size distribution is also shown in Fig. 3c, which was calculated by the Barrett\u2013 Joyner\u2013Halenda (BJH) method. According to BJH, the average pore size of Ni@NGC materials was about 3.8 nm, and the corresponding BJH desorption cumulative pore volume was found to be equal to 0.101, 0.127, 0.144, 0.162 and 0.197 cm3 nm\u22121 g\u22121, while the specic surface area was calculated to be\nFig. 4 Surface XPS spectra of modified separators; (a) the general XPS sur\n9432 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 9428\u20139440\n93.5, 104.4, 117.1, 123.6 and 131.4 m2 g\u22121, for Ni@NGC_18, Ni@NGC_12, Ni@NGC_9, Ni@NGC_7 and NGC, respectively. Thus, controlling the molar ratio of Ni precursor to urea followed by hot acidic solution treatment is a key approach to increase the cumulative pore volume and surface area of Ni@NGC materials.\nThe surface composition and oxidation states of the Ni@NGC-modied separators were retrieved from the XPS analysis. The general survey spectrum (Fig. 4a) conrmed the presence of Ni, C, O, and N elements in the Ni@NGC samples with different Ni wt% loadings. The C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 4b) was deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.5, 285.8, and 288.5 eV, which corresponded to those of the C\u2013C, C\u2013N, and C\u2013O groups, respectively, among which the C\u2013C bonds were more dominant than others and nitrogen-doping of graphene layers was conrmed by the presence of the C\u2013N bonds.33 Highresolution N 1s spectrum (Fig. 4c) revealed different N-doping structures including pyridinic N at 398.4 eV, pyrrolic N at 399.4 eV, graphitic N at 400.5.0 eV and oxidized N at 403.8 eV. The contribution of each nitrogen structure was in the enhancement of the electronic conductivity and facilitating the surface adsorption ability of the carbon matrix by acting as a Lewis base substrate for polysulde species.34,35 The Ni 2p region showed the presence of peaks of 2p3/2, 2p1/2 and satellites, which could be assigned to the binding energies of metallic nickel (Fig. S1\u2020)."

The visual adsorption studies clearly showed that lithium polysulde impermeability was noticeably improved on the Ni@NGC-modied separators. The modied separators' adsorption capacity towards lithium polysulde was further analyzed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption tests (Fig. 7b). The results indicated that polysulde ions contributed to an adsorption peak between 200 and 350 nm, while the Ni@NGC_9 cell displayed a reduced intensity of this peak, suggesting increased impermeability.\nThe surface composition and oxidation states of the Ni@NGC-modied separators before and aer full adsorption of LiPSs were characterized by XPS analysis (Fig. 8) to investigate the interaction between LiPSs and Ni@NGC.

The peak tting results demonstrated a decrease in the Ni3+ content as the content of Ni wt% decreased as Ni3+ was reduced to Ni2+ with the increase in carbon amount.35 Nevertheless, the appearance of Ni2+ might be attributed to surface oxidation because of the exposure to the air. In contrast, the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum of Ni@NGC-Li2S6 showed characteristic peaks upshied to higher binding energies and an increased intensity in the Ni2+ region, indicating the electron transfer from surface-exposed nickel atoms to electron-rich sulfur atoms in Li2S6 (Fig. 8b and c).19 Moreover, Ni@NGC_9 demonstrated higher generation of thiosulfate species (S2O3\n2\u2212) and a polythionate complex (SxO6\n2\u2212) used as a polysulde shuttle suppressing the transfer mediator.35 Likewise, the Li2S2 peak was formed with a higher intensity with Ni@NGC_9 pointing at a more efficient lithium polysulde conversion into lithium suldes in contrast to other samples.37"

Fig. 9a shows that the cells with Ni@NGC_9, Ni@NGC_12 and NGC show a similar initial capacity at a lower current density, which can be explained with the effects of specic surface area and Ni content. Despite having a lower Ni content, the cell with Ni@NGC_9 demonstrated a similar capacity to the cell with Ni@NGC_12, which could be attributed to a higher specic surface area (117.1 and 104.4 m2 g\u22121, respectively).

At a higher current density, the cells with Ni@NGC_9 and Ni@NGC_12 exhibited a higher capacity than NGC, which can be explained by an improved reaction kinetics for the cells with Ni@NGC_9 and Ni@NGC_12 (Fig. 9b). Even at a high 3C rate, Ni@NGC_9 maintained a smaller polarization between the charge and discharge potential plateaus than the cells with other, Ni@NGC and NGC, modications, and bare PP separators at 3C rate (Fig. 9d). Longer plateaus at 3C in charge\u2013 discharge curves for Ni@NGC_9 indicate an increased polysulde adsorption capability and a stronger catalytic effect for the conversion of insoluble Li2S into polysuldes, and vice versa, in the cell.

The Li2S peak at \u223c375.0 cm\u22121 for the cell with the Ni@NGCmodied separator became dominant during the second reduction stage (polysuldes to Li2S) from 1.95 V and was present up to 1.93 V of the charge process. In contrast, the cell with an unmodied separator displayed the Li2S peaks with a lower intensity. The lower intensity can be explained by the incomplete reduction of sulfur at the endpoint. The complete sulfur conversion in the cell with the modied separator guarantees a better utilization of the active material, which is important for both capacity and cycling performance. Raman signals S4 2\u2212, S6 2\u2212, and S8\n2\u2212, as well as S8, reappeared when the potential increased up to 2.69 V in a subsequent charging process. Hence, in situ Raman measurements were able to demonstrate the acceleration of intermediate product generation (LiPSs), reaction kinetics, and improved utilization of active materials using a Ni@NGC-modied separator."

The efficient one-step carbonization and the following hot acidic treatment enabled the formation of a highly ordered Ndoped graphitic structure with encapsulated Ni nanoparticles. The separators modied with Ni@NGC with different Ni loadings performed benecially in all perspectives of battery electrochemistry towards stable cyclability and low polarization. The samples with a Ni loading of 9 wt% resulted in an effective ratio of surface area to the Ni content, which improved the reaction kinetics and cycling performance of Li\u2013S cells. Batteries with Ni@NGC_9 retained 77% capacity aer 200 cycles at 0.5C at a high sulfur loading of \u223c4.0 mg cm\u22122, while the cell with a bare separator retained only 51% of its capacity. Thus, the implementation of the Ni@NGC_9 composite as a modication to the PP separator is a promising opportunity to be also explored and employed in a wider range of practical applications in various energy storage systems.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
