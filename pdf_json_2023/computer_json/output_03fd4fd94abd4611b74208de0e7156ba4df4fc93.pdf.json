    "abstractText": "Many isothermal dissipative continuum problems can be formulated in a variational setting using the concept of \u201cstandard dissipative continua\u201d. A major advantage of this approach is that complex problems can be cast into a compact, thermodynamically consistent formulation based on a single space\u2013time continuous functional together with a corresponding variational principle. Formulating the problem in terms of a functional provides an immediate avenue for performing spatial and temporal discretization, which are the prerequisites for a numerical solution. Within the present contribution, a novel systematic approach to standard dissipative formulations is proposed, with the main goal being the development and implementation of generic procedures and algorithms for the formulation as well as the computational solution of a subset of isothermal dissipative continuum problems. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, its application to example problems is discussed.",

            "text": "Starting from classical continuum theories, recent decades have seen substantial developments towards the modeling of nonlinear dissipative multi-physics phenomena. Examples include electromechanical coupling in ferroelectric materials [1], magnetoelectromechanical coupling in multiferroic materials [2] as well as electrochemomechanical coupling in batteries [3] and hydrogels [4]. Although most continuum concepts are, in principle, readily extended to account for such multiphysics effects, the formulation of thermodynamically consistent theories and their solution by numerical methods becomes an increasingly tedious task as the number of coupled physics and, therefore, unknown variables increases. This is particularly of concern for:\n1. The model formulation in terms of a number of partial differential (or differential algebraic) equations, which may often be combined in many different ways to form a final set of space\u2013time continuous equations; 2. The mathematical analysis of the space\u2013time continuous equations, e.g., with regard to the well posedness of the problem and stability properties; 3. The development of consistent, robust and efficient spatial and temporal discretization schemes; 4. The numerical solution of the space\u2013time discrete problem.\nAn established approach to reduce the mentioned difficulties is to formulate continuum models in terms of variational principles based on a single functional of the unknowns instead of partial differential equations, so that the solution of the problem furnishes an extremum or a saddle point of the functional. This approach often provides a compact statement of the problem, which clearly exposes its structure, and thereby facilitates the mathematical analysis as well as the development of robust and efficient discretization and numerical solution procedures. The latter has, e.g., been demonstrated by Simo and Honein [5],\nAxioms 2023, 12, 267. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms12030267 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nOrtiz and Stainier [6], and Hackl and Fischer [7] in the context of plasticity and viscoplasticity, by Yang et al. [8] in the context of thermomechanically coupled problems, and by Carstensen et al. [9] and Ortiz and Repetto [10] in the context of micro-structure formation. Of particular interest in this regard is the concept of \u201cstandard dissipative continua\u201d (see, e.g., Halphen and Nguyen [11], Germain et al. [12]), which effectively involves minimum or saddle point formulations, with thermodynamic consistency being ensured by choosing a so-called dissipation functional to satisfy certain conditions. Examples illustrating the wide applicability of this concept are, e.g., the early work of Biot [13] on fluid transport in porous media as well as a multitude of contributions covering the homogenization of inelastic micro-structures [14,15], gradient-enhanced plasticity [16\u201320], rate-dependent ferroelectricity [21], magnetostriction with hysteresis [22], electro-magneto-mechanics [2], fluid transport in porous media [23], Cahn\u2013Hilliard-type and classical diffusion [24,25], and fracture in lithium-ion batteries [26]. Regardless of whether differential (algebraic) equations or a functional together with a variational principle are chosen as the point of departure, the mere implementation effort required to obtain validated numerical software remains a substantial obstacle, especially in the case of multiphysics problems. Due to this aspect, many sophisticated continuum formulations are often only demonstrated for highly simplified situations (e.g., one-dimensional problems), while their application to real-world examples remains elusive. This aspect provides the main motivation for the present contribution. In particular, a systematic approach to standard dissipative formulations is proposed, which covers the steps from problem formulation in the space\u2013time continuous setting through its discretization to implementation. The plan of the paper is as follows: Firstly, the standard dissipative space\u2013time continuous problem formulation is formalized without reference to particular physics. Secondly, simple approaches for the spatial and temporal discretization of the space\u2013time continuous problem are described. Thirdly, a preliminary implementation based on the open source finite element library deal.II (Alzetta et al. [27], Bangerth et al. [28]) is briefly discussed. Finally, the usefulness of the approach is shown by the application to two multiphysics examples. The first example addresses the buckling behavior of a viscoelastic dielectric elastomer subjected to an electric voltage, while the second example concerns the swelling/shrinking of a hydrogel upon a change of exterior ion concentrations. Both examples include numerical convergence studies with regard to spatial and temporal discretization in order to show that the expected numerical properties indeed translate to practical computations."

            "text": "In this section, a generic formulation for standard dissipative continua is proposed, with the scope being limited to isothermal problems with elliptic or parabolic structure. It is emphasized in this context that more general standard dissipative formulations than the one presented below are possible. However, certain simplifications are unavoidable in view of implementation aspects. The proposed formulation essentially represents a trade-off between the generality of the formulation and complexity of the implementation into numerical software. Furthermore, it is remarked that most of the theoretical developments are, at least as far as the general ideas are concerned, in some form already available in the pertinent literature. Here, the intended contribution is to compile the theory in a form suitable for subsequent implementation. The contents of this section are summarized as follows: Firstly, the computational domain including subdomains, boundaries and interfaces is described together with the notation required for bookkeeping purposes. Secondly, the notions of \u201cgeneralized fields\u201d and \u201cdependent fields\u201d are introduced, and the form of the functionals considered in this work is specified. Despite the fact that these aspects are of subordinate importance from a physical standpoint, they are indispensable with regard to the desired problemindependent implementation of the approach into computer code. Thirdly, the unknowns\ninvolved in the statement of the problem are grouped into several categories based on their role in the variational formulation. Fourthly, the space\u2013time continuous incremental potential is introduced, followed by a statement of the space\u2013time continuous incremental variational principle assumed in the present work. Finally, ways to systematically reduce the number of unknowns involved in the problem formulation are described.\n2.1. Computational Domain\nThe Euclidean d-space Rd with d = 2 or d = 3 is considered for a range of time T = [t0, te), with t0 and te being the initial and the final times, respectively. In what follows, X \u2208 Rd denotes a spatial location and t \u2208 T an instant of time. As illustrated in Figure 1,Rd is assumed to be split into (i) the \u201cenvironment\u201d \u21260; (ii) the bounded domain \u2126, which is further subdivided into N\u2126 \u201cdomain portions\u201d \u2126\u03b1 labeled by \u03b1; and (iii) the bounded, sufficiently smooth d\u2212 1 dimensional interface \u03a3, which is further subdivided into N\u03a3 \u201cinterface portions\u201d \u03a3\u03b3 labeled by \u03b3. It is generally assumed that the boundary of each domain portion \u2126\u03b1 is a part of \u03a3. This means that \u2202\u2126\u03b1 \u2229 \u03a3 = \u2202\u2126\u03b1. Moreover, it is understood that \u2126 and \u03a3 have no points in common, i.e., \u03a3 \u2229\u2126 = \u2205. In the sequel, the union of \u03a3 and \u2126 will be referred to as the \u201ccomputational domain\u201d. This computational domain is generally assumed to be kept fixed. This means that it does not change with time. Together with the interface \u03a3, a piece-wise continuous unit normal field N(X) is introduced. Using this unit normal field, the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2212\u2019 sides of the interface at a location X \u2208 \u03a3 are defined such that N(X) points from the \u2212 to the + side.\nRemark 1.\n\u2022 An interface portion \u03a3\u03b3 need not necessarily be aligned with an interface between different domain portions \u2126\u03b1 or an interface between a domain portion \u2126\u03b1 and the environment \u21260. This means that a \u201cslit\u201d within a domain portion is permissible, as can be seen in the interface portion \u03a31 in Figure 1. \u2022 A more complete description would also involve lower-dimensional entities (lines, line portions, and points in three dimensions; points in two dimensions). However, these are firstly rarely relevant to practical examples, and secondly, these are more difficult to implement. Therefore, they are ignored below. \u2022 The introduction of different domain and interface portions concerns in particular multiphysics phenomena, with different physics being operative in different regions, and, possibly, combined with interfacial effects. \u2022 Keeping the domain of computation fixed does not imply that a Lagrangian or Eulerian viewpoint is adopted. In fact, even arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulations are possible.\n2.2. Generalized Fields, Dependent Fields and the Form of Functionals\nBefore discussing the standard dissipative formulation considered in this work,\n(i) the notions of \u201cgeneralized fields\u201d and \u201cdependent fields\u201d are introduced, and (ii) the form a functional can take within this work is narrowed down.\n2.2.1. Generalized Fields\nA generalized field G = G(X, t) comprises:\n1. A number of NG,\u2126 time-dependent scalar fields, which are formally defined on the entire computational domain, but which may only be non-zero on \u2126. These fields are collected in the vector G\u2126 = G\u2126(X, t) and will be referred to as \u201cdomain-related fields\u201d. The latter may represent, e.g., mechanical displacements, velocities, pressures, electric fields, etc. 2. A number of NG,\u03a3 time-dependent scalar fields, which are formally defined on the entire computational domain, but which may only be non-zero on \u03a3. These fields are collected in the vector G\u03a3 = G\u03a3(X, t) and will be referred to as \u201cinterface-related fields\u201d. The latter may represent, e.g., curvatures, electrical surface charges, interfacial reaction rates, etc. 3. A number of NG,C time-dependent scalars. These scalars are collected in the vector GC = GC(t); and they may represent quantities such as integral electric currents, displacements and rotations of rigid domain portions, etc.\nWith these definitions,\nG = G\u2126G\u03a3 GC  (1) is as a vector of dimension NG = NG,\u2126 + NG,\u03a3 + NG,C.\nThe derivative of G with respect to X, i.e., the gradient, is introduced according to\n\u2207G = \u2207G\u2126\u2207\u03a3G\u03a3 0 , (2) with \u2207\u03a3 indicating the surface gradient, and \u2207G\u2126 = 0 if X \u2208 \u03a3 and \u2207\u03a3G\u03a3 = 0 if X \u2208 \u2126. It is noted that \u2207G may be interpreted as an NG \u00d7 d matrix.\nThe derivative of G with respect to t, i.e., the rate, is denoted by\nG\u0307 = G\u0307\u2126G\u0307\u03a3 G\u0307C . (3) Two generalized fields A and B may be concatenated to form a single generalized\nfield C. In this case, it is understood that the components are rearranged such that the domain-related fields, the interface-related fields and the scalars are contiguous again. This means that:\nC = (\nA B\n) =  A\u2126 B\u2126 A\u03a3 B\u03a3\nAC BC\n = C\u2126C\u03a3 CC . (4)\nThis procedure can be applied recursively to concatenate more than two generalized fields.\nRemark 2. Vector/tensor fields are considered to be represented by an appropriate number of scalar fields, with the individual scalar fields typically representing vector/tensor coordinates with regard to a particular basis system.\n2.2.2. Dependent Fields\nFor each generalized field G, a number of Ng,\u2126 \u201cdomain-related dependent fields\u201d and a number of Ng,\u03a3 \u201cinterface-related dependent fields\u201d are introduced. These dependent fields are collected in the vectors g\u2126 and g\u03a3, respectively. In this section, the convention will be followed that upper case letters denote generalized fields, while the corresponding lower case letters denote the associated dependent fields. The purpose of the dependent fields is the introduction of variables, in terms of which the functionals governing the standard dissipative formulation can be conveniently expressed without direct use of spatial derivatives. A typical example for a dependent field is the mechanical strain field, which is used to introduce the strain energy density in continuum mechanics. The dependent fields g\u2126 and g\u03a3 are assumed to be linearly related to the generalized field G. In particular,\n(g\u2126)\u03bb = NG,\u2126\n\u2211 e=1\n[ aG,\u2126\u03bbe (G \u2126)e + bG,\u2126\u03bbe \u00b7 (\u2207G \u2126)e ] + NG,C\n\u2211 \u03b9=1\ncG,\u2126\u03bb\u03b9 (G C)\u03b9 + dG,\u2126\u03bb (5)\nif X \u2208 \u2126 and (g\u2126)\u03bb = 0 otherwise, with aG,\u2126\u03bbe , c G,\u2126 \u03bb\u03b9 and d G,\u2126 \u03bb being constants, b G,\u2126 \u03bbe constant vectors of dimension d, and (Y)\u03bb denoting the component \u03bb of a vector Y. Similarly,\n(g\u03a3)\u03bd = NG,\u03a3\n\u2211 \u03b7=1\n[ aG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b7 (G \u03a3)\u03b7 + bG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b7 \u00b7 (\u2207\u03a3G\u03a3)\u03b7 ]\n+ NG,\u2126\n\u2211 e=1\n[ aG+\u03bde (G \u2126|+)e + bG+\u03bde \u00b7 (\u2207G\u2126|+)e ]\n+ NG,\u2126\n\u2211 e=1\n[ aG\u2212\u03bde (G \u2126|\u2212)e + bG\u2212\u03bde \u00b7 (\u2207G\u2126|\u2212)e ]\n+ NG,C\n\u2211 \u03b9=1\ncG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b9 (G C)\u03b9 + dG,\u03a3\u03bd\n(6)\nif X \u2208 \u03a3 and (g\u03a3)\u03bd = 0 otherwise, with aG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b7 , aG+\u03bde , aG\u2212\u03bde , cG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b9 and dG,\u03a3\u03bd being constants, and bG,\u03a3\u03bd\u03b7 , bG+\u03bde , bG\u2212\u03bde constant vectors of dimension d. In the latter equation as well as in the following, the notation |+/\u2212 indicates that reference is made to the limit value as points X \u2208 \u03a3 are approached from the + and the \u2212 side of the interface \u03a3, respectively.\nRemark 3.\n\u2022 The restriction of g\u2126 and g\u03a3 to a dependence on first spatial derivatives of the generalized field G may seem rather limiting. However, the formulation to be described does enable the effective incorporation of higher-order derivatives through the introduction of auxiliary quantities. In fact, including higher spatial derivatives would, in a finite element context, require higherorder continuous finite elements; and the latter are rarely used in practice due to the superiority of mixed formulations eliminating the higher spatial derivatives through auxiliary quantities. \u2022 The choice of the dependent fields is usually subject to a substantial degree of freedom and will typically be determined by what is most convenient for the definition of the governing functionals. \u2022 The constants and constant vectors appearing in (5) and (6) may be made dependent upon X without affecting the discussion below. Furthermore, nonlinear dependencies of the dependent fields on the generalized fields and derivatives thereof may be allowed for . However, such dependencies are omitted here as they have not yet been implemented (nonetheless, they can be incorporated through constraints, which can be implemented using Lagrangian multipliers).\n2.2.3. Form of Functionals\nLet H[A\u03b1; B\u03b2, t] be a functional of a number of generalized fields A\u03b1 indexed by \u03b1 and a number of generalized fields B\u03b2 indexed by \u03b2, with the semicolon indicating that the quantities to the right are regarded as parameters when the variations of the functional H are computed. In the sequel it is assumed that every such functional is of the specific form\nH[A\u03b1; B\u03b2, t] = \u222b\n\u2126 h\u2126(a\u03b1,\u2126; b\u03b2,\u2126, X, t)dV + \u222b \u03a3 h\u03a3(a\u03b1,\u03a3; b\u03b2,\u03a3, X, t)dS\n+ hC(A\u03b1,C; B\u03b2,C, t), (7)\nwhere dV is the volume element, dS the interface element, and h\u2126, h\u03a3 and hC are functions.\nRemark 4. The previous assumption regarding the form of a functional will eventually ensure that the incremental variational principle to be stated below implies a set of partial differential (algebraic) equations and equations without spatial dependency (which may, however, involve integrals).\n2.3. Unknown Variables\nConceptually, three different types of unknowns are considered, leading to the definition of the three following generalized fields:\n1. A generalized \u201cstate variable\u201d Q, which is used to describe the state within the computational domain. Q may, besides classical \u201cthermodynamic state variables\u201d, also comprise a number of \u201cauxiliary state variables\u201d, which will be used in the usual way as Lagrangian multipliers enforcing constraints on the admissible thermodynamic states (incompressibility constraints, electroneutrality constraints, etc.). In particular, Q is assumed to be of the format\nQ = (\nU P\n) , (8)\nwhere U comprises the thermodynamic state variables, while P comprises the auxiliary state variables/Lagrangian multipliers. Q is subject to an initial condition of the form\nQ(X, t0) = Q0(X), (9)\nwhere Q0 may need to satisfy certain consistency requirements as will be remarked later. 2. A generalized \u201cprocess variable\u201d V, which may be interpreted as an auxiliary quantity\nused to constrain the ways the thermodynamic state can change in that only certain combinations of the rates Q\u0307 and V\u0307 are admissible. V is, without loss of generality, subjected to the initial condition\nV(X, t0) = V0(X) = 0. (10)\n3. A generalized Lagrangian multiplier M, which will be used to actually incorporate constraints for Q\u0307 and V\u0307.\nRemark 5.\n\u2022 The explicit distinction between state variables and process variables appears to be a feature distinguishing the present standard dissipative formulation from what is available in the literature to date, although it is acknowledged that, e.g., the works of Biot [13] and Miehe et al. [23,24,25] implicitly contain such a distinction. Physically, the introduction of process variables may, e.g., be motivated by the following two simple examples: (i) diffusion processes, in which molar concentrations are changed by species fluxes; and (ii) chemical reactions, in which the amounts of the substances involved are changed by chemical reaction processes.\n\u2022 Ultimately, only the rate of the process variable, V\u0307, will enter the formulation. Hence, it would seem more natural to directly introduce the rate as an unknown. However, the viewpoint adopted here proves beneficial from the implementation point of view.\n2.4. Space\u2013Time Continuous Incremental Potential\nThe space\u2013time continuous problem formulation in terms of an incremental variational principle (herein, the term \u201cincremental\u201d refers to a formulation in terms of rate-type quantities, and does not refer to a time-discrete formulation as it is often the case in the literature) is based on\n1. A Helmholtz free energy functional \u03a8[Q]. Specifically, the Helmholtz free energy functional is assumed to be of the form\n\u03a8[Q] = \u03a8U[U] + \u03a8P[P, U], (11)\nwith \u03a8P being linear in its first argument. In general, \u03a8 will be assumed to be Fr\u00e9chet differentiable. It is remarked in this context that the constraints for the thermodynamic states U are obtained by requiring the first variation of \u03a8P with respect to P to be zero; and \u03a8U represents the physical Helmholtz free energy for all thermodynamic states consistent with these constraints.\n2. A power functional P[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] accounting for the influence of the environment on the computational domain under consideration. P is assumed to be linear in the pair (U\u0307, V\u0307). 3. A dissipation functional \u2206\u030a[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t], which is related to the description of dissipative effects. It is assumed that \u2206\u030a is (i) non-negative; (ii) convex in the pair (U\u0307, V\u0307); and (iii) satisfies the condition \u2206\u030a[0, 0; U, t] = 0. The latter conditions are, within the standard dissipative framework, sufficient for the satisfaction of the second law of thermodynamics as will be remarked later. 4. A Lagrangian multiplier functional L[M, U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] incorporating constraints for U\u0307 and V\u0307. L is assumed to be of the form\nL = L1[M, U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] + L2[M; U, t], (12)\nwhere L1 is bilinear with regard to M and the pair (U\u0307, V\u0307) and L2 is linear in M.\nFinally, the space\u2013time continuous incremental potential\n\u03a0[Q\u0307, V\u0307, M; Q, t] = \u03a8\u0307[Q, Q\u0307] + \u0393[U\u0307, V\u0307, M; U, t] (13)\nis introduced, where\n\u0393[U\u0307, V\u0307, M; U, t] = \u2212P[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] + \u2206\u030a[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] + L[M, U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t]. (14)\n2.5. Space\u2013Time Continuous Incremental Variational Principle\nUsing the previously introduced functionals, the space\u2013time continuous incremental variational principle now requires that Q\u0307, V\u0307, M furnishes a stationary point of \u03a0 at every instant of time. This means that the problem can be formulated as\nFind the unknowns (Q, V, M) such that Q(X, t0) = Q0, and V(X, t0) = 0, and\n0 = \u03b4\u03a0[Q\u0307, V\u0307, M, \u03b4Q\u0307, \u03b4V\u0307, \u03b4M; Q, t]\n= \u03b4\u03a8[Q, \u03b4Q\u0307] + \u03b4\u0393[U\u0307, V\u0307, M, \u03b4U\u0307, \u03b4V\u0307, \u03b4M; U, t] (15)\nfor all [\u03b4Q\u0307, \u03b4V\u0307, \u03b4M] and all t \u2208 (T \\ t0),\nwhere the notation is used here and henceforth that the first variation of a functional I[x1, . . . , xn; y1, . . . , yn] is \u03b4I[x1, . . . , xn, \u03b4x1, . . . , \u03b4xn; y1, . . . , yn].\nRemark 6.\n\u2022 Equation (15) may be seen as an extension of Biot\u2019s equation, cf. Equation (2.14) in Biot [29] and Equation (2.14) in Biot [30]. \u2022 For the general case, partial differential algebraic equations are involved and, therefore, (15) cannot generally be used as a \u201cpoint-wise\u201d equation to determine the rates Q\u0307, V\u0307 based on the current thermodynamic state Q. Rather, neighboring instants of time need to be taken into consideration by differentiating the equations implied by (15) with respect to time. This aspect becomes particularly evident when considering the example of elasticity (which does not involve dissipative processes). In this case, (15) implies the mechanical equilibrium condition, which only involves the mechanical displacement and not the rate of the mechanical displacement. Therefore, differentiation with respect to time is necessary in order to obtain an equation in the rates. \u2022 In order for the problem to be well posed, further conditions need to be satisfied. Although a general discussion of this aspect without reference to a particular problem appears to be difficult, a few further remarks are made in the following:\n\u2013 The constraints represented by the functionals \u03a8P and L must be consistent in that they are neither redundant nor contradictory. \u2013 Non-convex \u03a8U and/or domains of admissible thermodynamic states may be a severe issue with regard to unique solvability and stability, as can be seen in the discussion in Abed-Meraim and Nguyen [31]. \u2013 The initial conditions need to be consistent in that Q0 must be such that a stationary point of \u03a0 exists at t = t0.\n\u2022 The problem formulation in terms of the first variation of \u03a0 implies the assumption of sufficient regularity of the functionals involved. This becomes a crucial aspect in the case of problems including rate-independent processes. In this case, the dissipation functional \u2206\u030a contains contributions which are positively homogeneous of degree one in the rates. The associated non-differentiability of \u2206\u030a invalidates (15), and hence it may appear that the formulation cannot be used for these cases. However, the situation can be remedied by employing the techniques of convex analysis and, in particular, replacing regular differentiation by the use of subdifferentials (as can be seen, e.g., in Rockafellar [32], pp. 213 ff.), thus extending the formulation to rate-independent processes. \u2022 The above formulation in terms of an incremental variational principle is motivated by the description of reversible isothermal processes, in which case the concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics apply and the free energy of the system under consideration is minimized at all times. In order to account for the actual dissipative nature of the problem under consideration, \u201cgeneralized dissipative forces\u201d are included into the formulation, which are mathematically characterized by the Fr\u00e9chet derivative of \u2206\u030a with respect to U\u0307 and V\u0307. These generalized dissipative forces may be interpreted as those external loads, which would have to be applied by an external agency at a certain instant of time t to bring the system instantaneously into equilibrium. This approach is abstract in that these external loads are fictitious and cannot be applied in reality. However, accepting the approach based on the experience that it has been succesfully applied to a wide range of problems in the past, the situation is formally transformed from a problem of non-equilibrium thermodynamics into one of equilibrium thermodynamics, so that the well-known concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics can be used, and a mathematically sound formulation results, as can also be seen in Germain et al. [12]. Moreover, by ensuring that \u03b4\u2206\u030a(U\u0307, V\u0307, U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t) \u2265 0 for any choice of (U\u0307, V\u0307), it is guaranteed that the generalized dissipative forces are always associated with a negative power (i.e., a positive dissipation), such that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied a priori and need not be discussed further. The assumptions made above (\u2206\u030a is non-negative, convex with respect to the pair (U\u0307, V\u0307) and satisfies the condition \u2206\u030a[0, 0; U, t] = 0) indeed imply that \u03b4\u2206\u030a(U\u0307, V\u0307, U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t) \u2265 0 .\n2.6. Reduced Space\u2013Time Continuous Incremental Variational Principles\nIn the following, two straightforward possibilities to reduce the set of unknown variables are described. It is emphasized that further possibilities exist, which are not\ndiscussed here. Furthermore, it is noted that the space\u2013time discretization methods as well as the implementation discussed in the next sections are equally applicable to both, the original and the reduced formulations.\n2.6.1. Reduction of the Set of Process Variables and Lagrangian Multipliers\nThe introduction of the generalized process variable V and the generalized Lagrangian multiplier M often leads to an excessive number of unknown fields. However, in many cases, it is possible to systematically eliminate V and M, or rather subsets thereof, before actually numerically solving the problem. In particular, the space\u2013time continuous incremental functional \u03a0 only depends on V\u0307, but not on V itself. Furthermore, \u03a0 depends on V\u0307 and M only through the contribution \u0393. Thus, a reduced functional\n\u0393red[U\u0307, V\u03070, M0; U, t] = inf V\u03071 sup M1 \u0393[U\u0307, V\u0307, M; U, t] (16)\nmay be introduced by joint partial minimization and maximization, where\nV = ( V0\nV1\n) M = ( M0\nM1\n) . (17)\nThen, \u03b4\u0393 can be replaced by \u03b4\u0393red in (15) to obtain an equivalent formulation in the reduced set of variables (Q, V0, M0).\nRemark 7. The selection of the variables V0 and M0 typically depends on the properties of the dissipation functional \u2206\u030a. However, numerical considerations (e.g., with respect to the choice of finite elements) may also be important in this regard.\n2.6.2. Reduction of the Set of State Variables\nAnother possibility to reduce the set of variables exists if certain state variables factor into \u03a8, while \u0393 is independent of these variables. In order to discuss this case, it is assumed that\nQ = U1U0 P0  = (U1 Q0 ) , (18)\nand that \u0393 neither depends on U1 nor on U\u03071, meaning that there exists a functional \u0393red such that \u0393[U\u0307, V\u0307, M; U, t] = \u0393red[U\u03070, V\u0307, M; U0, t]. (19)\nThen, if \u03a8 is additionally convex in U1, a reduced thermodynamic potential\n\u03a8red[Q0] = inf U1 \u03a8[Q] (20)\nmay be introduced; and \u03b4\u03a8 and \u03b4\u0393 can be replaced by \u03b4\u03a8red and \u03b4\u0393red in (15) to obtain an equivalent formulation in the reduced set of variables (Q0, V, M).\nRemark 8. Using this approach, the linearity of \u03a8 with regard to P may be lost, which does, however, not have consequences for the applicability of (15)."

            "text": "The spatial discretization of the fields involved in Q, V and M is assumed to be performed using the finite element method in this work. In this regard, standard methods can be used, which will not be further discussed here. However, it is pointed out that the satisfaction of the inf\u2212 sup condition is typically the most difficult part of spatial discretization if the variational problem to be solved is of saddle point type, see, e.g., Bathe [33] and Auricchio et al. [34].\nWith regard to temporal discretization, a number of simple and straightforward-toimplement one step schemes have been discussed and analyzed in a somewhat narrower context in a previous work [35]. These methods can be readily extended to the current formulation; and for the self-containedness of the present work, these will be briefly described below, although the reader is referred to [35] for details. In the following, it is assumed throughout that the time interval [t0, te] is divided by the discrete time points tn = t0 + n\u2206t, where n = 0, 1, . . . N and \u2206t = (te \u2212 t0)/N (however, the formulations are not restricted to uniform time increments). The numerically approximated values of Q, V and M at time tn are denoted by Qn, Vn and Mn, respectively; and the initial values at time t0 are given by Q0(X) and V0(X) = 0.\n3.1. Variationally Consistent Method\nThe \u201cvariationally consistent method\u201d is based on a straightforward discretization of the space\u2013time continuous incremental functional \u03a0. In particular, a time-discrete counterpart \u2206\u03a0n\u2192n+1 of \u03a0 is introduced according to\n\u2206\u03a0n\u2192n+1[Qn+1, Vn+1, Mn+1] = \u03a8[Qn+1]\u2212\u03a8[Qn] + \u2206t\u0393 [\nUn+1 \u2212Un \u2206t , Vn+1 \u2212Vn \u2206t , Mn+1; Un, tn+1\n] . (21)\nThen, the stationary point of \u2206\u03a0n\u2192n+1 is searched during each time step to obtain Qn+1, Vn+1 and Mn+1 based on the solution of the previous time step. The corresponding stationarity condition leads to the time-discrete variational formulation\nFind the unknowns (Qn+1, Vn+1, Mn+1) such that\n0 = \u03b4\u03a8[Qn+1, \u03b4Qn+1] + \u03b4\u0393 [\nUn+1 \u2212Un \u2206t , Vn+1 \u2212Vn \u2206t , Mn+1,\n\u03b4Un+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u2206t\u03b4Mn+1; Un, tn+1 ] (22) for all (\u03b4Qn+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u03b4Mn+1) and all n \u2208 {0, 1, . . . N \u2212 1},\nwhich is a consistent approximation of (15). According to the analysis in [35], the method represents a first-order accurate time integrator, provided that the the problem is sufficiently regular.\nRemark 9. As a result of discretizing \u03a0, the variational structure of the space\u2013time continuous problem is preserved, which makes the method particularly attractive from the mathematical point of view. This concerns, e.g., the fact that the resulting finite element systems are symmetric.\n3.2. The \u03b1-Family\nThe \u201c\u03b1-family\u201d is based on the introduction of a real parameter \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], where \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to a forward Euler type scheme, \u03b1 = 1/2 to a Crank\u2013Nicolson type scheme, and \u03b1 = 1 to a backward Euler type scheme. Moreover, the following quantities are defined:\nQ\u03b1n = (1\u2212 \u03b1)Qn + \u03b1Qn+1 (23) M\u03b1n = (1\u2212 \u03b1)Mn + \u03b1Mn+1 (24)\nt\u03b1n = (1\u2212 \u03b1)tn + \u03b1tn+1. (25)\nThen, the time-discrete version of (15) reads\nFind the unknowns (Qn+1, Vn+1, M\u03b1n) such that\n0 = (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b4\u03a8[Qn, \u03b4Qn+1] + \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8[Qn+1, \u03b4Qn+1] + \u03b4\u0393 [\nUn+1 \u2212Un \u2206t , Vn+1 \u2212Vn \u2206t , M\u03b1n, \u03b4Un+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u2206t\u03b4M \u03b1 n; U \u03b1 n, t \u03b1 n ] (26) for all (\u03b4Qn+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u03b4M\u03b1n) and all n \u2208 {0, 1, . . . N \u2212 1}.\nFor a sufficiently regular problem, the method is second-order accurate for \u03b1 = 1/2 or otherwise first-order accurate [35]. However, the method is non-convergent for \u03b1 < 1/2 if the system of equations implied by (15) is of differential algebraic nature. Furthermore, no associated time-discrete incremental potential exists for the method if \u0393 exhibits a parametric dependence on U, so that the finite element systems are unsymmetric in this case.\n3.3. The Modified \u03b1-Family\nThe \u201cmodified \u03b1-family\u201d is a \u201cpredictor-corrector\u201d method. In particular, the quantities Q\u0302n+1, V\u0302n+1, M\u0302\u03b1n are introduced, which are \u201cpredictions\u201d of Qn+1, Vn+1 and M\u03b1n. During the predictor step, the problem\nFind the unknowns (Q\u0302n+1, V\u0302n+1, M\u0302\u03b1n) such that\n0 = (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b4\u03a8[Qn, \u03b4Q\u0302n+1] + \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8[Q\u0302n+1, \u03b4Q\u0302n+1] + \u03b4\u0393 [\nU\u0302n+1 \u2212Un \u2206t , V\u0302n+1 \u2212Vn \u2206t , M\u0302\u03b1n, \u03b4U\u0302n+1, \u03b4V\u0302n+1, \u2206t\u03b4M\u0302 \u03b1 n; Un, t \u03b1 n ] (27) for all (\u03b4Q\u0302n+1, \u03b4V\u0302n+1, \u03b4M\u0302\u03b1n)\nis solved. Based on the resulting predicted values, the time-discrete problem is then\nFind the unknowns (Qn+1, Vn+1, M\u03b1n) such that\n0 = (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03b4\u03a8[Qn, \u03b4Qn+1] + \u03b1\u03b4\u03a8[Qn+1, \u03b4Qn+1] + \u03b4\u0393 [\nUn+1 \u2212Un \u2206t , Vn+1 \u2212Vn \u2206t , M\u03b1n, \u03b4Un+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u2206t\u03b4M \u03b1 n; U\u0302 \u03b1 n, t \u03b1 n ] (28) for all (\u03b4Qn+1, \u03b4Vn+1, \u03b4M\u03b1n) and all n \u2208 {0, 1, . . . N \u2212 1}, where U\u0302\u03b1n = (1\u2212 \u03b1)Un + \u03b1U\u0302n+1.\nFor many (but not all) cases, the method provides the same accuracy as the \u03b1-family, while retaining the symmetric and variational structure, so that corresponding time-discrete incremental potentials exist for both steps."

            "text": "In order to show the feasibility of the approach, the space\u2013time discrete formulation described above has been preliminarily implemented in two and three dimensions for both sequential and distributed memory parallel computations. In particular, the open source C++ libraries GalerkinTools and IncrementalFE have been developed. The library GalerkinTools allows for the definition of weak forms corresponding to functionals of the generic form (7) (in fact, the library covers slightly more general weak forms including those unsymmetric weak forms required for the \u03b1-family of methods for temporal discretization). Furthermore, GalerkinTools provides methods for the automatic assembly of the corresponding finite element systems based on the functionalities of the open source finite element library deal.II (Alzetta et al. [27], Bangerth et al. [28]). In addition, interfaces for\nthe solution of the resulting linear systems of equations are included. For this purpose, the unsymmetric sparse direct UMFPACK solver (Davis [36]), the symmetric and unsymmetric sparse direct PARDISO solvers (Schenk and G\u00e4rtner [37,38], Karypis and Kumar [39]), the symmetric and unsymmetric sparse direct MUMPS solvers (Amestoy et al. [40,41]) and the symmetric sparse direct MA57 solver (HSL, a collection of Fortran codes for largescale scientific computation, see http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ (accessed on 5 January 2023)) can currently be used. Based on the library GalerkinTools, the library IncrementalFE then encapsulates the special functionality required for the solution of problems formulated within the standard dissipative framework. In particular, this involves functionalities for the definition of the functionals \u03a8 and \u0393, together with the temporal discretization schemes described in the previous section. Furthermore, IncrementalFE implements a simple Newton\u2013Raphson scheme, optionally combined with a line search, to solve the nonlinear finite element problems arising in each time step. For details regarding the functionalities and implementation of the libraries GalerkinTools and IncrementalFE, the reader is referred to the documentation bundled with these libraries. However, the general sequence of steps needed to define and solve a particular problem is briefly described in the following:\n1. Setup of the finite element mesh, which corresponds to the definition of the computational domain. During this step, the domain \u2126 is first meshed using either the built-in functionalities of deal.II or by importing a mesh from an external mesh generator. Subsequently, the domain is partitioned into domain portions by assigning \u201cmaterial IDs\u201d to the individual cells of the mesh. This is followed by the definition of the interface \u03a3 based on faces of the previously defined volume-related cells, which also goes along with the definition of the \u2212 and + sides of the interface as well as a partitioning of the interface by assigning \u201cmaterial IDs\u201d. As a final step of mesh generation, local mesh refinement may be performed. 2. Definition of the unknowns Q, V and M of the problem and the corresponding finite element spaces. During this step, the domain-related unknown fields, the interfacerelated unknown fields and the scalars are defined. This includes the definition of the finite elements to be used for the discretization of the domain-related and interfacerelated unknowns as well as Dirichlet-type constraints. Furthermore, for each unknown field, the domain portions and interface portions, respectively, are defined where the respective field may be non-zero. In order to allow for the use of vectorvalued finite elements, several unknown fields of a particular type may be defined at once. 3. Definition of the domain-related dependent fields q\u2126, v\u2126, m\u2126 and the interfacerelated dependent fields q\u03a3, v\u03a3, m\u03a3 based on the previously defined unknowns Q, V and M according to Equations (5) and (6), respectively. 4. Definition of \u03a8 and \u0393 as functionals of the form (7). It is noted in this context that the definition of the integrals over \u2126 and \u03a3, respectively, may be split into several integrals, which are summed up subsequently. This split (i) facilitates the re-usability of the implementation of certain terms (e.g., a Neo-Hookean strain energy density) and thus makes the definition of \u03a8 and \u0393 \u201cmodular\u201d; (ii) allows for using different numerical quadrature schemes for different terms; and (iii) allows for a better structuring of the problem, which can be internally exploited by the library GalerkinTools to determine which entries in the finite element system matrix are non-zero. The actual definition of a single integral typically involves (i) the implementation of the integrand (which is expressed in terms of the dependent fields relevant to the integral) and its first and second derivatives; (ii) the specification of domain and interface portions, respectively, where the integrand is non-zero; (iii) the definition of the quadrature scheme to be used for evaluating the integral; (iv) the definition of the temporal integration scheme to be used (in fact, one may use different schemes for different terms, although this has not been discussed above); and (v) the definition of parameters (particularly constitutive parameters).\n5. Solving the problem. Currently, time-stepping needs to be implemented manually, although single time steps are automatically handled by the library IncrementalFE.\nRemark 10.\n\u2022 The entire problem definition is facilitated by the use of C++ as an object-oriented language. As a result, e.g., each unknown field is a separate object, which leads to a rather natural structuring of the code in that it closely resembles the underlying mathematical statement of the problem under study in terms of formulae. \u2022 Typically, the most time-consuming step of the problem definition is, besides in some cases the mesh generation, the implementation of the integrands for the definition of \u03a8 and \u0393. However, due to the mentioned modular design, the implementation of certain integrands can be re-used. This does, in principle, allow for a library of integrands covering a multitude of situations. Furthermore, automatic differentiation schemes may be used in order to simplify the implementation of the first and second derivatives of the integrands, which are required for the solution of the problem. \u2022 The library GalerkinTools also allows for the definition of \u201chidden variables\u201d for each integrand, so that, in principle, classical rate-independent plasticity approaches are covered. For example, for the variationally consistent method, the latter may easily be achieved by locally \u201cpreminimizing\u201d the time-discrete incremental potential \u2206\u03a0n\u2192n+1 with respect to the plastic deformation variables. However, proper testing of classical plasticity approaches is yet to be performed. Therefore, a discussion of these is not included in the present contribution. \u2022 Implementation-wise, the main difficulties are the definition of functionals of the generic form (7) and the assembly procedures for the associated finite-element systems. These functionalities are provided by GalerkinTools; and, on this basis, the implementation of particular temporal discretization schemes and iterative algorithms for the solution of the nonlinear problems arising in each time step is straightforward. Hence, the library IncrementalFE is rather slim; and if temporal discretization schemes and/or iterative algorithms other than those discussed in this work need to be considered, these can be implemented with little effort (provided that the temporally discretized versions are compatible with the assumed form for functionals). The same applies to the use of other linear solvers than those mentioned above, and, in particular, iterative linear solvers."

It is emphasized that the main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the approach, and not to give a detailed exposition of particular physical effects. Therefore, the statement of the problems will be kept concise; and a discussion of the differential (algebraic) equations implied by the formulations is omitted. It is emphasized that the discussion of the example problems mostly follows the sequence of steps described in Section 4, which highlights the systematic approach to standard dissipative problems proposed in this work. The equations are written using the symbolic vector/tensor notation; and it is tacitly assumed that each vector/tensor field is represented by an appropriate number of domain-related/interface-related scalar fields, which embody vector/tensor coordinates with regard to the standard basis ofR3. Moreover, it is noted that both example problems have been chosen to be axisymmetric in order to reduce the computational cost and, therefore, facilitate numerical convergence studies. Despite this fact, the problems will be described in the fully three-dimensional setting for the sake of simplicity. The steps necessary for reduction to the axisymmetric setting should be sufficiently obvious and are, therefore, not described in detail.\n5.1. Example 1: Buckling of a Viscoelastic Dielectric Elastomer\nThe first example problem is illustrated in Figure 2. A circular disc of incompressible viscoelastic dielectric elastomer with radius L and thickness H is considered. The constitutive behavior is assumed to be described by the relations proposed by Hong [42]. The radial displacement is constrained to zero on the entire lateral surface of the disc. Furthermore, the average axial displacement is constrained to zero on the lateral surface. The latter constraint was chosen instead of a homogeneous constraint on the entire surface in order to avoid stress/strain singularities, which would complicate the convergence studies due to the need for excessive local mesh refinement. The bottom surface and the top surface are assumed to be electrodes, with a transient voltage U(t) applied across these electrodes. As a result of Maxwell stress, the disc shrinks in the axial direction; and due to the incompressibility of the material, this leads to buckling and large deformations of the disc in the axial direction. In order to induce the \u201cimperfection\u201d needed for a well-defined buckling behavior, the gravitational acceleration g is taken into account and assumed to point downwards in the figure. Fringing fields at the edges of the electrodes are neglected for simplicity.\n5.1.1. Computational Domain\nThe computational domain \u2126 shown in Figure 2 represents the reference configuration of the disc, which is assumed to be stress-free. It is noted that this reference configuration is not actually assumed at any instant of time due to the action of the gravitational acceleration. The in-plane Cartesian coordinates in Figure 2 are X1 and X2, while the out-of-plane coordinate is X3. If a radial coordinate R and an axial coordinate Z of a cylindrical coordinate system are introduced as shown in the figure, the body occupies the region described by 0 \u2264 R \u2264 L and \u2212H/2 \u2264 Z \u2264 H/2. The lateral surface of this disc is \u03a31, the bottom surface \u03a32 and the top surface \u03a33.\n5.1.2.

The thermodynamic state variables have the following significance:\n\u2022 u is the mechanical displacement field. It describes how the placements of material points in the reference configuration are mapped onto their placements in the current configuration. In particular, x(X, t) = X + u(X, t), with x(X, t) being the placement of the material point X at time t. \u2022 D is the referential electric displacement field. \u2022 Ui is the (symmetric) inelastic stretch tensor.\nThe thermodynamic state variables are supplemented by the auxiliary state variables\n\u03d5 : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03d5(X, t)\n(35)\np : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 p(X, t)\n(36)\npi : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 pi(X, t)\n(37)\nluZ : { T \u2192 R t 7\u2192 luZ (t)\n(38)\ntogether with the corresponding initial conditions\n\u03d5(X, t0) = \u03d50(X) (39)\np(X, t0) = p0(X) (40)\npi(X, t0) = pi0(X) (41)\nluZ (t0) = l uZ 0 . (42)\nThe auxiliary state variables have the following significance:\n\u2022 \u03d5 is the electric scalar potential, which acts as a Lagrangian multiplier enforcing the condition that there is no free space charge density in the interior of the domain. \u2022 p is a pressure type variable, which acts as a Lagrangian multiplier enforcing the condition that the elastomer does not exhibit any overall local volume change. \u2022 pi is a further pressure type variable, which acts as a Lagrangian multiplier enforcing the condition that the elastomer does not exhibit any inelastic local volume change. \u2022 luZ is used to constrain the average axial displacement of the disc on the lateral surface \u03a31 to zero.\nThe practical determination of the initial values u0(X), D0(X), \u03d50(X), p0(X), pi0(X) and luZ0 will be discussed later.\nProcess Variables and Lagrangian Multipliers\nFor this first example, neither process variables nor Lagrangian multipliers are needed.\nDirichlet Constraints\nThe state variables u and D are constrained by the Dirichlet conditions\nu \u00b7N = 0 on \u03a31 (43) D \u00b7N = 0 on \u03a31. (44)\n5.1.3. Dependent Fields\nHere and in the following, only those dependent fields are listed explicitly, which are \u201cnontrivial\u201d in that they are not equal to an unknown field itself or the gradient/divergence/curl\nof an unknown field (the divergence actually involves three unknown scalar fields in three dimensions since a vector field is formally represented by an appropriate number of scalar fields; and the curl involves three unknown scalar fields and three dependent fields). In particular, the only non-trivial domain-related dependent fields used below represent the mechanical deformation gradient\nF = \u2207u + I, (45)\nwhere the latter equation must be expanded into coordinate-wise relations in order to be consistent with the generic form of domain-related dependent fields according to Equation (5).\n5.1.4. The Functionals\nAs noted above, the functionals describing the variational problem are chosen such that the constitutive behavior of the viscoelastic dielectric elastomer is described by the constitutive model of Hong [42].\nHelmholtz Free-Energy Functional \u03a8\nThe Helmholtz free energy functional \u03a8[Q] = \u03a8U[U] + \u03a8P[P, U] is composed of the contributions\n\u03a8U[U] = \u222b \u2126 { 1 2e D \u00b7 F> \u00b7 F \u00b7D + \u00b5 e 2 [ tr ( F> \u00b7 F ) \u2212 2 ln(J)\u2212 3 ] + \u00b5i\n2\n[ tr ( Ui \u22121 \u00b7 F> \u00b7 F \u00b7Ui\u22121 ) \u2212 2 ( J \u2212 Ji ) \u2212 3 ] + \u03c10g(u)Z } dV (46)\nand \u03a8P[P, U] = \u222b \u2126 [ \u2212\u03d5\u2207 \u00b7D + p(1\u2212 J) + pi ( 1\u2212 Ji )] dV \u2212 \u222b \u03a31 luZ (u)Z dS. (47)\nIn these equations, J = det F, Ji = det Ui, (u)Z is the axial displacement, g is the gravitational acceleration, \u03c10 is the mass density of the elastomer in the reference state, e is the permittivity of the material and \u00b5e and \u00b5i are elastic constants.\nPower Functional P\nThe power functional takes the form\nP[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] = \u2212 \u222b \u03a33 U(t)D\u0307 \u00b7N dS. (48)\nIn the following, the ramp loading\nU(t) = Ue t\u2212 t0 te \u2212 t0\n(49)\nwith the maximum voltage Ue will be considered.\nDissipation Functional \u2206\u030a\nFor the dissipation functional, the form\n\u2206\u030a[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] = \u222b \u2126 \u03b7tr(d \u00b7 d)dV (50)\nis assumed, where \u03b7 is the viscosity and d = sym ( F \u00b7Ui\u22121 \u00b7 U\u0307i \u00b7 F\u22121 ) is the inelastic stretching.\n5.1.5. Reduced Formulations Variant 1: Vector Potential Formulation\nA first possibility to reduce the set of variables is to express D in terms of a vector potential A according to\nD = \u2212\u2207\u00d7A. (51)\nBy doing so, D becomes a dependent field, while\nA :\n{ \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R3\n(X, t) 7\u2192 A(X, t) (52)\nbecomes a state variable. As a consequence of the identity\u2207 \u00b7 (\u2207\u00d7A) = 0, the Lagrangian multiplier term\u2212\u03d5\u2207 \u00b7D drops out in (47), such that \u03d5 is no longer required as an unknown variable. Furthermore, the Dirichlet constraint D \u00b7N = 0 on \u03a31 is transformed to\nA = ASN\u00d7 e2 on \u03a31, (53)\nwhere e2 is the unit normal vector in the axial direction, and\nAS : { T \u2192 R t 7\u2192 AS(t)\n(54)\nis another state variable. For details regarding this boundary condition, the reader is referred to [43]. In general, gauging is required for the uniqueness of the vector potential in three dimensions, as can also be seen in [43]. However, for the axisymmetric case considered herein, gauging can be achieved by requiring that only the circumferential component of A is non-zero, which is assumed henceforth.\nVariant 2: Scalar Potential Formulation\nAnother possibility is to apply the procedure described in Section 2.6.2 to eliminate D. A technical difficulty occurring in this context is that the normal electric displacement D \u00b7N on the surfaces \u03a32 and \u03a33 cannot be eliminated. To resolve this issue, the additional state variable\n\u03c9 : { (\u03a32 \u222a \u03a33)\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03c9(X, t)\n(55)\nis introduced, which represents D \u00b7N. Then,\n\u03a8U,red[U] = \u222b \u2126 { \u2212 e 2 \u2207\u03d5 \u00b7 F\u22121 \u00b7 F\u2212> \u00b7 \u2207\u03d5 + \u00b5 e 2 [ tr ( F> \u00b7 F ) \u2212 2 ln(J)\u2212 3 ] + \u00b5i\n2\n[ tr ( Ui \u22121 \u00b7 F> \u00b7 F \u00b7Ui\u22121 ) \u2212 2 ( J \u2212 Ji ) \u2212 3 ] + \u03c10g(u)Z } dV, (56)\n\u03a8P,red[P, U] = \u222b \u2126 [ p(1\u2212 J) + pi ( 1\u2212 Ji )] dV \u2212 \u222b \u03a31 luZ (u)Z dS\u2212 \u222b \u03a32\u222a\u03a33 \u03d5\u03c9 dS, (57)\nand P[U\u0307, V\u0307; U, t] = \u2212 \u222b \u03a33 U(t)\u03c9\u0307 dS, (58)\nwhile \u2206\u030a remains unchanged. In this formulation, \u03c9\u0307 acts as a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the boundary conditions\n\u03d5 = 0 on \u03a32 (59)\n\u03d5 = U(t) on \u03a33. (60)\nBy imposing the latter conditions directly as Dirichlet constraints for \u03d5, the state variable \u03c9 is eliminated from the set of unknown variables.\n5.1.6. Normalization\nIn order to improve the conditioning of the finite element system matrices and to remove units from the simulations, it is advantageous to normalize the equations. Here, the normalization proposed by Hong [42] is used:\nX\u0303 = X H , t\u0303 = t\u00b5i \u03b7 , \u2207\u0303( ) = \u2207( )H, \u02dc\u0307( ) = \u02d9( ) \u03b7 \u00b5i ,\nu\u0303 = u H , D\u0303 = D \u221a \u00b5e , U\u0303i = Ui, A\u0303 = A H \u221a \u00b5e ,\n\u03d5\u0303 = \u03d5\nH\n\u221a e\n\u00b5 , p\u0303 = p \u00b5 , p\u0303i = pi \u00b5 , l\u0303uZ = luZ \u00b5 ,\nt\u03030 = t0\u00b5i\n\u03b7 , t\u0303e =\nte\u00b5i\n\u03b7 , U\u0303e = Ue H\n\u221a e\n\u00b5 ,\nH\u0303 = 1, L\u0303 = H L , \u00b5\u0303e = \u00b5e\n\u00b5 , \u00b5\u0303i =\n\u00b5i \u00b5 , e\u0303 = 1, \u03b7\u0303 = \u00b5i \u00b5 , \u03c1\u03030 g\u0303 = \u03c10gH \u00b5 ,\n(61)\nwhere \u00b5 = \u00b5e + \u00b5i.\n5.1.7. Parameters\nThe parameters used in the numerical example below are listed in Table 1.\n5.1.8. Spatial Discretization, Temporal Discretization\nThe \u03b1-family with \u03b1 = 1/2 is used for temporal discretization. The spatial discretization is done in the two-dimensional axisymmetric setting, thus reducing the number of scalar fields required for the representation of u and D to two each, and for Ui to four. In the case of the vector potential A, only a single scalar field is required since only the circumferential component is non-zero. The particular quadrilateral finite elements employed for the analysis are compiled in Table 2. In this table, the nomenclature of the deal.II library [44] is used. It is noted that the use of the pair RT1 \u2212DGQ1 for D\u2212 \u03d5 is empirical since the usual proof of stability cannot be readily extended to the axisymmetric case. In contrast, positive results concerning the stability of the pair Q2 \u2212 P1 for u\u2212 p for the axisymmetric Stokes\nproblem are available in the literature [45]. Moreover, it is noted that the support points of the elements used for Ui and pi have been chosen to coincide with the quadrature points; and, as a consequence, these variables become \u201clocal\u201d variables similar to the plastic strain in classical elastoplasticity (in fact, these variables can be eliminated at the quadrature point level, although this was not performed herein).\n5.1.9. Initial Values\nAs mentioned earlier, the initial values for the state variables and auxiliary state variables need to be determined before the calculation. Due to the action of the gravitational acceleration, the initial state is inhomogeneous and must, therefore, be determined numerically. This has for simplicity been achieved by taking a very small time step of 1 \u00b7 10\u22128 t\u0303e with \u03b1 = 1 before the actual computation, such that any increments in Ui remain negligibly small. A more rigorous approach would be to explicitly constrain U\u0307i to zero for determining the initial values. This has, however, not been implemented yet.\n5.1.10. Example Calculations and Results\nThe implementation of the constitutive equations and the numerical procedures were first validated against the results obtained by Hong [42], as can be seen in Appendix A. Subsequently, spatial and temporal convergence studies have been performed for the formulations in terms of D\u2212 \u03d5 (\u201cmixed formulation\u201d), A (\u201cvector potential formulation\u201d) and \u03d5 (\u201cscalar potential formulation\u201d). The starting point for these simulations is to take Nt = 16 equally spaced time increments for the entire simulation together with a coarse finite element mesh consisting of five rectangular cells in the radial direction and a single rectangular cell in the axial direction, see Figure 3 for an illustration of the coarse finite element mesh. Then, the number of time increments is increased to Nt = 16 \u00b7 2mt , where mt is the refinement cycle. Similarly, the finite element mesh is uniformly refined mh times (in this work, the term \u201cuniform refinement\u201d refers to splitting a rectangular cell into four equally shaped rectangular cells by introducing new vertices at the midpoints of the edges and at the center of the cell). In particular, calculations with mt = 0, 1, . . . , mt,max (mt,max = 6) and mh = 0 were performed to study the convergence behavior in time; and calculations with mh = 0, 1, . . . , mh,max (mh,max = 6) and mt = 0 were performed to study the spatial convergence behavior. For the finest mesh with mh = 6, this results in 1,231,108 degrees of freedom for the scalar potential formulation, 1,395,075 degrees of freedom for the mixed formulation, and 1,231,109 degrees of freedom for the vector potential formulation. However, it is emphasized that the computational cost cannot be directly related to the number of unknowns, since the system structure as well as the linear solver employed also play a major role in this regard; and the study of these aspects is beyond the scope of the present contribution.\nWith regard to the convergence behavior in time, the error emt is, for each m t =\n0, 1, . . . , mt,max \u2212 1, evaluated according to\nemt = \u2225\u2225\u2207\u0303u\u0303mt \u2212 \u2207\u0303u\u0303mt,max\u2225\u2225L2 . (62)\nFor simplicity, no other unknowns are included into the error. However, it has also been checked that the other unknowns show the expected convergence behavior. An analogous approach is utilized to assess the spatial convergence behavior. In particular, the error emh is, for each m h = 0, 1, . . . , mh,max \u2212 1, evaluated according to\nemh = \u2225\u2225\u2207\u0303u\u0303mh \u2212 \u2207\u0303u\u0303mh,max\u2225\u2225L2 . (63)\nThe deformed shape of the disc is shown in Figure 3 together with the radial inelastic stretch. It can be noticed that substantial inelastic deformation of approximately 10% takes place at the lateral surface of the body. Figure 4 shows the results of the convergence studies. In particular, Figure 4a shows the temporal convergence behavior, while Figure 4b shows the spatial convergence behavior. It is seen that in both cases the expected rates of convergence of kt = 2 and kh = 2 are observed for all three formulations, which confirms the validity of the approach. It is interesting that all three formulations essentially exhibit the same convergence behavior, a fact which is likely to be attributed to the relatively simple electric field distribution in the disc.\n5.2. Example 2: Swelling/Shrinking of a Hydrogel\nThe second example problem is illustrated in Figure 5. A circular cylinder of hydrogel material with radius H and height H is considered. The hydrogel is assumed to consist of a polymeric backbone material with charged groups attached to it, and an electrolyte composed of water and the ions of a fully dissociated monovalent salt. The polymeric backbone material and water are assumed to be incompressible, and the volume change associated with a change in the concentrations of cations and anions is neglected. It is further assumed that there are no voids in the hydrogel and, hence, the volume fractions of polymeric backbone material and water must locally add up to 1. The constitutive behavior of the hydrogel is assumed to be described by the relations proposed by Acart\u00fcrk [4], with the simplification of local electroneutrality (i.e., the local net space charge density is assumed to be zero). The displacement is fixed to zero at the center of the bottom surface of the cylinder, while all other surfaces are mechanically free. No matter is allowed to flow across the bottom and lateral surfaces. In contrast, water and ions may be exchanged across the top surface, which is in contact with an external electrolytic solution. The latter is composed of water and a fully dissociated monovalent salt of the same type as in the hydrogel, with a prescribed transient homogeneous molar concentration of both cations and anions, of c\u0304ext(t). Starting from equilibrium, the external ion concentration is changed and the response of the hydrogel in terms of swelling/shrinking deformation and change in local water and ion concentrations is tracked.\n5.2.1. Computational Domain\nThe computational domain \u2126 shown in Figure 5 represents the reference configuration of the cylinder, which coincides with the configuration at the initial time t = t0. The in-plane Cartesian coordinates in Figure 2 are again X1 and X2, while the out-of-plane coordinate is X3. In terms of the radial coordinate R and the axial coordinate Z of a cylindrical coordinate system, the body occupies the region described by 0 \u2264 R \u2264 H and 0 \u2264 Z \u2264 H. The lateral surface of the cylinder is \u03a31, the bottom surface \u03a32, and the top surface \u03a33.\n5.2.2. Unknown Variables State Variables\nThe thermodynamic state variables\nu :\n{ \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R3\n(X, t) 7\u2192 u(X, t). (64)\ncH2O : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 cH2O(X, t)\n(65)\nci : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 ci(X, t)\n(66)\nare introduced, where i \u2208 {A+, B\u2212}. The corresponding initial conditions read\nu(X, t0) = 0 (67) cH2O(X, t0) = c H2O 0 (68)\nci(X, t0) = ci0, (69)\nwith cH2O0 and c i 0 being constants since the initial state is homogeneous. The thermodynamic state variables have the following significance:\n\u2022 u is the mechanical displacement field. \u2022 cH2O is the referential molar concentration of water (with regard to the total volume in the reference state). \u2022 ci are the referential molar concentrations of the A+ and B\u2212 ions (with regard to the\ntotal volume in the reference state).\nThese thermodynamic state variables are supplemented by the auxiliary state variables\np : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 p(X, t)\n(70)\n\u03d5 : { \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03d5(X, t)\n(71)\ntogether with the corresponding initial conditions\np(X, t0) = p0 (72)\n\u03d5(X, t0) = \u03d50, (73)\nwhere p0 and \u03d50 are constants. The auxiliary state variables have the following significance:\n\u2022 p is a pressure type variable, which acts as a Lagrangian multiplier enforcing the condition that the volume fractions of water and polymeric backbone material must add up to 1 everywhere. \u2022 \u03d5 is the electric scalar potential, which enforces the local electroneutrality condition.\nIt is noted that the constants cH2O0 , c i 0, p0, and \u03d50 cannot be chosen independently.\nRather, they are interrelated through the assumption that the initial state at time t = t0 is equilibrated.\nProcess Variables\nThe process variables involved in the problem are\nIH2O :\n{ \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R3\n(X, t) 7\u2192 IH2O(X, t) (74)\nIi :\n{ \u2126\u00d7 T \u2192 R3\n(X, t) 7\u2192 Ii(X, t) (75)\nThese have the following significance:\n\u2022 IH2O is the time-integrated referential flux of water in the hydrogel. \u2022 Ii are the time-integrated referential fluxes of the ionic species i \u2208 {A+, B\u2212}.\nLagrangian Multipliers\nThe Lagrangian multipliers\n\u03b7H2O : { \u2126\u00d7 (T \\ t0)\u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03b7H2O(X, t)\n(76)\n\u03b7i : { \u2126\u00d7 (T \\ t0)\u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03b7i(X, t)\n(77)\n\u03d5s : { \u03a33 \u00d7 (T \\ t0)\u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 \u03d5s(X, t)\n(78)\nare introduced. These have the following significance:\n\u2022 \u03b7H2O and \u03b7i are used to incorporate the respective balance equations for water and the ionic species A+ and B\u2212. \u2022 \u03d5s is used to ensure that no net charge flows locally across \u03a33. It is noted in this context that the assumption of no local net charge flow implies a certain behavior of the external solution bath. Other assumptions are possible (e.g., no global net charge flow), however, these are in any case only an approximation to the real behavior; and for the proper resolution of the behavior at the boundary, the exterior solution bath needs to be explicitly modeled.\nDirichlet Constraints\nThe unknowns u, IH2O, Ii and \u03b7B \u2212 are subject to the following Dirichlet type constraints\nu = 0 at X = (0, 0, 0) (79)\nIH2O \u00b7N = 0 on \u03a31 \u222a \u03a32 (80) Ii \u00b7N = 0 on \u03a31 \u222a \u03a32 (81)\n\u03b7B \u2212 = \u03b7B \u2212 0 at X = (0, 0, 0). (82)\nHere, \u03b7B \u2212 is constrained to the arbitrary constant \u03b7B \u2212\n0 at the origin in order to ensure the uniqueness of the involved scalar potential type quantities, which are only determined up to a constant by the model.\n5.2.3. Dependent Fields\nAs before, only the \u201cnon-trivial\u201d-dependent fields are listed; and the mechanical deformation gradient\nF = \u2207u + I (83)\nis the only field of this type.\n5.2.4. The Functionals Helmholtz Free Energy Functional \u03a8\nThe part \u03a8U of the Helmholtz free energy functional is assumed to take the form\n\u03a8U[U] = \u222b \u2126 \u03c8el(F)dV + \u222b \u2126 cH2O\u03c8fl ( ci cH2O ) dV, (84)\nwith the first integral representing the elastic-free energy contribution of the polymeric backbone and the second integral the free energy contributions of the fluid. In particular,\n\u03c8el = \u00b5\n2\n[ tr ( F> \u00b7 F ) \u2212 2 ln(J)\u2212 3 ] + \u03bb(1\u2212 n0)2 ( J \u2212 1\n1\u2212 n0 \u2212 ln J \u2212 n0 1\u2212 n0\n) , (85)\n\u03c8fl = \u2211 i\nci cH2O RT [ ln ( ci cH2O ) \u2212 1 ]\n(86)\nare assumed. Here, J = det F again, \u03bb and \u00b5 are Lam\u00e9\u2019s constants, n0 = 1\u2212 cH2O0 V H2O m is the volume fraction of polymeric backbone material in the reference state, where VH2Om denotes the molar volume of water, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.\nThe part \u03a8P of the Helmholtz free energy functional reads\n\u03a8P[P, U] = \u222b \u2126 p ( n0 + cH2OV H2O m \u2212 J ) dV + \u222b \u2126 F\u03d5 ( \u2211 i zici + zC \u2212 cC \u2212 ) dV, (87)\nwhere the first integral enforces the condition that the volume fractions of fluid and polymeric backbone material add up to 1, and the second integral incorporates the electroneutrality condition.

(95)\n5.2.5. Reduced Formulation\nBy using the procedure described in Section 2.6.1, the variables IH2O and Ii can be eliminated on \u2126. This leads to the reduced sets of variables\nV0 =\n( IH2ON\nIiN\n) M0 = M, (96)\nwhere\nIH2ON : { \u03a33 \u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 IH2ON (X, t)\n(97)\nIiN : { \u03a33 \u00d7 T \u2192 R (X, t) 7\u2192 IiN(X, t)\n(98)\nrepresent IH2O \u00b7N and Ii \u00b7N, respectively, on \u03a33.

(99)\nSimilarly to example 1, IH2ON and I i N can be eliminated by imposing appropriate Dirichlet conditions for \u03b7H2O and \u03b7i. However, due to the involvement of \u03d5s in these conditions, the resulting equations are more complicated to implement and hence, IH2ON and I i N are kept as variables.\n5.2.6.

Parameters\nThe set of parameters used below is listed in Table 3. The constitutive parameters have been taken from Table 5.1 in Acart\u00fcrk [4] and normalized. It is noted in this context that some of the parameters are defined differently in the latter work than in the present work, so that some conversion between the parameters is involved. This applies in particular to DH2O, which is equal to RTkF/(\u03b3FRVH2Om ) in the work of Acart\u00fcrk [4] (the quantities kF and \u03b3FR are defined in [4]).\nThe initial values appearing in Table 3 were computed from the condition that the initial state is an equilibrium state, which leads to the following equations\ncH2O0 = 1\u2212 n0 VH2Om\n(101)\ncA + 0 = \u2212 1 2\nzC \u2212 cC \u2212\nzA+ + 1 2|zA+ |\n\u221a( zC\u2212cC\u2212 )2 \u2212 zA+zB\u2212(2c\u0304ext0 cH2O0 VH2Om )2 (102) cB \u2212\n0 = \u2212 1 2\nzC \u2212 cC \u2212\nzB\u2212 + 1 2|zB\u2212 |\n\u221a( zC\u2212cC\u2212 )2 \u2212 zA+zB\u2212(2c\u0304ext0 cH2O0 VH2Om )2 (103) p0 = RT\nVH2Om\n( cA +\n0 + c B\u2212 0\ncH2O0 \u2212 2VH2Om c\u0304ext0\n) (104)\n\u03d50 = RT\nFzA+ ln\n( c\u0304ext0 c H2O 0 V H2O m\ncA+0\n) . (105)\nThe corresponding normalized values given in Table 3 are subject to rounding. However, in the simulations, values accurate to within numerical accuracy have been used. This also applies to \u03bb\u0303, \u00b5\u0303 and D\u0303H2O.\n5.2.8. Spatial Discretization and Temporal Discretization\nAgain, the \u03b1-family with \u03b1 = 1/2 is used for temporal discretization, and the spatial discretization is performed in the two-dimensional axisymmetric setting. The particular quadrilateral finite elements employed for the analysis are compiled in Table 4. No elements are given for IH2O and Ii in this table because only the reduced formulation is considered in the numerical example below. It is noted that there are no interface terms coupling the unknowns associated with the discontinuous finite elements of type DGP1 between\nneighboring cells. This means that the unknowns associated with these elements are local to the cell and can be eliminated with little cost by the direct linear solver. Another possibility would be to use discontinuous Lagrange elements of type DGQ2 for cH2O, ci and \u03d5 with the support points coinciding with the quadrature points. However, to fully benefit from this approach where the respective unknowns are local to the quadrature points, changes to the implementation would be necessary, which have not been implemented yet.\n5.2.9. Example Calculations and Results\nThe implementation of the constitutive equations and the numerical procedures was first validated against a result obtained by Acart\u00fcrk [4], as can be seen in Appendix B. Subsequently, spatial and temporal convergence studies have been performed for the reduced formulation. In the latter case, the starting point is to take Nt = 4 equally spaced time increments for the entire simulation together with a coarse finite element mesh consisting of a single cell. With regard to the definition and evaluation of errors, exactly the same approach as in Section 5.1.10 is used. However, for this example, the convergence behavior in time is studied with mt,max = 8 and mh = 3, while the spatial convergence study is conducted with mh,max = 7 and mt = 2. In the latter case, this results in 577, 033 unknowns for the finest mesh with mh = 7. The deformed shape of the hydrogel cylinder is shown in Figure 6 together with the cation concentration c\u0303A + and the outline of the undeformed cylinder; whilst Figure 7a,b show the results of the temporal and spatial convergence study, respectively. The expected rates of convergence of kt = 2 and kh = 2 are clearly observed as for the first example."

            "text": "In the present contribution, a systematic approach to the thermodynamically consistent modeling of isothermal dissipative continuum problems using the concept of standard dissipative continua is proposed and applied to two example problems. The formulation does explicitly allow for different spatial regions, which are associated with different physics, as well as for the description of interfacial processes, which may be coupled to the physics in the volume. An important conceptual feature of the approach is the distinction between state variables, process variables and Lagrangian multipliers. While the state variables have the usual significance in that they describe the thermodynamic state of the system under consideration, the process variables are used to constrain the ways in which the thermodynamic state can change; and the latter constraints are incorporated with the help of the Lagrangian multipliers. Due to the variational structure of the formulation, a systematic elimination of variables is possible under certain circumstances, thus reducing the number of unknown variables, which is an important aspect for numerical solution procedures. The variational approach is also beneficial in view of the temporal and spatial discretization of the space\u2013time continuous problem. With regard to temporal discretization, it is, at least for a certain class of problems, possible to use generic discretization approaches with known convergence properties. Similarly, when using the finite element method for spatial discretization, much of the classical theory applies. Albeit a large amount of formalization is clearly involved in the presented formulation, it is expected that the associated systematic approach substantially reduces the time penalty associated with implementing complex multiphysics models. At the same time, it likely reduces the potential for error both, during the formulation of multiphysics models as well as during the implementation into program code. In particular, it appears possible to solve a large class of problems using a single, well-tested implementation. Some of the above aspects were demonstrated by considering two example problems. In this context, it was empirically shown that optimal rates of convergence in space and time can be achieved. For the purposes of this work, the example problems were kept simple. However, applications to more complex problems will be described in forthcoming contributions.\nFunding: Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under Grants STA 1593/1-1 and STA 1593/2-1 is gratefully acknowledged.\nData Availability Statement: The source code for the library GalerkinTools and the corresponding documentation are available from the following repository: https://github.com/sebastianstark/GalerkinTools (accessed on 26 February 2023); The source code for the library IncrementalFE and the corresponding documentation are available from the following repository: https:\n//github.com/sebastian-stark/IncrementalFE (accessed on 26 February 2023); The source code used for the second example is available from the following repository: https://github.com/sebastianstark/hydrogel_model_concentration_change (accessed on 26 February 2023); The source code used for the first example is in part available from the author upon request (the full source code cannot be made publicly available due to the use of a software library, which cannot be made available for legal reasons).\nAcknowledgments: The author wishes to thank B.D.

            "text": "In order to verify the correct implementation of the constitutive relations for example 1, some results were compared to those obtained by Hong [42], with Figure A1 showing a representative example. In particular, a laterally free plate of viscoelastic dielectric elastomer is considered, with the fringing fields neglected. An electric voltage is applied across the electrodes on the bottom and top faces of this plate. The resulting nominal electric field in the plate is E\u0303 = \u03d5\u0303/H\u0303, with H\u0303 = 1 being the normalized thickness of the plate. The nominal electric field is increased at a rate of dE\u0303/dt\u0303 = 0.2 until instability takes place. The material parameters used by Hong [42] coincide with the parameters given in Table 1 (note that the definition of the viscosity used by Hong [42] differs by a factor of 2 from the one used in the present work). For the comparisons, the total time interval was split into 1024 equally spaced time increments, and the \u03b1-family with \u03b1 = 1/2 was used for temporal discretization. Since the fields are homogeneous, the use of a single finite element is sufficient. Figure A1 shows the results for the total lateral stretch \u03bb and the inelastic lateral stretch \u03bbi. It is seen that the results obtained with all three formulations are indistinguishable; and these results are consistent with the results of Hong [42], which confirms the correct implementation for at least the case of homogeneous uniaxial fields.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\n1.25\n1.3\nFigure A1.

            "text": "In order to verify the correct implementation of the constitutive relations for example 2, an example problem described by Acart\u00fcrk [4] is considered. The problem involves a block\nof hydrogel material with a width of 0.2 mm and a height of 1 mm in a plane strain setting. The normal mechanical displacement is constrained to zero on the lateral surfaces of the block as well as on its bottom surface, while the top surface is mechanically free. No matter is allowed to flow across the lateral surfaces and the bottom surfaces, while the top surface is in contact with a solution bath in the same way as shown in Figure 5. The ion concentration is linearly ramped from \u02dc\u0304cext = 0.9 to \u02dc\u0304cext = 0.1 between time t\u03030 = 0 and t\u03031 = 0.5. Subsequently, the external ion concentration is kept constant until the end of the simulation at time t\u0303e = 200. In the present work, the calculation was performed with 80 finite elements in the axial direction. For the time stepping, an initial grid was created with 8 equally spaced time increments for the linear ramp and another 8 time increments for the subsequent step with constant external concentration. In the case of the latter, no equal time increment spacing was chosen. Rather, the time increment size was increased by a factor of 3 between subsequent time increments. For the actual computation, this initial temporal grid was uniformly refined six times, thus resulting in 1024 time increments in total. The resulting numerical solution is compared to the variant (SIb) discussed in Acart\u00fcrk [4]. For this variant, the net electric current is constrained to zero; and for the particular one-dimensional problem with a monovalent salt considered herein, this is equivalent to the requirement of local electroneutrality used in this work. It is noted in this context that a number of different formulations were discussed by Acart\u00fcrk [4], which should theoretically be equivalent. However, different results were obtained by Acart\u00fcrk [4]; and this suggests that there are either errors in the implementation or other numerical issues for some of the formulations. The choice to consider the variant (SIb) for comparison is motivated by the fact that the results of this variant agree very well with the results of the present formulation. In particular, Figure A2 shows a comparison of the normal displacement u\u0303Z of the top surface of the hydrogel block over time. Excellent agreement is evident for this case. Figure A3 shows comparisons for the cation concentrations (with regard to the actual volume of the electrolyte) at different instants of time. Again, good agreement is observed.\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nFigure A2.
