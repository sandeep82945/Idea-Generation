    "abstractText": "This study presents the feasibility of estimating the ice thickness of the Shirase Glacier using the synthetic aperture interferometric radar altimeter (SIRAL) on board the CryoSat-2 and the interannual variation of the ice thickness of the Shirase Glacier in 2011\u20132020. The SIRAL data were converted to ice thickness by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, and the results showed that the ice thickness decreased from the grounding line to the terminus of the glacier. Furthermore, the ice thickness decreased 30 km downstream from the grounding line of the glacier in 2012 and 2017, and decreased 55 km and 60 km downstream from the grounding line of the glacier at other times, which was attributed to the discharge of landfast ice and the retreat of the glacier terminus. When the flow of glacial ice can be reasonably approximated as an incompressible fluid, and the law of conservation of mass can be applied to the ice stream, the multiple of the velocity and the underlying ice thickness under a constant ice density can be shown to correspond to the equation of continuity. Consequently, this study revealed that the ice thickness decreases with accelerating flow velocity, which is coincident with past outflow events.",

            "text": "The Antarctic ice sheet accounts for approximately 90% of the ice on Earth. When the ice sheet melts and flows out into the ocean, the sea level will rise by approximately 58 m [1]. The bottom water in the vicinity of Antarctica, which is cold seawater that is highly salinized by sea ice formation, sinks into the deeper layers of the ocean, driving the general circulation of the ocean. This general circulation plays a role in transporting heat to the entire globe. Therefore, quantitatively understanding the ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet is important for understanding global changes. In recent years, glacier flow velocity has increased rapidly in West Antarctica due to basal melting of the ice shelf, and the current ice mass balance, which is the sum of snow accumulation and ice mass discharge, indicates that discharge exceeds accumulation [2]. It has been reported that the ice flow in the Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica has accelerated, and its ice thickness has decreased [3]. While the ice mass balance in East Antarctica is considered to be almost balanced [4,5], the ice mass balance of the Shirase Drainage Basin, which includes the fastest flowing glacier, the Shirase Glacier, has been estimated to be \u22121.9 Gt a\u22121 [6]. As in West Antarctica, it was observed that the basal melting beneath the tongue of the Shirase Glacier caused an inflow of southward-flowing warm water from offshore [7], but the interannual variability of the inflow of warm water needs to be considered. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the ice thickness of the glacier in order to continuously monitor the trend of the ice mass balance. The Antarctic region has a severe weather environment, as well as polar nights and crevasses that make field observation hazardous and difficult. Satellite remote sensing techniques are capable of performing continuous spatiotemporal observation of an area\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1205. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15051205 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1205 2 of 19\nand are effective for studying target areas in the cryosphere. The ice flow estimation of the Shirase Glacier using remote sensing techniques began with the use of two aerial photographs of the floating tongue taken at different times [8,9], enabling the assessment of the ice flow. The results obtained using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (interferometric SAR or InSAR) technique showed that the velocity distribution around the same floating ice tongue ranged from 2.2 to 2.6 km a\u22121 [10]; furthermore, the flow velocity at the grounding line of the Shirase Glacier, which was 2.3 km a\u22121, made it one of the fastest flowing glaciers, and extremely fast compared to most other known glaciers, since the mean flow velocity of the 9 glaciers in East Antarctica is 1.0 km a\u22121 [11]. The application of the offset tracking method to intensity images derived from SAR has been shown to be effective for fast-flowing glaciers such as the Shirase Glacier (e.g., [12]), and the flow velocity at the grounding line has shown no significant changes in the last 24 years [13], while interannual variation in ice thickness remains insufficiently studied. Although optical sensors are affected by clouds, microwave sensors can be used in polar regions because of their high atmospheric transparency, making observations possible under any weather condition. The estimation of ice thickness in cases where the ice shelves are covered by several thousand kilometers of ice in Antarctica can be accomplished by applying hydrostatic equilibrium to radar altimeter (RA) data obtained from the ERS-1, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), with results as reported in [14]. Most recently, in 2010, CryoSat-2 was launched by the ESA, and the estimation of sea ice thickness has revealed a decrease in sea ice volume in the Arctic Ocean [15]. In the Antarctic region, CryoSat-2 is capable of greater coverage than conventional satellite altimeters, and it was able to show that mean elevation has decreased across the entire Antarctic ice sheet [16]. Furthermore, ice thicknesses were obtained for ice shelves by applying hydrostatic equilibrium to CryoSat-2 data [17]. As CryoSat-2 has also been used to observe the area around the Shirase Glacier, we were able to obtain the ice thickness of the glacier. This study presents the possibility of estimating the ice thickness of the Shirase Glacier using microwave radar altimeter data obtained from CryoSat-2, as well as the interannual variation derived from the estimated ice thickness."

            "text": "The Shirase Glacier is located approximately 150 km south of Syowa Station (Figure 1a). The drainage basin of the Shirase Glacier is located in Dronning Maud Land, and forms part of the Mizuho Plateau [18,19]. The drainage basin of the Shirase Glacier is also the terminus of the ice stream of the Shirase Glacier, which reaches L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay in the form of a floating ice tongue (Figure 1a). Given that the floating ice tongue is surrounded by the landfast ice that covers most of L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay, the glacier mass has no direct outlet from the bay [20]. Focusing on the interannual variation in ice thickness in the calving area of the Shirase Glacier, the grounding line of the glacier is the boundary between the bedrock under the ice sheet and the ocean; the glacier ice in the region downstream from the grounding line floats into the ocean as an ice tongue. Hence, the ice thickness can be estimated by applying hydrostatic equilibrium to the calving area of the Shirase Glacier. This study used CryoSat-2/SIRAL data, which was obtained by observing the downstream region of the Shirase Glacier from its grounding line. The grounding line was determined on the basis of the detailed detection results obtained using the InSAR technique [21]. To estimate the ice thickness, the central streamline of the glacier had to be determined, and it was derived from the image acquired by the Landsat-8 in 2016 in the middle of the analysis period of this study. Then, the area to be analyzed was set to a width of \u00b13 km from the central streamline. The true-color composite Landsat-8 image used in this study is shown in Figure 1.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1205 3 of 19\nRemote Sens. 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 19\nThe elevation of the exposed rock area is unaffected by ice sheet fluctuations, since that area is not covered by the ice sheet. Hence, the accuracy of the CryoSat-2/SIRAL data can be validated by examining the long-term change in elevation in the exposed rock area. However, as described in Section 2.2, the measured position was dispersed in the exposed rock area, and then the measured position was nonuniform along the track of the satellite. This made it difficult to obtain the elevation at the desired measurement position, because the surface of the exposed rock was characterized by large undulations, which caused a deviation from the original measurement position of the CryoSat-2.\nFigure 1.

Three exposed rock areas, Rundv\u00e5gshetta, Skallevikshalsen and Skallen, are located approximately 10 km east of the terminus of the Shirase Glacier. In each exposed rock area, there are three ponds, Maruwan O-ike, Dairi Ike and Skallen O-ike (Figure 1b). The ponds are 200\u2013300 m wide and 600\u2013800 m long, and there are more than a dozen data of SIRAL datasets obtained from the ponds during the period analyzed in this study. Skallen O-ike originates from drift melt water, while Dairi Ike originates from glacial melt water [23]. Maruwan O-ike is a depression surrounded by hills and filled with water, which can be observed from the 1:25,000 topographic map published by the GSI. Hence, Maruwan O-ike can be regarded as being similar to Dairi Ike and Skallen O-ike. In addition to these geographical features, the three ponds are always filled with fresh water, and the ponds\u2019 surfaces can be considered to remain at a constant height. Therefore, the accuracy of the SIRAL data in this study was validated by examining long-term changes in the elevations of the three ponds."

            "text": "Cryosat-2 was launched by ESA in 2010. The SAR interferometric radar altimeter (SIRAL) on board is a microwave altimeter operating in the Ku band (13.6 GHz). The SIRAL has three different observation modes, depending on the features of what is being observed: low-resolution mode, SAR mode, and SAR interferometric (SIN) mode. The low-resolution mode is used to perform observations over ice sheet interiors and oceans. The SAR mode is used to perform observations over sea ice and ocean areas, and the SIN mode is used to perform observations around ice sheet margins and mountain glaciers. The specifications of CryoSat-2/SIRAL are shown in Table 1.\nThe Shirase Glacier was observed using the SIN mode because of its location in the coastal part of the ice sheet, connected to the southern part of L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay. Therefore, the SIN mode data used in this study were of level 2, with ice baseline D products. The products covering the Shirase Glacier, in which atmospheric and tidal corrections are applied, are available from 2011 to 2020. The amounts of CryoSat-2/SIRAL data are summarized in Table 2 (details regarding acquisition day are listed in Table A1).\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1205 5 of 19\nConventional radar altimeters have a high degree of error in the form of slope-induced error in elevations as a result of its large footprint [24,25]. The radar altimeter measures the\nclosest point within this footprint, which is not the same as the subsatellite location in the\ncase of irregular terrain with slopes. This leads to problems in accurately determining eleva-\ntion using a radar altimeter, which performs measurements within a footprint that includes large slopes such as the ice sheet margin [26]. To solve this problem, the CryoSat-2/SIRAL employs the SIN mode. Based on the Delay/Doppler RA principle [27], the resolution of the SIN mode is improved to approximately 300 m in the along-track direction as a result of the segmentalized footprint in low-resolution mode. Because the footprint size is improved only in the along-track direction, the resolution in the across-track direction remains approximately 1.6 km, the same as in low-resolution mode [28]. Furthermore, SIN mode uses the phase difference between the reflected waves received by the two antennas on the CryoSat-2/SIRAL equipment in order to determine the arrival angle of the former reflected wave, to improve the accuracy of elevation measurement. In SIN mode, there is an offset in the across-track direction in the ground track projected from the satellite location, because the measurement position in SIN mode does not correspond to the location of the subsatellite in the case of irregular terrain with slopes. Hence, the measurement position when using SIN mode is ambiguous, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, in this study, gridding was applied to the observation results obtained using SIN mode, as described in Section S3, in order to be able to analyze the data.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 19\nprinciple [27], the resolution of the SIN mode is improved to approximately 300 m in the along-track direction as a result of the segmentalized footprint in low-resolution mode.

The snowfall on the Shirase Glacier was difficult to observe in situ due to the fast-flowing nature of the glacier; therefore, we were unable to obtain snowfall data. Through personal communication with one of the co-authors of [7], a snow depth on the glacier of 3.1 m at a location approximately 20 km downstream from the grounding line in January 2020, determined via helicopter transfer onto the glacier, was obtained. The microwave penetration depth of the CryoSat2/SIRAL (Ku-band: 13.575 GHz) for the snow layer was calculated to be 42.6 m, assuming a density and dielectric constant of 0.3 g cm\u20133 and 1.47\u2013j0.0001 [31], respectively. Since the penetration depth was one order larger than the measured snow depth, we considered the snow on the glacier to make a negligible contribution to the backscatter of CryoSat2/SIRAL. Therefore, we did not apply backscatter correction to the CryoSat-2/SIRAL data used in this study.\nPrevious research has shown that performing backscatter correction on radar altimeter data can reduce spurious changes in elevation [29,30].

In this figure, the line indicates the mean ice thickness and the error bar indicates the accuracy of the estimated ice thickness obtained in Section 3.1. In Figure 5a, the mean ice thickness derived from the CryoSat-2 height was 529.6 \u00b1 9.5 m at the location 10 km downstream from the grounding line and 299.4 \u00b1 9.5 m at the location 60 km downstream from the grounding line. In Figure 5b, the mean ice thickness derived from the AW3D30 height was 629.0 \u00b1 4.8 m at the location 5 km downstream from the grounding line and 302.3 \u00b1 4.8 m at the location 40 km downstream from the grounding line. These results show that the ice thickness decreased between its periphery at the grounding line and the terminus of the Shirase Glacier. In addition, Figure 6 shows the relationship between the ice thickness estimated on the basis of the AW3D30 height and that estimated on the basis of the CryoSat-2 height in the range of 10\u201340 km downstream from the grounding line.

Changes in the ice thickness of the glacier were recorded with temporal changes such as the occurrence of basal melting and past events. To investigate whether the changes in ice thickness controlled those events, we focused on the significant change in ice thickness at a location 30 km downstream from the grounding line in Figure 5a. To examine the association between changes in ice thickness at the location 30 km downstream from the grounding line and past events, we also examined changes in ice thickness at a location 25 km downstream from the grounding line. This is because the ice thickness profile at 30 km downstream should have experienced the same past changes in ice thickness as those at 25 km downstream. The annual mean values of ice thicknesses at 25 km and 30 km downstream from the grounding line are shown in Figure 8. Although the ice thickness in 1998 was not determined in this study, the glacier would have advanced approximately 30 km in 14 years when assuming a flow velocity of 2.3 km a\u20131 at the grounding line of Shirase Glacier [13]. In the profile at 30 km in Figure 8, the ice thickness in 2012 (14 years after 1998) was 330.0 m, while the mean thickness for 2012\u20132020 was 356.5 m; therefore, the difference from the mean was 26.5 m. Hence, the profile at 30 km downstream in 2012 showed a lesser value than in other years. The change in ice thickness 30 km downstream from the grounding line in 2012 should be compared with that at 25 km downstream from the grounding line in 2010 (as there was less than a 5 km advance between 2010 and 2012); however, the ice thickness in 2010 was obtained in this study due to insufficient stacking for the analysis. Consequently, the ice thickness at 25 km downstream from the grounding line in 2011 was verified, and the profile at 25 km in 2011 presented in Figure 8 was the lesser, at 426.4 m (where the mean for 2012\u20132020 was 449.3 m). This was attributed to the acceleration in the glacier flow associated with the retreat of the terminus of the Shirase Glacier in 1998 [12]. Similarly, the ice thickness\nFigure 7.

To examine the association betwee changes in ice thickness at the location 30 km downstream from the grounding line and past events, we also examined changes in ice thickness at a location 25 km downstream from the g ounding line. This is b cause the ice thickness profile at 30 km downstream should have experienced the same past changes in ice thickness as those at 25 o nstream. The annual mean values of ice thicknesses at 25 km and 30 km downstream from the grounding line are shown in Figure 8. Although the ice thickness in 1998 was not determined in this study, the glacier would have advanced approximately 30 km n 14 years when assuming a flow velocity of 2.3 km a\u22121 at the grounding line of Shirase Gl cier [13].

With the glacier advancing approximately 5 km in 2 years, the difference in ice thickness between 55 km and the 60 km downstream from the grounding line presented in Figure 5a was 26.0 m.

However, there was no significant change in ice thickness between 35 km downstream from the grounding line and the terminus of the glacier, whereby the change in ice thickness was determined to be 0.2 m per 5 km on the basis of a simple linear regression analysis. In other words, there might be no significant effect of the basal melting between 35 km downstream from the grounding line and the terminus of the glacier. Hence, the difference of ice thickness was attributed to the discharge of the floating ice tongue and its surrounding landfast ice in 2018. Therefore, the decrease in ice thicknesses observed 30 km downstream from the grounding line in 2012 and 2017 and the mean ice thickness in the terminus of the Shirase Glacier during the analysis period were revealed to be a result of the acceleration of the glacier flow occurring as a result of the discharge of landfast ice and the terminus of the glacier.\ni ure 8. The annual mean of ice thickness at 25 km and 30 km ownstream from the grounding line of the Shirase Gl cier.\nSince the Shirase Glacier has advanced since the retreat of its terminus in 2018 [35], it is expected that the terminus will indicate the change in ice thickness associated with the discharge of the floating ice tongue and its surrounding landfast ice occurring in March\u2013 April 2018. With the glacier advancing approximately 5 km in 2 years, the difference in ice thickness between 55 km and the 60 km downstream from the grounding line presented in Figure 5a was 26.0 m.

            "text": "This study demonstrated the estimation of the ice thickness of the Shirase Glacier by applying an assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the calving region of the glacier on the basis of CryoSat-2/SIRAL data from 2011 to 2020. To validate the accuracy of the CryoSat-2/SIRAL data, temporal changes in the elevation of ponds in exposed rock areas were investigated via a DSM of the AW3D30 and ground survey by means of GSI. The accuracy of the ice thickness estimation performed on the basis of the CryoSat-2 height was determined to be \u00b19.5 m, which was applied as a standard deviation. The mean ice thickness profile along the central streamline of the Shirase Glacier indicates that the ice thickness decreases from the grounding line to the terminus of the glacier. In addition, the trend differed between (1) the range from the grounding line to 30 km downstream and (2) the range from 35 km downstream from the grounding line to the terminus of the glacier. An annual decline in ice thickness of 19.8 m was identified in (1), which is comparable to the estimated decline in ice thickness occurring due to basal melting. Meanwhile, a decline of 0.1 m was identified in (2), which suggests that basal melting makes little contribution to the ice thickness. When the flow of glacial ice can be reasonably approximated as an incompressible fluid and the law of conservation of mass can be applied to the ice stream, the multiple of the velocity and the underlying ice thickness under a constant ice density corresponds to the equation of continuity. Changes in the ice thickness of the glacier occur as a result of temporal changes, such as basal melting, and past events, such as the breaking up and discharge of floating ice tongues and their surrounding landfast ice in L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay. To investigate the changes in ice thickness changes occurring as a result of such events in 1998, 2005 and 2018, we focused on the significant ice thickness change 30 km downstream from the grounding line. Consequently, this study revealed that ice thickness decreases with increasing flow velocity, coinciding with past outflow events. In summary, the estimation of ice thickness performed using the CryoSat-2 height in this study is expected to contribute to accurate mass balance estimation of the Shirase Drainage Basin, since the results take into account interannual changes and discharge events of the Shirase Glacier and its surrounding landfast ice in L\u00fctzow-Holm Bay.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/rs15051205/s1.
