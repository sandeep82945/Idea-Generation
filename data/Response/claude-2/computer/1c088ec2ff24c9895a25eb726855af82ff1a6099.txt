 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore overlapping community detection algorithms. The current work focuses on non-overlapping community detection. Extending the approach to handle overlapping communities could broaden its applicability.

2. Incorporate node feature modifications. The paper only considers graph structure changes. Allowing alterations to node features as well could further enhance deception capabilities. 

3. Investigate alternative graph neural network architectures. The graph convolution layer used currently could be replaced with more advanced architectures like GraphSAGE or GAT to improve representation learning.

4. Apply the method to dynamic graphs. The current approach is designed for static graphs. Adapting it to handle dynamic graphs that change over time is an open challenge. 

5. Analyze the impact on centrality metrics. The paper mentions targeting high centrality nodes. Formal analysis quantifying changes in centrality measures could provide useful insights.
