This study quantified the 13 carbon storage capacity of seagrass (Thalassia hemprichii) meadows that are adjacent to 14 mangroves (MG; Rhizophora apiculate) and without mangroves (WMG) at three locations in 15 tropical Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) of India. The sediment organic matter (OM) 16 carbon (Corg) content was 2-fold higher at the MG sites than WMG sites of all three locations 17 within the top 10 cm. The Corg in the total biomass was higher at MG sites than the biomass at 18 WMG sites. The sediment grain size positively influenced the sediment OM and Corg content. 19 The canopy height of T. hemprichii showed a better relationship with sediment OM and Corg at 20 MG sites. In contrast, the shoot density of T. hemprichii showed a better relationship with 21 sediment OM and Corg at WMG sites. The total carbon in 144 ha of T. hemprichii meadows of 22 all three MG sites was 11031\u00b1 5223 Mg C, whereas the carbon in 148 ha of WMG sites was 23 4921\u00b13725 Mg C. These T. hemprichii meadows of ANI store around 40487\u00b119171 ton of 24 CO2 in the MG sites and 18036 \u00b113672 ton of CO2 at WMG sites. The social cost of these 25 carbon stored in these T. hemprichii meadows is around US$ 34.82 and 1.5 million at the MG 26 and WMG sites, respectively. This study points out the efficiency of seagrass ecosystems of 27 ANI as carbon sinks and the potential of these connected seascapes in increasing the efficiency 28 of seagrass carbon storage. Therefore, this connectivity approach should be further explored to 29 include these connected ecosystems of India as a nature-based solution for climate 30 change mitigation and adaptation plans. 31",

            "text": "Ecologically connected ecosystems are considered more resilient to climate change mitigation 12 by storing increased amounts of carbon than individual ecosystems. This study quantified the 13 carbon storage capacity of seagrass (Thalassia hemprichii) meadows that are adjacent to 14 mangroves (MG; Rhizophora apiculate) and without mangroves (WMG) at three locations in 15 tropical Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) of India. The sediment organic matter (OM) 16 carbon (Corg) content was 2-fold higher at the MG sites than WMG sites of all three locations 17 within the top 10 cm. The Corg in the total biomass was higher at MG sites than the biomass at 18 WMG sites. The sediment grain size positively influenced the sediment OM and Corg content. 19 The canopy height of T. hemprichii showed a better relationship with sediment OM and Corg at 20 MG sites. In contrast, the shoot density of T. hemprichii showed a better relationship with 21 sediment OM and Corg at WMG sites. The total carbon in 144 ha of T. hemprichii meadows of 22 all three MG sites was 11031\u00b1 5223 Mg C, whereas the carbon in 148 ha of WMG sites was 23 4921\u00b13725 Mg C. These T. hemprichii meadows of ANI store around 40487\u00b119171 ton of 24 CO2 in the MG sites and 18036 \u00b113672 ton of CO2 at WMG sites. The social cost of these 25 carbon stored in these T. hemprichii meadows is around US$ 34.82 and 1.5 million at the MG 26 and WMG sites, respectively. This study points out the efficiency of seagrass ecosystems of 27 ANI as carbon sinks and the potential of these connected seascapes in increasing the efficiency 28 of seagrass carbon storage. Therefore, this connectivity approach should be further explored to 29 include these connected ecosystems of India as a nature-based solution for climate 30 change mitigation and adaptation plans. 31\nKeywords: Seagrass, Blue carbon, Tropical islands, Nature-based solution, Ecological 32 connectivity, Mangroves 33\n34\n35\nIntroduction 36\nSeagrasses are keystone coastal ecosystems that act as natural carbon sinks by sequestering 37 atmospheric CO2 and storing it in their sediments. Together with saltmarsh and mangroves, 38 seagrass ecosystems account for the storage of 50% of oceanic organic carbon in their 39 sediments (Duarte et al. 2005). Blue carbon refers to the organic carbon (Corg) stored in these 40 ecosystems that has a high potential for offsetting global carbon emissions derived from 41 anthropogenic activities (Macreadie et al. 2019). As long as these ecosystems are conserved or 42 protected from anthropogenic disturbances, the blue carbon stored in their sediments can be 43 stored safely for millenniums (Duarte et al. 2005; Macreadie et al. 2014). However, once 44 destroyed, these ecosystems act as the source of carbon rather than sinks (Salinas et al. 2020; 45 Serrano et al. 2020; Stankovic et al. 2021). As a result, globally, the importance of blue carbon 46 stored in seagrass ecosystems (19.9 Pg of Corg) has gained attention, and their utilization as a 47 nature-based solution for climate change mitigation is gaining momentum (Stankovic et al., 48 2021; Macreadie et al., 2019; UNEP, 2020). Global research on the blue carbon storage 49 potential of seagrass ecosystems has emphasized the lack of data at local/regional scale studies 50 (Fourqurean et al. 2012a; Howard et al. 2014; Macreadie et al. 2019). Within this framework, 51 India is the least represented in terms of carbon storage in seagrass ecosystems as there is few 52 (n=4) studies providing carbon storage data of the seagrass ecosystems of India considering its 53 vast seagrass ecosystems (Ghosh et al. 2016; Ganguly et al. 2018; Kaladharan et al. 2020; 54 Stankovic et al. 2021). 55 Seagrass ecosystems of India consist of 16 seagrass species that covers an area of 517 km2 56 along the east and the west coast of India, including the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and 57 Lakshadweep up to a depth limit of 21 m (Geevarghese et al. 2018; Bayyana et al. 2020). As 58 mentioned above, the carbon storage potential of these seagrass ecosystems is limited to only 59 a few studies and five species, i.e., Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis from the Chilika 60 lagoon, Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium, and Thalassia hemprichii from Palk 61 Bay and Gulf of Mannar region and H. ovalis and T. hemprichii from the Andaman and 62 Nicobar Islands (Ghosh et al. 2016; Ganguly et al. 2018; Kaladharan et al. 2020; Stankovic et 63 al. 2021). Interestingly, Stankovic et al. (2021) observed that an area of 200 hectares of H. 64 ovalis and T. hemprichii meadows from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands could reduce around 65 3% of the carbon emissions of India, suggesting the massive potential of the seagrass 66 ecosystems of India as a natural carbon sink and its role in offsetting carbon emissions. 67\nConsidering the vast area of seagrass ecosystems in India, the present study aims to quantify 68 the carbon storage capacity of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). The ANI in the 69 Andaman Sea is home to 13 of the 16 seagrass species found in India, covering 29.3 km2 70 (Jagtap et al., 2003; Ragavan et al., 2016). Thalassia hemprichii is one of the keystone seagrass 71 species of ANI found in the sandy intertidal habitats and amidst coral rubbles up to a depth of 72 15 m (Jagtap et al., 2003). Thalassia hemprichii is also found associated with other seagrass 73 species such as H. ovalis and C. rotundata or with mangrove ecosystems (Mishra and 74 Mohanraju 2018; Mishra and Apte 2020; Mishra and Kumar 2020). The association of T. 75 hemprichii with mangroves has increased population dynamics, whereas, in areas without 76 mangroves, the population was declining (Mishra and Apte 2020). However, how this 77 connectivity influences the carbon storage capacity of the seagrass meadows of ANI has never 78 been attempted. 79 Therefore, this study aims to assess the carbon storage capacity of T. hemprichii meadows 80 adjacent to mangroves and without mangroves. Similarly, the study will quantify carbon 81 storage of T. hemprichii meadows associated with other seagrasses such as H. ovalis and C. 82 rotundata. We hypothesize that seagrass areas adjacent to mangroves can accumulate and store 83 higher organic carbon than the individual or mixed seagrass meadows. This study aims to 84 evaluate the economic gains of the carbon stored in these seagrass ecosystems and how these 85 carbon sinks can benefit India\u2019s carbon reduction plans through Intended Nationally 86 Determined Contribution (INDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement 2015. This study 87 proposes leveraging the monetary values of this blue carbon potential for better conservation 88 and management of seagrass ecosystems in these islands and across India. 89\n90\n91\n2.Methods 92"

            "text": "The Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) are situated in the southeast of India in the Andaman 94 Sea (Fig.1). These islands are rich in seagrass and mangroves due to their tropical settings. 95 These islands are part of the global bioregion model five for seagrasses (Short et al., 2007) and 96 have 13 species of seagrasses that are found in the Indian subcontinent (Mishra and Apte, 97 2021). The proposed study surveyed three locations of ANI; Saheed Dweep (hereafter called 98 as Neil Island), Swaraj Dweep (hereafter called as Havelock Island) and Burmanallah situated 99 in the southeast side of ANI (Fig.1). This survey was carried in the summer/dry season (Feb-100 March 2019) of these islands. Sampling was carried out in the coastal ecosystems of the above 101 mentioned three locations where patches of seagrasses (Thalassia hemprichii) and mangroves 102 (Rhizophora apiculate) co-existed. At each location two sites were selected, one where 103 seagrasses are adjacent to mangrove ecosystems (MG) and another without mangroves 104 (WMG). In these study locations a tidal amplitude of 2.45m, a temperature range of 26.28 to 105 31.67\u00b0C, and a salinity range 32 to 35 existed. Being an island ecosystem, these study areas 106 exhibited a matrix of ecosystems, where coral reefs (dead or live) were present towards the 107 seaward side, seagrasses in the middle and mangroves towards landward side (Mishra and 108 Mohanraju 2018; Mishra and Apte 2020; Mishra et al. 2021) 109\nHavelock island 110\nHavelock Island is also situated in the southeast of ANI and north of Neil Island (Fig.1a). The 111 two sites here were 900-1000 m apart and each site was surrounded by dead coral patches. The 112 T. hemprichii population was found in mono-specific patches at both sites. Thallsia hemprichii 113 population was sampled within a depth of 0.5 m during low tide from meadows adjacent to 114 mangroves (MG;1008 m x 500 m) and without mangroves (WMG ; 886 m x 978 m). 115\nNeil Island 116\nNeil Island is situated in the southeast region of ANI (Fig.1b) The two sites selected 117 here were 1000 m apart and were separated by dead coral patches. Thalassia hemprichii 118 population was sampled at both MG (250m x 900 m) and WMG (200 m x100 m) sites within 119 a depth of 0.5 m during low tide. 120\n121\nBurmanallah 122\nBurmanallah is situated in the southeast region of ANI (Fig.1c). This location has rocky 123 intertidal beaches and human-made coastal concrete walls. The study sites with mangroves 124 have an outlet that discharges land run-off into the mangrove area. The T. hemprichii meadows 125 within the mangrove area were monospecific. The sites here were 1000 m apart from each 126 other. T. hemprichii population was sampled within a depth of 0.3m during low tide from the 127 MG (800 m x 900 m) and WMG (750 m x 800 m) areas. 128\n2.2. Seagrass sampling and analysis 129\nTen quadrats were collected randomly from a transect of 30 m perpendicular to the 130 beach at both sites within a depth of 0.5m during low tide. We used a quadrat of 20 cm x 20 131 cm and a hand shovel to dig out seagrass samples up to 10 cm in depth. The density (individual 132 m-2), biomass (g DWm-2) and canopy height (cm) values were obtained from Mishra and Apte, 133 (2020; See Supplementary Table 2). The separated and dried biomass of 0.2 mg was combusted 134 using a CHNS analyser (Elementar, UNICUBE) to determine the total organic carbon (Corg). 135 The biomass (g DWm-2) was converted to Mg C DW ha-1 after multiplying by the carbon 136 content (%C) in the above-ground and below-ground biomass. 137\n2.3. Sediment sampling and analysis 138\nSediment cores (n=10) were collected from each quadrat where seagrass was sampled 139 using 5cm diameter and 10 cm long plastic core. It was not possible to collect sediment cores 140 higher than 10 cm depth because of the habitat structure, which is mostly made of coral reefs 141 or rocks of volcanic origin. The collected sediment cores were stored in plastic zip-lock bags 142 and brought to the laboratory. In the laboratory, the sediment samples were oven-dried at 60\u00b0C 143 for 72 hours before being sieved for grain size fractions. The sediment samples were 144 homogenized using a disc mill (Retsch, RS 200, USA) after the removal of large stones or 145 twigs. 146\nThen the dry bulk density (DBD g/cm3) of the sediment was calculated as 147 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37 = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(1) 148 Following the loss on ignition (LOI) method, five grams of homogenized sediment samples 149 was heated to combustion at 450\u00ba C for 4 hours using a muffle furnace (Heiri et al., 2001). The 150 LOI (%) was calculated as 151\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f (%) = \ufffd\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\u2212\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 \ufffd \u2217 100\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. (2) 152 Where A is the initial weight of sediment in grams and B is the final weight of sediment after 153 combustion. 154\nFrom the remaining fraction of the homogenized sediment, 1gm of sediment was acid treated 155 with 10% HCl for 24 hours, washed with distilled water and dried again at 60\u00ba C for 24 hours 156 (Howard et al., 2014). From this acid treated sediment samples 0.2 mg was combusted using 157 CHNS analyser (Elementar, UNICUBE) to determine the total C. A regional relationship 158 between organic matter (%LOI) and carbon (%C) content in the sediment was calculated using 159 sediment samples (n=18) from seagrass meadows with mangroves and without mangroves 160 (Fig.2). The fraction of organic carbon (%Corg) was then calculated using the following 161 relationship: 162\n%\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 = \u22120.406 + (0.512 \u2217 %\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(MG; R2= 0.94)\u2026\u2026\u2026.(3) 163 %\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 = \u22121.117 + (0.496 \u2217 %\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(WMG; R2=0.89)\u2026\u2026..(4) 164 The total carbon (Mg ha-1) was calculated by adding the total carbon in the sediment and the 165 seagrass biomass (Howard et al., 2014). The total areas of all seagrass meadows included in 166 this study (Table1) were multiplied by the quantified carbon present in the seagrass biomass 167 (Mg C ha-1) and in the sediment (Mg C ha-1) to calculate the total carbon stored in these seagrass 168 meadows of three locations of ANI. The carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emission/storage per 169 hectare (Mg CO2 ha-1) was calculated by multiplying the CO2 conversion factor (3.67) by the 170 mean carbon stock of the seagrass ecosystem (Howard et al., 2014). 171\n2.4.Valuation of carbon sequestration and storage 172\nThe social cost of carbon (SCC) represents the economic cost associated with climate chage 173 related damage (or benefit) due to emission of one ton of CO2 or its equivalent (Nordhaus 2017; 174 Ricke et al. 2018). We used the regional approach to estimate SCC, than the global approach, 175 as country level (regional) estimates allow better understanding of regional impacts and are 176 important for better adaptation and compensation measures (Ricke et al., 2018). We used the 177 recent estimate of SCC for India, which is US$86 per ton CO2 (Ricke et al., 2018). Recent US$ 178 to Indian Rupees (INR) conversion was used to estimate the price of CO2 in rupees. 179\n180\nStatistics 181\nPearson Correlation was used to test the effects of plant height and density in trapping higher 182 or lower organic matter/carbon content in the meadows. Similarly, a correlation between 183 sediment grain size and organic matter/organic carbon was tested to check the influence of 184 sediment grain size in storing higher or lower organic matter/carbon. Two-way ANOVA was 185 used to test the significant differences between T. hemprichii density and biomass estimates 186 with sites (with mangroves (MG) and without mangroves (WMG)) and locations of ANI (Neil, 187 Havelock, and Burmanallah) as fixed factors. All data was pre-checked for normality and 188 homogeneity of variance. When variances were not homogenous, data were ln (x+1) 189 transformed. When there were significant effects, the Holm-Sidak test was performed for a 190 posteriori comparison among factor levels. All statistical tests were conducted at a significance 191 level of p < 0.05 (Sokal and Rohlf, 2012), and data are presented as mean and standard error 192 (S.E.). Sigmaplot (ver. 11.01.102) software was used for all statistical analyses. 193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n3.Results 199 The sediment dry bulk density of T. hemprichii meadows was significantly different (p<0.001) 200 between the three locations than among the MG and WMG sites of each location (Table 1). In 201 general, the dry bulk density was 1-fold higher among the T. hemprichii meadows associated 202 without mangroves (0.84 \u00b1 0.13 g cm-3) than the meadows with mangroves (0.75\u00b10.23 g cm-3) 203 (Table 1). The mean organic matter (52.55\u00b116.49 % DW) and Corg (26.51\u00b18.44 % DW) in the 204 sediment of T. hemprichii meadows associated with MG sites was 1.3-fold and 1.4-fold higher 205 than the meadows of WMG areas (Table 1). The relationship between the sediment organic 206 matter and Corg were significant for both MG (R2=0.94) and WMG (R2=0.89) locations, with a 207 better relationship at T. hemprichii meadows within the MG than WMG areas at all three 208 locations (Fig.2). 209 The mean AB-and BG-biomass were significant and different between the locations and sites 210 (Fig.3). The AB-biomass (1.99 \u00b1 0.48 Mg DW ha-1) of T. hemprichii at the MG sites was 2.4-211 fold higher than the biomass at WMG sites (0.82 \u00b1 0.31 Mg DW ha-1). The BG-biomass of T. 212 hemprichii followed a similar pattern and was 1.5-fold higher at MG (3.94 \u00b1 0.89 Mg DW ha-213 1) than WMG (2.55 \u00b1 0.76 Mg DW ha-1) sites. The total biomass (AB+BG biomass) was higher 214 between the three locations at Neil Island MG sites than at Havelock and Burmanallah locations 215 (Fig.3). In general, the carbon content in AB-biomass (leaves) of T. hemprichii was higher than 216 the BG-biomass (rhizomes + roots), which resulted in higher Corg in the AB-biomass than the 217 BG-biomass (Table 1). The carbon content in AB-biomass was 1.4-fold higher at the MG sites 218 (49.12 \u00b117.12 % DW) than at the WMG sites (35.1\u00b1 5.32 % DW). Similarly, the carbon content 219 in BG-biomass of T. hemprichii at the MG sites (43.37\u00b1 12.26 % DW) was 1.2-fold higher 220 than WMG sites (34.86\u00b1 5.25 C %DW) (Table 1). These higher carbon content resulted in 221 higher Corg in AB-biomass than BG-biomass at MG sites than WMG sites (Fig.1). The Corg in 222 AB-biomass of T. hemprichii at the MG sites (90.78\u00b1 70.7 Mg C DW ha-1) was 3.2-fold higher 223 than WMG sites (27.74 \u00b1 9.01 Mg C DW ha-1). In contrast, the Corg in BG-biomass of T. 224 hemprichii at the MG sites (141.89 \u00b1 83.7 Mg C DW ha-1) was 1.8-fold higher than WMG sites 225 (78.23\u00b1 45.38 Mg C DW ha-1) (Table 1). Between the three locations, following the total 226 biomass patterns, the Corg in T. hemprichii meadows was higher in the total biomass of the Neil 227 Island than the other two locations (Fig.1). 228\n229 In general, the carbon content in the sediment was lower than that of carbon in the biomass 230 of T. hemprichii meadows at both MG and WMG sites (Table 1). The carbon content in the 231 sediment of T. hemprichii meadows at the MG sites (26.51 \u00b1 8.44 % DW) was 1.4-fold higher 232\nthan the meadows at WMG sites (18.49 \u00b1 6.63 % DW). Among the three locations, the 233 sediments of T. hemprichii meadows at the Burmanallah MG site was recorded with the highest 234 carbon content in the sediment, followed by the Havelock MG site (See Supplementary Table 235 1). A similar pattern was observed for the carbon content in the sediment of T. 236 hemprichii meadows at the WMG sites. 237 Higher carbon content in the sediment at MG sites resulted in higher Corg in T. 238 hemprichii meadows associated with MG sites than WMG sites (Table 1). The mean Corg in 239 the sediment of T. hemprichii meadows at the MG sites (21.87 \u00b111.53 Mg C ha-1) was 1.4-fold 240 higher than the WMG sites (15.62 \u00b1 6.50 Mg C ha-1) (Fig.4). Interestingly owing to the low 241 sediment dry bulk density of T. hemprichii meadows at the MG site of Neil Island, the sediment 242 Corg was 1.2-fold lower at the MG site than the WMG site (Fig.4a). However, among the three 243 locations, the Corg in the sediment of T. hemprichii meadows at Burmanallah was the highest, 244 followed by the MG site of Havelock (Fig.4a). The total Corg in the sediment between the three 245 locations was higher at MG sites (1265.35 \u00b1 1010 Mg C) than at the WMG sites (839.07\u00b1 246 641.05 Mg C) (Table 1). Between the three locations, the highest total Corg in the sediment 247 was recorded in the T. hemprichii meadows of Burmanallah location, followed by Havelock 248 and Neil Islands (See Supplementary Table 1). 249 The carbon storage as CO2 equivalent in the T. hemprichii meadows ranged between 147-250 10400 Mg CO2 at the MG sites and between 28-6529 Mg CO2 at the WMG sites (Fig.4b). The 251 CO2 equivalent storage followed the same pattern as total Corg in the sediment. The average 252 price of this carbon is around 0.39 million US$ for MG sites and 0.26 million US$ for WMG 253 sites, while the price of this carbon in Indian Rupees (INR) was 29.69 and 19.69 million for 254 MG and WMG sites, respectively. The total carbon in the ecosystem (carbon in total biomass+ 255 sediment) was 2-fold higher at the MG sites (272.54\u00b1164 Mg C ha-1) compared to the WMG 256 sites (128.79 \u00b1 55.89 Mg C ha-1) (Table 1). Due to the higher total biomass of T. 257 hemprichii meadows of Neil Island, the total carbon in the ecosystem was higher at the Neil 258 Island MG site, followed by Havelock and Burmanallah locations (Fig.4c). The total Corg for 259 the studied area of T. hemprichii meadows was 2.2-fold higher at MG sites (11031 \u00b1 5223 Mg 260 C) than WMG sites (4921\u00b13725 Mg C). Similarly, the mean carbon equivalent of CO2 storage 261 in the entire ecosystem was higher at MG sites (40487 \u00b1 19171 Mg CO2) than at WMG sites 262 (18036 \u00b1 13672 Mg CO2) (Fig.4d). Among the locations, the MG sites of Neil Island stored 263 the highest CO2 equivalent, followed by Havelock and Burmanallah (Fig.4). The mean price 264 of the carbon stored in the entire ecosystem of T. hemprichii meadows of ANI at MG sites 265\n(34.82 \u00b116.48 million US$) and WMG sites (1.55 \u00b11.17 million US$). The price in INR for 266 MG sites is 2589 million INR, and that of WMG sites is 115.52 million INR (Table 1). 267 The relationship between sediment silt content with organic matter/Corg was significant for 268 both MG and WMG sites, with higher significance at MG sites (Fig.5). The morphometrics of 269 T. hemprichii, such as canopy height and shoot density, positively influenced the sediment 270 organic matter/Corg content at both MG and WMG sites (Fig.6). The canopy height of T. 271 hemprichii showed a better relationship with sediment organic matter/Corg at MG sites of all 272 three locations (Fig.6a & b). In contrast, the shoot density of T. hemprichii showed better 273 relationships at WMG sites of all three locations (Fig.6c & d). 274\n275\n4.Discussion 276 Ecological connectivity between seagrass and mangroves is a multifaceted process and plays 277 an important role in the ecological functioning of coastal ecosystems (Berkstr\u00f6m et al. 2020; 278 Mishra and Apte 2020; Carlson et al. 2021). This connectivity between seagrass and mangrove 279 ecosystems positively influences the carbon storage capacity in the seagrass ecosystems (Juma 280 et al. 2020; Asplund et al. 2021). The present study quantified the carbon storage in ecologically 281 connected seagrass and mangrove ecosystems in a tropical island (ANI) ecosystem and 282 observed that seagrass meadows adjacent to mangrove ecosystems store a higher amount of 283 carbon in their sediment and biomass compared to seagrass ecosystems without mangroves. 284 This influence of ecological connectivity with mangroves on seagrass (T. hemprichii) 285 population dynamics has been previously studied in ANI, India (Mishra and Apte, 2020). 286 However, to our knowledge, this is the first time the influence of mangroves on seagrass carbon 287 storage has been quantified in ANI and India. 288\n289\n4.1. Carbon stored in the sediment 290 Sediment grain size (<63 \u00b5m) plays an important role in carbon accumulation and storage in 291 seagrass meadows across biogeographical regions (Mazarrasa et al. 2018; Ricart et al. 2020; 292 Potouroglou et al. 2021; Santos et al. 2021). The dry bulk density observed in our study was 293 within the global range of sediment density (1.03\u00b10.02 g DW cm3 ) observed for seagrass 294 meadows ((Fourqurean et al. 2012b). In the present study, the fine fraction of sediment (mostly 295 silt) distribution in T. hemprichii meadows associated with mangroves was low at the Neil and 296 Havelock islands. This is because the T. hemprichii meadows were growing on sandy 297 substrates with coral rubbles, and the Rhizophora apiculate mangrove ecosystems of both the 298 islands do not receive land-based run-off, whereas the T. hemprichii meadows at Burmanallah 299 received such input (Mishra and Apte, 2020; Nobi et al., 2010; Savurirajan et al., 2018). 300 Mangrove ecosystems of these islands play an essential role in out-welling nutrients to the 301 surrounding ecosystems, which includes organic matter and organic carbon content (Jha et al. 302 2013, 2015; Sahu et al. 2013; Mishra and Kumar 2020). 303 Seagrass meadows are efficient in trapping sediment and organic matter from the water column 304 that comes their way from the mangrove ecosystem through daily receding tides (Miyajima et 305 al. 2017). Seagrasses utilize the height of their leaves (canopy height) and dense rhizome 306 network to trap the inflowing particles and organic matter (Samper-Villarreal et al. 2016; 307 Potouroglou et al. 2017; Barcelona et al. 2021). This mechanism is evident in our study, as 308 there is a better correlation between the canopy height of T. hemprichii with organic matter 309\ncontent at MG sites (Fig.6). Similar correlations are observed for shoot density and organic 310 matter content in MG sites (Fig.6). However, it is essential to notice here that the T. 311 hemprichii meadows at the WMG sites exhibited better correlations of organic matter with 312 shoot density than the MG sites. This is probably because the WMG sites in our study locations 313 are exposed to high wave dynamics that make them prone to leaf breakage resulting in reduced 314 canopy height (Fig.7b, Mishra and Apte, 2020). As a result, the plant invests in better below 315 ground structures to withstand the wave dynamics, resulting in higher organic matter trapping. 316 Secondly, the ecosystem matrix of Neil and Havelock islands are such that the T. 317 hemprichii meadows at WMG sites are exposed to high intertidal temperatures resulting in leaf 318 damage and leaf reddening (Fig.7a). Similar mechanisms of hydrodynamic setting and its 319 influence on seagrass ecosystems have been observed elsewhere (Beaufort et al., 1998; Saenger 320 & Funge-Smith, 2012). Furthermore, the influence of local hydrodynamic settings, sediment 321 grain size, canopy height and shoot density having a positive effect on various seagrass species 322 and connected mangrove seascapes have also been observed for T. hemprichii, Cymodocea 323 rotundata, Enhalus acoroides and Thalassodendron ciliatum from the coast of Madagascar 324 (Asplund et al., 2021) and Gazi Bay of Kenya on C. rotundata, C. serrulata, E. acoroides, T. 325 ciliatum (Juma et al., 2020). 326 The sediment Corg in our present study is significantly higher (~9-13 times) than other studies 327 of seagrass meadows from the east coast of India (Ghosh et al. 2016; Ganguly et al. 2017a; 328 Kaladharan et al. 2020, 2021). The sediment Corg in our study is also higher than the global 329 average (5.7 \u00b1 0.3 % C DW) but was within the range (0-100 %C DW) reported for various 330 seagrass ecosystems (Fourqurean et al., 2012). However, this global study lacked data points 331 for India, including ANI. Higher Corg in the sediment of ANI could be possible for two reasons, 332 1) the previous authors have mainly studied seagrass ecosystems that are not connected to 333 mangroves. As a result, the sediment organic carbon is not influenced by mangrove based out-334 welling and 2) being an island ecosystem and oligotrophic, the T. hemprichii meadows have 335 adapted to store a higher amount of carbon within their sediment. However, other than 336 mangroves, seaweed and macroalgal communities associated with dead and live corals may 337 have contributed to the sediment organic carbon fraction (Ricart et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2020; 338 Mazarrasa et al. 2021). Higher sediment Corg than the seagrass meadows of the mainland coast 339 of India has also been observed by Sachithanandanam et al. (2020) at Burmanallah and 340 Havelock Island of ANI previously. This indicates that the seagrass ecosystem of ANI stores a 341 higher amount of Corg in their sediment, and the presence or absence of mangroves directly 342 influences this organic carbon storage. In general, it is thought that the seagrass ecosystems 343\ncontribute 98% of the autochthonous Corg in the sediment (Lavery et al. 2013; Serrano et al. 344 2018). However, 50% of this autochthonous Corg is buried in the seagrass meadows, and the 345 rest is transferred to surrounding ecosystems (Duarte and Krause-Jensen, 2017). However, our 346 results suggest that in tropical island ecosystems and adjacent to mangroves, this contribution 347 and storage can change, as seagrass can accumulate and develop organic-rich soil consisting of 348 autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (Kennedy et al. 2010; Duarte et al. 2013) if its 349 remains sheltered and less disturbed compared to disturbed conditions at WMG sites. A similar 350 influence of mangroves on seagrass sediment Corg has been observed for T. hemprichii from 351 the Western Indian Ocean region (Asplund et al., 2021). 352\n353\n4.2. Carbon stored in Total Biomass 354 The mean AB-biomass and BG-biomass at the MG and WMG sites of ANI were within the 355 range limit (AB;2.15 and BG; 5.08 Mg DW ha-1) for the global seagrass ecosystem (Fourqurean 356 et al., 2012). The carbon stored in seagrass BG-biomass is generally 2-fold higher than the AB-357 biomass (Fourqurean et al., 2012), and our results showed a similar pattern (See Supplementary 358 Table 2). The differences in Corg in AB-and BG-biomass was more evident at the WMG sites 359 (2.8-fold) than at the MG sites (1.5-fold) because the AB-biomass of the WMG sites were more 360 prone to breakage and loss than at MG sites. As compensation for this breakage of leaves, T. 361 hemprichii involves most of its stored energy in leaf growth, vertical rhizome growth and 362 below-ground roots (Mishra and Apte, 2020). This resulted in an almost 3-fold higher Corg in 363 the BG-biomass of T. hemprichii at the WMG sites than the AB-biomass. This higher biomass 364 at MG sites of the three locations enhanced the capacity of T. hemprichii meadows to store 365 higher autochthonous Corg in their meadows. The meadow size also facilitated this higher 366 carbon storage, the density, rhizomes, roots, seagrass necromass and dissolved organic carbon 367 are that are higher at MG than WMG sites of the three locations, that contribute significantly 368 to the primary production of these meadows (Mishra and Apte, 2020; Mishra and Kumar, 369 2020), resulting in higher carbon in the biomass. Higher productivity leading to higher carbon 370 storage in the biomass has been observed for T. hemprichii mixed meadows at the Palk Bay 371 and Gulf of Mannar region of Tamil Nadu in India (Ganguly et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2015). 372\n373\n4.3. Total carbon in the seagrass ecosystem 374 The total carbon stored in the seagrass ecosystem (sediment + biomass) at the MG and WMG 375 sites showed a high standard deviation (Table 1) because of differences in habitat configuration 376 of each study location. Secondly, the total meadow size (in hectares) for each of the MG and 377\nWMG sites at all three locations were different. For example, the total biomass of T. 378 hemprichii meadows was higher at the MG site of Neil Island than the other two locations, but 379 due to the small area, the total carbon in the ecosystem was on the lower side (Fig.4). Similarly, 380 with a smaller size at the WMG site, the carbon in the ecosystem was the lowest at Neil Island. 381 Consequently, even though the biomass of T. hemprichii at Burmanallah MG and WMG sites 382 were lower than the other two locations, due to the higher meadow area, the meadows of T. 383 hemprichii had the second-highest carbon in the entire ecosystem (Fig.4). This suggests that 384 seagrass meadow size plays an important role in determining the total carbon storage in the 385 ecosystem. A similar impact of meadow size affecting seagrass carbon storage has been 386 observed for seagrass ecosystems of India at Chilika lake of Odisha, Pulicat lake, Gulf of 387 Mannar and Palk Bay of Tamil Naidu (Ghosh et al. 2016; Ganguly et al. 2017a; Kaladharan et 388 al. 2020, 2021). 389 Previous studies have shown that the total carbon in the seagrass meadows of ANI (184.24 \u00b1 390 23.84 Mg C ha-1) is higher than in other southeast Asian countries (Stankovic et al. 2021). Our 391 findings agree with the previous studies and show that seagrass meadows of ANI have 66% 392 higher carbon storage capacity at MG sites (272.54 \u00b1 164 Mg C ha-1) and low at WMG sites 393 (128.79 \u00b1 55.89 Mg C ha-1). These differences in our study from Stankovic et al. (2021) is 394 probably because the authors derived the total carbon in the ecosystem through a model-based 395 approach, whereas in our study, we have used the traditional methods of quantification 396 recommended for blue carbon research (Howard et al., 2014). The total carbon stock in the T. 397 hemprichii meadows at the MG sites (144ha; 11031 \u00b1 5223 Mg C) was 2-fold higher than the 398 WMG sites (148 ha; 4921 \u00b1 3725 Mg C) of ANI. This indicates that T. hemprichii meadows 399 associated with mangroves can store a higher amount of carbon in the ecosystem than 400 individual seagrass ecosystems. These islands of ANI are oligotrophic; as a result, even though 401 the total meadow size at WMG sites were higher, it did not result in higher carbon storage in 402 the ecosystem. 403 Consequently, with a small meadow size, the MG sites were able to accumulate higher carbon 404 stocks. Because at the MG sites, there is a flow of nutrients and organic matter from the 405 mangrove ecosystem (Mishra and Kumar, 2020; Jha et al., 2015; Sahu et al., 2013) that helps 406 the T. hemprichii meadows in meeting their nutrient demands and increasing productivity 407 (Mishra and Apte, 2020). The total carbon stock in our studies is limited to the upper 10 cm of 408 the sediment depth as dead corals made it challenging to collect increased depth cores. So, the 409 standard extrapolation of sediment depth to 1m was avoided. Similarly, from the seagrass 410 meadow perspective, we estimated the carbon stock in a total of 292 ha for both MG and WMG 411\nsites and have avoided the extrapolation to the total seagrass area of ANI. Avoiding the 412 extrapolation was necessary because, in India, previous seagrass carbons storage research has 413 measured carbon storage in a single species and have extrapolated that data to the total seagrass 414 coverage, which have mixed species of seagrass (Kaladharan et al. 2020, 2021; Ghosh et al. 415 2018). This has resulted in biased carbon storage values because seagrass carbon storage 416 capacity is species-specific, and the local abiotic factors such as hydrodynamics, land run-off, 417 anthropogenic pollution and habitat disturbances play an important role in determining this 418 capacity (Howard et al., 2014; Duarte and Krause-Jensen, 2017; Macreadie et al., 2019). Based 419 on the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) Tier 1 assessment, the MG sites 420 can prevent the emission of 40487 Mg CO2, while the WMG sites can prevent 18036 Mg CO2 421 (Howard et al., 2014). Based on the amount of carbon stored in the MG and WMG site of ANI, 422 the price of this CO2 storage is around 34.82 million US$ for MG sites and 1.55 million US$ 423 for WMG sites. However, our values differ from the previously reported pricing values of 424 Stankovic et al. (2021) for ANI because the previous authors use carbon pricing for ANI based 425 on (Nurdianto and Resosudarmo, 2016) for ASEAN countries, where the price of one ton of 426 CO2 was priced at US$10. Whereas we used the recent price for one ton of CO2 for India by 427 Ricke et al. (2018) at US$86. However, ANI is part of India and not ASEAN countries, which 428 seemed appropriate for estimating the social cost of carbon using the recent price by Ricke et 429 al. (2018). 430\n4.4. Contribution of seagrass ecosystems for India\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Carbon 431\n(INDC) Plans 432 In its INDC commitments under Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCC, 2015), India has pledged 433 to reduce 33-35% of its carbon emissions by 2030. The foundation in achieving this target is 434 laid in the National Environmental Policy, 2006, which promotes sustainable development 435 while protecting and conserving the various ecosystems. The National Action Plan on Climate 436 Change (NAPCC) further sustains the idea of ecosystem management through national 437 missions, which outlines priorities for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. The 438 present studied seagrass ecosystems of ANI can store 0.17 Mg ton (0.007%) of the total CO2 439 emissions of India (2300 Mg ton; Karstensen et al., 2020). However, this fraction is very small 440 considering the huge emissions of India. However, the total seagrass area of ANI was not 441 considered in this study which can reflect different carbon storage scenarios. 442 Furthermore, the blue carbon storage potential of seagrass ecosystems of India needs more 443 detailed studies considering species-specific carbon storage potential. Secondly, seagrass 444 ecosystems of India are missing in any of the climate change mitigation plans (Koshy et al. 445\n2018; Ramesh et al. 2018), whereas mangroves are included. However, through this carbon 446 storage study of ecologically connected seagrass and mangrove ecosystems of ANI, this study 447 emphasizes on the importance of seagrass ecosystems. Secondly, as these seagrass ecosystems 448 are adjacent to mangrove ecosystems of ANI, these ecosystems can be considered along the 449 Mangroves for the Future (MFF) and Island Protection Zones (IPZ) programs of the NAPCC 450 for initiating conservation and management practices for seagrass ecosystems of India that are 451 under decline from various anthropogenic activities (Mishra and Apte, 2020; Mishra et al., 452 2021a, 2021b). Loss of seagrass ecosystems of India will make these ecosystems as source of 453 carbon emission than storehouse and can release various other greenhouse gases (Banerjee et 454 al., 2018). 455\n5.Conclusion 456 Seascape connectivity across blue carbon habitats results in higher carbon storage than 457 individual ecosystems (Huxham et al. 2018; Macreadie et al. 2019) and our results agree 458 showcase this increased carbon storage in seagrass meadows associated with mangroves. This 459 present study adds new data and knowledge to the growing importance of connected 460 ecosystems across coastal seascapes and their role in increased carbon storage in the ecosystem. 461 To our knowledge, this is for the first-time carbon storage of connected ecosystems is reported 462 from India. This study observed a 2-fold increase in carbon storage capacity of seagrass 463 meadows associated with mangroves than without mangroves, probably due to organic matter 464 and carbon input from the mangrove ecosystems. The positive influence of this cross-habitat 465 connectivity on blue carbon storage potential within the coastal seascape of ANI and other parts 466 of India needs further exploration as nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation plans 467 of India. This ecosystem service of seagrasses of India needs to be integrated with NAPCC for 468 better management of seagrass ecosystems of India (UNEP, 2020). 469\n470\n471\nAcknowledgment 472\nA part of this project received funding from the Science and Engineering Board, Government 473 of India, file number PDF/2020/000540.
