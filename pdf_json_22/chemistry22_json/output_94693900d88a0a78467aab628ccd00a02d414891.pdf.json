    "abstractText": "Although miRNAs exist in small quantities in the human body, they are closely related to the abnormal expression of genes in diseases such as tumors. Therefore, sensitive detection of miRNAs is very important for the prevention and treatment of various tumors and major diseases. The purpose of this study is to develop a label-free sensing strategy based on the co-action of double-hairpin molecular beacons and deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) for highly sensitive detection of miRNA-21. The target miRNA-21 promotes the assembly of DNAzyme with a complete catalytic core region. At the presence of Mg2+, DNAzyme cuts a substrate into short chains, which open the double hairpin molecular beacon, and then form G-quadruplexs at both ends, specifically binding more ThT to generate a amplified fluorescent signal. The cut substrate will be replaced by the uncut ones in the next stage, increasing the concentration of reactants, and thus further improving the fluorescence intensity. This DNAzyme assisted double hairpin molecular beacon has a certain degree of discrimination for substances with single base mismatches, and the detection limit of miRNA-21 is 0.13 pM, lower than that of the many other analysis. Further, this detection has good selectivity and sensitivity in serum. Therefore, this strategy provides a simple, fast and low-cost platform for the sensitive detection of miRNA-21, having potential applications in early cancer diagnosis.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid is a class of biopolymer, which is an essential component of all known life forms and the most important substance in all biological molecules. Nucleic acids generally include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA); the difference lies in the five-carbon sugars in the components [1]. DNA is abundant in organisms and stores most of the genetic material. DNA carries the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of RNA and proteins, and is an essential biological macromolecule for the development and normal operation of organisms. RNA is also responsible for regulating the genetic material in the organism, and its role is mainly to guide the synthesis of proteins. The joint action of DNA and RNA can play a role in regulating the expression of various genes, including the expression of various disease genes. Therefore, the detection of DNA and RNA is of great significance for the prediction and diagnosis of various diseases. Among all kinds of RNA, there is a special kind of RNA, miRNA. miRNA is a kind of endogenous small molecule non-coding RNA with a length of about 20\u201324 nucleotides. Its content in the body is extremely low, but it has a variety of important regulatory roles in cells.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 276. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12050276 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 276 2 of 13\nA kind of miRNA can Regulates multiple genes, and there are also situations where multiple miRNAs regulate a gene [2]. The first miRNA was discovered in 1993 [3]; since then, the research on miRNA has gradually increased. Several studies have shown that abnormal expression of miRNA can lead to pathological changes in organisms, such as various types of cancer [4,5], various cardiovascular diseases [6], AIDS [7], diabetes [8], Parkinson\u2019s disease [9], etc. Therefore, miRNAs are a kind of important biomarker. However, miRNAs have the problems of low abundance and many homologous miRNAs, and it has been a serious challenge to develop high-sensitivity and high-specificity miRNA detection strategies in the past few decades. In my previous work, I proposed a fluorescence sensing strategy based on the combined combination of rolling circle amplification and DNAzyme to detect miRNA. The detection system uses miRNA as a promoter to trigger the rolling circle amplification reaction. The long-chain DNA produced by amplification can promote the formation of DNAzyme structure, promote the substrate cleavage reaction, and finally realize the separation of fluorophore and quencher group to generate fluorescence. The sensor has good selectivity and sensitivity. Traditional detection methods for miRNA include northern blotting [10], microarrays [11] and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) [12]. Among them, northern blotting and microarrays have a certain sensitivity and selectivity for detecting miRNA, but these methods are cumbersome in steps, complicated in operation, long in detection period and high in cost, and have certain limitations. RT-PCR, as a method for introducing fluorescent signal into the system to detect miRNA, has strong specificity and sensitivity. However, RT-PCR needs to strictly control the temperature, and there are false positive signals in the detection results. These factors limit this method. Application of detection methods. Therefore, it is necessary to find novel sensing strategies that can accurately detect miRNAs. Emergence of functional nucleic acids provides a new approach for the development of novel sensing strategies [13\u201315]. Functional nucleic acids are a class of oligonucleotides with specific recognition functions. Such nucleic acids are widely used in the construction of various sensors, and the most widely used are nucleic acid aptamers. Nucleic acid aptamers, also known as chemical antibodies, have the advantages of no immune rejection, easy synthesis, good chemical stability, and can be stored at room temperature. Nucleic acid aptamers can specifically bind to various substances (proteins, nucleic acids, ions, glucose, etc.), and the DNA conformation changes after binding, resulting in specific changes [16\u201318]. DNA sensors constructed with nucleic acid aptamers have obvious advantages. Another type of functional nucleic acid is Deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme), which not only has specific recognition function, but also has special catalytic properties. The concept of DNAzyme was first proposed in 1994 [19], Breaker et al. found that DNAzyme can cleavage RNA under the catalysis of Pb2+. After that, various ion-dependent DNAzymes were discovered, and more and more people introduced DNAzymes into the field of biosensors [20]. There are many kinds of DNAzymes, of which the most studied is the cleavage-type DNAzyme. There are two regions in the structure of the cleavage-type DNAzyme, the catalytic core region and the substrate-binding region, and the substrate\u2013 substrate-binding region can pass through alkali. Under the influence of catalytic ions, the DNAzyme is activated to undergo a substrate cleavage reaction [21]. Compared with proteases with similar catalytic functions, DNAzyme have many advantages: low synthesis cost, relatively high catalytic efficiency, low temperature requirements, and little change in catalytic activity after repeated denaturation and renaturation, excellent biological properties. Capacitance. Therefore, the introduction of DNAzymes into biosensors has a good prospect. Xiang et al. proposed a label-free DNA biosensor based on allosteric cleavage DNAzymes for the detection of miRNA and viral DNA, which has high sensitivity and specificity [22]. This experiment introduces a new type of DNAzyme, which includes not only the catalytic core area and substrate binding zone, but also an assembly promotion zone. The existence of the assembly promotion zone can improve the assembly efficiency of\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 276 3 of 13\nDNAzyme, and the sequence of the assembly promotion zone and the target detection object is complete. The presence of target detectors can help DNAzyme quickly assemble, thereby greatly improving detection efficiency, and ordinary cutting DNAzyme has limitations. G-quadruplex is the secondary structure of a class of nucleic acids, and G-quadruplex is a higher-order structure formed by the folding of guanine (G)-rich DNA or RNA. G-quartet (G-quartet) is the structural unit of G-quadruplex. Four Gs are connected by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to form a ring plane, and two or more layers of tetrads form quadruplexes through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking [23]. The concept of G-quadruplex was formally proposed by Sen et al. in 1988 [24], and Mohanty et al. discovered for the first time that Thioflavin T can specifically bind to G-quadruplex, and revealed the mechanism of specific binding, resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity [25]. After that, more and more researches on the G-quadruplex structure were conducted, and more and more people used the G-quadruplex structure in the field of biosensors. Zhang et al. designed a hairpin-type DNA-modified nanogel for the detection of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). After the nanogel specifically bound to PDGF-BB, the fluorescence intensity increased, while the fluorescence signal of the system comes from ThT and G-quadruplex, and the sensor has good sensitivity and selectivity [26]. Chen et al. proposed a sensor for the detection of miRNA-21 based on the interaction of functionalized hairpin probes and isothermal amplification reactions. The fluorescence signal of the sensor is also derived from G-quadruplex and ThT [27]. This kind of label-free detection system is simple in operation, low in cost, and has strong sensitivity, which has certain advantages. MB (Molecular Beacon) is a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide chain. Molecular beacons generally consist of three parts: a ring region, a stem region, and a fluorescent group and a quenching group. When the molecular beacon is folded, the fluorescent group and the quenching group are close to each other, and the fluorescence is quenched. When the molecular beacon is opened, the two groups are far away from each other, and the fluorescence recovers [28]. Compared with the traditional detection system involving the structure of molecular beacon, the sensor involving the structure of unlabeled molecular beacon has advantages, such as low cost, high sensitivity, etc. Shahsavar et al. proposed a label-free DNA sensor based on molecular beacons for the detection of miRNA. The sensor has high sensitivity and specificity, and has better application prospects than ordinary labeled sensors [29]. Based on exponential isothermal amplification and two types of molecular beacons as the source of fluorescent signals, Liu et al. established a sensing strategy combining two signal amplification methods, which is fast, sensitive and has high specificity [30]. In this study, we propose a DNAzyme-based double-hairpin molecular beacon for the detection of miRNA-21 as a label-free sensor. The design idea of the sensor is as follows: miRNA-21 drives the two oligonucleotide chains in the detection system to form a DNAzyme with a catalytic core region and a substrate-binding region. When there are substrates and Mg2+ in the system, substrate cleavage occurs. Reaction, the cut DNA fragments are used in the second step reaction; the second step reaction uses the product of the first step cleavage reaction as a reactant, and a double hairpin probe is added to the system, the cleavage product can open the double hairpin probe and generate G-quadruplex and fluoresce under the action of ThT and K+. This sensing strategy does not involve enzymes and does not require labeling of fluorophores, which reduces the cost and does not require strict temperature control during the experiment."

G-quadruplex sequence was a specific base sequence rich in G. metal ions can induce G-rich nucleic acid aptamer to form G-quadruplex and maintain the stability of the structure. Therefore, K+ can induce and stabilize the formation of G-quadruplex structure. As shown in Figure 4D, with the increasing of K+ concentration, the relative fluorescence intensity increased and then decreased. The overall situation was consistent with the theoretical prediction. Less than 12 \u00b5mol L\u22121, the relative fluorescence intensity was lower than that at 12 \u00b5mol L\u22121, while more than 12 \u00b5mol L\u22121, the relative fluorescence intensity ratio decreased. Therefore, 12 \u00b5mol L\u22121 was selected as the optimal concentration of K+ for next study."

            "text": "DNA with a specific base sequence (generally containing multiple G) can form a G-quadruplex rich structure composed of special hydrogen bonds under the action of fluorescent dye Thioflavin T, and finally increase the fluorescence intensity of the system. Therefore, in this experiment, not only K+ can induce and stabilize G-quadruplex, but ThT fluorescein would also induce the end sequence of double hairpin structure to form G-quadruplex structure. In this experiment, ThT can specifically bind to G-quadruplex structure, so as to significantly increase the fluorescence intensity. Therefore, the more ThT, the higher the fluorescence intensity in theory. It is obvious from Figure 4E that with the concentration of ThT from 0 to 8 \u00b5mol L\u22121, its relative fluorescence intensity increased slowly. However, the increase was more obvious from 0 to 4 \u00b5mol L\u22121, and the relative fluorescence intensity of 4 \u00b5mol L\u22121 to 8 \u00b5mol L\u22121 did not change much. It was speculated that the double hairpin structure has limited G-quadruplex binding sites, and a fixed number of sites can only bind a fixed number of ThT, resulting in little change in relative fluorescence intensity. Therefore, 4 \u00b5mol L\u22121 was finally selected as the optimal concentration of ThT for subsequent concentration gradient analysis."

The sensor is driven by the target miRNA-21 to facilitate the assembly of two types of DNAzymes to form DNAzymes with complete structures. After the hairpin substrate and Mg2+ are added to the system, the cleavage DNAzyme is activated and the substrate cleavage reaction occurs. The fragment of the cleaved substrate can open the double hairpin structure, and the end of the opened double hairpin structure can form a G-quadruplex in the presence of ThT and K+, and the G-quadruplex can bind to ThT. As a result, the fluorescence intensity is greatly increased. The experimental results show that the detection method has good selectivity and can be used for quantitative analysis. In addition, the detection method can also be applied in a relatively complex\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 276 12 of 13\nserum environment.
