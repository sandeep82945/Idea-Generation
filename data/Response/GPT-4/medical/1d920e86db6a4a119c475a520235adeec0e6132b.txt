Prospective Validation of CHA2DS2-VASc Score in Diverse Populations: Conducting prospective studies across multiple centers to validate the prognostic utility of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in IPF patients. This would include different geographic and ethnic populations to understand the score's applicability and potential variations in its predictive power.

Comparative Effectiveness of Prognostic Scores: Investigating how the CHA2DS2-VASc score compares with other prognostic indicators specifically developed for IPF, such as the GAP index, in predicting mortality and hospitalizations. This could also include exploring combinations of scores for improved risk stratification.

Role of Cardioprotective Medications in IPF Patients with High CHA2DS2-VASc Scores: Designing randomized controlled trials to assess the impact of intensified treatment with cardioprotective drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, statins) on the outcomes of IPF patients identified as high risk by the CHA2DS2-VASc score. This could help determine if targeted therapy can mitigate the increased cardiovascular risk.

Assessment of Subclinical Myocardial Dysfunction: Exploring the prognostic value of advanced imaging techniques, such as 2D speckle tracking echocardiography, to detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction in IPF patients. This research could investigate whether integrating these imaging findings with the CHA2DS2-VASc score enhances prognostic accuracy.

Evaluation of Inflammatory and Fibrotic Biomarkers: Examining the role of specific biomarkers (e.g., KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, MMP-7) in conjunction with the CHA2DS2-VASc score for predicting outcomes in IPF patients. This approach could provide insights into the pathophysiological links between IPF and cardiovascular risks, potentially unveiling novel therapeutic targets.
