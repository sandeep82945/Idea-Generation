Intriguingly, atomic trajectories of K + permeation events suggest a dual-ion transport mode, i.e. two like-charged potassium ions are successively captured by the nanopores in the graphene bi-layer and are interconnected by sharing one or two interlayer water molecules. The dual-ion behavior allows rapid release of the exiting potassium ion via a soft knock-on mechanism, which has previously been found only in biological ion channels. As a proof-of-concept utilization of this discovery, we propose a novel way for ionic power generation by mixing KCl and NaCl solutions through the bi-layer graphene nanopores, termed potassium-permselectivity enabled osmotic power generation (PoPee-OPG). Theoretically, the biomimetic device achieves a very high power density of > 10 0 0 W/m 2 with graphene sheets of < 1% porosity. This study provides a blueprint for artificial potassium channels and thus paves the way toward next-generation electric-eel-mimetic ionic power generation.\nKeywords: artificial ion channel, bi-layer graphene, dehydrated ion transport, bio-inspired materials, energy conversion\nI S f T t o t o c b T f s a\na length of 12 A\u030a [ 9 \u201311 ].

A variety of nanomaterials nd molecular structures, such as crown ethers, ucurbituril and foldamers, have been explored for ssembling artificial potassium channels [ 21 \u201326 ]. ypically, their K + /Na + selectivity (SR < 40-fold) alls far behind the biological counterparts. The low electivity is often attributed to the straight tubular onfiguration of ion channels commonly adopted n man-made materials, through which the leak of on-specific Na + becomes unavoidable [ 27 \u201330 ]. owever, a precise design of the rotary ion binding ites has never been attempted before. The present work demonstrates a computational\nesign of an artificial ion channels with strict potasium selectivity. As i l lustrated in Fig. 1 a and b, our esign is based on a bi-layer graphene nanopore unctionalized w ith tw isted carbonyl on the pore dges. The artificial ion channel inhibits the transort of unwanted Na + , even in mixed ionic soutions. The dynamic K + /Na + SR, estimated by sing the transition-state theory, is nearly 1295- old and the K + conduction rate reaches 3.5 \u00d7 0 7 ions/s, approaching the level of biological potas-\nPage 2 of 10\nsium channels. The atomic trajectories of K + permeation events unveil a dual-ion transport mechanism, showing that the release of a K + from the exit of the bi-layer nanopore is achieved by a soft knock-on from another K + at the entrance. The synergetic behavior is facilitated by hydrate water molecules between the graphene layers that establish a kinetic pathway between two confined potassium ions under meta-stable conditions. The potassiumpermselective ion channel enables a novel way of osmotic power generation by mixing KCl and NaCl solutions. For a bi-layer graphene nanopore membrane with a porosity of < 1%, the theoretical power density can be > 10 0 0 W/m 2 . Overall, our results elucidate how the bi-layer nanopore structure with twisted carbonyl functionalization enables strict potassium selectivity and leads to high-performance ionic power generation.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION Carbonyl modified bi-layer graphene nanopore Inspired by the rotary distribution of carbonyl rings in the selectivity filter of biological KcsA channels [ 16 ], we establish a bi-layer graphene nanopore model with twisted carbonyl functionalization as an artificial potassium channel (Fig. 1 a). The carbonyl ring structure was generated by first removing 16 carbon atoms from a graphene lattice, yielding a 9.8 \u00d7 9.9 A\u030a 2 sub-nanometer pore ( Supplementary Fig. S1A), followed by four-site carbonyl functionalization to the pore edges. Each graphene layer mimics the potassium ion binding sites in the biological selectivity filter.\nFigure 1 b shows, for example, the four carbon atoms at positions 0, 2, 5 and 7 that were modified with the carbonyl group in order to yield symmetric potassium ion binding sites in each graphene layer. The configurations with two or more adjacent carbonyl groups were dismissed because of symmetry and unfavorable ion binding energy. Five types of single-layer nanopore elements (termed A0 to A4, respectively, Fig. 1 b) can be obtained by taking a clockwise integral twist of the functionalized positions from the initial configuration (A0).\nAfter carbonyl functionalization, the effective cross-sectional area reduces to \u223c32 A\u030a 2 ( Supplementary Fig. S1A), close to that of the selectivity filter of biological KcsA channels [ 31 ]. The identical strategy was used to generate nanopores in two parallel graphene layers (termed L1 and L2) with the interlayer distance set to 3.35 A\u030a in accordance with the pristine graphite.\nS s W s t fi i d 1 t A a t I m t s t e (\nt t c o s p o n b o o K p p (\nl u d i t u t F ( i T n c t i T f F\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\ntrict potassium ion permeation and odium-ion inhibition e carried out all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) imulations for the transport of K + and Na + through he bi-layer graphene pores with different pore congurations and solution conditions. In all cases, the on transport was driven by an electric field perpenicular to the graphene surface with a strength of 0 mV/nm. The simulation results reveal that, when he nanopore takes the configuration of A0 in L1 and 1 in L2 (shorted as A0A1), K + can permeate at rate of \u223c3.5 \u00d7 10 7 ions/s (Fig. 1 c), approaching hat of biological potassium channels ( \u223c10 8 ions/s). n sharp contrast, not even a single Na + was pereated through the nanopore in the entire simulaion time, showing strict potassium selectivity for ingle electrolyte solutions. In mixed solutions conaining both K + and Na + , the bi-layer nanopore also xhibits perfect K + permeation and Na + inhibition Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The extremely low Na + permeability prohibits he direct estimation of the ion permeation rate hrough MD simulation with a statistical signifiance. As gleaned from the detailed examination f the K + permeation events, the rate-determining tep of the translocation process is the ion hoping from its meta-stable position at the first layer f the graphene to that at the second layer (see the ext section). We estimate the permeation rates of oth K + and Na + based on the single-ion potential f mean force (PMF) and the transition-state thery (see Methods and Supplementary Text S3 ). The\n+ /Na + selectivity is related to the ratio of their ermeation rates, which reaches 1295-fold, even surassing that of the biological potassium channel \u223c10 0 0-fold). The five types of single-layer nanopore elements ead to 25 combinations of bi-layer nanopore configrations ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Excluding the uplicated combinations due to the symmetry, we nvestigate the permeability of K + and Na + through he remaining 13 bi-layer nanopores. The MD simlations were performed under identical condiions to those used for Fig. 1 c. As summarized in ig. 1 d, eight types of hetero-bi-layer nanopores A m A n , m = n ) show strict K + permeation and Na + nhibition, in spite of differing K + permeability. he other four types of homo- or hetero-bi-layer anopores show slight Na + leakage. Even in these ases, their K + permeability is sti l l 5\u201328 times higher han that of Na + . More significant Na + leakage s found in single-layer nanopores ( Supplementary ext S5 ). The static K + /Na + SR reaches merely \u223c3- old, in agreement w ith prev ious studies [ 32 \u201335 ]. or the bi-layer nanopore with configuration A4A4,\nPage 3 of 10\nneither K + or Na + permeation is observed over the entire duration of the MD simulation.\nBased on these results, we conclude that the hetero-bi-layer nanopore structures are responsible for the strict potassium selectivity. First, the bilayer structure prevents the transmission of interfering Na + as observed for the single-layer nanopores. Second, the selectivity and permeation rate can be optimized by using a precise design of the twisted carbonyl groups at the nanopore terminals. In addition, even with flexible carbonyl groups on the pore edge, strict K + /Na + selectivity can be equally held ( Supplementary Text S6 ).\nDual-ion transport mechanism The simulation results indicate that only cations can pass through the bi-layer nanopores. Anion transport is prohibited due to the small pore size and the negative charges carried by the oxygen atom of each carbonyl group. By tracing the trajectories of K + permeation through the bi-layer nanopores, we find that each K + permeation event involves at least two potassium ions, exhibiting a dual-ion transport mechanism. Figure 2 a depicts the representative stages of a potassium ion passing through the nanopore. Based on the number of participating potassium ions, we divide the dual-ion transport into two sub-processes, termed \u2018K1 capture\u2019 (Fig. 2 a, Stages I\u2013III) and \u2018restricted knock-on by K2\u2019 (Fig. 2 a, Stages IV and V).\nFar from the graphene sheets, potassium ions move freely in the bulk solution (Fig. 2 a, Stage I). At this stage, there is hardly any interaction between the dissolved ions and the nanopore due to the large distance. Under an external electric field, a potassium ion (denoted as K1) gets close to the nanopore in L1 (termed as P1) and it is rapidly captured by P1 due to coulombic attraction (Fig. 2 a, Stage II). The binding affinity is \u223c6.0 kcal/mol according to the PMF (Fig. 2 b). Ion capture by the nanopore results in K + partial dehydration due to the small pore size and carbonyl substitution. The hydration number of the captured potassium ion falls from 7.3 to 3.1 ( Supplementary Fig. S7A), i.e. K + at P1 is hydrated by a single water molecule between the graphene layers and only two water molecules on the graphene surface.\nInstead of retreating back to bulk solution, K1 moves forward to the nanopore in L2 (termed as P2, Fig. 2 a, Stage III) driven by the external electric field. The energy barrier from Stages II to III is merely 3.5 kcal/mol, due to the strong interaction between K1 and the carbonyl groups, and it is also far lower than that for going back to the bulk\nFigure 2.

Once K1 resides in P2, it annot escape the nanopore by itself due to the high nergy barrier ( \u223c6.4 kcal/mol) between Stage III nd the bulk solution (Fig. 2 b). While K1 is trapped in Stage III, the vacant\n1 is capable of capturing another K + (denoted s K2), leading to a different energy state for K1 n P2 (Fig. 2 a, Stage IV). Although the incomng K2 encounters strong coulombic repulsion from 1, the capture of K2 by P1 is thermodynamially favorable. A negative free energy change of bout \u22121.6 kcal/mol is found in the dual-ion PMF Fig. 2 c), meaning that, with K1 at P2, the unoccuied P1 is sti l l attractive to potassium ions. Conceivbly, the intake of K2 is much slower in comparison ith that for K1 when the nanopore is free of potasium ions. The simulation results show that the oc-\nPage 4 of 10\ncupation of P1 by K2 takes almost > 70% of the total time for an individual ion permeation event (see the timeline in Fig. 2 a).\nWith two potassium ions occupied in the nanopores (Stage IV), the strong coulombic repulsion makes the dual-ion system highly unstable. The center-to-center distance between the two carbonylstabilized potassium ions is merely 3.9 A\u030a, rendering a direct electrostatic energy of \u223c85 kcal/mol. The strong repulsion lifts the free energy valley for K1 from \u22126.4 to \u22121.7 kcal/mol, thereby facilitating the rapid transition of K1 from Stages IV to V (Fig. 2 b and d). Via this dual-ion mechanism, K1 is knocked out of P2 within \u223c2.2 ns after the capture of K2 by P1 (Fig. 2 a, Stage V). The process is analogous to the soft knock-on mechanism in biological ion channels [ 10 ].\nt ( e c s f n p v N o (\nR T l o B e m b S a a\nk o t K\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nIn contrast to K + , Na + stops after being capured by P1, without going forward to the next layer Fig. 2 e, Stages I and II) due to a much larger free nergy barrier of 8.9 kcal/mol (Fig. 2 f). Instead, the aptured Na + is more likely to retreat back to bulk olution (Fig. 2 e, Stage III) because the retreating ree energy barrier is 2 kcal/mol lower than that eeded to jump from P1 to P2. The inability of Na + ermeation can also be attributed to its solvation enironment. The hydration number of the captured a + is sti l l > 3.0, suggesting that the four carbonyl xygens on P1 do not properly coordinate with Na + Supplementary Fig. S7B ) due to its small size.\nole of K\u2013n H 2 O\u2013K triplets he water molecules confined between the graphene ayers play an important role in the transport f potassium ions through the bi-layer nanopore. y tracing several hundreds of dual-ion transport vents, we find that the dual-ion configuration is ediated by one or two hydrate water molecules etween the two potassium ions (see e.g. Fig. 2 a, tage IV). The dual-ion PMF reveals that K1 and K2 re subject to a mutually attractive potential (Fig. 2 c nd d) due to the interlayer water molecules. We systematically investigate the structural and inetic behavior of the ion\u2013water\u2013ion triplets based n the number of hydrate water molecules between he two potassium ions, termed as K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K and \u20132H 2 O\u2013K, sepa rately. As shown in Fig. 3 a, K\u2013\nPage 5 of 10\nH 2 O\u2013K triplets are involved in 51.3% of all dualion transport events. Their mean lifetime is merely 300 ps, indicating a fast de-structuring process. The atomic trajectories show that a single water molecule exhibits a rapid switching between the two ions at a frequency of 578 GHz. Statistical results on the dipole direction show a normal distribution centered at \u223c90\u00b0 (Fig. 3 b), suggesting that the water molecule has no preferable affiliation with either K1 or K2. The solvation frustration [ 36 ], i.e. a single water molecule cannot solvate both potassium ions concurrently, makes the K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K triplet energetically unfavorable. In other words, the K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K triplets are prone to disintegration by knocking out K1 from P2.\nFigure 3 c shows representative atomic configurations for K\u20132H 2 O\u2013K triplets that are involved in the remaining 48.7% of the potassium permeation events. They hold a much longer mean lifetime of \u223c2074 ps in comparison with K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K. In addition, the mean electric energy of a K\u20132H 2 O\u2013K triplets is 9.2 kcal/mol lower than that of K\u2013H 2 O\u2013 K ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ). These results suggest that K\u20132H 2 O\u2013K is more stable than K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K. The atomic trajectories show that the two interlayer water molecules (termed w1 and w2) bind with the two potassium ions in a cooperative manner. Their dipole directions show a very close double peak distribution centered at \u223c40\u00b0 and \u223c120\u00b0 (Fig. 3 d), suggesting that each water molecule binds with only one K + at a time, i.e. when w1 is affiliated with K1, w2 is affiliated with K2, and vice versa. The K\u20132H 2 O\u2013K triplet is only a thermodynamically meta-stable state because w1 and w2 switch between the two potassium ions with a frequency of \u223c89.3 GHz. The twowater switching frequency is much lower than that of the single-water osci l lation in the case of K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K (578 GHz).\nInfluence of interlayer spacing The simulation results indicate that the interlayer distance has major effects on the permeability of K + . However, it has little influence on the transport of Na + because it is nearly impermeable regardless of the separation between the graphene layers. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the K + permeation rate drops remarkably as the interlayer distance ( d ) increases. A cut-offdistance can be identified at d \u22483.75 \u030aA, above which no K + permeation is observed. In contrast, no Na + permeation is found in the whole test range from 3.15 to 4.15 A\u030a.\nThe PMF calculated from MD simulation suggests that K + permeation encounters a much higher energy barrier as the interlayer distance increases (Fig. 4 b). In contrast to potassium transport, the\ne s d e c t a P i s n\nt p c w a g i c i c i t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nnergy barriers for Na + are much larger and less ensitive to the interlayer distance. At an interlayer istance of 3.75 A\u030a, K + and Na + encounter a similar nergy barrier of \u223c6.9 kcal/mol. Under such cirumstances, both K + and Na + cannot get through he nanopore. The atomic trajectories show that, t large interlayer distances, K + is unable to reach 2, i.e. the single-ion transport mode is impeded n the bi-layer nanopores (Fig. 4 c). In other words, uccessful ion permeation through an associative anopore must follow the dual-ion mechanism. To further understand how the interlayer dis-\nance affects K + permeability, we also analyse the ercentages and lifetimes of different K\u2013n H 2 O\u2013K omplexes. With a small interlayer distance of 3.15 \u030aA, e find that \u226470% of the K + permeations are medited by a K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K triplet, while the remaining are overned by a K\u20132H 2 O\u2013K triplet (Fig. 4 d). Interestngly, the percentage of K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K dramatically delines with increasing interlayer distance. This trend s explained by the fact that more water molecules an be accommodated between the two potassium ons in the bi-layer nanopore when the interlayer disance grows.\nPage 6 of 10\nAs discussed above, the K\u2013H 2 O\u2013K-mediated dual-ion transport is a fast process and the triplet complex has a short lifetime of several hundred picoseconds (Fig. 4 e). By contrast, the K\u20132H 2 O\u2013Kmediated transport is much slower and the complex has a much longer lifetime of > 20 0 0 ps. The difference is even more dramatic when the interlayer distance increases (Fig. 4 e). Based on the results of this and the above sections, we conclude that ion permeability through the bi-layer nanopores is determined by the relative content and kinetic properties of the K\u2013n H 2 O\u2013K triplets.\nA criterion for K + /Na + selectivity As suggested by the PMF profile (Fig. 2 b) and trajectory analysis of permeation events (Fig. 2 a), the free energy barrier ( G ) in the middle of the bi-layer nanopore is the rate-determining step for ion permeation. To further understand the origin of K + selectivity, we decompose the energy barrier into different contributions:\nG = G i on \u2212water + G carbonyl + G ion \u2212membrane . (1)\nIn Equation (1) , G ion \u2013water accounts for the free energy change due to water stripping; it is approximately proportional to the change in the hydration number ( N water ). G carbonyl represents the free energy change related to carbonyl substitution, i.e. the replacement of water by the carbonyl group in the solvation shell of the ion. G carbonyl is proportional to the change in the number of carbonyl groups in the ion solvation shell, N carbonyl . G ion \u2013membrane represents the contribution by bi-layer nanopores other than the carbonyl groups and it can be treated as a constant for both K + and Na + .\nWe regress G for each ion permeating through each bi-layer nanopore of A m A n ( m = 0 or 1; n = 0\u20133, Supplementary Fig. S9 ) as a function of N water and N carbonyl , which can be sampled from simulation trajectory. The regression gives the contribution by the carbonyl substitution as:\nG carbonyl ( K + ) = \u22122 . 55 \u00d7 N carbonyl < 0 , (2)\nG carbonyl ( Na + ) = +4 . 92 \u00d7 N carbonyl > 0 . (3)\nThe negative G carbonyl (K + ) indicates that the interaction between the nanopore and K + assists ion hopping from the first to the second layer. It\nFigure 5. Ionic power generation. (a) Schematic illustration of ionic power generation by mixing 1 M KCl and 1 M NaCl solutions through a K + -permselective membrane (KPM). Only potassium ions can penetrate KPM, thus the net diffusive ionic current is from the KCl reservoir to the NaCl reservoir. (b) Current\u2013voltage response with 1 M KCl and 1 M NaCl placed on the two sides (red). Evident non-zero intercepts are found on the two axes, suggesting net diffusive ionic current ( I diff ) and reversal potential ( U diff ). The gray area represents the net electrical power generated by the mixing process. As a control test, when equivalent molars of KCl solutions were placed on the two sides, the current\u2013voltage response almost goes through the origin (dark blue). (c) Free energy change ( G m ) with respect to the transferred amount of K + via a KPM (red) or via a non-selective membrane (termed free mix, dark blue). In the former case, spontaneous mix can only occur before reaching a critical \u03b4C 0 of 0.16 M. During this process, ON represents the extractable work with a KPM, while OP represents the work loss during free mix. The energy conversion efficiency is therefore defined as \u03b7 = ON/OP.\nc s t\nW e t\nI W g t n K o n a d t w r a d N t \u223c u ( t t i g \u223c C a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nompromises the positive G ion \u2013water due to the tripping of water molecules, leading to a relaively low energy barrier. In contrast, the positive G carbonyl (Na + ) is disadvantageous to ion hopping. hen it cooperates with G ion \u2013water , the total enrgy barrier is sufficiently large to stop Na + hopping o the next layer.\nonic power generation e further explore the possibility of ionic power eneration by mixing KCl and NaCl solutions hrough the potassium-permselective bi-layer anopores (Fig. 5 a). As shown in Fig. 5 b, with 1 M Cl and NaCl solutions placed on the two sides f a bi-layer nanopore membrane, respectively, on-zero intercepts are discovered on both current nd voltage axes, indicating the presence of a net iffusive ionic current ( I diff) and reversal potenial ( U diff). In contrast, once 1 M KCl solutions ere placed on both sides, the current\u2013voltage esponse almost goes through the origin (Fig. 5 b nd Supplementary Fig. S10 ). Interestingly, the irection of I diff is from the KCl reservoir to the aCl reservoir because only K + can go across he nanopore. The magnitude of U diff reaches 73.1 mV, which can be quantitatively predicted by sing a modified Goldman\u2013Hodgkin\u2013Katz theory Supplementary Text S11 ). This evidence suggests hat the permselective transport of K + converts he Gibbs free energy loss during mixing into the onic power. The simulation results indicate that the enerated power from a single bi-layer nanopore is 0.13 pW by mixing 1 M KCl and NaCl solutions. onsidering that the geometric pore size is < 1 nm, n ultra-high pore density of 10 16 pores/m 2 , for\nPage 7 of 10\nexample, can be readily obtained, i.e. only one subnanometer-wide pore exists in a graphene lattice of size 10 nm \u00d7 10 nm. By exploiting parallelization [ 37 ], the theoretical power density would reach up to > 10 0 0 W/m 2 under a low porosity of < 1%.\nThe potassium-permselectivity enabled osmotic power generation (PoPee-OPG) better mimics the way of energy conversion by the electrocyte cells of electric eels [ 38 ] and offers major advantages over existing salinity gradient power generation (SGPG) [ 39 , 40 ]. First, PoPee-OPG replaces charge selectivity in SGPG with potassium ion selectivity. K + goes through its exclusive permselective ionic channels. Second, PoPee-OPG eliminates the need for a lowconcentration ionic solution that is indispensable in SGPG. It is worth noting that there is actually no apparent low-concentration part in the body of electric eels due to the balance of osmotic pressure across cell membranes. This improvement is equivalent to largely reducing the internal resistance of an artificial ionic power source and thus enables high output power [ 41 ].\nEnergy conversion efficiency We establish a thermodynamic process to elucidate the energy conversion mechanism and estimate the efficiency [ 42 \u201344 ]. As schematically shown in Fig. 5 a, two reservoirs of volume 1 L containing KCl (left) and NaCl (right) solutions were separated by using a bi-layer nanopore membrane. Initially, their ionic concentrations were both 1 M. If the membrane is non-selective (free mixing, Fig. 5 c), the transfer of \u03b4C mol of K + to the right reservoir is unavoidably accompanied by a transfer of an equal amount of Na + in the reverse direction. This leaves\nt M M e s f\nb o 0 K t r c d o c K d\ns m t p o ( d \u03b4\nr a C S h fi o d i s\nC I a p i a K i i i s a p w f\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nhe left reservoir a mixture of (1- \u03b4C ) M KCl and \u03b4C NaCl, and the right reservoir a mixture of (1- \u03b4C ) NaCl and \u03b4C M KCl. The corresponding free enrgy change ( G m ) is a decaying function with repect to \u03b4C (Fig. 5 c), reflecting the spontaneity of ree mixing. With a K + -permselective membrane (KPM) in\netween, Na + cannot permeate. The concentration f NaCl in the left and right reservoirs remains at and 1 M, respectively. With a transfer of \u03b4C mol\n+ from the left to the right reservoir, the salt conent on the left is (1- \u03b4C ) M KCl and that on the ight is a mixture of 1 M NaCl and \u03b4C M KCl. The orresponding G m shows a nonmonotonic depenence on \u03b4C (Fig. 5 c), yet is always above the case f free mixing. Before reaching the minimum of this urve at a critical \u03b4C 0 of \u223c0.16 M, the diffusion of\n+ is spontaneous, as the free energy change keeps eclining. For any given \u03b4C \u2264 \u03b4C 0 in Fig. 5 c, ON repre-\nents the extractable energy with a KPM. At the terinus of the spontaneous process, the maximum exractable energy approaches 0.06 kJ/mol. For comarison, the work loss of transferring equal amounts f K + via a free mix process should be 0.16 kJ/mol OP). Then, the energy conversion efficiency can be efined as \u03b7 = ON / OP and corresponds to 37.5% at C = 0.16 M. The efficiency of PoPee-OPG can be compaable to some of the traditional fossil and renewble energy sources ( Supplementary Table S2 ). ompared with the ion-exchange-membrane-based GPG, PoPee-OPG is more suitable for working in igh-concentration environments. Although the efciency of PoPee-OPG may not be as high as that f SGPG ( Supplementary Table S2 ), the total power ensity of > 10 0 0 W/m 2 reported in this work is very mpressive among existing ionic energy conversion ystems [ 40 ].\nONCLUSION n summary, we propose a computational design of n artificial potassium channel with strict potassium ermselectivity. We find that twisted carbonyl modfication of a bi-layer graphene nanopore can achieve n extraordinarily high K + /Na + SR of 1295 and\n+ permeation rate of 3.5 \u00d7 10 7 ions/s, approachng the level of biological potassium channels. An nterlayer hydrate-water-molecule-mediated dualon transport mechanism is responsible for the trict potassium selectivity. More importantly, as proof-of-concept application of the potassiumermselective ionic channels, we propose a new ay for ionic power generation without the need or an ionic concentration difference on the two\nPage 8 of 10\nsides of the membrane, termed as potassiumpermselectivity enabled osmotic power generation. A very high power density of > 10 0 0 W/m 2 can be theoretically achieved merely with a low porosity of < 1%. The unique pore structure proposed in this work provides valuable insights for synthesizing, for example, bi-layer covalent-organic framework membranes with precisely designed ion binding sites that could lead to the development of high-performance electric-eel-mimetic energy devices [ 45 ].\nMETHODS\nMD simulations MD simulations were performed using NAMD 2.14 with a time step of 2 fs [ 46 ]. The interaction parameters were derived from a CHARMM 27 force field with TIP3P water [ 47 ]. The parameters for carbonyl groups were derived from glutamic acid. The cutoff length was 10 A\u030a. A particle mesh ewald method was employed to compute electrostatic interaction [ 48 ]. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed in all directions. The system was equilibrated in a NP x A y - z T ensemble with constant area in the y \u2013z plane and constant pressure of 1 atm. The temperature was 300 K with a Langevin damping thermostat. After equilibration, an NVT ensemble was used for the production run.\nIon permeability was calculated using nonequilibrium MD. The simulation box was 6.6 \u00d7 2.6 \u00d7 2.7 nm 3 ( Supplementary Fig. S1B ), containing 1484 water molecules, 15 K + (or Na + ) and 15 Cl \u2212. The salt concentration was \u223c0.5 M. An electric field of 10 mV/nm was applied along the x -direction. The sampling was run for 900 ns.\nPMF calculation PMFs were constructed with adaptive-biasing forces [ 49 ]. The sampling used seven uniform windows that were 3 A\u030a thick. The spring constant of the biasing force was 100 kcal/mol. To prevent ion bumping, a harmonic constraint of 500 kcal/mol was applied to confine ion movement in a cylinder with a radius of 5 \u030aA. A series of radii was tested to exclude possible artificial effects ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ). Dual-ion PMFs were constructed with one ion constrained in L2.\nTransition-state theory Due to the very low permeability, the transitionstate theory was used to estimate the permeation rate of Na + . Based on single-ion PMF [ 50 ], the rate-determining step is the ion hopping from L1 to\nL\nw \u03c4 v i t t w K\nI T s t t t 6 m c T m r T\nF W u E i s t L t T C\nS S\nF T d d I d\nA W s t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/12/nw ad260/7288669 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\n2.
