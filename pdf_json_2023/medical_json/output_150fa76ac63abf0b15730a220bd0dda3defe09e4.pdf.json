For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com\nPsoriasis is long-term condition that develops in the skin and joints. It affects approximately 2% of the Western population. Its main symptoms are itchy, scaly and sore skin. Psoriasis is associated with a large number of illnesses that occur in the same person at the same time (known as comorbidities), all of which can have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. For example, patients with psoriasis are also more likely to have Crohn disease. It is therefore important to understand the relationships between psoriasis and these other illnesses.\nIn this study, we used an algorithm to predict high-risk comorbidities in patients with psoriasis. Using a Danish nationwide healthcare database, we identified all comorbidities diagnosed within 5 years of a psoriasis diagnosis. We then identified each comorbidity that was strongly\nassociated with a psoriasis diagnosis. If a comorbidity was strongly associated with psoriasis, we named it a \u2018Diagnosed Pair\u2019. We then statistically tested which comorbidities had a strong likelihood of being diagnosed either before or after a psoriasis diagnosis. Next, we created a comorbidity trajectory network diagram that mapped out all the comorbidities likely to be diagnosed in the 5 years before or after a psoriasis diagnosis.\nFrom over 17,000 patients with psoriasis in the Danish database, 123 Diagnosed Pairs were identified. Nineteen of these 123 pairs were significantly likely to be diagnosed in the 5 years after a psoriasis diagnosis (including liver disease and osteoporosis) and four were significantly likely to be diagnosed before a psoriasis diagnosis (including Crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis).\nOur findings may help healthcare professionals to\u00a0 predict\u00a0 the likelihood of a patient developing a future\u00a0comorbidity, assist with the timing of screening for these illnesses and the planning of appropriate preventive treatments.\nLinked article: Rosen\u00f8 et al.
