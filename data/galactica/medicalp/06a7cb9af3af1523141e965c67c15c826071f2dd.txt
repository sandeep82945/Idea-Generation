In this case report, we present the rare occurrence of supernumerary extraocular muscles (SEOM) in a 35year-old male with hyperthyroidism. SEOMs are unusual anatomical variations involving extraocular muscles that deviate from the typical muscle arrangement in the eye. While SEOMs are rare, they can have diverse clinical manifestations, including restrictive strabismus and lid abnormalities. In this case, the patient displayed right-sided lid retraction and an asymmetrical palpebral aperture, which raised concerns about a potential association with thyroid eye disease. However, imaging revealed that the SEOM was anatomically connected to the superior rectus muscle, possibly contributing to the observed lid retraction. Understanding the complexities of SEOM and its potential interactions with conditions like thyroid ophthalmopathy is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. Categories: Endocrinology/Diabetes/Metabolism, Ophthalmology, Radiology conclusions In conclusion, this case report highlights a rare anatomical variation known as supernumerary extraocular muscles (SEOM), where anomalous extraocular muscles deviate from the normal muscle arrangement in the eye. While immediate intervention was not necessary for the SEOM, regular monitoring was advised to assess stability and detect any changes. Understanding potential associations between SEOM and conditions like thyroid ophthalmopathy and restrictive strabismus is crucial, as they may complicate diagnosis and management. This case report sheds light on the intriguing and diverse manifestations of SEOM within the eye, and how their presence can be associated with significant clinical implications, especially when coexisting with hyperthyroidism
