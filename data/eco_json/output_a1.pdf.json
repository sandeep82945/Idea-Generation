In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents\u2019 preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find results on the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms.",

            "text": "The facility location problem is a widely studied problem, with decades of literature spanning the fields of operations research, economics, and computer science. In the classic variant of the problem, agents are located on a unidimensional interval, and we are tasked with finding an ideal location to place a facility which serves these agents. The agents have single-peaked preferences for the facility location, as they incur a cost equal to their distance from the facility. This problem models many real-world single-peaked social choice and preference aggregation problems. The geographical placement of public facilities such as libraries and parks is an immediate example [15], and the problem can also be applied to choose a political or economic outcome [5, 8], or to decide how to divide a budget [9]. Furthermore, the one-dimensional setting can be generalized to a multi-dimensional setting with an L1 distance metric [19, 11], or extended to a network setting [22].\nIn our setting, we assume that the agents\u2019 locations are private information, and take a strategyproof mechanism design approach to the classic facility location problem. We also add an additional dimension of complexity: each agent\u2019s cost is scaled by an external factor corresponding to the facility\u2019s location on the domain. Specifically, there is a (continuous) scaling function which maps the facility location to a positive scaling factor which is multiplied by each agent\u2019s distance to calculate their individual costs. A local minimum of the scaling function implies that the facility is particularly effective when placed at this point. The primary motivation for our model is the placement of a cell-phone tower, which is most effective when it is on top of a hill, and less effective as it is placed lower on the hill. Each signal broadcasted or received by the radio tower has a failure probability depending on its elevation, and this averages out over time to be the facility\u2019s effectiveness in a multiplicative sense. Other examples include the proximity of the facility to a river or public transportation, or of a warehouse to a shipping port. Similarly, placing the facility at a local maximum is relatively ineffective (such as placing the cell phone tower at the bottom of a valley, or a public facility next to a garbage dump), and the scaling function improves up to an extent as the facility moves away from this point.\nIn our paper, we consider the general class of continuous scaling functions, as well as piecewise linear scaling functions due to their simplicity in modelling real-world problems, and because they can approximate more complex scaling functions. To demonstrate our model, consider the example in Figure 1, where there are two agents at 0 and one agent at 0.6, and the scaling function is 2\u22123y for y \u2264 0.5, and 3y\u22121 for y > 0.5. Under the classic model, the median and midpoint mechanisms are known to minimize total and maximum cost, respectively. In our example, they place the facility at 0 and 0.3 respectively, resulting in 0.6\u00d7 2 = 1.2 total cost and 0.33 maximum cost. However, placing the facility at the scaling function\u2019s minimum of 0.5 is optimal for both objectives, leading to 0.55 total cost and 0.25 maximum cost.\nThe goal of our paper is to design strategyproof mechanisms for our scaled facility location problem, that have ideal approximations of the optimal total or maximum cost. These two objectives are standard measures of efficiency and egalitarian fairness in facility location mechanism design [20]. A key consequence of the scaling function is that the agents\u2019 preferences may no longer be single-peaked, and thus we cannot immediately leverage existing characterizations of strategyproof mechanisms under single-peaked preferences (e.g., [16, 5]). We therefore consider the sufficient and necessary conditions on the scaling function such that the agents\u2019 preferences are single-peaked, and design reasonable strategyproof mechanisms for such scaling functions.\nContributions"

            "text": "The facility location problem can be interpreted as a special case of preference aggregation when agents have symmetric and single-peaked preferences over a continuous range of outcomes, in which there has been decades of research in strategyproof aggregation rules. For general preferences, the famous GibbardSatthertwaite theorem implies that a surjective and strategyproof rule must be dictatorial [10, 21]. This impossibility result vanishes when we consider the restricted domain of single-peaked preferences, in which there have been numerous characterizations of strategyproof rules. Most notably, under this restricted domain, Moulin [16]\u2019s seminal paper characterizes the space of strategyproof and anonymous rules as Phantom mechanisms which output the median of the agent locations and n + 1 constant \u2018Phantom\u2019 values. This characterization was later extended to the domain of symmetric and single-peaked preferences by Border and Jordan [5] and Masso\u0301 and Moreno De Barreda [14]. Other characterizations of strategyproof rules have been proposed for similar settings by [4, 17, 18, 12].\nThe paper most similar to our work considers the facility location model with entrance fees [13], in which agents incur, in addition to their distance from the facility, an additive cost which depends on the facility placement. In this model, the authors give strategyproof mechanisms and compute their approximation ratios with respect to the total and maximum cost objectives. The key difference with our model is that our agents experience a multiplicative scaling factor to their cost, whilst their agents experience an additional additive cost. Our work and [13] are inspired by the line of research on approximate mechanism design without money, initially proposed for the facility location problem by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [20]. In their paper, the authors compute the worst-case ratio between the performance of strategyproof mechanisms and welfare-optimal mechanisms. There have since been many papers applying this approach to variations of the facility location problem, such as when there are proportionally fair distance constraints [3], when facilities have capacity limits [2, 1], or when the facility is obnoxious (i.e., agents prefer to be far away from the facility) [7]. A recent survey of related work is given by Chan et al. [6]."

Although we consider the space of potentially non-anonymous mechanisms, we assume for simplicity that agent locations are ordered such that x1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 xn. This does not affect the nature of our results. A scaling function q : X \u2192 R>0 gives the effectiveness of a facility.\n2 We also assume that the scaling function is continuous. As we will show in Proposition 1, continuity of q is required for the optimal facility location to be well-defined.\nDenoting Q as the space of all scaling functions, facility location mechanism f : Q\u00d7Xn \u2192 X maps the agent location profile x = (x1, . . . , xn) to the location of a facility y. We define the cost incurred by agent i as its distance from the facility multiplied by the scaling factor: ci(q, y) := q(y)|y \u2212 xi|. Finally, we define the total cost of an instance as TC(q, y,x) := \u2211\ni ci(q, y) = q(y) \u2211\ni |y \u2212 xi|, and the maximum cost of an instance as MC(q, y,x) := maxi ci(q, y) = q(y)maxi |y \u2212 xi|. Respectively, we denote the optimal facility location which minimizes the total cost (resp. maximum cost) as y\u2217TC (resp. y \u2217 MC).\nIt is typically ideal for the mechanism output to be independent of the agents\u2019 labelling, so we are concerned with mechanisms that satisfy anonymity.\nDefinition 1.

We consider a bounded domain so that a single-peaked linear scaling function does not take negative values. 2 If there is a point y where q(y) = 0, then it is trivial to place the facility at that point.\nProposition 1. There exists a scaling function with a discontinuity and an agent location profile such that the optimal facility locations for total cost y\u2217TC and maximum cost y \u2217 MC are not well-defined.\nProof.

If q is a linear function, the optimal facility location for total cost y\u2217TC is either on one of the agents\u2019 locations, or the minimum value of q.\nProof. Since q is a linear function, it is of the form q(y) = ay + b, where a \u2208 R and b \u2208 R>0. If a = 0, then q(y) is constant, and thus the optimal facility location is on the median agent.3\nDue to symmetry, it suffices to consider the case where the scaling function is increasing, i.e., a > 0. From this assumption, we know that the optimal solution cannot lie to the right of xn.\nSince q is increasing with y, its minimum value is on y = 0. We denote x0 := 0, and we know the optimal solution y\u2217 is in the interval [x0, xn]. Suppose the optimal solution y\n\u2217 is in the interval [xn1 , xn1+1], where n1 \u2208 [0, n \u2212 1] denotes the number of agents on the left-hand side of y\n\u2217. Also, let n2 = n \u2212 n1 denote the number of agents on the right-hand side of y\u2217.\nRecall that the total cost corresponding to y\u2217, TC(q, y\u2217,x) is q(y\u2217) \u2211 i |y \u2217 \u2212 xi|. Considering the term\n\u2211\ni |y \u2217 \u2212 xi|, we have\nn \u2211\ni=1\n|y\u2217 \u2212 xi| =\nn1 \u2211\ni=1\n(y\u2217 \u2212 xi) +\nn \u2211\ni=n1+1\n(xi \u2212 y \u2217)\n= (n1 \u2212 n2)y \u2217 +\nn \u2211\ni=n1+1\nxi \u2212\nn1 \u2211\ni=1\nxi.\nWe remark that \u2211 i |y \u2217 \u2212 xi| can also be written as a linear function of y \u2217: \u2211 i |y \u2217 \u2212 xi| = a \u2032y\u2217 + m with a\u2032 := n1 \u2212 n2, and m :=\n\u2211n i=n1+1 xi \u2212 \u2211n1\ni=1 xi. We can therefore express the total cost as the following function of y\u2217.\nTC(q, y\u2217,x) = q(y\u2217) \u00b7 \u2211\ni\n|y\u2217 \u2212 xi|\n= (ay\u2217 + b)(a\u2032y\u2217 +m)\n= aa\u2032(y\u2217)2 + (am+ a\u2032b)y\u2217 + bm.\nNow we know that the total cost function can either be a linear function or a quadratic function of y\u2217, depending on whether a\u2032 = 0, a\u2032 < 0, or a\u2032 > 0 (recalling that a > 0). There are three cases: either the total cost function is a linear function (a\u2032 = 0), a quadratic function which opens downwards (a\u2032 < 0), or a quadratic function which opens upwards (a\u2032 > 0). For the first two cases, it is clear that the minimum value of the total cost function must lie on an endpoint of the interval [xn1 , xn1+1]. It remains to consider the last case (a\u2032 > 0), where the total cost function q(y\u2217) \u2211\ni |y \u2217 \u2212 xi| = aa \u2032y\u2217 + (am+ a\u2032b)y\u2217 + bm opens upwards. Consider the total cost function on the larger domain of R. Since a\u2032 = (n1 \u2212 n2) > 0, we know there exists z1 \u2208 R such that a\n\u2032z1 +m = 0. Also, since a > 0, there exists z2 \u2208 R such that q(z2) = 0. As a result, we see that the total cost function is equal to zero at either one or two points on R; we now show that both of these points lie to the left of xn1 .\n3 If there are an even number of agents, we break the tie in favour of the leftmost agent in the optimal interval.\nFor the term a\u2032y\u2217+m, we know that a\u2032z1+m = 0, and thus z1 = \u2212 m a\u2032 =\n\u2211n i=n1+1 xi\u2212 \u2211n1 i=1 xi\nn2\u2212n1 . Consider the\nnumerator \u2211n\ni=n1+1 xi \u2212 \u2211n1 i=1 xi. We know there are n2 agents between (xn1 , xn], implying \u2211n i=n1+1 xi >\nn2 \u00b7 xn1 . Similarly, we know there are n1 agents between [0, xn1 ], implying \u2211n1\ni=1 xi \u2264 n1 \u00b7 xn1 . Combining these inequalities gives us\nn \u2211\ni=n1+1\nxi \u2212\nn1 \u2211\ni=1\nxi > n2xn1 \u2212 n1xn1 > 0.\nAs we have assumed a\u2032 > 0, we know n2 \u2212 n1 < 0 and thus z1 = \u2211 n i=n1+1 xi\u2212 \u2211n1 i=1 xi\nn2\u2212n1 < xn1 .\nNow consider z2, which satisfies q(z2) = 0. Clearly, z2 < 0 as we must have q(y) > 0 for y \u2208 [0, 1] and a > 0, implying z2 < xn1 .\nSince z1, z2 < xn1 , the total cost function must be strictly increasing in [xn1 , xn1+1], so its minimum value must lie on xn1 , which is either an agent location or the minimum value of q.\nWe can generalise this result to continuous, piecewise linear scaling functions.\nTheorem 1. Let the scaling function q be a continuous, piecewise linear function. The facility location minimizing total cost y\u2217TC is either on one of the agents\u2019 locations or on a local minimum of q.\nProof. First, consider each line segment on q, which is represented by a linear function qj on the sub-domain [cj , dj ], where cj , dj \u2208 X . Let y \u2217 j := argminyj\u2208[cj,dj] TC(q, yj,x) denote the optimal facility placement on [cj , dj ], and ej := argminy\u2208{cj,dj} q(y) be the minimum point of q on [cj , dj ]. By Proposition 2, we must have y\u2217j \u2208 {ej, x1, . . . , xn}. Therefore, considering all of the qj functions, the optimal solution y\n\u2217 must lie at one of the agents\u2019 positions or at a local minimum of qj .\nCorollary 1. When q is a continuous, piecewise linear function with a constant number of local minima, the optimal facility location can be found in linear time by simply iterating over the agent locations and the local minima of the scaling function.\nAs we assume agent locations are private information, there is a concern that agents may misreport their locations to unfairly attain a better facility placement. It is therefore ideal to implement a strategyproof mechanism, which does not incentivize agents to lie about their locations.\nDefinition 2 (Strategyproofness). A mechanism f(\u00b7) is strategyproof if for every agent i \u2208 N , we have, for every scaling function q and agent locations x\u2032i, x\u2212i and xi,\nci(q, f(xi, x\u2212i)) \u2264 ci(q, f(x \u2032 i, x\u2212i)).\nHowever, we find that the optimal solution is not strategyproof.\nProposition 3. The optimal facility placement which minimizes total cost is not strategyproof, even if the scaling function is a linear function and there are only 3 agents.\nProof. Suppose the scaling function is q(y) = 1 \u2212 45y and the agent location profile is x = (0.3, 0.4, 0.7). The optimal facility placement is y = 0.4, which leads to a cost of 0.204 for agent x3. However if agent x3 misreports x\u20323 = 0.755, then the facility placement is instead y\n\u2032 = 1, which leads to a cost of 0.06. Hence the optimal facility placement is not strategyproof."

            "text": "We now consider the optimal facility location for maximum cost. It is well-known that in the classic setting, placing the facility at the midpoint of the leftmost and rightmost agents is optimal for maximum cost but not strategyproof [20]. This implies that y\u2217MC is not strategyproof in our setting. However, it is easily computable in constant time when q is a linear function, as there are only three possible solutions.\nProposition 4. If q is a linear function, the optimal facility location for maximum cost satisfies y\u2217MC \u2208 {0, x1+xn2 , 1}.\nProof. Suppose q is of the form q(y) = ay + b, and recall that the maximum cost of the instance is MC(q, y,x) = maxi ci(q, y) = maxi(ay + b)|y \u2212 xi|. Due to symmetry it suffices to consider a > 0.\nSince a > 0, we know that y\u2217MC /\u2208 (xn, 1], as such a facility placement has a strictly higher cost for all agents than a facility on xn. We also know that y \u2217 MC /\u2208 ( x1+xn 2 , xn]. This is because for every facility placement on this interval, there is a \u2018symmetric\u2019 facility placement y \u2208 [x1, x1+xn\n2 ) where the maximum (unscaled) distance is the same, but the scaling function value is lower. We therefore know that y\u2217MC \u2208 [0, x1+xn 2 ]. When the facility satisfies y \u2264 x1+xn2 , then we also know that agent n incurs the highest cost, as it has the highest unscaled distance from the facility.\nWe now know that if a > 0, the maximum cost is MC(q, y, x) = cn(q, y) = (ay + b)(xn \u2212 y), which is a quadratic function of y that opens downwards. Therefore the maximum cost is minimized when y = 0 or y = x1+xn\n2 . By symmetry, if a < 0, agent 1 incurs the maximum cost of MC(q, y, x) = c1(q, y) = (ay+ b)(y\u2212x1), which is minimized when y = 1 or y = x1+xn2 . We therefore have y \u2217 MC \u2208 {0, x1+xn 2 , 1}.\nWe can also similarly show that when computing y\u2217MC for continuous scaling functions, we only need to consider the optimal facility location with respect to the leftmost and rightmost agents.\nProposition 5. For continuous scaling functions, the optimal facility location for maximum cost satisfies\ny\u2217MC \u2208\n{\nargmin y\u2208[0,\nx1+xn 2 ]\ncn(q, y), argmin y\u2208[\nx1+xn 2 ,1]\nc1(q, y), x1 + xn\n2\n}\n.\nProof. If y \u2208 [0, x1+xn2 ], then agent n receives the highest cost in the instance, similar to the proof of Proposition 4. A symmetric argument shows that if y \u2208 [x1+xn2 , 1], then agent 1 receives the highest cost in the instance. Therefore y\u2217MC is either on the minimum value of cn(q, y) on y \u2208 [0, x1+xn 2 ], the minimum value of c1(q, y) on y \u2208 [ x1+xn 2 , 1], or on x1+xn 2 .\nWe next investigate whether there exist non-trivial strategyproof mechanisms for this setting."

            "heading": "5 Achieving Single-Peaked Preferences",
            "text": "When agents have single-peaked preferences along a real line domain, Moulin [16] characterized the set of anonymous and strategyproof mechanisms as phantom mechanisms, which place the facility at the median of the n agent locations and n+ 1 constant \u2018phantom\u2019 points.\nDefinition 3 (Phantom Mechanism). Given x and n+1 constant values 0 \u2264 p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 pn+1 \u2264 1, a phantom mechanism places the facility at med{x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn, p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pn+1}.\nHowever, we find that in our setting, phantom mechanisms are not necessarily strategyproof. Even the wellstudied median mechanism, a phantom mechanism with \u2308n+12 \u2309 phantoms at 0 and \u230a n+1 2 \u230b phantoms at 1, is not strategyproof.\nProposition 6. The median mechanism is not strategyproof.\nProof. Consider the agent location profile x = (0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and the scaling function q(y) =\n{\n6\u2212 10y, y \u2264 0.5,\n10y \u2212 4, y > 0.5.\nThe median mechanism places the facility at y = 0.7, and it leads to a cost of 0.6 for agent x3. However if the agent at x3 misreports to x \u2032 3 = 0.5, then the median facility placement will be 0.5, which leads to a lower cost of 0.4 for the agent at x3. Hence the median mechanism is not strategyproof.\nIn fact, if there are at least two unique phantom locations, the phantom mechanism is not strategyproof.\nTheorem 2. Every phantom mechanism with n+ 1 phantoms on at least two unique phantom locations is not strategyproof.\nProof. Suppose the n + 1 phantoms are located on k \u2208 {2, . . . , n + 1} unique points (a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ak). We consider an agent profile such that all the agents are in the interval [a1, a2]. Denoting the number of phantoms on a1 as n\n\u2217, the facility is placed on the (n + 1 \u2212 n\u2217)th agent under this profile. Now suppose the scaling function is\nq(y) =\n{\n3\u2212 a1+1a2+1 \u2212 4 a1+a2 y, y \u2208 [0, a1+a22 ],\n8 a2+1 y \u2212 5a1+3a2a2+1 , y \u2208 [ a1+a2 2 , 1].\nCase 1 (n + 1 \u2212 n\u2217 \u2208 {2, . . . , n}): With all agents located in [a1, a2], we also specifically let xn\u2212n\u2217 = a1, xn+1\u2212n\u2217 = 3a1+a2 4 , and xn+2\u2212n\u2217 = a1+a2 2 . In such case, the mechanism places the facility at xn+1\u2212n\u2217 , and the agent at xn\u2212n\u2217 incurs cost\nc(n\u2212n\u2217)(q, f(x)) = q( 3a1 + a2\n4 ) \u00b7 | 3a1 + a2 4 \u2212 a1|\n= (3\u2212 a1 + 1\na2 + 1 \u2212\n4 a1 + a2 \u00b7 3a1 + a2 4 )( a2 \u2212 a1 4 )\n= (1\u2212 1 2 ( a1 + 1 a2 + 1 + 2a1 a1 + a2 ))( a2 \u2212 a1 2 ) > (1\u2212 a1 + 1\na2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 2 ).\nThe last inequality is due to a1+a1a2+a1 < a1+1 a2+1 . If xn\u2212n\u2217 misreports to x \u2032 n\u2212n\u2217 = a1+a2 2 , then f(x \u2032) = a1+a22 , and their new cost becomes c(n\u2212n\u2217)(q, f(x \u2032)) = (1\u2212 a1+1a2+1 )( a2\u2212a1 2 ) < c(n\u2212n\u2217)(q, f(x)).\nCase 2 (n + 1 \u2212 n\u2217 = 1): Consider the agent location profile x where x1 = a1+3a2\n4 and xn = a2. Here,\nwe have f(x) = xn+1\u2212n\u2217 = x1 = a1+3a2\n4 . Therefore the cost for agent xn is\ncn(q, f(x)) = q( a1 + 3a2\n4 ) \u00b7 | a1 + 3a2 4 \u2212 a2|\n= ( 8 a2 + 1 \u00b7 a1 + 3a2 4 \u2212 5a1 + 3a2 a2 + 1 )| a1 + 3a2 4 \u2212 1| = ( 3a2 \u2212 3a1 a2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 4 ) = 3\n2 \u00b7 (1 \u2212\na1 + 1 a2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 2 )\n> (1\u2212 a1 + 1 a2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 2 ).\nHowever if xn misreports to x \u2032 n = a1+a2 2 , then f(x \u2032) = a1+a22 . Agent xn will then incur cost\ncn(q, f(x \u2032)) = q( a1 + a2 2 ) \u00b7 | a1 + a2 2 \u2212 a2|\n= ( 8 a2 + 1 \u00b7 a1 + a2 2 \u2212 5a1 + 3a2 a2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 2 ) = (1 \u2212 a1 + 1\na2 + 1 )( a2 \u2212 a1 2 )\n< cn(q, f(x)).\nTherefore, a phantom mechanism which does not place all phantoms at the same position is not strategyproof.\nFrom this theorem, we arrive at the following corollary. Note that the constant mechanism is equivalent to the phantom mechanism with all n+ 1 phantoms at the same location.\nCorollary 2. The constant mechanism (which places the facility at some constant c \u2208 X) is the only anonymous and strategyproof mechanism in our setting.\nThis is because the scaling function may cause the agent\u2019s preference to no longer be single-peaked. To show this, we first define each agent\u2019s utility as the negative of their cost (ui(q, y) := \u2212ci(q, y)), so that their preference (with respect to cost) is single-peaked if and only if their utility is single-peaked. We therefore use the terms \u2018utility functions\u2019 and \u2018preferences\u2019 interchangeably throughout the paper.\nTheorem 3. An agent\u2019s preference may not be single-peaked, even if the scaling function is a linear function.\nProof. Consider the scaling function q(y) = y + 0.01 and x1 = 0.5. The derivative of agent 1\u2019s utility is u\u20321(q, y) = 2y\u2212 0.49 when y < 0.5, and u \u2032 1(q, y) = \u2212(2y\u2212 0.49) when y > 0.5. For y \u2208 [0, 0.245], u \u2032 1(q, y) \u2264 0. For y \u2208 [0.245, 0.5], u\u2032 \u2265 0. Lastly, for y \u2208 [0.5, 1], u\u20321(q, y) < 0. Therefore u1(q, y) is not single-peaked.\nHowever, we can characterize the conditions on the scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. These conditions hold as long as q is continuous, even if it is not differentiable at a countable set of points D.\nTheorem 4. If q is continuous but not differentiable at a countable set of points D := {j|q\u2032(j) does not exist}, the agents\u2019 preferences are guaranteed to be single-peaked if and only if q(y)\u2212 |q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\D.\nProof. Recall that the utility function for agent xi is\nui(q, y) =\n{\nq(y)(y \u2212 xi), y \u2264 xi,\nq(y)(xi \u2212 y), y \u2265 xi.\nThe derivative of u with respect to y is\nu\u2032i(q, y) =\n\n \n \nq(y) + q\u2032(y)(y \u2212 xi), y \u2208 [0, xi)\\D,\nNot differentiable, y \u2208 D \u222a {xi}, \u2212(q(y) + q\u2032(y)(y \u2212 xi)), y \u2208 (xi, 1]\\D.\n( =\u21d2 ) The utility function is single-peaked, so for each agent i, there exists a value ki \u2208 (0, 1) such that u\u2032i(q, y) \u2265 0 with y \u2208 [0, ki), and u \u2032 i(q, y) \u2264 0 with y \u2208 (ki, 1]. Since agents receive zero cost when the facility is placed at their location, we know the utility function\u2019s \u2018peak\u2019 lies on their location, and therefore ki = xi. As a result, we have q(y) + q\u2032(y)(y \u2212 xi) \u2265 0 for y \u2208 [0, xi)\\D, and \u2212q(y) + q\n\u2032(y)(y \u2212 xi) \u2264 0 for y \u2208 (xi, 1]\\D. This can also be written as q(y) + q\n\u2032(y)(y \u2212 xi) \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\({xi} \u222a D). Having xi \u2208 [0, 1] implies that (y\u2212 xi) \u2208 [\u22121, 1], meaning that our condition is q(y)\u2212 |q\n\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\D. ( \u21d0= ) Suppose that a scaling function q satisfies q(y) \u2212 |q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\D. We know that for every agent xi, q(y) + q \u2032(y)(y\u2212 xi) \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\({xi} \u222aD). The utility function is increasing for y < xi, and decreasing for y > xi.\nBy using this theorem, we can characterize the conditions on linear scaling functions which result in agents having single-peaked preferences.\nCorollary 3. If q is a linear function of the form q(y) = ay + b, the agents\u2019 preferences are guaranteed to be single-peaked if and only if b \u2265 a for a > 0, and b \u2265 \u22122a for a < 0.\nWe also observe that a sufficiently large constant c can be added to any continuous scaling function to ensure that every agent has a single-peaked preference. This can be explained by the scaling function becoming \u2018closer\u2019 to a constant scaling function.\nWe can also apply Theorem 4 to piecewise linear scaling functions to characterize the conditions for agents to have single-peaked preferences.\nProposition 7. If q is a continuous piecewise linear function where each line segment is of the form qj(y) = ajy + bj, the agents\u2019 preferences are guaranteed to be single-peaked if and only if for each line segment, bj \u2265 \u22122aj when aj < 0, and bj \u2265 aj when aj > 0.\nProof. From Theorem 4, we know that if the q function is continuous but not differentiable at some set of points D, the utility function is single-peaked if and only if q(y) satisfies q(y)\u2212|q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\D. When aj < 0, the utility function is single-peaked if and only if ajy + bj + aj \u2265 0 \u21d2 bj \u2265 \u22122ajy, and when aj > 0, the utility function is single-peaked if and only if ajy+ bj \u2212 aj \u2265 0 \u21d2 bj \u2265 aj(y\u2212 1). Since y \u2208 [0, 1], these conditions become bj \u2265 \u22122aj and bj \u2265 aj , respectively."

The approximation ratio of a mechanism quantifies its worst-case performance for a specified objective function.\nDefinition 4 (Total Cost Approximation Ratio). Given a mechanism f , its total cost approximation ratio is\nmax q\u2208Q,x\u2208Xn\nTC(q, f(x),x) TC(q, y\u2217TC ,x) .\nThe maximum cost approximation ratio is similarly defined by replacing the total cost expressions TC(q, \u00b7,x) and y\u2217TC with the corresponding maximum cost expressions MC(q, \u00b7,x) and y \u2217 MC .\nWhile we have defined the approximation ratio for the general space of scaling functionsQ, we additionally prove approximation ratio bounds for more restricted classes of scaling functions, such as piecewise linear scaling functions, and scaling functions such that agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked preferences.\nFor simplicity of notation, we let rq := maxy\u2208X q(y) miny\u2208X q(y) be the ratio between the highest and lowest values of\nthe scaling function.\nWe begin with an impossibility result in the general continuous setting, which explains our need to restrict the scaling function parameters to ensure single-peakedness and widen the space of strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms.\nTheorem 5. Every strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has an unbounded approximation ratio for total and maximum cost.\nProof. By Moulin [16]\u2019s characterization, a strategyproof and anonymous mechanism in our setting must be a phantom mechanism, as the classic setting is a special case of our setting. By Theorem 2, we also know that a phantom mechanism is only strategyproof if all n+1 phantoms are located at the same location. Such a phantom mechanism is equivalent to the constant mechanism, which has an unbounded approximation ratio as it is not unanimous.\nAs we will show, our approximation ratio results are typically a function of rq. We show that when the scaling function is chosen such that agents have single-peaked preferences, the value of rq is upper bounded by a constant.\nTheorem 6. When agents\u2019 preferences are single-peaked, rq \u2264 e.\nProof. From Theorem 4, we know that q(y) \u2212 |q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\D, where D denotes the points where q(y) is not differentiable.\nFirst, consider the intervals where q\u2032(y) > 0, and consequently q satisfies q(y) \u2212 q\u2032(y) \u2265 0. We define a function g(y) := eyq(y), where g\u2032(y) = ey(q(y)\u2212q\u2032(y)). We know g(y) is non-decreasing because q(y)\u2212q\u2032(y) \u2265 0. Consider the points y1, y2 \u2208 [0, 1] where y1 < y2. Since g(y1) \u2264 g(y2), we know that e y1q(y1) \u2264 e y2q(y2). Also, since q(y) > 0 and ey > 0, we have q(y1)q(y2) \u2264 e y2\u2212y1 , which is maximized when y1 = 0 and y2 = 1. Therefore rq \u2264 e. Furthermore, the function q(y) = e y satisfies q(y)\u2212 |q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 and has rq = e.\nLastly, consider the intervals where q\u2032(y) < 0, and consequently q satisfies q(y) + q\u2032(y) \u2265 0. Similarly, we define g(y) := e\u2212yq(y), where g\u2032(y) = e\u2212y(q\u2032(y)\u2212q(y)). We know g(y) is non-increasing because q\u2032(y)\u2212q(y) \u2264 0. Consider the points y1, y2 \u2208 [0, 1] where y1 < y2. Since g(y1) \u2265 g(y2), we know that e \u2212y1q(y1) \u2265 e \u2212y2q(y2). Also, since q(y) > 0 and ey > 0, we have q(y2)q(y1) \u2264 e y2\u2212y1 , which is again maximized when y1 = 0 and y2 = 1. Therefore rq \u2264 e.\nWhen q is a piecewise linear function, the upper bound of rq is dependent on how many line segment pieces the function has.\nTheorem 7. Suppose the scaling function q is a piecewise linear function with k line segment pieces. When agents\u2019 preferences are single-peaked, rq \u2264 (1 + 1 k ) k.\nProof. Suppose for j \u2208 {1, . . . , k} that each line segment of q is denoted as qj(y) = ajy+bj. From Theorem 4, for agents to always have single-peaked preferences, we require that q(y)\u2212 |q\u2032(y)| \u2265 0 for all y \u2208 [0, 1]\\{D}, where {D} denotes the set of points where q(y) is not differentiable. This implies that for each line segment, if aj > 0, then ajy + bj \u2212 aj > 0 =\u21d2 bj \u2265 (1\u2212 y)aj . Similarly, if aj < 0, then bj \u2265 \u2212(1 + y)aj .\nWe denote the endpoints of the scaling function\u2019s line segment pieces as the set S = {0, s1, s2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sk\u22121, 1}. Consider a line segment piece qj = ajy + bj , where y \u2208 [sj\u22121, sj]. We now find an expression for rqj , which is the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the scaling function on [sj\u22121, sj ].\nIf aj > 0, then rqj = qj(sj)\nqj(sj\u22121) = ajsj+bj ajsj\u22121+bj . Since we require bj \u2265 (1\u2212 y)aj on y \u2208 [sj\u22121, sj ], we know that\nbj \u2265 (1 \u2212 sj\u22121)aj . Therefore rqj = ajsj+bj\najsj\u22121+bj \u2264 ajsj+(1\u2212sj\u22121)aj ajsj\u22121+(1\u2212sj\u22121)aj = (1 + sj \u2212 sj\u22121).\nIf aj < 0, then rqj = qj(sj\u22121) qj(sj) = ajsj\u22121+bj ajsj+bj . Since we require bj \u2265 \u2212(1 + y)aj on y \u2208 [sj\u22121, sj ], we know\nthat bj \u2265 \u2212(1 + sj)aj . Therefore rqj = ajsj\u22121+bj ajsj+bj \u2264 ajsj\u22121\u2212(1+sj)aj ajsj\u2212(1+sj)aj = (1 + sj \u2212 sj\u22121), and we know that for each qj , rqj \u2264 (1 + sj \u2212 sj\u22121). Since q is piecewise linear, its global maxima and minima must be elements of S. We take an arbitrary global minimum smin := argminy\u2208X] q(y) and global maximum smax := argmaxy\u2208X q(y), where smin, smax \u2208 S, and suppose w.l.o.g. that smin < smax. It also suffices to assume that for each line segment qj between smin and smax, we have aj > 0 (i.e. the function is strictly increasing in [smin, smax]). This means that rq is the product of the rqj between smin and smax. Finally, since 1 \u2264 rqj \u2264 (1 + sj \u2212 sj\u22121), and applying the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, we have rq \u2264 k \u220f\ni=1\n(1 + si \u2212 si\u22121) \u2264 (1 + 1 k ) k.\nWhen the amount of line segments k approaches infinity, the upper bound of rq asymptotically meets the upper bound of rq = e for general scaling functions. Intuitively, this can also be seen by constructing a piecewise linear function which approximates the function q(y) = ey.\nWe follow up with another result which restricts the space of phantom mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio.\nLemma 1. A phantom mechanism which does not place at least one phantom on 0 and 1 has an unbounded approximation ratio for total cost and maximum cost.\nProof. Due to symmetry it suffices to consider phantom mechanisms which do not have any phantoms on 1. If all agents are located at 1, the optimal total and maximum cost are 0, but such a phantom mechanism must place the facility at a location strictly left of 1, as all n + 1 phantoms are strictly left of 1. Therefore the total cost and maximum cost approximation ratios are unbounded.\nThis lemma shows that when proving the approximation results, it suffices to consider phantom mechanisms where p1 = 0 and pn+1 = 1. Such a phantom mechanism is equivalent to a phantom mechanism with only n \u2212 1 phantoms, and is known to characterize the strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms which place the facility between the leftmost and rightmost agent locations [16]."

            "text": "We now prove approximation ratio results for the objective of total cost, a standard utilitarian measure of efficiency. We begin by giving a lower bound on the approximation ratio achievable by a phantom mechanism, with a proof which applies to both continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions.\nTheorem 8. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, any phantom mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least rq.\nProof. We consider two cases: either all phantoms are located at 0 or 1, or there is at least one phantom that is not located at 0 or 1. We start with the former case, where the facility is located at some agent. For every such phantom mechanism, we can always construct an instance where the scaling function is highest at the agent that receives the facility, so the corresponding total cost must be at least maxy q(y) \u2211\ni |fmed(x)\u2212 xi|, where fmed is the median mechanism. Now suppose that the instance has an even number of agents, with xn/2 6= xn/2+1, and that the scaling function is lowest at (xn/2 +xn/2+1)/2. Placing the facility at this point\nresults in the optimal total cost of miny q(y) \u2211\ni |fmed(x)\u2212 xi|, and thus the total cost approximation ratio must be at least rq in this case.\nNow consider the case where at least one phantom is located in (0, 1). By Lemma 1, it suffices to consider phantom mechanisms with at least one phantom at 0 and 1, so we are interested in where the remaining n \u2212 1 phantoms are placed. We show that for every phantom mechanism f where at least one phantom pj on (0, 1) is not at the lowest point of the scaling function, there exists a phantom mechanism f \u2032 that places the n\u2212 1 phantoms at the lowest point of the scaling function and has a strictly lower approximation ratio. Specifically, if the scaling function has multiple global minima, the phantoms are placed at the leftmost global minimum on (0, 1). If the scaling function only has global minima on 0 and/or 1, then for sufficiently small \u01eb > 0, f \u2032 places the phantoms at \u01eb or 1\u2212 \u01eb. For every agent location profile x such that f(x) = pj , we claim there exists another profile x\u2032 where, under f \u2032, the total cost ratio with the optimal total cost is strictly lower. We derive x\u2032 from x by first moving each agent closer to f(x) = pj by a sufficiently small constant factor c > 0 (so that each agent i\u2019s distance changes from |xi \u2212 pj | to c|xi \u2212 pj |), and then translating the profile such that the facility is co-located4 with the n\u2212 1 phantoms of f \u2032 and the relative distances between the agents and the facility is the same but multiplied by the sufficiently small constant factor. The distances are still c|xi\u2212pj |, so the ratio of total unscaled distances is still the same. But now the facility is placed at a point where the scaling function value is strictly lower, so the total cost ratio is lower. Therefore f \u2032 has the lowest approximation ratio of all phantom mechanisms which have at least one phantom on (0, 1).\nWe now show that f \u2032 has an approximation ratio of at least rq. We define a scaling function q which has a unique global minimum at some point c1 \u2208 (0, 1), a unique global maximum at c2 > c1, and a point c3 > c2 where q(c3) = q(c1) + \u01eb, for sufficiently small \u01eb > 0. Consider a location profile where x1 = c2 < x2 = x3 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = xn = c3. The mechanism f\n\u2032 places the facility at x1, resulting in a total cost of (n\u2212 1)(xn \u2212 x1)maxy q(y), whilst the optimal total cost is at most (xn \u2212 x1)(miny q(y) + \u01eb) by placing the facility at c3. Therefore f\n\u2032 has an approximation ratio of at least rq. By exhaustion of cases, we see that any phantom mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least rq.\nFrom this result, we can also easily see that among all of the phantom mechanisms, placing the facility at the median agent gives the best possible approximation ratio for total cost.\nTheorem 9. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, the median mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of rq.\nProof. The median mechanismminimizes the sum of distances, so its total cost is at most maxy q(y) \u2211\ni |fmed(x)\u2212 xi|, whilst the optimal total cost is at least miny q(y) \u2211\ni |fmed(x)\u2212 xi|. This shows the approximation ratio is at most rq, and we have a matching lower bound from Theorem 8.\nRecall that phantom mechanisms characterize all strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms when agents have single-peaked preferences. We can consider scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences, and use Theorems 6 and 7 to find the specific total cost approximation ratio lower bounds for any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism.\nCorollary 4. For continuous scaling functions, when agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked preferences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least e.\nCorollary 5. For piecewise linear scaling functions with k line segments, when agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked preferences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least (1 + 1k ) k.\nAgain, the median mechanism would also give the best total cost approximation ratio, and can be suitably implemented for these restricted sets of scaling functions. However, in a scenario where the scaling function does not guarantee single-peaked agent preferences, phantom mechanisms no longer guarantee strategyproofness, and a constant mechanism has an unbounded approximation ratio. The dictator mechanism, which selects a specific agent to be the dictator and places the facility at their reported location, is known to be strategyproof for general agent preferences (though it is clearly not anonymous). We show that this mechanism has a bounded approximation ratio for total cost.\n4 This occurs as long as there are agents on both sides of the phantoms. Since the phantoms are placed at \u01eb and 1\u2212 \u01eb instead of 0 and 1, there is space on both sides of the phantoms.\nProposition 8. The dictator mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of (n\u2212 1)rq.\nProof. Suppose there are n\u2212 1 agents at the same location away from the dictator. Also suppose that the scaling function is highest at the dictator\u2019s location, and lowest at the other n\u22121 agents\u2019 location. The total cost approximation ratio is therefore at least (n\u22121)rq. To see that the approximation ratio cannot be higher than this, note that the total cost corresponding to the dictator mechanism is at most d(n\u2212 1)maxy\u2208X q(y) where d \u2208 (0, 1], as the dictator receives 0 cost, and the optimal total cost is at least dminy\u2208X q(y) when not all agents are at the same point."

We begin by giving the maximum cost approximation ratio of any phantom mechanism with p1 = 0 and pn+1 = 1, and again the proof applies to both continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions.\nTheorem 10. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, any phantom mechanism with p1 = 0 and pn+1 = 1 has a maximum cost approximation ratio of 2rq.\nProof. We first prove that for every phantom mechanism f with p1 = 0 and pn+1 = 1, there exists an agent profile where the facility is placed at either x1 or xn. Due to symmetry, it suffices to consider the former case, where we require that p2 < 1 and x1 = x2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = xn\u22121 > p2. Consider such an agent location profile where the facility is placed at x1 and x1 6= xn, and also consider a scaling function which has a global maximum at x1 and a global minimum at x1+xn 2 . We have MC(q, f(x),x) = (xn \u2212 x1)maxy\u2208X q(y) and MC(q, y\u2217MC ,x) = xn\u2212x1 2 miny\u2208X q(y), giving MC(q,f(x),x) MC(q,y\u2217\nMC ,x) = 2rq.

This problem applies to many real-world scenarios where the facility\u2019s effectiveness depends on external factors influencing its location. Our results focus on the objectives of total cost and maximum cost, and on both continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions.\nAlthough we focus on single-peaked agent preferences and have some mechanism design results for general agent preferences, the agent preferences in our setting are a strict subspace of general preferences, taking the form where the metric distance is multiplied by some continuous scaling function. An open question is to characterize the deterministic mechanisms satisfying strategyproofness and surjectivity under these preferences, which we conjecture to be dictatorships.\nThere are many natural extensions to our paper. We can consider multiple facilities and multiple dimensions, as well as randomized mechanisms. We could also restrict further the space of piecewise linear scaling functions to single-dipped or single-peaked linear scaling functions, and find even lower approximation ratio bounds.
