    "abstractText": "The quality of encryption is dependent on the complexity of the confusion-diffusion pattern and the quality of the keystream employed. To enhance complexity and randomness, this study proposes a combination of multiple interleaved patterns, including Zigzag, Hilbert, and Morton patterns to complicate the confusion-diffusion. The keystream is generated from the improved logistic map and the 6D hyperchaotic map, which complement each other due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and control parameters. This produces highly random and nonlinear keystreams, making them difficult to predict. The encryption process consists of four phases, alternating between diffusion and confusion. Furthermore, SHA512 is used to enhance key space and sensitivity. Based on the test results, the proposed encryption technique can withstand various attacks, such as statistics, differential, brute force, and NIST randomness tests, as well as data loss and noise attacks. Most of the results are better than previous studies. INDEX TERMS 6D Hyperchaotic System; Image Encryption; Improved Logistic Map; Multi-Interleaved Encryption; Novel Confusion-Diffusion Pattern",

To enhance complexity and randomness, this study proposes a combination of multiple interleaved patterns, including Zigzag, Hilbert, and Morton patterns to complicate the confusion-diffusion. The keystream is generated from the improved logistic map and the 6D hyperchaotic map, which complement each other due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and control parameters. This produces highly random and nonlinear keystreams, making them difficult to predict. The encryption process consists of four phases, alternating between diffusion and confusion. Furthermore, SHA512 is used to enhance key space and sensitivity. Based on the test results, the proposed encryption technique can withstand various attacks, such as statistics, differential, brute force, and NIST randomness tests, as well as data loss and noise attacks. Most of the results are better than previous studies.\nINDEX TERMS 6D Hyperchaotic System; Image Encryption; Improved Logistic Map; Multi-Interleaved Encryption; Novel Confusion-Diffusion Pattern\nI. INTRODUCTION Image encryption secures images by applying cryptography techniques to prevent unauthorized access and maintain information confidentiality. In the increasingly advanced digital world, data security becomes more important, especially when the data contains confidential or important information[1]\u2013[3]. Images are a type of data often used and shared online, making image encryption increasingly important. Images have several intrinsic characteristics, such as high redundancy, large volume, and high correlation between adjacent pixels, that must be considered when performing the encryption process.[4]\u2013[6]. So the image encryption should be specifically designed to suit the characteristics of the image better.\nChaos-based encryption has become a popular method in image encryption due to the unique characteristics of chaos systems. The primary reasons for using chaos are its certain properties, such as apparent randomness, non-linearity, aperiodicity, ergodicity, and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and control parameters[7]\u2013[9]. Based on Shannon's confusion and diffusion, traditional cryptographic\ntheory can also be associated with the intrinsic characteristics of chaotic systems, making chaotic maps a suitable choice for designing encryption systems on images[10]\u2013[13]. In fact, from a modern cryptographic perspective, only a few of these algorithms are insecure and have been broken in cryptanalysis[14]. However, not all of the latest image encryption methods are fully analyzed and comprehensively evaluated for cryptanalysis attacks [15], [16]. Although chaotic systems offer many benefits for image encryption, the security of chaotic image encryption algorithms can be compromised due to flawed algorithm designs [17]. Then the algorithm must be designed with a comprehensive analysis of security weaknesses. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the one-to-one relationship between the secret key and the chaotic system parameters and adopt an iterative structure or a combination of different encryption operations[15].\nChaos-based encryption has significantly developed from more superficial complexity, such as 1-Dimensional (1-D) or 2-D chaotic systems, to higher complexity, such as hyperchaotic systems in 3-D, 4-D, 5-D, 6-D, and even 7-D.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Traditional hyperchaotic systems generally have 3D; the widely applied ones are Lorentz, Chen, Lu, Rossler, etc. Meanwhile, hyperchaotic systems with higher dimensions can be developed by combining or modifying several chaotic system methods. Each chaos method has unique characteristics in terms of stability, a number of fixed points, frequency and speed of convergence to the steady state level, bifurcation, and resulting fractal structure[23]\u2013[26].\nBifurcation and Lyapunov exponent (LE) are important characteristics in designing chaotic systems. Bifurcation refers to the change in a dynamic system's orbit structure, while LE measures the system's sensitivity to initial conditions and determines its chaos level. LE values can be positive, negative, or close to zero, indicating the system's stability or instability[27], [28]. The LE values can be positive, negative, or close to zero. Negative values indicate a stable system and positive values indicate an unstable system, and values close to zero indicate the boundary between stability and instability. Stable systems can be used for encryption that is difficult to predict, while unstable systems generate encryption keys that are sensitive to initial conditions[23]\u2013[25]. The hyperchaotic system was defined as employing at least two positive LEs, one zero LE, and the rest of is negative LEs[29]. Yang et. al [30] proposed new hyperchaotic 6D system which has four positive LE, one zero LE, and one negative LE. With most LE positives, the method's sensitivity is very high towards the initial state. So that hyperchaotic is implemented in this paper.\nWhen implemented in the image encryption method, the excellent hyperchaotic quality must also be supported by good diffusion and confusion quality. To achieve the confusion property, the plain image pixels' positions and values are randomly altered under the supervision of a secret key. Additionally, the diffusion property is manifested by a single-pixel position alteration being capable of producing significant changes in the cipher image[20]. The previous studies attempted to improve the quality of encryption by creating combinations and variations of confusion and diffusion operations. Confusion and diffusion in image encryption are performed at least at the pixel level[31]\u2013[33]. Still, they can also be combined at the bit-level and pixel level [5], [8], [34]\u2013[36], usually done on row and column images. Other techniques used include bit-plane expansion both horizontally and vertically[37], cyclic shift technique[18], [38], [39], multi-directional pada column, row, and diagonal [40], [41], plane-level permutation[42], 3D bit-plane[43], etc. The diffusion and confusion methods applied to grayscale images are generally applied to RGB colour images with repetition techniques. The interleaved colour channel method can be used in encryption methods explicitly designed for colour images to improve encryption\nquality. This technique can mix the three channels evenly before the diffusion and confusion operations are performed. Another hypothesis that can be concluded is that combining or modifying patterns will increase the complexity and security of image encryption. Based on the literature above, this research has contributions and objectives to:\n1. The design combined interleaved patterns for diffusion\nand confusion based on Zigzag, Hilbert, and Morton.\n2. Combine a 6D hyperchaotic system and a 1D chaotic\nsystem to improve security.\n3. The encryption method is designed alternately with\nconfusion and diffusion patterns in four phases, done at the pixel and bit levels. 4. It uses dual SHA-512 hash functions to increase both\nkeys and plaintext sensitivity.\nThe remaining manuscript is organized into four parts: section 2, which contains preliminaries that explain related work theoretical literature, and ideas for modifying the method. Section 3 includes a detailed explanation of the stages of the proposed method. Section 4 is Results and Analysis, which presents the dataset, test results, and analysis. Finally, section 5 is the conclusion of the objectives, results, and analysis."

A hyperchaotic system must have a minimum of two positive exponents Lyapunov numbers and one zero value to ensure the diversity and complexity of its dynamics [29]. A hyperchaotic system must exhibit extensive and complex bifurcations when the system parameters change to exhibit highly random behavior. A hyperchaotic system cannot have a stable balance point, so the system can exhibit random and unpredictable behavior.\nSome popular hyperchaotic in digital image encryption are Lorenz, Chen, L\u00fc, R\u00f6ssler and Chua hyperchaotic. Initially, hyperchaotic was constructed with three to four dimensions. In its development, more recent research tries to develop hyperchaotic systems with higher dimensions to increase security and complexity in digital image encryption.

A logistic map is simpler than a hyperchaotic system because it is only a one-dimensional chaotic system. A logistic map can be calculated using Eq.

In the Logistic Map equation, the dynamic system moves towards a stable state when the growth parameter value is low. However, when the growth parameter value is increased, the dynamic system can experience bifurcation and change to a more complex state, such as periodic oscillation or chaos. Every time the growth parameter value passes through a bifurcation point, the number of peak points on the diagram doubles, indicating a sharp change in the system behavior. The higher the growth parameter value, the more complex the system behavior; the system can become highly chaotic at a certain point. Therefore, the bifurcation property in the Logistic Map equation shows that the dynamic system can experience a sharp change in its behavior when the growth parameter value exceeds certain critical values, see Fig. 4(a). This is also confirmed by the LE spectrum shown in Fig. 5(a), where there is a dynamic change in the LE value from zero, negative, and positive. Positive values indicate the tendency of the system to become chaotic, while negative values indicate the tendency of the system to converge to a fixed point. The LE value is zero, meaning the dynamic system is at a critical point between stable and chaotic behavior[47]. This makes the value of \ud835\udc5f in the Logistic Map equation greatly affect the properties of the resulting chaotic sequence.\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1 = 2\ud835\udc5f \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b 2/\ud835\udc5f\n(3)\n(a)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The bifurcation diagram plot of ILM in Fig. 4(b) and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum shown in Fig. 5(b) indicate chaotic phenomena and relatively constant Lyapunov exponents as the value of \ud835\udc5f changes. All LE values are positive, making the ILM highly sensitive to initial conditions and capable of increasing key variations. Note that the highest LE value in the logistic map is 0.663463317703722, while in the ILM, it is 3.588305270397140, indicating that the ILM method is designed to be more sensitive to changes in the initial value of \ud835\udc65."

In the first stage, linear scanning is carried out to form an interleaved array for the confusion process to be carried out with swap permutations based on the chaotic sequence order. In the second, third, and fourth stages, diffusion is carried out with a bit-wise XOR operation followed by a swap operation based on a chaotic sequence order. The bit-wise operation is carried out so that diffusion is carried out at the bit-level while the confusing stage is carried out at the pixel-level, where the diffusion and confuse processes are carried out alternately to increase the randomness. Three different interleave scan patterns are also proposed, namely Zigzag, Hilbert, and Morton, so the effects of diffusion and confusion are more scattered and complicate randomization, which impacts increasing security.

INFORMATION ENTROPY ANALYSIS Entropy analysis is a statistical analysis technique used to understand how random or non-random a given data or signal is. In image encryption, entropy analysis can be used to determine how effective encryption is in scrambling the image. Entropy in image encryption is measured from zero to eight because an image can be considered a discrete data source with 256 possible pixel values (0-255)[55]. Therefore, if each pixel value has an equal probability, the maximum entropy is the log base 2 of 256, equivalent to eight.\n\ud835\udc3b = \u2211 \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udcb8\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc542 ( 1\n\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udcb8\ud835\udc56) )\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1\n(8)\nEq.

            "text": "The correlation coefficient of adjacent pixels (\ud835\udc5f) in image encryption is a method used to measure the level of dependence between adjacent pixels in an image. This is important in image encryption because if there is a high dependence between pixels, the image can be easily predicted and vulnerable to attacks, especially statistical attacks[56]. The range of the r value is from minus one to one. A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation between two pixels, a value of zero indicates no correlation between two pixels, and a value of one indicates a perfect positive correlation between two pixels. The \ud835\udc5f value in plain images generally deviates from zero, while it should close to zero after encryption. Eq. (9) is used to assess the \ud835\udc5f value.\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66 =\n1 \ud835\udc41 \u2211 [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc65)][\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc66)] \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1\n\u221a1 \ud835\udc41 \u2211 [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc65)] 2\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 \u221a1 \ud835\udc41 \u2211 [\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc66)] 2\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1\n(9)\nThe symbol \ud835\udc41 in Eq.

Fig. 7 illustrates the correlation coefficient plot of 10,000 pairs of pixels for each direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and each channel of both plain and encrypted images.

            "text": "Keyspace refers to the range of all possible encryption keys used in a particular encryption system. In image encryption analysis, key space is crucial because the larger the keyspace, the more difficult it is to guess the correct encryption key. In a good encryption system, the keyspace should be large enough to make brute-force attacks impractical. In the [59], [60] studies, it was stated that at least 2100 is required to make brute-force attacks impractical. The proposed method uses several initial value parameters that can be dynamically set and hash functions to increase the keyspace. A detailed calculation of the keyspace is presented in Table 12.\nThe data presented in Table 12 shows that the possible key space in this method is approximately \u2248 2512 + 7 \u00d7 1016, this should confirm that the proposed method resists bruteforce attacks. The sensitivity key test on image encryption is a test to examine how sensitive the image encryption is to changes in the encryption key. In image encryption, the original image is transformed into an encrypted image using an encryption key. In the key sensitivity test, variations are made to the encryption key to observe its influence on the resulting encrypted image. The key sensitivity test is important to maintain the security of the encrypted image from attacks if the encryption key is leaked or accessed by unauthorized parties. The difference between the encrypted image with the original key and the modified key is used to determine the sensitivity of the key in image encryption. The sensitivity test in this research was conducted by modifying a 1-bit key in the decryption process. In Fig. 8, it is visually clear that the encrypted result is significantly different. This is due to the dynamic key parameters and chaotic sequence being highly sensitive to changes, combined with the SHA512 function, resulting in a compounded effect on key sensitivity.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In image encryption, the NIST randomness test function ensures that the keys used in the image encryption process are random and unpredictable[61]. The suite of tests (SP 800-22) is available for download at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bitgeneration/documentation-and-software. It comprises 15 tests designed to analyze random bit sequences' behavior. A pvalue in the range of [0...1] is generated for each test. To validate the encryption and pass the test, each test requires a minimum of 106-bit sequences that produce a p-value greater than 0.01[56]. The image is first converted into a binary file to conduct the test and saved with a .dat extension. Table 13 displays the test results, including the average p-value of all encrypted images. The NIST statistical test results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully passes all tests and is resilient to various types of attacks.\nTABLE XIII NIST STATISTICAL TEST SUITE RESULTS\nNo Test Name p-Value Note 1 Frequency 0.753319 Passed 2 Block Frequency 0.612014 Passed 3 a Cumulative Sums (Forward) 0.544545 Passed 3 b Cumulative Sums (Reverse) 0.772219 Passed 4 Runs 0.890363 Passed 5 Longest Run of Ones 0.779176 Passed 6 Rank 0.690237 Passed 7 Discrete Fourier Transform 0.721648 Passed 8 Nonperiodic Template\nMatchings\n0.791120 Passed\n9 Overlapping Template Matchings\n0.861762 Passed\n10 Universal Statistical 0.432321 Passed 11 Approximate Entropy 0.360523 Passed 12 Random Excursions 0.869847 Passed 13 Random Excursions Variant 0.646304 Passed 14 Serial 0.559851 Passed 15 Linear Complexity 0.873263 Passed\nAverage 0.697407\nPassed"

            "text": "Image encryption is the process of converting the original image into an encrypted image that cannot be read by people who do not have the encryption key. However, when encrypted images are transmitted, they can be vulnerable to data loss and noise attacks. Data loss attacks occur when some of the data in encrypted images is lost due to transmission or storage errors. This can cause the encrypted image to become unreadable or even corrupt. Meanwhile, noise attacks occur when data in encrypted images are corrupted with additional unwanted data, such as noise or wrong signals. This can cause encrypted images to become unreadable or difficult to read.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Suppose the encrypted image can withstand the attack. In that case, it means that the encrypted image has a better level of security and can be considered for use in more sensitive security applications. In this section, a sample of the results of a data loss attack is presented with a loss of 100 \u00d7 100, 2 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100, and 50 \u00d7 256 pixels. This is equivalent to data loss of \u2248 15.26%, \u2248 30.52%, and \u2248 19.53%, respectively. At the same time, the noise test is tested using a salt and pepper attack with a density of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, which are presented in Fig. 9. If measured by PSNR, the decrypted image is no more than 20dB, but visually, it appears that the image decryption results can still be recognized as the original image even though there is noise. In addition, even though in the data loss test, the loss is concentrated in certain parts of the data, the results of the decryption data loss spread evenly throughout the image. This makes the proposed encryption method resistant to data loss and noise attacks."

            "text": "In some image encryption research[20], [62], several image features such as energy, homogeneity, and contrast can indicate encryption quality. A lower energy value in the cipher indicates higher interference from the cipher image. In other words, it can mean better encryption quality. Contrast analysis can be used to evaluate the difference in intensity between pixels and their neighbors in the whole image. A higher contrast value indicates a more uneven texture, so it can be interpreted that the quality of the image encryption is better in this case. Meanwhile, homogeneity analysis is used to measure the closeness of the distribution on the gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). Thus the cipher image that has a lower homogeneity value generally has higher security. Energy, contrast, and homogeneity can each be calculated by Eq. (14), (15), and (16).\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66 = \u2211 \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57)2\n\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n(14)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 = \u2211|\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc57|2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57)\n\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n(15)\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 = \u2211 \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57)\n1 + |\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc57| \ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\n(16)\nWhere \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57) represents the number of GLCM, in this study, the three features are measured at each layer (red, green, and blue), because GLCM is generally calculated on grayscale images or 8 bits images. The measurement results for these three features are presented in Table 14.\nTABLE XIV AVERAGE ENERGY, CONTRAST, AND HOMOGENEITY ANALYSIS RESULTS OF ENCRYPTED IMAGE\nFeature Red Green Blue Average\nContrast 10.6584 10.7028 10.6437 10.6683 Energy 0.0192 0.0202 0.0171 0.0188 Homogeneity 0.3913 0.3789 0.4011 0.3904\nBased on the energy, contrast and homogeneity analysis results, the results are relatively commensurate with research [20], where the sample pepper color image yielded homogeneity = 0.3906, contrast = 10.4840, and energy = 0.016. But these results are clearly superior to research [62], where the homogeneity value = 0.4110, contrast = 10.1098, and energy = 0.165. This proves that the proposed method has relatively good quality based on these three features."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "This study succeeded in designing an encryption algorithm that combines several diffusion patterns and interleaved confusion based on a combination of chaotic maps, namely 6D hyperchaotic and 1D chaotic systems. The goal is to increase security by spreading encryption evenly throughout the image and providing high encryption complexity so it is not easy to decrypt. The 1D Chaotic map has a positive LE value which is intended to provide unstable dynamics, making it more sensitive to initial conditions. In the first stage, the encryption algorithm provides a uniform encryption effect, as evidenced by an identical histogram for each channel but different from the original. The second, third, and fourth stages use the 6D hyperchaotic system. This hyperchaotic has four positive LE values, one zero LE, and one negative LE, resulting in a very dynamic, robust, and unpredictable chaotic sequence. Six chaotic sequences were used for the three stages of encryption with alternating diffusion and obfuscation patterns with different interleaved techniques and scan patterns. The SHA-512 algorithm is also implemented to improve keyspace quality and key sensitivity. Based on the hypothesis, this approach succeeded in designing an encryption algorithm resistant to various attack tests such as statistical, differential, brute force, NIST randomness, data loss, and noise attacks. Moreover, the proposed method yields superior results over the previous method.\nDECLARATION OF COMPETING INTEREST The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
