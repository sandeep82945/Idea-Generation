    "abstractText": "Although titanium and titanium alloys have become the preferred materials for various medical implants, surface modification technology still needs to be strengthened in order to adapt to the complex physiological environment of the human body. Compared with physical or chemical modification methods, biochemical modification, such as the introduction of functional hydrogel coating on implants, can fix biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, growth factors, polysaccharides, or nucleotides on the surface of the implants, so that they can directly participate in biological processes; regulate cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation; and improve the biological activity on the surface of the implants. This review begins with a look at common substrate materials for hydrogel coatings on implant surfaces, including natural polymers such as collagen, gelatin, chitosan, and alginate, and synthetic materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, and polyacrylic acid. Then, the common construction methods of hydrogel coating (electrochemical method, sol\u2013gel method and layer-by-layer self-assembly method) are introduced. Finally, five aspects of the enhancement effect of hydrogel coating on the surface bioactivity of titanium and titanium alloy implants are described: osseointegration, angiogenesis, macrophage polarization, antibacterial effects, and drug delivery. In this paper, we also summarize the latest research progress and point out the future research direction. After searching, no previous relevant literature reporting this information was found.",

            "text": "In the 1940s, some scholars implanted pure titanium (Ti) into the femur of mice without causing adverse reactions, which proved that Ti had good biocompatibility [1]. Later, more and more scholars began to apply pure Ti in dental implants, joint prostheses, and other clinical fields. However, in the process of application, it was found that the low hardness and poor wear resistance of Ti did not meet the requirements of the force parts of knee joint and hip joint, promoting research into and development of titanium alloys. Ti6Al4V is an \u03b1 + \u03b2 alloy with higher hardness, better wear resistance, and better workability compared with Ti (Table 1). However, aluminum (Al) and vanadium (V) in Ti6Al4V alloy are harmful metal elements, which have the risk of releasing after implantation into the human body. There is an urgent need to develop new medical titanium alloys with better biocompatibility. Representative materials are Ti\u2013Nb\u2013Zr and Ti\u2013Nb\u2013Zr\u2013ME (Me (metal)) systems, especially Ti\u2013Nb\u2013Zr\u2013Si (TNZS) alloy, which not only has better biocompatibility, but also has improved corrosion resistance, and can better match with human bone tissue [2].\nGels 2023, 9, 423. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9050423 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 423 2 of 22\nAt present, titanium and titanium alloys have become the preferred materials for medical metal products because of their lower density, higher specific strength, and better biocompatibility. Although medical titanium and titanium alloys have outstanding properties, it is still necessary to strengthen the research on surface modification technology to match the complex physiological environment in human body (Figure 1) [3]. Now, construction of functional coatings on titanium and titanium alloys has attracted more and more attention. For example, titanium nitride [4], titanium aluminum nitride [5], and titanium dioxide [6] coatings significantly improve wear resistance and corrosion resistance of titanium and titanium alloys. The modification of Si\u2013TiO2 nanotubes on the Ti substrate generates a nanostructured and hydrophilic surface, which can promote cell growth. Moreover, the existence of the TiO2 nanotubes and Si element improves the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and early bone-formation around the implanted screws [7]. Coating of silver (Ag), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and other antibacterial metal elements show excellent antibacterial properties [8,9]. Adding Cu with Ti-15Mo reduces the possibility of bacterial infection during biomedical implant surgeries [10]. Differently from physical or chemical modification methods such as micro-arc oxidation and sandblasting to prepare oxide film or rough surface on the surface of implants, biochemical modification of fixing specific proteins, peptides, growth factors, polysaccharides, nucleotides, and other biomolecules on the surface of implants can directly participate in biological processes and regulate cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation [11,12]. Hydrogel is a type of hydrophilic three-dimensional network structure formed by natural or artificial synthetic polymer materials through the gelation process of sol, which is widely used in many fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biosensors. The functional hydrogel coatings on titanium implants can effectively coordinate the advantages of hydrogel (lubricity, biocompatibility, and controlled release) with those of implants (stiffness, strength, and toughness) [13], and change the electrochemical behavior of titanium implants and enhance corrosion resistance [14]. In this review, we will first introduce the classification of hydrogel coatings on the surface of titanium implants, including natural hydrogels and synthetic hydrogels, according to the composition of the hydrogel matrix. We will then introduce the common binding methods of hydrogel coatings and titanium implants, such as the electrochemical precipitation method, the sol\u2013gel method, and the layer-by-layer self-assembly method. Subsequently, the improvement of titanium implants by hydrogel coating on osseointegration, angiogenesis, macrophage polarization, antibacterial, and drug delivery are summarized in detail. Finally, the possible problems and future development direction of hydrogel coatings are presented in order to provide reference for scientific research workers in related fields. After searching, no previous research reporting of this information was found.\nGels 2023, 9, 423 3 of 22 Gels 2023, 9, 423 3 of 21\nFigure 1.

            "heading": "2.1. Natural Hydrogel Coating",
            "text": "Natural hydrogel is composed of natural biological materials which are highly similar to the extracellular matrix. It is considered as good biomimetic material in tissue engineering because of its complete bioactivity in promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and biodegradation. Common natural biomaterials are collagen and gelatin from animal protein, hyaluronic acid from animal epithelium and connective tissue, chitosan from shells of crustaceans, and alginate from the cytoplasm and cell wall.\n2.1.1. Collagen-Based Hydrogel Coating\nCollagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix in mammals, and is mainly distributed in the cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, viscera, intervertebral discs, and dentin, and plays an important role in supporting and protecting the body and organs. Collagen has the advantages of non-cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, easy absorption, small immune response, low antigenicity, etc. Coating titanium alloys with collagen promotes adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of born-forming cells [30\u201333] as well as fibroblasts [34,35]. In comparison with uncoated commercially pure titanium, collagen coating significantly improves bone mineralization and maturation [36]. More rapid osteointegration will be achieved if the coating is combined with vitamins [37], phospholipid [38], or hydroxyapatite (HA) [39\u201341]. Besides osteogenesis, collagen coating can support the timely conversion of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the pro-healing M2 phenotype, inhibiting inflammatory reaction and generating a beneficial osteoimmune microenvironment [42,43] (Figure 2). Simultaneously, collagen coating prominently facilitates angiogenesis of endothelial cells [42] and strengthens local blood supply restoration through sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [44].\n2.1.2. Gelatin-Based Hydrogel Coating\nGelatin is a product of collagen hydrolysis but retains arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic (RGD) cell adhesion peptide and protease degradation sites of collagen with lower immunogenicity. Gelatin-based hydrogel coatings enhance the integration between implant and tissue [45], and promote biological activity by loading various growth factors. For example, gelatin coating loaded with VEGF/bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) shell-core microspheres promoted osteogenic differentiation and osseointegration effectively in 3D-printed porous titanium alloy [46]. In 2000, Van den Bulcke et al. introduced the methacryl group into modified gelatin for the first time to prepare methacryl amide gelatin, which gave the gelatin the property of photo-cross-linking under the photoinitiator and light [47]. When loaded with a short cationic antimicrobial peptide and synthetic silicate nanoparticles, the photo-cross-linked gelatin-based hydrogel coating demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity and enhanced osteogenesis [48]. The addition of ginger inhibited the growth of S. mutans and P. gingivalis [49]. Methylacrylamide gelatin combined with photosensitizer and photocatalyst offers direct fibroblast activation [50] (Figure 3) and multi-mode pho-\nGels 2023, 9, 423 5 of 22\ntothermal and photodynamic antibacterial effects [51]. Furthermore, the allylated gelatin co-encapsulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) support and achieve concurrent vasculogenic and osteogenic performance [52].

Chitosan-Based Hydrogel Coating Chitosan, the deacetylated chitin, is the only natural alkaline polysaccharide with charge. Due to their pH, ionic strength, and temperature sensitivity, chitosan-based hydrogels have good application prospects in the fields of targeting, sustained drug release, tissue engineering, and medical dressings [53]. Chitosan-based hydrogel coatings increase the antibacterial ability of the implant by loading antibacterial agents [54\u201356], or metal ions (Ag, Cu) [57\u201360]. Coatings give the implant the photocatalytic antibacterial effect by modifying or loading novel semiconductor materials, such as graphene [61], molybdenum disulfide [62], black phosphorus [63], and molybdenum diselenide [64]. They also promote osteogenesis through loading drugs, (for example, pitavastatin [65] and quercetin [66]), active substances (insulin growth factor binding protein-3 [67] and BMP-2 [68]) and\n2.1.3.

In addition, chitosan combines with polyanions such as gelatin [72,73], hyaluronic acid [74], and sodium alginate [75,76] to form a polyelectrolyte complex, promoting the surface functionalization of titanium. Modified\nGels 2023, 9, 423 7 of 22\ncarboxymethyl chitosan nanofibers, as a novel implant coating on titania nanotube arrays, inhibit bacterial colony formation and increase osteoblast cell survival [77] (Figure 4).

Alginate-Based Hydrogel Coating\nAlginate is a type of linear hydrophilic polysaccharide existing in brown algae. It forms hydrogels by ionic cross-linking with Ca2+ and other polyvalent inorganic cations. There are a large number of \u2013OH and \u2013COOH groups on the alginate skeleton, which can be\nGels 2023, 9, 423 8 of 22\nmodified by chemical or physical methods to achieve controlled release of cells or bioactive molecules in response to temperature, pH, and light [79]. Composite coating formed by alginate crosslinking with collagen enhances the cell adhesion of titanium implants [80,81]. Alginate and chitosan coating improves the biomineralization, the antibacterial activity, and corrosion resistance [75,82]. The addition of Ag further promotes the antibacterial ability and reduces the bacterial adhesion [83,84]. Alginate-based hydrogel coatings also provide sustained antibacterial activity by loading various antibacterial agents such as gentamicin [68], vancomycin [85], and chlorchloridine [86], and improving in vitro osteogenic differentiation as well as bone integration by loading BMP2 [87] and RGD [88]."

            "text": "The synthetic hydrogels have great application potential due to the wide source of raw materials, simple synthesis method, and controllable composition and structure. Synthetic hydrogels can be divided into the following functional groups: non-ionic hydrogels including polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylamide (PAM), poly N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAm), polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly (lacto-glycolic acid) (PLGA), etc., and ionic hydrogels such as polyacrylic acid (PAA). PVA hydrogels with porous titanium bases are being developed to repair or replace articular cartilage due to their high mechanical strength [89]. The Ti\u2013hydrogel artificial cartilage material constructed with polydopamine (PDA), PVA, HA, or PAA as raw materials is an ideal high-strength and low-friction biomimetic cartilage material [90]. The novel \u201csoft (PVA hydrogel layer)\u2013hard (porous Ti6Al4V alloy substrate)\u201d structure improves the surface wettability and tribological properties of Ti6Al4V alloy [91]. PAM hydrogel is an injectable soft-tissue-filling material. PAM-based hydrogels in combination with titanium-oxide nanotubes are also widely used as potential candidates for cartilage replacement [92]. PAM/PVA hydrogel on Ti6Al4V alloy configuration combines the good load-bearing capacity of the rigid substrate and the excellent lubrication of the hydrogel layer [93]. The cross-linked network porous structure of hydrogel is the main factor accounting for the low dynamic friction [94]. PNIPAm is a thermo-responsive polymer with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) around 32 \u25e6C. When the temperature is above the LCST, the polymer chains become hydrophobic and collapse, resulting in dense crosslinking networks in which the loaded molecules are more likely to be trapped, thus leading to slow release [95]. PEG is obtained by glycol dehydration polycondensation. The functional-grouphydroxyl at the end of the molecular chain is prone to chemical reactions and chemical modifications [96]. PLGA\u2013PEG\u2013PLGA hydrogels, polymerization of PLGA with PEG, are suitable for drug loading in vitro and sustained drug release in vivo, owing to the thermo-sensitive properties [97]. PAA hydrogels are three-dimensional macromolecules containing a large number of carboxyl groups that cannot move freely. When the pH value of the solution is different, it presents different degrees of shrinkage or swelling state. It can be used to prepare a simple and low-cost hydrogel-based bone adhesive to improve the osseointegration and anti-infection ability of the bone-implant interface [98]."

Finally, the polymer network is connected to the matrix by reacting with complementary functional groups on the matrix surface (Figure 6) [105].\nGels 2023, 9, 423 10 of 22\nGels 2023, 9, 423 10 of 21\nform uncross-linked polymer chains.

In order to enhance integration between implant material and hydrogel, a PDA layer was introduced onto the surface of the titanium alloy. Through chemical crosslinking between PDA and gelatin [45,51] or HRP/H2O2 catalysis [78], the hydrogel precursor could simply form a firm gel layer on the titanium alloy plate. Methylacryylated gelatin (GelMA) is a photo-cross-linked gelatin derivative.

Designing and constructing a hydrogel drug-controlled release system by loading with antibacterial drugs such as gentamicin [104,108,148] or vancomycin [98,149,150] on a titanium surface is a frequently used strategy. Antibacterial peptides have garnered more attention as alternative antibacterial agents of implant coating due to their unique antibacterial mechanism [151,152]. Bacteriophage-loaded hydrogels also showed excellent antimicrobial activity in inhibiting attachment and colonization of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis surrounding and within femoral tissues [153]. Metal antibacterial agents are introduced into the implant hydrogel coating because of their broad-spectrum antibacterial properties and no drug resistance. Among them, silver ion is most commonly used [26,78,154,155]. Metal oxide antimicrobial agents such as zinc oxide [109] and calcium oxide [110] also show significant antibacterial ability in the coating, although Zn ion has renal absorption toxicity.

Among them, the application prospects of biomedical titanium alloy are particularly remarkable. However, some disadvantages of titanium alloys limit their further application. Therefore, scientists have been working to explore improvements in the properties of titanium alloys. Hydrogel coatings can serve as ideal carriers to introduce drugs, peptides, metal ions, growth factors, and cells to effectively bio-modify titanium alloys. In this study, we have reviewed the popular matrix of hydrogel coatings, especially the natural materials such as collagen, gelatin, chitosan, and alginate. The usual modification methods are the electrochemical method, the sol\u2013gel method, and layer-by-layer self-assembly. Hydrogel coatings significantly improve the properties of the titanium implant in osseointegration, angiogenesis, macrophage polarization, antibacterial effects, and drug delivery. Although the improvement of titanium alloy caused by hydrogel coating is obvious, there are still some problems worth noting: (1) The mechanical properties of hydrogel coating are poor, and whether some inorganic fillers can be added to promote bone integration and mechanical properties needs further research. (2) The strong bond between the hydrogel coating and titanium alloy needs to be further strengthened. (3) Some semiconductor materials have excellent photocatalytic properties, and the introduction of semiconductor materials in hydrogel coatings is promising for photodynamic therapy. Therefore, future research should focus on these aspects to further improve the properties of hydrogel coating on titanium alloy.\nGels 2023, 9, 423 16 of 22\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.H., Y.L., R.F. and H.C.; formal analysis, X.Q.; data curation, T.X.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.F., H.C., Q.L. and Z.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.H.; visualization.
