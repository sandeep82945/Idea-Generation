    "abstractText": "Accessibility, the right to equal opportunities for all citizens, is defined in Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Furthermore, Article 21 of the same convention details how the accessibility of information and communications should be ensured in practice. As a result of the convention, international, European and national policies, standards and law have been established, creating a legal and binding framework for compliance. On this basis, this paper considers the goals of the IMPACT (Inclusive Method based on the Perception of Accessibility and Compliance Testing) project. This project aims to define the skills and competencies that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) accessibility educators and mediators should hold for compliance. The paper looks to discuss how to demystify accessibility compliance and, in doing so, how to foster inclusive mindsets through training practices and the European Certification and Qualification Association (ECQA) certification, while noting challenges for audiences and stakeholders. The experience of Koena, a French social enterprise specializing in Digital Accessibility, forms the basis for the paper\u2019s observations.",

Accessibility is a right to equal opportunities for all citizens. Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the\n2 Rights of Persons with Disabilities1 (CRPD 2006) deals with accessibility and states that\n\u201cTo enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.\u201d\nIn addition, Article 21 provides a detailed description of how the accessibility of information and communications should be ensured in practice. It sets out several measures for States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities can exercise the right to freedom of expression and opinion on an equal basis with others and through all forms of communication of their choice.\nIn 2010, this document was ratified by the European Union and EU Member States, consequently, a solid legislative framework for improving the situation of people with disabilities was created. Two key documents laid the foundation for enhancing digital accessibility in Europe. On the one hand, the Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe (2015)2 served as a model for introducing general political strategies while incorporating specific actions to guarantee access to ICT for people with disabilities. On the other hand, the reviewed European Disability Strategy (2021-2023)3, is a specific instrument for implementing policies for disability. The main objective is to bring together different initiatives to guarantee the full participation and improvement of the rights of people with disabilities. It also reinforces the need to guarantee fundamental rights, equal opportunities and freedom of movement for people with disabilities irrespective of their sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation.\nAt the legislative level, three key directives regulate accessibility in the European Union: The Web Accessibility Directive (2016), the updated Audiovisual Communication Services Directive (2018) and the European Accessibility Act (2019). The standardisation agencies of each Member State must adapt their laws to transpose this legislative framework in their countries to ensure access to media and digital content for all citizens.\n3 See Union of Equality: Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030.

The first and third requirements focus on an accessibility score which has to be published. The European Commission has established a model accessibility statement5 for this purpose. The challenge of this requirement is to evaluate the compliance of each web service with the European Standard and make it possible to compare the level between each member state. The limit of this requirement is the technical approach of web accessibility: the focus is on compliance with the EN 301 549 Standard. The compliance status can be:\n\u25cf fully compliant \u25cf partially compliant \u25cf not compliant.\nThe compliance score becomes crucial for calculating the status for display on the web service. In that perspective, the challenge for the organisation is to publish an accessibility statement with a minimum status of \u201cpartially compliant\u201d and to display a good score, even if the strategy could be to declare some exemptions.\nThe second requirement, is the proposal of a feedback mechanism to facilitate users to flag accessibility problems encountered. The organisations must also have people in place who are responsible for communicating with users who encounter accessibility issues. Taking the users\u2019 needs into account in one\u2019s Digital Strategy is probably the core of this challenge."

            "text": "Koena is a French social enterprise specialising in Digital Accessibility founded by Armony Altinier in September 2016. Koena offers services to organisations that want to comply with legal requirements in France and Europe, such as audits and training. The founder of Koena has been working in the Digital Accessibility field since 2007 and contributed to the French version of the Web Accessibility Standard in 2015 (RGAA version 3). Koena was part of the Digital Accessibility Working Group led by the French government Agency \u2013 DINUM, to update the French Web Accessibility Standard in compliance with the EN 301 549.\nThe originality of the French approach relies on a long history dating back to 2003 when the French government first asked an association \u2013 BrailleNet, to create a Web Accessibility Standard based on the international one: the Web Content Accessibility\n5 See Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523. Retrieved from: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1523/oj\n4 See Directive (EU) 2016/2102. Retrieved from: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L2102&from=F R02.\n4 Guidelines (WCAG)6 by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The first French Accessibility Guidelines name was AccessiWeb. It was the BrailleNet association property, and it was collaboratively created, with volunteers trained by BrailleNet. BrailleNet created a methodology to make compliance with the WCAG easier to understand and evaluate. All the Success Criteria of the WCAG were thematically split into 13 concrete and technical topics:\n1. images 2. frames 3. colours 4. multimedia 5. tables 6. links 7. scripts 8. required elements 9. structuration\n10. appearance 11. forms 12. navigation 13. consultation\nFor each AccessiWeb criterion, a correspondence with one or several WCAG Success Criterion and associated Techniques was present. Each AccessiWeb Criterion had to comply with these three simple rules:\n\u25cf it must be written as a yes/no question \u25cf when the answer is yes: the criteria status is passed \u25cf when the answer is no: the criteria status is failed.\nBrailleNet developed training based on this AccessiWeb methodology. Training conducted using this methodology resulted in the development of a professional community composed of more than 500 people who share a mutual understanding of the international Web Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\nIn 2009, the French administration decided to create a brand-new standard called RGAA for \u201cR\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 pour les administrations\u201d. However, the French community of Web Accessibility Professionals maintained the AccessiWeb Guidelines. Consequently in 2015, the French administration decided to drop the previous version of the RGAA standard and adopt the AccessiWeb Methodology establishing it, now RGAA 3.0, as the official methodology for France. In 2019, the new European Digital Accessibility Standard EN 301 549, evolved the RGAA and the acronym became \u201cR\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019am\u00e9lioration de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9\u201d. Correspondence is now based on WCAG and also on the European Standard. The French administration maintained the AccessiWeb Methodology to facilitate professionals already aware of this method to comply with the new requirements.\nThe consequence of these updates in France is an established and relatively mature professional community for technical aspects of accessibility however, this has been\n6 See Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Retrieved from: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\n5 detrimental in some respects to the social goal of accessibility and the inclusion of people with a disability. A gap is observed between some professionals who are very aware of the technical aspects of Digital Accessibility and the vast majority of web service owners and professionals who still need to update their skills (OPIIEC, 2019)7. This remains evident in a scenario where a web service manager discovers Digital Accessibility and questions \u2018how to approach the subject\u2019?\nIn France, Digital Accessibility is often perceived as a technical issue, more than a political one. This situation results from the disengagement of the different governments, which resulted in two significant events in 2021. On October 4th, 2021, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities published its concluding observations of their initial report for France. The role of this Committee is to promote inclusion, advocate for the human rights of all persons with disabilities and provide recommendations to support the implementation of the provisions enshrined in the CRPD. The Committee held a series of meeting with the French government between August 23 and September 7, 2021. Concerning Accessibility, 19 (e) \u201cThe Committee notes with concern: [\u2026] Barriers in the digital work environment preventing access for persons with disabilities to information and communication, including on government websites and in relation to software.\u201d8 The Committer then \u201crecommends that the State party: [\u2026]\n\u25cf (b) Adopt accessibility strategies and raise awareness about the concept of universal design for persons with disabilities; [\u2026] \u25cf (e) Ensure universal access to digital technology for all persons with disabilities, including business software, and revise Decree No. 2019-768 on accessibility to information for blind persons at government, public and private websites; \u25cf (f) Apply European Union Directive 2016/2102 of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, and Web Content Accessibility Guideline 2.0 to all public websites;\u201d\nHowever, even though the Web Accessibility Directive requires the Member States to report on the results of their monitoring activities every three years, France was part of the three countries (with Cyprus and Portugal) that didn\u2019t publish their report before the due date: December 23, 2021. In March 2022, the report of France remained outstanding on the Official Webpage of the Web Accessibility Directive Monitoring Reports9. In the context of the relatively mature professional (small) community with essential technical skills, and the lack of political support and perspective, we will base our observations on Koena\u2019s experience, especially where some public administrations face difficulties in improving accessibility using the technical approach.\n9 See Web Accessibility Directive - Monitoring reports.

            "text": "The European Standard for Digital Accessibility EN 301 54910 is mainly based on the international Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, around four principles:\n1. Perceivable 2. Operable 3. Understandable 4. Robust.\nThose principles are divided into 13 guidelines that are not testable. These guidelines provide the primary goals that digital professionals should work toward to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. Each guideline is divided into Success Criteria that are testable. To comply with the WCAG (especially the \u201cSection 9 - Web\u201d of the European Standard EN 301 549), it is necessary to test for and meet the Success Criteria. To meet these Success Criteria, there are hundreds of techniques documented to rely upon. Non-technical people can potentially find it challenging to work with the WCAG however, Digital Accessibility is not only about coding; it is also about designing, writing texts, and the provision of accessible images and multimedia etc.. All persons involved in the Digital Production line need to take Digital Accessibility into account, even if they are not web developers.\nThe classical way of implementing the Web Accessibility Directive The Web Accessibility Directive requires publishing an Accessibility Statement with a score. To calculate this score, website owners will have to order an audit of their website. A compilation of the different scores is supposed to be used to create the monitoring report that must be forwarded to the European Commission by each Member State.\nIn July 2014, the W3C published the \"Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology\", also known as WCAG-EM 1.011. This methodology relies on five steps:\n1. Step 1: Define the Evaluation Scope 2. Step 2: Explore the Target Website 3. Step 3: Select a Representative Sample 4. Step 4: Audit the Selected Sample 5. Step 5: Report the Evaluation Findings.\nOn conclusion of an audit, a website owner is issued with a list of failures to the EN301 549 Standard and a compliance score. The next step should be to publish an Accessibility Statement and evaluate the budget and time to improve the score. At this point, an assessment of a training requirement can become evident to facilitate the website owners to both fix the failures and, to improve their ability to take Digital\n11 See Web Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0.

In a best-case scenario, the management team will fix the maximum failures to reach a score previously set, and conduct an audit to check if they achieved the target goal. In the French Administration, this goal is set to 75%12. If a score of 75% is reached, the digital service is considered to have taken disability into account. The limit of this approach lies with the disappearance of persons with disabilities. Reaching a score by fixing some technical issues is sufficient to consider that disability has been taken into account for the French Administration; this doesn\u2019t comply with the international legal framework.\nChanging perspective: toward an inclusive method based on the perception of accessibility and compliance testing.\nThe Web Accessibility Directive aims to implement the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD). The purpose of the CRPD is defined in Article 1: \u201cpromote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.\u201d In article 9, the CRPD defines Accessibility requirements: \u201cStates Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications\u201d. These measures shall \u201cinclude the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility\u201d.\nIn response to a public consultation of the European Commission on the Web Accessibility Directive, the European Disability Forum highlighted: \u201cWhile there may be pockets of good practice in this area, there is still a very long way to go to ensure actual involvement of persons with disabilities in developing websites and apps. Our motto is \u201cNothing about us without us\u201d, yet many examples of poor practice in this paper highlight poor communication from public sector bodies and a failure to engage with organisations of persons with disabilities. Connecting with groups impacted by poor web accessibility is essential to ensure successful implementation of the Directive. It is also a legal requirement set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that all Member States, as well as the European Union have ratified.\u201d\nThe European Standard EN301 549 is a checklist which includes technical requirements aimed to help all organisations who buy, develop or manufacture ICT products or services to comply with the Web Accessibility Directive. Compliance to a standard implies that audits are conducted to check the compliance, and the establishment of the new and specialised role, Digital Accessibility Auditor, to make the assessment. Auditors need to have technical skills and a solid knowledge of assistive technologies and skills for making a Web compatible with accessibility. This work is essential but, without a significant political engagement, it can be insufficient to ensure that people with disabilities have full access to information and communication. In the case of France, the Accessibility Statement can be deceptive and non-reflective of the actual level of accessibility, as highlighted by some\n12 See En savoir plus sur nos crit\u00e8res d'\u00e9valuation \u2013 L'Observatoire de la qualit\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches en ligne. Retrieved from: https://observatoire.numerique.gouv.fr/Aide/Observatoire\n8 associations and press articles13. To address this problem, accessibility must include the end-users point of view and that of the people with disabilities. As stated in the Web Accessibility Initiative portal, in the section \u2018Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility\u201914: \u201cUnfortunately, many approach accessibility just as a checklist. This risks missing the real purpose of accessibility - the user experience.\u201d\nIt can be observed that there is a will by the W3C to give a methodology that evaluates not only compliance, but also accessibility by the introduction of a new definition for the next generation of the WCAG (version 3): the notion of critical error. A critical error is defined as \u201cAn accessibility problem that will stop a user from being able to complete a process.\u201d The draft version of WCAG 3 can widely evolve in the future before reaching stability. Still, this notion of \u201ccritical error\u201d addresses what article 9 of the CRPD calls \u201cobstacles and barriers to accessibility\u201d. A draft version of \u201cscoring outcomes\u201d15 in WCAG 3, clearly states that any critical error, regardless of the compliance score, shall be qualified as a \u201cvery poor\u201d result in terms of accessibility. The Digital Accessibility Mediator\u2019s mission is to identify such critical errors by hearing those with disabilities\u2019 voices and relaying their message to the professionals in charge of a web service."

            "text": "In assessing the accessibility challenges for stakeholders, including the audience, we can look at existing barriers encountered. Kulkarni (2019) highlights limitations posed by both institutional and technological contexts as two key factors which disrupt efforts at accessibility standard compliance. At the institutional level, the presence of various actors whose' unawareness of the needs and constraints of their fellow stakeholders may inadvertently and adversely affect the implementation of accessibility. This can result in a stop-start effort at standard and implementation (Oswal, 2013). A resulting effort at compliance can be hampered by the consideration of accessibility as an addition when considered as part of the overall design implementation. According to Neufeldt et al. (2007), this results from a perception of market restriction and potentially reduced profitability where assistive technologies are facilitated. Also, the enforcement of global and European standard implementation can be lacking by regional Governments can be inadequate through the issue of unmonitored compliance guidelines (Lazar et al., 2015). Kulkarni (2017) highlights that an overall dominant institutional attitude towards accessibility may inhibit the implementation of inclusion. For example, multiple stakeholders who do not share objectives and agendas can result in dualisms such as \u201cprofit versus human rights, market share versus accessibility, competition versus inclusion\u201d (Stienstra et al., 2007: 149).\n15 See Section \u201cScoring outcomes\u201d in the WCAG 3.0 working draft version of 07 December 2021.

This is most evident where technology fails to cover a diverse range of disabilities coupled with a perception of complicated guideline fulfilment (Kelly et al. 2010). The \u2018reactive process\u2019 affecting the rate of change and cost results in excluding accessibility needs in product or service design (Dobransky & Hargittai, 2006)."

In this regard, the Web Accessibility Directive is clear: \u201cLack of priority, time or knowledge should not be considered as legitimate reasons.\u201d\nHowever, this is probably the first reason why there remains a lack of consideration of accessibility at design phase. To better understand the problem, let\u2019s consider, for example, a form on a website. If the form doesn't work for example when a button is clicked on with a mouse and only works when Enter is pressed on the keyboard, the bug will usually be reported as a priority and fixed immediately. On the other hand, if it is possible to validate the form with the mouse but not with the keyboard, we often observe that the issue will not be tagged as a priority but as a nice to have feature. The difference between these two situations is how we consider the users. A user able to use a mouse is given priority over a user who is only able to use the keyboard or an assistive technology such as voice recognition or screen reader. To quote the United Nations:\nIn a similar manner to racism, sexism or ageism, ableism is commonly described as the belief system that underlies the negative attitudes, stereotypes and stigma that devalue persons with disabilities on the basis on their actual or perceived impairments. Ableism considers persons with disabilities as being less worthy of respect and consideration, less able to contribute and participate, and of less inherent value than others. Whereas other discriminatory discourse is increasingly challenged by public opinion, ableism continues to legitimize the rhetoric behind different forms of discrimination. Ableism may be conscious or unconscious, and may be entrenched in institutions, systems and the broader culture of society. It limits the opportunities of persons with disabilities and reduces their inclusion in community life.\n10\nAs long as people, administrations, companies and professionals do not consider people with disabilities as equal to those without disabilities, the problem is likely to remain."

During an Expert Group Meeting of the United Nations on International Norms and Standards in 199816, experts related the evolution of thinking about disability issues, from a medical model of disability to a social model of disability.\n\u201cDisability tends to be couched within a medical and welfare framework, identifying people with disabilities as ill, different from their non-disabled peers, and in need of care. Because the emphasis is on the medical needs of people with disabilities, there is a corresponding neglect of their wider social needs. This has resulted in severe isolation for people with disabilities and their families\u201d.\nOn the contrary, article 1 of the CRPD states: \u201cPersons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\u201d\nWhile Digital Accessibility, according to the social model of disability, is defined as a way of designing and developing digital services for use by people with disabilities, several companies develop browser extensions to \u201chelp\u201d persons with disabilities. In response to a Web Accessibility Directive Consultation, the European Disability Forum (EDF) published a Position Paper17. EDF expresses concerns stating that, another issue is the increased use of accessibility overlays by some public sector bodies. These can be plugins, toolbars or widgets often sold by companies with the promise that they will make a website accessible. These tools will not make a website magically comply with web accessibility standards because they do not alter the source code of a website. These tools may be useful for some users but can also very negatively impact a website\u2019s accessibility for people with other disabilities, as highlighted by many web accessibility experts and persons with disabilities using assistive technology. There is a concern about the fact that these tools may be seen as an \u2018easy way\u2019 to comply with the Directive by some public authorities in a range of countries. Accessibility overlays are not going to fix known accessibility issues on an inaccessible website, yet some public sector bodies may be purchasing these products, thinking that they will \u2018solve\u2019 the accessibility problems on their website. We have even seen these products promoted by government websites and other public authorities, which further highlights the skills shortage mentioned above. We would like the European Commission to provide clear guidance for public sector bodies in\n17 See Web Directive: public consultation response European Disability Forum Position Paper.

Goodhart's law is an adage describing this issue in the economic field. It is often stated as \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\u201d (Goodhart 1975). In France, the Association Valentin Ha\u00fcy (AVH) wrote several blog posts to report excessive use of derogation to increase the compliance score artificially. The European Disability Forum (EDF) also noted the \u201cextensive use of the \u2018disproportionate burden\u2019 clause\u201d. The report concludes: \u201cUse of the \u2018disproportionate burden\u2019 clause appears to be a delaying tactic, effectively a way to kick the decision-making down the road instead of developing a strategy to deal with the accessibility issues identified.\u201d While chasing after the perfect compliance score, the goal of including persons with disabilities seems to fade."

            "text": "Accessibility is a right to equal opportunities for all citizens. The impact of digital accessibility is more than just ensuring that people can access and interact with an ICT tool, product and service. It also implies a shift in mindset, methods, and behaviours (Taylor, 2017). The concept of accessibility has undergone three main changes in research studies in this area, the shift towards a universal concept instead of the exclusive one, which is user-centred and proactive (Greco, 2018: 211). Therefore, creating environments and accessible tools must allow all people, regardless of their abilities, to have access to media and digital content for their personal development and independence.\nEssential aspects to take into consideration when designing with accessibility in mind are: an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments, involvement of users throughout the design and development, a design-driven and refined by user-centric evaluations, an iterative approach, a multidisciplinary team with different skills and perspectives and a clear but at the same time flexible approach to user testing (Oncins and Orero, 2021). In reality, many software developers still do not take digital accessibility into account, and software process improvement and innovation communities still talk about quality standards and usability without involving users with all kinds of abilities and disabilities.\nWhy is this the case? Because to open one\u2019s mind and get closer to an inclusive mindset is quite a complex process. It requires intrinsic motivation. It is a good emotional reason to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d and learn about the topics elaborated in this article and how to apply them in practice. It would need a software developer who gets angry because his blind brother cannot find a job or cannot register for his Covid-19 vaccination. It would require a programmer who is fed up with all the various barriers that hold back her grandparents from using the web and digital services as they would like to. It would need more diversity and inclusion managers within software companies to come up with solutions, such as Microsoft Accessibility. In addition, positive leadership is crucial to authentically communicate\n12\nand enable inclusive mindsets within teams and organisations (Sauberer 2021). It is not sufficient to rationally understand that diversity is a key success factor for solving various complex problems (Syed 2019), we need to experience the power of diverse thinking to emotionally understand the difference that it makes in our own lives and in the lives of those we like and love."

            "text": "One of the main problems in the accessibility field is the lack of professionals trained from a universal design and user-centric perspective. On many occasions, the emphasis in digital and media digital accessibility training is placed on technical aspects essential to reach the end-user (Matamala and Orero, 2019; Oncins, 2021) without considering fundamental competencies, such as: understanding accessibility, needs and preferences of the different users, service competence to be able to mediate and deliver accessibility properly, or promoting promotion to be able to raise awareness and involve stakeholders.\nMost digital accessibility training is included in academic IT studies related to the development of technological systems, services and products. It aims to comply with standards without providing a deep understanding of the users' needs (Oncins et al., 2020). On many occasions, a web developer enables a web page to be compatible with screen readers without having received training on how users of this service navigate the internet. On the other hand, the growing convergence of digital and media content towards the web results in an increasing demand for professionals with training in digital accessibility.\nIn addition, percentages of digital accessibility are increasing, but the importance of quality and the need for training professionals in this field should be highlighted. In this sense, the IMPACT project (2019 - 2022) aims to train the figure of the educator/mediator in digital accessibility to be able to provide advice and guidance to the different agents involved in the design of digital systems, services, and products."

In any case, many people were too young or too old, not from the right background (ethnical, social, educational), not having the right gender or the right sexual orientation or religious belief. Physical or intellectual disabilities were treated as a significant deficit, a \u201chandicap\u201d in all areas of life. A blind software developer? Impossible. A deaf hairdresser? Unthinkable.\nTimes are changing. One-klick digital accessibility checks when using standard software? An autistic software evaluator at SAP? The reality for years. A government reflecting a highly diverse and heterogeneous society? Look at Canada. The norms in society are becoming fragile and more diverse. There is a window of opportunity for all people, with and without disabilities, to appreciate the talents and strengths of people. People who do not (want to) comply with outdated norms but are individuals who share with others more similarities than differences. Resource and strengths-oriented approaches and diversity management at the workplace are key requirements when it comes to innovation and the extraordinary performance of teams and organisations (Sauberer, 2021).\n13\nAccessibility professionals are a growing global community. They work for broadcasters, media, governments, enterprises, and all kinds of organisations that take compliance and social responsibility seriously. Accessibility standards and requirements become national and international norms, such as in the case of web accessibility and participation in increasingly digital societies. Using plain language or communicating with users, clients and stakeholders in easy-to-read language have many advantages: We are getting older, more diverse, also linguistically. Newcomers in society benefit from easy-to-read language as much as young and older people, and all people: Imagine legal texts not written by lawyers for lawyers, but for citizens who can easily understand what the legal text is all about.\nIn the EU project Train2Validate, Easy to Read experts are being qualified and certified by the European Certification and Qualification Association (ECQA), as Easy to Read Validators and Facilitators. The validators are the people concerned, those with disabilities and reading difficulties. It is obvious that they are the best validators of easy or difficult to read texts.\nFor the first time, people with disabilities are considered as accessibility and inclusion experts who can be hired for assessments and consultancy. For the first time, there are European Certificates to confirm that people with disabilities, and all those who work in the field of accessibility and inclusion, are competent and qualified to do their jobs and job roles at the European level.\nNo more deficit thinking, but appreciation for qualified jobs and recognition of professionals in the field of accessibility and inclusion in needed.
