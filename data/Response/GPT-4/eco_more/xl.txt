Adaptive Stochastic Optimization Frameworks: Research could focus on developing adaptive stochastic optimization frameworks that dynamically adjust planning parameters based on real-time data and forecast accuracy improvements. This could include algorithms that learn from past performance to better predict future demand and adjust planning strategies accordingly.

Integration of Machine Learning for Demand Forecasting: Investigating the integration of advanced machine learning algorithms for more accurate demand forecasting within the rolling horizon planning cycle. This research could explore how different machine learning models, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, can be utilized to improve forecast accuracy and how these forecasts can be effectively integrated into the stochastic optimization process.

Multi-Echelon Supply Chain Coordination: Exploring the extension of the simulation-optimization framework to a multi-echelon supply chain context, where inventory and production decisions are optimized across multiple stages of the supply chain. Research could focus on the development of collaborative planning approaches that consider the interdependencies between different supply chain partners and how stochastic optimization can be applied to coordinate activities across the entire network.

Environmental and Sustainability Considerations in Production Planning: Conducting research on incorporating environmental and sustainability considerations into the stochastic optimization model for production planning. This could involve the development of models that not only minimize costs but also consider the environmental impact of production activities, such as carbon emissions and resource consumption, and aim for sustainable production practices.

Robust Optimization under High Uncertainty: Focusing on the development of robust optimization models that can perform well under high levels of uncertainty, particularly in industries where demand can be highly volatile and unpredictable. This research could explore new methodologies and algorithms for robust optimization that can handle a wide range of uncertainty levels and provide reliable production plans even in the face of significant demand fluctuations.
