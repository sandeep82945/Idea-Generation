    "abstractText": "Received: 14 July 2019 Accepted: 21 February 2021 Abstract Facing severely competitive global markets, managers of the modern transnational corporations must effectively integrate its intra-supply chain system to meet customers\u2019 multiproduct demands with good quality items, minimum operating expenses, and in a timely delivery matter. Inspired by assisting current transnational firms to achieve the mission, this study builds a mathematical model to explore a multiproduct fabrication-shipment problem incorporating an accelerated rate and ensured product quality. A single machine production scheme under a common cycle policy and with random defects, rework, and an accelerated fabrication rate is considered. The speedy rate option is associated with extra setup and linear variable costs, which aims to cut short the common cycle time. Mathematical derivation is employed to find the long-run average system expense. The optimization method is used to jointly derive the decision for common length and delivery frequency per cycle for the problem. Numerical illustration is offered to confirm the applicability of the results and expose the individual/combined influences of diverse crucial system features on the problem, thus facilitate the intra-supply chain\u2019s fabrication-shipment decision making.",

            "heading": "Literature review",
            "text": "The relevant prior works are surveyed as follows: Muckstadt and Roundy (Muckstadt & Roundy, 1987) explored the multiproduct single-warehouse multiretailer inventory-delivery systems with deterministic demand rate for each product. The authors developed a mathematical model with a cost structure incorporating multi-item stock holding cost, fixed ordering and delivering costs, and each retailer\u2019s fixed combined items ordering expense. Accordingly, an algorithm was proposed to solve the problem of only sorting and running in O(NI log NI) time. Gallego\nVolume 12 \u2022 Number 2 \u2022 June 2021 33\net al. (Gallego et al., 1996) studied the economic order quantity (EOQ) based single-resource multi-item inventory systems. Their tactical model\u2019s objective is to coordinate and decide the order quantities to reduce total stock ordering and holding expenses under the limited capacity of the resource. While the purpose of their strategic model is to coordinate and decide the order amount to reduce average cost and consider extra expense related to the maximal usage of the resource. The authors found a lower bound on the maximal resource use to determine its relevant average cost for any possible policy. A heuristic was presented for the staggering problem, and it was further used for solving both strategic and tactical models. Mandal and Roy (Mandal & Roy, 2016) examined a multi-item imperfect, finite production batch size system, wherein the rework process of imperfect items follows the regular production process in each cycle. Authors considered some cost variables as fuzzy numbers and some as random and converted their assumed model into multi-objective geometric programming (GP) problem. A numerical example was offered to demonstrate their results and objective functions. Recent studies explored the outsourcing strategy\u2019s effect on multiproduct fabrication systems featuring rework (Chiu, et al., 2019a), multiple shipments in a vendorbuyer collaborative environment (Chiu, et al., 2018a; Kauppila, et al., 2020), and product quality reassurance (Chiu, et al., 2019b).\nTo reduce production cycle time to meet timely demand, accelerated fabrication rate is an effective strategy, but it associates with extra setup and linear variable costs. Buzacott and Ozkarahan (Buzacott & Ozkarahan, 1983) investigated one- and twostage fabrication scheduling problems for two products, each with an alternative production rate and idle time. Both single-machine and two sequential machine scheduling system for 2 products were examined, wherein constant demand is assumed, and each product has its own adjustable rate. The authors concluded that the optimal schedule is the one doesn\u2019t allow idle time in-between runs. If holding cost is calculated by average inventory, then maximal rate must be applied to the product on bottleneck stage; on the contrary, if holding cost is calculated based on maximal inventory, then neither product should be produced at a maximal rate in the case of the single-machine model. Silver (Silver, 1995) explored a multi-item production system with adjusted cycle time and production rate and under cyclic scheduling policy (i.e., every T unit of time) and the constraint on shelf life. The author assumed a family of products was fabricated on a single machine using a cyclic schedule, and demand rates of these products\nare known in advance and each with its own shelf-life limit. The result revealed that the cost-minimizing T would not avoid shelf life violation for some items, and to simultaneously adjust T and the manufacturing rate of the item concerned, happened to be better than adjusting just one of these variables. Sharma (Sharma, 2008) addressed the situation that production rate decreases to reduce the level of stock or to manage constraint of shelf life. The author examined and discussed the effect of demand increase/decrease on production rate flexibility and formulated a generalized cost model relating to maintaining certain required demand levels. Other studies explored diverse features of adjustable rates on the planning and controlling fabrication systems, including the impact of variable markup rates (Arcelus & Srinivasan, 1987), variable production rates (Giri & Dohi, 2005; Chiu, et al., 2018b), storage capacity with various repair rates (Ameen, et al., 2018), and the expedited rates with quality issues (Chiu, et al., 2019c; Chiu, et al., 2019d).\nFacing challenging competitive world markets, the management of intra-supply chain and/or supply chain systems becomes one of the crucial operating goals for multinational and transnational enterprises. Banerjee (Banerjee, 1986) claimed that in a real purchasing environment, negotiating deals were usually settled by buyer and seller based on the balance of their existing power, and the result of the deal may be (near-)optimal for one party, but far away from optimal for the other party. The author then examined an integrated purchaser-vendor lot size model with the aim of minimizing the combined total cost. As a result, through price alteration, a joint optimal order policy that benefits both parties can be derived. Sarker and Khan (Sarker & Khan, 1999) studied a supplier-producer-buyer integrated model to jointly decide the optimal fabrication batch size and order policy for raw materials that keep the total costs at a minimum. In their proposed system, a producer orders the raw materials from its supplier, processes them into end products, and distributes end items periodically to its buyers. The authors developed and formulated a cost model and employed optimization techniques to determine the optimal policies. Ritvirool and Ferrell (Ritvirool & Ferrell, 2007) studied the influence on a single-vendor single-buyer integrated inventory system with product quality issues. In their model, the buyer used the (Q, r) policy to order items, while the vendor adopted a make-to-order production strategy. The quality cost (including safety stock) involved when defective items existed in vendor\u2019s inventory, and the effect of quality cost on both (Q, r) and make-to-order was investigated. Other works ex-\n34 Volume 12 \u2022 Number 2 \u2022 June 2021\nplored the operating policies and management of various supply-chain or intra-supply chain systems, including deteriorating agricultural products (Imbachi, 2018), green supply chain (Attari & Torkayesh, 2018), two-echelon constrained demand rate (D\u00edaz-Mateus, et al., 2018) and improving transparency of supply chain (Kauppila, et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, in real production processes, owing to unanticipated factors production of random imperfect items is inevitable. Some of the defects can be repaired at extra rework cost, but others must be scrapped. In past decades, many studies have been conducted to address imperfect fabrication systems\u2019 features and subsequent handling matters to ensure the desired product quality. Recent works handled the product and/or system quality matters, including zero variation manufacturing strategy (Boorla, et al., 2018), failure analysis (Rao & Singh, 2018), rework process with overtime option (Chiu, et al., 2018c), reliability block diagram approach (de Vasconcelos, et al., 2019), and lean integration in maintenance logistics (Hammadi & Herrou, 2020). Motivated by helping current transnational firms achieve the mission of meeting customers\u2019 multiproduct demands with good quality items, minimum operating expenses, and in a timely matter, this study explores a multiproduct fabrication-shipment problem incorporating an accelerated rate and ensured product quality. As prior studies paid little attention to the combination of the issues above, the present work intends to fill this research gap."

Due to the implementation of an accelerated fabrication rate P1iA, its effects on diverse system cost parameters, including an increasing setup cost KiA and unit cost CiA, as follows:\nKiA = (1 + \u03b12i)Ki , (2)\nCiA = (1 + \u03b13i)Ci . (3)\nThe proposed manufacturing process may fabricate a random xi portion of defects at a rate of d1iA. Among them, a \u03b81i portion is identified as scrap (where 0 \u2264 \u03b81i \u2264 1), and the rest of them is treated as rework-able. The rework process of product i follows its regular fabrication at a rate P2iA in each cycle (Figs. 1 and 2). Additional unit rework cost CRiA is required for reworked items. For P2iA and CRiA, we assume the following relationships:\nP2iA = (1 + \u03b11i)P2i , (4)\nCRiA = (1 + \u03b13i)CRi . (5)\nDuring the rework process of each product i, a portion \u03b82i fails (where 0 \u2264 \u03b82i \u2264 1) and becomes scraps (see Fig. 3). The production rate of scrap during the rework process is d2iA = P2iA\u03b82i. Because shortages are not permissible in the proposed system, hence, P1iA\u2212 d1iA\u2212\u03bbi > 0 must hold, where d1iA = xiP1iA.\nThe following straight-forward formulas can be observed from Figs. 1 to 3:\nTA = t1iA + t2iA + t3iA , (6)\nt1iA = Qi P1iA , (7)\n36 Volume 12 \u2022 Number 2 \u2022 June 2021\nt2iA = xiQi (1\u2212 \u03b81i)\nP2iA , (8)\nt3iA = TA \u2212 (t1iA + t2iA) , (9) H1i = (P1iA \u2212 d1iA) t1iA , (10)\nHi = H1i + (P2iA \u2212 d2iA) t2iA , (11) d1iAt1iA = xiP1iAt1iA = xiQi , (12)\n\u03d5ixiQi = [\u03b81i + \u03b82i (1\u2212 \u03b81i)]xiQi , (13)\nQi = \u03bbiTA\n[1\u2212 \u03d5iE[xi]] . (14)\nDuring the transportation time t3iA of product i, the multi-shipment policy is implemented. n fixed quantity installments of the completed lot Qi are transported at time interval tniA to sales location. The total inventories in t3iA and total stocks in the sales office in TA are as follows (Chiu, et al., 2018c):(\nn\u2212 1 2n\n) Hi (t3iA) , (15)\n1\n2 [ Hit3iA n + TA (Hi \u2212 \u03bbit3iA) ] . (16)\nFurthermore, when planning a multiproduct batch fabrication, the production manager must ensure that there is enough capacity to perform both regular production and rework processes for each product i (Nahmias, 2009). Hence, the following formulas must hold:\nL\u2211 i=1 [( \u03bbi [1\u2212 \u03d5iE[xi]] \u00b7 1 P1iA )\n+ ( \u03bbiE[xi] (1\u2212 \u03b81i)[ 1\u2212 \u03d5iE [xi] ] \u00b7 1 P2iA )] < 1. (17)\nTC(TA, n) comprises the sum of L products\u2019 setup, variable manufacturing, rework, and disposal costs, holding costs for perfect quality, defective, and reworked items, fixed and variable shipping expenses, and holding cost at the sales locations, as follows:\nTC (TA, n) =\nL\u2211 i=1  KiA + CiAQi + CRiAxiQi (1\u2212 \u03b81i) +CSi (\u03d5ixiQi) + h1i P2iAt2iA 2 (t2iA) +hi [ H1i+d1iAt1iA 2 (t1iA)+ H1i+Hi 2 (t2iA) + ( n\u2212 1 2n ) Hi (t3iA) ] + nK1i +CTiQi (1\u2212 \u03d5ixi) + h2i 2 [ H1it3iA n +TA (Hi \u2212 \u03bbit3iA) ]  .

It shows that E[TCU(T \u2217A, n \u2217)] increases slightly, as \u03d5 raises; and as \u03b11 goes up, the optimal system cost boosts up radically."

An explicit model is developed to carefully express the fabrication, rework, and shipment processes of the problem and their relating expenses. Mathematical derivations enable us to find the long-run average system cost. By employing the Hessian matrix\nequations, we concurrently derive the optimal decision of common cycle length and frequency of delivery. A numerical illustration is offered to confirm the applicability of research outcomes and expose the individual and combined influences of diverse key system features (including the average accelerated rate, mean imperfect quality rate, average scrap proportion, etc. in the fabrication processes) on the problem, thus facilitate the intra-supply chain\u2019s operational decisionmaking."
