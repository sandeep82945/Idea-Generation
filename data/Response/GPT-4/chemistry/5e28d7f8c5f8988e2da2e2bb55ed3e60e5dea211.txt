Development of an Expanded Glycan Database: The creation and maintenance of a comprehensive, open-access glycan database that includes a wider variety of glycan structures, including both N-linked and O-linked glycans. This database would serve as a critical resource for the glycoscience community, enabling more accurate and extensive glycan identification across different biological samples and applications.

Integration of Machine Learning for Enhanced Glycan Analysis: Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of glycan structure prediction and identification in MS/MS data. By training models on large datasets of glycan spectra, this approach could significantly reduce the time required for glycan analysis and enhance the ability to identify novel or rare glycan structures.

Development of a Unified Software Platform for Glycan Analysis Across Different Instrumentation: While the GlyKAn AZ app focuses on Orbitrap and MALDIâ€“TOF MS data, future research could aim to develop a more versatile software tool that is compatible with a broader range of mass spectrometry instruments. This would facilitate the adoption of the software in various analytical laboratories and industries that use different MS technologies.

Automated Reporting and Regulatory Compliance Features: Further development of software tools to include automated generation of comprehensive reports that meet the regulatory requirements for biopharmaceuticals. This would involve the integration of quality control checks, data validation processes, and documentation features that streamline the preparation of materials for regulatory submissions.

Real-Time Glycan Analysis in Bioprocessing: Exploring the potential for real-time glycan analysis in the bioprocessing environment. By integrating the glycan analysis software with bioreactors and process monitoring systems, it would be possible to achieve real-time monitoring and control of glycosylation during the production of biopharmaceuticals. This could greatly enhance the consistency and quality of glycoprotein products.
