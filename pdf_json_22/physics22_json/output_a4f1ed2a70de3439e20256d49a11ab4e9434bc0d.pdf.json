INTRODUCTION\nThe formation of ice is a process of great importance across a broad range of fields from climate science1,2 to biology.3 Obtaining a detailed molecular-level understanding of both homogeneous nucleation (i.e., in the absence of foreign bodies such as mineral particles) and heterogeneous nucleation (i.e., in the presence of surfaces due to foreign bodies) has attracted major research efforts from both experimental and simulation groups.4,5 With regard to the latter, in a bid to reduce computational cost, most molecular simulations employ empirical potentials that approximately describe the interactions between water molecules. While many types of empirical potentials exist,6\u20138 simple point charge (SPC) models are one of the most commonly used. Note that we use \u201cSPC model\u201d to refer to the general class of water models detailed in Sec. I A rather than the specific water model of Ref. 9. In addition to being relatively simple and computationally efficient, an appealing feature of SPC models is that they preserve the donor\u2013acceptor nature of water\u2019s hydrogenbond network, which can be especially important for heterogeneous nucleation, e.g., in the presence of kaolinite.10,11\nTo ensure short-ranged repulsion between molecules, most commonly used SPC water models, at least formally, employ the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential,12\nu(\u221e)LJ (r) = 4\u03b5[( \u03c3 r ) 12 \u2212 ( \u03c3 r ) 6 ], (1)\nwhich is parameterized by an energy scale \u03b5 and length scale \u03c3, where r indicates the distance between two water molecules (usually the separation between their oxygen atoms). Figure 1(a) shows u(\u221e)LJ .\nIn addition to explicit electrostatic interactions between water molecules, the \u2212(\u03c3/r)6 term contributes to the cohesive energy of the system. Despite being the basis for most SPC water models, however, u(\u221e)LJ is rarely sampled explicitly; due to the infinite range of the attractive\u2212(\u03c3/r)6 term, it is common to truncate u(\u221e)LJ in some fashion (see, e.g., Refs. 13 and 14). Two common procedures, which we detail in Sec. I A, are to use \u201ctail corrections\u201d or to \u201ccut-and-shift,\u201d as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. By comparing these plots, it can be seen that, while similar, these two truncation procedures result in different intermolecular potentials and will, in general, have different properties. For example, thermodynamic properties such as interfacial tension and the location of phase boundaries are known to be affected.15\u201320\nWhy then would another article that investigates the effects of truncating the LJ potential be useful? Put simply, the phase behavior of SPC water models has been studied extensively using the\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 164501 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0085750 156, 164501-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:53:57\nFIG. 1. The two variations of the LJ potential studied in this article. (a) The solid blue curve shows u(\u221e)LJ given by Eq. (1). For homogeneous systems, u (\u221e)\nLJ is\nwell-approximated by truncating interactions at a given cutoff (indicated by the arrow) and applying \u201ctail corrections\u201d to account for neglected interactions; this is equivalent to a mean field approximation. Inset: schematic representation of the tail-correction procedure. The blue shaded region indicates that interactions between the tagged particle (dark blue) and those beyond the cutoff radius are accounted for in an average sense. (b) The \u201ccut-and-shift\u201d variant of the LJ potential [see Eq. (7)] has vanishing interactions beyond the cutoff. It is a different potential with different properties compared to u(\u221e)LJ . In both examples, the cutoff radius is 2\u03c3.\ntail-corrected truncation scheme.21\u201324 And the same can be said for most calculations of homogeneous ice nucleation rates.25\u201328 Yet, as we will discuss in more detail in the following, the use of tail corrections makes direct comparison to inhomogeneous systems challenging. While a simple approach to mitigate discrepancies between homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems would be consistent use of cut-and-shift potentials, it is unreasonable to expect that each study of heterogeneous nucleation is accompanied by (i) a full recalculation of the melting temperature or phase diagram and (ii) recomputation of the homogeneous nucleation rate. [To give a sense of perspective, in Ref. 26, over 21 \u00d7 106 central processing unit (CPU) hours were required to compute the homogeneous nucleation rate with forward flux sampling (FFS).] In this article, we address the first issue directly by outlining a procedure to approximately predict the change in melting temperature between the tail-corrected and cut-and-shift systems. We then combine our results with those in Ref. 28 to estimate the impact on the comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation rates."

We are concerned with SPC water models that formally have a potential energy function of the kind\nU(\u221e)(RN) = N\n\u2211 i<j\nu(\u221e)LJ (\u2223r (O) ij \u2223) +\nN\n\u2211 i<j \u2211 \u03b1,\u03b2\nq(\u03b1)q(\u03b2)\n\u2223r(\u03b1)j \u2212 r (\u03b2) i \u2223\n, (2)\nwhere RN denotes the set of atomic positions for a configuration of N water molecules, r(O)ij is the separation vector between the oxygen atoms of molecules i and j, and q(\u03b1)i is the charge of site \u03b1, located at r(\u03b1)i , of molecule i. (We adopt a unit system in which 4\u03c0\u03f50 = 1, where \u03f50 is the permittivity of free space.) The second set of sums in Eq. (2), which we will denote Uelec hereafter, describes electrostatic interactions between molecules, while the first set of sums involves the LJ potential. For SPC models of water, the choice of u(\u221e)LJ is rooted in grounds of convention and convenience, rather than having any deep theoretical justification. Nonetheless, SPC models of the kind formally described by Eq. (2) have been, are, and will likely continue (at least in the near future) to be the foundation for many molecular simulations of water\u2019s condensed phases.\nSo far, we have referred to SPC models of water that are \u201cformally\u201d described by the potential energy given in Eq. (2). But as already mentioned, in practice, u(\u221e)LJ is usually truncated in some fashion.13,14 For the tail-correction scheme, one employs a simple truncation,\nu(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ (r) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 u(\u221e)LJ (r), r \u2264 rc, 0, r > rc,\n(3)\nand then approximately accounts for the effects of truncation by adding a mean field (MF) correction,\n\u0394MFU(rc) N = 8\u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u0304\u03c33 9 [( \u03c3 rc ) 9 \u2212 3( \u03c3 rc ) 3 ], (4)\nto the total potential energy,\nU(\u221e)(RN) \u2248 U(rc\u2192\u221e)(RN)\n= N\n\u2211 i<j\nu(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ (\u2223r (O) ij \u2223) + \u0394MFU(rc) +Uelec(R N ), (5)\nwhere \u03c1\u0304 is the average number density. The superscript \u201c(rc \u2192\u221e)\u201d indicates that when used in combination with \u0394MFU(rc), a system that employs u(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ satisfies U\n(rc\u2192\u221e) \u2248 U(\u221e); this is reasonable provided that gOO(r \u2265 rc) \u2248 1, where gOO is the oxygen\u2013oxygen pair correlation function. In a similar spirit, the pressure can also be corrected in a MF fashion,\n\u0394MFp(rc) = 32\u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u0304 2\u03c33\n9 [( \u03c3 rc ) 9 \u2212 3 2 ( \u03c3 rc ) 3 ]. (6)\nA comment is in order concerning the functional form of u(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ [Eq. (3)]. The discontinuity at rc suggests the presence of impulsive forces. Impulsive forces, however, are challenging to implement\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 164501 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0085750 156, 164501-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:53:57\nin molecular dynamics simulations, and it is standard practice to neglect them entirely. Moreover, as interactions beyond rc are not neglected in U(rc\u2192\u221e) but instead accounted for in a mean field fashion, we argue (see the supplementary material) that this neglect of impulsive forces is, in fact, consistent with the use of \u0394MFU and \u0394MFp as it accounts for a pointwise cancellation of impulsive forces.\nThe alternative cut-and-shift truncation scheme is\nu(rc)LJ (r) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 u(\u221e)LJ (r) \u2212 u (\u221e) LJ (rc), r \u2264 rc, 0, r > rc,\n(7)\nsuch that the total potential energy is\nU(rc)(RN) = N\n\u2211 i<j\nu(rc)LJ (\u2223r (O) ij \u2223) +Uelec(R N ). (8)\nWe will use the superscript \u201c(rc)\u201d to indicate that u(rc)LJ is used. (We will, on occasion, drop the superscript notation either because it is clear from context which truncation scheme is relevant or because it is unimportant to differentiate between truncation schemes. When a numerical value of rc is specified, it will be given in \u00c5ngstrom although we will omit units from the superscript.) For simulations of systems in the canonical (NVT) ensemble, dynamics are unaffected by the choice of U(rc) vs U(rc\u2192\u221e). The pressure, however, is sensitive to the choice of truncation scheme,\np(rc\u2192\u221e) \u2248 p(rc) + \u0394MFp(rc). (9)\nThe implication of Eq. (9) is that dynamics in the isothermal\u2013isobaric (NpT) ensemble are affected by the choice of U(rc) vs U(rc\u2192\u221e). Furthermore, systems employing U(rc\u2192\u221e) and U(rc) will have for the same rc different equations of state.15,16\nImplicit in our above discussion of MF corrections is that the system is homogeneous such that the average equilibrium density \u27e8\u03c1(r)\u27e9 = \u03c1\u0304 does not depend upon the position r in the fluid, as shown in Fig. 2(a). If the system of interest is inhomogeneous, such as liquid water in coexistence with its vapor, a typical simulation approach is to employ the NVT ensemble with a cuboidal cell that has an elongated dimension along the average surface normal; such a scenario is depicted in Fig. 2(b). As \u0394MFU and \u0394MFp do not affect dynamics in the NVT ensemble, effects of using U(rc\u2192\u221e) for inhomogeneous systems would perhaps seem benign, resulting simply in a shift of the energy, i.e., U(rc\u2192\u221e)(RN) \u2212U(\u221e)(RN) = const.\nPotential problems arise, however, concerning thermodynamic consistency between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3 for TIP4P/ice24\u2014a commonly used SPC water model for studying ice formation\u2014at 300 K with rc = 8.5 \u00c5. Figure 3(a) shows the average mass density \u03c1\u0304m(p) obtained from simulations of the homogeneous fluid employing either TIP4P/ice(8.5\u2192\u221e) or TIP4P/ice(8.5). Figure 3(b) shows the equilibrium mass density profile \u27e8\u03c1m(z)\u27e9 for a film of TIP4P/ice (8.5\u2192\u221e) water \u223c40 \u00c5 thick with its liquid/vapor interface spanning the xy plane.29 Owing to the low vapor pressure of water, p \u2248 0 in the vapor phase. As the normal component of the pressure tensor is independent of z for a planar interface and furthermore isotropic for z in a\nFIG. 2. Typical simulation geometries for water. (a) Homogeneous bulk water simulated under 3D bulk periodic boundary conditions such that the average density is independent of position, \u27e8\u03c1(r)\u27e9 = \u03c1\u0304(p). (b) The slab geometry employed to study interfacial systems also employs periodic boundary conditions (often in 3D) and has a density profile that varies with position z along the surface normal such that, in general, \u27e8\u03c1(z)\u27e9 \u2260 \u03c1\u0304. For thick enough slabs, regions far removed from the interfaces (as indicated, e.g., by the orange box) have an average density equal to \u03c1\u0304(p = 0) for the homogeneous system. Green lines indicate the boundaries of the periodically repeated simulation cells.\nbulk-like fluid region, it immediately follows that p \u2248 0 deep in the slab\u2019s interior.30 Thermodynamic consistency then requires that\n1 \u2113bulk \u222b \u2113bulk dz \u27e8\u03c1m(z)\u27e9 = \u03c1\u0304m(p = 0)\nfor TIP4P/ice(8.5\u2192\u221e), where \u2113bulk is a length over which \u27e8\u03c1m(z)\u27e9 is bulk-like, as indicated, e.g., by the orange rectangles in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b). The result of such an averaging procedure is indicated by the orange-filled circle in Fig. 3(a); it is clearly inconsistent with \u03c1\u0304m(p = 0) obtained from the homogeneous TIP4P/ice(8.5\u2192\u221e) simulation. As dynamics in the NVT ensemble are unaffected by the choice of U(rc) vs U(rc\u2192\u221e), we might expect, and indeed observe, that the result is instead consistent with \u03c1\u0304m(p = 0) for TIP4P/ice(8.5).\nWhile schemes for effectively sampling U(\u221e) do exist for heterogeneous systems (e.g., one can treat the attractive \u2212(\u03c3/r)6 term in a Ewald fashion31\u201334 or use mean field corrections that take the heterogeneous nature of the system into account35\u201340), their use is relatively limited compared to that of SPC water models. In addition, as discussed in Sec. I, no discrepancies would be observed with the consistent use of U(rc) for both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems, but information concerning phase behavior and homogeneous nucleation rates relevant to U(rc) systems is scarce. In Sec. II, we therefore assess the effect of using U(rc) instead of U(rc\u2192\u221e) on the melting temperature Tm of ice Ih for SPC models of water. In particular, we focus on TIP4P/ice24 and TIP4P/200523\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 164501 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0085750 156, 164501-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:53:57\nas these are most commonly used in simulations of ice nucleation. We stress, however, that the findings presented in this work readily extend to any SPC water model of the kind formally described by Eq. (2). To illustrate our findings, we will focus exclusively on results for TIP4P/ice in the main article with results for TIP4P/2005 instead given in the supplementary material. In Sec. IV, we then estimate the impact of our findings on the comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation rates.\nAs an aside, before proceeding to discuss our main results, we mention that our initial motivation for this study stemmed from recent work by Wang et al.,41 who developed a new potential that gives broadly similar behavior to the LJ potential but does not suffer, by construction, from ambiguities arising from the choice of truncation scheme. While our preliminary investigations suggested that the approach of Wang et al. could be used to develop workable SPC models of water, we judged their performance insufficiently strong to warrant introducing another set of SPC water models to the\ncommunity. We therefore adopt a more pragmatic approach in this article by instead providing results and insights relevant to existing SPC water models that are heavily used by practitioners of molecular simulations."

            "heading": "II. THE MELTING POINT OF ICE Ih FROM FREE ENERGY CALCULATIONS",
            "text": "The central quantity under investigation in this study is the melting point of ice Ih under conditions of vanishing pressure, p = 0 bar. To obtain estimates of Tm for TIP4P/ice(rc) and TIP4P/2005(rc), we need to establish the chemical potential at p = 0 bar for both the ice [\u03bcice(T)] and liquid [\u03bcliq(T)] phases: the point of intersection is Tm. To compute \u03bcice, we will adopt the Frenkel\u2013Ladd approach, 42 adapted by Vega and co-workers for rigid SPC water models.43\u201345\nAs this approach has been detailed elsewhere, we present a detailed overview of our workflow in the supplementary material and discuss only the most salient aspects of the methodology in the main article.\nFirst, we equilibrate a crystal of ice Ih comprising 768 molecules at a temperature Ti to obtain the average cell parameters. The cell parameters are then fixed to their average values, and the structure is \u201cminimized\u201d by a low temperature simulation at 0.1 K. [We adopt this approach as the standard minimizers in LAMMPS46 are incompatible with the RATTLE algorithm47 used to impose the rigid body constraints of the water molecules.] Our reference structure is then this minimized crystal structure with no intermolecular interactions and with the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of each water molecule tethered to their positions by a harmonic potential with spring constants kO and kH, respectively. The difference in Helmholtz free energy (per molecule) \u0394r2ia between this reference system and the interacting ice crystal of interest is then calculated by thermodynamic integration48 at temperature Ti. The rigid body constraints, however, mean that we do not know the free energy of the reference system. We therefore define a \u201csub-reference\u201d system (with free energy asub that is calculated analytically) in which only the oxygen atoms of the water molecules are tethered and compute the Helmholtz free energy between the sub-reference and reference systems \u0394s2ra also by thermodynamic integration. The free energy of the ice crystal is then\naice = akin + asub + \u0394s2ra + \u0394r2ia \u2212 kBTi ln 3 2 \u2212 kBTi ln 2 (10)\nwith akin = 3kBTi ln(T0/Ti), where T0 is a reference temperature (see the supplementary material). We use T0 = 272 K throughout this article. The final two terms, respectively, account for the Pauling entropy arising from proton disorder in ice Ih and the fact that the reference system does not respect the permutational invariance of the two protons in a water molecule.45 The chemical potential is, in general, obtained from \u03b2\u03bcice = \u03b2aice + \u03b2p/\u03c1\u0304; as p = 0 bar, we simply have \u03b2\u03bcice = \u03b2aice (\u03b2 = 1/kBT, where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant). We note that there have been extensive studies to understand the effects of finite system size on the calculation of free energies for solids (see Ref. 44 for a detailed discussion). Previous simulation studies suggest that the system size we use (768 molecules) is large enough to obtain a reliable estimate of Tm for ice Ih.49 Moreover, it is likely\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 164501 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0085750 156, 164501-4\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:53:57\nthat any finite size effects will largely cancel when comparing the two truncation schemes considered in this study.\nFor the liquid, we equilibrate a system comprising 360 molecules at Ti to obtain an estimate of \u03c1\u0304. At this density, we then calculate the change in free energy \u0394LJ2wa between the LJ fluid and the SPC water model under investigation using thermodynamic integration. For systems that employ U(rc\u2192\u221e), we determine the excess free energy of the LJ fluid a(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ,ex \u2248 a (\u221e)\nLJ,ex from the equation of state. (For consistency with previous calculations of water\u2019s phase diagram,44 we use the equation of state by Johnson et al.16) For systems using U(rc), we must also compute the free energy difference \u0394tc2csa between the U(rc\u2192\u221e) and U(rc) systems. The free energy of the liquid is then\na(rc)liq = aid + a (rc\u2192\u221e) LJ,ex + \u0394tc2csa + \u0394LJ2wa, (11)\nwhere aid = kBTi ln(\u03c1\u0304(T0/Ti)3) \u2212 kBTi (see the supplementary material). An analogous expression holds for a(rc\u2192\u221e)liq , except that \u0394tc2csa is omitted. The chemical potential is simply \u03b2\u03bcliq = \u03b2aliq.\nOnce the chemical potential has been established at Ti, we establish its temperature dependence by integrating the Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation,\n\u03b2\u03bcice(T) = \u03b2i\u03bcice(Ti) \u2212 \u222b T\nTi dt hice(t) kBt2 , (12)\nwhere hice is the enthalpy per molecule of ice and \u03b2i = 1/kBTi. An analogous expression holds for \u03b2\u03bcliq.\nIn Fig. 4(a), we present \u03b2\u03bc(8.5\u2192\u221e)ice (T) and \u03b2\u03bc (8.5\u2192\u221e) liq (T) from which we determine T(8.5\u2192\u221e)m \u2248 273.0 K. This is in good agreement with T(8.5\u2192\u221e)m = 272 \u00b1 6 K at p = 1 bar obtained by Vega and coworkers.22,24 The results for TIP4P/ice(8.5) are shown in Fig. 4(b). It is clear that using U(rc) instead of U(rc\u2192\u221e) results in an apparent increase in the melting temperature with T(8.5)m \u2248 276.0 K. While an increase by \u223c3 K is modest, it is nonetheless comparable to the difference in melting temperature between D2O and H2O.49,50\nWe have not reported an error estimate for either T(8.5\u2192\u221e)m or T(8.5)m . Yet, the similarity of the slopes for \u03b2\u03bcliq and \u03b2\u03bcice seen in Fig. 4 suggests that even small statistical errors in the chemical potential will result in relatively large changes in the estimate of the melting temperature. Instead of performing a thorough error analysis, in Sec. III, we use a combination of a MF approach and Hamiltonian Gibbs\u2013Duhem integration51,52 to argue that the difference in Tm reported above reflects a genuine effect of the choice of truncation scheme."

To validate this MF estimate, we have performed NpT simulations for TIP4P/ice(8.5) at p = p(8.5)\npredicted by Eq. (9). Excellent agreement between the simulation data and MF estimate is observed. This result is perhaps unsurprising and simply reflects that rc = 8.5 A\u030a \u2248 2.7\u03c3 is sufficiently large to ensure gOO(rc) \u2248 1. Nonetheless, it serves as an acute reminder of the effects of the truncation scheme: \u03c1\u0304m(p = 0) for TIP4P/ice(8.5) corresponds to p \u2248 \u2212427 bars for TIP4P/ice(8.5\u2192\u221e); even for a relatively large cutoff rc = 14 A\u030a \u2248 4.4\u03c3, differences of the order 100 bars persist.\nAssuming that a(rc\u2192\u221e)LJ,ex \u2248 a (\u221e)\nLJ,ex , the Helmholtz free energy per particle for a system with potential energy function U(rc) can be estimated at a MF level,16\na(rc)liq \u2248 a (rc\u2192\u221e) liq + \u0394MFa(rc) (13)\nwith\n\u0394MFa(rc) = \u2212 32\u03c0\u03c1\u0304\u03f5\u03c33\n9 [( \u03c3 rc ) 9 \u2212 3 2 ( \u03c3 rc ) 3 ].

In contrast, \u0394MFU approximately accounts for the energy neglected by simply truncating the LJ potential at rc.) In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), we show similar analyses as Fig. 3(a) for the liquid and ice phases of TIP4P/ice, respectively, and temperature Ti = 272 K, which allow us to predict \u03c1\u0304m(p = 0) for both phases of TIP4P/ice(rc).

Results for \u03b2\u03bc(MF,8.5) are shown in Fig. 6 from which we deduce a MF estimate for the melting temperature T(MF,8.5)m = 275.7 K; this is in fair agreement with T (8.5) m = 276.0 K obtained from our free energy calculations. Without performing further simulations, we can use the above procedure to calculate T(MF,rc)m for arbitrary rc, as shown in Fig. 6(b). It can be clearly seen that T(MF,rc)m approaches T (MF,rc\u2192\u221e) m monotonically and slowly with differences of \u223c1 K still observed for rc = 12 A\u030a \u2248 3.8\u03c3.

The observed relative decrease in Tm obtained from Hamiltonian Gibbs\u2013Duhem integration agrees well with that predicted by our MF procedure and provides compelling evidence that reducing rc results in a systematic increase in the melting temperature. As already mentioned, the increase in Tm with decreasing rc is modest. We argue that this is a useful observation as obtaining consistent ice nucleation rates among different studies has proven itself to be challenging.5 Our finding suggests that changes in the degree of supercooling due to differences in rc are an unlikely source of significant discrepancies in nucleation rates between studies. In Sec. IV, we suggest a way in which effects of the truncation scheme can have a material impact on comparing nucleation rates."

In particular, Figs. 3 and 5 suggest that a decrease in rc is analogous to an increase in pressure (for fixed \u03c1\u0304). Conversely, for inhomogeneous systems such as those shown in Fig. 2(b), where U(rc\u2192\u221e) and U(rc) generate the same dynamics, it is more appropriate to compare to homogeneous nucleation rates computed with U(rc\u2192\u221e) at p < 0 bar rather than at p = 0 bar.54\nTo estimate the impact of this effective change in pressure arising from a finite cutoff, we appeal to the recent study by Bianco et al.,28 where homogeneous nucleation across a broad range of pressures and temperatures for TIP4P/ice(9.0\u2192\u221e) was investigated and data for \u03c1\u0304(p), diffusion coefficient D(p), and size of critical cluster nc(p) were given. The homogeneous nucleation rate can then be estimated by\nJ(p) = \u03c1\u0304 f +Z exp(\u2212\u03b2\u0394Gc), (16)\nwhere Z = \u221a\n\u03b2\u2223\u0394\u03bc\u2223/(6\u03c0nc) and f + = 24Dn2/3c /(3.8 A\u030a)2. For simplicity, we have assumed \u2223\u0394\u03bc\u2223 = 0.62 kJ/mol [see Fig. 3(a) of Ref. 28], independent of pressure; this is justified based on previous studies that find changes in ice/water interfacial tension dominate variations in J with p and is supported by our finding that Tm is only weakly affected by rc.27,28 [To gauge the sensitivity of our results to this approximation, the blue shaded region in Fig. 7(b) encompasses predictions obtained with 0.60 kJ/mol \u2264 \u2223\u0394\u03bc\u2223 \u2264 0.64 kJ/mol.] In Fig. 7(a), we show \u03c1\u0304(p) at T = 230 K for TIP4P/ice(rc\u2192\u221e) from Ref. 28 along with MF estimates for TIP4P/ice(8.5) and TIP4P/ice(11.0). From Fig. 7(a), it can clearly be seen that \u03c1\u0304(p = 0) for TIP4P/ice(8.5) and TIP4P/ice(11.0) correspond to p \u2248 \u2212400 bars and p \u2248 \u2212200 bars, respectively. In Fig. 7(b), we plot log10[J(p)/J(0)] according to Eq. (16) from which we estimate that homogeneous nucleation is faster in TIP4P/ice(8.5) and TIP4P/ice(11.0) by approximately four and two orders of magnitude, respectively.\nThe implication of the preceding analysis is that enhancement due to heterogeneous nucleation may, in fact, be lower than previously thought. For example, Sosso et al.55 used a variation of the cut-and-shift potential56 with rc \u2248 11 \u00c5 to investigate ice nucleation at 230 K in the presence of kaolinite using FFS and TIP4P/ice. By comparing to the homogeneous nucleation rate obtained by Haji-Akbari and Debenedetti for TIP4P/ice(8.5\u2192\u221e) with FFS, an enhancement of 20 orders of magnitude was reported; we estimate this result is too high by approximately two orders of magnitude. Similarly, Haji-Akbari and Debenedetti also investigated nucleation in free standing thin films of TIP4P/ice(8.5) water57 and found an increase of approximately seven orders of magnitude, despite nucleation occurring in bulk-like regions; Fig. 7(b) suggests the nucleation rate of the reference homogeneous system at p = \u2212400 bars would also be faster by approximately four orders of magnitude.\nThis discussion on the impact of the truncation scheme on the nucleation rate is admittedly crude and relies on the analogy that a change in rc simply amounts to a change in pressure. In practice, it is likely that relevant quantities, e.g., ice\u2013liquid interfacial tension, will differ between TIP4P/ice(rc\u2192\u221e) at p < 0 bar and TIP4P/ice(rc) at p = 0 bar. While the estimates presented above may provide a useful first-order approximation, they await full validation by explicit calculation of nucleation rates using consistent truncation schemes for\nFIG. 7.

Specifically, we have compared results from two truncation schemes: simple truncation at rc with \u201ctail corrections\u201d and \u201ccut-and-shift\u201d at rc. We have combined explicit free energy calculations, Hamiltonian Gibbs\u2013Duhem integration, and a simple mean field analysis to show that a finite cutoff results in an increase in the melting temperature. While we have focused on TIP4P/ice and TIP4P/2005, the effects described in this article should be applicable to any reasonable SPC model of water. Moreover, while not an SPC model, we note that the coarse grained mW model6\u2014another water model commonly used to investigate ice nucleation\u2014is inherently short-ranged with intermolecular interactions that vanish beyond 4.32 \u00c5.

Going forward, those simulating heterogeneous nucleation either need to employ a truncation scheme that effectively samples U(rc\u2192\u221e),31\u201340 or reference data for homogeneous nucleation rates for U(rc)-based SPC models need to be computed explicitly. As a stop-gap solution, one can use the crude but cost-effective estimate for the impact on comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation rates outlined in this article.\nInconsistencies arising from the choice of truncation scheme are not the only challenges faced when comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. In particular, we note that HajiAkbari has shown that conventional FFS approaches can underestimate nucleation rates by failing to account for the \u201cjumpiness\u201d of the order parameter, the severity of which is system dependent.58 While such subtleties in rate calculations further complicate quantitative comparison of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation rates, our work, nonetheless, provides an important contribution toward resolving inconsistencies between homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. Our results will also facilitate consistent comparison of different studies of heterogeneous ice nucleation."
