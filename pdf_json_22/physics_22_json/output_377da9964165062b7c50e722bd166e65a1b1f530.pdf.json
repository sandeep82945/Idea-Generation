    "abstractText": "The developing of (non-Markovian) memory effects strongly depends on the underlying systemenvironment dynamics. Here we study this problem in multipartite arrangements where all subsystems are coupled to each other by non-diagonal Markovian (Lindblad) dephasing mechanisms. Taking as system and environment arbitrary sets of complementary subsystems it is shown that both operational and non-operational approaches to quantum non-Markovianity can be characterized in an exact analytical way. Similarly to previous studies about dissipative-entanglement-generation in this kind of dynamics [Seif, Wang, and Clerk, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 070402 (2022)], we found that memory effects can only emerge when a time-reversal symmetry is broken. Nevertheless, it is also found that departures from Markovianity can equivalently be represented through a statistical mixture of Markovian dephasing dynamics, which does not involve any system-environment entanglement. Specific bipartite and multipartite dynamics exemplify the main general results.",

Here we study this problem in multipartite arrangements where all subsystems are coupled to each other by non-diagonal Markovian (Lindblad) dephasing mechanisms. Taking as system and environment arbitrary sets of complementary subsystems it is shown that both operational and non-operational approaches to quantum non-Markovianity can be characterized in an exact analytical way. Similarly to previous studies about dissipative-entanglement-generation in this kind of dynamics [Seif, Wang, and Clerk, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 070402 (2022)], we found that memory effects can only emerge when a time-reversal symmetry is broken. Nevertheless, it is also found that departures from Markovianity can equivalently be represented through a statistical mixture of Markovian dephasing dynamics, which does not involve any system-environment entanglement. Specific bipartite and multipartite dynamics exemplify the main general results.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the last years remarkable advancements has been achieved in the study and characterization of open quantum systems [1\u20133]. In particular, the old association of memory effects with time-convoluted contributions in the time-evolution of the system density matrix [4] has been surpassed. Instead, quantum non-Markovianity can now be understood from two alternative powerful theoretical main streamlines.\nFirst, in non-operational approaches, memory effects are only determined by taking into account the (unperturbed) system density propagator. Markovianity (memoryless regime) is univocally associated to quantum semigroup structures [5]. Thus, deviations in the propagator properties with respect to this reference are used to quantify the magnitude of memory effects [6, 7]. Diverse witnesses have been proposed, such as the trace distance between two initial states [8], the divisibility of the propagator [9], non-Markovianity degree [10], the quantum regression theorem [11, 12], and the sign of the rates in a canonical Lindblad structure [13], just to name a few. Secondly, operational approaches have been introduced more recently. Here, the system of interest is subjected to a set of explicit measurement processes. Markovianity is related to the usual concept in terms of probabilities [4]. Thus, memory effects are characterized from the joint probabilities of the measurement outcomes [14\u201320].\nBoth operational and non-operational approaches to quantum non-Markovianity provide complementary and valid frames to understand memory effects. Nevertheless, different conclusions can be obtained in some cases. For example, the conditions under which memory effects can be interpreted in terms of an environment-tosystem backflow of information strongly differ in both schemes [21\u201327].\nIn the operational approach the absence of any (physical) environment-to-system backflow of information was\nassociated to (non-Markovian) casual bystander environments [28], that is, those whose self-dynamics do not depend at all on the system degrees of freedom. A measurement based procedure enables to detecting this condition [29]. In addition, it allows to determine if the environment action, when considering the outcome statistics, can be represented in terms of this kind of \u201cpassive environments,\u201d such as for example statistical mixtures of different Markovian evolutions (unitary [27] or dissipative Lindblad ones). This kind of evolutions, in the unitary case, has also been studied from the perspective of memory effects in non-operational approaches [30]. Interestingly, with a totally different motivation, the possibility of representing an open quantum system dynamics in terms of a statistical mixture (random noisy ensembles) of Markovian evolutions has been associated to the classicality of the system-environment interaction [31\u201336].\nAll previous issues have been mainly discussed in single open quantum systems. Nevertheless, given that quantum information becomes relevant when implemented in multipartite arrangements, there has been a growing interest in the study of this kind of dynamics (from an open system perspective), both from unitary and dissipative (or effective) underlying descriptions [37\u201347]. The main goal of this work is to contribute to this research line by providing a full characterization of quantum nonMarkovianity, jointly with the previous topics, in a class of multipartite dissipative dynamics [47].\nIn Ref. [47] the authors study a multipartite qubit dynamics, where all subsystems are coupled between them by non-diagonal dephasing mechanisms. Depending on the dimensionality (number of qubits) and coupling parameters the dynamics may lead to the emergence of transientmultipartite entanglement [48]. This property is read as a signature of the nonclassicality of the evolution. Here, by considering both Hamiltonian and dissipative couplings [see Eqs. (1) and (2)] we show that, for any kind of subsystems (qubits or arbitrary ones), the multipartite\n2 dynamics can be diagonalized in an exact analytical way. Consequently, both operational and non-operational approaches to quantum non-Markovianity can be tackled in the same way. Similarly to the study of entanglement generation [47], we find that the break of a time-reversal symmetry plays a fundamental role when considering the emergence of memory effects. In contrast, the possibility of representing the dynamic of an arbitrary set of subsystems in terms of a statistical mixture of Markovian dephasing dynamics is also established. The paper is outlined as follows. In Sec. II the multipartite dynamics is solved in an exact way. Introducing an arbitrary system-environment splitting, conditions for the emergence of memory effects in non-operational approaches are obtained. In Sec. III we characterize memory effects when considering successive measurement processes performed over the subsystems of interest. In Sec. IV we study bipartite and multipartite specific examples. In Sec. V we provide the Conclusions. Extensions and calculation details are provided in the Appendixes."

The expression (8) allows us to analyze diverse aspects of the dynamics in an explicit analytical way. It is valid for arbitrary operators {S(i)} and coupling matrixes {hij} and {\u0393ij}.

Nevertheless, after providing a specific underlying model [Eq. (1)], it can always be calculated in an exact analytical way. In spite of the previous limitation, it is possible to establish a necessary condition for the developing of memory effects.

In Eq. (21), the sum contribution proportional to (hij + hji)/2 corresponds to the system-environment coupling induced by the Hamiltonian term. On the other hand, the dissipative coupling induced by the nondiagonal structure is proportional to the imaginary part (\u0393ij \u2212\u0393ji)/2 of the coupling rates. It is completely independent of the corresponding real part (\u0393ij +\u0393ji). Thus, system-environment correlations induced by the real part of {\u0393ij} does not lead to memory effects. In addition, memory effects can only emerge when the a time-reversal symmetry is broken. In fact, this symmetry is broken when the matrix {\u0393ij} is a complex one. Interestingly, the same conditions were found in Ref. [47] when considering the production of transient entanglement. An relevant conclusion can also be obtained from Eq. (21). While the unitary and dissipative couplings may lead to different system-environment correlations, they may induce exactly the same non-Markovian system dynamics. In fact, in Eq.

Consequently, under the mapping i(hij + hji)/2 \u2194 \u2212(\u0393ij \u2212 \u0393ji)/2, exactly the same system memory effects are induced by the unitary and dissipative couplings respectively [see Eqs.

Consistently, the environment state and dynamics depend on the system degrees of freedom (see Appendix B). In particular, between the successive measurement processes the environment state is actively modified. In spite of the previous properties, we notice that the same outcome probability [Eq. (29)] can be obtained from an alternative underlying dynamics. In fact, the expression for P (z, y, x) can be read as a statistical mixture (random superposition) of different system dephasing Markovian dynamics [compare with Eq. (31)], each one with dephasing rates \u03a6s\u0303b,sb, where the statistical weight of each one is given by the population \u3008b|\u03c1e0|b\u3009. Thus, one can obtain the same joint statistics by considering an \u201cenvironment\u201d whose participation in the developing of memory effects is completely passive, which in turn does not involve any system-environment entanglement. The same affirmation is valid for the system state \u03c1 (s) t [see Eqs. (15) and (16)]. The reading of the system dynamics in terms of a statistical mixture of Markovian dynamics can be seen as a non-unitary extension of the Hamiltonian ensemble introduced in Ref. [31]. Interestingly, this kind of equivalence can be detected through the measurement scheme. Considering the results of Ref. [29], a random selection of the system state after the second measurement should render the statistics Markovian. Explicitly, in Eq. (29), the following two changes are introduced\n\u03c1y \u2192 \u03c1y\u0306, Ey \u2192 \u2211\ny\nEy = Is.

As expected, this final expression has the structure P (z, y\u0306, x) r = P (z|y\u0306)\u2118(y\u0306|x)P (x), that is, independently of the measurement process and chosen probability \u2118(y\u0306|x), a Markov property is induced. In general, this Markovian property is not fulfilled. When it applies, it provides an experimental technique [29] for detecting when an environment can be replaced by a passive, or in general, by a casual bystander one [28].

On the other hand, from the point of view of the system dynamics the parameters \u2126 and \u03c7I play exactly the same role. In fact, the sign of both parameters is arbitrary. Nevertheless, notice that the underlying coupling processes associated to these two constants, and the system-environment correlations induced by each one, are different in general.\nTwo qubits\nAs an specific example we consider that both subsystems are qubits. For simplicity both operators S and B are taken as a z-Pauli matrix (\u03c3z) in the corresponding Hilbert spaces. Thus, s = \u00b11 and b = \u00b11. Using the partial transpose criteria [48] in Eq. (34), it follows that system-environment entanglement can only be induced by the Hamiltonian H [Eq. (35)]. Complementarily, the dissipative non-diagonal coupling is unable to generate entanglement in this case. The system density matrix [Eq. (15)] reads\n\u03c1 (s) t =\n(\np+ c0f(t) c\u22170f \u2217(t) p\u2212\n)\n, (40)\nwhere p\u00b1 \u2261 \u3008\u00b1|\u03c1 (s) 0 |\u00b1\u3009 and c0 \u2261 \u3008+|\u03c1 (s) 0 |\u2212\u3009 are respectively the initial populations and coherence of the system in the eigenbase of \u03c3z .

In this expression and the following ones, for shortening the expression we introduced the parameter \u03c7\nI \u2261 (\u03c7I \u2212 \u2126).\n7 a. Non-operational approach to memory effects From Eq.

(44)\nConsistently, both \u03c9(t) and \u03b3(t) only depends on the characteristic rates \u03b3 and \u03c7\nI . On the other hand, the\nenvironment populations {q\u00b1} also govern the emergence of memory effects. In fact, when q\u00b1 = 1, q\u2213 = 0, it follows \u03c9(t) = \u22132\u03c7\nI , and \u03b3(t) = \u03b3. Hence, the system\ndynamics is Markovian. In general, the rate \u03b3(t) may assume both positive an negative values, which can be used as a witness of memory effects [13]. In Fig. 1(a) and (b) we plot both the frequency \u03c9(t) and the rate \u03b3(t) for two different values of the (scaled) non-diagonal coupling \u03c7\nI /\u03b3. Depending\non its value, a transition from Markovian [\u03b3(t) \u2265 0] to non-Markovian dynamics [\u03b3(t) \u2277 0] is clearly observed. b. Operational approach to memory effects For implementing the operational approach, we assume that the three measurements are projective ones. They are performed successively in the Bloch directions x\u0302 \u2212 n\u0302 \u2212 x\u0302, where n\u0302 = (cos(\u03c6), sin(\u03c6), 0) is an arbitrary direction in x\u0302-y\u0302 plane defined by the angle \u03c6. The successive measurement outcomes are x = \u00b11, y = \u00b11, and z = \u00b11. Using the corresponding measurement projectors {\u03a0m = |m\u3009\u3008m|} associated to each direction [49], from the general expression (29), using Eq. (39), we get\nP (z, y, x)\nP (x) =\n1 4 [1 + yxf (+) \u03c6 (t) + zyf (\u2212) \u03c6 (\u03c4) + zxf\u03c6(t, \u03c4)].\n(45) Here, the auxiliary functions are\nf (\u00b1) \u03c6 (t) = e \u22122t\u03b3{q+ cos[2t\u03c7I(\u00b1)\u03c6] + q\u2212 cos[2t\u03c7I(\u2213)\u03c6]},\nwhile the last one is\nf\u03c6(t, \u03c4) = e \u22122\u03b3(t+\u03c4)[q+ cos(2t\u03c7I + \u03c6) cos(2\u03c4\u03c7I \u2212 \u03c6)\n+q\u2212 cos(2t\u03c7I \u2212 \u03c6) cos(2\u03c4\u03c7I + \u03c6)].\nTaking \u03c7 I = 0 in Eq.

It is defined as\nCpf (t, \u03c4)|y = \u2211\nz,x\nzx[P (z, x|y)\u2212 P (z|y)P (x|y)]. (46)\nHere, {z} and {x} represent the possible outcomes in the last (future) and first (past) measurement processes respectively, while the conditional y is an arbitrary outcome of the intermediate (present) measurement. From Bayes rule, the Markov property P (z, y, x) = P (z|y)P (y|x)P (x) can be rephrased as a conditional past-future independence, P (z, x|y) = P (z|y)P (x|y), which lead to Cpf (t, \u03c4)|y = 0. Hence, the condition Cpf (t, \u03c4)|y 6= 0 implies the presence of memory effects.\nUsing that P (z, x|y) = P (z, y, x)/P (y), where P (y) = \u2211\nz,x P (z, y, x), from Eq. (45) the correlation (46) reads\nCpf (t, \u03c4)|y = \u2212(4q+q\u2212) sin 2(\u03c6)e\u22122\u03b3(t+\u03c4)\n\u00d7 sin(2t\u03c7 I ) sin[2\u03c4\u03c7 I ].

In Fig. 1(c) and (d) we plot Cpf (t, \u03c4)|y at equal measurement timeintervals, \u03c4 = t. The non-diagonal coupling is in correspondence with Fig. 1(a) and (b) respectively. Consistently with previous general results, for any nonvanishing value of \u03c7\nI /\u03b3 6= 0, in contrast to the nega-\ntive rate criteria, here the dynamics is non-Markovian, Cpf (t, \u03c4)|y 6= 0.\n8"

            "text": "We studied the emergence and properties of memory effects in a class of multipartite arrangements where all subsystems are coupled to each other by non-diagonal Lindblad dephasing mechanisms [Eq. (1)]. By choosing an appropriate basis for the total Hilbert space, the multipartite density matrix was obtained in an exact analytical way [Eq. (8)]. An arbitrary number of subsystems are associated to the system of interest, while the rest define its environment. This splitting [Eq. (9)] provided the basis for characterizing in an exact way both non-operational and operational approaches to quantum non-Markovianity. In non-operational approaches to quantum nonMarkovianity, memory effects are determined from the properties of the system density matrix evolution. We showed that its general structure can be written as a nondiagonal time-dependent dephasing evolution [Eq. (17)]. Its characteristic parameters are set by the corresponding system coherence behaviors [Eq. (19)]. A necessary condition for the emergence of memory effects can be cast in terms of the multipartite dephasing rates [Eq. (20)]. Explicitly, memory effects may be induced by Hamiltonian couplings or when the dissipative coupling breaks a time-reversal symmetry, that is, the non-diagonal coupling rates must be complex ones. In these dynamics, these conditions are also necessary for the development of transient entanglement [47]. In operational approaches to quantum nonMarkovianity, memory effects are determine from a set of measurement processes performed over the system of interest. We calculated in an explicit analytical way the joint probability of measurement outcomes [Eq. (29)]. In this case the previous conditions for the emergence of memory effects become sufficient, that is, any non-vanishing unitary or dissipative coupling consistent with the break of time-reversal symmetry lead to departures from Markovianity. While the multipartite dynamics lead to entanglement generation, we concluded that this feature is not relevant when considering the properties of system memory effects. In fact, both the density matrix dynamics and the statistics of measurement outcomes [Eqs. (15) and (29)] can alternatively be obtained from a statistical mixture of Markovian dephasing evolutions. This equivalent representation does not involve any entanglement. In addition, in the operational approach, this property imply that memory effects can be obtained without the occurrence of any physical environment-to-system backflow of information. As examples we studied bipartite and multipartite dynamics [with coupling rates given by Eqs. (37) and (49)], where each subsystem is a qubit. The properties of the corresponding memory effects support the previous main results (Figs. 1 to 3). Understanding the role of system-environment correlations in the developing of memory effects is a central\nproblem in open quantum system theory. The present analysis shed light on possible memory features that can emerge in systems embedded in multipartite dissipative arrangements. Their validity can in principle be checked in optical setups where this kind of dynamics can be implemented [47]."
