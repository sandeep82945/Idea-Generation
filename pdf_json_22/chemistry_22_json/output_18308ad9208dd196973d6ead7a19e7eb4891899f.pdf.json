    "abstractText": "The anode-free design is a promising strategy to increase the energy density of aqueous Zn metal batteries (AZMBs). However, the scarcity of Zn-rich cathodes and the rapid loss of limited Zn greatly hinder their commercial applications. To address these issues, a novel anode-free Zniodine battery (AFZIB) was designed via a simple, low-cost and scalable approach. Iodine plays bifunctional roles in improving the AFZIB overall performance: enabling high-performance Zn-rich cathode and modulating Zn deposition behavior. On the cathode side, the ZnI2 serves as Zn-rich cathode material. The graphene/polyvinyl pyrrolidone heterostructure was employed as an efficient host for ZnI2 to enhance electron conductivity and suppress the shuttle effect of iodine species. On the anode side, trace I3 additive in the electrolyte creates surface reconstruction on the commercial Cu foil. The in situ formed zincophilic Cu nanocluster allows ultralowoverpotential and uniform Zn deposition and superior reversibility (average coulombic efficiency > 99.91% over 7,000 cycles). Based on such a configuration, AFZIB exhibits significantly increased energy density (162 Wh kg\u22121) and durable cycle stability (63.8% capacity retention after 200 cycles) under practical application conditions. Considering the low cost and simple preparation methods of the electrode materials, this work paves the way for the practical application of AZMBs.",

            "text": "Subject to the safety and limited availability of lithium metal [1], researchers have increasingly focused on the development of new battery systems, such as sodium, potassium, zinc, and magnesium batteries. Among them, rechargeable Zn metal batteries (RZMBs) exhibit excellent safety with their unique aqueous electrolyte, while combining low cost and high specific capacity [2]. These advantages make RZMBs an important complement to lithium batteries, especially in the field of large-scale energy storage [3]. Although the performance of RZMBs has been greatly improved, the instability [4] of the Zn anodes is still the bottleneck restricting their commercialization [5, 6]. One of the important and unresolved issues is that previous reports generally use thick Zn foils (> 100\u00a0\u03bcm) as the anode [7], which leads to high negative to positive capacity ratios (N/P > 50) [8]. The large excess of Zn can compensate for the rapid loss of Zn during cycling to achieve excellent cell performance [9]. Nevertheless, these performances cannot be used as references for practical applications because the imbalanced N/P ratio will greatly limit the actual energy density of RZMBs [10]. Therefore, achieving RZMBs with low N/P ratio is critical to advancing practical progress.\nAs a hostless anode, the thinner Zn foil tends to fragment and pulverize during deep discharge process, resulting in severe surface corrosion and even forming isolated dead Zn [11]. Due to the limited amount of Zn, the thin Zn foil (10\u00a0\u03bcm) cannot release its theoretical capacity upon cycling, thus it is difficult to match the cathode capacity to assemble a low N/P ratio full cell. In current studies, low N/P ratios are controlled by electrochemically pre-depositing limited Zn on conductive substrates [12]. Such a costly and complex process is only suitable for laboratory-level studies. A more promising strategy is the anode-free Zn batteries (AFZBs) [13]. The Zn-rich cathode materials serve as the Zn source, and the Zn metal anode is replaced by a deposition substrate [14]. Due to the absence of Zn foils, this strategy maximizes the energy density of the battery.\nHowever, achieving high-performance AFZBs is more challenging. On the anode side, because there is no excess Zn, corrosion, dendrites and side reactions [15] would lead to large amounts of Zn loss and accelerate capacity degradation. As a result, the AFZBs demonstrate a very short cycle life [10]. Therefore, suppressing Zn loss and\nimproving the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Zn deposition/ dissolution are the keys to prolonging battery lifespan. In the current research works of AFZBs, Cui et\u00a0al. introduced carbon disks on the copper (Cu) substrate as uniform nucleation sites for Zn, achieving a CE as high as 99.6% [16] in the 3\u00a0M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. Feng et\u00a0al. employed a silver-coated Cu substrate and 3\u00a0M Zn(TFSI)2 electrolyte to achieve a CE of 99.86% [17]. However, the expensive electrolytes and complex electrode processes used in these efforts greatly increase the cost of full cells, which reduces the commercialization potential of AFZBs. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore low-cost, scalable methods to improve Zn deposition/dissolution CE.\nOn the cathode side, unlike various types of Li-rich cathodes [18], such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), lithium manganate (LiMn2O4) and lithium cobaltate (LiCoO2), there are few reported high-performance Zn-rich cathodes [19]. For example, the Zn manganate (ZnMn2O4) cathode possesses a complete spinel structure, resulting in slow kinetics of Zn2+ extraction, poor reversibility and low specific capacity [20]; the ZnCo2O4 cathode is unstable in aqueous electrolytes and requires appropriate lattice modification (e.g., Al insertion [21]) to improve its stability. Furthermore, in some AFZB studies, Zn-rich manganese cathodes were obtained by pre-zincificated \u03b2-MnO2 [16], but such a complex and unstable procedure is unsuitable to scale up in practical applications. In this context, Zn-rich cathodes with stable Zn2+ supply and simple processes are urgently needed for the development of AFZBs.\nHerein, from the perspective of overcoming both the cathode and anode issues of AFZBs, we report a novel, low-cost, scale-up concept to design anode-free Zn-iodine battery (AFZIB) with high energy density and long lifespan\u00a0(Fig.\u00a01). On the cathode side, we propose a ZnI2 cathode and design a unique graphene/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (G/PVP) heterostructure as the host. PVP can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of iodine species, while G can enhance the electronic conductivity and structure stability. Therefore, the G/PVP@ ZnI2 cathode can deliver high specific capacity (146.1 mAh g\u22121 ZnI2 at 1 A g\u22121, all the specific capacities are based on the mass of ZnI2) and excellent cycling performance (80% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles at 1 A g\u22121). On the anode side, we employed Cu foil as the deposition substrate and added a trace amount of I3\u2212 (10\u00a0mM) to the electrolyte, which reacted with Cu surface to produce copper iodide (CuI). The CuI was reduced and reconstructed into Cu nanoclusters (CuNC) via\n1 3\nin\u00a0situ electrochemical reduction, which can modulate the Zn deposition behavior with ultralow nucleation overpotential and uniform morphology. The CE is ultra-high and stable with an average value > 99.91% for 7,000 cycles. Due to the multiple functions of iodine at both cathodes and anodes, the AFZIB exhibits excellent cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 63.8% after 200 cycles) and high specific capacity (125.7 mAh g\u22121 at 1\u00a0A g\u22121). More importantly, based on practical application level, the energy density of our AFZIB is significantly improved (162 Wh kg\u22121, based on active material), compared to traditional ZIBs (15 Wh kg\u22121 with a N/P of 50)."

            "heading": "3.1 In situ Surface Reconstruction of\u00a0Cu Foil",
            "text": "As a low-cost and stable current collector for commercial lithium-ion batteries, Cu foil is also considered an ideal deposition substrate for Zn anodes in ZMBs [23]. For example, the recently reported Cu nanowires [24] or carbon fibers doped with Cu nanoboxes [12] show highly zincophilic features, which achieves uniform Zn deposition [25] with high CE. However, the finely designed Cu nanostructures in these efforts often require high costs and complex synthesis processes, such as the hydrothermal method [24] or high-temperature calcination [12]. Inspired by the previously reported study that employed I3\u2212 to suppress hydrogen evolution of Zn anodes [26], we thus propose to use I3\u2212 electrolyte additive to obtain zincophilic Cu nanocluster structures on the surface of commercial Cu foils via a simple in\u00a0situ electrochemical reduction approach. The surface reconstruction process is simple and fast. Firstly, a trace amount of I3\u2212 ions (10\u00a0mM) was added to the 2\u00a0M ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte. Due to the strong oxidizing properties of I3\u2212, the Cu foil reacted with the I3\u2212 rapidly to produce CuI on its surface. Figure\u00a02a, d shows the in\u00a0situ reaction process between I3\u2212 and Cu foil during the cell assembly process. After adding electrolyte to the separator (the separator ensures the uniform reaction between I3\u2212 and Cu foil surface), the rufous electrolyte faded within 5\u00a0min, corresponding to the color change from pink to purplish red on the surface of the Cu foil. In the XRD pattern of the iodine-treated Cu foil (Fig.\u00a02b), the characteristic peaks at 25.4\u00b0 and 42.3\u00b0 are attributed\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00948-9\u00a9 The authors\nto the (111) and (220) crystal planes of CuI [27], respectively. The high-resolution XPS spectra verified the strong Cu1+2p3/2 (932.3\u00a0eV) and Cu1+2p1/2 (932.3\u00a0eV) peaks [28] (Fig. S1), which also indicate the existence of CuI.\nNext, in\u00a0situ electrochemical reduction of the iodinetreated copper foil was performed in the Cu/Zn half\u00a0cell. Notably, the open circuit potential of CuI/Zn half\u00a0cell is reduced from 0.9 to 0.6\u00a0V compared to the untreated Cu/Zn half\u00a0cell. According to previous reports, CuI, as a conversion electrode material, can undergo a reversible redox reaction with Zn2+ to generate Cu [27]. When discharging the cell at a current density of 1\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122, the CuI/Zn half\u00a0cell exhibits a significant discharge plateau in the voltage range\nof 0.4\u20130.5\u00a0V (Fig.\u00a03a), which can attribute to the reduction of CuI. In order to demonstrate that the reduction products at \u2212\u00a00.1\u00a0V are Cu, the surface layer of I3\u2212 treated Cu foil was separated from the Cu substrate by transparent adhesive tape. In the XRD pattern (Fig. S2), the I3\u2212 treated surface Cu foil shows the standard CuI characteristic peaks. After the reduction to 0.1\u00a0V, the CuI characteristic peaks are replaced by the characteristic peaks of Cu, indicating the reduction from CuI to Cu. For comparison, no characteristic peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of the transparent adhesive tape from the bare Cu surface. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve (Fig.\u00a02c) of the CuI-Zn half\u00a0cell further confirms the electrochemical conversion between CuI and\n1 3\nCu [29]. It is worth noting that the redox reaction of Cu to CuI occurs above 0.5\u00a0V, thus in order to ensure that Cu is no longer converted to CuI, the cutoff voltage is controlled below 0.5\u00a0V in the next half\u00a0cell tests.\nWe next employed the ex-situ SEM characterization to visualize the evolution of the surface morphology of the Cu foil during iodine treatment (Fig.\u00a02e). As shown in Figs.\u00a02f\u2013h and S3, the iodine-treated Cu foil changed from an intrinsically flat surface to a stack of micron-sized\npolyhedral particles. After the electrochemical reduction of CuI to 0.1\u00a0 V, the micron-sized CuI particles were transformed into porous Cu nanoclusters (CuNCs). Actually, the electroreduction of CuI is an outside-in process [29]. Specifically, as shown in Fig. S4, due to the dense structure of CuI, Zn2+ can only react with the outer layer of CuI to generate loose Cu nanostructure on the surface, which allows Zn2+ to cross the outer layer and further reduce the inner layer of CuI. Thus, with the layer-by-layer reduction of CuI,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00948-9\u00a9 The authors\n1 3\nthe CuI micron particles turn into loose Cu nanoclusters. Based on the above results, a nanostructured CuNC@Cu electrode is constructed by a simple in\u00a0situ electrochemical reduction method."

            "text": "We then performed Zn deposition/dissolution tests and investigated the Zn deposition behavior by ex-situ XRD and SEM characterization in the CuNC@Cu/Zn half cells. For the CuNC@Cu electrode, a weak discharge capacity between 0 and 0.1\u00a0V is observed in the discharging curve (Fig.\u00a03a). And such a discharge plateau consistently appears in subsequent cycles of CuNC@Cu/Zn half cells (Fig. S5). The corresponding redox peaks between 0 and 0.1\u00a0V can also be observed in the CV curve (Fig.\u00a02c), which are attributed to the alloying and de-alloying processes of Cu and Zn [30]. In contrast, the voltage of the untreated Cu/Zn half-cell was instantaneously discharged to 0.01\u00a0V, without the alloying plateau. This is because compared to Cu foils, the Cu nanostructures with high specific surface area have more exposed edges of crystal planes in addition to the typical (100), (110), and (111) planes (Fig.\u00a03d), and these edge sites have higher binding energy for Zn atoms [24], thus showing excellent zincophilic properties and lower alloying barrier with Zn [31, 32].\nZn deposition was performed at a current density of 5\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122. For the untreated Cu electrode, a significant nucleation peak appears in the deposition curve with an overpotential as high as 84\u00a0mV. In contrast, on the CuNC@ Cu electrode, the abundant zincophilic edge sites on CuNC and the formed Cu\u2013Zn alloys can serve as nucleation sites, which greatly reduce the nucleation barriers, resulting in negligible Zn nucleation overpotential (8\u00a0mV) in the deposition curve of CuNC@Cu electrode (Fig.\u00a0 3b). Furthermore, such an ultralow nucleation overpotential and alloying process are also observed in subsequent cycles (Fig. S6), indicating the stability of the CuNC@ Cu structure and the reversible formation of Cu\u2013Zn alloys. After nucleation, the Zn deposition morphology was observed by SEM. A large number of crystal nuclei appear on the surface of the untreated Cu electrode (Figs.\u00a03j and S7), with Zn growing undirected around the crystal nuclei and accumulating as large dendrites. In contrast, for the CuNC@Cu electrode (Figs.\u00a03g and S9a), due to a large\nnumber of exposed zincophilic sites and ample space for Zn deposition in the CuNC, Zn shows a flaky deposition morphology and horizontally lays on the surface of CuNC, and the corresponding elemental mapping images show the uniform distribution of Zn elements in the CuNC structure, indicating the co-existence of Cu\u2013Zn alloy. The XRD pattern (Fig. S9b) also shows the characteristic peaks of Zn (002 plane at 36.2\u00b0) and CuZn5 (42.0\u00b0), respectively. In addition, it is worthy to note that even in the stable Zn deposition stage, the deposition potential (Fig.\u00a03c) of CuNC@Cu electrode (64\u00a0mV) is also significantly lower than that of the untreated Cu electrode (94\u00a0mV). And after stable deposition for 30\u00a0s, the Zn flakes further grow and uniformly cover the entire surface of CuNC (Fig. S10). After 12\u00a0min of deposition, with an area deposition capacity of 1 mAh cm\u22122, the characteristic XRD peaks at 37.8\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 of CuZn5 are detected on the CuNC@Cu electrode (Figs.\u00a02i and S11d), which further confirm the continued alloying process of CuNC. Meanwhile, the SEM images and corresponding element mapping images (Figs.\u00a02h and S12) show that the Zn flakes are not simply covered on the surface of CuNC, but a large number of Cu nanoparticles are dispersed between the Zn flakes, resulting in a horizontally stacked Zn/Cu composite structure. In contrast, no Cu\u2013Zn alloys are observed in XRD pattern of the untreated Cu electrode (Figs.\u00a02i and S8b). In its SEM images (Figs.\u00a02k and S10a), Zn deposits as vertical blade-like dendrites and further gathers into large flower-like dendrites, which can result in dead Zn and short circuit of the cell.\nThe above results confirm that the CuNC@Cu electrode can achieve uniform Zn deposition with ultralow nucleation overpotential. In addition, as an important index to evaluate the reversibility and stability of the anode, we further tested the CE of the half\u00a0cell. Under moderate conditions (1 mAh cm\u22122, 5\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122), the CuNC@Cu electrode can achieve an ultra-high average CE (ACE) of 99.88% with over 4000 stable cycles (1,700\u00a0h, Fig.\u00a04a, c), while the untreated Cu electrode short out at 303rd cycle (Figs.\u00a04b and S13), with an ACE of 99.14%. At higher current densities (1 mAh cm\u22122, 20\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122), the CuNC@Cu electrode delivers even better performance, achieving an ACE of 99.91% over 7,000 steady cycles (800\u00a0h, Fig. S14), while the untreated Cu electrode shows 132 stable cycles, with an ACE of 99.42%.

            "text": "Another challenge for anode-free batteries is the lack of high-performance Zn-rich cathodes. For ZnI2 cathode, the unique energy storage mechanism based on conversion reaction can provide sufficient Zn2+ ions for the anode. However, similar to the iodine cathode [37], ZnI2 cathode is suffering from the shuttle effect of iodine species [38], which can cause severe self-discharge and iodine loss, resulting in low CE and dramatic capacity decay[39]. Meanwhile, the poor electronic conductivity of ZnI2 greatly limits the utilization of iodine and increases the voltage polarization [40]. To address these issues, we propose a G/PVP heterogeneous structure as a host material for ZnI2 cathode.\nOn the one hand, the strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction between G and PVP contributes to the homogeneous and stable structure of G/PVP [41]. PVP can significantly enhance the\ndispersibility of G in deionized water, therefore, G/PVP exhibits stable and homogeneous dispersion both before and after ultrasonic dispersion, while pure G is heavily aggregated (Fig. S15). Besides, in the SEM images of G/ PVP@ZnI2 cathode material (Figs.\u00a05a and S16), no flocculent PVP is observed, while the corresponding element mapping image shows the uniform nitrogen distribution of PVP on the graphene surface. This evidence further demonstrates the homogeneous structure of G/PVP [42].Moreover, it is worth to note that, although PVP is water soluble, PVP with an average Mw of 30,000 used in this work is difficult to dissolve in the high concentration ZnSO4 solution, as shown in Fig. S17a, the PVP solution in 2\u00a0M ZnSO4 electrolyte is turbid compared to the clarified PVP aqueous solution. Similarly, when the G/PVP electrode was immersed in the 2\u00a0M ZnSO4 electrolyte for 24\u00a0h, as shown in Fig. S17b, the PVP absorption peaks of G/PVP in the UV\u2013vis spectra are negligible compared with the strong absorption peaks of the aqueous solution with the same mass of PVP, indicating that PVP is difficult to dissolve from the G/PVP electrode.\n1 3\nOn the other hand, PVP can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of iodine species, due to the strong electrostatic interaction between PVP and iodide ions. Specifically, PVP chains can form moderate hydrogen bonds with In\u2212 (n = 1, 3, 5) [43, 44]. For example, after immersing the pre-cycle G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode and G@ZnI2 cathode in the 2\u00a0M\nZnSO4 electrolyte for 24\u00a0h, the UV\u2013vis spectra (Fig.\u00a05b) show that the electrolyte immersed with G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode exhibits a significantly lower I\u2212 absorption peak. More importantly, the hydrogen bonds get stronger as the number of iodine atoms increases, therefore, the desorption energy barrier of iodine monomers is significantly higher than the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00948-9\u00a9 The authors\nadsorption energy barrier [43]. As a result, PVP can effectively inhibit the diffusion of polyiodide to the electrolyte, which is the main cause for the shuttle effect. Disassemble the cells of both cathodes after charging to 1.6\u00a0V, yellow iodine species are evident on the separator of the G@ZnI2 cathode (Fig. S18), while the separator color of G/PVP@ ZnI2 cathode is much lighter. After immersing the two samples of cathodes and separators in 2\u00a0M ZnSO4 electrolyte for 24\u00a0h, respectively, as shown in Fig.\u00a05c, the electrolyte immersed with G@ZnI2 cathode obviously turns yellow, and the corresponding UV\u2013vis spectra confirm the presence of I3\u2212 in the electrolyte (Fig.\u00a05d). For comparison, the electrolyte immersed with G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode stays colorless and the corresponding UV\u2013vis spectra show negligible I3\u2212 absorption peak.\nGalvanostatic discharging/charging (GDC) tests further demonstrated the suppression of shuttle effect by G/PVP. Figure\u00a05e\u2013g shows the GDC curves and rate performance of G/PVP@ZnI2 and G@ZnI2 cathodes under various current densities. The CEs of G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode is significantly higher than that of the G@ZnI2 cathode. At a low current density of 0.2 A g\u22121, G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode can deliver an average CE of 96.9%, while the G@ZnI2 cathode can only deliver an average CE of 77.2%. Such a low CE results from the severe shuttle effect of the G@ZnI2 cathode [45], which is effectively suppressed by the G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode. Therefore, the G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode exhibits excellent rate performance, delivering an average capacity of 145.6, 137.3, 124.4, 119.6, and 103.1 mAh g\u22121 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g\u22121, respectively, while the G@ZnI2 cathode can only deliver an average capacity of 107.8, 96.5, 89.3, 84.0, and 77.5 mAh g\u22121 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g\u22121, respectively. Besides, we also performed self-discharge experiments to demonstrate the suppression of self-discharge behavior by G/PVP. As shown in Fig.\u00a05j\u2013k, after resting for 0, 1, 5, 10, 24, and 48\u00a0h, the G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode can deliver a capacity retention of 98%, 86%, 83%, 79%, 73%, and 63%, respectively. By contrast, the capacity retention of G@ZnI2 cathode is only 91%, 58%, 47%, 37%, 32%, and 27% after resting for 0, 1, 5, 10, 24, and 48\u00a0h, respectively. In addition, due to the excellent electronic conductivity and iodine affinity of G/PVP, lower charging voltage and polarization are shown in the charge/discharge curves of G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode (Fig. S19). A similar voltage drop of the oxide peak is also observed in the CV curve (Fig.\u00a05h).\nIn the long cycle test (Fig.\u00a05i), the capacity retention rate of G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode can reach 80% after 1,000 cycles, while the G@ZnI2 cathode exhibits a sharp capacity decay, with less than 40% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles. In addition, because of the excellent conductivity and stability of G/PVP, we further increased the areal mass loading of cathode. At a high loading of 15\u00a0mg\u00a0 cm\u22122, the cathode can deliver an area capacity of 2 mAh cm\u22122 (Fig. S20). Thereafter, no significant capacity decay was observed during 300 stable cycles (Fig.\u00a05l). By contrast, the high mass loading G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode shows rapid capacity decay, resulting in significantly lower area capacity. Such an outstanding high areal capacity performance of G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode is highly important to increase the energy density of the full cell [46]."

            "heading": "3.4 Electrochemical Performance of\u00a0AFZIB",
            "text": "Based on the high-performance ZnI2 cathode and the in\u00a0situ reconstruction method for Cu anode (Fig.\u00a06a), the AFZIB with G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode and CuNC@Cu anode can deliver a specific capacity of 125.7 mAh g\u22121 at 1 A g\u22121 (Fig.\u00a06c). It is worth to note that the I3\u2212 additive in the electrolyte delivers very limited capacity for AFZIB. As shown in Fig. S21, when assembling an AFZIB without ZnI2 active substance in the cathode, it only delivers a capacity of about 1.6 mAh g\u22121 (based on the area mass loading of 15\u00a0mg\u00a0 cm\u22122, which is the same as the normal AFZIB), which is only 1.3% of the normal AFZIB capacity.\nThe GDC curve of AFZIB (Fig.\u00a06c\u2013e) is similar to that of ZIB (Fig.\u00a05e). However, as the capacity decays, the voltage inflection point in the discharge plateau becomes more and more forward, indicating that the capacity of AFZIB is mainly limited by the capacity of Zn. Consequently, due to the high reversibility of the CuNC@Cu electrode for Zn deposition/dissolution, AFZIB exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 63.8% after 200 cycles and an initial CE of 96.4% (Fig.\u00a06f). While the capacity retention of AFZIB with G/PVP@ZnI2 cathode and Cu anode is only 24.9% after 200 cycles, the capacity decays rapidly at the beginning of the cycle due to the quick loss of Zn, and the initial CE is only 83.8% (Fig.\u00a06d). In the XRD pattern of the surface of Cu foil after cycling (separated from the Cu substrate by transparent adhesive tape, Fig. S22a), significant peak of zinc hydroxide by-product is observed.\n1 3\nBesides, if replacing the anode Cu foil with Zn foil after the significant capacity decay of G/PVP@ZnI2||Cu battery, the cell capacity returns to the pre-decay level and performs stable cycling (Fig. S22b), which further demonstrates that the main reason for the capacity decay of AFZIB is the loss of Zn. Furthermore, when the cathode material is G@ZnI2, due to the shuttle of active material and severe self-discharge, AFZIB can only deliver a capacity of 36.6 mAh g\u22121 and an initial CE of 78.6% (Fig.\u00a06e), with a capacity retention rate of 29.5% for 200 cycles. Compared with recently reported AFZBs with cathode mass loading less than 2\u00a0mg\u00a0 cm\u22122, our AFZIB exhibits superior performance even under high mass loading (15\u00a0mg\u00a0 cm\u22122) and lean electrolyte (15 \u03bcL mAh\u22121)\nconditions (Table\u00a0S2). Such a close-to-practice condition is more informative when evaluating the commercialization potential of AFZBs.\nMore importantly, as the most prominent advantage of AFZIB (Fig.\u00a06f), AFZIB can achieve a gravimetrical energy density of 162 Wh kg\u22121 (based on the total mass of active material), while the gravimetrical energy density of ZIB with 200\u00a0\u03bcm Zn foil anode is only 15 Wh kg\u22121. Even when the mass of electrode hosts, electrolyte and separator are included in the calculation, the gravimetrical energy density of AFZIB can still reach 33 Wh kg\u22121, which is three times higher than 11 Wh kg\u22121 of ZIB. In addition, commercial electrode materials and simple assembly processes in AFZIB\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00948-9\u00a9 The authors\nhave obvious advantages. The total preparation and assembly process of AFZIB can be limited within 3\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a06g), which is much faster than other reported AFZBs, thus reducing the cell production costs and enhancing the practical potential of AFZBs."

            "text": "Together, we propose a comprehensive and scalable approach to promoting the electrochemical performance of AFZBs, where low-cost iodine plays an important role in overcoming both the anode and cathode issues. For the anode, the commercial Cu foil surface is in\u00a0situ reconstructed into zincophilic Cu nanoclusters by I3\u2212 electrolyte additive. This nanocluster-structure achieves uniform Zn deposition with ultralow nucleation overpotential and high reversibility (average coulombic efficiency > 99.91% over 7,000 cycles). For the cathode, the unique conversion reaction-based energy storage mechanism of iodine enables the ZnI2 cathode to provide sufficient Zn2+ for AFZB. Then, by optimizing the conductivity and suppressing the shuttle effect through a G/ PVP cathode host, a high-capacity, cycling-stable Zn-rich cathode is obtained. Due to iodine enabled high performance of both electrodes, the assembled anode-free Zn iodine full cell delivers stable cycling (capacity retention of 63.8% after 200 cycles) and considerable energy density (162 Wh kg\u22121) under a harsh condition of high cathode mass loading (15\u00a0mg\u00a0 cm\u22122) and lean electrolyte addition (15 \u03bcL mAh\u22121). More importantly, the low-cost electrode materials and fast-production process demonstrate the scale-up potential of AFZIB, which is crucial for the practical application of AFZBs.\nAcknowledgements This work was financially supported by Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum CO., Ltd (18529), Yiwu Research Institute of Fudan University (21557), the National Science Foundation of China (22075048), and the Shanghai International Collaboration Research Project (19520713900).\nFunding Open access funding provided by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
