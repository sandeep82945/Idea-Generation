    "abstractText": "Macrosiphoniella sanborni is a widespread pest of Chrysanthemum morifolium that causes significant damage to world floriculture. Chemical insecticides and biological methods of control have a number of disadvantages that can be improved by using oligonucleotide insecticides. In this article, we present, for the first time, the results of using oligonucleotide insecticides, for which the target sequence is an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) in a polycistronic rRNA transcript. The mortality of wingless aphid individuals after a Macsan-11 treatment was recorded at a level of 67.15 \u00b1 3.32% 7 days after a single treatment with a solution at a concentration of 100 ng/\u03bcL and 97.38 \u00b1 2.49% 7 days after a double treatment with a solution of the same concentration and a daily interval. The contact use of the control oligonucleotide (ACTG)2ACT-11. as well as the oligonucleotide insecticides Macsan-11(3\u2032) and Macsan-11(5\u2032) was not accompanied by insect mortality. Given the high variability in the internal transcribed spacer, which has proven to be a promising target for the action of oligonucleotide insecticides, it is possible to create selective preparations. This study showed the prospects of ribosomal insect pest genes as targets for the action of olinscides, and also demonstrated the high specificity of such insecticidal agents.",

When starting our experiments on aphids, we took into account that the high reproductive potential of the pest can become an obstacle to the rapid achievement of a substantial lethal effect. However, because they have thin exoskeletons that are not protected by a powerful wax coating [2], aphids are a convenient model organism for the testing and development of oligonucleotide insecticides. The distribution of the chrysanthemum aphid is associated with greenhouses, horticultural centers, and small private farms around the world (Figure 1). M. sanborni is dangerous not only for the direct damage it causes to buds and young shoots due to feeding on phloem juice, but also for its ability to spread a number of RNA viruses [2], including chrysanthemum virus B, a chrysanthemum vein mottle virus strain, potato virus Y, turnip mosaic virus, watermelon mosaic virus 2 [3], and Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV) [4]. In addition, aphids provoke the development of sooty fungi [5]. All these factors deplete the plant, reduce\nInt. J. Mol.

Aphid-affected Chrysanthemum morifolium.\nThe wave of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies and the need to take care of the environment have contributed to increasing consumer demands for manufactured products [8]. To date, chemical insecticides [9,10] and biological control methods include botanical insecticides based on the leaf extracts of Toona sinensis L., Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsl.) A. Gray., and Azadirachta indica A. Juss [11]; phytohormones [12]; and various essential oils or their components [13,14]. Among the biological methods of control, the release of Coccinella septempunctata L. into the biotope [15] and the treatment of plants with the blastospores of Verticillium lecanii and Beauveria bassiana [16,17] have gained popularity. However, both chemical and biological methods have significant drawbacks: the first one negatively affects all components of the natural environment and contributes to the development of resistance [18], and the latter is often insufficiently effective, time-consuming, and expensive. Considering the critical need for farming practices aimed at maximizing the yield of crops, pesticides from the following groups have been used successfully to chemically manage aphids worldwide: organophosphates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and carbamates. Unfortunately, due to the development of resistance, the relative ineffectiveness of organophosphates [19], pyrethroids [20], neonicotinoids [21], and carbamates [22] against aphids is often detected. Recently, our biotechnology based on antisense oligonucleotides, which appeared in 2008 [23], has gained popularity and distribution for crop protection. For example, there have been developments using a similar protection approach based on modified anti-\nFigure 1.

Considering the critical need for farming practices aimed at maximizing the yield of crops, pesticides from the following groups have been used successfully to chemically manage aphids world ide: organophosphates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and carbamates. Unfortunately, due to the development of resistance, the relative ineffectiveness of organophosphates [19], pyrethroids [20], neonicotinoids [21], and carbamates [22] against aphids is often detected. Recently, our biotechnology based on antisense oligonucleotides, which appeared in 2008 [23], has gained popularity and distribution for crop protection. For example, there have been developments using a similar protection approach based on modified antisense oligonucleotides, called the 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro-D-arabinonucleic acid (FANA) approach [24,25]."

In this case, we saw something strik : since the ITS2 is immediately d gr ded afte rRNA maturation, it is obvious that antisense oligonucleotides mainly affect the ITS2 at the stage of the PrRT. Nevertheless, the oligonucleotide Macsan-11, which triggers the ITS2, demonstrated its high potential for plant protecti n, and this technology has been presented as one of the most promising biotechnologies that enables insect pest control without harm to the environment. It is worth noting that viviparous aphid females have a greater viability than the larval stages. The females continued to reproduce parthenogenetically, thereby filling the population with larvae that were not in contact with Macsan-11. Obviously, the insecticidal load was too small for newborn nymphs. The introduction of the group with a double treatment allowed a larger number of individuals to be affected. The analysis of the mortality curves showed that, after the use of Macsan-11, the formation of an S-shaped mortality curve was observed and its angle of inclination was close to 45\u25e6 on the 4th day. With the double treatment, we observed a more pronounced exponential increase and the same level of mortality was reached on the 3rd day (Figure 2C,D).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11690 8 of 10\nA visual illustration of the work of DNases using gel electrophoresis showed that, in fact, the action of the Macsan-11 oligonucleotide as a blocker of the ITS2 of the target RNA is limited in time by the action of cellular enzymes from the aphid tissue homogenate. They degrade it, but this time is enough to provoke a long-term effect and disable the work of the protein biosynthesis of the cell. It is also possible that in an intact cell, DNA oligonucleotides persist for a longer time and may have a prolonged insecticidal effect. The fine details of this mechanism are being investigated; however, the eco-friendliness and fast biodegradability of olinscides make it possible to actively introduce this class of insecticides to regulate the number of insect pests. The results found for oligonucleotide insecticides on Coccus hesperidum obtained by the evaluation of gene expression are partly consistent with our results for Coccus-11 [23], and demonstrate an increase in the expression on the 2nd day after exposure to the olinscide, with its subsequent gradual decrease. Macsan-11 up-regulated the expression of the target gene, which probably indicates molecular hypercompensation in response to the stress factor due to the fact that vital genes involved in protein biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were affected. Apparently, insect tissues try to replace dead cells, which ultimately leads to an increase in the expression of genes important for the growth of the organism, an imbalance in the proportion of transcripts, cell depletion, and insect death."

With the help of the Macsan-11(3\u2032) and Macsan-11(5\u2032) oligonucleotides, a high selectivity was demonstrated, as determined by the absence of an insecticidal effect when replacing even one nitrogenous base out of eleven, which does not allow the olinscide to work effectively. The obtained results indicate the safety of Macsan-11 for non-target organisms and, at the same time, make it possible to create universal oligonucleotide insecticides for closely related insect pest species based on the insects\u2019 genomes. It has been shown that aphid DNases degrade Macsan-11 in less than 3 h, which demonstrates a high level of biodegradability for the olinscide. The established jumps in the expression of RNA targets show how the aphid organism tries to hypercompensate for the effect of the antisense oligonucleotides. The fine details of this mechanism are being investigated, but it is obvious that the protein biosynthesis reacts rapidly to the penetration of the oligonucleotide insecticides and is very sensitive to them. The importance of the relevant dose (100 ng/\u00b5L) and the double treatment with the olinscide Macsan-11 on the effective control of chrysanthemum aphids has been demonstrated. The development and registration of olinscides against insect pests from the suborder Sternorrhyncha is a direction of plant protection. With an increase in the number of elucidated sequences of insect genomes in GenBank, the development of this class of insecticides will gain even greater reliability and a wide distribution, since they rely not only on a single sequence of an insect pest, but also on data collected by researchers from different parts of the world.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, A.K.S., I.A.N. and A.I.B.; validation, Y.V.P.
