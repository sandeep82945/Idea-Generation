    "abstractText": "In order to explore the relationship of social support, self-efficacy, and subjective wellbeing of special education teachers in China, 496 teachers from 67 special education schools were surveyed by questionnaire. We found that (1) the subjective well-being of special education teachers in China was in the medial level. (2) There were significant differences in subjective well-being level among teachers of different genders, teacher position, education background, and teaching age. Male teachers were of higher subjective well-being; subjective well-being of head teachers was lower than those were not head teachers; teachers with the educational background of postgraduate were of higher relaxation and tension than those with junior college educational background; the control scores of emotion and behavior of teachers with teaching age of 3 years and below were significantly lower than those of teachers with teaching age of more than 10 years. (3) Self-efficacy played a partially mediating role in the relationship between social support and subjective well-being of special education teachers. Suggestions to improve the subjective well-being of special education teachers were discussed in the article.",

We found that (1) the subjective well-being of special education teachers in China was in the medial level. (2) There were significant differences in subjective well-being level among teachers of different genders, teacher position, education background, and teaching age. Male teachers were of higher subjective well-being; subjective well-being of head teachers was lower than those were not head teachers; teachers with the educational background of postgraduate were of higher relaxation and tension than those with junior college educational background; the control scores of emotion and behavior of teachers with teaching age of 3 years and below were significantly lower than those of teachers with teaching age of more than 10 years. (3) Self-efficacy played a partially mediating role in the relationship between social support and subjective well-being of special education teachers. Suggestions to improve the subjective well-being of special education teachers were discussed in the article.\nKeywords: special education teachers, social support, self-efficacy, subjective well-being, China\nINTRODUCTION\nSince the end of the 20th century, after Seligman proposed positive psychology, psychologists have begun to look at the potential, motivation, and abilities of people with a more open and appreciative attitude (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Sheldon and King, 2001). As one of the important contents of positive psychology, subjective well-being (SWB) has attracted the attention of scholars all over the world. SWB benefits individuals in many aspects such as health and longevity, work, income, and friendship (Diener and Ryan, 2009; Diener and Chan, 2011). SWB was the overall feelings and judgments of an individual about their quality of life, which was based on their subjective standards. It has the characteristics of subjectivity, stability, integrity, etc. Its components include satisfaction with personal life and important fields in life, positive emotional experience and low-level negative emotional experience (Diener et al., 1999).\nImpact of Subjective Well-Being of Teachers for Teachers and Students For teachers, the level of SWB reflects their mental health and reflects their satisfaction with their current life and work conditions. SWB would not only affect their work enthusiasm and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811\ninitiative (Du, 2017; Buri\u00e6 et al., 2019), but also affect the mental health of students (Liu, 2014; Perera et al., 2019). Teachers with lower levels of mental health usually behave negatively and passively when facing challenges in teaching (Bi, 2013). A survey showed that special education teachers have more severe mental health problems. Among them, teachers with mild or above psychological problems account for 25% of the total (Zhao and Wang, 2013). Compared with general teachers, special education teachers, due to the particularity of their education targets, lack a sense of accomplishment by working much with low effectiveness, which leads to a low happiness index (Wan and Zhao, 2013). They are more likely to experience a state of low happiness earlier (Shen et al., 2012). With the successive promulgation of policy documents such as the \u201cOpinions on Comprehensively Deepening the Reform of Teacher Team Building in the New Era,\u201d \u201cOpinions on Strengthening the Building of Special Education Teacher Team,\u201d \u201cSpecial Education Teacher Professional Standards (Trial),\u201d and other policy documents by the State Council and the Ministry of Education, more specific requirements for the professional development of education teachers have been made. It has been further pointed out that teachers should be the instructors of the healthy growth of students. The opinions also mentioned that the benefits and rights protection should be strengthened to further expand the happiness of teachers (The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, 2018). For the special education teacher group in China, improving their (happiness) development and exploring their key influencing factors and their mechanism of actions are urgent (Peng et al., 2018)."

            "text": "Scholars have found that the social support is one of the important predictors of SWB (Meehan et al., 1993; Song and Fan, 2013). From the perspective of the main components of it, the social support can be divided into the informal and formal social support. The former mainly refers to the support and assistance provided by informal social relations resources such as family, neighbors, friends, and colleagues; the latter refers to the guarantee and support provided to people through formal organizations such as government, enterprises, community organizations, and formal institutional arrangements (Zhang, 2001). The social support can also be divided into objective support and subjective support as well. That is, the actual support that can be seen and the emotional support that is experienced (Langford et al., 1997; Langher et al., 2017). Good social support has a clear positive correlation with life satisfaction, a significant positive correlation with positive emotions, and a clear negative correlation with negative emotions, including the loneliness, depression, and anxiety (Lam, 2019; Gkda, 2021). The higher the degree of social support, the stronger the SWB (Lu and Ying, 2014; Lam, 2019). Gonz\u00e1lez and Restrepo-Chavarriaga (2010) found that there was a close connection between social support and well-being: the higher the level of social support, the higher the quality of life of people. People who have good social support,\ngood interpersonal communication and relationships, and the more positive emotions they experience, the higher the degree of happiness they would feel (Ding, 2007). Numerous studies find the positive association between social support and wellbeing of teachers in global context, including United States (Carroll, 2020), Macao (Huang, 2011), Romanian (Stanculescu, 2014), and so on."

            "text": "How does social support of teachers affect their SWB? The selfefficacy may be an important mediating factor, which refers to the subjective judgment of people on whether they can successfully perform a certain behavior for achievements (Bandura, 1977). The social support may affect the inner psychology of the individual or it may affect the psychological quality of the individual by affecting some of the inner psychological factors of the individual (Uchino et al., 1996). The effect of external social factors on the inner psychology of an individual needs to go through the mediating effect of self-concept (Judge et al., 1997) and self-efficacy is one of the important components of self-concept (Liu, 2001). Bandura (2008) believed that the selfefficacy, optimism, hope, and resilience played an important role in managing and coping with stress and improving happiness. Studies have pointed out that there is a significant correlation between self-efficacy and SWB (Caprara and Steca, 2005; Yu et al., 2005). For teachers, the higher the self-efficacy they feel, the higher the level of SWB there is (Cui, 2016). When teachers possess high self-efficacy to perform required tasks (Klassen and Chiu, 2011), they would experience favorable outcomes, including satisfaction (Zee and Koomen, 2016) and well-being (Huang et al., 2019; Perera et al., 2019; Mo\u00e8 and Katz, 2020). Studies have shown that social support can help individuals to improve their coping ability and improve their sense of efficacy in their own coping capabilities, thereby reducing negative reactions to stressful events and promoting individual growth (Cohen and Syme, 1985; Stanculescu, 2014). When teachers have high level of perceived social support and a good sense of their abilities to affect the outcomes of students (teacher self-efficacy), they experience SWB."

Besides, few previous studies explored and proved mediating effect of self-efficacy between the social support and their SWB of special education teachers in China. A deeper reciprocal relation between the relation in social support, efficacy and SWB of special education teachers should be investigated in China. To fill in the gaps, we investigated SWB of special education teachers in China and mediating reaction was explored on the mediating effect of self-efficacy between social support and their SWB of special education teachers. Drawing on prior empirical findings and self-efficacy theory, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) social support of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811\nspecial education teachers was positively associated with their SWB in China; (2) self-efficacy of special education teachers was positively associated with their SWB in China; and (3) selfefficacy of special education teachers played the mediating role between social support and SWB of teachers."

The first 18 items of the scale were used by Duan to measure the subjects and the correlation between each item of the scale and the total score was\nbetween 0.48 and 0.78 (Fazio, 1977).

Thus, the validity index was considered valid. The scale was constituted by 6 factors: the worry about health [e.g., have you been bothered by illness, discomfort, pain, or fear of illness (in the past month)], energy [e.g., did you wake up feeling refreshed and energized (in the past month)], satisfaction and interest in life [e.g., how happy, fulfilled, or enjoyable your life has been (in the past month)], melancholy or happy mood [e.g., have you ever wondered if anything was worth doing because you were sad, discouraged, disappointed, or in a lot of trouble (in the past month)], control of emotion and behavior [e.g., have you been firmly in control of your actions, thoughts, emotions, or feelings (in the past month)], and relaxation and tension (anxiety) [e.g., are you under or have you been under any restraint, stimulation, or pressure (in the past month)] (Duan, 1996).

The self-efficacy of the teacher was evaluated from three different dimensions, including the student management (e.g., you feel how much you can do when you help your students to think deeply), instructional strategy (e.g., how well have you done adapting the course to the level of the students), and class management (e.g., how good are you at keeping a few problem students from ruining the class?). The Likert 9-point scale was applied in the scale for scoring. The higher the score, the higher the sense of self-efficacy (Dixon et al., 2014). In this study, the internal consistency coefficient of Chinese version of the scale revised by Lu (2017) reached 0.95. The internal consistency coefficients of the three dimensions of the student engagement, teaching strategy, and classroom management were 0.875, 0.876, and 0.881, respectively, and the test-retest reliability was 0.76, 0.80, and 0.85, respectively.

Two were on the dimension of relaxation and tension. There were no significant differences in SWB levels among teachers with different teaching years, while multiple tests showed that teachers with 3 and fewer years of teaching experience had significantly lower scores control of emotion and behavior than teachers with more than 10 years of teaching experience (F = 0.52, p < 0.05).

While for special education teachers, Olagunju et al. (2020) found that about four in every ten Nigerian special education teachers had psychological distress. The education system and culture have great impact in SWB of teachers (Xin et al., 2021). The reason of difference with Huang et al.

Besides, the government has paid more and more attention to the development of special education, issued a series of policies to support the construction of special education schools, and supported the construction of special education teachers by improving the treatment of special education teachers\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811\nfpsyg-13-802811 February 11,2022 Tim e:12:50 # 5 Fu etal.\nS ubjective W ell-B eing ofS pecialTeachers\nTABLE 2 | The differences by education, teaching experience, gender, and whether they were classroom teachers on subjective well-being.\nTotal score and dimensions\n(M \u00b1 SD)\nSub- concern about health\n(M \u00b1 SD)\nSub-energy (M \u00b1 SD)\nSub- satisfaction and interest in life\n(M \u00b1 SD)\nSub-depression or happy mood\n(M \u00b1 SD)\nSub- control of emotion and\nbehavior(M \u00b1 SD)\nSub- relaxation and tension (anxiety)\n(M \u00b1 SD)\nEducational background\nJunior College 75.97 \u00b1 13.23 6.60 \u00b1 1.92 18.19 \u00b1 3.98 6.43 \u00b1 1.72 15.99 \u00b1 3.78 12.83 \u00b1 2.11 15.93 \u00b1 4.38\nUndergraduate 73.01 \u00b1 13.73 6.97 \u00b1 2.55 17.45 \u00b1 4.39 6.38 \u00b1 1.87 15.08 \u00b1 3.48 12.38 \u00b1 2.22 14.75 \u00b1 3.96\nPostgraduate or above\n77.40 \u00b1 14.38 6.93 \u00b1 2.40 18.67 \u00b1 4.20 6.07 \u00b1 1.91 15.40 \u00b1 2.87 13.47 \u00b1 2.23 16.87 \u00b1 4.98\nF 2.037 0.710 1.393 0.241 2.050 2.849 4.237**\nP 0.131 0.492 0.249 0.786 0.130 0.059 0.015\nTeaching experience\nbelow 3 years 73.49 \u00b1 13.56 7.14 \u00b1 2.5 17.61 \u00b1 4.18 6.42 \u00b1 2.01 15.15 \u00b1 3.44 12.21 \u00b1 2.30 14.96 \u00b1 4.19\n3-5 years 73.82 \u00b1 15.19 7.18 \u00b1 2.8 17.24 \u00b1 4.66 6.37 \u00b1 1.95 15.39 \u00b1 3.8 12.15 \u00b1 2.14 15.50 \u00b1 4.60\n6-10 years 72.53 \u00b1 12.15 6.80 \u00b1 2.24 17.43 \u00b1 3,91 6.22 \u00b1 1.65 15.01 \u00b1 2.86 12.33 \u00b1 2.06 14.73 \u00b1 3.43\n10 above 73.89 \u00b1 13.91 6.80 \u00b1 2.44 17.72 \u00b1 4.45 6.41 \u00b1 1.81 15.29 \u00b1 3.67 12.72 \u00b1 2.22 14.94 \u00b1 4.11\nF 0.207 0.765 0.247 0.229 0.187 2.142 0.444\nP 0.892 0.514 0.863 0.876 0.905 0.094 0.722\nGender Male 77.89 \u00b1 12.19 7.22 \u00b1 2.59 18.94 \u00b1 4.24 6.86 \u00b1 2 16.03 \u00b1 3.75 13.18 \u00b1 2.09 15.66 \u00b1 3.89\nFemale 72.37 \u00b1 13.86 6.84 \u00b1 2.43 17.21 \u00b1 4.28 6.24 \u00b1 1.78 15.01 \u00b1 3.41 12.28 \u00b1 2.21 14.79 \u00b1 4.12\nT 3.754*** 1.436 3.725*** 3.12** 2.695** 3.778*** 1.95\nP 0.000 0.152 0.000 0.002 0.007 0.000 0.052\nBeing head teachers in classroom\nYes 72.50 \u00b1 13.15 6.82 \u00b1 2.28 17.27 \u00b1 4.26 6.30 \u00b1 1.76 15.03 \u00b1 3.34 12.29 \u00b1 2.16 14.80 \u00b1 3.98\nNo 74.95 \u00b1 14.28 7.06 \u00b1 2.69 18 \u00b1 4.39 6.47 \u00b1 1.96 15.49 \u00b1 3.71 12.71 \u00b1 2.26 15.22 \u00b1 4.21\nT \u22121.98* \u22121.07 \u22121.88 \u22121.03 \u22121.47 \u22122.08* \u22121.15\nP 0.048 0.287 0.061 0.304 0.143 0.038 0.250\n*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.\nFrontiers in P sychology |w w w .frontiersin.org\n5 February 2022 |Volum e 13 |A rticle 802811\nand promoting their professional development (Zhang and Wei, 2014). The special \u201cnational training plan\u201d has been carried out in rural areas, which could promote SWB of special teachers in China to some extent.\nBy analyzing the demographic variables that impact SWB of special education teachers, it was found that SWB level of teachers was associated with many factors, including gender and teaching age, whether being a head teacher. There are significant differences in SWB level of special education teachers of different genders. Male special education teachers in northwest China had higher SWB and the scores of the total score of happiness, energy factor, satisfaction and interest in life, melancholy or happy mood, and control of emotion and behavior are significantly higher than those of female ones. The association between gender of SWB teachers remains controversial. Some studies based on teacher gender theory have pointed out that female teachers are generally significantly higher than male ones in\nterms of happiness level (Liu, 2011; Wang, 2017), while some research found that female teachers reported a higher level of psychological distress (Pevalin, 2000; Dai, 2014; Chaplain and Jackson, 2017). The reason may be as female teachers, since they not only have to face the same educational and teaching pressure as male ones, but also have to bear more responsibilities of family such as bearing, raising, educating children, and housework in China (Ding, 2006), which may result that the happiness of female special education teachers in China is significantly lower than that of male ones.\nIn addition, professional-related factors of teachers, including education background, teaching years, and whether they are head teachers, all have association with SWB level of special education teachers. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the total score of SWB, but in the dimension of relaxation and tension among the special education teachers with different educational backgrounds in China. The teachers\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811\nof bachelor degree were significantly lower than others in the dimension of relaxation and tension. On one hand, teachers of bachelor degree felt more anxious than those with higher education background. Teachers graduated from master program are more confident in the teaching work and be more trusted by the administrators in the school (Liang, 2017) and they are also less likely to suffer from anxiety (Wang et al., 2009). On the other hand, teachers of bachelor degree felt more anxious than those graduated from junior college. It is similar with study of Zhang (2020). She found that special education teachers graduated from junior college scored higher in job satisfaction than undergraduate teachers. It is since teachers graduated from junior college have low expectation on their career and are relatively less under pressure in the work (Wang, 2017).\nIn terms of teaching age, the teachers with more than 10 years of teaching experience scored significantly higher than ones with 3 years or less on the emotion and behavior control dimension of SWB, which indicated that the work pressure of teachers with longer teaching experience was significantly lower than that of ones with shorter teaching experience (Pang, 2003) and they have higher sense of self-efficacy (Vasher, 2012) and SWB. Teachers who have longer teaching experience will more consciously conduct self-education, selfperfection, and self-improvement in teaching management (Gavish and Friedman, 2010; Aloe et al., 2014; Ren and Wang, 2015), whereas teachers who are new and have shorter experience are more likely to suffer from stress in teaching management, time management, and work-life balance. Without proper social support, they are 60% less likely to stay in teaching for the long term (Calnan, 2017).\nThis study result showed that SWB level of special education teachers serving as head teachers was significantly lower than that of ones not in the northwest region of China. There are significant differences on the control of the emotional and behavioral dimensions; the teacher who do not work as a head teacher can better control of their emotions and behavior. Consistent with previous studies (Dai, 2014; Chaplain and Jackson, 2017), i.e., positions of teachers have a significant impact on their level of happiness, the teacher incharge of the class is usually affected by\nthe school chores and heavy workload, so they are faced with greater work pressure as well as a lower sense of self-efficacy. Dramatic changes to the role of a modern head teacher have been associated with increased levels of stress (Chaplain and Jackson, 2017). For special education head teachers, they are responsible for organizing the daily running of the classroom and dealing with challenge behaviors of students (Langher et al., 2017), whose SWB is low. Because of students with disabilities have great individual differences, generally weak learning ability and most accompanied by more emotional and behavioral problems, they also need to deal with the curriculum organization and management and solve unexpected problems."

            "text": "The results showed that the level of social support obtained by special education teachers in China can positively predict their SWB level. That is, the higher the social support level, the SWB level will be higher. It is consistent with the previous research (Lam, 2019). Social support is closely related with SWB of teachers (Lam, 2019; Carroll, 2020). The study of Chinese researchers also shows that different dimensions of social support of special education teachers have a good predictive effect on SWB of teachers and its various dimensions (Tang, 2006; Lu and Ying, 2014). Social objective support can provide material or information help, increase happiness of teachers, and improve their self-confidence and the increase of utilization of support of an individual will reduce worries and the possibility of their inner depression and pain. Therefore, teachers with high utilization of social support usually have a higher level of SWB (Zhang, 2005; Chaplain and Jackson, 2017; Langher et al., 2017) and the special education teachers who can make good use of various social support resources usually feel less psychological pressure, have more positive task motivation, and then have higher SWB (Wang et al., 2012).\nFurther analysis found that self-efficacy of teachers played a mediating role in the relationship between social support\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811\nand SWB of special education teachers in northwest China. That is, social support affected SWB of teachers level by improving self-efficacy of teachers. Social support not only directly affects SWB of special education teachers, but also impacts on self-efficacy and improves their SWB of teachers (Huang, 2011; Stanculescu, 2014; Carroll, 2020). On one hand, social support can have a direct effect through encouragement. On the other hand, it can also have an indirect effect through changing self-efficacy, so as to change individual behavior and produce a lasting effect on such change (Jiang et al., 2004). Meanwhile, the higher the level of social support, the more likely to promote individuals to adopt positive coping strategies to solve problems (Chan, 2002; Watts, 2014). Teacher needs personal accomplishment serve as emotional resources that favors positive personal outcomes (Katz and Shahar, 2015; Aelterman et al., 2016). As a high-order personality structure, the sense of selfefficacy is closely related with the psychological state of an individual: the higher the level of the sense of self-efficacy of an individual, the higher the level of SWB (Huang et al., 2012). High social support gives confidence of special education teachers in their own teaching ability and makes them have higher evaluation of life quality as well as SWB."

            "heading": "LIMITATION AND FURTHER RESEARCH",
            "text": "Limitations in this study were noted. First, the main limitation of this study is its cross-sectional nature that does not allow to infer causal relationships between the studied variables. Further studies can be elucidating the complexity of the reciprocal relations between these variables by examining the role of potential mediators longitudinally. Second, although the study focus on SWB of Chinese special education teachers, the comparison of special education teachers in a broader context would be help to understanding the impact of culture. An important area of future research will be conducted in different countries.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATION\nFirst, for the development of special education in different regions, the government should set quantifiable and actionable policy goals. In this study, the research on SWB of special education teachers is inconsistent with previous studies in central and eastern regions, which main reason lies in the unbalanced development of special education in different regions making different working environment of special education teachers. \u201cThe Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Further Adjusting and Optimizing the Structure to Improve the Efficiency of the Use of Educational Funds\u201d points those educational resources should be tilted to remote and poor areas to promote the rational allocation of educational resources and educational equity. All the relevant policy documents, such as \u201cthe First and Second Special Education Promotion Plan and Opinions on Comprehensively Deepening the Reform of Teacher Team Construction in the New Era\u201d, indicate that the\nconstruction of special education teachers has become a key task for the development of special education at this stage. However, there are some deviations in the implementation of the policy and it is necessary to formulate operational and instructive local policies to promote the development of regional special education and to procedurally supervise the implementation of the policies.\nSecond, school organizations should provide targeted support to teachers of different genders and teaching ages. Any kind of behavior or psychological expression arises from the totality of various interdependent facts, which have the characteristics of a dynamic field. School organization is one of the most leading social environments for teachers, which has a direct impact on the quality of life of teachers. This study shows that female and newly recruited special education teachers in China have a low SWB, which can be effectively elevated by improving their social support and self-efficacy. Therefore, school organizations should fully respect their work and give certain social support, including psychological counseling, flexible teaching adjustment during lactation period, carrying out colorful activities, and so on, to show the charm of female teachers and enhance their selfconfidence. In fact, new teachers often lack a clear plan for their future career development. They are prone to various problems in teaching and feel great pressure. They need to improve their sense of self-efficacy by elevating their professional ability. Schools can help new teachers to adapt to the teaching environment as soon as possible and improve their teaching skills through class evaluation, teaching on behalf of teachers as well as teaching and research groups. At the same time, we should make full use of national and provincial training programs to provide relevant professional training opportunities for young special education teachers to meet their professional development needs.\nThird, the on-service training system for special education teachers in China should be improved. The establishment and improvement of the social support system needs the joint efforts of the school, society, and teachers. \u201cWhat Every Special Educator Must Know: Ethics, Standards, and Guidelines for Special Educators,\u201d emended by the Council for Exceptional Children (2022), which stipulates that special education teachers are required to develop a career plan during their postservice development and have the right to seek adequate professional development resources from their institutions. Social resources are of great significance to the professional development of special education teachers and the improvement of their quality of life. The government and schools should provide effective training opportunities and sufficient training resources for teachers, effectively improve their sense of teaching efficacy, enable them to correctly deal with the possible new situations and situations in the working situation, and adapt to the new work objects as well as contents more quickly. In addition, scientific teaching evaluation mechanism is the quality assurance of social support system operation. Scientific teaching evaluation mechanism cannot only promote career planning and work effectiveness of special education teachers, but also enhance their social support utilization degree, so as to improve SWB of this group and promote the improvement of special education quality.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 802811"
