    "abstractText": "SCALES is a high-contrast, infrared coronagraphic imager and integral field spectrograph (IFS) to be deployed behind the W.M. Keck Observatory adaptive optics system. A reflective optical design allows diffraction-limited imaging over a large wavelength range (1.0 5.0 \u03bcm). A microlens array-based IFS coupled with a lenslet reformatter (\u201dslenslit\u201d) allow spectroscopy at both low (R = 35 250) and moderate (R = 2000 6500) spectral resolutions. The large wavelength range, diffraction-limited performance, high contrast coronagraphy and cryogenic operation present a unique optical design challenge. We present the full SCALES optical design, including performance modeling and analysis and manufacturing.",

            "text": "SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy) is a mid-infrared coronagraphic imager and integral field spectrograph (IFS) for the Keck telescope. Coupled with Keck Adaptive Optics (AO), it will enable a number of exciting science cases, including spectroscopic characterization of self-luminous exoplanets which are colder and lower mass than are currently accessible to existing high contrast instruments. A full description of the SCALES\u2019 science case and update on instrument development can be found in several references.1,2\nThe optical design of SCALES must preserve the low wavefront error and excellent image quality provided by the Keck AO system while of course maximizing throughput. The imager will operate from 1.0 - 5.3 \u00b5m with a selection of up to sixteen photometric and narrow bandpass filters, while the coronagraphically-fed integral field spectrograph will disperse in both low and medium spectral resolutions over a 2.0 - 5.3 \u00b5m bandpass. Both the imager and IFS will utilize 18 \u00b5m pixel H2RG (2048x2048) detectors.\nAs with other adaptive optics-enabled integral field spectrographs, the SCALES design utilizes a microlens array integral field unit (IFU). This architecture has the advantage of spatially sampling the field of view before the spectrograph optics, which are often designed to be fast and have large field angles to accommodate spectral resolution and bandpass at the expense of wavefront quality. Each lenslet serves as a spatial pixel (\u201dspaxel\u201d) which forms a micro-pupil image. This grid of pupil images is input for the spectrograph, and the spectra are interleaved by rotating the disperser prisms with respect to the lenslet array. This low spectral resolution configuration is represented by the cartoon shown in the top panel of Figure 1.\nSCALES has adopted a novel approach to obtaining moderate spectral resolutions over large bandpasses. We are implementing an image slicer developed by Stelter3,4 to reformat the pupil grid produced by the microlens array into a set of three interleaved pseudoslits, which are dispersed across the full length of the detector by gratings. The medium resolution configuration is shown on the lower panel of Figure 1. We refer to the slicer as a \u201dslenslit\u201d, as it combines the properties of an imager slicer IFU, a lenslet-based IFU, and a slit spectrograph. Requirements for the modes of operation, including field of view, spatial sampling, bandpass\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to R. Kupke) R.

This paper starts with an overview of the optical design of the foreoptics, imager, and spectrograph. The slenslit4 and imager5 are described in detail in separate publications in this proceedings. We anticipate beginning fabrication of SCALES optical components in autumn 2022 with final alignment, testing and verification beginning in early 2024."

            "text": "The optical design of SCALES is divided into four optical subsystems (Figure 2): the fore-optics which host the coronagraphic optics and magnify the beam for sampling at the microlens array; the imager with a fixed plate scale, and the spectrograph which disperses the pupil images formed by the microlens IFU and records them on the spectrograph detector. The spectrograph itself is divided further into low and medium spectral resolution subsystems."

            "text": "While not strictly a part of the SCALES instrument, the Keck AO system shown in Figure 3 impacts the SCALES optical design and operation.\nThe first optical component, near telescope Nasmyth focus, is a K-mirror de-rotator which can be used in either field-tracking mode to counteract the field rotation of the alt-az Keck (SCALES imager operation), or in pupil-tracking mode where it stabilizes the rotation angle of the pupil and allows the field to rotate (SCALES IFS operation). The flat mirror following the K-mirror is a fast tip-tilt mirror used for field stabilization. It should be noted that the fast tip-tilt mirror does not reside at the pupil plane and introduces some pupil movement during operation. A set of matched off-axis parabolas (OAPs) re-image the pupil onto a deformable mirror (DM) and re-image the DM-corrected image plane into SCALES. A wavefront sensor dichroic in the converging beam allows shorter wavelengths to be diverted to the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors, using either natural or laser guide stars. A second dichroic can be utilized to send J or H-band natural guide star light to an infrared pyramid wavefront sensor.6 Space near the K-mirror allows deployment of calibration sources, including white light and arc lamps. A calibration unit specific to SCALES at mid-IR wavelengths is under development and will be deployed at that location."

The foreoptics of SCALES serves many purposes: It must provide a well-formed pupil image for a cold-stop that is shared by coronagraph, imager and spectrograph and a collimated space for imager bandpass filters; for coronagraphy it must provide a focal plane for an occulting stop after the cold stop, and then a second well-formed pupil image for the Lyot stop. We require a space envelope for the imager sub-system, fed by reflected light from the Lyot stop position, and an unvignetted field of view of at least 12.3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 12.3\u2032\u2032 to the imager pick-off location. Finally, the foreoptics must provide an unvignetted field of view of at least 3\u2032\u2032\u00d7 3\u2032\u2032to the IFS microlens location with <50 nm RMS wavefront error across the field of view at a plate scale of 0.02\u2032\u2032 per spaxel (where a spaxel is equivalent to a single microlens) and enable the ability to steer the field between low- and mid-spectral resolution IFUs via a cryogenic steering mirror.\nTo achieve the above listed requirements we\u2019ve implemented a pair of relays: The first consists of a 4-f relay with off-axis parabolas as powered optics, and the second consists of an off-axis ellipse which produces both the real pupil for the Lyot stop and the reformatted plate scale for the IFS. The cryogenic steering mirror resides just after the Lyot stop, close to the pupil to minimize pupil shift during field steering. The optical layout of just the fore-optics is shown in Figure 4.\nThere are four focal planes within the foreoptics: the f/13.66 Keck AO focal plane, an f/27 focal plane at the coronagraphic mask, an f/54 focal plane at the imager detector and an f/320 focal plane at the microlens array IFU. There are two pupil planes: the location of the cold stop and the coronagraphic Lyot stop."

As seen in Table 1 the imager requires a 0.06\u2032\u2032per pixel plate scale over a 2k x 2k pixel2 H2RG. Science requirements demand diffraction-limited imaging down to 1.0 \u00b5m wavelength and low grid distortion. Note that the imager is not a 4-f relay, as the off-axis ellipse in the foreoptics produces a slowly converging beam. Optimization therefore suggested a slightly hyperbolic off-axis asphere as the ideal camera optic for the imager, with a slightly tilted focal plane. A fold mirror directs the f/54 beam to an area of the bench with ample space for the H2RG detector package, sidecar and associated baffling."

The resulting spot diagram allows evaluation of the blurring at the pupil edges. Figure 7 illustrates the tilt of the pupil at the cold stop, causing blurring of up to 60 \u00b5m. This blurring represents 0.3% of the primary diameter. An identical analysis was carried out for the real pupil formed by the off-axis ellipse in the second relay, at the position of the Lyot stop. The low-resolution IFS field of view (2.2\u2032\u2032\u00d7 2.2\u2032\u2032) was used for this analysis. The pupil at the Lyot stop is 6.88 mm in diameter.

During imager operations the field is de-rotated with the K-mirror, and the cold stop rotates within its mount to match the rotation caused by the alt-az telescope mount.\nSCALES uses the common approach of a focal plane coronagraph to reject on-axis starlight and a pupil plane Lyot stop to reject diffracted starlight. We summarize work by Li7,8 in design of the cold and Lyot stops (Figure 11). The cold stop will be slightly oversized; we plan to use a stop that allows light from the full Keck primary to pass, assuming 2% pupil nutation (from K-mirror misalignment). The Lyot stop design is undersized and includes the diffractive effects of the coronagraph.

The crosstalk can be mitigated by a pinhole mask located at the pupil grid plane. To find the best location for the pinhole mask, and the optimal size for the pinholes we modeled the lenslet array and spectrograph in physical optics.\nDiffraction for our system was modeled using the Zemax physical optics package. The 341 \u00b5m \u00d7 341 \u00b5m pitch lenslet with a focal length of 3.86 mm produces an f/8 beam. Each lenslet forms a pupil image with a geometric diameter of 8 \u00b5m at approximately one focal length behind the lenslet array. The diffraction limit for an f/8 beam varies from 16 - 40 \u00b5m over the 2.0 - 5.0 \u00b5m bandpass, so we can approximate the pupil image as a diffraction-limited point source which is reimaged onto the detector with a magnification of 1.0. We position a circular pinhole at 2.25 mm after the silicon lenslet back surface (distance of best focus at 3.5 \u00b5m wavelength, determined with physical optics propagation). Figure 12 shows the f/8 micro-pupil image masked by a 108 \u00b5m pinhole and that same masked pinhole imaged through the spectrograph optics. With a 6-pixel spectral\nspacing, light diffracted beyond the 108 \u00b5m pinhole diameter will intersect with the adjacent spectra. A smaller pinhole will reduce crosstalk, but also impact throughput. To quantify the pinhole suppression of crosstalk, an enslitted energy analysis was performed. Light that falls outside of a slit width of 108 \u00b5m (the separation between adajcent spectral traces) becomes crosstalk, so enslitted energy within this diameter is our figure of merit. A plot of enslitted energy versus radius from pinhole center is shown in Figure 13. This analysis suggests a 2% crosstalk at \u03bb = 5.0\u00b5m which is sufficient to our requirements."

It\u2019s a regular grid of 341 \u00b5m spacing with a uniform beam speed of f/8. The low spectral resolution grid contains 108 \u00d7 108 spaxels, while the medium spectral resolution samples a smaller field at 17 \u00d7 18 spaxels (see 2).\nBoth the low and medium spectral resolution modes utilize the 2-element f/8 collimator and camera, the elements of which are high order, off-axis aspheres. Prior to the collimator, the smaller pupil grid of the medium resolution mode is reformatted by a set of image slicing optics into a three row pseudo-slit, which is dispersed by a selection of gratings across the full length of the spectrograph detector. The low resolution mode utilizes double pass LiF prism dispersers, clocked to interleave the spectra for each spaxel across 60 pixels on the detector. The optical paths from pinhole grid to detector are shown in Figure 14 for both low- and medium-resolution modes. The detector is slightly tilted to improve optical performance and direct ghost reflections away from the optical path.\nSelection between the modes is accomplished with a flat mirror on a linear stage which folds in the light from the slenslit module while blocking the low-resolution lenslet grid, or alternatively blocks the slenslit path while in low-resolution mode. A disperser carousel holds a selection of six LiF prisms and three reflective ruled gratings, and these dispersers in combination with order blocking filters located near the detector provide all of the bandpass/resolution modes represented in Figure 15. The plot was created using the full spectrograph optical model, including prism and grating designs.\nThe SCALES slenslit optical and mechanical design is described in detail in Stelter.3,4 Following the smaller 17 \u00d7 18 spaxel IFU is a second pinhole grid which serves as the object plane for an input relay to the slicer, converting the beam from the f/8 of the lenslet into the f/64 demanded by the slicer module. The slicer stack\nconsists of 18 slices, one for each column of spaxels. The light is reformatted by the tilted, powered slicer mirrors in conjunction with a pupil and field mirror array. The powered, tilted field mirrors ensure a common entrance pupil to the slenslit output relay, which converts the beam back into the f/8 and co-locates the output focal plane, which now consists of 3 rows of pseudoslit, with the low-resolution pinhole grid. The beam is folded back into the spectrograph with the mode selection mirror, and is dispersed by one of three gratings in the disperser carousel."

This spot diagram considers only the spectrograph collimator and camera, and treats the pinhole grid as an array of point sources.

The resulting pseudoslit fills the full width of the detector, and is dispersed across the full length. It therefore has the same field angle requirements on the camera as the low-resolution mode with its larger spatial field of view. Figure 17 shows a configuration spot matrix for the center K-band wavelength for five spaxel \u201dfield\u201d points along each of the 18 slices.

The optical bench, almost all mechanisms (with exception of the cryogenic field steering mirror), mirror mounts and mirrors themselves (with exception of the tip/tilt mirror) will be machined out of 6061. Recent advances in single point diamond turning and polishing of special alloys of aluminum (RSA) have resulted in achievable surface roughnesses of reliably < 5 nm RMS. We have performed physical optics modeling to confirm that these surface roughnesses and the expected power spectral density curve for figure error will be adequate for coronagraphy at mid-infrared wavelengths. Utilizing aluminum for the optical bench, mounts and optics allows us to align the complicated optical system at room temperature.\nWe have in hand the flat mirror FM3 (Figure 4). Because it will be mounted to a piezoelectric tip/tilt stage it has been constructed out of aluminum 443 rather than 6061 (to match the materials of the stage to which it is mounted). The fine grain structure of Al 443 is not as optimal as RSA 6061 for achieving exceptional surface smoothness, so it has been nickel-plated before the final reflective gold coating.
