Expansion to Diverse Protein Targets: Investigate the applicability of the Bind&Bite method to a broader range of proteins beyond the HIV-1 envelope protein. This could include proteins of therapeutic interest, such as antibodies, enzymes, and receptor proteins, to assess the versatility and limitations of this approach in various contexts, including therapeutic protein modification, biosensors development, and targeted drug delivery systems.

Improving the Efficiency and Selectivity of the Method: Explore the optimization of the Bind&Bite methodology by varying the coiled-coil peptide sequences, length, and composition to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the covalent modification. This could involve the use of computational modeling and machine learning algorithms to predict optimal peptide sequences that achieve high selectivity and binding affinity with minimal off-target interactions.

Application in Live Cell Environments: Extend the application of the Bind&Bite method to live cell systems to study protein dynamics, localization, and protein-protein interactions in real time. This would involve developing cell-permeable versions of the coiled-coil peptides and ensuring the method's compatibility with cellular environments, potentially leading to new insights in cell biology and novel strategies for targeting intracellular proteins.

Development of a Toolkit for Multiplexed Protein Labeling: Utilize the positional encoding selectivity demonstrated with the mutually selective peptide pairs to develop a comprehensive toolkit for multiplexed protein labeling. This would enable simultaneous modification of multiple different proteins within the same system, facilitating complex studies in proteomics, multi-target drug delivery systems, and the construction of multifunctional biomolecular assemblies.

Exploring Therapeutic and Diagnostic Applications: Leverage the site-selective protein modification capability of the Bind&Bite method for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic tools. This could include the creation of precisely modified biomolecular conjugates for targeted drug delivery, the development of enhanced imaging agents for diagnostic applications, and the design of protein-based sensors for biomarker detection in clinical samples. Additionally, exploring the method's potential in vaccine development, particularly in the precise presentation of antigens for improved immunogenicity, could be a fruitful area of research.
