    "abstractText": "The extant literature has accumulated enormous knowledge on personality prediction from digital records on social networking sites (e.g., photo selfies). However, little is known about how short video selfies reflect their owner\u2019s personality and how people judge others\u2019 personalities from short video selfies. Taking short video selfies is very popular today; many people are willing to share their short video selfies with others. Based on the lens model theory, it is expected that one\u2019s personality is associated with short video selfies. By analyzing 177 Chinese TikTok (Douyin in China) users\u2019 short video selfies and their Big Five personalities, it showed that specific cues in short video selfies related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. But only extraversion could be predicted by short video selfies accurately. This study is the first to reveal personality-related cues in short video selfies and has practical implications for both short video platforms and their users.",

However, little is known about how short video selfies reflect their owner\u2019s personality and how people judge others\u2019 personalities from short video selfies. Taking short video selfies is very popular today; many people are willing to share their short video selfies with others. Based on the lens model theory, it is expected that one\u2019s personality is associated with short video selfies. By analyzing 177 Chinese TikTok (Douyin in China) users\u2019 short video selfies and their Big Five personalities, it showed that specific cues in short video selfies related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. But only extraversion could be\u00a0 predicted by short video selfies accurately. This study is the first to reveal personality-related cues in short video selfies and has practical implications for both short video platforms and their users.\nKEYWORDS\nbig five personality, short video selfie, TikTok (Douyin in China), the lens model, zeroacquaintance judgment\nIntroduction\nPersonality could be\u00a0captured from not only individuals\u2019 environments (e.g., books or magazines in one\u2019s bedroom, Gosling et\u00a0al., 2002), but also digital records on social networking sites (Azucar et\u00a0al., 2018). Research has shown that personality could be\u00a0predicted through a tiny movement (e.g., clicking \u201cLike,\u201d commenting) in social media and a considerable body of knowledge has accrued from research on personality expression and perception in digital records (e.g., Kosinski et\u00a0al., 2013; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). For example, Kosinski et\u00a0al. (2013) collected \u201cLike\u201d data from Facebook and found that openness was strongly associated with \u201cLike.\u201d Moreover, prior studies demonstrated that personality expression in social media differs in different situations (Gosling et\u00a0 al., 2002). For instance, Conscientiousness was related to friendliness in Facebook profiles (Hall and Pennington, 2013). Openness was associated with sociability in Instagram profiles (Cooper et\u00a0al., 2020). Extraverts are active in using different functions to improve the quality of short videos in TikTok (Meng and Leung, 2021). Even so, little is known about how personality is related to short video selfies.\nShort video selfies refer to short self-portrait videos taken by oneself using a smartphone for posting on short video platforms. The short video apps provide people with the convenience of taking short video selfies and sharing them with the public. Since its launch in 2016, the leading short video platform TikTok has gained global success (Scherr and Wang, 2021). In September"

Compared to other social networking sites (i.e., Sina Weibo), people are more proactive in posting short video selfies on short video platforms (CINIC, 2021). Furthermore, compared with pictures, sounds, and texts, short video selfies contain richer cues that could reflect an individual\u2019s personality. For example, the movement could only be\u00a0seen in videos. In this line, we\u00a0might capture people\u2019s personalities from their short video selfies.\nThe study aims to identify personality-related cues in short video selfies and examine how people predict personality based on short video selfies. Since video is like the combination of many continuous photos and sounds, the studies on personality and photos, selfies, and videos, and the lens model (the theoretical basis of the current study) are reviewed below. Moreover, people in different levels of demographic variables (i.e., gender and age) might differentially use social applications (e.g., Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015; Sorokowska et\u00a0al., 2016; Kim and Chock, 2017; Arpaci, 2018; Kaurin et\u00a0al., 2018) and prior studies have found that the stereotypes of gender and age could influence observers\u2019 personality judgment (Kenny et\u00a0al., 1992). Thus, the present study will examine the relationship between demographic variables (i.e., gender and age) and short video selfies cues."

            "heading": "Background research",
            "text": "Personality expression in photos, selfies, and videos\nResearch has shown a connection between self-reported personality and photos based on different photographs, such as standard photographs and spontaneous photographs (e.g., Naumann et\u00a0al., 2009; Nestler et\u00a0al., 2012; Cooper et\u00a0al., 2020; Campbell et\u00a0al., 2022). For example, Naumann et\u00a0al. (2009) coded the participants\u2019 spontaneous photographs and found that extraversion was positively associated with smiling. Nestler et\u00a0 al. (2012) found that conscientiousness was positively associated with attractiveness, and openness was positively related to the volume of mouth based on the standard photographs. Other studies used photos posted on social media taken by experimenters. They found conscientiousness was positively associated with self-generated albums and video uploads on Facebook, while neuroticism and extraversion were positively associated with photo uploads on Facebook (Eftekhar et\u00a0al., 2014). Moreover, Cooper et\u00a0al. (2020) accessed one\u2019s personality through the situational and behavioral features of photos on Instagram, and found that openness was positively related to sociability.\nPrior research has provided robust evidence on the relationship between selfies posted on social media and the Big Five personalities (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015; Sorokowska et\u00a0al., 2016; Choi et\u00a0al., 2017). Several studies investigated the question through self-reported data. For example, Sorokowska et\u00a0al. (2016) analyzed the frequency of online selfie-posting on various online social networking, demonstrating that extroverts prefer to post selfies on social media. Choi et\u00a0al. (2017) committed that openness was associated with online social connections negatively using selfies. Other studies explored the relationship by coding the selfies posted on social media. For example, Qiu et\u00a0al. (2015) coded users\u2019 selfies on Sina Weibo and found their committed agreeableness was positively associated with eyes looking\nat the camera in selfies. Kaurin et\u00a0al. (2018) coded the recent selfies uploaded on social media and found that extraversion was positively associated with selfies with a pet. In addition, research has shown a connection between narcissistic personality and selfies (e.g., ShaneSimpson et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020; Koterba et\u00a0al., 2021). For example, Wang et\u00a0al. (2020) found that narcissistic individuals are more likely to post their selfies on social media because they are satisfied with their bodies.\nMoreover, prior research has tried to explore the relationship between videos and personality. For example, Potard et\u00a0al. (2020) investigated the relationship between video game players\u2019 profiles and Big Five personalities, and found that role-playing video games were positively associated with openness. Hickman et\u00a0al. (2022) explored the interviewers\u2019 Big Five personalities\u2019 assessment through automated video interviews (AVIs), and found that AVI personality assessments had evidence of reliability. Kaurin et\u00a0 al. (2018) coded the selfintroductory videos and found the highest correlation between personality and videos. However, they did not focus on short video selfies in non-laboratory conditions (e.g., the selfies in TikTok). Furthermore, researchers have examined the relationship between Big Five personality and short video (i.e., TikTok) engagement behaviors, and found that people with high extraversion are active in using different functions to improve the quality of short videos (Meng and Leung, 2021).\nCompared to photos and selfies, short video selfies could provide unique cues that may reflect people\u2019s personalities. One of the motivations for shooting and submitting short videos is recording and sharing (Dong and Xie, 2019). As the motivation for recording their owners\u2019 lives, short video selfies may contain more vital cues of personality, which could provide a better view of personality than photos and selfies. Short video selfies give individuals enough time to perform themselves rather than a flash recording like photos. Specifically, users could present their activities in the short videos, which contain more information such as their emotions and voices. Moreover, compared to photos and selfies, watchers could receive the information more straightly and could better understand what and why uploaders want to send messages to their audiences. Thus, short video selfies may contain richer cues unavailable in photos and selfies.\nThe effect of age and gender on personality expression on social networking\nPrior research suggested that demographic variables (i.e., gender and age) of uploaders could influence the relationship between personality expression and selfies on social networking sites (e.g., Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015; Sorokowska et\u00a0al., 2016; Kim and Chock, 2017; Arpaci, 2018; Kaurin et\u00a0al., 2018). On the one hand, it is different to use social applications among people in various levels of demographic variables (i.e., gender and age). For instance, compared to men, women are likely to spend more time on selfies-post, and the connection of narcissism with selfie-posting behavior is significant for men rather than women (Arpaci, 2018). Kim and Chock (2017) suggested that the need for popularity promotes solo selfies among men, not women. Furthermore, they found that younger people are more likely to post solo selfies than older people (Weiser, 2015). On the other hand, observers\u2019 personality judgment could be\u00a0influenced by the stereotypes\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nof gender and age (Kenny et\u00a0al., 1992). For example, Qiu et\u00a0al. (2012) explored how words on Twitter reflect users\u2019 personalities and found that observers might rely on the stereotypes of gender and age rather than valid linguistic cues when judging personality.\nAccording to a survey of TikTok (Douyin in China) in 2018 (iResearch, 2020), TikTok users were more likely to be\u00a0females and younger. Over 50% users of TikTok are females (in 2017 and 2018, female accounted for 63.0 and 59.0%, respectively). TikTok users consist of people from children to older, and most users are 21\u201325 years (in 2018, males and females accounted for 40.1 and 50.0%, respectively). Thus, the age and gender of TikTok uploaders might influence the relationship between personality expression and short video selfies."

            "text": "The lens model helped define and learn interpersonal judgment (Brunswik, 1956) and was widely used in personality judgment (e.g., Nestler et\u00a0al., 2012; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2012, 2015; Kaurin et\u00a0al., 2018; Proyer and Brauer, 2018). The lens model hypothesizes that several visual cues could characterize a given personality trait. And observers could recognize the given trait through the same cues (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). For example, personality traits such as neuroticism could be\u00a0explained by unstable mood (observable cue). Meanwhile, people could judge neuroticism based on varying perspectives. In other words, the accuracy of personality judgment from the lens model depends on the observable cues from the environment. The cues could be\u00a0considered as a mediator between self-report personality and assessment of personality (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). Based on the hypothesis, four indicators will be\u00a0used to reflect the accuracy and validation of short video cues in the judgment of personality (see Figure\u00a01).\nAccuracy (ra) connected the self-report personality with the personality judgment, with a stronger correlation indicating more accuracy. Cue validity (re) is the degree of association between cues\n(ye) and self-report personality (Ye), with a stronger correlation suggesting better validity. Cue utilization (rs) is the link between cues (ys) and the judgment of personality (Ys), and a strong correlation indicates that the cue is more utilized when forming personality judgments. Cue sensitivity (G) is the correlation between cue validity (re) and cue utilization (rs), with a higher correlation indicating that cues could reflect the given personality well. We\u00a0will adopt this model to examine how personality is expressed in short videos and what given cues people could use to judge one\u2019s personality from the short videos."

            "heading": "Procedure",
            "text": "All participants completed a two-part online survey, were informed about the study, and provided informed written consent. The first part comprises the Big Five personality scale (Mini-IPIP, Donnellan et\u00a0al., 2006). The second part asked participants about their TikTok user ID, the frequency of recording videos and posting them online, and demographic variables (i.e., gender and age).\nThen, we\u00a0 observed the online videos of all participants and identified which of these videos were selfies (0 = No, 1 = Yes). To code the short video selfies, we\u00a0first selected photos/selfies-coding that are appropriate for coding short video selfies from past researches, because short video selfies were similar to photo selfies (e.g., Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015; Kaurin et\u00a0 al., 2018). Combining the characteristics of short video selfies, the codes were retained as follows: Camera in front (0 = face away from the camera, 1 = face the camera); Eyes looking at the camera (0 = not looking at the camera, 1 = looking at the camera); Emotional unchanged (0 = emotional changed, 1 = emotional unchanged); Smile (0 = not smile, 1 = smile); Face visibility (0 = part of face, 1 = complete face); The whole body(0 = part of body, 1 = whole body); Camera height (0 = below or the same level of head, 1 = above head); Photoshop editing (0 = no photoshop editing, 1 = photoshop editing); and Alone (0 = over 1 person in the short video selfies, 1 = only 1 person in the short video selfies). Moreover, we\u00a0added cues that are unique for short video selfies. First, users can choose their performances or real lives to share with others through the short video platform. Thus, we\u00a0 added the code of \u201cacting\u201d (0 = real life, 1 = performance/acting). Second, people could control the shooting time and switch camera angles freely when taking short video selfies. Thus, the code of \u201cshooting from the same angle\u201d (0 = shooting from the different angles, 1 = shooting from the same angle) was used in the study. Third, similar to photoshop editing, users could edit their short video selfies. For example, users could add some special effects that the apps provided freely and present subtitles to embellish their short video selfies. Therefore, the codes of \u201cvideo effects\u201d (e.g., switch scene; 0 = no video effects, 1 = video effects) and \u201csubtitle\u201d (0 = no subtitle, 1 = subtitle) were added to the cues. Forth, users could take short video selfies with the help of their surroundings and tools. Thus, the codes of \u201csituational cues\u201d (e.g., classroom; 0 = no situational cues, 1 = situational cues) and \u201ctools\u201d (e.g., besom; 0 = no tools, 1 = tools) were used. Finally, short video selfies contain not only selfies, but also background music. Users could add a period of background music to their short videos freely or choose the original sound as background for short videos. According to interactionist theories of music, the musical environments that people select could reflect their psychological traits (Buss, 1987; Anderson et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, the background music that users selected in the short video selfies (0 = no background music, 1 = background music) was adopted as a cue to capture users\u2019 personalities. Consequently, the study contained a total of 17 cues: Selfie; Acting; Camera in front; Shooting from the same\nangle; Eyes looking at the camera; Emotional unchanged; Smile; Face visibility; The whole body; Camera height; Video effects; Photoshop editing; Subtitle; Background music; Situational cues; Tools; and Alone.\nTwo independent raters were chosen to code the cues. We\u00a0adopted zero-acquaintance personality judgment following prior studies (e.g., Borkenau and Liebler, 1992; Kr\u00e4mer and Winter, 2008; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015), which means all coders are unfamiliar with participants. The coders need to observe all short videos of participants, code them, and then judge whether the short videos match the above cues. Moreover, the coding consistency should be\u00a0at least 90%. If an item received inconsistent coding from two raters, another rater recoded the item and made the final judgment. Then, the number of cues was obtained and the proportion of cues was calculated (e.g., the proportion of acting = the number of acting/the number of selfies *100%). Finally, two undergraduate students who majored in psychology and were unfamiliar with participants, were selected as observer1 and observer2. They browsed each short video and rated their impression of the selfie owner\u2019s personality using the same Big Five personality scale that the participants used. Then the observers\u2019 ratings were aggregated by calculating the average score of observed personalities."

The results showed that observers\u2019 ratings reached a moderate consensus on all five personality dimensions, which means that observers might use the same cues for rating short video owners\u2019 personalities. Specifically, the consensus of observers\u2019 rating of openness is the highest (ICC = 0.40). On the other hand, we\u00a0 used aggregated observer accuracy (i.e., the correlation between the aggregated observers\u2019 rating and self-report personality) to measure the accuracy of observers\u2019 personality judgment. However, the reliability of aggregated observers\u2019 ratings on personality in a single analysis (i.e., aggregated accuracy) might be\u00a0boosted because of aggregation (Vazire and Mehl, 2008).

People with high extroversion tend to be\u00a0more sociable and high-performance (Amichai-Hamburger and Vinitzky, 2010). The results suggested that observers considered that people with high extroversion upload selfies and acting shows to short video platforms to convey their social contact and performance. However, ratings of extraversion were negatively associated with tools (r = \u22120.14, p < 0.05), suggesting that people with high extraversion are less likely to use tools in short videos.

First, the prior study suggested that agreeableness was positively associated with smiling and positive emotion words (Mehl et\u00a0al., 2006; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). In the study, smile was positively related to self-report agreeableness and other-rating agreeableness. However, in the mediating analysis, controlling for gender and age, the indirect effect was not significant (indirect effect size = 0.02, SE = 0.02, 95%CI = [\u22120.002, 0.06]). Second, the results showed that acting was positively related to self-reported and other-rating extraversion. In the present study, controlling for gender and age, the total effect of selfreport extraversion on other-rating extraversion was significant (effect size = 0.15, SE = 0.07, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.29]), the direct effect of selfreport extraversion on other-rating extraversion was significant (effect size = 0.12, SE = 0.07, 95%CI = [\u22120.02, 0.26]), and the indirect effect of self-report extraversion on other-rating extraversion through acting was significant (effect size = 0.03, SE = 0.02, 95%CI = [0.002, 0.08]). The result suggested that the acting partly mediated the self-other report extraversion. The pattern of results was identical without controlling\nfor gender and age. Specifically, without controlling for gender and age, the indirect effect of self-report extraversion on other-rating extraversion through acting was still significant (effect size = 0.03, SE = 0.02, 95%CI = [0.001, 0.08])."

Regarding the relation between short video selfies cues and age, the results showed that age was negatively correlated with video effects (r = \u22120.17, p < 0.05), suggesting that older are less likely to use video effects to modify their videos and present original images to others.\nMoreover, prior studies have evidenced that there are stereotypes in observer judgments of personality (e.g., Kenny et\u00a0al., 1992; Gosling et\u00a0al., 2002; Graham and Gosling, 2012; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). Thus, the influence of stereotypes of age and gender on observers\u2019 personality judgment was examined. Following prior studies (e.g., Kenny et\u00a0al., 1992; Gosling et\u00a0al., 2002; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015), we\u00a0tested cue utilization without controlling age and gender. Compared to the cue utilization controlling age and gender, three of the initial 14 significant correlations became insignificant [i.e., the correlation between acting and neuroticism (r = \u22120.10, p > 0.05), camera in front and neuroticism (r = 0.06, p > 0.05), tools, and extraversion (r = \u22120.07, p > 0.05)] became insignificant, and 11 (78.5%) out of 14 correlations remained statistically significant, without controlling age and gender, suggesting that observers\u2019 personality judgment mainly relied on short video selfie cues rather than the stereotypes of gender and age."

            "text": "The current study explored the relationship between personality and social media use by testing personality expression and perception in short video selfies, a new form of self-portrait in social media. Through the lens model, a few short video selfie cues were identified in personality expression and perception. For example, extroverts prefer to post selfies and act on short video platforms, and people with high agreeableness prefer smiling in short video selfies. Specifically, acting mediated the self-report extraversion and other-rating extraversion. Moreover, regarding accuracy and sensitivity, the study found similar results to previous studies on photos and selfies (Naumann et\u00a0al., 2009; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). In short video selfies, raters were sensitive to extraversion when rating individual personality traits based on coding cues, which is different from prior findings where raters were most susceptible to openness in photos and selfies (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2015). Finally, the relationship between demographic variables (i.e., gender and age) and short video selfies was tested, and the impact of the stereotypes of age and gender on personality judgment was excluded."

            "text": "The findings of this study have important theoretical implications. First, the results contribute to the literature on personality expression on social networking sites. The study reveals that short video selfies contain valid personality-related cues, expanding prior findings that people\u2019s digital footprints on social media could reveal their personality traits (Amichai-Hamburger and Vinitzky, 2010; Barry et\u00a0 al., 2019; Qiu et\u00a0 al., 2019). Moreover, the relationship between personality expression and perception in photos and selfies on social\nmedia was revealed through the lens model (Naumann et\u00a0al., 2009; Ong et\u00a0 al., 2011; Nestler et\u00a0 al., 2012; Qiu et\u00a0 al., 2015). Thus, the findings of short video selfies increase our understanding of personality expression and perception on social media through the lens model. Second, the study expands the scope of research on personality and short video selfies by showing that personality might be\u00a0related to short video selfie cues in non-laboratory conditions. Prior studies identified the relationship between personality and standardized videos in the lab condition (e.g., Kaurin et\u00a0al., 2018); however, based on the present study, more short video cues were identified, such as acting and background music.\nOur research has several vital practical implications. On the one hand, with the growing number of short video selfies, it is meaningful to understand how short video selfies reflect personality. Prior studies have demonstrated that personality could be\u00a0an important antecedent of job performance (Judge et\u00a0al., 1999), health (Soldz and Vaillant, 1999), and subjective well-being (Hayes and Joseph, 2003). Short video selfies could represent a fast and affordable method to predict personality, which could reveal some health-related information (Gale et\u00a0 al., 2015; Azucar et\u00a0 al., 2018) and improve the efficacy of interventions (Chapman et\u00a0 al., 2014). On the other hand, a few commercial applications (e.g., TikTok and Kuaishou) could improve their recommender system by learning personality and enhancing user experience (Farnadi et\u00a0al., 2016)."

            "heading": "Limitations and future direction",
            "text": "The present study has several limitations which need to be\u00a0addressed in the future. First, we\u00a0recruited users only from TikTok. Future research needs to examine whether our findings can be\u00a0generalized to other short video platforms such as Kuaishou and WeSee. Second, prior research has examined the relationship between personality with the different elements of music, such as music genres, acoustic features, psychological attributes, and lyrics (Rentfrow and Gosling, 2003; Rentfrow et\u00a0al., 2011; Greenberg et\u00a0al., 2016; Pilgrim et\u00a0al., 2017; Qiu et\u00a0al., 2019). However, short videos are not classified. Future research could investigate the latent factors that express short videos by categorizing short videos and then explore the relationship between the latent factors and personality. Third, prior studies suggested the relationship between personality expression and music preference (Rentfrow and Gosling, 2003; Qiu et\u00a0 al., 2019). Nevertheless, the short video cues encoded in the study were limited to the presence or absence of background music. Future research could explore the connection of personality expression with music preference in short videos. Forth, it is far from enough that 17 short video selfies cues were explored in the study, other important cues (i.e., the shooting position change) could be\u00a0investigated in future studies. Fifth, in the study, only two coders participated in the work of judgment of personality, which might influence the accuracy of results. Future studies could invite more participants to judge the personality of short video users as an observer to expand the results of the present study. Last but not least, future studies could incorporate short video selfie cues that could reflect people\u2019s personalities (e.g., acting) into machine algorithms to promote the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning in predicting personality traits based on the results.\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org"
