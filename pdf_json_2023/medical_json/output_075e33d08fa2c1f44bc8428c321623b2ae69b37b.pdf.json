In cancer tissues, LIF binds a heterodimeric receptor (LIFR), formed by a LIFR\u03b2 subunit and glycoprotein(gp)130, promoting epithelial mesenchymal\ntransition and cell growth. Bile acids are cholesterol metabolites generated at the interface of host metabolism and the intestinal microbiota. Here we demonstrated that bile acids serve as endogenous antagonist to LIFR in oncogenesis. The tissue characterization of bile acids content in non-cancer\nand cancer biopsy pairs from gastric adenocarcinomas (GC) demonstrated that bile acids accumulate within cancer tissues, with glyco-deoxycholic acid (GDCA) functioning as negative regulator of LIFR expression. In patient-derived organoids (hPDOs) from GC patients, GDCA reverses LIF-induced stemness and proliferation. In summary, we have identified the secondary bile acids as the first endogenous antagonist to LIFR supporting a development of bile acid-based therapies in LIF-mediated oncogenesis.\nKeywords: Bile acids, Gastrointestinal cancer, LIF/LIFR axis, GDCA, hPDOs\n3"

            "text": "Bile acids are atypical steroids generated in the human body by the coordinate activity of\nliver and bacterial enzymes 1. In the liver, two major metabolic pathways, known as the classical and the alternative, transform cholesterol into primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (CA and CDCA) that, after conjugation with taurine (T) or glycine (G), are secreted in the biliary tree and then released in the intestine3. In the small intestine, bile salts are first deconjugated and then dehydroxylated by the intestinal microbiota, giving rise to secondary bile acids, lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid (LCA and DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)6. The majority of\nprimary bile acids (95%) are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and transported back to the liver through the entero-hepatic circulation, while the majority of LCA is excreted with the faeces3. Other bile acid species, that are generated at the host/microbial interface, are the 3-, 7-and 12- oxo derivatives, allo-derivatives and iso-allo derivatives8. The biological functions of these bile acids are still poorly understood although there is growing interest for their potential as immune/metabolic mediators10.\nBile acids have been linked to cancer development12,14. Because their amphipathic structure,\nhigh luminal content and detergent effects on cell membranes, bile acids have been historically considered as potential cancer-promoting agents in entero-hepatic tissues.12,16 However, the\nepithelial-damaging effects, underlying these pro-oncogenic properties, manifest at concentrations of bile acids > 100 \u00b5M while, at physiological intracellular concentrations (that are in the nanomicromolamolar range), bile acids are not cytotoxic and function as signalling molecules activating a family of cell membrane and nuclear receptors, known as bile acid-activated receptors, that\nmaintains tissue and immune homeostasis. The Farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), a receptor for primary bile acids18, and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1)20, a receptor for secondary bile acids, are the two main bile acid sensors, functioning as integrative hubs between the intestinal microbiota and host metabolism and immunity22. Of relevance, FXR and GPBAR1 activation by\n4\nnatural and synthetic agonists24,26 confers protection against colorectal cancers development, while their genetic ablation promotes entero-hepatic tumorigenesis in animal models28,30,31. Together these data suggest that, while high intraluminal concentrations of bile acids in the gastro-intestinal tract\npromote epithelial damage and inflammation-driven metaplasia, physiological levels contribute to maintenance of epithelial homeostasis by regulating epithelial barrier integrity, maintaining intestinal stemness and immune and microbial homeostasis32,33. However, there is no information of\nbile acids intratumor concentrations in the large majority of cancers.\nIn addition to FXR and GPBAR1, bile acids serve as non-exclusive ligands for other nuclear\nreceptors, including the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR)34, vitamin-D-receptor (VDR)35, peroxisomeproliferator activated receptors (PPARs)36, liver-X-receptors (LXRs)37 and the retinoid orphanrelated receptor (ROR) \u03b3T38, and membrane receptors such as the Sphingosine 1 receptor (SP1R)239 and M2/M3 muscarinic receptors 40,41. In these settings, bile acids function as receptor agonists and, up to now, there is no evidence that bile acids might function as direct antagonists to any receptor.\nThe leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a member of interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine\u2019s family\nsecreted by epithelial cells and monocytes42. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating differentiation, proliferation and survival in embryo and adult cells. LIF is also involved in cancer growth and\ninvasiveness driving epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in pancreatic colon and gastric adenocarcinomas5,43\u201346 but also in extraintestinal cancers47. In target cells, LIF binds to an heterodimeric complex formed by two subunits, the LIF receptor (LIFR) and the glycoprotein (gp) 13046. In addition to LIF, the LIFR/gp130 heterodimer is also activated, although in a non-exclusive manner, by oncostatin M (OSM) which, in addition, transduces its signalling through a specific receptor complex made up by OSMR/gp13048. LIFR may also participate to the formation of tripartite receptor complexes with gp130 and the CNTF receptor activated by cardiotrophin 1 (CT1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and neuropoietin (NP)49,50. Binding of LIF to the LIFR/gp130 complex leads to a gp130-dependent phosphorylation\nof the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3 that in turn is central in regulating the\n5\nimmune response and results activated in the majority of human cancers 51. In previous studies, we have reported that BAR502 52\u201354, a semisynthetic steroidal agonist of FXR and GPBAR1, exerts a tumour suppressor effect by acting as LIFR antagonist and STAT3 indirect inhibitor 5.\nBuilding on this background, we have investigated whether natural bile acids might function\nas LIFR antagonists. Our results demonstrate that secondary bile acids are natural LIFR antagonists identifying DCA, GDCA, TDCA and 3-oxoDCA as the most potent endogenous antagonists of\nLIFR. Additionally, analysis of bile acids species in GC paired samples demonstrated that the tissue expression of LIFR is inversely correlated with the tumour content of GDCA and that tissue content of GDCA declines in the GC compared with non-neoplastic paired samples. Together, these studies prove that bile acids are LIFR antagonists and that a reduced content of GDCA in GC tissues\ncontributes to enhance LIF-LIFR-STAT3 signalling.\n6"

The reaction was conducted at 0\u00b0C with excellent yield (Scheme 1). Tauro- and glyco-conjugated 3-oxolithocholic acid were synthesized, using EDC, DIPEA and a catalytic amount of HOBt as coupling reagents for compound T-3-oxoLCA (quantitative yield) and subsequent basic hydrolysis to obtain with quantitative yield the compound G-3-oxoLCA. Scheme 1a\n7\naReagents and conditions: a) CrO3, H2SO4, Acetone, 0\u00b0C, 80%; b) EDC .HCl, HOBt, DIPEA dry, DMF dry, taurine or glycine methylester, quantitative yield; c) NaOH, H2O:MeOH 1:1 v/v, quantitative yield. 3-oxocholic acid (3-oxoCA) was synthesized by regioselective C3 oxidation of cholic acid using Fetizon's reagent (scheme 2, panel A). Firstly, CA was esterified with Fisher esterification (p-TSA in CH3OH). The corresponding methyl ester was then refluxed in freshly distilled toluene with 2 equiv. of Fetizon's reagent (silver carbonate on Celite). Crude mixture was finally submitted to alkaline hydrolysis with NaOH in CH3OH, affording the desired 3-ketocholic acid (90% yield). Scheme 2a\naReagents and conditions: a) p-TsOH, in MeOH dry, quantitative yield; b) Ag2CO3 on celite, toluene dry, reflux, 60%; c) NaOH, MeOH:H2O 1:1 v/v, reflux, 90%; d) p-TsOH, MeOH dry, quantitative yield; e)\n8\nTBSCl, imidazole, in DMF dry: pyridine dry 2:1 v/v, 0\u00b0C, 60%; f) acetic anhydride in pyridine dry, 90%; g) TBAF, THF dry, 78% ; h) CrO3, H2SO4, acetone, 70%; i) NaOH, MeOH:H2O 1:1 v/v, reflux, 90%.\nUnfortunately, using the same oxidative condition to the deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the reactions were not successful and very low yields were obtained. Alternatively, after TBS protection of the hydroxyl at C3, the hydroxyl at C12 and C7 of DCA and UDCA were acetylated, respectively, in order to obtain compounds 5 and 6. After TBAF deprotection, Jones oxidation at C3, followed by alkaline hydrolysis, furnished 3-oxoDCA and 3-oxoUDCA. Finally, we therefore chemically synthesized unique secondary bile acids, including \u03945,6-Lithocholic acid (LCA), alloLCA, 3-oxo-alloLCA, and isoalloLCA. All these secondary bile acids have a \u201cflat\u201d shape that results in an A/B-trans orientation. To achieve these 5\u03b1-cholane derivatives, HDCA methyl ester was firstly monoprotected at C3 with TBSCl and then activated at C6 with p-toluensolfonyl chloride, obtaining compound 9 that was subjected to elimination at C6 and then deprotection at C3 with TBAF. Hydrolysis at C24 furnished \u03945,6-LCA, while an aliquot of compound 11 was hydrogenated to afford the required A/B trans ring junction. Finally, hydrolysis at methyl ester gave AlloLCA, that was subjected to Jones oxidation in the same experimental condition previously described, to afford 3-oxo-AlloLCA. To obtain isoalloLCA, compound 12 was prepared in a multi-step procedure, involving ditosylation at C3 and C6, simultaneous inversion at the C3 position and elimination at the C6 position and deacetylation at C3, as previously described 2,4 Hydrogenation of double bond with H2 and Pd(OH)2/C and hydrolysis of methyl ester furnished IsoAlloLCA.\nScheme 3a\naReagents and conditions: a) TBSCl, imidazole, DMF:pyridine 2:1, 0\u00b0C, 60%; b) p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine dry, quantitative yield; c) LiBr, Li2CO3 in DMF dry, quantitative yield; d) TBAF, in THF dry, quantitative yield; e) H2, Pd(OH)2/C degussa type, THF: MeOH dry 1:1 v/v, quantitative yield; f) NaOH, MeOH:H2O 1:1 v/v, reflux, 60-80%; g) CrO3, H2SO4, acetone, 0\u00b0C, 80%.\n9\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and solvents and reagents were used as supplied from commercial sources with some exception. Tetrahydrofuran and toluene were distilled from calcium hydride immediately prior to use. All reaction were carried using flame-dried glassware. Reaction progress was monitored via thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Alugram silica gel G/UV254 plates. The purification of synthetized compounds was carried out by flash chromatography on Biotage\u00ae Selekt.

Then, 20 mg of each sample was manually homogenized using a potter pestle and dissolved in MeOH at a final concentration 100 \u00b5g/\u00b5L for an opportune extraction for 2 h. Finally, they were diluted 5 times in a solution made of 50% H2O/50% MeOH, 0.1% formic acid (FA) and 5 mM ammonium acetate (AmAc). Stock solutions of the individual BAs were distinctly prepared in MeOH, mixed and diluted in 50% H2O/50% MeOH, 5 mM AmAc and 0.1% FA to obtain the calibration standards ranging from 25 nM to 400 nM. UHPLC-MRM-MS analyses were performed on a QTRAP 6500 (AB Sciex) equipped Shimadzu Nexera LC and Auto Sampler systems. A mixture of 35 BAs was detached on a Luna Omega 1.6 \u03bcm Polar (C18, 100 \u00c5, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm; Phenomenex) at 40\u00b0C, and at a flow rate of 400 \u03bcl/min. Mobile phase A was H2O, 5 mM AmAc, 0.1% FA, and mobile phase B was MeOH, 5 mM AmAc, 0.1% FA. The gradient started at 50% B, increased to 55% B in 3.5 min and then to 95% B in 19.5 min, was kept at 95% B for 1 min and then decreased to 50% B and was kept to re-equilibrate for 6 min. Q-TRAP 6500 was operated in negative MRM scanning mode with the following parameters: Negative mode: declustering potential (DP) at -150 V, entrance potential (EP) at -12 V, collision energy (CE) at -15V and cell exit potential (CXP) at -30 V. Curtain gas was set at 30, ion source gas 1 and 2 at 25 and ion spray voltage at -4500. Resolution Q1 and Q2 was unitary. For quantification, the extracts were injected alongside the calibration mixtures.

            "text": "In this study, 35 different bile acids, including primary and secondary bile acids, their oxo-\nderivatives and some conjugated forms were tested. While 24 compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, 11 different derivatives (G-3-oxoLCA, T-3-oxoLCA, 3-oxoUDCA, 3-oxoAlloLCA, and \u03945,6-LCA, 3-oxoLCA, 3-oxoCDCA, 3-oxoCA, 3-oxoDCA, AlloLCA, and\nIsoAlloLCA, Figure S1) of this large library of compounds were synthetized and reported here in Figure 1 A-B. Full details of the synthesis are given in the experimental section.\nTo examine whether primary and secondary bile acids modulate the binding between LIF and LIFR, we have first settled up a cell free assay based on an Alpha Screen platform 9. Because natural bile acids activate the majority of their receptors in the 1-100 \u00b5M range55, the assays were carried out using this concentrations range and the potency of various bile acids in inhibiting LIF/LIFR interaction (IC50) was compared to that of two well characterized LIFR antagonists, EC35956 and mifepristone5. The results of these studies, shown in Figure 1A, demonstrated that, while among 35\ndifferent bile acids, only DCA, TDCA and 3-oxoLCA effectively inhibited LIF/LIFR interaction at 10 \u00b5M, the number of potential LIF/LIFR antagonists rose significantly at 50 \u00b5M, and almost all bile acids, except 3-oxoCA and HCA, prevented LIF/LIFR interaction at the concentration of 100 \u00b5M.At the concentration of 50 \u00b5M, CDCA, DCA, LCA and their Glyco (G), Tauro (T) and 3-oxo derivatives reduced LIFR activation by > 50%, and the inhibition rose to \u224880% at 100 \u00b5M.\nThe calculated IC50 for DCA and LCA and some of their derivatives was in the 10-20 \u00b5M range (Figure 1B). Thus, LIF/LIFR inhibition by various bile acids occurs in the same range of concentration as required for activation of membrane and nuclear receptors such as S1PR2, FXR and GPBAR155. These results demonstrated that bile acids might function as LIF/LIFR binding antagonists at physiological tissue concentrations (Figure 1B).\nPrevious studies have shown that binding of LIF to LIFR induces the assembly of a\nLIFR/gp130 heterodimer that recruits and activates the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which in turn\n27\nphosphorylates STAT343. Once phosphorylated, STAT3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus binding to STAT3 inducing elements (SIE) and the promoter of target genes. To test whether bile acids interfere with the signalling pathway, we challenged HepG2 cells, a hepatic cancer cell line,\ntransfected with viral vectors encoding for hLIFR and gp130 and STAT3 responsive elements cloned upstream the Renilla luciferase gene5, with DCA and LCA. The results of these experiments, shown in Figure 1 D-E, confirmed that DCA and LCA and their T, G and the corresponding 3-oxo\nderivatives effectively inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation induced by LIF at concentrations < 10 \u00b5M. DCA and its derivatives were more potent than LCA analogues in abrogating LIF-induced phosphorylation and their respective IC50s were as follow: DCA \u2248 6.2 \u00b5M, TDCA \u2248 1.6 \u00b5M, GDCA \u2248 2.5 \u00b5M and 3-oxoDCA \u2248 2.2 \u00b5M (Figure 1 D). Similarly, LCA and its derivatives reduced STAT3\nphosphorylation though at slightly higher concentrations: LCA \u2248 4.7 \u00b5M, TLCA \u2248 3.5 \u00b5M, GLCA \u2248 9.8 \u00b5M and 3-oxoLCA \u2248 2 \u00b5M (Figure 1 E). Thus, secondary bile acids inhibit LIF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation at the same concentrations (1-2 \u00b5M) required for GPBAR1 activation20.\nTo disclose the molecular basis of LIF/LIFR inhibition by secondary bile acids, we have\nthen simulated the binding mode of DCA and its derivatives GDCA, TDCA and 3-oxoDCA and of two most active LCA derivatives, TLCA and 3-oxoLCA. We applied the same protocol used in our previous studies on LIFR inhibitors 5,9 consisting of two steps of docking calculations, better\ndiscussed in the Methods section, followed by 150 ns of Molecular Dynamics simulations (MDs). Docking calculations were addressed in the previously predicted pocket on the Ig-like domain D3, defined by the loops L2 and L3 involved in the LIF binding (Figure 2A). During 150 ns of MDs of the best docking poses, we observed a high flexibility mainly of the L3 loop, as already revealed for other inhibitors 5,9, which induces a continuous change in the shape of the binding site that affected also the binding stability of some ligands. Indeed, while compounds DCA, 3-oxoDCA, 3-oxoLCA and TDCA showed a stable binding inside the two loops L2 and L3, GDCA and TLCA demonstrated a less stable binding mode, as retrieved by the Ligand Root Mean Square Deviation\n28\n(L-RMSD) plot in Supporting information Figure S2A. Nonetheless, the most populated clusters of the most potent inhibitors analysed, TLCA, TDCA and 3-oxoLCA (Supporting Information Figure S2B and Table S2), shared similar interacting features (Supporting Information Figure S3).\nSpecifically, a salt-bridge between the sulfonic acid group and the K332 (loop L3) was retrieved in both the tauro conjugates (TDCA and TLCA) and between the glutamic acid group of 3-oxoLCA and R330 (loop L3). In addition, the rings C and D of the steroidal scaffold of TLCA, 3-oxoLCA\nand TDCA are sandwiched between Y342 of loop L3 and Y318 located in the \u03b2-sheet of the D3 domain, with the oxygen atom in position 3 engaging H-bonds interactions with the backbone of L2 loop residues R306, T308 and L310, respectively (Supporting information, Figures S3). The milder inhibitor DCA, during MDs, established a stable H-bond with T308, but its carboxylic group in the\nside chain did not show any stable interaction (Supporting information, Figures S3).\nInterestingly, both less potent LIFR inhibitors analysed, GDCA and 3-oxoDCA, did not\nshow any stable interaction between the functional groups in position 3 and residues in the loop L2, but only with residues bearing to loop L3. Additional polar and hydrophobic contacts contributed to further stabilize the interaction of bile acids with L2 or L3. In particular in the DCA series, the hydroxyl group at position 7 engaged an additional H-bond with T316 (in DCA, TDCA and GDCA) or with T338 (in 3-oxoDCA). Overall, the computational studies suggested that all ligands analysed\nbehaved as a wedge, separating the L2 and L3 loops, altering the conformation of the loops L2 and L3, which are highly involved in binding with LIF (Figure 2A).\nBecause the assembly of LIFR:gp130 complex is essential for LIFR signalling 7 (Figure 1C),\nwe then investigated whether bile acids impact on the formation of LIF/LIFR complex. For these studies, we have used GDCA since it is the most represented of LIFR antagonists detected in\ntumour (see below) and in MKN45 cells, a GC cell line. The results of the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) studies (Figure 2 B) demonstrated that, while exposure of MKN45 cells to LIF 10 ng/mL, promotes the assembly of the LIFR/gp130 complex (Figure 2B, lane 6), this pattern has been,\n29\nreversed by co-treating the cells with 3 \u00b5M of GDCA (Figure 2B lane 7). Together these results demonstrated that secondary bile acids prevent STAT3 phosphorylation induced by LIF inhibiting (altering/diminishing) the assembly of the LIFR/GP130 complex at cell membrane.\nLIFR antagonism exerts by DCA and LCA families limiting MKN45 cell proliferation and migration.\nTo functionally characterize the effect of DCA and LCA families as LIFR antagonists, we conducted several in vitro assays using the poorly differentiated human GC cell line, MKN45. As previously demonstrated, MKN45 exhibits high levels LIF and LIFR expression44, making it an ideal candidate for our investigation.\nFirst, we have explored whether DCA and its conjugated members, including TDCA, GDCA, and 3-oxoDCA, could modulate the proliferation of GC cells, mediated by LIF. MKN45 cells, cultured in serum-free medium, were exposed to 10 ng/mL LIF alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of DCA, TDCA, GDCA, and 3-oxoDCA (1-3-10-20 \u03bcM) for 8 hours. Cell vitality was assessed using the MTS assay as detailed in Material and Method extended section. Figure 3A shows that DCA did not reverse the LIF-induced proliferation, while TDCA exhibited a\nconcentration-dependent reduction in cell vitality. GDCA and 3-oxoDCA reduced LIF-induced proliferation at 3 \u03bcM, but not at higher concentrations.\nThe effect of DCA and its T, G and 3-oxo derivatives on cell replication was also evaluated by Ki67/7-AAD IC-FACS staining (Figure 3 B-C). Our findings demonstrated that challenging MKN45 with DCA and its derivatives modulates the cell cycle progression. More specifically, while LIF\nincreased the transition into S-G2-M cell cycle phase, this effect was reversed by the exposure to 3 \u03bcM of DCA, GDCA and 3-oxoDCA, leading to increased frequencies of cells in G0-G1 resting phase, thereby blocking the transition to the replicative S-G2-M cell cycle phase, in a statistically\nsignificant manner (Figure 3 C).\n30\nFurthermore, we have shown that DCA, TDCA, GDCA and 3-oxoDCA modulate the apoptosis cell rates, as assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD staining (Figure 3 D).\nSimilarly, we have investigated the impact of LIFR inhibition mediated by LCA and its T, G and 3- oxo derivatives on the growth and proliferation of GC cells. For this purpose, MKN45 were cultured in a serum free medium, and exposed to 10 ng/mL LIF alone or in combination with\nincreasing concentrations of above-mentioned natural bile acids (1, 3, 10, 20) for 8 h. As shown in Figure 3E, LCA reversed the LIF-induced proliferation at 10 \u03bcM concentration, while TLCA reduced cell vitality at the 3 \u03bcM concentration, GLCA blocked cells proliferation at 10 \u03bcM and 3-\noxoLCA reversed LIF-induced growth even at the lowest concentration of 1 \u03bcM, as measured by the MTS assay. Only GLCA modulated the cell cycle progression blocking the shift from the G0-G1 resting phase to the replicative S-G2-M phase, as observed in the Ki-67/7-AAD IC-FACS staining\nresults (Figure 3 G-H). LCA increased the frequencies of apoptotic cells and TLCA of improved the percentage of necrotic cells as determined by Annexin V/7-AAD staining (Figure 3 I-L).\nTo better characterize the molecular effect exerted by DCA and its derivatives as LIFR antagonists, we have evaluated the relative mRNA expression of several pro-oncogenic markers. As shown in Figure 4 A, whether the exposure of MKN45 to 10 ng/mL of LIF alone for 24 h increased the expression of the oncogene CMYC, the EMT marker Vimentin, and the anti-apoptotic BCL2, solely the treatment of LIF - exposed MKN45 with GDCA reduced the expression of CMYC and Vimentin. Similarly, the LIF-induced over-expression of BCL2 was reverted by the exposure to\nGDCA and 3-oxoDCA.\nSince LIF/LIFR modulates JAK and STAT3 phosphorylation 57, we have then investigated whether\nDCA and its derivatives could reverses the phosphorylation of STAT3, caused by LIF. Western blot assays, displayed in figure 4B, showed that all DCA family members reduced STAT3 phosphorylation in a statistically significant manner, confirming their role as suppressors of\nLIF/LIFR axis (Figure 4 B).\n31\nThe role of secondary bile acids in cancer initiation and progression has traditionally been considered ambiguous. While several studies reported their oncogenic potential in gastrointestinal cancer development, more recent research has supported their robust anti-tumor effect 58. In this\ncontext, we investigated whether DCA and its derivatives might exert an oncogenic effect. We demonstrated that the exposure of MKN45 to DCAs did not promote their growth and proliferation. Specifically, bile acids had no effect on CMYC gene expression. GDCA and 3-oxoDCA\ndownregulated the mRNA expression of Vimentin compared to untreated cells and the expression of BCL2 was reduced by GDCA (Figure 4 C). These findings indicated that bile acids did not activate the LIF/LIFR pathway and DCA and 3-oxoDCA reduced STAT3 phosphorylation (Figure 4 D).\nSimilar analyses were carried out to define the action of LCA family members as LIFR inhibitors. For this purpose, MKN45 were exposed to 10 ng/mL of LIF alone or in combination with LCA and\nits derivatives for 24 h. We found that LCA and 3-oxoLCA reduced the relative mRNA expression of CMYC. In addition, SNAIL-1 gene expression was reverted by LCA exposure, also LCA and 3- oxoLCA downregulated the mRNA expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 compared to LIFchallenged MKN45 (Figure 4 E).\nLCA and its derivatives reduced STAT3 activation induced by LIF (Figure 4 F).\nFurthermore, the treatment of MKN45 with LCA and its derivatives alone did not promote a prooncogenic effect. As shown in Figure 4 G, LCA reduced the expression of CMYC compared to untreated cells and the relative mRNA expression of BCL2 was diminished by LCA, TLCA and\nGLCA. In addition, LCA and its derivatives had no effect on STAT3 activation pathway (Figure 4"

            "text": "The results of these experiments were summarized in the heat map shown in Figure 4 I. The fifth column of the heat map shows that GDCA had the strongest effects on GC cell line proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis rate and STAT3 phosphorylation compared to the other bile acids\ntested.\n32\nBile acids content was increased in gastric neoplastic mucosa.\nSince these results demonstrate that secondary bile acids act as LIFR antagonists reversing the pro-\noncogenic effects of LIF in GC cell lines, we have investigated the tissue content of various bile acids in paired surgical samples obtained from seven GC individuals and compared them with paired samples of macroscopically normal mucosa. These patients were selected from a larger\ncohort of GC patients (2013-2022) based on the availability of clinical and histological data, as well as paired tissue samples from non-neoplastic and primary neoplastic tissues.\nThe results of these studies demonstrated that GC samples harboured a significantly higher concentration of total bile acids compared to the non-neoplastic pairs while as much as 27 bile acids were identified (Figure 5 A). Among the primary bile acids, concentrations of GCA and GCDCA were significantly higher in GC samples than non-neoplastic pairs (Figure 5 B), while the percentage of HCA was decreased. In contrast, as shown in Figure 5 C, the percentage of secondary bile acids GDCA and 3-oxoDCA was significantly reduced in GC samples compared to non-cancer\npairs (Figure 5 C). Together these data suggest that, while the total amount of bile acids increases in GC samples in comparison to non-cancer pair samples, the amount of GDCA and 3-oxoDCA, two LIFR antagonists, decreases, possibly indicating an inverse correlation among these bile acids species and LIFR expression. To clarify this question, we have then carried out a correlation analyses between the tissue contents of various bile acids and the tissue expression of LIFR (Log2), as derived from the transcriptome analysis described in a previous study (doi:\n10.17632/7j7vm89d96.1) from which our cohort of seven GC patients was derived. As depicted in Figure 6 A-C, GDCA correlates negatively with LIFR expression in non-neoplastic mucosa, but this correlation was lost in neoplastic mucosa, due to the reduction of GDCA content in the cancer\ntissues (Figure 6 A-C). Additionally, 3-oxoDCA exhibited a linear correlation with LIFR expression in non-neoplastic mucosa but displayed an inverse correlation with neoplastic mucosa, similar to LCA (Figure 6A-C). These findings indicate that in non-cancer mucosa, but not in cancer pairs, a\n33\nnegative correlation occurs between GDCA concentrations and LIFR expression.Since these changes might contribute to a dysregulated LIF/LIFR pathway and oncogenesis in GC, we have then examined whether GCA, a bile acid whose concentrations are increased in GC samples, and\nGDCA, a bile acid whose concentrations are reduced in GC samples in comparison with non-cancer pairs, exerted a divergent effect on expression of pro-oncogenic markers of MKN45 cells challenged with LIF. As shown in Figure 5 E, while exposure of cells to LIF increased the\nexpression of CMYC and SNAIL1, two oncogenetic markers, these effects were reversed by GDCA but not by GCA.\nTo further validate these findings, patient-derived organoids (hPDOs) from GC patients were\nemployed. Using these tissues, we were able to detect expression of LIFR on the cell membrane of hPDO (Figure 6D), as indicated by the intense red signal surrounding the DAPI-labelled nuclei.\nChallenging these hPDOs with 10 ng/mL LIF promoted a significant induction of the expression of the stem cell marker LGR5+ and Vimentin. These effects were reversed by GDCA (Figure 6E).\nSimilarly, while treating murine gastric organoids with LIF (10 ng/mL) alone or in\ncombination with GDCA (3 \u00b5M) for 1 week promoted the growth of gastric organoids that appeared as enlarged masses formed by multiple layers of different cell types, these effects were reversed by GDCA (Supplementary Figure 2 B, C).\nCollectively, these data demonstrate that bile acid species are differentially represented in cancer\nsamples in comparison to their non-cancer pairs in GC and GDCA might exert a regulatory role on LIF/ LIFR signalling in GC.\nSecondary bile acids reverse the proliferative effect of LIF in pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines\nFinally, we have investigated whether LIFR antagonism exerted by secondary bile acids in GC would extend to other cancers. Gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2 (pancreas), HepG2\n34\n(liver) and Caco-2 (colon) cells, were used. As shown in Figure 7A and B, the expression of LIF/LIFR was detected in all cell lines by PCR analysis. While exposure to LIF promoted cells proliferation as assessed by MTS assay in all three cell lines, this pattern was reversed by TLCA,\nGLCA, 3-oxoLCA and TDCA (pancreas, liver and colon cancer). Also GDCA and 3-oxoDCA effectively reversed the LIF effects on liver and colon cancer cells, but were found less effective on MIAPaCa-2 cells (Figure 7C-E). Together these findings suggest that secondary bile acids function\nas LIFR antagonists and their tissue content correlates with LIFR expression in GC and their potential for LIFR antagonism might have relevance in regulating the oncogenic potential of this cytokine in pancreatic hepatic and colon cancers.\n35"

            "text": "Here we report that secondary bile acids, DCA and LCA, the metabolic products of the\nintestinal microbiota, act as endogenous LIFR antagonists and that a decreased content of GDCA in GC associates with LIF/LIFR activation. These results expand the repertoire of signaling molecules generated by the intestinal microbiota and on their role in maintaining human health.\nPrevious studies have shown that bile acids function as endogenous ligands for cell\nmembrane and nuclear receptors. Primary bile acids are the natural ligands of FXR18,59,60, the main bile acid sensor, while secondary bile acids act as non- exclusive ligands of PXR34, VDR35 and LXRs37 and ROR\u03b3t38. For all these receptors, bile acids act as direct agonists, including ROR\u03b3t, a nuclear receptor expressed in Th17 cells61. In the latter case, 3-oxoLCA and iso-alloLCA function as inverse agonists leading to ROR\u03b3t-dependent inhibition of Th17 signaling at the intestinal microbiota/intestinal barrier interface62. Since intestinal inflammation associates with intestinal dysbiosis and reduced generation of ROR\u03b3t agonists63, these studies established a role for\nmicrobial-derived bile acids in regulating host immune response by tuning the balance of Th17 and T regulatory cells38,62. In addition to nuclear receptors, secondary bile acids are the endogenous agonists of GPBAR120 , a membrane receptor that is also activated by primary bile acids though at significant higher concentrations20. Secondary bile acids might also activate the M2/M3 muscarinic receptors in certain cancers64, indicating that bile acids might function as endogenous ligands for both G-protein coupled and nuclear receptors 65.\nWe have now extended on this background by showing that bile acids function as LIFR\nantagonists. Our introductive screening of primary and secondary bile acids by Alfa Screen analysis\ndemonstrated that LIFR antagonism waspreferentially restricted to secondary bile acids.A detailed analysis of concentrations response curve using human cells transfected whose construct has been made up by LIFR cloned upstream to a STAT3 reporter genes, confirmed that DCA and LCA and\ntheir T and G conjugates, along with their 3-oxo derivates, effectively prevent STAT3\n36\nphosphorylation induced by LIF. Inhibition of LIF/LIFR interaction and STAT3 phosphorylation occurs in the low micromolar concentrations, that is compatible with activation of GPBAR1 by secondary bile acids. Previous studies, by this laboratory and others, 20,66,67 have demonstrated that\nactivation of GPBAR1 by LCA and DCA occurs at EC50 values of 0.9-2.0 \u00b5M, while activation of FXR requires significantly higher concentrations (\u224810-20 \u00b5M). Together, these data establish that secondary bile acids function as LIFR antagonists in the same range of concentrations required for\nthe activation of GPBAR1. As such, DCA and LCA and their derivatives should be considered bona fide as dual GPBAR1 agonists and LIFR antagonists in tissues co-expressing both receptors.\nThrough Molecular Dynamics simulations, we have shown that both LCAs and DCAs enter\na pocket located in the Ig-like domain D3 of the extracellular portion of LIFR. This pocket is generated by L2 and L3 loops, which are part of the LIF binding domain of LIFR and it is predicted\nthat its occupation would impact on the ability of LIF to bind to its receptor. These computational studies were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies showing that GDCA, reversed the formation of LIFR/gp13o complex induced by LIF. Together these studies strongly support the notion that occupation of the pocket formed at L2 /L3 loops prevents activation of LIFR by LIF leading to the release of LFR/gp130 complex.\nThe functional characterization of DCAs and LCAs on gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and gastric organoids has further confirmed that these bile acid species counteract the pro-oncogenic effects of LIF in same order of magnitude shown by cell free and transactivation assays. Thus, while DCA per\nse did not fully reverse the LIF proliferative effects, TDCA, GDCA and 3-oxoDCA fully reversed the LIF-induced prooncogenic effects in various cancer cells lines46. Moreover, the exposure to DCA and its derivatives reversed the effect of LIF on cell cycle progression and cell survival in GC\ncell lines. Similarly, LCA and its derivatives reversed the pro-oncogenic effects of LIF as shown by measuring the cell cycle transition and the rate of apoptotic cells (Annexin V + cells). Additionally, some of the DCAs and LCAs blunted the expression of pro-oncogenic genes, including CMYC and\n37\nBCL2 and robustly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation caused by LIF indicating that, among bile acids, GDCA antagonizes the pro-oncogenic activities of LIF in cancer cell lines.\nBecause these in vitro data suggested that intratumor content of bile acids might modulate\nthe LIF/LIFR signalling at the epithelial cells/ECM interface, we have then characterized the bile acids content and composition in paired samples of non-neoplastic and neoplastic stomach from GC\npatients. The results of these studies demonstrated that the intra-tumour content of bile acids was significantly higher than in paired biopsies obtained from non-cancer areas. In comparison with their non-neoplastic counterparts, cancer biopsies were characterized by a significantly higher\ncontent of CA while tumour content of GCDCA, GDCA, GHDCA and 3-oxoDCA was reduced. Furthermore, analysis of LIFR expression in neoplastic and non-neoplastic samples demonstrated a negative correlation between the tissue content of GDCA and LIFR in non-neoplastic tissues, but\nthis regulation was lost in the cancer samples due to the reduction of intra-tumour content of GDCA. The inverse correlation of LIFR expression and GDCA in normal and cancer tissues provides a strong support to translational relevance of this mechanism in GC.\nIn the neoplastic tissues, however, we have identified a negative correlation between the expression of LIFR and HDCA, LCA and 3-oxoDCA. Although the tissues expression gives no direct information on the status of LIF/LIFR signalling, it is noteworthy that the tissue content of LIFR antagonists (LCA and 3-oxoDCA) was negatively correlated with the expression of the receptor in GC samples. Because the tissue expression of LIF/LIFR associates with development of peritoneal metastasis44 and predicts worse prognosis in GC patients68, these human data highlight the therapeutic potential of DCAs and LCAs in regulating the LIF/LIFR system in clinical settings. Further confirming the translational relevance of our findings, we have shown that GDCA, the only\nbile acid that is reduced in GC samples, reversed the induction of the expression of GC stemness markers, LGR5, and the expression of EMT marker induced by LIF in patient-derived 31,69,70. The same regulatory effect of GDCA on LIF/LIFR pathway was confirmed in murine gastric organoids\n38\nexposed to LIF. Finally, we have shown that LIFR antagonism by LCAs and DCAs is not restricted to GC but could be demonstrated in other gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, including pancreatic46,71, liver and colon cancer cells5, thereby establishing that secondary bile acids are LIFR antagonists\nand that these effects are maintained across various cancer types in enterohepatic tissues.\nThe reason why cancer tissues harbour higher bile acids contents in comparison to non-neoplastic\ntissues was not investigated in this study. Several mechanisms might be involved. Indeed, all GCs included in this study were of the intestinal subtype, according to Lauren\u2019s classification72,73. This specific histologic subtype is thought to progress from gastric intestinal metaplasia frequently associated to the H. Pylori infection70,74. As, in contrast to gastric epithelial cells, the intestinal epithelial cells import bile acids75, this might explain the higher content of various bile acids in the cancer tissues, although other explanations, including a specific microbiota composition, should be considered 76.\nIn summary, through Alpha Screen assays, molecular modelling, and pharmacological\ncharacterization, we have demonstrated that LCAs and DCAs function as endogenous LIFR antagonists in the same range of concentrations required for activation of GPBAR1. Combining data of LIFR expression and analysis of intra-tumour bile concentrations, we have identified GDCA as a putative negative regulator of LIFR expression and activity in GC patients. These findings expand our understanding of the intricate interplay between bile acids, regulatory cytokines, and cancers in the gastrointestinal tract."
