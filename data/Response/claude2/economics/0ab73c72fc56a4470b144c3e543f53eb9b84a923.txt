 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Conduct qualitative research through interviews or focus groups to understand the specific barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination uptake in different socioeconomic groups within a country. This could provide insights to inform targeted interventions. 

2. Examine the impact of COVID-19 vaccination policies and public health messaging on vaccination uptake across socioeconomic groups. For example, study how vaccination requirements or incentives affect different populations.

3. Investigate strategies to improve global collaboration and coordination in vaccine distribution and access. Research equitable pricing models, technology transfers, and policies to balance local needs with global supply. 

4. Develop mathematical models to forecast COVID-19 vaccination coverage over time under different policy scenarios. Simulate the impact on infection rates, healthcare burden, and emergence of new variants.

5. Conduct intervention studies to test the effectiveness of community-based participatory approaches in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among disadvantaged populations. Evaluate culturally-tailored messaging and outreach.
