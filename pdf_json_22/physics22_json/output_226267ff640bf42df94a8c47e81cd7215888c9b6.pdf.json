Shearrow,1\nA. Ballard,3 V. Iaia,3 J. Ku,3 B. L. T. Plourde,3 and R. McDermott1, \u2217\n1Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA 2Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program, Department of Physics,\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA 3Department of Physics, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244, USA\n(Dated: March 15, 2022)\nThe ideal superconductor provides a pristine environment for the delicate states of a quantum computer: because there is an energy gap to excitations, there are no spurious modes with which the qubits can interact, causing irreversible decay of the quantum state. As a practical matter, however, there exists a high density of excitations out of the superconducting ground state even at ultralow temperature; these are known as quasiparticles. Observed quasiparticle densities are of order 1 \u00b5m\u22123, tens of orders of magnitude larger than the equilibrium density expected from theory. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles extract energy from the qubit mode and induce discrete changes in qubit offset charge, a potential source of dephasing. Here we show that a dominant mechanism for quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting qubits is direct absorption of high-energy photons at the qubit junction. We use a Josephson junction-based photon source to controllably dose qubit circuits with millimeter-wave radiation, and we use an interferometric quantum gate sequence to reconstruct the charge parity on the qubit island. We find that the structure of the qubit itself acts as a resonant antenna for millimeter-wave radiation, providing an efficient path for photons to generate quasiparticle excitations. A deep understanding of this physics will pave the way to realization of next-generation superconducting qubits that are robust against quasiparticle poisoning and could enable a new class of quantum sensors for dark matter detection.\nIn equilibrium, the ratio of thermally generated quasiparticles to Cooper pairs in a superconducting device is of order 10\u221250 at the millikelvin temperatures that are relevant for quantum computing and sensing applications. This is due to the exponential suppression of quasiparticle density with respect to \u2206/T , where \u2206 is the superconducting gap energy and T is temperature [1, 2]. Experimentally, however, this ratio is found to be between \u223c 10\u22126 and 10\u221210 [3\u20138], more than 40 orders of magnitude larger than expected from the equilibrium calculation. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles limit the sensitivity of superconducting devices for charge sensing [3, 9], metrology [10], and astrophysical observation [11, 12]. In the context of superconducting qubits, nonequilibrium quasiparticles represent a significant decoherence channel [1, 5\u20138, 13]. Recent experiments have demonstrated that quasiparticles liberated by particle impacts in the qubit substrate give rise to correlated relaxation errors in multiqubit arrays [14\u201316]. While such errors are especially damaging for quantum error correction, the particle impact rate is too low and the rate of removal of pairbreaking energy in the aftermath of an impact too high to account for the large baseline density of quasiparticles in superconducting quantum circuits.\nAnother potential source of quasiparticles is the absorption of pair-breaking photons. It has been shown that improvements in filtering and shielding can lead to enhanced energy relaxation times for superconducting resonators [17] and qubits [18]. Recently, Houzet et al. explained the observed ratio of parity switches to\nstate transitions in a transmon qubit in terms of photonassisted pair breaking at the Josephson junction [19]; however, this work did not address the concrete physical mechanism by which the photon couples to the qubit junction. We recently put forth a model for the resonant absorption of pair-breaking photons by spurious antenna modes of the qubit [20]. The crucial insight is that the qubit structure itself exhibits a parasitic resonance at a frequency of order 100 GHz, set by the round-trip distance around the qubit island. This resonance is the aperture dual of the resonant wire loop antenna [21]. For typical qubit parameters, the qubit junction is well matched to free space impedance via this antenna mode, so that the qubit is an efficient absorber of pair-breaking radiation. Fig. 1a summarizes relevant quasiparticle generation and conversion mechanisms in superconducting qubits, while Fig. 1b depicts the dual mapping of aperture antenna to wire antenna.\nIn this article, we describe the experimental validation of our model for the antenna coupling of qubits to pairbreaking radiation. The experiments involve two separate chips that are housed in a single enclosure; one chip incorporates voltage-biased Josephson junctions that act as transmitters of coherent mm-wave photons, while the second chip supports multiple superconducting qubits that act as receivers. We use a Ramsey-based interferometric gate sequence to monitor the charge-parity state of the qubits [22]; resonant absorption of pair-breaking photons induces parity switches on the qubit which we detect with near unit fidelity. By scanning the volt-\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n06 57\n7v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 3\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2\nage bias of the transmitter junction, we map out the spectral response of the qubits up to \u223c500 GHz. We find that the detailed absorption spectrum of the qubits agrees well with the predictions of our model. In addition, we find that the baseline quasiparticle poisoning rate (in the absence of mm-wave injection) can be explained in terms of the resonant absorption of blackbody photons from higher temperature stages of the cryostat. Finally, we show that spurious transitions of the qubit out of the ground state are dominated by the resonant absorption of pair-breaking photons. This detailed understanding of the physical mechanism for quasiparticle poisoning will allow realization of new qubit designs that are robust against pair-breaking radiation; additionally, it could form the basis for a new class of quantum sensors based on the transduction of photons to quasiparticles followed by subsequent qubit-based detection. We note that a recent experimental study explains the scaling of quasiparticle poisoning rate with qubit size in terms of our model, without direct validation of the detailed spectral response of the qubit devices [23].\nThe experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1c. Two separate device chips are integrated in a single light-tight enclosure made from 6061 aluminum: the transmitter chip (red) is mounted face to face with the receiver chip (blue) with a separation of 9.6 mm. For all devices described here, the chip is nearly completely covered by a niobium groundplane, and all Josephson elements are realized as Al-AlOx-Al tunnel junctions. We use a highbandwidth 50 \u2126 line to bias the transmitter junction in the finite-voltage state; since the normal-state resistance of the junction is of order 10 k\u2126, the bias line\nrepresents a stiff voltage source. Bias of the transmitter junction at voltage V induces coherent oscillations in the phase difference across the junction at the Josephson frequency fJ = V/\u03a60, where \u03a60 \u2261 h/2e is the magnetic flux quantum; for a 1 mV bias, the Josephson frequency is 484 GHz. A circuit diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1d. The voltage-biased junction can be modeled as a Norton equivalent current source I0 in parallel with shunt admittance Yj \u2261 1/Zj = 1/Rn + j\u03c9Cj, where I0 is the junction critical current, Rn is the junction normalstate resistance, and Cj is the self-capacitance of the junction. The Josephson oscillator acts as a source that drives the antenna formed by the junction pads embedded in the circuit groundplane, with radiation impedance Zrad. Following the analysis of [20], the power radiated to free space is given by\nPrad = ec,tr\n8 I20Rn, (1)\nwhere I0 and Rn are the transmitter junction critical current and normal-state resistance, respectively, and where the coupling efficiency ec,tr of the junction to free space is given by\nec,tr = 1\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Zrad \u2212 Z\u2217jZrad + Zj \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 . (2) Power emitted into the shared cavity will populate the enclosure with coherent mm-wave radiation; due to multiple reflections from the enclosure walls, we expect the distribution of energy in the enclosure to be isotropic with random polarization (see Supplement for additional details).\n3\nWe now consider the effect of the radiation on the transmon qubits of the receiver chip. The devices were designed with ratio EJ/Ec of Josephson energy to singleelectron charging energy around 25, so that the qubit 01 transition frequency is weakly sensitive to offset charge on the qubit island, with peak-to-peak charge dispersion 2\u03b4f of order 1 MHz. This makes it possible to monitor quasiparticle poisoning events in real time by using a Ramsey gate sequence that maps charge parity to qubit state occupation (see Supplement). As acoustic coupling between the transmitter and receiver chips is negligible, the transfer of energy from chip to chip proceeds via the emission and absorption of photons. Photons with frequency f > 2\u2206Al/h = 92 GHz couple to the Josephson junction of the receiver qubit with efficiency ec,rec defined as in Eq. 2. Photon absorption breaks a Cooper pair: two quasiparticles are generated, one on either side of the junction, resulting in a change in the charge parity of the qubit island.\nIn a first series of experiments, we employ two nominally identical chips as transmitter and receiver. Witness junctions arrayed around the perimeter of the chip are used as mm-wave transmitters; the geometry is shown in Fig. 2a. One pad of the transmitter is connected to the chip groundplane via a short wirebond, while the opposite pad is bonded to the 50 \u2126 bias line [24]. The chip incorporates six Xmon qubits, each with a local readout resonator coupled to a common feedline; the qubit geometry is shown in Fig. 2b. As we vary the voltage bias on the transmitter junction and thus the frequency of the emitted Josephson radiation, we use the paritysensitive Ramsey sequence to probe the charge parity of the receiver qubit at a sampling rate of 20 kHz. In the following, we present data on a single transmitter/receiver pair, although all three of the receiver qubits studied on this chip displayed a similar spectral response (see Supplement). All experiments were conducted at the 16 mK base temperature of a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator.\n4 In Fig. 2c, we show the calculated coupling efficiencies ec for the transmitter (red) and receiver (blue) structures; here we assume a junction specific capacitance of 75 fF/\u00b5m2 for both chips. The purple trace, obtained as the product of the transmitter and receiver efficiencies, represents the frequency-dependent transfer function of the two-chip experiment in the absence of loss and additional nonidealities. In Fig. 2d, we plot the measured parity rate \u0393p of the receiver qubit versus transmitter Josephson frequency (black points). We observe clear peaks in the spectral response of the receiver qubit at 190 GHz and 270 GHz, with \u0393p a factor of 2 and 6 times larger than the baseline rate of 110 s\u22121, respectively. We ascribe these features to antenna resonances in our Josephson transmitter and receiver qubit, which provide enhanced transfer of Josephson energy between the two chips. The solid purple trace represents the expected parity rate calculated from the device coupling efficiencies. Detailed modeling of the two-chip experiment incorporates several effects, including quasiparticle-induced suppression of the critical current of the transmitter junction and randomization of the direction and polarization of the emitted radiation due to multiple reflections from the walls of the cavity enclosure; for a detailed discussion, see Supplement. The model clearly captures the dominant resonant features of the parity spectrum; however, to obtain good agreement between the measured and expected parity rates, we must scale the expected rates by a factor of 0.07. The discrepancy in the absolute rates could\nbe due to dielectric losses or to enhanced loss of photons that are initially emitted into the silicon substrate of the transmitter, as the near-continuous superconducting Nb groundplane of the transmitter chip will act as a barrier to transport of photons into the shared space of the two-chip enclosure.\nIn the inset of Fig. 2d, we plot on an expanded scale the measured and calculated parity rates. We observe clear fine structure in both the measured and calculated spectra, with a modulation of the receiver response at a period of 11 GHz. We understand this modulation to be due to the mutual coupling between the receiver qubit and its local readout resonator, which involves a spurious \u03bb/2 slotline mode at a frequency that is roughly twice that of the \u03bb/4 coplanar waveguide resonance at 6.058 GHz. We take the excellent agreement between the measured and calculated fine structure of the parity spectra as clear validation of our antenna model for coupling of the qubit to pair-breaking radiation.\nFor transmitter bias above 1 mV, corresponding to Josephson frequency above 500 GHz, we observe an upturn in the measured parity rate that is not captured by our modeling. We ascribe this feature to the exchange of energy between the chips due to the incoherent emission of photons from the recombination of quasiparticles in the leads of the transmitter junction; detailed modeling of this physics is the subject of ongoing work.\nFIG. 3. Dependence of resonant response and baseline parity rate on device scale. a, Optical micrographs of the rectangular transmitter device (green) and the large (red), intermediate (black), and small (blue) circmon qubits used for these experiments. Yellow traces indicate the junction leads. b, Calculated coupling efficiencies of the transmitter and the three circmon receiver qubits. c, Measured quasiparticle poisoning rates for the three qubits of as a function of transmitter frequency. Dashed lines indicate the baseline parity rates measured in the absence of photon injection.\nTwo additional qubits on the receiver chip were examined during the same cooldown (see Supplement). Both of these devices displayed baseline parity rates and spectral responses within 10% of those measured on the device described here, despite different separation and relative orientation with respect to the transmitter junction. This observation lends support to our assumption that the experiment can be modeled in terms of an isotropic distribution of radiation in the shared cavity with random polarization.\nIn a second series of experiments, we examined the resonant response of receiver qubits with circular island geometry spanning a range of sizes; the geometries of the transmitter junction and the three receiver qubits (Q1, Q2, and Q3) are shown in Fig. 3a. The devices are designed with the same nominal charging energy\n5 Ec/h = 360 MHz and ratio EJ/Ec = 28; however, the different island radii 90, 70, and 50 \u00b5m yield different dominant dipole antenna resonances at frequencies 130, 240, and 360 GHz, as confirmed by numerical modeling of the chip (Fig. 3b).\nWith the Josephson radiator turned off, we first measure the baseline parity rates on the three devices (dashed lines in Fig. 3c), finding \u03930(Q1) = 1060 s\n\u22121, \u03930(Q2) = 190 s\u22121, and \u03930(Q3) = 12.8 s\n\u22121. The two orders of magnitude discrepancy in the baseline parity rates across these devices indicates clearly that nonequilibrium quasiparticles are not uniformly distributed on the receiver chip, and that device geometry plays a critical role in the generation of quasiparticles. If we take the radiative environment of the qubit to be a blackbody at effective temperature T and assume coupling of the qubit antenna to a single mode and polarization of the radiation field, we find a rate of absorption of pair-breaking photons given by\n\u03930 =\n\u222b ec\nehf/kBT \u2212 1 df. (3)\nFrom the measured parity rates on the three devices, we infer effective blackbody temperatures T (Q1) = 410 mK, T (Q2) = 490 mK, and T (Q3) = 460 mK. We believe that the broadband pair-breaking photons giving rise to the observed parity jumps are not due to a single radiator at a physical temperature of 400-500 mK, but rather due to light leakage from higher temperature stages of the refrigerator (most likely via the coaxial wiring) that is insufficiently attenuated by the in-line Eccosorb filters. There is no reason to expect the spectrum of leakage radiation to follow that of an ideal blackbody; the discrepancy in the effective temperatures inferred for the three qubit antenna modes could reflect structure in the environmental spectrum.\nWith the transmitter junction biased in the voltage state, we map out the resonant response of these three devices using the parity spectroscopy technique described above; the data are shown in Fig. 3c. The complex resonant structure of the transmitter mode leads to rich structure in the resonant response of the three qubits; however, the measured parity rates are in qualitative agreement with our antenna model, with the resonant response shifting to higher frequency as the radius of the qubit island decreases.\nFinally, using Q2 as a testbed, we examine spurious transitions out of the qubit |0\u3009 state induced by the absorption of pair-breaking photons. We measure the transition rate directly, using a measure\u2212 idle\u2212measure sequence (inset in Fig. 4a), with the pre-measurement providing a high-fidelity initialization in the qubit |0\u3009 state. In Fig. 4a we show representative data for the conditional probability P1 \u2261 P (1|0) of finding the qubit in state |1\u3009 in the second measurement given that the initial measurement prepared state |0\u3009. A linear fit to the plot of\nFIG. 4. Photon-assisted parity switches and qubit transitions. a, Representative measurement of qubit excitation rate. Here we use circmon qubit Q2 as a testbed. Inset shows the measure\u2212 idle\u2212measure sequence. A linear fit (black line) is used to extract the upward transition rate. b, Measured quasiparticle poisoning rate (red) and upward transition rate (blue solid trace) as a function of transmitter frequency. The dashed curve shows the predicted photonassisted qubit transition rate calculated from the measured rate of parity switches, after [19]. See Supplement for the details of the transmitter used in these experiments.\nP1 versus idle time \u2206t yields the upward transition rate \u0393\u2191. In Fig. 4b, the solid traces show the measured parity rate \u0393p and upward transition rate \u0393\u2191 versus Josephson frequency of the transmitter junction. We see that \u0393p and \u0393\u2191 display a similar resonant response centered at a Josephson frequency around 240 GHz, where the transfer function from transmitter to receiver device is expected to peak. Moreover, the ratio \u0393p/\u0393\u2191 is roughly constant over the full frequency range, indicating that qubit transitions out of the ground state are dominated by resonant absorption of pair-breaking photons. Houzet et al. have previously analyzed the rate of qubit transitions conditioned on the absorption of a pair-breaking photon [19]. Their analysis predicts a contribution to \u0393\u2191 given by the dashed blue trace in Fig. 4b (see Supplement). However, the absorption of a pair-breaking photon will also generate a steady-state population of nonequilibrium quasiparticles that can tunnel across the qubit junction, inducing additional qubit transitions following the primary poi-\n6 soning event. It is likely that this secondary poisoning process accounts for the enhanced rate of upward transitions measured here.\nIn summary, we have used controlled irradiation of superconducting qubits with mm-wave photons derived from the ac Josephson effect to validate a model for photon-assisted quasiparticle poisoning through the spurious antenna modes of the transmon qubit. The observed baseline parity rates are well explained by absorption of broadband thermal photons from higher temperature stages of the cryostat. Additionally, the correlation between qubit state transitions and charge parity switches indicates that resonant absorption of pairbreaking photons is the dominant contributor to qubit initialization errors.\nAn understanding of the physical origin of quasiparticle poisoning will allow the development of improved qubit designs and measurement configurations that protect against absorption of pair-breaking radiation. At the same time, the resonant transduction of pair-breaking photons to quasiparticles followed by qubit-based parity detection could form the basis for a new class of quantum sensors; potential applications include highresolution spectroscopy of the cosmic microwave background [25] or detection of dark-matter axions [26, 27] or dark energy [28] in the frequency range from 100 GHz to 1 THz, where established detection techniques are limited.\nWork at UW-Madison is supported by the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, managed and operated by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract No. DEAC02-07CH11359 with the U.S. Department of Energy, through the Office of High Energy Physics QuantISED program.

            "text": "To calculate the rate of absorption of pair-breaking photons by the qubit, we need to know the circulating power in the shared aluminum enclosure of the transmit/receive experiment for a given applied bias (see Fig. 1c). To perform a naive estimate, we consider the case where absorption of Josephson radiation in the aluminum walls of the shared enclosure is the dominant source of photon loss. The circulating power can then be obtained from a simple power balance: the power radiated by the transmitter (Eq. S4 above) must equal the power absorbed by the aluminum. We assume that photons from the transmitter will reflect many times within the enclosure prior to absorption and that these reflections randomize the direction and polarization of the Josephson radiation, creating an isotropic distribution of radiation with random polarization. The fact that the measured quasiparticle poisoning rate does not depend on separation and relative orientation of the transmitter and receiver devices lends support to this assumption (see Fig. S4).\nThe power Penc absorbed by the aluminum enclosure is given by\nPenc = \u03c0\u03b7SAenc, (S7)\nwhere \u03b7 = 1 \u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223ZAl\u2212ZfsZAl+Zfs \u2223\u2223\u22232 is the efficiency with which photons are absorbed by the aluminum enclosure, S is the incident power per unit solid angle per unit area, and Aenc is the inner area of the enclosure (the factor \u03c0 comes from integrating the cosine of the polar angle over the half-space).

We find that the measured rates at 190 GHz (270 GHz) are a factor 10 (20) smaller than those expected from our naive calculation. This discrepancy could be due to additional photon losses in the materials of the enclosure, including Rogers PC board launchers, or to trapping of photons in the shallow cavity beneath the transmitter chip due to near-continuous coverage of the device layer by its Nb groundplane.\n12\nfJ \u0393J, theo \u0393J, meas \u0393J, meas/\u0393J, theo 190 GHz 1020 s\u22121 103 s\u22121 0.10 270 GHz 11400 s\u22121 528 s\u22121 0.05\nTABLE S3. Transmit/receive experiment: comparison between naive model and measurement.\nFIG. S4. Spectral response of three Xmon qubits. Three qubits of similar design at different positions are measured in the same cooldown. They share the same transmitter (Fig. 2a). Extracted parity rates show similar response to the transmitter. Inset shows the positions of the three qubits on the receicer chip. The yellow star shows the relative location of the transmitting antenna on the other chip. The two chips are positioned face to face with 9.6 mm chip to chip spacing shown as in Fig. 1c.\nExtended Xmon Dataset\nWe measured the rate of parity switches induced by Josephson radiation from a single transmitter junction for three different Xmon devices on the same receiver chip. The receiver chip geometry is shown in the inset of Fig. S4a. The receiver and transmitter chips are mounted face to face with a separation of 9.6 mm; in this inset, the position of the transmitter junction (as seen looking through the chips) is indicated by a yellow star. The three Xmons share similar island geometry and junction parameters (see Table S1 for details; one of the qubits has a slightly smaller island corresponding to a slightly higher fundamental antenna resonance frequency). In Fig. S4a, we plot the parity rates measured for these three devices as a function of Josephson frequency of the transmitter. We observe similar resonant structure in all devices, despite different separation and relative orientation with respect to the transmitter. This observation lends support to the assumption that multiple reflections in the shared aluminum enclosure will randomize the direction and polarization of the Josephson radiation.\nIn a separate experiment, we measure the equilibrium |1\u3009 state occupation of Xmon Q2 as a function of transmitter frequency. Here we use a more strongly coupled transmitter with the same geometry as that shown in\nFIG. S5. Dependence of |1\u3009 occupation on transmitter frequency. Occupation of the qubit |1\u3009 state is enhanced due to resonant absorption of pair-breaking photons. The peak at 270 GHz coincides with the peak in photon transfer efficiency from the transmitter junction to the Xmon qubit.\nFig. 2a, but with different junction parameters corresponding to a factor 7.9 higher critical current and a factor 1.6 greater coupling efficiency at 270 GHz. In Fig. S5, we plot P1 versus transmitter frequency. While this measurement is far less sensitive than the Ramsey-based parity experiment, we see that the excess |1\u3009 state occupation displays similar resonant structure due to qubit transitions induced by absorption of pair-breaking photons."

Here we take EJ/Ec = 28, as relevant for circmon device Q2 studied in Fig. 4 of the main text. For high photon energy, we see that this ratio saturates to 6%. However, the measured ratio of upward transitions to parity switches is 20%. The enhanced rate of spurious transitions out of the |0\u3009 state can be explained in terms of additional qubit transitions induced by diffusion of quasiparticles across the qubit junction following the primary poisoning event."
