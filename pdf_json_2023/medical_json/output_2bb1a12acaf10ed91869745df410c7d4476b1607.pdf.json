It is characterised\nby abrupt onset with inflammation, radiographic features of central erosions and collapse of the subchondral bone, and rapid progression. Markers of inflammation and bone resorption are higher in EHOA patients than in other forms of hand OA. This can make it challenging to differentiate clinically from erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and erosive gout in the small joints of the hand, two disease entities that have specific effective therapies on the market, while no disease- modifying drugs are yet available for EHOA. Between 5% and 20% of patients with symptomatic hand OA have EHOA which, as other OA types, predominantly affects females (reviewed in ref 3).3\nAlthough EHOA is phenotypically different from nodal hand OA in the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints, it is not clear if EHOA represents a genetically distinct form of hand OA. Several studies have identified a genetic or familial component to EHOA4 5 and a few candidate genes and loci, such as HLA alleles and the IL1B gene, have been suggested.6\u20138\nThere is, however, no genome- wide association study (GWAS) of EHOA that has been reported, but ten loci have been described for hand/finger/thumb\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC No genetic associations have been reported for erosive hand osteoarthritis (EHOA).\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This study finds the first genetic association with EHOA at four loci that all confer relatively high risk of the disease, identifies candidate causal genes at three loci: ALDH1A2, MGP and BMP6, and strong candidates at one locus: SPP1, IBSP and MEPE.\nHOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This study highlights EHOA as somewhat separate from osteoarthritis in the larger joints and points to potential drug targets for the disease.\nP atna).

None of the earlier studies separated EHOA from finger or hand OA, that is, EHOA patients were included in these analyses.\nHere, based on five independent EHOA study populations, we identified four genetic loci that associate with EHOA. Two of these loci were previously associated with hand OA overall, at ALDH1A2 and MGP. We also discovered two new loci with candidate causal genes involved in bone biology, BMP6 and SPP1/MEPE/IBSP. Our data indicate that EHOA has substantial genetic overlap with finger OA, yet displays risk alleles that are associated with susceptibility of EHOA over that of finger or hand OA and of OA in other joints."

Rs11243284 at 6p24.3 is not correlated with the recently identified association of rs12190551 with spine OA (r2=0.002).27\nRs1800801 in the 5\u2019 UTR in MGP associated stronger with EHOA under a recessive model (OR=1.85 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.14), p=3.7 \u00d7 10\u221216), than under an additive/multiplicative model (OR=1.37 (1.26, 1.49), p=3.6 \u00d7 10\u221213) (online supplemental table S2). In the full genotype model, which assesses risk of heterozygous and homozygous genotypes compared with the homozygous wild- type, the OR for the heterozygotes (TC) was smaller than expected for the additive model, ORhet=1.15 (1.00, 1.32), p=0.047, while the OR for the homozygotes (TT) was larger, ORhom=2.01 (1.71, 2.37), p=1.1 \u00d7 10\n\u221216. The full model fits significantly better than the additive model for rs1800801 (p=0.0011) (online supplemental table S2), demonstrating the recessive nature of this association. As opposed to the association of rs1800801 with EHOA, the association of rs1800801 with hand, finger and thumb OA was consistent with the additive model rather than the recessive model (online supplemental table S3).\nFor the other three EHOA- associated variants, we did not observe deviation from the additive/multiplicative model for the genotype risk (online supplemental table S2).\nFunctional annotation of the EHOA-associated variants We annotated the EHOA variants according to location in ENCODE\u2019s encyclopaedia of cCRE,22 their tissue specificity,23 co- localisation with mRNA expression (eQTL) in various tissues and co- localisation with protein expression (pQTL) in plasma.

Ann Rheum Dis 2023;0:1\u20138. doi:10.1136/ard-2022-223468\nThe EHOA- associated variants (the lead variant or highly correlated variants, r2>0.8) at all four loci reside in enhancerlike sequences (online supplemental table S4), and the variants at MGP and ALDH1A2 also overlap with promoter- like sequences, suggesting a regulatory role of these variants in expression of nearby genes. The 12p12.3 (MGP), 15q21.3 (ALDH1A2) and 4q22.1 (SPP1/MEPE) signals are in cCREs found in many different tissues, whereas the 6p24.3 signal is restricted to few tissue types (online supplemental table S5), possibly suggesting tissue specific activity. Consistent with this observation we found co- localisation of the EHOA variants and/or mRNA expression or protein levels in plasma, at three of the loci: SPP1 at 4q22.1, MGP at 12p12.3 and ALDH1A2 at 15q21.3 (online supplemental table S6 and S7). MGP and ALDH1A2 are also predicted target genes in the EpiMap resource28 (online supplemental table S8). Furthermore, all of the four EHOA loci are within tissuespecific regulatory regions for vascular/endothelial cells which we estimate is 2.8- fold higher than expected by chance alone (expected overlap=35%; 95% CI 0% to 75%), but, as we tested for enrichment within 16 different tissue- specific groups,23 the enrichment was only nominally significant (p=0.011, online supplemental table S9).\nThe EHOA risk allele of rs11631127 co- localised with reduced expression of ALDH1A2 in cultured fibroblasts (online supplemental table S6), consistent with previous results in cartilage and other joint tissues,9 29 and rs1800801[T] in MGP co- localised with both reduced MGP eQTL (online supplemental table S6) in several tissues and with reduced matrix Gla protein (encoded by the MGP gene) pQTL in plasma (online supplemental table S7), also consistent with previous results.10 12 28 30 Since the MGP gene is expressed at a very low level in blood cells the protein in plasma primarily comes from other tissues. Furthermore, in our data, an increased plasma level of matrix Gla protein associated with lower odds of EHOA (OR=0.75 per SD, p=0.028, Nerosive=55, Ncontrols=27 083, online supplemental figure S2).\nRs17013495[T] at the 4q22.1 locus co- localised with reduced mRNA expression of the SPP1 gene in spleen (online supplemental table S6), and associated with decreased level of osteopontin (encoded by the SPP1 gene) in plasma (online supplemental table S7), although not the strongest cis- pQTL for this protein in plasma. Increased levels of bone sialoprotein 2, encoded by the IBSP gene at the 4q22.1 locus, associated with reduced odds of EOHA (OR=0.74 per SD, p=0.023, online supplemental figure S2), although pQTL or eQTL for this gene did not co- localise with the EHOA variants. However, we note that expression of the IBSP gene is mostly restricted to bone and cartilage, tissues without public eQTL/pQTL datasets.\nWe did not detect eQTLs or pQTLs at the 6p24.3 locus. However, of the nine genes within 1.5 MB of rs11243284, BMP6 is the most likely candidate gene because of the known role of the BMP signalling pathway in skeletal formation and homeostasis.31\u201333 To uncover biological functions of BMP6 in vivo, we examined the consequences of complete loss of bmp6 function in the zebrafish. We used CRISPR- Cas9 methods to generate F0 and germline deletions of bmp6 (online supplemental figure S1). WT and bmp6+/\u2212 have a normally segmented vertebral column indicating that Bmp6 does not affect the overall development or patterning of the larval skeleton (figure 2 and online supplemental figure S3). In contrast to WT or control larvae, bmp6+/\u2212 have multiple defects reminiscent of EHOA, including bone erosions, structural defects in the vertebral precursors and ectopic cartilage formation. These data support that BMP6 is a strong candidate gene in EHOA.\nAll the above genes (ALDH1A2, MGP, BMP6, SPP1 and IBSP) are expressed in human cartilage,34 with relative expression from the 0.01st percentile (MGP) to the 12th percentile (BMP6).\nAssociation of EHOA variants with other OA subtypes and relevant diseases or traits To address association of the four EHOA variants with other OA subtypes and other diseases or traits, we used data from the GO consortium12 and public datasets (Open Targets Genetics and UK Biobank data). Furthermore, we generated EHOA PRS to run a non- hypothesis driven scan for genetic overlap with other diseases/traits in UK Biobank, and subsequently, assessed the genetic component shared by EHOA and other traits with LD score regression.\nAll four EHOA variants associated with finger OA in the GO consortium data (PBonferroni<0.0025) but with considerably lower OR estimate than for EHOA (table 3). All EHOA variants, except rs11243284 at 6p24.3, also associated nominally with thumb OA. Of special note is the opposite effect of rs1800801 (MGP) and rs11631127 (ALDH1A2) on knee OA compared with EHOA, that is, the EHOA risk alleles associated with reduced risk of knee OA, consistent with what was also observed in the GO consortium meta- analysis.12 None of the EHOA variants associated with spine OA.\nThree of the EHOA signals, rs17013495 (SPP1), rs1800801 (MGP) and rs11631127 (ALDH1A2), showed some multitrait associations, although mostly with musculoskeletal measures; hand grip strength and bone density (online supplemental table\nFigure 2 Loss of bmp6 causes erosive- like phenotypes in the zebrafish vertebral precursors.

Of note is association of rs17013495[C] with increased levels of urate and risk of gout, another form of arthritis caused by uric acid crystal deposition, but severe gout can also result in bone erosions. Follow- up of these observations for all four EHOA variants in UK Biobank data and in our meta- analysis of bone density shows an association of all four EHOA risk alleles with reduced grip strength (online supplemental figure S4), but only rs17013495 (SPP1/MEPE) associated with urate (online supplemental table S11). All four EHOA variants also associated nominally with lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS- BMD), but the direction of effects was not consistent between the four variants. Only rs1800801 (MGP) associated with BMD estimated with heel ultrasound (eBMD).\nConsistent with the above- described observations, the EHOA PRS scan was only significant (p<1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125, accounting for 5000 main phenotypes) for hand OA measures, other arthrosis diagnosis (ICD10:M19), polyarthrosis (ICD10:M15), pain due to OA and hand grip strength (online supplemental table S12).\nWe estimated the extent of shared genetics between EHOA and the other OA subtypes and the traits identified in the phenoscans through genetic correlation analysis. Although, not identified in the multitrait associations analysis nor in the PRS scan, we also included RA in this analysis because that it is another form of inflammatory arthritis that can result in bone erosions and is, as gout, a clinical differential diagnosis to EHOA.\nWe observed highest genetic correlation between EHOA and those types of OA of which EHOA is a subset, that is, finger OA and hand OA, followed by thumb OA, knee OA, hip OA and the weakest with spine OA (figure 3). Reduced grip strength, increased urate levels and gout were also nominally correlated genetically with EHOA, whereas measures of bone density and RA were not.\nThe extent of genetic correlation between EHOA and other OA types is also reflected by the associations of GO consortium variants with EHOA12 (online supplemental table S13). Eight of the 10 GO independent associations with hand, finger or thumb OA, associated with EHOA under a false discovery rate of 5% in our data, whereas only 3 of the remaining 68 independent knee, hip, spine or any OA variants did so. The small sample size of our EHOA dataset may not be powered to detect associations with these variants, however, similar results were also observed for direct comparison of the ORs of EHOA and the other OA subsets, irrespective of the significance of the association (online supplemental figure S5). We note that as for the EHOA variants reported here, a majority of the finger/hand OA variants associated with EHOA with larger ORs than with finger/hand OA in the GO data, indicating that EHOA is a severe subset of finger OA."

Despite a modest sample size of 1484 cases, we found 4 significant EHOA loci, all of which confer relatively high effect on EHOA risk.\nTwo of the associated loci, rs1800801 (MGP) and rs11631127 (ALDH1A2), have previously been associated with hand OA overall.9 10 12 Both of these loci also associated with knee OA with opposite effects to that of EHOA, that is, the EHOA risk alleles associate with protection of knee OA.12 The EHOA risk alleles at these loci co- localise with lower mRNA expression of ALDH1A2 and MGP in cartilage, other joint tissues as well as some other tissues,9 10 12 29 30 35 and the rs1800801 (MGP) risk allele also co- localises with lower levels of matrix Gla protein levels in plasma, indicating that ALDH1A2 and MGP genes are likely EHOA candidate causal genes at these loci.9 10 12 29 30 35 We also show that the matrix Gla protein in plasma is lower in EHOA patients than in controls, further supporting a causal role\nFigure 3 Genetic correlation between EHOA and other OA subtypes and diseases/traits The genetic correlation coefficient (rg) and SE, of genetic correlation between EHOA and other OA subtypes, any OA (which includes all types of OA), and several diseases/traits are shown.

The matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K dependent inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification, particularly of vascular and cartilage calcification.36 37 The function of the protein depends on the post- translational Ca++ binding \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid residues (Gla), mediated by vitamin K, but fully carboxylated form of matrix Gla protein has been shown to be lower in OA cartilage than in normal cartilage.38\nWe found two association signals for EHOA that have not been associated with OA before, rs17013495 (SPP1/MEPE) and rs11243284 (BMP6). Both variants associated nominally with finger OA in our data, although with lower effect. The SPP1/MEPE locus is a well- known locus for BMD39\u201341 and the EHOA risk variant also associated with increased LS- BMD in our data. We also observed association with increased levels of urate and risk of gout.\nThere are strong candidate genes at the SPP1/MEPE locus, that harbours a cluster of five genes that encode the SIBLNG (small integrin- binding ligand N- linked glycoprotein) family of extracellular matrix proteins, three of which are expressed in the relevant tissues of bone and/or cartilage: IBSP (bone sialoprotein 2), MEPE (matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein) and SPP1 (osteopontin). SPP1 is expressed in many tissues and cell types whereas expression of IBSP and MEPE is mostly restricted to bone, cartilage and teeth.42\u201344 We found co- localisation of rs17013495 EHOA risk variant and lower expression of SPP1 in spleen, and association with a secondary pQTL for plasma levels of osteopontin. We also observed lower levels of bone sialoprotein 2 in plasma of EHOA patients. The origin of this protein in plasma is most likely from bone as it constitutes approximately 12% of the non- collagenous proteins in human bone and is not expressed in other tissues than bone and/or cartilage. However, since no dataset is currently available to conduct well- powered eQTL or pQTL studies in joint tissues, the possible causal effect of these genes on EHOA cannot be differentiated at this stage. They all play key biological roles in the mineralisation of bone, form an integral part of the mineralised matrix and are involved in chondrocyte differentiation, bone formation and remodelling.45\nThe similarities in the bone phenotypes that we observed in the zebrafish bmp6 mutants we created with the clinical hallmarks of EHOA suggests that BMP6, that has a role in maintaining bone and joint homeostasis, is the candidate causative gene at the 6p24.3 locus. Although several studies have examined the function of BMP6 on bone formation, its precise role remains unclear possibly due to functional redundancy of other BMPs or genetic compensation.32 46\u201348 Recently, a GWAS found that an intronic variant in BMP6, rs12190551[C], uncorrelated with the EHOA signal, associated with spine OA. The spine OA risk allele correlated with reduced expression of BMP6 mRNA in the tibial nerve in the GTEx portal.27 Previous transcriptomic analysis of musculoskeletal tissue from bmp mutants has demonstrated that loss of bmp6 activated the NF-\u03baB pathway, which inhibited development of osteoblasts and promoted osteoclast formation.46 Further, gain- of- function and loss- of- function studies in animal models are needed to delineate the precise role and mechanism of BMP6 function in OA.49\nOur phenoscan of over 5000 different diseases and traits in UK Biobank using the EHOA PRS, as well as genetic correlation analysis using LD score regression, indicated that EHOA unsurprisingly shares genetics with different measures of OA, but also with decreased hand grip strength, increased urate concentrations\nand gout, but not RA. The genetic correlation with other OA subtypes shows, as expected, the most shared genetics between EHOA and finger and hand OA, of which EHOA is a subset. EHOA, gout and RA share the clinical features of joint inflammation, and erosions in the most severe cases of gout and RA. It should also be noted that it can be difficult to differentiate between EHOA and gout, both clinically and radiographically. In contrast to EHOA, there are several effective disease- modifying antirheumatic therapies available for RA that hinder progression to erosive disease, but those have not proven effective against EHOA, also indicating a different underlying pathogenesis.\nHere, we describe the first robust loci for EHOA. All four loci conferred relatively high risk of the disease, with one locus, rs1800801 in MGP, associating with EHOA under recessive mode of inheritance with OR=2.0, compared with additive association with finger OA, thus differentiating EHOA from finger OA. All four risk variants associated with lowered hand grip strength. Two of the EHOA variants, rs17013495 (SPP1/MEPE) and rs11243284 (BMP6), only associated with EHOA and/or hand OA, and no other type of OA. Of special note is the opposite effect of rs1800801 in MGP and rs11631127 in ALDH1A2 on knee OA compared with EHOA, that is, the EHOA risk allele of these variants confer protection of knee OA. The likely EHOA candidate genes at these loci implicate roles of cartilage calcification (MGP), vitamin A (ALDH1A2) and bone/cartilage mineralisation/remodelling (BMP6, SPP1/IBSP/MEPE) pathways in EHOA. Moreover, our results support the notion that EHOA is a severe form of hand OA as evident by higher risk of the EHOA and reported hand OA variants in EHOA than of fingers/ thumbs OA, as well as high genetic correlation. Our results also indicate some genetic, and or functional or biological, distinction between EHOA and OA in the larger joints, since the EHOA risk alleles either do not confer risk, or confer protection, of OA in these joints, and the lower genetic correlation."
