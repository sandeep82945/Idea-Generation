 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of COVID-19 on brand loyalty. The paper notes that no studies have looked at this relationship, representing a gap in the literature. Future research could explore how the pandemic has influenced consumer brand loyalty. 

2. Investigate the role of social media and brand experiences in building brand loyalty, as the paper identified these as emerging topics of interest. Studies could look at how brands can leverage social media and curate brand experiences to foster greater loyalty.

3. Conduct cross-cultural comparisons of brand loyalty antecedents and outcomes. The paper found brand loyalty research is prevalent in Asia, so comparing findings from Asian versus Western contexts could be insightful. 

4. Use experimental or longitudinal designs to uncover causal relationships between brand loyalty and related constructs like satisfaction and brand trust over time. Much of the current research is cross-sectional.  

5. Examine moderators or boundary conditions of established brand loyalty frameworks. For example, testing whether theoretical models hold across different demographics, product categories, or during times of disruption.
