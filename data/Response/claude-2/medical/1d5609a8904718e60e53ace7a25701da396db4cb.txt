 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further characterize the unusual plaque formation and non-thermal motion of phage 0105phi7-2. Conduct more experiments to understand the ATP-driven "ride-hitching" phenomenon and how it leads to increased plaque sizes. Explore if other phages exhibit similar behaviors. 

2. Study the partially condensed DNA conformations expelled from 0105phi7-2 capsids. Use techniques like cryo-EM or AFM to better visualize the structure of the expelled DNA. Compare to DNA conformations in other phages. Investigate how the packaging and structure influences DNA ejection.

3. Analyze the capsid assembly process of 0105phi7-2. It has minimal scaffolding requirements, so determine how the capsid assembles without a scaffolding protein. Look for other phages with similar assembly pathways. Explore if capsid assembly influences the condensed DNA conformations.

4. Examine the relationship between phage surface charge and blood persistence. Conduct more experiments correlating electrophoretic mobility with persistence for various phages. Develop assays using surface charge to rapidly screen phages for biomedical applications. 

5. Isolate and characterize more phages from biofilms and agarose gels. Use the unique in-gel propagation method to find new phages adapted to those conditions. Sequence and study their genomes and plaque morphologies. Discover other eccentric phage behaviors.
