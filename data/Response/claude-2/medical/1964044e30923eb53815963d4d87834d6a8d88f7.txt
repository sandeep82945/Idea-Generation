 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing anti-PD-1 monotherapy to combination therapy with anti-PD-1 plus anti-EGFR agent in patients with advanced cSCC. This could help determine if the combination is more effective in overcoming resistance. 

2. Explore biomarkers or gene expression profiles that may predict response or resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced cSCC patients. This could help select patients most likely to benefit.

3. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in high-risk cSCC patients after surgery/radiation. This could determine if it improves recurrence-free or overall survival. 

4. Assess quality of life and patient-reported outcomes with anti-PD-1 therapy versus standard chemotherapy in advanced cSCC patients. This could demonstrate if immunotherapy provides additional benefits.

5. Examine mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in cSCC through studies of tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment before/after treatment. This could uncover new therapeutic targets to overcome resistance.
