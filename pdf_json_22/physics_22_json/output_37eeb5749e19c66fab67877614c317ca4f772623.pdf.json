    "abstractText": "Primordial black holes, allegedly formed in the very early Universe, have been proposed as a possible viable dark matter candidate. In this work we characterize the expected gravitational wave signal detectable by the planned space-borne interferometer LISA and the proposed next generation spaceborne interferometer \u03bcAres arising from a population of primordial black holes orbiting Sgr A, the super-massive black hole at the Galactic center. Assuming that such objects indeed form the entire diffuse mass allowed by the observed orbits of stars in the Galactic center ( < \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 M within a radius of ' 10\u22123 pc from Sgr A), under the simplified assumption of circular orbits and monochromatic mass function, we assess the expected signal in gravitational waves, either from resolved and non-resolved sources. We estimate a small but non negligible chance of ' 10% of detecting one single 1 M primordial black hole with LISA in a 10-year-long data stream, while the background signal due to unresolved sources would essentially elude any reasonable chance of detection. On the contrary, \u03bcAres, with a ' 3 orders-of-magnitude better sensitivity at ' 10\u22125 Hz, would be able to resolve ' 140 solar mass primordial black holes in the same amount of time, while the unresolved background should be observable with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio & 100. Allowing the typical PBH mass to be in the range 0.01-10 M would increase LISA chance of detection to ' 40% towards the lower limit of the mass spectrum. In the case of \u03bcAres, instead, we find a \u201csweet spot\u201d just about 1 M , a mass for which the number of resolvable events is indeed maximized.",

On the contrary, \u00b5Ares, with a ' 3 orders-of-magnitude better sensitivity at ' 10\u22125 Hz, would be able to resolve ' 140 solar mass primordial black holes in the same amount of time, while the unresolved background should be observable with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio & 100. Allowing the typical PBH mass to be in the range 0.01-10 M would increase LISA chance of detection to ' 40% towards the lower limit of the mass spectrum. In the case of \u00b5Ares, instead, we find a \u201csweet spot\u201d just about 1 M , a mass for which the number of resolvable events is indeed maximized.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, partly motivated by the inconclusive results of many enterprises aimed at the detection of darkmatter particles (for a review see, e.g., [1\u20133]), primordial black holes (PBHs) gained increasing attention as a possible candidate [4\u20137] for such an elusive component, which accounts to 25% of the energy density of today\u2019s Universe. The existence of PBHs as physical objects was first proposed in 1966 by Zeldovich [8], and in 1971 Hawking similarly postulated how such objects could originate [9]. Current models trace the origin of PBHs to the collapse of large density perturbations in the early Universe, usually in the post-inflation era t & 10\u221238 s [10\u201314]. More recent work on possible formation channels include: formation by isocurvature perturbations, such as fragmentation of a real scalar field [15], resonant amplification of the curvature perturbations [16], vacuum tunneling during inflation [17], and scalaron+\u03c7 models [18], among others. Ref. [19] first proposed a simple relation between the typical mass of a newly formed PBH mPBH and its formation cosmic time t, i.e.,\nmPBH ' c3t\nG ' 1015 ( t 10\u221223 s ) g ' 105 ( t 1 s ) M . (1)\nAccordingly, since black holes lose mass because of Hawking radiation [9], a PBH is expected to evaporate completely in a timescale given by [20]:\n\u03c4 ' G 2m3PBH ~c4 ' 1064 (mPBH M )3 yrs. (2)\nWhile a lower limit on the current mass of a PBH is obtained by setting the evaporation time equal to the Hubble time, i.e., mPBH\n>\u223c 1015 g, no proper upper limits exist, at least on a theoretical ground. It is worth mentioning that recent theoretical arguments by [21] suggest that, under the assumption of a scale-invariant amplitude of primordial curvature fluctuations, the resulting PBH mass spectrum should show a clear peak at ' 1M . In terms of energy density, a first order estimate of the current contribution of PBHs to the dark matter component of the Universe is given in [20] as\nfPBH \u2261 \u2126PBH \u2126CDM\n' ( \u03b2\n10\u221218 )( mPBH 1015 g )\u22121/2 , (3)\nwhere \u2126PBH and \u2126CDM are the current density parameters in PBHs and in cold dark-matter, respectively, while \u03b2 is the fraction of the Universe mass in PBHs at their formation time. A number of different techniques aimed at determining upper limits on the PBH fraction as a dark matter component have been proposed, namely gravitational lensing, dynamical effects, influence on large-scale structure, accretion and gravitational waves (see [20] for a recent review). In particular, [22] estimated the properties of a population of PBHs orbiting the supermassive variety of BHs at the center of galaxies, deriving the expected signal in gravitational waves (GWs). After limiting the analysis to the case of Sgr A?, thanks to existing scaling relations [23, 24] the authors of [22] assessed the GW signal arising from the entire cosmic population of galaxies. Further work on the detectability of a GW stochastic background from PBHs can be found in [25, 26]. ar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n05 66\n3v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 A\nug 2\n02 2\n2 In the present paper we extend and refine the analysis of [22], by improving the physical soundness of the model in many aspects. In Section II we compute the expected density profile for PBHs orbiting Sgr A? near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), by considering the combined effects of two-body relaxation and GW losses, anchoring the PBH population to the one key observational constraint given by GRAVITY [27]. In particular, we adopt the upper limit of the diffuse mass allowed within the pericenter of the S2 star around Sgr A?, i.e., . 4\u00d7 103 M within rS2 \u2261 6\u00d7 10\u22124 pc from Sgr A? (i.e., about 1400 Schwarzschild Radii). In Section III we present a brief outline of the basic theoretical background of GW detection. In Section IV, through\ndedicated, extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, we estimate the GW characteristic strain from such constrained population of PBHs, considering observations performed by the planned space-borne interferometer LISA [28] and by the proposed next generation space-borne interferometer \u00b5Ares [29]. A distinction between resolved events and stochastic background is also then carried out before calculating the corresponding signal to noise ratios. Finally, Section V is dedicated to concluding remarks."

            "text": "AROUND SGRA?\nAs in [22], we assume that a population of PBHs with typical mass mPBH = 1M constitutes a fraction of the dark matter in the galactic center. As already pointed out, recent theoretical developments by [21] indicate indeed 1M as the preferred mass of PBHs (still, we will relax the assumption on the mass later on). PBHs are assumed to orbit Sgr A? on purely circular orbits, and are supposed to be initially distributed according to a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile [30]. Two-body relaxation then shapes the density profile \u03c1(r) on a characteristic timescale given by [31]\n\u03c42BR = 1.8\u00d7 1010 y\nlog(MMBH/mPBH) 1M mPBH\n103M pc \u22123\n\u03c1(r)\n( v(r)\n10km s\u22121\n)3 ,\n(4) where MMBH is the mass of the central black hole, mPBH is the typical mass of PBHs, and v(r) is the Keplerian mean velocity \u221a\n(GMMBH/r). Adopting MMBH = 4.3 \u00d7 106M [27], and by assuming the PBHs to be distributed within a spherical shell comprised between 10\u22126 pc and 10\u22123 pc from Sgr A?, we found a maximum mass density of PBHs of few 1015M pc\n\u22123 at ' 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc distance from Sgr A?, in agreement with [22]. To be more precise, over a relaxation time, a spike with \u03c1 \u221d r\u22127/3 is expected to form, and this is the default model that we consider here (with a cautionary \u03b3 = 1 power index in Eq. 1 of [22]). In the remainder of this work we will refer to this as a Spiked NFW profile. However, though neglected by [22], GW-driven inspirals and plunges of PBHs onto Sgr A? largely deplete the PBH population in the very\n10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123\nDistance from SgrA* [pc]\n103\n106\n109\n1012\n1015\n1018\n1021\nT im\ne to\nco al\nes ce\nnc e\n[y r]\nTwo body relax GW\nFIG. 1: Characteristic timescales of 2-body relaxation (dotted line) and GW orbital decay (dashed line) for mPBH = 1 M , from the ISCO of Sgr A ? out to 10\u22123 pc.

The numerical value is appropriate for a 1M PBH orbiting Sgr A\n? at the S2 pericenter. The above equation assumes circular orbits and quadrupole approximation. The two timescales \u03c42BR and \u03c4GW are shown as functions of the distance from Sgr A? in Fig. 1 as dotted and dashed lines, respectively, for the aforementioned selection of the input parameters. It is apparent how closer to Sgr A? than ' 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 pc the dynamical evolution of the PBHs population is no longer relaxation-dominated, but is driven by GW radiation losses. At such characteristic distance the time to coalescence because of GWs is ' 4.2 \u00d7 108 y. Finally, the PBH number density distribution dN/dr (i.e., the number of objects within r and r + dr distance from Sgr A?) can be found by combining these two processes, and the resulting steady-state PBH number density profile, normalized so that the diffused mass within ' 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc from Sgr A? is <\u223c 4 \u00d7 103M , is displayed in Fig. 2 for a number of plausible relaxation-driven density profiles. In the GW-domain region the PBH number density is \u221d r4, while in the outer relaxation-domain it will follow the assumed density profile. In this work we first consider the Spiked NFW density profile (solid line in Fig. 2) from [22, 33], while in Section III we further study the cases for a Bahcall-Wolf (dashed line) and isothermal sphere (dotdashed line) density profiles. It is interesting to note how, given the similar scaling with mPBH of \u03c42BR and \u03c4GW (Eq. 4 and Eq. 5, respectively), the location of the turning point in the distribution shown in Fig. 2 is almost independent of the actual value of mPBH.\n3 10\u22126 10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123\nDistance from SgrA* [pc]\n10\u22127\n10\u22126\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\nd N /d r\nSpiked NFW Bahcall-Wolf Isothermal sphere\nFIG. 2: Number density distribution dN/dr of 1 M PBHs around Sgr A?, with GW sink, showing the number of PBHs in a spherical shell between r and r + dr.

Following, e.g., [34], for an interferometer with nonperpendicular arms such as LISA, letting \u03b1 be the angle between two arms, the detector beam pattern functions F+ and F\u00d7 are defined as\nF+(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8) = sin\u03b1 [1\n2 (1 + cos2 \u03b8) sin(\u03b1+ 2\u03c6) cos 2\u03c8 (6)\n+ cos \u03b8 cos(\u03b1+ 2\u03c6) sin 2\u03c8 ] ,\nF\u00d7(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8) = sin\u03b1 [1\n2 (1 + cos2 \u03b8) sin(\u03b1+ 2\u03c6) sin 2\u03c8 (7)\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 cos(\u03b1+ 2\u03c6) cos 2\u03c8 ] ,\nwhere the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 define the source sky position, and \u03c8 is the angle of the polarization plane with respect to the line of sight. The strain amplitude in the time domain h(t) is then\nh(t) = F+(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8)h+(t) + F\u00d7(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8)h\u00d7(t), (8)\nwhere, in the case of circular orbits, the amplitudes for\nthe two polarization modes are [32]\nh+(t) = 4\nr (GMc c2 )5/3(\u03c0f c )2/3(1 + cos2 \u03b9 2 ) (9)\n\u00d7 cos(2\u03c0f tret + 2\u03c60),\nh\u00d7(t) = 4\nr (GMc c2 )5/3(\u03c0f c )2/3 cos \u03b9 (10)\n\u00d7 sin(2\u03c0f tret + 2\u03c60).\nHere tret = t \u2212 |x\u2212x \u2032|\nc indicates retarded time, where x and x\u2032, as per the definition in Chapter 3 of [32] are, respectively, the distances at any time t from the source\u2019s center to the detector and to a point inside the source. The \u201coptimal orientation\u201d case occurs when the source has angular momentum directed towards the detector, so it is face on, e.g., when \u03b8, \u03c6 and \u03c8 combine to give\nF+ = 1, (11)\nF\u00d7 = 0, (12)\nwhile the \u201caverage case\u201d is defined whenever\n\u3008F 2+\u3009 = \u3008F 2\u00d7\u3009. (13)\nFor further reference, see [34] and [35], or also [36]. In our work we will make use of the inclination-and-polarization averaged strain, i.e.,\nh = \u221a \u3008h2+ + h2\u00d7\u3009. (14)\nSince we are considering sources in the Galactic center, we can ignore factors (1 + z) stemming from the Universe expansion. The inclination-and-polarization averaged strain amplitude h as a function of frequency is therefore simply given by [37]\nh(f, d) = 8\u03c02/3G5/3f2/3M5/3c\nc4 \u221a 10 d , (15)\nwhere Mc = \u00b53/5m2/512 is the chirp mass and d is the distance to the source. From the strain, the signal to noise ratio of the event can be computed as\nSNR(f) = h(f) \u221a Ncyc(f)\u221a\nfSn(f) , (16)\nwhere, assuming that binaries are quasi-stationary during the observation time, the number of cycles as a function of observation time tobs and frequency f , is given by Ncyc = tobs \u00d7 f . In Eq. 16, the so-called noise spectral density Sn(f) (sometimes referred to as the noise spectral sensitivity or spectral amplitude) has units [Hz\u22121], and quantifies the sensitivity of the GW detector. When computing the expected GW signal detectable by LISA we will adopt the noise spectral density reported in [38]. Although the sources that we consider are originated at the Galactic center, we will use the sky averaged Sn(f).\n4 10\u22127 10\u22126 10\u22125 10\u22124 10\u22123\nFrequency [Hz]\n10\u221219\n10\u221217\n10\u221215\n10\u221213\n10\u221211\nS en\nsi ti\nvi ty \u221a f S n (f\n)\n\u00b5Ares LISA\nFIG. 3: Sensitivities for LISA (dot-dashed line) and \u00b5Ares (dotted line) in the relevant frequency range.\nWhile this choice is primarily driven by simplicity, it should be noted that PBHs are persistent sources and their signal will build-up in the data stream for the whole duration of the mission. Being the north ecliptic pole tilted by approximately 60o with respect to the galactic north pole and being the LISA constellation tilted by 60o with respect to the ecliptic, along the LISA orbit, the galactic center will be seen at a variable inclination, spanning a wide range essentially from being face-on to being edge-on. As for \u00b5Ares, the proposed design features two constellations in perpendicular planes, making the use of sky-averaged sensitivity a reasonable compromise in both cases. Finally, we will add to the instrumental sensitivity curve the background noise arising from the cosmic population of white dwarf (WD) binaries [39, 40]. When forecasting the GW signal in \u00b5Ares data stream, we will take Sn(f) from [29]; note that in this case the instrumental noise already takes into account the WD background (see also [41] for a recent take on an alternative technique to detect stochastic backgrounds in the \u00b5Hz band relying on binary resonance probes). The observation time tobs (i.e., the proper \u201cdata-taking\u201d time) for the LISA interferometer is currently set to be & 4.5 yrs long, though potentially 10 years of data could be collected, if mission operations are extended and there is no failure in the hardware. Similarly, for the proposed \u00b5Ares mission, at the time of writing a >\u223c 10-year long mission is foreseen. In the following section, we will refer to tobs = 10 yrs for both interferometers.\n1 Fig. 3 shows the sensitivities of LISA and \u00b5ARES in the frequency range relevant to our study.\n1 Note that, given the monochromatic nature of our targets, results are essentially unaffected if the data are obtained in a continuous stream, rather than collected along a longer mission with a duty cycle of less than 100%."

Then, for each source in the catalog, we compute the GW signal and its SNR according to the LISA and \u00b5ARES sensitivities. As in a typical catalog realization LISA would resolve from zero to a maximum of 1 event, in order to have a statistically significant figure we run a total of 1,000 simulations. Fig. 4 shows the probability, computed over 1,000 Monte-Carlo realizations, that a catalog contains a given number of resolved events. Regarding LISA, it is apparent how the vast majority of realizations contain no detection whatsoever, with few simulations resulting in just 1 event. Statistically, there is a ' 11% probability that one PBH might be resolved by LISA in 10 year of data collection, with the remaining 89% probability of null detection4.\n2 Circular EMRIs like the ones considered here are essentially monochromatic sources featuring a waveform very similar to that of galactic white dwarf binaries, for which resolvability down to SNR\u2248 8 has been demonstrated in early LISA mock data challenges [42]. 3 The frequency resolution of the data is defined as the inverse of tobs, so that for tobs = 10 (4.5) yrs, the corresponding frequency resolution will be 3 (7)\u00d7 10\u22129 Hz. 4 Detection probabilities are only slightly modified by a change in tobs, which in turn affects the frequency bin width and the number of cycles in the characteristic strain. For instance, halving tobs would reduce the SNR by a factor \u221a 2.\n5 Given its much higher sensitivity at low frequencies, the outcome for \u00b5Ares is strikingly different, resulting in an average of ' 140 detected PBHs in 10 years. The probability distribution, again computed over 1,000 realizations, is well fit by a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation of 139.6 and 9.7, respectively. Under the assumption that the unresolved matter within the Galactic center is entirely formed by PBHs, this means that \u00b5Ares would have a chance of 99.9% of resolving a minimum of 110 solar-mass PBHs orbiting Sgr A?. Under our assumption of circular orbits and inclination-andpolarization averaged strain, there exist 1:1:1 relations among the radial distance of a PBH to Sgr A?, its GW frequency and the SNR of the event. From the source catalogs we can then compute frequency and SNR distributions, shown in Fig. 5. The distributions are obtained adopting a logarithmic binning in frequency, and are normalized so that the sum of the histogram heights gives the average number of resolved events, i.e., 0.11 in the case of LISA and 140 for \u00b5Ares. Regarding LISA, all we can say is that the single one event possibly resolved during 10 years of data collection would have a higher chance to fall in the frequency range 3.5\u00d7 10\u22125 . f . 6\u00d7 10\u22125 Hz, corresponding to 8 . SNR . 30. \u00b5Ares, instead, will produce a genuine distribution of resolved events, covering at least one decade in frequency with an SNR as large as few hundreds. Finally, we note that the detection statistics is mainly driven by the SNR> 8 constraint, as for f & 10\u22125 Hz there are, on average, less than 1 PBH per frequency bin\nanyway. This applies to both interferometers, although in the case of \u00b5Ares some overlap may occur in the lower frequency bins, where the number of resolvable sources is larger (Fig. 5, panel b). The figures reported here, and in next \u00a7 IV C as well, would be only marginally affected by a different choice of the SNR threshold. As an example, an SNR threshold of 5 would rather produce a . 1% increase in the chances of detection by LISA and a ' 5% increase in the number of sources resolvable by \u00b5Ares."

The results are again obtained averaging over 1,000 simulation runs, and refer to a 10-year-long data stream.

Regarding possible PBH masses connected to GW detection, we can limit the pertaining parameter space as follows. Based on various current upper limits (see, e.g., [20]), a window exists between 10\u221216 and 10\u221211 M where 100% of dark matter could be in the form of PBHs without violating any observational constraint. However, such PBHs would be much too light to enter the GW-dominated regime5. This is true up until \u223c 10\u22124 M , where, still according to [20], the maximum allowed dark matter fraction in the form of PBHs happens to be \u2248 1%. A more operational mass limit for PBHs can be set by considering the minimum mass orbiting Sgr A? at the ISCO (i.e. at 1.2\u00d710\u22126 pc) whose GW losses are above the detection threshold. Such mass turns out to be & 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 M for the LISA sensitivity.

Having considered all this, we redo our analysis allowing the PBHs to have masses as low as 0.01 M , for which the maximum possible dark matter fraction in PBHs is between a few and 10%, and as large as 10 M , for which similar constraints exist [20]. Note that the fixed total mass allowed in our models sets the number of PBHs orbiting Sgr A? to 4000 M /mPBH. We also change the PBH density distribution \u03c1(r), testing two alternative models, different from the Spiked NFW profile adopted so far: an isothermal profile, \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22122, and a Bahcall-Wolf profile, \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22127/4 [46], again normalized to 4000 M within the S2 pericenter, and again shaped in the inner region by GW losses. The resulting distributions are shown in Fig. 2. It is important to notice that while for the Spiked NFW case the peak of the number distribution is at the sink radius rsink (i.e., the distance form Sgr A? where two-body relaxation and GW timescales are equal), in the case of an isothermal profile we have the same number of PBHs at every r > rsink , and that for a Bahcall-Wolf profile the higher PBH density occurs at the largest allowed distance. This very fact\nbears important consequences when forecasting detection figures. Results of our analysis are reported in Table I, where all the tested cases are summarized. Generally speaking, when we change mPBH, we are dealing with two competing effects: on the one hand lighter PBHs are more numerous, on the other hand the GW signal from a single source is weaker. On top of that, the GW signal has to be folded into the sensitivity curve of the interferometer under consideration. It is the interplay among these three effects that sets the outcome of the experiment that we performed. Having this in mind, it is more practical discussing results for LISA and \u00b5Ares separately. In the case of LISA, it is apparent that the larger the number of PBHs (i.e., the lower mPBH), the larger the number of resolved events, in agreement with naive expectations. Indeed, the low frequency sensitivity of LISA scales approximately as f\u22122.5 (see Fig. 3) and, according to [47], this would produce a number of resolved events Nres \u221d M\u22125/11c . As mPBH MBH implies Mc \u221d m3/5PBH, then Nres \u221d m\u22123/11PBH . An increase of 3 dex in mPBH would then result in a decrease of resolved events of a factor \u2248 7, in line with our findings. Note however that, for tobs = 10 yrs, we find Nres < 1, i.e., we can merely interpret such number as a probability of detecting a single resolved event during the mission. Such probability is as large as 60% in the case of mPBH = 0.01 M with an isothermal profile. Note also that while the Spiked NFW and isothermal cases give comparable results, the shallow Bahcall-Wolf distribution reduces the probability of detection by an order of magnitude. Rather interestingly, the median SNR of the possible detection is very similar in all tested cases.\nConcerning the possibility of a LISA detection of background noise arising from the population of PBHs, though the SNR increases for lower masses, none of our models predict a statistically significant stochastic signal in the LISA data stream. For \u00b5Ares results are somewhat less straightforward. In this case (see Fig. 3) the sensitivity curve features a sort of plateau for f >\u223c 10\u22125.5 Hz, basically shaped by the WD stochastic background. For large values of mPBH, Nres is determined by the steep slope of the sensitivity curve for f . 10\u22125.5 Hz. This is because in this case the GW signal is strong enough that PBHs enter the observability band well below 10\u22125.5 Hz. Reducing the typical PBH mass would then increase Nres, because of the very same reason seen in the case of LISA. However this is true only down to a certain mass, for which PBHs start entering the observability band above 10\u22125.5 Hz, i.e., in the flat part of the sensitivity curve. Further lowering the mass would lead more and more sources to fall well below detectability threshold. The combined effects of PBH typical mass and sensitivity then creates a \u201csweet spot\u201d for Nres happening to be just around mPBH ' 1 M , as reported in Table I. As in the case of LISA, the shallow Bahcall-Wolf profile gives an order of magnitude less detections. Still, even in this unfavorable circumstance, only for the lowest PBH mass the number of resolved events in 10 years is\n8 below unity. Finally, regarding background detectability, in all cases \u00b5Ares would produce a signal with a very high SNR."

            "heading": "V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "If a distribution of PBHs is present in our Galaxy, it might concentrate at the Galactic center, where these objects would be expected to orbit around the central massive black hole Sgr A?, thus constituting possible sources for gravitational wave detectors. Assuming a stationary distribution of PBHs subject to two-body relaxation and gravitational-wave driven infall toward Sgr A?, and complying with the mass limits posed by S2 pericenter precession [27], we have computed the expected (resolved and unresolved) GW signal detectable by future space-borne observatories such as LISA and \u00b5Ares. Although simplified, our model shows that there is a ' 10% chance for LISA to resolve a 1 M primordial black hole during a 10 years observation time, while even less likely is the detection of a background signal. A solid chance of detection might instead be expected from the proposed space-borne interferometer \u00b5Ares, whose higher sensitivity would allow one to resolve from several to more than one hundred PBHs, regardless of the actual typical mass or density profile, and to detect an unresolved background with a signal to noise ratio well above detection threshold. Another important question has to do with inferring the nature of the detected sources. In other words, should LISA detect a 1 M source orbiting Sgr A\n?, will it be possible to distinguish between a primordial black hole from an astrophysical object, such as a star, or a brown dwarf? First, we should notice that measuring the (chirp) mass of a source (and thus the mass of the PBH) is only possible if the frequency is evolving, i.e., if the source is not completely monochromatic. From the quadrupole formula, the source frequency\u2019s rate of change is [48]\nf\u0307 = 96\n5 \u03c08/3 (GMc c3 )5/3 f11/3 . (19)\nThe frequency resolution \u2206f of an experiment is the inverse of tobs, i.e., \u2206f ' 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 Hz for 10 years of observation. At the highest resolved frequency by LISA (see Fig. 5a), i.e. f ' 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz, the time needed for the frequency to change by \u2206f is 19 days. At the lowest resolved frequency by LISA (again see Fig. 5a), f ' 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 Hz, the time goes up to 87 years. The cutoff frequency, where it takes exactly 10 years for the frequency to change by \u2206f , is 7.2\u00d7 10\u22125 Hz. Should the data stream span less than 10 years, say 4.5 years, such cutoff frequency would rise to ' 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz, taking into account that \u2206f would change accordingly. Therefore, we do not expect the mass of the PBH candidate to be measurable for all the detected events. Even for the events with measurable mass, a possible astrophysical origin should be considered. To distinguish between a star and a PBH, one may consider tidal effects. In more\ndetail, a star would be tidally disrupted at the tidal disruption radius [49] rt = R?(\nMBH m? )1/3 with R? and m? the star\u2019s radius and mass. For a solar-type star the tidal radius is rt, \u2248 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 pc, or 9 Schwarzschild radii. As can be easily understood by comparing e.g. to our Fig. 2, this is way too close to Sgr A? to prove useful for telling 1 M PBHs and stars apart. For comparison, at a distance of 10\u22125 pc, which is well within the range of Fig. 2, the typical stars that would be tidally disrupted would be ones like S2 (i.e. a B0 star with mass ' 14M and radius ' 7R ). Clearly, tidal effects can be more subtle, as a deformed star, even if not disrupted, would show characteristic tidal effects in the gravitational waveforms. However, those would only be observable if the source frequency is evolving (cf. the discussion on the mass estimate right above). Even more difficult would be to distinguish a neutron star from a PBH of similar mass; only in the case of a pulsar would such distinction be easily performed. These preliminary considerations show that, although the detection of PBHs in the GC might be feasible in the future, recognizing their PBH nature might not be at all straightforward. In future work, we will therefore study in more detail the parameter estimation capabilities of LISA and \u00b5Ares, focusing on the distinctness between PBHs and stars/brown dwarfs. Additionally, we will also assess the impact of eccentric PBH orbits on our results. In fact, a relaxed isotropic cusp of PBHs in the Galactic center is expected to feature a thermal eccentricity distribution, i.e. p(e) \u221d e. Therefore, despite GW-driven circularization, we expect the overall signal to be dominated by eccentric sources. The importance of eccentricity is twofold. On the one hand, eccentric sources emit at higher frequencies, which might significantly increase the chances of LISA to see such systems. On the other hand, eccentric sources evolve much more rapidly, thus allowing for a better determination of the source mass, therefore helping the assessment of the source nature. In closing, we underline that, compared to LISA and \u00b5Ares, thanks to their sensitivity at higher frequencies ground-based interferometers such as the next Einstein Telescope [50] will play a complementary role in the search for GWs emitted by PBHs, e.g., in the detection of binaries of such objects [51, 52]. Indeed, the prospects of genuine multi-frequency GW observations [43] will greatly increase our chances of testing the existence of such an elusive population of black holes."
