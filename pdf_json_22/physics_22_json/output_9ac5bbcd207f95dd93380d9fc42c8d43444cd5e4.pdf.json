These narrow distinct peaks are usually characterized by heir centroid frequency, \u03bd, and quality factor Q = \u03bd/ \u03bd, where \u03bd is their full-width half maximum (FWHM). According to these roperties, and the shape and level of the underlying broad-band oise in the PDS, these LF QPOs were classified into three main ypes, namely A, B, and C (Wijnands, Homan & van der Klis 1999 ; emillard et al. 2002 ; Casella, Belloni & Stella 2005 ). Among these\nhree types, the type-C are the most common ones, characterized y variabilities of up to 20 per cent and narrow peaks usually ith Q 10.

Several models had been proposed to explain the dynamical origin f type-C QPOs, based either on geometrical effects, associated to he Lense\u2013Thirring precession frequency (LTP; Stella & Vietri 1998 ; chnittman, Homan & Miller 2006 ; Ingram, Done & Fragile 2009 ), r instabilities in the accretion flow (Tagger & Pellat 1999 ; Cabanac t al. 2010 ), but their physical origin remains a matter of debate. he geometrical scenario proposed by Ingram et al. ( 2009 ) based n relativistic precession requires two main components: a cool ptically thick and geometrically thin accretion disc (Shakura & unyaev 1973 ), which is truncated at r t > r ISCO , where r ISCO is the adius of the innermost-stable circular orbit, and a hot, geometrically hick, accretion flow inside r t (Esin, McClintock & Narayan 1997 ; outanen, Krolik & Ryde 1997 ). In this model, the type-C QPOs are roduced by the extended hot inner flow that modulates the X-ray flux s it precesses at the LTP frequency (Fragile et al. 2007 ). The model redicts that this effect should increase with source inclination. In his framework, the broad-band noise in the PDS, instead, would rise from variations in the mass accretion rate that propagate from he outer regions of the disc towards the BH (Ingram & van der Klis 013 ). In general, the frequency of the type-C QPO increases as the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). ty.

In the LTP model (Ingram t al. 2009 ), the change in hardness is interpreted as a variation in the uter radius of the hot inner flow. In models involving an extended omptonizing medium, or corona (Thorne & Price 1975 ; Sunyaev Truemper 1979 ), the hardness changes are attributed to variations n the physical properties of this medium, like the optical depth r electron temperature, or in geometrical properties, like its size Kazanas, Hua & Titarchuk 1997 ).\nDespite the big efforts pursued to understand the physical origin f the QPO dynamics, less attention has been put to quantitatively xplain the time-dependent radiative properties of these QPOs, which re given by the energy and frequency dependence of the QPO mplitudes and phase lags. Sobolewska & Z\u0307ycki ( 2006 ) analysed he variability-amplitude (RMS) spectra of the Type-C QPO in ev eral BH XRBs. The y found that ev en in observations where a oft disc-like thermal component was evident in the time-averaged pectra, this component was not found in the RMS spectrum of the POs, indicating that the QPO strongly modulates the Comptonized mission, although not the emission coming directly from the disc. n this sense, the lack of a disc imprint in the QPO spectrum is a omplication for QPO models based on disc oscillations (Ingram & otta 2020 ). Some models for the QPO phase lags can be found in (Lee Miller 1998 ; Shaposhnikov 2012 ; Misra & Mandal 2013 ). The uccessiv e inv erse Compton up-scattering of soft-photons by hot lectrons was suggested as the physical explanation for the hard lags bserved in the broad-band noise component in the PDS of Cyg X-1 Miyamoto et al. 1988 ). In turn, broad-band soft lags can be naturally roduced by reverberation off the accretion disc. That is the case in recently disco v ered BH candidate (MAXI J1820 + 070), where a mall contracting corona of a few gravitational radii ( R g = GM / c 2 , ere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the compact bject, and c the speed of light) was suggested based on the frequency volution of the soft reverberation lags measured in the source (Kara t al. 2019 ). Ho we ver, the lags associated to the LF QPOs are usually uch larger than those found in the broad-band noise, and cannot e explained by reverberation from a small-scale hot inner flow (De arco et al. 2015 ). In a Comptonization scheme, soft lags can be generated through a eedback process, if a significant fraction of the up-scattered photons mpinge back on to the soft-photon source (Lee, Misra & Taam 001 ). A variety of models (e.g. Nobili et al. 2000 ; Ingram et al. 009 , 2016 ) invoking different physical processes can explain the PO phase lags, but not many of those models can predict the nergy-dependent rms amplitude of the variability. Motta et al. ( 2015 ) uggested that the rms amplitude of the type-C QPO is higher for high nclination sources compared to low ones. More recently, van den ijnden et al. ( 2017 ) found evidence that in low-inclination sources, bo v e a certain QPO frequency, the phase-lags of the QPO are hard nd increase with QPO frequency, meanwhile, for high-inclination ources, the opposite is found: QPO phase-lags are soft and decrease s the QPO frequency increases. These inclination dependence may a v our a geometrical origin, but a full explanation for the very diverse bservational findings in the subject is still lacking. GRS 1915 + 105 is a very particular BH low-mass X-ray binary LMXB). It has been in outburst since its disco v ery (Castro-Tirado, randt & Lund 1992 ; Castro-Tirado et al. 1994 ) and did not show he typical Q-shape in the HID. Being active during the whole 5-yr lifetime of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ; Bradt, othschild & Swank 1993 ) mission, GRS 1915 + 105 is hence one f the most comprehensively observed and studied sources in the XTE archive (for a review on GRS 1915 + 105 , we refer the reader o Fender & Belloni 2004 ). GRS 1915 + 105 was the first XRB to\nhow superluminal ejections of synchrotron-emitting components n the radio band, through a relativistic jet (Mirabel & Rodr \u0301\u0131guez 994 ). Using very-long baseline array observations, Reid et al. ( 2014 ) easured the trigonometric parallax to GRS 1915 + 105, yielding a istance estimate of 8.6 + 2 . 0 \u22121 . 6 kpc and a BH mass of 12.4 + 2 . 0 \u22121 . 8 M .\nThe spectral-timing properties of the LF QPOs in RS 1915 + 105 had been studied in several papers (Markwardt, wank & Taam 1999 ; Vignarca et al. 2003 ; Rodriguez et al. 2004 ). emarkably, a change in the sign of the phase lags between soft and ard X-rays in the type-C QPO has been recognized at QPO frequenies around 2 Hz (Reig et al. 2000 ; Pahari et al. 2013 ). This effect as been thoroughly studied in a recent work by Zhang et al. ( 2020 ). nalysing the energy-dependent lag spectra of \u223c600 observations f the type-C QPO, the authors find that the slope of the lag spectra as a clear dependence on the QPO frequenc y, being positiv e below 1.8 Hz, flat or zero at frequencies around \u223c2 Hz, and becoming e gativ e at higher QPO frequencies. At the same time, Zhang et al. 2020 ) show that the fractional-variability (rms) amplitude of the PO is maximum when the lags are flat (around \u223c2 Hz). Moti v ated by the recent model from Karpouzas et al. ( 2020 ) and he unique e xtensiv e data set available for GRS 1915 + 105 , in this aper, we present a systematic study of the evolving properties of he corona of GRS 1915 + 105 by fitting a variable-Comptonization odel to the energy-dependent phase lag and fractional rms ampliude spectra of the Type-C QPO in 398 RXTE observations. To do his: (i) we measure the full set of energy-dependent rms-amplitudes f the Type-C QPOs detected by RXTE , (ii) we take the energyependent phase-lags measurements available in Zhang et al. ( 2020 ), nd (iii) we also use the time-averaged physical properties of the orona of GRS 1915 + 105 fitted to the same set of observations n M \u0301endez et al. ( 2022 ). In Section 2 , we present our sample f observations and the methods employed to measure the QPO ariability and the time-averaged spectral properties. In Section 3 , e briefly describe the spectral-timing Comptonization model used. n Section 4 , we show the results obtained with the spectral-timing ts to the data and we discuss them in Section 5 .\nOBSERVATI ONS A N D DATA ANALYSI S\nhang et al. ( 2020 ) examined the full set of observations of RS 1915 + 105 obtained with the proportional counter array (PCA) n-board the RXTE (Zhang et al. 1993 ) between 1996 and 2012. or each observation, Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) calculated a Fourier PDS n the full energy range ( PCA channels 0\u2013249) every 128 s, with /128 s time resolution (which corresponds to a Nyquist frequency f 64 Hz). They subsequently averaged the 128-s power spectra ithin each observation, subtracted the Poisson contribution, and reormalized them to units of fractional rms squared per Hz. Since the ource count rate w as al w ays very high, they ignored the background ontribution in the conversion to rms units. Finally, they re-binned he power spectra using a logarithmic step in frequency, such that he size of each frequency bin is exp(1/100) times larger than the revious one. In order to fit the resulting power spectra, the authors onstructed a model XSPEC V12.9 (Arnaud 1996 ) consisting of a sum f Lorentzian functions to represent the broad-band noise component nd the different QPOs (see Zhang et al. 2020 , for more details of he analysis).\nFollowing Zhang et al. ( 2020 ), in this paper, we selected the bservations that have a significant QPO consistent with the charcteristics of the type-C QPOs, namely: the observations are in he \u03c7 state, equi v alent to the hard-intermediate state (HIMS), the ower spectrum showed at least one narrow peak ( Q \u2248 5\u201315, nd strictly Q > 4) significantly detected ( > 3 \u03c3 ) on top of the\nMNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\n4198 F.

As in Zhang et al. ( 2020 ), we excluded bservations in which the QPO frequency changed significantly uring one observation. We then cross-matched our RXTE sample ith publicly available observations of GRS 1915 + 105 with the Ryle adio telescope at 15 GHz (Pooley & Fender 1997 ), considering that n X-ray and radio observation where \u2018simultaneous\u2019 if they were erformed within 2 d. This process yields a final data set consisting f 410 observations, with the type-C QPO detected within the 0.4\u2013 .3 Hz frequency range (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ).\n.1 Spectral-timing analysis of the low-frequency Type-C QPO\nollowing the method described in Vaughan & Nowak ( 1997 ) and owak et al. ( 1999 ), Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) produced frequencyependent phase-lags between the 2 and 5.7 and 5.7 and 15 keV nergy bands for each observation. Since the RXTE data set contains bservations performed during different PCA calibration epochs 3\u20135), the authors actually selected the closest absolute channels atching these energy bands considering the PCA channel-to-energy ain factor. 1 The QPO phase lags were obtained by averaging the lagrequency spectrum around the QPO centroid, \u03bd0 \u00b1 FWHM /2, where WHM is the FWHM of the Lorentzian used to fit the QPO profile. urthermore, following Uttley et al. ( 2014 ), for each observation in he sample, Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) also calculated energy-dependent hase lags at the QPO, using the 4\u20136, 6\u20138, 8\u201311, 11\u201315, 15\u201321, and 1\u201344 keV energy bands as subject bands, and the 2\u20134 keV energy and as the (soft) reference band. (We refer the reader to Zhang et al. 020 , for more details of the spectral-timing analysis). In our paper, hase lags are positive when they are hard, meaning that the hard hotons lag the soft ones. In order to measure the energy-dependent fractional-rms spectra,\ne proceeded in a slightly different way. Since we were also nterested in studying the full frequency range where the PDS shows ignificant variability, we used clean event files with a time resolution f 1/512 s, which correspond to a Nyquist frequency of 256 Hz, ivided into segments of 16 s. We generated the averaged PDS, ubtracted the Poisson level, and applied a logarithmic rebin in requency (using a factor exp (1/100)), considering the full set of CA channels. We also split the light curves into five subsets using hannels 0\u201313, 14\u201335, 36\u201350, \u223c51\u2013103, \u223c104\u2013249, respectively, to btain the energy-dependent rms, which in this case has a slightly ower energy resolution than in the case of the lags (as we used he data modes with higher time resolution). Here, the \u2018 \u223c\u2019 symbol ndicates that we use the closest channel boundary available in each bservation. In some observations, performed in single-bit mode, the hannels start from channel 8, and hence we use 8\u201313 as our first ubset of channels. To define more or less the same energy bands, we alculate the energy channels independently for each observation, ased on the channel-to-energy conversion of the epoch when each bservation was performed. To properly estimate the fractional rms nd its error bar, we take into account the background rate, which ecomes a significant fraction of the total observed count rate at the ardest X-ray bands. We notice that the PDS of channels \u223c104\u2013249 s al w ays noisy, and the QPO is not detected, and thus we exclude his channel range in our analysis. Following the method described bo v e, we use the best-fitting model of the full PDS to fit the PDS btained for each energy band. We obtain the rms of the QPO as the quare root of the normalization, N , of the Lorentzian that fits the PO. Taking into account the propagation of errors from the count\nNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\nhttps:// heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ docs/xte/e-c table.html\nF r g S\nates of the source, S , and the source plus background, SB , on the ms, we obtain its uncertainty, \u03c3 rms , from:\nrms = rms \u221a 1\n4 (\u03c3N N )2 + 1 4 (\u03c3SB SB )2 + (\u03c3S S )2 , (1)\nhere \u03c3 denotes the corresponding variance of each quantity. In this rocess, we found 12 observations that had energy channels where the PO was not significant, and thus we decided to exclude them from he subsequent analyses. These led us with a final data set consisting f 398 observations for which we ha ve: time-a veraged spectral data, nergy-dependent phase-lags, and fractional rms amplitudes of the ype-C QPO, as well as radio-flux measurements at 15 GHz.\n.2 Hardness ratio\nor each indi vidual RXTE observ ation of GRS 1915 + 105 analysed n this paper, we calculate a hardness ratio ( HR ) between the ackground-subtracted count rates of the source in the 13\u201360 keV, ard , and the 2\u20137 keV, soft , band, using the closest absolute channels atching these energy ranges according to the PCA gain epoch. e correct the observed count rates for instrumental dead time and ormalize them to the rate of the Crab in the same bands beforehand see e.g. Altamirano et al. 2008 ).\nIn Fig. 1 , the colours of the points give the QPO phase lags (leftand panel) and fractional rms amplitude (right-hand panel) as a unction of HR ( y -axis) and QPO frequency ( \u03bd0 , x -axis) for the 98 observations of GRS 1915 + 105 , in what we, from now on, all QPO \u2212 HR diagrams (see also Trudolyubov 2001 ; M \u0301endez et al. 022 ). On the one hand, the phase lags show a strong dependence on he QPO frequency (as previously discussed by Zhang et al. 2020 ) and weak dependence on HR (the colour gradients are nearly horizontal n the plot). On the other hand, the rms amplitudes show a more omplex dependence on the QPO \u2212 HR diagram. Observations with he highest rms values cluster around 1.5\u20132.5 Hz, but in observations ith a harder spectrum ( HR > 0.8) the rms amplitude of the QPO is ignificantly higher than in observations with a softer spectrum ( HR 0.8). The lowest rms values are found for QPO frequencies either 1 or 4 Hz, independently of whether the lags are either soft or ard (see Zhang et al. 2020 , for more details).\n.3 Time-averaged spectra\nn this section, we briefly describe the methods followed by  \u0301endez et al. ( 2022 ) to obtain, analyse, and fit the time-averaged pectra of the 398 observations considered in this paper. For each bservation in the sample, M \u0301endez et al. ( 2022 ) extracted deadime corrected energy spectra using the RXTE Standard 2 data. hey used PCABACKEST and PCARSP available in HEADAS V6.27 to xtract background spectra and produce response files, respectively, nd corrected the energy spectra for dead time. Using the model PHABS \u2217(DISKBB + GAUSS + NTHCOMP) in XSPEC V12.9 (Arnaud 996 ), M \u0301endez et al. ( 2022 ) performed a joint fit of the full set f energy spectra, linking the hydrogen column density, N H in the PHABS component to account for the interstellar absorption along he line of sight to the source, using the chemical abundances and ross-sections given by Wilms, Allen & McCray ( 2000 ) and Verner t al. ( 1996 ), respectively. Since N H \u2248 6 \u00d7 10 22 atoms cm 2 is quite igh in the direction of GRS 1915 + 105 , they also let free to vary he Fe abundance of this absorption component to account for an e absorption edge at E \u223c 7.1 keV that was apparent in the fitting esiduals. The DISKBB component stands for the emission from an eometrically thin and optically thick accretion disc (Shakura & unyaev 1973 ), with a temperature kT dbb at its inner radius.

In the fits, he authors assumed that the seed-photons source was the accretion isc, and thus linked the kT bb parameter to kT dbb , separately for each bservation. In this inverse-Compton model, the optical depth, \u03c4 , of he corona (assumed to be homogeneous) is a function of the electron emperature, kT e , and the power-law index, :\n( k T e , ) = \u221a 2 . 25 + 3 kT e\nm e c 2\n[ ( + 0 . 5) 2 \u2212 2 . 25 ], (2)\nhere m e is the rest mass of the electron and c is the speed of light. inally, the GAUSS component was used to represent a broad Fe mission line at \u223c6.4\u20137 keV, which arises due to reflection of corona hotons off the accretion disc (Fabian et al. 2009 ). By combining the data presented in the previous sections, in Fig. 2 ,\ne show the dependence of kT e (left-hand panel) and (right-hand\nanel) upon the HR and QPO frequency ( QPO \u2212 HR diagrams). emarkably, kT e shows a very smooth diagonal gradient in the iagram, with values spanning from low temperatures ( 5\u20137 keV, ed colour) at the bottom-left side of the plot to high temperatures 15\u201340 keV, blue colour) at the top right (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ).\noreo v er, the power-la w inde x of the Comptonization component, , also shows a smooth gradient in the QPO \u2212 HR diagram. Ho we ver, n this case the gradient is vertical, being strictly dominated by the R and quite independent of the QPO frequenc y.

The ain idea is that the observed energy spectrum at the QPO frequency, oth its energy dependent variability amplitude (the fractional rms) nd phase lags, arises due to the coupled oscillations of the physical roperties of the system, such as the temperature of the corona and he temperature of the source of seed photons. Hence, by fitting the pectral-timing properties of the QPO, the model provides physical roperties of the corona that are otherwise not directly accessible hrough fits to the full time-averaged spectrum. This model does not xplain the dynamical origin of the QPO, and assumes that the QPO requency can be produced by any of the models previously proposed or that (see e.g. Ingram et al. 2009 ).\nThe model of Karpouzas et al. ( 2020 ) considers a spherical lackbody with temperature kT s as the source of seed photons, which s enshrouded by corona of hot electrons with temperature kT e ; the orona is a spherically symmetric shell of size, L , with constant ensity and optical depth, \u03c4 . Feedback on to the soft-photon source f up-scattered photons in the corona is also incorporated in the odel, and controlled by the so-called feedback-fraction parameter, \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1, which is defined as the fraction of the flux of the eed-photon source, which arises after the feedback process. In the nverse-Compton process, the soft photons from the seed source gain nergy from the hot electrons in the corona. When the electrons give nergy to the photons, in turn, they cool down. Notwithstanding, strophysical coronas are long-lived, and thus there must be a source hat provides energy to the corona at a rate H ext , the external heating ate, that keeps the corona in thermal equilibrium.\nThe steady state of the model, which is also the expected timeveraged spectrum, coincides with the NTHCOMP model and is the umerical solution of the stationary Kompaneets equation (Komaneets 1957 ). In order to obtain the variability in the QPO, the odel numerically solves a linearized version of the time-dependent ompaneets equation, assuming that kT e , kT s , and H ext undergo scillations with small relative amplitudes \u03b4kT e , \u03b4kT s , and \u03b4H ext , espectiv ely, at the QPO frequenc y. Those oscillations reflect into omplex variability amplitudes of the spectrum that can be compared o the energy-dependent fractional rms amplitude and phase lags at he QPO frequency.\nIn this model, the feedback parameter, \u03b7, has a strong impact n the sign of the slope of the lag spectrum. On the one hand, omptonization naturally produces hard or positive lags (Miyamoto t al. 1988 ) as, on average, photons need more interactions, and hus longer times inside the corona, to reach higher energies. On he other hand, if a significant portion of the Comptonized photons mpinge back on to the soft-photon source ( \u03b7 0), the process leads o soft or ne gativ e lags (Lee et al. 2001 ). In the same way, in the omptonization model, increasing both L or \u03c4 leads to increasing lopes in the lag-energy spectra (either for positive or ne gativ e lags), ince photons experience more scatterings before leaving the electron loud. In turn, \u03b4H ext has no effect on the shape of variability spectrum either lags or rms). This parameter acts as a normalization of the ractional rms spectrum: the larger \u03b4H ext , the larger the fractional ariability amplitude.\nKarpouzas et al. ( 2020 ) demonstrated that the model can successully fit the energy-dependent fractional-rms amplitude and time lags f the lower kilohertz QPO of the neutron-star LMXB 4U 1636\u2013 3. Recently, Garc \u0301\u0131a et al. ( 2021 ) used this model to successfully xplain the spectral-timing properties of the LF Type-B QPO in\nNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\nAXI J1348\u2013630 . Furthermore, using a limited sample of nine bservations, Karpouzas et al. ( 2021 ) showed that the model can lso explain the spectral-timing properties of the Type-C QPO in RS 1915 + 105 . In this paper, we apply the same model to fit he full set of 398 observations previously described. For this, we ncorporate information gathered from the time-averaged spectra by xing the kT e and parameters of the spectral-timing model to he best-fitting values of the time-averaged energy spectrum of each bservation, best-fitting with an NTHCOMP model as explained above n Section 2.3 . We opt not to take the kT s from the time-averaged data, iven that the soft-photon spectrum in our spectral-timing model is ased on a blackbody spectrum, while the time-averaged spectra ere fitted using a multicolour disc blackbody model. By doing his, we end up with four free physical parameters to fit to the QPO ariability, namely the temperature of the soft-photon source, kT s , he corona size, L , the feedback fraction, \u03b7, and the amplitude of the xternal heating rate, \u03b4H ext . We also fit an additive constant to the hase-lag spectra to take into account the reference-lag angle (which s physically meaningless).\nFor each observation, we simultaneously fit the lag spectrum in he full \u223c2\u201341 keV energy range and the fractional-rms spectrum p to \u223c20 keV. We discard the highest-energy channel of the rms pectrum, as the spectral-timing model systematically predicts larger ms amplitudes than observed, most likely due to the absence of a eflection component in the model (for more details, we refer to the odel paper, Karpouzas et al. 2020 ). In all the paper, we will assume hat the seed-photon source is a sphere with a radius of 250 km, onsistent with the typical inner radius of the accretion disc at \u223c2 Hz or a \u223c12 M BH like the one in GRS 1915 + 105 (Reid et al. 2014 ), onsidering the LTP frequency. We note that the shape of the model s rather insensitive to this parameter (see Appendix A ), varying by factor 1.05 within the range set by the estimated inner radius of he accretion disc ( 50 km, M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ) and the maximum TP radius, corresponding to the minimum QPO frequency observed 500 km).\nIn order to fit such a large data set consisting of 398 observations, nd considering the relatively low speed of the fitting process due to he numerical characteristics of the model, which involve non-trivial\natrix inversions, we create a set of 17 multidimensional grids of re-calculated models ( table models ), for 10 QPO frequencies in the .25\u20132.5 Hz range and 7 in the 3.0\u20136.0 Hz range. We construct each f these table models using either uniform or logarithmic grids for ach free physical parameter, co v ering the range of values indicated n Table 1 . Those values were chosen guided by both the best-fitting ime-averaged spectral parameters from M \u0301endez et al. ( 2022 ) and hose from the spectral-timing analysis of Karpouzas et al. ( 2021 ). he resulting table models consist of 315 000 rows of 144 logarithmic nergy bands co v ering the \u223c0.5\u201350 keV energy range. Once the able models are created, for each observation, we take the closestn-frequency table model available and we load it into XSPEC to imultaneously fit the fractional rms and phase lags. We first explore\nThe evolving corona of GRS 1915 + 105 4201\nFigur e 3.

The lag- and rms-energy spectra are well-fitted by the spectral-timing Comptonization model, in the \u223c2\u201340 and \u223c2\u201320 keV energy ranges, respectively.\nt fi t X t P S e c b 1\n3\nT a a i I p i w o o q t u a i r\ns p o c d ( e\nd q i v t s\nd r r w p\n4\nI l 6 t Q h a t p b b l W s o l m t m T A\n4\nI f a G f f i a B F w l r\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/3/4196/6584857 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024 he full-table model using the STEPPAR function to compute the besttting model at each row of the table. Once we identify the row of he table that minimizes the residuals of the fit, we run the FIT task of SPEC to find a minimum interpolating within the table model. Once his minimum is found, we load the full spectral-timing model into YXSPEC and we use FIT task again to find a more refined minimum. ince this model e v aluation is quite slo w, calculating error bars for ach parameter for each observation using either the ERROR or CHAIN ommands in XSPEC is not computationally feasible. Hence, finally, ased on this minimum, we use again the table model to calculate the \u03c3 (68 per cent) confidence range of each parameter of the model. .1 Model limitations and caveats he model has limitations and caveats that have to be taken into ccount to a v oid o v er-interpretation of the results inferred from its pplication, and to understand how the model can be extended and mpro v ed, based on the results that will be shown in this paper. n particular, the assumed spherically symmetric blackbody softhoton source is a rough approximation for a spectrum originated n an accretion disc. Furthermore, a spherically symmetric corona ith constant optical depth is likely not an accurate representation f the Comptonizing region in these sources, which could consist f a non-spherical corona and a relativistic jet. None the less, the uantities inferred by fitting our spectral-timing model to the data of he Type-C QPO can be thought as characteristic v alues that allo w s to constrain physical properties of the system that are not directly ccessible through the time-averaged spectra. This way, we can also dentify the weaknesses of the model, which will help to pave the oad to a more realistic model. Future impro v ements of the model will include a disc-blackbody pectrum for the soft-photon source (Bellavita et al. 2022, in reparation), as well as a more realistic corona considering gradients f density, temperature, and optical depth. For instance, a more omplex geometry of the corona could account for the possible the ependence of the rms amplitude and lags upon source inclination Heil, Uttley & Klein-Wolt 2015 ; Motta et al. 2015 ; van den Eijnden t al. 2017 ).\nThe model is based on the solution of the linearized timeependent Kompaneets equation for Comptonization, and thus reuires that the amplitudes of the oscillations of the temperatures nvolved ( \u03b4kT s and \u03b4kT e ) being relatively small to ensure the alidity of the perturbative approach. The inferred amplitudes of he oscillating temperatures of the 398 best-fitting observations are hown in detail in Appendix A . We demonstrate that for this particular\nata set, \u03b4kT e and \u03b4kT s remain below 9 per cent and 5 per cent, espectively . On the contrary , the amplitude of the external heating ate, \u03b4H ext , can be larger than 100 per cent, but if a larger emitting area ould be considered for the soft-photon source, those values could in rinciple decrease (for a more detailed discussion, see Appendix A ).\nRESULTS\nn Fig. 3 we show three examples of the spectral-timing fits. In the eft-hand panels, we show the results for the QPO in observation 0701-01-26-00, with a \u03bd = 0.819 Hz, which shows hard lags; in he middle panels, we show observation 30182-01-01-00, with a PO at \u03bd = 2.145 Hz, with flat (nearly zero) lags; and in the rightand panels, we show observation 50703-01-24-01 with a QPO t \u03bd = 4.09 Hz, with a soft lag spectrum. In all three cases, the op and bottom panels sho w, respecti vely, the energy-dependent hase-lag and fractional rms amplitude spectra. Horizontal error ars correspond to the energy-channel widths and vertical error ars to 1 \u03c3 (68 per cent) uncertainties in the underlying data. Solid ines in these plots represent the best-fitting spectral-timing model.\ne notice that, while the shape of the phase-lag spectra changes ignificantly between the three panels, showing either positive, flat, r ne gativ e slopes, the rms-amplitude energy spectra are more or ess similar, and al w ays show an increasing rms with energy. The odel can fit both rms- and lag-energy spectra simultaneously, with he differences in the slope of the lag-energy spectra being driven ainly by the feedback fraction, as we explain in more detail below. he residuals of the 398 best-fitting models are presented in detail in ppendix B .\n.1 Dependence on feedback fraction\nn the left-hand panel of Fig. 4 , we show the best-fitting values to the eedback fraction parameter, \u03b7, and their corresponding 1 \u03c3 error bars s a function of the QPO frequency for the full data set (grey colours). lobally, the feedback fraction clearly shows two different cluster amilies: ( a ) for \u03bd 1 . 8 Hz, the feedback is low ( \u03b7 < 0.2\u20130.3); b ) or \u03bd 2 . 5 Hz, the feedback is high ( \u03b7 > 0.7\u20130.8), and shows an ncreasing trend as \u03bdQPO increases; ( c ) for \u03bd \u223c 1.8\u20132.5 Hz, there is transition from one regime to the other, and both clusters coexist. y comparing with the behaviour of the lags (see left-hand panel of ig. 1 ), we find that regime (a) corresponds to the QPO frequencies here the lags are hard, and (b) corresponds to the regime where the ags are soft. Meanwhile, flat or zero lags are found in the intermediate egime (c) , where the feedback can be either low or high. Given the\nMNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\n4202 F.

We roduce two sets of binned data points: (i) points with \u03b7 < 0.7 (red olour, and consistent with regime (a) ), (ii) points with \u03b7 > 0.7 (blue olour, consistent with regime (b) ).

A first indication of this trend was presented in arpouzas et al. ( 2021 ) using nine observations. Based on the full set f 398 observ ations av ailable in the RXTE archi v e, we reco v er that his behaviour persists on average, but we also find that regimes (a) nd (b) coexist in the 2\u20133 Hz intermediate frequency range, a result hat was hard to achieve with the sub-sample of nine observations nalysed there.\nNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\nf\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 4 , we use coloured points to epresent the values of \u03b7 in a QPO \u2212 HR diagram. Here, it is pparent that the transition from low to high \u03b7 fractions at \u223c2 Hz s independent of the HR state of the source, and occurs at the QPO requency at which the lags turn from hard to soft (see left-hand anel of Fig. 1 ). Despite the uncertainties principally present around \u20133 Hz, where the error bars in \u03b7 are the largest, a monotonic relation etween \u03b7 and \u03bdQPO can be readily seen in this plot. In particular, he largest ( \u03b7 \u2248 1) values tend to appear mainly at the highest QPO requencies, at the bottom-right corner of the plot.\n.2 The corona size behaviour\nn the left-hand panel of Fig. 5 , we show the best-fitting values to he corona size, L in km, and their corresponding 1 \u03c3 error bars, as a unction of QPO frequency, for each of the 398 observations consid-\nThe evolving corona of GRS 1915 + 105 4203\nFigure 6.

To give the reader an idea of the dimensions associated to L in hysical units, we also plot a black-dashed line on top corresponding o the LTP radius for each QPO frequency (considering a \u223c12 M H, like GRS 1915 + 105 ), which is usually associated to the inner dge of the accretion disc, r t (Ingram et al. 2009 ). In the 0.5\u20136.5 Hz ange, the LTP radius spans from 350 km ( \u223c20 R g ) down to 150 km \u223c8 R g ). Focusing on the points corresponding to the best-fitting izes, at low frequencies ( \u03bd 2 Hz) L rapidly decreases as the QPO requency increases, going from 10 000 km when \u03bd 0 . 5 Hz, to 1000 km for \u03bd 2 Hz. In the 2\u20133 Hz range, the corona reaches inima sizes, becoming compatible at the 1 \u03c3 level with the minimum ize explored in the table models (100 km). From this point onwards, he pattern is reversed, at high frequencies ( \u03bd 3 Hz), L has more or ess constant values spanning from \u223c500 to 2000 km with a tendency o increase as the QPO frequency increases. Moreover, by colouring hese points based on the electron temperature in the corona, taken rom the time-averaged spectra, a hint for tw o f amilies of L values an be seen in the data in this latter frequency regime.\nTo test this possibility, we calculate the weighted-average of he data in frequency bins of 0.25 Hz, considering two different ubsets according to their kT e values, arbitrarily chosen either below 0 keV (red colour) or abo v e (blue colour). Two clear monotonic, ut separate, trends are apparent: while at \u03bd 2 Hz the corona size ncreases as QPO frequency increases, consistent with the results of arpouzas et al. ( 2021 ), we find that the size is systematically larger hen the corona is hot ( > 10 keV) than when it is cool ( < 10 keV). his becomes more evident on the right-hand panel of Fig. 5 . Here, e colour the points of the QPO \u2212 HR diagram according to the est-fitting value of the corona size. An almost horizontal gradient s apparent, showing the dependence of L with the QPO frequency escribed abo v e. Ho we ver, another more subtle relation arises in his plot. When \u03bd 3 Hz, L is systematically larger on the top-right and of points (greenish empty diamonds, kT e > 10 keV) than in he bottom band points (bro wn-yello w solid circles, kT e < 10 keV). hose points have significantly different kT e values (see left-hand anel of Fig. 2 ), and thus, the two families of L values on that egime can be explained by different thermodynamic conditions of he corona at the same QPO frequency: the higher kT e , the larger L .\n.3 The soft-photon source temperature\nn the left-hand panel of Fig. 6 , we show the best-fitting values btained for the soft-photon source temperature ( kT s , grey points) and heir 1 \u03c3 uncertainties. The values of kT s separate into two different egimes, according to the QPO frequency. For \u03bd0 2 . 5 Hz, we find elatively large kT s values, 0.7 < kT s < 2 keV, whereas for \u03bd0 . 8 Hz, we obtain low temperatures, kT s < 0.2 keV, even compatible ith the minimum values explored with our table models ( kT s = .03 keV). As in the case of the feedback fraction in Section 4.1 , in he 1.8\u20132.5 Hz frequency range, kT s can be either in the low- or highemperature regime, or even with values in between. Following what e did for the feedback fraction, we also calculate the weightedverage of the kT s values in frequency bins of 0.25 Hz. For this, e consider observations with kT s values either higher (blue points) r lower (red points) than 0.5 keV. For frequencies \u03bd0 2 . 5 Hz, he temperature tends to increase with QPO frequency (notice that he y -axis in the plot is in logarithmic scale), which is expected if his temperature traces the temperature of the innermost regions of he accretion disc, and the QPO frequency itself corresponds to the TP frequency at the inner-edge of the accretion disc. This trend reaks below \u223c1.8 Hz, where a transition to a low-temperature softhoton source occurs. This transition becomes more evident when he temperature of the disc blackbody component, kT dbb , fitted to the ime-averaged spectra is also considered (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ).\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 6 , we show the comparison between he two soft-photon source temperatures fitted to each observation sing the two different data available. Grey points (as in the left-hand anel) correspond to the temperature of the blackbody-like source tted using the spectral-timing data of the QPO ( kT s ), while coloured iamonds are used for the temperature of the disc blackbody fitted sing the time-averaged spectra ( kT dbb ).

The missing coloured points orrespond to observations where only an upper limit on the disc lackbody component could be given from the fits to the timeveraged spectra, as this component was not significantly present\nMNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\n4204 F.

In those observations, the best-fitting model is simply BABS \u2217(NTHCOMP + GAUSSIAN) , in XSPEC notation (we refer the eader to M \u0301endez et al. 2022 , for more details).\nWe remind here that in order to fit the spectral-timing data f the QPO we hav e fix ed both kT e and to the values fitted o the Comptonization component in the time-averaged spectra. ince the best-fitting soft-photon temperatures found in this work re compatible with those found by fitting the time-averaged data sing the NTHCOMP model, which coincides with the steady-state olution of our variable-Comptonization model (see Section 3 ), this eans that the predicted time-averaged spectra associated to our omptonization model are also consistent with the observed ones.\nDISCUSSION\ne have successfully applied our spectral-timing model for Componization to the Type-C QPO data of GRS 1915 + 105 available n the full RXTE archive, consisting of 398 observations performed ith the PCA camera. By combining the energy-dependent phaseag spectra of the QPO presented in Zhang et al. ( 2020 ), with ur own measurements of the fractional-rms spectra (presented in ection 2.1 ), together with information gathered from the timeveraged spectra (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ), we are able to constrain hysical and geometrical properties of the corona, like the feedback raction, \u03b7, and its characteristic size, L , which are not directly ccessible through the frequently used time-averaged spectra. Based n this data set, we analyse the dependence of the corona properties n both the QPO frequency and the spectral state of the source, given y the HR, as well as their mutual interconnections. We identify solid rends in the evolution of the feedback fraction, corona size, and emperature of the Comptonized soft-photon source, which persist uring the full-time span by the RXTE mission in space, of about 5 yr. This allow us to construct a global picture of the disc\u2013corona nteraction and their links with the jet-launching mechanism that we ill discuss hereafter. The outstanding dependence of the slope of the lag-energy spectra\nith QPO frequency (Zhang et al. 2020 ) can be interpreted in the ontext of our spectral-timing Comptonization model by tw o f amilies r clusters of solutions. One having a large feedback fraction ( \u03b7 > .8) and high soft-photon source temperatures ( kT s \u223c 0.8\u20131.5 keV), hen \u03bd0 > 2.5 Hz, and ne gativ e or soft lags; and the other having low eedback fraction ( \u03b7 < 0.5) and low soft-photon source temperatures kT s < 0.2 keV), when \u03bd0 < 1.8 Hz and positive or hard lags. Each f these clusters show a smooth trend, with increasing \u03b7 and kT s as 0 increases. Furthermore, in the \u223c1.8\u20132.5 Hz range, where the lags re approximately flat or zero, we find that both clusters of solutions oexist, and a sharp transition between both states is reco v ered. When he dependence on HR is explored, no clear trend is found for any of hese two properties.\nRemarkably, the relation of kT s with QPO frequency is also ndependently supported by the time-averaged spectra. As shown n the right-hand panel of Fig. 6 , while observations with high kT s lso show a significant DISKBB component in the time-averaged pectrum, with systematically increasing kT dbb and disc flux, with ncreasing \u03bd0 , this is not the case when \u03bd0 2 Hz. In this latter egime, only a few (six) observations show a significantly detected ISKBB component, while in the vast majority the continuum is fitted olely with an NTHCOMP component (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ). Moreo v er, he connection between the feedback fraction and soft-photon source emperature is expected in our model, given that if a large fraction of hotons impinge back on to the soft source, the source will be heat-up nd thus experience a higher kT s temperature, and vice versa .\nNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\nThe corona size behaviour is more complex and rich. For QPO requencies \u03bd0 2 Hz, the size of the corona consistently shrinks rom L 10 4 km ( \u223c500 R g ) to L \u223c 200\u2013500 km ( \u223c10\u201325 R g ) as 0 increases from \u223c0.5 to 2 Hz. From this frequency onwards, the orona consistently expands again to sizes of \u223c1000\u20132000 km (50\u2013 00 R g ) when the QPO frequency reaches its maximum observed alues \u223c6 Hz. In this regime, the L \u2212 \u03bd0 evolution shows a uch broader relation, with different corona sizes coexisting at he same QPO frequency. When the corona temperature, kT e , is aken into account, the breath of this relation can be explained as connection between the thermodynamic properties of the corona nd its geometry. At the same QPO frequency, systematically larger orona sizes are found for higher kT e values (see Fig. 5 ).\nWhile in the variable-Comptonization model, the feedback has he largest impact upon the sign of the slope of the lag spectrum either positive or hard, for very low \u03b7, or negative or soft for high ), the magnitude of the slope of the lags is driven by the corona ize: i.e. for the same constant optical depth, in a larger corona hotons are up-scattered more times than in a smaller one. For his reason, for a very small corona ( L of a few gravitational radii) at (or zero) lags are e xpected. Thus, giv en the strong connection etween the QPO frequency and the magnitude of the phase-lags in RS 1915 + 105 (Zhang et al. 2020 ), the appearance of trends like hose found for the dependence of the corona size with the QPO requency are naturally expected. Moreover, the dependence of these rends on the temperature of the corona kT e , can also be understood ased on the mathematical relationship expressed by equation ( 2 ) etween kT e , the spectral index, , and the optical depth, \u03c4 .\nAssuming that the QPO frequency traces the LTP radius of the nner edge, r t , of the accretion disc (Ingram et al. 2009 ), the large eedback experienced by the source when \u03bd0 > 2.5 Hz, can be xplained by a corona that fully enshrouds the inner regions of the ccretion disc with sizes L > > r i . Remarkably, for frequencies \u03bd\n2 Hz, the corona shrinks to minima sizes L \u223c r t , leading to flat ags that can be fitted by either large or small \u03b7 values, and high or o w kT s temperatures, respecti vely. We interpret this as the crossing etween the corona size and the inner radius of the disc, which urns from a strong feedback process to a very inefficient one, when he corona becomes smaller than the inner edge of the disc. As the PO frequenc y decreases ev en further ( \u03bd0 < 1.8 Hz) two important hanges occur: the corona becomes cooler kT e \u223c 5\u20138 keV and the L \u03bd0 relation reverses, but keeping the feedback fraction low. This ould be explained by a change in the geometry, in which the corona ecomes extended perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disc, n a jet-like manner, a v oiding the formation of a strong feedback rocess, and thus leading to positive lags. Based on the full data set of RXTE X-ray observations containing\nsignificant Type-C QPO in their PDS, we collected and crossatched pointed radio observations performed by the Ryle telescope\nt 15 GHz (Pooley & Fender 1997 ) within 2 d of the corresponding Xay observations (leading to a total sample of 398 data points). The adio measurements span from very low values, or non-detections with flux-density levels 5\u201310 mJy) to very significant detections n the range of 10\u2013250 mJy (with average uncertainties of \u00b11\u2013 mJy). In the main panel of Fig. 7 , we show the radio flux density orresponding to each of the 398 observations as a function of QPO requency. The points are coloured according to the temperature of he soft-photon source fitted to with the spectral-timing model, kT s . ed (blue) coloured points correspond to kT s < 0.5 keV ( kT s > .5 keV). On the top and right-hand panels, we show the normalized arginal distributions of QPO frequencies and radio flux density alues for each subset, respectively.\nThe evolving corona of GRS 1915 + 105 4205\nFigure 7.

In the same figure, a correlation between the PO frequency and the temperature of the soft-photon source is also vident. For each X-ray observation, where the temperature of the oft-photon source is low ( kT s < 0.5 keV, red colour), the source is ignificantly detected in radio with flux densities in the 65 + 54 \u221238 mJy ange (1 \u03c3 ). Meanwhile, in observations for which the temperature is igh ( kT s > 0.5 keV, blue colour), the radio fluxes are significantly ower, spanning in the 18 + 44 \u221215 mJy range (1 \u03c3 ), with a significant raction of the observations being consistent with non-detections see right-hand panel). A Kolmogoro v\u2013Smirno v test between the wo samples of radio measurements throws a probability of \u223c10 \u221216 , eaning that the null hypothesis that the two samples come from he same underlying distribution can be rejected with > 8 \u03c3 . Such orrelation was firstly suggested by Trudolyubov ( 2001 ) and later by an et al. ( 2013 ), using a much smaller data set of RXTE observations, hich we have here extended to the full RXTE archive. In addition,\nhe separation of these two populations in terms of QPO frequency s very clear: points with kT s < 0.5 keV (red colour) and kT s > .5 keV (blue colour) accommodate either below or abo v e \u22482 Hz, espectively (see top panel).\nWe finally argue that a possible change in the actual source of oft photons when \u03bd0 < 2 Hz can not be discarded. Given that he disc-blackbody component becomes insignificant in the timeverage spectra; the low kT s temperatures inferred from our spectraliming Comptonization model; the v ery-long positiv e lags, which ead to large inferred corona sizes; and the consistent appearance f significant radio detections associated to synchrotron emission in\nhe compact jet, this could mean that the dominating source of soft hotons for Comptonization in X-rays could become the synchrotron hotons of the radio jet, in the so-called synchrotron self-Compton adiative process (Malzac & Belmont 2009 ; Poutanen & Vurm 2009 ). n this case, the corona, i.e. the Comptonizing region, would become he base of the jet, as proposed by Fender et al. ( 1999 ) and discussed n more detail in Markof f, No wak & Wilms ( 2005 ). The possibility hat the Comptonizing cloud is ef fecti vely ejected as a jet giving lace to a radio flare has been suggested by Vadawale et al. ( 2003 ), odriguez, Corbel & Tomsick ( 2003 ), and Fender, Belloni & Gallo 2004 ). Results from 15 yr of simultaneous X-ray observations with XTE and radio-monitoring with the Ryle telescope provide very trong evidence of a direct coupling between the X-ray corona and he radio jet (M \u0301endez et al. 2022 ) in GRS 1915 + 105 .\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee for insightful comments that helped us impro v e his paper.

This parameter has a dependence with the assumed ize of the soft-photon source. In their paper, Karpouzas et al.

In this paper, we assumed a larger value, qual to the typical inner radius of the accretion disc ( \u223c250 km at 0 = 2 Hz, for a 12 M BH in the LTP model). Considering a larger mitting area could, in principle, decrease those values, but a full ew set of table models would be required.

In order to verify if the solutions still remain consistent with he linearized regime assumed to calculate the solution of the ompaneets equation in the spectral-timing model (see Karpouzas t al. 2020 ), in Fig. A2 , we present the fractional amplitudes of he variability of both the electron temperature in the corona, \u03b4kT e , nd the temperature of the soft-photon source, \u03b4kT s , in percentage nits. As seen in the plot, both quantities remain below 10 per cent or every observation, which is in accordance with the linearized pproach used. In this figure, we colour the points according to the PO frequency to make evident the different regimes. In particular, t is remarkable that while \u03b4kT e is constrained to amplitudes of 1\u20139 per cent, \u03b4kT s spans for a much larger range, depending on he QPO frequency (and, hence, on the sign of the lags). For QPO requencies \u03bd 2 . 5 Hz, \u03b4kT s < 1 per cent, and, in particular, for 1 . 5 Hz, when the lags become hard and the temperature of the oft photon source becomes very low (and a disc blackbody in the ime-averaged spectra is only given as an upper-limit), the amplitude f the oscillation of the temperature of the soft-photon source ecomes very small ( \u03b4k T s 100 \u03b4k T e ), possibly indicating a change n the soft-photon source nature (see Discussion in Section 5 abo v e).

In particular, data are very-well tted in the 1.0\u20133.5 Hz frequency range (with \u03c72 /dof < 2) while ess accurate fits are found for observations with either lower or igher QPO frequencies. On the bottom panel, we show a histogram orresponding to the distribution of reduced \u03c7 -squared residuals btained from the best-fitting models of the full set of observations. he distribution spans from 0.1 to \u223c50, peaking in the 1\u20132 range, as xpected for good fits. his paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 513, 4196\u20134207 (2022)\n24"
