    "abstractText": "The 3\u2019 \u00e0 5\u2019 exonuclease TREX1 functions in vivo to degrade DNA and prevent chronic immune activation through the cGAS-STING pathway. TREX1 has been described as a nonprocessive enzyme with little preference for ssversus dsDNA, raising questions about its principle in vivo substrate. In addition, there has been minimal data rationalizing TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure. We used a combination of biochemical assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and robust kinetic modeling to determine TREX1\u2019s relative affinities for ssversus dsDNA substrates, to quantify its processivity, and to interrogate the possibility of inter-protomer communication within the TREX1 homodimer. Our findings indicate that TREX1 is a semiprocessive exonuclease with a predicted several orders of magnitude greater affinity for dsDNA than ssDNA. Furthermore, we find extensively correlated dynamics between TREX1\u2019s protomers that involve previously described and unrecognized substrate-adjacent regions of the TREX1 enzyme. We infer that TREX1 has evolved as a semi-processive exonuclease that likely degrades dsDNA in vivo, and we propose that its homodimer structure facilitates a mechanism for efficient binding and catabolism of nicked dsDNA. Overall, these studies identify potentially critical regions of the TREX1 enzyme not previously interrogated and contribute to a still-emerging model of TREX1 exonuclease activity.

TREX1 has been described as a nonprocessive enzyme with little preference for ss- versus dsDNA, raising questions about its principle in vivo substrate. In addition, there has been minimal data rationalizing TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure. We used a combination of biochemical assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and robust kinetic modeling to determine TREX1\u2019s relative affinities for ss- versus dsDNA substrates, to quantify its processivity, and to interrogate the possibility of inter-protomer communication within the TREX1 homodimer. Our findings indicate that TREX1 is a semiprocessive exonuclease with a predicted several orders of magnitude greater affinity for dsDNA than ssDNA. Furthermore, we find extensively correlated dynamics between TREX1\u2019s protomers that involve previously described and unrecognized substrate-adjacent regions of the TREX1 enzyme. We infer that TREX1 has evolved as a semi-processive exonuclease that likely degrades dsDNA in vivo, and we propose that its homodimer structure facilitates a mechanism for efficient binding and catabolism of nicked dsDNA. Overall, these studies identify potentially critical regions of the TREX1 enzyme not previously interrogated and contribute to a still-emerging model of TREX1 exonuclease activity."

            "text": "Three-prime Repair EXonuclease 1 (TREX1) is a 3\u2019 \u00e0 5\u2019 exonuclease1 that functions to degrade DNA and prevent aberrant DNA-sensing through the cGAS-STING pathway (reviewed in ref2), and TREX1 mutations are associated with a spectrum of autoimmune disorders (reviewed in ref3). While it\u2019s clear that TREX1 activity in hematopoietic cells is the deciding factor in whether or not discernable pathology occurs4,5, the source(s) of TREX1\u2019s pathogenically relevant biological substrate(s) remains an area of active investigation (ex. replication intermediates6, retroelements7, micronuclei8, enucleated erythroblast DNA9). Biochemical studies of TREX1 indicate robust exonuclease activity on single- (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA substrates (but not RNA or RNA-DNA duplexes)1,10\u201312, and suggest a preference for ss- over dsDNA10. Collectively, these findings perpetuate the hypothesis that TREX1\u2019s pathogenically relevant in vivo substrate is ssDNA. However, the nucleic acid sensor driving pathology in TREX1 mutants13\u201315, cGAS, has specificity for dsDNA16. Furthermore, the TREX1 p.D18N variant is dominant for aggressive autoimmune phenotypes in vivo3,17, but the recombinant TREX1D18N mutant enzymes only recapitulate this dominance in vitro on dsDNA (not ssDNA) substrates17\u201319. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo data make the contrary suggestion that dsDNA, not ssDNA, is the pathogenically relevant TREX1 substrate. Consequently, the question of TREX1\u2019s biochemical preference for ds- versus ssDNA remains highly relevant to its biological function. Similarly, TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure10,20\u201322 is likely relevant to its biological function, but this relationship is not fully understood. Obligate homodimerization is not a necessity for catalytic activity in many other exonucleases23,24, and this implies a function specific to TREX1\u2019s biological role. We have previously demonstrated that residues from one protomer communicate across TREX1\u2019s dimer interface and contribute to activity in the opposing protomer21,25. While these studies establish that TREX1\u2019s homodimer structure is critical for its exonuclease activity, they don\u2019t explain what biological or evolutionary imperative this serves. One model supported by existing studies21,25 is that the presence and/or conformation of substrate in one protomer can affect activity in the opposing protomer. Potential explanations for such inter-protomer communication might include inter-protomer regulation of catalysis and/or binding, or an in vivo substrate binding mechanism that requires simultaneous engagement of the active-sites. The former explanation is supported by reports about the exonuclease activities of TREX1D18N heterodimers17,19, which suggest the D18N heterodimer doesn\u2019t degrade dsDNA but degrades ssDNA at ~50% wild-type rate. While these collective data have provided an initial framework for understanding TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure, elucidating its deeper purpose requires more mechanistic interrogations. In this work we use a combination of biochemical and computational approaches to interrogate TREX1\u2019s preference for single- versus double-stranded DNA and the functional purpose(s) of its obligate homodimer structure. The relative biochemical affinities of TREX1 for ss- versus dsDNA are convincingly demonstrated, and residues contributing to differential binding are proposed. As part of these endeavors, a new robust kinetic model of TREX1 exonuclease activity is also developed and validated from biochemical data. Finally, we explain prior observations about the TREX1 D18N heterodimer\u2019s activity, and we further interrogate the phenomenon of inter-protomer communication in the TREX1 homodimer via molecular dynamics simulations."

However, we re-determined TREX1\u2019s classic kinetic constants for ss- and dsDNA substrates (Figure 1 and Table 1). For dsDNA, we developed a novel absorbance-based exonuclease assay. Briefly, recombinant human TREX11-242 enzyme (hT1) is incubated with a large, nicked plasmid substrate, then the reaction is terminated by addition of a small volume of concentrated ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and the excised deoxynucleoside monophosphates (dNMPs) are separated via a microcentrifugal filter unit. Finally, the concentration of the dNMPs is quantified via spectroscopy and used to calculate activity rate. The sensitivity range, dNMP standard curve, and degradation linearity were all determined for the assay (Figure 1A-B), then initial velocities of hT1 reactions were quantified over a range of substrate concentrations to generate a\nMichaelis-Menten curve (Figure 1C). These data indicated that kcat = 5.0 s-1 and Km = 10 nM. However, subsequent findings (see \u2018Competitive Inhibition\u2026\u2019 section in Results) suggest only one active-site of the hT1 homodimer can degrade this ~10-kb dsDNA plasmid at a time, which implies kcat \u2248 10 s-1 based on the number of TREX1 active-sites truly available for catalysis under such conditions. Overall, our determinations of TREX1\u2019s dsDNA kcat and Km are generally consistent with prior literature (Table 1 vs ref10). For ssDNA, we employed a reported26 gel-based assay to quantify hT1 exonuclease activities with high and low ssDNA concentrations (Figure 1D). The hT1 ssDNA kcat and Km were approximated from these activities and derived equations (Equations 7-8) using Monte-Carlo simulation. Interestingly, while the approximated kcat was in good agreement with the previous report, the approximated Km was about an order in magnitude greater (Table 1 vs ref10). Existing reports of TREX1\u2019s ssDNA activity rate ( !!\n[#\"] ) at a fixed substrate\nconcentration19,21,22,25,27 (1.4-6.3 s-1 at 50nM substrate) are more consistent with our kinetic constant values (Equation 1 predicts ~4.7 s-1 at 50nM substrate) than those previously published10 (Equation 1 predicts ~16 s-1 at 50nM substrate). Thus, our kinetic constant values for TREX1 suggest a preference for dsDNA over ssDNA, contrary to prior implications."

We also note that hT1 and mT1 displayed significantly different melting temperatures as apoenzymes (Figure 2), despite their respective TREX1-DNA complexes having comparable melting temperatures.

To better define the amino acid residues that may contribute to the differential TREX1 binding to ss- versus dsDNA, we performed all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with mT1 as apoenzyme, bound to 4-mer oligo, and bound to dsDNA. RMSD comparisons of mT1 against initial conditions shows that all simulations quickly equilibrate without indications of instability (Supplemental 1), and visualization of the conformational free energy maps for the mT1 backbone (C\u03b1) in each of these systems reveals stark contrast in the distribution of structural states, particularly between the two mT1-DNA complexes (Supplemental 2). RMSF analysis of the C\u03b1 in each system identified three areas of differential fluctuation in the mT1 backbone which have the potential for direct interaction with substrate in the active-site (Figure 3A). Notably, TREX1\u2019s flexible loop (aa. 164-175) seems differentially impacted by the two substrates, being significantly rigidified during dsDNA occupation of the active-site (Figure 3A \u2013 green markers). We also identified a short region (aa. 23-27) with the capacity to contact the 3\u2019-terminal nucleotides of each substrate, which is mildly rigidified during 4-mer occupation and further rigidified by dsDNA occupation (Figure 3A \u2013 purple markers). Finally, another uncharacterized region (aa. 75-88) was identified (Figure 4 \u2013 orange markers), and its rigidity appears unchanged by 4-mer occupation of the active-sites while occupation by dsDNA leads to modest rigidification. We also subjected residues\u2019 phi/psi angles across all simulations and systems to a clustering analysis. Pairwise statistical comparisons of each residue\u2019s conformation (cluster) proportions were made between the systems and adjusted for false discovery rate (Figure 3B). As expected, several residues\u2019 conformations were significantly altered upon both 4-mer and dsDNA occupation of the active-site (Figure 3B \u2013 blue markers). These included R174, L19, and aa. 191-193, which are all adjacent to the active-site with the potential for DNA interactions. Several residues\u2019 conformations were only altered by dsDNA occupation (Figure 3B \u2013 red markers), including S48, S194, and Q209. Of these, S194 is closest to the active-site, and adjacent to the H195 residue previously identified as a residue of interest in TREX1 crystal structures18,22 and patient data3. Curiously, there were several residues whose conformations were affected exclusively during 4-mer occupation of the active-site (Figure 3B \u2013 green markers), but only K175 is in any apparent proximity to the active-site."

            "text": "A classic kinetic model fails to account for several potential characteristics of TREX1 including: (1) degradation of a polymeric substrate where the relevant metric for substrate concentration (free 3\u2019-hydroxyls) remains constant between most catalytic events, and (2) non-distributive catalytic activity. We developed a kinetic model for TREX1 (Figure 4A) that addresses these shortcomings, incorporates the idea of processivity as a probabilistic adjustment to the catalytic rate constant, and can be expanded to describe competition between TREX1 variants (Figure 4B). Our model assumes length-independent catalytic rates and irreversible catalysis, which is generally consistent with TREX1 biochemistry1,10,11,29. Under our model, reactions are described by systems of nonlinear differential equations (Equations 16.1-17.8), and the number of nucleotides processively excised by TREX1 following DNA binding is described by a discrete probability density function (Equation 18). We used empirical data to approximate our model\u2019s kinetic constant values for hT1 exonuclease activity. Our model (Figure 4A) indicates that turnover rate (Equation 16.2) reduces to k2[ET] (classically30 Vmax) under saturating substrate conditions if enzyme-product complexing is negligible. Thus, the k2 (catalytic constant) parameters for both dsDNA and ssDNA have been empirically determined by our initial studies (Table 1). In addition, the previously reported31 ssDNA Kd value for TREX1 is applicable to our model with the classic30 relationship k%& = k&K' (Equation 19), but a value for TREX1\u2019s dsDNA Kd is unavailable. Using the constraint of Equation 19, our ssDNA exonuclease activity rates (Figure 1D, [S] = 15 nM), and numerical solutions of Equations 16.1-5, we approximated the k1 (on-rate constant) and k-1 (off-rate constant) values that best explained our observed activity rates for a range of \u03a8 (processivity constant) values (Supplemental 3). Then, we compared our empirical ssDNA degradation patterns (Figure 1D, [S] = 15 nM) to those predicted by the model solutions for each processivity constant value (Figure 5A), and we found \u03a8 \u2248 0.75, k-1 \u2248 2.2 s-1, and k1 \u2248 5.2x107 M-1s-1 best recapitulated our data (Table 2). Since TREX1\u2019s dsDNA Kd is unavailable, we used a reported26 fluorescence-based assay to perform competition experiments with hT1 and recombinant human TREX11-242D18N/D18N (hT1-DN) enzymes, then determined the on- and off-rate constant values that best matched our observations for a range of processivity constant values (Supplemental 4). hT1-DN can competitively inhibit wild-type enzyme on ds- but not ssDNA, despite having specifically abolished catalysis, implying this behavior is a manifestation of differing ss- versus dsDNA kinetic constant values19,25,26,31,32. To capture this hT1-DN biochemistry in our modeling, the hT1-DN kcat was set to zero and all other kinetic constants were constrained to wild-type values. We found that most processivity constant values had solutions for k1 and k-1 that could recapitulate our data, but for \u03a8 \u2265 0.90 there were no solutions that well recapitulated our data (Supplemental 4D-F). Under the additional assumption that \u03a8ds \u2265 \u03a8ss, consistent with TREX1\u2019s greater dsDNA binding stability demonstrated earlier, we infer for the TREX1-dsDNA interaction that 0.75 \u2264 \u03a8 \u2264 0.90, 0.020 \u2264 k-1 \u2264 0.10 s-1, and k1 \u2248 109 M-1s-1 (Table 2). However, kinetic constant solutions for \u03a8ds = 0 were similar (k1 = 5.0x109 M-1s-1, k-1 = 0.30 s-1), reinforcing that drastically different TREX1 kinetic constant values for ss- versus dsDNA are necessary to explain empirical data. Strikingly, our inferred TREX1 rate constants (Table 2) indicate dsDNA Kd \u2248 20-100 pM, versus ssDNA Kd \u2248 42 nM, consistent with our earlier empirical data (Figures 1-2). Finally, we used our inferred TREX1 rate constants (Table 2) to predict (via Equation 18) the number of nucleotides TREX1 is likely to processively excise on ss- versus dsDNA substrates (Figure 5B). Interestingly, our model predicts that TREX1 is unlikely to excise more than ~10 nucleotides processively from either substrate. Notably, while TREX1 processively excising \u22657 nucleotides seems more likely for ds- than ssDNA substrates, the absolute probability of such events is still low. Competitive Inhibition Between Wild-Type and D18N TREX1 Protomers: Early biochemical investigations into the exonuclease activities of TREX1D18N variants17,19,26,32 were consistent with a model where substrate binding by one protomer caused communication across the dimer interface to prevent catalysis in the opposing protomer. However, the dsDNA activity for the heterodimers was only tested under specific substrate conditions: sub-enzyme concentrations of a bulky, nicked plasmid. Thus, the D18N heterodimer inactivity could be alternatively attributed to substrate-mediated steric hindrance of additional binding in the second protomer\u2019s active-site, or to a sufficiently low dsDNA Kd allowing saturated substrate binding by the mutant protomers. We directly interrogated these alternative hypotheses by quantifying the hT1, hT1-DN, and recombinant human TREX11-242+/D18N (hT1-DNhet) enzymes\u2019 exonuclease activities at sub-enzyme concentrations of the original plasmid substrate (Figure 6A) and at saturating\nconcentrations of a 30-bp dsDNA (Figure 6B). We observed significantly greater exonuclease activities for hT1-DNhet and a 1:1 hT1:hT1-DN mix on the oligo versus plasmid dsDNA (Figure 6C), consistent with the original data being (at least partially) attributable to substrate-mediated steric hinderance of dual active-site occupation and/or saturated binding of substrate. However, it is curious to note that the heterodimer was ~2- fold less active on the oligo dsDNA than the 1:1 hT1:hT1-DN mix, despite these reactions having the same total concentrations of wild-type and D18N protomers. Thus, our results are reconcilable with some degree of catalytic and/or substrate binding suppression via communication across TREX1\u2019s dimer interface."

RMSD comparisons of mT1 against initial conditions shows that all simulations quickly equilibrate without indications of catastrophic instability (Supplemental 1), and visualization of the conformational free energy maps for the mT1 backbone (C\u03b1) in each of these systems reveals stark contrast in the distribution of structural states in each system\u2019s unbound protomer (Supplemental 5). An RMSF analysis revealed three distinct regions of the mT1 backbone that were rigidified by dsDNA occupation of the opposing protomer\u2019s active-site (Figure 7A). These include TREX1\u2019s flexible loop (aa. 164-175), whose corresponding region in the related TREX2 exonuclease has been previously implicated in DNA-binding33, and two previously unstudied regions surrounding the active-site (aa. 23-27 & 75-88). Curiously, these are the same regions impacted by DNA occupation in the resident protomer (Figure 3A). A phi/psi angle clustering analysis to identify conformationally altered residues echoed these findings, with most identified residues being located on TREX1\u2019s flexible loop (Figure 7B). As a more general interrogation of coordinated activity between TREX1 protomers, C\u03b1 correlation analyses were performed for mT1 and an mT1:4-mer complex (Figure 8). We found positively correlated dynamics between the protomers\u2019 \u03b15 helices (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 1) and between their \u03b23 strands (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 3), which prior reports suggest are key contributors to TREX1\u2019s dimeric stability18,21,22, and these correlations were independent of 4-mer presence in the active-sites. Interestingly, we also found inter-protomer dynamics correlations that were dependent on the presence of 4-mer in the active-sites. These included positively correlated dynamics between TREX1\u2019s flexible loop and \u03b16 helix (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 2) and between the flexible loop and aa. 79-93 (\u03b13-\u03b14) (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 4), as well as negatively correlated dynamics between aa. 79-93 (\u03b13-\u03b14) and TREX1\u2019s \u03b15 helix (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 2) and between aa. 79-93 (\u03b13-\u03b14) and aa. 22-31 (\u03b21-\u03b11-\u03b22) (Figure 8 \u2013 correlation 6).

The kinetic constant values derived under our robust model for TREX1 exonuclease activity (Table 2) also support this assertion, and place TREX1\u2019s dsDNA affinity at ~1000-fold higher than for ssDNA. It\u2019s notable that there is over an order in magnitude variation between the substrates\u2019 predicted on-rates, and that the predicted dsDNA on-rate, which is consistent with measurements of the classic kinetic constants (Table 1 and ref10), seems to strain theoretical diffusion limits34. This behavior may be explained if TREX1 is capable of \u2018scanning\u2019 nonspecifically along the DNA backbone to identify free 3\u2019-hydroxyls, which is a proposed capability of the highly related TREX2 enzyme33,35 and wasn\u2019t accounted for in our kinetic model of TREX1 exonuclease activity. If so, our use of a massive, nicked dsDNA species might have exaggerated TREX1\u2019s apparent on-rate via a predominantly 1-dimensional versus 3-dimensional search for free 3\u2019-hydroxyls, where diffusion-limited association with the DNA backbone occurs well before 3\u2019-hydroxyl binding and catalysis. Since we used a >300-fold shorter ssDNA species, its apparent on-rate would not be as inflated by this scanning behavior. Regardless, the dsDNA off-rate is still predicted at 20-100X lower than ssDNA, so a multiple order in\nmagnitude difference in affinity for ds- versus ssDNA is still expected for TREX1 when accounting for scanning-based bias. Our MD simulations (Figure 3) suggest that this discrepancy in apparent binding affinity is largely attributable to tighter interactions with TREX1\u2019s flexible loop, as well as interactions with two uncharacterized regions of the TREX1 structure: its \u03b11 (aa. 23-27) and \u03b13 (aa. 75-88) helices. Implication of the flexible loop corresponds well with prior literature, which demonstrates that mutation of these residues disproportionately reduces TREX1 exonuclease activity on ds- versus ssDNA19, and that the corresponding region in TREX2 contributes to DNA-binding33. Though this function hasn\u2019t been directly demonstrated for TREX1\u2019s flexible loop, the TREX1D18N variant enzymes\u2019 ability to competitively inhibit wild-type enzyme is significantly reduced upon co-mutation of the flexible loop residues19, suggesting it also serves a DNA-binding role in TREX1. It\u2019s fair to note, however, that our MD simulation substrates differed in length, not just strand number. Consequently, a length-dependent interaction of polynucleotides with TREX1\u2019s flexible loop could also produce these results, which would be consistent with flexible loop-mediated DNA backbone \u2018scanning\u2019 behavior for TREX1 (as proposed above). While the other two implicated TREX1 regions have not been functionally characterized in prior literature, their positions relative to TREX1\u2019s 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide binding pocket indicate probable relevance to exonuclease activity (Figure 3A \u2013 orange and purple areas). Thus, they are prime targets for future structure-function studies of TREX1. Overall, our interrogations of TREX1\u2019s ss- versus dsDNA binding provide insights into the likely nature of its biological substrate, and TREX1\u2019s role in degrading it. First, TREX1\u2019s dramatically higher affinity for dsversus ssDNA (Tables 1-2 and Figure 2) suggest that TREX1 has evolved to degrade a dsDNA species in vivo. It is tempting to posit that TREX1\u2019s comparable catalytic rate on, and admittedly still high affinity for, ssDNA suggests it (at least also) functions to degrade ssDNA in vivo, which may well be true. However, these observations could also be biophysical consequences of how TREX1 degrades a single strand of dsDNA species. Indeed, in existing crystal structures it is evident that the 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide, and the three subsequent nucleotides, of ss- versus dsDNA are positioned nearly identically for catalysis in the TREX1 active-site22,28, which would explain why the two substrates display similar catalytic constants. Similarly, TREX1\u2019s sequence-independent contacts with these four 3\u2019-terminal nucleotides and its flexible loop\u2019s proposed nonspecific interactions with the DNA backbone might necessarily contribute some affinity for ssDNA species. Thus, TREX1\u2019s relative affinity for ss- versus dsDNA seems the most appropriate biochemical metric for its substrate preferences. Next, the \u2018scanning\u2019 capabilities of TREX1 suggested by our kinetic model and prior TREX2 literature implicate a large biological substrate, where the benefits of a 1-dimensional search for free 3\u2019-hydroxyls are necessary to degrade insulting nucleic acid at sufficient rates to avoid immune stimulation. Finally, and perplexingly, the processivity predicted by our kinetic model (Figure 5B) suggests that TREX1\u2019s biological function only requires it to resect short stretches of the identified DNA strand before dissociating. These biochemical properties of TREX1 seem reminiscent of proofreading exonucleases (ex. ref36), but a canonical proofreading function is not consistent with the pathology of TREX1 mutants (reviewed in refs2,3). Finally, it\u2019s prudent to acknowledge that our biochemical substrates are unlikely to perfectly recapitulate TREX1\u2019s biological substrate(s), and thus the relevant in vivo kinetics could differ. Consequently, further interrogation is warranted to validate the biological significance of these biochemical properties."

            "text": "Early biochemical and structural studies of TREX1 established the interdependence of protomers in the TREX1 homodimer\u2019s exonuclease activity21,25, and later studies with the TREX1D18N dimeric variants17,19 spawned the hypothesis that DNA binding in one TREX1 protomer leads to catalytic suppression of the opposing protomer. We recapitulated these initial D18N experiments and expanded them to alternative substrate conditions (Figure 6), and our results are inconsistent with total catalytic suppression of the opposing protomer upon DNA binding. However, they are suggestive of some degree of inter-protomer negative regulation of catalysis and/or binding. Our MD analyses interrogating the effects of dsDNA binding on opposing protomer dynamics (Figure 7) support this conclusion as well, and mechanistically implicate the same regions impacted by DNA binding in the resident protomer (Figure 3): TREX1\u2019s flexible loop (aa. 164-175), \u03b11 helix (aa. 23-27), and \u03b13 helix (aa. 75-88). MD correlation analyses (Figure 8) further support this hypothesis and implicate these regions, suggesting that TREX1\u2019s flexible loop communicates across the dimer interface with \u03b13-\u03b14 (aa. 79-93) and with \u03b16, and that \u03b13-\u03b14 (aa. 79-93) communicates across the dimer interface with \u03b21\u03b11-\u03b22 (aa. 22-31). Collectively, these data are consistent with TREX1 possessing flexible loop-dependent negative cooperativity across its dimer interface. This is supported by analogous studies in TREX2 that\nsuggest its flexible loop is involved in binding cooperativity33,35, and by the \u03b16 and \u03b13-\u03b14 regions\u2019 direct contact with the 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide in existing crystal structures22,28. It seems reasonable in TREX1\u2019s case that, sequentially, the \u03b16 and/or \u03b13-\u03b14 regions are the \u2018sensors\u2019 of 3\u2019-terminal nucleotide binding and the flexible loop is the \u2018effector\u2019 of negative cooperativity, as opposed to the opposite trend. However, this cannot be definitively stated from these data alone. When paired with our substrate preference data, these findings support a model where TREX1\u2019s homodimer structure has evolved as part of a mechanism to efficiently locate free 3\u2019-hydroxyls on a large, nicked dsDNA substrate and degrade the nicked strand. Mechanistically, we propose that TREX1 is capable of \u2018scanning\u2019 along the dsDNA backbone of its biological substrate in search of free 3\u2019-hydroxyls, with each flexible loop positioned on the backbone of a respective strand. Upon one protomer\u2019s recognition of a 3\u2019- terminal nucleotide in its binding pocket by its \u03b16 and/or \u03b13-\u03b14 regions, the opposing protomer\u2019s flexible loop is forced to release the non-scissile strand. Then, the scissile strand can be positioned for efficient catalysis in the resident protomer\u2019s active-site. Under this model, TREX1\u2019s ultra-fast kinetics (Tables 1-2), its flexible loop\u2019s apparently disproportionate relevance to dsDNA exonuclease activity19, and the D18N heterodimer\u2019s behavior (Figure 6) are quite expected. This model is, of course, inferential by nature, and warrants rigorous and highly mechanistic future studies to validate it."

TREX1 is currently described as a nonprocessive enzyme with little preference for ss- versus dsDNA, ssDNA sources are proposed as relevant TREX1 in vivo substrates, and TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure is largely unexplained. Our studies demonstrate that TREX1 is predicted to have several orders of magnitude greater affinity for ds- than ssDNA. Furthermore, we find extensively correlated dynamics between TREX1 protomers involving previously described as well as uncharacterized regions of the TREX1 enzyme, all of which have the potential to directly interact with substrate in their resident protomers. We infer that TREX1\u2019s obligate homodimer structure is an evolutionary mechanism to efficiently scan for exposed 3\u2019-hydroxyls and facilitate rapid catabolism of a dsDNA biological substrate. Ultimately, these studies identify potentially critical regions of the TREX1 enzyme for future functional characterization, and they provide compelling evidence that the nature of TREX1\u2019s biological substrate should be critically reevaluated."

Wild-type protomers were expressed as a fusion protein using a pLM303x vector that encodes maltose-binding protein (MBP) linked N-terminally to TREX1. Mutant protomers were expressed as a fusion protein using a pCDF-Duet vector that encodes His-tagged NusA linked N-terminally to TREX1. Both constructs employed a linker with a rhinovirus 3C protease (PreScission Protease) recognition site and were transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta2(DE3) cells (Novagen) for overexpression. Homodimers were purified via amylose column chromatography followed by overnight protease cleavage, then phosphocellulose (p-cell) column chromatography. Heterodimers were purified via amylose column chromatography followed by nickel column chromatography, then overnight protease cleavage followed by phosphocellulose (p-cell) column chromatography. Amylose and nickel columns used one-step elution, and p-cell columns used a salt gradient for elution. All enzymes eluted from p-cell columns at a salt concentration of ~120 mM.

Fluorescence-Based dsDNA Exonuclease Assay:\nWe have published a detailed protocol26 for this assay, but we will summarize it here. 150 \u00b5L reactions\nwere prepared containing a variable concentration of hT1, 20 mM TRIS (pH 7.5 @ 25\u00b0C), 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5-10 ng/\u00b5L dsDNA substrate, and 200 ng/\u00b5L bovine serum albumin (BSA). For the \u2018[S]<KM\u2019 experiments, the dsDNA substrate was a ~10-kb Nt.BbvCI-nicked (NEB #R0632) pMYC plasmid used at 5 ng/\u00b5L (~0.83 nM), and the hT1 concentration was 15 nM. For the \u2018[S]>>KM\u2019 experiments, the dsDNA substrate was a self-annealing 30-mer oligo used at 1000 nM (~9 ng/\u00b5L), and the hT1 concentration was 2.5 nM. Reactions were initiated by addition of 10X enzyme diluted in 1 mg/mL BSA and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (~21\u00baC). 20 \u00b5L samples were taken at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60-minute time points and quenched in 20 \u00b5L of 15X SYBR Green dye (ThermoFisher #S7563). Quenched samples had their fluorescence measured on a PolarStar Omega microplate reader (BMG LabTech), using excitation/emission of 485/520 nm. For the 1:1:0 enzyme mixes, mix ratios indicate the prevalence of hT1+/+, hT1MUT/MUT, and hT1MUT/+, respectively, where total hT1 concentrations were still as indicated. 30-mer oligo sequence: 5\u2019- GCTCGAGTCA TGACGCGTCA TGACTCGAGC -3\u2019"

Standard exonuclease reactions were prepared with indicated concentrations of hT1, incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes, quenched in ethanol, then visualized on a 23% ureapolyacrylamide gel. Top bands indicate undegraded 30-mer oligonucleotide (\u201930-mer\u2019), which TREX1 degrades in single-nucleotide units to generate the laddered bands (other \u2018-mer\u2019). Densitometric quantification of these gels was used to calculate activity rates. Values provided at the bottom of each gel set are mean and standard deviation. Activity rates are calculated for each substrate concentration from 18 total reactions each via 6 replicates per 3 concentrations of hT1.

Further details are found in the relevant methods section. Barcode plots show residues with significantly different conformation proportions between systems, with the title indicating the systems compared. Residues with blue markers had their conformations significantly altered by the presence of 4-mer and dsDNA in the active-site. Green markers indicate residues whose conformations were only significantly altered by the presence of 4-mer in the active-site. Red markers indicate residues whose conformations were only significantly altered by the presence of dsDNA in the activesite. Analyses and graphing were performed in R v3.6.1.

A polyacrylamide gelbased TREX1 ssDNA degradation assay was performed as described in the relevant methods section, and the banding data quantified to give the concentration of product in the reaction. Product concentrations for all 6 replicate reactions are displayed (\u2018Observation\u2019). Any variability along the x-axis in the empirical data points between graphs is not indicative of a different data set but an artifact of R plotting code. The kinetic model for hTREX1 ssDNA exonuclease activity was optimized at several processivity parameter values (\u2018\u03a8\u2019) to determine the matching kinetic constant values (\u2018k_1\u2019, \u2018k_-1\u2019) that gave the best fit to the empirical data.

Standard exonuclease reactions were prepared with 15 nM hT1 (black data) or 15 nM of a 1:1 mix of hT1:hT1-DN (red data), incubated at room temperature for the indicated times, quenched in SYBR Green, and dsDNA content measured by fluorescence. Plots of fluorescence vs time were generated and normalized to maximum and minimum fluorescence. Data points on the graph correspond to these empirical data, and indicate means of 18 reactions per condition across three experiments. The parameters of the TREX1 dsDNA kinetic model were optimized to fit these empirical data for each of the processivity values listed in respective plot titles. Optimization was carried out by starting with the ssDNA k1 and k-1 values, increasing k1 until the predicted wild-type degradation rate (black lines) matched observation, then decreasing k-1 until the predicted level of enzyme competition (red lines) matched observation. Calculations and plotting were performed in R v3.6.1. Simulated reactions are defined in Supplemental 6. The black and red data points here are derived from the same data as the blue and purple data points in Figure 6A, respectively, after normalization to maximum and minimum fluorescence.\nSupplemental 5: Conformational Free Energy Maps of mTREX1 Backbone. Cartesian coordinates of every C\u03b1 in the unbound protomer (\u2018Protomer-B\u2019) of mT1 in every time frame in every simulation in both systems were used to calculate map density functions as described in the relevant methods section. Density functions were plotted as contour maps, with innermost rings indicating the areas of highest density for respective systems.
