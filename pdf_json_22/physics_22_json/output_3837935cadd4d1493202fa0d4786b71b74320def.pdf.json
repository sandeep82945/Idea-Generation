The presence of strain breaks the chiral selection rules at the K-points of the Brillouin zone and makes optical transitions linearly polarized. The orientation of the induced linear polarization is related to the main axes of the strain tensor. Elastic strain provides an additive contribution to the exciton fine structure splitting in agreement with experimental evidence obtained from uniaxially strained WSe2 monolayer. The applied strain also induces momentum-dependent Zeeman splitting. Depending on the strain orientation and magnitude, Dirac points with a linear dispersion can be formed in the exciton energy spectrum. We provide a symmetry analysis of the strain effects and develop a microscopic theory for all relevant strain-induced contributions to the exciton fine structure Hamiltonian.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nElastic deformations and strain strongly affect electronic, excitonic and optical properties of solids [1]. Deformation effects turn out to be especially important for two-dimensional (2D) materials where strain can be applied locally [2] providing significant tunability of the band parameters and optical response of semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers (TMDC MLs) [3, 4]. Such systems with MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 being their most prominent representatives are actively studied nowadays owing to their exceptional optical properties, intriguing fundamental physics, and wide\nprospects of applications [5\u20137]. Deformations can be used to control exciton transition energy and linewidths [8\u2013 15], scattering and diffusion [16]. Inhomogeneous strain allows one to confine [17, 18] and steer excitons owing to the funneling effect [19\u201324].\nIn atom-thin TMDCs bright excitons occupy two valleys K+ and K\u2212 and emit circularly polarized light. Valley-tagged excitons can be considered as a prototypical two-level system with the valley polarization and coherence being mapped to the exciton pseudospin1/2 [25, 26]. Valley orientation of excitons by circularly polarized light and formation of valley coherence under linearly polarized excitation [26\u201336] is among the most promising effects for applications of TMDC MLs\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n13 84\n7v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n3 0\nA ug\n2 02\n2\n2 in quantum technologies. Electron-hole exchange interaction mixes excitons in the K\u00b1 valleys and acts as an effective magnetic field \u2013 synthetic spin-orbit coupling \u2013 making it possible to manipulate valley polarization [25, 26, 37, 38] akin to the manipulation of electron spins via spin-orbit coupling. [39\u201344]. Electron-hole exchange interaction governs the fine structure of excitonic states [7, 45, 46] and also causes valley depolarization of excitons [25, 26, 37, 38, 47, 48] similarly to the spin depolarization of excitons in quantum wells [49\u201351].\nHere we demonstrate theoretically and confirm experimentally that the strain strongly affects the bright exciton fine structure in TMDC MLs. It breaks the three-fold rotational symmetry of a monolayer and gives rise to a splitting of a radiative doublet into the states linearly polarized along the main axes of the strain tensor. The strain results in overall linear polarization of the emission of 2D TMDC. We also predict a combined effect of the strain and exciton motion which leads to the linear-inwavevector splitting of the circularly polarized exciton states. We present symmetry analysis of the strain effects in Sec. II and microscopic mechanisms of the effects in Sec. III. An experimental demonstration of the interdependence of exciton energy shifts and fine structure splitting under strain is provided in Sec. IV. Section V contains the conclusion and outlook."

            "text": "We consider the fine structure of the radiative doublet of exciton states in the presence of strain in the 2D TMDC. Let u(r) be the local displacement vector of the atoms in the monolayer. For small deformations considered hereafter the strain tensor reads (i, j = x, y, z denote the Cartesian components)\nuij \u2261 1\n2 ( \u2202ui \u2202xj + \u2202uj \u2202xi ) = uji. (1)\nTo obtain an effective Hamiltonian of the exciton in the presence of strain, we use the method of invariants [1, 52]. We consider a class of TMDC monolayers with D3h point symmetry that includes MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2 and WSe2 as the most prominent examples, our analysis applies to all these systems. In the D3h point group of the monolayer the following strain tensor components correspond to the irreducible representations:\n1. A\u20321 (invariant): uzz; uxx + uyy.\n2. E\u2032: (2uxy, uxx \u2212 uyy,).\n3. E\u2032\u2032: (uxz, uyz).\nThe bright excitonic states \u2013 the radiative doublet \u2013 transform as the in-plane coordinates, i.e., according to the E\u2032 irreducible representation. Taking into account that E\u2032 \u2297 E\u2032 = A\u20321 + A\u20322 + E\u2032, we obtain the following expression for the effective Hamiltonian of the radiative doublet in the presence of strain:\nH = \u039e(uxx + uyy)I\u0302 + \u039e\u2032uzz I\u0302 + ~2K2\n2M I\u0302 + ~ 2 (\u03c3\u0302 \u00b7\u2126). (2)\nHere I\u0302 is the 2\u00d72 unit matrix, and the contributions with \u221d uxx +uyy and uzz describe the overal shift of the exciton energy, \u039e and \u039e\u2032 are the corresponding deformation potentials. These contributions are responsible for the exciton energy tuning by elastic strain [9\u201311], electronand exciton-acoustic phonon scattering [53\u201359], and exciton funneling [19, 20, 24]. The kinetic energy ~2K2/2M is presented disregading the strain with K = (Kx,Ky) being the two-dimensional exciton wavevector; generally, in the presence of strain the kinetic energy acquires the terms \u221d KiKjuij which describe the strain-induced renormalization of the effective mass and its anisotropy. The last term in Eq. (2) describes the exciton fine structure. Here \u03c3\u0302 = (\u03c3\u0302x, \u03c3\u0302y, \u03c3\u0302z) is the vector composed of the Pauli matrices describing the exciton pseudospin, with \u03c3\u0302z describing the splitting of exciton states in circular polarizations and \u03c3\u0302x, \u03c3\u0302y the splitting into the linearly polarized components [25, 51], and \u2126 is the effective magnetic field acting on the exciton pseudospin:\n\u2126x = A(K)(K2x \u2212K2y) + B(uxx \u2212 uyy), (3a) \u2126y = 2A(K)KxKy + 2Buxy, (3b) \u2126z = C[(uxx \u2212 uyy)Kx \u2212 2uxyKy]. (3c)\nNote that the exciton pseudospin Pauli matrices \u03c3\u0302x and \u03c3\u0302y are even at the time reversal, while the matrix \u03c3\u0302z is odd at the time-reversal.\nThe product A(K)K2 describes the longitudinaltransversal splitting of the excitonic states [25, 37, 38, 48, 60]. The parameter B describes the effect of strain, and the parameter C describes an effective magnetic field arising due to the exciton propagation in the presence of strain. The parameter C 6= 0 appears due to the lack of the inversion symmetry in the system. Here we use the same set of axes as in Ref. [61] where one of the three vertical reflection planes on D3h point group \u03c3v \u2016 (yz), see Fig. 1, and the components (Kx,Ky) transform as (2uxy, uxx \u2212 uyy).\nNote that the mixed components of the strain, uxz = uzx and uyz = uzy, mix spin-forbidden dark (also called gray) z-polarized exciton [45] with the in-plane polarized optically active states. Such effects are beyond the scope of the present work.\n3"

            "text": "The strain breaks the three-fold rotation symmetry of the 2D TMDC, see Fig. 1. In the absence of strain the axes x and y are equivalent from the viewpoint of linear optics and the eigenpolarizations can be selected to be circular, \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212, Fig. 1(a). In the presence of strain, the in-plane axes of the structure are no longer equivalent, Fig. 1(b), and the eigenpolarizations are linear ones along the main axes of the strain. The eigenstates of the exciton at rest (K = 0) are linearly polarized along the main axes of the strain tensor x\u2032 and y\u2032, and the splitting is given by ~B(ux\u2032x\u2032 \u2212 uy\u2032y\u2032). Note that in the main axes the off-diagonal components of the strain tensor are absent, ux\u2032y\u2032 = uy\u2032x\u2032 \u2261 0; in Fig. 1(b) the main axes are x and y (generally the main axes x\u2032 and y\u2032 do not have to match x and y axes of the lattice in Fig. 1). The splitting is linear in the strain for small deformations.\nThe pseudomagnetic field \u2126 as function of the wavevector K is schematically shown in Fig. 2. Three panels show the case without strain (a) and with strain of opposite sign (b,c): Here we took\nuxy = 0, and uxx \u2212 uyy 6= 0. (4)\nIn the case (a), no strain is present, the field \u2126 lies in the (xy) plane and its components are described by the second angular harmonics [25, 26]. The magnitude of \u2126 depends only on the absolute value of K. Strain breaks the axial symmetry of the system making the magnitude \u2126 dependent on both the magnitude and direction of K, as shown in panels (b) and (c). Also, a z-component of \u2126 appears. The reversal of the sign of the strain changes the distribution of the field \u2126, cf. (b) and (c).\nDepending on the strain the energy spectrum of excitons can possess Dirac points where the polarization eigenstates are degenerate and the energy spectrum is conical. For illustrative properties let us assume that the main axes of the strain correspond to the (xy) axes of the structure, namely, Eq. (4) is fulfilled. In the centrosym-\nmetric approximation where C = 0 the effective magnetic field \u2126 vanishes at\nKx = 0, Ky = \u00b1 \u221a K2\u2217 , K 2 \u2217 > 0, (5a)\n4\nor at\nKx = \u00b1 \u221a \u2212K2\u2217 , Ky = 0 K2\u2217 < 0, (5b)\nwhere the parameter K\u2217 is determined from the equation.\nK2\u2217 = B(uxx \u2212 uyy) A(|K\u2217|) . (6)\nThe points (5a) and (5b) in the K-space correspond to a vanishing exciton polarization splitting, and the effective Hamiltonian in the vicinity of each point takes the form\nH(K\u0303) \u2248 ~ 2|K\u2217|2\n2M \u00b1 ~V\u2217(\u03c3yK\u0303x \u2212 \u03c3xK\u0303y), (7a)\nor\nH(K\u0303) \u2248 ~ 2|K\u2217|2\n2M \u00b1 ~V\u2217(\u03c3xK\u0303x + \u03c3yK\u0303y), (7b)\ndepending on whether Eq. (5a) or (5b) is fulfilled. Here\nK\u0303 is the wavevector reckoned from the corresponding Dirac point, Eq. (5), and the effective velocity is given by\nV\u2217 = ~|K\u2217|A(|K\u2217|). (8)\nIn Eqs. (7) we have omitted \u03c3x,y independent K\u0303-linear terms \u00b1~2K\u0303x,y|K\u2217|/M stemming from the parabolic exciton dispersion, which result in a tilt of the Dirac cones. The dispersion calculated using the total Hamiltonian (2) at C = 0 for K2\u2217 < 0 is shown in Fig. 3(a). It clearly shows the Dirac points with tilted conical dispersion.\nFor vanishing strain |K\u2217| \u2192 0 and Dirac points enter the light cone (|K\u2217| < \u03c90/c, where \u03c90 is the exciton emission frequency shown by the gray shading in Fig. 3) where excitons radiatively decay and A(K) becomes imaginary, see Eq. (23) and Ref. [25] for details. For the same reason, the dispersion in Fig. 3 demonstrates non-analytical features at Kx = 0. In such a case, there is no sense to\ndiscuss Dirac cones due to significant radiative damping of the excitons.\nInterestingly, the linear dispersion in Eqs. (7) can be strongly modified if the lack of the inversion symmetry is taken into account, i.e., where C 6= 0. If the parameters of the strain are such that K2\u2217 > 0 and Eq. (5a) is fulfilled, then \u2126z vanishes at Kx = 0, Ky = \u00b1K\u2217, and the dispersion acquires an additional K\u0303x-linear contribution \u221d \u03c3zC(uxx \u2212 uyy)K\u0303x that simply results in a \u2018tilt\u2019 of the eigenstates and anisotropy of the Dirac cone. By contrast, if K2\u2217 < 0 such that Eq. (5b) is fulfilled, then a gap opens in the spectrum: Indeed, the additional Clinear contribution to the effective Hamiltonian (7b) is given by\n\u03b4H = \u00b1\u03c3z ~ 2 C(uxx \u2212 uyy)\n\u221a \u2212K2\u2217 , (9)\nand it does not depend on the wavevector to the lowest order. Thus, the gap is given by\nEG = ~ 2 |C(uxx \u2212 uyy)|\n\u221a \u2212K2\u2217 .\nSuch situation is illustrated in Fig. 3(b) where the gap is seen. Note that for arbitrary orientation of the strain with respect to the crystalline axes x and y the gap is generally non-zero, it closes for specific orientations of the strain only."

[46, 61, 62] for details) whose Bloch functions at the K+ point of the Brillouin zone can be chosen as\n|c+ 2\u3009+ = X \u2032\u2212iY \u2032\u221a 2 , |c\u3009+ = X +iY\u221a 2 , (10)\n5 |v\u3009+ = S, |v \u2212 3\u3009+ = X \u2032\u2032\u2212iY \u2032\u2032\u221a\n2 .\nIn the K\u2212 valley the functions are obtained by the timereversal transformation and can be chosen, e.g., as complex conjugates of Eq. (10); Bloch functions X , Y, Z transform as the corresponding Cartesian coordinate, S is the invariant function; we use primes to denote different orbital composition of the Bloch functions in different bands. Since we are interested in the fine structure of the bright excitonic states, we consider the Bloch states with the fixed spin component, i.e, \u2191 in the K+ valley and \u2193 in the K\u2212 one. We recall that the bands c + 1, v \u2212 1, v \u2212 2 are odd at z \u2192 \u2212z reflection and provide no contribution to the parameter B. Such a model adequately describes the band structure and symmetry of the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in the vicinity of the K\u00b1 points [62]. The k \u00b7 p Hamiltonian of the K+ valley reads [46, 61, 62]\nH+ = Ec+2 \u03b36k\u2212 \u03b34k+ 0\u03b3\u22176k+ Ec \u03b33k\u2212 \u03b35k+\u03b3\u22174k\u2212 \u03b3\u22173k+ Ev \u03b32k\u2212 0 \u03b3\u22175k\u2212 \u03b3 \u2217 2k+ Ev\u22123  , (11) where k\u00b1 = kx \u00b1 iky, En (n = v \u2212 3, v, c, c + 2) are the energies of the band edges and \u03b32,...,6 are the parameters proportional to the interband momentum matrix\nelements. The Hamiltonian in the K\u2212 valley, H\u2212, is obtained by the conjugation of H+.\nThe strain mixes the bands in Eq. (10). In what follows we disregard the contributions uzz, uxz, uyz that involve the z-component of atomic displacements and assume that only uij with i, j = x, y are non-zero. Following the general approach of Ref.

The parameters \u039en,n\u2032 should be found from atomistic calculations similar to those in Ref. [4]. Typically, \u039en,n\u2032 are in the range from units to tens of eV.\nIn the first order in uij we obtain at k = 0\n|c\u0303\u3009+ = |c\u3009+ + u+2 (\n\u039ec+2,c Ec \u2212 Ec+2 |c+ 2\u3009+ + \u039ev\u22123,c Ec \u2212 Ev\u22123\n|v \u2212 3\u3009+ ) + u\u22122 \u039ev,c\nEc \u2212 Ev |v\u3009+, (14a) |v\u0303\u3009+ = |v\u3009+ + u\u22122 (\n\u039ec+2,v Ev \u2212 Ec+2 |c+ 2\u3009+ + \u039ev\u22123,v Ev \u2212 Ev\u22123\n|v \u2212 3\u3009+ ) + u+2 \u039ec,v\nEc \u2212 Ev |v\u3009+. (14b)\nThe expressions for the Bloch states in theK\u2212 valley can be obtained from Eqs. (14) by the complex conjugation. The ratios \u039en,n\u2032/(En\u2212En\u2032) can be estimated as 1 . . . 10.\nEquations (14) demonstrate that the selection rules for the optical transitions at the K\u00b1 points change and the strict (chiral) selection rules no longer hold in the presence of the in-plane strain. Making use of the 4-band k \u00b7p-Hamiltonian (11), we calculate the interband velocity matrix element for the transitions in \u03c3\u00b1 polarizations, v\u0303+cv = \u3008c\u0303|~\u22121\u2207kH+|v\u0303\u3009, to be\nv\u0303+cv(\u03c3 +) = \u03b33 ~ , v\u0303+cv(\u03c3 \u2212) = u\u22122\u03b7 \u03b33 ~ , (15)\nwhere the parameter \u03b7 equals to\n\u03b7 = 1\n\u03b33\n( \u039ec,c+2\nEc \u2212 Ec+2 \u03b34 + \u039ec,v\u22123 Ec \u2212 Ev\u22123 \u03b3\u22172+\n\u039ec+2,v Ev \u2212 Ec+2 \u03b3\u22176 + \u039ev\u22123,v Ev \u2212 Ev\u22123 \u03b35\n) . (16)\nSimilarly, transition matrix elements in the opposite (K\u2212) valley take the form\nv\u0303\u2212cv(\u03c3 +) = u2\u03b7 \u03b3\u22173 ~ , v\u0303\u2212cv(\u03c3 \u2212) = \u03b3\u22173 ~ . (17)\nOne can check that for a consistent choice of the phases of the Bloch functions in Eq. (10) the parameter \u03b7 is real.\nEquations (15) and (17) demonstrate that the optical transitions are, in the presence of strain, elliptically polarized. The strain-induced linear polarization is along the main axes of the strain tensor uij and the same in both valleys. In what follows we assume that uxy = uyx = 0, i.e., the axes (xy) are the main axes, Fig. 1(b), and obtain from Eqs. (15) and (17)\nPl = |v\u0303\u00b1cv,x|2 \u2212 |v\u0303\u00b1cv,y|2\n|v\u0303\u00b1cv,x|2 + |v\u0303\u00b1cv,y|2 = 2(uxx \u2212 uyy)\u03b7. (18)\nThus, interband emission of strained ML becomes linearly polarized with the overal (spectrally integrated)\n6 polarization degree given by Eq. (18). For rough estimates one can take \u03b7 \u223c 1 . . . 10 yielding Pl in the range of several to tens of percent per % strain.\nNote that the strain itself, at k = 0, cannot result in the splitting of the non-interacting electron and hole valley-degenerate states. This is because of the Kramers theorem resulting from the time-reversal symmetry: The single-particle valley splitting is provided only by the time-reversal non-invariant perturbations (e.g., magnetic field), while the strain does not change its sign at the time reversal as clearly seen from the definition (1). Thus, in order to derive B 6= 0, one has to take into account both the strain-induced modification of the band structure and the electron-hole interaction. Since the exchange interaction contains both the long- and short-range contributions the parameter B = Blr + Bsr, where the subscripts lr and sr denote, respectively, the long-range and shortrange effects. We discuss these effects in the following subsections."

[61]) and results in the renormalization of the oscillator strengths in x and y polarizations with\n\u0393\u03030,x = \u03930(1 + Pl), \u0393\u03030,y = \u03930(1\u2212 Pl), (19)\nwhere \u03930 is the exciton decay rate in the free space of unstrained ML [25, 68]:\n\u03930 = 2\u03c0q\n~ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223e~\u03b33\u03a6(0)\u03c90 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (20)\nwith q = \u03c90/c being the wave vector of exciton-induced radiation, \u03c90 is the exciton resonance frequency, \u03a6(0) is the electron-hole envelope function at the coinciding coordinates. In the presence of a substrate with the amplitude reflection coefficient rb (cf. Refs. [48, 68]), the splitting between x- and y-polarized excitons due to the long-range exchange interaction reads\n\u2206 =~Blr(uxx \u2212 uyy) = ~\u03930Pl Im{rb}. (21)\nSince |rb| 6 1 and Pl 6 1 by definition, the splitting is smaller than the exciton radiative decay rate to the vacuum, ~\u03930. The ratio of the splitting and the radiative\nlinewidth in the structure with the substrate ~\u03930(1 + Re{rb}) [68] can be evaluated as\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ~Blr(uxx \u2212 uyy)~\u03930(1 + Re{rb}) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Pl sin\u03c6|rb|\u22121 + cos\u03c6 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (22)\nwhere \u03c6 is the phase of the substrate reflection coefficient, rb = |rb| exp (i\u03c6). Interestingly, this ratio can be sufficiently large if the substrate reflection coefficient rb is close to \u22121 (\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c0). In this case the radiative linewidth of the exciton is strongly suppressed making the ratio of the splitting to the radiative linewidth in Eq. (22) arbitrarly large.\nFor completeness, we present here the expression for the K-dependent long-range exchange contribution for a ML in a vacuum [25, 48]. The parameter A(K) in the effective magnetic field (3) reads\nA(K) = \u03930 q \u221a K2 \u2212 q2 . (23)\nWe note that for the states within the light cone, K < q, A(K) is imaginary and the exchange interaction results in the renormalization of the exciton radiative decay rates (this part is shown in Fig. 3 by the shaded grey area), while for K > q the long-range exchange interaction gives rise to the splitting of the exciton states."

(25)\nHere, as above, \u03a6(\u03c1) is the envelope of the electron-hole relative motion in the exciton, and the constant U can be expressed via the matrix elements of U\u0302 multiplied by the factors like \u039ec,c+2/(Ec \u2212 Ec+2), . . . , cf.

[69, 70] for conventional quantum wells. In that case, elastic strain mixes the states of heavy and light holes (similarly to Eqs. (14)), while the short-range exchange interaction provides the splitting of exciton levels. On the one hand, for quantum wells the splitting between the heavy and light holes is considerably smaller (10 . . . 100 meV) as compared to the interband splitting in TMDC MLs. On the other hand, the exchange interaction is much larger in TMDC MLs as compared to the quantum wells. That is why the overall effect of strain on the exciton levels is expected to be comparable in the two systems."

Correspondingly, the mechanisms described above do not require the lack of the inversion center. Indeed, these parameters are non-zero in the centrosymmetric model where \u03b35 and \u03b36 in the effective Hamiltonian (11) vanish, and \u039ec,v, \u039ec+2,v and \u039ev\u22123,v in the strain-induced Hamiltonian (12) vanish as well: In that case the k-linear coupling between the Bloch states whose angular momentum components differ by two, e.g., between c and c+ 2, v \u2212 3 is absent and the strain-induced coupling of the Bloch states with angular momentum components differ by one, e.g., between v and all other bands, is absent as well. Additional contributions to the strain-induced splitting characterized by the parameter B may arise, beyond centrosymmetric approximation, e.g., due to the piezoelectric effect [71, 72]. Indeed, an elastic strain gives rise to a dielectric polarization [23] and, consequently, an in-plane electric field E = (Ex, Ey), with Ex \u221d 2uxy, Ey \u221d uxx \u2212 uyy that modifies an intrinsic mixing of sand p-shell excitons studied in Ref. [61]. We expect, however, that such mechanisms provide weaker contributions as compared to those discussed above. Indeed, for such mechanisms the lack of the inversion center should be taken into account twice: firstly, in the piezo-effect and, secondly, in the intrinsic s\u2212 p-exciton mixing.\nBy contrast, the parameter C in Eq. (3) that describes K-linear pseudomagnetic field appears only in the noncentrosymmetric model. Evaluating the matrix elements of the four-band Hamiltonian (11) on the Bloch functions (14) we obtain the linear in the wavevector and strain contributions to the conduction and valence band dispersion in the K+ valley:\nEc+(k) = \u3008c\u0303|H+|c\u0303\u3009 = Ec + \u039ec(uxx + uyy) + [(uxx \u2212 uyy)kx + 2uxyky]\u03b33\u03b6c, (26a)\nEv+(k) = \u3008v\u0303|H+|v\u0303\u3009 = Ev + \u039ev(uxx + uyy) + [(uxx \u2212 uyy)kx + 2uxyky]\u03b33\u03b6v, (26b)\nwhere\n\u03b6c = 2\n\u03b33 ( \u03b3\u22176\u039ec+2,c Ec \u2212 Ec+2 + 2\u03b35\u039ev\u22123,c Ec \u2212 Ev\u22123 ) , (27a)\n\u03b6v = 2\n\u03b33 ( \u03b3\u22174\u039ec+2,v Ev \u2212 Ec+2 + 2\u03b32\u039ev\u22123,v Ec \u2212 Ev\u22123 ) .

In the K\u2212 valley the dispersions acquire similar form, but, owing to the time-reversal, the k-linear terms have opposite signs:\nEc\u2212(k) = Ec + \u039ec(uxx + uyy)\n\u2212 [(uxx \u2212 uyy)kx + 2uxyky]\u03b33\u03b6c, (28a)\nEv\u2212(k) = Ev + \u039ev(uxx + uyy)\n\u2212 [(uxx \u2212 uyy)kx + 2uxyky]\u03b33\u03b6v. (28b)\nEquations (26) and (28) describe k-linear terms arising on the electron and hole dispersion in the presence of strain. Similarly to classical semiconductors such terms are possible only in non-centrosymmetric media [73]. Indeed, the parameters \u03b6c, \u03b6v contain \u03b35, \u03b36 and \u039ec+2,v, \u039ev\u22123,v that vanish in the centrosymemtric model.\nWe can now combine Eqs.

Taking into account that the electron, ke, and hole, kh, wavevectors are related to the exciton center of mass, K, and relative motion, \u03ba, wavevectors by ke = (me/M)K \u2212 \u03ba and kh = (mh/M)K + \u03ba with me,h being the electron and hole effective masses (M = me +mh), and making use of the fact that the hole state is obtained from the unoccupied state in the valence band by the time reversal, we obtain\nC = 2\u03b33 ~ (me M \u03b6c + mh M \u03b6v ) .

The elastic deformations and local strains are created by transferring hBN-encapsulated WSe2 monolayers onto SiO2/Si substrates supporting semiconductor nanowires. A detailed description of the sample fabrication process and the characterization of the resulting uniaxial tensile strain is presented in our previous study [24]. These heterostructures are studied by monitoring the emission of bright X0 excitons in position- and polarization-resolved \u00b5-PL\n8 X0 X0 (a)\n1.70 1.72 Energy (eV) 1.72 1.74\nPL (a\nrb . u\n.)\n0\u00b0 90\u00b0\n\u0394= -0.8meV\nEnergy (eV)\n(b) (c)unstrained strained\nnanowire\nlaser WSe2 hBN\nhBN\nStrain 0 max\nFigure 4.

In the strained region, the PL is shifted to lower energies and linearly polarized in parallel (0\u25e6) and perpendicular (90\u25e6) directions with respect to the nanowire. It exhibits a splitting \u2206 of the peak energy between the two polarizations.\nscans, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4(a). All measurements are conducted at T=4 K to take advantage of narrow spectral linewidths. We use a continuouswave laser with photon energy of 2.33 eV to excite WSe2 samples non-resonantly. These conditions are chosen to avoid optically induced valley coherence for clean analysis of linear polarization of the PL. The laser beam is focused onto a spot diameter of \u223c 1\u00b5m by a 100\u00d7 microscope objective. The PL spot being on the same spatial scale as the deformation by the nanowire creates additional broadening due to the averaging areas with different strain. A combination of a half-wave plate and a linear polarizer placed in front of the detector is used to analyze the PL polarization.\nPL spectra of a WSe2 monolayer obtained from flat, unstrained regions of the sample show an emission peak from neutral, bright A-excitons (X0) at 1.725 eV. Since bright X0 excitons in K\u00b1 valleys emit circularly polarized light in the absence of strain [cf. Fig. 1(a)], their PL does not change when probed along two orthogonal polarization axes [see Fig. 4(b)]. The same measurement shows a very different result when we detect the X0 emission in a strained region on top of the nanowire. The PL maximum shifts by \u223c20 meV to lower energies due to uniaxial tensile strain. Moreover, the X0 peak splits into a doublet for linear polarization parallel (0\u25e6) and perpendicular (90\u25e6) to the nanowire axis, i.e., along the expected main axis of the strain tensor, in accordance with the theoretical predictions, see Figs. 1 and 3.

Uniaxial tensile strain is calibrated by \u221263.2 meV per % strain. A line fit estimates the strain dependence of the energy splitting \u2206 to be \u22123.4 meV per % strain.

The maximum splitting is on the order of 1 meV and the low-energy peak emits at a higher intensity corresponding to a polarization degree of about 15 %.\nFigure 5 presents the energy splitting \u2206 obtained by scanning the laser excitation spot across the elastically deformed region and fitting the recorded X0 emission for both polarization axes by Gaussian functions. While the absolute values of the energy splittings are comparatively small, we observe a consistent dependence of the splitting on the position of the sample and on the energy of the PL emission maximum. We note that the additional oscillatory behavior superimposed on \u2206 is likely related to a residual coupling between X0 excitons and the optical modes of the nanowire waveguide-like structure, see below. Other common sources of the exciton energy shift, such as spatial fluctuations of the doping density or of the dielectric environment, are unlikely to contribute since neither the trion intensity nor the binding energy of the ground state exciton changes significantly, as shown in our previous study [24]. Measurements of \u2206 in two other samples quantitatively confirm the results presented in Figs. 4 and 5. A linear fit to the data provides a scaling factor of \u22123.4 meV per % uniaxial tensile strain compared to \u221263.2 meV per % strain for the absolute shift of the exciton peak with the latter value being consistent with the exciton deformation potentials in WSe2 MLs [10, 24].\nThe observed strain induced linear-polarization split-\n9 ting of the exciton is in accord with the theory developed in Sec. III. As we have shown, there are two contributions to the strain-induced splitting: due to the long-range exchange interaction, Eq. (21), and due to the short-range exchange interaction, Eq. (25). According to the estimate using Eq. (25) one can expect the short-range contribution to \u2206 \u223c 1 meV per % strain. Note that for ~\u03930 in the range of several meV and Pl . 15% the long-range exchange interaction provides by far smaller contribution to the splitting \u2206 as compared to the experimentally observed one in Fig. 5. It can, however, at least in principle, explain oscillations of the splitting superimposed over the linear behavior: Indeed, in our sample the interference of light reflected from the substrate and the nanowire can result in position-dependent oscillations of the substrate reflectivity rb [cf. Ref. [68]] which yield oscillations of \u2206 in Eq. (21) as a function of coordinate and, consequently, of the strain, see Fig. 4(a). The values of the induced linear polarization are also consistent with theoretical prediction, Eq. (18) [74]. We abstain from a more detailed quantitative comparison between the model and experiment which requires (i) precise atomistic calculations of the interband deformation potentials and shortrange exchange interaction parameters, (ii) experimental separation of the waveguide effects on the strain-induced splitting \u2206, and (iii) analysis of temperature effect on the linear polarization degree to separate overall polarization due to the variation of the optical selection rules and induced polarization due to the exciton thermalization over the strain-split fine structure states.\nThe observed behavior of the exciton resonance in mechanically-deformed WSe2 samples thus provides an experimental illustration for the fine structure splitting of the radiative doublet under strain."

            "text": "We have developed a theory of strain-induced effects on the exciton energy spectrum fine structure in 2D TMDCs. We have shown that the elastic strain produces optical anisotropy of a monolayer resulting in deviation from the chiral selection rules. The induced polarization is linked to the main axes of the strain tensor. Further, the strain gives rise to a wavevector independent polarization splitting of the exciton radiative doublet, experimentally demonstrated for uniaxially strained\nWSe2 monolayers. We have analyzed an interplay of this splitting with the wavevector dependent longitudinaltransverse splitting of excitonic states and shown that these contributions can compensate each other for particular values of the exciton wavevector. In the vicinity of these compensation points the exciton energy spectrum has a conical, massless Dirac, form. We have also identified a strain-induced wavevector dependent contribution to the exciton splitting in circular polarizations linked with the specific three-fold rotational symmetry of TMDC monolayers with broken spatial inversion. Microscopic mechanisms behind the strain-related contributions to the exciton effective Hamiltonian have been identified. The microscopic model has been developed within the four-band k \u00b7p-Hamiltonian, and the estimates of all relevant contributions are presented.\nThe developed theory provides a basis for the strain tuning of exciton fine structure [75] (see also Refs. [76, 77] for conventional semiconductor systems), an important property for quantum technology and the application of exciton and biexciton emission for generation of entagled photons [78]. The formation of a Dirac-like dispersion may be useful for the relalization of topologicallike effects in excitonic systems [79\u201381]. Strain-induced spatially inhomogeneous pseudomagnetic fields may also be realized in bilayer structures where moire\u0301 effects are important [82\u201385] enabling adiabatic exciton pseudospin evolution. Strain-induced exciton fine structure splitting can be also important for the optomechanical applications of excitons in atomically-thin crystals [86\u201389]."
