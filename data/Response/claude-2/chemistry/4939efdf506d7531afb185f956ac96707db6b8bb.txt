 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Study the adsorption behavior with different protein structures beyond spherical/globular, such as fibrous or elongated proteins. The shape and flexibility of the protein likely impacts how it interacts with and adsorbs to the polymer coating.

2. Investigate how different polymer chemistries like charge, hydrophobicity, etc. affect the protein adsorption. The current model uses a generic polymer, but properties like charge could significantly impact protein-polymer interactions.

3. Explore mixed systems with multiple protein types to understand competitive adsorption between different proteins. The current work studies adsorption of identical proteins, but complex mixtures may show new effects.

4. Develop more detailed protein models that go beyond hydrophobic/hydrophilic beads, incorporating specific amino acid sequences and structures. This could reveal more nuanced protein-polymer interactions. 

5. Study the effects of flow and shear on the adsorption process. The current model is under static conditions, but flow is relevant for many real systems and applications.
