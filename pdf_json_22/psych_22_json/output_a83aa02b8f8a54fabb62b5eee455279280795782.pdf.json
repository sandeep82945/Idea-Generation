    "abstractText": "Spatial orientation is essential for daily life, but it deteriorates with aging. The present study was aimed at investigating age changes across the adult lifespan in the self-reported use of navigation aids and everyday orientation experiences, as well as investigating to what extent these are related to visuospatial working memory (VSWM) and self-reported wayfinding inclinations. A sample of 456 people aged 25\u201384 years rated how much they use navigation aids (maps, GPS, verbal directions), how much they went out, and how much they reached or lost their way to unfamiliar destinations (in 2016). Then, they performed the jigsaw puzzle test (VSWM) and questionnaires on sense of direction, pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety. The results showed that increasing age is related to a lower tendency to go out, fewer experiences of finding one\u2019s way and getting lost, a lower level of GPS use, and increased verbal directions use. After age changes were accounted for, VSWM was related to aid use and orientation experiences (except for losing one\u2019s way), wayfinding inclinations (especially spatial anxiety) to using a map, and orientation experiences. Overall, other than age, VSWM and one\u2019s wayfinding attitudes can play a role\u2013albeit it a modest one\u2013in spatial behaviors.",

            "text": "The abilities to navigate and orient oneself to the environment are essential in daily life for one to successfully reach destinations and avoid getting lost. Such abilities have been shown to decline with increasing age [1,2]. These impairments can limit older people\u2019s independence and safety of living, thus having an impact on their perceived quality of life [3,4]. Therefore, within the healthy and active aging domain perspective, it is important to extend our theoretical knowledge on older people\u2019s navigation issues and on the factors that can be related to them. Most of the current knowledge about the navigation and aging issue derives from studies asking people to learn unfamiliar paths from navigation, a sensorimotor experience in which information is acquired from the person\u2019s point of view [5]. The environment learning process and the related mental representation of it (or, the cognitive map [6,7]) can be assessed using several spatial recall tasks. Research has shown a decline with aging in landmark knowledge, location knowledge, and path knowledge (see [2] for a review). At the same time, asking people to self-report their experienced navigation issues is a modality used to detect everyday habits related to navigation-based experiences [8]. Studies investigating the navigation issues in older adults both with self-reports (in terms of the strategies adopted while navigating, as well as the characteristics of the environment that are believed to increase the experience of getting lost) and new environment learning showed a link between subjective\u2013self-reported\u2013and objective\u2013performance-based\u2013modalities [9]. Thus, self-reports\u2013shown to be related to objective navigation learning\u2013could be informative\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

            "text": "1.1.1. Everyday Orientation Experiences\nPrevious research on the self-reported everyday spatial behaviors of people across the adult lifespan showed reduced self-reported mobility (e.g., trips per week and average driving frequency) with increasing age [11]. People also report less walking time with increasing aging, especially over the age of 75 years [12,13]. Older adults reported preferring trips to well-known places with respect to unfamiliar places [14]. They reported preferring less complex trips (e.g., involving only one destination at a time rather than multiple destinations), and using public transportation less [15]. These spatial behaviors and experiences could reflect older adults\u2019 tendency to minimize the experience of getting lost [8,16]. For instance, it was shown that the fear of disorientation prevented older people from using public buildings [17]. However, due to these navigation issues, older people tend to restrict the activities in which they are involved, which, in turn, constitutes a barrier for healthy and active aging.\n1.1.2. Use of Navigation Aids\nAmong spatial behaviors across the adult lifespan, it is of interest to examine not only the everyday orientation experiences (going out, reaching places, and/or experiences of getting lost) but also the use of navigation aids. They comprise the instruments (e.g., maps, global positioning system-GPS) and modalities (e.g., asking for verbal directions) used to support moving in the environment. Navigation aid use is of interest for the identification of people\u2019s spatial profiles [18] and, related to this, for people\u2019s navigation performance accuracy and navigation habits. Indeed, in young adults, navigation aid use relates to the quality of the mental representation of the environment [7], which, in turn, helps with successful navigation. Maps have been shown to support the construction of refined spatial mental representations [19,20]. Their use has a positive impact on recall task performance involving reading them before navigating in the new environment [21,22], as well as reading them during navigating [23]. Thus, maps are an effective tool for navigation performance accuracy. In contrast, to date, the use of GPS (navigator) seems not to facilitate the construction of cognitive maps and navigation performance [24,25], and its use seems to be a distraction from one\u2019s surroundings [19,24\u201326]. Ishikawa and colleagues [27]) found that participants who used GPS traveled longer distances, stopped more often during their navigation experiences, and had lower levels of the recall of the environment learned compared with those who used maps or had no aids. Subsequent research confirmed GPS use\u2019s detrimental in spatial mental representations. Another modality used when navigating, then, involves asking for verbal directions [28]. Mental representations derived from verbal descriptions have spatial properties [29]. The use of verbal directions in navigation has been shown to favor the recall of spatial information when they convey information about the environment\u2019s global layout (e.g., describing how landmarks are located in relation to one another using cardinal points) and not when landmarks are presented only as reference points in navigation [30,31]. Overall, these studies showed that the presence of maps and verbal directions-presenting global information about the environment seems to support individuals\u2019 navigation accuracy. Meanwhile, the use of GPS seems not to support navigation. However, from the little evidence available for the elderly, with increasing age, the role of navigation aids seems to have changed its relevance. Research showed a decrease in map learning with aging [32] and learning a route from a map before did not consequently help with the path navigation process [33]. Also, having a map available while navigating did not increase the navigation performance. However, older adults felt more secure when\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1225 3 of 15\nthe map was there [34]. Concerning GPS use, it seems to positively support navigation. When older adults are trained to use GPS tools, they increase their successful driving (e.g., reaching the destination) [35]. Furthermore, older adults reported using GPS to plan their trips to minimize their self-reported fear of getting lost [8]. On the contrary, spatial verbal directions appeared not to support spatial mental representations of older adults compared with other inputs, such as maps [36\u201338]. Overall, aging changes people\u2019s spatial behaviors, such as their mobility [11], experiences of reaching places or getting lost [8,15], and the use of navigation aids [8,34]. Such navigation-based spatial behaviors could relate to individual factors other than age, however."

            "text": "Previous research focused mainly on lab-based environment learning performance and suggested that people can differ widely in their navigation capabilities and spatial behaviors due to individual factors, such as visuospatial abilities [39,40]. In adulthood, route learning is related to individual spatial abilities, such as visuospatial working memory (VSWM), which is the ability to retain and process visuospatial information [41]. This pattern of results has also been found in the adult lifespan, from youth to older age [42]. Despite the decline in this ability with aging [43,44], it still supports older adults\u2019 environment learning from navigation [45]. At the same time, other than spatial abilities, environment learning performance relates to self-reported wayfinding inclinations, i.e., individual preferences and attitudes related to wayfinding [46,47] that define one\u2019s spatial profile [48]. These include-among others\u2013 people\u2019s self-reported sense of direction [49,50], individuals\u2019 preferences for representing environments [49,50], exploration tendency and pleasure in doing so [48,51], and spatial anxiety [52]. Altogether higher ratings (and ratings lower in spatial anxiety) can be called positive wayfinding inclinations [18]. Although related to each other, these wayfinding inclinations contribute differently to route learning as a function of the spatial knowledge tested in young adults [47]. In studies adopting an adult lifespan perspective, self-reported wayfinding inclinations, such as sense of direction and pleasure in exploring, tend to remain stable throughout the adult lifespan, whereas spatial anxiety is susceptible to increasing in later life (over 70 years old; see [53,54]). Wayfinding inclinations (such as a greater sense of direction, greater pleasure in exploring places, a lower level of spatial anxiety) support environment knowledge (such as pointing cardinal points from their positions [51]) and the repetition of a route previously learned. Here, the evidence of self-reported spatial behaviors in daily life with an individual\u2019s spatial abilities and wayfinding attitudes in both young and older adults is scarce. An expectation is set forth by the Meneghetti et al. [18] study that showed that the self-reported use of maps as navigation aids in young adults is related to positive wayfinding inclinations but not to spatial abilities. Similarly, M\u00fcnzer et al. [20] found that older adults who self-report using maps as navigation aids also report a higher positive wayfinding inclination in terms of strategies. However, no studies have adopted an adult lifespan perspective to examine these issues."

            "heading": "1.3. Rationale and Aims",
            "text": "The present study started from the premise that self-reported spatial behaviors could be informative of people\u2019s navigation difficulties related to their objective spatial abilities [8,9]. The literature showed age changes-namely increasing age from youth to older age-in selfreported orientation experiences (such as mobility [11] and the experiences of reaching places or getting lost [8,15]) and in the use of navigation aids (such as maps [34] or GPS [8]). Apart from age, an adequate spatial profile [18,48] in terms of spatial abilities (VSWM) and inclinations could support functional spatial behaviors. However, little evidence regarding the young has suggested a relation between self-reported spatial behaviors in everyday life (use of navigation aids) and individual visuospatial factors [18,20]. This issue merits being investigated with an adult lifespan perspective to better capture any age-related\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1225 4 of 15\nchanges. In fact, in the adult lifespan, evidence exists that environment-based self-reports are linked, even if differently, to spatial performance [51], and individual visuospatial factors are related to environmental performance [47]. It is plausible that self-reported spatial behaviors (people-orientation experiences and navigation aid use) might also be linked to individual visuospatial factors. This issue has yet to be investigated. Examining age, visuospatial abilities, and people\u2019s attitudes in their relationship to spatial behavior contribute to a better understanding of older adults\u2019 everyday mobility. The self-reported experience could be informative about the impact of navigation issues on the daily life of older adults, to promote healthy and active aging. In this context, the present study was aimed at investigating from an adult lifespan perspective the relationship among self-reported everyday spatial behaviors, such as orientation experiences (tendency to go out, successfully reaching an unfamiliar destination, or getting lost), people\u2019s use of navigation aids (maps, GPS, verbal directions), individual visuospatial factors in terms of VSWM, and one\u2019s wayfinding inclinations (sense of direction, pleasure in exploring places, and spatial anxiety).\nHypothesis\nIn considering people\u2019s self-reported experiences of going out and orienting themselves in the environment, we hypothesized\u2013in line with previous literature-that increasing age could be associated with a tendency to go out less [11], and with experiences of getting lost, given that older adults tend to avoid situations that might be disorienting [8]. We explored whether people also report successfully reaching their destinations less frequently as they grow older. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated this issue; however, successful wayfinding is important for navigation [10]. In addition to age, we newly investigated the role of visuospatial abilities (VSWM) and wayfinding inclinations. We hypothesized that a better VSWM and positive wayfinding inclinations (such as a stronger sense of direction, pleasure in exploring, and a lower level of spatial anxiety) could be related to a higher frequency of going out, successfully reaching destinations and fewer experiences of getting lost due to better navigation performance [51]. Moreover, given previous evidence suggesting that people can use support (such as maps and/or GPS) to minimize their negative orientation experiences [8], such as reaching places/getting lost, we also explored\u2013as a complementary aim\u2013whether navigation aids predict a decrease in getting lost and an increase in successfully reaching destinations. The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to explore age-related changes in the use of navigation aids. Given that older adults make less use of technology, in Italy at least [55], we expected increasing age to be associated with lower usage of GPS, but not of maps or verbal directions. As well as age, we also explored how older people\u2019s VSWM and wayfinding inclinations related to their use of navigation aids. Given previous evidence, the only expectation was a relationship between map use and positive wayfinding inclinations [18,20]. As for the use of GPS and verbal directions, and their relationship with VSWM and wayfinding inclinations, as no previous research is available, we envisaged two possible scenarios. People with good spatial profiles, in terms of their VSWM and wayfinding inclinations, could rely less on the use of external support, or else they might use them more because they add to their enjoyment of their orientation experiences. To investigate the relationship between spatial behaviors and age, VSWM and attitudes, we asked a sample of people 25\u201384 years old to self-report their everyday orientation experiences (how much they go out, how often they reach or lose their way to unfamiliar destinations, and their use of navigation aids such as maps, GPS, verbal directions). They also performed a VSWM test and completed questionnaires on their wayfinding inclinations (sense of direction, pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety). All this information is presented in the following section, followed by the results regarding everyday orientation experiences and the use of navigation aids, and a discussion of our findings.\nInt.

Therefore, we considered at least 121 people per group. For including older adults with normal cognitive functioning, an inclusion criterion of Montreal Cognitive Assessing (MoCA [56]) score of at least 22 were needed for participants aged 60 or older (see [57] for the Italian normative sample) (M MoCA = 27.17, SD = 1.68).

The order in which the factors were inserted into the models reflects the order used in previous spatial cognition studies on young and older adults [45,54] given the subjective self-reported spatial behaviors related to objective navigation learning [9]. Gender and years of education were entered into a baseline model (Step 0) to control for the effect of gender (given its influence in the spatial domain on the young [62], as well on the adult lifespan [53]) and years of education given its role in spatial task performance with increasing age [63]. Then, the age in the continuum was entered to analyze any age changes from 25 to 84 years (Step 1) in self-reported spatial behaviors [8,11]. After these variables were controlled for, the contributions of cognitive abilities, in terms of processing abilities (i.e., VSWM) (as in [45]), and self-reported measures, in terms of wayfinding attitudes (as in [54]), to spatial behaviors were examined. Therefore, in Step 2, JPT performance was inserted as the VSWM measure. Next, in Step 3, self-reported wayfinding inclinations (SDSR, AtOT, and SA) were added to see whether they still had a role after all other factors had been accounted for.

Age (Step 1) did not emerge as a significant predictor and accounted for 1% of the variance. JPT (VSWM, Step 2) emerged as a significant predictor, meaning that higher JPT scores are associated with the increased use of maps, accounting for 3% of the variance. Step 3 accounted for another 3% of the variance, with AtOT and spatial anxiety emerging as significant predictors, meaning that greater attitudes toward orientation and higher spatial anxiety are associated with higher map use (see Table 2). For GPS use (total R2 = 0.35), Step 0 accounted for 13% of the variance, with both gender and years of education emerging as significant predictors. Age (Step 1) emerged as a significant predictor and accounted for 19% of the variance. JPT (VSWM, Step 2) emerged as a significant predictor, meaning that higher JPT scores were associated with the increased use of GPS, accounting for 3% of the variance. Step 3 did not account for any variance (see Table 2). For the use of verbal instructions (total R2 = 0.09), Step 0 accounted for 3% of the variance, with gender emerging as a significant predictor. Age (Step 1) emerged as a significant predictor and accounted for 3% of the variance. JPT (VSWM, step 2) emerged as a significant predictor, meaning that high JPT scores were associated with lower use of verbal instructions, accounting for another 3% of the variance. Step 3 did not account for any additional variance (see Table 2)."

            "text": "The present study examined the relationships between several self-reported spatial behaviors and experiences and people\u2019s own spatial ability (as measured by a VSWM task) and wayfinding inclinations (such as sense of direction, pleasure in exploring, and spatial anxiety) in the adult lifespan, from 25 to 84 years old. Before the main results are presented, the roles of the control variables examined\u2013gender and year of education\u2013are discussed given their crucial role in spatial cognition [62,63]. It is worth noting that both variables emerged in relation to spatial behaviors and experiences. Years of education were related to increased going out, successfully reaching destinations, and the use of maps and GPS. This result confirms that education not only is an important proxy indicator of the cognitive reserve [64,65] and is thus related to active aging but also is an important factor to consider when analyzing older adults\u2019 spatial behaviors [2]. Years of education are also associated with increased experiences of getting lost. This result could reflect that people who go out more and are active in finding their way are inevitably more exposed to potentially negative experiences in the environment, such as getting lost. Taken together, the result for years of education implies the need to promote lifelong learning, even in older age [66], to sustain spatial behaviors and thus navigation in the environment, which, in turn, promotes active aging. Regarding the role of gender, females reported going out less and not using navigation aids, such as maps and GPS, preferring the use\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1225 10 of 15\nof verbal directions. This profile does not help with spatial knowledge acquisition [67], and here, it also seems not to encourage successful spatial behaviors. The female issue in spatial cognition needs to be better investigated [62] altogether with its impact on spatial experiences and behaviors in daily life, especially in aging. The main interest of the study was to examine the relationship among age, VSWM, and wayfinding inclinations for people (from young to older adults) self-reporting everyday experiences and navigation aid use. The results showed that the individual factors (age, VSWM, wayfinding inclinations) emerged as predictors of the use of navigation aids, selfreported going out, and orientation experiences, with some specificity, existing depending on the dependent variable considered. Each factor in relation to the dependent variables is discussed in the following paragraphs. Considering the role of age, our results showed the relations-although modest in terms of the variance explained-between age (getting older) and decreasing in going out, decreasing in the frequency of reaching places, and decreasing in the frequency of losing one\u2019s way in unfamiliar environments. These result patterns suggest that aging reflects reduced mobility [11]. Probably going out less is a strategy for avoiding the experience of getting lost [8]. Our results also showed a relationship between increasing age and the lower use of GPS as well as greater use of verbal directions, although it was modest. Concerning GPS use, recent evidence suggested its detrimental role in spatial knowledge acquisition in the young [24]. However, it seems to be a good device for helping older adults to orient to the environment [35]. Therefore, a detailed investigation of its role in the adult lifespan would be of interest for future studies. The use of verbal directions, which is reported to be used more with increased age, is not a good strategy given that studies revealed that it is a less efficient modality for acquiring spatial knowledge compared with, for instance, maps [37]. These results concerning aging and everyday orientation experience highlight the importance of environmental policies promoting age-friendly environments to make older adults feel safe in exploring the environment. Maintaining older adults\u2019 mobility and their ability to find their way in the environment is important for their independence and quality of life [3]. To improve older adults\u2019 navigation skills, training them on efficient orientation strategy use could be another point of interest [68]. Thus, future studies are needed that highlight a procedure for training older adults to rely more on maps and GPS and to rely less on verbal instructions. However, above the roles of gender, year of education, and age, the role of people VSWM was found to be relevant for all variables except for the experience of losing one\u2019s way (even the relation goes in the same directions of those involving other variables, but it is not significant). Previous research showed the important role of VSWM in supporting spatial knowledge acquisition [47], even in the adult lifespan [42]. The present results expand our knowledge, suggesting that VSWM is also associated with higher, at least selfreported, mobility, greater experiences of success in the environment, and the self-reported functional use of navigation aids (more use of maps, more use of GPS, lower levels of the use of verbal instructions). This pattern of results suggests the importance of maintaining and training the individual VSWM, despite its age changes [69\u201371], given that it represents an ability related to every day successful spatial behaviors and experiences. Regarding the relationship found between VSWM capacity and higher GPS use, this appears to be in contrast with evidence suggesting that GPS may not facilitate the construction of cognitive maps [24,25]. It could be that people with higher spatial competencies are able to use the technology aid functionally and actively. However, these suppositions need to be better clarified in future studies. Although explaining a little portion of variance, a role of positive and negative wayfinding inclinations in some cases was found, too. Concerning positive wayfinding inclinations, a higher self-reported sense of direction was related to fewer self-reported experiences of losing one\u2019s way in an unfamiliar place. Positive attitudes with regard to experiencing pleasure in exploring places were related to a higher level of the use of maps. Therefore, one\u2019s positive inclinations related to wayfinding in the environment\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1225 11 of 15\nsomewhat support experiencing successful experiences in it. In addition, the use of an aid, the map, proved to be functional for navigation [72,73]. On the other hand, having negative wayfinding inclinations, such as a higher level of spatial anxiety, was found to be related to a lower tendency to go out, fewer experiences of reaching unfamiliar destinations, more experiences of getting lost, and greater map use. These results expand the current knowledge about spatial anxiety implied in decreasing spatial knowledge recall in young [30] and older adults [74], also suggesting its detrimental role in people\u2019s spatial behaviors and experiences in daily life. They also call upon the need to consider this aspect as for its applied and clinical value. Note that we found a positive association between spatial anxiety and the use of maps, and we could argue that people who are known to be spatially anxious tend to use a support to orient themselves as a strategy for compensating for their anxiety. The role of spatial anxiety thus also merits further investigation in future studies. However, it seems clear that promoting positive wayfinding inclinations and lowering the level of spatial anxiety in the adult lifespan could be another way in which to maintain positive and successful spatial behaviors and experiences in daily life. It is also worth noting that the role of positive and negative wayfinding inclinations is not found for GPS and verbal directions use, a result that merits further investigation to be confirmed (or not). Taken together, the results on individual visuospatial factors, such as VSWM and wayfinding inclinations, added insights to individual factors related to self-reported spatial behaviors, such as orientation experiences and navigation aid use. Implications can be seen across the adult lifespan, particularly in the view of healthy and active aging. The knowledge of spatial navigation impairments with increasing age is here expanded considering self-reported spatial behaviors and experiences. Therefore, understanding the lived experiences of people can provide insight that can be then used to improve their navigation abilities [8]. Considering the role of individual factors\u2013given the heterogeneity of the aging process\u2013seems to be a way in which to deeply understand the aging navigation issue to counteract\u2013or slow down\u2013age changes and to avoid its impact on people\u2019s perceived quality of life [3,4]. Implications could also be applied at the policy level. Transportation systems in cities should consider older individuals\u2019 mobility needs [75], for instance adopting technology as a facilitator for favoring orientation in the environment (e.g., readable maps) [76] and training people, especially older ones, in its use. However, some limitations of the present study should be mentioned as well. First, the variance that the factors considered explain is limited. This means that our factors of interest played a part, but other factors play a role in predicting people\u2019s spatial behaviors and should be investigated as well (e.g., personality factors, the role of the characteristic of the environment [77]). Another limitation is that self-assessed spatial behavior, although informative of everyday life, could not be precise and could not completely reflect the actual spatial behaviors that people have. Indeed, despite the evidence of the relationship between self-reported spatial behaviors with environmental performance in older adults [9], this does not guarantee an overlapping of the results obtained with subjective evaluations and objective ones. Future studies should corroborate people\u2019s subjective views of their everyday spatial behaviors with objective assessments, such as navigation performance in both familiar and unfamiliar environments. Another limitation of the present study is that it does not explicitly consider the distinction between familiar and unfamiliar environments, as well as where people go (navigation experiences related to a leisure activity, shopping, tourism, visiting relatives, etc.). Indeed, spatial behaviors and experiences could be different in well-known or newly explored environments. In aging, although a decline in the spatial learning of new environments occurs, spatial knowledge of one\u2019s city of residence is well preserved [78\u201380]. Future studies should thus investigate spatial behaviors in both familiar and unfamiliar environments. Another limitation is that different Likert scales are used in this study, and this may compromise the reliability of the result since the number of rating bars in the Likert scale is sensitive to the outcome of the measurement [81]. This issue merits future investigation. Finally, given the importance of individual differences, longitudinal studies could add more information to everyday spatial behaviors in aging [82].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1225 12 of 15\nFor example, data for the present study were collected in 2016, and it would be interesting to update them to investigate any changes in people\u2019s spatial behaviors."

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study sheds light on people\u2019s self-assessed spatial behaviors in relation to individual differences, adopting an adult lifespan perspective. Considering the role of increasing age, associated with unsuccessful spatial behaviors, the role of spatial abilities (VSWM) and positive wayfinding inclinations played a role in promoting spatial behaviors. On the other hand, the role of spatial anxiety is detrimental for spatial behaviors, especially for losing in an unfamiliar place. For promoting active and healthy aging with regard to maintaining people\u2019s mobility and active use of navigation aids, it seems to be important to consider people\u2019s spatial competencies and wayfinding inclinations from youth to older age.\nFuture Directions and Recommendations\nConsidering the limitations and the results of the present study, future directions could be focused on efforts to promote healthy and active aging. Several individual factors relating to their spatial behaviors should be considered and thoroughly investigated in future studies to support older people\u2019s mobility and interest in exploring the environment. For example, their use of GPS for navigation should be analyzed in-depth, given our increased reliance on GPS, even in aging [24,35], and the mixed findings on its influence on young and older adults\u2019 navigation accuracy [35]. Regarding the various individual differences relating to successful spatial behaviors, future studies could examine how to improve older adults\u2019 everyday spatial behaviors, by giving them training on the efficient use of orientation strategies (such as maps and GPS), basic cognitive abilities (such as VSWM), and on metacognitive reflection of their wayfinding inclinations, for instance.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.M. and C.M.; methodology, V.M. and C.M.; formal analysis, V.M.; data curation, V.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, V.M., E.B., F.P. and C.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.M., E.B., F.P. and C.M.; supervision, E.B., F.P. and C.M.
