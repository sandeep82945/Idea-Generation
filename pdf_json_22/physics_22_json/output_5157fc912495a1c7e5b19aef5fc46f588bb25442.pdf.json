    "abstractText": "Urbanization and its problems require an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of urban dynamics, especially the complex and diversified lifestyles in modern cities. Digitally acquired data can accurately capture complex human activity, but it lacks the interpretability of demographic data. In this paper, we study a privacy-enhanced dataset of the mobility visitation patterns of 1.2 million people to 1.1 million places in 11 metro areas in the U.S. to detect the latent mobility behaviors and lifestyles in the largest American cities. Despite the considerable complexity of mobility visitations, we found that lifestyles can be automatically decomposed into only 12 latent interpretable activity behaviors on how people combine shopping, eating, working, or using their free time. Rather than describing individuals with a single lifestyle, we find that city dwellers\u2019 behavior is a mixture of those behaviors. Those detected latent activity behaviors are equally present across cities and cannot be fully explained by main demographic features. Finally, we find those latent behaviors are associated with dynamics like experienced income segregation, transportation, or healthy behaviors in cities, even after controlling for demographic features. Our results signal the importance of complementing traditional census data with activity behaviors to understand urban dynamics.",

Most of our current understanding of problems like transportation, mobility, inequality, gentrification, or even social participation is based on census or survey information, which is updated infrequently, contains only coarse-grain information, and is scattered across different agencies or institutions [1]. On the other hand, we now have the potential to complement official data with high-resolution updates on how people purchase, move, get a job, or interact by leveraging new sources of information from mobile data [2, 3], social media [4, 5], wifi networks [6, 7], phone apps [8, 9], and credit cards [10, 11].

However, most cities are still using primary segments of census groups (residential areas, housing prices, gender, age, unemployment) or small behavioral surveys to map problems like inequality, gentrification, or transportation. This approach falls short of anticipating, monitoring, or forecasting the rapid and complex evolution of those problems in our cities. For example, the recent pandemic has highlighted the shortcomings of using outdated, non-integrated, and slow-processed data to manage and anticipate the spreading of COVID-19 and the special relevance of real-time, more granular, and high-frequency mobility data [15, 16].\nIn particular, people\u2019s mobility data has become more available thanks to the prevalence of location acquisition techniques and mobile phones, and it enables a new way to study and understand human behavior in cities. People\u2019s mobility behavior, e.g., the places they visit and their visiting frequency, can reflect people\u2019s lifestyle, understood as \u201cthe way in which a person or group lives\u201d [13, 17, 18]. Given the importance of lifestyles to predict individual and a group of individual\u2019s behavior, they have been thoroughly explored mainly in marketing [13] but also in many fields from transportation, [19], health [20\u201322] to psychology and sociology [14, 23].\nThe study of activity patterns and detection of lifestyles of urban residents based on survey data has a long tradition, [23] but recent developments in data collection and analysis have allowed the unveiling of the high-dimensional, rapid-changing, and complex lifestyles in our cities [10, 17\u201319, 24\u201328]. Studies that try to detect those lifestyles from activity data are generally limited by the completeness of the activity/mobility space (only expenditure patterns [10], mobility patterns only when mobile phone calls and messages appear [29, 30], only transportation transit patterns [25], or a very small number of demographic variables [19]), the limited geography (only one or two cities [10, 26]), or the number of people used to detect lifestyles [17, 27]. As a result, a small number of meaningful lifestyles were detected, insufficient to accommodate the highly heterogeneous and complex variability of our cities\u2019 behaviors.\nOn the other hand, in those studies, city residents\u2019 behaviors are typically classified into a single lifestyle group [10, 19]. This forces us to divide very similar individual behaviors into different groups just based on slight differences. Consequently, a significant fraction of individuals end up with unclassified lifestyles groups [10], or across groups with minimal different characteristics [19]. These problems severely limit those lifestyle groups\u2019 potential applicability to understanding problems like social-economic integration, mobility, or health, since slight individual behavioral differences or even different or incomplete datasets can yield a different grouping of users or lifestyles [18, 31\u201333].\nIn this work, we uncover people\u2019s lifestyles using a dataset of mobility traces of more than 1.2 million anonymous, opted-in users in 11 cities in the United States. By formulating people\u2019s behavior using venue and temporal activity vectors, we can extract a set of interpretable latent activity behavioral patterns [34]. Those latent behaviors are groups of visitation patterns that frequently co-occur in our sample of users. People\u2019s lifestyle is not a label for each individual but rather a linear combination of those latent behaviors with different weights. We investigate whether those behaviors can be predicted by simple demographic traits, e.g., race, income, or transportation. Although we find a small correlation, latent behaviors seem to be primarily independent of those demographic traits. Finally, we find that each component of those latent patterns has a different relationship with social, mobility, and health problems. Our results indicate that it is possible to construct a be-\nhavioral rich census of lifestyles in the U.S. cities that can complement traditional census to understand the main processes and problems in our cities."

Cities are defined as the Census Core Based Statistical Areas [35] that are socioeconomically metropolitan areas related to an urban center. It consists of approximately 67 billion records from N = 1.2 million anonymous opted-in devices, each of which has reported a total of at least 2000 locations over the six-month observation period. Our second data source is a collection of approximately 1.1 million verified venues across all CBSAs, obtained via the Foursquare API in 2017. Those venues are classified into different categories according to the Foursquare Category Hierarchy [36]. Only users with more than 50 visits during the period and with at least 5 categories visited were considered. We only considered the top most visited 248 categories to prevent over-fitting to small, infrequent categories. We infer the home area of each individual at the Census Block Group level using their most common location between 10 pm and 6 am. We further extract any individual visits to a given place that lasts for more than 5 minutes (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 1) and are less than 4 hours long. We have also tested that our results do not depend on this definition of visits to POI, see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 1. It is important to note that our visitation patterns include not only consumption patterns (restaurants, shops, sports events, etc.) but also other non-commercial activities (transportation, education, health, outdoor activities, etc.), which are important to explain urban lifestyles."

The source of transportation data is the 2017 Local Area Transportation Characteristics for Households Data done by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) [38], while obesity prevalence and physical activity are given by the 500 Cities Project Data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) [39]. Obesity prevalence is measured as the percentage of adults, aged 18 or older, who report a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Physical activity is measured as the fraction of adults who report getting leisure-time physical activity in the past month.

(B) Each individual is described by a M-dimensional (normalized) vector that contains the fraction of visits to each of the 286 categories (visitation pattern) plus the fraction of visits at different times during the day and the week (temporal pattern). (C) Non-negative matrix factorization is used to decompose the matrix of the M-dimensional vectors for each of our N users into a matrix of k different latent behaviors and the corresponding behavior\u2019s weights for each user. Icons designed by bqlqn/flaticon.com and Boston maps produced using Open Street Map data\nvariables using our data, we used the BTS and Census data because the latter is based on more reliable estimation statistics. But also because our data do not have complete daily individual trajectories of people, preventing us from having a precise estimation of the distance traveled and the commuting time.\nTo measure experienced social-economic integration, we use the inequality metric introduced in [8] to estimate how unequal is the exposure of an individual to the different income groups in the city. To this end, we divide the sample of users in each city into four quartiles according to the median household income of their home Census Block group [37]. Social-economic integration was measured as Ii = 1 \u2013 23 \u2211 q |\u03c4iq \u2013 1/4|, where \u03c4iq is the proportion of time user i is exposed to group q of income. That proportion is calculated by looking at the weighted distribution of income of the people that i encounters in the places she visits. Specifically \u03c4iq = \u2211 \u03b1 \u03c4i\u03b1\u03c4q\u03b1 , where \u03c4i\u03b1 is the fraction of time that i spends at place \u03b1 and \u03c4q\u03b1 represents the proportion of time at place \u03b1 spent by income group q. Our metric for individual economic integration can be thought of as an extension of the traditional metric of isolation or interaction for groups to the level of individuals based on daily encounters among them. Finally, social exploration is measured as Ei = Si/Ni, where Si is the total number of different places visited by i and Ni is the total number of visits to places by i. See [8] for more details on these metrics and their distribution."

            "text": "Rather than describing a person by a unique pattern, we will assume that there are some latent behavioral patterns that, when combined, define a person\u2019s lifestyle. The weight of the different latent behavior patterns could reflect their dominance over the person\u2019s lifestyle. To detect those latent behavioral patterns, we describe the activity of each user i by a M dimensional vector, which includes the (normalized) number of visits to the different types of places (248 venue categories, see Fig. 1 and Additional file 1, Supplementary Figure S2). We also include five temporal features about the fraction of those visits that happen dur-\ning the morning (5 am to noon), afternoon (noon to 6 pm), evening/nighttime (6 pm to midnight), and also during the weekend and weekdays. Thus user i activity is described by a vector xi of M = 248 + 5 components. As we will see in the results, adding the temporal pattern allows to recover different latent behaviors by day of the week.\nWhen put together for all N users, they form a matrix X of N \u00d7 M dimensions. Different methods exist to learn the latent patterns for the vectors of those N users, like spectral methods [3], Latent Dirichlet Allocation [25, 27, 29], neural networks, [17] or complex networks [10]. In general, these methods detect latent patterns, i.e. co-occurrence of variables (visitations in our case) that frequently appear in the dataset. Given that our vectors are non-negative, we apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to X. NMF is a powerful technique for finding parts-based, linear representations of non-negative data and has been applied successfully in several applications like genomics, image recognition, or text mining [40, 41]. In the context of human behavior, it has also been used to identify the activity patterns of users or urban areas [26, 30, 42\u201344].\nThe key idea is that the activity matrix can be decomposed into two matrices X = W \u00b7 B, where B is a matrix of dimension k \u00d7 M that contains each of the k latent behaviors and W is a N \u00d7 k matrix that contains the weights of those latent behaviors for each user (see Fig. 1(C)). Thus each xi can be decomposed as linear combination of k latent behaviors xi = \u2211k j=1 wijbj. In each latent behavior pattern bj, the higher value the type of venue or temporal feature holds, the more dominant that category of place or time of the week acts in the latent behavior pattern. For each user i, the higher the wij, the more important is latent behavior bj to explain her activity.\nThe activity matrix X is factorized using different ranks k. To do that, we used nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) using fast sequential coordinate-wise descent and Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence for the loss function. We run the NMF two hundred times for each value of k. Different methods [30, 44] were used to assess the value of k (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 4), including bi-cross validation [45]. We found that k = 12 was the one that optimizes the error, and the stability of the weights W and the bi-cross validation error, while making the latent behaviors B more interpretable across realizations. For that k = 12, we chose B and W from the realization with smaller KL loss (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 4). Our NMF factorization also produces very close representations of the whole mobility data. As we can see in Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 4, the KL average distance dKL(X, W \u00b7B) = 0.0195\u00b10.0001 or the Frobenius distance dF (X, W \u00b7 B) = 0.0033 \u00b1 0.00004 between the original data and the reconstructed one are very small. This means that on average, the error of our approximation is below 15% relative error.\nTo prevent an over-representation of the larger cities in the factorization, we did not use our 1.2 million users in the NMF. Instead, we randomly selected 10k users in each city and constructed the matrix X0. We factorize it into W0 \u00b7B0 and use B0 to solve the non-negative linear regression problem X \u223c W \u00b7 B0 to get W for the rest of the users. This way, we get a fair representation of all the latent behaviors commonly present across cities. In any case, we have also checked that our results are robust against different definitions of the sample of users, see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 7. To compare with other methods to detect latent patterns, we have also used LDA to detect latent behavior patterns (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 5). Although the results are somehow similar, we\nFigure 2 Latent behaviors: Visitation and temporal components for each of the k = 12 latent behaviors detected. For simplicity, only the top 7 venue category components by behavior are shown. Colors correspond to the different classifications of the venues. Temporal patterns correspond to the fraction of morning, afternoon, and night visits together with the fraction of weekday and weekend visits. The \u201cOut and around\u201d main components are residential and bus transportation during weekdays, while \u201cSocializing\u201d is composed of visitations to bars, sports bars, and food places like Italian, American, pizza, or seafood, especially during the evenings/nights. Finally \u201cLocal Trips\u201d refers to a latent behavior mainly composed of running errands (laundry, gas station, convenience store) and visitation to fast food or food truck venues\nfind that the latent behavior patterns detected by NMF have better interpretations than those from LDA."

Note that they are not strict projections only on one of those dimensions. For example, we find a latent behavior (\u201cWorking life\u201d) of working-related activities (Conference Room, Non-Profit) and nightlife venues, or a latent behavior \u201cOut and around\u201d that combines public transportation (bus) with neighborhood visits. Our choice of including the daily and weekly temporal pattern allows us to detect even different shopping behaviors between weekends (\u201cShopping weekends\u201d that also includes grocery shopping) and weekdays (\u201cShops weekdays\u201d). Other distinct latent behaviors correspond to \u201cCollege\u201d students, \u201cCoffee shop\u201d frequenters, or \u201cHealth & Exercise\u201d visitors. Note that our denomination of the latent behaviors is based on the most dominant categories, which are also the most visited categories in cities. This does not mean that other less-visited categories are not part of those behaviors. For example, most latent behaviors have some components in the Food category (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Figure S2). However, their relative\nimportance is smaller than in the \u201cLocal trips\u201d, \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d or \u201cBar + Food\u201d latent behaviors. Nevertheless, even for the places that are visited less frequently in our cities, the NMF can detect distinct patterns there. For example, the \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d latent behavior has large components in airport transportation venues than the rest of the behaviors (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, it is worth noticing that our detected latent behaviors are not only related to expenditure: an analysis based only on expenditure patterns would have probably missed important latent behaviors like \u201cOut and around\u201d, \u201cOffice\u201d, \u201cCollege\u201d or \u201cEducation\u201d.\nBy definition, our latent behaviors encode those visitation patterns which are more frequently happening together. For example, we find in the \u201cLocal trips\u201d latent behavior that fast food consumption is related to local errands, while nightlife is associated with workrelated places like Conference Rooms or Rental Cars. \u201cShopping weekend\u201d tells us that people tend to bundle visits to pharmacies, retail, groceries or departmental stores together. At the same time, in \u201cCoffee Shop,\u201d we see that visits to coffee shops are associated with the consumption of some types of food like Bakery, Sushi, and Burgers. Thus, our latent behaviors also tell us how people organize their mobility visitation patterns in their daily lives.\nAs we said, each person\u2019s activity lifestyle can be described as a linear combination of the latent behavior patterns according to their weights obtained by NMF (see Fig. 3). Instead of being described as a simple latent behavior, we find that a user\u2019s lifestyle generally depends on many behavior patterns. This is shown by the large entropy of weights by user Si = \u2013 \u2211k j=1 w\u0302ij log w\u0302ij/ log k (where w\u0302ij is the normalized weight by user), see Fig. 3(c). Strict dominance of single latent behavior would make Si = 0, while we get Si = 1 if all latent behaviors are present and equally important. In our data, we obtained that the average entropy is Si = 0.67 \u00b1 0.15, and thus many latent behaviors configure each user\u2019s activity pattern.\nHowever, some latent behaviors are, in general, more frequent than others. For example we find that the average weight of \u201cShopping Weekend\u201d (wij = 0.774 \u00b1 0.001) or \u201cOffice\u201d (wij = 0.657 \u00b1 0.001) is larger than others like \u201cWorking life\u201d (wij = 0.197 \u00b1 0.001) or \u201cCollege\u201d (wij = 0.195 \u00b1 0.001), which signals that, as expected, the former latent behaviors are more common in urban areas than the latter ones. That is, most individuals have a very small (or even zero) \u201cCollege\u201d latent behavior, while most people have some weight on \u201cShopping Weekend\u201d behavior.\nInterestingly, we find that these results are pretty robust across all the cities studied (see Fig. 3(B)), which means that each latent behavior\u2019s relative weights are very similar despite the different geography, density, or even cultural nature of the cities. This is an important result that demonstrates our method\u2019s robustness across different cities and the homogeneity of activity patterns across the U.S. However, there are small but important variations. For example, the relative weight of the \u201cCollege\u201d behavior is larger in Boston wBostonij = 0.270 \u00b1 0.001 because of the large population of university students in the area. Also, cities with better public transportation systems like Boston, Washington DC, or N.Y., have larger weights in the \u201cOut and around\u201d latent behavior than cities like Dallas or Detroit, where public transportation is scarce. Other significant variations happen in the \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d latent behavior, more present in cities like San Francisco or Seattle than in the rest. This is expected given that those cities are the ones with the most coffee shops per capita [46]. Taking together these results shows the adaptability and robustness of our\nFigure 3 Users\u2019 latent behaviors and lifestyles (A) Distribution of weights by latent behavior for three different users in our database.

            "text": "One important question is whether the detected latent behaviors can be explained by individuals\u2019 simple demographic or urban characteristics. Group segmentation using censustype only data is traditional in marketing, [12, 47] and even the U.S. Census Bureau used it to design its 2020 campaign [48]. Since mobility is highly influenced by socioeconomic status, access to public transportation, or the density of the urban area, we could expect that the detected latent behaviors might depend strongly on those features. However, we find that users\u2019 weights wij are largely independent of the median income, population density, the fraction of Black population, or even the fraction of people using public transportation (see Fig. 3(C) and Additional file 1, Supplementary Table S1). We only find moderate correlations with some latent behaviors. For example, low-income people have more \u201cLocal trips\u201d latent behavior, while \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d is a behavior more likely to be found in highincome areas. Of course, \u201cOut and around\u201d latent behavior is more prevalent in areas with higher public transportation use. Apart from those cases, the correlation between our latent behaviors\u2019 weights and demographic and urban features is very small R2 \u2264 0.1 (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 6 and Additional file 1, Supplementary Table S1). Thus, latent behaviors detected using mobility data are different from the traditional census demographic traits. The detected activity patterns give a different and complementary\nperspective of our cities than traditional census analysis, allowing us to construct a richer behavioral census that includes those behaviors."

            "heading": "3.3 Association of latent behaviors with social, mobility, and health problems",
            "text": "To demonstrate the complementary power of the latent behaviors to traditional census approaches, we have analyzed their association with different social, mobility, and health outcomes in the 11 cities. In the social dimension, we have considered Ii, the income integration (or diversity) experienced by each individual, introduced in [8]. This quantity reflects how homogeneous is the exposure of each individual to the different income groups in the city: by using the household median income of the Census Block group where user i lives, we can quantify the income group (income quartile within each city) she belongs to. Using that information for each user, we can estimate the amount of time a user i is exposed to the different income groups in the city while visiting different venues: if Ii = 0, individual i only goes to places where her particular income group is the majority. If Ii = 1, the individual is exposed equally to people from all the city\u2019s income groups (Methods Sect. 2.3). Other versions of diversity exposure have been analyzed recently [9] and, in particular, income exposure diversity is related to social capital and impacts economic opportunities, and social income mobility of individuals [49]. Also, along the social dimension, we have studied the individual\u2019s place exploration Ei, which measures the rate of visitation to different places by i in our time period [50]. That is, if Ni is the number of visits made by user i and Si is the number of unique places visited, then Ei = Si/Ni. Although people spend most of their time in a very small number of places [2, 24], it is well known that some tend to visit more places (explorers, Ei 1), while some others spend most of their time in a small set of places (returners, Ei 0). Explorers are people that go very often to never visited before places, while returners are constantly coming back to places that they already visited. Those two distinct classes of individuals have been found in many different mobility studies [2, 8, 51], but also in other people\u2019s activities like social network connections [52], web browsing [53], or knowledge discovery [54].\nBoth income exposure diversity and place exploration are crucial to understanding the social component of mobility in our cities and, specifically, how segregated (not integrated) people are. As was found in [8] experienced income integration is moderately and positively related to place exploration (\u03c1 = 0.456 \u00b1 0.001). To test the association of the latent behaviors in these problems, we have used a regression model:\nIi, Ei \u223c k\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b2jwij + m\u2211\nl=1\n\u03b3ldl + MSAi + \u03b5i, (1)\nwhere dl refers to the four demographic and urban features mentioned before (median household income, the density of the area, the fraction of Black people, and the fraction of use of public transportation), and MSAi is a fixed factor by city (Metropolitan Statistical Area). Including the census variables and city-fixed effects allows us to investigate the fundamental role of latent behaviors once we control for potential effects by demographic and urban characteristics and the city where users live. In our models, census features are always less important to explain that variability (R2 = 0.059 for Ii and R2 = 0.025 for Ei only using census variables) than our latent behaviors (R2 = 0.164 and R2 = 0.26 respectively using also latent behaviors, see Additional file 1, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. This\nresult shows that our latent behaviors encode most of the social-economic integration and exploration variability across users, which are largely independent of census variables.\nNevertheless, not all latent behaviors have the same effect on experienced income segregation and exploration. Figure 4 shows the relationship [measured as the standardized coefficient \u03b2j in the model (1)] of the different latent behaviors with both social problems. We find that the latent behaviors that impact economic integration are related to shopping or food/coffee. In contrast, others like college, office, or health are not heavily associated with economic integration. Interestingly, behaviors like \u201cShopping Weekend\u201d or \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d are positively associated with economic integration, while behaviors \u201cEducation\u201d, \u201cFactory\u201d or \u201cShopping weekdays\u201d are more present in users with more considerable experienced income segregation. This might be explained by the fact that shops, coffee shops, or some restaurants are more economically diverse in the city than factories, education, or local shops [8]. In general social exploration follows the same pattern, although people with more \u201cLocal trips\u201d behavior tend to be more explorers without being more integrated. These results show that the latent behaviors carry significant explanatory power of the income diversity and exploration experienced by people in the urban areas analyzed.\nWe have also studied other problems related to transportation and health. Lifestyles are crucial to understanding our mobility choices or opportunities and transportation routines [19], but also physical activity and the prevalence of some health conditions [21]. Since we do not have individual health conditions, we have used data from the Census, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and the Center for Disease Control to take variables by census tract \u03b1 describing the average distance traveled by residents D\u03b1 , the fraction of people that have more than 45 minutes of commuting C\u03b1 , the fraction of people with leisure-time physical activity in the past month P\u03b1 and the fraction of people with no obesity O\u03b1 (see Methods Sect. 2.3). To study the relationship of our latent behaviors with those problems, we construct the average weight by census tract w\u0302\u03b1,j for all the users living in that tract \u03b1 and fit them using similar models as Eq. (1), see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 6.\nAs we can see in Fig. 4, local behaviors like \u201cOut and around\u201d have a strong negative association with the distance traveled, although the association with commuting duration is positive. In general, tracts with more shopping behavior travel more, while those with larger \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d or \u201cBar + Food\u201d latent behavior have smaller commutes and distance traveled. Since our data is projected at the level of the census tract, individual variability is averaged out, and thus, demographic and urban variables are more important to explain the variability in transportation variables. However, our latent behaviors still explain part of how people commute or move around the city, even if we condition on income, race composition, density, or use of public transportation (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 6).\nFinally, we see in Fig. 4 that, although not all of them are relevant, there are a fraction of latent behaviors that have a significant association with health outcomes. As expected, more presence of latent behaviors like \u201cLocal trips\u201d (which include visits to Fast Food venues) is associated with less Physical Activity and more Obesity, while behaviors like \u201cOut and around\u201d or \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d are positively associated with the amount of Physical Activity and the absence of Obesity. However, social and mobility important behaviors like shopping are not significantly related to health outcomes. This is even after controlling\nFigure 4 Relationship of behavioral patterns with social, mobility, and health problems. (A) Bars show the coefficient of each behavior weight (columns) on the different regression models for each social-economic integration, place exploration, the fraction of people with longer than 45 min commute, amount of distance traveled by day, the fraction of people doing daily physical activity, and the fraction of people not having obesity (rows). (B) Bar shows the R2 for each model, including only the demographic variables D, only the mobility behavioral weights M, and both together M + D. Panel (A) correspond to the coefficients for the M + D case. See Additional file 1, Supplementary Note 6 for the complete regression tables\nfor demographic variables like income or race, which are the most critical determinants of those health outcomes [55].\nIn summary, our results show that our latent behaviors that constitute individual lifestyles are significantly correlated with social, transportation, and health outcomes. Different behaviors are related to different dimensions, and in some cases, the importance of latent behaviors is similar to or even surpasses that of demographic variables. For example, knowing that a particular user has extensive shopping or food/coffee behaviors can better explain her economic integration and exploration than knowing her income (see Additional file 1, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Or conditioning on income or population density, we see that some behaviors like \u201cOut and around\u201d or \u201cCoffee Shop\u201d are associated with transportation and health outcomes."

            "text": "Understanding urban problems require a good description of human behavior in cities [1, 56]. Our research shows that the high-dimensional nature of mobility of millions of people visiting millions of places in the U.S. can be projected onto a small set of latent behaviors that capture their routines and habits that result from their choices or opportunities accessible to them. Demographics or urban characteristics cannot fully explain those latent behaviors, and people living in the same neighborhood with the same income, race, or educational levels might have different shopping, working, or leisure latent behaviors, resulting in entirely different lifestyles. Since the composition of the lifestyles is robust across different geographical areas and cities, our results could be used to build\ncharacterizations and compare individuals and groups at different geographical and demographic levels. This could enrich the current Census by including the composition of the different latent behaviors to study urban areas. It could also help in methods of exploiting mobility data by preserving the privacy of individuals. This can be done by computing projected aggregated variables along those latent behaviors rather than detailed and more invasive individual visitation patterns.\nOur latent behaviors describe how people organize their visitation patterns and mobility around the city. For example, we find that people that make trips to errands also visit fast food outlets frequently (\u201cLocal trips\u201d latent behavior), while heavy users of public transportation (bus) also spend much time in the neighborhood and entertainment (\u201cOut and around\u201d). Working life is also related to nightlife. These dependencies show that those latent behaviors represent combined aspects of our life that occur concurrently and which could be used to devise successful holistic interventions to change people\u2019s lifestyles. For example, people that run many errands might choose fast food because they are time-poor or because errands take place around specific food environments (food swamps). Our results can help design public health interventions that incorporate those distinct lifestyles to identify those routines and habits that are most risky for health [57].\nWe note that latent behaviors have a different relationship with social, transportation, and health outcomes. For example, while weekend shopping behaviors are associated with more exposure to economic diversity of urban dwellers, they carry more commuting time and travel distance and, thus, more pollution. Similarly, the \u201cOut and around\u201d latent behavior is associated with longer commutes and more physical activity or the absence of obesity. Since most urban interventions are likely to change the relative weight of those latent behaviors or ultimately change them completely, it is essential to balance the tradeoff among social, transportation, and health outcomes encoded in those behaviors. Also, not all behaviors have the same weight in describing users\u2019 lifestyles. Shopping, food, or working latent behaviors are the most important, suggesting that they are the ones where interventions to change experienced income segregation, transportation, or health outcomes could be more considerable [25].\nOur results show that activity lifestyles are not monolithic groups of homogeneous behavior among people. Our framework of describing lifestyles as a combination of latent behaviors reflects that lifestyles are instead a continuum spectrum of the relative balance between work, shopping, transportation, or leisure time. Given the ubiquitous nature of mobility and activity data from mobile phones, we hope this framework could be used in the future to understand better the rapid and extensive scale changes in other urban areas and cities worldwide.\nSupplementary information Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00390-w.\nAdditional file 1.
