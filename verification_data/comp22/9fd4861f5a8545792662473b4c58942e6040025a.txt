"**This paper represents a step towards reducing the knowledge elicitation bottleneck, but there are limitations to the proposed approach.** It currently focuses only on the interpretation of time series data and anticipates the captured knowledge will reason about trends in data. Furthermore, temporal relationships between multiple data streams are relatively common in condition monitoring data but have not been fully addressed here. For example, seeing an increase in one parameter, flow rate, for example, may result in a corresponding, but delayed increase in value in another parameter, say temperature. Secondly, the elicitation process is still predominantly a human to human process, which is then transferred to the expert system. This data imbalance, where there are often large volumes of normal operating data, and very few instances of failure data is another common challenge, and capture and codification of this diagnostic knowledge in a manner that they can be shared across multiple instances of expert systems remains an open problem."
