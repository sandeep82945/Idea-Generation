However, when computed classically, the total (integrated) scattering cross section \u03c3 is infinite (Ref. 2, Sec. 5.6). An infinite \u03c3 is also obtained for quantum mechanical scattering by an inverse square potential in three spatial dimensions3 (a property shared by Coulomb scattering).\nOn the other hand, in two spatial dimensions the integrated cross section, \u03c3 = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 ( d\u03c3 d\u03b8 )d\u03b8, is finite when computed using quantum\nmechanics. The result for a mono-energetic beam is\n\u03c3 = 2\u03c02m\u03ba\nh\u03352k , (1)\nwhere the incident energy is E = h\u03352k2/(2m). This result follows from a straightforward application of phase-shift analysis for the potential V = \u03ba/r2, upon realizing a peculiar identity involving the sinc function, sinc(z) \u2261 sin (z)/z. A succinct form of the identity in question is\n1 = sin (\u03c0x)\n\u03c0x + 2 \u221e \u2211 l=1\n(\u22121)l sin(\u03c0 \u221a l2 + x2)\n\u03c0 \u221a l2 + x2 . (2)\nNote the \u201cmean\u201d (rms) arguments. Remarkably, all higher powers of x cancel when terms on the RHS are expanded as series in x2, as a consequence of familiar \u03b6(2n) exact values for integer n > 0.\nIn more detail, the scattering amplitude for a plane wave incident on a potential, in two spatial dimensions, is\nf (\u03b8) = \u221a\n2 \u03c0k\n\u221e \u2211\nl=\u2212\u221e eil\u03b8ei\u03b4l sin (\u03b4l). (3)\nFor the case at hand the phase shifts are given exactly by\n\u03b4l = \u03c0 2 ( \u221a l2 \u2212 \u221a l2 + 2m\u03ba/h\u03352) (4)\nwith no k dependence, thereby exhibiting scale invariance in this context.4 The differential cross section is of course d\u03c3/d\u03b8 = \u2223 f (\u03b8)\u22232 which integrates to give the total cross section\n\u03c3 = 4 k\n\u221e \u2211\nl=\u2212\u221e sin2(\u03b4l) = 4 k (sin2[ \u03c0 2\n\u221a 2m\u03ba/h\u03352] + 2 \u221e \u2211 l=1 sin2[ \u03c0 2 ( \u221a l2 + 2m\u03ba/h\u03352 \u2212 l)]). (5)\nJ. Math. Phys. 65, 012104 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0169958 65, 012104-1\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n18 January 2024 22:52:54\nThe final result for \u03c3 therefore follows from the evaluation of this last sum. It is indeed pleasing to find\n\u03c02x2\n4 = sin2( \u03c0x 2 ) + 2 \u221e \u2211 l=1 sin2( \u03c0 2 ( \u221a l2 + x2 \u2212 l)). (6)\nConvergence of the sum follows by Raabe\u2019s test. But it is very surprising that the net contribution of the RHS is only the leading term in the expansion sin2( \u03c0x2 ) = \u03c02x2 4 +O(x 4).\nAs a check on (6), expand each term under the sum, sin2( \u03c02( \u221a l2 + x2 \u2212 l)) = 116 \u03c02x4 l2 +O(x 6). So to leading order the sum gives\n2\u2211\u221el=1 1 16 \u03c02x4 l2 = 1 48 \u03c0 4x4 upon using \u03b6(2) = 16 \u03c0 2. This exactly cancels the next to leading order from the first term on the RHS of (6), namely, sin2( \u03c0x2 ) = 1 4 \u03c0 2x2 \u2212 148 \u03c0 4x4 +O(x6). And so it goes to higher orders in powers of x2, as may be verified by computer, say to O(x100). A formal, perhaps convincing argument that the result is true to all orders in x2 is obtained by interchanging the sum over l with the series expansion sums for the various sin2( \u03c02( \u221a l2 + x2 \u2212 l)), regulating the resulting divergent sums over l by analytic continuation of the \u03b6 function,5 and using \u03b6(\u22122n) = 0 for all integer n > 0. Given that (6) holds for all real x, differentiation or integration produces a set of related results. In particular, 2\u03c02 x d dx applied to both LHS and RHS of (6) gives (2). Alternatively, (2) may be obtained directly using the steps shown in Appendix A. Integration of x \u00d7 (2) then gives (6). Then again, differentiating (2) leads to an identity that can be easily established by a Sommerfeld\u2013Watson transformation, as shown in Appendix B. The results exhibited in (2) and (6), and those in the related set, are not extant in the literature, so far as I have been able to determine, although an engaging survey of other surprising results involving the sinc function can be found in Ref. 6.\nIn closing, a few brief remarks are warranted about the simple form for \u03c3 as given by (1). Since m\u03ba/h\u03352 is a dimensionless parameter, a priori it would be allowed on dimensional grounds to have \u03c3 = f (m\u03ba/h\u03352)/k where the function f need not be linear. Indeed, the sum in (5) is exactly of this form before any simplification. The underlying physical reason that sum actually turns out to be linear in \u03ba is not very clear, and requires further examination. This matter is under study.\nI thank C. Bender and A. Turbiner for discussions and encouragement to write up these results, and I thank T. S. Van Kortryk for checking some of the math.
