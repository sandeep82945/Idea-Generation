This can also lead to a number of microbial diseases, which greatly increases this burden.1,2 Over the past two decades, there have been significant advances in almost every field of science and technology. However, these advanced treatments for microbial infections and cancer are still far from complete. Cancer and bacterial infections undoubtedly pose a serious threat to people's health and present a problem for our society. However, the use of currently available antimicrobial and anticancer medications is limited due to their toxicity and drug resistance.3 An excess of these medications is already on the market to treat various disorders, especially with the development of transitionmetal-based anticancer and antimicrobial prodrugs, which currently show significant promise.

Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between the production and detoxification of free radical species. This condition has the potential to seriously harm proteins, lipids, and DNA, which may result in the emergence of serious diseases. Finding novel metal complexes with both antioxidant and antimicrobial properties is therefore to be encouraged.9 In addition, highly oxidizing compounds that produce ROS include O2\u02d9\n\u2212, H2O2, OH\u02d9, ROOH, ROO\u02d9, HOCl, and 1O2 and O3, which also play essential roles in living systems and induce the death of cancer cells oxidatively. Mitochondria play a major role in controlling the production of ROS for cellular signaling in numerous physiological processes. Compared to normal cells, anticancer drugs demonstrate selectivity for cell targets with abnormal ROS levels, and they kill tumor cells with abnormal redox functioning.10 However, transition metal complexes are crucial to nucleic acid chemistry due to their numerous uses as therapeutic agents, structural probes, footprinting agents, and sequence-specific binding.11 They can also be used as scaffolds for pharmacological agent because of their inertness, stability, distinctive geometries, and structural diversity.12 Moreover, chelation effectively alters both the biological characteristics of the metal moiety and the ligands. The excellent metal chelating abilities of morpholine derivative compounds, which are also regarded as multifaceted ligands owing to their synthetic flexibility and conformational stability, contribute to the enhanced biological activity with the coordination of metal centers. As a result, these compounds are being thoroughly studied in light of their outstanding pharmacological activities.13,14\nFurthermore, the significant effects of transition metal complexes are expected to exhibit their potent effects by a variety of mechanisms, including enzyme inhibition, intracellular biomolecular interactions, increased lipophilicity, modifications to cell membrane functions, and cell cycle arrest. The selectivity of antimicrobial and anticancer drugs is improved by the following mechanisms: disruption of cell membranes and inhibition of nucleic acid/ protein/cell wall synthesis. However, a significant fraction of antibiotics used therapeutically work against tuberculosis by\nspecifically targeting the ribosomal RNA-rich surfaces of ribosomes, and mostly inhibit protein synthesis.15\u201317 Furthermore, DNA serves as the primary target site of action for the majority of anticancer medications. The anticancer property of mononuclear metallodrugs is ascribed to their interacting with DNA either covalently or noncovalently. Covalent interactions take place via labile ligands of complexes that are transferred by the N7 donor atoms of DNA's guanine/adenine bases. The complexes are involved in noncovalent interactions, such as electrostatic, H-bonding, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, which provide further stability to these adducts.18 Subsequently, the bindings of transition metal complexes with DNA/RNA have been widely investigated. The highly positively charged transition metal complexes bind electrostatically with negatively charged DNA and RNA, different phospholipids, and some regions of proteins. Furthermore, targeting and activation tactics can also aid the formation of new antibacterial and anticancer medications with the capability of overcoming the limitations of currently available drugs. Moreover, advanced DFT and molecular docking-based virtual screenings are quite helpful and will undoubtedly enhance our comprehension of the chemical and biological reactivity of medications.19,20 Considering the above-mentioned approaches, a research scheme has been carried out using a pharmacologically active morpholine-linked primary ligand incorporating 2,2\u2032 bipyridine for the synthesis of metal complexes (1\u20133) and the research was extended to comprehend the binding between the metal complexes (1\u20133) and DNA, BSA, and the SARS-CoV2 (3CLPro) protein via molecular docking approaches. They might also support the creation of new, powerful anticancer medications as well as playing a part in the battle against current or prospective viral pandemics."

In a cellular system, DNA base pairs can be broken by a variety of mechanisms, including errors in DNA replication, generation of a heteroduplex during homologous recombination, spontaneous deamination of cytosine, and base pairs broken by mutagens or ionizing radiation, which also lead to improper base pairing and mutations. Also, metal complexes have the capability of recognizing DNA mismatches and may become vital entities for investigation and possibly for clinical applications.55 Moreover, the cleavage of one or both DNA strands is a typical and essential process for maintaining cell viability: during DNA replication and transcription, topoisomerase enzymes correct topological issues, and various nucleases take part in repair mechanisms and DNA degradation, which is one of the distinguishing features of apoptotic programmed cell death. Similarly, several antitumor drugs have the potential to cleave DNA by inducing apoptosis, which eventually leads to cancer cell death. Conversely, molecules that can interact with DNA's major or minor grooves are known as groove-binding molecules, which disrupt and impair the function of the DNA double helix via various non-covalent interactions. The DNA nuclease properties of all samples were assessed in an H2O2 environment by the gel electrophoresis method. DNA cleavage was monitored during the conversion of supercoiled\nplasmids into linear and nicked DNA fragments. Also, the observed DNA nuclease efficacy for all complexes (1\u20133) was compared with the free ligand (HL) and CT-DNA alone. No substantial nuclease activity can be seen in the control (Fig. 1 and S13\u2020) (lane 1; DNA + H2O2) even after a lot of time has passed, and free ligand (HL) (lane 2) was monitored as immobile in an H2O2 environment. Lane 4 shows that complex (2) demonstrates complete DNA cleavage. Similarly, lane 5 reveals that complex (3) undergoes partial DNA cleavage. Also, the performance of band reduction in the lanes was revealed in agarose gel (Fig. 1 and S13\u2020), but lane 3 indicates that complex (1) shows no considerable cleavage efficiency among the series of complexes. Consequently, it is commonly acknowledged that ROS plays a dual physiological role in controlling a variety of illnesses as well as cellular homeostasis (self-regulating processes like thermoregulation, blood glucose regulation, calcium/potassium homeostasis, and osmoregulation).56 Numerous oxidases, peroxidases, lipoxygenases, dehydrogenases, cytochromes P450, and other enzymes have been demonstrated to be able to produce ROS. Additionally, it is widely known that the NADPH oxidase enzyme produces reactive oxygen species as part of its antibacterial effect on phagocytic cells. Nevertheless, these types of enzyme seem to be present in a variety of other cells and may have significant signalling pathway functions. When non-carcinogenic toxicity events occur, ROS has the ability to alter cell function as well as to affect the genesis of cancer at several levels. OH\u02d9 can attack DNA, proteins, and lipids due to its high reactivity among ROS. Also, the hydroxyl radical is a key participant in free-radical-mediated hazardous reactions because of its great reactivity. Free radicals are essential in the redox regulation of many cell signalling pathways and proper cellular functions, and they are only generated in living systems; superoxide (O2\u02d9\n\u2212) was believed to be a typical cellular metabolite. It was then realized that more dangerous radicals could potentially be produced via the Haber\u2013Weiss process. The combination of O2\u02d9\n\u2212 and H2O2 may produce a powerfully reactive OH\u02d9 radical.57 As per the Fenton/Haber\u2013Weiss mechanism, it is suggested that it is\nScheme 1 The proposed structure of complexes (1\u20133) [MII(L)2 (bpy)]."

Additionally, \u02d9OH free radicals abstract the H-atom from the sugar fragment of the DNA base pair to generate sugar radicals. Concerning the location of the hydrogen atom, it rapidly induces hydrolytic nuclease activity at the sugar\u2013phosphate backbone.59 The rapid migration of DNA can lead to transformation of the open circular form into a linear form. Moreover, EDTA facilitates the generation of highly reactive diffusible OH\u02d9 and anions via the Fenton or Haber\u2013Weiss processes and prevents metal ions from interacting with DNA due to the generation of an EDTA\u2013metal system. The diffusible hydroxyl free radicals also stimulate the abstraction of the H-atom from the sugar part of the DNA base pair to generate sugar radicals along with the formation of an adduct with nucleobases. Therefore, DNA cleavage occurs owing to the assault of a diffusible OH\u02d9 on DNA base pairs in the presence of a metal complex environment. The complex serves as an effective catalyst for the production of OH\u02d9 from hydrogen peroxide according to the Fenton mechanism.60 Also, Fe3+ (or M2+) is regenerated by an ascorbate anion (dehydroascorbic acid) into active Fe2+ (or M+), which functions as a reducing agent. Ascorbic acid and ascorbate are both already present in the human body and interconvert with each other. Also, ascorbate is the predominant form at physiological pH. Therefore, Fe2+/ascorbate\u2212 (or M+/ascorbate\u2212) generated hydroxyl radicals are efficiently involved in the DNA damaging process. The following descriptions of the general mechanisms of the metal\u2013EDTA/H2O2 system are shown in Fig. 2 and S14.\u2020 Generally, if the metal complexes have a high efficiency of H-abstraction from the sugar fragment, it\nfacilitates the DNA damaging process. On the other hand, if metal complexes have weak hydrogen abstraction, they have no substantial nuclease activity. It is finally concluded that complex (2) revealed complete DNA cleavage in this case, which may occur due to strong H-abstraction ability.\n3.2.2. Assessment of DNA binding properties using UV-vis absorption titration. Most medications involve intercalation and groove binding via GC (guanine/cytosine)-rich and AT (adenine/thymine)-rich domains, respectively. The interactions were determined experimentally by electronic absorption spectrum titration. Moreover, intercalating binding is indicated by bathochromic and hypochromic shifts in the absorption spectra, whereas groove binding of the complexes with DNA is indicated by hyperchromic shifts in the titration curve.61 Generally, four kinds of non-covalent engagements that can be absolutely critical in the interaction of substances with DNA are most frequently illustrated in the literature: (i) involves a negatively charged phosphate fragment as a result of electrostatic interaction; (ii) influences weak van der Waals force attraction/H-bonding; (iii) interaction of a functional moiety with the grooves (major/ minor) of the double-stranded DNA as a result of a molecule sticking due to general attraction, or as a result of water or H-bonding expulsion, etc.; (iv) the stacked base pairs of natural DNA are intercalated by hydrophobic forces. Nevertheless, substances are engaged in the reaction because of quinine's preferred N-7 position and adenine's N-3 location in DNA. The DNA base pairing may also be prevented due to miscoding. All complexes (1\u20133), including free ligand (HL), were measured both when DNA was present and when it was absent using ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrophotometric absorption titrations in buffer solution with a pH of 7.4 at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 3). The results are also included in Table 1. In this case, all substances were exposed\nFig. 2 Fenton and Haber\u2013Weiss mechanisms for DNA cleavage in the H2O2 environment."

Chem., 2023, 14, 1667\u20131697 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nto two prominent electronic absorption bands of about 260 nm and 335\u2013343 nm, consequent to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transitions of the phenyl chromophore and MLCT, respectively. While the amount of DNA in each compound rises, the interaction of the chemical substance with DNA base pairs generates noticeable alterations in the strength and wavelength of the intra-ligand charge transfer bands. The hypochromic shift of all compounds was observed in the range of 36.16\u201343.46% with 4\u20135 nm red shifts, which occurred due to a diminishing in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition energy and the half-packed electrons of bonding orbitals. In contrast, electrostatic interaction would be possible if the complex\u2013DNA adduct exhibited hyperchromism with a hypsochromic shift.61 Using Wolfe\u2013 Shimmer eqn (1) and (2), Benesi\u2013Hildebrand eqn (3) and (4) and Sakthi\u2013Krause eqn (5) and (6), the observed overall Kb values for all samples were in the following sequence: (2) > (3) > (1) > (HL). Moreover, the observed \u0394G\u00b0b values in all cases were in the range of \u221219.91 to \u221224.83 kJ mol\u22121 (Table 1), which also indicates that the compounds spontaneously intercalate to DNA. However, complex (2) exhibited excellent binding potency compared to others. It is concluded that the co-planarity of the morpholine-linked ligand and complexation of the 2,2\u2032-bipyridine aromatic system with the metal centre promote the ability of the complex to infiltrate DNA base pairs smoothly. Large aromatic systems may also assist the complex to deeply\npenetrate the core of the phosphate backbone, and those substances may permit the complex to freely penetrate deep into the DNA base pairs. In addition, the observed isosbestic points are found at 285 nm for free ligand and 256, 276 nm for complex (3), respectively. This also suggests that DNA and complexes establish a dynamic equilibrium and it can be further concluded that complexes (1\u20133) spontaneously intercalate into DNA. The Wolfe\u2013Shimmer eqn (1) and (2),62 Benesi\u2013Hildebrand eqn (3) and (4),63 and Sakthi\u2013Krause eqn (5) and (6) were applied to evaluate the Kb results for all samples, which were obtained by modification of the Lineweaver\u2013Burk and Stern\u2013Volmer equations (Table 1).\nThe Kb values were measured using the Wolfe\u2013Shimmer eqn (1) and (2) from the linear regression plots of [DNA]/(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5f) vs. [DNA] M\n\u22121 for method I and (\u03b5b \u2212 \u03b5f)/(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5f) vs. 1/[DNA] M\u22121 for method II, respectively (Fig. S15\u2020). The Benesi\u2013 Hildebrand binding constant (Kb) values were measured using eqn (3) and (4) from the linear regression plots of [1/(Ax \u2212 A0)] vs. {1/[DNA]} M\u22121 for method I and [(Amax \u2212 A0)/(Ax \u2212 A0)] vs. {1/[DNA]} M\n\u22121 for method II, respectively (Fig. S16\u2020).

In addition, A0 and A represent the absorbance intensity values in the absence and presence of [DNA], respectively.

Complex (2) had the highest DNA binding efficacy among all the binding results. The DNA cleavage, emission, hydrodynamic, and CV measurements all support the preceding observations.\n3.2.3. Assessment of thermal denaturation characteristics. The DNA double helix is primarily sustained by base-pair stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds between purines and pyrimidines on opposing strands. The stabilizing bonds that keep the DNA double helix together are broken when the temperature rises, causing both strands to separate. This process is known as the thermal denaturation of DNA. The melting temperature (Tm) of DNA is the temperature at which\none half of the double helix denatures into a single strand. The cooperative unwinding is also denoted helix-coil or melting transition (temperature of midtransition), which is further measured from the derivative melting curve between temperature (\u00b0C) and dA260/dT (Fig. S19 and S19a\u2020). Generally, Tm is measured from the absorption values at a wavelength of 260 nm between 50 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C. Moreover, DNA denaturation is caused not only by heat but also by organic solvents like formamide and DMSO, raising the pH of the solution, lowering the concentration of salt, etc.64 DNA denaturation plays a role as a root cause of a number of chronic diseases, hereditary disorders, and a reduction in the ability of DNA repair to work properly. Thermal denaturation experiments are frequently used to determine the stability of a compound. When a sample is heated, the absorbance characteristics frequently change, reflecting a conformational change in the molecules in solution.

Proteins typically undergo irreversible denaturation. But nucleic acids frequently undergo renaturation when the sample is cooled. Most often, thermal denaturation tests can be performed with an absorption spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm as a function of temperature.65,66 Also, the biothermodynamic properties were further studied to determine the ability to stabilize the double-stranded DNA and this study offers details on the structural alterations, the degree of the DNA\u2013compound system, the external bindingmediated neutralization of the phosphate charges on DNA, and the stacking interactions, all of which work together to raise the melting point of DNA.67 Moreover, small molecules are involved in the reaction due to DNA's preferred N-7 site\nfor guanine and N-3 for adenine. Therefore, it is possible to block the DNA double helix, which causes miscoding of DNA. In this case, it is observed that complex\u2013DNA adducts have higher melting temperature than free DNA. Complex-bound DNA is more challenging to melt than DNA alone because it is involved in powerful intercalation binding with DNA. The van't Hoff eqn (9), Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz eqn (10) and (10a), van't Hoff plot eqn (10b) and theoretical melting temperature eqn (10c) for various nucleotides were supportive in evaluating the biothermodynamic parameters, which are listed in Table 2.

Thus, the technique is also supportive of both detecting binding constants and relative binding strengths. The transition midpoint of this curve yields the value of Tm for Ct-DNA alone, which was measured at 68 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and the observed Tm values of the DNA\u2013 substance adduct were in the following sequence: (2) 78 \u00b0C > (3) 77 \u00b0C > (1) 76 \u00b0C > (HL) 74 \u00b0C and the value of \u0394Tm: (EB) (13 \u00b0C) > (2) 10 \u00b0C > (3) 9 \u00b0C > (1) 8 \u00b0C > (HL) 6 \u00b0C. In general, \u0394Tm > 8 \u00b0C denotes an intercalative mode of binding, while \u0394Tm < 8 \u00b0C represents the groove and/or electrostatic binding mode(s) in the DNA\u2013compound adduct.66,67 In this case, all observed values were greater than 8 \u00b0C except for the ligand (HL) (Fig. S19, S19a\u2020 and Table 2). Also, the binding process is mostly enthalpy-driven and involves hydrogen bonding, as indicated by the negative value of \u0394H\u00b0. Van der Waals interaction may have played a role in the creation of the complex, as shown by the negative value of \u0394S\u00b0.68 As per Ross and colleagues, the findings for \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 can alternatively be derived in the following favourable sequence. If \u0394H\u00b0 > 0 and \u0394S\u00b0 > 0, intercalation is attributed to hydrophobic forces of attraction. If \u0394H\u00b0 < 0 and \u0394S\u00b0 < 0, weak van der Waals forces of attraction and H-bonding interactions are involved. On the other hand, \u0394H\u00b0 < 0 (or \u0394H\u00b0 \u2248 0) and \u0394S\u00b0 > 0 indicates that electrostatic modes of binding are possible between DNA and compounds.69 The measured values for all the samples were exposed to the favourable sequence \u0394H\u00b0 < 0 and \u0394S\u00b0 < 0, which is assumed to be due to weak van der Waals forces of attraction and H-bonding between DNA and chemical substances. However, they lose the ability to rotate and translate, interfere with counter ions and hydrophobic forces in compound\u2013DNA adducts, which may result in exothermically active negative signals of \u0394S\u00b0 and \u0394H\u00b0. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged that hydration and the generation of the compound\u2013DNA adduct system via the counter-ion liberating mechanism are highly dependent on hydrophobic forces of attraction. As a result, higher negative results of \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 for all substances that interacted with DNA were observed in the experiments.70\nAccording to the Ross and Subramanian mechanism for protein/DNA\u2013complex interactions, it is obviously revealed that the complexation of the metal center with the morpholine-fused primary aromatic and 2,2\u2032-bipyridine secondary aromatic planar systems stimulates the silky penetration of the complex which is sandwiched within DNA base pairs. The stability of the complex is optimized by \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, including a number of non-covalent molecular interactions like dipole\u2013dipole interaction, weak van der Waals forces of attraction, formation of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces of attraction, ionic interactions between positively charged groups of the complex and DNA phosphate groups; reduction of Coulombic repulsion between the DNA phosphate groups is associated with the increasing distance between the helix unwinding bases, etc.\nIn general, cationic species are more effective DNA intercalators due to their improved initial interactions with the negatively charged DNA sugar\u2013phosphate backbone as well as the fact that intercalation releases counter ions (Na+) associated with phosphate groups, which is known as the polyelectrolyte effect. This is a crucial driving force for intercalation due to the reduction in repulsive interactions between the closely spaced charged counter ions. In actuality, the majority of intercalating molecules are either positively charged or have basic groups that can undergo protonation under physiological conditions. According to Chaires' research, the thermodynamic properties of drug\u2013DNA bindings have a substantial influence on bimolecular complex formation. Altering the DNA configurations resulted in a significant decrease in the binding enthalpies of all intercalators, with the exception of actinomycin. While the cationic molecule binds with the DNA base pair, it exchanges the reduced counter ions from the dense interior surface layer and defuses the exterior surface layer of neighbouring DNA. It also reduces the regional charge density. Another type of molecular interaction is the counter-ion liberating mechanism in DNA-binding complexes. As a result of the cumulative complex\u2013DNA interaction, the entropy and enthalpy change significantly decrease.71 Moreover, from the van't Hoff plot of lnKb vs. 1/T (K\n\u22121), it has been revealed that the negative \u0394H\u00b0, \u0394S\u00b0 and \u0394G\u00b0 values of the complex\u2013DNA adduct can be attributed to complexes (1\u20133) spontaneously intercalating DNA with exothermic and spontaneous processes. Thus, these large negative enthalpy and entropy changes are properties of the interaction through intercalation, which is further stabilized by other noncovalent interactions in the double helix of DNA (Fig. S20\u2020). Additionally, the intercalation of the compound between DNA bases causes a large negative entropy change, which is attributed to the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom. As a result, it is concluded that H-bonds and van der Waals interactions, which can occur both electrostatically and through intercalation, significantly aided the binding of the complex to DNA and overall stability.\n3.2.4. Assessment of DNA binding affinity using viscometric techniques. The viscometric technique is one of the most effective and dependable methods for determining binding strength and the mechanism of interaction between a chemical substance and DNA. Generally, when the major/ minor groove binding, electrostatic, partial, and non-classical interaction modes are involved between chemical substances and DNA base pairs, the final DNA relative viscosity remains unchanged or undergoes a very negligible change due to reducing the contour length of DNA. When the intercalation binding modes are involved between a chemical substance and DNA base pairs via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions and hydrophobic forces, an increase in relative viscosity is noted due to a rise in the contour length of DNA. Moreover, for the purpose of observing alterations in the CT-DNA helical structure, the viscosity findings for CT-DNA, various concentrations of chemical substances present, and EtBr"

It was also noted that the absolute viscosity rose consistently along with the incremental concentration of each substance at the fixed DNA concentration. As a result of the strong binding mode of intercalation, the contour length of the double-helix DNA rises.72 The obtained results are also compared with those of the classical intercalator (EB). The affinity interaction and their slope values were observed from the relative specific viscosity (\u03b7/\u03b70)\n1/3 plotted as a straight line contrasting [compound]/[DNA] and absolute specific viscosity of DNA in the presence or absence of chemical substances was evaluated using eqn (11) (Table 3). In the experiment, it was clearly noted that the slope values for all samples increased due to the rising binding affinity. The evaluated slopes were in the following sequence: (EB) 1.215 > (2) 0.860 > (3) 0.801 > (1) 0.662 > (HL) 0.490 (Fig. S21\u2020 and Table 3). However, complex (2) exhibited superior binding affinity to the others and was substantially smaller than EB. Due to the existence of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine and the morpholine-fused aromatic planar systems, compounds can interact with DNA robustly via intercalation. The outcomes agreed with the observed outcomes of electronic absorption spectral characteristics.\n3.2.5. Assessment of DNA/BSA binding characteristics using emission titration. Fluorescence emission spectral titration is an efficient approach to evaluating the binding properties of DNA/BSA biomolecules. In general, the fluorescence of EB is quite weak in aqueous solution, but when it is bound to DNA, the fluorescence intensity rises. However, it is a well-known imperative intercalator and is more supportive in distinguishing the binding strength of non-fluorescence test substances. Also, the fluorescence emission spectra of the EB\u2013DNA adduct were examined at 610 nm in the absence and presence of rising quantities of each test compound. When the complex concentration (0\u2013 240 \u03bcM) rises, the fluorescence intensity of the EB-bound\nDNA complex diminishes owing to the displacement of EB from CT-DNA. A notable reduction in the fluorescence emission intensity at 610 nm is observed (Fig. S26\u2020 and Table 4). The photoelectron shift from DNA's guanine base to the excited states may be the cause of the frequency quenching in the emission of the test substance by DNA. Additionally, after each compound was added to EB, no additional peaks were noted, which shows that EB did not cause any quenching of its free fluorescence emission and proves that the compounds did not interact with EB. The intensity of the band significantly decreased as increasing amounts of each test substance were added to the fixed concentration of the EB\u2013DNA adduct, demonstrating the ability of the investigated compounds to displace bound EB from DNA. Therefore, the competitive binding experiment can make use of EB as a fluorescent probe. Also, the addition of each molecule results in a diminution in the relative emission intensity of EB\u2013DNA, which reveals that complex (2) demonstrates maximum efficiency, which is consistent with their binding capacities. A reasonable quenching in fluorescence intensity showed that complexes could connect with CT-DNA through intercalation and compete with EB for binding.73 This is further evidence that complexes (1\u20133) strongly bind intercalatively with DNA. The observed results agree well with the data from electronic absorption spectral measurements. Additionally, the experiment was extended to examine the binding properties between the test substance and BSA. BSA mostly contains three amino acid residues (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine), which give it its inherent fluorescence. There are two tryptophan residues in BSA: Trp-134 is located in the IB subdomain, which is revealed to have a hydrophilic environment, and Trp-214 is located in the IIA subdomain. These two residues also have minimal quenching effects. Tryptophan in BSA fluoresces mostly because of a residue that is trapped inside a hydrophobic cavity. Therefore, it is crucial to model potential binding interactions with the metal complexes. Additionally, they exhibit tryptophan fluorescence at 278 nm for excitation and 350 nm for maximal emission. The fluorescence intensity also reduces while the test substances (1\u20133) are steadily blended with the BSA solution, proving that complexes (1\u20133) interact with BSA via altering the protein's secondary structure, which also leads to an alteration in the tryptophan environment of BSA (Fig. S27\u2020). Furthermore, BSA structural similarities share 76% sequence identity with human serum albumin (HSA), the most prevalent protein in blood plasma that transports ions and proteins to cells and tissues. HSA is able to readily crystallize under the trivalent cations, but BSA has no ready crystallizing property. However, they consist of parallel physicochemical properties to each other.74,75 Additionally, the Stern\u2013Volmer eqn (12) and (13) were employed to analyze the data (Fig. S28\u2020 and Table 4). Additionally, the kq values for DNA and BSA binding were acquired in the range of 1.1636\u20132.8863 \u00d7 1012 and 2.6390\u2013 7.0774 \u00d7 1012 mol\u22121 s\u22121, respectively.

Therefore, it is assumed that the static quenching process was brought on by adduct construction between the test compounds and BSA rather than a dynamic collision. However, fluorescence spectroscopy is generally plagued by the inner filter effect (IFE), disturbing spectral analysis. The energizing ray is attenuated due to the highly concentrated solution sample. As a result, strong fluorescence is only seen on surfaces facing the excitation beam. The fluorescence intensity is reduced as a result of an inner filter effect generated by absorption of the excitation/ emission wavelengths by some chemicals in the UV region. The results of the absorption wavelengths of all compounds in the range 335\u2013336 nm, and the BSA excitation and\nemission wavelengths of 278 nm and 350 nm, respectively, were monitored to assess the effect of IFE in this approach, and neither of them responded to the IFE, as evident from their extremely low values of absorbance. However, in order to measure the biomolecule quenching constants using the Stern\u2013Volmer equations, the inner filter effect must be taken into account. Eqn (12) was employed to resolve IFE during this experiment.76 The fluorescence emission intensities of ethidium bromide interacted with DNA at 610 nm and those of BSA at 350 nm and exhibited a distinctly reducing movement with increasing concentrations of the test compounds when the IFE was resolved, indicating that after being replaced with the substances, a few ethidium bromide\nTable 4 Determination of Kb and n values for all substances with EB\u2013DNA at pH of 7.4 by fluorescence spectral titration\nCompounds\nBinding constants for DNA/BSA with test compounds\nSV methods for determining DNA binding characteristics (SV methods for determining BSA binding characteristics)*\nLWB method KLB \u00d7 104 M\u22121\nScatchard analysis\nKapp \u00d7 107 M\u22121\nMethod-I Method-II\nKq \u00d7 10 12 M\u22121 s\u22121 KSV \u00d7 10 4 M\u22121 Kass \u00d7 10 4 M\u22121 n \u0394G\u00b0b (kJ M\n\u22121) P KSA \u00d7 104 M\u22121 n\n(HL) 1.1636 (2.639) 1.1636 (2.639) 0.9606 (1.062) 0.973 (0.926) \u22122.720 (\u221223.0) 0.0899 (0.464) 0.6985 1.9093 1.158 0.5829 (1) 1.6755 (4.651) 1.6755 (4.651) 1.1954 (2.005) 1.037 (0.954) \u22123.261 (\u221224.5) 0.0902 (0.287) 0.7149 3.0094 0.983 0.5926 (2) 2.8863 (7.074) 2.8863 (7.074) 3.2903 (5.455) 1.104 (1.018) \u22125.770 (\u221227.0) 0.1516 (0.385) 1.3497 3.3185 1.056 0.8349 (3) 1.6879 (4.8055) 1.6879 (4.806) 1.0350 (5.292) 1.024 (1.051) \u22122.905 (\u221226.9) 0.0950 (0.348) 0.7786 3.2363 0.971 0.7340\nKSV denotes the Stern\u2013Volmer binding constant; Kass represents the association binding constant; Kapp represents the apparent binding constant, Kapp \u00bc KEB EB\u00bd compound\u00bd \u00bc 500 compound\u00bd ; KEB = 10 7 M\u22121 at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM EB; Gibb's free energy change \u0394Gb\u00b0 \u00bc \u2013RT lnKass; Kq represents the bimolecular quenching rate constant/Stern\u2013Volmer dynamic quenching rate constant Kq \u00bc KSV \u03c40 , average lifetime of biomolecular quenching in the absence of a quencher (\u03c40) = 10 \u22128 S; Gibb's free energy change \u0394Gb\u00b0 \u00bc \u2013RT lnKass (where R = 8.3144 kJ mol\u22121, T = 298 K); KLB represents the Lineweaver\u2013Burk (LWB) binding constant; KSA represents the Scatchard association binding constant; Kapp denotes the apparent binding constant; n is the number of binding sites; P is the ratio of fluorescence quantum efficiency of DNA bound and free complexes P \u00bc \u03a6b \u03a6 f , which is obtained as the intercept from the plot F/F0 vs. 1/[DNA]; error limit \u00b1 2.5% (P < 0.025).\nFcorr = Fobs \u00d7 e [(Aex\u00d7dex) + (Aem\u00d7dem)]/2 = Fobs \u00d7 e (Aex+Aem)/2; (12)\nwhere Fcorr and Fobs represents the IFE-corrected fluorescence and observed (uncorrected) emission intensities, respectively; dex and dem denote the cuvette path lengths in the excitation and emission directions, respectively; Aex and Aem represent the change in absorbance at the excitation and fluorescence wavelengths, respectively.\nF0 F \u00bc 1\u00fe KSV Q\u00bd \u00bc 1\u00fe Kq\u03c40; (13)\nwhere [Q] is represented as the sample concentration, the emission intensities F0 and F of DNA/BSA in the absence and presence of the quencher (sample), respectively.\nF0 F \u2212 1 \u00bc F0 \u2212 F F \u00bc KSV Q\u00bd ; log F0 \u2212 FF \u00bc logKass \u00fe n log Q\u00bd ; (14)\nKEB[EB] = Kapp[compound]; (15)\n1 F0 \u2212 F \u00bc 1 F0KLB Q\u00bd \u00fe 1 F0 ; (16)\n\u03b3\nCF\n\u00bc KSC n \u2212 \u03b3\u00f0 \u00de; (17)\nwhere \u03b3 = [(F0 \u2212 F)/F0], and CF denotes the concentration of the sample alone."

Additionally, no emission spectrum shifting was seen following the BSA\u2013complex adduct, indicating that groundstate BSA\u2013compound systems formed as a result of a static quenching mechanism (Fig. S27\u2020). Hence, IFE was resolved by observing the emission spectral changes of EB\u2013DNA with the incremental concentrations of all test compounds (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 \u03bcM) in Tris\u2013HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.2). Also, the emission spectral alterations of BSA were evaluated with incremental concentrations of all test compounds from 2.5 \u03bcM to 25 \u03bcM in Tris\u2013HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.2). In all cases, the observed R2 values for the linear plots of F0/F vs. [Q] and log(F0 \u2212 F)/F vs. log[Q] by Stern\u2013Volmer (SV) methods I and II were almost 1, which is also a significant factor for measuring the impact of the inner filter effect. Moreover, it was observed that BSA might interact with complexes and that the polarity of BSA's fluorescence did not vary noticeably with complex titration. These findings, which were in agreement with the UV-vis spectral data, can be interpreted as the intercalation mode of the complexes between DNA base pairs and bovine serum albumin. The following Stern\u2013Volmer eqn (13)\u2013(15) were employed to determine the KSV, Kq, and n values. The KSV values were measured from the linear regression plot of F0/F vs. [Q] by SV method I (Fig. S22 and S28\u2020). Eqn (14) was employed to evaluate the n and Kass values.\n77 Similarly, Kapp (apparent binding constant) values for all samples were estimated with eqn (15) (Table 4).\nThe findings for Kass and n were evaluated from the linear regression plot of log(F0 \u2212 F)/F vs. log[Q] by SV method II with the help of eqn (14) (Fig. S22, S28\u2020 and Table 4). \u03b5 findings of all substances were observed from the linear regression plot of emission intensity vs. [compound] with the help of the Beer\u2013Lambert law equation (A = \u03b5cl) (Fig. S25\u2020) and eqn (15) is applied to evaluate Kapp values using KEB = 10\n7 M\u22121 at 50 \u03bcM concentration and to measure the sample concentrations for all cases using the Beer\u2013Lambert law equation. The complex concentration's IC50 findings were estimated at a 50 percentage diminution in the emission intensity of ethidium bromide. The Lineweaver\u2013Burk eqn (16) and Scatchard analysis eqn (17) are utilized to expand the observations and validate the binding affinities78,79 and the observations are also compared with the Stern\u2013Volmer method. Eqn (16) was used to determine the value of KLB from the linear regression plot of 1/(F0 \u2212 F) vs. 1/[Q] (Fig. S22\u2020). KSA and n values were also measured from the linear regression plot of (\u03b3/CF) vs. \u03b3 by eqn (17) (Fig. S23\u2020) and the overall measured DNA/BSA binding constants (KSV, Kass, Kapp, KLB and KSC) for all samples were in the following order: (2) > (3) > (1) > (HL). The n values acquired from the Stern\u2013Volmer eqn (14) and the Scatchard eqn (17) were in the range of 0.9733\u20131.1040 and 0.9711\u20131.1580, respectively, for all compounds (Table 4). In addition, the neighbor-exclusion principle is one of the most imperative and well-known rules governing the intercalative binding of small planar molecules to DNA. It\nimplies that such binding is only possible at base-pair sites where there is an opposite base pairing, which indicates extremely negative cooperativity in the binding process. This rule states that the two neighboring sites of an occupied intercalation site in DNA must stay unoccupied, or, in less absolute terms, intercalation is negative-cooperative (anticooperative) at adjacent sites. In other words, the nextneighbor (second) intercalation site along the length of the DNA double helix remains unoccupied. Moreover, the neighbor-exclusion principle is a vibrational entropy effect, which is associated with polyelectrolyte (counterion release) effects and further demonstrated with negative cooperativity effects in ethidium and actinomycin binding to DNA.80 However, the highly stable complexes observed with CT-DNA, poly[d(A\u2013T)], d(CCGGAATTCCGG), and d(CGCGAATTCGCG) all have dissociation constants in the range of 1 to 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u22121. On CT-DNA, these complexes develop at a rate of around 1 binding site every 100 base pairs. The neighbor-exclusion principle for intercalation binding modes states clearly that the number of binding sites (n) depends on the character of the intercalators and their neighboring environments. When the first small molecules interact with the binding site of DNA, intercalation occurs with or without allowing the second small molecule. If the first binding intercalator increases the affinity of the second site, there is positive cooperativity (n > 1) due to the support of other non-covalent interactions. This case violates the neighbor-exclusion rule. If the first binding intercalator decreases the affinity of the second site, there is negative cooperativity (n < 1). On the other hand, if there is no impact on the second site, there is non-cooperativity (n \u2248 1).81 Later, two cases obey the neighbor-exclusion rule. However, our present complexes show better intercalation binding affinity than a free ligand owing to the value of n being nearly equal to one (Table 4). Consequently, it is proposed that the complexes contain both a 2,2\u2032-bipyridine ring planar system and an aromatic ring system linked with morpholine. They can effectively interact with DNA via intercalation. Additionally, the values of the fluorescence quantum efficiency (P) ratio for the DNA and BSA\u2013complex adducts were 0.0899\u20130.1516 and 0.2870\u20130.4640, respectively, which were measured from the linear regression plot of F/F0 vs. 1/[DNA] and 1/[BSA], respectively (Fig. S24, S29\u2020 and Table 4). These results and those from the viscosity, electrochemical titration, and UV-vis spectral properties were in good agreement.\n3.2.6. F\u00f6rster's theory-based FRET computation. FRET is a non-destructive spectroscopic method consisting of a process between several electronic excited states of molecules that is dependent on distance (r). FRET can also be employed to distinguish the relative angular orientation and closeness of fluorophores.82 The process happens when there is a large overlap between the absorption spectrum acceptor (compound/chromophore) and the donor's emission spectrum (BSA/fluorophore) (Fig. S30\u2020).

The following conditions have a major impact on the effectiveness of FRET: (i) the distance (r) should be in the prescribed range of 2\u20138 nm for energy transfer; (ii) there is a large overlap between the emission spectrum of biomolecules (donors) and the electronic absorption spectrum of acceptors (substances); and (iii) the BSA and compound transition dipoles are oriented correctly. BSA transmits excitation energy to a compound during FRET without emitting a photon from the previous molecule system. Energy transfer (E) results were acquired from eqn (18) (Table 5). K2 is associated with the geometry of the BSA and complex of the dipoles, the value for random orientation (K2 = 2/3) as in a fluid solution. Basically, the K 2 values were\nfound in the range from 0 to 4, and energy can be transferred from BSA to the compound when electrons are transferred between the two molecules. For parallel transition dipoles that are aligned, K2 is equal to 4, which denotes maximal energy transfer; and when the orientation of the dipoles is perpendicular to one another, K2 is equal to 0, which denotes very weak energy transfer. When the relative orientation of the dipoles is random, K2 is equal to 2/3. Eqn (20) is helpful for measuring the J values for overlap of the emission spectrum of BSA with the electronic absorption spectrum of the compound. The molar absorption coefficient (\u03b5A) and fluorescence emission intensity were both measured on the unit area scale of wavenumbers. It is imperative that J, after being normalized, is independent of the real size of \u03b5A.

The observed values of R0 and r between BSA Trp213 and the interacting compound were substantially smaller than 8 nm and their relationships are found in the following sequence: 0.5R0 (1.2200\u20131.2786) < r (2.4127\u20132.7128) < 1.5R0 (3.6601\u2013 3.8358). The test substance and BSA had a high probability of exchanging non-radiative dipole\u2013dipole energy, which was consistent with a static quenching process. This result proved that the binding adhered to the conditions of F\u00f6rster's energy transfer theory. \u03a6 is defined as the dimensionally invariant ratio of photons emitted to photons completely absorbed by a fluorophore, and it serves as a tool for estimating the effectiveness of fluorescence emission in correlation with all other channels of relaxation. Also, \u03c4 is denoted as the lifetime of fluorescence emission of the biomolecule and is described as the inverse of the entire degradation rate \u03c4 = 1/(kr + knr). The radiative lifetime of the fluorophore is represented as \u03c40 = 1/kr. The values of \u03c4 and \u03a6 are associated with eqn (21) (Table 5). Quenching occurs when the ground or excited states of BSA come into contact with a compound in the solution. The intensity of fluorescence emission is also decreasing. Quenching is divided into the two main categories of dynamic and static quenching. While BSA is in an excited state, it binds with the substance during a dynamic or collisional quenching mechanism, and is then deactivated to the ground state without the emission of radiation. Therefore, the concentration of the quenching compounds affects dynamic quenching. The \u03c4 and \u03a6 values for BSA diminish with an increase in the compound concentration. Conversely, static quenching reduces fluorescence emission without changing the excited state \u03c4 or \u03a6, and quenching can be divided into two main categories based on the excited-state lifetime of the fluorophore. Additionally, the term kq[Q] is included in the denominator in eqn (21) and the \u03a6 value for the BSA\u2013compound adduct system is measured with eqn (21). FRET requires an interaction between the emission and absorption transition dipole moments of BSA and the test compound, respectively, due to the non-radiative transfer of excitation energy from a fluorophore to a chromophore.83 kET is dependent on not only the overlapped spectrum of emission of BSA and the absorbance of the compound but also on the \u03a6 values of BSA, K2 and r, etc. The kET values for all substances were estimated with eqn (22) (Table 5). K is denoted as a relative factor of the specific orbital interactions between BSA and substances based on orbital overlap. The F\u00f6rster radius is the distance at which resonance energy transfer is 50% proficient (R0).\n84 Also, the brightness of BSA depends on the ability of a test compound to absorb light and the \u03a6 value, which is calculated with expression eqn (23). Chemical compounds with high absorbance have higher values for \u03b5 and \u03a6, which also promote effective emission.\n3.2.7. Analysis of DNA binding characteristics using the CV method. The CV approach is one of the most important methods for evaluating the binding mechanism of a DNA\u2013 complex adduct. The CV properties of all test samples in\nthe presence and absence of DNA were executed at a scan rate (v) of 0.1 V s\u22121 with a potential range of +2 to \u22122 in a Tris\u2013HCl (5 mM)/NaCl (50 mM) (pH = 7.2) solution. The M1+/M2+ redox couple is caused by complexes that reveal a single anodic and cathodic peak. The complex's reaction with the one-step, one-electron process demonstrated by the glassy carbon electrode surface, is a quasi-reversible redox process since the (Ipa/Ipc) ratio values for the redox couple are about one, which is also supported by the change in peak potential separation (Ep > 0.0591 V)85\u201387 (Fig. S31\u2020 and Table 6).\nWhile the substances often bind to DNA through intercalation, the peak potential shifts in a positive direction. When the compounds bind to DNA through minor or major grooves or electrostatic attractions, the peak potential shifts occur in a negative direction. It was observed that the consistent movement of peak potential shifts in the positive direction during increments of DNA with test substances. The binding mode in compound\u2013DNA adducts has been described as primarily intercalation (Fig. S31\u2020), and it is also attributed to the presence of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine and morpholine fused aromatic planar systems in mixed ligand complexes, which can create inclusion through intercalation due to hydrophobic and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions in the DNA base pairs. It is also supported by the evaluated outcomes from UV-vis spectral, emission titration, viscometric, and biothermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the observed values of Kb, S, and the ratio of binding constants (K\n1+/K2+) for M1+/M2+ couple systems further confirmed the binding affinity via intercalation. Also, the subsequent eqn (24)\u2013(35) are applied to determine the above parameters.88,89 Eqn (24) is acquired from modification of the Stern\u2013Volmer eqn (14) (Table 6). The Kb values for all samples were estimated from the linear regression plot of log(1/[DNA]) versus log(I/I0 \u2212 I) by method I (Fig. S32\u2020 and Table 6). Eqn (26) was obtained from revision of eqn (25). Also, binding site size (S, bp) and Kb are estimated from eqn (30) from the linear regression plot of (Cp/Cf) versus [DNA] by method-II\n90\u201392 (Fig. S33\u2020 and Table 6). In addition, base-pair sites with a molecule of the compound are referred to as \u201cbinding site size\u201d (S), and the evaluated S values were found in the range from 0.1718 to 0.4599 bp. In general, if the S value is less than 1, it denotes stronger binding through intercalation, and if the S value is greater than 1, this suggests the possibility of the modes of groove binding or electrostatic interactions.93\u201397 The S value also suggests that there should be one binding site for every two base pairs, denoting that complex (1a) has revealed superior binding efficiency to the others owing to its robust binding affinity with DNA through intercalation, and its measured results for S were also in the range of 0.1250\u20130.4520 bp (Table 6). It can therefore be stated that a compound or medication exhibits high binding affinity when it occupies a single binding site. Meanwhile, the drug\u2013DNA adduct exhibits low binding affinity when many site sizes are increased at the same time.98 In the Nernst eqn (31) and (32) for the galvanic cell, E\u00b0s \u00bc E\u00b0b \u2212E\u00b0f , the formal electrode"

As a result of the variable binding state [M1+/M2+] and the delayed mass transfer of test compounds that interacted with DNA fragments, the addition of DNA to the compound solution enabled a change in the redox potential to a higher positive direction and a drop in both anodic and cathodic peak currents. In particular, the equilibrium of M1+/M2+ is influenced by electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. However, the E\u00b0s values of M\n1+/M2+ for all substances were observed to be positive values (Table 6). This suggests that the compounds' strong hydrophobicity makes their interactions with DNA through intercalation more favorable. On the other hand, if the value of E\u00b0s is negative, this indicates that the substance interacts more favourably with DNA through electrostatic interactions, and K1+ and K2+ are represented as binding constants for the binding states of the +1 and +2 chemical substances to DNA respectively. The number of electron transfers is given by n, which is equal to one. With the aid of eqn (25), K[red]/K[oxi] values for reduction and oxidation processes were determined from the linear regression plot of log(1/[DNA]) versus log(I/I0 \u2212 I) (method I), which was also estimated using the Nernst eqn (32) (Table 6). Generally, the DNA\u2013compound adduct is assigned the groove binding or electrostatic binding interaction when the value of the ratio [K1+/K2+] is equal to one. When the value of the ratio is less than or greater than one, it demonstrates that the mode of intercalation binding could take place in the DNA\u2013 compound system owing to hydrophobic forces of attraction.99,100 The following mechanism led to the latter finding in the compound\u2013DNA systems (Table 6).\nThe Kb value was evaluated from the reciprocal of the slope in the linear regression plot of I2p versus (I 2 po \u2212 I2p)/[DNA] with the help of method III (Fig. S34\u2020 and Table 6). In these cases, complex (2) shows greater binding effectiveness than the others owing to its robust binding affinity with DNA through intercalation. As a result, it is proposed that complexes consist of an aromatic planar system linked with a morpholine moiety as well as 2,2\u2032-bipyridine planar systems that may firmly interact with DNA through intercalation, which is also confirmed by the value of the diffusion coefficient (D0) of the compound alone and the DNA-bound compound with the aid of the subsequent quasi-reversible Randles\u2013Sevcik eqn (34),101 which is a typical approximation for numerous quasi-reversible systems for the redox (M1+/ M2+) process. The values of Ipa and \u03b1 were also measured from eqn (35) and (35a) (Table 6).102 When all compounds were treated with DNA, the anodic and cathodic peak currents of M(I)/M(II) reduced due to a decrease in the diffusion coefficient (D0). The findings obviously suggested that the evaluated values of D0 of DNA-bound compounds were less than those of the free test compounds. The values of D0 of all samples in the absence and presence of DNA at scan rates of 0.01\u20130.3 V s\u22121 were measured from the linear regression plots of fIpa vs. v 1/2 and bIpa vs. v 1/2 using eqn (35)103\u2013105 (Fig. S35\u2020 and Table 6)."

            "text": "Electronic absorption titration analysis can be used to determine the types of quenching mechanisms, which are classified into two main categories: static and dynamic. In this case, when the concentration of each test compound increases, the BSA absorption intensity also increases with a noticeable blue shift, suggesting that the interactions between BSA and the complexes are static rather than dynamic. BSA is a crucial plasma protein that transports different endogenous and exogenous proteins, hormones, ions, and medications, as well as helping to maintain blood pH and osmotic blood pressure. BSA contains 583 amino acids and has a spherically organized protein structure. Two tryptophan residues in BSA, tryptophan-134 and tryptophan213, are primarily responsible for the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. Fig. 4 displays the electronic absorption spectra of BSA at various concentrations of test compounds in Tris\u2013 HCl buffer solution. An increase in absorption maxima along with the blue (hypsochromic) shift were observed when the concentration of test compounds was raised from 0 to 25 \u03bcM in the absorption titration of BSA. Owing to the presence of aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, on the surface of the protein chain, the absorption maxima at 278 nm are attributed to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition. The chemical substance interacts with Tyr and Trp amino acids without changing the preferred conformation of BSA, which is indicated by a blue shift in the absorption spectra. This change in the BSA absorption spectra reveals the best interactions between BSA and the test chemicals. The titration was performed for BSA in the presence and absence of test substances in a Tris\u2013HCl (pH = 7.2) solution (Fig. 4 and Table 7). Quenching typically occurs in either a static or a dynamic phase. The static quenching mechanism involves only the synthesis of BSA\u2013compound in the ground state, but a dynamic quenching mechanism involves the temporary presence of the excited state, which brings BSA and the compound into close proximity. In addition, the dynamic quenching mechanism has no effect on the absorption spectrum; it affects only the excited state.106 The absorption intensity for BSA was found to be between 278 and 280 nm. When the test sample concentration increases, the absorbance values also increases accompanied by the blue shift (hypsochromic) (2\u20133 nm). It is suggested that BSA and the test compounds in the ground state interact statically. In this case, the evaluated hyperchromism was found in the range of 47.79 to 57.41%. The findings also clearly show that conformational changes may happen owing to non-covalent interactions like H-bonds and electrostatic interactions between substances and BSA.

Further normal mode calculations established the supposed static points to be actual minima on the potential energy surface.108 Optimized geometries for ligand (HL) and complexes (1\u20133) are shown in Fig. S37,\u2020 which also indicate the calculated dipole moment (DM) for each compound. Complexes (1\u20133) are found in either the singlet or doublet ground states, depending on the electronic structure of the central metal. Note that the electronic configurations of metal(II) complexes (1\u20133) are 3d5 (1), 3d7 (2), and 3d8 (3), respectively, which should exhibit paramagnetic characters due to a weak field and a high-spin ligand. In particular, complex (3) has two unpaired electrons in the eg high energy level orbital and six electrons in the t2g low energy orbital, in accordance with crystal field theory. In line with the experimental results, all-metal complexes present an octahedral geometry, where the central metal is bound to six coordination sites, including the two phenolic O and iminic N atoms of the ligands, along with the two N atoms of the bipyridine molecule. The dipole moment is a measure of the polarity or charge separation in molecular systems or just along a chemical bond path, and it characterizes intermolecular interactions between non-bonded subunits. The observed dipole moment values of complexes\n(1\u20133) ranged from 7.60 to 9.94 Debye, which is more polar than the free ligand (HL) (0.86 Debye) (Table 8). Several research reports have shown that the interaction between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is primarily responsible for determining chemical reactivity. It is generally acknowledged that a compound's kinetic stability can be attributed to the energy gap (\u0394E) between its FMOs. A rule of thumb is that a larger energy gap indicates that the system is more kinetically stable. In the present case, HOMO\u2013LUMO energy gaps of 3.925 (HL), 2.682 (1), 1.804 (2), and 2.368 eV (3) were predicted for all compounds (Fig. 5 and Table 8). These findings also proposed the following order of kinetic stability: (HL) > Mn (1) > Ni (3) > Co (2), which further indicates that all synthesized complexes (1\u20133) are more reactive than the free ligand, which also points out that complexes (1\u20133) may have better binding profiles with biomolecules.\nFurthermore, a reduction in energy gaps is attributed to increased conductivity and solubility, which correlates with the shifting of the electronic absorption bands of metal complexes towards longer wavelengths (red shift) compared to the free ligand. In general, the band gap is determined by the strength of a donor's ability to donate electrons and the strength of an acceptor's ability to accept electrons.\nTable 8 Quantum chemical parameters (eV) or global reactivity descriptors as well as FMO energy gap and dipole moment values of free ligand (HL) and metal complexes (1\u20133)\nCompounds ELUMO (eV) EHOMO (eV) \u0394E (eV) \u03c7 \u03b7 \u03c3 \u03bci \u03c9 \u0394Nmax \u03bc (Debye)\n(HL) \u22121.192 \u22125.177 3.925 3.184 1.992 0.502 \u22123.184 2.544 1.598 0.86 (1) \u22121.717 \u22124.399 2.682 3.058 1.341 0.746 \u22123.058 3.487 2.280 7.60 (2) \u22122.271 \u22124.075 1.804 3.173 0.902 1.109 \u22123.173 5.581 3.518 9.94 (3) \u22121.749 \u22124.117 2.368 2.933 1.184 0.845 \u22122.933 3.633 2.477 9.48\nElectron volt (eV). \u0394E (eV) \u2192 energy gap between HOMO and LUMO.

The HOMO of HL covers the entire molecule, whereas the LUMO does not cover the morpholine ring (except the nitrogen atom). The HOMO of complex (2) is concentrated on the transition metal and the phenolic rings of the ligand (HL), while the LUMO covers the metal and the 2,2\u2032-bipyridine moiety. However, in complexes (1) and (3), both the HOMO and LUMO demonstrate electron density concentration on the central metal, the phenolic rings, and the 2,2\u2032-bipyridine unit. In particular, the central metal does not contribute to stabilizing these FMOs (Fig. S38\u2020 and Table 8). Besides frontier molecular orbital theory, conceptual DFT is another reactivity framework that provides the means to discuss the reactivity of molecular systems. CDFT relies on the assumption that the response of a system to an external perturbation gives access to measurable reactivity parameters.109 It is particularly useful when it comes to sorting related molecules in terms of reactivity trends. Table 8 collects the most common CDFT descriptors, namely the electronegativity (\u03c7), the global hardness (\u03b7) and softness (\u03c3), the chemical potential (\u03bci), the global electrophilicity index (\u03c9), and the additional electronic charge (\u0394Nmax), which were evaluated as per eqn (37)\u2013(42) assuming the validity of Koopmans' theorem.109 Absolute electronegativity (\u03c7) also indicates whether a substance is a Lewis acid or a Lewis base. High \u03c7 is ascribed to a Lewis acid, while low \u03c7 is ascribed to a Lewis base.110 As shown in Table 8, the observed \u03c7 for all substances were in the range 2.933\u20133.184. The same table also presents the dipole moments of all compounds, denoted by D to distinguish them from chemical\npotentials. Dipole moment values indicate that metal complexes (1\u20133) are an order of magnitude more polar than the ligand (HL) and should therefore be more soluble in water. Furthermore, global hardness denotes the propensity of a system to let its electron density be distorted by neighbouring molecules. It is admitted that the lower the hardness of a molecule (the higher its softness), the more pronounced its polarizability.111 Hence, it is clear from Table 8 that ligand (HL) is harder than each of the three complexes, which implies that the metal complexes are more polarizable than the free ligand (HL). In addition, electrophilicity indices suggest that the three metal complexes are more electrophilic than the free ligand. Put together, the CDFT data confirm the higher reactivity of the metal complexes compared to the free ligand and are thus expected to establish more stable complexes with various biomolecules through diverse binding modes.112 Table 8 summarizes quantum chemical parameters (eV) or global reactivity descriptors, as well as the FMO energy gap and dipole moment values of the free ligand (HL) and metal complexes (1\u20133).\nAlthough handy and practical for sorting molecules in terms of reactivity trends, global reactivity descriptors soon become useless when it comes to identifying the most reactive sites within a given molecule. This is where local reactivity descriptors come to the rescue. For instance, the electron density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO reveals that the most reactive non-metallic fragments of complexes (1\u20133) are the phenolic rings of (HL) and the bipyridine unit, which are then expected to engage in a variety of intermolecular interactions. Another well-established local reactivity descriptor is the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). The MEP of a molecule is regarded as a measure of the force acting on a hypothetical positive charge due to the combined electrical effect of electrons and nuclei at a given position in the molecular spaces.113 Several studies have demonstrated the ability of the MEP analysis to accurately identify the most reactive sites involved in \u201chard\u2013hard\u201d interactions, in line with Pearson's hard\u2013soft acid\u2013base theory.114 Fig. 6 displays MEP maps of (HL) and complexes (1\u20133) calculated at the 0.002 isosurfaces. The regions highlighted in red and blue in Fig. 6 are those where nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks are most likely to occur. Two nucleophilic sites are observed on the MEP of the free ligand. The first region surrounds both the phenolic O and the imine N atoms and mirrors the presence of the ESP global minimum of \u221246.6 kcal mol\u22121. The second spot is found in the nearest region of the morpholinic O atom and appears next to a local minimum of roughly \u221229.5 kcal mol\u22121. These findings show that the first site is more reactive than the second, which is also supported by the fact that the phenolic site is the one that binds to the central metal during the formation of the metal complexes. On the other hand, the MEP maps of complexes (1\u20133) present a negative electrostatic potential all over the phenolate units, whereas\nthe bipyridine fragment carries a positive region enclosing allFig. 5 FMOs of the free ligand (HL) and its complexes (1\u20133)."

This observation corroborates, at least partly, the previous analysis of FMOs, highlighting that the phenolate and bipyridine fragments are the preferred binding sites for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks, respectively. The free ligand (HL) and the complexes (1\u20133) both demonstrated amphoteric species that can function as Lewis acids and Lewis bases. Similar systems can be found throughout the literature.115\n3.4.2. Molecular docking properties with DNA/BSA/SARSCoV-2 (3CLPro). The molecular docking method is a useful theoretical framework to realize metal complex\u2013DNA interactions in rational drug discovery and development as well as in mechanistic analysis. It is also a valuable dynamic tool to estimate the relative binding affinities of the test compounds against validated therapeutic targets, which contributes to finding a biomolecule's preferred binding locations and improving comprehension of a drug's mechanism of action. The ligand (HL) and its complexes (1\u20133) were docked onto DNA/BSA/SARS-CoV-2 (3CLPro) to figure out the best binding modes and the nature of interactions responsible for the stability of the complexes formed.\nFig. S39\u2020 illustrates the 3D models of the host biomolecules for BSA, CT-DNA, and 3CLPro. The guest molecules of all test compounds were first docked inside the active site of BSA to measure their binding affinity and decipher the main interactions that ensure the stability of the resulting guest\u2013host complex. Fig. 7 demonstrates the maximum docking positions. The observed binding energies were in the range of \u22128.2 to \u221210.1 kcal mol\u22121 and indicate the spontaneous formation of the guest\u2013host complex. The observed binding affinities were found in the following sequence: \u221210.1 (2) > \u22129.3 (3) > \u22129.1 (1) > \u22128.2 (HL). It is imperative to take into account that metal complexes (1\u20133) have a persistent tendency to bind to BSA via the static mode.\nThe stability of guest\u2013host complexes does not only depend on their inherent reactivity but also on their size, conformation, permeability, polarity, and dipole moments, which are supported inside the active site. Also, note that guest molecules are maintained inside through several noncovalent interactions (Fig. S40\u2020). The most notable ones are H-bonding interactions, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking, hydrophobicity, and van der Waals contacts, which are essential in complex binding. For instance, the free ligand (HL) forms two regular H-bonds with BSA, in which it acts as the proton acceptor. The phenolic O atom binds to Phe506 in the first interaction, which has a length of 2.73 \u00c5, while the morpholinic O atom binds to the Asn504 amino acid residue in the second interaction. This finding supports the MEP's prediction of the local reactivity of the free ligand. Additionally, metal complex (1) is also engaged in conventional H-bonds with Lys563 and Val551, respectively, while complexes (2), and (3) do not form such interactions. The docking of our guest molecules inside 3CLPro was also favourable and demonstrated binding energies in the range of \u22126.7 to \u22129.3 kcal mol\u22121. The most stable guest\u2013host complex was attributed to complex (1a), while ligand (HL) formed the least stable one. The observed binding affinities for all compounds were in the following sequence: \u22129.3 (2) > \u22128.2 (3) > \u22126.9 (1) > (HL) \u22126.7, indicating that metal complexes (1\u20133) have higher reactivity than the free ligand (HL). Furthermore, assessment of the relatively high negative binding energy of complex (2) indicates that the interactions with neighboring residues stabilize the metal complex through stronger interactions than complexes (1) and (3), and the sequence of binding interactions is consistent with their extended \u03c0-conjugation on the bridging ring.\nThe best binding poses and the physical interactions that guest molecules establish inside 3CLPro's active site are shown in Fig. 8 and S41.\u2020 H-Bonds and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking"

Moreover, metal complexes (2\u20133) apart from complex (1) have potential binding ability compared to the co-crystallized ligand, which often functions as an optimistic control.116,117 The measured results encourage further in vitro studies to validate the inhibitory effect of the test compounds on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, the binding energies on the CT-DNA double helix for all test compounds were in the range of \u22127.7 to \u22128.5 kcal mol\u22121 and followed this trend: \u22128.5 (2) > \u22128.2 (3) > \u22128.0 (1) > \u22127.7 (HL) kcal mol\u22121. As demonstrated in Fig. 9, all substances are effectively sandwiched between DNA double helixes via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions, and hydrogen bonds including electrostatic forces enhance the overall binding ability. However, the results reveal that complexes (1\u20133) engage with the oxygen atom of the phosphate backbone of the deoxyribonucleic acid helix by an intercalation mode that involves exterior edge stacking. The docked molecules demonstrate that the enhanced planarity of the morpholine-linked ligand (HL) core permits sturdy \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions and that the complexes fit well into the intercalative in the DNA structure's guanine\u2013cytosine-rich domain. Also, molecular planarity is one of the main factors for smooth penetration, which is enhanced by expanding the rigid \u03c0-surface of 2,2\u2032-\nbipyridine on complexes. Thus, the complexes have revealed better binding abilities than the free ligand. Since metal complexes may be slightly affected by intercalative interaction due to their size and voluminousness (bulk) compared to the free ligand, they can also be stabilized along with electrostatic interactions and the formation of H-bonds. However, non-covalent \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions predominate when complexes (1\u20133) bind with DNA, and each metal complex within the DNA duplex is greatly stabilized as a result of these interactions as a whole. Finally, the modelling data reported above reasonably support the experimental results and provide additional details on the nature and extent of interactions between the considered biomolecules and our test compounds."

Assessment of DPPH radical scavenging properties. An aqueous or methanol solution turns from dark purple to light yellow when DPPH, a stable chromogen free-radical, combines with an antioxidant molecule. Because DPPH quickly absorbs hydrogen or electrons from donor groups, a blank DPPH solution was used for baseline correction in the absence of a compound, and 517 nm (\u03b5 = 8320 M\u22121 cm\u22121) was observed to give a significant absorption maximum. It was found that when test compound concentrations (40\u2013240 \u03bcM) increase, DPPH radical inhibition increases as well. The DPPH\u02d9 radicals are reduced by an antioxidant compound\n(AH), in which the reduction of electronic absorbance for each compound was carefully noted at 517 nm.123 The capacity to obstruct radicals improves as the sample concentration increases. The assessed percentage of maximum inhibition for all substances was found at 240 \u03bcM in the following sequence: (ascorbic acid) (85.65) > (1) 62.23 > (3) 60.02 > (1) 58.05 > (HL) 52.45. The evaluated findings of IC50 for standard ascorbic acid and complex (2) were found at 80 \u03bcM and 200 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. S42a and Table S12\u2020). In this case, complex (2) demonstrated the best antioxidant potency compared to the others. Furthermore, the percentage of scavenging or maximum inhibition of all substances is estimated using the following eqn (43): scavenging (%) = [(A0 \u2212 AS)/A0] \u00d7 100, where A0 represents the absorbance of the control (DPPH alone in ethanol) and AS denotes the absorbance of the sample (a mixture of DPPH and compounds in ethanol).\n3.5.2. Evaluation of hydroxyl radical inhibition. Hydrogen peroxide receives electrons via antioxidant molecules, and then they are neutralized into a water molecule.

The clear inhibition zone (mm) values obtained for various bacterial and fungal species in the samples are revealed in Fig. S43,\u2020 and the evaluated findings are summarized in Table 9. The results of the microbial activities revealed that the metal chelates demonstrated greater efficacy than ligand (HL) against the chosen bacterial and fungal pathogens, owing to the increased lipophilicity of the metal complexes under the same experimental conditions, and they accelerate the breakdown of the cell wall during biosynthesis in the microorganism enzymes as well as damaging the normal cell processes due to increasing the permeability of cells into lipid membranes.124 The obtained results suggest that all metal complexes demonstrate significantly greater antimicrobial properties than free ligand (HL) against a certain microorganism. They are contrasted with common medications like streptomycin and amikacin for treating bacteria, and ketoconazole and amphotericin B for treating fungi.

Antimicrobial drugs frequently either fully eliminate microbes or prevent their cell growth by preventing the production of cell walls/proteins/DNA, including by obstructing folate metabolism and the cytoplasmic membrane. Additionally, the samples' mode of action may be employed in disrupting the cell's respiration process by the formation of H-bonds in the course of the morpholine-fused iminic group coordinated with the active metal center of its parts, inhibiting proliferation of the cell. The enhanced antibacterial activity could be attributed to changes in pharmacological kinetics, conductivity, steric and electronic effects, solubility, and metal\u2013ligand bond length. The difference in the antimicrobial efficacy of some of the compounds towards various microorganisms depends on the impermeability of the cells of the germs or the diversity of ribosomes in the microbes.126 eqn (43) is used to calculate the percentage of inhibition of all substances (Table 9). The cell walls of Gram-negative bacterial strains are generally composed of thick, multiple layers (20\u201380 nm) of peptidoglycan, which is more easily treated by antibiotics due to its 20\u201330% lipid content, whereas the cell walls of Grampositive bacterial strains are composed of single, thin layers (8\u201310 nm) of peptidoglycan, which is more resistant to antibiotics due to its impermeable cell wall and very low lipid content. It is concluded that the present complexes exhibit significant activity against Gram-negative antibacterial strains compared to Gram-positive antibacterial strains. Antibacterial activity does not only depend on permeability and\nlipophilicity. It is also dependent on the structural properties of metal complexes, such as coordination behavior, ligand polarity and dipole moment, and the condensed central metal ion via charge equilibration, among other things."

The measured percentage of growth inhibition for these compounds is summarized in Table 10. Additionally, the results of DNA binding tests using these complexes, including gel electrophoresis, UV-vis spectral titration, hydrodynamics, emission, and CV findings, were in good agreement with the findings of cytotoxicity.131 Expressions eqn (44) and (45) were applied to measure the percentage of growth inhibition and cell viability (Table 10). In this case, complexes (2) and (3) have been proven to have greater biological efficiency than the others. Cytotoxicity depends on not only the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity and permeability, which only assist the crossing of the cell membrane but are not responsible for cell death, but also on several other factors, including the Lewis acid character, overall stability, solubility, conductivity, compatibility, length of the metal\u2013ligand bond, overall charge, electron density, reduction potential, dipole moment, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, proton transfer equilibrium, and coordination environment. These significant elements might also contribute to the increased biological activity. Moreover, cobalt is also generally not considered to be a very toxic element, and its coordination complexes have fascinating redox and magnetic characteristics that fit them for a remarkable range of biological and medical uses. Hence, cobalt complexes have diverse potential to be used as medications due to their low-energy d\u2013d transitions and MLCT bands, which also enable the regulation of therapeutic activity as well as antibacterial, anticancer, and antiviral activities, which are well documented.132 Moreover, it is possible to intelligently adjust these factors to successfully target a desired pathway or biomolecule. Designing such wellcontrolled and selective cobalt-based therapeutics may benefit from a mechanistic understanding of the varied bioactivities of cobalt complexes. Thus, knowing the mechanism of action can\ndirect the advancement of prospective cobalt treatments to clinical trial.133\nMoreover, the selectivity index (SI) value is a very important factor for observing the toxicity of drugs, which is also measured from the ratio of a sample's toxic concentration to its effective bioactive concentration using eqn (46) (Table 10). The SI values are mostly observed to be between 1 and 10. Also, several authors have suggested that a criterion for the approval of good drugs or a selective bioactive sample is that it should have SI \u2265 10, which means that the ideal drug should have a relatively high toxic concentration with a very low bioactive concentration.134\u2013137 Generally, SI < 1 indicates that the sample could be toxic and cannot be treated as a drug, furthermore, according to the concepts of Nogueira and Est\u00f3lio do Ros\u00e1rio, the SI value should not be lower than 2, while SI < 2 is thought to show discriminating toxicity and could even damage healthy cells. On the other hand, SI > 2 pronounced higher selective toxicity against cancer cells.138 In this case, the observed SI values of the present complexes (1\u20133) against A549, HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines were greater than 2, except for the free ligand (Table 10) and cisplatin, which also had a smaller SI value (SI < 2), which indicates greater toxicity than the others.

Chem., 2023, 14, 1667\u20131697 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\na drug because it has a fundamental impact on the pharmacokinetic profile and is associated with its capacity to enter tumor cells through passive diffusion.139 Also, they have been demonstrated to associate with biological activity measurements in a highly diverse range of experimental settings, from straightforward protein binding to in vivo impacts on animals and humans. This is probably due to the fact that hydrophobic effects play a crucial role not only in the intramolecular interactions that take place between a medication and its target site, but also in the distribution of a drug within a biosystem, its interaction with rival binding sites, passage across and into membranes, and its interaction with metabolizing enzymes. However, the \u201caccurate\u201d model system for hydrophobic effects is octanol/water. Hydrophobicity (lipophilicity) is associated with the partition coefficient (log P), which is a measure of the ability of the solute to go into two immiscible phases (polar and non-polar environments). Also, it refers to the concentration of unionized species of compounds. Generally, the ability of a drug to penetrate with high permeability into lipid membranes depends on the solubility and partition coefficient of the drug. Furthermore, the partition coefficient is extensively employed in the discovery of new medications, chromatography, physical chemistry, environmental science and other fields. Since lipophilicity is one of the major parameters affecting important biological processes, it can influence drug intake via the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics of the substances.140 Additionally, the ability of a molecule or drug to passively diffuse across cell membranes has been linked to its lipophilicity, which is a measure of the solubility of the substance in aqueous and lipid-like environments.141 In general, chemotherapeutic medications often need to have certain solubility in the lipid phase in order to be absorbed by the biofilm. Meanwhile, the intracellular milieu is a watersoluble environment once the drug has entered the cell. The medicine must be water-soluble for it to have any anticancer effects. More remarkably, numerous investigations have demonstrated that log P is crucial for the intracellular absorption and sub-cellular localization of chemotherapeutic medication, which influences the anticancer activity.142 Conversely, the cytotoxic properties of a synthesized complex are not only associated with its DNA/protein binding affinity but may be also influenced by its lipophilicity. Additionally, molecules with higher lipophilicity have increased permeability into cell membranes, which determines a drug's cytotoxicity. A low-lipophilicity molecule typically exhibits poorer permeability. However, more positive partition coefficient values (log P > 0) correspond to higher lipophilicity, and more negative values (log P < 0) correspond to higher hydrophilicity. Generally, log P is measured between \u22123 and +10; if log P > \u22123, the substance has an extremely hydrophilic character, and if log P > +10, the substance has an extremely hydrophobic character. In addition, the aromatic ligands get larger in size and become more hydrophobic. When moving from ligands to complexes,\nthe log P value increases significantly in comparison to ligands. The present complexes (1\u20133) have higher values of log P and logD compared to the free ligand (Table 11). However, when log P > \u00b12, the drug will be harder to excrete from the body due to its high lipophilic character, which also creates toxicity due to accumulation. This is determined by the logarithm of the partition coefficient (log Po/w) in the n-octanol/water system for all compounds with the support of eqn (47) and the findings were also compared with cisplatin (log P = \u22122.28 \u00b1 0.07)143 (Table 11). When the partition coefficient is less than \u00b12 (log P \u2272 \u00b12), the drug exhibits good penetration without accumulation in the body. The overall observed log P values for the following compounds were: \u22122.280 (cisplatin), +1.087 (HL), +1.166 (1), \u22121.477 (2), and +1.170 (3) with error limits of (\u00b10.05) (Fig. S45\u2013S47\u2020 and Table 11). In this case, complex (2) exhibited both high hydrophilic and low hydrophobic characteristics in relation to cisplatin and other compounds that exhibit lipophilicity. The observed results are also well correlated with cytotoxic properties. Moreover, in an equilibrium twocomponent system, the partition coefficient (log P) reflects the ratio of neutral solute concentrations in the organic and aqueous phases. As a result, log P expresses the inherent lipophilicity of a compound in the absence of dissociation or ionization. However, the distribution coefficient is the overall ratio of a chemical substance between the two phases: the ionized and unionized fractions (logD).144 This expression refers to the effective or net lipophilicity of a compound at a specific pH, taking into consideration both the intrinsic lipophilicity of the compound and the degree of ionization. Log P eqn (47) and logD eqn (48) are interconnected for monoprotic organic acids through eqn (49) and for monoprotic organic bases through eqn (50). Also, pH and pKa findings were measured using the Henderson\u2013 Hasselbalch eqn (51) (Table 11). In addition, the partition coefficient is independent of pH. But the distribution coefficient (D) is a pH-dependent factor, because it depends on every species in the organic and aqueous phases (neutral and ionized). Thus, the drug molecule must be unionized in an aqueous solution.145,146\nHowever, every part of a drug molecule imparts hydrophobic or hydrophilic characteristics to the entire molecule. Furthermore, higher cytotoxic activity of the complexes correlates with higher cellular absorption. Despite this, the findings generally imply that log Po/w values might serve as helpful predictors of cytotoxicity for all test substances (Fig. S47\u2020). Additionally, metal complex cytotoxicity is connected with certain chemical characteristics, such as binding constants for their interaction of small molecules with biomolecules (DNA/BSA) or their hydrophobicity and ability to traverse lipid bilayers (Fig. S46\u2020).147,148 Many research reports suggest that there is a correlation between the hydrophobicity of bipyridine/ phenanthroline based metal complexes and their level of cytotoxicity.149,150 In this case, the high cytotoxicity of complex (2) is mainly correlated with a moderate"

On the other hand, it was also observed that the higher hydrophobicity of complex (3) exhibited a significantly diminished cytotoxic efficacy. Furthermore, because the cytotoxicity activity (IC50) is directly related to the partition coefficients of a substance, some factors such as \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and electrostatic forces, including the formation of hydrogen bonds, were suggested to cause cytotoxicity, as well as this trend, which presumably results from the cooperative effect of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, it is clear that increasing cytotoxicity is dependent not only on hydrophobicity, permeability (membrane penetration), solubility, absorption, plasma protein binding, and distribution, but also on \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking and electrostatic forces. Also, the coordination behavior, the polarity and dipole moment of the ligand, and the reduced core metal ion via charge equilibration are possible explanations for the complicated ability of cells to pass through the lipid layer of the cell membrane.151 In particular, proteins containing a number of charged amino acids with negative phosphate residues exhibit higher electrostatic interactions with complexes possessing lower hydrophobicity, leading to greater cytotoxic effects.152"

The scavenging properties put forward by complexes (1\u20133) stood out as having greater potential to scavenge radicals than the free ligand. The observed in vitro anti-cancer properties for all the substances, including the standard drug cisplatin (CP), revealed that complexes (2\u20133) demonstrated the best cytotoxic efficiency among them, with less influence on normal cells than cisplatin. Additionally, the partition coefficient (log P) values of all test compounds showed good correlation with cytotoxic activity (IC50) and complexes (2\u20133) might function as a new class of anticancer agent in the future."
