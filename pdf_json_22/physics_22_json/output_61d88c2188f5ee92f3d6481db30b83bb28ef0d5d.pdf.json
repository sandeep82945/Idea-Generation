INTRODUCTION\nBinary black hole (BBH) mergers have dominated the gravitational wave (GW) observations of the LIGO and Virgo detectors [1,2] in the first, second and the third observing runs [3\u20136]. One key parameter of these astrophysical systems is the mass ratio q \u00bc m2=m1 \u2264 1 of the binaries\u2019 components. Current GW observations [5,7\u20139] predominantly find mass ratios close to unity with a few observations showing support for low mass ratios [10,11]. With the increasing number of GW detections in the upcoming observing runs by ground-based detectors [7,12], and space-borne detectors, like the LISA\nobservatory [13,14], it is likely that more binaries with mass asymmetries are found. In particular, LISA will be sensitive to binaries with mass ratios ranging from q \u223c 1, over intermediate mass-ratio systems (q \u223c 10\u22123) to extreme mass ratio inspirals at q \u223c 10\u22125. Furthermore, third-generation ground-based detectors with improved low frequency sensitivity relative to today\u2019s ground-based detectors will be able to detect the capture of stellar mass black holes (BHs) by intermediate mass BHs with massratios down to q \u223c 10\u22123 [15]. Thus, the modeling of GWs from BBHs at all mass ratios is of preeminent relevance for a correct detection and analysis of these sources. This modeling problem may be tackled by different\napproaches: using weak field perturbation theory, like postNewtonian (PN) theory [16] and post-Minkowskian expansions [17], effective methods (like the effective-one-body formalism [18,19] or phenomenological models [20]), small mass ratio (SMR) perturbation theory [21] and numerical relativity (NR), i.e., solving numerically the full Einstein equations [22].

For current ground-based detectors there are ongoing efforts to search for signatures of orbital eccentricity in the detected GW signals [30\u201340]. For future GW detectors, especially for high-mass ratio binaries in LISA, it is expected that emission of GWs has not circularized most binaries yet. Therefore, the correct modeling of orbital eccentricity effects is fundamental to accurately describe such systems in future detectors, in particular for extreme mass-ratio inspirals, which are described by SMR perturbation theory. Recently, Ref. [41] demonstrated that NR simulations at modest mass-ratios (q\u2273 0.1) can be used to gain insight into the accuracy of the SMR expansion, confirming the known leading-order term, and predicting next-to-leading order contributions. Reference [41] considered noneccentric (quasicircular) binaries only, with both BHs nonspinning. Here, we begin to extend the analysis in [41] to eccentric BBHs, while still keeping both BHs nonspinning. The noncircularity of the binary\u2019s orbit introduces a new timescale to the two-body problem, the timescale of the periastron precession, which induces oscillations in the dynamical and GW quantities of the binary system complicating substantially the analysis relative to the quasicircular case described in [41]. An additional difficulty arises from the fact that eccentricity is a gauge dependent parameter in general relativity, thus complicating the comparison between SMR evolutions and NR simulations. In order to overcome this problem, we develop tools to extract gauge invariant quantities from both SMR and NR waveforms. Using PN theory, we derive relations among the eccentricity defined from the orbital and (2,2)-mode gravitational wave frequency, and the PN temporal eccentricity. We show that a commonly used definition of eccentricity based on the (2,2)-mode frequency\u2014 Eq. (5) below\u2014does not reduce to the Newtonian definition of eccentricity. We therefore adopt a new definition of eccentricity, egw in Eq. (6) below. This new definition continues to be based on the frequency of the (2,2) GW-mode, but also satisfies the correct Newtonian limit. NR simulations of BBHs have been routinely performed since more than a decade ago. Motivated by expectation of small eccentricities for most of the GW signals in the frequency band of ground-based detectors, most of the NR groups have focused on the production of simulations of quasicircular BBH mergers [42\u201353], with the exception of a limited number of studies exploring BBH coalescences in eccentric orbits [53\u201361]. The Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) [62] is an accurate and efficient NR code that has been used to study quasi-circular inspirals in great depth [45,50]. Eccentric inspirals at low eccentricity were\nstudied to some extent [55\u201358]. We expand SpEC\u2019s capabilities for accurate simulations of binaries with larger eccentricities, 0.2\u2272 e\u2272 0.8, which are characterized by large variations of GW frequency and amplitude between apastron and periastron passages. We have produced a set of 52 nonspinning eccentric simulations between mass ratios 1\u223610 and 1\u22361, and with initial eccentricities of up to 0.8. The number of orbits is typically \u227320, yielding a dataset with the longest evolutions and highest initial eccentricities up to date, which sets it also apart from the simulations of other groups [53,59,61]. The main purpose of this article is to compare NR and SMR calculations. This requires a map from the instantaneous state of a NR simulation to the geodesic on which the point-particle instantaneously moves in its motion around the central black hole. We characterize the instantaneous state of SMR and NR simulations by symmetric mass ratio, \u03bd \u00bc m1m2=\u00f0m1 \u00fem2\u00de2, eccentricity, egw, and orbitaveraged frequency of the 22-mode, h\u03c922i. These quantities can be uniquely determined in SMR and NR configurations and they generate an unambiguous map between SMR and NR configurations, as described in Sec. V. We find that the leading order prediction in the SMR expansion for the energy and angular momentum fluxes agree with the NR results to within 10%. The next-toleading order SMR contributions to the fluxes can be estimated by rescaling the difference of the NR and leading order SMR contribution by a factor of the symmetric massratio. The result has a very small dispersion in symmetric mass ratio, which implies that the next-to-next-to leading order SMR contribution is small, even for comparable masses. This is compatible with the findings of [63] in the quasicircular case. Comparing the zero-eccentricity limit of our next-to-leading order estimate to the exact results of [63] we find the results to be comparable with an overall small shift likely due to the orbit-averaging procedure applied to extract quantities from the eccentric NR simulations. A similar analysis is done for the periastron advance. In this case the NR results are within 8% of the leading-order (geodesic) SMR result, the next-toleading SMR contribution is compatible with previous exact calculations in the quasi-circular limit [64,65], and the next-to-next-to-leading SMR contribution appears small in the comparable mass regime. This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present a detailed description of the new dataset of eccentric nonspinning NR simulations produced for this work. We investigate the relations between different eccentricity definitions in Sec. III, and we provide a definition of eccentricity based on the (2,2)-mode frequency, which reduces to the Newtonian definition of eccentricity in the Newtonian limit. Section IV describes the SMR evolutions performed in this work, and Sec. V discusses the mapping between SMR and NR configurations. In Sec. VI we compare the quantities extracted from the NR simulations\n124040-2\nto the SMR perturbation theory results and provide constraints on the values of the next order terms in the SMR expansion for the GW energy and angular momentum fluxes, as well as the periastron advance. In Sec. VII we summarize our main conclusions and discuss future work. The appendixes contain additional technical details: Appendix A describes our method to set the initial parameters in the NR simulations, in Appendix B we assess the quality of the NR waveforms, and in Appendix C we provide details of the derivation of the relations between different definitions of eccentricity using PN theory."

In particular, SpEC evolves a firstorder representation of the generalized harmonic evolution system [66] using a multidomain spectral method [67\u201370]. At the outer boundary constraint-preserving boundary conditions [66,71,72] are employed, whereas black hole excision is used inside the apparent horizons [68\u201370,73]. The transition to ringdown is accomplished with the techniques described in Refs. [68,70]. Initial data are constructed with the eXtended Conformal-Thin Sandwich (XCTS) approach [74\u201376], and we describe in Sec. II A and Appendix A how we achieve binaries with a desired value of orbital eccentricity. For improved performance for eccentric systems we adopt part of the modifications developed in [77] to produce accurate simulations of hyperbolic encounters. Most notably, adaptive mesh refinement and GW output is triggered more frequently to adjust to periastron passages which happen on fast timescales, and which cause pulses of higher-frequency GWs that travel through the computational grid."

The simulations are summarized in Table I; for each of the mass-ratios q \u00bc 1; 1=2; 1=3; 1=4; 1=6; 1=8 and 1=10, simulations with several different eccentricities egw are computed. Within the XCTS formalism to construct initial data, the simulations in Table I were produced using superposed harmonic Kerr (SHK) initial data [78], except for the simulation SXS:BBH:2527, which used superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) initial data [79] as this is the simulation with largest initial separation and eccentricity, and initial tests with SHK initial data were not successful.1\nFor each simulation, Table I reports on the parameters values necessary to reproduce the initial data with the techniques described in [80]: the inverse mass ratio 1=q \u00bc m2=m1 \u2265 1, the orbital separation D0=M0, where M0 is the initial ADM mass, the initial orbital frequency M0\u03a90, and the initial radial velocity parameter a0 [81,82]. The procedure to determine the initial parameters of the simulations is described in Appendix A. The simulations are started at or very close to apastron due to limitations of the radial map used by the dual-frame method [83] employed to solve the Einstein equations in SpEC [84]. Specifically, the radial mapping of Eq. (9) in [84] connecting the comoving and inertial frames does not allow the orbital separation to increase more than 1.5 times the initial separation. We note that this limitation has been recently overcome in SpEC by defining a new radial map, however, it is not applied for simulations in this publication, and we leave it to future work to report on this new feature. To convey a sense of the physical properties of the BBHs studied, Table I also lists the number of orbits to merger, Norbits and the time to merger Tmerger=M, where M is the total mass. We also specify the time (before merger) Tref=M where the orbit averaged frequency of the (2,2)-mode reaches the value \u03c9ref22 \u00bc 0.042, as well as eccentricity erefgw and mean anomaly lref=\u00f02\u03c0\u00de at this reference time. These quantities are defined with the procedures outlined below in Sec. III. The reference frequency is chosen to be consistent with the length2 of the shortest simulation, which corresponds to SXS:BBH:2520 with 4963M of evolution and 18 orbits. Apart from this particular case, most of the simulations have typically a time to merger > 104M. This makes our dataset of eccentric NR waveforms the one with the longest evolutions of eccentric binary black holes to date.

Figure 1 also shows a zoom-in of the merger part on the waveforms, to highlight the similarity of the merger and ringdown parts of the waveform with different eccentricities.3 Merger and ringdown of the high and low eccentricity inspirals agree well with each other, indicating that the circularization hypothesis is accurately fulfilled for our dataset, consistently with the findings in [54,59,61]. We note that recently some unexpected dependence of the kick velocity on eccentricity was found in [85]. A similar analysis of the kick velocity can be performed on our dataset, and we leave such study of the final velocity as well as other remnant properties for future work."

            "heading": "III. DISCUSSION ABOUT ECCENTRICITY DEFINITIONS",
            "text": "There is a large variety of measures of eccentricity in use in general relativity [90]. Many of these measures derive from the trajectories of the binaries and are therefore coordinate dependent. This makes them generally unsuitable for comparisons between different modeling approaches, which may be computed in different gauges or where there may be no well-defined notion of trajectory at all. However, one gauge invariant observable common to all approaches to modeling gravitational waves from compact binaries is the waveform itself. In this sense, it may seem more reasonable to define eccentricity in terms of gravitational wave quantities rather than quantities dependent on the trajectories of the black holes. A gravitational wave mode (see Sec. II), has an instantaneous frequency \u03c9lm \u00bc _\u03d5lm, which can be related in the inspiral regime to the instantaneous orbital \u03a9orb \u00bc _\u03d5orb by the approximation [16],\n\u03c9lm \u2248m\u03a9orb: \u00f016\u00de\nHowever, as eccentricity increases the approximation of Eq. (16) is no longer valid as can be observed in the top panel of Fig. 4, where the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (16) in the case of the \u00f0l; m\u00de \u00bc \u00f02; 2\u00de multipole are displayed. In the top plot of Fig. 4, the upper and bottom panels correspond to a q \u00bc 1=6 configuration with two different initial eccentricities e0\u03c922 \u00bc 0.03, 0.63, respectively. The relation between the orbital and the (2,2)-mode\n124040-7\nfrequency is no longer the simple factor 2, as in the quasicircular case. In order to derive the relation between both frequencies in the more generic eccentric case, we use PN theory. Specifically, we compute \u03c922 at 1PN order using the instantaneous gravitational modes from [91]. We obtain a 1PN-accurate expression for \u03c922 in harmonic coordinates of the form,\n\u03c91PN22 \u00bc F \u00f0\u03bd; r; _r; \u0308r; _\u03d5; \u03d5\u0308\u00de; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere \u0308r denotes two time derivatives on r. The explicit expression for F is given in Eq. (C6) in Appendix C 1 together with details of the derivation. Because of _\u03d5 \u00bc \u03a9orb, Eq. (17) is a relation between \u03c922 and \u03a9orb. The top panel of Fig. 4 shows that the use of Eq. (17) with NR coordinates (\u03c91PN;c\u20d7NR22 in the figure) agrees notably better with the (2,2)-mode NR frequency than 2\u03a9orb. The deviations in Eq. (16) increase with eccentricity. The relative error can be larger than 10%, whereas Eq. (17) leads to differences smaller than 1%. It is important to note that the scaling relation in Eq. (16) between orbital and gravitational wave frequencies is still satisfied in an orbit-averaged sense. This is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4 for the orbit-averaged frequencies h\u03c922i (solid red lines) and h\u03a9orbi (blue dots). Let us now turn to eccentricity defined from the extrema of a frequency. Equation (5) can be evaluated from \u03c922 (as written), or from the orbital frequency \u03a9orb. Because \u03c922\u00f0t\u00de and \u03a9orb\u00f0t\u00de have modulations of different amplitude (as seen in the top panels of Fig. 4), the corresponding eccentricities e\u03c922 and e\u03a9orb are also different, as visible in the lower panels of Fig. 4.4 Given the remarkable agreement of the PN approximation to\u03c922 with respect to the NR values, one can insert Eq. (17) into the right-hand side of Eq. (5), expand the corresponding expressions up to 1PN, and obtain an approximation for e\u03c922 in terms of the coordinates as\ne1PN\u03c922 \u00bc G\u00f0\u03bd; ra;p;\u03a9a;porb ; \u0308ra;p\u00de; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere the expression for G is given by (C14) in Appendix C 1, and the subscripts/superscripts a, p refer to the apastron and periastron, respectively. The bottom panel of Fig. 4 shows that Eq. (18) successfully reproduces e\u03c922 . Given the overall agreement, we do not pursue to explore higher PN orders, or possible resummations of this PN expression to improve its behavior in the strong field\nregime, and we leave possible extensions of these expressions, like the inclusion of spin effects, for future work. The relations in Eqs. (17) and (18) allow one to obtain an estimate of the eccentricity measured from the (2,2)-mode frequency from the coordinates of the system. This can be useful, for instance, to set an eccentricity reduction or eccentricity control procedure based on the eccentricity measured from the waveforms instead of the trajectories without having to evolve the system such that the gravitational waves reach the extraction radii, and thus, saving computational time. Equation (18), as used in the lower panel of Fig. 4, still utilizes the NR trajectory. If one substitutes in a PN trajectory in the quasi-Keplerian parametrization [92], one obtains relations between e\u03a9orb or e\u03c922 and the PN eccentricity parameters, most notably the widely used et [91,93\u2013100]. A detailed derivation of the relation e\u03a9orb \u2212 et up to 3PN order for nonspinning binaries can be found in Appendix C 2. We focus here on the relation e\u03c922 \u2212 et, which is derived up to 1PN order in Appendix C 3, providing\ne1PN\u03c922 \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 \u2212 et p \u00f01\u00fe et\u00de \u2212 \u00f01 \u2212 et\u00de ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2\u00fe et p ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 \u2212 et p \u00f01\u00fe et\u00de \u00fe \u00f01 \u2212 et\u00de ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2\u00fe et p\n\u2212 \u03b3xet \u00f054\u03b7\u00fe 101\u00dee2t \u00fe 192\u03b7 \u2212 1380 84\u00f0e4t \u2212 5e2t \u00fe 2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4 \u2212 e2t p \u00fe 4\u00de ; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere x \u00bc \u03a92=3orb , and \u03b3 \u00bc 1=c2 is a bookkeeping parameter identifying the 1-PN corrections.

We leave to future work the improvement of the eccentricity measurement in the transition from inspiral to plunge.\n124040-8\nhigher frequency corrections to the Newtonian behavior, whose impact in the leading Newtonian correction factors between the eccentricity will depend on the region of the parameter space considered. The relation et\u00f0e\u03c922\u00de at Newtonian order can be obtained by inverting Eq.

(23) to e\u03c922 will yield an eccentricitydefinition that reduces to the Newtonian definition of eccentricity. As a consequence of the previous analysis we propose a new definition of eccentricity measured from the frequency of the (2,2)-mode, which corrects the naive result e\u03c922 obtained from the extrema of \u03c922 by Eq. (23),\negw \u2261 e0PNt \u00f0e\u03c922\u00de: \u00f024\u00de By construction, egw reduces to the Newtonian definition of eccentricity in the Newtonian limit. In the bottom panel of Fig. 4, egw is shown to be closer to e\u03a9orb than e\u03c922 . Both egw and e\u03a9orb have the correct Newtonian limit, and the differences may be explained due to coordinate effects affecting e\u03a9orb , and higher PN terms, as egw is obtained from Eq. (20). This new definition of eccentricity is adopted throughout the rest of the paper, and its applications to data analysis are further investigated in upcoming work [101]."

(31) gives the following expression of the waveform frequency \u03c9lm:\n\u03c9lm \u00bc \u2212\u2111 d dt log X n Almn\u00f0p; eg\u00dee\u2212i\u00f0m\u03d5\u00fenqr\u00de\n\u00f032\u00de\n\u00bc \u211c P\nn\u00f0md\u03d5dt \u00fe n dqrdt \u00deAlmn\u00f0p; eg\u00dee\u2212i\u00f0m\u03d5\u00fenqr\u00deP nAlmn\u00f0p; eg\u00dee\u2212i\u00f0m\u03d5\u00fenqr\u00de\n\u00f033\u00de\n\u00bcm\u03a9geo\u00f0p;eg\u00de\u00fe\u03a9rgeo\u00f0p;eg\u00de\u211c P\nnnAlmn\u00f0p;eg\u00dee\u2212inqrP nAlmn\u00f0p;eg\u00dee\u2212inqr :\n\u00f034\u00de\nFrom this we note that the waveform frequency is exactly 2\u03c0 periodic in qr, and consequently the radial period is exactly 2\u03c0=\u03a9rgeo. A less obvious observation is that the average of the second term in (32) vanishes after averaging over a radial period. A sufficient condition for this to be true is\njAlm0\u00f0p; eg\u00dej > X n\u22600 Almn\u00f0p; eg\u00dee\u2212inqr ; \u00f035\u00de\nsince this guarantees that P\nnAlmn\u00f0p; eg\u00dee\u2212inqr is confined to a half of the complex plane and must return to the same complex argument after one period. The condition (35) is clearly satisfied for low eccentricity orbits since Almn \u00bc O\u00f0egn\u00de. However, condition (35) is easily violated by high eccentricity zoom-whirl orbits. Nonetheless, we observe empirically that the average of the second term (32) vanishes in all geodesic waveforms used in this work. We thus find that in the \u03bd \u2192 0 limit we have exactly,\n\u03a9r0PA \u00bc \u03a9rgeo; and h\u03c90PAi \u00bc 2\u03a9geo: \u00f036\u00de\nThis, of course, does not come as a surprise, since this is precisely what the frequency recovery procedure of Secs.

Figure 5 shows both the frequencies, \u03a9r0PA and h\u03c90PAi=2, recovered from a SMR 0PAwaveform at equal mass (\u03bd \u00bc 1=4) and the geodesic frequencies, \u03a9rgeo and \u03a9geo, inferred from the underlying inspiral dynamics. Even at equal mass there is hardly any perceivable difference between the two sets of frequencies. To compare the frequencies obtained through the two procedures more closely we pick three frequencies along the adiabatic inspiral depicted in Fig. 5. For each of these frequencies we generate a series of adiabatic inspirals with symmetric mass-ratios varying between \u03bd \u00bc 10\u22123 and \u03bd \u00bc 1=4 going through that point (and randomized initial values of qr). For each of these inspirals we extract the azimuthal and radial frequency from the waveform using the procedure of Secs. II B and II C. Figure 6 shows the difference between these frequencies and the corresponding values obtained directly from the underlying geodesic. We observe a small, but measurable, difference between the two sets of frequencies, which appears to grow linearly with \u03bd and is larger for higher frequencies. Since the SMR 0PA waveform contains no higher order frequency corrections, this difference arises purely from unintended side effects of the frequency recovery procedure. Some contributing factors are the averaging over a radial period while the inspiral is evolving, and limitations in establishing a radial period in the first place."

The snapshot waveform hlm is a biperoidic function of the radial and azimuthal phases qr and \u03d5 as described by Eq. (31). Using the expression for \u03c922 in Eq.

We will refer to this quantity as egeogw . We obtain a numerical representation of the function egeogw \u00f0p; eg\u00de by taking grid of numerical SMR solutions of the Teukolsky equation, and interpolating the result with Chebyshev polynomials to obtain egeogw with a relative accuracy of 10\u22127 across the relevant parameter space.

            "text": "In this section we study several options for the variables describing the state of a binary inspiral. We present some of the choices of variables made in the literature when comparing SMR and NR results, discuss their applicability in the eccentric case and, finally, describe the choice of variables which better adapt to our study. The instantaneous state of a nonspinning eccentric binary is captured by four dynamical variables. For example, in the SMR setup these are the \u00f0p; eg; qr;\u03d5\u00de that appear in Eq. (27). In this work we are interested in comparing quantities that are observable for a distant observer. Since the instantaneous value of \u03d5 is completely degenerate with the position of this observer, it carries no\nuseful information about the state of the binary. Moreover, we are presently interested in observables that are integrated over a radial cycle, eliminating qr. Thus we can identify the instantaneous state of the binary with two variables, like \u00f0p; eg\u00de. Of course, \u00f0p; eg\u00de are not gauge invariant and therefore not useful to find an NR simulation in the same instantaneous state. In order to compare the SMR and NR results, we need a set of two variables that can fix the instantaneous state of the binary and be unambiguously computed both in NR and the SMR formalism. One pair of variables extensively used in the literature [56,64] are the azimuthal and radial frequencies h\u03a9orbi and h\u03a9rorbi defined in analogy to Eqs. (7) and (11) from the orbital frequency \u03a9orb. These two frequencies can be calculated analytically at geodesic order in the SMR formalism [107], and they can be extracted from NR data [56]. However, since they are derived from the coordinate trajectories in NR, they are not fully gauge invariant (e.g.,\nFig. 17 of [114]). A second possibility are frequencies computed from the gravitational radiation instead, e.g., h\u03c922i and h\u03a9r22i, which are manifestly gauge invariant. Then, as shown in Secs. III and IV, the orbit-averaged azimuthal frequencies from the waveform and the trajectories can be related by a factor 2, while the radial frequency stays the same. These frequencies are plotted in the top panel of Fig. 8. For some portions of NR simulations the ratio h\u03c922i=\u00f02h\u03a9r22i\u00de lies below the value of the corresponding circular orbit at the same h\u03c922i, i.e., the NR frequencies fall outside the range spanned by geodesics. It might be possible to rectify this situation by applying a linear mass-ratio gravitational self-force correction to the NR frequencies. This would, however, result in a very convoluted analysis requiring SMR inputs on the NR side of the comparison. Thus, to avoid such a complication we discard the radial and azimuthal frequencies as independent variables to describe both NR and SMR eccentric inspirals.\nA third possibility as a pair of independent variables are the binding energy, Eb, and the dimensionless angular momentum, j. This pair of variables has been extensively used for comparisons between NR simulations and effective-one-body (EOB) evolutions [115\u2013117]. Both quantities can be analytically calculated at geodesic order in the SMR formalism [107], and they can also be extracted from the NR simulations. Nonetheless, the computation of the reduced angular momentum and the binding energy from NR simulations requires the application of some unknown offsets to both quantities. This is due to the fact that Eb and j are reconstructed by integrating the fluxes to infinity and using the initial (ADM) or final mass and angular momentum. However, the fluxes at the start of the simulations, due to junk radiation, and at the end, due to the exponential power decay during ringdown, are not very well resolved. Consequently, the obtained Eb\u2013j curves are\n124040-12\ngenerally off by a shift in the Eb\u2013j plane [116]. Even after that shift is applied, it is possible that the NR data exist in the region of the Eb\u2013j plane that is inaccessible by geodesics. Thus, in order to avoid the introduction of systematics from the determination of the offset in Eb and j, here we do not consider them as independent variables for the mapping between SMR and NR configurations. Finally, we present a combination of variables such that Schwarzschild geodesics and NR simulations lie in the same region of parameter space. These variables are the eccentricity measure egw, defined in Eqs. (5) and (6), and the orbit-averaged azimuthal frequency computed from the (2,2)-mode, h\u03c922i, defined in Eq. (7). The lower panel of Fig. 8 displays egw as a function of h\u03c922i, for the NR simulations in Table I and for Schwarzschild geodesics. The egw\u2013h\u03c922i plane is naturally overlapping for both NR and Schwarzschild geodesics, without the need of any\nshifts or rescalings. This eccentricity definition by construction spans the range from 0 (circular) to 1 (parabolic orbit). This remains true at any level of the SMR approximation. Additionally, we note that given a (2,2)-mode waveform egw is uniquely determined, and thus, it is a gauge invariant observable. However, we note that the leading order contribution to egw cannot be computed analytically in the SMR formalism but requires solving the first order field equations numerically. Similarly, the next-to-leading order in mass-ratio correction to egw requires the second order metric perturbation, which has not yet been calculated for eccentric orbits. Consequently, calculating the next-to-leading order contribution to the expansion of any observable at fixed egw and h\u03c922i requires obtaining the second order metric perturbation. (The only exception to this are quantities at fixed egw \u00bc 0 or egw \u00bc 1, since the higher order corrections to these values are zero by construction.) In the limit egw \u2192 0, fixing egw and h\u03c922i reduces to the usual comparisons done for quasicircular inspirals. Hence, we consider these two variables, egw and h\u03c922i, as our independent variables for the comparison of NR and SMR inspirals."

We consider the orbit-averaged energy and angular momentum fluxes from the NR simulations in Table I, computed using Eqs. (13)\u2013(15), as well as the periastron advance K, computed using Eq. (12). The orbit-averaged fluxes extracted from the NR simulations are illustrated in the top two rows of Fig. 9. In order to reduce the dynamical range of the fluxes, we rescale them with the Newtonian (0PN) quasicircular values for these quantities [16],\nh _EQC;0PNgw i \u00bc 32 5 \u03bd2\u03a910=3orb ; \u00f037a\u00de\nh_JQC;0PNz;gw i \u00bc 32 5 \u03bd2\u03a97=3orb : \u00f037b\u00de\nHere, \u03a9orb denotes the orbital frequency for which we substitute h\u03c922i=2; see Sec. III for details. The rescaling by Eqs. (37) produces a smooth dependence of the fluxes in parameter space, with practically no curves crossing each other. This is because most of the mass ratio dependence is already accounted for by the rescaling factors. In the right-hand panels, the data are plotted as function of egw only. This projection highlights how well the normalization accounts for the \u03bd- and\n124040-13\nh\u03c922i-dependence, with only the eccentricity-dependence remaining. The eccentricity dependence qualitatively resembles the expected analytical behaviour for the energy flux for eccentric binaries with corrections of the form\n\u223c 1\u00f01\u2212e2\u00dex \u00f01\u00fe ae2 \u00fe be4 \u00fe \u00de, where x \u00bc 7=2 or 2, for the energy and angular momentum fluxes respectively, while a and b are coefficients which can be found in [118,119]. We do not introduce eccentric corrections to the rescaling\n124040-14\nfactors as our eccentricity definition, egw, only reduces to the temporal eccentricity, et, at Newtonian order, while higher PN order corrections may be important to reproduce the eccentricity dependence of the NR fluxes, especially at the end of the inspiral regime. Hence, we leave the exploration of the eccentricity dependence of the NR fluxes for future work. The periastron advance is not rescaled, since the Newtonian value is simply 1 by Kepler\u2019s first law. As a consequence, a larger dependence of this quantity on mass ratio is observed when projected into the KNR \u2212 egw plane. While the values corresponding to a fixed reference of \u03c9ref22 \u00bc 0.042 (red circles) as a function of eccentricity show a similar behavior as the fluxes. Overall, the inspection of the NR curves in Fig. 9 indicates that most of the mass ratio dependence may be already captured by the leading order mass ratio contribution. Moving to the comparison of NR against SMR results, the NR and SMR fluxes rescaled by the leading order symmetric mass ratio squared as well as the periastron advance, are shown in Figs. 10\u201312 for three different reference frequencies representative of the full inspiral, M\u03c9ref22 \u00bc 0.034, 0.042, 0.063. The SMR fluxes are determined numerically from geodesic snapshots at the quantities selected in Sec. V, \u00f0\u03bd; egw;\u03c9ref22 \u00de, as explained in Sec. IV. The SMR values for the periastron advance correspond to the analytic geodesic result for the periastron advance, which can be readily obtained from expressions available in the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit [120],\nKSMR \u00bc 2pK\n4eg\np\u22126\u00fe2eg\n\u03c0 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi p\u00f0p \u2212 6\u00fe 2eg\u00de p ; \u00f038\u00de\nwhere K is the complete elliptical integral of the first kind, and p and eg have been evaluated at the corresponding values of \u03c9ref22 and egw. In the case of the fluxes (Figs. 10 and 11), both NR and SMR show qualitatively good agreement, which is maintained with increasing eccentricity. This indicates that the effect of eccentricity is well captured by the SMR calculations. Additionally, the dependence on mass ratio when rescaling by the leading order symmetric mass ratio contribution is small. The qualitative agreement between the NR and SMR degrades with increasing reference frequency, as expected because higher order mass ratio corrections are larger in the strong field. The periastron advance, shown in Fig. 12, has a stronger dependence on mass ratio than the fluxes, especially at high frequencies. As in the case of the fluxes, with increasing eccentricity the agreement of the periastron advance between NR and SMR does not substantially degrade, indicating that eccentric effects are accurately described within SMR theory using adiabatic evolutions. Overall, for both fluxes and periastron\nadvance the SMR curves overestimate the NR results for all frequencies, mass ratios and eccentricities. Before proceeding to a more quantitative comparison of the difference between NR and SMR, we assess the accuracy of the NR values shown in Figs. 10\u201312 by comparing NR data obtained with different numerical settings. The data in Figs. 10\u201312 were obtained from the highest numerical resolution (Lev3) with applied center-of-mass (CoM)\n124040-15\ncorrection,6 extrapolation order 4, and all the spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes up to l \u2264 8. For the particular reference frequency of \u03c9ref22 \u00bc 0.042, we show in Fig. 13 the absolute difference between the quantities computed from this reference waveform against the same quantities calculated from a waveform, where one of the previous conditions is modified at a time. Precisely, the differences are computed against a waveform without CoM correction; using extrapolation order 3; a lower resolution (Lev2), and also in the case in which only l \u2264 4 modes are included. The largest differences for the three quantities typically occur when comparing against the lower resolution (Lev2). Furthermore, the individual errors are summed in quadrature for an overall error estimate for the subsequent analysis. We now perform a more quantitative comparison of SMR and NR results for the particular reference frequency, \u03c9ref22 \u00bc 0.042. The difference between the SMR and NR fluxes rescaled by the leading order power of symmetric mass ratio as a function of eccentricity are shown in the top and mid left panels of Fig. 14, while in the bottom panels the differences for periastron advance are displayed. Each data point carries the error bar determined through the analysis in Fig. 13. We see that at 0PA order there is already good agreement between NR and SMR results, with relative differences typically of the order \u227210%, with the largest discrepancies occurring at equal masses, as expected from a small mass ratio expansion.\nGiven the visible mass ratio trends in the left panels of Fig. 14, we rescale by another power of symmetric mass ratio to estimate the magnitude of the unknown 1PA contributions. The right panels of Fig. 14 show that this\n6We perform center-of-mass correction and extrapolation of the waveforms using the scri package [121], which implements the methods developed in [122\u2013124].\n124040-16\nscaling collapses the three quantities into one-dimensional curves. These one-dimensional curves represent the nextto-leading order 1PA contribution to the respective quantity, as a function of eccentricity. The small residual spread in mass ratio in these curves represents unknown yet higher order terms. The fact that the right panels of Fig. 14 collapse to quasi one-dimensional curves indicates that such \u2265 2PA contributions are small compared to the 1PA contribution.\nAdditionally, we have added to the right top and mid panels of Fig. 14 the second order self-force results for the quasicircular fluxes from [63]. The agreement is good, but a small shift is noticeable between the quasicircular results with respect to our eccentric results. This feature may be a consequence due to the fact that the results from [63] are based on a two-timescale expansion computed from the self-force dynamics, while our fluxes are averaged over a radial period of an evolving SMR waveform. However, a\n124040-17\nmore detailed study is required to determine the source of this small discrepancy, which is within the error bars. In the case of the periastron advance, when rescaling by an additional power of symmetric mass ratio in the bottom right panel of Fig. 14, we include also the quasi-circular 1PA SMR result [64,65] and the two quasicircular nonspinning NR simulations (q \u00bc 1; 1=8) from [88]. The eccentric results have comparatively large error bars at small eccentricities because the amplitude of the oscillations in\u03c922 (from which all quantities are derived) becomes small and more difficult to resolve. A similar shift as in the case of the fluxes is present in the bottom right panel of Fig. 14 between the quasicircular results from [88] and the low-eccentricity data points of our new analysis. We leave for future work the precise determination of such small differences between our results for the fluxes and the periastron advance, and the existing quasicircular results from the literature. Finally, we remark that the dependence of the fluxes and periastron advance with eccentricity resembles a functional form as expected from the PN results [118,119,125], where for instance the eccentric corrections to the fluxes are of the form \u223c 1\u00f01\u2212e2\u00dex \u00f01\u00fe ae2 \u00fe \u00de, where x and a are coefficients to be determined. This suggests that fitting such results as a function of eccentricity and mass ratio could provide some phenomenological expressions for the unknown 1PA SMR terms as a function of eccentricity, mass ratio and frequency, as a similar eccentricity dependence is observed for other frequencies in the inspiral. We leave such a task for future work, as well as the production of new eccentric NR simulations at smaller mass ratios, which may help assess the contributions of the unknown higher order terms in the SMR perturbation theory for eccentric nonspinning binaries."

            "text": "We have presented a new set of BBH NR simulations produced with the SpEC code with the objective of exploring the accuracy of the small mass-ratio expansion for eccentric nonspinning binary black holes. In particular, our study aims to extend recent work [41] on assessing the accuracy of the SMR theory for nonspinning quasicircular BBH to nonspinning eccentric BBHs. The simulations produced in this work cover mass ratios, q \u2208 \u00bd0.1; 1 , initial eccentricities, e0gw \u2208 \u00bd0.01; 0.8 , and initial mean anomalies close to apastron, l0 \u223c \u03c0. Each simulation is performed at three different resolutions, and most of them have \u227320 orbits, which makes our dataset the one with the longest eccentric BBH simulations to date. These simulations are compared to waveforms produced using the gravitational self-force formalism. Using an existing frequency domain Teukolsky code [108\u2013110], we have generated eccentric inspirals in a Schwarzschild\nbackground that are accurate to leading order in the SMR expansion. As a first step towards comparing the NR and SMR results, we adapted the orbit-average method from [56] to extract the radial and azimuthal frequencies, the energy and angular momentum fluxes, and measure the eccentricity from waveforms. We have validated this procedure to extract orbit-averaged frequencies by using the 0PA inspirals, where the geodesic azimuthal and radial frequencies are provided as an outcome of performing such evolutions. We find that the procedure of extracting the frequencies, and eccentricities produces relative differences of 10\u22125 in the early inspiral, while the discrepancies increase up to \u223c10\u22122 close to merger due to a combination of the boundary effects and the rapid increase of the frequencies, which is a clear limitation of the procedure. Thus, we restrict this study to the inspiral part of the waveform, and leave for future work an improvement of the extraction procedure to describe more faithfully the transition from inspiral to plunge of the signal. We investigated eccentricity e\u03a9orb defined from the orbital frequency and eccentricity e\u03c922 defined from the gravitational wave (2,2) mode, and found them to systematically differ. Using PN theory we have derived relations between different definitions of eccentricity. The instantaneous orbital and (2,2)-mode frequency are not related by the simple factor 2 for eccentric binaries, as is the case of the orbit-averaged frequencies, and thus, we have provided PN-accurate expressions relating both, which produce relative differences of \u223c10\u22122 when tested on NR simulations. Furthermore, we have provided PN-accurate expressions relating e\u03a9orb , e\u03c922 and the temporal eccentricity, et. We show that in the Newtonian limit e\u03c922 \u223c 3et=4, so that e\u03c922 does not have the correct Newtonian limit. In Eq. (6), we propose a new eccentricity definition egw based on the (2,2)-mode frequency, which reduces to et in the Newtonian limit. Comparisons between NR and SMR require a map which associates a SMR inspiral with the instantaneous state of an eccentric NR inspiral. We investigated several proposals in the literature for variables that identify the same inspiral in the NR simulations and SMR evolutions. We find that some choices used in the literature lead to the NR simulations lying outside the range spanned by the geodesic results, hampering comparisons. We propose to use as variables the orbit-averaged azimuthal frequency, h\u03c922i, and eccentricity egw, measured both from the instantaneous frequency of the (2,2)-mode, which do not suffer from this limitation. Moving to the comparison between NR and SMR results, we have focused on the energy and angular momentum fluxes, as well as the periastron advance. Overall, we find good agreement between the NR and SMR values, with relative differences typically \u227210%, and no particular degradation with increasing eccentricity.\n124040-18\nWe assess the contributions coming from the unknown higher order term in the PA expansion (1PA) by considering the difference between the NR and SMR fluxes and periastron advance. After rescaling by the symmetric mass-ratio cubed, we find that the differences collapse to one dimensional curves as a function of eccentricity with very small spread in mass ratio; see Fig. 14. This behavior indicates that the next order term in the SMR expansion (2PA) has a very small contribution compared to the 1PA term. Furthermore, we compare these differences for the fluxes and the periastron against available results in the literature for quasicircular binaries from [63,88], and find that the results are consistent with our findings, except for small shifts which are within the error bars. We leave for future work the precise determination of the origin of this small feature. The eccentricity dependence of the fluxes and periastron advance rescaled by symmetric mass ratio also suggests a functional form similar to the one predicted by the known PN results [118,119,125]. An interesting extension of the work presented here would be the modeling of these differences between the adiabatic SMR inspirals and the NR simulations, by fitting them as a function of mass ratio, eccentricity and orbit-averaged frequency fq; egw; h\u03c922ig, and provide some phenomenological expressions which can be used to compute the unknown 1PA term for the fluxes and periastron advance. Another possible future direction is to focus on comparing the phasing between NR and SMR, and extend previous studies for quasicircular binaries [41] to the eccentric case. Future work will also include extending our set of simulations to higher mass ratios, and to gradually incorporate spins. Other applications of the simulations will include the calculation of the redshift factor [126], extending current studies on quasicircular binaries [127] to the eccentric case. Finally, these simulations will also be of paramount relevance to assess the accuracy of the currently existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models [57,128\u2013131]."

            "text": "The quasiequilibrium, extended conformal thin sandwich initial data used by SpEC requires choice of two sets of input parameters. The first set consists of masses and spins of the two black holes. The second set determines the orbital configuration of the two BHs. This second set consists of an initial separation D0=M0, an initial instantaneous orbital frequencyM0\u03a90 and the initial instantaneous radial velocity a0 \u00bc _r=r (see [80\u201382] for details). Our task is to determine this second set of initial-data parameters such that the subsequent evolution has an eccentricity close to a certain desired value e0 and an inspiral of reasonable length (20\u201350 orbits). Let us first point out three considerations that will influence our procedure: First, as discussed in Sec. II A the present radial map used in SpEC cannot accommodate that the distance between the two black holes increases by more than a factor 1.5. We will avoid this problem by starting NR simulation near apastron.7 Second, there are previous results on how the tangential momentum in an eccentric binary varies with the eccentricity. Specifically, we will utilize the correction factor of the tangential momentum [49],\n\u03bb0t \u00f0r; e; \u03bd; sign\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe sign \u00d7 e 2 \u00d7 1 \u2212 1 r \u00f02\u00fe \u03bd\u00de ; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere r is the orbital separation and sign \u00bc 1 is the sign of the correction [49]. While this correction has been derived in the low eccentricity limit, it has been shown [61] to be useful to determine the initial parameters in eccentric moving puncture simulations. We average the correction with both signs to arrive at\n\u03bb\u03040t \u00f0r; e; \u03bd\u00de \u00bc 1\n2 \u00d7\n\u03bb0t \u00f0r; e; \u03bd;\u22121\u00de \u00fe\n1\n\u03bb0t \u00f0r; e; \u03bd;\u00fe1\u00de ; \u00f0A2\u00de\nas in Eq. (2.3) of [61]. The third consideration concerns the choice of coordinates: our SpEC simulations start from superposed harmonic Kerr (SHK) data [78], whereas Eq. (A1) was derived in Arnowitt-Desner-Misner transverse-traceless (ADMTT) coordinates. Therefore, we will also employ a coordinate transformation from ADMTT coordinates to harmonic coordinates. Overall, we proceed as follows: (1) Choose mass-ratio q \u2264 1, and a desired eccentricity\ne0. Set spins \u03c7 i \u00bc 0, masses m1 \u00bc 1=\u00f01\u00fe q\u00de,\n7Very recently a new radial map has been developed and implemented in SpEC, which avoids these restrictions.\n124040-19\nm2 \u00bc q=\u00f01\u00fe q\u00de (so that M0 \u00bc m1 \u00fem2 \u00bc 1), and \u03bd \u00bc m1m2=M20 \u00bc q=\u00f01\u00fe q\u00de2. (2) Choose a tentative initial separation as the apastron distance of a Newtonian binary with periastron distance of rp \u00bc 9M0, i.e., D\u03030 \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe e0\u00de\u00d7 \u00f01 \u2212 e0\u00de\u22121rp. If a PN evolution with the same parameters indicates that the inspiral may be too short, increase D\u03030. (3) Compute 3.5PN quasicircular estimates for the tangential and radial momenta, p0t ; p0r in ADMTT coordinates using Eqs. (A2) and (2.16) in [61]. (4) Calculate the correction factor \u03bb\u0304t using Eq. (A2). (5) Construct the ADMTT position and momentum\nvectors in Cartesian coordinates,\nxADMTT \u00bc \u00f00; D\u03030; 0\u00de; \u00f0A3\u00de\npADMTT \u00bc \u00f0p0r ; \u03bb\u03040t p0t ; 0\u00de: \u00f0A4\u00de\nHere, we placed the black holes on the y-axis. Note that \u03bb\u0304t \u2264 1, so that the tangential momentum is reduced, consistent with our goal to start at apastron. (6) Apply the transformation from ADM to harmonic coordinates [132] to obtain the position and velocity vector in harmonic coordinates,\nxH \u00bc Y\u00bdxADMTT; pADMTT ; \u00f0A5\u00de\nvH \u00bc V\u00bdxADMTT; pADMTT ; \u00f0A6\u00de\nwhere Y and V are operators mapping the ADM coordinates to harmonic coordinates expanded up to 3PN order [132]. (Note that the expressions in [132] are restricted to nonspinning binaries.) (7) Read of the initial data parameters from the position and velocity vectors in harmonic coordinates,\nD0 \u00bc jxHj; \u00f0A7\u00de\n\u03a90 \u00bc jxH \u00d7 vHj\nD20 ; \u00f0A8\u00de\na0 \u00bc vH \u00b7 xH\nD20 ; \u00f0A9\u00de\nwhere Euclidean vector operations are used. Figure 15 compares the target eccentricity e0 with the actual eccentricity e0gw achieved near the start of each simulation. There is an offset between these eccentricities. We note that specially for high eccentricities the use of the correction factor is not accurate due to the fact that it is an expression derived in the low eccentricity limit. Furthermore, we attribute the larger differences between our target and measured initial eccentricities as compared to other studies like [61] due to the assumptions on the\nidentification we made between harmonic and superposed harmonic coordinates, and inaccuracies in the PN expressions for the eccentric corrections being amplified due to the transformation from the ADM to the harmonic gauge. The calculation of the initial parameters presented in this section is useful for placing points in the eccentric parameter space with a limited accuracy. In the future we plan to adopt an iterative procedure to specify the desired initial eccentricity and mean anomaly as done in [58,133], to accurately and efficiently populate the eccentric parameter space."

            "text": "In this appendix we assess the accuracy of the NR waveforms listed in Table I. For each simulation SpEC employs multiple subdomains. The shape, size and number of subdomains is dynamically varied during the simulations according to the spectral adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) procedure [79,134]. The accuracy of the simulations is controlled by a tolerance parameter which determines when AMR should add or remove grid points within a given subdomain, and when a subdomain should be split into two, or when two neighboring subdomains should be combined into one. As a consequence, it is difficult to obtain strict convergence as a function of the AMR tolerance parameter. Convergence may fail, for instance, due to two identical simulation having different AMR tolerances in a particular subdomain modifying the number of grid points in it, or different subdomain boundaries in a particular time. Notwithstanding these issues, most simulations in the SXS catalog show convergence with the AMR tolerance [50]. In this work we have run each simulation at three different AMR tolerances, henceforth called different\n124040-20\nresolutions for brevity. This appendix extends the error analysis of our main results with calculations of the mismatch between waveforms obtained at the highest and second highest resolutions. Following Ossokine et al. 2020 [135], we compute the SNR-weighted mismatch between waveforms computed from the highest and the next-to-highest resolutions. The mismatches are computed for binary masses 20 M\u2299 \u2264 M \u2264 200M\u2299, and using as a Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Advanced LIGO\u2019s zero-detuned high-power design sensitivity curve [136]. When both waveforms are in band, we use fmin \u00bc 10 Hz and fmax \u00bc 2048 Hz, as the lower and upper bounds of the integral. For waveforms where this is not the case, we set fmin \u00bc 1.05fstart, where fstart is the starting frequency of the NR waveform. To represent dependence on M, we compute the mean and the maximum over M. The results of the mismatch calculation are shown in Fig. 16. The vertical dashed lines denote the\nmedian values of each distribution. We note that the median value of the maximum mismatch is below 10\u22123, while for the mean mismatch is \u223c10\u22124. Three simulations (SXS: BBH:2517, SXS:BBH:2525, SXS:BBH:2564) have maximum mismatches above 1%, M\u0304SNRmax \u00bc 0.011; 0.065, 0.041, respectively. The highest mismatch occurs for SXS: BBH:2525 which is both the shortest evolution in our dataset (making it more prone to systematics due to the ringdown transition in SpEC [68,70]), and which was also the first simulation produced in our dataset, so it does not take into account some improvements in SpEC, which have been introduced during this project (see Sec. II for details). Overall, the mismatches are comparable to the ones obtained in the SXS catalog for quasicircular binaries [50] (see Fig. 9 there, but note that [50] uses a flat PSD). This indicates that SpEC is capable to perform simulation of eccentric BBH with a numerical error comparable to the quasicircular case."

(C10) is for eccentricity reduction/control purposes, where short evolutions are done to iteratively converge to the desired value of eccentricity. In these methods [44,49,81,82] one typically chooses a trajectory-based definition of eccentricity instead of a waveform-based one due to the extra computational cost, which involves the evolution of the gravitational radiation reaching the extraction radii. However, with the expressions provided in Eq. (C10), one can obtain an approximation of e\u03c922 from the coordinates."

            "text": "Most eccentric waveform models for compact binaries use PN theory to describe the inspiral regime and/or their initial parameters [92\u2013100,129,131,138]. A commonly used description of eccentric orbits is the quasi-Keplerian parametrization [92] where three different eccentricity parameters et, er and e\u03d5 describe the orbit [137]. These three eccentricities are not independent from each other, and they are all related at a given PN order. Eccentric PN waveform models typically use the temporal eccentricity, et, as the eccentricity parameter. In the following, PN-accurate\nexpressions between the eccentricity defined from the orbital frequency, e\u03a9orb , and et, are computed. In order to perform this calculation we use the 3PN expression for \u03a9orb, which can be found in Appendix A of [54]. The calculation of e\u03a9orb requires the values of the orbital frequency at periastron and apastron, which correspond to values of the eccentric anomaly of u \u00bc 0 and u \u00bc \u03c0, respectively. Thus, at the turning points, the orbital frequency can be expressed as\n\u03a9a;porb \u00bc x3=2\u00f0\u03a90PNorb \u00fe \u03b3\u03a91PNorb \u00fe \u03b32\u03a92PNorb \u00fe \u03b33\u03a93PNorb \u00de; \u00f0C16\u00de\nwhere \u03b3 is the PN bookkeeping parameter.
