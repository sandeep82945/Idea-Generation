The portion of the text mentioning future research directions includes:

1. "Therefore, in order to get stage-wise cost, it is highly recommended that SHI data should be linked with German cancer registry data. However, the data linkage approval process is challenging in Germany due to stringent data protection laws and the engagement of several authorities, making the approval process challenging. An alternative would be collecting clinical data (stage at diagnosis) by the SHI agencies so that cost information can be linked to the BC stages resulting in stage-wise BC costs."

2. "Given the recent advancements in personalized oncology, newer diagnostic tools, and targeted medicine, the average and stage-wise cost of care could substantially increase. Therefore, modeling studies may be instrumental in projecting the national medical cost of breast cancer. However, model adjustments and the inclusion of new treatments, recurrent and progressive BC are contingent upon the availability of data."

3. "Moreover, factoring age and BC survival in the cost model are essential. It is estimated that the overall cost among younger cancer patients is 20% to 50% higher compared to all patients for the initial and terminal phases of care (50). The higher costs may be attributed to the aggressive BC care in young women because they are more likely to be diagnosed with BC stages II and III (stage 2 BC: 44.3 vs. 29.9%, respectively; stage 3 BC: 14.0 vs. 7.7%, respectively), triple-negative BC (21.2 vs. 13.8%, respectively), and HER2-positive (HER2+: 26.0 vs. 18.6%, respectively) compared to middle-aged women (50, 51). Therefore, future studies should consider age while estimating stage-wise costs."

These excerpts suggest areas for future research, including improving data linkage for cost estimation, adjusting models to account for new treatments and technologies, and considering age and survival rates in cost models.
