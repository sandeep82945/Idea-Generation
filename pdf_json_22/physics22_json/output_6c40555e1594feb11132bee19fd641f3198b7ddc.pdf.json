    "abstractText": "Photonic crystals possess metastructures with a unique dispersion relation. An integrated optical circuit plays a crucial role in quantum computing, for which miniaturized optical components can be designed according to the characteristics of photonic crystals. Because the stable light transmission mode for a square waveguide is transverse electric or transverse magnetic polarization, we designed a half-waveplate element with a photonic crystal that can rotate the polarization direction of the light incident on a waveguide by 90\u25e6. Using the dispersion relation of photonic crystals, the polarization rotation length and the optical axis\u2019s angle of deviation from the electric field in the eigenmode can be effectively calculated. Polarization rotators designed on the basis of photonic crystal structures can effectively reduce the insertion loss of components and exhibit favorable polarization rotation performance.",

            "text": "Photonic crystals, which possess an artificial periodic structure, have a unique dispersion relation and are used extensively in the design of optical components, such as optical lenses [1\u20134], optical waveguides [5,6], and optical waveplates [7\u20139]. Photonic crystals with different structural designs can be exploited to tailor the dispersion relation and spatially exhibit different effective refractive indices of guided modes in the waveguide. Integrated optical circuits [10,11] are expected to play a crucial role in the development of quantum computers. A complete integrated optical circuit for quantum computing can be easily fabricated on a chip by using a miniature optical structure [12\u201315]. In the optical quantum computing design, silicon may be a good material candidate at a certain low operating temperature due to the stable dispersion relation [16]. Because of the inherent properties of photons, the polarization state of light can be considered a quantum mode in quantum calculations. Two orthogonal polarization modes can be selected as optical quantum modes, and a polarization rotator can be used to switch between [15] or facilitate the entanglement of [12] these quantum modes. Miniaturized optical components built into waveguide-type structures are connected with other fibers or waveguides and integrated into the optical circuit on a chip. Currently, waveguides are commonly produced with square cross sections; therefore, the light waves\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2454. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12142454 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2454 2 of 8\ntransmitted in waveguides exhibit transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Most relevant studies have used elements with asymmetric cross sections to achieve conversion between these polarization modes, with the polarization rotation effect being produced by the difference in the transmission constants between these modes. Common methods used to achieve polarization rotation include embedding the main waveguide in the corner of the outer waveguide [12,17], digging a groove on one side of a waveguide [18,19], cutting one side of a square waveguide into an oblique shape [20\u201323], and developing a waveguide with an L-shaped (asymmetric) [24,25] or double-stair cross section [26]. One particular avenue that was recently proposed in this context is using the photonic crystal [27]. Chen designed a polarization rotator based on one-dimensional photonic crystals. In addition to using arrays of air cylinders to produce asymmetric cross sections, they used photonic crystals to design a new type of polarization rotator with high performance and potential. In this study, we designed a waveguide-type wave plate element with one-dimensional photonic crystals. We formed an asymmetric waveguide cross section by placing periodic arrays of air cubes on a square Si waveguide to create two polarization modes with different effective refractive indices of the guided mode in the waveguide (nf and ns). The angle between the optical axis and the coordinate axis of the two modes in the crystals was 45\u25e6, enabling the polarization angle to be rotated by 90\u25e6 beyond a certain length (L\u03c0) in the wave plate element to achieve TE\u2013TM conversion. We calculated the polarization rotation length L\u03c0 by analyzing the photonic crystal band structure and determined the angle between the optical axis and the coordinate axis (optical axis deviation angle) by using the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field in the eigenmode. Changes in the geometric parameters of the air cubes can cause changes in the deviation angle, effective refractive index, and insertion loss (IL) in the eigenmode. Therefore, when maintaining L\u03c0 between 2.5 and 3 \u00b5m, we adjusted the geometric parameters of the air cubes to reduce the IL and thus improve the performance of the structure of the wave plate element."

We used an air cube array on one side of the square waveguide to form a tooth-shaped waveguide, as shown in Figure 1a. A SiO2 substrate (dark gray area in Figure 1) was placed below the waveguide. The waveguide (light gray area in Figure 1) consisted of square waveguides at the front and back for guiding electromagnetic waves and a tooth-shaped multi-period waveguide. These waveguides were made of Si and placed beneath an air layer that occupied the space above (not illustrated here). The refractive indices of SiO2, Si, and air were set as 1.46, 3.46, and 1, respectively. Figure 1b depicts a unit cell and the detailed structural parameters of the periodic tooth-like structures, where a is the lattice constant, H is the height of the waveguide, and W is the width of the waveguide. We defined the thickness, depth, and width of the air cube in the waveguide as a \u00d7 DC, H \u00d7 DP, and W \u00d7 DW, respectively. To maintain the asymmetry of the waveguide\u2019s cross section (similar to an L-shape), we limited DC, DP, and DW to 0.2\u20130.8. We used the finite-element method (FEM) to simulate the light transmission behaviors and the photon band structures in the full structure. Band structures and light transmission behaviors were determined using eigenmode analysis and frequency\u2013domain analysis, respectively. In the calculation of the eigenmode, we only used a unit cell with a width of a (Figure 1b).

We defined the optical axis of the first mode as the slow axis and that of the second mode as the fast axis. The electric field diagrams of the two modes are presented in the insets of Figure 2a. Because the wave incident from the square waveguide exhibits TE or TM polarization, the half-wave-plate conditions must be fulfilled to achieve conversion between the two orthogonal linear polarization modes.

It can be noticed that it should be a reciprocal result when the light comes from the other side of the device due to the same modes.

The inset of Figure 2a shows the optical axis deviation angle \u03b8 in the first mode when DC = DP = DW = 0.5. Using Equation (1), we obtained \u03b8 to be 49.7\u25e6. Because of the presence of a SiO2 substrate under the waveguide, even when the cross section of the waveguide had a symmetric pattern with x = y as the axis of symmetry, the asymmetric material distribution around the waveguide caused the included angle of the optical axis to not be 45\u25e6. According to the characteristics of a half-wave-plate, when the phase difference between the waves passing along the fast and slow axes of a birefringent element is \u03c0, the angle\u03d5 between the original polarization direction and the optical axis is rotated to 2\u03d5 after\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2454 5 of 8\nthese waves are linearly polarized and pass through the element.

To design a structure with \u03b8 = 45\u25e6, we calculated the optical axis deviation angle \u03b8 for the first mode according to the structural parameters DC, DP, and DW.

The aforementioned figure reveals that when DP < 0.4, the slope of the contours gradually decreases, and the gradient distribution gradually shifts to the vertical direction; when the DP value is changed, the DW difference corresponding to the same optical axis angle is not very large.

(a) Contour map of the optical axis deviation angle when DC = 0.5, (b) polarization rotation length, and (c) IL when \u03b8 = 45\u25e6.\nWe extracted the part with L\u03c0 < 3.5 \u00b5m from all the DP and DW combinations on the 45\u25e6 contour line with different DC values, and the corresponding DC, DP, and DW values are listed in Table 1. On the basis of the structural parameters presented in Table 1, L\u03c0 and IL were plotted for different components (Figure 3b,c). The term L\u03c0 was calculated using the refractive index difference obtained through eigenvalue analysis. To determine the IL, tooth-shaped structures with lengths corresponding to the lengths of each structure (L\u03c0) were drawn (e.g., for DC = 0.4, DP = 0.4, and DW = 0.46, L\u03c0 = 3.47 \u00b5m, which is approximately 13.88 times the value of a (=0.25 \u00b5m), and the tooth-shaped structure was drawn for 14 periods). The connected square waveguides in the front and back side of the tooth-shaped region are five periods long, and a y-polarized electromagnetic wave was incident from the x-direction of the square waveguide. The IL can be obtained from the output signal Eout and incident signal Ein received from the output end of the square waveguide as follows:\nIL(dB) = 10 \u00d7 log10 Ein Eout\n(2)\nIt can be noticed that the formula in Equation (2) is similar to the polarization conversion efficiency. The polarization conversion efficiency is defined as the ratio between the output Ez field and the input Ey field, which will show an inverse proportional tendency with the IL. Due to the mechanism of the half-wave plate, the electric field can be almost totally converted to the target component except for the energy loss. The output electric fields\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2454 6 of 8\nin the other two components (i.e., Ex and Ey) are confirmed as one order smaller than the target component Ez. Therefore, we discuss L\u03c0 with IL in the following \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 structures.\nEach line in Figure 3b,c represents a different DC value, and DP is the horizontal axis of this graph. For \u03b8 = 45\u25e6, the smallest value of L\u03c0 (i.e., 2.08 \u00b5m) appeared when DC = 0.8, DP = 0.55, and DW = 0.55. The smallest IL (i.e., 0.43 dB) appeared when DC = 0.4, DP = 0.4, and DW = 0.46. If considering the applications in quantum communications, such a low IL device will be needed. According to the acceptable loss in the system, the relation shown in Figure 3b,c can provide several choices. Figure 3b reveals that, at different DC values, the minimum value of L\u03c0 appeared when 0.5 < DP < 0.6, with corresponding DW values falling in the range of 0.50\u20130.65. The trend in Figure 3c reveals that the IL increased with the DP value. If the DP value was between 0.5 and 0.6, the smallest L\u03c0 value was obtained, and the IL was not too high. When DC increased, L\u03c0 decreased; however, the rate of decrease of L\u03c0 reduced when DC > 0.5. As displayed in Figure 3c, an increase in the DC value resulted in an increase in the IL because an increase in the DC value increased the size of the air cubes and caused energy dissipation into air. In summary, the DC value must be controlled within a certain range to shorten L\u03c0 without increasing the IL substantially. For DP values of 0.5\u20130.6, the L\u03c0 values of each structure were very close to each other. Therefore, suitable geometry parameters could be selected within an appropriate L\u03c0 range to reduce the IL. For example, when DP = 0.6 and DC > 0.5, the required polarization rotation length (L\u03c0) of each element was approximately 2.19 \u00b5m. A structure with DC = 0.5 had a low IL of 1.6 dB. Finally, to find the optimal result among many parameter combinations, we plotted the product of the IL and L\u03c0 (Figure 4) and determined the combination corresponding to the smallest IL and shortest conversion length. Figures 3c and 4 exhibit similar trends, with the overall performance being better when the DC and DP values were small. However, the minimum value of the aforementioned product (1.49) appeared when DC = 0.4, DP = 0.4, and DW = 0.46 (indicated by the arrow), which indicates that a structure with a smaller DC value should be selected to reduce the IL to the greatest extent allowed by L\u03c0. Similarly, structures with smaller DP and DW values exhibit lower IL. The inset in Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the electric field at the point indicated by the arrow, and the inset reveals that the Ey field in this structure (DC = 0.4, DP = 0.4, and DW = 0.46) was completely converted into an Ez field after passing through the photonic crystal wave plate, which confirmed the effectiveness of this structure.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2454 7 of 8\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 9\nDP = 0.4, and DW = 0.46 (indicated by the arrow), which indicates that a structure with a\nsmaller DC value should be selected to reduce the IL to the greatest extent allowed by L\u03c0.\nSimilarly, structures with smaller DP and DW values exhibit lower IL.

For the first step, the patterns of air squares can be defined by E-Beam lithography and etched by dry etching. For the second step, the waveguides\u2019 pattern can be defined by E-Beam lithogra hy wi h alignment key and etched by dry etching process. According to the L\u03c0 or IL relations as a function of DP, DW, and DC shown above, the geometric parameters of the air cube can provide the fabrication tolerance to a certain extent. Finally, by adjusting the included angle of the optical axis of the wave plate structure, this structure can be used in designing waveguide-type polarization rotation devices.\nAuthor Contributions: F.-L.H.: conceptualization, formal analysis, funding acquisition, methodology, project administration, supervision, writing\u2014review and editing; C.-Y.N.: data curation, software, validation, writing\u2014original draft; Y.-P.T.: data curation, formal analysis, methodology, project administration, software, validation, writing\u2014original draft; T.-W.C.: formal analysis, investigation; Y.-T.Y.: investigation, resources; C.-J.F.: investigation, writing\u2014review and editing; H.-M.C.: resources, writing\u2014review and editing; C.-C.C.
