    "abstractText": "Infusions of Valeriana pilosa are commonly used in Peruvian folk medicine for treating gastrointestinal disorders. This study aimed to investigate the spasmolytic and antispasmodic effects of Valeriana pilosa essential oil (VPEO) on rat ileum. The basal tone of ileal sections decreased in response to accumulative concentrations of VPEO. Moreover, ileal sections precontracted with acetylcholine (ACh), potassium chloride (KCl), or barium chloride (BaCl2) were relaxed in response to VPEO by a mechanism that depended on atropine, hyoscine butylbromide, solifenacin, and verapamil, but not glibenclamide. The results showed that VPEO produced a relaxant effect by inhibiting muscarinic receptors and blocking calcium channels, with no apparent effect on the opening of potassium channels. In addition, molecular docking was employed to evaluate VPEO constituents that could inhibit intestinal contractile activity. The study showed that \u03b1-cubebene, \u03b2-patchoulene, \u03b2-bourbonene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b1-guaiene, \u03b3-muurolene, valencene, eremophyllene, and \u03b4-cadinene displayed the highest docking scores on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels, which may antagonize M2 and/or M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and block voltage-gated calcium channels. In summary, VPEO has both spasmolytic and antispasmodic effects. It may block muscarinic receptors and calcium channels, thus providing a scientific basis for its traditional use for gastrointestinal disorders.",

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with significant global healthcare costs [2,3] and decreased quality of life [4]. Existing synthetic antispasmodic drugs may cause unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, blurred\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15082072 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072 2 of 21\nvision, fatigue, and dry mouth. Therefore, discovering new molecules with antispasmodic properties is an important goal for the pharmaceutical industry [5]. Medicinal plants are complex mixtures of compounds that have served as sources of drugs for centuries. Approximately half of the current pharmaceutical therapies are derived from medicinal plants [6]. Little is known about the effects of essential oils on the intestinal microbiota [7], which has been demonstrated to modulate intestinal motility [8\u201311]. Interestingly, short-chain fatty acids, mainly produced by intestinal bacteria, modulate intestinal motility [10]. Valeriana pilosa R & P. is a plant belonging to the genus Valeriana and distributed in the Andean region. In Peru, it is known as \u201cValeriana\u201d, \u201cCoche coche\u201d, \u201cValeriana de paramo\u201d, \u201cOrnamo\u201d, or \u201cBabilla\u201d. Vertical rhizome and attached roots from Valeriana pilosa are widely used as antispasmodic, relaxing, anti-inflammatory, and sleep-promoting agent [12,13]. Our continuous interest in the volatile components of plant species from Chilean and Peruvian Andean highland communities has been the focus of our chemical and biological research projects [14\u201319]. In this study, we report spasmolytic and antispasmodic activities of VPEO on intestinal contractile activity. The VPEO-mediated effect appears to be mediated by muscarinic receptor antagonism, calcium channel blockade, and potassium channel opening, which may explain the traditional use of the plant in gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, we performed in silico molecular docking analyses of the major constituents in VPEO and found that some molecules have the potential to bind to M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2R), M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3R), and voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav1.2)."

A series of seven distinct concentrations of VPEO (1, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL) were administered in 5 min intervals [22].\n2.6.2. Spasmolytic Effect in Precontracted Rat Ileum\nNeurotropic spasm was induced using acetylcholine (ACh), whereas musculotropic spasm was induced using highly concentrated potassium chloride (KCl)- or barium chloride (BaCl2)-containing solutions [22]. Isolated ileal sections were treated with ACh (10\u22125 M), KCl (60 mM), or BaCl2 (5 mM) for 10 min or until a stable contractile plateau (plateau) was reached. Then, different VPEO concentrations (1, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL) were sequentially added to the tissue chamber.\n2.6.3. Antispasmodic VPEO Effect in the Dose\u2013Response Curves of ACh, KCl, and BaCl2 The effect of VPEO on the contractibility in response to ACh was assessed as follows: dose\u2013response experiments (ACh, 10\u221210 to 10\u22123 M) before and after VPEO (250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL) administration were performed in the same experiment. Similar experiments to those described above but contracting the ileal sections with KCl (10\u22124 to 10\u22121 M) or BaCl2 (10\u22128 to 10\u22122 M) were performed.\nDose\u2013response data were fitted to the standard Hill\u2019s function using Graphpad.\n2.6.4. Role of Extracellular Ca2+ Influx in the Intestinal VPEO-Mediated Relaxation\nIn addition to the Tyrode\u00b4s solution, a calcium-free solution was prepared for this experiment. The solution had the following composition (concentrations in mM): KCl 50; NaCl 91.04; MgCl2 1.05; NaHCO3 11.87; NaH2PO4 0.41; glucose 5.55; and EDTA 0.1 [23]. Initially, the tissue was stabilized in normal Tyrode\u00b4s solution and then replaced with a Ca2+-free Tyrode\u00b4s solution. Then, 10 min after the addition of calcium-free solution, the intestinal sections were contracted with ACh 10\u22125 M, followed by the addition of increasing CaCl2 concentrations (0.1 mM; 0.3 mM; 0.6 mM; and 1 mM). Then, the tissue was washed\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072 4 of 21\nwith normal Tyrode\u2019s solution for at least 10 min, followed by the addition of VPEO (250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL) for 20 min [22]. After VPEO incubation in normal Tyrode\u2019s solution, intestinal sections were incubated with VPEO-supplemented calcium-free solution, then contracted with ACh 10\u22125 M, followed by increasing CaCl2 concentrations (0.1 mM; 0.3 mM; 0.6 mM, and 1 mM).\nThe tension was re-adjusted in the middle of the experiment to 1 g when necessary [22].\n2.6.5. Effect of VPEO on Muscarinic Receptors\nTo analyze the role of VPEO in muscarinic receptor activity, experiments were carried out in the absence/presence of atropine (a non-selective muscarinic antagonist) [24], hyoscine butylbromide (M2\u2013M3 blockers) [25], or solifenacin (selective M3 blocker) [26]. First, the tissue was stabilized for 1 h and then washed in 15 min intervals (4\u20135 times) with Tyrode\u2019s solution. The tension was adjusted to 1 g when necessary. Then, ileal sections were treated with increasing doses of VPEO (1, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL). Afterward, the sections were washed 4\u20135 times in 15 min intervals, and the tension was adjusted to 1 g. The tissue was pre-incubated for 20 min with 1.0 \u00b5M atropine, 1.0 \u00b5M hyoscine butylbromide, or 1.0 \u00b5M solifenacin, and then different VPEO concentrations were added (1\u20131000 \u00b5g/mL).\n2.6.6. Effects of VPEO on Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel\nTo determine whether the effect of VPEO was related to the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channel, experiments were performed in the absence and presence of verapamil (a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker). Initially, the tissue was stabilized for 1 h and then washed in 15 min intervals (4\u20135 times). The tension was adjusted again to 1 g if necessary. The tissue was pre-incubated with verapamil (1.0 \u00b5M) [27] for 20 min. Then, different VPEO concentrations (1, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL) were added in intervals of 5 min.\n2.6.7. Effects of VPEO on Potassium Channel Blockers\nThe role of K+ channels in VPEO-induced relaxation was investigated by pre-incubating the ileum rat for 20 min with two K+ channel blockers, namely, glibenclamide [28] (ATP sensitive K+ channel blocker), and barium chloride [29] (an inward rectifier K+ channel blocker). The tissue was stabilized for 1 h and then washed in 15 min intervals (4\u20135 times). The tension was adjusted again to 1 g if necessary. The tissue was pre-incubated with glibenclamide (10 \u00b5M) and barium chloride (1 mM) for 20 min. Then, VPEO was added (1, 10, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u00b5g/mL) in intervals of 5 min for each successive dose, and the response was recorded."

Docking results in 3D representations were obtained using Discovery Studio [40] 3.1 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) molecular graphics system. The co-crystallized ligands were removed from their proteins and saved separately in the PDB format, which was used for redocking their respective protein active domains to validate our docking methodology [20].

Molecular Docking and Ligand Efficiency Analysis of VPEO We have recently described the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the essential oil from Valeriana pilosa roots (VPEO). A total of 47 compounds were identified, where sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the major constituents. Within the sesquiterpenes, the major constituents of VPEO were \u03b1-patchoulene (5.8%), \u03b1-humulene (6.1%), seychellene (7.6%), and patchoulol (20.8%), as well as spathulenol, T-cadinol, and \u03b3-cadinol as minor constituents [20]. Molecular docking was performed to identify possible VPEO constituents that could inhibit some proteins involved in intestinal contractile activity. Based on the results obtained in the current study, we selected M2 and M3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor and Cav1.2 (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel). Table 2 shows a heat map of intermolecular docking energy values of 47 VPEO compounds.

            "text": "We have recently described the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of the essential oil from Valeriana pilosa roots (VPEO). A total of 47 compounds were identified, where sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the major constituents. Within the sesquiterpenes, the major constituents of VPEO were \u03b1-patchoulene (5.8%), \u03b1-humulene (6.1%), seychellene (7.6%), and patchoulol (20.8%), as well as spathulenol, T-cadinol, and \u03b3-cadinol as minor constituents [20]. Molecular docking was performed to identify possible VPEO constituents that could inhibit some proteins involved in intestinal contractile activity. Based on the results obtained in t e current study, we selected M2 a d M3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor and Cav1.2 (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel). Table 2 shows a he t map of intermolecular docking energy values of 47 VPEO compounds. The values appear in a t ree-color scheme (r d\u2013 yellow\u2013green), where red represents the most stable binding energies and green repr sents the l ast stable ones. Tabl 2 shows a cl ar trend of compounds acting as putative inh bitors of th M2 and M3 musc rinic ac tylcholine receptors. Bas d on the inf rmation shown in Table 2, M2 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors appeared to be the best protein targets for some VPEO constituents, as shown by their intermolecular docking energy (\u2206Ebinding), score normalization of the binding energy based on the number of non-hydrogen atoms (IEnorm.binding), and Ligand Efficiency (LE) values. Indeed, using the weighted arithmetic mean values (related to % of composition, see supplementary materials) shown in Table 3 obtained for all compounds, binding values were used for the analysis of M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor: \u2206Ebinding, LE, and IEnorm.binding values were \u22127.67, 0.55, \u22122.06 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, and the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, the \u2206Ebinding, LE, and IEnorm.binding were \u22128.03, 0.58, and \u22122.15 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, respectively, while, in comparison with the Cav1.2 (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) protein target, the \u2206Ebinding, LE, and IEnorm.binding, binding values were \u22125.11, 0.37, and \u22121.37 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121. Therefore, these results show that the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, as a target protein, is probably involved in the effects of VPEO, which means that they might be involved in the anti-spasmodic activities of VPEO compounds.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072 12 of 21\nValues are listed as a three-colored scheme from red (high energy) to green (low energy).\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072 13 of 21\nMolecular docking analyses, Kd values, Ligand Efficiency (LE), Binding Efficiency Index (BEI), Lipophilic Ligand Efficiency (LLE), and normalization of the binding energy score based on the number of non-hydrogen atoms (IEnorm.binding) are summarized in Table 4 for the top 12 (M2 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor) and 11 (M3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor) compounds, of which the most abundant compounds found in the VPEO are presented. The results showed that approximately 60% of the VPEO compounds acted as potential blockers of M2 and M3 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors. In contrast, the others showed higher values and were considered weak blockers with low activity for the other protein target Cav1.2 (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel).\n* Represent the major constituents of the VPEO.\nVPEO compounds obtained from molecular docking (see Table 4) displaying more binding potential to M2 Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor were \u03b2-patchoulene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b3-muurolene, and eremophyllene, while for the M3 Muscarinic Receptor were \u03b1-cubebene, \u03b2-patchoulene, \u03b2-bourbonene, \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b1-guaiene, \u03b1humulene, \u03b3-muurolene, valencene, and \u03b4-cadinene, all obtained \u2206Ebinding values (<\u22129.0) and IEnorm, binding values (<\u22122.2), representing those with the highest interaction with residues close to the active site. In addition, the binding energies were evaluated for the major VPEO compounds, including natural sesquiterpenes such as \u03b1-patchoulene (5.8%), \u03b1-humulene (6.1%), seychellene (7.6%), and patchoulol (20.8%).(Detailed values of the interactions between individual compounds of the essential oil and the mentioned targets can be found supplementary materials) Table 5 lists the non-covalent interactions present in the M2-ligand complex.

Discussion Essential oils are gaining interest due to their intricate chemical composition and diverse pharmacological effects. Among these actions, the antispasmodic effect is well known, although further research is required to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action [41]. Therefore, we studied the antispasmodic effect of Valeriana pilosa root essential oil (VPEO) and its underlying mechanisms of action using the isolated rat ileum ex vivo model. Our findings reveal that VPEO displays spasmolytic and antispasmodic effects in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 \u00b5g/mL. The relaxant activity of VPEO in the isolated rat ileum was reversible after washing, indicating that the inhibition observed was not attributable to intestinal damage caused by the oil\u2019s interaction with cell lipid bilayers [42].\nFigure .

The mAChR family comprises five molecularly distinct subtypes: M1\u2013M5 [44]. Smooth muscle mAChRs consist of M2 and M3 subtypes, with M2 being predominant (M2:M3 = 3\u20135:1) [43,45], although all five mAChR subtypes have been detected in the gastrointestinal smooth muscle at the mRNA level [46]. Activation of mAChRs triggers multiple biochemical and electrical signaling events that result in muscle contraction [47]. Our results demonstrated that VPEO, at a concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL, reduced tonic contraction in ACh-precontracted tissues. Additionally, preincubation of intestinal tissues with VPEO (250 \u00b5g/mL) significantly reduced the pEC50 of the tissue to ACh, as evidenced by a rightward shift in the dose\u2013response curve. These initial findings suggest that VPEO blocks muscarinic receptors involved in rat ileum contraction. To explore this hypothesis, we evaluated whether the presence of muscarinic antagonists such as atropine, hyoscine butylbromide, and solifenacin would attenuate the relaxing effect of VPEO. Our results showed that solifenacin, a selective blocker of M3 muscarinic receptors, slightly reduced the relaxation induced by VPEO, but not significantly. In contrast, hyoscine butylbromide, an M2\u2013M3 muscarinic blocker, significantly reduced the relaxing effect of VPEO. Moreover, when the non-selective muscarinic blocker atropine was employed, the relaxing effect of VPEO on muscle tone in the rat ileum was further reduced. Traditional studies using various mAChR antagonists have suggested that the M3 subtype primarily mediates contraction in visceral smooth muscles, while the contribution of the M2 subtype remains less clear [48,49]. However, other investigations have demonstrated that the M2 subtype modulates contraction, at least in part, by inhibiting cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent relaxation [43] and regulating smooth muscle ion channel activity [50\u201352]. Nevertheless, the precise mAChR subtype that mediates the contractile response remains largely unknown. Our findings indicate that, in addition to blocking M3 receptors, the antispasmodic effect of VPEO also involves modulation of M2 receptors. Consequently, both experimental and theoretical outcomes reveal the impact of VPEO on M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors. There is limited research available on the effects of essential oils on cholinergic receptors expressed in smooth muscle, and a few studies have been published [6]. Molecular interactions between essential oil terpene compounds, such as vanillin, pulegone, eugenol, carvone, carvacrol, carveol, \u03b1-terpineol, thymol, thymoquinone, menthol, menthone, menthone, limonene, and nicotinic cholinergic receptors have been reported [53\u201355]. High concentrations of potassium ions (hypermolar KCl) cause tonic contraction of smooth intestinal muscles by a mechanism that depends on extracellular calcium influx [56,57]. Our study demonstrated that increasing concentrations of VPEO reduced contractions induced by 60 mM KCl. Additionally, when the tissue was pre-incubated for 20 min with the essential oil, the dose\u2013response curves in response to KCl were significantly reduced. The action of VPEO can be attributed to its major component, patchouli alcohol (20.8%), a tricyclic sesquiterpene that has displayed similar results in other types of smooth muscle, such as the aorta [58] and rat corpus cavernosum [59]. However, the synergistic effects of other VPEO components, such as \u03b1-patchoulene (5.8%), \u03b1-humulene (6.1%), and seychellene (7.6%), at lower concentrations cannot be rejected. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the relaxation induced by VPEO was reduced in the presence of verapamil, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker. These results are consistent with similar studies conducted on the rhizome of Valeriana hardwickii Wall, which caused a rightward shift in calcium concentration-response curves in the rabbit jejunum, similar to that caused by verapamil [60,61]. The findings from our study on VPEO suggest the presence of an antispasmodic effect potentially mediated through calcium channel blockade. It has been shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels regulate intestinal contractility [28]. These channels are heterooctameric proteins composed of pore-forming\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 2072 18 of 21\nsubunits of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (KIR) and subunits of the sulfonylurea regulatory receptor (SUR). The data demonstrate decreased intrinsic basal contractility in the small intestine and colon due to increased basal KATP channel activity, which can be inhibited by glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker [62], and BaCl2, an inward rectifier K+ channel blocker [63,64]. We observed that VPEO reduced BaCl2-induced contractions, shifting the dose\u2013response curve to the right, suggesting that VPEO might activate K+ channels, similar to the crude extract of Valeriana wallichii, which displays antispasmodic activity mediated by activation of the KATP channel [65]. To confirm these results, tissues were pre-incubated with glibenclamide and BaCl2, and the relaxing effect of VPEO on basal tone was evaluated. Our results showed that the activation of KATP and KIR channels did not produce the relaxation exhibited by VPEO in the rat ileum. The monoterpenoid group, including compounds such as \u03b1-pinene, myrcene, limonene, p-cymene, 1,8-cineole, camphor, carvone, \u03b1-humulene, and spathulenol isolated from terrestrial plants, represents the chemical group with the highest number of antispasmodic compounds [66], which are also present in VPEO. It is important to mention that several studies have shown that phytochemical analysis of essential oils from numerous plants can induce relaxation in smooth muscle across various animal species, which is often attributed to their antioxidant activity and ability to enhance gut and barrier function in animals [6,49,67]. Terpenes have been demonstrated to enhance gut microbiota, such as D-limonene [68,69], suggesting that this could be a possible explanation for how essential oils produce a calming effect on the gut. In summary, our study provides experimental evidence showing antispasmodic properties of VPEO. Future in vivo experiments evaluating the effect of VPEO on the intestinal microbiota or determining optimal dosage are required to obtain more clues into the potential use of VPEO as a new pharmacological approach for treating muscle spasms."
