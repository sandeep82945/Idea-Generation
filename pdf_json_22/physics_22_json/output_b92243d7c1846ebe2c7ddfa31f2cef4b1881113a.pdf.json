The associated dynamics has been argued to bear a close resemblance to Rabi oscillations characteristic of two-level systems. Here, we address the question of whether this DQPT behavior is merely a manifestation of the limit of an effective two-level system or if it can arise as part of a more complex dynamics. We focus on quantum many-body scarring as a useful toy model allowing us to naturally study state transfer in an otherwise chaotic system. We find that a DQPT signals a change in the dominant contribution to the wave function in the degenerate initial-state manifold, with a direct relation to an OP zero only in the special case of occurring at the midpoint of an evenly degenerate manifold. Our work generalizes previous results and reveals that, in general, periodic DQPTs comprise complex many-body dynamics fundamentally beyond that of two-level systems.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.033090\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the central goals of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body physics is the understanding of dynamical quantum universality classes, the pursuit of which has led to the introduction of several concepts of dynamical phase transitions [1\u20134]. Extending the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking in equilibrium, one concept of dynamical phase transitions is characterized by the order parameter (OP) of the long-time steady state following a quench in a control parameter after starting in an ordered (symmetry-broken) initial state [5\u20137]. The critical value of the quench parameter separates a symmetry broken from a symmetric steady state. In addition to this Landau type of dynamical phase transitions, another concept has been introduced, known as dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs), that relies on a connection to thermal phase transitions [8]. It is based on recognizing that the overlap \u3008\u03c80|\u03c8 (t )\u3009 between the initial state |\u03c80\u3009 and the time-evolved wave function |\u03c8 (t )\u3009 = e\u2212iH\u0302t |\u03c80\u3009, with H\u0302 the quench Hamiltonian, is a boundary partition function with complexified time it representing inverse temperature. Equivalently, the return rate, \u2212 limL\u2192\u221e L\u22121 ln |\u3008\u03c80|\u03c8 (t )\u3009|2, with L the system size, becomes a dynamical analog of the thermal\n*These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020jad.halimeh@physik.lmu.de\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

In the seminal work introducing DQPTs, the model showing this behavior is the integrable transverse-field Ising chain (TFIC) [8]. This model can be solved exactly by mapping it to a two-band free fermionic model using a Jordan-Wigner transformation, where each disconnected momentum sector is a two-level system. For nonintegrable models, e.g., the longrange interacting TFIC or two-dimensional quantum Ising models, the direct connection between DQPTs and OP zeros occurs for large quenches, where the transverse-field strength is much larger than the coupling constant, and which can be considered perturbatively close to classical precession in twolevel systems during the short timescales where this behavior is prominent [10,12,15]. Indeed, for intermediate quenches where this perturbative treatment is no longer valid, this connection breaks down [17\u201319], and for small quenches within the ordered phase, anomalous DQPTs can appear even without any OP zeros occurring over all investigated timescales [10,11,20]. As such, it has been argued that the periodic DQPT behavior seen for large quenches may be a mere manifestation of effective two-level system dynamics [21].\nHere, we address this argument by investigating DQPTs in models exhibiting \u201cstate transfer\u201d\u2014a dynamical process where the wave function evolves cyclically between the states of a given manifold\u2014due to quantum many-body scarring [22\u201324]. Such models possess a small number of anomalous eigenstates throughout their spectrum, leading to oscillatory\n2643-1564/2023/5(3)/033090(7) 033090-1 Published by the American Physical Society\ndynamics from a few specific states in an otherwise thermalizing system. We will focus on a formulation of the lattice Schwinger model [25] known as the spin-S U(1) quantum link model (QLM) [26,27]. This model has been shown to exhibit quantum many-body scarring for massless quenches starting in the maximal-flux (extreme) vacua for a wide range of spin values [28,29]. We show in these models that periodic DQPTs arise within complex many-body dynamics that is beyond two-level systems, and where a DQPT signals state transfer from one vacuum to another within a (2S+1)-fold degenerate vacuum manifold (see Fig. 1). We find no direct connection between DQPTs and OP zeros for integer S. For half-integer S, a DQPT is directly connected to an OP zero only when the DQPT signals a transfer between intermediate minimal-flux vacua of opposite flux sign. We further show that models where DQPT behavior resembles two-level system dynamics are a special case of our general picture."

            "text": "We now present time-evolution results obtained through the infinite matrix product state (iMPS) technique based on the time-dependent variational principle [36\u201339]. This technique works directly in the thermodynamic limit, and also allows us to directly detect DQPTs as level crossings between the logarithms of the eigenvalues of the MPS transfer matrix [10,40,41], without any need for finite-size scaling with L. DQPTs for gauge theories have already been studied in the context of the spin-1/2 U(1) QLM [13,42,43], and also for S 1/2 [44] as well as in the Schwinger model [14,45], but not in the context of quantum many-body scarring. For the most stringent calculations that we have performed in iMPS for this work, we find convergence for a maximal bond dimension of 550 and a time step of 0.0005/J .\nWe are interested in the dynamics of the experimentally relevant return rate (RR)\n\u03bb(t ) = min mz\n{ \u03bbmz (t ) } , (3a)\n\u03bbmz (t ) = \u2212 limL\u2192\u221e 1 L ln \u2223\u2223\u2329\u03c8mz0 \u2223\u2223\u03c8 (t )\u232a\u2223\u22232, (3b) which has recently been used to identify DQPTs in a trappedion experiment [46]. Here, {|\u03c8mz0 \u3009} is the set of vacua with mz\u2208{\u2212S, . . . , S}, which are the (2S+1)-fold degenerate ground states of Hamiltonian (1) for \u03ba/J = 0 and \u03bc/J\u2192\u221e. We call a vacuum extreme when |mz| = S, and intermediate when |mz|<S. We can represent a vacuum state on the two-site two-link unit cell as |\u03c8mz0 \u3009 = |\u22121, mz,\u22121,\u2212mz\u3009, indicating the eigenvalue \u22121 of \u03c3\u0302 zj at each (empty) matter site and the eigenvalue mz of s\u0302zj, j+1 on each link, but we will often refer to this vacuum simply by its value of mz. A detailed discussion of how to calculate the RR in iMPS can be found in Ref. [41].\nThe system is initialized in the extreme vacuum |\u03c8S0 \u3009 and subsequently quenched with the QLM Hamiltonian (1) with \u03bc/J = \u03ba/J = 0, yielding the time-evolved wave function |\u03c8 (t )\u3009 = e\u2212iH\u0302t |\u03c8S0 \u3009. Furthermore, we will also calculate\n033090-2\nin iMPS the quench dynamics of the electric flux and chiral condensate,\nE (t ) = lim L\u2192\u221e\n1\nL L\u2211 j=1 (\u22121) j+1\u3008\u03c8 (t )|s\u0302zj, j+1|\u03c8 (t )\u3009, (4a)\nn(t ) = 1 2 + lim L\u2192\u221e 1 2L L\u2211 j=1 \u3008\u03c8 (t )|\u03c3\u0302 zj |\u03c8 (t )\u3009. (4b)\nThe electric flux is an OP associated with the global Z2 symmetry of Hamiltonian (1) [47].\nWe first consider the case of S = 3/2. The corresponding RR (3a) and its components (3b) are shown in Fig. 2(a). Focusing on times t 12.07/J , we find three DQPTs equally separated in time. The DQPT signaling the state transfer between two vacua forms by the intersection of their corresponding RR components \u03bbmz (t ). The first DQPT indicates\nstate transfer between the extreme vacuum mz = 3/2 and the intermediate one mz = 1/2, while the second indicates state transfer between mz = 1/2 and mz = \u22121/2. We find that this second DQPT, which indicates a sign change in the dominantvacuum flux, occurs at roughly the same time as the first OP zero, marked with a red dot in Fig. 2(b). The two minima in the RR between these DQPTs indicate maximal overlap between the wave function and the intermediate vacua mz = \u00b11/2. The third DQPT signals the dominance of the second extreme vacuum mz = \u22123/2 in the wave-function overlap, and at t\u224812.07/J , we find a minimum in the RR that is very close to zero, indicating maximal overlap with this extreme vacuum. Henceforth, let us call local minima corresponding to extreme (intermediate) vacua as major (minor) local minima, abbreviated as MJM and MNM, respectively. Note how the MJM at t\u224812.07/J corresponds to the minimum of the OP, since the second extreme vacuum mz = \u22123/2 has the largest negative flux.\nFor t 12.07/J , the dynamics roughly reverses itself, with two MNM indicating maximal overlaps with the intermediate vacua, and a MJM indicating that the wave function is once again very close to the initial state mz = 3/2. The state transfer at late times is not as robust as at early times, and so\n033090-3\nthe DQPT signaling transfer between the vacua mz = \u22131/2 occurs at a slightly different time than the second OP zero: t\u224817.6/J and t\u224818.9/J . This is not surprising, as scarring is expected to deteriorate over time as ergodic dynamics begin to dominate. Indeed, we see a multitude of nonanalyticities in each component \u03bbmz (t ) after its first local minimum, which is indicative of complex quantum many-body dynamics. We expect that such nonanalytic behavior will dominate the RR itself at sufficiently long times, eventually destroying scarring and the periodicity of DQPTs.\nAn intriguing connection between the chiral condensate (4b), which is not an OP, and the RR (3a) can be seen in Fig. 2(c). Every MNM or MJM in the latter is reproduced in the former at the same evolution times, and the relative amplitudes of these local minima are qualitatively similar. In a way, the chiral condensate mirrors the analytic parts in the behavior of the RR, but it does not capture the signatures of DQPTs.\nTo investigate the effect of the parity of the degenerate manifold, we now repeat the same quench for the spin-1 U(1) QLM, starting in the extreme vacuum |\u22121, 1,\u22121,\u22121\u3009, i.e., mz = S = 1. As seen in the fidelity shown in Fig. 3(a), the phenomenology is the same in that the wave function evolves through large overlaps with the three vacua mz = 0,\u00b11, where\nthe overlap is largest with the extreme vacua mz = \u00b11. The relation of the RR to the electric flux and chiral condensate, shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), respectively, follows a similar vein as in the case of S = 3/2, except for a fundamental difference in the case of the OP. Whereas for S = 3/2 the DQPT signaling transfer between the vacua mz = \u00b11/2 coincides with an OP zero, for S = 1 no DQPT coincides with an OP zero [see Fig. 3(b)]. This is because, for S = 1, the point in time when the OP is zero coincides with the MNM due to maximal wave-function overlap with the middle vacuum mz = 0. This difference only depends on whether S is integer or half-integer, which determines the parity of the (2S+1)fold degenerate manifold."

When the manifold is even degenerate, the OP zero coincides with the DQPT signaling transfer between the two intermediate vacua with smallest OP absolute value 1/2. This is what we see in Fig. 2 for the spin-3/2 U(1) QLM, and is expected to apply for any half-integer S. When the manifold is odd degenerate, the OP zero does not coincide with a DQPT, but rather occurs halfway in time between two consecutive DQPTs signaling state transfer to and away from the middle vacuum of zero OP. This is what we see in Fig. 2 for the spin-1 U(1) QLM, and is expected to hold for any integer S.\nThe general picture we establish is valid in models with state-transfer scarring. A resemblance to two-level systems, where every DQPT is directly connected to an OP zero and vice versa, is a special case that becomes valid either (i) when the manifold is doubly degenerate, as can be seen in the case of S = 1/2 in Fig. 4 where each DQPT is directly connected to an OP zero at short to intermediate times before state transfer slightly deteriorates (see also Ref. [13] for small-mass quenches for S = 1/2), or (ii) when the quenches can be perturbatively connected to two-level dynamics, such\nas in large quenches of quantum Ising models [10,12,15,16]. Our general picture is also valid for other regularizations of the lattice Schwinger model, and does not apply when state transfer breaks down, e.g., when we quench an extreme vacuum but with a finite mass, or perform a massless quench on an intermediate vacuum (which does not lead to state-transfer dynamics; see Appendix).\nIt is also worth noting that our general picture, as well as its special case in previous literature, are only valid for a RR that includes projections on all the states of the initial manifold, as in Eqs. (3). This can be seen by considering, for example, only the component of the initial state itself as the total RR. In such case we find a plethora of aperiodic DQPTs without any direct connection to the OP [see panels (a) of Figs. 2\u20134]. However, we employ the RR defined in Eqs. (3) due to its experimental relevance [46] in addition to its traditional use in the field of DQPTs [12]."

            "text": "In this Appendix, we present results for quench protocols that do not lead to state-transfer scarring, leading to the inapplicability of the general picture drawn in the main text. First, we consider a quench of the extreme vacuum in the spin-3/2 U(1) QLM at mass \u03bc/J = 0.1. Figure 5(a) shows the return rate. At early times, it looks qualitatively similar to that of Fig. 2(a) for the massless quench, but at late times it is qualitatively different, and the periodicity of DQPTs is no longer there. In fact, starting around t\u224819/J , we see several DQPTs occurring in quick succession. In the general picture of the main text, the first OP zero should coincide with the first DQPT in the case of half-integer S, but in this case such a connection is not clearly present [see Fig. 5(b)]. The dynamics of the chiral condensate, shown in Fig. 5(c), exhibits a connection to the return rate similar to that in the case of the massless quench, where the minima of both quantities roughly coincide in time and relative amplitude.\nNext, we consider a massless quench from an intermediate vacuum, where the dynamics becomes significantly different from that of Fig. 2. Indeed, the return rate, shown in Fig. 6(a), exhibits many aperiodic DQPTs, where the OP in the same time window has a single zero that is hard to temporally connect to any of these DQPTs. Even the connection between the chiral condensate, shown in Fig. 6(c), and the return rate is no longer clear.\nA different way of regularizing lattice quantum electrodynamics is through the truncated Schwinger model (TSM), given by the Hamiltonian\nH\u0302TSM = L\u2211\nj=1\n[ J\n2 (\u03c3\u0302\u2212j \u03c4\u0302 + j, j+1\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 j+1 + H.c.)\n+ \u03bc\u03c3\u0302 zj + \u03ba2\n2\n( s\u0302zj, j+1 )2] , (A1)\nwhere the only difference with the U(1) QLM in Eq. (1) is that the gauge-field operator is given by \u03c4\u0302+j, j+1 whose elements are (\u03c4\u0302+j, j+1)m,n = \u03b4m,n\u22121, instead of s\u0302+j, j+1/ \u221a S(S+1). Note that the electric field is still represented by the Pauli operator s\u0302zj, j+1. Hamiltonian (A1) also hosts a U(1) gauge symmetry generated by G\u0302 j in Eq. (2), in addition to a global Z2 symmetry.\nThe TSM (A1) is equivalent to the QLM (1) for S 1, up to a trivial rescaling of the tunneling coefficient. As such, we repeat the quench of Fig. 2 for the TSM with S = 3/2, where now the time-evolved wave function in Eqs. (3) and (4) is |\u03c8 (t )\u3009 = e\u2212iH\u0302TSMt |\u03c8S0 \u3009. The corresponding quench dynamics is displayed in Fig. 7, where we see qualitatively identical behavior with the corresponding case of the U(1) QLM. The only difference is that the period is slightly different, TTSM\u224811.5 \u221a S(S+1) rather than T \u22485.13\u03c0S for the QLM, confirming results obtained in exact diagonalization for finite system sizes [48]. Again we see the direct one-to-one correspondence in the MNM and MJM of the RR, Fig. 7(a), and those of the chiral condensate, Fig. 7(c). The electric flux, on the other hand, only seems to connect with the MJM of the RR in terms of its minima, and equivalently, the chiral condensate, but does not show anything special at the evolution times where the MNM occur [see Fig. 7(b)]. As in the case of the QLM, we find that the OP zeros occur at or slightly after the times at which a DQPT arises signaling the shift in wave-function\u2013overlap dominance between the two intermediate vacua.\n[1] A.
