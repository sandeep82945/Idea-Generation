"Future studies should explore: (1) if and to what extent results derived using the PTT are subject to anchoring effects (2); whether this might be influenced by the importance of the risk at stake (e.g., whether this effect is more pronounced for relatively less important risk attributes); and (3) to what extent anchoring effects might be acceptable in cases where the risk levels included in the initial choice task are informed by clinical evidence for which there are different levels of certainty."
