    "abstractText": "Catalytic enantioselective introductionof a propargyl group constitutes oneof the most important carbon\u2013carbon forming reactions, as it is versatile to be transformed into diverse functional groups and frequently used in the synthesis of natural products and biologically active molecules. Stereoconvergent transformations of racemic propargyl precursors to a single enantiomer of products via propargyl radicals represent a powerful strategy and provide new reactivity. However, only few Cuor Ni-catalyzed protocols have been developed with limited reaction modes. Herein, a photoredox/cobalt-catalyzed regio-, diastereoand enantioselective propargyl addition to aldehydes via propargyl radicals is presented, enabling construction of a broad scope of homopropargyl alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access in high efficiency and stereoselectivity from racemic propargyl carbonates. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations provided evidence for the involvement of propargyl radicals, the origin of the stereoconvergent process and the stereochemical models.",

Stereoconvergent transformations of racemic propargyl precursors to a single enantiomer of products via propargyl radicals represent a powerful strategy and provide new reactivity. However, only few Cu- or Ni-catalyzed protocols have been developed with limited reaction modes. Herein, a photoredox/cobalt-catalyzed regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective propargyl addition to aldehydes via propargyl radicals is presented, enabling construction of a broad scope of homopropargyl alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access in high efficiency and stereoselectivity from racemic propargyl carbonates. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations provided evidence for the involvement of propargyl radicals, the origin of the stereoconvergent process and the stereochemical models.\nDevelopment of efficient and selective catalytic processes to access enantioenriched homopropargyl alcohols are highly desirable due to their frequent utility in the synthesis of natural products and biologically active molecules1. Pioneering investigations have led to the development of protocols for addition of stoichiometric amounts of enantiomerically enriched allenylmetal compounds (Sn-, Zn-, B-, Si-, or In-based) to aldehydes that provide access to homopropargyl alcohols with high diastereoselectivity1,2. Groundbreaking studies have identified chiral catalysts for additions of Sn-3\u20136, Zn-7, Si-8\u201311 or B-based12\u201316 allenyl or propargyl reagents to aldehydes (Fig. 1a). However, significant limitations remained unsolved. In the majority of the transformations above, only a simple propargyl group was incorporated; in few cases, an additional propargylic methyl-substituted stereogenic center was generated17. Pre-formation of stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents was required. Cr-Catalyzed enantioselective propargylation of aldehydes18\u201320 and ketones21 has been revealed and only a simple propargyl group was able to be introduced. Stoichiometric amounts of reactants and reagents for cleavage of the Cr\u2013O bond to enhance catalyst turnover were required. A more compelling strategy entails in situ generation of allenyl\u2013metal intermediates through enantioselective metal\u2013hydride22\u201326 or metal\u2013B(pin)27 addition to 1,3-enynes followedbydiastereoselective addition to aldehydes (Fig. 1b). Although the initial preparation of an organometallic reagent was obviated, the diversity of propargyl groups and the variety of\nReceived: 17 January 2023\nAccepted: 26 July 2023\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory of Organometallic Chemistry, Center for Excellence in Molecular Synthesis, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 345 Lingling Road, 200032 Shanghai, China. 2CCNU-uOttawa Joint Research Center, Key Laboratory of Pesticide & Chemical Biology,Ministry of Education, Collegeof Chemistry,Central ChinaNormal University, 152 LouyuRoad,Wuhan430079Hubei,China. 3StateKey Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin, China. 4School of Chemistry and Materials Science, Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1 Sub-lane Xiangshan, 310024 Hangzhou, China. e-mail: chongql@sioc.ac.cn; zhihanzhang@ccnu.edu.cn; mengf@sioc.ac.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nsecond propargylic stereogenic centers were limited. For instance, approaches for introduction of a propargyl group bearing an aryl group at the propargylic stereogenic center remained unknown. Despite a fewmore reports on catalytic enantioselective generation of allenyl\u2013Cu species28\u201335, subsequent addition to aldehyde remained rare27.\nAnother catalytic enantioselective strategy for generation of chiral allenyl\u2013metal intermediates is oxidative insertion to racemic propargyl precursors. Although recent breakthroughs on catalytic transformations of racemic propargyl precursors to enantioenriched propargyl or allenyl products have been disclosed, only Ni- 36\u201342 and Pd-based43\u201347 catalysts have been applied to such reactions (Fig. 1c). In most cases, a nucleophile reacted with the allenyl\u2013metal intermediate. Transformations of the allenyl\u2013metal specieswith aldehydes remained undeveloped. Moreover, few examples of enantioselective propargylation through propargyl C\u2013H functionalization have been developed48,49. However, the detection of propargyl radicals was reported in none of the protocols. Tuning the reactivity of propargyl radicals by a metal-based catalyst to enable enantioselective construction of a propargylic stereogenic center has been attracting increasing attentions (Fig. 1d)50. Liu et al. reported an enantioselective propargyl C\u2013H cyanation via propargyl radicals promoted by a Cu complex51. Subsequently, enantioselective cyanation of propargyl esters induced by dual photoredox and Cu catalysis was developed52. Fu et al. revealed Ni-catalyzed enantioselective coupling of racemic propargyl bromides with aryl or alkyl\u2013Zn reagents via propargyl radicals53,54. During the submission of this manuscript, Cr-catalyzed enantioselective propargylation of ketones involving propargyl radicals have been revealed55. The same group also reported Cr-catalyzed enantioselective allenylation of aldehydes with propargyl halides via\na\nM or M chiral catalyst\nO\nHR\nR\nOH\n(M = Cr, Zn, B, Sn, Si)\nb\nR1\nM\u2013Nu\n(M = Ir, Ru, Cu; Nu = H, B(pin))\nR1\nM\nNu O\nHR2 R2\nR1OH\nNu c\naldehydes via propargyl radicals (this work).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 2\npropargyl radicals56. Significant limitations remained unaddressed in this area. Only Cu- and Ni-based catalysts have been disclosed; the reaction modes were restricted to cyanation and Negishi coupling; transformations with aldehydes via propargyl radicals remained unknown.\nCobalt is an inexpensive earth-abundant transition metal of low toxicity57\u201359. Our group has been focusing on developing cobaltcatalyzed enantioselective transformations60\u201366. Recently, we have disclosed a cobalt-catalyzed protocol for diastereo- and enantioselective reductive allyl additions to aldehydes via allyl radicals generated from allylic alcohol derivatives63. Such stereoconvergent process entailed oxidative addition of Co(I) complex to allylic alcohol derivatives to form allyl\u2013Co(III) intermediates, which underwent homocleavage to afford allyl radicals followed by capture with the Co(II) species. Racemic starting materials could be converted to a single enantiomer of the homoallyl alcohol products.We imagined to expand such concept to stereoconvergent propargyl addition to aldehydes with racemic propargyl carbonates via propargyl radicals. Compared with allyl addition, it is farmore challenging for the propargyl addition. In contrast to the allyl addition that proceeded through a well-defined six-membered transition state, propargyl addition to aldehydes via allenyl\u2013metal species through a distorted cyclic transition state rendered more difficulties to control the regio-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity1. The catalyst has to effectively tune the reactivity of the allenyl\u2013Co and the isomeric propargyl\u2013Co intermediate, enabling one of them to react selectively. In addition, to furnish the homopropargyl alcohols in high diastereo- and enantioselectivity, the axial stereogenicity of the allenyl\u2013Co or the selectivity for the stereogenic propargyl\u2013Co intermediate has to be accurately controlled. The same catalyst has to induce high selectivity for the aldehyde addition. When we applied the reaction conditions for our previous allyl addition to aldehydes63 to transformation of propargyl carbonate 1a with benzaldehyde 2a, we found that unlike the allyl addition process, no enantioselective induction was observed for all chiral ligands, and even without a ligand, a mixture of diastereomers of homopropargyl alcohols were obtained (Fig. 2). The loss of enantioselectivity might result from the presence of Mn salt generated from reduction of the Co(II) salt. TheMn salt might be able to activate aldehyde, causing it to react without the need of a ligand. The coordination ofMn saltmight lead to the distorted cyclic transition state unfavored, and the reaction might proceed through an opened transition state instead. To circumvent this issue, we thought that organophotoredox catalysis might serve as an appropriate alternative for single electron transfer processes to avoid the presence of additional Lewis acidic metal salts. Enantioselective reactions promoted by photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis have emerged as a powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral compounds67\u201371. However, there is a lack of approaches for cobaltcatalyzed enantioselective transformations via propargyl radicals. Herein, we reported a protocol for regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective propargyl addition to aldehydes with racemic propargyl carbonates via propargyl radicals (Fig. 1e). A broad scope of homopropargyl alcohols with single or a second stereogenic center that are otherwise difficult to access were afforded in high efficiency and stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations\ndisclosed the origin of the stereoconvergent process and the stereochemical models."

            "text": "Our studies commenced with reaction of propargyl carbonate 1a with benzaldehyde 2a in the presence of Co complexes derived from various chiral phosphine ligands (Table 1). Unlike our previous protocol for allyl addition63, the propargyl addition to aldehyde could not be promoted by the Co complex derived from phosphinooxazoline 5a (entry 1). As expected, it is promising that Co complexes formed from chiral phosphines 5b\u2013d were able to induce low enantioselectivity (entries 2\u20134). Using a photoredox catalyst for single-electron transfer got rid of the formation of the additional metal salt, shutting down the possible background reactions. Further investigations indicated that transformation in the presence of electron-rich phosphines provided higher enantioselectivity (entries 6\u201310). Although reaction promoted byCo complex generated from 5fdelivered homopropargyl alcohol 3a in 11% yield with 52:48 dr and 63:37 er (entry 6), it was found that ligands containing a benzene backbone and chiral phospholane fragments (5h\u2013i) produced not only higher efficiency but also diastereoand enantioselectivity (entries 8\u20139).Optimization on solvents revealed that reaction could not proceed in CH2Cl2 (entry 11). Lower efficiency was obtained in high polar solvents (entries 12\u201313). Conducting the reaction in MeCN produced >95:5 dr and 94:6 er with a slight diminishment of yield (entry 14). Reaction in alcoholic solvent afforded racemic product in low efficiency (entry 15). Transformation performed in non-polar solvent provided high stereoselectivity with slight erosion of yield (entry 16). Lowering the Co catalyst loading to 5.0mol % and loading of the photoredox catalyst to 1.0mol % resulted in no diminishment of efficiency and stereoselectivity (entry 17). It is worth mentioning that diastereoselectivity was dramatically influenced by the chiral catalyst, suggesting although the propargyl addition to aldehyde proceeded through a six-membered cyclic transition state, unlike allyl addition, the diastereoselectivity was controlled by the catalyst rather than the substrate.\nWith the optimal conditions in hand, we next investigated the substrate scope for aldehydes (Fig. 3). Aldehydes containing electrondeficient (3b\u2013f), electron-rich (3g\u2013h, 3l\u2013m), halogenated (3i\u2013k), and sterically demanding (3o\u2013q) aryl groups are suitable substrates. Boryl group (3n) is well tolerated in the reaction. A wide range of heteroaryl aldehydes (3r\u2013x) could be converted to the desired homopropargyl alcohols in 68\u201390% yield with 94:6\u201398:2 er as a single diastereomer. Reactions of aliphatic aldehydes bearing primary (3y, 3aa) and secondary (3z, 3ab) alkyls afforded the homopropargyl alcohols in 43\u201382% yield with 92.5:7.5\u201395.5:4.5 er as a single diastereomer. There was a match/mismatch effect in the transformations of enantiomerically pure aldehydes. Reaction of aldehyde derived from (S)-lactic acid promoted by Co complex derived from (R,R)\u22125h provided 3ac in 82:18 dr, whereas a single diastereomer 3ad was obtained with (S,S)-5h. Highly functionalized homopropargyl alcohols (3ae\u2013af) containing multiple stereogenic centerswere accessed as a single diastereomerby proper choice of the enantiomer of the ligand. \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated aldehydes cannot participate in the reaction. Only reduction of \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated aldehydes occurred.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 3\nTa b le\n1 |O\np ti m iz at io n o f re ac\nti o n co\nn d it io n s\nM e 3\nS i\nP h\nO B\noc\nP h\nH\nO\n+\n1a (1 .5 e\nqu iv\n) 2a\n10 m\nol %\nC oC l 2 10 m ol % li ga nd\n2. 0\nm ol\n% 4\nC zl\nP N\n20 m\nol %\niP\nr 2 N\nE t\n1. 5\neq ui\nv H\nan tz\nsc h\u2019\ns es\nte r\nso lv\nen t,\nbl ue\nL E\nD s\n22 o\nC , 1\n4 h\nP h\nO H\nP h\nS iM\ne 3\n3a\nEn tr y\nLi g an\nd S o lv en\nt Y ie ld\n(% )a\nd rb\ner c\n1 5 a\nTH F\n<5 N A\nd N A\nd\n2 5 b\nTH F\n26 56\n:4 4\n4 5: 55\n3 5 c\nTH F\n14 6 4 :3 6\n4 0 :6 0\n4 5 d\nTH F\n11 58\n:4 2\n4 7: 53\n5 5 e\nTH F\n<5 N A\nd N A\nd\n6 5 f\nTH F\n11 52\n:4 8\n6 3: 37\n7 5 g\nTH F\n32 8 3: 17\n3 3: 6 7\n8 5 h\nTH F\n9 2\n>9 5: 5\n9 7: 3\n9 5 i\nTH F\n4 4\n>9 5: 5\n9 6 :4\n10 5 j\nTH F\n17 8 7: 13\n13 :8 7\n11 5 h\nC H 2 C l 2\n<5 N A\nd N A\nd\n12 5 h\nD M S O\n37 >9\n5: 5\n6 2: 38\n13 5 h\nD M F\n58 >9\n5: 5\n9 4 :6\n14 5 h\nM eC\nN 70\n>9 5: 5\n9 4 :6\n15 5 h\nM eO\nH 21\n>9 5: 5\n50 :5 0\n16 5 h\nto lu en\ne 75\n>9 5: 5\n9 6 :4\n17 e\n5 h\nTH F\n9 2\n>9 5: 5\n9 7: 3\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 4\nTa b le\n1 (c o n ti n ue\nd ) |O\np ti m iz at io n o f re ac\nti o n co\nn d it io n s\nM e 3\nS i\nP h\nO B\noc\nP h\nH\nO\n+\n1a (1 .5 e\nqu iv\n) 2a\n10 m\nol %\nC oC l 2 10 m ol % li ga nd\n2. 0\nm ol\n% 4\nC zl\nP N\n20 m\nol %\niP\nr 2 N\nE t\n1. 5\neq ui\nv H\nan tz\nsc h\u2019\ns es\nte r\nso lv\nen t,\nbl ue\nL E\nD s\n22 o\nC , 1\n4 h\nP h\nO H\nP h\nS iM\ne 3\n3a\nEn tr y\nLi g an\nd S o lv en\nt Y ie ld\n(% )a\nd rb\ner c\nP P\nh 2N O t-\nB u\nP P\nh 2\nP P\nh 2\nP h 2\nP P\nC y 2\nM e\nF e\nP h 2\nP P\nP h 2\nM e\nM e\nP h 2\nP P\nP h 2\nM e\nM e\nP P\nP h\nP h\nP h\nP h\nP P\ntB\nu M\ne\nM e\ntB\nu\nP P\nM e\nM e M e\nM e\nP P\nE t\nE t E t\nE t\nP P\ni-P r\ni-P r i-P r\ni-P r\nb5 a5\nd5 c5\n5e j5 i5\nh5 g5\nf5\nR ea\nct io ns\nw er e co\nnd uc\nte d in\nth e p re se\nnc e of\nC oC\nl 2 (1 0 m ol\n% ), 5h\n(1 0 m ol\n% ), 4 C zl PN\n(2 .0\nm ol\n% ), i-P\nr 2 N Et\n(2 0 m ol\n% ), 1a\n(1 .5\neq ui v) ,2\na (1 .0\neq ui v)\nan d 1. 5 eq\nui v H an\ntz sc\nh\u2019 s es\nte r (1 .5\neq ui v)\nat 22\n\u00b0C fo r 14 h. a Y ie ld of a m ix tu re of d ia st er eo m er s is ol at ed . b D et er m in ed b y an al ys is of 1H N M R sp ec tr a of un p ur ifi ed m ix tu re s. c D et er m in ed b y an al ys is of H PL C sp ec tr a. d N ot av ai la b le . e T he re ac tio n w as p er fo rm ed in th e p re se nc e of 5. 0 m ol % 5 h ,5 .0 m ol % C oC l 2 an d 1. 0 m ol % 4 C zI PN .4 C zl PN = 1, 2, 3, 5- te tr ak is (c ar b az ol e9 -y l)\u2212 4 ,6 -d ic ya no b en ze ne ,H an tz sc h\u2019 s es te r= d ie th yl 1, 4 -d ih yd\nro -2 ,6 -d im\net hy\nl3, 5- p yr id in ed\nic ar b ox\nyl at e.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 5\nHantzsch\u2019s ester = diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 6\nSubstrate scope extends to propargyl carbonates aswell (Fig. 4). A broad scope of racemic propargyl carbonates bearing electrondeficient (6a\u2013c, 6 h), electron-rich (6d, 6i), halogenated (6e\u2013g), and sterically congested (6j\u2013l) aryl groups canparticipate in the reaction. A variety of heteroaryl-containing homopropargyl alcohols (6m\u2013r) were constructed in 53\u201380%yieldwith 95:5\u201398:2 er as a single diastereomer. Modification of the trimethylsilyl to tert-butyldimethylsilyl group led to an improvement of enantioselectivity (6s). Propargyl carbonates that contain an alkyl-substituted alkyne (6t\u2013w) are well tolerated albeit with lower enantioselectivity. Alkyl-substituted propargyl carbonate was able to be converted to the desired homopropargyl alcohol 6x with 67:33 dr and 95.5:4.5 er. 35% yield of puremajor diastereomer was isolated. Homopropargyl alcohols (6y\u2013z, 6aa\u2013ab) bearing a quaternary center can be furnished in 48\u201391% yield with 88:12\u201395:5 er. Reaction of primary propargyl carbonate substitutedwith a silyl group afforded a 69:31 mixture of propargyl and allenyl addition products with 96:4 er for the propargyl addition product (58% yield of pure propargyl addition product 6ac was isolated) and >99.5:0.5 er for the allenyl addition product, whereas exclusive propargyl addition products generated from primary propargyl carbonates containing phenyl groups were obtained in 41\u201351% yield with 87:13\u201394:6 er (6ad\u2013aj). Such results suggested that with a larger substituent at the alkyne raised the energy of the allenyl\u2013Co intermediate and lowered the energy of the propargyl\u2013Co intermediate, resulting in a competitive allenyl addition. Propargyl carbonates bearing terminal alkynes and 1,3-enynes were unreactive.\nIt should be noted that the reaction can be performed on gram scale in a single pot without the need of a continuous flow equipment, affording the enantioenriched homopropargyl alcohol 3a in 92% yield with 97:3 er as a single diastereomer (Fig. 5a). The homopropargyl alcohol bearing two stereogenic centers can be functionalized to a variety of chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access (Fig. 5b). Semi-reduction of the internal alkyne led to exclusive formation of (Z)-homoallyl alcohol 7 in 74% yield without erosion of stereoselectivity72. Desilylation of 3a with K2CO3 in MeOH furnished terminal alkyne 8 in 96% yield. Sonogashira coupling of 8 in the presence of 4.0mol % PdCl2(PPh3)2 and 8.0mol % CuI afforded 9 in 92% yield with 98:2 er as a single diastereomer, enabling introduction of highly diversified substituents at the alkyne. Click reaction promoted by CuI provided 1,2,3-triazole 10 in 96% yield73. Pd-catalyzed conversion of the terminal alkyne in 8 to indole delivered 11 in 92% yield with 97:3 er as a single diastereomer74. Transformation of the terminal alkyne moiety in 8 through Cu-catalyzed multicomponent hydrative amidation led to simultaneous cyclization to form \u03b3-lactone 12 in 73% yield75.\nTo gain some mechanistic insights, a series of experiments were conducted (Fig. 6). Treatment of propargyl carbonate 1a with a mixture of 2b and 2b-D resulted in a significant inverse secondary isotopic effect (KIE = 0.82), implying thatpartial rehybridizationof the carbonyl carbon from sp2 to sp3 and addition of the allenyl\u2013Co species to the aldehyde might be the rate-determining step (Fig. 6a). Monitoring the alteration of enantiomeric ratio of racemic propargyl carbonate 1a recovered from the reaction indicated that both enantiomers of the propargyl carbonate were able to undergo oxidative addition to generate propargyl\u2013Co/allenyl\u2013Co species with a subtle rate difference (Fig. 6b). There is a match/mismatch effect between the chiral catalyst and the stereogenic center of the propargyl carbonate. 80% of the excess amount of the propargyl carbonate 1a was converted to allene 13 with 57:43 er (Fig. 6c), suggesting that both diastereomers of the allenyl\u2013Co species were generated. As only one diastereomer of the product was obtained, dynamic kinetic transformation of the two diastereomers of the allenyl\u2013Co intermediates occurred. Reaction of enantioenriched 1a (80:20 er) in the presence of (R,R)-5h or (S,S)-5h delivered 3a and ent-3a respectively, indicating that the stereochemistry of the product was solely controlled by the chiral catalyst\n(Fig. 6d\u2013e). Measuring the enantiomeric ratio of the recovered 1a supported that (R)-enantiomer of 1a reacted faster in the reaction promoted by (S,S)-5h. Transformation of 1a with 2a in the presence of deuterated Hantzsch\u2019s ester afforded deuterated allene 13-D, implying that Hantzsch\u2019s ester supplied proton for the reaction (Fig. 6f). Control experiments indicated that Hantzsch\u2019s ester quenched the excited photocatalyst and served as the reductant (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Information). However, in the absence of i-Pr2NEt, no reaction occurred, suggesting that the oxidized form of Hantzsch\u2019s ester cannot proton the O\u2013Co bond directly. i-Pr2NEt assisted the proton transfer from the reduced form of Hantzsch\u2019s ester to protonate the O\u2013Co bond and released the product and stoichiometric amount of i-Pr2NEt was not required. Trapping the propargyl radical with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and taking the EPR spectra for the adduct, we detected the presence of a propargyl radical (Fig. 6g, see Supplementary Information for more details). In addition, the adduct was detected in HRMS as well.\nCombining all the above mechanistic experiments, we further carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the detailed reaction mechanism and probe the origin of stereoselectivity (Fig. 7). The calculated free energy profile is shown in Fig. 7a. The radical recombination between the Co(II) complex 4INT1 and propargyl radical to afford a triplet allenyl-Co(III) complex 3INT2 is slightly exothermic by 0.3 kcal/mol, and the corresponding energy barrier for this radical coupling via 3TS1 was calculated to be only 1.7 kcal/mol. In 3TS1, the computed spin densities of Co and C atoms are2.597 and\u22120.395 respectively, indicating a radical couplingprocess between quartet Co(II) and propargyl radical. The formation of the singlet allenyl-Co(III) complex is highly endothermic by more than 18 kcal/mol, ruling out the possibility of radical coupling between doublet Co(II) complex and propargyl radical. Further single-electron reduction of allenyl-Co(III) to allenyl-Co(II) by 4CzIPN\u2022\u2013 is exothermic by 2.8 kcal/mol. The eventual asymmetric nucleophilic addition of allenyl-Co(II) 2INT3 on aldehyde 2a requires an activation barrier of 15.0 kcal/mol inwhich 2TS2 lies higher than the previous allenyl radical capture transition state, establishing itself as the stereo-determining step. This is consistent with the experimental observations that the radical recombination is reversible where both diastereomers of allenyl-Co species were generated. In the meanwhile, the transition state (TS) of nucleophilic addition also witness a partial rehybridization of carbonyl carbon from sp2 to sp3, endorsed by the inverse secondary KIE (0.82). To delve into the origin of stereoselectivity, we analyzed the steric environment of the ligand and carefully compared the geometries of nucleophilic addition TSs with different configurations. The topographic steric map73 shows that the methyl group pointing outward renders quadrant 2 (Q2) more congested, while the less bulky Q3 with the methyl group pointing inside could accommodate more sterically demanding functional group (Fig. 7b). Given that the formation of allenyl-Co(II) 2INT3 is reversible, the stereoselectivity is sorely determined by the interaction between the aldehyde and the chiral allenyl-Co(II) complex. We examined all plausible TSs where four plausible isomers of 2INT3 attack on either Re or Si face of aldehyde (see Supplementary Fig. 8), and Fig. 1c depicts the optimized structures of themost favorable transition states delivering four possible diastereomers respectively. DFT calculations showed that 2TS2top-RR, the TS leading to the experimentally observed product 3a, is the most favored one among the four different configurations. In 2TS2top-RR, the trimethylsilyl (TMS) and thephenyl (Ph) of allenyl group locate on less bulky Q3 and Q1 respectively, matching well with the chiral environment of the ligand. On the other hand, in 2TS2btm-SS, 2TSbtm-RS, and 2TStop-SR, either the TMS group or the Ph group encounter large steric repulsion with the methyl of ligand in the crowded Q2. These repulsions cause larger dihedral angles Co-C-C-Si in the three disfavored TSs 2TS2btm-SS, 2TSbtm-RS, and 2TStop-SR and thus weaker coordination of allenyl groups. The additional distortion/\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 7\nFig. 4 | Scope of propargyl carbonates.

The TSs in quartet state were calculated to be close in energy with doublet TSs, and both spin states are close in energy and share similar stability trend in terms of different configurations (see Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 6). The TSs in doublet were discussed since the origin of stereoselectivity is of primary interests. In summary, the generation of nucleophile is reversible, and the chiral environment of ligand confines the allenyl-Co(II) complex to selectively undergo nucleophilic addition with aldehyde in RR configuration, which assures high enantio- and diastereoselectivity.\nBased on all the observations above and literature precedence, we proposed a possible catalytic cycle (Fig. 8). Visible light irradiation excited 4CzIPN, which underwent single electron reduction by HE to generate 4CzIPN\u2022\u2013. The 4CzIPN\u2022 \u2013was able to reduce the Co(II) complex I to Co(I) species II. Oxidative addition of Co(I) complex II to propargyl carbonate 1a through two-electron process formed propargyl\u2013Co(III) intermediate III that could undergo homocleavage to generate propargyl radical IV andCo(II) species I. Or propargyl radical IV associated with Co(II) species I was afforded directly through one-electron process. The re-combination of propargyl radical IV and Co(II) complex I followed by facile single-electron reduction provided two diastereomers of allenyl\u2013Co(II) species (VII and VIII). There are four possible modes for subsequent aldehyde addition (IX\u2013XII). The chiral catalyst could accurately control one diastereomer (IX) of the allenyl\u2013Co intermediates to react with the aldehyde, delivering high diastereoand enantioselectivity for the homopropargyl alcohol product. Such dynamic kinetic transformation of the allenyl\u2013Co species resulted in\nthe stereoconvergent process. Proton transfer released the product and regenerated the catalyst.\nIn conclusion, a photoassisted cobalt-catalyzed protocol for regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective propargylation of aldehydes to furnish a wide range of homopropargyl alcohols in high efficiency, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity has been developed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that stereoconvergent transformations of racemic propargyl carbonates with aldehydes via propargyl radicals have been achieved. The starting materials are readily accessible or prepared easily. The broad scope of homopropargyl alcohols without the requirement for pre-formation of organometallic reagents enabled the enantioselective incorporation of propargyl groups without substitution at propargyl position and propargyl groups with a tertiary stereogenic center or a quaternary center. The catalyst is derived from an inexpensive sustainable cobalt salt and a commercially available bisphosphine. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by diverse functionalization of the homopropargyl alcohol, affording a series of useful enantioenriched building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. Mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism, revealing that addition of allenyl\u2013Co species to aldehyde might be the rate-determining step, and dynamic kinetic transformation of the two diastereomers of allenyl\u2013Co intermediate was responsible for the high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. DFT calculations supported the mechanism involving radical recombination, single electron reduction, and rate-determining nucleophilic addition, and the origin of stereoselectivity was uncovered. Such discoveries unveiled a novel reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a unique stereoconvergent process for dynamic kinetic transformation of two diastereomeric allenyl\u2013Co species, opening up new\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 9\nmediates. 4CzlPN = 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazole-9-yl)\u22124,6-dicyanobenzene, Hantzsch\u2019s ester = diethyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 10\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:4825 11\nopportunities for designing new reactions promoted by chiral Cobased catalysts and pushing forward the development of organocobalt chemistry.
