    "abstractText": "In this study we demonstrate a high-performance polarization rotator (PR) based on flatshaped photonic crystal fiber. The flat surfaces of the fiber are plated on gold films as electrodes, and the core of the structure is filled with liquid crystal. The polarization rotation characteristics of the flat-shaped fiber can be effectively adjusted by applying external voltage. The optical properties are analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). The results show that the magnitude of the modulation voltage is closely related to the thickness of the flat fiber. When the fiber thickness is 20 \u03bcm, only 100 V is required to achieve the highest PR performance. In the wavelength of the 1.55 \u03bcm band (~200 nm bandwidth), the conversion length of the PR is only 3.99 \u03bcm, the conversion efficiency is close to 100%, and the minimum crosstalk value is \u221226.2 dB. The presented PR, with its excellent performance, might enable promising applications in the communication system and the photonic integrated circuits.",

            "text": "With the development of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in recent years, polarization rotators (PRs) that can eliminate the polarization dependence of PICs have also become a research hotspot [1\u20133]. At the same time, the compactness and stability of the PICs determine that the PR also needs to have these characteristics [4]. Therefore, research on high-performance, highly compact PRs is necessary. Normally, there are two schemes for designing a PR, i.e., active and passive PRs devices. The passive scheme controls the mode evolution by changing the geometry of the waveguide [5\u20138], but this method has the issues of unidirectional conversion and large volume. The active scheme uses mode coupling [9\u201314]. The main design idea is to change the birefringence of the waveguide so that the input light can excite two mutually orthogonal polarization modes on the transmission section. PRs can be achieved due to the different propagation constants of the two polarization modes. Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is widely favored by scholars due to the design freedom of the arrangement of the air holes and their stability. It is a simple solution to break the symmetry of the PCF by changing the distribution of the air holes in the PCF in order to achieve high birefringence [13,15,16]. However, it is not enough to rely on the birefringence produced by changing the distribution or shape of the stomata, because the conversion length of this method is generally too long. Thus, researchers thought of filling high birefringence materials into photonic bandgap PCFs. In 2011, M. F. O. Hameed et al. designed and verified that a polarization rotator can be realized by filling liquid crystal into\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7526. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15217526 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7526 2 of 10\na soft glass PCF [11]. In 2013, their team designed an ultra-short PR that filled the liquid crystal into the commonly used hexagonal PCF [17]. This PR achieves an ultra-compact device length of 4.085 \u00b5m and a polarization conversion rate of almost 100%. In 2017, Lin Yu et al. [18] designed an ultra-short polarization rotator assisted by liquid crystal based on spiral PCF in order to achieve a conversion length of 4.17 \u00b5m and crosstalk of \u221220.93 dB. Although filling the liquid crystal into the PCF greatly reduces the conversion length and improves the conversion efficiency, regrettably, the size of the fiber in these research and design schemes is very small, which causes difficulties in actual manufacturing. Moreover, in different usage scenarios, we expect our design to be able to change the performances through external excitation without changing the structure. In 2011, Alexandros K. Pitilakis et al. proposed the use of soft glass as a substrate and air-hole filled liquid crystals for polarization converter design [19].

Variations of CT with the potential difference.\nThe molecular density of the liquid crystal is different at different temperatures so that it will affect the refractive index of the liquid crystal. Figure 7a is a graph of the conversion length and modal hybridness at different temperatures. It can be seen that as the temperature rises, the modal hybridness and conversion length both rise. This is due to the fact that the extraordinary refractive index ne of the liquid crystal decreases from 1.7096 to 1.6438 as the temperature rises from 15\u201350 \u00b0C in the 1.55 \u03bcm band; its ordinary refractive index decreases from 1.5034 to 1.5017 from 15\u201335 \u00b0C, and its no increases from 1.5017 to 1.5089 as the temperature rises from 35\u201350 \u00b0C. From the law of change of liquid crystal birefringence, we can see that the birefringence effect becomes smaller as the temperature rises, and the conversion length of PR is inversely related to birefringence, so it makes the conversion length gradually become larger as the temperature rises [26]. Although the mixing degree of the rotator will increase with the increase of temperature, it can be seen from Figure 7b that when the fiber length is 3.99 \u03bcm instead of L\u03c0, the crosstalk value and conversion ratio are the same as L\u03c0 at 25 \u00b0C. As the temperature rises, the crosstalk value gradually rises, and the conversion ratio gradually decreases. However, in the manufacturing process, due to the existence of errors, it is impossible to make the fiber length L\u03c0 very accurately. It can be seen that the fiber designed in this paper can tolerate an error of \u00b15 \u00b0C at 3.99 \u03bcm. Next, the influence of fiber parameters on conversion ratio, conversion length, and crosstalk is studied, as show in Figure 8. First, the influence of the core size on the conversion length and modal hybridness is studied. At this time, the temperature is maintained at 25 \u00b0C, the voltage across the liquid crystal is 20 V, the distance between the pores around the core and the core is 0.2 \u03bcm, and the pore radius is 2 \u03bcm. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the conversion length and the modal hybridness and the size of the core. As the core size increases, the modal hybridness remains basically unchanged. When the core\nFigure 6. Variations of CT ith the potential difference.\nill a fect the refractive index of the liquid crystal.

This is\nfact that he xtraordinary ref active index ne of the liquid crystal decreas s from 1.7096 to 1.6438 as the temperature rises from 15\u201350 \u25e6C in the 1.55 \u00b5m band; its ordinary refractive index decreas s from 1.5034 to 1.5017 fr m 15\u201335 \u25e6C, and its no i creases from 1.5017 to 1.5089 as the temperature rises from 35\u201350 \u25e6C. From the law of change of liquid crystal birefringence, we can see that the birefringence effect becomes smaller as the temperature rises, and the conversion length of PR is inversely related to birefringence, so it makes the conversion length gradually become larger as the temperature rises [26]. Although the mixing degree of the rotator will increase with the increase of temperature, it can be seen from Figure 7b that when the fiber length is 3.99 \u00b5m instead of L\u03c0, the crosstalk value and conversion ratio are the same as L\u03c0 at 25 \u25e6C. As the temperature rises, the crosstalk value gradually rises, and the conversion ratio gradually decreases. However, in the manufacturing process, due to the existence of errors, it is impossible to make the fiber length L\u03c0 very accurately. It can be seen that the fiber designed in this paper can tolerate an error of \u00b15 \u25e6C at 3.99 \u00b5m. Next, the influence of fiber parameters on conversion ratio, conversion length, and crosstalk is studied, as show in Figure 8. First, the influence of the core size on the conversion length and modal hybridness is studied. At this time, the temperature is maintained at 25 \u25e6C, the voltage across the liquid crystal is 20 V, the distance between the pores around the core and the core is 0.2 \u00b5m, and the pore radius is 2 \u00b5m. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the conversion length and the modal hybridness and the size of the core. As the core size increases, the modal hybridness remains basically unchanged. When the core radius exceeds 4 \u00b5m, it decreases slightly. This is because, when the core size is too large, a small part of the fundamental mode will be converted to higher-order modes. The conversion length gradually decreases from 4.04 \u00b5m to 3.98 \u00b5m, because, as the core size increases, the birefringence between the two modes will increase.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7526 7 of 10\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 10\nradius exceeds 4 \u03bcm, it decreases slightly. This is because, when the core size is too large, a small part of the fundamental mode will be converted to higher-order modes. The conversion length gradually decreases from 4.04 \u03bcm to 3.98 \u03bcm, because, as the core size increases, the birefringence between the two modes will increase.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 7.

Dependences of the modal hybridness and conversion length for different values of the central hole radius r.\nThe duty cycle of the air holes around the core also affects the birefringence of the core. Considering that the size of the pores around the core and the distance between the pores and the core will affect the duty cycle, we keep the temperature at 25 \u00b0C and the core radius at 4 \u03bcm, the effects of pore spacing and pore size on conversion length, conversion ratio, and crosstalk were studied, respectively. Figure 9a shows the effect of the size of the air hole on the conversion length and conversion ratio when keeping the distance between the air pores and the core (D0) at 0.2 \u03bcm. When the air hole radius increases from 1 \u03bcm to 1.3 \u03bcm, the conversion length remains unchanged at 3.9948 \u03bcm. When the air holes radius continues to increase, the conversion length will rapidly drop to 3.9928 \u03bcm. Although the conversion length has changed, the change is not obvious, but as the air hole radius increases, the conversion efficiency gradually increases from 0.993 to close to 1. Figure 9b shows that the fixed air hole size is 2 \u03bcm; when the air hole and the fiber core are at different intervals, the graph of crosstalk and conversion rate when the fiber length is L\u03c0 and 3.99 \u03bcm.

The proposed structure is made of flat-shaped PCF filled with liquid crystal in the core. We investigated the influence of structural parameters on the polarization conversion performance. The fiber thickness can effectively reduce the modulation of flat-\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7526 9 of 10\nshaped PCF voltage of PR; the maximum conversion ratio can be achieved at a voltage of just 100 V. Its conversion length is just 3.99 \u00b5m, and the working crosstalk is as low as \u221226.2 dB. Under the optimal parameters, the PR can offer an almost 100% polarizationconversion ratio with a wavelength of 1.55 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m and a temperature tolerance of 5 \u25e6C. The basic size of the fiber is close to the commercial size, and this opens up the possibility of manufacturing. The proposed PR has great application potential in actual manufacturing and modern communication systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, Z.L., D.Y., Z.Y., Y.L. and X.Z.; Methodology, T.W.; Project administration, T.W.; Resources, Y.W. and W.C.; Software, R.L.; Writing\u2014original draft, R.L.
