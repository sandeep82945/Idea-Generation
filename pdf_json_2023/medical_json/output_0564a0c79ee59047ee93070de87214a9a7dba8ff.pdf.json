    "abstractText": "Background: Lupus nephritis (LN) is among the most severe organ manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), affecting between 31% and 48% of patients, usually within five years of SLE diagnosis. SLE without LN is associated with a high economic burden on the healthcare system, and although data are limited, several studies have shown that SLE with LN could increase this burden. Aim: We aimed to compare the economic burden of LN versus SLE without LN among patients managed in routine clinical practices in the USA and describe the clinical course of these patients. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective observational study of patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage health insurance. It included 2310 patients with LN and 2310 matched patients who had SLE without LN; each patient was followed for 12 months after diagnosis (the patient\u2019s index date). Outcome measures included healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), direct healthcare costs, and SLE clinical manifestations. Results: In all healthcare settings, the mean (SD) use of all-cause healthcare resources was significantly higher in the LN versus SLE without LN cohort, including the mean number of ambulatory visits (53.9 (55.1) vs 33.0 (26.0)), emergency room visits (2.9 (7.9) vs 1.6 (3.3)), inpatient stays (0.9 (1.5) vs 0.3 (0.8)), and pharmacy fills (65.0 (48.3) vs 51.2 (42.6)) (all p<0.001). Total all-cause costs per patient in the LN cohort were also significantly higher compared with the SLE without LN cohort ($50,975 (86,281) vs $26,262 (52,720), p<0.001), including costs for inpatient stays and outpatient visits. Clinically, a significantly higher proportion of patients with LN experienced moderate or severe SLE flares compared with the SLE without LN cohort (p<0.001), which may explain the difference in HCRU and healthcare costs. Conclusion: All-cause HCRU and costs were higher for patients with LN than for matched patients with SLE without LN, highlighting the economic burden associated with LN.

It included 2310 patients with LN and 2310 matched patients who had SLE without LN; each patient was followed for 12 months after diagnosis (the patient\u2019s index date). Outcome measures included healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), direct healthcare costs, and SLE clinical manifestations.\nResults: In all healthcare settings, the mean (SD) use of all-cause healthcare resources was significantly higher in the LN versus SLE without LN cohort, including the mean number of ambulatory visits (53.9 (55.1) vs 33.0 (26.0)), emergency room visits (2.9 (7.9) vs 1.6 (3.3)), inpatient stays (0.9 (1.5) vs 0.3 (0.8)), and pharmacy fills (65.0 (48.3) vs 51.2 (42.6)) (all p<0.001). Total all-cause costs per patient in the LN cohort were also significantly higher compared with the SLE without LN cohort ($50,975 (86,281) vs $26,262 (52,720), p<0.001), including costs for inpatient stays and outpatient visits. Clinically, a significantly higher proportion of patients with LN experienced moderate or severe SLE flares compared with the SLE without LN cohort (p<0.001), which may explain the difference in HCRU and healthcare costs.\nConclusion: All-cause HCRU and costs were higher for patients with LN than for matched patients with SLE without LN, highlighting the economic burden associated with LN.\nCategories: Nephrology, Rheumatology Keywords: systemic lupus erythematosus, renal lupus, lupus nephritis, nephritis, healthcare resource utilization, healthcare costs"

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogeneous autoimmune disorder that predominantly affects women of reproductive age [1,2]. Diagnosis of SLE can be difficult: early symptoms are variable and not specific, the disease may involve several different organs, and often there are fluctuations between periods of active and quiescent disease [3].\nLupus nephritis (LN) is among the most severe organ manifestations of SLE, affecting between 31% and 48% of patients post-SLE diagnosis, usually within the first five years of diagnosis [4]. Additionally, up to 28% of patients with LN can progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) [4]. The risk of death in patients with LN is six times that of the general population, increasing to up to 26 times in patients with ESKD [5]. Patients with SLE have a high burden of flares (episodes of increased disease activity), with ~95% of patients experiencing at least one flare in the first year post-diagnosis [6]. In patients with LN, the occurrence of renal flares is associated with progressive long-term kidney damage [7-9], and just a single renal flare can cause nephron loss and kidney damage that can impact the lifespan of the kidney [10].\nSLE is associated with a high economic burden on the healthcare system, with mean annual all-cause healthcare costs per patient in the USA between US$17,258 and US$63,022 [11-14].

DOI 10.7759/cureus.37839\nsomewhat limited, several studies have shown that patients with LN incurred between two and four times the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs compared with patients with SLE without LN and between two and six times the costs of matched controls without SLE [15-18]. In two of these studies, the increase in annual healthcare costs for patients with LN versus patients with SLE without LN was determined primarily by inpatient admissions, pharmacy services, and outpatient care [15,18]. Similarly, a recent study reported that a quarter of patients with LN had \u22651 hospitalization in the 12 months following diagnosis, and the total mean all-cause healthcare costs per patient per year were $45,469 [19].\nThe aims of this study were to compare the economic burden of LN versus SLE without LN among patients managed in routine clinical practices in the USA and describe the clinical course of these patients. Some of the data reported in this paper have been presented as a poster at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2020 (October 22-25, 2020), State of Texas Association of Rheumatologists (STAR) 2021 (February 26-28, 2021), Association of Women in Rheumatology (AWIR) 2021 (August 12-15, 2021), and Congress of Clinical Rheumatology-East and West (CCR-E and CCR-W) 2021 (CCR-E: August 12-15, 2021; CCR-W: September 18-21, 2021) annual meetings."

LN was not biopsy-confirmed as claims databases such as the one employed in this study do not contain laboratory and procedure results (e.g., biopsy results). In lieu of biopsy results, we developed a definition based on a previously validated claims algorithm to identify patients with LN [20]. For the LN cohort and SLE without LN cohort, the index date was the date during the identification period of the first claim with a renal diagnosis code or an SLE diagnosis code, respectively. The LN cohort comprised patients who had \u22652 diagnoses of renal conditions on non-diagnostic claims during the identification period and had \u22651 diagnosis of SLE in an inpatient stay or \u22652 outpatient diagnoses of SLE that were \u226530 days apart in the 12- month pre-index date (baseline period). The SLE without LN cohort comprised patients who had no diagnosis of LN during the identification or baseline periods and had \u22651 inpatient stay or \u22652 medical claims with a diagnosis of SLE that was \u226530 days apart during the identification period.\nAll patients were \u226518 years of age as of the index year, had been continuously enrolled in a health plan with medical and pharmacy coverage for \u226512 months prior to the index as well as for the 12-month period after the index date, and had valid and non-missing demographic variables.

            "text": "This retrospective observational study illustrated the increased economic and clinical burden associated with LN, as represented by the greater HCRU, costs of care, and frequency of flares and comorbidities for patients with LN versus matched patients with SLE without LN. These results highlight the importance of preventing SLE disease worsening and preventing the development of renal manifestations. The greatest difference in HCRU was driven by outpatient visits, emergency room visits, and inpatient stays. Total costs, which included medical and pharmacy costs, were almost double for patients with LN compared with patients with SLE without LN. In particular, the cost of inpatient stays was approximately three times higher for the LN cohort compared with the SLE without LN cohort.\nThe economic findings are consistent with a previous study by Pelletier et al., which found that patients with LN incurred substantially greater HCRU and higher healthcare costs compared with patients with SLE without LN, driven primarily by inpatient admissions and outpatient visits [15]. Pelletier et al. also reported that the mean total costs for patients with LN were 89% higher than for those with SLE without LN (US$21,733 vs US$11,471; 2008 values) [15]. Similarly, Carls et al. found that the mean total direct medical costs for patients with SLE without LN were significantly higher compared with matched controls without SLE (US$15,447 vs US$6819; difference: US$8628; 2005 values) [16]. However, the difference was much higher when comparing patients with LN with matched controls without SLE (US$58,389 vs US$11,527; difference: US$46,862; 2005 values) [16]. Li et al. also reported that annual medical costs for patients with LN were approximately two to three times those of patients with SLE without LN, and the number of inpatient visits were three to four times those of the control cohort without SLE [18].\n2023 Bell et al. Cureus 15(4): e37839. DOI 10.7759/cureus.37839 11 of 14\nRegarding the clinical burden of LN, more patients with LN had hematologic disorders and fever than patients with SLE without LN, and proteinuria and uPCR levels were almost five times and over five times those of the patients with SLE without LN, respectively. Patients with LN were also more likely to experience moderate or severe SLE or LN flares than patients with SLE without LN, and significantly more patients with LN received oral corticosteroids. The increased risk of flares could help to explain why patients with LN have higher HCRU and healthcare costs compared with patients with SLE without LN, as the occurrence of SLE flares has previously been associated with higher HCRU and costs when compared with patients without flares [24]. Future analyses could further evaluate the costs of flares and LN progression by stratifying the HCRU and healthcare costs of patients with LN, with and without ESKD or dialysis. Patients with LN also had lower average eGFR rates compared with patients with SLE without LN. Given that renal flares are commonly associated with impaired renal function and CKD [7-9], and a single renal flare is sufficient to cause kidney damage that can affect the lifespan of the kidney [10], preventing renal flares is an important strategy for managing disease burden in patients with LN.\nFinally, the most frequently used post-index treatments among both cohorts were corticosteroids and antimalarials; however, ACEis and ARBs were also frequently used in patients with LN, while NSAIDs were used in patients with SLE without LN. Corticosteroids have been associated with short- and long-term adverse events (including high blood pressure and glucose levels, sleep disorders, weight gain, cataracts, osteoporosis, and diabetes) and organ damage in SLE [25-27]. Therefore, the frequent use of corticosteroids (including doses \u22657.5 mg of prednisone equivalent per day) in both cohorts may highlight an unmet need for corticosteroid-sparing treatments for SLE and LN. Interestingly, while overall corticosteroid use was similar between the two groups, corticosteroid use differed considerably based on formulation; more patients with LN used oral corticosteroids versus patients with SLE without LN, while conversely, fewer patients with LN used intravenous corticosteroids compared with patients with SLE without LN. A previous study by Pelletier et al. demonstrated that patients with LN were more likely to be treated with immunosuppressants or corticosteroids compared with patients with SLE without LN [15]. Rates of nonbiologic immunosuppressant use in the current study were also higher among patients with LN compared with those with SLE without LN, although immunosuppressants were not used as frequently as other treatment classes. Both studies showed higher rates of corticosteroid use in patients with LN compared with those with SLE without LN. The higher use of ACEis and ARBs we observed is likely related to the increased rates of hypertension and proteinuria in our LN cohort versus the SLE without LN cohort. The higher use of NSAIDs in patients with SLE without LN was expected as, while it is a common treatment in SLE, this is a contraindication for patients with CKD [28].\nThis study has several limitations, most of which are inherent to observational studies based on claims data. These include the potential for data coding and entry errors, the possibility of incorrect diagnoses, the inability to confirm that a patient took the medication as prescribed, and the fact that the claims databases do not capture indirect costs. Additionally, the study population was limited to patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage insurance coverage, so the results may not be generalizable to the general population. In particular, the inclusion of Medicare Advantage patients may have skewed the population older than is typical for LN [4,18,29]. Further limitations include the use of renal manifestation diagnosis codes to identify LN, rather than using kidney biopsy results, and the algorithm used in this study for identifying flares may not accurately capture renal flares among patients with LN. We used a previously validated claims algorithm to identify patients and assigned them to the cohort of patients with LN, when in fact these patients may not have been formally diagnosed with LN [20]. In addition, adopting definitions of renal flares based on laboratory assessments, as in the phase III BLISS-LN trial assessing the effects of belimumab on kidney outcomes in patients with LN [30], may improve the accuracy of flare reporting in future studies. A further limitation is that laboratory results were only available for a subset of patients and may have been incomplete. Finally, patients who were excluded due to the matching procedure may represent a specific population, which could introduce bias.\nNevertheless, this study had several strengths as well, including using a data source that represented a broad and geographically diverse sample of insured patients in a real-world setting across the USA, and a matched control cohort that was used to control for potential confounding differences among patient groups at baseline."

            "text": "This analysis of real-world data from the USA demonstrates that all-cause HCRU and healthcare costs were significantly higher for patients with LN than those with SLE without LN. In particular, patients with LN experienced a higher mean number of ambulatory visits, emergency room visits, inpatient stays, and pharmacy fills compared with patients with SLE without LN. This highlights the substantial additional economic burden associated with LN. The results also demonstrate the increased clinical burden for patients with LN, underscoring the importance of preventing SLE disease worsening and preventing the development of renal manifestations. In the future, it would be of interest to investigate how renal involvement affects the HCRU and healthcare costs of patients with other systemic diseases compared with LN.\nAdditional Information"
