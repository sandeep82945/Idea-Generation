1. **Investigate the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-driven approaches to patient selection for adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in stage II colon cancer (CC) in a prospective study.** This could involve conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the cost-effectiveness of AC guided by a biomarker panel to the cost-effectiveness of AC guided by standard clinicopathological factors.


2. **Evaluate the impact of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on the cost-effectiveness of AC in stage II and III CC.** This could involve collecting PROs from patients receiving AC and using these data to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with AC. The QALYs could then be used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of AC.


3. **Develop a model to estimate the societal costs of AC in stage II and III CC.** This model could include costs such as travel costs, time off work, and lost productivity. The model could be used to estimate the total societal costs of AC and to compare these costs to the benefits of AC.


4. **Conduct a study to assess the impact of AC on the quality of life of patients with stage II and III CC.** This study could involve collecting data on the quality of life of patients receiving AC and comparing these data to the quality of life of patients not receiving AC. The results of this study could be used to inform decisions about the use of AC in these patients.


5. **Develop a decision-analytic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of different AC strategies in stage II and III CC.** This model could be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different AC strategies, such as single-agent AC, combination AC, and shortened AC. The model could be used to inform decisions about the most cost-effective AC strategy for these patients.
