    "abstractText": "The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E > 1018 eV) is one of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It has been suggested that UHECRs could be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and engine-driven supernovae (SNe). Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV) photon offset 0.97\u25e6 from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB 980425/SN 1998bw explosion. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the TeV emission on 17 November 2018, more than 20 years after the original GRB 980425/SN 1998bw trigger. TeV detections at high Galactic latitudes by the LAT are extremely rare, with an average of 6 events per year. We propose that the delayed TeV emission is consistent with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and/or electron-positron pairs from GRB 980425/SN 1998bw being deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) and subsequently cascading into secondary gamma rays. Based on the arrival time delay of the TeV emission, we estimate an IGMF strength of order B ' 10\u221212\u201310\u221213 Gauss. This result supports the possibility of UHECR acceleration in GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and suggests that most detected UHECRs are produced in local GRB/SNe within 200 Mpc. In addition, secondary photons from UHECRs out to 0.9\u201331 Gpc may also offer an explanation for extragalactic background photons with energies \u2265 1 TeV detected by the Fermi LAT. ar X iv :2 21 0. 11 43 0v 3 [ as tr oph .H E ] 3 1 Ja n 20 23",

            "text": "GRBs have long been proposed as the source of UHECRs [1, 2]. A scenario in which UHECRs are produced by GRBs should also generate cascades of secondary particles, gigaelectronvolt (GeV) and TeV photons as UHECRs propagate from their sources to the Earth [3\u20136]. Because we live in a magnetized Universe, magnetic fields deflect the trajectory of charged particles causing propagated delays on the arrival times of secondary photons. It is estimated that a significant fraction of gamma-ray photons produced in such cascades would reach our detectors with time delays on the order of years after the GRB detection, depending on the strength of the IGMF involved and the pervasiveness of magnetic voids [3]. The first direct evidence that long (\u2265 2 s) GRBs accompany some core-collapse type Ibc SNe was found on 25 April 1998 with the discovery of the nearby GRB980425/SN 1998bw at a redshift of z = 0.0085 [7\u201310]. Located at a distance of 36.9 megaparsecs (Mpc), GRB 980425/SN 1998bw lies well within the Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin (GZK) distance horizon [11, 12] and it remains the nearest known GRB/SN. Despite its proximity, GRB 980425 was not tremendously energetic, but it was accompanied by a Type Ibc supernova, SN 1998bw, whose unique characteristics provided the observational link between GRBs and stellar explosions. If UHECRs were accelerated in the GRB/progenitor of GRB 980425 [1, 13] or as part of the emerging supernova SN 1998bw [14\u201316], secondary photons produced in electromagnetic cascades may follow much later. Here, we report a search for this delayed TeV emission near the GRB 980425/SN 1998bw position with the Fermi LAT."

            "text": "The Fermi LAT is a pair-conversion detector covering the energy range from about 20 megaelectronvolt (MeV) to more than 2 TeV [17]. It has been operated nearly uninterrupted in an all-sky survey mode since August 2008. Using more than 14 years of Fermi-LAT data collected between 4 August 2008 and 20 September 2022, we searched for delayed \u2265 1 TeV emission around the position of GRB 980425/SN 1998bw. A detailed study of isotropic gamma-ray emission at energies > 100 GeV has been presented elsewhere [18]. Our LAT analysis uses standard methods and we only apply two cuts to the LAT event list with the Fermitools. Using gtselect we selected front/back Pass 8 events belonging to the P8R3_SOURCEVETO class (evclass = 2048, evtype = 3), which is similar to the P8R3_SOURCE selection but includes an additional cut on the Anti-Coincidence Detector (ACD) tile signal that depends on whether or not there is one non-hit tracker silicon strip detector (SSD) between the head of the track and the ACD [19]. A zenith angle cut of 90\u25e6 together with a gtmktime cut of DATA_QUAL>0 && LAT_CONFIG==1 was also applied. For \u2265 1 TeV incident photons,\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nthe 68% Fermi-LAT containment angle is less than 0.1\u25e6, but the effective area drops off in the TeV energy range [17]. Offset 0.97\u25e6 from the GRB 980425/SN 1998bw position derived by [20], we find a 1.4 TeV photon at right ascension (RA) = 294.2667\u25e6 and declination (dec.) = -51.92068\u25e6 (J2000); Galactic coordinates (`, b = 346\u25e6.0814,\u221227\u25e6.87171) detected on 17 November 2018 09:32:35.630 UTC. Figure 1 shows the position of the 1.4-TeV photon and GRB 980425/SN 1998bw in the gamma-ray sky. The next two nearest photons from the GRB 980425/SN 1998bw position lie at 4.0 \u25e6 and 10.6 \u25e6 respectively. Cross matching the \u2265 1 TeV LAT photon positions with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog [21, 22] produced 10 matches with known, catalogued gamma-ray sources assuming a matching radius rm = 0.12\u25e6, see Table 1. The matching radius was fixed at the maximum angular separation measured from the single largest source contributor at \u2265 1 TeV energies (6 matched photons), which is Markarian 421 (Table 1). Up to 17 November 2018, there are only 59 LAT photons in the energy range 1.0\u20133.8 TeV at Galactic latitudes b \u2265 |25\u25e6|. Assuming 10 photons matched to individual 4FGL sources, this leaves us with 49 unmatched \u2265 1 TeV photons. The Poisson probability p, or the probability that one or more of these 49 unmatched photons would fall within a 1-degree circle of GRB 980425/SN 1998bw as a function of the expectation value \u03bb, is given by\np = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb = 1\u2212 e\u2212r1\u00d7r2 (2.1) where r1 = 0.0028 TeV photons deg\u22122 stands for 49 unmatched photons over 1.7\u03c0 steradians at Galactic latitudes b \u2265 |25\u25e6| covered by the Fermi LAT, and a 1-degree circular region yields r2 = 3.1416 deg2. This results in a Poisson probability of having one or more chance coincidences p = 0.0088. In other words, the probability of a chance association between GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the 1.4-TeV photon is estimated to be about 0.88%.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nOne must bear in mind that magnetic deflections are actually expected at various points during the cascade development, thus the probability of a positional chance association should be formally lower.\nFor completeness, we searched for potential multi-wavelength counterparts near the TeV emission in the astronomical archives of the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). The closest gamma-ray source to this position is 4FGL J1946.55402 that lies 0.58\u25e6 away and has been identified as the millisecond pulsar PSR J1946-5403 [22, 23]. Gamma-ray pulsars are characterized by a very sharp exponential cutoff at energies around \u223c 5 GeV, which suppresses any possibility of TeV emission [24]. Furthermore, we found no cross-correlation between our \u2265 1 TeV sample and gamma-ray pulsars in the 4FGLDR3 catalog. GRB 980425/SN 1998bw is located near the edge of the so-called southern Fermi bubble, but the measured gamma-ray spectrum of the bubble structure has an energy cutoff at 110 \u00b1 50 GeV at high Galactic latitudes [25, 26]. Using the spatial boundaries for the bubbles derived by [26], we estimated an \u223c 640 deg2 spatial extension for each bubble. If the 49 unmatched photons were distributed isotropically over 1.7\u03c0 steradians, we would expect roughly 2 events to fall on top of each bubble at Galactic latitudes b \u2265 |25\u25e6|. There are indeed 2 unmatched TeV photons in the northern bubble, but there are 5 unmatched TeV photons in the southern bubble near where GRB 980425/SN 1998bw is located. The latter is not statistically significant but it faintly hints at a possible contribution from secondary emission due to GRB 980425/SN 1998bw. Additional LAT coverage over the next few years is needed to strengthen the case. Within 0.15\u25e6 of the 1.4-TeV photon position, there are two catalogued radio sources (8.1 and 36.3 millijansky respectively) detected as part of the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) carried out at 843 megahertz (MHz) with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope [27]. In agreement, two unrelated TeV-quiet elliptical and/or lenticular galaxies with radio emission are expected within a 0.15-degree circular region based on the 843-MHz source density of 31 \u00b1 3 sources deg\u22122 [27]. In addition, we found no evidence for ROSAT, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, XMM-Newton, or Chandra X-ray sources within 0.15\u25e6 of the TeV position.\nOur observational findings appear to align remarkably well with the angular size and time delay predicted for secondary gamma-ray emission produced by the propagation of UHECRs\n\u2013 3 \u2013\n[3\u20136]. After travelling through the host galaxy and the IGMF, parent UHECR particles with energy Ep can produce electron-positron pairs and charged/neutral pions. Neutral pions can decay and produce ultra-energetic gamma photons with typical energy E\u03b3 \u223c 0.1Ep. Further development of the electromagnetic cascade eventually converts most of the secondary particle energy into TeV emission. The total arrival time delay of the secondary emission \u03c4 would be the sum of the time it takes for UHECRs to cross the host galaxy \u03c4cross plus the UHECR travel time before starting the cascade \u03c4travel plus the time it takes for the cascade to generate GeV-TeV photons \u03c4cascade, which can be written\n\u03c4 = \u03c4cross + \u03c4travel + \u03c4cascade (2.2)\nThe crossing time for a 1020 eV UHECR moving through \u223c kpc scales and \u00b5G magnetic field within the host galaxy is given by\n\u03c4cross ' 4B2\u00b5G days (2.3)\nOnce the UHECR leaves the host galaxy, it will encounter the IGMF. The maximum travel time \u03c4travel before starting a cascade in the IGMF of strength B for an UHECR of energy 1020 eV located at a distance of 36.9 Mpc can be written in pG (10\u221212 G) units as\n\u03c4travel ' B2pG yrs (2.4)\nAfter the cascades start, electron pairs produced in the cascade are deflected by an IGMF of strength B, the magnetic deflection would induce a time delay \u03c4cascade of the secondary photons bracketed by the expected high-/low-energy ends of the cascade [3]\n\u03c4cascade ' (10\u2212 1000)B2pG yrs (2.5)\nFor the timescales observed here \u03c4crossing is negligible and the dominant factors \u03c4travel and \u03c4cascade are nearly of the same order. Assuming a time delay \u03c4 ' 20.5 yrs, this would imply that the IGMF strength is of the order B ' 10\u221212 \u2013 10\u221213 Gauss. Apart from delaying secondary photons, the IGMF may delay and spread the UHECR arrivals from GRB/SNe by millions of years [3]. Stellar environments where GRB/SNe take place are also a natural cradle of heavy nuclei that would tend to distort UHECR trajectories [28]. GRB 980425/SN 1998bw appears to be a very fortunate case where the time delay of the secondary TeV emission is in multi-decadal timescales and its relatively small magnetic deflection points back to the position of its source. A GRB/SN population model that generates most detected UHECRs requires sources to lie within 200 Mpc in order to satisfy the so-called Greisen\u2013Zatsepin\u2013Kuzmin (GZK) distance horizon [11, 12]. A local GRB/SN rate density of 700 \u00b1 360 Gpc\u22123 yr\u22121 has been estimated within 155 Mpc [29], which would supply a large number of UHECR accelerators within the GZK limit. The time delay for UHECRs propagating a distance D in a magnetic field B is given by \u03c4(E) ' 103yr(D/100Mpc)2 (B/10\u221211 G)2 (E/1020eV)\u22122 [30]. Super accelerated UHECRs with 1021 eV energies could reach us in a few decades, while their lower-energy (1019 eV) counterparts might take over millions of years. If UHECR time delays and arrivals from any single GRB/SN span a million years, at any moment there could be as many as \u223c 2\u00d7107 nearby GRB/SNe showering UHECRs, secondary photons and neutrinos within 200 Mpc. In order to meet the estimated energy input for UHECRs \u0393inj= (0.7\u201320) \u00d7 1044 erg Mpc\u22123 yr\u22121 [16, 31] with said GRB rate density, a total of (1\u201330) \u00d71050 ergs per explosion are required.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nThis seems well within reach of the energy budget inferred for GRB 980425/SN 1998bw of 2.2 \u00d71052 ergs [32]. An interesting outcome of such model is that it opens up the possibility that an important fraction of extragalactic background gamma rays are due to secondary emission from magnetically deflected UHECRs. Assuming 10 matches with known gamma-ray sources, we estimated that 49 out of 59 LAT TeV photons are unaccounted for or 83%. We propose that a number of these unmatched TeV photons are also secondary photons from UHECRs accelerated in nearby GRB/SNe. The only distance limit requirement here is the mean free path of the TeV photon before interacting with extragalactic background light (EBL) photons [33]. The best observational limits set a maximum distance for TeV emission somewhere between 0.9 and 31 Gpc [34]. This would provide an even larger volume over which the Fermi LAT would be able to detect extragalactic background \u2265 1 TeV photons."

            "text": "A detection of delayed TeV emission is consistent with UHECR acceleration taking place in GRB 980425/SN 1998bw at a distance of 36.9 Mpc. If this interpretation is correct, GRB/SNe within the GZK sphere might be responsible for most UHECRs, extragalactic background TeV photons, and even possibly neutrinos that are observed with current detectors. Further progress will result from continued observations of GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and other similar nearby events. A testable prediction is that delayed secondary GeV/TeV emission and UHECRs from GRB 980425/SN 1998bw may continue to arrive in the next tens to hundreds of years. Another testing site of the explanation presented here is the future detection of delayed GeV-TeV photons from the exceptionally bright GRB 221009A at redshift z = 0.1505 [35]. In general, secondary GeV-TeV emission is expected to arrive much earlier than UHECRs [3]. Based on our interpretation, extended gamma-ray, UHECR, and neutrino excesses may be detected around old, nearby GRB/SN explosion sites. Existing and future multi-messenger facilities are encouraged to monitor GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and other GRB/SNe within 200 Mpc. Going forward, the extraordinary wide field of view and cadence of the Fermi LAT offers unrivaled survey capabilities for additional delayed GeV-TeV emission searches."
