 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Perform in vitro testing of Promacta and tucatinib against influenza A (H7N9) virus to validate the in silico predictions of their antiviral activity. This would involve cell culture assays to assess virus replication inhibition. 

2. Synthesize analogs of Promacta and tucatinib to optimize their binding affinity and antiviral potency against influenza A (H7N9). Structure-activity relationship studies could identify key structural features that enhance antiviral effects.

3. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of Promacta and tucatinib in animal models of influenza A (H7N9) infection. This would assess antiviral effects, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity in a whole-organism model. 

4. Determine the mechanism of action of Promacta and tucatinib's influenza antiviral effects. Virological and biochemical assays could elucidate if they act by inhibiting neuraminidase activity, blocking viral entry, or other mechanisms.

5. Explore the potential of Promacta and tucatinib as combination therapies with existing influenza antivirals like oseltamivir. Combination therapy may improve efficacy and prevent emergence of antiviral resistance.
