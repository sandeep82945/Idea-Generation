The English literature is extremely sparse in discussing the clinical importance of BA.2.12.1 and in fact there are no reports for the unique veteran population which is different than the general population. Since the original Omicron variant, there has been multiple evolutionary branches. BA.2.12.1 specifically is the 12th sublineage to branch off from the second BA.2 branch from the original Omicron and is clade 22C. BA.2.12.1 has been described as having increased transmissibility compared to other subvariants of Omicron and even resistance to neutralization by antibodies elicited by a prior Omicron infection with a different subvariant, thus leading to a significant potential for reinfection. BA.2.12.1 is currently responsible for an increasing number of cases in the North American continent. This study was undertaken to explore the sequencing associated with the COVID-19 disease outbreak at a Veteran Affairs Community Living Center (CLC). Methods/Case Report: Samples were sent for the sequencing for patients affected during an outbreak of COVID-19 at a CLC from May to June 2022. All samples had a cycle threshold or number below 30 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, which was required for the sequencing analysis. The sequencing results and prior immunity history was obtained. Results (if a Case Study enter NA): A total of 9 CLC patient specimens were sent for sequencing. Of these 9, 7 had sequencing results and in the remaining 2, no sequencing results could be obtained due to lack of amplification. 6 of these 7 demonstrated Pango Lineage BA.2.12.1 or clade 22C. Only 1 of the 7 patients had a different subvariant (BA.2.9, clade 21L). Interestingly, all seven patients had either been previously vaccinated with a 3rd booster shot (6 of 7)\u00a0or previously infected with COVID19 without vaccination (1 of 7), indicating the ability of the two detected subvariants to cause breakthrough\nreinfection despite prior vaccination or infection earlier in the pandemic. Conclusion: The only recently described BA.2.12.1 has resistance to neutralization by antibodies produced by a prior infection or vaccination, leading to reinfection. This lineage was detected in nearly all cases of COVID-19 outbreak within a veteran nursing home CLC despite the presence of prior immunity."

            "text": "Introduction/Objective: The process from the time the patient is diagnosed with cancer and receives their first treatment is complex and time-consuming. It requires adherence to national comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) guidelines; is challenged with limited tissue, how and when to order tests, and reimbursement timelines with pre- authorizations. We evaluated the role of the pathologists, who are an integral part of patient care, along with oncologists and surgeons. Methods/Case Report: 254 cases from various types of solid tumors (paraffin-embedded blocks) were collected from several pathology departments. Tests (two panels NGS-DNA/RNA expression, FISH, PD-L1, and IHC) were ordered as early as on the day of diagnosis to as late as 18\u00a0months following the diagnosis. Cancer cases reviewed were Colo-Rectal (72), Lung (48), Breast (24), Gastric (10), CNS (8), Melanoma (4), Head/Neck (20), GU (16), Sarcomas (8), Thyroid (6), Hepatic (8), Female Genital Tract (7) and Unknown Primary (23). Results (if a Case Study enter NA): We evaluated pathology reports, identified blocks, reviewed H&E slides, utilized NCCN guidelines in collaboration with oncologists. Tests were ordered using established billing criteria. Following tests were performed: PD-L1 (190 - 75%), FISH (50 - 20%), and NGS \u2013 two simple panel approach (215 - 85%). Using the aforesaid methods, our NGS results were successful in >95%. We were able to identify actionable and prognostic mutations in >80% of tumors. Conclusion: Our algorithm has been designed considering NCCN guidelines and are updated frequently with new therapeutic targets and actionable mutations. The emphasis is to conserve diagnostic tissue and ensure timely ordering of tests as medically necessary. This can be adopted by pathologists in conjunction with clinical information, pathology reports, and be used as a part of diagnostic workups to reduce delays in treatment, avoid tissue loss, utilize current billing (inpatient/outpatient) practices, pre-authorization and eventually improving patient care as well as reduce overall healthcare costs.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ajcp/article/158/Supplem ent_1/S141/6815240 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024"
