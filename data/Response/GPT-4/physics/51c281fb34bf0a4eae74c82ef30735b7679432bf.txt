Exploration of Synergistic Effects of Compounds: Investigating the synergistic effects of the isolated compounds from Helichrysum rutilans when combined, to assess if they offer enhanced antioxidant or anti-tyrosinase activities compared to their individual effects. This could lead to the development of more potent natural antioxidant formulations for pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical applications.

Mechanistic Studies on Anti-tyrosinase Activity: Conducting in-depth studies to understand the mechanism of action behind the anti-tyrosinase activity of the compounds, particularly C-1 to C-4, which showed moderate inhibitory activities. Understanding the mechanisms can help in optimizing these compounds for better efficacy in treating hyperpigmentation disorders.

Formulation and Stability Testing of Cosmeceutical Products: Developing cosmeceutical products using the most active compounds as key ingredients, followed by assessing the stability, efficacy, and skin permeability of these formulations. This can include creating topical creams or serums for anti-aging, antioxidant protection, and skin-lightening effects.

Comparative Antioxidant Efficacy in Biological Models: Extending the antioxidant efficacy studies to in vivo models to compare the protective effects of Helichrysum rutilans extracts against oxidative stress-related diseases in biological systems. This would provide more concrete evidence of their potential health benefits and safety profiles.

Identification and Isolation of New Compounds: Given that this is the first report on the phytochemical and biological evaluation of H. rutilans, there's a possibility of undiscovered compounds within the plant. Future research could focus on further phytochemical investigations to isolate and identify new compounds, which could lead to the discovery of novel bioactivities.
