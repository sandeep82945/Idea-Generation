1. **Investigate the use of machine learning to optimize the selection of raw filter primitives and their parameters.** This could help to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of raw filters.


2. **Explore the use of raw filters for other types of data, such as XML or binary data.** This could help to extend the applicability of raw filters to a wider range of applications.


3. **Develop new raw filter primitives that can be used to filter more complex data structures, such as arrays and objects.** This could help to improve the expressiveness of raw filters and make them more useful for a wider range of applications.


4. **Investigate the use of raw filters in other types of systems, such as network switches and routers.** This could help to improve the performance of these systems by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed by the CPU.


5. **Explore the use of raw filters for security applications, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems.** This could help to improve the security of these systems by reducing the amount of data that needs to be inspected.
