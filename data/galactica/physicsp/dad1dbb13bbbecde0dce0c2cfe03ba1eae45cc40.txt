conclusions Here we present a flexible environment chamber dedicated to experiments using liquid jet samples at the FXE Instrument at the European XFEL. The chamber was designed with very large openings on three sides, allowing simultaneous spectroscopic and diffraction/scattering experiments to be carried out simultaneously. It also allows the experimental conditions to easily changed between the two different emission spectrometers from FXE located at either side of the chamber without additional interferences, e.g. changes in the laser coupling, the sample jet or atmosphere inside the chamber. An advanced experiment detecting signals from both the dispersive and the scanning spectrometers is possible, depending on the Bragg angles needed for the crystal analyzers and the detectors. A high-speed liquid jet system using either Rayleigh or flat jets compatible with the sub-MHz operation of the FXE Instrument at EuXFEL was detailed. Our portfolio of commercial and 3D printed nozzles provides jets with thicknesses varying from 25 to 500 mm with excellent chemical compatibility for a large variety of solvents. The combination of the large area and flexibility of the FXE sample interaction region, the broad photon energy range of operation, and the MHz operation capabilities of EuXFEL enables additional types of demanding experiments that to date were not feasible on other FELs. For instance, fs-resolved XES experiments on very dilute systems and XES experiments combined with WAXS or XRD without reconfiguration of the setup are now routinely executed at FXE and provide broad opportunities for complete mapping of solute and solvation dynamics during ultrafast photochemical processes.
