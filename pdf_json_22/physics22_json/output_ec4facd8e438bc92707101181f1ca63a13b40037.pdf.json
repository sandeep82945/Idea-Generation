In view of the long-standing tension in the determination of the CKM matrix elements |\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f | and |\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4f | from exclusive and inclusive processes, recently, the use of lattice QCD has been extended towards the description of inclusive decays. Since the determination of hadronic input parameters from QCD based methods require independent tests, we focus on the charm sector, since it not only offers experimental data, but also well determined CKM parameters. We carry out a pilot lattice simulation for the \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60 \u2192 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc60\u2113\ud835\udf08 and explore the improvement of existing techniques. Our simulation employs M\u00f6bius domain-wall charm and strange quarks whose masses are tuned to be approximately physical and we cover the whole kinematical region. We report on our progress in analyzing different sources of systematic effects, such as the extrapolation of the kernel function chosen for the Chebsyhev approximation as well as the influence on the analysis in the region close to the kinematical limit.\nThe 39th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2022), 08.-13.

            "text": "In recent years, experiments have revealed a puzzling tension in B-decays, namely, in the determination of the CKM parameters |\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f | and |\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4f | from exclusive and inclusive methods [1]. This discrepancy provides an opportunity for theorists to improve their understanding of these decays. Furthermore, the search for new physics requires precise theoretical predictions from the Standard Model. In view of these points, recently, ideas to extend the application of lattice QCD towards the description of inclusive decays have been proposed [2\u20136]. These approaches utilize either the Chebyshev approximation or the Backus-Gilbert approach to obtain the energy integral of the hadronic tensor, which defines the inclusive decay rates. In this paper, we report on our progress in the application of this method towards a precise calculation of the inclusive semi-leptonic decay of the \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60-meson with a focus on presenting a method to control the systemtic error, which appears in the approximation of the kernel function in the energy integral. First, we give a brief overview of the theoretical framework of our analysis and present the formulas used in the Chebyshev approximation. And secondly, we present our preliminary results of the analysis, as well as a first, admittedly conservative, way to estimate the error in the limits that have to be taken to properly estimate the inclusive decay rate."

In our case, we employ the shifted Chebyshev polynomials \ud835\udc47\u2217\n\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udf14) to create an approximation of \ud835\udc3e (?\u0302?) in the\nintegration range [\ud835\udf140,\u221e] with 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf140 < \ud835\udf14min. In the following, we show the behavior of the Chebyshev approximation depending on the choice of the kernel function. This is shown in Figure 1. First, we consider the kernel function \ud835\udc3e (\ud835\udc92, \ud835\udf14) of a simple Heaviside function\n\ud835\udc3e (\ud835\udf14) = \ud835\udf03 (\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60 \u2212 \u221a\ufe03 \ud835\udc922 \u2212 \ud835\udf14) , (6)\nto implement the upper limit of the \ud835\udf14 integral. The approximation results are shown in Figure 1a and we see that by simply increasing the number of polynomials in the Chebyshev approximation from 5 to 20 increases the oscillations of the approximation. In order to stabilize the approximation, we smear the kernel function by introducing a smearing parameter \ud835\udf0e, i.e we employ a Sigmoid function of the form\n\ud835\udf03\ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60 \u2212 \u221a\ufe03 \ud835\udc922 \u2212 \ud835\udf14) \u2261 1\n1 + \ud835\udc52\u2212 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60\n\u2212 \u221a \ud835\udc922\u2212\ud835\udf14\n\ud835\udf0e\n, (7)\nand the approximation result is shown in Figure 1b. While this approach allows for a \"smoother\" approximation, it now requires us to take the limit of \ud835\udf0e \u2192 0 in addition to \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e to obtain a proper estimate. This source of systematical error is the focus of this work. To finalize this section, let us write down how we construct our approximation.

Firstly, we can use it to suppress the statistical noise for high orders of \ud835\udc57 in the Chebyshev approximation where we expect huge cancellation among different orders of \ud835\udc65. And secondly, it allows us to estimate the upper limit of the error, since all Chebyshev matrix elements are bounded by \u00b11 for any \ud835\udc57 ."

The approximation is obtained for \ud835\udc41 = 10 Chebyshev polynomials and the smearing of the kernel function is given by \ud835\udf0e = 1/\ud835\udc41 = 0.1.

All the data have been generated with Grid [8] and Hadrons [9] software packages. Part of the fits in the analysis has been performed using lsqfit [10].\nThe number of configurations averaged are 50 and the measurement is duplicated with 8 different source time slices.

The \ud835\udf14-integral is then obtained by using the representation (8).\nIn Figure 2 we show the preliminary results for the energy integral ?\u0304? defined in (4), where we decompose ?\u0304? into different contributions, i.e. whether we have vector (VV) or axial-vector (AA) current insertions, as well as the polarization of the inserted currents, i.e. parallel (\u2225) and perpendicular (\u22a5) to the momentum \ud835\udc92. Our results are shown for a choice of \ud835\udc41 = 10 and the smearing of the kernel function (7) is defined through \ud835\udf0e = 1/\ud835\udc41 = 0.1. With the available data, \ud835\udc41 = 10 is the highest order that we can achieve with the Chebyshev approximation, since the statistical noise of the lattice data becomes too large for orders of \ud835\udc41 > 10. In Figure 2, we also include a contribution to ?\u0304? \u2225\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 from the exclusive semi-leptonic \ud835\udc37 \u2192 \ud835\udc3e decay, allowing us to\nsurmise that our results are in the right ballpark. We comment on the region close to the end of the phase space, i.e. the point of \ud835\udc92 = (1, 1, 1) corresponding to \ud835\udc922 \u2248 0.66 GeV2 shown in Figure 2, for \ud835\udc4b \u2225 \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 and \ud835\udc4b \u2225 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\n. In this region, a dominant contribution from the ground state is expected for \ud835\udc4b \u2225\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 , since the excited state energy exceeds the\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 2 ) 4 1 4\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60 meson mass, while the expected contribution to \ud835\udc4b \u2225\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 should already be zero, because the lowest energy state (\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60-vector) has an energy lager than \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc60 . Figure 2 shows large discrepancies between these expected values (dashed lines) and our approximation (data points)."

In this case we expect contributions from the vector meson in the final state. At \ud835\udc92 = (1, 1, 1), the energy of the lowest state is already above the threshold, so that the expected result is zero. For a finite order of the polynomials \ud835\udc41 = 10 and a non-zero smearing width \ud835\udf0e = 0.1, Figure 2 shows that this is not the case. To take both, \ud835\udf0e \u2192 0 and \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e, limits simultaneously, we set \ud835\udf0e = 1/\ud835\udc41 and consider the evolution of our approximation as a function of 1/\ud835\udc41 . The result is shown in Figure 3, where \ud835\udc41 is taken to be between 10 and 100. To access the Chebyshev matrix elements of orders higher than \ud835\udc41 = 10, we use the property (10) of the Chebyshev matrix elements, i.e. the fact that the Chebyshev matrix elements are bound by 0 \u00b1 1. It allows us to simply add up the absolute values of the Chebyshev coefficients for \ud835\udc57 > 10 in (8) to obtain a mathematical upper limit of the error for any given order of \ud835\udc41 . Additionally, we include the result of our approximation in that we only consider the ground state contribution. This estimate is obtained by fitting the lattice data and the extracted ground state energy is used to calculate the Chebyshev matrix elements up to arbitrary order. We can see that even for the limited number of polynomials, say \ud835\udc41 = 100, the approximation approaches zero sufficiently fast.\n0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 1/N\n0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nX [G\neV 2 ]\ninclusive ground state only\nXAA, 0 = 0.9 min, -1_-1_-1 XAA, GSC, 0 = 0.9 min\nFigure 3: Development of approximation results for \ud835\udc4b \u2225 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34 at \ud835\udc92 = (1, 1, 1) depending on the number of polynomials \ud835\udc41 used in the Chebyshev approximation.

We have to take both of these contributions into consideration to obtain an estimate of the ground-state-only contribution, which, together with the results obtained from using the inclusive data, are shown in Figure 4. Here, it is important to note how the error on the inclusive data is estimated. Taking into account the analytical form of the approximation given in Eq. (8) and the fact that for higher orders of \ud835\udc41 the Chebyshev matrix elements are basically given by 0\u00b11, we can construct an error estimate by simply adding up the absolute values of the coefficients \ud835\udc50\u2217\n\ud835\udc57 appearing in the approximation. These\nerror estimates are shown in Figure 4. The figure shows that our error estimate is able to cover the expected ground state contribution. Furthermore, the behavior of the ground state contribution, i.e. the steady increase of the approximation value, shown in the Figure 4 is expected. For ?\u0304? \u2225\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\nat \ud835\udc92 = (1, 1, 1) the range of the energy integral is quite narrow and this range is dominated by the ground state. So that depending of the choice of the Chebyshev polynomials \ud835\udc41 , and consequently the smearing \ud835\udf0e, our approximation monotonously increases towards the true value.\nFinally, let us close this section by showing how the results shown in Figure 2 change if we increase \ud835\udc41 to 100 and apply the error estimation method discussed above. The results are shown in Figure 5. The Figure shows that even if the number of polynomials is increased the central values of the approximation remains stable. This should also be the case if we take the \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e limit. At the same time we see that the error bars also start increasing significantly. We note that the error bars shown in this plot are most likely overestimated since we are assuming the mathematical upper limit.

We focused on the systematical error arising due to the approximation of the kernel function and presented a conservative error estimate employing the mathematical properties of the Chebyshev approximation. With this estimate we are able to cover the expected ground state contribution for the region close to the kinematical limit where a ground state dominance is expected. To obtain more realistic error bars further study is required. Once a proper error estimate is available we will obtain estimates for the total decay rate and compare our results with experimental data [12].
