Although bowel preparation influences small bowel visibility for small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE), the optimal timing for bowel preparation has not been established yet. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the optimal timing of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for small bowel preparation before SBCE. This multicenter prospective observational study was conducted on patients who underwent SBCE following bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Patients were categorized into three groups according to the time used for completing PEG ingestion: group A, within 6 h; group B, 6–12 h; and group C, over 12 h. The percentage of unclean segment in small bowel (unclean image duration / small bowel transit time × 100) and small bowel visibility quality (SBVQ) were evaluated according to the time interval between the last ingestion of PEG and swallowing of small bowel capsule endoscope. A total of 90 patients were enrolled and categorized into group A (n = 40), group B (n = 27), and group C (n = 23). The percentage of unclean segment in the entire small bowel increased gradually from group A to C (6.6 ± 7.6% in group A, 11.3 ± 11.8% in group B, and 16.2 ± 10.7% in group C, p = 0.001), especially in the distal small bowel (11.4 ± 13.6% in group A, 20.7 ± 18.7% in group B, and 29.5 ± 16.4% in group C, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with adequate SBVQ in group A was significantly (p < 0.001) higher (30/40, 75.0%) than that in group B (17/27, 63.0%) or group C (5/23, 21.7%). In multivariate analysis, group A was associated with an increased likelihood of adequate SBVQ compared with group C (odds ratio [OR]: 13.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.53–48.30, p < 0.001). Completing PEG ingestion within 6 h prior to SBCE could enhance small bowel visibility. 1. conclusions The timing of bowel preparation within 6 h between the last ingestion of PEG and swallowing of SBC can improve the quality of small bowel visibility. The percentage of unclean segment in the entire small bowel increased gradually according to the time interval needed for completing bowel preparation, especially in the distal small bowel.
