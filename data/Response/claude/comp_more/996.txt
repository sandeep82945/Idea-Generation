 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper on multimodal emotion recognition:

1. Explore different graph neural network architectures like GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN for the graph contrastive learning framework. The current work uses standard GCN, but other GNN variants may learn better representations. 

2. Investigate semi-supervised or weakly supervised graph contrastive learning. The current approach requires full emotion labels, but semi-supervised contrastive learning may help with limited labeled data.

3. Apply the multimodal fusion and graph contrastive learning to other dialogue tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection, etc. The techniques may transfer well to related conversational AI problems.

4. Extend the framework to handle imbalanced emotions by using techniques like oversampling or loss re-weighting. The current approach struggles with rare emotions.

5. Evaluate the model on real-world conversational datasets from customer service, online forums, social media etc. Testing on natural dialogues can better validate the techniques.
