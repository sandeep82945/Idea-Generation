    "abstractText": "In this paper, we study an elastic bilayer plate composed of a nematic liquid crystal elastomer in the top layer and a nonlinearly elastic material in the bottom layer. While the bottom layer is assumed to be stress-free in the flat reference configuration, the top layer features an eigenstrain that depends on the local liquid crystal orientation. As a consequence, the plate shows non-flat deformations in equilibrium with a geometry that non-trivially depends on the relative thickness and shape of the plate, material parameters, boundary conditions for the deformation, and anchorings of the liquid crystal orientation. We focus on thin plates in the bending regime and derive a two-dimensional bending model that combines a nonlinear bending energy for the deformation, with a surface Oseen-Frank energy for the director field that describes the local orientation of the liquid crystal elastomer. Both energies are nonlinearly coupled by means of a spontaneous curvature term that effectively describes the nematic-elastic coupling. We rigorously derive this model as a \u0393-limit from three-dimensional, nonlinear elasticity. We also devise a new numerical algorithm to compute stationary points of the two-dimensional model. We conduct numerical experiments and present simulation results that illustrate the practical properties of the proposed scheme as well as the rich mechanical behavior of the system.",

            "text": "Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are solids made of liquid crystals (LC) incorporated into a polymer network. In an isotropic phase (at high temperature) the LC are randomly oriented, while in the nematic phase (at low temperature) the LC show an orientational order and the material features a coupling between the entropic elasticity of the polymer network and the LC orientation. LCE exhibit various interesting physical properties (e.g., soft elasticity [35, 34], or thermo-mechanical coupling [21, 60]), and are considered in the design of active thin sheets that show a complex change of shape upon thermo-mechanical (or photo-mechanical) actuation, see [61] for a recent review and [59, 56] for existing and future applications, cf. Figure 1. Understanding the mechanical properties of such thin films is the subject of current research in physics, mechanics, and mathematics; e.g., see [25, 24, 49, 48, 23, 2, 1, 4, 3] for a selection of contributions that focus on mathematical modeling and analysis of nematic LCE films.\nIn our paper, we consider a thin bilayer plate with a top layer consisting of a nematic LCE and a bottom layer consisting of a usual nonlinearly elastic material. In view of the nematicelastic coupling, the top layer features a non-vanishing eigenstrain, while the bottom layer is stress-free in flat reference configurations. As a result, non-flat equilibrium shapes emerge with a geometry that is the result of a non-trivial interplay between the orientation of the LC and the deformation of the plate. Various shapes have been observed experimentally, e.g., see [61, 53, 28]. In particular, films have been studied that \u201cbend\u201d in order to achieve equilibrium, e.g., [53].\nThe goal of the present paper is to develop and analyze an effective, two-dimensional model for the nematic LCE bilayer plate, which is able to predict non-trivial bending deformations as energy minimizers and stationary points. For this purpose, we consider a three-dimensional, geometrically nonlinear elasticity model for the bilayer plate that invokes both \u2014 the elastic energy of the elastomer and the Frank energy of the LCE. As a main result, we rigorously derive a two-dimensional bending model from the three-dimensional model as a \u0393-limit; here, we focus on a regime where the thickness of the plate is comparable with the relaxation length-scale of the LC directors and we consider an energy scaling that is compatible with bending deformations. Secondly, we devise a numerical algorithm to compute stationary points of the two-dimensional model and present simulation results that illustrate the rich mechanical behavior of the system.\nOur simulations are able to reproduce characteristic material traits that are observed in physical experiments as shown in Figure 1, where the compression of an LCE strip leads to classical Euler buckling or non-Euler buckling. In the physical experiment from [59] as well as in the numerical simulation illustrated in the figure, the buckling behavior is determined by the alignment of the director, which is either uniaxial along the long direction of the strip, or is patterned, i. e. it is constantly parallel to the long direction of the strip in its left half, undergoes a rotation of \u03c0/2 around the surface normal in a small transition region close to the center of the strip, and then is constant again in most of its right half.\nIn contrast to earlier works, our model is not restricted to situations, where the orientation of the LC is prescribed. We also analyze settings, where the orientation of the LC is not prescribed and thus allows for a soft elastic response. We also consider partial constraints (e.g., restrictions to the tangential plane) for the LC orientation. Let us present the main contributions of our paper with more detail: We denote by S \u2286 R2 the mid-surface of the plate and by 0 < h 1 its thickness. We denote the rescaled domain of the plate by \u2126 := S \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2) and its top layer by \u2126top. As we shall explain in Section 2.5 an appropriate model for the bilayer plate is given by the (rescaled and non-dimensionalized)\nenergy functional,\nEh(yh, nh) := 1\nh2 \u02c6 \u2126\\\u2126top W ( x3,\u2207hyh(x) ) dx+ 1 h2 \u02c6 \u2126top W ( x3, (Lh(nh(x))) \u2212 1 2\u2207hyh(x) ) dx\n+ \u03b5\u03042 \u02c6\n\u2126top\n|\u2207hnh(x) ( \u2207hyh(x) )\u22121|2 det(\u2207hyh(x)) dx, (1) where yh : \u2126 \u2192 R3 denotes the deformation of the plate and nh : \u2126top \u2192 S2 (with S2 being the unit sphere in R3) the director field (pulled back to the reference domain). It describes the orientation of the LC. Above, \u2207h := (\u2207\u2032, 1h\u22023) := (\u22021, \u22022, 1 h\u22023) denotes the scaled gradient that comes from upscaling the domain to unit thickness. The third integral describes the OseenFrank energy of the nematic LCE (in the simple form of a one-constant approximation). Here, \u03b5\u03042 > 0 is a parameter that is related to the modulus of Frank elasticity, the shear modulus of the elastic material, and the physical thickness of the plate; see Section 2.5 for details. The first and second integral in (1) describe the elastic energy stored in the deformed plate. Here, W denotes a stored energy function that describes a frame-indifferent, non-degenerate material with a stress-free reference state (see Assumption 2.1 below for the precise assumptions), and\nLh(n) := r \u2212 1 3 h (I + (rh \u2212 1)n\u2297 n), n \u2208 S 2, (2)\ndenotes the step-length tensor introduced by Bladon, Terentjev and Warner [17, 60] to model the nematic-elastic coupling. We note that the coupling is active in the nematic phase (when the order parameter satisfies rh > 1) and enforces stretching (resp. compression) in the direction parallel to n (resp. in directions orthogonal to n). In the isotropic phase, which corresponds to rh = 1, the coupling is inactive. Since we are interested in the bending behavior of the plate, and since bending modes have an energy per unit volume, that scales quadratically with the thickness of the plate, we consider the scaling factor h\u22122 in front of the first two integrals in (1), and we make the assumption that rh = 1 + hr\u0304 for some fixed constant r\u0304 \u2208 R.\nTheorem 2.3, which is the analytic main result of the paper, shows that in the zero-thickness limit h \u2192 0, the energy functional Eh \u0393-converges to a two-dimensional model. It takes the form of an energy E(y, n) defined for bending deformations\ny \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) := { y \u2208 H2(S;R3) : (\u2207\u2032y)>\u2207\u2032y = I2\u00d72 } ,\nand director fields n \u2208 H1(S;S2). Here and below, Id\u00d7d denotes the unit matrix in Rd\u00d7d. The energy E couples a nonlinear plate model (quadratic in curvature) with a surface Oseen-Frank energy. In the special case of a homogeneous material, the derived model takes the form\nE(y, n) := \u02c6 S Qel\n( IIy + 3\n4 r\u0304\n( 1\n3 I \u2212 n\u0302\u2032 \u2297 n\u0302\u2032\n)) + 3\n16 r\u03042Qel\n( 1\n3 I \u2212 n\u0302\u2032 \u2297 n\u0302\u2032\n) + \u03b5\u03042\n2 |\u2207\u2032n|2dx\u2032,\nwhere IIy := \u2207\u2032y> \u2207\u2032(\u22021y \u2227 \u22022y) and n\u0302\u2032 := \u2207\u2032y>n\ndenote the second fundamental form (in local coordinates) of the isometric immersion y and the in-plane component of the director n in local coordinates, respectively. (See Figure 2 for the geometrical meaning of n and n\u0302\u2032.) Above, Qel is a quadratic form obtained from W by a relaxation formula, which in the special case of a homogeneous and isotropic material can be explicitly written down, see Lemma 2.4. The elastic energy of the bottom layer, the preferred curvature resulting from an inhomogeneous mismatch between the layers, and the Oseen-Frank term describing the crystalline order\nof the LCE layer yield competing contributions to the dimensionally reduced energy functional. Characteristic properties of the three-dimensional model such as non-vanishing eigenstrain in the LCE layer are preserved in the two-dimensional setting, which itself exhibits its own characteristics: in many cases, the preferred curvature tensor 34 r\u0304( 1 3I \u2212 n\u0302\n\u2032 \u2297 n\u0302\u2032) cannot be attained by the second fundamental form of an isometric immersion of a flat reference configuration. This leads to non-vanishing bending stresses. In order to explore the model behavior by means of numerical simulations in Section 3, we discretize the two-dimensional energy using discrete Kirchhoff triangular (DKT) elements for the deformation y and Lagrange P1 finite elements for the director n. Functions in the corresponding finite element spaces are required to satisfy the isometry and unit-length constraints node-wise up to some small tolerance. We approximate stationary points of the discretized energy via alternating between descent steps resulting from discrete H2- and H1-gradient flows for the deformation and the director field, respectively, using linearizations of the corresponding constraints. Our numerical experiments confirm the rich behavior of the model: We investigate typical properties of the modeled LCE plates with an emphasis on the effects induced by prescribing various boundary conditions for the director, which in some situations have a significant influence on the energy landscape. Most noteworthy, for a rectangular LCE plate clamped on two opposing sides, with certain combinations of coupling and order parameters r\u0304 and \u03b5\u0304, imposing director boundary conditions may be used to select between a notable energy response or almost no response with respect to compression, effectively rendering the plate softer or more rigid.\nWe conclude the introduction by comparing our findings with previous results of the literature. As all rigorous derivations of nonlinear bending models from 3d, our \u0393-convergence result for Eh is based on the theory developed by Friesecke, James, Mu\u0308ller [26]. In particular, if we consider yh 7\u2192 Eh(yh, nh) with the director field nh being fixed, and if we neglect the nematic-elastic coupling, i.e., rh = 1, then we recover the celebrated result of [26]. Furthermore, if we consider yh 7\u2192 Eh(yh, nh) (with nh being still fixed) and rh = 1 + hr\u0304 with r\u0304 6= 0, we end up with a model similar to yh 7\u2192 \u00b4 \u2126W (\u2207hyh(I + hB)\n\u22121) dx with a prestrain (I + hB) that is of the order of the plate\u2019s thickness. Problems of that type (with applications beyond nematic LCE plates) have been extensively studied in recent years, e.g., see [54, 55, 40, 16, 45, 36, 15, 18]. In this flavor, also bending models for nematic LCE plates with a prescribed and a fixed director n have been derived, [2, 1, 4, 5]. In contrast to these works, in our model the director field n is a free variable of the model. This leads to the presence of additional nonlinearities in our model; namely, the coupling term Lh(nh) in the second integral in (1) and the factor (\u2207hyh)\u22121 \u221a det\u2207hyh in the third integral in (1). In our proof we shall first obtain an a priori estimate for \u2207hnh in Lp for 1 < p < 2 that eventually implies that 1h(Lh(nh) \u2212 1 2 \u2212 I) strongly converges. In order to obtain the a priori estimate on \u2207hnh (see Lemma 4.1) we need to assume a sufficiently strong (yet physical) growth of W (F ) for detF \u2192 0 and for |F | \u2192 \u221e (see Assumption 2.1 below). We also treat the case of clamped, affine boundary conditions for y on flat parts of the lateral boundary \u2202S \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2), see Section 2.3. We note that such boundary conditions have already been treated in the purely elastic case in [26] based on a Lipschitz truncation argument, which, however, does not extend to situations with prestrain. Instead, we introduce a different argument that invokes an approximation result of independent interest: we prove that the well-known density of H2iso(S;R3) \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3) in H2iso(S;R3) (see [46, 31]) extends to the case with clamped, affine boundary conditions, see Proposition 2.11. In Section 2.4 we also analyze in detail the emergence of 2d-anchorings for the director field from 3d-anchorings. This is partly motivated by [27], where dimension reduction is carried out for non-deformable nematic plates in a Q-Tensor setting. We consider both strong and weak anchorings on lateral parts of the boundary, as well as on the mid-surface. In particular, the analysis of boundary- and anchoring conditions for y and n justifies the model problems that we consider in our numerical\nsimulations in Section 3.3. In Section 3.1 we devise a discretization of the two-dimensional energy based on discrete Kirchhoff triangular (DKT) elements for the deformation and Lagrange P1 finite elements for the director that requires the unit-length and isometry constraints to be satisfied up to a small tolerance in the nodes of a triangulation. Consequently, in Section 3.2 we propose a discrete gradient flow scheme using linearizations of the respective constraints for approximating stationary points of the discretized energy. The approach, which alternates between H1- and H2gradient descent steps for director and deformation, essentially combines techniques developed in [6, 10] for harmonic maps and in [7, 8, 13, 12, 11, 14] for the isometric bending of prestrained bilayer plates. Numerical experiments in Section 3.3 serve to illustrate both the behavior of the two-dimensional model as well as practical properties of the numerical scheme which we plan to analyze in a follow-up paper. For isometric plate bending a similar H2-gradient flow approach based on a discontinuous Galerkin discretization has been analyzed in [19]. An application of that method to the case of (normal elastic) bilayers has been investigated experimentally in [20]. For harmonic maps, an alternative approach that relies on a conforming discretization of the target manifold in the form of geodesic finite elements is presented in [51, 52]. Finite element methods for the Ericksen model of nematic LC with variable degree of orientation, i. e., in the case that \u03b5\u0304 = \u03b5\u0304(x) is not constant, have been considered in [43, 58].\nStructure of the paper. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the precise setup, present the definition of the two-dimensional limiting functional and state the main \u0393-convergence result. Section 2.3 is devoted to the discussion of boundary conditions for the deformation. Anchoring for n is discussed in Section 2.4. Section 2.5 discusses the modeling and non-dimensionalization of the energy. All proofs are postponed to Section 4. In Section 3 we formulate the numerical algorithm and present simulation results.\nNotation. In the paper we shall mostly use standard notation whose meaning is evident from the context. Furthermore, the following less standard notation is used:\n\u2022 For x \u2208 R3 we write x = (x\u2032, x3), and call x\u2032 the in-plane components and x3 the out-ofplane component of x.\n\u2022 \u2207\u2032 := (\u22021, \u22022) denotes the in-plane gradient, and \u2207h := (\u2207\u2032, 1h\u22023) denotes the scaled gradient.\n\u2022 Both of the above conventions are dropped in Section 3 where, to simplify notation, 2dcoordinates and gradients are denoted with x and \u2207, respectively.\n\u2022 I denotes the identity matrix on Rd\u00d7d; sometimes we write Id\u00d7d to avoid ambiguities.\n\u2022 H2iso(S;R3) denotes the space of Sobolev isometries, i.e., y \u2208 H2(S;R3) satisfying the pointwise isometry constraint \u2207\u2032y>\u2207\u2032y = I. For y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) we write by := \u22021y \u2227 \u22022y, Ry := (\u22021y, \u22022y, by) and IIy := \u2207\u2032y>\u2207\u2032by. The latter is the negative of the second fundamental form of the surface parametrized by y represented in local coordinates. \u2022 Eh(y) = \u221a (\u2207hy)>\u2207hy\u2212I h denotes the scaled nonlinear strain associated with the deformation\ny \u2208 H1(\u2126;R3).\n\u2022 | \u00b7 | denotes the Euclidean norm on Rd and the Frobenius norm on matrix spaces. For A,B \u2208 Rd\u00d7d, we consdier the scalar product A \u00b7B := tr(A>B).\n\u2022 For A \u2208 R2\u00d72 we denote by \u03b9(A) the 3\u00d73-matrix that is zero except for the upper-left 2\u00d72-block, which is given by A.\n\u2022 For A \u2208 R2\u00d72 the inequality A \u2265 0 has to be understood in the sense of quadratic forms, i.e., Aa \u00b7 a \u2265 |a|2 for all a \u2208 R2."

In particular, these assumptions allow us to linearize the material law at SO(3). The quadratic form in assumption (W3) is given by the Hessian of W at identity, i.e.,\nQ(x3, G) = 1\n2\n\u22022W (x3, I)\n\u2202F\u2202F G \u00b7G.\nAs a consequence of (W1), (W2) and (W3), Q satisfies\n\u2200G \u2208 R3\u00d73 : 1 CW | symG|2 \u2264 Q(x3, G) \u2264 CW | symG|2. (5)\nThe growth condition (W4) is less standard, however, in accordance with physical growth assumptions: it enforces a blow up of the elastic energy for compressions of the material to zero volume and for large changes of area, and excludes (local) interpenetration. From the analytic perspective, we use (W4) in Lemma 4.1 to control the expression F\u22121 \u221a detF , which appears in the formulation of the Oseen-Frank energy, cf. (1)."

            "text": "We establish refined versions of Theorem 2.3, where we take boundary conditions for y and/or n into account. In this section we focus on boundary conditions for y. As it is well-known, cf. [26], not every type of boundary condition for the deformation is compatible with the bending scaling. We therefore restrict our analysis to the natural situation of clamped, affine boundary conditions on \u201cstraight\u201d parts of the lateral boundary \u2202S \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2) of \u2126. For the precise statement we make the following assumption on the boundary data:\nAssumption 2.8 (Boundary conditions for the 2d-model). Consider kBC \u2208 N relatively open, non-empty line segments Li \u2286 \u2202S and a reference isometry yBC \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) such that for i = 1, . . . , kBC (the trace of) \u2207\u2032yBC is constant on Li.

The construction of the recovery sequence on affine regions of y \u2208 ABC is based on a wrinkling ansatz that allows for recovering order-h-stretches in inplane directions. Compressions cannot be realized in this way. However, the nematic-elastic coupling tensor (c.f. (2)) requires to realize compressions of magnitude of the order r\u0304CW . The additional term \u2212h\u03b4\u0304yBC in the 3d-boundary condition (cf. (16) and (18)) allows us to introduce a macroscopic in-plane compression, that, in combination with the wrinkling ansatz, yields a recovery sequence realizing both, order-h-in-plane stretches and the required compressions.\nA crucial ingredient in the construction of recovery sequences with prescribed boundary conditions is the following density argument, which is of independent interest. It applies even to non-convex domains S:\nProposition 2.11 (Density of smooth isometries in ABC). Let S satisfy (89) and let Assumption 2.8 be satisfied. Then\nABC \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3) is dense in (ABC , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H2(S;R3)).\n(See Section 4.8 for the proof.)\nRemark 2.12 (Extension to non-convex S). In this paper, convexity of S is only used for the construction of the recovery sequence (cf. Theorem 2.3 (c) and Theorem 2.9 (b)). With help of [31], the results can be extended to non-convex domains satisfying the regularity condition (89). In fact, we prove Proposition 2.11 already for non-convex S by combining results from [31] with an extension argument. However, for the construction of the recovery sequence we assume convexity of S to keep the arguments less technical and self-contained: Our construction uses a decomposition of the non-flat part {IIy 6= 0} (for smooth y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3)) into connected components. Convexity of S simplifies the geometry of such connected components, cf. proof of Lemma 4.13."

            "text": "In this section we discuss a variety of anchorings for 3d-director fields nh : \u2126top \u2192 S2 and their relation to anchorings for 2d-director fields n : S \u2192 S2. We shall distinguish weak and strong anchoring. In the physics literature, strong anchoring refers to a point-wise condition for nh. Here, we impose them on two-dimensional surfaces of the body, in particular, on parts of the lateral boundary, i.e., on \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 12) for some \u0393n \u2286 \u2202S. On the other hand, weak anchoring is described by an additional term in the energy functional, which assigns positive, but finite energy to deviations of the director from a prescribed behavior. We shall consider both surface and volumetric anchorings, where the anchoring is imposed on two-dimensional and three-dimensional subsets of the body, respectively. From the modeling point of view, it is natural to phrase weak and strong anchorings for the director field in local coordinates, i.e., in the coordinate system spanned by\u2207hyh(x\u2032) where x\u2032 \u2208 \u2126 denotes a material point and yh : \u2126 \u2192 R3 the deformation. Therefore, given a configuration (yh, nh) \u2208 H1(\u2126;R3)\u00d7H1(\u2126top;S2) we consider the transformed field\nn\u0302h(x) := Cof(\u2207hyh(x))\u22121nh(x) |Cof(\u2207hyh(x))\u22121nh(x)| = \u2207hyh(x)>nh(x) |\u2207hyh(x)>nh(x)| .\nWe note that it is not possible to introduce surface anchorings for n\u0302h directly, since, in general, the trace of n\u0302h on two-dimensional surfaces is not well-defined. To overcome this obstacle we consider two types of workaround solutions:\n\u2022 One possibility is to consider only parts of the boundary where clamped, affine boundary conditions for the deformation are assumed. Indeed, if \u0393n is contained in a flat part of \u2202S \u00d7 (0, 12), where (yh) satisfies (16) and has finite bending energy, then we have \u2207hyh = RBC + O(h) close to \u0393n in an L2-sense for some RBC \u2208 SO(3). Thus, the illdefined restriction of n\u0302h to \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 12) might be replaced by the trace of the field R > BCnh,\nand we obtain a strong anchoring condition, which, for instance, takes the form\nR>BCnh = n\u0302BC on \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 1\n2 ) in the sense of traces,\nfor some n\u0302BC \u2208 H1(S; S2). As we shall see, in the limit h \u2192 0 the strong 2d-anchoring condition n\u0302 = n\u0302BC emerges, where n\u0302 = R > y n \u2208 H1(S;S2) denotes the director in local coordinates w.r.t. the isometric immersion y.\n\u2022 Another possibility is to consider volumetric weak anchoring through penalization energies of the form \u02c6\n\u2126top\n|n\u0302h \u2212 n\u0302BC |2\u03c1dx,\nwhere \u03c1 \u2208 L1(\u2126top) denotes a non-negative weight. In the limit h \u2192 0 we recover the weak anchoring \u00b4 S |n\u0302\u2212 n\u0302BC | 2\u03c1\u0304(x\u2032) dx\u2032 where \u03c1\u0304(x\u2032) := \u00b4 1 2 0 \u03c1(x \u2032, x3) dx3.\nAs we shall see, with help of volumetric weak anchoring, we can also justify\n\u2022 weak and strong 2d-anchorings on parts of \u2202S where no conditions on the deformation are imposed (see Lemma 2.17),\n\u2022 weak and strong 2d-anchorings on the mid-surface of the plate (see Lemma 2.14).\nFinally, we remark that we do not only consider anchorings of Dirichlet type (i.e., where the value n\u0302 is fully prescribed), but also conditions or penalizations that enforce tangentiality of the director in the 2d-model, i.e., n \u00b7 by = 0, where y is the 2d-deformation.\nStrong anchoring on clamped boundaries. We first state a result that is a rather direct consequence of Theorem 2.3 and treats general linear strong anchorings phrased for n in global coordinates:\nLemma 2.13 (Clamped, affine boundary conditions and strong anchoring). Let Assumption 2.1 and (3) be satisfied, and let \u0393n \u2286 \u2202S be relatively open. Consider \u03a8BC : \u0393n \u00d7 R3 \u2192 R3, \u03a8BC(x \u2032, n) := m(x\u2032) +M(x\u2032)n with m \u2208 L2(\u0393n;R3) and M \u2208 L2(\u0393n;R3\u00d73).\n(a) (Compactness). Consider a sequence (yh, nh) with equibounded energy in the sense of (7) and assume that\n\u03a8BC(x \u2032, nh(x)) = 0 for a.e. x = (x \u2032, x3) \u2208 \u0393n \u00d7 (\u2212 1 2 , 1 2 ). (19)\nThen in addition to the statements of Theorem 2.3 (a), any limit (y, n) of a subsequence of (yh, nh) satisfies\n\u03a8BC(x \u2032, n(x\u2032)) = 0 for a.e. x\u2032 \u2208 \u0393n. (20)\n(b) (Recovery sequence). Let (y, n) \u2208 A2 satisfy (20). Then there exists a recovery sequence (yh, nh) that satisfies the properties of Theorem 2.3 (c), and additionally (19). Furthermore, if Assumption 2.8 is satisfied and y \u2208 ABC , then the recovery sequence (yh, nh) can be constructed such that it additionally satisfies yh \u2208 ABC,\u03b4\u0304,h with \u03b4\u0304 satisfying (18).\n(See Section 4.6.1 for the proof.)\nWith help of the previous lemma we may treat strong Dirichlet and tangential anchorings: For an illustration, we denote by L \u2286 \u2202S one of the line segments of Assumption 2.8 and consider some relatively open \u0393n \u2286 L. Note that for y \u2208 ABC , we have Ry = RBC on L for a single rotation RBC \u2208 SO(3). For 3d-director fields nh \u2208 H1(\u2126top;S2) and 2d-director fields n \u2208 H1(S;S2) we may consider the following strong anchorings:\n\u2022 (Strong Dirichlet anchoring). Let n\u0302BC : \u0393n \u2192 S2 be given (and admissible in the sense that it is the trace of some director field in H1(S; S2)). Consider\n\u03a8BC(x \u2032, n) := R>BC(x \u2032)n\u2212 n\u0302BC(x\u2032). (21)\nThen Lemma 2.13 shows that the strong 3d-anchoring condition R>BCnh = n\u0302BC on \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 12) leads to the 2d-anchoring condition R > BCn = n\u0302BC on \u0393n.\n\u2022 (Strong tangential anchoring). Let \u03bdS denote the (constant) outer unit normal to S on \u0393n. Consider\n\u03a8BC(x \u2032, n) := ( R>BC(x \u2032)n \u00b7 (\u03bdS , 0) ) e1. (22)\nThen Lemma 2.13 shows that the strong 3d-anchoring condition R>BCnh \u22a5 (\u03bdS , 0) on \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 12) leads to the 2d-anchoring condition R > BCn \u22a5 (\u03bdS , 0) on \u0393n.\nVolumetric anchoring. In this paragraph, we derive 2d-weak and strong anchorings imposed on the mid-surface starting with weak 3d-volumetric anchorings in the form of weighted integrals. To that end let \u03c1 \u2208 L1(\u2126top) be a non-negative weight and set \u03c1\u0304(x\u2032) := \u00b4 1 2 0 \u03c1(x\n\u2032, x3) dx3. Furthermore, we consider n\u03020, \u03bd\u0302 \u2208 L2(S;S2) for describing preferred orientations of the director on the mid-surface. We introduce functionals Gh,Hh : L2(\u2126;R3)\u00d7L2(\u2126top;R3)\u2192 [0,\u221e] defined for (yh, nh) \u2208 H1(\u2126;R3)\u00d7H1(\u2126top;S2) with det\u2207hyh > 0 a.e. in \u2126 by\nGh(yh, nh) := \u02c6\n\u2126top \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2207hy>h nh|\u2207hy>h nh| \u2212 n\u03020 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03c1dx, Hh(yh, nh) := \u02c6 \u2126top \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2207hy>h nh|\u2207hy>h nh| \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03c1 dx,\nand Gh(yh, nh) := Hh(yh, nh) := +\u221e otherwise. To express the corresponding 2d-anchorings, we introduce the functionals Gweak/strong,Hweak/strong : L2(S;R3) \u00d7 L2(S;R3) \u2192 [0,\u221e] defined by\nGweak(y, n) :=\n{\u00b4 S |R > y n\u2212 n\u03020|2\u03c1\u0304 dx\u2032 if (y, n) \u2208 A2,\n+\u221e else,\nGstrong(y, n) := { 0 if (y, n) \u2208 A2 and (R>y n\u2212 n\u03020)\u03c1\u0304 = 0 a.e. in S, +\u221e else,\nHweak(y, n) :=\n{\u00b4 S |(R > y n) \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302|2\u03c1\u0304dx\u2032 if (y, n) \u2208 A2,\n+\u221e else,\nHstrong(y, n) := { 0 if (y, n) \u2208 A2 and (R>y n \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302)\u03c1\u0304 = 0 a.e. in S, +\u221e else.\nLemma 2.14 (Derivation of anchorings on the mid-surface).\n(a) The statements of Theorem 2.3 hold with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh + Gh, E + Gweak). They also hold with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh +Hh, E +Hweak).\n(b) Let 0 < \u03b2 < 1. Then the statements of Theorem 2.3 hold with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh + h\u2212\u03b2Gh, E + Gstrong). They also hold with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh + h\u2212\u03b2Hh, E + Hstrong).\n(See Section 4.6.1 for the proof.)\nIn the special case \u03c1 := 2\u03c3 and \u03bd\u0302 := e3, we obtain by Lemma 2.14 (a) the 2d-energy\n(y, n) 7\u2192 E(y, n) + 1 \u03c3 \u02c6 S |n \u00b7 by|2 dx\u2032,\nwhich features a weak anchoring term that penalizes non-tangentiality of n. Likewise Lemma 2.14 (b) leads to the point-wise, tangentiallity constraint\nn \u00b7 by = 0 a.e. in S.\nAnchoring on lateral boundaries \u0393n \u2286 \u2202S. Next, we justify weak and strong 2d-anchorings imposed on boundary segments \u0393n \u2286 \u2202S. In contrast to Lemma 2.13, here, anchorings for the director in local coordinates are treated. To simplify the analysis, we make the following assumption:\n\u0393n \u2286 \u2202S is relatively open with finitely many connected components, and the closure \u0393n is contained in a one-dimensional C 2-submanifold of R2. (23)\nAs mentioned before, it is not possible to directly consider anchorings for the director in local coordinates on a 2d-surface \u0393n \u00d7 (0, 12). We therefore introduce the set\n\u0393\u03c3n := {\u03be\u2032 \u2212 s \u03bdS(\u03be\u2032) : \u03be\u2032 \u2208 \u0393n, 0 < s < \u03c3 },\nwhere \u03bdS is the outer unit normal to S. Note that \u0393 \u03c3 n is a thin \u201cboundary strip\u201d that intersects S, and that for \u03c3 \u2192 0 \u201capproximates\u201d the boundary segment \u0393n. We shall consider weak volumetric anchoring energies on (S \u2229 \u0393\u03c3n) \u00d7 (0, 12). To formulate these, we need to extend the given boundary director field n\u0302BC : \u0393n \u2192 S2 to the strip \u0393\u03c3n. We consider the following canonical extension that extends to a field that is constant along fibers orthogonal to \u0393n:\nLemma 2.15 (Canonical extension). Let S \u2286 R2 be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Assume (23). Then there exists \u03c3\u0304 > 0 (only depending on \u0393n and S) such that for all g \u2208 L2(\u0393n;S2), the identity\n(Eg)(x\u2032 \u2212 s\u03bdS(x\u2032)) := g(x\u2032) for a.e. x\u2032 \u2208 \u0393n and s \u2208 (0, \u03c3\u0304)\ndefines a unique function Eg \u2208 L2(\u0393\u03c3\u0304n;S2). We call Eg the canonical extension of g.\n(See Section 4.6.2 for the proof.)\nWe are now in the position to introduce the functionals that model the volumetric weak anchorings: For given data n\u0302BC , \u03bd\u0302 \u2208 L2(\u0393n; S2) and \u03c3 > 0 we consider G\u03c3h ,H\u03c3h : L2(\u2126;R3) \u00d7 L2(\u2126top;R3)\u2192 [0,\u221e] defined for (yh, nh) \u2208 H1(\u2126;R3)\u00d7H1(\u2126top;S2) with det\u2207hyh > 0 a.e. in \u2126 by\nG\u03c3h (yh, nh) := 2\n\u03c3 \u02c6 (S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n)\u00d7(0, 12 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2207hy>h nh|\u2207hy>h nh| \u2212 En\u0302BC \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 dx,\nH\u03c3h(yh, nh) := 2\n\u03c3 \u02c6 (S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n)\u00d7(0, 12 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2207hy>h nh|\u2207hy>h nh| \u00b7 E\u03bd\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 dx,\nand G\u03c3h (yh, nh) := H\u03c3h(yh, nh) := +\u221e otherwise. Above, En\u0302BC and E\u03bd\u0302 denote the canonical extension of n\u0302BC and \u03bd\u0302. By appealing to Lemma 2.14 (a), for \u03c3 > 0 fixed, we shall obtain weak 2d-anchoring energies on the boundary strip (S \u2229 \u0393\u03c3n). The limiting anchorings are given by the functionals G\u03c3,H\u03c3 : L2(S;R3)\u00d7 L2(S;R3)\u2192 [0,\u221e] defined for (y, n) \u2208 A2 by\nG\u03c3(y, n) := 1 \u03c3 \u02c6 (S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n) |R>y n\u2212 En\u0302BC |2 dx\u2032, H\u03c3(y, n) := 1 \u03c3 \u02c6 (S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n) |R>y n \u00b7 E\u03bd\u0302|2 dx\u2032,\nand +\u221e otherwise.\nCorollary 2.16. Assume (23). Then for all scaling parameters \u03b2 \u2265 0 and \u03c3 \u2208 (0, \u03c3\u0304) (where \u03c3\u0304 > 0 only depends on \u0393n and S), the statements of Theorem 2.3 hold with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3h , E + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3) and also with (Eh, E) being replaced by (Eh + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2H\u03c3h, E + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2H\u03c3).\nThe proof directly follows from Lemma 2.15 and Lemma 2.14 (a) and is thus left to the reader. In a second step, we argue that a subsequent \u0393-limit for \u03c3 \u2192 0 yields weak and strong anchorings on \u0393n. To describe the latter, we introduce the functionals Gweak/strong,\u0393n ,Hweak/strong,\u0393n : L2(S;R3)\u00d7 L2(S;R3)\u2192 [0,\u221e],\nGweak,\u0393n(y, n) :=\n{\u00b4 \u0393n |R>y n\u2212 n\u0302BC |2 dH1 if (y, n) \u2208 A2,\n+\u221e else,\nGstrong,\u0393n(y, n) := { 0 if (y, n) \u2208 A2 and R>y n = n\u0302BC a.e. on \u0393n, +\u221e else,\nHweak,\u0393n(y, n) :=\n{\u00b4 S |(R > y n) \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302|2 dH1 if (y, n) \u2208 A2,\n+\u221e else,\nHstrong,\u0393n(y, n) := { 0 if (y, n) \u2208 A2 and R>y n \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302 = 0 a.e. on \u0393n, +\u221e else.\nLemma 2.17. Let S \u2286 R2 be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Assume (23). Then the following holds:\n(a) Let \u03b2 = 0. As \u03c3 \u2192 0 the functionals E + G\u03c3 and E + H\u03c3 \u0393-converge (w.r.t. strong convergence in L2(S)) to the functionals E + Gweak,\u0393n and E +Hweak,\u0393n, respectively.\n(b) Let 0 < \u03b2 < 12 . As \u03c3 \u2192 0 the functionals E + \u03c3 \u2212\u03b2G\u03c3 and E + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2H\u03c3 \u0393-converge\n(w.r.t. strong convergence in L2(S)) to the functionals E + Gstrong,\u0393n and E +Hstrong,\u0393n, respectively.\n(See Section 4.6.2 for the proof.)\nRemark 2.18 (Relation to simulations of Section 3). The results of this and the previous section explain how 2d-boundary conditions for the deformation and the director field emerge from 3d-models. Let us anticipate that in Section 3 we present numerical experiments for 2d-models with different types of boundary conditions. In this remark we comment on their derivation from 3d-models.\n(a) In Example 3.2 a 2d-model is considered with S := (\u22125, 5)\u00d7 (\u22121, 1), subject to boundary conditions on L1 = {\u22125} \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] and L2 = {5} \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] for the 2d-deformation, its gradient and the director. Furthermore, tangentiality of n is enforced. The situation can be described by the 2d-energy (E + Hstrong), where Hstrong enforces the tangentiality of n and is defined with \u03c1\u0304 := 1 and n\u0302 := e3. The clamped, affine boundary conditions for y on L1 \u222a L2 can be encoded by a suitable choice of ABC , while the strong anchoring conditions of n take the form of the pointwise constraint (20) with \u03a8BC as in (21). This situation can be derived as a \u0393-limit from a 3d-model of the form (Eh + h\u2212\u03b2Hh)(yh, nh) (c.f. Lemma 2.14 (b)) subject to the clamped, affine boundary condition yh \u2208 ABC,\u03b4\u0304,h and the pointwise constraint \u03a8BC(x \u2032, nh(x)) = 0 on (L1 \u222a L2)\u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2) for the director field.\nThe passage to 2d then follows by combining Theorem 2.9, Lemma 2.13 and a variant of Lemma 2.14. Indeed, one can check that Lemma 2.14 (b) extends to the case where additional boundary conditions for the deformation and strong anchorings for the director field are considered.\n(b) In Example 3.1, the deformation and its gradient, as well as the director, are fixed on a common boundary segment. This situation arises as a \u0393-limit via directly combining Theorem 2.3 (b), Theorem 2.9 and Lemma 2.13 with \u03a8BC as in (21).\n(c) In Example 3.3 boundary conditions are only prescribed for the 2d-director (in local coordinates). This setting is motivated by the \u0393-limits of Corollary 2.16 and Lemma 2.17 (b)."

            "text": "In this section, we explain the derivation of the scaled and non-dimensionalized energy Eh defined in (1). In the following, variables with a physical dimension are underlined, e.g, we write x for the position vector with physical dimensions and x for the position vector in non-dimensionalized form. We consider a plate with reference domain \u2126 := S \u00d7 (\u2212h/2, h/2), mid-surface S \u2286 R2, thickness h, top layer \u2126top := S \u00d7 (0, h/2), bottom layer \u2126bot := S \u00d7 (\u2212h/2, 0), and the energy functional E(y, n) := \u02c6\n\u2126bot\nW ( x3,\u2207 y ) dx+ \u02c6 \u2126top W ( x3, L(n) \u2212 1 2 y ) dx+ \u03ba \u02c6 \u2126top |\u2207n(\u2207y)\u22121|2 det(\u2207y) dx,\n(24) where y : \u2126\u2192 R3 denotes the deformation of the plate and n : \u2126top \u2192 S2 the LC orientation in the top layer. The first two integrals are the elastic energy stored in the deformed body with a\nmaterial law described by the stored energy function W . The third integral is the one-constant approximation of the Oseen-Frank energy (cf. [22, 38, 60]), which penalizes spatial variations of n. It invokes as a material parameter the Frank elasticity constant \u03ba and is originally formulated as \u03ba\n\u00b4 y(\u2126top)\n|\u2207n\u0303|2 dx for the director field n\u0303 := n \u25e6 y\u22121 defined on the deformed configuration y(\u2126top). The third integral in (24) is then obtained by (formally) pulling back the director field to the reference configuration. The second integral in (24) invokes the step-length tensor L(n) := r\u2212 1 3 (I + (r\u2212 1)n\u2297n), which has been introduced in [17, 60] to model the nematic-elastic coupling of LCEs. Here, r > 0 is an order-parameter. The product L(n)\u2212 1 2\u2207y can be understood in view of the multiplicative\ndecomposition \u2207y = \u221a L(n)Felast of the deformation gradient into a \u201cpoststrain\u201d \u221a L(n) and an elastic part Felast. The elastic stress tensor only depends on the latter. We note that for r > 1, \u221a L(n) describes stretching by a factor r 1 3 in directions parallel to n and a contraction by a factor r\u2212 1 6 in directions perpendicular to n. The case r = 1 refers to the isotropic case, i.e., when the nematic-elastic coupling is absent.\nIn order to non-dimensionalize the energy, we introduce a reference length scale ` and denote by p a pressure scale. We then introduce the non-dimensional and scaled quantities\nS := `\u22121S, h := `\u22121h, x := `\u22121(x\u2032, h\u22121x3),\nyh(x) := ` \u22121y(`x\u2032, `hx3), nh(x) := n(`x \u2032, `hx3), W (x3, F ) := p \u22121W (`hx3, F ).\nWe observe that 1\np`3h3 E(y, n) = Eh(yh, nh),\nwhere Eh (as defined in (1)) invokes the non-dimensional and scaled parameters\n\u03b5\u03042 := \u03ba\np`2h2 and r\u0304 := r \u2212 1 h .\nFor homogeneous and isotropic materials, a typical choice for p is the shear modulus \u00b5 of W . For this choice, the quadratic term Q in the expansion of W at I3\u00d73 (cf. (W3)) satisfies (15) with parameters \u00b5 = 1 and \u03bb = \u03bb\u00b5 , where \u00b5 and \u03bb are the physical Lame\u0301-parameters.\nFurthermore, \u03b5\u0304 is precisely the ratio between the length scale \u221a \u03ba p and the thickness of the plate\nh = hl. With the choice p := \u00b5, the length scale \u221a \u03ba p is typically in the range 10 \u22129\u201310\u22127m (e.g., see [57, 60]), and thus \u03b5\u0304 is typically rather small \u2013 yet values, of the order 10\u22123\u201310\u22121 might be realistic, e.g., see [29] for composites with nano-sized nematic LCE grains, and see [50] for elastomers with \u00b5 being in the range of 103\u2013105Pa. Let us anticipate that in some of the numerical simulations in Section 3 we set \u03b5\u0304 = 1 (or even larger) to pronounce the effect of the coupling with the surface Oseen-Frank energy. In particular, with r\u0304 = 5, \u03b5\u0304 = 1, S = (\u22121, 1)2,\u221a \u03ba p \u223c 10 \u22127m, and the choice ` = 10\u22124m, we obtain h = 10\u22124 and r = 1 + hr\u0304 = 1.0005. In comparison, if we consider a plate with physical thickness h \u223c 10\u22125m (as in [53]) and diameter ` \u223c 10\u22124m, we arrive at \u03b5 = 10\u22122, h = 10\u22121 and r = 1.5."

The space S2(Th) serves as an H2-conforming approximation space for gradients of discrete deformations from SDKT(Th;R3) via the construction of a discrete gradient operator\n\u0398h : SDKT(Th)\u2192 S2(Th;R2)\nas follows. First, we note that the degrees of freedom in SDKT are the function values and gradients at the nodes of the triangulation whereas the degrees of freedom in S2(Th) are the function values at the nodes and midpoints of element sides. Denoting with z1E , z 2 E \u2208 Nh the endpoints and with zE = (1/2)(z 1 E + z 2 E) the midpoint of a given side E \u2208 Sh, and choosing normal and tangent vectors \u03c4E and \u03bdE for every side E \u2208 Sh such that |\u03c4E | = |\u03bdE | = 1, we define the unique discrete gradient field \u0398hyh \u2208 S2(Th;R2) of a function yh \u2208 SDKT(Th) via conditions\n(\u0398hyh)(z) = \u2207yh(z), (\u0398hyh)(zE) \u00b7 \u03c4E = \u2207yh(zE) \u00b7 \u03c4E , (\u0398hyh)(zE) \u00b7 \u03bdE = 1\n2\n( \u2207yh(z1E) +\u2207yh(z2E) ) \u00b7 \u03bdE ,\nfor all z \u2208 Nh and all E \u2208 Sh. The definition of the discrete gradient is extended to vector fields yh \u2208 SDKT(Th;R3) by applying \u0398h to each component of yh. Approximation properties of \u0398h show that the discrete gradient defines an interpolation operator on the space of derivatives of functions in H3(S), see Chapter 8.2 of [9]. In the continuous setting the director field n takes values in the sphere S2 and the deformation y is an isometry in H2iso(S;R3). In the discrete setting we impose the unit-length constraint as well as the isometry constraint up to a tolerance \u03b6h > 0 in the nodes of the triangulation, i. e. we consider the discrete admissible sets\nAn,h := { nh \u2208 S1(Th;R3) : nh(z) = nBC(z) for all z \u2208 Nh \u2229 \u0393n, |nh(z)\u2212 1| \u2264 \u03b6h for all z \u2208 Nh } and, assuming that \u03a6BC = \u2207yBC \u2208 C(\u0393y;R3\u00d72) with yBC as in Assumption 2.8,\nAy,h := { yh \u2208 SDKT(Th;R3) : yh(z) = yBC(z), \u2207yh(z) = \u03a6BC(z) for all z \u2208 Nh \u2229 \u0393y,\u2223\u2223\u2223(\u2207yh(z))>\u2207yh(z)\u2212 I\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03b6h for all z \u2208 Nh}.\nWe use the shorthand notations \u2206h := div \u0398h for the divergence of the discrete gradient and bh(z) := \u22021yh(z)\u2227\u22022yh(z) for the nodal (almost-)unit normal and denote with Ih the interpolant operator into element-wise linear functions.

Its stability as well as the convergence of the discretization are currently a work in progress and will be presented in a follow-up paper. In the following we denote with (y\u221eh , n \u221e h ) the numerical\nequilibrium state obtained from the discrete gradient flow. Since in general, we do not know analytical minimizers nor their minimal energies we use the experimental order of convergence,\nEOCEh := log2 ( |E4h(y\u221e4h , n\u221e4h)\u2212 E2h(y\u221e2h , n\u221e2h)| |E2h(y\u221e2h , n\u221e2h)\u2212 Eh(y\u221eh , n\u221eh )| ) ,\nas an approximate measure of the convergence rate for the discrete energies.

Finally, we denote with\nEh,OF := \u03b5\u03042\n2 \u02c6 S |\u2207n\u221eh |2dx\nthe Oseen-Frank energy of the numerical equilibrium configurations and, occasionally, use the shorthand notation Eh := Eh(y\u221eh , n\u221eh ) for the corresponding total energy. The surface coloring in the following plots always corresponds to the potential of the Oseen-Frank energy. Note that the relaxation of the constraints that results from the linearization in the discrete gradient flow effectively enlarges the admissible sets. This may lead to discrete minimizers with lower energies compared to minimizers that one would obtain if \u03b6h = 0, i. e. if the nodal constraints were satisfied exactly. The experimental data supports the hypothesis that constraint violation is controlled by the time step size which we usually choose proportional to the mesh size. As a consequence in practice, the admissible sets An,h/2, Ay,h/2 that correspond to a triangulation Th/2 after one red-refinement of a mesh are, in general, no subsets of the admissible sets An,h, Ay,h that correspond to the unrefined triangulation Th. This contributes to the reasons why the observed experimental convergence orders that we observe in the following are not always consistent. Another reason lies in the fact that asymptotic ranges might not be reached due to our limited computational resources: all computations were performed on a standard Intel\u00ae CoreTM i3-3240 CPU @ 3.40GHz\u00d7 4 desktop computer. As a final remark before presenting the experiments, we note that in the examples the choice of required parameters is motivated by realistic materials, but adjusted to emphasize the interaction mechanisms of our model, cf. Section 2.5. An extensive research on what materials are technically possible lies beyond the scope of this work.\nExample 3.1 (Horizontally clamped plate). In this first example we let \u00b5 = 1, \u03bb = 1000 and consider model parameters r\u0304, \u03b5\u0304 \u2208 {1, 5}. These choices pronounce characteristic model traits. Taking into account the considerations in Section 2.5, we also perform the calculations for r\u0304 = 1, \u03b5\u0304 = 0.01. We consider the two-dimensional reference configuration S = (\u22121, 1) \u00d7 (\u22121, 1) with Dirichlet boundary \u0393 = \u0393y = \u0393n = {\u22121} \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]. We prescribe clamped, affine boundary conditions,\nyBC(x) = (x, 0) >, \u03a6BC = (I, 0) >,\nfor the deformation y and one of two different strong Dirichlet anchorings,\nnxBC = (1, 0, 0) >, or nyBC = (0, 1, 0) >,\nfor the director n. For triangulations Th = Tk, k = 3, 4, 5, 6, of S into halved squares with side lengths h\u0302 = 2\u2212k we compute approximations of stationary points of the energy (25) using the alternating discrete gradient flow Algorithm 3.1 with stopping criterion \u03b5stop = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123. Initial values are chosen as the flat deformation y0h(x) = (x1, x2, 0) and, depending on the anchoring, n0h \u2261 nxBC or n0h \u2261 n y BC. The finest triangulation T6 consists of 32\u2019768 triangles and corresponding discrete deformations and director fields are determined by 149\u2019769 and 49\u2019923 degrees of freedom, respectively. For each triangulation we choose the (pseudo-) time step size \u03c4 = h\u0302/10. An exception to this choice of step size are the settings r\u0304 = 1, \u03b5\u0304 = 0.01, where lower energies and constraint violations justify large step sizes \u03c4\u0303 = 4h\u0302 to avoid unnecessary high iteration numbers. The resulting deformations for k = 6 are depicted in Figure 3. Iteration numbers, final energies, constraint violations and experimental convergence rates are listed in Tables 1a and 1b for strong anchorings nxBC and n y BC, respectively. Notably, with the anchoring nyBC, the experimental order of convergence of the discrete energies is negative in many cases. This might be a consequence of relaxing of the node-wise unit-length and isometry constraints, as well as it might indicate that the asymptotic range has not been reached in terms of grid size. Violations of the point-wise unit-length and isometry constraints appear to decay linearly with respect to \u03c4 \u223c h.\nExample 3.2 (Compressive boundary conditions and strong tangential anchoring). We let \u00b5 = 1, \u03bb = 1000 and r\u0304 = 4. This example investigates stationary configurations of a rectangular strip with reference configuration S = (\u22125, 5)\u00d7 (\u22121, 1) subject to compressive clamped, affine boundary conditions\nyBC(x) = (\u03b1x1, x2, 0) >, \u03a6BC = (I, 0) >,\nwith compression factor 0 < \u03b1 < 1 and \u03b5\u0304 \u2208 {1, 4} on \u0393y = {\u22125, 5} \u00d7 [\u22121, 1]. Throughout the domain we restrict the director to tangential directions via imposing the additional (nodewise) strong tangential anchoring constraint (\u22021y \u2227 \u22022y) \u00b7 n = 0, cf. Remark 2.18(a). The compression forces the plate to buckle up or buckle down, leading to stationary configurations with different local energy minima. We consider a triangulation of S into 10\u2019240 halved squares of side-length h\u0302 = 2\u22124 and use the step size \u03c4 = h\u0302/4 in the discrete gradient flow, leading to approximate stationary configurations with deformations and director fields determined by 47\u2019817 and 15\u2019939 degrees of freedom, respectively. The stopping criterion \u03b5stop = 2\u00d7 10\u22123 was reached after a few thousand iterations in all cases and the largest observed constraint violations were Err1(n \u221e h ) = 0.0565892 and Erriso(y \u221e h ) = 0.0185882, both of which were observed in the most \u201cextreme\u201d setting corresponding to \u03b5\u0304 = 4 and \u03b1 \u2248 0.637. In most considered cases the constraint violations were smaller by at least one order of magnitude. We use corresponding initial values y0h in the discrete gradient flow to steer the evolution towards one of the stationary configurations and observe that strong Dirichlet anchoring on \u0393n = \u0393y, namely\nnxBC = (1, 0, 0) > (\u201cperpendicular\u201d), or nyBC = (0, 1, 0) > (\u201ctangential\u201d),\ncan be used to render either deformation \u2013 \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d \u2013 more preferable energy wise. Experimental results are collected in Table 2. Figure 4 shows the stationary configurations approximating local minima of the energy for \u03b1 = 3\u03c0\u22121 sin(\u03c0/3) \u2248 0.827 and both choices of strong Dirichlet anchorings. Strong Dirichlet anchorings may or may not influence energy response to varying compression factors \u03b1, see Figure 5 where we compare the total energies of the equilibrium states for three different compression factors. With certain combinations of coupling and order parameters r\u0304 and \u03b5\u0304 Dirichlet anchorings can be used to select between a notable energy response or almost no response to compression. This is illustrated in Figure 5b for r\u0304 = 4, \u03b5\u0304 = 4, where a director anchored perpendicularly to the clamped boundary corresponds to a significant energy response\nwhereas the energy for all three compression factors stays almost the same in the case of a tangentially anchored director. Higher Oseen-Frank energies play an important role in increasing the energy response when using perpendicular anchoring, see Table 2. In this experiment initial configurations in the discrete gradient flow were chosen as interpolants of a continuous deformation consisting of four circular arcs, each of arc length 2.5, glued together. The three considered compression factors of approximately 0.637, 0.827 and 0.900 correspond to circular arcs with central angles \u03c0/2, \u03c0/3 and \u03c0/4.\nExample 3.3 (Strong circular director anchoring). We let \u00b5 = 1, \u03bb = 1000 and use parameters r\u0304 = 4, \u03b5\u0304 = 0.5. For cut-out regions\nK1 := \u2205, K2 := [1, 4]2, K3 := [2, 3]2, K4 := [2, 3]\u00d7 [1, 4],\nwe consider the two-dimensional reference configurations Sj := (0, 5) 2\\Kj with Dirichlet boundary \u0393y = \u2205, \u0393n = {0, 5} \u00d7 [0, 5] \u222a [0, 5] \u00d7 {0, 5}. There are no clamped boundary conditions in this example. Instead, we fix a reference frame by prescribing values for y and \u2207y at only one vertex, thereby guaranteeing well-definition of the descent steps for y in the discrete gradient flow. With the center of the domain m\u2126 = (2.5, 2.5) >, we use strong Dirichlet anchoring\nn\u0302BC(x) = |x\u2212m\u2126|\u22121(\u2212x2 + 2.5, x1 \u2212 2.5, 0)>\nfor the director n\u0302 = R>y n in local coordinates. For triangulations T jh = T j k , k = 1, 2, 3, 4, of Sj into halved squares with side lengths h\u0302 = 2\n\u2212k we compute approximations of stationary points of the energy (25) using the alternating discrete gradient flow Algorithm 3.1 with stopping criterion \u03b5stop = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123. As initial values we use y0h(x) = (x, 0)\n> for the deformation and a smooth extension of n\u0302BC to \u2126\\Bh\u0302(0) for the director, and set n0h(0) = (0, 0, 1)\n> for the domain S1. The finest triangulations T j4 consist of at most 12\u2019800 triangles and corresponding discrete deformations and director fields are determined by 59\u2019049 and 19\u2019683 degrees of freedom, respectively. For each triangulation we choose the (pseudo-) time step size \u03c4 = h\u0302/2. Resulting deformations and director field configurations together with their final energies are illustrated in Figure 6. The resulting iteration numbers,\nfinal energies, constraint violations and experimental convergence rates are listed in Table 3. The largest deformation is developed for the largest cut-out region K2. In this setting a significantly higher number of iterations was needed in the discrete gradient flow to reach the approximate equilibrium state than in the other settings. As in Example 3.1 we observe that the violations of both the nodal unit-length and isometry constraint seem to be bounded linearly in terms of the step size."

            "text": "In the simulations the delicate interplay of competing energy contributions in the LCE bilayer model results in rich, non-trivial deformations. Our experiments confirm that the bending and buckling behavior of an LCE plate can be influenced, or even controlled, in a multitude of ways. Depending on model parameters, anchorings and boundary conditions, either the OseenFrank term that corresponds to crystalline order, or the elastic and residual stress terms that correspond to coupling effects, play a dominant role in the energy minimization. Interesting effects can occur when transitioning from dominant crystalline order to dominant coupling in the energy landscape or vice versa, cf. the case r\u0304 = 5, \u03b5\u0304 = 1 in Figure 3. Bearing in mind possible engineering applications, values of \u03b5\u0304 \u223c 1 correspond to plates with a physical thickness in the range of 1nm \u2013 100nm, cf. Section 2.5. In theory one could compensate for a greater plate thickness by employing soft materials with very low shear modulus values. High Oseen-\nFrank energies can, of course, also result from certain anchoring conditions. The softening and hardening of a strip with respect to compression in Example 3.2 is closely related to such effects. In that example the buckling behavior after compression is influenced by the respective anchorings, that either allow for almost perfect director alignment, i. e., practically negligible Oseen-Frank energies, or yield Oseen-Frank energies that are equal to approximately half of the total energy. In the latter case, the effect that comes into play is an incompatibility of the strong anchoring conditions on the Dirichlet boundary and mid-surface with the enforced buckling deformation that results from compressive boundary conditions."

Let Assumption 2.1 be satisfied and let S be bounded and open. Consider a sequence (yh, nh) with finite energy in the sense of (7). Let 1 < p < 2 be defined by the identity qW = 4 p 2\u2212p .

For convenience we introduce the shorthand notation\nBh(x) := { Bh(nh(x)) if x \u2208 \u2126top, 0 else,\n(31)\nand note that there exists a constant C = C(r\u0304) > 0 such that for all 0 < h \u2264 1C ,\n|Bh| \u2264 C and |det(I + hBh)\u2212 1|+ |(I + hBh)\u22121 \u2212 I| \u2264 min{12 , Ch}. (32)\nIn view of (7) we have Eh(yh, nh) < \u221e for all 0 < h \u2264 h\u0304 and some h\u0304 > 0. In the rest of the proof we assume that Ch\u0304|r\u0304| \u2264 1 and 0 < h \u2264 h\u0304.\nStep 1 \u2013 Proof of (26).\nFrom (7), (4), and (W2), we conclude that\nlim sup h\u21920\n1\nh2 \u02c6 \u2126 dist2((I + hBh)\u2207hyh,SO(3)) <\u221e,\nand thus, (26) follows with help of (32) and triangle\u2019s inequality.\nStep 2 \u2013 Proof of (27) \u2013 (30). We start with the argument for (30) by noting that det(\u2207hyh) = det((I + hBh)\u22121) det ( (I +\nhBh)\u2207hyh ) . The first factor on the right-hand side is positive by (32), while the second factor is positive thanks to Eh(yh, nh) < \u221e and the growth condition (W4). Hence, (30) follows. In view of the latter, (28) directly follows from (7). To see (27), we note that (32) yields |\u2207hyh| \u2264 3|(I+hBh)\u2207hyh| and |det(\u2207hyh)|\u22121 \u2264 2| det ( (I+hBh)\u2207hyh ) |\u22121, which together with (W4) implies\n\u02c6 \u2126top |\u2207hyh|qW + | det(\u2207hyh)|\u2212 qW 2 \u2264 C(qW , CW ) \u02c6 \u2126top ( W (x3, (I + hBh)\u2207hyh) + 1 ) ,\nwhere C(qW , CW ) > 0 only depends on qW and CW . Hence, (27) follows, since the right-hand side is controlled by 1 + h2E(yh, nh).\nFinally, from |\u2207hnh| \u2264 det(\u2207hyh) 1 2 |\u2207hnh(\u2207hyh)\u22121| |\u2207hyh| det(\u2207hyh)\u2212 1 2 , and a triple Ho\u0308lder\u2019s inequality, we get(\u02c6 \u2126top |\u2207hnh|p ) 1 p \u2264 (\u02c6 \u2126top |\u2207hnh(\u2207hyh)\u22121|2| det(\u2207hyh)| ) 1 2\n\u00d7 (\u02c6 \u2126top |\u2207hyh|qW ) 1 qW (\u02c6 \u2126top | det(\u2207hyh)|\u2212 qW 2 ) 1 qW .\nHence, (29) follow from (27) and (28).\nNext, we recall the celebrated compactness result for sequences with finite bending energies:\nLemma 4.2 ([26, Theorem 4.1]). Let S \u2286 R2 be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let (yh) be a sequence in H1(\u2126;R3) with finite bending energy in the sense of (26). Then there exist y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3), M \u2208 L2(S;R2\u00d72sym), and d \u2208 L2(\u2126;R3), such that for a subsequence (not relabeled) we have\n\u2207hyh \u2192 Ry strongly in L2(\u2126;R3\u00d73), (33) Eh(yh) \u21c0 \u03b9(x3IIy +M) + sym(d\u2297 e3) weakly in L2(\u2126;R3\u00d73sym), (34)\nwhere we recall the definition Eh(yh) :=\n\u221a (\u2207hyh)>\u2207hyh\u2212I\nh of the nonlinear strain.\nWe note that (34) is not explicitly stated in [26]; yet, it can be established along the lines of the proof of [26, Theorem 7.1]. Statement (34) is also a direct consequence of the two-scale compactness result for the nonlinear strain [30, Proposition 3.2].\nProof of Theorem 2.3 (a). Step 1 \u2013 Argument for (8), (9), (10) and y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3). Statement (8) and y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) directly follow from Lemma 4.2, which we may apply thanks to (26). Moreover, thanks to (29) and the unit-length constraint, (nh) is bounded in W 1,p(\u2126top;R3). Thus, there exists n \u2208 W 1,p(\u2126top;R3) such that nh \u21c0 n weakly in W 1,p(\u2126top) for a subsequence. By compact embedding W 1,p(\u2126top;R3) \u2286 L1(\u2126top;R3) we have nh \u2192 n a.e. (for a subsequence), and thus n \u2208 S2 a.e. in \u2126top. Dominated convergence yields (9). By (29) we obtain (10) (after possibly passing to a further subsequence). Moreover, from 1h\u22023nh \u21c0 d weakly in Lp(\u2126top), we deduce that \u22023nh \u2192 0 strongly in Lp(\u2126top). Hence, \u22023n = 0 and we can identify n with a function n \u2208W 1,p(S;R3).\nStep 2 \u2013 Proof of (\u2207\u2032n, d) \u2208 L2(\u2126top;R3\u00d73). The claimed integrability is a consequence of the following observation: Consider sequences (Gh), (Fh) such that Gh \u21c0 G weakly in L\np(\u2126top;R3\u00d73), and Fh \u2192 R strongly in L2(\u2126top;R3\u00d73). Suppose that a.e. in \u2126 we have detFh > 0 and R \u2208 SO(3). Then,\u02c6\n\u2126top\n|G|2 \u2264 lim inf h\u21920 \u02c6 \u2126top |GhF\u22121h | 2 det(Fh) dx. (35)\nBefore we present the argument, we note that an application of (35) with Gh := \u2207hnh, G = (\u2207\u2032n, d), Fh := \u2207hyh, R = Ry, combined with (28) (to bound the right-hand side of (35)) yields (\u2207\u2032n, d) \u2208 L2(\u2126top;R3\u00d73). For the proof of (35) consider the map\n\u03a6 : R3\u00d73 \u2192 R3\u00d73, \u03a6(F ) :=\n{ F\u22121 \u221a\ndetF if dist(F,SO(3)) \u2264 12 , 0 else,\nand note that \u03a6 is measurable and bounded, i.e., C\u03a6 := supF\u2208R3\u00d73 |\u03a6(F )| < \u221e. We may pass to a subsequence such that Fh \u2192 R a.e. in \u2126top. Since \u03a6 is continuous in an open neighborhood of SO(3), and since R \u2208 SO(3) a.e., we conclude that \u03a6(Fh)\u2192 \u03a6(R) = R> a.e. Together with the bound |\u03a6(Fh)| \u2264 C\u03a6, we conclude that Gh\u03a6(Fh) \u21c0 GR> weakly in Lp(\u2126top), and thus, by the weak lower semicontinuity of convex integral functionals, we have\n\u02c6 \u2126top |GR>|2 \u2264 lim inf h\u21920 \u02c6 \u2126top |Gh\u03a6(Fh)|2.\nNow, (35) follows, by combining this with the pointwise identity |GR>| = |G| and the pointwise upper bound |Gh\u03a6(Fh)|2 \u2264 |Gh(Fh)\u22121|2|det(Fh)| (which is a consequence of the definition of \u03a6).\nProof of Theorem 2.9 (a). Theorem 2.3 (a) already yields (9), (10) for some n \u2208 H1(S,S2).\nStep 1 \u2013 Strong convergence of (yh) in L 2. By (8) there exists y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) such that\n\u2207hyh \u2192 Ry strongly in L2(\u2126), (36)\nup to a subsequence. With help of the boundary condition (16) and Poincare\u2019s inequality, we conclude that (yh) is bounded in H\n1(\u2126). Hence, the compact embedding H1 \u2286 L2 yields in addition to (36) that yh \u2192 y + c strongly in L2(\u2126) for some constant vector c \u2208 R3. Since the right-hand side in (36) is invariant w.r.t. addition of constants, we may assume w.l.o.g. that c = 0.\nStep 2 \u2013 Argument for y \u2208 ABC . We consider the line segment Li and show that y and\u2207\u2032y satisfy the required boundary condition on Li. Let x\u20320 \u2208 Li. Since Li is relatively open, we can choose r0 > 0 such that the ball B(x\u20320; r0) \u2286 R2 satisfies\nB(x\u20320; r0) \u2229 \u2202S \u2286 Li and B(x\u20320; r0) \u2229 S is connected.\nNext, we extend yh affinely to the 3d-domain B := B(x \u2032 0; r0) \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2) by the following procedure: Since yBC is affine on Li, there exist R0 \u2208 SO(3) and y0 \u2208 R3, such that yBC(x\u2032) = y0 +R0(x \u2032 \u2212 x\u20320, 0)> on Li. Consider the extension\ny\u0303h : B \u2192 R3, y\u0303h(x\u2032, x3) := { (1\u2212 h\u03b4\u0304)(y0 +R0(x\u2032 \u2212 x\u20320, 0)>) + hx3R0e3 if x\u2032 \u2208 B(x\u20320; r0) \\ S, yh(x \u2032, x3) else.\nBy construction, we have y\u0303h|D \u2208 H1(D;R3) for D = B \\ \u2126 and D = B \u2229 \u2126, respectively. Furthermore, the traces of these two restrictions are equal thanks to (16) and the assumed linearity of yBC on Li. We conclude that y\u0303h \u2208 H1(B;R3). Moreover, from\n\u2207hy\u0303h = { R0 \u2212 h\u03b4(R0e1, R0e2, 0) on B \\ \u2126, \u2207hyh on B \u2229 \u2126,\n(37)\nwe conclude that (y\u0303h) has finite bending energy in the sense that lim sup h\u21920\nh\u22122 \u00b4 B dist 2(\u2207hy\u0303h,SO(3)) <\n\u221e. Hence, by Lemma 4.2 and the argument of Step 1 there exists y\u0303 \u2208 H2iso(B(x\u20320; r0);R3) such\nthat (y\u0303h,\u2207hy\u0303h) \u2192 (y\u0303, Ry\u0303) strongly in L2(B). By passing to the limit in (37) with help of (36) and yh \u2192 y in L2(\u2126), we obtain the identity\n(y\u0303, Ry\u0303) = { (y0 +R0 (\u00b7 \u2212 x\u20320, 0)>, R0) in B(x\u20320; r0) \\ S (y,Ry) in B(x \u2032 0; r0) \u2229 S.\nSince (y\u0303, Ry\u0303) \u2208 H1(B(x\u20320; r0)) and (y,Ry) \u2208 H1(B(x\u20320; r0) \u2229 S), we deduce\n(y,Ry) = (y0 +R0(\u00b7 \u2212 x\u20320, 0)>, R0) = (yBC , RyBC ) on Li \u2229B(x \u2032 0; r0)\nin the sense of traces. Since x\u20320 \u2208 Li is arbitrary, we conclude that y satisfies the required boundary condition on Li. Since i \u2208 {1, . . . , kBC} is arbitrary, y \u2208 ABC follows."

By the Pythagorean Theorem and P2d \u25e6 Paff = P2d, for all F \u2208 H we have,\nmin M\u2208R2\u00d72sym \u2016F +M\u20162\u2217 = min M\u2208R2\u00d72sym \u2016PaffF +M\u20162\u2217 + \u2016(1\u2212 Paff)F\u20162\u2217 = \u2016P2dF\u20162\u2217 + \u2016(1\u2212 Paff)F\u20162\u2217\n= \u2016P2dF\u20162\u2217 + min A,M\u2208R2\u00d72 \u2016x3A+M + F\u20162\u2217.\nApplied with F : (\u221212 , 1 2)\u2192 R 2\u00d72 sym, F (x3) := x3A+ 1(x3 > 0) r\u0304 2U \u2032, we obtain the identity\n(?) =\n\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2 (x3, P2dF ) dx3 + min A\u2032,M \u2032\u2208R2\u00d72sym\n\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2 ( x3, x3A \u2032 +M \u2032 + 1(x3 > 0) r\u0304 2U \u2032 ) dx3. (38)\nNote that the second summand on the right-hand side equals r\u03042Eres(U \u2032). Thus, it remains to show that the first summand can be rewritten in the claimed form. To this end, we consider the map\n\u03a6 : R2\u00d72sym \u2192 H2d, \u03a6(A) := P2d(x3A),\nwhere x3A stands short for the map (\u221212 , 1 2) 3 x3 7\u2192 x3A. We note that \u03a6 is an isomorphism. Indeed, \u03a6 is linear and bounded and satisfies \u2016\u03a6(A)\u20162\u2217 \u2265 112CW |A| 2 as a consequence of (5). Since the dimensions of R2\u00d72sym and H2d are the same, \u03a6 must be an isomorphism. We claim that\nr\u0304B(U \u2032) = (\u03a6\u22121 \u25e6 P2d) ( 1(x3 > 0) r\u0304 2U \u2032 )\nfor all G\u2032 \u2208 R2\u00d72. (39)\nBefore we present the proof of the claim, we note that with help of (39), the first integral on the right-hand side in (38) can be written in the form\n\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2 ( x3, P2d ( x3A+ x3r\u0304B(U \u2032) )) = Qel(A+ r\u0304B(U \u2032)),\nwhich completes the proof of Lemma 4.3. It remains to show (39). For the argument, we recall the notation G1, . . . , G3 for the standard basis of R2\u00d72sym and the definition of Ai,Mi, cf. Definition 2.5. We claim that\n\u03a6(Ai) = P2d ( 1(x3 > 0) 1 2Gi ) , i = 1, 2, 3. (40)\nIndeed, in view of the definition of Ai,Mi, we have Paff ( 1(x3 > 0) 1 2Gi ) = x3Ai+Mi. Hence, in\nview of P2d = P2d \u25e6 Paff , we have P2d ( 1(x3 > 0) 1 2Gi ) = P2d(x3Ai +Mi) = P2d(x3Ai) = \u03a6(Ai), and thus (40). By applying the isomorphism \u03a6 to both sides of (39) and by appealing to the definition of B, we see that (39) is in fact equivalent to (40).\nProof of Lemma 2.4. In this proof, we write Q(\u00b7) := Q(x3, \u00b7) and Q2(\u00b7) = Q2(x3, \u00b7), emphasizing the independence from x3. By definition of Qel and by orthogonality, we indeed have\nQel(A) = min M\u2208R2\u00d72sym\n(\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2(x3A) +Q2(M)\n) = 1\n12 Q2(A). (41)\nNext, we note that for each A,M, T \u2208 R2\u00d72sym, we have \u02c6 1\n2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2 (1(x3 > 0)T \u2212 (x3A+M)) dx3\n=Q2 ( 1 2T \u2212M ) + 1 12 Q2 ( 3 2T \u2212A ) + 1 16 Q2 ( T ) ,\n(42)\nwhich can be seen by using the L2((\u221212 , 1 2))-orthogonal decomposition 1(x3 > 0) = 1 2 + 3 2x3 + (1(x3 > 0)\u2212 12\u2212 3 2x3). Using (42) with T := 1 2U and (41), we obtain the claimed form of Eres(U). Using (42) with T := 12Gi and Gi from Definition 2.5, we obtain that Ai from Definition 2.5 takes the form Ai = 3 4Gi. Now,(14) directly follows from the definition of B. For the second part of the proof, we assume the material to be isotropic. Then, the minimizer d in (12) is given by\nd = \u2212 \u03bb 2\u00b5+ \u03bb tr(A)e3,\nwhich leads to the claimed form of Qel. The remaining representation for Eres follows immediately with (13).\nProof of Lemma 2.6. Step 1 \u2013 Proof of (a) and (b). Note that by (5) we have 1CW Q\u0304(G) \u2264 Q2(x3, G) \u2264 CW Q\u0304(G), where Q\u0304(G) := | symG|2. Hence, the claims of (a) and (b) follow with help of (42) applied to Q2 := Q\u0304.\nStep 2 \u2013 Proof of (c).\nThe linearity of B is obvious. For the boundedness, let Ai and Mi be defined as in Definition 2.5 and note that\n1\n12CW |34Gi \u2212Ai| 2 \u2264 1 CW\n\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\n| sym(1(x3 > 0)12Gi \u2212 (x3Ai +Mi))| 2\n\u2264 \u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\nQ2 ( x3,1(x3 > 0) 1 2Gi \u2212 (x3Ai +Mi) ) = Eres(Gi)\n\u2264 CW 64 |Gi|2,\nwhere the first estimate holds by (42) applied to Q2 := | sym(\u00b7)|, the second estimate holds thanks to (5), and the last estimate holds by (b). Hence, we conclude that |Ai| \u2264 \u221a 3\n4 (CW +\u221a 3)."

            "text": "In this section, we present the construction of recovery sequences. We only discuss the case with prescribed boundary conditions, i.e., Theorem 2.9 (b), since it requires an additional argument compared to the case without boundary conditions. In contrast to earlier works in the field, in our situation, constructing the recovery sequences invokes two tasks: the construction of the deformation yh and of the director field nh. Note that the energy invokes a nonlinear coupling between \u2207hyh and nh \u2297 nh, which is the reason why the recovery sequences for yh and nh cannot be constructed independently. However, by exploiting the good compactness properties of the lower-order term nh \u2297 nh, for the recovery sequence, we can first construct a sequence of 3d-directors (nh) that recovers a limiting director field n, and in a second step, we can then construct an adapted sequence of 3d-deformations (yh) (that recovers an n-dependent limiting strain).\nWe first discuss the construction of recovery sequences for deformations. This amounts to finding a sequence of 3d-deformations (yh) such that the associated sequence of nonlinear strains\nEh(yh) =\n\u221a \u2207hy>h\u2207hyh \u2212 I\nh\nstrongly converges in L2(\u2126) to a limiting strain of the form obtained in the compactness statement Lemma 4.2, cf.

As in previous works on the derivation of bending theories, we use that smooth isometries are dense in H2iso(S;R3), see Proposition 2.11 for a statement respecting boundary conditions. The following proposition summarizes the construction for smooth 3d-deformations:\nProposition 4.4. Let S satisfy (3). Let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3), M \u2208 L2(S;R2\u00d72sym), d \u2208 L2(\u2126;R3) and assume that there exists \u03b4 \u2265 0 such that\nM + \u03b4I2\u00d72 \u2265 0 a.e. in {IIy = 0}.

(17)).\n(See Section 4.7 for the proof.)\nResults similar to Proposition 4.4 have been obtained in the context of dimension reduction earlier: The special case M = 0 in (49) is already contained in the seminal paper [26]. Schmidt [55] contains a similar result in the case without boundary conditions and under the additional assumption that M = 0 in an open neighborhood of the flat region {IIy = 0}. Finally, the fourth author introduced in [45] a wrinkling construction (which is inspired by [37]) to construct deformations in the case when M may not vanish on flat regions, yet without respecting boundary conditions. Based on this, to treat boundary conditions, in Section 4.7 we present an argument that for each connected component V of {IIy 6= 0} and int{IIy = 0} constructs a recovery sequence with prescribed clamped, affine boundary conditions on \u2202V \u2229 S. With Propositions 2.11 and 4.4 at hand, we are in a position to prove Theorem 2.9 (b). In fact, we shall establish a stronger statement:\nLemma 4.5. Let Assumption 2.1 and (3) be satisfied. Let (y, n) \u2208 A2 and let (nh) \u2286 H1(\u2126top; S2) denote an arbitrary sequence satisfying\n(nh,\u2207hnh)\u2192 (n,\u2207\u2032n, 0) strongly in L2(\u2126top),\n(e.g., nh := n). Then there exists (yh) \u2286 H1(\u2126;R3) such that (yh,\u2207hyh) \u2192 (y,Ry) strongly in L2(\u2126) and Eh(yh, nh)\u2192 E(y, n). Furthermore, let Assumption 2.8 be satisfied, let y \u2208 ABC and \u03b4\u0304 satisfy (18), then we may additionally enforce yh \u2208 ABC,\u03b4\u0304,h.\nProof of Lemma 4.5 and Theorem 2.9 (b). It suffices to prove Lemma 4.5 and for brevity we only consider the case with prescribed boundary conditions. The construction of yh invokes an approximation argument: By Proposition 2.11, for all k \u2208 N we find yk \u2208 ABC \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3) with \u2016yk \u2212 y\u2016H2(S;R3) < 1k . As an abbreviation, we write R k := Ryk and II k := IIyk .

(51)\nWe claim that Mk satisfies (48) (up to a null-set) for \u03b4 := \u03b4\u0304. Indeed, (5) and a calculation yield\n[RHS of (51)] \u2264 min M\u2208R2\u00d72sym CW\n\u02c6 1 2\n\u2212 1 2\n|1(x3 > 0)T k(x\u2032) +M |2 dx3 = CW 1 4 |T k(x\u2032)|2,\nwhere T k(x\u2032) := r\u03042 ( 1 3I2\u00d72 \u2212 (n\u0302 k)\u2032(x\u2032) \u2297 (n\u0302k)\u2032(x\u2032) )\nand where (n\u0302k)\u2032 contains the first two components of n\u0302k.

Next, we claim that\nlim h\u21920 Eh(ykh, nh) = E(yk, n). (53)\nThis can be seen as follows: Thanks to the convergence of \u2207hykh with rate h\u03b2 and the elementary inequality |Eh(ykh)| \u2264 h\u22121 dist(\u2207hykh,SO(3)), we have \u2016hEh(ykh)\u2016L\u221e(\u2126) \u2192 0. Furthermore, by polar factorization, we find Rkh : \u2126 \u2192 SO(3) such that \u2207hykh = Rkh(I + hEh(ykh)).

Then \u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y strongly in L2(S) (by compact embedding) and thus (\u2207\u2032yk)>\u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y>\u2207\u2032y strongly in L1(S). Hence, since (\u2207\u2032yk)>\u2207\u2032yk = I a.e., we get \u2207\u2032y>\u2207\u2032y = I a.e., and thus y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3). The argument for the weak closedness of H1(S; S2) is similar and left to the reader. For the argument of (ii), note that we have \u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y strongly in L2(S) by compact embedding. Since |\u22021yk| = |\u22022yk| = 1 a.e., we have |byk | \u2264 2 and |\u2207\u2032byk | \u2264 2|\u2207\u2032\u2207\u2032yk| a.e. Hence, we conclude that byk \u21c0 by weakly in H 1(S). Combined with the boundedness of (IIyk) in L 2(S) (c.f. (54)), we obtain IIyk = \u2207\u2032y>k \u2207\u2032byk \u21c0 \u2207\u2032y>\u2207\u2032by = IIy weakly in L2(S). We\nfinally prove (iii). To that end, note that from lim inf k\u2192\u221e\n(E(yk, nk) + \u2016yk\u2016L2(S)) <\u221e, we conclude\nwith help of (a) that \u2016\u2207\u2032\u2207\u2032yk\u2016L2(S) + \u2016yk\u2016L2(S) + \u2016\u2207\u2032nk\u2016L2(S) \u2264 C for a subsequence (not relabeled) and a constant C. Hence, by Poincare\u0301\u2019s inequality, we infer that the sequences (yk) and (nk) are bounded in H2(S) and H1(S), respectively. Thus, we can extract a subsequence that weakly converges in H2(S)\u00d7H1(S) to a limit (y, n). By (i), (y, n) \u2208 A2 follows.\nStep 3 \u2013 Proof of (c). Assume w.l.o.g. that lim infk\u2192\u221e EOF (nk) = lim supk\u2192\u221e EOF (nk) < \u221e. Then (nk) converges weakly in H1(\u2126top), and the liminf-inequality for EOF is an immediate consequence of the weak lower semicontinuity of the L2-norm. For the liminf-inequality of Eel, we assume w.l.o.g. that lim infk\u2192\u221e Eel(yk, nk) < \u221e. Then, by the assumption lim supk\u2192\u221e EOF (nk) < \u221e and by Step 2 (iii), we have (yk, nk) \u21c0 (y, n) weakly in H2(S)\u00d7H1(S). We conclude that \u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y strongly in L2(S), and since |\u2207\u2032yk| = \u221a 2, we have \u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y strongly in Lp(S) for every 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Similarly, we have that nk \u2192 n strongly in Lp(S) for every 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. This implies B(13I2\u00d72 \u2212 (\u2207 \u2032yk)>nk \u2297 (\u2207\u2032yk)>nk) \u2192 B(13I2\u00d72 \u2212 \u2207 \u2032y>n \u2297 \u2207\u2032y>n) strongly in L2(S). By Step 2 (ii) we further have IIyk \u21c0 IIy weakly in L 2(S). Thus, the weak lower semicontinuity of convex integral functionals w.r.t. weak convergence in L2 yields\nlim inf k\u2192\u221e\nEel(yk, nk) \u2265 Eel(y, n).\nStep 4 \u2013 Proof of (b).\nConsider the sublevel C := {(y, n) \u2208 A2 : E(y, n) \u2264 C and \u2016y\u2016L2(S) \u2264 C}, and a sequence (yk, nk) \u2286 C. Then by Step 2 (iii) we can pass to a subsequence (not relabeled) such that (yk, nk) \u21c0 (y, n) weakly in H2(S) \u00d7 H1(S) with (y, n) \u2208 A2. By (c) we have E(y, n) \u2264 lim inf k\u2192\u221e\nE(yk, nk) \u2264 C, and by the lower semicontinuity of the L2-norm, \u2016y\u2016L2(S) \u2264 C. Thus, (y, n) \u2208 C. We conclude that C is compact w.r.t. the weak topology of H2(S) \u00d7 H1(S). The relative compactness of C w.r.t. the strong topology of L2(S) \u00d7 L2(S) follows with help of the compact embedding of H1(S) \u2286 L2(S).\nStep 5 \u2013 Proof of (d). Note that if yk \u2192 y strongly inH2(S) and nk \u21c0 n weakly inH1(S) then, proceeding as in Step 3, \u2207\u2032yk \u2192 \u2207\u2032y strongly in Lp(S) for every 1 \u2264 p <\u221e, and B(13I2\u00d72\u2212 (\u2207\n\u2032yk)>nk \u2297 (\u2207\u2032yk)>nk)\u2192 B(13I2\u00d72\u2212\u2207\n\u2032y>n\u2297\u2207\u2032y>n) strongly in L2(S). Furthermore, by Step 2 (ii) we have that IIyk \u21c0 IIy weakly in L2(S). Since in addition limk\u2192\u221e \u2016IIyk\u2016L2 = \u2016IIy\u2016L2 (because of (54)), we have that IIyk \u2192 IIy strongly in L2(S). Then the continuity of quadratic integral functionals w.r.t. strong convergence in L2 implies that Eel(yk, nk)\u2192 Eel(y, n). The convergence of EOF (nk) is immediate from the definition of strong convergence."

By passing to a subsequence (not relabeled), we have (\u2207hyh, nh)\u2192 (Ry, n) a.e. in \u2126\u00d7\u2126top, and thus, |\n\u2207hy>h nh |\u2207hy>h nh|\n\u2212 n\u03020|2\u03c1\u2192 |R>y n\u2212 n\u03020|2\u03c1 a.e. By dominated convergence the latter holds strongly in L1(\u2126top), and thus (56) follows.\nStep 2 \u2013 Proof of part (a).\nWe only present the proof for Gh, since the argument for Hh is the same. We start with an argument for the lower bound of part (a): Let (yh, nh) \u2286 H1(\u2126;R3)\u00d7H1(\u2126top; S2) be a sequence converging to (y, n) \u2208 A2 strongly in L2. We need to show\nE(y, n) + Gweak(y, n) \u2264 lim inf h\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh) + Gh(yh, nh) ) . (57)\nBy passing to a subsequence, we may assume w.l.o.g. that lim h\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh) + Gh(yh, nh) ) =\nlim inf h\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh) + Gh(yh, nh) ) <\u221e and (in view of Theorem 2.3 (a) and (30)) that\ndet\u2207hyh > 0 a.e. and (yh,\u2207hyh, nh)\u2192 (y,Ry, n) strongly in L2.\nCombined with (56) and Theorem 2.3 (b), (57) follows. Next, we prove the existence of a recovery sequence for (y, n) \u2208 A2. To that end let nh := n and let yh denote the recovery sequence of Lemma 4.5. In view of (30), also (55) holds. We conclude with help of (56) that Eh(yh, nh) + Gh(yh, nh)\u2192 E(y, n) + Gweak(y, n).\nStep 3 \u2013 Proof of part (b).\nWe only present the proof for Hh, since the argument for Gh is the same. We start with the lower bound. Let (yh, nh) \u2286 H1(\u2126;R3)\u00d7H1(\u2126top;S2) be a sequence converging to (y, n) \u2208 A2 strongly in L2 and assume w.l.o.g. that lim inf\nh\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh)+h\u2212\u03b2Hh(yh, nh) ) = lim\nh\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh)+\nh\u2212\u03b2Hh(yh, nh) ) < \u221e. Since Eh + h\u2212\u03b2Hh \u2265 Eh, Theorem 2.3 (a) and (30) yield (55) and thus (56), which in combination with the bound Hh \u2264 h\u03b2(Eh+h\u2212\u03b2Hh) implies that Hweak(y, n) = 0. Hence, (y, n) satisfies the strong anchoring (R>y n \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302)\u03c1\u0304 = 0 a.e. in S. On the other hand, Theorem 2.3 (b) yields\nlim inf h\u21920\n( Eh(yh, nh) + h\u2212\u03b2Hh(yh, nh) ) \u2265 E(y, n).\nSince (y, n) satisfies the strong anchoring condition, the right-hand side is equal to E(y, n) + Hstrong(y, n). This completes the argument for the lower bound.\nNext, we construct a recovery sequence for (y, n) \u2208 A2 satisfying Hstrong(y, n) = 0. We start with approximating (y, n) by a configuration including a smooth isometry: Via [47, 31] (or via\nProposition 2.11 in the case of clamped, affine boundary conditions), we choose for each k \u2208 N some yk \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3) with\n\u2016yk \u2212 y\u2016H2(S) \u2264 1\nk , (58)\nand consider nk := RykR > y n. Then n k \u2208 H1(S; S2) and (R> yk nk \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302)\u03c1\u0304 = (R>y n \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302)\u03c1\u0304 = 0, and thus Hstrong(yk, nk) = 0. Furthermore, from (58) we conclude that nk \u2192 n strongly in H1(\u2126top), and thus Lemma 2.7 yields\nlim k\u2192\u221e\n|E(yk, nk)\u2212 E(y, n)| = 0. (59)\nNext, we construct the recovery sequence for (yk, nk): As in the proof of Lemma 4.5, we find a sequence (ykh)h \u2286 H1(\u2126;R3) such that with nkh := nk we have\nlim h\u21920 Eh(ykh, nkh) = E(yk, nk), (60) (ykh, n k h)\u2192 (yk, nk) in L2(\u2126)\u00d7 L2(\u2126top), (61)\nlim sup h\u21920\nh\u2212\u03b2/2\u2016\u2207hykh \u2212Ryk\u2016L\u221e(\u2126) = 0. (62)\nFrom (62), and since Hstrong(yk, nk) = 0, we infer\nh\u2212\u03b2 \u02c6\n\u2126top \u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u2207hykh)>nkh |(\u2207hykh)>nkh| \u00b7 \u03bd\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u22232\u03c1\u2192 0 (as h\u2192 0).\nThus, combined with (58) to (61), we conclude that\nck,h := |Eh(ykh, nkh) + h\u2212\u03b2Hh(ykh, nkh)\u2212 (E(y, n) +Hstrong(y, n))|+ \u2016ykh \u2212 y\u2016L2 + \u2016nkh \u2212 n\u2016L2\nsatisfies lim sup k\u2192\u221e lim sup h\u21920 ck,h = 0.

Hence, by using the definition of the extension Eg we conclude that\n(Eg)(\u03a6\u03c3(t, s)) = (g \u25e6 \u03a6\u03c3)(t, 0) = (g \u25e6 \u03b3)(t). (64)\nAlso note that \u03a6\u03c3 : U \u2192 \u0393\u03c3n is a homeomorphism because of (a). Furthermore, \u03b3 \u2208 C2 yields \u03a6\u03c3 \u2208 C1(U) and the Jacobian of \u03a6\u03c3 satisfies |det(J\u03a6\u03c3(t, s))| = \u03c3|1 \u2212 s\u03c3\u03ba(t)| where \u03ba(t) := R\u22a5\u03b3\u2032\u2032(t) \u00b7 \u03b3\u2032(t).

First, we extend f to a function f\u0302 \u2208 H1(\u0393\u03c3n;R3) such that f\u0302 = f a.e. on S \u2229 \u0393\u03c3n, \u2016\u2207\u2032f\u0302\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c3n) \u2264 C\u2016\u2207\u2032f\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c3n\u2229S) and \u2016f\u0302\u2016L\u221e(\u0393\u03c3n) \u2264 C\u2016f\u2016L\u221e(S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n). This is possible since S \u2229 \u0393 \u03c3 n is a Lipschitz domain. In view of this, and since |\u0393\u03c3n \\ S| \u2264 C\u03c32, we see that for (c), it suffices to show\u2223\u2223\u2223 1 \u03c3 \u02c6 \u0393\u03c3n |f\u0302 \u2212 Eg|2 dx\u2032 \u2212 \u02c6 \u0393n |T f\u0302 \u2212 g|2 dH1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C(\u221a\u03c3\u2016\u2207\u2032f\u0302\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c3n) + \u03c3).

We set A(t, s) := (f\u0302 \u2212 Eg)(\u03a6\u03c3(t, s)) and B(t, s) := ((T f\u0302 \u2212 g)(\u03a6\u03c3(t, 0)). Therefore, using the general estimate \u2016A2 \u2212 B2\u2016L1 \u2264 (\u2016A\u2016L2 + \u2016B\u2016L2)\u2016A \u2212 B\u2016L2 and \u2016A\u2016L\u221e(U) + \u2016B\u2016L\u221e(U) < C (which holds thanks to the uniform boundedness of f\u0302 and g), we obtain\n[LHS of (65)] = C\u03c3 + C ( \u02c6\nU |(f\u0302 \u25e6 \u03a6\u03c3)(t, s)\u2212 (T f\u0302 \u25e6 \u03a6\u03c3)(t, 0)|2 dsdt\n) 1 2 ,\nwhere we also used (64) in form of the identity (Eg \u25e6 \u03a6\u03c3)(t, s) \u2212 (g \u25e6 \u03a6\u03c3)(t, 0) = 0.

We only present the argument for G\u03c3, since H\u03c3 can be treated similarly. Throughout the proof, C denotes a positive constant that might change from line to line, but that can be chosen independently of \u03c3.\nStep 1 \u2013 Proof of (a), lower bound. Let \u03b2 = 0 and consider a sequence (y\u03c3, n\u03c3) that converges to some (y, n) strongly in L 2(S). W.l.o.g. we may assume that lim inf \u03c3\u21920 (E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)+G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)) = lim sup \u03c3\u21920 (E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)+G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)) < \u221e. Thus, Lemma 2.7 implies that (y\u03c3, n\u03c3), (y, n) \u2208 A2, y\u03c3 \u21c0 y weakly in H2(S), n\u03c3 \u21c0 n weakly in H1(S), and lim inf\u03c3\u21920 E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) \u2265 E(y, n). It thus remains to prove\nlim inf \u03c3\u21920\n1\n\u03c3 \u02c6 S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n |R>y\u03c3n\u03c3 \u2212 En\u0302BC | 2 dx\u2032 \u2265 \u02c6 \u0393n |T (R>y n)\u2212 n\u0302BC |2 dH1, (67)\nwhere T : H1(S;R3)\u2192 L2(\u0393n;R3) denotes the trace operator. For convenience set f\u03c3 := R>y\u03c3n\u03c3. We note that (f\u03c3) is a bounded sequence in H\n1(S; S2). Furthermore, from Lemma 4.6 (c), we get \u2223\u2223\u2223 1\n\u03c3 \u02c6 S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n |f\u03c3 \u2212 En\u0302BC |2 dx\u2032 \u2212 \u02c6 \u0393n |Tf\u03c3 \u2212 n\u0302BC |2 dH1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C\u03c3 + C\u221a\u03c3\u2016\u2207\u2032f\u03c3\u2016L2(S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n).

Let 0 < \u03b2 < 12 and consider a sequence (y\u03c3, n\u03c3) that converges to some (y, n) strongly in L2(S). As in Step 1 we may assume w.l.o.g. that lim inf\n\u03c3\u21920 (E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)) =\nlim sup \u03c3\u21920\n(E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)) < \u221e, as well as (y\u03c3, n\u03c3), (y, n) \u2208 A2, y\u03c3 \u21c0 y weakly in\nH2(S), n\u03c3 \u21c0 n weakly in H 1(S), and lim inf\u03c3\u21920 E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) \u2265 E(y, n). Thanks to (67) and 1 \u03c3 \u00b4 S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n |R>y\u03c3n\u03c3 \u2212 En\u0302BC | 2 = \u03c3\u03b2\u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) \u2192 0, we conclude that the strong anchoring R>y n = n\u0302BC on \u0393n is satisfied, and thus E(y, n)+Gstrong,\u0393n(y, n) = E(y, n) \u2264 lim inf\u03c3\u21920 E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) \u2264 lim inf\u03c3\u21920(E(y\u03c3, n\u03c3) + \u03c3\u2212\u03b2G\u03c3(y\u03c3, n\u03c3)).\nStep 3 \u2013 Proof of (a), upper bound.\nIt suffices to construct a recovery sequence for (y, n) with E(y, n) + Gweak,\u0393n(y, n) < \u221e, which implies that (y, n) \u2208 A2. We claim that the constant sequence is a recovery sequence, i.e., we need to show that 1\u03c3 \u00b4 S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n |R>y n\u2212 En\u0302BC |2 dx\u2032 \u2192 \u00b4 \u0393n |T (R>y n)\u2212 n\u0302BC |2 dH1.

The latter implies that (y, n) \u2208 A2 and R>y n = n\u0302BC on \u0393n. We claim that the constant sequence is a recovery sequence. Indeed, from Lemma 4.6 (c) applied with f := R>y n and thanks to Tf = n\u0302BC on \u0393n, we learn that \u03c3\u2212(1+\u03b2) \u02c6 S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n |R>y n\u2212 En\u0302BC |2 dx\u2032 \u2264 \u03c3\u2212\u03b2 (\u02c6 \u0393n |Tf \u2212 n\u0302BC |2 dH1 + C( \u221a \u03c3\u2016\u2207\u2032f\u2016L2(S\u2229\u0393\u03c3n) + \u03c3) ) .

            "text": "The structure of the proof of Proposition 4.4 is as follows.\n(i) For each smooth isometry y : S \u2192 R3, the domain S can be decomposed into a flat part {IIy = 0} and a non-flat part {IIy 6= 0}, and, as we shall see, connected components V of {IIy 6= 0} and int{IIy = 0} have a special geometry: The relative boundary \u2202V \u2229 S is a disjoint union of line segments whose endpoints are contained in \u2202S, and y is affine on \u2202V \u2229 S. Furthermore, in the non-flat case, \u2202V \u2229 S consists of (at most) two such line segments. Furthermore, we see that \u2202{IIy 6= 0} \u2229 S is a null set, see Lemma 4.7. This allows us to construct the recovery sequence on each connected component independently.\n(ii) For each connected component V \u2286 {IIy 6= 0}, we construct the recovery sequence based on ideas in [55, 42]. The construction invokes a solution to the system \u2207\u2032symg+\u03b1IIy = M . The existence of such a solution has already been shown in [55]. In order to recover the prescribed boundary conditions, we shall slightly upgrade that existence result by showing that solutions exist that vanish on the relative boundary \u2202V \u2229S and the line segments Li that appear in our boundary condition.\n(iii) The construction on a connected component V \u2286 int{IIy = 0} is similar to [45] and relies on an approximation result for the Monge-Ampe\u0301re equation introduced in [37]. Nevertheless, we shall give a self-contained presentation of the construction, since we need to take care of the additional boundary conditions.\nThe above discussion is made precise in the following two lemmas.\nLemma 4.7. Let S satisfy (3). Let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3).

            "text": "For the proof of Lemma 4.7 and the recovery sequence construction in the curved case, we appeal to standard properties of isometric immersions, which we recall in the following. We refer to [47, 31, 32, 39] for details. Since H2-regular isometric immersions are continuously differentiable (see [39, Proposition 5]) the following definition is meaningful:\nDefinition 4.9. Let S \u2286 R2 be open. For y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) we denote by C\u2207\u2032y := { x\u2032 \u2208 S : \u2207\u2032y is constant in some neighborhood of x\u2032 } the flat part of y. Furthermore, we denote by C\u0302\u2207\u2032y the union of all connected components U \u2286 C\u2207\u2032y with \u2202U \u2229 S consisting of more than two connected components. An important observation is that at each point x\u2032 in the non-flat part S \\ C\u2207\u2032y, the isometry y is affine on a unique line segment that contains x\u2032 and whose endpoints are contained in \u2202S. In fact, this property extends to the larger set S \\ C\u0302\u2207\u2032y as the following lemma shows. For arbitrary x\u2032 \u2208 S and N \u2208 S1, we use the notion of [x\u2032;N ] as the connected component of S \u2229 {x\u2032 + sN : s \u2208 R} that contains x\u2032 itself.\nLemma 4.10 ([47],[31]). Let S be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3). Then, there is a locally Lipschitz continuous vector field N : S\\C\u0302\u2207\u2032y \u2192 S1 such that for all x\u20321, x\u20322 \u2208 S\\C\u0302\u2207\u2032y,\n\u2207\u2032y is constant on [x\u20321;N(x\u20321)], (73) [x\u20321;N(x \u2032 1)] \u2229 [x\u20322;N(x\u20322)] 6= \u2205 \u21d2 [x\u20321;N(x\u20321)] = [x\u20322;N(x\u20322)]. (74)\nMoreover, if x\u20321 \u2208 S \\ C\u2207\u2032y, then property (73) defines the value N(x\u20321) uniquely up to a sign. We call N a field of asymptotic directions of y.\nBased on N one can introduce natural parametrizations of y:\nDefinition 4.11 (Patch). Let S be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) and N as in Lemma 4.10. A curve\n\u0393 \u2208W 2,\u221e([0, T ];S \\ C\u0302\u2207\u2032y), T > 0,\nis called a ruling curve of y, if for all t, t\u2032 \u2208 [0, T ], \u0393\u2032(t) = R\u22a5N(\u0393(t)), 0 < \u0393\u2032(t) \u00b7 \u0393\u2032(t\u2032), R\u22a5 := (\n0 \u22121 1 0\n) . (75)\nA set P \u2286 S \\ C\u0302\u2207\u2032y is called a patch (with respect to y and N), if there exists a ruling curve \u0393 such that P = \u22c3\nt\u2208(0,T )\n[\u0393(t); (N \u25e6 \u0393)(t)]. (76)\nRemark 4.12 (Line of curvature parametrization in the smooth case). On patches the line of curvature parametrization yields a simple representation of the surface and its second fundamental form, e.g., see [47, 55], and in particular [31, Proposition 1]. In the case of a smooth isometry (which is the situation that we consider in this section) the following additional properties hold: Let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3)\u2229C\u221e(S;R3) with N as in Lemma 4.10. Then we have C\u2207\u2032y = int({IIy = 0}) and S \\ C\u2207\u2032y = S \u2229 {IIy 6= 0} by continuity of IIy. Moreover, we note that N is smooth on {IIy 6= 0}, as follows from IIyN = 0 (cf. 73) and the smoothness of IIy. Now, let P be a patch for y with ruling curve \u0393 such that \u0393([0, T ]) \u2286 {IIy 6= 0}. Then \u0393 is smooth on the closed interval [0, T ] as a consequence of (75) and the smoothness of N . If S is convex, then the set S\u0393 := {(t, s) \u2208 (0, T ) \u00d7 R : \u0393(t) + sN(\u0393(t)) \u2208 S} is open and convex (see [47, Lemma 3.6]), and S\u0393 \u2192 P , (t, s) 7\u2192 \u0393(t) + sN(\u0393(t)) defines a smooth diffeomorphism. Furthermore, for all (t, s) \u2208 [0, T ]\u00d7 R with \u0393(t) + sN(\u0393(t)) \u2208 S we have 1\u2212 s\u03ba(t) > 0, and\nIIy(\u0393(t) + sN(\u0393(t))) = \u03ban(t) 1\u2212 s\u03ba(t) \u0393\u2032(t)\u2297 \u0393\u2032(t), (77)\nwhere \u03ba := \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u00b7 (N \u25e6 \u0393) and \u03ban : [0, T ]\u2192 R denotes a smooth function related to the curvature of y \u25e6 \u0393."

To conclude the latter, we show that \u2202Vi \u2229 S consists of at most two line segments. (Note that this is only true since S is convex.) The latter follows from the following two properties:\n(i) The connected components of \u2202Vi \u2229 S are line segments of the form [x\u2032;N(x\u2032)].\n(ii) There are at most two disjoint line segments of the form [x\u2032;N(x\u2032)] contained in \u2202Vi \u2229 S.\nProperty (ii) is true, since otherwise Vi contains a small triangle on which y is affine \u2013 in contradiction to IIy 6= 0 on Vi.

We first note that IIy(x \u2032) = 0 and thus IIy = 0 on [x \u2032;N(x\u2032)] (by (77) and a contradiction argument). Hence, [x\u2032;N(x\u2032)] \u2229 Vi = \u2205. To conclude [x\u2032;N(x\u2032)] \u2286 \u2202Vi \u2229 S, it suffices to show that any x\u0304\u2032 \u2208 [x\u2032;N(x\u2032)] is the limit of a sequence in Vi. To that end, choose s \u2208 R with x\u0304\u2032 = x\u2032 + sN(x\u2032) and consider the sequence x\u0304\u2032n := x \u2032 n + sN(x \u2032 n) where (x \u2032 n) \u2286 Vi with x\u2032n \u2192 x\u2032. By continuity of N , we have x\u0304\u2032n \u2192 x\u0304\u2032. Furthermore, since S is open and x\u0304\u2032 \u2208 S, we have x\u0304\u2032n \u2208 S for all n large enough, and thus x\u0304\u2032n \u2208 [x\u2032n;N(x\u2032n)].

Step 1 \u2013 Construction of a displacement field on a single patch.\nLet P \u2286 V be a patch such that the endpoints of the associated ruling curve are contained in V . Let MP \u2208 C\u221ec (P ;R2\u00d72). We claim that there exists a sequence wh \u2208 C\u221e(P \u00d7 [\u221212 , 1 2 ];R\n3) that vanishes in a uniform neighborhood of (\u2202P \u2229 S) \u2229 (\u221212 , 1 2) such that\nlim sup h\u21920 \u2016\u2207hwh\u2016L\u221e <\u221e, lim sup h\u21920\nh\u22121\u2016 sym ( R>y \u2207hwh ) \u2212 \u03b9(MP )\u2016L\u221e <\u221e.

The existence of g, \u03b1 follows from Lemma 4.14. As in [42] we consider\nwh := V + hx3\u00b5, V = Ry ( g \u03b1 ) , \u00b5 := (I3\u00d73 \u2212 by \u2297 by)(\u22021V \u2227 \u22022y + \u22021y \u2227 \u22022V ),\nWe note that\nsym ( (\u2207\u2032y)>(\u2207\u2032V ) )\n= MP , sym ( 02\u00d72 (\u2207\u2032y)>\u00b5 b>y \u2207\u2032V 0 ) = 0.\nIndeed, the first identity follows from (78) by a direct calculation and the second identity is a consequence of the definition of \u00b5. Now, (79) follows from the smoothness of Ry,by, g and \u03b1.\nStep 2 \u2013 Construction of the recovery sequence. It suffices to provide a construction in the case d \u2208 C\u221ec (V ;R3) and M \u2208 C\u221ec (V ;R2\u00d72sym), since then the general case follows by a diagonal sequence argument. Furthermore, we only present the argument in the case of prescribed boundary conditions y \u2208 ABC (since this adds an additional layer of difficulty). Let n \u2208 N. By Lemma 4.13 there exists kn \u2208 N, and pair-wise disjoint patches P1, . . . , Pkn \u2286 V , whose ruling curves have endpoints in V , such that |V \\(P1\u222a. . .\u222aPkn)| < 1n .

Thus, wn,h also vanishes in a\nuniform neighborhood of ( \u2202V \u2229 (S \u222a L1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a LkBC ) ) \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2); for the latter we used that Lj \u2229 \u2202Pi = \u2205, cf. Lemma 4.13. We consider the sequence\nyn,h := (1\u2212 h\u03b4)y + hx3by + h2Ry \u02c6 x3\n0 d(\u00b7, t) dt+ hwn,h.\nIt is a standard Kirchhoff-Love ansatz modified by the displacement wn,h constructed via Step 1. By construction yn,h satisfies the required boundary conditions, i.e., we have yn,h = (1\u2212h\u03b4)y+ hx3by in a uniform neighborhood of ( \u2202V \u2229 (S\u222aL1\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aLkBC ) ) \u00d7 (\u221212 , 1 2). A direct calculation shows that\nlim sup h\u21920\n( \u2016yn,h \u2212 y\u2016L\u221e(V\u00d7(\u2212 1\n2 , 1 2\n)) + h \u2212\u03b2\u2016\u2207hyn,h \u2212Ry\u2016L\u221e(V\u00d7(\u2212 1\n2 , 1 2 )) + \u2016Eh(yn,h)\u2212 ( \u03b9(x3II +Mn \u2212 \u03b4I2\u00d72) + sym(d\u2297 e3) ) \u2016L2(V\u00d7(\u2212 1\n2 , 1 2 ))\n) = 0.\nSince Mn \u2212 \u03b4I2\u00d72 \u2192 M in L2(V ), we obtain the sought for sequence by passing to a suitable diagonal sequence yh := ynh,h.\nProof of Lemma 4.13. Step 1 \u2013 Construction of P1, . . . , Pk. Since V is open and f(x\u2032) := (\u2212N2(x\u2032), N1(x\u2032)) is bounded and locally Lipschitz continuous in V , for each x\u2032 \u2208 V , we can find Tx\u2032 > 0 and a ruling curve \u0393x\u2032 such that \u0393x\u2032 : [0, Tx\u2032 ]\u2192 V and \u0393(Tx\u2032/2) = x\n\u2032; indeed, we only need to solve the differential equation \u0393\u2032x\u2032(t) = f(\u0393x\u2032(t)) with initial value given by x\u2032. We denote by Px\u2032 \u2286 V the associated patch. Since V is open and bounded, we can choose \u03b4 > 0 such that |V \\ V\u03b4| < \u03b5, where V\u03b4 := {x\u2032 \u2208 V : B(x\u2032; \u03b4) \u2286 V }. Then V\u03b4 \u2286 \u22c3 x\u2032\u2208V\u03b4 Px\u2032 . Since V\u03b4 is compact, we can find x \u2032 1, . . . , x \u2032 k \u2208 V\u03b4 such that with Pi := Px\u2032i we have V\u03b4 \u2286 P1\u222a . . .\u222aPk and thus |V \\ (P1\u222a . . .\u222aPk)| \u2264 |V \\V\u03b4| < \u03b5. So far, the patches are not disjoint. However, it is easy to check that intersections Pi \u2229 Pj or differences Pi \\ Pj of two patches are either empty or patches as well. Therefore, w.l.o.g., we may assume that the patches P1, . . . , Pk are disjoint. This proves the first part of the lemma.\nStep 2 \u2013 The case y \u2208 ABC . Fix i, j. To shorten the notation, we simply write L, P , \u0393 and T instead of Lj , Pi, \u0393i and Ti. For the following argument it is useful to note that\n\u2202P \u2229 \u2202S = \u22c3\nt\u2208[0,T ]\n[\u0393(t);N(\u0393(t))] \u2229 \u2202S. (80)\nIndeed, this follow from (76) and convexity of S. We show that L \u2229 \u2202P = \u2205 by contraposition and thus assume that L \u2229 \u2202P 6= \u2205. Then, by (80), there is x\u20320 \u2208 V \u2286 {IIy 6= 0} such that [x\u20320;N(x\u20320)]\u2229L 6= \u2205. But S is convex, N is continuous, and V and L are (relatively) open. So we even find x\u20321 \u2208 V \u2286 {IIy 6= 0} such that [x\u20321;N(x\u20321)]\u2229L 6= \u2205. For the same reasons, there is \u03b5 > 0 such that\n\u2200x\u20322 \u2208 B(x\u20321; \u03b5) : [x\u20322;N(x\u20322)] \u2229 L 6= \u2205.\nBy y \u2208 ABC\u2229C\u221e(S;R3) and (73), we conclude that\u2207\u2032y is constant on B(x\u20321; \u03b5) \u2013 a contradiction to x\u20321 \u2208 {IIy 6= 0}.\nProof of Lemma 4.14.\nStep 1 \u2013 Preliminaries.\nFor convenience set N(t) := N(\u0393(t)). Let \u03ba, \u03ban, S\u0393 be defined as in Remark 4.12 and note that by convexity of S (c.f. [47, 31])\n\u2202P = {\u0393(t) + sN(t) : (t, s) \u2208 \u2202S\u0393}, \u2202P \u2229 S = [\u0393(0);N(0)] \u222a [\u0393(T );N(T )].\nBy Remark 4.12, \u0393, \u03ba and \u03ban are smooth on [0, T ]. Furthermore, since |IIy| is bounded on S and min[0,T ] |\u03ban| > 0, it follows by (77), that inf(t,s)\u2208S\u0393(1\u2212 s\u03ba(t)) > 0.\nStep 2 \u2013 Construction of a solution to (78). Following [55, Lemma 3.3] we consider the orthonormal basis of R2\u00d72sym given by\nF1(t) := N(t)\u2297N(t), F2(t) := \u221a 2 sym(N(t)\u2297 \u0393\u2032(t)), F3(t) := \u0393\u2032(t)\u2297 \u0393\u2032(t),\nand represent M with help of the coefficient functions m\u03041, m\u03042, m\u03043 : S\u0393 \u2192 R defined by the identity M(\u03a6\u0393(t, s)) = \u22113 i=1 m\u0304i(t, s)Fi(t), where \u03a6\u0393(t, s) := \u0393(t) + sN(t) denotes the diffeomorphism of Remark 4.12.

To solve the system (81), we note that by Step 1 the coefficients and the right-hand side of the system are smooth and bounded. Since m\u03041 \u2208 X we can easily find g\u03042 \u2208 X solving the first equation. Likewise, since \u221a 2m\u03042 + 1 1\u2212s\u03ba(t)\u2202tg\u03042 \u2208 X, integration of the second equation yields a solution g\u03041 \u2208 X."

In fact, we prove a slightly stronger statement, where instead of (3), we only assume the following condition introduced in [31]:\nS \u2286 R2 is a bounded Lipschitz domain, and there is a closed subset \u03a3 \u2286 \u2202S with H1(\u03a3) = 0, such that the unit outer normal exists on \u2202S \\ \u03a3 and is continuous on that set.\n(89)\nOur proof is a consequence of the theory developed in [33, 47, 31, 32] and builds on ideas of [41]. In particular, we shall appeal to the following result, which follows from the proof of [31, Theorem 1]:\nProposition 4.16 (cf. [31, Theorem 1]). Let S \u2286 R2 satisfy (89) and let y \u2208 H2iso(S;R3) be finitely developable in the sense that C\u0302\u2207\u2032y consists of finitely many connected components.

Then, in a second step, we check that y\u0302 can be approximated by an isometry that is finitely developable and that is equal to y\u0302 on the components Ui. An application of Proposition 4.16 then yields a smooth isometry y\u0302\u03b4 that approximates y\u0302 and satisfies y\u0302\u03b4 = y\u0302 on the components Ui. We conclude that y\u0302\u03b4 \u2223\u2223 S \u2208 ABC .\nLemma 4.17. Let S \u2286 R2 satisfy (89) and suppose Assumption 2.8.

Furthermore, Li \u2286 Ui and \u2202Ui \u2229Di consists of exactly two connected components.\nProof. It suffices to consider the case kBC = 1 since the argument below can be iterated finitely many times. The idea of the proof is sketched in Figure 7.\nStep 1 - Proof of (a). Since L1 \u2286 \u2202S is a relatively open line segment, there exists x\u20321, x\u20322 \u2208 \u2202S such that L1 = conv{x\u20321, x\u20322}. Let \u03bd \u2208 S1 denote the outer unit normal on L1. Since \u2202S is Lipschitz, there exists \u03c1 > 0 such that the triangles \u22061 := conv{x\u20321, x\u20322, x\u20321+3x \u2032 2 4 +\u03c1\u03bd} and \u22062 := conv{x \u2032 1, x \u2032 2, 3x\u20321+x \u2032 2\n4 +\u03c1\u03bd} have empty intersections with S. Set D1 := \u22061\u222a\u22062. We conclude that S\u0302 := int(S \u222aD1) satisfies the claimed properties.\nStep 2 - Proof of (b). Let S\u0302 as in (a) and let y \u2208 ABC be non-affine. Since \u2207\u2032y is constant on L1, there exists y\u0302 \u2208 H2iso(S\u0302;R3) such that y\u0302 = y in S, and IIy\u0302 = 0 in \u22061 \u2229\u22062, and IIy\u0302 is constant and non-zero on each of the two sets \u22061 \\\u22062 and \u22062 \\\u22061. Let U1 denote the connected component of C\u2207\u2032y\u0302 that contains \u22061 \u2229 \u22062. Since y is assumed to be non-affine, \u2202U1 \u2229 S\u0302 must consist of at least three connected components. We conclude that y\u0302 satisfies the sought for properties.\nWe are now in the position to prove Proposition 2.11.\nProof of Proposition 2.11. Let y \u2208 ABC and assume w.l.o.g. that y is non-affine. Let S\u0302 and y\u0302 be as in Lemma 4.17. For i = 1, . . . , kBC let Di and Ui be as in Lemma 4.17. We apply [31, Proposition 5] and obtain a sequence (u\u03b4) of finitely developable isometries in H2iso(S\u0302;R3) such that:\n\u2022 \u2016u\u03b4 \u2212 y\u0302\u2016 H2(S\u0302;R3) \u2192 0,\n\u2022 for all \u03b4 > 0 (sufficiently small) we have u\u03b4 = y\u0302 on each connected component U \u2286 C\u0302\u2207\u2032y\u0302 satisfying\nU \u2229 {x\u2032 \u2208 S\u0302 : dist(x\u2032, \u2202S\u0302) > \u03b4} 6= \u2205. (90)\nSince the line segments Li are contained in the open set S\u0302, for all \u03b4 > 0 (sufficiently small), the components Ui, i = 1, . . . , kBC , satisfy (90). Thus, we conclude that\nu\u03b4 = y\u0302 in Ui for all i = 1, . . . , kBC . (91)\nNote that this implies (u\u03b4,\u2207\u2032u\u03b4) = (y\u0302,\u2207\u2032y\u0302) on Li, since we have Li \u2286 Ui by construction (and H2iso(S;R3) \u2286 C1(S;R3)). In particular, we have u\u03b4|S \u2208 ABC . If u\u03b4|S is affine, then it is smooth\nand thus the desired approximation. If u\u03b4|S is not affine, we proceed as follows. From (91) we obtain that (u\u03b4,\u2207\u2032u\u03b4) = (y\u0302,\u2207\u2032y\u0302) on \u2202Ui \u2229Di, and thus,\ny\u0302\u03b4(x\u2032) :=\n{ y\u0302(x\u2032) x \u2208 \u22c3kBC i=1 (Di \\ Ui),\nu\u03b4(x\u2032) else.\ndefines an isometry in H2iso(S\u0302;R3). Since y\u0302 is curved in Di \\ Ui, we conclude that y\u0302\u03b4 is finitely developable. Furthermore, since \u2202Ui \u2229Di consists of at least two connected components, and since u\u03b4|S is non-affine, there exist connected components U \u03b4i \u2286 C\u0302\u2207\u2032y\u0302\u03b4 with Ui \u2286 U \u03b4i . An application of Proposition 4.16 to y\u0302\u03b4 thus yields an isometry y\u03b4 \u2208 H2iso(S;R3)\u2229C\u221e(S\u0302;R3) with \u2016y\u03b4 \u2212 y\u0302\u03b4\u2016\nH2(S\u0302;R3) < \u03b4 such that y \u03b4 = y\u0302\u03b4 = y\u0302 on Ui for i = 1, . . . , kBC . Combined with the\nproperty Li \u2286 Ui we conclude that y\u03b4|S \u2208 ABC \u2229 C\u221e(S;R3) and y\u03b4 \u2192 y in H2(S;R3)."
