INTRODUCTION\nDue to the increase in the volume of data exchanged, developing high-speed communication systems has become crucial, be it for optical or wireless communications. For this purpose, developing transistor technologies that combine high speed and high breakdown voltage has become mandatory. InP double heterojunction bipolar transistors (InP DHBT) have these characteristics. Both Type-I [1] and Type-II [2] DHBTs have already demonstrated fMAX above 1 THz while having breakdown voltages of 4.1 V and 5.4 V, respectively.\nTo benefit from these performances, accurate characterization of these transistors is crucial in order to confirm the high cutoff frequency and to validate the associated compact model used for integrated circuit (IC) design. Transistor characterization below 110 GHz often involves off-wafer calibration and open-short de-embedding [1]\u2013[3]. It has been shown that measurements beyond 110 GHz are particularly difficult [4]. To perform InP DHBT characterization at higher frequencies, on-wafer thru-reflectline (TRL) calibration has been introduced along with optimized test structures [5]\u2013[7]. This method has demonstrated excellent results. However, it requires more area on the wafer to accommodate additional calibration structures and one needs to change the inter-probe distance during the calibration step.\nHowever, most of these previous works do not take into account the \"industrial\" point of view of characterizing transistors and rather invest of developing techniques that are area consuming. With that in mind, in this paper, we introduce a new industrially compatible design. This new design contains optimized test structures as well as a high density of transistors. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section II details the transistor technology and the three RF test structures design; section III presents the comparison of the three test structure designs on\ndeembedding structures characterization and InP DHBT RF figures of merit extraction.\nII.

The highly C-doped (8 \u2219 1019 cm-3) 28-nm InGaAs base is compositionally graded (from In0.47Ga0.53As on the emitter side to In0.53Ga0.47As on the collector side) in order to reduce the base transit time. The 130-nm thick composite collector is composed of a non-intentionally doped InGaAs spacer, a 20-nm thick highly doped layer and a lightly doped collector region. The transistors are processed using a wet-etch selfaligned triple mesa technology as described in [8]. This technology, which also includes three levels of gold metallization for interconnections, is compatible with circuit design [9], [10]. Among the characterized devices, different transistor geometries were considered: emitter width varied from 0.4-\u00b5m to 0.7-\u00b5m while the emitter length varied from 5-\u00b5m to 10-\u00b5m. Fig. 1 shows a scanning electron microscopy view of a 0.4 \u00d7 7 \u00b5m\u00b2 InP DHBT.\nThe performances of the 0.4 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m\u00b2 InP DHBT under test have been presented in [11]. The common emitter breakdown voltage BVCE0 is greater than 4.5 V and the static current gain \u03b2 is around 30. The transition frequency, fT, and the maximum oscillation frequency, fMAX, are 380 GHz and 605 GHz, respectively."

            "text": "In this study an optimized design of RF test structures for industrial application is proposed. In order to analyze its\nperformances, three different RF test structures are\ncompared. The first design is used in an \u201cindustrial\u201d context\nwhile the second has been designed to prove the feasibility of measurement up to 500 GHz. The third one is the new\noptimized design proposed in this work\n1) High density pads (design 1) This design (see Fig. 2) is the pre-defined design in\nstandard III-V Lab process. It is designed with the purpose\nof maximizing the number of test structures within the chip\narea with different geometries of transistors. These highdensity constraints are imposed due to the fact that a large\nnumber of transistors is required for process yield and\nvariability analysis. The RF pads are compatible with 100-\n\u00b5m pitch probes. The density of transistor targeted with this\ndesign is 20 transistors per chip.\n2) High quality pads (design 2) As presented in [5], this design (see Fig. 3) combines\ntwo optimization strategies to improve the on-wafer\nmeasurement accuracy up to 500 GHz. First, a continuous\nground plane was implemented in order to minimize the\nprobe-to-substrate coupling, as well as the coupling between neighbouring structures. By connecting all the ground pads\ntogether and creating a signal pad shielding, this continuous\nground plane also contributes to the improvement of the RF\nsignal propagation along the access line. Second, on-wafer\nTRL calibration method was used up to 500 GHz, requiring\nthe design of TRL standards on the same InP substrate as the devices to characterize. In addition, the RF pads were\ncompatible with the 50-100 \u00b5m probing pitch required by\nthe RF probes in the different frequency bands up to 500\nGHz. The density of this design is 8 transistors per chip\n(Fig. 3 shows a chip, which has twice the area of the one in\nFig. 2).\nFig. 3. Photograph of a die with high quality pads\n3) Optimized pads for industrial process fabrication\n(design 3)\nThis third design (see Fig. 4) re-uses the continuous ground plane method used in the design 2 as it reduces the\nprobe to substrate interaction for high frequency\nmeasurements. Moreover, a checkerboard configuration, as\nintroduced in [12], was implemented. It allows the reduction\nof the distance between the neighbouring structures that are\nabove and below. Thus, this configuration allows to optimize the density of test structures while maintaining a\nreduced coupling between neighbouring test structures.\nThese pads are designed for 100-\u00b5m pitch probes. The\ndensity is 14 transistors per chip.\nIII. RESULTS\nTo analyze the performances of these three test structure\ndesigns, the measurements on a 0.4 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m\u00b2 InP DHBT and\non its associated de-embedding test structures were\nperformed. The S-parameters measurements were carried out from 1 GHz to 110 GHz with an Anritsu Vectorstar\nnetwork analyzer using an off-wafer Short-Open-Load-\nThrough (SOLT) calibration and 100-\u00b5m pitch Picoprobe\nRF probes."

            "text": "110 GHz\nThe accurate extraction of transistor parameters relies on a precise de-embedding of parasitic capacitances and inductances that surround the device. In order to verify the validity of the de-embedding, open and short structures are associated to electrical equivalent circuits (see Fig. 5). To verify that open capacitances and short inductances are not frequency-dependent, their values were extracted using Y and Z parameters (see Fig. 7.).\nAs observed from Fig. 7, the measured open capacitances and short inductances of the three different test\nstructure designs are quite constant over the frequency\nrange. There is no resonance over the 110 GHz band.\nDesign 1 is strongly asymmetric; it explains why C1 and C2 (as well as L1 and L2) show different values. The value of C1 and C2 can be correlated to the metal that surrounds the signal pad, which is why capacitances of design 2 (which is\ndesigned for 50-\u00b5m probe pitch) are twice the capacitances\nof design 1. Moreover, for the same design, a difference\nbetween L1 and L2 is visible. It is caused by the different RF probe tip positioning on the pads at port 1 and port 2, resulting in an unequal distance from the center of the test\nstructure. The sensitivity to the probe tips positioning is one\nof the main drawbacks of probe-tip calibration methods,\nsuch as the SOLT calibration used in this work.\nFig. 8 shows the C12 capacitances of the three test structure designs. It appears that in all three cases, the\ncapacitance value starts to drop after 80 GHz. This behavior\nis certainly due to the signature of the Picoprobe RF probes,\nsince it has already been observed both in EM simulation\nand measurement in [13], where Picoprobe RF probes were\nalso used.\nThe capacitance in design 1 is not constant (up to\n80 GHz), this indicates that coupling (with substrate or\nadjacent structures) still occurs. The probe-to-probe distance\nis different in the three test structure designs which explains\nthe difference between the C12 capacitances values."

            "text": "110 GHz\nThe InP DHBT were measured at VCE = 1.6 V and different collector current densities JC (from 0.25 mA/\u00b5m\u00b2 to 9 mA/\u00b5m\u00b2). This chosen value of VCE is a trade-off to combine high values of both fMAX and fT. Open-short deembedding is performed to extract the performances of the\ndevice.\nThe extraction results of fT are shown in Fig. 9. The extraction of fT up to 110 GHz gives pretty similar results between the three designs.\nOn the other hand, extraction of the maximum\noscillation frequency fMAX is more challenging and is sensitive to the design (see Fig. 10). Design 1 leads to an\ninaccurate extraction of fMAX, certainly due to a combined effect of crosstalk between ports and additional coupling effects for using this non-optimized RF test structure design.\nThe industrial design 3 produces results comparable to the\noptimized design 2 for the extraction of fMAX up to 70 GHz. This confirms the satisfying tradeoff made in design 3\nbetween optimization of RF test structures design and high\ndevice density. The drop of the three curves after 70 GHz is attributed to RF probes (and their coupling with structures).\nThis effect is described in [14] where probe effects appear\nafter 40 GHz. In our case, these effects appear at higher\nfrequencies, which is why it is still possible to extract fMAX by fitting a single pole function on the measurements up to 60 GHz (as shown on Fig. 10).\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThree different designs of test structures were explored in order to accurately extract RF figures of merit of InP DHBTs. De-embedding test structures were characterized and transistors RF figures of merit were extracted. The need of optimized test structures for accurate fMAX extraction has been demonstrated. The new design, which maintains a highdensity of transistors (1.75 times of that of design 2) while containing optimized test structures, shows similar performances as the design optimized for 500 GHz measurements (in the 110 GHz range). This work opens new perspectives to high frequency measurements beyond 110 GHz as well as accurate characterization with other RF probes.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by ANR-FNS through ULTIMATE project (ANR-16-CE93-0007) and by the European Commission through the Photonics Public Private Partnership Initiatives under Grant H2020-ICT-2019-2 (Twilight Project).\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
