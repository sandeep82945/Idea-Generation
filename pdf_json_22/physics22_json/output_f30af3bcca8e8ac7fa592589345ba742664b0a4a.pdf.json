    "abstractText": "Realizing a large Land\u00e9 g-factor of electrons in solid-state materials has long been thought of as a rewarding task as it can trigger abundant immediate applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Here, by using metamorphic InAsSb/InSb superlattices (SLs), we demonstrate an unprecedented high value of g \u2248 104, twice larger than that in bulk InSb, and fully spinpolarized states at low magnetic fields. In addition, we show that the g-factor can be tuned on demand from 20 to 110 via varying the SL period. The key ingredients of such a wide tunability are the wavefunction mixing and overlap between the electron andhole states, which have drawn little attention in prior studies. Our work not only establishes metamorphic InAsSb/InSb as a promising and competitivematerial platform for future quantumdevices but also provides a new route toward g-factor engineering in semiconductor structures.",

Here, by using metamorphic InAsSb/InSb superlattices (SLs), we demonstrate an unprecedented high value of g \u2248 104, twice larger than that in bulk InSb, and fully spinpolarized states at low magnetic fields. In addition, we show that the g-factor can be tuned on demand from 20 to 110 via varying the SL period. The key ingredients of such a wide tunability are the wavefunction mixing and overlap between the electron andhole states, which have drawn little attention in prior studies. Our work not only establishes metamorphic InAsSb/InSb as a promising and competitivematerial platform for future quantumdevices but also provides a new route toward g-factor engineering in semiconductor structures.\nSemiconductor structures with large Land\u00e9 g-factors and highly spinpolarized states are pivotal for many quantum device applications. On the one hand, realizing spin-polarized states in high-mobility nonmagnetic semiconductors is key to spintronics1,2. Spin relaxation in such systems can be largely suppressed, and spin precession can be controlled in a coherent manner. On the other hand, large g-factors in strongly spin-orbit coupled (SOC) semiconductors provide the ideal platform for topological-qubit-based quantum computing3, quantum communication4, and nonreciprocal spin photonics5. Here, the topological phase transition and the interplay of electron spin and photon can be manipulated by the Zeeman energy induced by the external magnetic field.\nConventionally, the g-factor engineering in nonmagnetic semiconductors is guided by the Roth formula6,7\ng = ge 4\u0394\n3m0Eg \u00f0Eg +\u0394\u00de \u2223PCV \u2223\n2, \u00f01\u00de where m0 is the free electron mass, ge \u2248 2 is the free electron gfactor, Eg is the band gap, \u0394 is the SOC energy, and PCV is the momentummatrix element taken between the conduction (CB) and valence band (VB) states. To increase the absolute value of the gfactor, high \u0394 and \u2223PCV\u22232, and low Eg are needed, among which the band gap is the easiest to manipulate and can be brought to zero through the use of semiconductor structures such as quantumwells (QWs) or superlattices (SLs). However, this formula fails when Eg\u219208, and the relation between the g-factor and Eg has not yet been systematically studied in the narrow-gap limit both experimentally and theoretically. When Eg\u21920, the mixing of the CB and VB states inevitably occurs, which suppresses the g-factor. Additionally, the electron-hole (e-h) wavefunction overlap is another important factor to consider9\u201312. In QWs and SLs, the electron and hole wavefunctions may center at different locations/layers, resulting in reduced \u2223PCV\u2223. As we will show, the strong mixing of the CB and heavy-hole (HH) bands and the reducing e-h wavefunction overlap\nReceived: 13 October 2021\nAccepted: 16 September 2022\nCheck for updates\n1School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA. 2National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, FL 32310, USA. 3Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. 4Department of Physics, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, USA. 5These authors contributed equally: Yuxuan Jiang, Maksim Ermolaev. e-mail: zhigang.jiang@physics.gatech.edu; sergey.suchalkin@stonybrook.edu\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5960 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\ncan explain the limited improvement in the electron g-factor in InAs/GaSb QW bilayers despite a small Eg13.\nTo better understand the relation between the band structure (and the wavefunction) and the resulting g-factor, we take advantage of the design flexibilities in InAsSb/InSb SLs. The first advantage is the tunable band gaps in InAsSb/InSb type-II SLs via composition ordering on virtual substrate (VS)14. It is known that composition ordering, via controlling the atomic order in material\u2019s composition profile, can drastically change the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor structures15\u201319. However, spontaneous ordering in InAsSb is difficult to control, and the maximum size of spontaneously ordered domains is reported to be only about 100 nm20. Instead, we employ the engineered ordering based on the VS molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) technique14, which enables the synthesis of high-quality crystalline materialswith a tunableband structure19,21,22. TheVS technique canalso accommodate a large lattice constant mismatch between the semiconductor structure and the (physical) substrate, resulting in intriguing electronic states that otherwise are inconceivable with the conventional pseudomorphic growth.\nSecond,wecanadjust themixing of theCB andVB states and their wavefunction overlap in InAsSb/InSb SLs by changing the band discontinuity through strain engineering or the SL period23. In this work, by changing the period of InAsSb/InSb SLs (that is, the thickness of the InAsSb and InSb layers in one period), we achieve an unprecedented high g-factor of g \u2248 104 within a widely tunable range of 20 to 110 and high spin polarization in a practically accessible magnetic field. Most saliently, by combining the magneto-infrared (magneto-IR) spectroscopy study of such SLs with k\u22c5p calculations, we find a four-band model that connects the effective g-factor with the material\u2019s band parameters at low magnetic fields. Our model analysis shows that the effective g-factor and the CB-HH mixing exhibit a concurrent change\nwith the SL period, resulting from the momentum matrix average between the electron and hole bands. Our work establishes InAsSb/ InSb SLs as an ideal platform for g-factor engineering and achieving an unprecedented large g-factor for future quantum device applications."

Each InAs0.48Sb0.52 layer is under ~1.1% tensile strain, while each InSb layer is under ~2% compressive strain. The choice of the composition best matches the lattice constant in the VS yet is close to the bowing minimum of the band gap24. In the discussion below, we will focus on two samples, 1445 and 1446, with a short period of 4-nm/2.25-nm and 5-nm/2.82-nm, respectively. Additional data on sample 1444 (3-nm/ 1.69-nm) can be found in the Supplementary Note 1.\nFigure 1a shows the epistructure of 1445. The high sample quality is evidenced with the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Fig. 1b and the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) image of Fig. 1c. From the eight-band k\u22c5p calculation, we expect 1445 to have a normal band gap while 1446 a slightly inverted one, as shown in the calculated energy dispersion in Fig. 1e. The in-plane band structure near \u0393 point is also plotted for 1445 in Fig. 1d.\nExperimental results and comparison with k\u22c5p model To accurately determine the band structure, we have performed magneto-IR absorption measurements and compared the experimental results with k\u22c5p calculations. Such a combination is an effective approach to study III-V semiconductors, as, for example, shown in ref. 25.

Both samples exhibit a series of spectral dips (i.e., absorptions) blueshifting with increasing magnetic field. These well-developed dips can be attributed to specific inter-Landau-level (inter-LL) transitions in SLs. By tracing the magnetic field dependence of these transitions, we can extract the corresponding LL spectrum and determine the band structure at zero field.\nPractically, to extract the material\u2019s band parameters from the experimental data,we first calculate the Landau fandiagramof each SL at \u0393point using the k\u22c5pmodel.Details of the calculation canbe found in the Supplementary Note 2. The magnetic field dispersion of the calculated LLs is plotted in Fig. 2b,d, where the LLs (solid lines) are colorcoded based on their Pidgeon-Brown index n26. The LL transition energy can then be calculated by noting the conventional selection rule\u0394n = \u00b1 127, and the first six low-lying transitions are labeled by black arrows in Fig. 2b,d. Next, we can fit all the transitions observed in our experimentwith themodel calculation. The black dash lines in Fig. 2a,c show the best fits to the data. Excellent agreementwith the experiment is achieved. The resulting band parameters (fitting parameters) for the InAs1\u2212xSbx alloys with x =0.52 and x = 1.00 are listed in the SupplementaryTables 1 and2.Wenote that in thefittingprocess, we employ a single set of band parameters for both SL samples. Hence, their difference in band structure (normal versus inverted) is solely caused by the different layer thicknesses in the SL period.\nFrom the fitting, we also see that the observed absorptiondips are mostly due to the interband LL transitions between the CB and HH bands. Both samples have a small band gap, which is 11meV and 20meV for 1445 and 1446, respectively. However, the lowest LLs in CB and HH of 1446 cross at around 6 T (Fig. 2d) while the crossing is absent in 1445 (Fig. 2b). Such a crossing behavior is characteristic of an inverted band. Another indication for the band inversion lies in the cyclotron resonance transition T1. The T1 energy in the inverted SL has a weaker magnetic field dependence than that in the normal SL, owing to the stronger mixing of the hole components into the CB. Therefore, we conclude that 1445 is in the normal regime (i.e., positive band gap) while 1446 is in the inverted regime (i.e., negative band gap).\nCircular polarization-resolved measurements can further support our k\u22c5p model. In the Pidgeon-Brown formalism26, LL transitions following different selection rules (\u0394n = \u00b1 1) can be distinguished using the right (\u03c3+) and left (\u03c3\u2212) circularly polarized light27. Figure 3 shows the false color plots of the relative transmission T(B)/T(0) of sample 1446 as a function of energy andmagnetic field under the excitation of \u03c3+ (Fig. 3a) and \u03c3\u2212 (Fig. 3b) light. The designed energy range for our broadband\nquarter-wave plate is between 100\u2013155meV, while considerable polarization contrast is also evidenced between 155\u2013200meV. Therefore, within this range (100\u2013200meV), the\u0394n = + 1 and \u0394n = \u22121 LL transitions are expected to exhibit a stronger absorption in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Indeed, as one can see from Fig. 3, the T3 and T4 transitions are invisible between 100\u2013155meV under \u03c3+ light but display strong absorption under \u03c3\u2212 light. A similar observation can also bemade for all the higher LL transitions, particularly T5, T6, and T7. The observed polarization dependence of these transitions agrees well with the theoretical prediction, thus lending strong support to our model.\nIt is worth noting that the circular polarization-resolved measurements (Fig. 3) may have revealed some spectral features hidden in the unpolarizedmeasurements (Fig. 2). One is the slow changingmode TLH at around 160meV in Fig. 3a that we attribute to the LL transition from the n = 0 LL of the LH bands to the n = 1 LL of the HH bands. The other is the (nearly) magnetic field independent dip T*, centered\nFig. 2 | Magneto-IR absorption spectra and the corresponding LL transitions. a False colormapofmagneto-absorption at different energies for sample 1445.

            "text": "Next, we discuss the spin polarization and effective g-factors in these narrowband gapSLs.We limit the discussion to theCB and its low field behaviors (i.e., B\u22641 T), which is readily accessible in practical applications. The spin polarization of each LL can be obtained by summing up the corresponding spin components in the eigenfunction. The calculation details can be found in Supplementary Note 3. Figure 4a,c duplicate the low-lying LLs of samples 1445 and 1446 at low magnetic fields but color-coded based on their dominant spin polarization. That is, blue and red denote spin down and up, respectively. The corresponding total spin-up component P\u2191 of each LL is summarized in Fig. 4b,d, whereall low-lying LLs exhibit a nearly 100% spinpolarization at low fields. We can understand the high spin polarization as the consequenceof the decoupling between two spin states19. Since the LH and split-off (SO) bands are relatively far away from the CB and do not interact with the HH, the wavefunction of interest is dominated by the CB and HH components. The full k\u22c5p Hamiltonian around \u0393 point can then be reduced to two decoupled 2 \u00d7 2 diagonal matrices, each of which is spanned by the CB and HH components of the same spin. The low-lying LLs thus preserve a high spin polarization at low magnetic fields.\nThe high spin polarization in LLs also justifies the discussion of the effective g-factor. Conventionally, the g-factor of themth LL is defined as28\ng*m = E\"m E#m\n\u03bcBB , \u00f02\u00de\nwhere E\"#m is the energy of the spin-split LLs and \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton. However, the pairing of spin-split LLs may become\nambiguous for narrow-gap materials due to the presence of the unpaired 0th LL. For example, in Fig. 4c, it is not clear whether LL2 should be paired with LL1 or LL0 . A more natural way to consider the band splitting is through a four-band model widely adopted for topological semimetals and insulators8,29,30\nH0\u00f0k\u00de= M\u00f0k\u00de Ak + 0 0 Ak M\u00f0k\u00de 0 0 0 0 M\u00f0k\u00de Ak 0 0 Ak + M\u00f0k\u00de 0 BBB@ 1 CCCA: \u00f03\u00de\nThe basis for InAsSb zinc-blende semiconductor is \u00bdj+ , \"i,j , \"i,j+ , #i,j , #i 31, where \u00b1 denotes the orbitals and \u2191\u2193 the spin directions. Additionally, k = (kx, ky, kz) is the wave vector, k\u00b1 = kx \u00b1 iky, A = \u210fvF, and M\u00f0k\u00de=M0 M1\u00f0k2x + k2y\u00de. Here, \u210f is the reduced Planck constant, vF is the Fermi velocity, M0 is related to the band gap Eg = 2M0, and M1 is the parabolic band component arisen from interactions between theCBandother bands32. In Supplementary Note 6,we further show that the four-bandmodel can be reduced from the eight-band k\u22c5p model in the subspace of CB and HH.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field (along the z-direction), the Zeeman effect is included by adding a diagonal matrixHZ = \u03bcBB[g0, g0, \u2212g0, \u2212g0]/2 with g0 being the g-factor induced by the remote bands away from CB and VB8. The corresponding LLs of the model read\nEsm=0 = s\u00f0M0 M1k2B + 1 2 g0\u03bcBB\u00de, Esm\u22600 = s\u00f0 M1k2B + 1 2 g0\u03bcBB\u00de+\u03b1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2_2v2Fmk 2 B + \u00f0M MB\u00de2 q ,\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere s = \u00b1 1 is the spin index, \u03b1 = \u00b1 1 is the band index, kB = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi eB=_ p is the inverse magnetic length with e being the elementary charge, and MB =2mM1k 2 B is the field-induced gap. Interestingly, besides g0, theM1 parameter leads to a linear-in-B LL splitting, which can be translated\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:5960 4\ninto a g-factor by\ng1 = 2M1k\n2 B\n\u03bcBB = 2 eM1 _\u03bcB : \u00f05\u00de\nTherefore, we arrive at a total effective g-factor geff = g0 + g1. Next, wewill simply fit the k\u22c5p resultswith the four-bandmodel to extract the corresponding geff values.\nFigure 4a, c show the fitting results between the effective Hamiltonian H0 of the four-band model (dash lines) and the k\u22c5p calculations (solid lines) for the low-lying CB LLs of samples 1445 and 1446 at low magnetic fields. Additional fitting can be found in the Supplementary Note 4. As one can see, all the LL splittings can be well described by a single, universal g-factor, in contrast to the LL index and B-dependent g-factors in previous studies of the narrow-gap semiconductors with weak non-parabolicity28. Such a g-factor is convenient for comparison between different materials.\nFrom the fitting, we can further extract the band parameters in InAsSb/InSb SLs with a fixed thickness ratio (i.e., tInAsSb/tInSb \u2248 1.8, which is the case for all three samples studied). In this way, we keep the SL strain compensated while tuning the band structure and e-h wavefunction overlap via changing the period (tperiod = tInAsSb + tInSb = 1.6tInAsSb). The extracted band parameters can well describe the electronic structure of all three samples measured and predict the properties of similar SLs with different periods. The resulting band edge, effective g-factor, and Fermi velocity are shown in Fig. 5a, b as a function of tInAsSb. Specifically, the extracted g-factor for samples 1445 and 1446 is 78 and 55, respectively. The error analysis of the g-factors is described in the Supplementary Note 5. We note that as the SL period increases, the system changes from the normal to the inverted regime, with a zero band gap occurring at tInAsSb \u2248 4.4 nm. For geff (method 1, defined by Eq. (2) above), it saturates at around 110 in the shortperiod limit and gradually decreases to 20 across the normal to inverted band transition. The maximum g-factor is about twice larger than that in the composite materials, gInAsSb \u2248 gInSb\u22485533,34. We further note that although a large g-factor of g \u2248 117 was recently proposed in InAs0.4Sb0.6\n35 using the Roth formula with very optimistic band parameters, our work presents the first experimental realization of g \u2248 104 (in sample 1444, Supplementary Note 1) in nonmagnetic semiconductors.\nMoreover, the ability to tune g-factors in a wide range is intriguing. We can attribute such a tunability to the wavefunction mixing between the CB and HH bands. To understand this, one can consider a\nfour-bandmodel with CB and HH components only. Their LLs are then strictly spin degenerate. To introduce spin splitting, the wavefunction mustmixwith additional band characters such as the LHandSObands. In III-V semiconductors, since HH does not interact with LH and SO, one can easily imagine that if the wavefunction has more of the CB component (than the HH component), then it will mix in more of the LH component in a magnetic field, leading to stronger splitting, and vice versa. Using the Kane energy and the band gap between CB and HH, we can estimate the CB component in the wavefunction at 1 T by using a two-band k \u22c5 pmodel and the result is shown in Fig. 5c. Here, the wavefunction is completely dominated by the CB component in the short-period limit, concurrent with the saturated g-factors in Fig. 5b (method 1). As the SL period increases, the HH band moves closer to the CB (Fig. 5a), and eventually, the HH becomes dominant in the inverted regime. Due to the reduced CB-LH interactions in this regime, the g-factor is suppressed and can become even lower than that in composite materials. Overall, as shown in Fig. 5b,c, the g-factor (method 1) and the CB component follow a similar trend as increasing the SL period and with a comparable degree of reduction. This picture is further supported by the Supplementary Notes 4 and 6, whereby extending the fitting in Fig. 4a,c to a higher magnetic field, we show that geff is dominated by the g1 (orM1) parameter, and M1 is related to the CB-LH and CB-SO interactions.\nBefore closing, two additional points need to be made. First, the e-h wavefunction overlap also plays a role in g-factor engineering in InAsSb/InSb SLs. It is reflected in the weight of the off-diagonal matrix elements describing the interactions between different bands and hence leads to the modification of the Fermi velocity vF19,36 and gfactor. In the inset to Fig. 5b, we plot the vF as a function of the SL period and find that the vF decreases gradually across the normal to inverted band transition. This behavior is consistent with the reduced wavefunction overlap between the CB and HH bands in our SLs across the transition. However, such an effect seems relatively weak compared to the wavefunction mixing effect described above, as the change in the vF (~35%) ismuch less than that in the g-factor (~83%), and the change in wavefunction overlap between CB and HH is the largest among all across the transition.\nSecond, the g-factor defined above with the four-band model (method 1) is proportional to the M1 parameter, as shown in Eq. (5). Sucha g-factor is related to the splitting of LLswith the same index (Eq. (2)). However, as the g-factor increases, if the Zeeman splitting becomes larger than the energy spacing between adjacent LLs, it leads to an alternative definition (method 2). That is, one can follow a specific LL and define the g-factor from the splitting with the closest LL of\nFig. 5 | Tunable effective g-factors. a Evolution of the energy bands (CB, HH, and LH) as a function of the SL period (tperiod= tInAsSb + tInSb = 1.6tInAsSb), calculated using the band parameters extracted from the experiment. b Evolution of the effective gfactors for the CB, extracted using two different methods, as a function of tInAsSb.

The extracted g-factors using these twomethods are summarized in Fig. 5b as a function of the SL period. As one can see, the twomethods agree well before entering the short-period limit. The difference in the short-period limit is simply caused by choosing a different LL splitting to define the g-factor. Nevertheless, no matter which g-factor definition one uses, a giant gfactor of geff \u2248 110 is expected in our short-period InAsSb/InSb SL samples.\nIn conclusion, using metamorphic strain-compensated InAs0.48Sb0.52/InSb SLs as an example, we demonstrate the feasibility of realizing tunable g-factors and fully spin-polarized states in InAsSb ordered alloys. The VS approach, which was used to grow the SLs, allows for large variations of the SL period while keeping the band gap narrow, enabling key ingredients for obtaining a high g-factor: strong mixing of the CB and VB states and high e-h wavefunction overlap. We show that in narrow-gap InAsSb/InSb SLs, the effective g-factor can be tuned from 20 to 110 simply by changing the SL period. To extract the g-factor, we employ a four-band model that is widely used in topological materials to analyze our magneto-IR spectroscopy results and identify the interactions between the CB and LH/SO bands as the dominant source of the LL (spin) splitting. Ourwork sheds light onhow to band-engineer semiconductor structures with large g-factors for future quantum device applications."

Onehas 160periods; eachperiod includes 4nmof InAs0.48Sb0.52 and 2.25 nm of InSb. The other has 147 periods; 5 nm of InAs0.48Sb0.52 and 2.82 nm of InSb in each period. The structure information of these samples, together with that of the third sample (1444) described in SupplementaryNotes 1, are summarized in Table 1. We note that the number of periods N is sufficiently large in our SL samples such that the electronic structure and g-factor are independent of N but can be tuned by changing the thickness of each SL period. In all samples, the SL is followed by a 200 nm thick Al0.40In0.60Sb top barrier and a cap layer consisting of 4\u20135 periods of the SL to avoid the oxidation of Al-containing barriermaterial. The cap and barriers are p-doped (Be) to ~1016 cm\u22123 for both samples to compensate for the barrier background doping and avoid the formation of two-dimensional carrier \u201cpockets\u201d at the SL interface with the barrier37,38. This compensation doping approach has been implemented in our previouswork24, where nomagneto-absorption features from barriers are observed.\nStructure studies of similar SL samples can be found in Ref. 21, where it is shown that the SLs exhibit a dislocation-free periodic structure but with some interface roughness and compositional\ndisorder. The effects of interface roughness can be modeled as a local random change in the SL layer thickness. Such a lateral thickness fluctuation does not directly contribute to the LL transition energies but leads to the broadening of the transitions21. The broadening is somewhat suppressed in the ternary-binary SLs (InAsSb/InSb) compared with the ternary-ternary ones. In addition, the composition of InAs0.48Sb0.52 layer in our SLs is chosen to be close to the minimum of the band gap bowing curve. It makes the material parameters less sensitive to the fluctuations of the composition."

            "text": "In this work, the SL samples are measured at 5 K using a Fourier transform IR spectrometer connected to a 17.5 T superconducting magnet through a vacuumed light pipe. The magnetic field is applied along the growth direction (zdirection) of the SLs, and the transmitted light is collected by a Si bolometer mounted beneath the sample. By adding a linear polarizer and a broadband quarter-wave plate in the light path, we can perform circular polarization-resolved measurements, which further help to distinguish the optical transitions between different selection rules39,40."
