The suicidal\nprocess has been conceptualized in multiple psychological theories that\nhave aimed to shed light on the interplay of contributing factors. One\nof the central concepts included in both the cubic model of suicide and\nthe three-step theory of suicide is psychological pain (mental pain or\npsychache). Over the two last decades, interest in psychological pain has\nincreased considerably, particularly since the discovery of the complex link\nbetween the pain processing system and the neurobiology of suicide, and\nthe putative antisuicidal effect of buprenorphine. Growing evidence supports\nthe association between experiencing psychological pain and suicidal ideation\nand acts in both clinical and non-clinical samples. However, many questions\nrelated to the concept of psychological pain and its role in prediction of\nsuicidal behavior remain to be answered in future research. In this narrative\nreview, we have outlined the history of the concept, the definition of\npsychological pain, and the tools developed for its measurement, summarized\nthe empirical research on psychological pain in relation to suicidal behavior,\nand suggested future directions for clinical research on psychological pain\nand suicidal behavior.\nKEYWORDS\npsychological pain, suicide, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, psychological theories, psychache\nIntroduction\nSuicide is one of the most important contributors to mortality worldwide, representing one of 10 top leading causes of death in Europe and North America (1) and the central cause for deaths among young people. Understanding the suicidal process and recognizing modifiable risk factors for suicidal behavior are vital for suicide prevention.\nOver the past decades of research on suicidal behavior, a wide range of risk factors for suicidal ideation and acts has been identified in the general population (2) and in psychiatric settings (3, 4). Although risk factors for suicidal ideation may partly differ from those of suicidal acts, having a mental disorder appears to be one of the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nmost consistent factors for both phases of the suicidal process. In European and North American psychological autopsy studies, about 90% of persons ending their life had suffered from a mental disorder and about 60% from mood disorders (5, 6). The presence of a mental disorder is an important but on its own an insufficient precursor for suicidal thoughts and acts, motivating researchers to investigate other underlying mechanisms of the suicidal process.\nAs suicide is defined as the act of intentional ending of one\u2019s life, scrutiny of the intrapsychic events prompting and maintaining the process of emergence of suicidal ideation and progression to action is crucial in suicide research. Numerous psychological theories have been created to explain the suicidal process (for review, see O\u2019Connor et al. (7). These theories provide an important framework to conceptualize the suicidal process and identify potential targets for treatment. Among contemporary psychological theories of suicidal behavior, the most important and empirically tested are Beck\u2019s hopelessness theory (8), the Three-Step Theory (9), the interpersonal theory of suicide (10, 11), the motivational-volitional model of suicidal behavior (12) and the fluid vulnerability theory (13). Although partly different, all of these theories are broadly consistent with a stress-diathesis model of suicide, emphasizing a complex interaction between trait-like vulnerability factors and statedependent stress factors (14). However, despite substantial advancements made in understanding the suicidal mind, prediction of suicidal acts at the individual level is impossible, and only a few evidence-based treatments for suicidal behavior are available. Therefore, there is a need for a more profound understanding of the psychological factors leading to suicide and new treatment targets.\nPsychological pain (mental pain, psychic pain, emotional pain, or psychache) is one of the concepts included in the current psychological theories of suicidal behavior (such as the Three-Step Theory of suicide, 3ST). This term has been known in suicidology literature for decades since Edwin Shneidman\u2019s formulation of the Cubic model of suicide (15), described also in this paper. Shneidman postulated psychache to be the core of the suicidal process, explaining suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicide. Psychological pain is later defined as \u201can extreme and aversive emotionally based feeling, experienced as a lasting, unsustainable condition resulting from a negative appraisal or deficiency of self \u201d (16). According to Shneidman, as psychological pain becomes unbearable, suicide appears to be the only means to stop the painful internal state for some people.\nDuring recent decades insight into the complex associations between processing of pain, emotions, and suicidality has evolved. Previous studies have shown a significant overlap in neural systems mediating emotional and physical components of pain (17, 18). The endogenous opioid system is demonstrated to largely participate in processing of human emotions (19) and neurobiology of depression (20). Moreover, the experiences of social rejection or separation, common life events preceding both onset of depression (21) and suicidal behavior (22), seem to\nactivate the brain network influencing the affective and sensory component of pain processing (23). Reduced tonic opioid activity is suggested to be associated with dysphoria and suicidal behavior in patients with borderline personality disorder (24). Finally, a promising randomized controlled trial on potential effect of low-dose buprenorphine on suicidal ideation in patients with depression (25) has reawakened interest in the relation between psychological pain and suicidality, leading to growing empirical research on psychological pain in the suicidal population (26).\nThe only meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between psychological pain and suicidality in both the general population and clinical samples revealed higher psychological pain in subjects with current and lifetime suicide attempts and suicidal ideation (27). However, many questions remain to be elucidated in future research. Among these questions, the predictive value of psychological pain in relation to suicidal ideation requires more prospective studies, and the associations between psychological pain and such well-known risk factors for suicide as a severity of psychiatric pathology or hopelessness in relation to suicidal ideation and acts need to be clarified.\nThe aims of this paper were a) to review the literature on the history of the concept \u201cpsychological pain\u201d and its definition and measurement; b) to briefly review the empirical research on the association between suicidal behavior and psychological pain in both general population and clinical samples; and c) to outline key directions for future psychological research."

            "text": "Edwin Shneidman, an American clinical psychologist and suicidologist, introduced the term \u201cpsychache\u201d and postulated that psychache (psychological pain) is a central precondition for suicide as a result of his intensive 40-year autopsy studies of suicide completers (15). Shneidman stated that the most common sentence in suicide notes was \u201cI can\u2019t stand the pain any longer\u201d, which led him to conclude that suicides are caused by psychache, referring \u201cto the hurt, anguish, soreness, aching, psychological pain in the psyche, the mind\u201d (28), or \u201cthe pain of excessively felt shame, or guilt, or humiliation, or loneliness, or fear, or angst, or dread of growing old, or of\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\ndying badly, or whatever\u201d. \u201cHopelessness\u201d and \u201chelplessness\u201d are common \u201cemotions\u201d involving in suicidal crisis. According to his work, suicide is a conscious practical act intended to stop the unbearable flow of intolerable pain, indicating different individual thresholds for enduring psychological pain. Shneidman hypothesized that psychache is created and sustained by thwarted, unfulfilled, or frustrated psychological needs, referring to a theory of personality (personology) developed by Henry Murray and positing an individual hierarchy of psychological needs driving one\u2019s behavior (29). Among these needs, central in terms of suicide are the need for dominance (to control, influence, and direct others), autonomy (to be independent and free, shake off restraint, to resist coercion and restriction), counteraction (to master a failure or loss by restriving, to obliterate a humiliation by resumed action), succorance (to have one\u2019s needs gratified by the sympathetic aid of another person, to be taken care of and loved), affiliation (to please and win the affection of a respected person), and order (to put things and ideas to order, to achieve arrangements, organization, balance, tidiness, a precision in the outer world or ideas in the inner world).\nShneidman illustrated his model of suicide as a cube with three visible facets, representing three components of this model: \u201cpain,\u201d \u201cperturbation,\u201d and \u201cpress,\u201d the severity of each varying from \u201c1\u201d (\u201clittle pain,\u201d \u201clow perturbation,\u201d and \u201cpositive press\u201d) to \u201c5\u201d (intolerable pain,\u201d \u201chigh perturbation,\u201d and \u201cnegative press\u201d). \u201cPerturbation of the mind\u201d is the state, occurring when an individual experiences an intolerable psychache, and refers to being upset, agitated or perturbed, potentially also indicating the presence of a mental disorder. \u201cPerturbation\u201d includes transient perceptual constriction (a cognitive distortion related to seeing suicide as the only solution for the unbearable pain) and \u201ca penchant for precipitous selfharm or inimical action\u201d (a characteristic akin to impulsivity). \u201cPress\u201d includes both actual and imagined stressors. In this model, only persons scoring 5 in terms of all three components kill him- or herself and alleviating severity of even one of these may reduce the suicide risk."

            "text": "The concept of psychological pain has evolved over time. Roy F. Baumeister in his theory \u201csuicide as escape from self\u201d (30), although not directly using the term \u201cpsychological pain\u201d, referred to a painful awareness of self \u2019s inadequacy, which in turn generates negative emotions and a strong desire to escape this state, bringing irrationality and inhibition, \u201cmaking drastic measures more acceptable\u201d (30). Orbach et al. (31) referred to an \u201cunpleasant feeling of negative changes in the self \u201d and in their studies on student samples using the factor analysis of the 44-item Orbach and Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP) distinguished nine dimensions of psychological pain: loss of control, narcissistic wounds, freezing, irreversibility of pain,\nemotional flooding, estrangement, confusion, social distancing, and emptiness (31). Eisenbeger (32) described \u201csocial pain\u201d \u2013 an intrapsychic unpleasant experience related to actual or potential social rejection or exclusion \u2013 and demonstrated activation of a neutral network involved in the processing of psychic pain. Finally, Meerwiijk (16) suggested a consensual definition of psychological pain as follows: \u201ca lasting, unpleasant, and unsustainable feeling characterized by a perception of inability or deficiency of self \u201d.\nPsychological pain in the Three-Step Theory of suicide\nThe concept of psychological pain is also central in the Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide (33), postulating that the combination of psychological pain and hopelessness causes suicidal ideation. In other words, in contrast to Shneidman\u2019s theory, psychological pain alone is not a sufficient precondition for emergence of suicidal ideation. When pain overwhelms connectedness, suicidal ideation intensifies and progresses to suicide attempts, if the capability of suicide is present. However, as opposed to other theories, the 3ST does not provide a strict definition of psychological pain and the authors emphasize a partial conceptual overlap of psychological pain with other factors often involved in suicidal crisis such as \u201cmost mental disorders,\u201d general distress, financial distress, burdensomeness, etc. Moreover, the concept of psychological pain in the 3ST may also include physical pain (33). Similar to the Cubic model of suicide, the 3ST emphasizes that psychological pain needs to be perceived as unbearable to interplay with hopelessness and result in suicidal ideation.\nThe definition of psychological pain thus remains elusive and seems to overlap with other important concepts in suicide prediction such as \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201chopelessness,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201cgeneral distress,\u201d and even physical pain. All of these factors make measurement of psychological pain and generalizability of study findings challenging."

            "text": "General aspects of measurement in psychiatry\nThe ultimate goal of measurement in psychology and psychiatry is to operationalize theoretical concepts into measurable observations that can be reliably utilized in clinical practice and research. One of the two main characteristics of a measurement tool is its validity, that is, whether the tool measures what it is intended to measure. To define the validity of a measurement tool, several methods can be used, including\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\ncriterion (i.e., the correspondence of a scale to a true state or gold standard), construct (i.e., the consistency between scales having the same theoretical definition in the absence of a gold standard), and content validity (i.e., the completeness of a scale in coverage of a concept) (34). The other major characteristic of a measurement tool is its reliability, that is, whether the assessment tool consistently measures the phenomenon it is intended to measure. The methods commonly used to estimate reliability of a test include test-retest correlation, internal consistency, and inter-rater reliability.\nWhen measuring a relation between a risk factor and an outcome, it is important to account for a) the temporal stability of an outcome and b) state and trait characteristics of a risk factor (35). As suicidal ideation is known to fluctuate over time (36), the predictive value of its proximal risk factors appears also temporally unstable and state-dependent (36\u201338) making repeated measurements essential. A risk factor may represent, however, also a temporally more stable trait-like characteristic, indicating a tendency to experience psychic phenomena over lifetime, helping to identify persons \u201cat risk\u201d. Moreover, both the Cubic model of suicide and 3ST, wherein psychological pain plays a key role, highlight the importance of a person\u2019s ability to tolerate psychological pain, as psychological pain needs to be \u201cunbearable\u201d to evoke the suicidal process. Therefore, in this section, we aimed to describe the most frequently used tools for measurement of psychological pain and to define how a tool assesses a) current psychological pain, b) lifetime tendency to experience psychological pain, and c) tolerability of psychological pain (see Table 1)."

It is an ache in the mind\u201d); (b) an item on the intensity of current psychological pain using the Likert Scale 1-9; (c) the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) (requirement to rate psychological pain that the responder sees in the main characters of five pictures); (d) an item on the worst lifetime psychological pain (Likert Scale 1-9); (e) a requirement to select which of 28 feelings are associated with the worst pain; (f) an item on previous suicide attempts and lethality of the method(s) used; and (g) a requirement to write an essay on the worst psychological pain). The PPAS requires much time to complete and a trained operator to provide and interpret the test. The PPAS does not assess tolerability of psychological pain and includes non-countable items. Moreover, the TAT as well as the essay requirement may be too demanding for patients with severe psychiatric pathology. Several studies utilized the PPAS in clinical samples (40, 41, 42) and one study in a student\nsample (43). Leenaars et al.

In a Turkish study on patients with mood disorders, the MBPPAS showed a good internal consistency (61)."

            "text": "The Unbearable Psychache Scale (UP3) includes three statements on tolerability of psychological pain derived from Holden\u2019s Psychache Scale. The UP3 was also shown to have excellent internal reliability and strong convergent validity by the authors (62). However, the UP3 does not directly assess the intensity of current or previous psychological pain.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nAs many authors have discussed, the validation process of the measurement tools for psychological pain is challenging due to lack of a gold standard. Some authors have used discriminative validity, differentiating healthy controls and patients (55) (61), ideators and non-ideators, and suicide attempter and non-attempters (44, 55), convergent validity (with measures of depression or anxiety) (44, 55, 58, 61), and, more rarely, concurrent validity methods (61). For example, Demirkol et al. (61)found the correlation between MBPPAS and PAS in patients with depression to be only 0.484. Numerous measurement tools theorize psychological pain in their own way, but data on the congruency of these tools is sparse. In other words, it is not evident whether these assessment tools measure the same psychic phenomena.\nOverall, although multiple measurement tools for psychological pain are currently available, some of these (PPAS, OMMP) are time-consuming and require an experienced operator to administer and interpret the tests. Some of the tools assess intensity of current (e.g., PPAS, OMMP, PPP-VAS, and MBPPAS) and lifetime psychological pain (e.g., PPAS and MBPPAS), while others assess tolerability of psychological pain (PAS, MBPPAS, UP3), a component that is considered crucial in Shneidman\u2019s theory and 3ST.\nResearch on psychological pain predicting suicidal ideation and acts\nAlthough efforts have been made to elucidate mechanisms of psychological pain (53, 63), no consistent biomarkers for psychological pain exist. Therefore, understanding of associations between psychological pain and suicidal behavior relies on clinical observation.\nResearch on psychological pain and suicidality has grown notably since 1994 (26). The meta-analysis of Ducasse et al. (27) reviewed 20 observational cross-sectional case-control studies examining the difference in psychological pain between individuals with and without current or lifetime history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, revealing higher psychological pain in both subjects with current and lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (27). As the authors noted that the association between psychological pain and suicidality remained significant even when depression levels were not different between subjects.\nWhen examining risk factors for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or completed suicide, the prospective nature of the study, among other factors, is important. Prospective studies allow not only estimation of the predictive value of a risk factor in relation to an outcome but also examination ofe its associations with other known risk factors. While numerous cross-sectional studies on associations between psychological\npain and suicidal behavior exist, we identified only several follow-up studies that are briefly outlined below.\nStudies including non-clinical samples\nIn a two-year prospective study with high-risk undergraduates who completed the PAS, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) (64) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (65) at baseline and two years later, a strong correlation emerged between PAS, BDI, and BHS (66). In a linear regression analysis, predicting suicidal ideation both at baseline and during a two-year follow-up, only psychache remained statistically significant, while depression and hopelessness became nonsignificant after controlling for psychache. Similar results emerged in another four-year prospective study on psychache and suicide ideation in 82 undergraduates (67). A longitudinal study on 611 undergraduate students identified that changes in both psychache (measured with PAS) and hopelessness predicted changes in suicidal ideation at the four-month follow-up. The authors hypothesized that psychache plays a mediating role in the relation between hopelessness and suicidal ideation (68).\nStudies including clinical samples\nProspective studies on psychological pain and suicidal behavior in clinical samples are briefly overviewed in Table 2.\nIn a prospective cohort study of 153 psychiatric inpatients (mean follow-up 5.6 years), psychological pain, measured by the OMMP, did not predict future suicide attempt, as opposed to levels of depression and hopelessness (69).\nA prospective study on validity of the 3ST included 190 psychiatric inpatients (including patients with mood, personality and psychotic disorders) and assessed psychological pain with the UP3 at three time points (baseline and at 4 weeks and 3 months postdischarge). The authors showed a strong correlation between psychological pain and hopelessness, and, even more strongly, low belongingness and burdensomeness. To support the validity of the 3ST, the authors demonstrated that the interaction of the UP3 and BHS explained 68% of the variance in suicidal desire at baseline, even after controlling for depression and checking for multicollinearity. Moreover, psychological pain at baseline predicted suicidal desire at the 4-week (r = 0.53) and 3-month (r = 0.51) time points. When controlling for baseline depression and lifetime ideation, the partial correlations between baseline psychological pain and suicidal desire slightly decreased: at 4 weeks (rp = 0.29, p = 0.002) and 3 months (rp = 0.38, p < 0.001). Moreover, no statistical interaction between pain and hopelessness was found in the prediction of future suicidal desire at either the 4-week or 3-month time point (70).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 2 Prospective studies on psychological pain in psychiatric patients.\nStudy Sample characteristics Assessment of psychological pain\nFollow-up time Key findings\nTrakhtenbrot et al. (69)\n153 psychiatric inpatients with mood disorders and\nschizophrenia\nOMMP (mean) 5.6 years Depression and hopelessness, but not mental pain, predicted a\nfollow-up attempt.

(56)\n372 inpatients with major depressive disorder\nPPP-VAS 1 year Depression severity and worst physical pain predicted reporting\npsychological pain. Changes in depression severity and physical pain predicted a change in psychological pain.

(72) 108 psychiatric patients with major depressive disorder and\nbipolar disorder from the ketamine clinical trial\nA Negative Cognition Score 3 \u2013 11 days Psychological pain and hopelessness were not associated with suicidal ideation in the 3- or\n11-day analyses.\nAlacreu-Crespo et al. (57) in their one-year follow-up study on 372 inpatients with mood disorders reported that after adjusting for depressive symptomology (history of previous suicide events, medication, and psychiatric comorbidity) the patients with higher worst psychological pain in the 15 days (assessed with PPP-VAS) at baseline had higher odds for suicidal events (including suicide deaths, suicide attempts, and hospitalizations due to suicidal ideation) during the one-year follow-up (OR = 1.27) (57). The authors also noted that patients with a recent suicide attempt report higher worst psychological pain during last 15 days (assessed with PPP-VAS) than non-attempters and past suicide attempters, even after adjusting for psychic pain and depression. Moreover, depression severity, along with physical\npain, but not hopelessness, predicted high psychological pain, and changes in depression severity predicted changes in psychological pain during follow-up. In addition, such depression symptoms as guilt, lack of initiative, and loss of appetite explained maximal psychological pain in patients with mood disorders (56).\nFinally, the latest report from a prospective study on 108 psychiatric patients recruited into a ketamine clinical trial showed that psychological pain [measured by a Negative Cognition score, comprising items from different depression scales (71)] and hopelessness were not prospectively associated with re-emerging suicidal ideation after ketamine infusions in short-term (3 days) or long-term (11 days) analyses (72).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nOverall, clinical research with a prospective design on the association between psychological pain and suicidal behavior is sparse. The studies are methodologically highly heterogeneous and have yielded controversial results."

            "text": "The concept of psychological pain is complex, and its definition remains elusive. The conceptualization of psychological pain differs among psychological theories, resulting in a high number of different measurement tools, the congruency of which needs to be elucidated. The measurement tools used in the prospective studies on the association between psychological pain and the suicidal process interpret psychological pain within their theoretical frames, not necessarily overlapping in terms of content (e.g., PAS and OMMP). Moreover, while the PAS and OMMP define psychological pain by multiple explicit items, the PPP-VAS does not define psychological pain at all, i.e., patients understand the concept in their own way. In addition, the time frame of the assessment tools is not identical. For example, while the PAS does not specify intensity of the psychological pain \u201cat the moment,\u201d the PPP-VAS and OMMP assess current psychological pain. The UP3 does not assess the intensity of current psychological pain, rather how unbearable the current psychological pain is. Additionally, although two theories, the cubic model of suicide and the 3ST, highlight that psychological pain should be unbearable to cause suicidal ideation (in combination with hopelessness in the 3ST), few measurement tools assess how unbearable the current pain actually is. Thus, as the congruent validity of the measurement tools is uncertain, generalization of the findings from these studies may be questionable."

            "text": "The risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts overlap but are partly different (4). Therefore, the predictive value of psychological pain in relation to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts should be assessed separately in future studies.\nTiming of measurement of psychological pain\nTemporal variability of a risk factor should be considered when assessing its predictive value in terms of suicidal behavior (35). While a trait factor representing vulnerability for suicidality can be used to identify patients at risk regardless of the time of the measurement, a state factor represents a disorder-related characteristic. Thus, timing of measurement may be crucial for obtaining valid estimates of risk for temporally variable, state-related risk factors. For example, in our five-year prospective study of patients with depressive disorders, we showed that hopelessness, an evident risk factor for completed suicide, displays a notable temporal variability, worsening during depression and alleviating (but not always fully disappearing) after recovery (73). As psychological pain seems also to grow when severity of depression increases (56), the predictive value of psychological pain may be different during depression than during recovery. Ultimately, it is important to know whether and how much systematic estimation of psychological pain in currently depressed patients with mood disorders improves the clinician\u2019s ability to predict suicide. We are not aware of any studies examining trait and state characteristics of psychological pain in psychiatric patients. In other words, it remains unknown whether experiencing psychological pain is a short-term predictor of suicidality or whether a lifetime tendency of experiencing psychological pain indicates a vulnerability to suicidality.\nEcological momentary assessment (EMA) studies have demonstrated that many known risk factors seem to predict changes in suicidal ideation over months or years, but do not predict over hours and days (36), although findings are not consistent (38). Whether psychological pain plays a role in short-term prediction of suicidal ideation and suicide events is a topic for future EMA studies. Understanding whether psychological pain represents a state or trait characteristic (or both) may help researchers to delineate a place for psychological pain in suicide prediction.\nConceptual overlap with other risk factors for suicide\nThe strong correlations between hopelessness, depression, and psychological pain, reported by numerous studies,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\nare probably underpinned by partial conceptual overlap between these psychic phenomena. Therefore, when assessing predictive value of psychological pain in relation to suicidal behavior, it is important to elucidate the interactions between psychological pain, depression, and hopelessness. We have previously demonstrated that the predictive value of hopelessness in terms of suicidal ideation notably decreased after adjusting for depression severity (37). The current evidence of the relation between severity of depression, hopelessness, and psychological pain is scarce and partly controversial, requiring elucidation in different clinical samples.\nPsychological pain in patients with borderline personality disorder\nPsychological pain may present differently in different diagnostic samples. Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are known to display affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood (74) with an intense episodic dysphoria commonly associated with interpersonal disputes (75). A recent cross-sectional observational study on 2,137 psychiatric patients indicated that suicide attempters had a higher risk for reporting worse mental pain (assessed by the PPP-VAS) and having BPD. In this study, mental pain mediated the relation between childhood traumatic experiences, an important etiological factor also in BPD, and suicide attempts (76). Previously we have shown that features of BPD mediate the total effect of childhood maltreatment on lifetime suicide attempts in patients with mood disorders (77). Thus, both mental pain and BPD represent a risk factor for suicide attempts, and both associated with childhood traumatic experiences. Moreover, opioid system dysfunction is suggested to serve a crucial role in alerted affiliative behavior of patients with BPD (24). In other words, these patients may experience more intensive psychological pain associated with interpersonal conflicts or rejection, increasing their vulnerability for suicidal behavior. Evidence supporting this is, however, scanty, and partly inconsistent (78, 79), motivating future investigations."

            "heading": "Tolerance of psychological pain",
            "text": "Finally, the cubic model of suicide and the 3ST postulate that psychological pain needs to be experienced as unbearable to launch the suicidal process. Therefore, future research should elucidate whether measurement of individual capacity to tolerate psychological pain would be a better predictor of suicidality than measurement of the current intensity of psychological pain. An improvement in capacity to tolerate\npsychological pain may thus be an important target for suicide prevention.\nTo conclude, the concept of psychological pain has received much attention over the last decades, likely representing an important modifiable risk factor for suicidal behavior, but its role in prediction of suicidal ideation and suicidal acts must be clarified. Challenges related to research on psychological pain may be the term\u2019s variable definition and differences in its conceptualization by different psychological schools, resulting in numerous measurement tools. Some of these currently available measurement tools include large numbers of items, which may be demanding for clinical use, and only a few assess the tolerability of psychological pain, a crucial factor in theoretical models. There is also a conceptual overlap with well-known robust risk factors for suicidal behavior, such as \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201chopelessness,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d and even physical pain, indicating a significant correlation and eventual covariation of psychological pain with these risk factors. Therefore, the definition of psychological pain, its common conceptualization by patients and clinicians, and distinguishing it from, for example, emotional and cognitive constructs related to depression or anxiety may be difficult and should be elucidated in subsequent studies. Estimating its predictive value for suicidal ideation and acts in different diagnostic groups of psychiatric patients independently of the robust risk factors (severity of depression, hopelessness, anxiety, etc.) should be a core goal for future research."
