    "abstractText": "Structural correlations between colloids in a binary mixture of charged and uncharged spheres are calculated using computer simulations of the primitive model with explicit microions. For aqueous suspensions in a solvent of large dielectric constant, the traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Vervey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of linear screening, supplemented with hard core interactions, reproduces the structural correlations obtained in the full primitive model quantitatively. However for lower dielectric contrast, the increasing Coulomb coupling between the microand macroions results in strong deviations. We find a fluid-fluid phase separation into two regions either rich in charged or rich in uncharged particles which is not reproduced by DLVO theory. Our results are verifiable in scattering or real-space experiments on chargeduncharged mixtures of colloids or nanoparticles.",

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "There are, in principle, two mechanisms to stabilize colloidal suspensions against\nirreversible flocculation, namely charge-stabilization and steric stabilization [1\u20133]. In\nthe former case, the colloidal particles are highly charged releasing counterions into the\nsolvent such that they repel each other by electrostatics which is traditionally described\nby a screened Coulomb interaction. In the latter situation of steric stabilization, the\ncolloidal particles are typically coated with polymer brushes causing repulsive entropic\ninteraction forces which stabilize against flocculation. While the effective interactions\nand structural correlations in strongly interacting colloidal fluids are by now well-\nunderstood in one-component or even polydisperse systems of either charged [4\u201310]\nor uncharged colloidal spheres [11\u201313], much less is known about binary mixtures of\ncharged and uncharged particles. Such binary neutral-charged systems occur frequently\nin mixtures of colloids with nanoparticles culminating in the charged nanoparticle-halo\neffect around neutral colloids which provides colloidal stabilization [14\u201328]. Moreover,\nin ordinary mixtures of charged colloids the particle charge can be tuned by the pH of\nthe solution [29\u201331] such that one component stays charged and the other can become\nneutral close to the isoelectric point realizing a charged-uncharged colloidal system.\nFurther examples are uncharged spherical vesicles exposed to charged colloids [32] and\nmixtures of charged nanoparticles and neutral spherical bacteria [33].\nAbout 30 years ago, first theoretical calculations were performed for a binary\nmixture of charged and uncharged spheres [34]. The results were based on a Yukawa\nmodel for the interaction between charged particles and a simple excluded hard sphere\ninteraction between the charged-neutral and neutral-neutral spheres as predicted by\nstandard DLVO-theory of linear screening applied to such a mixture. Liquid integral\nequation closures were then used to compute the partial pair correlation functions\n[23, 31, 34\u201336]. These studies with effective pairwise interactions give some first insight\ninto the structural correlations but neglect nonlinear effects [37\u201339] beyond linear\nscreening. In general the latter cause effective many-body interactions between the\ncolloids [40, 41]. While earlier studies have employed approximate Poisson-Boltzmann\ntheory (see, e.g. Ref. [38]) and local classical density functional theory for the\ninhomogeneous counterions in the field created by the charged colloids [37,39,42\u201344], it\nhas become possible by now to calculate effective interactions and pair correlations with\nexplicit counterions based on the primitive model (PM) approach of electrolytes [45\u201353]\nwhich includes full nonlinear screening and Coulomb correlations. Though there are\nsimulations for charged mixtures [54\u201357] and even for oppositely charged colloids [55,58],\nto the best of our knowledge a mixture of charged and neutral colloids has not yet been\nsimulated using the primitive model approach with explicit microions on a large scale.\nThe binary colloidal mixture considered in this work can be assumed as a particular\ncase of the charge regulated macroion system investigated in Ref. [59] using mean-field\nformulation.\nIn this paper we close this gap and present computer simulations data for charged\nand uncharged colloidal mixtures and extract their partial pair correlation functions.\nComplementary to earlier studies of the colloidal halo effect [15\u201320, 22], we focus on\nthe case of comparable hard core radii of the two colloidal spheres. Here, we find that\nthe traditional Yukawa-hard sphere model is sufficient to describe the pair correlations\nin aqueous suspensions where the dielectric constant (or relative permittivity) \u01eb of the\nsolvent is pretty high (about 80 for water at room temperature). However, in less polar\nsolvents when \u01eb is reduced by an order of magnitude, the Coulomb coupling without\nscreening between the charge species is getting much stronger resulting in nonlinear\nscreening effects. In this study we show that for \u01eb = 8, the standard Yukawa-hardcore\ninteraction model as proposed in [34] cannot be applied any longer to a charged-\nuncharged mixture. There are significant deviations in the pair correlations. Moreover\nwe predict the existence of fluid-fluid phase separation as documented by divergence in\nthe partial static structure factors at small wave vector. There are two regions either\nrich with charged or with uncharged colloidal particles. This phase separation is absent\nwithin the traditional DLVO-model when combined with excluded volume interactions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the details of our\nprimitive model simulations for the binary colloidal system. The description of the\nparameters used in the different runs is presented in section 3. The results obtained for\nthe partial pair correlation functions, as well as the structure factors, are discussed in\nsection 4 with supplementary snapshots from the simulation boxes documenting phase\nseparation for high Coulomb couplings without screening. In section 5 we explore the\nrole of the core size of neutral colloids on the correlations and we conclude in section 6."

In\norder to handle the long-ranged Coulomb interactions, we use the Lekner summation\nmethod [62\u201364] which takes the real-space particle coordinates as its only input.\nWe produced 4 different primitive model simulation run series Ai, Bi, Ci, and Di,\ni=1,..,3. Each run series consists of three runs: a reference state run with i=1 where all\nmacroions are charged, a binary run with i=2 where one half of macroions are charged\nand the other half is neutral, and another reference run with i=3 which is similar to the\nrun with i=2 but without neutral colloids.

The PM\nsnapshot for the run B1 is separately shown in Figure 2 to make the counterions visible,\nwhich otherwise are hardly visible in Figure 1. A visual inspection of the PM and the\ncorresponding Yukawa-DLVO runs reveals that in both cases the charged and neutral\nmacroions are randomly distributed across the system boundaries. This is an indirect\nindication of the mutual repulsion between the charged macroions.\nA detailed picture of the macroion distribution around a target macroion can be\nachieved by calculating the partial pair correlation functions gij(r), i, j=Z,z, for the charged macroions and neutral colloids. These functions for the run series Ai, Bi, AiY , and BiY are shown in Figure 3. Interestingly, both PM and the corresponding YukawaDLVO runs show similar trends for the charged macroion gZZ(r), such as the position of the first maximum rmax in gZZ(r) for the ground state system (see the green line) shifts to the right for the binary system run (see the black line). The reference runs (see the\npink line) have their rmax in gZZ(r) nearly at the same distance r for the binary runs. Such shifting of rmax to the right from the ground state run to the binary and reference runs clearly signals about a stronger repulsion between the charged colloids in the latter\ncompared to the former run. The stronger repulsion originates from the decreasing of\nthe inverse screening length \u03ba, i.e. from the weaker screening of the macroions in the\nbinary and reference runs.\nThe PM and Yukawa-DLVO simulated gZz(r) and gzz(r) for the charged-neutral\nand neutral-neutral colloids, see the blue line and red lines Figure 3, correspondingly,\nlook practically the same, except having major differences at smaller separations r. At\nr < 1.1\u03c3, the PM simulated gzz(r) and gZz(r) show an upturn and reach higher contact values at r = \u03c3, whereas the related contact values in the Yukawa-DLVO results are\naround one. The higher contact value in the PM simulated gzz(r) is an indication of a pair-like clustering between neutral colloids. We assume that it is the entropic\nforce Fent(r) of the counterions acting on the neighboring neutrals, which pushes them together. The definition of the counterion entropic force acting on the macroions is\nbriefly introduced in Appendix A. Note that this force is absent in the Yukawa-DLVO\nmodel.\nThere is an upturn in gZz(r) at small separations in the PM binary simulations,\nwhich does not appear in the Yukawa-DLVO binary simulations. To understand the\norigin of such short-range association between charged and neutral colloids, we analyze the radial distribution of counterions, \u03c1(i)c (r), around the macroions in Appendix B. As can be seen from Figure B1, both the charged and neutral colloids are wrapped by\nthe screening counterions. This gives rise to effective attraction between charged and\nneutral particles via counterion depletion in the binary PM runs A2 and B2 in Figure 3.\nIn total, because the upturn in gzz(r) and gZz(r) appears at very small separations,\nsuch pairing (or association) is not easy to detect visually in the simulation snapshots\nin Figure 1.\nA1, A2 A1Y,A2Y B1, B2 B1Y,B2Y\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 k 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nS ii (k\n)\n(a)\n0 0.005 0.01 k 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nS ii (k\n)\n(b)\n0 0.005 0.01 k 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nS ij (k\n) (c)\n0 0.005 0.01 k 0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nS ij (k\n)\n(d)\nFigure 4.

The calculated Sij(k) have non-diverging values at small-k, which is pertinent to the random (i.e. no long-range\nclustering) distribution of colloids in the system and indicates a finite compressibility."

The PM snapshots exhibit demixing and clustering in the binary system, whereas such clustering is absent in the binary Yukawa-DLVO runs.\nPartial pair correlation functions gij(r), presented in Figure 6, also confirm the\nclustering in the binary PM runs. First, the height of the first maximum in the PM\nground state gZZ(r) is smaller than its value in the corresponding Yukawa-DLVO ground state, compare the green lines in Figure 6(a) and (b), and in (c) and (d). We believe\nthat this happens because of much stronger macroion charge screening in the PM runs.\nAs a result, strongly screened macroions can easily approach each-other up to small\nseparations in the PM ground state runs. The same scenario is valid for the gZZ(r) in the binary PM runs, compare the black lines in Figure 6(a) and (b), and in (c) and (d).\nThe position of the first maximum rmax in gZZ(r) in the PM binary run is shifted to the left compared to the corresponding Yukawa-DLVO binary run. Moreover, the PM\nsimulated black lines are above the line g = 1 for the entire range of the separation\ndistance r for the run D2, and for r > rmax for the run C2, which is a direct indication of the clustering of binary PM runs.\nSecond, as seen from the blue lines for gZz(r) in Figure 6(a) and (c), there is a\nrepulsion between the charged and neutral colloids resulting in gZz(r) < 1 for r \u2264 4\u03c3. This can be viewed as another confirmation of the demixing in the PM binary runs.\nIn opposite to it, the Yukawa-DLVO binary runs exhibit the macroion-neutral colloid\nassociation at low separation distances where gZz(r) > 1, see Figure 6(b) and (d). A similar association was observed for the run series Ai and Bi in previous section.\nThird, the binary PM results for the neutral-neutral pair correlation function gzz(r),\nsee the red curves in Figure 6(a) and (c), completely differ from the corresponding\nYukawa-DLVO results in Figure 6(b) and (d). Whereas the latter shows no clustering\nat all, the former indicates a strong coagulation effect in the system of neutral colloids\nwith high contact values gzz(\u03c3) \u2248 6.\nTo analyze the origin of the observed clustering in binary PM runs C2 and D2,\nadditional two-macroion simulations were carried out for the runs D1 and D2, see Appendix C for details. The calculated pair interaction potentials show a repulsive\ninteraction UZZ(r) between the charged macroions for the PM runs D1 and D2, see the the upper row in Figure C1(a), and even much stronger repulsion UYZZ(r) in the Yukawa-DLVO runs D1Y and D2Y , see the bottom row in Figure C1(a).\nAs seen from the upper row in Figure C1(b), the calculated cross interaction\npotential UZz(r) between the charged macroion and a neutral colloid is always positive. It has a shallow minimum at small separations and a repulsive barrier at larger distances.\nThis repulsive barrier is the main reason why neutral colloids avoid the neighborhood of\nthe charged macroions in the PM binary runs C2 and D2, as seen from the blue lines for gZz(r) in Figure 6(a) and (c). Opposite to it, the Yukawa-DLVO cross term interaction potential UYZz(r) is always attractive, as seen from Figure C1(b), bottom row. This explains the charged macroion-neutral colloid association for the binary Yukawa-DLVO\nruns in Figure 6(b) and (d).\nThe neutral-neutral interaction potential UZz(r) is attractive (by about 3 kBT )\nin the PM run D2, whereas U Y Zz(r) is very weak in the Yukawa-DLVO run D2Y , see Figure C1(c) upper and bottom rows. This result explains the observed clustering of\nthe neutrals in the snapshots in Figure 5 for the binary PM runs C2 and D2.\nThe PM and Yukawa-DLVO simulated structure factors Sij(k) are plotted in\nFigure 7, The PM simulated Szz(k) for thew neutral component has strong up-turn in the low-k region for the binary runs C2 and D2. Such divergence, though still finite in value, in practice is an indication of a phase separation in the neutral component.\nSince all partial structure factor are coupled, we expect that this indicates a global phase\nseparation in a charged macroion-rich and charged macroion-poor fluid. At the same\ntime, no such clustering (nor any sign of phase separation) is detected in the binary\nYukawa-DLVO runs C2Y and D2Y in Figure 7.\nRadial distribution functions \u03c1(Z)c (r) and \u03c1 (z) c (r) of the counterions around the\ncolloids for the runs series Ci and Di are presented in Figure B1. Due to the strong Coulomb coupling of counterions to the charged macroions, there are less counterions\nnear neutral colloids than in the bulk, which is another indication of the demixing in\nthe charged-neutral binary system."

Therefore, the bigger the neutral colloid, the stronger the entropic force they endure. When a pair or\nseveral neutral colloids are surrounded by the charged macroions, it is natural to expect\nthat the entropic force of the counterions will force the neutrals to stick to each other.\nFor smaller \u03c3z the entropic force will be weak, and, as a result, neutral colloids might evade the entropic pressure of the counterions and attain random distribution across the\nsystem. In order to verify this suggestion, the PM binary run A2, for which a pair-like clustering in gzz(r) was detected at low separations, see the red line in Figure 3(a), is chosen as a reference system with \u03c3/\u03c3z=1, and three additional runs E1-E3 with the size ratio \u03c3/\u03c3z=1.5, 2, and 4, see Table 3, were carried. While the size of neutral colloids is decreased, their number Nz was increased in order to keep their total packing fraction fixed to \u03b7/2=0.05, provided that the charged macroions keep their packing fraction fixed\nto \u03b7/2=0.05.\nSimulated pair correlation functions gzz(r), presented in Figure 8, confirm that\nthe smaller the neutral colloid, the weaker is the short-range clustering in the neutral\ncomponent. When the neutral colloid is 4 times smaller than the charged macroion, the\nshort-range clustering completely disappears, see the black line in Figure 8."

We found that the traditional DLVO\nbased approach is sufficient to describe the pair correlations in aqueous suspensions with\nhigh dielectric constant. However, in less polar solvents with reduced permittivity, the\nCoulomb coupling without screening between the charge species is getting much stronger\nwhich results in nonlinear screening effects. In this case the Yukawa-DLVO approach\ncompletely fails to describe the PM results for the pair correlations. We predict, for\nthe first time, indications for a fluid-fluid phase separation in such strongly nonlinear\nsystems. Our simulations show that there are two regions either rich with charged or\nwith neutral colloidal particles.\nAdditional two macroion simulations were staged to calculate interaction potentials\nbetween colloids in the binary runs that show fluid-fluid phase separation. We found\nthat the interaction between the charged colloids is strongly repulsive, whereas it is\nmoderately repulsive between the charged and neutral colloids. More interestingly, the\ninteraction between neutral colloids is strongly attractive. We believe that the latter is\nthe main reason for the fluid-fluid phase separation in the simulated binary system with\nstrong Coulomb coupling.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of H.L. was supported by the DFG within project LO418/23-1.

In other words, the counterions are mostly localized to the regions of charged macroions.\nThis is another indication of the demixing in the charged-neutral system. Another\ninteresting factor is a much stronger screening of the macroion charge in the binary\nPM run D2 compared to the ground state run D1, see the gap between these two lines in Figure B1. The reason for such stronger screening in D2 is the stronger macroion clustering effect in the D2 run. Larger clusters of charged macroions practically trap all their compensating counterions in and around them for effective screening.

            "text": "We calculated macroion-macroion interaction potentials explicitly in the PM\nsimulation runs D1, and D2, and in the Yukawa-DLVO runs D1Y , and D2Y . For this purpose, two macroions of charge q(Z)=100e were placed along the diagonal of the\nsimulation box of size L at a separation distance r. First, the canonically averaged total\nmacroion-macroion interaction force FZZ((r) was calculated for a set of r varied between 1\u03c3 and 4\u03c3. This force includes the direct interaction between the fixed macroions,\nthe electrostatic interaction with other macroions and counterions, and the entropic\nforce arising from the collisions with other macroions and counterions. As a remark,\na full average has been performed here over all remaining particles. The electrostatic\nand entropic forces are defined in Appendix A. In the Yukawa-DLVO runs with no counterions, the total macroion-macroion interaction force F YZZ includes only the direct interaction between the macroions, and the electrostatic and entropic interaction with\nother macroions. Second, the obtained total force is integrated over the separation\ndistance r to get the interaction potential of the averaged force UZZ(r) in the PM runs, and UYZZ(r) in the Yukawa-DLVO runs. Third, we repeat this procedure for another pair of fixed charges q(Z)=100e and q(z)=0, as well as for q(z)=0 and q(z)=0, to calculate the interactions UZz(r) and Uzz(r) for the PM runs, and U Y Zz(r) and U Y zz(r) for the YukawaDLVO runs. The resulting macroion-macroion interaction potentials for the averaged\nforce are plotted in Figure C1.\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 r/\u03c3 0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nU Z\nZ (r\n)/ k\nB T\n(a)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 r/\u03c3 0\n1\n2\nU Z\nz( r)\n/k B T\n(b)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nr/\u03c3\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\nU zz\n(r )/\nk B T\n(c)\n1 2 3 4 r/\u03c3 0\n5000\n10000\nU Y\nZ Z (r\n)/ k\nB T\n(a)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\nr/\u03c3\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5 0 U Y Z z( r) /k B T\n(b)\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 r/\u03c3 -0.007\n-0.006\n-0.005\n-0.004\n-0.003\n-0.002\n-0.001\n0\nU Y\nzz (r\n)/ k\nB T\n(c)\nFigure C1.
