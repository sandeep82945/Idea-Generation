            "text": "Over the last two decades, the demand for renewable energy sources has been gradually increasing worldwide.1,2 Among these sources, solar energy is considered the most abundant, clean, and environmentally friendly.3,4 By harnessing the \u201cphotovoltaic effect\u201d, solar cells can directly convert sunlight into electrical energy, enabling large-scale power generation.5 In 2021, a record-breaking 168 GW of solar energy was generated, laying the groundwork for 1 TW of solar energy by 2030. While traditional silicon solar cells have numerous benets, such as their established technology and proven reliability, there is a growing need for new technologies with greater energy conversion efficiency or lower processing costs. A promising candidate for such a technology is a new class of hybrid organic\u2013inorganic halide perovskites (PSCs).6,7 These materials have shown remarkable potential in both aspects, with PSCs achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 23.3% for\nngineering, University of Dhaka, 1000, u.ac.bd gineering, Shahjalal University of Science\n, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh tion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\na small-area device (9 mm2).8 However, this efficiency is much lower than that of silicon solar cells (150 mm2).9 The main reason for this low efficiency is the issue of poor longerwavelength photon capture, which must be addressed to further enhance the performance of PSCs.10,11\nThe eld of plasmonics has emerged as a promising avenue to enhance the performance of photovoltaic devices, including PSCs.12,13 Plasmonics refers to the interaction between light and free electrons in metals, which results in the excitation of surface plasmons at specic resonance wavelengths.14 Plasmonic nanostructures, such as nanoparticles made of gold or silver, have shown great potential in enhancing the absorption of light in solar cells.15,16 This is achieved through two mechanisms: (i) by exciting localized surface plasmon resonances that couple and trap incoming sunlight into a thin absorber layer, and (ii) by acting as antennas at optical frequencies, where the plasmonic near-eld is coupled to the solar material, thereby increasing its effective absorption cross-section. In addition, plasmonic nanoparticles scatter incoming light into dielectriclike waveguide modes of the solar cell, increasing the average light path length within the solar cells.17 These effects result in a signicant enhancement of the light\u2013matter interaction and, consequently, an increase in the photocurrent density.18 Therefore, plasmonics is a promising approach to address the issue of poor longer-wavelength photon capture in PSCs and holds great potential for further improving their efficiency.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19447\u201319454 | 19447\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Our approach aims to increase the light absorption of the cell without altering its typical conguration or the geometry of its components, which is essential for maintaining efficiency. By exciting plasmonic modes and enhancing light scattering, the array of NPs increases the absorption of the perovskite layer. To investigate the mechanism of absorption enhancement, we use multiphysics modeling and nite element techniques. Our results demonstrate that using arrayed NPs can improve the average absorption of the perovskite layer by up to 14% across the wavelength range of 300 nm to 2000 nm. Furthermore, we analyze the inuence of nanoparticle size and spacing on the absorption enhancement and nd that shrinking the spacing can lead to a considerable improvement of up to 45% due to the high near-eld coupling. To comprehensively assess the impact of plasmonic nanostructures on cell performance, we evaluate measures such as open-circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), ll factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance program (SCAPS 1-D). Our results show that incorporating arrayed NPs into the cell increases the short circuit current density from 26.63 mA cm\u22122 to 39.40 mA cm\u22122 and improves the PCE from 21.77% to 30.4%, when compared with the baseline counterpart (without any NPs). Additionally, we investigate the effect of employing different materials, with the highest absorption and PCE observed for Au NPs. Our ndings suggest that the incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles into perovskite solar cells offers a promising strategy for enhancing their efficiency and performance."

A layer of glass sits on top of the device. Fig. 1 shows an array of nine nanospheres arranged in a 3 \u00d7 3 pattern embedded in the absorber layer. The thicknesses of each layer are provided in Table 1.\nIn this work, a three-dimensional optical simulation was carried out using the nite element method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics. The FEM is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations for boundary value problems.

Specically, we conducted a detailed investigation of the optical properties of a single silver nanoparticle exposed to different solvent environments, as reported by McFarland et al.21 By simulating the optical intensity and comparing it with the experimental ndings, we successfully validated our electromagnetic simulations. Our calculated intensity exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental data (ESI Fig. S1\u2020). The resonant peak was observed at the same wavelength as the experimental ndings, further conrming the accuracy of our simulation approach."

            "text": "We analyze the optical absorption of a planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) to determine how embedded nanoparticles impact absorption rates and whether this can enhance the cell's power conversion efficiency (PCE). We implement a proposed nanoparticle structure on the PSC to achieve this goal. First, we calibrate the baseline PSC structure (without nanoparticles) against existing literature.22 Fig. 2 shows that our results (yellow\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndash line) align with previous research (black dotted line). The ultraviolet and visible light ranges exhibit high absorption rates, reaching a peak of 0.96 at 720 nm. However, the extinction coefficient value drops to nearly zero in the infrared region, leading to a signicant decrease in absorption rates.\nThe addition of plasmonic nanospheres to the perovskite layer signicantly improves the absorption and photocurrent of the solar cell. When a single 80 nm-diameter Au nanosphere is added to the center of the perovskite layer, a new absorption peak appears around 820 nm (Fig. 2). Replacing the single particle with a 3 \u00d7 3 array of nanospheres (spacing 5 nm) further boosts the infrared region, resulting in two distinct absorption peaks at 1220 nm and 1340 nm. We choose a 3 \u00d7 3 array size to demonstrate the feasibility and potential benets of integrating nanospheres into the perovskite layer and also based on our computational resources. To explore the inuence of several other array forms on the potential benets of integrating nanospheres, different sizes of arrays are simulated and results are shown in, Fig. S3 and S4.\u2020We observed that aer a 3 \u00d7 3 array, the absorption doesn't increase considerably, justifying our array size selection. We have also investigated the optimum distance between the nanosphere and the sidewall. The distance between the sidewall and the center of the closest particle lS has been considered as a multiple of d, where d is the diameter of the nanoparticle, s is the distance between the two closest particles (Fig S5\u2020). We have observed average absorption of 0.3812, 0.3979, 0.4179, 0.4153, 0.4127 for the distance of 1.8 \u00d7 d, 2 \u00d7 d, 2.3 \u00d7 d, 2.5 \u00d7 d and 3 \u00d7 d respectively. We have found that aer 2.3 \u00d7 d, absorption does not depend much on the distance. So in our study, we use this value to form the unit cell.\nCompared to the base structure with an average absorption of 27.08% over the wavelength range of 300 nm to 2000 nm, the addition of a single nanosphere increases the average absorption of the perovskite layer to 30.41%, while the nanosphere array increases it to 41.79%. The average absorption attributable to the plasmonic nanoparticles was calculated using the trapezoidal method. This indicates that the nanosphere array is responsible for the signicant improvement of nearly 14%. The compact packing of plasmonic materials in the nanosphere array enhances the near-eld effect for plasmonic behavior, leading to increased absorption of photons and the generation of more electron\u2013hole pairs.\nThe absorption enhancement due to the embedded nanosphere array can be understood by analyzing the electric eld prole. Fig. 3a and b depict nanospheres with a diameter of 80 nm placed at distances of 5 nm and 20 nm, respectively, to demonstrate the increase in absorption. As the distance between the spheres decreases, the perovskite layer experiences strong light absorption due to the coupling effect, as shown in Fig. 3a. In plasmonics, the coupling effect refers to the interaction between the plasmon modes of two or more metal nanoparticles or other plasmonic structures.23 When two or more plasmonic structures are brought into close proximity, the plasmon modes of each structure can interact with each other, leading to a range of interesting and useful optical effects. This strong coupling effect is a result of the strong eld coupling\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19447\u201319454 | 19449\nFig. 3 Electric field profile for a single nanosphere with a diameter of 80 nm, illuminated by light with a wavelength of 720 nm, placed at two different distances: (a) 5 nm and (b) 20 nm. The color map shows the magnitude of the electric field intensity, with white representing the highest intensity and black the lowest. The strong coupling effect between the nanosphere and the incident light is observed at a smaller distance (a), while the coupling effect diminishes as the distance between the nanosphere and the light source increases (b). The electric field profile is obtained using the software COMSOL Multiphysics. The software uses finite element method (FEM) to solve the equations governing the interaction of light with nanospheres and other materials, providing a detailed analysis of the electric field\nintensity and distribution around the nanostructure.

Furthermore, the amount of light trapping in the solar cell increases with increasing diameter, resulting inmore light absorption. (b) Depicts the total absorption flux for different nanosphere diameters ranging from 20 nm to 80 nm at a fixed spacing of 5 nm, and a reference line for without any nanoparticles.

However, as the distance between the nanospheres increases, the coupling effect diminishes, as illustrated in Fig. 3b.\nMathematically, the electric eld prole can be expressed using the following equation:24\nE \u00bc E0eikz \u00fe XN\nn\u00bc1 anEne\niknz (3)\n19450 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19447\u201319454\nwhere E is the total electric eld, E0 is the incident electric eld, k is the wave vector, z is the position along the propagation axis, an are the complex coefficients that depend on the size, shape, and position of the nanospheres, and En is the electric eld of the nth scattered wave.\nThe absorption enhancement is attributed to the excitation of surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) in the nanospheres, which couple with the perovskite layer. The coupling effect is maximized when the SPR frequency of the nanospheres matches the frequency of the incident light, leading to the formation of hot spots with high eld intensity. These hot spots increase the local density of optical states, leading to a higher probability of photon absorption by the perovskite layer.\nNanoparticle size plays a crucial role in determining coupling efficiency. In this study, we investigate the inuence of nanoparticle diameter variation on the absorption spectrum.\nFig. 4a shows the results for a single layer of a 3 \u00d7 3 array of\ncoupling efficiency.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The red dashed line represents the absorption spectrum for the case without any nanoparticles as reference.\nCompared to the no nanoparticle case, the introduction of a 20 nm nanoparticle leads to the appearance of small absorption peaks around a wavelength of 780 nm. For larger nanoparticle diameters, a clear red shi of the absorption peak is observed, in agreement with the Mie theory, which predicts that the absorption peak shis towards longer wavelengths with increasing nanoparticle diameter. This trend is observed in all our results. As the nanoparticle diameter increases, the amount of light trapping also increases due to enhanced scattering.25 This increased light trapping results in more light being absorbed in the solar cell.\nFig. 4b shows the inuence of nanoparticle diameter variation on the increase of perovskite solar cell absorption. By varying the diameter of the nanospheres from 20 nm to 80 nm for a xed spacing of 5 nm, we observe an enhancement in average absorption of more than 14% due to strongly scattered far-eld.26,27\nFig. 5a illustrates the impact of spacing variations between nanospheres with a diameter of d = 80 nm on the absorption spectrum of the perovskite layer. As the spheres are brought closer together, light connement increases among the nanospheres. The broadest peak with the highest average absorption of approximately 45% is observed for the smallest spacing of s= 2 nm. However, for s = 5 nm and 10 nm, the average absorption decreases to 41% and 36%, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the variation of spacing while keeping the diameter xed at d = 80 nm. The absorption of light signicantly increases as the spacing decreases, with maximum absorption occurring at s = 2 nm. This is attributed to the strong near-eld coupling.27\nIn this study, we investigate the impact of plasmonic nanostructures on the performance parameters of solar cells. Specically, we analyze the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC), ll factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (h) using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance program (SCAPS 1-D). This tool solves Poisson's equation and the continuity equations for carrier calculations, using material properties adopted from the literature. All material properties used in this study are taken from previously published literature sources28,29 (ESI Table S2\u2020). In our study, the addition of the nanoarray is achieved through a two-step simulation approach (ESI Fig. S6\u2020). First, we utilize FEMbased COMSOL soware to solve the Maxwell equations and obtain the absorption prole of the solar cell. The absorption prole is then imported into the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) soware, which allows us to simulate the electrical response of the cell. To validate our simulation results, we rely on a combination of experimental data and previous studies (ESI text ST3\u2020). Specically, we select a published study30 that utilizes methylammonium-free perovskite solar devices based on the formamidinium organic cation. This study provides UV-visible spectroscopic absorption curves and SCAPS-generated I\u2013V characteristics for various absorber layers. By incorporating the thickness, refractive index, and other\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\noptical data from this study into our COMSOL model, we are able to reproduce the absorption curve, as shown in ESI Fig. S7a.\u2020\nTo evaluate the effect of plasmonic nanostructures, we rst simulate a baseline structure using the absorption spectrum calculated for no nanosphere (shown as a red dashed line in Fig. 5a). We then simulate the impact of 3 \u00d7 3 array of nanospheres using our absorption data (shown as a black dashed line in Fig. 5a) obtained from FEM analysis. The comparison of the performance matrices of PSCs is shown in Table 2.\nFig. 6 depicts the relationship between the performance metrics of the plasmonic solar cell and the diameter and spacing of the plasmonic nanospheres. Our FEM simulation predicted that the highest current density would be obtained when the nanospheres had the largest diameter and were closest to one another, which is supported by the data shown in\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19447\u201319454 | 19451\nStructure VOC (V) JSC (mA cm \u22122) FF (%) h (%)\nNo NPs 1.14 26.63 71.5 21.77 With NPs 1.15 39.42 70.05 30.4\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Specically, the highest current density (JSC) of 39.40 mA cm\u22122 is achieved when the diameter of the nanospheres (d) is 80 nm and the spacing between them (s) is 2 nm.\nIn Fig. 6b, it is evident that increasing the diameter of the nanospheres while decreasing the distance between them slightly enhances the open-circuit voltage (VOC). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6c, the ll factor (FF) decreases somewhat as the diameter of the nanoparticle increases and the distance between the nanoparticles decreases. The contour plot of PCE as a function of both nanoparticle spacing and diameter is shown in Fig. 6d. For a solar cell, PCE can be calculated as follows:\nFig. 6 A comprehensive electrical analysis of the impact of nanoparticle nanoparticle-containing perovskite solar cells. Panel (a) displays the curr data in panel (a) support our FEM simulation, which predicted that the h nanoparticle diameter (d) is 80 nm and the spacing (s) is 2 nm.

As shown in Fig. 6b and c, increasing the diameter of NPs while decreasing the space between NPs results in a minor increase in VOC and a slight decrease in FF, both of which cancel out each other's inuence in measuring PCE. As a consequence, the values of JSC have a dominating impact on the PCE, resulting in the same pattern in the contour plot. For nanoparticles d= 80 nm and s= 2 nm, the maximum PCE= 30.4% is observed, whereas the PCE for the baseline structure is 21.77%.\nIn this study, the impact of different materials, namely Au, Ag, ITO, and TiO2, on the absorption spectrum of a single layer of nanospheres (as illustrated in Fig. 1) for perovskite solar cells is examined, as depicted in Fig. 7a. The results show that the average absorption, reaching 42%, is obtained with Au nanomaterials, as shown in Fig. 7b.

            "text": "In this work, we have investigated the use of plasmonic nanoparticles as efficient light absorbers to enhance the lightharvesting of perovskite solar cells in the IR region. Specically, we have studied the effect of an Au nanosphere array buried in the perovskite layer, and have optimized the diameter and spacing of the nanospheres for maximum efficiency. Using our nite element calculation, we found that a larger diameter of d = 80 nm (s = 5 nm) and the lowest spacing of 2 nm (with d = 80 nm) resulted in the maximum absorption of 46%.\nWe also reported the electrical parameters, such as VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE, and compared the results with the base structure (no nanoparticle). Due to the closely spaced nanospheres, light trapping increased, and we achieved a maximum current density of JSC = 39.40 mA cm\n\u22122. Similarly, the highest PCE (30.4%) was obtained for the largest d and the lowest s between the nanospheres, showing a 40% enhancement compared to the baseline structure.\nWe then investigated different types of plasmonic materials and found that Au was the best for its high absorption\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In summary, adding a nanosphere array into the perovskite layer is an efficient way to improve light absorption in the IR region, as well as increase JSC and PCE."
