Page4, Fiona Fidler1,5 1MetaMelb Research Group, School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne, Australia\n2Melbourne Medical School, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry & Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Australia. 3Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Australia 4Methods in Evidence Synthesis Unit, School of Public Health & Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Australia 5School of History & Philosophy of Sciences, University of Melbourne, Australia\nObjectives: To characterise the attitudes of Australians affected by cancer towards the sharing of de-identified research data with third parties, including the public. Design, setting, participants: Anonymous online survey between October 2022 and February 2023 of adult Australians previously diagnosed with cancer. Main outcome measures: Self-reported attitudes towards the sharing of human and non-human data, and the hypothetical sharing of their anonymised medical information and responses to the survey. Results: 551 respondents contributed data to the survey. There was strong support for cancer researchers sharing non-human and de-identified human research data with medical doctors (90% and 95% respectively) and non-profit researchers (both 94%). However, this declined when participants were asked whether data should be shared with for-profit researchers (both 64%) or posted publicly (both 61%). When asked if they would hypothetically consent to researchers at their treatment location collecting and sharing their deidentified data publicly, only half agreed (50%). In contrast, after being shown a visual representation of the de-identified survey data, 80% of respondents supported sharing it publicly. A further 10% also supported public sharing of some of the survey data, with the most frequently desired information to be withheld including education history and levels of trust in healthcare stakeholders. Conclusions: Australians affected by cancer support the sharing of research data, particularly with clinician and non-profit researchers. Visualisation of the data to be shared may also enhance support for making research data publicly available. These results should help alleviate any concerns about research participants\u2019 attitudes on data sharing, as well as boost researchers\u2019 motivation for sharing.\nKeywords: Data sharing, oncology, cancer, patient opinion, public opinion, consumer engagement\nThe last three years have seen an increase in discussions about data sharing and Open Science more broadly in Australia. On one side, we saw the first steps towards a national Open Access Strategy, as well as Australia\u2019s adoption of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\u2019s (UNESCO) international framework on open science in 2021 [1]. Australian funding agencies have also been put under pressure to strengthen their public\nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Daniel G.

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), which directed $1.6 billion to cancer-related research between 2013-2021 and is a signatory of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), is among them [2]. However, in contrast, the same period bore witness to several well-publicised and serious leaks of Australians\u2019 health information from private companies (e.g., Medibank & AHM, Medlab Pathology, Australian Clinical Labs), public healthcare providers (e.g., Ambulance Tasmania) and\nNOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to g ide clinical practice.\nDG HAMILTON1,2, S EVERITT3, MJ PAGE4 & F FIDLER1,5 2\ncontractors working with government departments (e.g., PNORS Technology Group). Combined, these incidents exposed tens of millions of Australians\u2019 data. Consequently, this may have eroded previously high levels of support among the general Australian public and people living with cancer for medical researchers collecting and sharing health data observed [3,4].\nGreater availability of the data underpinning published research comes with many benefits to scientists and society [5,6]. However, data sharing in oncology is not yet the norm [7,8], which has impeded attempts to replicate cancer research [5]. Commonly cited challenges to sharing data include legislative and regulatory barriers, time and resource burdens and concerns about negative impacts on academic performance (e.g., loss of publishing and funding opportunities) [9]. Consequently, several authors have explored the attitudes of medical research stakeholders towards improving access to researchers\u2019 data [9,10]. However, this body of research has largely focussed on the attitudes of researchers, institutions, funders, and publishers. Less attention has been paid to what the key contributors to, and ultimate consumers of medical research \u2013 patients \u2013 think of these practices [11,12]. Furthermore, research on this topic has focussed on certain data types (e.g., omics data [13,14]), study designs for which public sharing of data is not routine (e.g., clinical trials [12,15,16]) or specific cancer types (e.g., breast cancer [4]). Therefore, this study aims to contextualise and build upon previous research into public opinions on data sharing by engaging Australians affected by cancer and characterising their views on the sharing of deidentified research data with third parties, including the public."

The third checked participants\u2019 comprehension of our definition of research data using real-world data from a study investigating viral and fungal infections in people diagnosed with lymphoma [19], as well as captured whether participants were familiar with these concepts. The fourth characterised participants\u2019 general views on both the sharing of human and non-human research data, and the hypothetical sharing of de-identified research data containing their medical information with four different recipients (medical doctors, nonprofit researchers, for-profit researchers, and the public). The fifth and final section provided a visual representation of what the de-identified survey data would look like, incorporating the participant\u2019s responses into one of the rows (Figure 1), then proceeded to ask the participant for their views on: i) whether and how long the data should be retained, ii) whether they would hypothetically allow the research team to share it publicly, and iii) if not, which data, if any, they wished to be withheld and the reasons why."

Participants reported being affected by 34 different cancer types, with the most reported diagnosis being breast cancer (54%, N=292), melanoma of the skin (6%, N=30), prostate cancer (5%, N=28), lung cancer (5%, N=29), colorectal cancer (4%, N=23) and lymphoma (3%, N=16). More than a third of participants reported that they had previously participated in a clinical trial (9%, N=49) or non-trial health-related research project (29%, N=156)."

However, respondents were less trusting of researchers at Australian companies (34%, N=169) and the Australian government (45%, N=224). Of the participants that answered at least two questions, 92% (N=477) reported trusting multiple groups with their personal information.\nKnowledge and general views on data sharing\nMost respondents answered the comprehension check correctly (82%, N=347). Similarly, 82% of\nrespondents reported that they had either heard of (15%, N=69), knew a little (53%, N=242), a lot (13%, N=60), or were experts (1%, N=5) on the topic of data sharing. The most common reasons for respondents\u2019 familiarity with data sharing included: general interest in science (51%, N=188), previous participation in health research (25%, N=92) and/or working in health (19%, N=70). When asked to estimate what percentage of cancer research currently shares research data, the median guess was 40% (IQR: 20- 60%).\nOf the respondents who passed the comprehension check, most reported that they felt cancer researchers should regularly share data derived from human and non-human participants with all four recipients (Figure 3). There was particularly strong support behind the sharing of both data types with medical doctors and non-profit researchers. Interestingly, attitudes towards sharing data with these four groups were similar regardless of whether the data were derived from human or non-human participants.\nViews on the sharing of their data\nWhen asked hypothetically if they would consent to medical researchers collecting their medical information (e.g., blood pressure measurements, pathology results, prescribed treatments) for a research project, and sharing de-identified data with the same four recipients, most respondents indicated that they would consent to researchers sharing data with medical doctors (99%, N=303) and non-profit researchers (95%, N=291) (Figure 4). However, fewer respondents were supportive of researchers sharing de-identified data with for-profit researchers (56%, N=171) or the public (50%, N=152).\nIn contrast, when participants were shown a visualisation of the survey\u2019s de-identified data incorporating responses they had given (Figure 1), and asked hypothetically whether they would consent to us posting de-identified survey data publicly, 80% (N=240) indicated that they would consent to posting all data publicly, 10% (N=29) reported that they would consent to some data being posted publicly, and 10% (N=31) stated they would not consent or were uncertain. Almost three-quarters of respondents also added that they did not support permanent deletion of this survey\u2019s data following publication of the results"

Furthermore, when the 60 respondents who did not support full public release of the survey data were asked what their concerns would be, the most commonly mentioned themes related to reidentification concerns (N=14), misuse by subsequent users of the data (N=12), loss of control of their information (N=10), then potential repercussions for the respondent or other participants (N=2). Several illustrative statements that touched upon these themes are reported in Table 2.\nFactors influencing willingness to share\nDifferences between support for sharing data and several respondent characteristics were explored (Appendix 1). We observed that respondents who reported they generally trusted two or more stakeholders were more likely to support sharing human research data with medical doctors (95% vs 82%, RD: 13%, 95% CI: 1-36%) and non-profit researchers (95% vs 75%, RD: 20%, 95% CI: 5-44%) than those who didn\u2019t. Respondents who reported they generally trusted two or more stakeholders were also more likely to consent to researchers sharing their anonymised treatment data with medical doctors (99% vs 88%, RD: 11%, 95% CI: 2-34%) and to us sharing\nsurvey data publicly (81% vs 56%, RD: 25%, 95% CI: 4-49%). However, beyond this we did not observe any meaningful differences between attitudes of respondents according to their prior participation in research, successful completion of the comprehension check, familiarity with the topic of data sharing or the order in which the reasons for and against sharing were displayed."

This is in contrast with the subtly different, and more commonly investigated questions of how willing people are to donate their medical information to research, and what they think about researchers accessing routinely collected health data. Our study found that most respondents agreed that oncology researchers should share their research data with medical and non-profit researchers (90-95%) but noted less support for sharing with for-profit researchers (64%) and the public (61%). However, interestingly, attitudes did not appear to vary according to whether data are sourced from human participants or not. Very similar findings were also observed when respondents were asked about cancer researchers sharing de-identified research data containing their treatment information. Additionally, after being shown a visualisation of the data, 80% of respondents supported the public release of deidentified survey data.\nFigure 2.

For example, in the setting of clinical trials, a 2020 survey of 81 Australians affected by breast cancer showed that respondents were much more supportive of university and health agencies obtaining access to de-identified trial data than forprofit companies [4]. Similarly, a survey of 771 clinical trial participants in the United States, noted that 93% of respondents supported sharing their clinical trial data with academic and other not-forprofit researchers, whereas 82% supported sharing with companies developing medical products [15]. We also see similar discrepancies in the context of omics data as well. For example, Barnes and colleagues [14] observed support for sharing data collected to develop a proteomic test for stroke with non-profit and forprofit organisations decline from 87% to 53% respectively."

            "text": "Concerns among patients and the public regarding misuse, re-identification and loss of control over their information could be allayed by the following strategies. One strategy to balance the desire or need to make human research data publicly available and concerns about third parties profiting from research data, could be the application of non-commercial public copyright licenses (e.g., CC BY-NC 4.0), along with an explanation to participants that while data will be made public it cannot be legally used for commercial purposes. However, ambiguities in the definition of \u2018non-commercial\u2019, as well as the possible negative impacts of applying such licenses on data utility would also need to be considered with this approach [22]. A further strategy to address these concerns would be to submit data to FAIR-compliant, controlled-access repositories, where requests are reviewed to ensure they are in line with both the research community\u2019s and participants\u2019 values (e.g., methodologically sound, non-commercial motives).\nDG HAMILTON1,2, S EVERITT3, MJ PAGE4 & F FIDLER1,5 8\nImportantly, our study also suggests that visual aids could be a useful tool in low-risk research settings to help prospective participants better understand exactly what data will be collected and reused after the conclusion of the study. This strategy may also reduce anxieties about re-identification when researchers need to obtain consent to make data available to third parties. Both are findings that have been observed in other consent settings [23]."

            "text": "Our study has several strengths which give us confidence that we have been able to elicit robust, informed, and high integrity opinions on the topic of data sharing. Firstly, our study was more than three times larger than a previous survey of Australian breast cancer patients\u2019 attitudes on data sharing done in 2020 [4]. Our study also included several educational materials to help explain concepts like deidentification that are typically not well understood [21,24], and incorporated a comprehension check and several fraud detection mechanisms. However, there are some limitations. The use of public advertisements and convenience sampling means we are unable to determine the non-response rate, nor assess possible response biases. For example, our decision to obtain consent to make de-identified survey data available on request may have deterred people with strong views against sharing from participating. Further, the decision to host the survey online, and in English, limited our potential pool of participants. We also received five times more responses to the survey from women than men. However, prior research suggests that this is unlikely to have impacted the generalisability of our findings [15,25]."
