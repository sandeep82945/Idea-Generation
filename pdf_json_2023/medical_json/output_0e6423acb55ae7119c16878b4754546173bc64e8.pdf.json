Current expansion microscopy protocols require prior treatment with reactive anchoring chemicals to link specific labels and biomolecule classes to the gel. We describe a strategy called Magnify, which uses a mechanically sturdy gel that retains nucleic acids, proteins and lipids without the need for a separate anchoring step. Magnify expands biological specimens up to 11 times and facilitates imaging of cells and tissues with effectively around 25-nm resolution using a diffraction-limited objective lens of about 280 nm on conventional optical microscopes or with around 15 nm effective resolution if combined with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging.

Expansion microscopy (ExM)1,2 is a technique enabling nanoscale imaging using only a diffraction-limited fluorescent microscope. ExM magnifies cells and tissues physically and isotropically: biomolecules are linked covalently to a dense and swellable polyelectrolyte hydrogel and are physically expanded away from each other in water after chemical processing. Since development of the technique1, ExM protocols have been used for nanoscale imaging of proteins3\u201310, nucleic acids7,11\u201313 and lipids8,9,14, while new hydrogel chemistries facilitate linear expansion factors (EFs) of around tenfold or larger in either a single15,16 or iterative6,10 expansion steps. To perform expansion, molecular handles are first covalently attached to specific biomolecules and/or labels that anchor them to a swellable hydrogel network that is subsequently synthesized throughout the specimen2. These handles are either conjugated antibodies or reactive chemicals prone to quick hydrolysis in water2,17,18, with one exception that contains a mixture of formaldehyde and acrylamide for use with unfixed specimens5.

Methacrolein remains stable in the monomer solution and modifies biomolecules in a similar way to formaldehyde while providing an isopropenyl functional group that participates in the in situ polymerization step. We found that tissue sections gelled with methacrolein-containing monomer solution can expand after strong protease digestion using ProK, while pre-expansion fluorescent markers (fluorescent proteins or immunolabels) persist (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 1) as in previous ExM protocols3. We compared protein retention after protease digestion between tissues treated with our protocol and those treated with the protein retention ExM (proExM) protocol, which relies on Acryloyl-X, SE (AcX) to anchor biomolecules, and found over 380% higher retention in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) kidney slices (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 1). To preserve protein epitopes postexpansion, we treated gel-embedded tissues with a denaturant-rich solution at 80 \u00b0C for at least 1 h (optimized time varies by tissue type; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1) and observed crack-free expansion in mouse brain slices, a range of sectioned human tissues and human bronchial basal stem-cell-derived lung organoids with high protein retention using our protocol (Fig. 1e\u2013f, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary\nTable 2). However, gel-embedded human kidney sections anchored with AcX showed distortions, including crack-like artifacts and incomplete expansion, after heat denaturation under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also found that the high protein retention facilitated by Magnify (530% higher retention in mouse brain slices as compared with proExM; Fig. 1e) enables effective delivery of antibodies postexpansion (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). This combined anchoring and gelling step along with homogenization with a hot denaturant-rich solution underlies the main concepts of the Magnify framework.\nWe sought to find an improved gel chemistry capable of providing a larger EF in a single round compared with the traditional fourfold of ExM (Supplementary Note 2). Previously, the X10 protocol6 reported a hydrogel consisting of sodium acrylate (2) (SA) and N,N- dimethylacrylamide acid (3) (DMAA) that allows for EFs of around tenfold in cultured cells and mouse brain slices. However, X10 requires rigorous degassing to remove oxygen before gelling and reportedly cannot expand mechanically tough tissue types even with strong protease digestion6. We show that heavily formalin-fixed human tissues such as FFPE kidney sections did not expand evenly with the X10 gel and could only achieve around sixfold expansion (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4) using heat denaturation. We then investigated a series of hydrogels by varying concentrations of the monomers DMAA, SA, acrylamide (4) (AA) and the crosslinker N,N\u2032-methylenebisacrylamide (5) (Bis) (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Tables 6\u201310). We discovered a hydrogel formula that is mechanically sturdy (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 9), composed of 4% (w/v) DMAA, 34% (w/v)\nused to enable expansion. Most protocols have demonstrated only around fourfold expansion in tissues3\u20136,8,9,12,13 with a mechanically delicate hydrogel, providing an effective resolution of only around 70 nm with a 1.15 numerical aperture (NA; roughly 280-nm diffraction limit) objective lens, which is insufficient to resolve fine features such as molecular organization within individual synapses. Protocols for larger expansion6,15,16 have been developed, but have not been demonstrated beyond cultured cells and brain tissue sections.\nAn ideal ExM protocol would (1) be easy to use; (2) provide tenfold or greater expansion with minimal distortion; (3) be capable of conserving a comprehensive array of biomolecule classes that can be labeled after expansion and (4) be simultaneously compatible with a broad range of tissue types (including mechanically tough tissues such as kidney) and fixation methods. So far, no documented ExM method can achieve all these features. Here, we present Magnify, a variant of ExM that meets all the requirements above. Magnify uses a hydrogel formula that retains a spectrum of biomolecules, thus eliminating the need for a separate, molecule-specific anchoring step. Additionally, Magnify can expand conventionally preserved tissues up to about 11-fold, providing an effective resolution of around 25 nm for an around 280-nm diffraction-limited 1.15 NA objective lens (\u223c280/11) (Fig. 1a\u2013c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Magnify can also retain proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, enabling postexpansion labeling in a broad range of specimens. When combined with super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI)19, a computational postprocessing method employing independent temporal fluctuations of fluorophores to distinguish emitters, Magnify\u2013SOFI can achieve a lateral effective resolution of around 15 nm with a 1.15 NA objective lens on a conventional spinning disk confocal microscope."

            "text": "While ExM allows nanoscale imaging without expensive, specialized hardware, current iterations have critical limitations that minimize potential applications. For example, high (greater than tenfold) EF ExM methods have not been demonstrated successfully beyond cell culture or brain tissue, restricting many tissues to around 70 nm resolution. Although some ExM protocols can retain both nucleic acids and lipids directly within the gel, they rely on custom anchoring agents that are not available commercially, thus hindering widespread adoption. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a broadly applicable yet easily adoptable expansion method. To address this, we implemented Magnify by (1) eliminating the need for a standalone anchoring step; (2) formulating a mechanically robust hydrogel with a large EF and (3) developing a flexible homogenization strategy for an array of tissue types preserved with conventional fixation methods.\nFirst, we asked whether it is possible to directly anchor biomolecules to the polymeric gel during gelation.

Using a 1.4 NA \u00d760 oil immersion objective (around 200 nm Rayleigh limit), we demonstrated a resolving power of around 18 nm (200/11) in an 11-fold expanded mouse brain section stained for total protein content postexpansion with a fluorescently conjugated N-hydroxysuccidimidyl ester (NHS). Under these conditions, we observed well-resolved postsynaptic densities and presynaptic dense projections23, which have been shown through electron microscopy (EM) to be around 56 nm in diameter and spaced roughly 20 nm apart edge-to-edge24, as well as the hexagonal lattice these projections form when viewed on their face (Fig. 1h). The high EF of the Magnify gel allowed measurement of the distance between bassoon and homer\u2014synaptic scaffolding proteins in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments, respectively\u2014in mouse brain tissue expanded around fourfold in PBS using a 1.2 NA \u00d760 water immersion objective lens. We measured bassoon\u2013homer pair distances in six brain regions (Fig. 1i): primary motor cortex layers 5 (M1 L5) and 6 (M1 L6), primary sensory cortex layers 4 (S1 L4) and 6 (S1 L6), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and nucleus accumbens (nAc). While the measured pair distances for each region are in line with measurements taken with stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy25, we noted distinct interregion variability, with cortical synapses having both a lower average pair distance and narrower distribution than synapses in either the DMS or nAc. Additionally, we measured synaptophysin and PSD95, synaptic proteins with a smaller edge-to-edge distance than homer and bassoon, in a fully expanded mouse brain slice using a 1.15 NA \u00d740 water immersion objective lens. Measuring from the edge of the synaptophysin signal (representing the presynaptic active zone) to the center of the postsynaptic density, we found a mean distance of 64.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3), consistent with previous reports26.\nWe confirmed the low distortion obtained by the Magnify protocol on several tissue types using SOFI pre-expansion19 (Supplementary Fig. 5) and confocal microscopy postexpansion (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). We found no substantial morphological changes between pre-expansion images and postexpansion images of cell nuclei and protein markers in either macroscopic or subdiffraction levels (Fig. 2a\u2013i and Supplementary Figs. 4, 6 and 7). The distortion levels were calculated in a range of 2\u20133.5% over length scales of tens to hundreds of microns in FFPE samples (Fig. 2c\u2013e,h\u2013i) and 2.5% for human embryonic kidney 293FT cells (HEK-293FT) cells (Supplementary Fig. 4), consistent with previous reports5,6. Analysis of the ultrastructure of microtubules in U2OS cells and cilia in human lung organoids (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 6) showed average peak-to-peak distances of 22.68 nm \u00b1 0.71 nm and 24.72 nm \u00b1 0.72 nm (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) respectively. The results agree with EM images of cilia in human lung organoids, which had an average peak-to-peak distance of 22.09 nm \u00b1 0.34 nm (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.). The linkage errors determined by the affinity agent are smaller than 5 nm in both cell culture and organoids, most probably due to the smaller relative size of the antibody labels compared with the width of microtubule postexpansion27. We also found that the slightly higher distortion level with some labels compared with previously reported ExM protocols is due to the increased number of labeled features during postexpansion staining with Magnify (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nFFPE specimens are among the most important biopsy preparations used for clinical examination, pathology research and diagnostic/ drug development. Due to the heavy formaldehyde-induced peptidyl crosslinks, FFPE specimens are challenging to expand with preserved epitopes since current protocols require aggressive proteolytic digestion7,28. We tested Magnify on several FFPE tissues and tissue microarrays containing tissue sections from various human organs and corresponding tumors, including breast, brain and colon (Fig. 2j\u2013o and Supplementary Fig. 7). In all cases, we obtained EFs of around 3.5\u20134.5\u00d7 in PBS, with an average EF ranging from 8.00\u00d7 to 10.77\u00d7 in water depending\non tissue type with 3.9% intraclass variation (Supplementary Table 1). We observed that methacrolein concentration and homogenization time need to be adjusted for different tissue types and preparations (Supplementary Table 1). FFPE tissue sections required longer homogenization times and higher methacrolein concentrations to achieve full expansion than those with freshly preserved specimens due to higher crosslinker content caused by formalin fixation. The difference in tissue preparations, methacrolein concentration and homogenization time may contribute to the 10% interclass variation in EFs. In FFPE specimens, we observed that postexpansion staining with Magnify reveals more detailed structures with some antibodies. For example, the structure of foot processes of podocytes labeled by an anti-alpha-actinin 4 (ACTN4) antibody using the Expansion Pathology (ExPath) protocol is visible only in frozen samples7, but not in FFPE kidney tissue sections. Similarly, expansion protocols have been used to image foot processes in PFA-fixed mouse29,30 and human samples30. However, these features and finer structures of the foot processes are readily apparent in the postexpansion staining with Magnify-processed FFPE kidney tissue sections (Fig. 2p and Supplementary Video 1). Additionally, we observed that conventional antigen retrieval protocols are not needed to achieve such an improvement as the denaturant-rich solution used during homogenization provides superior antibody labeling pre-expansion compared with conventional antigen retrieval buffers (Supplementary Fig. 3). This suggests expansion with Magnify may lead to improved accessibility of antibodies to epitopes, consistent with a previous report31 (Fig. 2p\u2013r, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Videos 2\u20134).\nExM methods for imaging proteins3,4 and nucleic acids11 have been increasingly adapted to accommodate imaging more types of biomolecules. While two ExM variants for visualizing lipids have been reported recently9,32, both require specimens labeled with lipid intercalating probes bearing an acrylamide functional group before in situ polymerization. We asked whether endogenous lipids can be retained by Magnify and found that paraldehyde-preserved mouse brain sections homogenized with denaturant-rich solution at 80 \u00b0C can be costained with traditional fluorescent lipophilic stains (such as DiO, DiI and DiD) and NHS esters of fluorescent dyes. We estimated up to 93% retention of lipids by comparing fluorescence intensity of DiD in mouse brain tissues both before and after Magnify processing at varying homogenization times (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 1). Despite the relatively harsh homogenization conditions, we found the ultrastructure of lipids is conserved in neural processes (Fig. 3b) mitochondria of the mouse brain (Fig. 3c), organelles in HEK-293FT cells (Fig. 3d\u2013e), blood vessel membranes (Fig. 3f) and the myelin sheath of axons (Supplementary Fig. 3) of mouse brain. Using a \u00d740 (1.15 NA) water immersion objective lens, layer-like patterns can be partly resolved in some myelinated axons. Additionally, Magnify allows visualization of extracellular vesicles in human bronchial basal stem-cell-derived lung organoids (Fig. 3g\u2013l), revealing complex internal structure (Fig. 3k\u2013l). It should be noted that the ability of Magnify to resolve any lipid-rich structure is dependent on the fixation method and the downstream sample preparation procedure. For example, the alcohol and xylene used in the dehydration step for embedding tissue in paraffin strip off lipids, precluding their imaging postexpansion with Magnify. Our results suggest that Magnify enables nanoscale observation of lipid membrane structures and their associated proteins using conventional confocal microscopes, indicating that Magnify can be a useful tool for the study of membrane biology and pathology in a wide range of biological specimens.\nDNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is commonly used to access gene amplification in tissues. We explored whether postexpansion DNA FISH is possible in expanded tissues processed with the Magnify protocol. We previously showed that the large size of traditional bacterial artificial chromosome-based FISH probes precludes efficient delivery to expanded, gel-embedded samples and thus small DNA oligo FISH probes are required7. Therefore, we synthesized and applied DNA FISH oligo probes (Supplementary Table 12) targeting AKT1, CDH1\nNature Biotechnology | Volume 41 | June 2023 | 858\u2013869 862\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01546-1\nDAPI ACTN4 Vimentin\nPr os\nta te\nDAPI ATPIF\nTh ym\nus Br\nea st\nPl ac\nen ta\nPre Post\nC ol\non\nDAPI ATPIF Keratin\nTh yr\noi d\nU te\nru s\nPre Post Pre Post j\nKi dn\ney\nc\nf\na\nDAPI ATPIF Keratin\nqDAPI ACTN4\nWGA\np\nDAPI ATPIF Keratin\nr\nb d\ng\nlk\nonm\nih\ne2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0\n2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0\n2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0\n2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0\n2.0 1.8 1.6 1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50\nMeasurement length (\u00b5m) Measurement length (\u00b5m) Measurement length (\u00b5m)\nRM S\ner ro\nr ( \u00b5m\n)\nRM S\ner ro\nr ( \u00b5m\n)\nRM S\ner ro\nr ( \u00b5m ) RM S er ro r ( \u00b5m )\nRM S\ner ro\nr ( \u00b5m\n)\nMeasurement length (\u00b5m)Measurement length (\u00b5m)\nFig. 2 | Validation of Magnify in several tissue types. a,b, Example of preexpansion images of human kidney imaged at \u00d760 and processed with SOFI (a) compared with the same FOV postexpansion with Magnify taken at \u00d740 (b).

We observed that all designed probes diffused into Magnify in both processed tissue types and hybridized with chromosomal DNA within 2 h at 45 \u00b0C (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Fig. 8). In addition, we observed that, with ProK homogenization, FFPE tissue sections can be processed, gel-embedded, homogenized and stained with DNA FISH probes and lectin stain within 8 h (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Video 5), which could be useful in time-sensitive applications such as histopathological diagnoses. We also found that RNA can be preserved postexpansion with milder homogenization conditions. We demonstrated simultaneous DNA and RNA FISH in HEK-293FT cells homogenized with brief heat denaturation at 70 \u00b0C for 1.5 h (Fig. 3n). Thus, Magnify enables super-resolution FISH imaging of nucleic acids on tissues and cells. Transgenic animals expressing fluorescent proteins (FPs), as well as animals expressing FPs after viral gene delivery, are essential models used to visualize and study proteins and cells in intact tissues and whole organisms. To determine the compatibility of FP-expressing tissue with the Magnify gel framework, we first applied ProK to mouse brain (DAT-cre, injected with AAV5-Syn-FLEX-rc(ChrimsonR-tdTomato)) expanded with the Magnify gel, as is standard in other ExM protocols. Similar to the proExM protocol3, FP tags were sufficiently preserved even after harsh protease treatment. Notably, endogenous lipids were also preserved (Fig. 4a\u2013d). Although FP signals are preserved, the use of ProK destroys most endogenous proteins, making postexpansion staining of other proteins impossible. Conversely, treatment with a hot denaturant-rich buffer that preserves biomolecules results in a loss of FP signal. To explore the compatibility of the Magnify framework with FP-expressing transgenic animals, we used anti-FP antibodies to label FP-expressing cells in an SST-cre/Ai3 mouse brain\nb\nc\na\nd\ng h\nDAPI DiO\nDAPI LEL tdTomato\nDAPI\nLEL\nDiO\ntdTomato\nSynaptophysin PSD95 \u03b1-GFP\ne f\nFig. 4 | Visualization of endogenous fluorophores with Magnify. a, Maximum intensity projection of a sagittal mouse brain section expanded with MagnifyProK.

We also immunostained synaptic pairs of synaptophysin and PSD95 to indicate excitatory synapses. Using a \u00d740 (1.15 NA) water immersion objective lens on a conventional confocal microscope, we can observe ultrafine dendritic spine morphology and partly resolved synaptic vesicles onto the postsynaptic densities of genetically targeted neurons after expansion (Fig. 4e\u2013h and Supplementary Videos 6\u20138).\nSub-20 nm resolution imaging enabled by Magnify\u2013SOFI As the Magnify framework is designed to allow for resolution of nanoscale structures without the need for specialized super-resolution imaging systems, a possible extension is the implementation of computational methods to further improve effective resolution. A relatively recent addition to the super-resolution arsenal, SOFI19, is well positioned to be paired with ExM (Supplementary Note 4). SOFI can be used with a conventional microscope to improve resolution by relying on the independent temporal fluctuations of fluorophores to distinguish emitters. By using second -order cross-correlations, SOFI can improve the resolution by twofold beyond the diffraction limit with around 100 frames or fewer19, as compared with tens of thousands with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). By combining SOFI and 11-fold expansion, Magnify\u2013SOFI can theoretically resolve around\n13 nm features for a 1.15 NA diffraction-limited objective lens of around 280-nm (around 280/11/2), without any special modifications. Additionally, as background fluorescence is uncorrelated with the fluorescent signal over time, the signal-to-background ratio can be improved with SOFI over 100-fold19\u2014a great benefit in expanded samples, as the expansion process dilutes the concentration of fluorophores.\nTo demonstrate the improved effective resolution, we used Magnify\u2013SOFI to image nanoscale cellular machinery of human lung organoids derived from human bronchial basal stem cells. The hollow structure of cilia and basal bodies were well resolved (Fig. 5a,d) along with mitochondria cristae (Fig. 5e\u2013g). The outer ring of cilia and basal bodies have been shown through EM to be composed of nine bundles of microtubules. While these subunits were often resolved with Magnify, it alone was insufficient to consistently resolve all nine bundles, particularly for slightly out-of-plane cilia and basal bodies. In contrast, Magnify\u2013SOFI fully resolves these structures, and the distinctive ninefold symmetry is observed (Fig. 5a). Depending on the wavelength of fluorophore used, we estimated an effective resolution of around 14\u201317 nm using a parameter-free algorithm based on decorrelation analysis of Magnify\u2013 SOFI images35 (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 5). Additionally, Magnify\u2013SOFI can be used to generate full three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of these structures in tissue (Fig. 5h\u2013k and Supplementary Video 9), which is challenging to achieve with EM.\na\nh i j\nk\ne f g\nc dbMagnify Magnify\u2013SOFI\n0 650 Distance (nm) FWHM (nm) 17 47\nC ou\nnt\nN or\nm al\niz ed\nin te\nns ity\n(a .u .) n = 121 microtubule bundles\nMean = 28.6 nm\nFig. 5 | Magnify\u2013SOFI visualizes ultrafine structures of cellular components. a, Comparison between Magnify and Magnify\u2013SOFI.

            "heading": "Optical evaluation of ciliopathies",
            "text": "Ciliopathies are a group of complex human genetic diseases characterized by both dysfunctional primary and motile cilia. Primary cilia are present on the apical surface of nearly every mammalian cell, and motile ciliopathies affect a broad range of important organs such as the airway, brain, middle ear, sperm and fallopian tubes36. The identification of factors regulating ciliogenesis and efficient characterization of cilia structure during ciliopathy can provide information critical for proper clinical diagnosis of cilia disorders and therapeutic development. The current methods for studying ciliogenesis include transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which is technically demanding, time-consuming and unable to easily provide 3D visualization of the full-length axoneme ultrastructure.\nTaxol is a chemotherapeutic agent that can bind to \u03b2-tubulin subunits to stabilize microtubules, preventing their dissociation via Ca2+ or cold temperature in vitro, halting microtubule dynamics that play am important role in mitosis, motility and cell growth and survival37\u201339. Taxol can also cause structural abnormalities in cilia, including supernumerary microtubules, disorganized microtubule doublets and inhibition of basal body migration towards the cell surface40,41. Compared with the normal state (Fig. 6a), human lung organoids treated with 20 \u00b5M Taxol showed malformed ciliary structures through EM imaging, with supernumerary and misplaced microtubules (Fig. 6b). We asked whether Magnify\u2013SOFI could be used to identify these malformed ciliary structures on a conventional optical microscope. We found that, in contrast to control human lung organoids, which exhibited consistent ninefold symmetry (Fig. 6c), organoids treated with Taxol exhibited deformities such as misplaced microtubule doublet subunits that were seen with EM (Fig. 6d). We also observed basal bodies with two split rootlets in both EM and Magnify images of Taxol-treated organoids. (Fig. 6e,f).\norganoids.

We performed Magnify\u2013SOFI imaging on cilia of apical-out airway organoids42 engineered from healthy stem cells with and without 20 mM Taxol treatment and patient stem cells carrying variants in the CCDC39 gene (Fig. 6g,h). These variants cause inner dynein arm defects and axonemal disorganization in cilia43,44. They are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)45,46\u2014a group of genetic disorders with abnormal motile cilia ultrastructure and function. Despite lower resolution than EM, Magnify\u2013SOFI captured malformed ciliary structures with only a diffraction-limited confocal microscope (Fig. 6i). Further quantification of normal and defective cilia ultrastructure revealed distinct patterns in populations under three conditions: normal, Taxol-treated and CCDC39 gene variants. There was no statistical difference between Magnify\u2013SOFI and EM (Fig. 6j). Additionally, Magnify\u2013SOFI showed similar performance to EM in capturing statistically significant intraclass variability among the three conditions (Fig. 6j). Thus, Magnify\u2013SOFI has the potential to deliver insights into the biology and disruptions to the cilia structures responsible for cilia dysfunction and to broaden our knowledge of the pathogenesis of human lung diseases to improve lung health."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "We developed a simple and versatile ExM method that preserves biomolecules and enables volumetric imaging of their nanoscale organization in a wide range of intact biological specimens. Magnify does not require a special fixation method to anchor biomolecules5, dedicated anchoring6,7,11,28 or custom linkers to preserve biomolecules such as lipids8,9 and is capable of expanding tissues inaccessible by other enzyme-free ExM methods5,10. The hydrogel-tissue hybrids preserve the nanoscopic features and cellular connectivity after up to 11-fold expansion, which can be imaged directly using commercial labeling agents applied either before or after expansion. Magnify preserves protein epitopes and other biomolecules allowing for post-Magnify staining, which substantially reduces the linkage errors caused by the size of labeling agents. For example, tubulin measurements taken with Magnify (Supplementary Fig. 6) are closer to EM than unexpanded stained samples47. For new applications, validation of labeling agents is still recommended. When combined with SOFI, Magnify achieves effective resolutions approaching top performers of super-resolution light microscopy, yet does not require special equipment or fluorophores, and is easy to implement. While we did not attempt to demonstrate all possible combinations of biomolecules in the same tissue here, we did demonstrate imaging of four different molecules (DNA, FPs, endogenous lipid and carbohydrates) in the same sample (Fig. 4c,d), as well as dual protein-lipid staining in both PFA-fixed tissue and cell culture. With optimization, it is possible to image four different biomolecules in one PFA-fixed sample with sub-20 nm resolution using Magnify\u2013SOFI. This could be used to study how higher-order chromatin structures are influenced by the nuclear envelope in health and disease states, which requires nanoscale imaging of DNA, histone proteins and lipids.\nDue to the small sizes and fast diffusion rate of monomers, Magnify may have future applicability to thick tissues and whole organisms. Magnify would be readily adaptable to generating nanoscale whole organ datasets, which currently rely on either lower resolution tissue clearing methods (CLARITY, CUBIC-X, iDISCO, and so on), or serial block-face EM. Additionally, even larger EFs could be achieved if integrated with other strategies such as iterative expansion microscopy (iExM)15 or semi-interpenetrating polymer networks10. With large-volume imaging modalities and objectives of 6\u20138 mm working distance (for example, the Olympus \u00d725 0.9 NA and the Leica \u00d725 1.0 NA), tissues up to 0.8 mm thick can be fully expanded with Magnify\nand imaged. Adjusting the size of samples based on external ionic concentrations allows macroscale mapping to be performed in the shrunken state. Expansion in a lower-salinity buffer can allow exploration of smaller scale details all on a conventional imaging system, enabling researchers to generate tissue atlases without the need for specialized equipment. This would decrease imaging time as regions of interest can be identified on the same system before fully expanding samples. The use of fiducial markers to realign images along with custom perfusion systems to expand and shrink samples can facilitate easy coregistration of images.\nBecause Magnify is a chemical strategy that does not rely on complex optics, it offers a flexible framework that can be adapted to a range of imaging modalities, gel chemistries and other ExM strategies. ExM methods have already demonstrated compatibility with existing super-resolution techniques including structured illumination microscopy48, stimulated emission depletion microscopy49 and Single-molecule localization microscopy47,50. Magnify-processed samples could also be implemented in multiplexing strategies, such as DNA barcoding51 and serial immunostaining52. Signal amplification methods, such as FRACTAL52 or immunoSABER53, may be applied to image sparse biomolecules and compensate signal dilution from expansion. Magnify may also enable nanoscale imaging with other modalities, such as stimulated Raman scattering and various mass-spectrometry-based imaging techniques. Finally, Magnify may be implemented in high-content imaging systems, where large datasets can be generated to explore the effect of drug treatments and disease-associated changes on the nanoscale configuration of biomolecules in culture cells and tissue models."

Images of DAPI-stained kidney samples were obtained at ten times magnification before gelation and after homogenization and expansion. Nuclear surface areas were determined using the Analyze Particles tool in FIJI/ ImageJ after image thresholding and binarization. To calculate the linear EF, the square root of the ratio of the average postexpansion nuclear surface area to average pre-expansion surface area was calculated. For specimens with pre-expansion images, immunostained FFPE samples were imaged at four times and ten times magnification. After gelling and homogenization, expanded tissue pieces were imaged at four times and ten times magnification. Regions of interest in postexpanded images were matched to pre-expansion regions of interest and the distance measurement tool in NIS-Elements or FIJI/ImageJ was used to measure feature sizes in both pre- and postexpansion images.\nQuantification of protein retention in FFPE samples After antigen retrieval, FFPE kidney samples stained with NHS-ATTO-488 were imaged at four times and ten times magnification. Due to the long incubation time necessary to homogenize the kidney samples, a separate set of FFPE kidney samples were gelled without NHS ester staining. Samples were homogenized for 60 h at 80 \u00b0C, washed in washing buffer and stained with NHS-ATTO-488. After staining, samples were washed in washing buffer and incubated in 10\u00d7 PBS to achieve an EF closer to the pre-expansion images. Samples were imaged at four times and ten times magnification using the same parameters as the pre-expansion images. Mean fluorescent intensity was calculated over a region of interest (ROI) drawn in NIS-Elements after background subtraction for both pre- and postexpansion images. Mean intensities were averaged over technical replicates, and postexpansion data was scaled by the cubed linear EF to account for volume differences.\nQuantification of protein and lipid retention in mouse brain samples Mouse brain sections were stained with NHS-ATTO-532 and DiD and were imaged at ten times magnification. One sample was stained with NHS-ATTO-532 and DiD with no homogenization, while the rest of the samples were homogenized for varying times in either ProK or hot surfactant, washed and stained with NHS-ATTO-532 and DiD, while the other was stained with NHS-ATTO-532 and DiD with no homogenization.\nSamples were then incubated in 10\u00d7 PBS to achieve an EF closer to the pre-expansion images and were imaged at ten times magnification using the same parameters as the pre-expansion images.

Briefly, pre-expansion SOFI images were taken at a single z plane at \u00d760 magnification and several z planes for the same fields of view (FOVs) were obtained postexpansion at \u00d740 magnification as precise matching of z planes to pre-expansion images can be challenging. To match postexpansion z planes, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) key points were generated for all possible combinations of pairs of the pre-expansion images and postexpansion z projections. Because the sample expands along the z axis and different imaging conditions were used, one pre-expansion z plane should correspond to one postexpansion z projection from 8 to 25 z planes. SIFT key points were generated using the VLFeat open-source library and filtered by random sample consensus (RANSAC) with a geometric model that only permits rotation, translation and uniform scaling. The pair of pre-expansion and postexpansion images with the most SIFT key points were then used for image registration by rotation, translation and uniform scaling, as well as calculation of EFs and distortion vector fields. By subtracting the resulting vectors at any two points, distance measurement errors could easily be sampled, and the RMS error for such measurements was plotted as a function of measurement length from at least three technical replicates."
