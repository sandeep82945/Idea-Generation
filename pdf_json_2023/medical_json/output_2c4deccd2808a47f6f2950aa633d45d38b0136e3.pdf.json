ABSTRACT Introduction Environmental and psychosocial adversities negatively impact children\u2019s developmental outcomes. When these factors are experienced in early childhood\u2014a sensitive period of development\u2014the developing brain can be altered. While these associations have been drawn in highincome countries, it is necessary to understand child growth, neurodevelopment, and the role of environmental factors in developmental trajectories in lowincome settings. The objective of this study is to longitudinally assess how demographic factors, maternal health, maternal development, and child health, are related to child development on a behavioural, cognitive, and neuroimaging level in lowsocioeconomic communities. Methods and analysis Mother\u2013child dyads will be identified in the periurban field sites of Rehri Goth and Ibrahim Hyderi, Karachi, Pakistan. Dyads will undergo yearly assessments for 4 years beginning when the child is 1 month, 3 months or 6 months of age (+\u226430 days of age) (depending on group assignment). Maternal assessments include anthropometry, behavioural, cognitive, and developmental assessments (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Parenting Stress Index; Maternal Autonomy Index; Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream Tool; Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS)), and biological samples collection (breast milk, blood, stool, hair). Children\u2019s assessments include anthropometry, developmental assessments (Global Scales for Early Development (GSED); RIAS), MRI brain assessments, and biological sample collection (blood, stool, hair). Using crosssectional and longitudinal data with statistical analysis tools, associations will be quantified between brain structure (MRI) and connectivity (resting state connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging), general cognitive skills (RIAS, GSED) and environmental influences (nutrition via biological samples, maternal mental health via questionnaires) through repeated measures analysis of variance tests and \u03c7 tests. Quantile regression and cortical analyses will be conducted to understand how demographic factors are related to the associations found. Ethics and dissemination The study has received ethical approval from the Aga Khan University Ethics Review Committee. The study\u2019s findings will be disseminated through scientific publications and project summaries for the participants.",

BMJ Open 2023;13:e070283. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-070283\nof genetic and environmental interactions\u2014modulated through psychosocial and caregiving relationships.3 5 Previous neuroimaging studies provide clear evidence of how these factors can alter the developing brain, particularly when these adversities are experienced during the early life years.6\nInfants are inherently competent in their ability to initiate relationships, explore, seek meaning and learn, but are also vulnerable and depend entirely on caregivers for their survival, emotional security, modelling of behaviours, and to teach them the norms of the physical and sociocultural world that they inhabit.7 This sensitive period, then, is a double- edged sword. While positive and enriching environments can promote healthy brain development, neglect and abuse can impair maturing brain systems and disrupt cognitive and behavioural outcomes.8 9 Early adversities disrupt normative developmental trajectories with lifelong consequences, including impaired intellectual functioning, depression, and other mental health disorders.6 10 Therefore, adversity and resource inequality not only contribute to poor brain development but are also an outcome of it, potentially driving a vicious intergenerational cycle.11\nWhile existing literature on this topic has largely focused on understanding the neurodevelopmental impact of the environmental factors as they exist in highincome areas, literature is evolving to include more data from LMICs\u2014as understanding the nature of adversities in different environments is an important consideration, particularly in LMICs where the burden to do so is greater. Of the studies that aim to understand neurodevelopment, there has been a recent focus on using MRI as the preferred modality of neuroimaging due to its anatomical tissue contract, ability to visualise anatomical structure and physiological function, and its safety in use.12 By using MRI to image young children, there is a greater ability to visualise and understand brain plasticity, and development of perceptual and cognitive skills.13\nThe two major studies conducted on this topic in LMICs were completed in Bangladesh and India. In the Bangladesh Early Adversity Neuroimaging study, associations between psychosocial risks (maternal distress, caregiving experiences), biological risks (growth, inflammation), developmental outcomes (Mullen Scales, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale, Bayley Scales), and neurodevelopment (electroencephalography, MRI) were assessed in children aged 6 months to 7 years.14 In this study, as well as another conducted in India to understand neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants up to 18 months of age, researchers found that adverse factors present in LMIC environments are associated with outcomes on the cognitive and neural level.14 15 These studies highlight the importance of using MRI in LMICs to investigate the impact of these environments.\nDespite the presence of studies in LMICs aimed at explaining children\u2019s neurodevelopment in these environments, there is a decreased understanding of the mechanisms involved in how and why children\u2019s outcomes\nare impacted. These are important considerations because before effective interventions can be designed to minimise adversities and their impact on children\u2019s development and neurodevelopment, it is necessary to understand the role of environmental factors. Knowing that the early years are a time of immense brain development and extremely susceptible to factors in the environment, it is necessary to comprehensively map children\u2019s growth and development\u2014assessing both environmental factors and brain structure continuously in low- resource environments.\nPakistan is among the countries with the highest rates of malnutrition and its progress in perinatal, neonatal and child health has been much slower than in other South Asian countries.16 17 Karachi, the largest metropolitan city in Pakistan and 12th largest city in the world with a linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse population is an excellent surrogate to study the impact of the environment on a child\u2019s development. The primary objective of the current study is to longitudinally map trajectories of child growth and neurodevelopment from early infancy (1 month) to 3.5 years of age using longitudinal MRI scanning and neurodevelopmental assessments in Karachi, Pakistan. The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between modifiable environmental factors (eg, early child nutrition, maternal stress) with evolving brain structure, brain function, and maturing cognitive skills. We hypothesise that children with exposure to conditions like maternal and child malnutrition and adverse childhood experiences will have poor development with macro- level structural brain differences in comparison to children who were not exposed to these conditions."

AKU Hospital in Karachi is connected with many primary healthcare clinics (PHCs) in the peri- urban coastal regions of the city and has a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI machine available on- site. The PHCs are maintained by the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at AKU, and have quarterly household surveillance for key maternal and child health indicators along with antenatal care, immunisation, and physician services for children under the age of 5 years. For these reasons, the provision of services at PHCs connected with the larger tertiary hospital make this area an ideal setting for this study. The study will be conducted at two of these PHCs, Rehri Goth and Ibrahim Hyderi, which have been operating in the communities for over a decade.\nP atna).

The participants will be recruited in three groups: Group 1 will include 100 mother\u2013infant dyads with infants that are 1 month +\u226430 days of age, Group 2 will include 100 mother\u2212infant dyads with infants that are 3 months +\u226430 days of age, and Group 3 will include 50 mother\u2212 infant dyads with infants that are 6 months +\u226430 days of age. As neuroimaging scans in natural sleep are more likely to be successful in infants of younger age and MRI scans with sedation (if needed) may be more challenging to obtain enrolments for, the group sizes of the younger groups (1 month and 3 months) are larger than that of the older infants (6 months). This split will also allow the team to obtain images and samples at different time points during the early childhood period without the need for repetitive sampling of any one mother\u2212 child dyad.\nThe study involves the mother\u2212child dyads completing 4 yearly visits, beginning when the child is an infant (1 month/3 months/6 months) until they are 3 years and 1 month/3 months/6 months of age. Each visit will comprise of the child\u2019s MRI brain scan, followed by the collection of information and biological samples. For the MRI scan, the family will be transported to AKU, accompanied by members of the research team. Once the scan is completed, estimated to take no longer than 1 hour (prescanning (5 min), child placement (10 min), scanning time (30+ min, depending on repeated measures)), the demographic information, maternal physical and mental health assessments, child\u2019s history, child physical health and developmental assessments, and biological samples will be collected on the following day at the PHC at the study site. The collection of the assessments and samples will take approximately 2 hours. The collection procedure of non- MRI data will be adapted to ensure effective use of resources once the MRI scan is successfully performed. Additionally, quality control programmes are in place for data collection to ensure there are no changes in the measurement of variables over the study\u2019s duration. Weekly quality checks will be conducted under the supervision of master trainers for all behavioural, cognitive, and developmental assessment tools used in the study. For the neuroimaging data, to ensure the scanner is operating correctly and producing reliable images, radiologists conduct routine quality control and assurance procedures weekly, such as system checks and calibrations (with a phantom), under the supervision of the biomedical team. In addition, a service engineer performs thorough diagnostic/maintenance tests on a quarterly basis to confirm the machine is working as intended. If there are any machine or software malfunctions, scans will not be completed during that time. Lastly, the quality of biological samples will be checked by the laboratory team and frequent quality management of all collected data will be done by the Data Management Unit. P atna).

            "text": "1. Demographics and history\n\u2013 Demographic/socioeconomic information: Demographic and socioeconomic data will be collected at all four visits. The data will include detailed maternal pregnancy history (gravidity, live births, pregnancy spacing, maternal age at each pregnancy), family composition (child ages and sex), socioeconomic and household asset information (mother and father education and occupation, religion, caste, household income, home size and number of rooms, toilet type, electricity access, number of mobile phones, housing type, cooking fuel, home, land and/ or animal ownership, and transportation access). \u2013 Child\u2019s history: A detailed assessment regarding the child\u2019s wellbeing, comorbidities if any, major hospitalisations, child diarrhoea events, antibiotic use, and vaccination history will be collected at all visits. Labour and delivery information, as well as birth anthropometry, will be obtained from the PRiSMA records.\n2. Maternal assessments \u2013 Physical health assessments:\ni. Anthropometric measurements: Assessment of maternal anthropometry, that is, weight and height, will be recorded using a Calibrated\nWeighing Scale (Seca 874 Mobile Flat Scale) and measuring tape (Seca 212 Measuring Tape), respectively, at all visits.\nii. Biological sample collection: Laboratory investigations of serum iron, total iron- binding capacity (TIBC), red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B- 12 levels, vitamins A and D, blood lead levels, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) will be done at visit 1. A sample of the mother\u2019s hair will be collected at visits 1 and 3 to assess for cortisol. A breastmilk sample (20 mL) will be collected from the mother at visit 1 and the composition (general macronutrient (protein, fat, and carbohydrate content), as well as cholesterol, choline, and vitamin B content) will be determined. Stool sample for faecal microbiome analysis will be collected from the mother at visit 1.\n\u2013 Behavioural and cognitive assessments: Behavioural and cognitive assessments will be administered at all visits.\ni. Maternal mental health: Will be assessed using Urdu translations of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS),19 Parenting Stress Index (PSI) long- form,20 and through collecting the hours of maternal rest per day. The EPDS and PSI have been locally validated.21\u201323\nFigure 1 Summary of measures collected in each of the four visits from both the mother and child. *MRI brain scanning will occur at Aga Khan University main campus.

Maternal autonomy, family violence, addiction and neglect: Will be assessed using Urdutranslated versions of the Maternal Autonomy Index,24 and the Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream Tool,25 which have been locally validated.26 27\n\u2013 Developmental assessment: The Reynolds Intellectual Assessment Scales (RIAS)28 will be used to assess the mother\u2019s development at all visits. The RIAS measures general intelligence and non- verbal intelligence, and is administered to individuals ages 3\u201394. The RIAS has been locally validated.29\n3. Child assessments \u2013 Physical health assessments:\ni. Anthropometric measurements: Weight, height, and head circumference of the child will be recorded using a Calibrated Weighing Scale (Seca 334 Mobile Digital Baby Scale), infant measuring board (Seca 416 Infantometer), and measuring tape (Seca 212 Measuring Tape), respectively. Mid- upper arm circumference will also be measured for children above 6 months of age at every visit. The WHO Z- scores will be used for anthropometric interpretation and standards for weight, length/height, weight- for- length/ height, and head circumference- for- age will be calculated. Child anthropometric measurements will be collected yearly (visits 1\u20134) and analysed within their enrolment group and visit number. ii. Biological sample collection: Laboratory investigations of serum iron, TIBC, RBC folate, vitamin B- 12 levels, vitamins A and D, blood lead levels, and TSH will be completed yearly (visits 1\u20134). Stool samples will be collected yearly (visits 1\u20134) and will be assessed for faecal microbiome (visits 1 and 3) and helminth (visits 2, 3 and 4). Hair sample to assess cortisol levels will be collected at visits 3 and 4. \u2013 Developmental assessments: The Global Scales for Early Development (GSED)30 (0\u20136 years) and RIAS (non- verbal) (3\u221294 years) tools will be used to assess the child\u2019s development. The GSED will be administered at all four visits, while the RIAS will only be administered to the child at visit 4 (when the child is >3 years old).\ni. GSED: The WHO has developed and is currently validating the GSED, which can be used to assess children\u2019s development in the early years of life across the globe, including in Pakistan. As part of this scale, the short- form (SF) and long- form (LF) will be used. Both SF and LF are unidimensional and provide a single age- adjusted score that represents a child\u2019s level of development: The SF uses a caregiver- reported questionnaire while the\nLF is a directly administered (observed) tool assessing the child\u2019s abilities and behaviours. ii. RIAS: The RIAS measures general intelligence and non- verbal intelligence, and is administered to individuals ages 3\u201394. As the participants will be >3 years old only at visit 4, the RIAS will be administered only at that visit.\n\u2013 MRI brain scanning: At each of the four visits, MRI scans (lasting no longer than 1 hour) will be conducted using a 3T MRI machine (Toshiba Titan, Canon Medical Systems) equipped with a 32- channel coil, which provides high field strength, multiphase imaging, and advanced motion correction capabilities. To optimise the functionality and performance of the Titan scanner, the specialised Ventage V.2.5 software will be used. The sequences that will be performed as part of analysis for this study include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), T1- weighted MPRAGE and T2 volume anatomical imaging, and functional MRI (fMRI). Information about the key parameters and sequence timing are included in table 1. As part of the hospital protocol, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and Flow Sensitive Black Blood susceptibility- weighted imaging will also be performed and reviewed by a physician, but these sequences will solely be used for clinical information. The parameters for these sequences are included in online supplemental information, table 1. For MRI brain scanning, the mother and child will be brought to AKU accompanied with members of the research team. Once the child appears to be in deep sleep (15\u201320 min after the child went to sleep), the MRI will be performed. The child will be secured in an immobiliser (MedVac Immobilisation Bag, Infant Splint; MRI Med, Petaluma, California, USA) and transferred from their crib or bed to an MRIcompatible cart. The immobiliser will be used to reduce subtle body movement during the scan (eg, movement from deep sleep breathing). The child\u2019s head will be carefully positioned, and a removable sound- insulating foam insert (Ultra Barrier HD Composite; American Micro Industries, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, USA) will be securely placed on the child\u2019s ears. The process will be facilitated by a research coordinator, and parents will be invited to stay with the infant to allay any anxiety. A paediatric pulse oximeter will be attached to the child\u2019s finger or toe to monitor the child during the scan. A research assistant will remain inside the scanning suite in case the child wakes up during the scan. With children scanned in natural sleep, there is a possibility that they may wake up during the scan. If this happens, the child will be removed from the scanner and nursed and swaddled prior to continuing the scan. The sequences affected by participant motion will be repeated once the child is asleep again. The scan will ideally be performed without sedation at any stage of the scan, using strategies developed by P atna).

For infants up to 3 months, this includes chloral hydrate, 25 mg per kg given orally, while for children 6 months and above, procedural sedation will be used which will be carried out by a credentialed physician and sedation nurse. The sedation medication will be titrated according to the child\u2019s weight, and children requiring sedation will be admitted for pre, intra, and post sedation monitoring. During the follow- up visits, though the imaging data may be difficult to acquire in unsedated toddlers, the scans will be initially attempted in natural sleep. The data will be carefully reviewed to exclude low quality data and data that exceeds our motion threshold. Scans with sedation will be used as a last resort and will be performed rarely due to possible risks that might occur with annual evaluations with sedation."

Participant characteristics will be described using means and SD for continuous variables (anthropometric measurements, maternal behavioural, cognitive, and developmental assessments scoring, and child developmental assessments scoring) and percentages for categorical variables (biological samples, demographics and child\u2019s history information).\nMRI brain analysis will be performed locally, as experts from the funding agency will train the local Data Management Unit team at AKU. MRI data will be quality checked by a radiologist and radiologist technician to ensure there were no abnormalities found, all sequences were completed, and there was limited motion. Visualisation of data will be done using Mango and Horos tools. Analysis of neuroimaging data will be completed using the Flywheel platform and the embedded FreeSurfer, FSL, and MRtrix3 analysis tools. Data will be segmented, skull- stripped, scaled to standard space, and registered to age- matched templates that will be created locally and matched with existing templates (eg, from the National Institute of Health). For structural data, estimates of total brain tissue volume, thickness, and surface area will be acquired. FMRI data will be preprocessed and motion corrected to analyse differences in resting- state activity (as the scans will occur in natural or sedated sleep). Fractional anisotropy values will be obtained from DTI to understand the shape of diffusion and will be visualised with tractography.\nUltimately, patterns of structural and functional development will be characterised, and associations will be conducted between cognitive outcomes and deviations associated with birth outcomes and environmental factors at various time points. Imaging data will be paired with neurocognitive assessments (GSED, RIAS, etc) performed at predetermined intervals (GSED at visits 1\u20134, RIAS at visit 4). We will quantify the associations (eg, with a \u03c72 test) between maternal and child health (via levels of micronutrients in the blood and breast milk) on measures of fetal and infant growth and neurodevelopment.
