1. **Investigate the use of aerogels for the selective removal of uranium from complex aqueous matrices.** Most studies on uranium adsorption by aerogels have been conducted using simple aqueous solutions, which do not accurately represent the complex composition of natural waters and industrial effluents. Future research should focus on developing aerogels that can selectively remove uranium from complex matrices, such as seawater, groundwater, and wastewater. This could be achieved by modifying the surface chemistry of the aerogels or by incorporating specific ligands into the aerogel structure.


2. **Explore the use of aerogels for the simultaneous removal of uranium and other contaminants.** Many contaminated waters contain multiple contaminants, including heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic pollutants. Future research should investigate the use of aerogels for the simultaneous removal of uranium and other contaminants from water. This could be achieved by developing aerogels with a broad range of adsorption properties or by combining different types of aerogels into composite materials.


3. **Develop aerogels that can be easily regenerated and reused.** The regeneration and reuse of aerogels is important for reducing the cost and environmental impact of uranium removal. Future research should focus on developing aerogels that can be easily regenerated and reused without losing their adsorption capacity. This could be achieved by developing aerogels that are resistant to chemical and thermal degradation or by developing methods for removing uranium from aerogels without damaging the aerogel structure.


4. **Investigate the use of aerogels for the recovery of uranium from industrial processes and nuclear waste.** Uranium is a valuable resource that can be recovered from industrial processes and nuclear waste. Future research should investigate the use of aerogels for the recovery of uranium from these sources. This could be achieved by developing aerogels that are selective for uranium and that can be easily regenerated and reused.


5. **Develop aerogels that can be used for the in situ remediation of uranium-contaminated soils and groundwater.** Uranium-contaminated soils and groundwater pose a significant environmental and health risk. Future research should investigate the use of aerogels for the in situ remediation of these sites. This could be achieved by developing aerogels that can be injected into the subsurface and that can slowly release uranium-binding ligands.
