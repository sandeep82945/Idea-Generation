    "abstractText": "In this work, we develop a perturbative method to describe the behavior of a chiral condensate around a spherical black hole whose mass is astrophysically realistic. We use the inverse mass as the expansion parameter for our perturbative series. We test this perturbative method in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole, and we find that it agrees well with previous numerical results. For an astrophysical-mass Schwarzschild black hole, the leading order contribution to the condensate is much larger (in most of space) than the next-to-leading order contribution, providing further evidence for the validity of the perturbative approach. The size of the bubble of restored chiral symmetry is directly proportional to the size of the black hole. Next, we apply this perturbative method to a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) black hole. We find that, as the charge-to-mass ratio increases, the bubble of restored chiral symmetry becomes larger relative to the black hole. This effect is particularly pronounced for nearextremal RN black holes. The case of an extremal RN black hole provides an interesting counterexample to the standard thermal explanation for the formation of a bubble of restored chiral symmetry around a black hole.",

Most of the familiar examples of spontaneous symmetry breaking come from theories formulated in Minkowski spacetime, but it is also possible for spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur in theories on curved backgrounds [1\u20134]. The QCD phase diagram is a matter of great interest to contemporary particle physics. At high energies and/or high temperatures, QCD exhibits chiral symmetry. At low energies and/or temperatures, QCD spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry. If gravity is included in the theory, strong space-time curvature can also cause QCD matter to transition from a phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry to a phase with restored chiral symmetry [5\u20138]. Such strong curvature can be found in the vicinity of black holes. In ref. [8], the authors found that the chiral condensate approaches zero near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. Thus, the event horizon is surrounded by a \u201cbubble\u201d of approximately restored chiral symmetry. As the mass of the black hole increases, the\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nradius of this bubble (relative to the radius of the black hole) decreases. At the boundary of the bubble, a second-order phase transition takes place, in which the chiral-symmetric phase inside the bubble meets the chiral-broken phase in the wider universe.\nThroughout this article, we restrict our discussion to astrophysical-mass black holes, whose masses are much larger than the Planck scale. Because of this, we can use the inverse mass (in Planck units) as a small expansion parameter. We use this perturbative approach to greatly simplify the equations of motion for the condensate \u03c3. We apply this method to Schwarzschild black holes, and we find that the results thereby obtained are consistent with the numerical results obtained in ref. [8]. Having confirmed the validity of the perturbative approach for Schwarzschild black holes, we apply the method to Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes (which possess electric charge but no angular momentum). As far as we know, this is the first time that the behavior of a chiral condensate around a charged black hole has been investigated.\nIn flat spacetime, there is a critical temperature Tc that marks the boundary between the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry (T < Tc) and the phase with restored chiral symmetry (T > Tc) [8, 9]. At any point, the Tolman temperature gives the effective local temperature of spacetime [8]. As one approaches the event horizon of the black hole, the Tolman temperature increases without bound. Assuming that the asymptotic temperature is smaller than Tc, the Tolman temperature will cross Tc at some finite radius outside the event horizon. Thus, one intuitively expects that the chiral condensate will transition from a spontaneously broken phase far away from the horizon to a restored phase close to the horizon. This is the usual argument explaining why chiral symmetry is restored close to the horizon [8]. However, we find that this intuitive argument fails for an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole.\nThroughout this article, we use Planck units, so that c = G = ~ = 4\u03c0 0 = kB = 1.\n2 Effective action for general black hole space-time\nIn a Minkowski background, a general, spherically-symmetric black hole metric takes the form\nds2 = \u2212f (r) dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 d\u21262, (2.1)\nwhere d\u21262 is the line element on the two-sphere. Every black hole has a temperature TBH. To account for thermal effects, we work in Euclidean time. The Euclidean time direction is periodic, and its period is equal to the inverse temperature \u03b2. In Euclidean time, we may write the metric as\nds2 = f (r) dt2 + f (r)\u22121 dr2 + r2 d\u21262. (2.2)\nWe model baryonic matter by a four-fermion interaction with interaction strength \u03bb. Let N be the total number of different types of quarks, counting both flavors and colors. We may write the classical action as [8]\nS = \u222b d4x { \u03c8 i\u03b3\u00b5\u2207\u00b5\u03c8 + \u03bb 2N ( \u03c8\u03c8 )2} . (2.3)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\n(The astute reader may notice that there is no factor of \u221ag beside the volume element in eq. (2.3). This is because the determinant of the metric in Schwarzschild spacetime is identical to that in Minkowski spacetime.) We define the condensate \u03c3 as\n\u03c3 = \u2212 \u03bb N \u3008\u03c8\u03c8\u3009. (2.4)\nLet us introduce the new variables \u03a3\u00b1, which are defined by\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c32 \u00b1 \u221a f d\u03c3\ndr . (2.5)\nNote that f is short for f (r). Let us define \u03c9\u03bd (u) as\n\u03c9\u03bd (u) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 (\u22121)n n\u2212\u03bdK\u03bd (n\u03b2u) . (2.6)\nTo approximate the effective action, we use a resummed heat kernel expansion. To secondorder in the resummed heat kernel expansion, we may write the effective action \u0393 [\u03c3] as [5, 6, 8]\n\u0393 [\u03c3] = \u03b2 \u222b d3~x L, (2.7)\nwhere ~x are the spatial coordinates. The Lagrangian density L is given by [5, 6, 8]\nL = \u2212\u03c3 2 2\u03bb + f\u22122 32\u03c02 (L+ + L\u2212) + 1 32\u03c02 \u03b4L. (2.8)\nThe Lagrangian pieces L\u00b1 and \u03b4L are given by\nL\u00b1 = 3 4\u03a3 2 \u00b1 \u2212 (1 2\u03a3 2 \u00b1 + a\u00b1 ) ln ( f\u03a3\u00b1 `2 ) + 16\u03a3\u00b1 f\u03b22 \u03c92 (\u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 ) + 4a\u00b1\u03c90 (\u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 ) (2.9)\nand \u03b4L = ( \u03a32+ + \u03a32\u2212 ) ln f 2 \u2212 (\u03a3+ + \u03a3\u2212) 12f\n{( df\ndr\n)2 \u2212 2f d 2f\ndr2 + 4f r df dr\n} . (2.10)\nWith a little algebra, we may rewrite \u03b4L as \u03b4L = ( \u03c34 + f ( d\u03c3\ndr\n)2) ln f \u2212 \u03c3 2\n6f\n{( df\ndr\n)2 \u2212 2f d 2f\ndr2 + 4f r df dr\n} . (2.11)\nLet \u2206Eucl be the Laplacian for three-dimensional Euclidean space. We may write a\u00b1 as (see appendix A for derivation)\na\u00b1 = asp + f (r)2\n6 \u2206Eucl (f\u03a3\u00b1) , (2.12)\nwhere the pure space-time contribution asp is given by\nasp = 1\n180\n{ 2f (r)2\nr4 \u2212 8f (r)\n3\nr4 + 6f (r)\n4\nr4 + 8f (r)\n2\nr3 f \u2032 (r)\u2212 12f (r)\n3\nr3 f \u2032 (r)+ 6f (r)\n2\nr2 f \u2032 (r)2\u2212 4f (r)\n2\nr2 f \u2032\u2032 (r)\n+6f (r) 3 r2 f \u2032\u2032 (r)\u2212 6f (r) 2 r f \u2032 (r)f \u2032\u2032 (r)+ 32f (r) 2 f \u2032\u2032 (r)2\u2212 6f (r) 3 r f (3) (r)\u2212f (r)2 f \u2032 (r)f (3) (r)\n\u22122f (r)3 f (4) (r) } .\n(2.13)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nWe assume the black hole is of astrophysical size, which means that \u03b2 is very large. Therefore, let us make the following assumptions:\n\u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3+ 1, (2.14) \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u2212 1. (2.15)\nLater, we will verify that these assumptions are satisfied in most of space. The Bessel functions K\u03bd (x) decay exponentially for large values of x. Therefore, if eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) are satisfied, the Lagrangian terms involving \u03c90 (\u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 ) and \u03c92 (\u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 ) are exponentially suppressed. Hence, we may simplify the Lagrangian pieces L\u00b1 to\nL\u00b1 = 3 4\u03a3 2 \u00b1 \u2212 (1 2\u03a3 2 \u00b1 + a\u00b1 ) ln ( f\u03a3\u00b1 `2 ) . (2.16)\nWith some algebraic manipulation, we may write the sum L+ + L\u2212 as L++L\u2212= (3 2\u2212ln ( f `2 ))( \u03c34+f ( d\u03c3 dr )2) \u2212 12 ( \u03a32+ ln\u03a3++\u03a32\u2212 ln\u03a3\u2212 ) \u2212 f (r) 2 3 \u2206Eucl ( f\u03c32 ) ln ( f `2 ) \u2212asp ln ( \u03c34\u2212f ( d\u03c3\ndr\n)2) \u2212 f (r) 2\n6 \u2206Eucl (f\u03a3+) ln\u03a3+\u2212 f (r)2\n6 \u2206Eucl (f\u03a3\u2212) ln\u03a3\u2212. (2.17)\n(Note that we have omitted a term that does not depend on \u03c3.) Recall that the effective action \u0393 [\u03c3] is given by\n\u0393 [\u03c3] = \u03b2 \u222b d3~xL (2.18)\nand that the total Lagrangian L is given by\nL = \u2212\u03c3 2 2\u03bb + f\u22122 32\u03c02 (L+ + L\u2212) + 1 32\u03c02 \u03b4L. (2.19)\nFor convenience, let us introduce the quantities A and B, which are defined as\nA= (3 2\u2212ln ( f `2 ))( \u03c34+f ( d\u03c3 dr )2) \u2212 12 ( \u03a32+ ln\u03a3++\u03a32\u2212 ln\u03a3\u2212 ) \u2212asp ln ( \u03c34\u2212f ( d\u03c3 dr )2) ,\n(2.20) B=\u221213\u2206Eucl ( f\u03c32 ) ln ( f `2 ) \u2212 16\u2206Eucl (f\u03a3+) ln\u03a3+\u2212 1 6\u2206Eucl (f\u03a3\u2212) ln\u03a3\u2212. (2.21)\nFrom eqs. (2.17) and (2.19), we see that the Lagrangian may be written as\nL = \u2212\u03c3 2 2\u03bb + f\u22122 32\u03c02A+ 1 32\u03c02B + 1 32\u03c02 \u03b4L. (2.22)\nCombining eqs. (2.17), (2.18), and (2.22), we may write the effective action as \u0393[\u03c3] = \u03b232\u03c02 \u222b d3~x ( \u221213\u2206Eucl ( f\u03c32 ) ln ( f `2 ) \u2212 16\u2206Eucl (f\u03a3+) ln\u03a3+\u2212 1 6\u2206Eucl (f\u03a3\u2212) ln\u03a3\u2212 ) +. . . , (2.23)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nwhere . . . represents terms that do not depend involve the Laplacian \u2206Eucl. Using Green\u2019s first identity, we may rewrite eq. (2.23) as \u0393[\u03c3] = \u03b232\u03c02 \u222b d3~x ( 1 3\u2207Eucl ( f\u03c32 ) \u00b7\u2207Euclf f + 16\u2207Eucl (f\u03a3+)\u00b7 \u2207\u03a3+ \u03a3+ + 16\u2207Eucl (f\u03a3\u2212)\u00b7 \u2207\u03a3\u2212 \u03a3\u2212\n) +. . . . (2.24)\nTaking advantage of spherical symmetry, we may rewrite eq. (2.24) (after some algebra) as\n\u0393 [\u03c3] = \u03b232\u03c02 \u222b d3~x ( 2 3 df dr d ( \u03c32 ) dr + \u03c3 2 3f ( df dr )2 + f6\u03a3+ ( d\u03a3+ dr )2 + f6\u03a3\u2212 ( d\u03a3\u2212 dr )2) + . . . .\n(2.25) Thus, we may rewrite the Lagrangian piece B as\nB = 23 df dr\nd ( \u03c32 )\ndr + \u03c3\n2\n3f\n( df\ndr )2 + f6\u03a3+ ( d\u03a3+ dr )2 + f6\u03a3\u2212 ( d\u03a3\u2212 dr )2 . (2.26)\n3 Large Schwarzschild black hole\n3.1 Expansion in powers of M\u22121\nLet us consider a large Schwarzschild black hole with mass M 1 in Planck units. The metric function f (r) is given by\nf (r) = 1\u2212 2M r . (3.1)\nWith this metric function, the quantity asp takes the form [10]\nasp = 4M2 5r6 ( 1\u2212 2M r )2 . (3.2)\nSo far, we have been working in Planck units. However, for an astrophysical black hole, the mass M should be at least a few solar masses. One solar mass is around 1038 Planck masses. Therefore, the Schwarzschild radius of an astrophysical black hole will be at least \u223c 1038 Planck lengths. Thus, the metric tensor and its derivatives will hardly change at all if r changes by a Planck length. Since the profile of \u03c3 as a function of r depends on the properties of space-time, it is reasonable to expect that \u03c3\u2032 (r) will be very small. To obtain a better description, we rescale our unit of length by a factor of M . As a result, we have a new radial coordinate R, which is given by\nR = r M . (3.3)\nUnder this coordinate transformation, derivatives will transform as\ndn drn \u2212\u2192 1 Mn dn dRn . (3.4)\nWe may write the metric function f (R) as\nf (R) = 1\u2212 2 R . (3.5)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nThus, in this new coordinate system, the event horizon is located at R = 2. Because eq. (3.5) does not contain any very large or very small coefficients, we see that the coordinate R is well-suited to capturing the spatial variation in the properties of space-time. Therefore, it is also well-suited to capturing the spatial variation in \u03c3. Plugging eq. (3.3) into eq. (3.2), we find that\nasp = 4 5M4R6 ( 1\u2212 2 R )2 . (3.6)\nIn ref. [8], the authors employed non-perturbative, numerical methods to solve for the condensate \u03c3 (r). That work considered black holes whose mass was within a few orders of magnitude of the Planck mass. Since the black holes considered here are much larger, it is more convenient to expand the Lagrangian L in powers of M\u22121. Keeping terms up to M\u22122, we may write the Lagrangian pieces A, B, and \u03b4L as [10]\nA = (3 2 \u2212 ln ( f `2 ))( \u03c34 + f M2 ( d\u03c3 dR )2) \u2212 12 ( \u03a32+ ln \u03a3+ + \u03a32\u2212 ln \u03a3\u2212 ) , (3.7)\nB = 8\u03c33M2R2 d\u03c3 dR + 4\u03c3\n2\n3M2R4f + f 6M2\u03a3+ ( d\u03a3+ dR )2 + f6M2\u03a3\u2212 ( d\u03a3\u2212 dR )2 , (3.8)\n\u03b4L = ( \u03c34 + f\nM2\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2) ln f \u2212 \u03c3 2\n3f ( 8 M2R3 \u2212 14 M2R4 ) . (3.9)\nTo further simplify eqs. (3.7) and (3.8), we must expand ln \u03a3\u00b1 and \u03a3\u22121\u00b1 in powers of M\u22121. We may write \u03a3\u00b1 as\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c32 ( 1\u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR\n) . (3.10)\nThus, we may write ln \u03a3\u00b1 and \u03a3\u22121\u00b1 as\nln \u03a3\u00b1 = ln ( \u03c32 ) + ln ( 1\u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR\n) , (3.11)\n\u03a3\u22121\u00b1 = 1 \u03c32\n( 1\u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR\n)\u22121 . (3.12)\nUsing Taylor series (up to second order in M\u22121), we may re-express ln \u03a3\u00b1 and \u03a3\u22121\u00b1 as\nln \u03a3\u00b1 = ln ( \u03c32 ) \u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR \u2212 f2M2\u03c34\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2 , (3.13)\n\u03a3\u22121\u00b1 = 1 \u03c32\n( 1\u2213 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR + f M2\u03c34\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2) . (3.14)\nNext, we plug eqs. (3.13) and (3.14) into eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) (again keeping terms only up to M\u22122) to obtain\nA = \u2212 ln ( f\u03c32\n`2\n)( \u03c34 + f\nM2\n( d\u03c3\ndR )2) + 32\u03c3 4, (3.15)\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nB = 8\u03c33M2R2 d\u03c3 dR + 4\u03c3\n2\n3M2R4f + 4f 3M2 ( d\u03c3 dR )2 . (3.16)\nThus, we may write the total Lagrangian as\nL=\u2212\u03c3 2 2\u03bb+ f\u22122 32\u03c02\n( \u2212 ln ( f\u03c32\n`2\n)( \u03c34+ f\nM2\n( d\u03c3\ndR )2) + 32\u03c3 4 )\n+ 132\u03c02\n( 8\u03c3\n3M2R2 d\u03c3 dR \u2212 8\u03c3\n2 3M2R3f + 6\u03c32 M2R4f + 4f3M2\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2 + ( \u03c34+ f\nM2\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2) lnf ) (3.17)\nSince L is spherically symmetric, we may write the effective action as\n\u0393 [\u03c3] = \u03b2 \u222b dRR2L. (3.18)\nThus, we may write the Euler-Lagrange equation as\n\u2202L \u2202\u03c3 \u2212 d dR ( \u2202L \u2202\u03c3\u2032 ) \u2212 2 R \u2202L \u2202\u03c3\u2032 = 0. (3.19)\nPlugging eq.

(3.21)\nAt leading order (meaning without any M dependence), we may write the equation of motion (eq. (3.20)) as\n\u2212 \u03c30 \u03bb\n+ f \u22122\n32\u03c02\n( \u22124 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) \u03c330 + 4\u03c330 ) + 132\u03c02 ( 4\u03c330 ln f ) = 0. (3.22)\nClearly, there is trivial solution \u03c30 = 0 to eq. (3.22). However, we expect \u03c30 to be generally non-zero. Therefore, with some simple algebra, we may rewrite eq. (3.22) as\n\u2212 12\u03bb + f\u22122 16\u03c02 ( \u03c320 \u2212 \u03c320 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) + f2 ln (f)\u03c320 ) = 0. (3.23)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nWe may solve this equation to obtain (see appendix B) \u03c320 = \u2212 8\u03c02f2 \u03bb [ W\u22121 ( \u2212 8\u03c0 2 e\u03bb`2 f3\u2212f 2 )]\u22121 . (3.24) Eq. (3.24) provides an expression for \u03c320. Therefore, there are two possible expressions for \u03c30, which differ from each other by a sign. Note that the Lagrangian L (eq. (3.17)) and the equation of motion (eq. (3.20)) are both symmetric under the transformation \u03c3 \u2192 \u2212\u03c3. Therefore, it does not matter which expression for \u03c30 we choose. For simplicity, we will choose the positive sign. Thus, we may write \u03c30 as\n\u03c30 = \u221a \u22128\u03c0 2f2\n\u03bb\n[ W\u22121 ( \u2212 8\u03c0 2\ne\u03bb`2 f3\u2212f2\n)]\u22121 . (3.25)\nBelow, we have graphed \u03c30 (r) for several different combinations of \u03bb and ` [10]. As we will demonstrate in the next subsection, \u03c30 provides a very close approximation to \u03c3 almost everywhere outside the event horizon. Therefore, we would like to compare the results obtained in figure 1 to the results obtained in ref. [8]. As in ref. [8], the condensate \u03c3 asymptotically approaches a constant, non-zero value far from the event horizon, indicating a phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. Close to the event horizon, \u03c3 approaches zero, illustrating a phase of restored chiral symmetry. In ref. [8], the authors work with black holes far smaller than the astrophysical-mass black holes considered here. They found that, as the mass of the black hole increases, the size of the bubble of restored chiral symmetry decreases (relative to the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole). For their black holes, the bubbles expanded out to \u223c 10 \u2212 30 Schwarzschild radii. In figure 1, the bubble extends out to \u223c 2 \u2212 3 Schwarzschild radii. Hence, we see that our results are consistent with the results of ref. [8], in that larger black\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nholes create smaller bubbles of restored chiral symmetry (relative to their Schwarzschild radii). However, for very large black holes (like the astrophysical-mass black holes considered here), the size of the bubble scales almost linearly with the mass of the black hole.\n3.3 Next-to-leading order condensate profile\nFrom eq. (3.17), we see that L contains terms proportional to ln \u03c3. We wish to expand this term in powers of M\u22122. To do this, we must first rewrite eq. (3.21) as\n\u03c3 (r) = \u03c30 (R) (\n1 + \u03c32 (R) M2 \u03c30 (R)\n+ . . . ) . (3.26)\nUsing the Mercator series for the natural logarithm, we may write ln \u03c3 as\nln \u03c3 = ln \u03c30 + \u03c32 M2 \u03c30 \u2212 12\n( \u03c32\nM2 \u03c30\n)2 + . . . (3.27)\nAt next-to-leading order (terms proportional to M\u22122), we may write the equation of motion (eq. (3.20)) as\n\u2212 \u03c32 \u03bb\n+ f \u22122\n32\u03c02\n( \u221212 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) \u03c320\u03c32 + 4\u03c320\u03c32 \u2212 2f \u03c30 ( d\u03c30 dR )2)\n+ 132\u03c02 ( 8 3R2 d\u03c30 dR \u2212 16\u03c303R3f + 12\u03c30 R4f + 12\u03c320\u03c32 ln f )\n\u2212 132\u03c02 d dR\n( \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 + 8f 3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR )\n\u2212 116\u03c02R\n( \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 + 8f 3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR ) = 0.\n(3.28)\nSolving eq. (3.28) for \u03c32, we obtain\n\u03c32 = 1\n32\u03c02 { \u2212 83R2 d\u03c30 dR + 16\u03c303R3f \u2212 12\u03c30 R4f + 2f \u22121\n\u03c30\n( d\u03c30 dR )2 + d dR ( \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 + 8f 3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR )\n+ 2 R\n( \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 + 8f 3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR )}\n\u00d7 { \u2212 1 \u03bb + f \u22122 32\u03c02 ( \u221212 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) \u03c320 + 4\u03c320 + 12\u03c320 f2 ln f\n)}\u22121 (3.29)\nBecause the explicit expression for \u03c32 (R) is extremely complicated, we will not write it down here. Below, we have graphed \u03c32 (R) for several different combinations of \u03bb and ` [10]. In the perturbative expansion for \u03c3, \u03c32 has a coefficient of M\u22122. Since \u03c32 is smaller than \u03c30 almost everywhere outside the event horizon, the profile of \u03c3 outside the horizon is dominated by the contribution from \u03c30.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFigure 2. Graph of \u03c32 (R) with respect to R.\n3.4 Verification of the perturbative approach To obtain the above results for \u03c30 and \u03c32, we had to make three assumptions. First, we assumed that \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 for both \u03a3+ and \u03a3\u2212. Second, we assumed that \u03c3 varies on scales far larger than the Planck scale. Lastly, we assumed that \u03c3 can be expanded perturbatively in powers of M\u22122. We wish to verify that these assumptions hold almost everywhere outside the event horizon. We start by verifying the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1. As discussed earlier, an astrophysical black hole should have a mass of at least \u223c 1038 Planck masses. The inverse temperature \u03b2 is given by [11, 12]\n\u03b2 = 8\u03c0M. (3.30)\nTherefore, \u03b2 should be at least \u223c 1039. Hence, we see that the assumption is satisfied if f\u03a3\u00b1 10\u221278. We may write \u03a3\u00b1 as\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c32 \u00b1 \u221a f\nM\nd\u03c3 dR . (3.31)\nNext, we use eq. (3.21) to expand \u03a3\u00b1 in powers of M\u22121. Keeping terms up to M\u22122, we find that\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c320 + 2 M2\n\u03c30\u03c32 \u00b1 \u221a f\nM d\u03c30 dR . (3.32)\nFortunately, we already have expressions for \u03c30 and \u03c32. Below, we graph the functions f (R) \u03a3+ (R) and f (R) \u03a3\u2212 (R) for M = 1039 Planck masses (a stellar-mass black hole) and M = 1048 Planck masses (a very large supermassive black hole) [10]. From figures 3 and 4, we see that the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 may be violated very close to the event horizon. However, the region where this occurs only extends out to (R\u2212 2) < 10\u22123, or less than one thousandth of a Schwarzschild radius outside the event horizon. Thus, the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 holds almost everywhere outside the event horizon.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFigure 3.

The curves for M = 1039 Planck masses and M = 1048 Planck masses are indistinguishable on the graph.\nNext, we verify the assumption that \u03c3 varies on scales far larger than the Planck scale. In terms of the original Planck-scale coordinate r, we may write this condition as d\u03c3\ndr 1. (3.33)\nRewriting eq. (3.33) in terms of the rescaled coordinate R, we obtain\nd\u03c3 dR M. (3.34)\nUp to second-order in M\u22121, we may write \u03c3 as\n\u03c3 (R) = \u03c30 (R) + \u03c32 (R) M2 . (3.35)\nFortunately, we already have expressions for \u03c30 and \u03c32. Below, we graph the derivative of \u03c3 (R) for M = 1039 Planck masses and M = 1048 Planck masses [10]. We see that eq. (3.34) is satisfied everywhere outside the event horizon. Finally, we verify the assumption that \u03c3 can be expanded perturbatively in powers of M\u22122, as in eq. (3.21). This assumption holds if and only if |\u03c32/M2| \u03c30, or equivalently, |\u03c32|/\u03c30 M2. From figures 1 and 2, it is easy to see that |\u03c32| < \u03c30 in most of the space outside the event horizon. Thus, |\u03c32|/\u03c30 M2 almost everywhere outside the event horizon. Having verified all three assumptions, we conclude that the perturbative analysis is valid almost everywhere outside the event horizon.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\n4 Large Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole\nLet us consider a large Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m (RN) black hole with mass M 1 in Planck units. We denote the charge of this black hole by Q. The event horizon radius r+ is given by [12, 13]\nr+ = M + \u221a M2 \u2212Q2. (4.1)\nThe metric function f (r) is given by [13]\nf (r) = 1\u2212 2M r + Q 2 r2 . (4.2)\nWe assume that the black hole is sub-extremal or extremal, so that |Q| \u2264 M [13]. As in the Schwarzschild case, we assume that the event horizon radius sets the natural scale of variation for the condensate \u03c3. Thus, we define a new radial coordinate R, which is given by\nR = r M . (4.3)\nIn this new coordinate system, we may write the metric function f (R) as\nf (R) = 1\u2212 2 R + Q 2 M2R2 . (4.4)\nLet us expand the condensate \u03c3 in powers of M\u22122 as\n\u03c3 (R) = \u03c30 (R) + \u03c32 (R) M2 + . . . (4.5)\nWe may write \u03c30 and \u03c32 as (see appendix C)\n\u03c30 = \u221a \u22128\u03c0 2f2\n\u03bb\n[ W\u22121 ( \u2212 8\u03c0 2\ne\u03bb`2 f3\u2212f2\n)]\u22121 , (4.6)\n\u03c32 = 1\n32\u03c02\n{ 2f\u22121\n\u03c30\n( d\u03c30 dR )2 \u2212 83R2 ( 1\u2212 Q 2 M2R ) d\u03c30 dR\n\u2212 8\u03c303R4f\n( 1\u2212 Q 2\nM2R )2 + 2\u03c303f ( 8 R3 \u2212 14 R4 + 24Q 2 M2R5 \u2212 10Q 2 M2R4 \u2212 8Q 4 M4R6 )\n+ d dR\n[ \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 ( 1\u2212 Q 2 M2R ) + 8f3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR ]\n+ 2 R\n[ \u22122f\u22121 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) d\u03c30 dR + 8\u03c303R2 ( 1\u2212 Q 2 M2R ) + 8f3 d\u03c30 dR + 2f ln (f) d\u03c30 dR ]}\n\u00d7 { \u2212 1 \u03bb + f \u22122 32\u03c02 ( \u221212\u03c320 ln ( f\u03c320 `2 ) + 4\u03c320 + 12\u03c320 f2 ln f )}\u22121 .\n(4.7)\nBelow, we graph \u03c30 and \u03c32 for several different values of the charge-to-mass ratio Q/M [10]. (In all the graphs, we set \u03bb = 10\u22122 and ` = 103.) Unlike the Schwarzschild case, the\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFigure 6.

Graph of \u03c32 with respect to rr+ .\nevent horizon for a Reissner-Nordst\u00f6m black hole will be located at different values of R depending on the charge-to-mass ratio Q/M . Therefore, the horizontal axis will be in units of the dimensionless ratio r/r+. In the perturbative expansion for \u03c3, \u03c32 has a coefficient of M\u22122. Since \u03c32 is smaller than \u03c30 almost everywhere outside the event horizon, the profile of \u03c3 outside the horizon is dominated by the contribution from \u03c30. (In appendix D, we demonstrate that the perturbative approach is valid almost everywhere outside the event horizon. Thus, higher-order effects should not significantly change the condensate profile displayed in figure 6.)\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFrom figure 6, we see that the bubble of restored chiral symmetry becomes larger as Q/M increases. This effect is particularly pronounced for near-extremal black holes (Q/M \u2248 1), as there is a much greater difference between the Q2/M2 = 0.9 and Q2/M2 = 1.0 curves than between Q2/M2 = 0.75 and Q2/M2 = 0.9 curves.\nFor an extremal black hole, the asymptotic temperature is zero [11, 12]. Therefore, the local Tolman temperature is zero everywhere (see ref. [8] for the definition of the Tolman temperature). However, from figure 6, we see that a bubble of restored chiral symmetry still forms, surrounded by a region of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry that fills the rest of spacetime. This contradicts the usual explanation for the formation of bubbles of restored symmetry around black holes, which attributes this phenomenon to the increased local (Tolman) temperature near the event horizon.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this article, we have examined the behavior of a chiral condensate outside a spherically symmetric, astrophysical-mass black hole. For a Schwarzschild black hole, the behavior of the chiral condensate is consistent with the results from ref. [8]. Encouraged by this, we proceeded to analyze the behavior of a chiral condensate in the presence of a charged (Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m) black hole. Here, we find that radius of the bubble of restored chiral symmetry increases as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. However, the radius of the bubble never reaches infinity, even for an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. Thus, the chiral condensate always exhibits a phase of restored chiral symmetry close to the event horizon and a phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry far away from the horizon.\nUnfortunately, it may prove difficult to test any of the predictions made in this article, since the bubble of restored chiral symmetry around an astrophysical black hole would only extend out to a few Schwarzschild radii. Therefore, in the future, we would like to investigate possible empirical signatures of chiral symmetry restoration that could be detected from Earth. For example, the restoration of chiral symmetry close to the black hole could alter the behavior of matter swirling into it, which might produce detectable radiation signatures.\nIn theory, the effect of curved spacetime on a chiral condensate would not be confined to black holes. Much subtler effects could occur due to the curvature of spacetime around the Earth. This could cause a very small difference in the proton mass (or the mass of some other hadron) depending on altitude. With sufficiently sensitive equipment, such a difference might be observable. Although these possibilities for experimental verification remain highly speculative, there is a tantalizing chance that gravity could provide an entirely new experimental window on the QCD phase diagram.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Dr. Laith Haddad for many interesting conversations and invaluable pieces of advice, as well as for his kind encouragement.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nA Derivation of eq.

Comparison of the two possible solutions for \u03c320 (R).\nBecause we are working in Euclideanized space-time, f is positive everywhere. Therefore, the argument of w (x) in eq. (B.7) will be negative everywhere. For negative arguments, the Lambert W function has two branches: W0 (x) and W\u22121 (x). From previous numerical results, we expect that there exists a region of restored chiral symmetry close to the event horizon [8]. Below, we graph both solutions for \u03c320 (R) (corresponding to both branches of the Lambert W function) [10]. From figure 8, we see that only the W\u22121 solution restores chiral symmetry close to the event horizon. Thus, we may rewrite eq. (B.7) as\n\u03c320 = \u2212 8\u03c02f2\n\u03bb\n[ W\u22121 ( \u2212 8\u03c0 2\ne\u03bb`2 f3\u2212f\n2 )]\u22121\n. (B.8)\nC Derivation of eqs.

(C.2)\nSince Q can be no larger thanM , asp must be of orderM\u22124 or smaller. We will approximate the Lagrangian to order M\u22122.

(C.5)\nIn eqs. (C.3)\u2013(C.5), we have accounted for the fact that Q and M are at similar scales for a near-extremal RN black hole. Even though we have approximated the Lagrangian to the order of M\u22122, some terms contain factors of M\u22124 or M\u22126. This occurs because of the possibility that factors of Q could \u201craise\u201d these terms up to order M\u22122 or higher. As in the Schwarzschild case, we may write \u03a3\u00b1 as\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c32 ( 1\u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR\n) . (C.6)\nIn eqs. (3.13) and (3.14), we derived Taylor series approximations for ln \u03a3\u00b1 and \u03a3\u22121\u00b1 . Fortunately, these approximations are still valid in RN spacetime. Explicitly,\nln \u03a3\u00b1 = ln ( \u03c32 ) \u00b1 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR \u2212 f2M2\u03c34\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2 , (C.7)\n\u03a3\u22121\u00b1 = 1 \u03c32\n( 1\u2213 \u221a f\nM\u03c32 d\u03c3 dR + f M2\u03c34\n( d\u03c3\ndR\n)2) .

(C.15)\nWe look for non-trival solutions, where \u03c3 is not constant and approaches a non-zero value at spatial infinity. Therefore, we may rewrite eq.

(3.23), except that f (r) is now given by the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m metric instead of the Schwarzschild metric.

First, we assumed that \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 for both \u03a3+ and \u03a3\u2212. Second, we assumed that \u03c3 varies on scales far larger than the Planck scale. Lastly, we assumed that \u03c3 can be expanded perturbatively in powers of M\u22122. We wish to verify that these assumptions hold almost everywhere outside the event horizon.\nLet us first verify the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1. As discussed earlier, an astrophysical\nblack hole should have a mass of at least \u223c 1038 Planck masses. The inverse temperature \u03b2 is given by [11, 12]\n\u03b2 = 4\u03c0r+ ( 1\u2212 Q 2\nr2+\n)\u22121 . (D.1)\nFrom eqs. (D.1) and (4.1), we see that \u03b2 \u2265 4\u03c0M . Therefore, \u03b2 should be at least \u223c 1039. Hence, we see that the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 is satisfied if f\u03a3\u00b1 10\u221278. We may write \u03a3\u00b1 as\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c32 \u00b1 \u221a f\nM\nd\u03c3 dR . (D.2)\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFigure 9. Graph of f \u2217 \u03a3+ with respect to r/r+, with \u03bb = 10\u22122 and ` = 103.\nNext, we use eq. (3.21) to expand \u03a3\u00b1 in powers of M\u22121. Keeping terms up to M\u22122, we find that\n\u03a3\u00b1 = \u03c320 + 2 M2\n\u03c30\u03c32 \u00b1 \u221a f\nM d\u03c30 dR . (D.3)\nFortunately, we already have expressions for \u03c30 and \u03c32. Below, we graph the functions f (R) \u03a3+ (R) and f (R) \u03a3\u2212 (R) for M = 1039 Planck masses and several different values of the charge ratio Q/M [10]. From figures 3 and 4, we see that the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 may be violated very close to the event horizon. Nevertheless, it is also clear from these\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nFigure 11. Graph of \u03c3\u2032 (R) (the derivative of \u03c3 (R) with respect to R) as a function of r/r+, with \u03bb = 10\u22122 and ` = 103.\ngraphs that the assumption \u03b2 \u221a f\u03a3\u00b1 1 holds almost everywhere outside the event horizon. Next, let us verify the assumption that \u03c3 varies on scales far larger than the Planck scale. In terms of the original Planck-scale coordinate r, we may write this condition as d\u03c3 dr 1. (D.4) Rewriting eq. (D.4) in terms of the rescaled coordinate R, we obtain\nd\u03c3 dR M. (D.5)\nUp to second-order in M\u22121, we may write \u03c3 as\n\u03c3 (R) = \u03c30 (R) + \u03c32 (R) M2 . (D.6)\nFortunately, we already have expressions for \u03c30 and \u03c32. Below, we graph \u03c3\u2032 (R) forM = 1039 Planck masses and several different values of Q/M [10]. From this graph, we see that eq. (D.5) is satisfied everywhere outside the event horizon. (To account for the different event horizon radii for different values of Q/M , we will plot all the curves with respect to r/r+. However, the curves will still represent the derivative of \u03c3 (R) with respect to R.) Finally, we verify the assumption that \u03c3 can be expanded perturbatively in powers of M\u22122, as in eq. (3.21). This means that |\u03c32/M2| \u03c30, or equivalently, |\u03c32|/\u03c30 M2. From figures 6 and 7, it is easy to see that \u03c32 < \u03c30 in most of the space outside the event horizon. Thus, \u03c32/\u03c30 M2 almost everywhere outside the event horizon. Having verified all three assumptions, we conclude that the perturbative analysis is valid almost everywhere outside the event horizon.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 5 4\nOpen Access.
