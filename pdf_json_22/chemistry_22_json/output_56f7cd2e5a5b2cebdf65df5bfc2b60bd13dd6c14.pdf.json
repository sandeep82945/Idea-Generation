Introduction The immobilisation approach ensures that the enzyme can be used continuously, making the immobilised enzyme more suited and advantageous than the free-enzyme state. This is due to the ease with which the immobilised enzyme may be regenerated, resulting in a low-cost industrial process. Adsorption (Salah, Srimathi, Gulnara, Ikuo, & Bengt, 2008), crosslinking (Elnashar & Hassan, 2014), entrapment (Betancor, Luckarift, Seo, & Brand, 2008; M. E. Hassan, Tamer, & Omer, 2016), or a combination of these approaches (D'Souza, 1999) are the most often used enzyme immobilization techniques.\nIn the future, according to Street, GI will be the most signi cant industrial enzyme (Street, 1977). For example, GI transforms glucose to fructose, which is utilised as a sucrose alternative in the pharmaceutical industry (Barclay, Ginic-Markovic, Cooper, & Petrovsky, 2012). Because GI has a nancial interest in enzyme immobilisation, a variety of methods are applied, including glutaraldehyde crosslinking (Tyagi, Batra, & Gupta, 1999), entrapment in polyacrylamide (Yuan, Luan, Rana, Hassan, & Dou, 2016), and adsorption on DEAE-Cellulose (Chen & Anderson, 1979). Diethyleaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C) (Gul, Rahman, & Hasnain, 2009) and alginate beads have been used to immobilise the gastrointestinal enzyme (Bao, Ma, & Li, 2011).\n\u03ba-Carrageenan is one of the most common carriers utilised in the entrapment method of immobilising cells and enzymes (Belyaeva, Della, & Poncelet, 2004). Carrageenans are generally utilised for enzyme immobilisation by the creation of non-covalent bonds (entrapment/encapsulation) due to their lack of functions, according to Elnashar et al., 2020. Unfortunately, propagation of the biocatalyst from the carrier is a common feature of enzyme entrapment in a hydrogel, especially for enzymes with molecular weights less than 300 KDa. Many researchers have worked in this eld, and some fascinating results have been obtained (Daniel, Elnashar, & Awad, 2010; Elnashar, Daniel, & Awad, 2009; Yuan et al., 2016).\nCarrageenans have poor thermal stability and mechanical qualities, while being biocompatible and affordable. Some study was done to improve their mechanical and thermal properties, and it was discovered that adding 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose 2-sulphate and gum boosted their mechanical strength\nPage 3/24\n(Wahba & Hassan, 2017). To alleviate the problem of low thermal stability, the carrageenan gel was treated with polyamine compounds to generate a polyelectrolyte complex. -Polyamine groups can improve the heat stability of carrageenan gels (Chao, Haugen, & Royer, 1986). To increase the thermal stability of carrageenan gel, natural polyamine, chitosan, and polyethylenimine were utilised (Elnashar, 2010).\nGI (EC 5.3.1.5) catalyses the reversible isomerization of D-glucose to D-fructose, making it one of the most signi cant enzymes in industry. This conversion is critical, particularly in the production of highfructose corn syrup (HFCS) (Gill, Manhas, & Singh, 2006). Because fructose is sweeter than all other sugars/carbohydrates, there is a nancial incentive to produce it. In addition, because fructose has a higher solubility than sucrose, it is less prone to clump in a variety of foods. Despite the fact that fructose is the sweetest of the naturally occuring caloric sweeteners found in fruits, honey, and some vegetables, it should be ingested in moderation because calories are still present.\nImmobilized GI can thus offer numerous bene ts in biotechnological and industrial applications. Pure fructose (not HFCS), reusability, ease of product separation from the enzyme, and increased enzyme stability at various temperatures and pH levels without affecting enzyme characteristics are just a few of the bene ts. In addition to the kinetic constants of immobilised and free GI, several factors have been investigated. Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy are used to monitor the steps involved in preparing the hydrogels and immobilising the enzyme (SEM).\nThe gastrointestinal enzyme (GI) is a high-cost intracellular enzyme (Tumturk, Altinok, Akosy, & Hasirc, 2008). The catalytic process requires large doses of the enzyme to obtain maximal effectiveness, therefore GI has a high Km value, which makes it more expensive. Furthermore, the free GI's Vmax is relatively low. As a result, it's critical to keep GI immobilised on a cost-effective carrier with a low Km/Vmax ratio. Unfortunately, only a few carriers are regarded cost-effective for industrial usage among the several immobilised GI.\nMany researchers and governments have aimed to immobilise GI onto carrageenan in order to generate high fructose syrup with high yields. Carrageenan, on the other hand, lacks functions for covalent interactions, therefore this was restricted to physical interaction. The rst is to provide additional amine groups to the carrageenan surface, which enable glutaraldehyde reaction while simultaneously functioning as a spacer arm (ligand) to increase the distance between the enzyme and the support, so reducing steric effects and enhancing enzyme immobilisation yield (Bonazza, Manzo, Dos Santos, & Mammarella, 2018). The second is the development of multi-ionic linkages (a network) between the protonated amino groups (cationic polyethylenimine) and the sulphate groups, which hardens the gel beads (anionic carrageenan). This type of ionic network has been shown to be an alternative to covalently crosslinked hydrogels containing sulphate groups in the gel (Elnashar, Yassin, & Kahil, 2008). Given that glutaraldehyde is one of the most widely used activation materials, it is possible to improve enzyme stability by forming a complex with it. Because glutaraldehyde is one of the most widely used activation materials, it can help to improve enzyme stability by forming strong covalent connections\nPage 4/24\nbetween the enzyme and the support, as illustrated in scheme (1). (Barbosa et al., 2014; Elnashar, M., 2010; Elnashar, Mostafa, Morsy, & Awad, 2013; Elnashar M. & Yassin, A.M., 2009). A schematic picture depicts the grafted formulation of the carrageenan beads immobilising GI covalently, and the chemical modi cation is demonstrated using FTIR and SEM techniques (scheme (1)). The enzyme loading capacity, on the other hand, is optimised using a short-chain active ligand (to avoid steric hindrance) and varied enzyme doses. The immobilised and free enzymes' optimal pH and temperature are determined, and the Michaelis constants are investigated using a Hans-Woolf plot. Finally, the immobilized enzyme is checked for its reusability and durability overtime for 15 cycles.\n2. Materials And Methods\n2.1.

Experimental techniques\nPage 5/24\nUnless otherwise mentioned, all tests were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as means SD (n = 3) unless otherwise noted. The Student's t-test was used to establish the signi cance level (p-value) of each concentration effect. 2.2. Methods\n2.2.1. Preparation of \u03ba-carrageenan beads \u03ba- -carrageenan powder (2.5 g) was dissolved in warmed 100 mL distilled water (at 70 oC), yielding 2.5% (w/v) carrageenan gel beads. The Innotech Encapsulator, model IE-50, was used to manufacture uniform gel beads of 300 \u00b5m in size, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01. The gel bead diameter was in the 300 \u00b5m range when using a nozzle. Prior to treatment, the beads were hardened by soaking them in 0.3 M potassium chloride (KCl) for 3 hours. 2.2.2. Activation of gel beads For 3 hours at room temperature, gel beads of \u03ba-carrageenan were immersed in 4% (v/v) Polyethyleneimine (PEI), pH 9.5. Using distilled water, the aminated beads were rinsed to eliminate any unreacted PEI. The GA solution was then used to react with the aminated beads (Carr-PEI) (2.5% for 3 h). The beads were then thoroughly rinsed in distilled water to remove any unreacted GA. Finally, as illustrated in scheme (1), the activated beads were ready for the next phases of immobilisation (Elnashar, 2005). 2.2.3. Enzyme immobilization To determine the highest enzyme immobilisation e ciency, one gramme of treated gel beads was soaked in solutions of GI solutions comprising 97-1455 units (U) for one hour at room temperature. The -C = Nbond was formed by the interaction of the amino group (-NH2) in the enzyme with the free -C = O group on glutaraldehyde (scheme (1)). (Elnashar et al., 2014). 2.2.4. Immobilization E ciency (I.E.) using our locally prepared GI\nOne gramme of gel beads was soaked for one hour at room temperature in 15 mL GI solutions of 97- 1455 U. (RT). From Eq.\u00a01, the immobilisation e ciency (I.E.) was obtained as follows:\n\u00a0I. E. = U / gGelbeads\nGILoadingSolution,U \u2217 100\u00a0 Eq.\u00a01\n2.2.5. Determination of GI activity The GI activity was measured according to Dische and Borenfreund's 1951 publication (Dische & Borenfreund, 1951). A volume of 0.2 mL enzyme solution was added to a substrate solution consisting of\nPage 6/24\n0.5 mL sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M and pH 7.0), 0.2 mL D-glucose (1M), 0.1 mL MgSO4.7H2O (0.1 M), 0.1 mL CoCl2.6H2O (0.01M), and 2 mL dH2O. For 1 hour, the reaction mixture was incubated at 70\u00b0C (Thi Nguyen & Tran, 2018). After stopping the enzymatic reaction with 2 mL of 0.5 M perchloric acid, the product was analysed under assay conditions. The amount of GI enzyme required to produce 1 unit of GI activity was de ned as the amount of GI enzyme needed for the production of 1 \u00b5mol of fructose under assay conditions. 2.2.6. pH pro le The effect of varying pHs on free and immobilised enzyme activity was investigated. Five units of immobilised and free GI were incubated for one hour at 70\u00b0C in a 10 mL 1 M glucose solution at pH 5\u20139. (Torres & Batista-Viera, 2017). The activity at each pH has been given as a percentage of the activity at the optimal pH, which is 100% of the activity. 2.2.7. Temperature pro le The effect of temperature on the catalytic activity of immobilised and free GI was investigated by incubating 5 U of both free and immobilised GI in 10 mL of 1 M glucose solution at pH 7 for 1 hour at various temperatures ranging from 40 to 90oC. (Santos et al., 2015; Seyhan & Dilek, 2008). The ideal temperature was discovered, and enzymatic activity at this temperature is expressed as 100% activity, with activity at other temperatures expressed as a percentage of that activity. 2.2.8. Km and Vmax of immobilized and free GI Km and Vmax were used to determine the a nity of the immobilised and free enzymes for their substrates. 5U of GI was incubated for 1 hour at 70oC and pH 7 in various concentrations of glucose solutions ranging from 200\u20132000 mM. The reaction conditions were inspired by Seyhan ST and Dilek A (2008), who employed glucose concentrations ranging from 100 to 1500 mM (Galv\u00e3o et al., 2008). 2.2.9. Operational stability The operational stability of immobilised GI was studied. The GI was used for 15 cycles of 60 minutes each to convert glucose to fructose, which was created from prepared whey using \u03b2-galactosidase. Onegram beads carrying 8 units of immobilised GI were mixed with 10 mL of \u03b2-galactosidase-pretreated whey. The reaction was kept at 70\u00b0C for 60 minutes. The amount of fructose was evaluated after the immobilised GI was withdrawn from the reaction mixture. The beads were thoroughly rinsed in buffer solution before being placed in a new substrate solution. This method was done numerous times, with the rst activity being 100% and the subsequent activities being expressed as a percentage of the rst. 2.2.10. Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) At room temperature, the infrared spectra of all formulations in scheme (1) were recorded using an FT-IR (Shimadzu FTIR \u2212 8400 S, Japan) from 4000 to 400 cm\u2212 1. FTIR spectra of \u03ba-carrageenan (A), aminated \u03ba-carrageenan (B), activated \u03ba-carrageenan (C), and enzyme immobilised on \u03ba-carrageenan (D) were obtained (D).\nPage 7/24\n2.2.11. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Four separate sets of beads (\u03ba-carrageenan (A), aminated \u03ba-carrageenan (B), activated \u03ba-carrageenan (C), and enzyme immobilised on \u03ba-carrageenan (D)) were produced and activated as described in the preceding section for comparison reasons. After that, the activated gel beads were either lyophilized immediately or soaked for 18 hours in 0.05 M citrate\u2013phosphate buffer. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM; S-590, Hitachi) was used to evaluate the surface morphology of the lyophilized beads in order to investigate the porosity of the gel beads and prove that changes happened on the surface after each reaction.\n3. Results And Discussion The Innotech Encapsulator was utilised to manufacture homogenous gel beads of \u03ba-carrageenan with a size of 300 m, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows that utilising 1445 U enzyme solutions (crude enzyme, molecular weight ranges from 52,000 to 191,000 according to Chen, 1980) with a 6.3 percent immobilisation effectiveness, a maximum enzyme loading capacity of 91.1 U g-1 gel beads was achieved. However, we chose not to utilise the maximum loaded enzyme in future experiments since it had a low I.E., and it would be more cost-effective to use formulations like those that produced 72 U g-1 gel beads with an I.E. of 37.3 percent. This formula does not indicate the greatest I.E., but it does show the most likely economic value.\nTo achieve the maximum enzyme loading capacity, we took into consideration several factors such as the ligand\u2019s chain length (Elnashar, M. M., & Hassan, M. E., 2014), as the long chain ligand would enable multilayer/multipoint attachment of the immobilized enzyme. Such steric hindrance might result in a loss of the enzyme\u2019s activity due to a change in its 3D structure. 3.1. Determination of optimum pH pro le Because the interaction of protein groups with the support is affected by the pH, changing the immobilisation pH can change the orientation of enzyme molecules on the support. The last nucleophile blocking of the support allowed for the elimination of the support's chemical reactivity, preventing unwanted enzyme-support covalent connections and serving as a helpful reaction end point (dos Santos et al., 2015). During its isoelectric point, the enzyme does not work well. Because it denatures near this value, the GI isoelectric point is 3. GI is most stable and crystalline in the pH range of 6 to 8, and denatures fast below pH 5 (Carrell et al., 1989).\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a03, the optimum pHs for the free and immobilized GI were 6.5-7 and 6-7.5, respectively. Statistical analysis (one paired-ample t-test) showed a signi cant differentiation between the mean results of free and immobilized formulae of enzyme, with P*= 0.052 (P \u2264 0.05 is signi cant). The data showed that the immobilization process has increased the enzyme stability (wider pH) compared to the free enzyme. This could be attributed to the xed con guration of the immobilized GI inside or on the surface of the beads, which increases the stability and tolerability of the enzyme towards the surrounding\nPage 8/24\npH (Wang et al., 2007). Our results reveal a better enzyme stability when compared to the results obtained by other authors; for example, Arun and Srevastava (2016) found it at pH 6.5 (Arun & Srivastava, 2016), while Hayrettin et al. (2008) and Kamal et al. (2014) found it at pH 7.5 (Hayrettin, Gokhan, Haydar, Serpil, & Nesrin, 2008; Kamal et al., 2014), and Pawar and Deshmukh found it at pH 7.5 (Pawar & Deshmukh, 1994). 3.2. Determination of optimum temperature pro le The thermal stability of covalently immobilized GI onto chemically activated \u03ba-carrageenan beads is one of the most important application criteria for industrial applications (Manoel, dos Santos, Freire, Rueda, & Fernandez-Lafuente, 2015; Palomo et al., 2002). The optimum temperatures for the free and immobilized enzyme were 70 & 65\u201375 oC respectively, as shown in Fig.\u00a04. Statistical analysis (one paired -sample ttest) showed a signi cant differentiation between the mean results of free and immobilized formulae of enzyme, with P*= 0.0380 (P \u2264 0.05 is signi cant). The results show that the immobilization process made the enzyme more stable at a wider temperature range than it did the free enzyme. Tor et al. (1989) supports this nding, as he suggested that the immobilization process forms a cage surrounding the enzyme. That cage protects/isolates the immobilized enzyme from the bulk temperature and reduces the temperature of the environment surrounding the enzyme (Tor et al., 1989). High temperature is also favored, to avoid microbial contamination. Our results were comparable to those found in literature, where the optimum temperatures for the immobilized enzyme were 70oC (Buchholz, 1992); 60\u00b0C (Fagir & Abu-reesh, 1998; Sorenseon & Emborg, 1989), 65\u00b0C (Kamal et al., 2014) and 75\u00b0C (Pawar & Deshmukh, 1994). The optimum temperature was also found to be 70\u00b0C for the free enzyme, and 85\u00b0C for the immobilized enzyme (Ge et al., 1998). 3.3. Km and Vmax of free and immobilized GI The Km and Vmax of the immobilized and free GI were calculated by using the Hanes-Woolf plot method as in Fig. 5. Table 1 shows the calculated values. The km for the immobilized enzyme was 492 mM which was higher than that of the free one, 29.3 mM. This indicates that the immobilized enzyme needs more substrate concentrations than does the free one (Hassan, Ran, Yuan, Xiaoning, & Duo, 2019). The increase in Km value might be because of diffusional limitations, steric effects and changes in enzyme structure which in uence the ability of the substrate to react with the enzyme active sites (Awad, Abd El Aty, Shehata, Hassan, & Elnashar, 2016). The results of the free Km is in agreement with published data by Tumturk et al. (2008), as he reported that the Km value of free GI was 17.9 mM (Tumturk et al., 2008). The maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) value for the immobilized enzyme, 1117 \u00b5mol min-1, was higher than the Vmax of the free enzyme, 81 \u00b5mol min-1. The increase of the enzyme\u2019s Vmax after immobilization is highly favored in industry, as more products are produced per min compared to the free enzyme. This could be explained as follows: for the enzyme to be e cient, the loss of entropy, coming from the binding between enzyme and substrate to form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, must be paid by the released binding energy from the favoring interaction between substrate and enzyme (Seyhan & Dilek, 2008). Although the Km has increased after the immobilization process, however, the Vmax of the immobilized enzyme has increased too. Using the same amount of free and immobilized enzyme, by\nPage 9/24\ncomparing the ratios of the free enzyme\u2019s Vmax (81 \u00b5mol min-1) to its Km (29.3 mM), with that of the immobilized one (Km: 492 mM and Vmax: 1117 \u00b5mol min-1), the result is 2.76 and 2.27, respectively. The catalytic e ciency (Vmax/Km) of the immobilized enzyme was 82.2% of that of the free one, and this could be attributed to product inhibition or slight enzyme mis-conformation after immobilization (Ahmed, Saleh, Abdel-Hameed, & Fayad, 2019). Overall, the result is positive, as the immobilization process has many bene ts including operational stability that the free enzyme doesn\u2019t afford.\n\u00a0\nTable 1 Kinetic constants of free and immobilized GI.\nGI Form Kinetic Constants\nKm (mM) Vmax (\u00b5mol min-1)\nFree 29.3 81\nImmobilized 492 1117\n3.4. Operational stability The most important elements of the industrial applicability of immobilised enzymes are their reuse, and the simplicity of separation. Immobilized enzymes may be more bene cial than free enzymes if their stability is improved. The immobilised GI was employed 15 times for 60 minutes per cycle, as shown in Fig.\u00a06, and the residual activity was roughly 88 percent of the starting activity (Awad et al., 2016). After being encapsulated in poly (acrylic acid-co-2- acrylamido 2-methyl propane sulfonic acid) P (AA-coAMPS), it preserved 81% of its initial activity after being utilised 15 times (Kamal et al., 2014). When adsorbed on Indion resin, however, it showed inferior stability with repeated use, losing around 40% of its initial activity after ve cycles and 61% after the seventh cycle. 3.5. Elucidation of the modi ed gel beads\n3.5.1. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy\nFigure 7 shows the FT-IR analysis of gel beads at each step of the immobilisation procedure in the range of 400 to 4000 cm-1. Hassan et al., 2019, used the snailase enzyme to create the illustration. The same procedure used to activate k-carrageenan with glutaraldehyde was employed to immobilise GI, as shown in Fig.\u00a07. The activated carrier with free aldehyde groups interacts to the enzyme via its amino groups, which are plentiful in all enzymes, therefore changing the enzyme should not make a difference. The characteristic peaks seen in each formula are depicted in this diagram. The spectra of \u03ba-carrageenan gel beads are shown in curve \"A,\" while curve \"B\" reveals a new broad peak at 3400 cm-1, indicating the\nPage 10/24\nexistence of \u03ba-carrageenan gel beads. This signi es that the amine group is added to the gel beads. The spectra indicate two new peaks after activation with glutaraldehyde, one referring to a free aldehyde end group (C = O) at 1730 cm-1 and the other corresponding to an N = C group that has formed between the amine group on the surface of the beads and the aldehyde group found in glutaraldehyde (curve \"C\"). Curve \"D\" has a larger peak at 3450 cm-1, showing that the enzyme's amine groups generate a rise in amine group concentrations. We can deduct from the foregoing that the entire immobilisation process was successful. This result was in line with prior research ndings (Karam, Hassan, Moharam, & Kansoh, 2018).\n3.5.2. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Figure 8 displays the SEM result for \u03ba-carrageenan, aminated \u03ba-carrageenan, activated \u03ba-carrageenan and immobilized GI onto activated \u03ba-carrageenan (Fig.\u00a08A-8D, respectively). The Figures show the changes that happened on the surface in each step after each treatment. For example, in Fig.\u00a08A (untreated carrageenan), the surface is rough (Whaba, Marwa & Soliman, Tarek, 2018). In Fig.\u00a08B, there is the appearance of many small beads which are attributed to the amination of carrageenan with PEI. In Fig.\u00a08C, the surface is starting to get smoother with a few pebble-structures on its surface which are attributed to the formation of the C = N and free aldehyde end groups (C = O) on its surface as proven in FTIR (Fig.\u00a07). Finally, in Fig.\u00a08D, the surface is getting almost smoother. And that could be attributed to the immobilization of GI on its surface. From the Figures, we can also see the difference in pore size after each step, and this is consistent with other researchers\u2019 ndings.\n4. Conclusions To create fructose from glucose, the GI enzyme was covalently attached onto -carrageenan gel beads. The pharmaceutical and food industries bene t greatly from the industrial production of fructose because fructose serves as a cryprotectant, which is used to make medicines more pleasant, and promotes hydrophobic active-ingredient solubility. The optimum pH and temperature of the immobilised GI have been shifted to a wider range than the free one, according to the results. This improves the enzyme's stability and tolerance to changes in pH and temperature, as well as preventing microbial contamination. Furthermore, after 15 reuses (each cycle lasting 60 minutes), immobilised GI retains 88% of its action, which is bene cial on an industrial level. These ndings support the economic and biotechnological advantages of using GI immobilisation to manufacture pure fructose rather than HFCS (which contains glucose). As a result, the ndings of this study are regarded as a good model for producing pure fructose from natural and cost-effective sources. The authors suggest that this method be scaled up on a semi-pilot size in the future. This is not a simple process because it will require the use of a bioreactor and changes to the reaction conditions, such as quantity, thermodynamics, and heat transport. As a result, including a chemical engineer is highly suggested.\nDeclarations\nPage 11/24\nCon icts of interest\nThere is no con ict of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Research Centre, Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products department and the Center of Excellence for Advanced Sciences.
