            "text": "Given the hot, dense accretion flow in a post-merger black hole-accretion disk remnants, energy can be channeled into ultra-relativistic outflow needed to explain GRB properties, Nakar (2007); Berger (2014). In such systems, the accretion gas cools by neutrino emission continuously, Popham et al. (1999); Di Matteo et al. (2002); Janiuk et al. (2004). On the other hand, magnetic fields can also extract energy from the disk and black hole spin, by generating the magnetic driven winds and Poynting flux-dominated jets, Blandford & Znajek (1977). Moreover, it can support the heating process of the plasma through the viscous effects of the MRI, Balbus & Hawley (1991). The dynamical ejecta outflows during the merger, and the post-merger outflows are considered as possible sources explaining the observation of kilonova and other electromagnetic (EM) counterparts following the gravitational wave detections, Metzger & Berger (2012); Dietrich & Ujevic (2017). In this series of studies, we utilize the numerical simulations to investigate the evolution and different properties of the disk and the outflows in the presence of magnetic fields and neutrino cooling."

For the magnetized case, the initial magnetic field is confined within the torus by poloidal loops with the ratio of the maximum gas pressure to the maximum magnetic pressure \u03b2 = Pgas,max/PB,max = 50.\nThe equation of state is a realistic nuclear matter composed of free protons, neutrons, electron\u2013positron pairs, and helium nuclei, Reddy et al. (1998), considering weak interactions to determine neutrino opacities in hot dense matter. For neutrino treatment we use the formalism from Janiuk et al.

            "text": "The results of the magnetized simulation are presented in Figs. 1-4 at t = 0.03s time snapshot. The 2D profiles show that disk becomes turbulent and expands from the outer boundary. There is a significant accretion happening as a result of MRI, and the disk is quite transparent for neutrino emissions. The funnel shape jet structure with high magnetic field is formed at the early time of the evolution. Measuring the volume density-averaged electron fraction shows that the disk becomes less neutronrich and less degenerate at the end of the simulation.\nThe comparison between the magnetized and non-magnetized cases are given in Figs. 5 and 6. As one expects, MRI provides the required mechanism for the angular momentum transport and matter accreting into the black hole. On the other hand, we observe that the neutrino luminosity increases by factor of four for the magnetized case during the evolution. This can be explained as a thermal competition between magnetic-driven viscous heating effect and the neutrino and advection cooling effects, which shifts the equilibrium condition for the weak interactions and generates more neutrinos.\nFor the magnetized case, we mark the fluid with positive energy \u2212hut > 1 as unbound matter (here h is the enthalpy and ut is the t component of the 4-velocity). Taking summation over density of the unbound matter for the entire grid, we plot the histograms to measure the total mass over the electron fraction Ye, temperature and velocity bins. These analysis are done at two time intervals, by taking the average over several snapshots from the first half of the evolution, and the same for the second half. These histograms and the mass of the unbound matter verses time are illustrated in Figs. 7-10. Overall, the outflows become colder with lower kinetic energy at the end of the simulation. This observation can be explained by\n52 ? PTA Proceedings ?March 10, 2022 ? vol. 123 pta.edu.pl/proc/2022mar10/123\nthe fact that the magnetic field dissipates over time in a two dimensional evolution as a result of the anti-dynamo effect. Hence, the generation of the magnetic-driven winds slows down by further evolution."

            "text": "We evolved two analytical disk-black hole models with and without magnetic field. We observe the creation of the jets and turbulent plasma as a result of BZ mechanism and MRI. The neutrino cooling has a significant effect on the energy budget of the disk and its thermal and composition evolution. Measuring the unbounded mass, and its features such as temperature, velocity and composition, shows that our model does not produce enough energetic outflows (yet) to compete with the dynamical ejecta to explain the source of the EM counterparts (see Dietrich & Ujevic (2017) for the outflow estimates for black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star merger simulations). We plan to perform more simulations with different setup such as different spin and different mass ratios for disks and black holes to investigate their effects on the outflows. 3D simulations and more accurate approximation for neutrino treatment such as neutrino leakage scheme are required for future studies to estimate the outflows\u2019 properties more precisely.\nAcknowledgements.
