Based on the provided text, the following sentences/portion of text mention future research directions:

1. "But the problem of common method bias may still exist; therefore, future research should conduct a longitudinal study comprised of both quantitative and qualitative data, and multi-methods for the causality and outcome of organisational teams during a different period of team life in order to examine the different emergent facets in teams, such as internal team environment, humility and shared leadership."

2. "Moreover, this research was conducted in Hong Kong, China. The data source might induce generalisation concerns. Most of the informants were Chinese in one of the universities in Hong Kong. The core cultural value and views on humility and team environment might be different from Western cultures. The results might be implicated if this research is conducted in another part of the world due to cultural difference."

3. "Last but not least, trust is another complicated factor in the social process, which has also been excluded from this research. Various research has shown an influential effect of trust on the outcome (e.g. Paul et al., 2016). Fellow members trust each other have a positive effect on performance. They are knowledgeable about each other and sense other members can trust in the virtual team. Trust facilitates information sharing between members and dedication to the common goal. Consequently, members trusting each other in the virtual team perform better than those with low trust between each other (Capiola, Alarcon, Lyons, Ryan & Schneider, 2019)."
