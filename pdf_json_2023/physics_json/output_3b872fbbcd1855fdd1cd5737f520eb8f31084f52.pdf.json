    "abstractText": "The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) located downstream of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction cascade, is involved in the regulation of a large variety of cellular processes. The ERK2, activated by phosphorylation, is the principal effector of a central signaling cascade that converts extracellular stimuli into cells. Deregulation of the ERK2 signaling pathway is related to many human diseases, including cancer. This study reports a comprehensive biophysical analysis of structural, function, and stability data of pure, recombinant human non-phosphorylated (NP-) and phosphorylated (P-) ERK2 wild-type and missense variants in the common docking site (CD-site) found in cancer tissues. Because the CD-site is involved in interaction with protein substrates and regulators, a biophysical characterization of missense variants adds information about the impact of point mutations on the ERK2 structure\u2013function relationship. Most of the P-ERK2 variants in the CD-site display a reduced catalytic efficiency, and for the P-ERK2 D321E, D321N, D321V and E322K, changes in thermodynamic stability are observed. The thermal stability of NP-ERK2 and P-ERK2 D321E, D321G, and E322K is decreased with respect to the wild-type. In general, a single residue mutation in the CD-site may lead to structural local changes that reflects in alterations in the global ERK2 stability and catalysis.",

The activation loop, in the C-terminal lobe, is important for substrate binding and catalysis (Figure 2). The conformational changes that acc mpany ERK1/2 phosphorylation i volve the entir protein dynamics and are essential for the proper alignment of substrates and scaffolds [13,14].

(B) Human ERK2 structure in complex with an inhibitor (pdb: 4zzn) [12]. Thr185 and Tyr187 residues, involved in the activation of ERK2, are evidenced in sticks; the inhibitor is not shown. The ERK2 mediates key events throughout the cell by phosphorylation of transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, and other protein kinases and enzymes [18,19], thus alteration of the ERK2 activity may perturb cellular homeostasis and lead to the deregulation of cellular functions. Because of its important role in signal transduction, the ERK2 is related to a variety of diseases, including cancer [20].\nThe ERK2 is a key regulator of the ERK pathway by recruiting interaction partners and substrates that can be either substrates or regulators through two docking sites: a conserved common docking site (CD-site), and an F-recruitment site (F-site). The CD-site is located at the opposite site of the catalytic cleft and interacts with the D-docking domain of the substrate (D-site). The F-site is in the proximity of the catalytic cleft and of the activation-loop; it is fully formed upon ERK2 activation and interacts with the F-docking domain of substrates [21,22]. The ERK2 CD-site is composed of a negatively charged component and of a hydrophobic component [21]. The negatively charged ERK2 component contains two aspartate residues (D318 and D321), essential for interaction with the positively charged basic residues of the substrate D-site [23] (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

The negatively charged ERK2 component contains two aspartate residues (D318 and D321), essential for interaction with the positively charged basic residues of the substrate D-site [23] (Figure 2).\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 4 of 21\nSeveral somatic ERK2 variants, identified in tumors, are reported in the COSMIC database [24]. Since the ERK2 plays a pivotal role in the control of different cellular processes, such as proliferation and survival, its variants may cause dysregulated cell proliferation that may induce disease, such as cancer [6,25]. One of the two positions of the ERK2 CD-site most frequently affected by mutations is D321 (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure 2). This residue has been observed mutated to A, E, G, N, and V in different cancers. The substitution of D321 with N321 disrupts the binding between the ERK2 and phosphatase, thus preventing its inactivation [26]. In addition, a mutagenesis analysis revealed that substitutions of the D321 with the conservative E321 and the non-conservative A321 also rendered a modest gain of function-like phenotype [27]. Interestingly, D321E and D321A showed an increase in their phospho-active content and were also more sensitive to activation than the ERK2 wild-type [27]. Indeed, the mutations in the CD-site observed in cancer tissues are extremely interesting, first because they are present in a negatively charged ERK2 hotspot involved in binding with substrates and regulators. In addition, the substitution of a polar and negatively charged residue (D321)\u2014with a residue ranging from a non-polar (A, V) to a neutral (N) or to a longer, negatively charged one (E)\u2014may give the opportunity to study the role of a point mutation on ERK2 conformation in solution and stability. Interestingly, D321 is exposed to the solvent forming a salt bridge with R135, and it is closely clustered with the negative E322, which is involved in a network of interactions inside the protein [22,26]. The ERK2 E322 is another mutation hotspot and is frequently mutated to K (Supplementary Table S1). E322K represents the most frequent mutation in some cancer types [26], and increasing tumor resistance to inhibitors has been observed for this variant [28]. In a comprehensive functional study on the ERK2 missense variants, mutations in D321 and E322 belong to those ERK2 cancer-associated variants identified as gain and loss of function in cancer cells [29]. The mutations D321N and E322K change the charge in the ERK2 CD-site, may affect the ERK2 thermal stability, and may cause the evasion of dephosphorylation by dualspecificity phosphatases that leads to an increase in ERK2 activity in cells [26]. However, little is known about the consequences on the thermodynamic stability associated with the substitution of D321 and E322 in human ERK2. In the present work, we address the impact of six non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (Supplementary Table S1) in the ERK2 CD-site on a protein structure in solution, stability, and catalytic activity. Because the activation of ERK2 by phosphorylation of T185 and Y187 induces conformational changes, we analyzed the effects of the missense mutations on the unphosphorylated (NP-ERK2) and on the phosphorylated-ERK2 (P-ERK2), obtained as pure recombinant proteins. Furthermore, we investigated the binding of CD-site mutants with inhibitors, and with peptides with kinase and phosphatase activity, respectively. The design of new therapeutic strategies for personalized medicine requires the comprehension, from a molecular point of view, of the effect of the changes caused by single nucleotide variations on protein structure, function, stability, and interactions."

We used a fluorescence-based assay for rapid and sensitive detection of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activities, also known as the Chelation-Enhanced Fluorescence (ChEF) method. This method takes advantage of a synthetic \u03b1-amino acid with a side chain bearing an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative (sulfonamido-oxine, Sox), which, upon coordination to Mg2+, gives information on the phosphorylation state of the proximal serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in peptide- and protein-based kinase substrates.

The two hotspot variants, D321N and E322K\u2014found with a higher frequency in cancer tissues\u2014caused an increase in ERK2 cellular activity and evaded inactivation by dephosphorylation [26].

Interestingly, the substitution of D321 with the small and more flexible glycine perturbs the network of ionic interactions between D321 and R135 and may alter the ERK2 tertiary arrangement. The near-UV CD spectra of most P-ERK2 variants (Figure 4B) were comparable, but not identical, with that of the P-ERK2 wild-type, with two notable exceptions: P-ERK2 D321G, which showed a near-UV CD spectrum like that of NP-ERK2 D321G; and P-ERK2 E322K, whose near-UV CD spectrum did not show a well-defined contribution in the 260\u2013275 nm region. Amongst the other P-ERK2 mutants, only the P-D321V spectrum in the near-UV CD region was like that of the P-ERK2 wild-type.

These results, taken together, indicate that, upon phosphorylation, changes occur in the tertiary arrangements of the proteins and that the residues in the CD-site may be involved in these interactions.\nThe fluorescence spectra of the P-ERK2 D321E variant was centered at 343 nm, and it was significantly different from that of the wild-type (Figure 4D), suggesting changes in the tryptophan environment. For the NP-ERK2 variants, only D321N showed a slight increase in the relative fluorescence intensity (Figure 4C); no significant differences were detected for all the other variants.\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 12 of 21\nThe analysis of far-UV CD spectra revealed that the secondary structure of the NPERK2 variants was similar to that of the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S2A), hence the effect of the single amino acid substitution was mainly localized to the structural environment of the mutated residue. The exception was the NP-ERK2 D321G, which showed a difference in the intensity and in the minima around 208 and 222 nm, in comparison with that of the wild-type, supporting the observation that aspartate-to-glycine substitution at residue 321 significantly affects the ERK2 native structure. The far-UV CD spectra of the P-ERK2 wild-type and variants were similar, with a divergence in the intensities of the signals, suggesting a different secondary structure rearrangement of the mutants upon phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S2B). Far-UV CD is an excellent method to study the impact of the point mutation on the secondary structure, and the ratio between molar ellipticity at 222 and at 208 nm ([\u0398]222/[\u0398]208) is very sensitive to structural changes. This parameter, useful to distinguish between coiled coil helices (>1.0) and non-interacting helices (0.8\u20130.9), may give information about interhelical contacts present in a helix bundle and coiled coil structures [43]. The [\u0398]222/[\u0398]208 for the wild-type is 0.8 and ranges from 0.76 for NP-D321N to 0.98 for NPD321G. This variation suggests that the single amino acid substitutions in the CD-site can alter interhelical interactions in the solution (Supplementary Table S2). A missense mutation may lead to significant structural alterations that may change the stability of the protein and impair the protein function [44,45]. To provide insights into the effect of missense mutations on protein stability, we analyzed the thermal stability of the NP-ERK2 and P-ERK2 wild-types and variants by continuously monitoring the changes of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm in the temperature range between 20 \u25e6C and 90 \u25e6C (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3). The irreversible thermal denaturation occurred in a transition apparently cooperative. The melting temperature (Tm), corresponding to the midpoint of the denaturation process, was calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature. The thermal transition of the NP-ERK2 wild-type (Tm = 55.0 \u25e6C) was less cooperative than that of the P-ERK2 (Tm = 56.0 \u25e6C) (Figure 5).\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 12 of 21 fluorescence emission spectra of the NP-ERK2, continuous line (C), and of the P-ERK2 variants, dashed lines (D), were recorded at 130 \u00b5g/mL (0.08 AU 280 nm, 295 nm excitation wavelength), in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.2 mM DTT.\nThe fluorescence spectra of the P-ERK2 D321E variant was centered at 343 nm, and it was significantly different from that of the wild-type (Figure 4D), suggesting changes in the tryptophan environment.

This variation suggests that the single amino acid substitutions in the CD-site can alter interhelical interactions in the solution (Supplementary Table S2). A missense mutation may lead to significant structural alterations that may change the stability of the protein and impair the protein function [44,45]. To provide insights into the effect of missense mutations on protein stability, we analyzed the thermal stability of the NP-ERK2 and P-ERK2 wild-types and variants by continuously monitoring the changes of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm in the temperature range between 20 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3). The irreversible thermal denaturation occurred in a transitio apparently cooperative. The melting t mperature (Tm), corresponding to the midpoint of the denaturati n process, was calculat d by plotting the fi st derivative of the molar ellipticity v lues as a function of temperature. The thermal transition of the NP-ERK2 wild-type (Tm = 55.0 \u00b0C) was less c operative th n that of the P-ERK2 (Tm = 56.0 \u00b0C) (Figure 5).\nIn general, upon phosphorylation, the melting temperature increases for the P-wildtype, P-D321A, P-D321E and P-D321G, and decreases for P-D321N, P-D321V, and P-E322K (Table 1).\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 13 of 21\nTm values were obtained from the first derivative of the ellipticity at 222 nm at an increasing temperature.\nTm values were increased for the NP- and P-D321N (Table 1), whose Tm values were 4 and 2 degrees higher than that of the wild-type, respectively. For the NP-ERK2 D321V, the Tm value is 2 degrees higher than the NP-ERK2 wild-type, and in the case of the P-ERK2 D321V, the Tm value was about 3 degrees lower than that of the NP-ERK2 D321V, and slightly lower than the Tm of the P-ERK2 wild-type. The Tm values of the NP-ERK2 and P-ERK2 D321E, D321G, and E322K variants were lower than those of the wild-type: Tm values of the NP-E322K and P-E322K were 4 degrees and 6 degrees lower than that of the NP-ERK2 and P-ERK2 wild-type, respectively (Table 1). These results indicated that the negatively charged residues in the CD-site were involved in the stability of the native state and that a charge inversion in E322 may result in a dramatic thermal stability loss. Notably, E322 points to the internal region of the protein where it is involved in buried ionic interactions that may be disrupted by the substitution of the negatively charged glutamate with the positive lysine. Additionally, the residue D321, involved in a network of ionic interactions with R135, is critical for ERK2 stability since a substitution of the negatively charged aspartate with a positively charged residue\u2014as in D321N\u2014or with a neutral\u2014as in D321A and D321V\u2014or with the longer glutamate\u2014as in D321E\u2014affect the protein thermal stability. In D321G, the presence of a neutral, small, and flexible glycine that significantly alters the protein tertiary arrangement (Figure 4) brings about a decrease in its thermal stability (Table 1). The impact of mutation on the negatively charged residues in the CD-site, D321 and E322, on the ERK2 thermal stability was also observed in rat ERK2 variants, D321N and E322K, and points to the significant role of the CD-site as an energetic hot spot in this protein [26]. The thermodynamic stability of the ERK2 wild-type and mutants was analyzed at 10\u25e6 C using GdmCl as a denaturant, by monitoring, in parallel, the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence and in the molar ellipticity at 222 nm. The changes in the intrinsic fluorescence upon increasing [GdmCl] were measured by calculating \u03bb, the intensity averaged emission wavelength (Equation (2)). The Supplementary Table S3 reports the thermodynamic parameters resulting from the analysis of the changes in the far-UV CD and in the intrinsic fluorescence caused by the increasing GdmCl concentration. The GdmCl induced unfolding transitions monitored by far-UV CD changes are coincident for most of the variants with those obtained from changes in intrinsic fluorescence. For some variants, the unfolding transition monitored by far-UV CD and/or by fluorescence was analyzed using a three-state model since an intermediate was detected at a low denaturant concentration (Supplementary Table S3). Notably, all the variants showed conformational stability that, in general, were very similar to that of the wild-type, with some notable differences as in the case of D321E, D321N, D321V, and E322K. In these variants, important changes occur upon phosphorylation in the thermodynamic parameters and a denaturation intermediate becomes populated. The presence of a denaturation intermediate could be regarded as a stabilization of the native state, because of the increased difference in the unfolding free energy between the native and the unfolded state. The general consideration about these results is that a single residue mutation in the CD-site reflects in important alterations in the\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 14 of 21\nglobal ERK2 thermodynamic stability. In the case of D321G, the denaturation intermediate is populated in the unphosphorylated form, and the stability of the phosphorylated form is comparable to that of the wild-type. The effect of missense mutations on the kinetic properties of ERK2 was investigated by monitoring over time the increase in the fluorescence intensity induced by the incorporation of phosphate into a peptide substrate (PhosphoSensR Peptide AQT0490). The activity assay was performed at 30 \u25e6C at a fixed MgCl2 concentration. Most of the P-ERK2 variants in the CD-site displayed a reduced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM), analyzed using AQT0490 over the concentration range of 0.069 \u00b5M to 40 \u00b5M (Table 2). P-D321E and P-D321A displayed a 19- and 3-fold increase in the specific activity, respectively, not paralleled by a similar increase in their catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM), that is, a 1.5\u2013fold decrease for P-D321A and only a 3.8-fold increase for P-D321E (Table 2). This result\u2014that originates from the increase in KM values of about four-fold (Table 2) for both the variants\u2014suggests a decrease in substrate binding. A significant decrease in the specific activity was observed for the variant P-D321G, as indicated by the low kcat/KM value and specific activity (Table 2). Notably, the tertiary arrangement of this variant is significantly altered (Figure 4) as a result of the substitution of D321 with the small and more flexible glycine that may perturb the network of ionic interactions between D321 and R135.\nThe catalytic activity of the P-ERK2 was assayed at 30 \u25e6C, with the substrate peptide AQT0490 (0.1 \u00b5M for P-D321G, and 0.5 \u00b5M for wild-type and for the other variants) in the presence of 5 mM MgATP (see Materials and Methods). The final enzyme concentration in the activity assay was 0.5 nM for P-D321E, 5 nM for wild-type, P-D321N, P-D321V and P-E322K, 10 nM for P-D321A, and 2000 nM for P-D321G. The ERK2 activity kinetic parameters were measured at 30 \u25e6C with at least 10 different AQT0490 concentrations. Data are the mean \u00b1 SE of the fit.\nThe P-ERK2 variants in the CD-site displayed an optimal temperature for catalysis (Tmax), higher than that of the wild-type, except for the variant P-D321V that showed a Tmax at 25 \u25e6C, suggesting that in physiological conditions, this variant may be completely inactive (Table 3 and Supplementary Figure S4). Notably, the variant with the highest specific activity, P-D321E, showed the lowest Ea value (5.24 kcal/mol) (Table 3), comparable to the activation energy value of P-D321N. The Ea values of all the other mutants are similar to that of the wild-type. The ERK2 CD-site is in a region where the major changes between inactive (NP-ERK2) and active (P-ERK2) proteins are observed. In fact, when the CD-site binds to the activating and deactivating enzymes, solvent exposure of the activation loop occurs, thus suggesting a relation between the activation loop and the CD-site [46].\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 15 of 21\nEa was determined in the temperature range between 10 \u25e6C and the optimal temperature (Equation (1)). Data are the mean \u00b1 SE of the fit.\nTo correlate structural and stability studies, we focused on the effects of the variants in the binding with inhibitors, in particular the inhibitors that occupy part of the adenine binding pocket and form hydrogen bonds with the hinge region of the enzyme, known as type I inhibitors of ERK2 (Supplementary Table S4) [47\u201354]. The binding to the inhibitors was studied by Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) measurements that revealed, for all the variants, Tm values like that of the wild-type, with a small difference of 2\u20134 \u25e6C (Supplementary Table S5), suggesting that the missense mutations do not affect the binding to ERK2 inhibitors. The hotspot mutation E322K is associated to an apparent increase in tumor resistance to inhibitors [26,30]. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay was performed to quantify the effect of this mutation on the binding with a specific inhibitor, GDC-0994 [52]. ITC is a convenient and widely used approach to directly measure the amount of heat released or absorbed during association processes of biomolecules in solutions and to quantitatively estimate the interaction affinity between protein and its ligands. Titration of the ERK2 wild-type with the inhibitor GDC-0994 showed an affinity (KD) of about 3.8 nM\u2014in the same order of magnitude of that of the variant E322K (KD = 7.9 nM). Thermodynamic measurements provide insight into the nature of the noncovalent forces responsible for binding; polar interactions tend to contribute favorably to the enthalpic component, whereas entropically favored interactions are often hydrophobic and are dominated by dehydration. The binding of the ERK2 wild-type and the inhibitor GDC-0994 revealed an enthalpydriven interaction, driven by favorable polar interactions such as hydrogen-bonding. On the other hand, the interaction of ERK2 E322K and the inhibitor GDC-0994 displayed an entropy-driven interaction, mainly characterized by contribution of hydrophobic effects to binding. To better understand the effect of the D321N mutation on the interaction with the protein kinase MEK2 and the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP6), we performed ITC titrations with the peptides PepMEK2 and the Kinase Interaction Motif (KIM) of DUSP6. PepMEK2 is a MAP Kinase ERK2 substrate docking peptide derived from MLARRKPVLPALTINP of the upstream activating kinase MEK2. The binding with the pepMEK2 of the ERK2 wild-type was analyzed and compared with that of the variant D321N. ITC data revealed an enthalpy-driven interaction of the NP-ERK2 wild-type with pepMEK2, with a KD value of 23.7 \u00b5M. The titration profile of the pepMEK2 with the NP-ERK2 D321N displayed an entropy-driven interaction with a KD value of 11.6 \u00b5M. These results indicate that the amino acid substitution in D321N perturbs the docking interaction in the CD-site. The D321N variant shows an increased cellular activity in cells and evades inactivation catalyzed by phosphatases, such as DUSP6 [26]. DUSP6 plays a crucial tumor-suppressive role via pivotal negative-feedback regulation of the ERK2 in the MAPK signaling pathway [55,56]. The KIM peptide GIMLRRLQKGNLPVRAL of DUSP6 directly binds to the ERK2 CD-site. The ITC titration between the P-ERK2 wild-type and the KIM peptide DUSP6 showed a KD of 14.4 \u00b5M (Figure 6).

The measurements were performed using an \u201cAffinity ITC\u201d (TA-Instrument) with 500\u00b5M of peptide (KIM of DUSP6) in the syringe, and 93 \u00b5M of the P-ERK2 wild-type and 113 \u00b5M of the P-ERK2 D321N in the cell at 30 \u00b0C.

Surprisingly, the activation segment was partially disordered, possibly caused by inhibitor binding. Apart from this difference, the structure was highly conserved compared with the wild-type ERK2 (Figure 8). Unanticipated was also the presence of the inhibitor that interacted not only with the ERK2 binding pocket for ATP, but also bound to the crystal interface (Figure 8). As this binding site is formed by crystal contacts, it is likely an artefact of protein crystallization. The studies on purified ERK2 variants may contribute to understand the effect of missense mutations on protein function and structure [57]. The results drive to conclude that the effect of mutations in the CD-site is limited to local changes of tertiary structure, whereas the global fold of the ERK2 is not drastically affected, as well as the binding of inhibitors. Indeed, the local changes strongly reflect on the global properties of the ERK2 as the thermodynamic parameters or the activation energy values. Notably, the conformational stability of all the variants was comparable, but not identical, to that of the wild-type, indicating that a single residue mutation in the energetic hotspot of the CD-site brings about changes that globally reflect on the ERK2 stability. The changes in the enzyme\nCancers 2023, 15, 2938 17 of 21\nactivity observed for some of the ERK2 variants suggest a long-distance effect at the active site produced by the mutation in the CD-site that is located far away from the catalytic site. Mutations in the ERK2 CD-site residues, a region where the major changes between inactive (NP-ERK2) and active (P-ERK2) proteins are observed, may affect the transition between active and inactive conformations, as suggested by the absence of binding interaction of the P-ERK2 D321N with the KIM peptide of DUSP6.

            "text": "The missense variants in the ERK2 common docking site (CD-site), a region involved in interactions with substrates and regulators, are considered statistically significant in cancer. Biophysical studies on these variants present in cancer tissues indicate that the ERK2 CD-site, that is far away from the catalytic site, plays a significant role in the energetics of the protein. In this site, the major changes between inactive (NP-ERK2) and active (P-ERK2) proteins are observed, thus amino acid substitutions in this region may affect the transition between the active and the inactive conformation and alter binding interactions with regulators, such as phosphatase DUSP6. The lack of control of the ERK2 activity by DUSP6 may keep the ERK2 signaling active, thus favoring oncogenic transformation. A single residue mutation in the CD-site brings about local changes that strongly reflect on the global properties of the ERK2, as the thermodynamic parameters or the activation energy values significantly changed in some of the mutants. The negatively charged residues in the CD-site are involved in the stabilization of the native state and a charge inversion or neutralization of residues D321 or E322 may result in a significant change in the ERK2 biophysical and biochemical properties. The differences observed in the catalytic parameters, as the reduced catalytic efficiency, may result from a different response to the control mechanism that regulates the transition from active- to inactive-conformation of the overall protein structure.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cancers15112938/s1, Figure S1: western blot analysis; Figure S2: FAR-UV CD spectra of ERK2 wild-type and variants; Figure S3: Thermal unfolding of non-phosphorylatedERK2 (NP-ERK2) and phosphorylated ERK2 (P-ERK2) wild-type and variants in the CD-site; Figure S4: Effect of temperature on phosphorylated ERK2 (P-ERK2) activity wild-type and variants; Table S1: List and details of the analyzed ERK2 variants selected from COSMIC database; Table S2: Molar ellipticity ratio of non-phosphorylated-ERK2 (NP-ERK2) and phosphorylated ERK2 (P-ERK2) wild type and variants; Table S3: Thermodynamic parameters for GdmCl-induced unfolding equilibrium of nonphosphorylated-ERK2 (NP-ERK2) and phosphorylated ERK2 (P-ERK2) wild-type and variants measured by far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy; Table S4: Selected inhibitors of ERK2; Table S5: Effect of the binding with inhibitors on melting temperature of ERK2 wild-type and variants.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.C., V.C. and A.P.; methodology, all authors; validation, all authors; formal analysis, R.C., V.C., L.N. and M.P.; investigation, A.P., L.N., M.P. and A.C.; resources, R.C., V.C. and S.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.N. and M.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.C., V.C. and S.K.; visualization, R.C., V.C. and L.N.; supervision, R.C. and V.C.; project administration, R.C. and V.C.; funding acquisition, R.C.
