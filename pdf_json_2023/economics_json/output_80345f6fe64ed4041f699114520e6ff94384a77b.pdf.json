            "text": "Page 2/10\n1 Introduction Homicide rates have increased 35% since before the COVID-19 pandemic, posing an elevated and persistent public health crisis [1]. Four of every 5 homicides involve guns [1], and the United States\u2019 problem is the worst among high-income countries [2]. On average, for each gun homicide, 2 more individuals are shot and injured, with the highest rates being among young men of color living in the poorest urban communities [3, 4]. On top of this, violence follows seasonal patterns, routinely peaking in the summer months [5].\nAwareness of worsening gun violence and its impacts also brings attention to programs intended to prevent deaths, injuries, and trauma. When taking into account the value of lives lost, each gun homicide costs the United States $6\u00a0million to $15.6\u00a0million [6, 7, 8, 9]. Taxpayers and state and local governments pay millions each year in medical costs for those injured in assaults, and billions for police response and investigation, courts, and incarceration for violent crime [6, 9]. The American Rescue Plan included $130\u00a0billion in funding for local governments to counter the economic toll of COVID-19, including support for nonpro ts and essential workers who work to prevent gun violence, which notably increased during this period [10]. One such intervention is summer youth employment programs (SYEPs).\n1.1 Summer Youth Employment Programs SYEPs match young people with employment training and paid work opportunities during the months when schools are closed and youth unemployment is typically highest. Many are tailored toward 14- to 24-year-olds, at least a portion of whom face upward mobility-barriers, such as living in low-income households, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, being involved in foster care or the justice system, or being pregnant or a parent [11]. Job placements can span from working in private-sector retail or tech, to a city agency or nonpro t organization\u2019s summer camp, pool, or park. While a survey of participants in a Michigan SYEP found that 1 in 2 youth had been employed the summer prior to participating, the jobs offered through the SYEP were more likely to be considered advanced-level or professional, which contributed to the youth\u2019s con dence and development [12].\nBeyond providing work experience and income, SYEPs also ll a gap during summer months when many young people lack connections, structure, and engagement. The bene ts of SYEPs include career and college readiness, workforce development [13], nancial opportunities and literacy [14, 15] improved educational outcomes [16], and violent crime prevention [15, 17, 18, 19]. The US federal government has made resources available to support SYEPs since at least 1982, originally through its Job Training and Partnership Act and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, along with several other funding streams [20, 21, 22]. A recent survey of 53 mayors found that all but one were implementing an SYEP in their city [23]. 1.2 Evidence of Violence Prevention Impacts This cost analysis focuses on SYEPs with the explicit goal of reducing violent crime. This speci c goal drives decisions with regard to program design, target participants, and budgeting. Evidence shows that, when implemented intentionally, SYEPs can be effective at reducing violence. A 2019 randomized controlled trial of Boston\u2019s SYEP found that relative to a control group, participants\u2019 violent crime arraignments were 35% lower 17 months following program completion [19]. Another randomized controlled trial of Chicago\u2019s SYEP found that, compared to a control group, participants\u2019 violent crime arrests decreased by 43% 16 months following program completion [17]. Evaluations of New York City\u2019s SYEP found that participation reduced the probability of a felony arrest during the summer by 23% and the probabilities of incarceration and mortality at least four years post-program completion by 10% and 20%, respectively [16, 18]. Another evaluation of Cleveland\u2019s SYEP found a 29% reduction in juvenile lings for drug crimes and a 66% reduction in incarceration one year following program completion compared to youth who did not participate [24]. These studies demonstrate that SYEPs can effectively reduce violence, crime, and justice system involvement among participating youth.\nMultiple connections between SYEP participation and violence reduction have been identi ed. SYEPs may discourage youth from engaging in criminal behaviors by changing their daily activities and increasing their sense of agency, identity, and competency. They also provide safe spaces and counteract the structural racism that often denies young people of color pathways to meaningful employment [25]. Compared to other youth jobs, the employment opportunities provided by SYEPs are more likely to be in the public sector, exposing youth to service, civic engagement, and a sense of contributing to the community [12, 20]. Notably, SYEPs are effective at different levels of intervention (both pre- and post-violence or justice system involvement), though violence prevention bene ts are strongest in youth who have already been involved with the justice system [18]. Overall, SYEPs are a positive approach to violence prevention, offering \u201cimportant opportunities for youth to move from \u2018disconnection\u2019 to a positive educational and employment trajectory\u201d [11]. 1.3 Study Objective Cities have several decisions to make when implementing SYEPs, including the length and intensity of workforce training or experience, who is eligible, if and how to target those most at risk of violence, which organizations and work sites to engage with, and more. For many of these decisions, however, funding is a\nPage 3/10\nlimiting factor. Knowing the cost components of program design and implementation can assist organizations in identifying a feasible mix of services and number of youth served to maximize e ciency, quality, and welfare [26, 27].\nThis violence prevention-focused SYEP cost case study will inform future cost-bene t research analyses, as well as programmatic budgeting and implementation. The methods section includes an overview of the research design, typical SYEP structures, budget assumptions, and a costing workbook, which users can adjust for their city\u2019s speci cations (see Electronic Supplementary Material 1). The results section breaks down typical SYEP costs, contributing factors, and scenarios that might alter these parameters. Finally, the discussion section outlines key components and costs for SYEPs aimed at violence prevention, as well as future directions for research.\n2 Methods This case study and its accompanying workbook present the costs of a typical violence prevention-focused SYEP, informed by the frameworks of economic analysis and costing [28] of public [29, 30] and nonpro t interventions [27]. Costs are built using an ingredients-based approach from the bottom up, itemizing the key resources necessary to implement SYEPs with the goal of violence prevention.\nUnit costs were gathered by reviewing publicly available budgets and reports for SYEPs that explicitly include youth who were justice-involved or at risk for violence (e.g., Boston and New York). Salary costs were estimated using OpenPayrolls.com information on average salaries of public-sector local employees in similar roles. Youth stipend unit costs were entered as a factor of the minimum wage in order to adjust for locality differences. All costs are from the perspective of the entity implementing the SYEP. While we do not include costs to the youth or employers for participating, and therefore this is not a societal perspective, these costs are discussed. Nonmonetary costs such as volunteer hours or in-kind donations are presented using their monetary value (replacement cost approach) so that programs can plan for these resources if they are not available.\nThe cost assumptions presented here are broken down by organization (i.e., lead city agency, SYEP providers, employers, and youth participants) and major budget categories (i.e., staff, training, equipment, indirect costs, and stipends). They represent three years of funding and implementation\u2014a period that often aligns with funding proposals and presents differences in the initial investment required compared to annual and recurrent costs. A 3.6% annual in ation factor was included based on projections for 2023 [31]. Units, unit costs, and formulas developed using the methods and assumptions described in this paper are visible and editable in the supplementary workbook, where users can easily alter key program parameters such as wages and the number of youth served to have these cascade through other formulas as needed.\n2.1 SYEP Structure and Underlying Case Study Assumptions A typical SYEP brings together a lead city o ce to oversee the program, SYEP providers to support and train the youth, and employers to hire them for the summer (see Fig.\u00a01 and Table I).\n[Figure 1 about here]\nSeveral key staff members are employed by each organization\u2014either through seasonal full-time salaried or contract-based work\u2014to implement various aspects of the SYEP (see Table II). This case study assumes a mid-sized city\u2019s violence prevention-focused SYEP has 1 lead city agency, 6 SYEP providers, 200\u2013500 employers, and 3,000 summer youth participants, paid $12.50 per hour.\n[Table I about here]\n[Table II about here] 2.2 Cost Assumptions for the Lead City Agency The lead city agency, usually a youth or workforce development agency, is responsible for the overall development and execution of the program. Sta ng at the city agency depends on where within other city departments it is housed and program size. Here we assume there is a director, an assistant director, and four data and administrative employees. The director and assistant director positions are likely only partially allocated to the SYEP. In this example, the director is assumed to spend 25% full-time equivalent (FTE) and the assistant director is included at 50% FTE. Data and administrative employees are assumed to work full-time for 6 months, including the time for application processing, the summer employment months, and reporting afterward. Staff may be employed year-round but allocated to other tasks.\nThe total cost to employers (TCE) includes mandatory and optional contributions. The mandatory portion is included as a 13.3% markup for federal payroll taxes such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Additional state requirements can be added into the costing workbook, and will result in a higher TCE on the same monthly salary levels. The example also includes a 15% assumption for bene ts provided to salaried employees of the city agency, such as employee development, cell phone or vehicle allowances, and employer contributions to health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, and retirement or pension savings. The annual increase is assumed to match the in ation level (3.6%), though it may be higher if merit- or years-of-service-based increases are standard.\nTraining costs are mostly for printed materials, such as youth training workbooks and any necessary translations. Topics might include workplace etiquette, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter writing, nancial literacy, con ict resolution, trauma-informed care, and hiring interview practice. It can be cost saving for the city to bulk print training workbooks for multiple years in year 1. Other material costs to the city agency may include printing recruitment yers and/or posting digital advertisements. These costs are assumed to be annual and informed by the number of worksites, participants, and in ation increases.\nPage 4/10\nEquipment needs are limited to laptops or tablets and workspaces. This equipment should last multiple years and therefore units and costs for years 2 and 3 of the program are assumed to be zero. Some of the equipment needed may already be available from a previous project, but is included in the budget to account for new programs, wear and tear, loss and breakage, and allocation of shared equipment costs to speci c budgets.\nAn indirect rate is included for all other administrative, personnel, and back-end costs that are not accounted for in the line-item budget. We estimate 15% of the direct sta ng, training, and equipment costs for both the city agency and the SYEP providers, in accordance with typical city and major funder guidelines. One cost that may require more consideration is the payroll functions for youth employees, as bringing thousands of youth on for short-term contracts each year may be an administrative challenge. Cities can outsource to a payroll company, rely on existing capacity, or push the responsibility to SYEP providers. The indirect rate may need to be increased once the role is assigned. 2.3 Cost Assumptions for the SYEP Providers SYEP providers are on-the-ground organizations responsible for implementing the SYEP, and may be community-based organizations (CBOs), nonpro t or forpro t organizations, universities, foundations, or other entities. In this case study, each SYEP provider supports on average 500 youth. In large cities, providers may be strati ed across neighborhoods; in others, certain providers might focus on their own needs (park departments on landscaping, school districts on summer camps, and so on).\nSta ng assumptions for each SYEP provider include a program manager, a program assistant, 5 youth employment specialists (YESs), 25 team leads, and a data entry staff member. Costs are calculated for each SYEP provider, then multiplied by the number of SYEP providers implementing each summer for a total cost to the city, who is implementing the overall program.\nThe program manager and program assistant positions are assumed to spend 50% FTE on the SYEP. YESs are often individuals with prior experience in education, youth development, or social services, who are hired in the spring for 6-month full-time contracts. Team leads are often graduates of previous years\u2019 SYEPs or residents of served neighborhoods, who are hired in the summer for 3-month contracts. A data entry staff person is typically hired in the spring for a 6-month contract as well. Team lead-to-youth ratios should be assessed to provide adequate support based on local factors like worksites\u2019 SYEP experience level, number of youth employed at each worksite, and target populations\u2019 relative risk or need levels.\nThis case study assumes that the SYEP providers have a 10% cost bene ts package. A factor of 13.3% is again included in the TCE to account for federal, state, or local mandatory employer contributions. In this example, the costs for sta ng are scaled to the youth stipend paid at the minimum wage, estimated using OpenPayrolls.com.\nThe YESs provide workforce training for participants at the beginning of the summer, using curricula and materials provided by the lead city agency. Two-day training usually occurs at SYEP providers\u2019 o ces or a community space. In this example, training day lunches are provided and cost $12.50 per youth per day. Costs are incurred annually at the start of each summer and increase with in ation. If a signi cant proportion of youth return for multiple summers, training topics or depth can be expanded. Team leads may also need training and support as part of their own onboarding in skills like cross-age mentoring, problem solving, impulse control, con ict resolution, and linkage to assistance for mental health, trauma, and violence interruption [12, 25, 32].\nEquipment such as laptops or tablets and workspaces for staff should last for multiple years; however, the cost of equipment should account for replacement for loss and wear and tear. It is assumed that 20% of the devices assigned to YESs and team leads will need to be replaced annually and that the unit cost of these devices will increase with in ation. Other equipment that may be considered but is not featured in this example includes a vehicle for transportation to worksites if public transportation is limited and additional laptops for the youth to submit applications, create r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, or complete timesheets. An indirect rate of 15% is also included. 2.4 Cost Assumptions for the Youth Worksites The worksite is responsible for employing youth participants, who perform actual business functions with the support and mentorship of an SYEP provider. No costs for the employers are included in this cost analysis. While an employer may end up spending more time or resources applying for, recruiting, supervising, or supporting a summer employee through the SYEP than they would otherwise, they are also not paying the participant\u2019s hourly wages and therefore bene t from subsidized labor costs. 2.5 Youth Stipends Youth stipends are a signi cant component of SYEP funding and depend on the number of youth employed, hours and weeks worked, and pay rate. This case study assumes that participants are employed for 24 hours (3 full days) for 6 weeks. In this analysis, the youth wage is set at $12.50, though it may be whatever the minimum wage is in effect for employers. Minimum wages vary across states and range from $7.25 (federal minimum wage) to $16.50 per hour [33]. Research shows that higher wages for unskilled labor are often associated with lower crime and violence rates\u2014a fact that cities may wish to consider when establishing their budget [34].\nThe TCE includes mandatory payroll taxes but assumes there are no bene ts for short-term hourly employees. The budget also includes a transportation stipend of $4 per day for 3 days a week while youth attend training and work. Depending on where worksites are located in comparison to where the youth live, a higher transportation allowance may be a worthwhile investment to lower participation barriers.\nThis case study includes several items designed to offset costs to youth (e.g., lunch during training, transportation subsidy to worksite), thus increasing the SYEP\u2019s accessibility to a diverse participant group, including those at risk for violence. Some youth face additional participation barriers, however, such as housing, clothing, food, transportation, legal services, work readiness, and educational needs [13], which can consume much of their new income, or increase the bene ts of crime [19]. While not included in this case study, access to services that help young people obtain these necessities or offer more in-depth\nPage 5/10\nsupport, such as stabilization assistance and counseling, can be particularly bene cial to young people at risk for violence [13, 25]. At a minimum, lead city agencies should assist SYEP providers in linking participants in need to relevant city programs, especially when there is not room to include such support in the SYEP budget, as wraparound services are key in addressing the complex needs of the participating youth and their families [11].\n3. Results\n3.1 Total Costs of an SYEP The total budget needed to implement an SYEP with the assumptions outlined above is approximately $10\u00a0million each year (see Table III). This amounts to a cost of approximately $3,338 per youth. 64% of this budget ($6.4\u00a0million in year 1) supports the youth, 33% ($3.3\u00a0million in year 1) goes toward SYEP providers, and 3% ($328,000 in year 1) goes toward lead city agencies. Within each organization, sta ng accounts for the largest expenses, and equipment and training the smallest. In fact, training and equipment across both the lead city agency and SYEP providers total less than 5% across 3 years of the budget. Notably, there is not a large up-front investment in equipment or one-off purchases, with the annual cost increasing by less than 1% from year 1 ($9,991,530) to year 3 ($10,069,999).\n[Table III about here]\nNotably, youth stipends make up the largest portion of the total cost of the SYEP. In other words, the majority of resources invested are directly supporting youth employment compensation. The second largest overall cost is the SYEP provider staff, which amounts to 27 cents per every dollar, and funds continued support for youth participants. Team leads, who provide the most consistent direct mentorship to youth, account for half of the SYEP provider sta ng costs. The largest training expenses are workbooks ($70,000, accounting for 40% of the lead city agency\u2019s training budget) and the lunches provided to youth participants ($39,000, 79% of the SYEP providers\u2019 training budgets). Laptops are the biggest equipment cost for both organizations, accounting for 88% of the budget category overall. Finally, transit stipends account for just 3% of the costs for youth participants. 3.2 Scale and Adjustments The supplementary costing workbook is designed to be scaled or modi ed to local needs. Through it, the assumptions outlined in this case study can be changed to test the impact of budget decisions and alternative scenarios. For example, holding the intensity of the SYEP provider support constant (500 youth and 25 team leaders per SYEP provider), the cost per youth is reduced by 3% when the number of participants is 10 times higher (30,000 vs 3,000) or increased by 3% when the number of participants is cut in half (1,500 vs 3,000). The city\u2019s underlying cost of living has a larger impact on the SYEP\u2019s cost per youth. Nearly all (90%) of SYEP costs in the base case are for wages, salaries, bene ts, and payroll taxes; as a result, a 20% change in the hourly wage causes nearly the same change in the cost per youth served.\n4. Discussion This case study provides a detailed cost analysis and budget for a typical SYEP with the speci c goal of reducing violence. This investment works to achieve this goal by ensuring that young people in high-crime neighborhoods or circumstances are eligible to participate and by reserving adequate funding to support their needs (e.g., access to mentors, training, and supportive services). One example is New York City\u2019s Emerging Leaders SYEP, which is reserved exclusively for homeless, runaway, justice system-involved, and foster care-involved youth [18]. Los Angeles\u2019 Summer Night Lights SYEP similarly reinvests in communities impacted by violence by facilitating local programming, sports leagues, community events, free meals, and connections to local resources as part of its initiative [35]. One Summer Chicago is yet another SYEP that addressed youth needs by providing cognitive behavioral therapy to participants [17]. While SYEPs are common across the country, these examples demonstrate that their ability to reduce violence hinges on intentional participant selection, programming and support systems, and nancial investments. Making these types of opportunities available to youth at risk for violence stands to break systemic barriers to meaningful employment, offer safe spaces, and provide mentors to a group of young people who stand to bene t the most from these programs.\nWhile the cost assumptions outlined in this case study are adjustable through the supplementary costing workbook, they should be modi ed with care, so as to not jeopardize SYEP quality and ability to support youth at risk for violence. Arbitrary adjustments like increasing the number of youth served by each SYEP provider, removing transportation stipends, or relying on volunteers and unpaid internships, for example, can reduce costs, but ultimately risk eliminating essential sources of support and inserting barriers to participation [13]. Considering the high costs of police response, incarceration, medical care, loss of income, and quality of life lost, investments into violence prevention-focused SYEPs will be at least cost effective in comparison to not intervening [6, 7, 9, 18].\n4.1 Conclusion At the estimated price of $10\u00a0million annually, or $3,338 per participant, SYEPs provide youth with meaningful experiences that not only expose them to the world of work but also give them a prosocial supervised activity to engage in during the summer months when idle time and violence are at their highest [5]. By incorporating SYEP costs into their annual budgets and workplans, cities stand to both reduce violence and reinvest in the communities and futures of those most impacted by it. Future research can build upon this work by conducting cost-effectiveness analyses that address both the costs and savings of implementing violence prevention-focused SYEPs. Compared to the social and nancial costs of lives impacted by and lost to interpersonal violence, SYEPss represent an evidence-informed, positive youth development-invested option for communities.\nDeclarations\nPage 6/10\nFunding: This research did not receive any speci c grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-pro t sectors.\nAcknowledgments: The authors are grateful for Sierra Palmer and Ashley Lara for their support in collecting cost and program data as part of their practicum.\nReferences 1.
