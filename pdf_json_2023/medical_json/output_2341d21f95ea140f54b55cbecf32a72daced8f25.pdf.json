    "abstractText": "Background Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) detected by cardiac MRI (CMR) has low correlation with low voltage zones (LVZs) detected by electroanatomical mapping (EAM). We aim to study correlation of myocardial strain by CMRFeature Tracking (FT) alongside LGE with LVZs detected by EAM. Methods Nineteen consecutive CMRs of patients with EAM were analyzed offline by CMR-FT. Peak value of circumferential strain (CS), longitudinal strain (LS), and LGE was measured in each segment of the left ventricle (17-segment model). The percentage of myocardial segments with CS and LS > \u221217% was determined. Percentage area of LGE-scar was calculated. Global and segment\u2013wise bipolar and unipolar voltage was collected. Percentage area of bipolar LVZ (<1.5 mV) and unipolar LVZ (<8.3 mV) was calculated. Results Mean age was 62\u00b111 years. Mean LVEF was 37\u00b113%. Mean global CS was \u221211.8\u00b15%. Mean global LS was \u221211.2\u00b14%. LGE-scar was noted in 74% of the patients. Mean percentage area of LGE-scar was 5%. There was significant correlation between percentage abnormality detected by LS with percentage bipolar LVZ (r = +0.5, p = 0.03) and combined percentage CS+LS abnormality with percentage unipolar LVZ (r = +0.5, p = 0.02). Per-unit increase in CS increased the percentage area of unipolar LVZ by 2.09 (p = 0.07) and per-unit increase in LS increased the percentage area of unipolar LVZ by 2.49 (p = 0.06). The concordance rates between CS and LS to localize segments with bipolar/unipolar LVZ were 79% and 95% compared to 63% with LGE. Conclusions Myocardial strain detected by CMR-FT has a better correlation with electrical low voltage zones than the conventional LGE.",

            "text": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is one of the most important diagnostic tools for characterization of myocardial diseases [1]. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) detected by CMR has shown to predict ventricular arrhythmic events in dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) [2]. However, the correlation of LGE with substrate abnormalities detected by invasive electroanatomical mapping (EAM) is modest in NICM [3]. Studies have noted that 52% of EAM-scars in the RV and 36% of EAM-scars in the LV can be missed by LGE [3, 4]. This is mainly because of the inability of LGE to detect the complex scar patterns in NICM.\nNovel CMR parameters such as T1 mapping have recently been shown to be better predictors of the intramural concealed fibrosis seen in NICM [5]. Myocardial deformation parameters studied by CMR-strain imaging have the ability to detect deep intramural mechanical abnormalities within the myocardium of the left ventricle (LV) [6]. Moreover, CMR-strain is a reproducible measure which has been shown to have strong association with clinical outcomes such as death and SCD in dilated CMP [7]. However, CMR-strain has never been correlated with electrical abnormalities detected by EAM. In this study, we sought to investigate the correlation of global and segment-wise CMR-strain parameters along with the LGE-scar analysis with global and segment-wise low voltage zones picked up by EAM."

The patients underwent invasive electrophysiological studies with voltage mapping and radiofrequency ablation when deemed necessary. The diagnosis of NICM was made with corroborative evidence of LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <50%), in the absence of significant coronary artery disease (>50% stenosis as assessed by coronary angiography). The following categories of NICM were excluded: congenital heart diseases; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); and LV noncompaction. In addition, pacing-dependent patients, persistent/ long standing atrial fibrillation patients were excluded for the study. The study was conducted as per the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research and Ethics Committee of The Canberra Hospitals (2019/ETH13256)."

For the assessment of LV functions, cine imaging was performed by using a steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence in the vertical long axis, horizontal long axis and short axis. In patients with devices, Turbo Spin echo for cine imaging was used when significant susceptibility artifact was present on SSFP imaging. Patients with significant artifacts due to devices were excluded from the study. Pacing-dependent patients were excluded from the study. In patients with cardiac resynchronization devices, biventricular pacing was on. Standard parameters were repetition time/echo time 3.6/1.8 ms; sense factor 2, flip angle \u2014 60\u00b0; section thickness \u2014 8 mm; field of view \u2014 300 mm. For scar assessment, LGE images covering the entire LV were acquired approximately 15 min after an intravenous injection of 0.2 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine contrast agent. The LGE-images were acquired using a magnitude inversion-recovery (IR) or phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) gradient\u2013recalled echo sequence with 8.0 mm slice thickness. A wideband LGE sequence was used to minimize artifacts from the battery pack in subjects with device implants.\n2.2 Myocardial strain and\u00a0LGE\u2011scar assessment by\u00a0CMR\nAll the CMR studies were analysed offline by using a dedicated software called the Segment Medviso version 3.3 RX [8] (www. medvi so. com/ segme nt). The base and the apex of the LV were defined from the short-axis slices. The endocardial and epicardial borders were traced manually in the short axis, apical 3-chamber long-axis, apical 2-chamber long-axis and apical 4-chamber long-axis images in end-diastole and end-systole. Adequate precaution was exercised to avoid blood pool contamination and to exclude the papillary muscles. CMR studies with poor image quality or missing slices were excluded from the analysis. Segmentation of the LV into the standard 17-segments was carried out by the software [9]. LV dimensions, volume, mass and LVEF were estimated automatically. Myocardial strain was measured throughout the cardiac cycle by myocardial Feature-Tracking (FT) [10]. The peak measurements of three strain parameters \u2014 circumferential strain, radial strain, and longitudinal strain \u2014 were considered for analysis. Global and segment-wise strain values were extracted from the software. Circumferential strain and radial strain were measured from 16 segments\n1 3\n(excluding apical segment). Longitudinal strain was measured from all 17 segments. The strain measurements were performed in a blinded fashion by two experienced analysts.\nInter-observer reproducibility of all the three strain parameters was studied. Due to high inter-observer variability with radial strain, only circumferential strain and longitudinal strain were considered for localization of abnormalities in each segment. Peak circumferential strain and longitudinal strain values of >\u221217% were considered abnormal. This cutoff was chosen arbitrarily based on multiple studies reporting outcomes with the same cut-offs [7, 11-13]. However, there are no existing large-scale studies which have validated abnormal segmental strain values. The number of abnormal segments were counted for circumferential strain, longitudinal strain and composite of circumferential strain and longitudinal strain (circumferential + longitudinal strain). Percentage abnormal myocardium was derived as a proportion of abnormal segments. LGE-scar was determined in each segment by the EWA-algorithm [14]. Automatic delineation of scar borders was performed and was verified by an experienced CMR-analyst. The percentage area of LGE-scar for the total LV and in each segment was extracted from the software. Segmental circumferential strain, longitudinal strain and percentage area of LGE-scar was displayed on a 17-segment color polar plots."

The geometry created using ICE was registered to an endocardial 3D shell of LV acquired by the mapping catheter. High density mapping of the LV was performed at all the segments of the LV. The low voltage zones were addressed further by point-by-point mapping using a deflectable\u00a03.5-mm irrigated-tip mapping catheter with contact force (THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH-SFTM, Biosense Webster) during sinus rhythm. In patients with cardiac resynchronization devices, biventricular pacing was on. Geometry, bipolar and unipolar electrograms (EGMs) were simultaneously recorded and all segments of the ventricle were sampled. The mitral and aortic annuli were defined by ICE. In addition, the mitral annulus was verified as that with a 1:1 ratio\nbetween atrial and ventricular electrograms. Low voltage points acquired with <3 g contact force, <10 mm from the endocardial shell, points with unstable cycle length, points within 1 cm of the aortic and mitral valve annulus were all excluded from analysis. Bipolar signals were filtered at 30 to 400 Hz. Unipolar signals were measured between the tip electrode and Wilson-central terminal and were filtered at 1 to 240 Hz. The fill threshold was set to 10 mm.\nVentricular tachycardia (VT) induction was attempted in all patients with programmed ventricular stimulation with triple extrastimuli from at least two right ventricular or LV sites with at least two drive cycle lengths. Induced VTs were identified as clinical if they matched the cycle length and morphology of the stored electrograms from the ICD or the 12-lead ECG when available. VT entrainment was performed if the VTs were hemodynamically stable. Pace mapping at threshold was performed to match the inducible VT, in case the VT was hemodynamically unstable or non-sustained and repetitive. Substrate modification was performed at the regions of good pace map, aiming at elimination of local abnormal ventricular activity potentials, late potentials, and low amplitude fractionated electrograms. The contact force catheter was also used for ablation. The primary endpoint for ablation was elimination of the clinical VT and monomorphic nonclinical VT."

The interstitial fibrosis predominantly involves the basal septal, and basal inferolateral segments of the LV [18, 19]. The endocardial bipolar voltages are more sensitive to changes in the\nFig. 2 Case demonstration:\u00a0Panel A shows the bipolar voltage map by electroanatomical mapping in a patient of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with low voltage zones in the superior and inferior basal and mid-interventricular septum; Panels B and C show the localization of the bipolar and unipolar low voltage zones respectively in the same patient on the segmental polar plots; Panel D shows the late gadolin-\nium enhancement (yellow box) in the basal anteroseptum. Also seen in the inset is the segmental representation of LGE in the polar plot; Panels E and F show the segmental distribution of peak longitudinal and circumferential strain respectively in this patient with abnormalities detected in the entire basal and mid septum\n1 3\nsubendocardium [16]. However, the substrate in NICM is more likely to be in the deeper myocardial layers like mid-myocardium and epicardium which are more likely to be represented by reduction in the unipolar voltages [20]. LGE has been the conventional modality to detect myocardial scarring. While LGE has an excellent diagnostic value in detection of macroscopic scars as in ischemic cardiomyopathy, it is insensitive to pick up microscopic and diffuse\ndistribution of scars as in NICM [21]. Moreover, detection of LGE relies on the visual assessment of regional differences in uptake of gadolinium [3]. At cut-offs of unipolar voltage <8.3 mV, LGE had a low diagnostic value with sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 43% respectively to detect these low voltage zones [22].\nThe architecture of the LV myocardium is such that the subendocardial and epicardial fibers are longitudinally\nFig. 3 Case demonstration:\u00a0Panel A shows the bipolar voltage map by electroanatomical mapping in a patient of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with low voltage zones in the inferolateral basal left ventricle; Panel B shows the unipolar voltage map by electroanatomical mapping in the same patient with low voltage zones in the anterolateral and inferolateral basal left ventricle; Panels C and D show the polar\nplot of segmental distribution of peak longitudinal and circumferential strain respectively in this patient which correlates with both the bipolar and unipolar low voltage zones. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement had failed to detect any abnormality in this region\n1 3\noriented and the midmyocardial fibers are circumferentially oriented. Considering the more common mid-wall patchy distribution of scar in NICM, circumferential strain is likely to pick up these abnormalities [6]. Longitudinal strain is sensitive to abnormalities in the subendocardium and epicardium [6, 11]. A composite of these strain measures is likely to be more representative of the underlying myocardial abnormalities. In our study, the percentage abnormal myocardium of only longitudinal strain had good correlation with percentage bipolar-LVZ. The composite of circumferential and longitudinal strain had good correlation with percentage unipolar-LVZ.\n4.2 Correlation of\u00a0CMR\u2011strain with\u00a0LVZs in\u00a0NICM (Fig.\u00a02)\nThe highlight of our study is the higher concordance rate of myocardial strain compared to LGE to detect electrical abnormalities. In patients with right ventricle cardiomyopathies, the correlation between LGE and EAM-LVZs was only 48%. In the same study, 91% of patients with percentage area of EAM-LVZ <20% had no LGE, and endomyocardial biopsy was considered a better tool to correlate with EAM-LVZs [4]. LGE may fail to detect any level of fibrosis variably between 31 and 70% of the patients with NICM [3]. In a study on 90 patients with non-ischemic LV ventricular tachycardia/ventricular premature depolarizations, LGE-to-EAM voltage discordance was noted in 36% of the patients [3]. In our study, the concordance rates between LGE-scar and the EAM-LVZs was only 63%. In 80% of the patients, with percentage area bipolar or unipolar LVZ <20%, there was no LGE. In addition, the percentage area of LGE-scar had poor correlation with the percentage bipolar and percentage unipolar LVZs."

            "text": "Myocardial strain analysis can be performed by speckletracking echocardiography (STE) as well. In a recent study, endocardial longitudinal strain by STE correlated strongly with percentage bipolar low voltage zone and mid-myocardial longitudinal strain correlated strongly with percentage unipolar low voltage zone. In the same study, the concordance rate for regional abnormalities of strain with the LVZs was 75% [11]. As myocardial contraction occurs circumferentially and radially as well, it is likely that circumferential strain, which was not measured in the study, would have improved the concordance rates. While myocardial strain measured by both STE and CMR-FT have good agreement, the reproducibility of CMR-strain is better owing to the high intrinsic contrast and better delineation of blood-endocardial tissue borders [6]. Myocardial strain can also be measured by tissue tagging methods like fast\nstrain\u2013encoded MR (fast-SENC). Fast-SENC has recently been investigated in a large cohort of patients with heart failure and has shown to be predictive of poorer clinical outcomes like death and heart failure hospitalisations [7]. In our study, strain analysis was performed by CMR-FT. The advantage of this technique is that this can be applied to standard cine exams retrospectively and does not require additional time-consuming sequences (as for CMR tagging) [10]. Also, myocardial strain by CMR-FT has reasonable agreement with tissue tagging methods [13].\nAlternative CMR diagnostic tools, such as T1 mapping and ECV estimation, are being explored to see whether they better correlate with electrical abnormalities in NICM. In a study on 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, native T1 mapping values and ECV estimation had strong correlation with the collagen fraction noted in the biopsy and was better than LGE in detection of diffuse microscopic fibrosis [23]. In another study with 50 NICM patients with negative LGE, there was a significant inverse correlation between T1 values and the extent of both bipolar and unipolar low voltage areas [23].\nIn a large cohort of patients with NICM, the presence of LGE and epicardial or transmural distribution of LGE were significant predictors of ventricular arrhythmic events across different strata of LVEF [2]. Though our study was not adequately powered to detect ventricular arrhythmia events and all-cause mortality, large scale studies looking at CMR parameters beyond LGE like CMR strain and T1 mapping values are necessary to ascertain the prognostic significance of these variables [21]."

The cut-off of \u221217% applied for segmental strain abnormalities was the same as for global strain values, however this needs large scale validation. CMR analysis might not be accurate in patients with bundle branch blocks (5 patients) and high PVC burden (4 patients), though this number was small in this study. This study did not test strain measurements by tissue tagging methods, such as Fast-SENC strain. CMR-FT, despite its distinct advantages, is subject to throughplane motion artefacts. This study did not test other CMR measures like T1 mapping values, assessment of ECV and perfusion scores. Further studies are needed to determine whether these investigations can complement LGE in the risk stratification for sudden cardiac death. Since the introduction of 8.3 mV as the cut-off for defining unipolar low voltage zones, a lot of studies have retained this value. We have also used the same cut-off for defining the unipolar low voltage zones. However, these cut-off values are likely to change, while using high-density mapping with multi-electrode catheters.\n1 3"

Localization of low voltage zones with CMR-strain has better concordance than LGE. Thus, CMR-strain can inform the operator about specific regions of substrate abnormalities during a VT ablation procedure, especially in the absence of LGE scar. Our study emphasizes the need to look beyond LGE detected by CMR with novel parameters such as CMR-strain while correlating with the LV electrical abnormalities."
