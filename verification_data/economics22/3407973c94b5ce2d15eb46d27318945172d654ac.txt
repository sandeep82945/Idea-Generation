"Future research could explore the application of the LSTM ensemble model to other financial markets and asset classes to validate its effectiveness across different economic conditions and market structures. Additionally, integrating alternative data sources, such as social media sentiment or macroeconomic indicators, into the model could potentially enhance its predictive accuracy. Investigating the impact of varying the ensemble size and the threshold for consensus among the LSTMs on the model's performance could also provide valuable insights. Furthermore, applying advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to optimize the trading strategy based on the LSTM ensemble's forecasts could lead to improved investment outcomes."
