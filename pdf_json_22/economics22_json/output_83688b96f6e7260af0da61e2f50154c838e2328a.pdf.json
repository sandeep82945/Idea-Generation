ABSTRACT Objectives To study the medical expenditure and influencing factors of patients with hypertension in Shanxi Province, China. Design A crosssectional study. Setting 1088 medical institutions, including general hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, special hospitals, basic medical institutions and public health institutions. Participants 180 441 hypertensive outpatients and 14 763 inpatients from 1 January to 31 December 2017. Primary and secondary outcome measures Curative care expenditure for hypertension (CCE ht) was measured based on System of Health Accounts 2011. Influenced factors were analysed by univariate analysis and multiple layer perceptron neural network. Results In 2017, CCE ht was US$307.71 million, accounting for 3.63% of total CCE and 0.14% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Shanxi Province of China. CCE of hypertensive outpatients (CCE htout) and inpatients (CCEhtin) accounted for 44.49% and 55.51% of CCEht. Drug fee accounted for 81.55% of CCEhtout and 22.50% of CCEhtin, respectively. The top three influencing factors were drug fee, surgical fee and hospitalisation days for inpatients, and drug fee, examination fee and test fee for outpatients. Conclusions The medical expenditure of hypertension is still heavy for individuals and society. The diagnosis and treatment capacities of primary healthcare system has been enhanced. New rural cooperation medical insurance and urban employee basic medical insurance have a trend of overusing, and the burden of family healthcare expenditure is still heavy. To ease the economic burden of patients with hypertension and improve the efficiency of social resources utilisation, policymakers should pay more attention to key groups, further increase support for primary healthcare system, standardise the treatment and reimbursement of hypertension and incline the reimbursement policy to outpatient service.",

Influenced factors were analysed by univariate analysis and multiple layer perceptron neural network. Results In 2017, CCE\nht was US$307.71 million, accounting for 3.63% of total CCE and 0.14% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Shanxi Province of China. CCE of hypertensive outpatients (CCE\nht- out) and inpatients (CCEht- in) accounted for 44.49% and 55.51% of CCEht. Drug fee accounted for 81.55% of CCEht- out and 22.50% of CCEht- in, respectively. The top three influencing factors were drug fee, surgical fee and hospitalisation days for inpatients, and drug fee, examination fee and test fee for outpatients. Conclusions The medical expenditure of hypertension is still heavy for individuals and society. The diagnosis and treatment capacities of primary healthcare system has been enhanced. New rural cooperation medical insurance and urban employee basic medical insurance have a trend of overusing, and the burden of family healthcare expenditure is still heavy. To ease the economic burden of patients with hypertension and improve the efficiency of social resources utilisation, policymakers should pay more attention to key groups, further increase support for primary healthcare system, standardise the treatment and reimbursement of hypertension and incline the reimbursement policy to outpatient service.\nBACKGROUND Hypertension is the leading risk factor for many non- communicable diseases such as stroke, ischaemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. It is the leading cause of\npremature death, causing about 8.5 million deaths a year.1 2 Because of the widespread use of antihypertensive drugs, global average blood pressure has not increased significantly in the past few decades and even decreased in some regions. However, due to demographic and lifestyle changes, and the low level of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension worldwide, the prevalence of hypertension continues to increase. The prevalence of hypertension among 30\u201379- year- olds doubled in 2019 compared with that in 1990.

China has a high prevalence of hypertension, and it has risen from 18.8% in 20027 to 29.6% in 2014,8 ranking first in the prevalence of major chronic diseases.\nHypertension requires long- term treatment and medication, which affects people\u2019s health and brings heavy economic burden to families and society.6 In the USA, the average annual medical expenditure per person with high blood pressure was US$9089 per year. The total annual healthcare expenditure for people with high blood pressure was nearly US$200 billion higher than those without high blood pressure.9 In China, total annual health expenditure of patients with hypertension was about US$34.5 billion per year, accounting for 6.6% of the total health expenditure.10 Many countries have to take corresponding countermeasures because of the huge economic health expenditure. Still, despite efforts by health systems and policies to improve it, the progress in controlling hypertension as a modifiable risk factor has been slow globally.1 4 11\nCurrent research on the economic burden of hypertension lacks an exploration of its cost financing and distribution, which are critical from a public health perspective because they are fundamental to understanding the financial challenges.2 12 Therefore, we choose \u2018System of Health Accounts 2011\u2019 (SHA 2011) to analyse the curative care expenditure (CCE) of hypertension in China and multiple layer perceptron (MLP) for multivariate analysis, to provide more information for policymakers, analysts, and international comparisons.\nMETHODS Study design and data sources It was a cross- sectional study. The data consisted of two parts. The total data were collected from Shanxi Health Financial Yearbook 2017, Shanxi Health Statistical Yearbook 2017, China National Health Accounts Report 2017, Shanxi Health Accounts Report 2017, and so on. The sample data were obtained by multistage stratified cluster random sampling. First, we chose four sample cities (Taiyuan, Changzhi, Yuncheng and Xinzhou) from Shanxi Province based on the sufficient consideration of the level of health information management system and economic development. Next, we chose one county and one district in every city and selected six township hospitals and community health service organisations in every county or district. At last, we chose medical institutions and public health institutions based on the type and administrative structure of institution. The two parts of data were used to calculate the CCE of hypertension under the framework of SHA 2011, and the influencing factors were analysed by MLP neural network."

            "text": "In China, the high prevalence of hypertension mainly concentrates in the northeast and north China.16 Shanxi Province is located in Northern China with a resident population of 37 million,17 and its prevalence of hypertension is about 33.2%.18 That is, approximately 12.3 million residents of Shanxi Province suffer from hypertension. The study shows CCEht of Shanxi Province in 2017 accounted for 0.14% of GDP.16 Compared with 0.03% of GDP in the Latin American region in 2015,19\npatients with hypertension consumed a large number of health resources, which implies the prevention and control system of hypertension should be strengthened.\nThe study shows that CCEht increases with age, and the patients aged 40\u201379 account for the majority of total CCEht. Population ageing is an essential factor that increases the CCEht. As we know, China has entered the \u2018ageing society\u2019,20 which means that the economic burden caused by hypertension diseases will become heavier and heavier.\nThis study also shows that the CCEht increases significantly since the age of 30 in both sexes.

This study shows that with the increase of age, the rise of CCEht is gradually higher in women than in men. For outpatients, the CCEht is gradually higher in women than in men after age 70, and for inpatients, it is after age 50. Multiple studies have shown that adverse lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption, age, stress, body mass index, weight, family history and biological factors are all risk factors for hypertension.25\u201328 For young men, higher smoking and alcohol use rates mean men have a higher risk of high blood pressure.25 26 For women with postamenorrhoea, who are more prone to central obesity, dramatic oestrogen levels can influence their vascular system and they are more prone to systolic hypertension.27 28 Therefore, we advocate more targeted measures based on comprehensive intervention. For the young, we should pay more attention to the men. While for the old, it is the women who should be paid more attention to.\nFor a long time, Chinese patients tended to go to provincial and municipal general hospitals rather than primary healthcare systems, mainly due to insufficient medical resources, imperfect medical system, limited level of general practitioners in the primary healthcare system and patients' distrust of community doctors.29 Studies show that basic medical institution is an effective way to control hypertension.30 31 As a result, the standardised prevention and treatment of hypertension were included in the national basic public health service programme in 2009.32 Basic medical institutions offer free regular physical examinations and standardised management for patients with hypertension. Basic medical institutions should give full play in the role of prevention and treatment of hypertension. Our study shows (table 2) that 65.51% of outpatients and 53.98% of inpatients chose basic medical institutions, effectively reducing CCEht, especially CCEht- out. Although 34.41% of outpatients and 45.99% of inpatients still chose general hospitals, more than 70% of patients with hypertension chose county- level medical institutions instead of provincial (or municipal) hospital. It suggests that the diagnosis and treatment capacities of primary healthcare system has been enhanced. To better prevent and control hypertension, the government should continue to increase the\nsupport to the primary healthcare system, strengthen the standardised construction of the primary healthcare system, enhance the training of community doctors, encourage the exploration of a new model of cooperation between primary healthcare system and provincial (or municipal) hospital, guide more chronic patients to the primary healthcare system and reasonably divert patients with mild hypertension. It will effectively reduce the family economic burden and improve the utilisation efficiency of social resources.\nDifferent types of medical insurance will greatly impact patients' medical behaviour and expenses.33 This study shows the majority of outpatients and inpatients with hypertension use social medical insurance. According to the population characteristics report of the Shanxi provincial government in 2017,17 rural and urban populations accounted for 42.66% and 57.34% of total population, respectively. However, in this study, the number of rural outpatients with hypertension was nearly eight times that of urban patients. The number of hospitalised rural patients with hypertension was four times that of urban patients. It implies that NRCMI has been widely used in rural areas and has a trend of overusing. Consistent with the literatures,34 in this study, UEBMI has the highest per capita reimbursement ratio. Due to the higher reimbursement ratio, UEBMI patients tend to pursue high consumption of medical services, driven by the interests of medical institutions. It implies that patients with UEBMI are more likely to over- pursue certain unnecessary high- tech materials, technologies and high- cost treatment programmes. This suggests that the government should strengthen the standardisation of disease treatment and restrict unnecessary medical behaviour. At the same time, the research also shows that the government subsidy in inpatient is 23 times that of outpatient, and nearly half of CCEht- out is paid by OOP. It indicates that the burden of family health expenditure is still very heavy in the outpatient treatment of hypertension. For patients with stable control of hypertension, the services provided by grassroots clinics can meet the needs of patients. Compared with large general hospitals, the cost of medical services provided by grassroots clinics is lower. Therefore, the government should improve the priority of primary medical institutions in the process of hypertension treatment, incline the policy to outpatient service and increase the reimbursement limit of outpatient expenses in basic medical insurance, which is conducive to reducing the total direct medical expenses of patients with hypertension.\nAnalysis of influencing factors by MLP neural network shows that drug fee is the most important influencing factor of CCEht. This is mainly because most hospitals in China could sell retail drugs at a price plus a 15% profit margin as a source of financing for healthcare providers. This distorted incentive aggravates the unreasonable behaviour of hospitals supporting doctors with drugs. Long- term medication, irrational use of medicines by medical staff, blind and excessive consumption of new specialty drugs and imported drugs emerge one after\nP atna).

Therefore, the government should further strengthen the standardisation and supervision of drugs and inspection items, improve the usage of generic medication and inspection efficiency. In inpatients, the impact of surgical fee and hospitalisation days on CCEht- out follows drug fee. The included samples may have other medical conditions caused by high blood pressure, which means surgery costs may be incurred. The expensive imported medical materials mainly cause the high surgical fee. Research37 shows some high- value consumable medical equipments made by domestic manufacturers are fully complying with international standards and partially or completely replacing imported products. It is suggested that medical personnel use domestic supplies as much as possible, which is feasible for social and economic benefits. Hospitalisation days can also significantly increase CCEht- in. Study shows that 18.10% of the hospitalisation days are unnecessary, which increases the economic burden of patients and reduces the reasonable allocation of medical resources.38 The hospital should shorten hospitalisation time to reduce CCEht- in on the premise of ensuring medical quality.\nOur study has some limitations. First, this study samples reflect the economic burdens of hypertension from medical institutions. As we all know, patients with hypertension need long- term medication, and some patients may go directly to buy medicine in drugstores instead of medical institutions. Therefore, the true financial expenditure of patients with hypertension may be underestimated. Second, in CI, the patient\u2019s medical expenses are generally paid in advance and then reimbursed by the insurance company after treatment. So, it may be biased in allocation of CCEht in CI. Third, sample cities were selected based on the level of health information management system and economic development. More cities will improve the extension of this study, which is also the goal of our future research."
