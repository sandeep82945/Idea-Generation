1. **Quantifying the impact of US monetary policy uncertainty on emerging markets' financial stability.** This research could build on the paper's findings by examining how US monetary policy uncertainty affects emerging markets' financial stability. This could be done by looking at indicators such as exchange rate volatility, stock market volatility, and banking sector stress.
2. **Exploring the role of global value chains in transmitting US monetary policy shocks to emerging markets.** This research could investigate how global value chains amplify or mitigate the impact of US monetary policy shocks on emerging markets. This could be done by looking at how changes in US demand for intermediate goods affect emerging markets' exports and production.
3. **Examining the impact of US monetary policy on emerging markets' income inequality.** This research could investigate how US monetary policy affects income inequality in emerging markets. This could be done by looking at how changes in US interest rates affect the distribution of income in emerging markets.
4. **Developing a model that incorporates the impact of US monetary policy uncertainty on emerging markets' sovereign debt markets.** This research could develop a model that incorporates the impact of US monetary policy uncertainty on emerging markets' sovereign debt markets. This model could be used to assess the risks of sovereign debt crises in emerging markets.
5. **Conducting a cross-country analysis of the impact of US monetary policy on emerging markets.** This research could conduct a cross-country analysis of the impact of US monetary policy on emerging markets. This could be done by comparing the impact of US monetary policy shocks on different emerging markets, taking into account factors such as the size of the economy, the level of development, and the degree of financial integration.
