Students received education online, disengaging them from campus life. This may have a negative impact on students\u2019 lifestyles and expose them to a wide range of challenges and negative health outcomes (Atwa et al., 2021; Stockwell et al., 2021). People\u2019s routine lives have been disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns, affecting their daily activities. For instance, studies have reported an increase in sedentary behavior and exposure to other unhealthy lifestyle factors (Alfawaz et al., 2021).\nIt is generally believed that the health status of students is negatively affected by the stresses of academic life. These stressors are known to subsequently affect their learning abilities, academic performance and health (Pascoe, Hetrick, & Parker, 2020).\n\u00a9 Salman Alzayani, Khaldoon Al-Roomi and Jamil Ahmed.

Studies on students in the health fields from the Arab Gulf region (Abdul-E-mail, Alarbash-E-mail, Albati-E-mail, Alkhelaiwi-E-mail, &Alkhalifa-E-mail, 2022; Mosleh, Shudifat, Dalky, Almalik, & Alnajar, 2022) as well as from western countries (Alkureishi et al., 2022; Sekulic et al., 2022) have indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has had both short and long terms impacts on the social and health wellbeing of the students. It is therefore important to understand how the university students\u2019 lives may have been changed during the current COVID-19 pandemic andwhat copingmechanisms they have used to adapt to potential challenges.\nThe Arabian Gulf University (AGU) is a regional university established in 1980 and based in the Kingdom of Bahrain. AGU hosts students of both genders from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, UAE and Qatar). Since its inception, the College of Medicine and Medical Sciences (CMMS) has followed a problembased learning (PBL) curriculum as a method of education (Hamdy & Anderson, 2006). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the education at AGUwas shifted to an online format in February 2020 and has continued since then to deliver teaching mostly in the online format. However, the college is gradually including some face-to-face teaching on campus.\nThe nature of the small group learning process necessitates that in PBL, medical students in contrary to traditional education are not taught in large classes but in small groups of around 6 to 10 students with direct interaction within the group as one of the main strengths of this strategy (Yew & Goh, 2016). This interaction within small groups is associated with stronger social links between students (Laal & Ghodsi, 2012). Therefore, it would not be surprising that the change from face-to-face education to virtual would have had amuchmore long-lasting effect on the wellbeing and mental health of problem-based medical students (Bailenson et al., 2008; Nurhas, Aditya, Jacob, & Pawlowski, 2021).\nThis qualitative study explores the lived experience of PBL medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their lifestyle and mental wellbeing because of the pandemic\u2019smandated closures, lockdowns, social distancing and distance learning, as well as identifies the changes in students\u2019 behavior. While many published studies from different parts of the globe have attempted to explore such issues among students attending traditional institutions, this study to the best of our knowledge, is the first documented analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students learning in small groups (PBL)."

Subsequently, students enrolled in the study sample were from medical years three and four. The snowball sampling method was used until data saturation was achieved with a total of 14 medical student participants (Table 1). The snowball technique was considered appropriate since it enabled us to identify a homogenous group of participants who could share their lived experiences."

Discrepancies (very minor) were solved by discussions in order to reach a consensus among the two researchers. The first theme focused on the experience of mental and social wellbeing, while the second focused on the experience of lifestyle changes (Table 2).\nParticipants (n 5 14)\nGender Male 9 Female 5 Age (year) 19 1 20 1 21 9 22 1 23 2 Nationality Bahrain 8 Kuwait 3 Saudi Arabia 3 Medical year Year 3 10 Year 4 4 Marital status Single 14 Accommodation status Living with family 8\nLiving with friends 1 At university hostels 3 Living alone 2\nTable 1. Demographic characteristics of the participants\nThe lived experience of\nmedical students\n417\nTheme 1: mental and social experiences Subtheme 1: students had time to reflect on themselves. During closure and lockdown, there was a lot of time for students to start thinking positively about what they already had in their lives. Students said that the pandemic allowed them to reflect and look at the world from a different perspective and trained them to work cooperatively with their peers when they felt they were under pressure, helping them to improve themselves.\n(1) \u201cThe covid-19 experience was very positive for me\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(2) \u201cAll the lockdown and preventive measures made me know and think about myself more. Even life, people, the world, and other things; I re-evaluated everything. I was pleased with so many things that I took for granted and realized that after.\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(3) \u201cIt sure made me grow as a person, as we tended to spend much more time with ourselves and families\u201d (Female, Year 4 student)\n(4) \u201cIt has surely opened our eyes diversely in various areas as it helped us corporate and work under any circumstances\u201d (Female, Year 4 student)\n(5) \u201cIt made us appreciate the little things in life\u201d (Female, Year 4 student)\nSubtheme 2: students felt fearful and uncertain. The pandemic created mixed feelings of fear and uncertainty among students due to the continuously evolving news about the pandemic, to the extent that they were unable to attain their regular activities and productivity. They often felt distracted, overwhelmed and unable to follow up with all the news updates. Students felt worried about their own health and the people in their inner circle, trying to take all the precautions.\n(1) \u201cHonestly it was a roller coaster initially\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(2) \u201cI remember when it started, we were all afraid, and we didn\u2019t know what to do\u201d. (Male, Year 3 student)\n(3) \u201cEven though I wanted to be as productive as I can. I just couldn\u2019t\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(4) \u201cI am concerned about my health and everyone around me, and I try to take all the necessary measures to avoid the infection and avoid spreading it if I had it\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\nSubtheme 3: students\u2019 social interactions were disturbed.

Students sleeping patterns were disturbed\nTable 2. Themes identified from medical students narratives\nAGJSR 40,4\n418\nsocially isolated from their friends, peers and distant family members by staying at home for long periods of time. They talked about how difficult it was for them to be isolated from the university, missing their friends and colleagues.\n(1) \u201cIt was so different than who am I as an individual. I\u2019m more of an outgoing person and I love socializing\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(2) \u201cBeing at home for most of the time and not socializing with others was frustrating\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\n(3) \u201cI was bored of the same routine because, before the pandemic, I used tomeet up every day with my friends\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\nStudents discussed, how they shifted to social media to overcome this feeling of being socially isolated, trying to compensate for the loss of their regular social lives. Another advantage of their social media interaction and shifting their learning online was that they learned new communication skills using e-learning platforms and online video conferencing tools as they lost their normal social life.\n(4) \u201cNormal day-to-day human interaction was taken from us and we had to resort to social media and other virtual methods to interact with people to perform our daily tasks\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\n(5) \u201cPeople might see this pandemic negatively, but in fact, we learned new skills and how to adapt during tough times when normal human interaction is taken from us\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\nSubtheme 4: students were stressed and anxious. In addition to fear, uncertainty about the future and the existing situation as well as social isolation, students talked about how stressed and anxious they were due to all the COVID-19 control measures like closures and lockdowns, as they spent most of their time at home. Spending time at home frequently led them to argue and conflict with others around them, further aggravating their stress.\n(1) \u201cI had the mental breakdownmore than one time, especially because I didn\u2019t go out of my house for a long period of time\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\n(2) \u201cMost of my timewould be spent inmy room, alone, either studying, lazing around, or sleeping. My mental health was affected as I became more vulnerable to depressive episodes\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\n(3) \u201cA lot of conflicts occurred due to different personalities and ideas\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\nTheme 2: lifestyle changes experience Subtheme 1: students\u2019 way of life was changed. Students believed that the pandemic changed their lives in an unprecedentedway. They had to complywith the new norms set by the public health rules in place, including wearing face masks, using hand sanitizers and getting their temperatures checked before entering closed places. All this seemed to force them to adapt to the new realities of living under a pandemic affecting their regular lifestyles.\n(1) \u201cDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to change many things regarding my lifestyle\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\n(2) \u201cI am now used to wearing face masks and checking the temperature before entering the campus, which was not seen before the pandemic\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\nThe lived experience of\nmedical students\n419\nSubtheme 2: a lot of free time that was not utilized properly. Students narrated how they found themselves in the middle of plenty of free time that they believed was wasted and not utilized adequately, and they perceived that they had become more disorganized than before the pandemic.\n(1) \u201cThe pandemic really pushed me down at first because before that, I was organizing my time very effectively. Kept time for the gym, family and friends and studies\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\nHowever, for some other students, the availability of free time contributed positively to their lifestyles during the pandemic. For instance, a student said that he was able to use his free time more effectively and became more productive.\n(2) \u201cThe quarantine showedme howmuch time I wasted on useless activities before, and I recycled that time tomore productive activities and rearrangedmy priorities\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\nSubtheme 3: shifting dieting patterns. For many, the pandemic was associated with changed eating patterns. Some of them took the opportunity to shift to a healthy diet and ate balanced meals perhaps because they had more time to cook at home.\n(1) \u201cI started eating proper breakfast because there was time in the morning rather than rushing to the university\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\n(2) \u201cI was focused on maintaining a healthy diet\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\nFor some other participants, the dietary pattern changed negatively. For them, the predominant eating pattern was consuming unhealthy food, despite knowing that what they were consuming was not healthy. Ordering food from restaurants or eating takeaway food instead of preparing food at home became a lifestyle for these participants.\n(3) \u201cMost of my food was not healthy anymore\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\n(4) \u201cI did buy more takeout food because being at home all the time meant that I\u2019d either have to make food or buy it. And it was usually the latter, since I would be studying (and had little time to cook)\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\nSubtheme 4: most students became physically inactive. Most students regretted that they became physically inactive during the pandemic due to the lockdown and closure of gyms, losing opportunities for physical fitness. As a result, they believed that they gained more weight during the pandemic.\n(1) \u201cMy body strength and gains decreased a lot\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\n(2) \u201cBecamemore sedentary and the time was spent between watching TV and eating so during this pandemic there was a gain in weight\u201d (Male, Year 3 student)\n(3) \u201cDuring the lockdown period and when gyms were closed, I was forced to stop going to the gym for more than 7 months and this was disturbing since I enjoyed going to the gym to keep my mind off studying\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\nHowever, some of them, who were probably overweight, found extra time to start exercising and lose weight.\n(4) \u201cI started to exercise more due to the extra free time I had\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\n(5) \u201cI increased my physical activity with the help of a trainer. I felt much better. I lost around 14kg\u201d (Female, Year 3 student)\nAGJSR 40,4\n420\nSubtheme 5: students sleeping patterns were disturbed. The pandemic impacted students\u2019 sleeping patterns as they explained that they spent most of their days at home because of limitations on outdoor activities. Moreover, with transforming to online learning, they believed that they no longer needed to get up early in the morning to commute to campus.\n(1) \u201cI no longer have an organized sleeping schedule since most sessions are still online.\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)\n(2) \u201cThis had an impact on my sleeping schedule since I did not have to go attend the university so it was fine to sleep late and wake up just before the afternoon\u201d (Male, Year 4 student)"

            "text": "This study examined the lived experience of medical students\u2019 two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, strength of the study since it is relatively a long period, with its progression from uncertainty into a global pandemic along with all its preventive measures including social distancing, closure and lockdown mandates. Moreover, the study has highlighted the impact on the social and health wellbeing of students who are studying in small groups learning environment.\nStudents all over the world naturally enjoy living an active social life. Our study found that this pattern of life was among the first activities to be affected by the closure and lockdowns. Furthermore, it has impacted the students\u2019 mental wellbeing. In this study, medical students reported that being socially distant from their colleagues, teachers and campus life had a negative impact on them, leading to stress and anxiety as they spent most of their time at home. Although students felt fearful and uncertain with all the pandemic news and control measures, their views on their lives were changed. They started to appreciate what they had in their lives and looked positively to the pandemic as it gave them the opportunity to think and reflect. These results are consistentwith the findings of studies done with undergraduate students from other parts of the world (Alghamdi, 2021; Elsharkawy & Abdelaziz, 2021; Hamza, Ewing, Heath, & Goldstein, 2021; Mekonen Workneh, Ali, & Muluneh, 2021;Wang et al., 2021), which clearly demonstrates the consequences on the health and the wellbeing of medical students who were subjected such a forced lockdown (Abdul-Email et al., 2022; Alkureishi et al., 2022; Mosleh et al., 2022; Sekulic et al., 2022).\nDuring the pandemic, students\u2019 ways of life were changed as they started to adapt to preventive control measures like wearing facemasks and using hand sanitizers. During the mandated lockdowns, students\u2019 lifestyle-related behaviors were shifted into unhealthy patterns as theymostly became sedentary and physically inactive. They had a lot of free time; however, it was all wasted, and they were mainly unproductive. Moreover, it affected their sleeping pattern. While life is slowly coming back to normality, it is unlikely that these disturbances in the duration and pattern of sleep will normalize soon. The dietary habits of students seemed to have changed negatively, with a higher dependence on restaurant and takeaway food rather than on home-cooked safe food. This change in eating habits would result in overweight and obesity, as well as problems with essential nutrient deficiencies (mainly vitamin deficiencies). Similar results were found among university undergraduate students from other parts of theworld (Bertrand et al., 2021;Majumdar, Biswas,& Sahu, 2020; Matusiak, Szepietowska, Krajewski, Bia\u0142ynicki-Birula, & Szepietowski, 2020; Silva et al., 2021; Stockwell et al., 2021).\nPeople traditionally have viewed doctors as their role models. People also consider health professionals as the guardians and leaders of healthy lifestyle patterns. The results of this study show that current medical students, who would be future physicians, were not able to cope with the changes imposed on them during the COVID-19 closure and lockdowns. Since it\nThe lived experience of\nmedical students\n421\nis unlikely that the adaptation of medical students to negative lifestyle behaviors is going to revert soon to a healthy pattern or even a near-normal pattern and there is a real risk that these medical students will be far from being role models for their patients when they commence their medical careers as physicians.\nThe findings of this study provide an insight into the potential mental health and lifestyle changes among medical students in problem-based medical schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since many of these changes are unlikely to be short-term as students\u2019 habits may never revert to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, it is recommended that educational institutes should adopt policies that provide students with health, mental, social and educational support. Additionally, future research should address the intermediate and the long-term effects of COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing on students\u2019 lifestyle and mental health using appropriate robust designs."
