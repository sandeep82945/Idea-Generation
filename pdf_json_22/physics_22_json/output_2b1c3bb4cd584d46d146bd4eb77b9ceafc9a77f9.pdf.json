It is now well studied how chemical bondings determine crystal shapes via dependence of surface energies on surface orientations. Meanwhile, discoveries of topological materials have led us to a new paradigm in surface science, and one can expect that topological surface states may affect surface energies and crystal facets in an unconventional way. Here we show that the surface energy of glide-symmetric topological crystalline insulators (TCI) depends on the surface orientation in a singular way via the parity of the Miller index. This singular surface energy of the TCI affects equilibrium crystal shapes, resulting in emergence of unique crystal facets of the TCI. This singular dependence of the topological surface states is unique to the TCI protected by the glide symmetry in contrast to a TCI protected by a mirror symmetry. In addition, we show that such singular surface states of the TCI protected by the glide symmetries can be realized in KHgSb with first-principles calculations. Our results provide a basis for designs and manipulations of crystal facets by utilizing symmetry and topology.\nIntroduction.\u2014One of the fascinating phenomena in crystal physics is characteristic crystal facets. The surface energy and the crystal facets affect morphologies of materials [1\u20134], and therefore they are vital factors in controlling properties of nanomaterials [5\u201310]. In particular, the surface energies determine equilibrium crystal shapes [11\u201313], which can be realized in nanocrystals [14\u2013 16], and the surface energies are mainly determined by chemical bondings in crystals [17\u201320].\nWe expect that exotic surface states of topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) [21\u201323] lead to unconventional contributions to surface energies and to unique crystal facets. Although the crystal shapes of TCIs have been observed [24, 25], it is not well understood how the topological surface states affect the crystal shapes. Among TCIs with various crystal symmetries [26\u201335], those with nonsymmorphic symmetries are particularly interesting because of the presence of fractional translations, such as glide mirror and screw rotations [36\u2013 44]. Here we focus on a glide-symmetric TCI with timereversal (T ) symmetry [45\u201347].\nIn this Letter, we show that the emergence of the topological surface states depends on the surface orientation in a singular way because of the nonsymmorphic nature of the glide symmetry. In addition, we obtain equilibrium crystal shapes of the TCI from the surface energies. We discover that the crystal shapes of the TCI are affected by the topological surface states, and the TCI has unique facets, unlike the trivial insulator.\nAnalysis in terms of crystal symmetry.\u2014Here we consider nonmagnetic TCIs protected by glide symmetry G\u0302y = {My| 12 z\u0302}, i.e., a mirror reflection My with respect to the xz plane followed by translation by a half of a lattice vector z\u0302 along the z-direction. Henceforth we take the lattice constants to be unity and let x\u0302, y\u0302 and\nz\u0302 denote the primitive vectors. Let us first discuss surfaces with a Miller index (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3), which can be written as \u03b1x+ \u03b2y+ \u03b3z = d, where d is a constant. Under G\u0302y, this plane is transformed into \u03b1x \u2212 \u03b2y + \u03b3(z \u2212 12 ) = d. The (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface is glide-symmetric, if this plane is identical with a plane \u03b1(x\u2212a)+\u03b2(y\u2212b)+\u03b3(z\u2212c) = d, where a, b, c are integers. Therefore, when the Miller index satisfies \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b3 \u2261 0 (mod 2), the surface is glide symmetric. On the other hand, when \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b3 \u2261 1 (mod 2), the surface is not glide symmetric.\nLayer constructions.\u2014To construct a surface theory, we use layer constructions [29, 32, 42, 43], where twodimensional topological insulator layers are periodically located along the out-of-plane direction. Here we consider the simplest layer constructions for a glidesymmetric TCI, which consists of two kinds of layers LA at z = n and LB at z = n + 1 2 (n: integer), where LA and LB can be interchanged by G\u0302y. Next, we introduce weak interlayer couplings without closing the gap, while preserving Gy symmetry. Through these procedures, we obtain a three-dimensional (3D) TCI phase protected by Gy symmetry [29, 42, 48\u201350].\nHenceforth, we consider (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surfaces with \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1, 2 in order to see differences between glidesymmetric (\u03b3 = 2) and glide-asymmetric (\u03b3 = 1) cases. Here the surface becomes equally spaced steps consisting of the layers LA and LB [Figs. 1(a-1) and 1(b-1)]. We can classify the configurations of the steps into two types in terms of the number of layers in each step. In the glide-symmetric case with \u03b3 = 2, \u03b1 is odd because \u03b1 and \u03b3 should be mutually coprime. In such a case, a surface step includes \u03b1 (= odd) layers. On the other hand, in the glide-asymmetric case with \u03b3 = 1, a single step includes 2\u03b1 (= even) layers.

When \u03b3 = 2, the \u03b1 edge modes in each step lead to the surface bands in (a-2). When \u03b3 = 1, the 2\u03b1 edge modes lead to the surface bands in (b-2).

(g,h) Comparison of the surface Dirac masses at Z\u0304 point from the effective theory (ET) by Eqs. (1) and (2) (solid lines) with those from the numerical diagonalization of the simple tight-binding (TB) model H(1)TCI(k) (dots), where the parameter is \u03b4 = 0.247 in Eqs. (1) and (2).\neach step leads to gapless (gapped) states. From our effective surface theory (see Supplemental\nMaterial No. 1 and No. 7 [51]), the energy with \u03b3 = 2 is given by E\u00b1n = \u00b1 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n))2 , where m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n) is a Dirac mass\nm(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (n) = 2\u03b4 cos\n( \u03c0n\n\u03b1+ 1\n) ( n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b1+12 ) , (1)\nwith \u03b4 being a real parameter. For the glide-symmetric case with \u03b3 = 2, the bands with n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)/2 are doubly degenerate, and the band with n = (\u03b1+ 1)/2 forms the gapless surface Dirac cone [Fig. 1(a-2)]. On the other hand, in the glide-asymmetric case with \u03b3 = 1, the energy is E\u00b1n = \u00b1 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=1) \u03b1 (n))2 [51], where the Dirac mass is\nm(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 (n) = 2\u03b4 cos\n( \u03c0n\n2\u03b1+ 1\n) (n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1). (2)\nIn this case, all the bands are doubly degenerate, and gapless states do not appear [Fig. 1(b-2)].\nNext, we calculate surface states of the following simple tight-binding model on a simple orthorhombic lattice:\nH(1)TCI(k) =(\u2212m+ t1 cos kx + t1 cos ky)\u00b50\u03c43 + t2 sin ky\u00b53\u03c41\u03c31 + t3 sin kx\u00b50\u03c41\u03c33\n+ (tAB + 2t \u2032 AB cos kx) cos kz 2 \u00b51\u03c40, (3)\nwhere \u03c3i, \u03c4i, and \u00b5i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices, and \u03c30, \u03c40, and \u00b50 are the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrices. This model is constructed by stacking layers of the twodimensional topological insulators, as shown in Supplemental Material No. 2 [51], and its topological invariant\nis given in Supplemental Material No. 3 [51]. Figure 1(c) shows the bulk Brillouin zone and the (100) surface Brillouin zone. In the following, we calculate this model using the PythTB package [52], and Fig. 1(d-f) shows the band structures in the slab geometries. For the (101) and (201) surfaces with odd \u03b3 [Figs. 1(d) and 1(f)], the surface states are gapped. On the other hand, for the (102) surface with even \u03b3 [Fig. 1(e)], the surface states are gapless.\nNext, we quantitatively compare the energy gaps of H(1)TCI(k) with the Dirac mass in Eqs. (1) and (2). Figures 1(g) and 1(h) show a half of the energy gap at Z\u0304 point for various surface bands. This value is to be compared with the Dirac mass in Eqs. (1) and (2). At Z\u0304 point, the i-th energy closest to the zero energy is given by m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n) with n = (\u03b1 + 1)/2 \u2212 (i \u2212 1) when \u03b3 = 2. When \u03b3 = 1, it is given by m (\u03b3=1) \u03b1 (n) with n = \u03b1\u2212(i\u22121). The values of the Dirac mass perfectly agree with those from H(1)TCI(k) [Figs. 1(g) and 1(h)]. The behaviors of the surface states discussed so far for the nonmagnetic TCI also hold true in the magnetic TCI (Supplemental Material No. 4 [51]).\nCrystal shape of TCI.\u2014From the surface energies E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf , we can calculate the equilibrium crystal shape of the TCI by using the Wulff construction [11, 51]. The model H(1)TCI(k) is a minimal model for understanding the behaviors of the topological surface states. On the other hand, the surface energies of this model are quite anisotropic, which leads to the crystal shape with a very small thickness in the z-direction (see Supplemental Material No. 3 [51]), and it is difficult to see the effects of the topological surface states on the crystal shape. Thus, we need another model with a more isotropic crystal shape\n3 and introduce the following tight-binding model on a simple orthorhombic lattice:\nH(2)TCI(k) = ( \u2212m+ \u2211\nj=x,y,z\ntj cos kj ) \u00b50\u03c43\n+ vx sin kx\u00b50\u03c41\u03c33 + vy sin ky\u00b53\u03c41\u03c31\n+ vz sin kz\u00b50\u03c41\u03c32\n+ (vab1 + vab2 cos kx) sin kz 2 \u00b51\u03c41\u03c31. (4)\nBoth H(1)TCI(k) and H (2) TCI(k) have the same TCI phase, and the similar dependence of the surface states on the surface orientations (see Supplemental Material No. 5 [51]).\nWe calculate the surface energies E (010) surf and E (\u03b10\u03b3) surf of this model for various surface orientations up to maximum absolute values of the Miller index (\u03b1max, \u03b3max) = (3, 9), where E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf is defined by Eq. (S.3) in the Supplemental Material No. 1 [51]. According to the Wulff construction [11], we can obtain the equilibrium crystal shape minimizing the total surface energy as the following 3D region:\nW = \u22c2\nn\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u2208S2 \u0393n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , (5)\n\u0393n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = { r \u2208 R3 | r \u00b7 n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2264 E(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3)surf } , (6)\nwhere n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is the outward unit normal vector to the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface, and S2 is the unit sphere. By using the WulffPack package [53], we obtain this shape from E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf . Figures 2(a-1) and 2(b-1) show the equilibrium crystal shapes ofH(2)TCI(k) with the trivial insulator phase and the TCI phase, respectively. We show the dependence of the surface energies on the surface orientations as a function of the angle \u03b8 between the surface and the (100) plane, defined by tan \u03b8 = \u03b3/\u03b1 [Figs. 2(a-2) and 2(b-2)]. To analyze the results, we introduce the following trial function:\nF (\u03b8) =\u2206x cos |\u03b8|+ \u2206z sin |\u03b8| + \u2206xz sin |\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8102|+ \u2206xz sin |\u03b8 + \u03b8102|, (7)\nwhere \u03b8102 is the angle satisfying cos \u03b8102 = 1/ \u221a\n5 and sin \u03b8102 = 2/ \u221a 5. This function can be obtained by the analysis in terms of the numbers of dangling bonds on the surface (see Supplemental Material No. 6 [51]). The surface energy of the trivial insulator can be fitted perfectly with F (\u03b8) [Fig. 2(a-2)], and therefore the facets of the trivial insulator are determined mainly by the surface energy from chemical bonding (SECB).\nNext, we discuss the surface energy of the TCI in\nFig. 2(b-2). The appearance of the (101) and the (201) facets in Fig. 2(b-1) suggests a new mechanism other than the SECB. Here, we attribute it to the surface energy obtained only from the bands forming the Dirac cones. We\nFIG. 2. (a,b) Equilibrium crystal shapes and surface energies of H(2)TCI(k) with the parameters tx = ty = tz = 1, vab1 = 0.8, vab2 = 1.2. The other parameters are m = 6, vx = vz = 0.4, vy = 0.6 in (a) and m = 2, vx = vy = vz = 0.4 in (b). The (10\u03b3) surface energy from \u03b3 = 0 to \u03b3 = 9. The dots are determined by E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf . (a-2) The surface energy can be fitted with F (\u03b8) with \u2206x = 0.02218, \u2206z = 0.03806, and \u2206xz = 0.03414. (b-2) We fit the total surface energy (orange) and the total surface energy without the SETS (blue) with F (\u03b8) with \u2206x = 0.2445, \u2206z = 0.2490, \u2206xz = 0.07343 in the former case and \u2206x = 0.08238, \u2206z = 0.1940, \u2206xz = 0.1340 in the latter case.

(e) Comparison of \u2206xz/\u2206i (i = x, z) for the trivial insulator in (a-2), the TCI [orange fitting in (b-2)], and the TCI without the SETS [blue fitting in (b-2)]. (f) The equilibrium crystal shape when H(2)TCI(k) has the more distant hopping term with m = 2, tx = ty = tz = 1, vx = 0.4, vy = 0.6, vz = 0.2, vab1 = 0.8, vab2 = 0.9, and vab3 = 0.8.\nrefer to this as the surface energy from topological surface states (SETS), which is defined by Eq. (S.4) in Supplemental Material No. 1 [51]. Figure 2(b-2) also shows the total energy minus the SETS. We fit the total surface energy and the total surface energy without the SETS with Eq. (7), and in the latter fitting a sharp dip at \u03b8 = \u03b8102 appears, which is similar to the surface energy in the trivial insulator in Fig. 2(b-1). In addition, we calculate the equilibrium crystal shape from the surface energies of the TCI without the SETS [Fig. 2(c)]. This result shows that the (101) and the (201) facets are due to the SETS. Figure 2(d) also shows the SETS in the TCI.\nWe confirm the above interpretation by analyzing the\n4 fitting data for \u2206x, \u2206z, and \u2206xz. Figure 2(e) shows comparison of \u2206xz/\u2206i (i = x, z) for the cases corresponding to Figs. 2(a-1), 2(b-1), and 2(c). In the trivial insulator, \u2206x, \u2206z, and \u2206xz are of a similar order of magnitude, corresponding to hoppings almost isotropically distributed in the xz plane. In the TCI phase, the hopping parameters used in our calculation are almost the same as the trivial insulator phase, but unexpectedly, \u2206x, \u2206z, and \u2206xz become quite anisotropic [Fig. 2(e)]. We see from\nFig. 2(e) that it restores the isotropic behavior by subtracting the SETS. A more detailed discussion is in Supplemental Material No. 5 [51]. Thus, we conclude that the unique crystal shape of the TCI are due to the SETS. Figure 2(f) also shows the crystal shape when we add a more distant hopping term vab3 cos 2kx sin kz 2 \u00b51\u03c41\u03c31 to H(2)TCI(k). In this case, the additional facets appear because of the interplay between the SETS and the SECB from the bonds in various directions.\nMaterial realization.\u2014Here we show that these singular surface states can be realized in KHgSb proposed as a G\u0302x-symmetric TCI with space group #194 [47], where G\u0302x = {Mx| 12 z\u0302} with Mx being a mirror reflection with the yz mirror plane. It has a phase transition to #186 when T < 150K [54], and here we will discuss the low-temperature phase with #186. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the crystal structures of KHgSb. Figure 3(c) is the Brillouin zone and the (010) surface Brillouin zone. To make it easier to see whether the surfaces are glide invariant or not, we double the original hexagonal unit cell and take an orthorhombic unit cell with the lattice vectors a1=(A, 0, 0), a2 = (0, B, 0), and a3 = (0, 0, C), where A, B, and C are lattice constants. The enlarged unit cell leads to a translation symmetry given by T\u0302 = {E| 12a1 + 12a2}. The index (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) in this orthorhombicc lattice is different from the conventional Miller index in hexagonal crystals.\nNext, we consider the conditions for the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface to be glide symmetric in these symmetry settings. Let a plane P be the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) plane. Under G\u0302x, the plane P is transformed into P\u0303 . The plane P is glide symmetric when P\u0303 is equivalent to either P or P \u2032, where P \u2032 is the plane transformed from P via T\u0302 . In the former case, the index satisfies (i) \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b3 \u2261 0 (mod 2), and in the latter case, the index satisfies (ii) \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2261 0 (mod 2). When the index satisfies (i) or (ii), the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface is symmetric under the glide G\u0302x symmetry.\nThe surface states on four different surfaces are shown in Fig. 3(d-g), which have gapless hourglass surface states for the (011) and (012) surfaces because of the presence of the glide symmetry, but gapped surface states for the (021) and (023) surfaces because of the absence of the glide symmetry. These results are consistent with our analysis in terms of symmetries in the previous paragraph and can be observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Because these results are due to the\nFIG. 3. (a,b) Crystal structure of KHgSb. (c) The bulk Brillouin zone and the (010) surface Brillouin zone for KHgSb with space group #186. (d-g) Surface states of KHgSb for various surfaces.\nglide symmetry, a similar result is expected in the hightemperature phase with space group #194. On the other hand, the gaps of the (021) and the (023) surface states are 2.4meV and 2.6meV, respectively. Therefore, the surface gap is smaller than temperatures in crystal growth, and the effects of these small band gaps cannot be reflected in crystal shapes in this material.\nThe smallness of the gaps on the glide-asymmetric surface states in KHgSb is attributed to weak interlayer coupling of KHgSb [54]. The gaps on the glide-asymmetric surfaces are proportional to the strength of the interlayer couplings, as seen from the calculation ofH(1)TCI(k). Thus, the glide-symmetric TCIs with stronger interlayer coupling are suitable for experiments. In addition, nanocrystals are suitable for experimental realization of equilibrium crystal shapes. Summary and Discussion.\u2014 Here we discuss another\ntype of TCI, i.e. a TCI with surface states protected by a mirror My symmetry. The surface states can affect the equilibrium crystal shapes. On the other hand, in this letter, we theoretically show novel dependence of presence/absence of gapless topological surface states on the parity of the surface Miller index. This is unique to the TCI protected by glide symmetry. As we show in Supplemental Material No. 8 [51], the gapless surface states survive surface reconstructions. We discovered that the topological surface states significantly affect the facets realized in the TCI by calculations of the model. The facets of the TCI can be determined by the interplay between the surface energy from chemical bonding and that from the topological surface states.

Effective surface model\nHere we consider the model from the layer construction. We introduce effective surface Hamiltonians that includes hybridizations of the helical edge modes between the adjacent layers. Because the layers LA and LB are 2D topological insulators, the Hamiltonians for the edges of the layers LA and LB along the y-axis can be expressed as HA = vky\u03c31 and HB = \u2212vky\u03c31, respectively, where v is a real constant. Furthermore, we introduce the coupling term H\u03b4 = \u03b4\u03c30 between adjacent layers LA and LB , where \u03b4 is a real constant. Therefore, in the case with \u03b3 = 2, the effective surface Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nH(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (ky) = \u03b1\u22121 2\u2211\nz=0\n[ c\u2020zHAcz ] +\n\u03b1\u22123 2\u2211\nz=0\n[ c\u2020 z+ 12 HBcz+ 12 ]\n+\n\u03b1\u22123 2\u2211\nz\u2032=0, 12 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n[ c\u2020z\u2032H\u03b4cz\u2032+ 12 + h.c. ] . (S.1)\nwhere \u03b1 is an odd number, and cz = (cz\u2191, cz\u2193)T (2z \u2208 Z) is an annihilation operator for electrons on the layer within the plane at z. On the other hand, when \u03b3 = 1, the effective surface Hamiltonian is\nH(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 (ky) = \u03b1\u22121\u2211\nz=0\n[ c\u2020zHAcz + c\n\u2020 z+ 12 HBcz+ 12\n]\n+ \u03b1\u22121\u2211\nz\u2032=0, 12 ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n[ c\u2020z\u2032H\u03b4cz\u2032+ 12 + h.c. ] . (S.2)\nFor the details on how to obtain the eigenvalues of these Hamiltonians, see Supplemental Material No. 7.\nB. Details of calculations of the surface energies\nTo calculate the surface energy, we consider a slab geometry with the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface. This slab has finite thickness in the direction perpendicular to the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surface and has periodic boundary conditions along the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) directions. Let us introduce hoppings between the top surface and the bottom surface of the slab, and then we replace this hopping parameter t with \u03bbt with \u03bb being a real parameter. When \u03bb = 0, this system is just a slab geometry. On the other hand, when \u03bb = 1, this system is equal to a bulk crystal because it has the periodic boundary conditions along all directions. We introduce a Hamiltonian H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb) with such geometry, and the surface energy of H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb) can be expressed as\nE (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf =\nN\u2211\nn=1\nE (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=0 \u2212 E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=1\n2Sslab , (S.3)\nwhere E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb is the energy from a n-th band of H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb), N is the total number of occupied bands, and Sslab represents the area of the slab surface of H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb).\nNext, we discuss the details of the calculations of the SETS. Let us assume that H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (0) has Nsurf occupied bands forming the surface states, and the bands are labeled by n = N \u2212 Nsurf + 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N . We define the surface energy from topological surface states (SETS) in terms of the difference between E\n(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=0 and E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=1 with\nn = N \u2212Nsurf + 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N :\nE (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) SETS =\nN\u2211\nn=N\u2212Nsurf+1\nE (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=0 \u2212 E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb=1\n2Sslab . (S.4)\n3 C. Wulff construction\nAccording to the Wulff construction, the distance h\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 between a surface with a Miller index (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) and the crystal\ncenter is proportional to E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf : E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf /h\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = l, where l is a constant. Thus, we can obtain the crystal shape through the following steps: (i) First, we calculate h\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf for a Miller index (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3). (ii) We fix the origin (0, 0, 0)T and draw the plane at a distance E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf from the origin. This plane is along the (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) plane. (iii) By repeating (i) and (ii) for various Miller indices, many planes will be obtained, and the innermost closed curve composed of these planes is the equilibrium crystal shape.\nD. Details of the first-principle calculations\nWe performed first-principle calculations on KHgSb in the main text within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchangecorrelation [1] implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [2], combining with maximally localized Wannier functions [3] to obtain the surface local density of states by surface Green\u2019s function [4\u20136].\nSupplemental Material No. 2. NONMAGNETIC TOPOLOGICAL CRYSTALLINE INSULATOR FROM THE LAYER CONSTRUCTION\nA. Layer constructions\nHere we construct the 3D tight-binding model of a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) protected by glide symmetry from the layer construction [7\u201310]. This model is the first model H(1)TCI(k) of the TCI in the main text. We start from a simple tight-binding model of a 2D topological insulator (TI) on a square lattice written as\nHTI(k) =\u2212 (m\u2212 t1 cos kx \u2212 t1 cos ky)\u03c43 + t2 sin ky\u03c41\u03c31 + t3 sin kx\u03c41\u03c33, (S.5)\nwhere \u03c4j and \u03c3j (j = 1, 2, 3) are Pauli matrices, \u03c40 and \u03c30 are the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrices, and we set the lattice constants to 1. In order to break the mirror Mx, My, and Mz symmetries with Mx = \u2212i\u03c43\u03c31, My = \u2212i\u03c43\u03c32, and Mz = \u2212i\u03c43\u03c33, here, we introduce the second and third terms, t2 sin ky\u03c41\u03c31 and t3 sin kx\u03c41\u03c33. We set the Fermi energy EF to be EF = 0. This Hamiltonian has inversion (I) symmetry and time-reversal (T ) symmetry:\nIHTI(k)I\u22121 = HTI(\u2212k), T HTI(k)T \u22121 = HTI(\u2212k), (S.6)\nwhere I = \u03c43, and T = \u2212i\u03c40\u03c32K with K being the complex conjugation. Next, we place layers of the 2D TI of Eq. (S.5) at the z = n planes (n \u2208 Z) in real space. In this case, a Hamiltonian HA consisting of the layers can be expressed as follows:\nHA = \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x+ 1, y, z) ( t1 2 \u03c43 + t3 2 i\u03c41\u03c33 ) c(x, y, z)\n+ c\u2020(x, y + 1, z) ( t1 2 \u03c43 + t2 2 i\u03c41\u03c31 ) c(x, y, z) + h.c. ] \u2212 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x, y, z)m\u03c43c(x, y, z) ] , (S.7)\nwhere c\u2020(x, y, z) is a creation operator at the (x, y, z) site, and x, y and z run over integers. Now, we design the system to be invariant under the glide G\u0302y symmetry:\nG\u0302y = {My|00 12}, (S.8)\nwhere My represents the mirror reflection with respect to the xz plane. Under G\u0302y, a creation operation c \u2020 \u03b1(x, y, z) transforms as\nG\u0302y : c \u2020 \u03b1(x, y, z) \u2192 c\u2020\u03b2(x,\u2212y, z + 12 ) [ My ] \u03b2\u03b1 ,\nwith\nMy = \u2212i\u03c43\u03c32, (S.9)\n4 where \u03b1 and \u03b2 run over the basis of Eq. (S.5). In addition, by making copies of HA by the glide transformation G\u0302y [8, 9], we obtain layers B at z\u2032 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u22121/2, 1/2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , with the Hamiltonian of the layers B expressed as\nG\u0302y : HA \u2192 HB \u2261 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x+ 1,\u2212y, z + 12 ) ( t1 2 \u03c43 + t3 2 i\u03c41\u03c33 ) c(x,\u2212y, z + 12 )\n+ c\u2020(x,\u2212y \u2212 1, z + 12 ) ( t1 2 \u03c43 + t2 2 i\u03c41\u03c31 ) c(x,\u2212y, z + 12 ) + h.c. ]\n\u2212 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x,\u2212y, z + 12 )m\u03c43c(x,\u2212y, z + 12 ) ]\n= \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x+ 1, y, z + 12 ) ( t1 2 \u03c43 + t3 2 i\u03c41\u03c33 ) c(x, y, z + 12 )\n+ c\u2020(x, y + 1, z + 12 ) ( t1 2 \u03c43 \u2212 t2 2 i\u03c41\u03c31 ) c(x, y, z + 12 ) + h.c. ]\n\u2212 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ c\u2020(x, y, z + 12 )m\u03c43c(x, y, z + 1 2 ) ] . (S.10)\nBy combining the layers B with the layers A, we obtain the layer constructions with the glide G\u0302y symmetry. Furthermore, we introduce interlayer hoppings between the A and B layers. Then we obtain the overall Hamiltonian of the TCI written as\nH (1) TCI = HA +HB +HAB , (S.11)\nwhere HAB denotes the Hamiltonian of the interlayer couplings\nHAB = \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ tAB\n2\n( c\u2020A(x, y, z)cB(x, y, z + 1 2 ) + c \u2020 B(x, y, z + 1 2 )cA(x, y, z + 1) + h.c. )\n+ t\u2032AB\n2\n( c\u2020A(x, y, z)cB(x+ 1, y, z + 1 2 ) + c \u2020 A(x, y, z)cB(x\u2212 1, y, z + 12 )\n+ c\u2020B(x, y, z + 1 2 )cA(x+ 1, y, z + 1) + c \u2020 B(x, y, z + 1 2 )cA(x\u2212 1, y, z + 1) + h.c.\n)] , (S.12)\nwith c\u2020A(x, y, z) and c \u2020 B(x, y, z) being the creation operators at the layers A and B, respectively [see Supplementary\nwhere N is the number of unit cells, \u03b1 runs over eight basis states spanned by \u03c43 = \u00b1, \u03c33 = \u00b1, and A/B sublattices, r\u03b1 denotes the positions of the sites in the unit cell, and R = (x, y, z) is the position of the unit cell with x, y, z \u2208 Z. By using the Fourier transformations, the Bloch Hamiltonian of H\n(1) TCI is written in terms of the eight basis states.\nWe obtain the following Bloch Hamiltonian of H (1) TCI:\nH(1)TCI(k) =\u2212 (m\u2212 t1 cos kx \u2212 t1 cos ky)\u00b50\u03c43 + t2 sin ky\u00b53\u03c41\u03c31 + t3 sin kx\u00b50\u03c41\u03c33 + (tAB + 2t \u2032 AB cos kx) cos kz 2 \u00b51\u03c40, (S.14)\nwhere \u00b5i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices corresponding to the A/B sublattices, and \u00b50 is the 2\u00d7 2 identity matrix. Under G\u0302y, a creation operator c \u2020 \u03b1(k) transforms as\nG\u0302y : c \u2020 \u03b1(kx, ky, kz) \u2192 c\u2020\u03b2(kx,\u2212ky, kz) [ Gy(kz) ] \u03b2\u03b1 , (S.15)\n5 Supplementary Fig. 1.

(S.14). The Hamiltonian H(1)TCI(k) has the glide G\u0302y symmetry:\nGy(kz)H(1)TCI(kx, ky, kz)G\u22121y (kz) = H (1) TCI(kx,\u2212ky, kz). (S.17)\nSupplementary Figure 1(b) shows the bulk Brillouin zone and the (100) surface Brillouin zone. From the Bloch Hamiltonian H(1)TCI(k), we calculate the bulk band structures [Supplementary Fig. 1(c,d)]. Furthermore, we calculate the band structures for the (100) slab when the system size along the x-direction is Lx = 30 [Supplementary Fig. 1(e,f)].\nUnder I\u0302, a creation operator c\u2020\u03b1(k) transforms as\nI\u0302 : c\u2020\u03b1(kx, ky, kz) \u2192 c\u2020\u03b2(\u2212kx,\u2212ky,\u2212kz) [ I ] \u03b2\u03b1 , (S.18)\n6 kz\nkx\nky \u0393\nY\nZ\nC\nA\nD\nE\nB\n(a) kz\nkx\nky \u0393\nY\nZ\nC\nA\nD\nE\nB\n(b)\nSupplementary Fig. 2. The parity eigenvalues of the occupied states of the bulk Hamiltonian [Eq. (S.14)] at the high-symmetry points in the k-space. The parameters are t1 = t2 = t3 = 1, tAB = 0.5, t \u2032 AB = 0, (a) m = 1, and (b) m = 3. The parity eigenvalues at the high-symmetry points satisfy (Z2,Z2,Z2,Z4) = (0, 0, 0, 2) in (a), and (Z2,Z2,Z2,Z4) = (0, 0, 0, 0) in (b), respectively.\nwith I = \u03c43. Thus, the Hamiltonian H(1)TCI(k) has I symmetry:\nIH(1)TCI(kx, ky, kz)I\u22121 = H (1) TCI(\u2212kx,\u2212ky,\u2212kz). (S.19)\nBecause of I symmetry, we can diagnose the topological invariant in terms of the parity eigenvalues of the occupied states at high-symmetry points in the k-space. The symmetry-based indicator [11\u201313] in the space group No. 13 (P2/c) can be expressed as (Z2,Z2,Z2,Z4) with the strong Z4 indicator being\nz4 = 1\n4\n\u2211\n\u0393j\n( n+(\u0393j)\u2212 n\u2212(\u0393j) ) , (S.20)\nwhere n+(\u0393j) (n\u2212(\u0393j)) is the number of occupied states with even (odd) parity eigenvalues at the high-symmetry points \u0393j (= \u0393, Y , Z, C, B, A, D, E) in the Brillouin zone. When the three weak Z2 indices are trivial ((Z2,Z2,Z2) = (0, 0, 0)), z4 = 2 indicates that a given insulator is a TCI protected by the glide symmetry [7, 8]. We obtain the parity eigenvalues of the occupied states from the bulk Hamiltonian [Eq. (S.14)] with the parameters being t1 = t2 = t3 = 1, tAB = 0.5, m = 1 [Supplementary Fig. 2(a)], and m = 3 [Supplementary Fig. 2(b)]. Supplementary\nFig. 2(a) (m = 1) shows parity eigenvalues for a topologically nontrivial case with the symmetry-based indicator (Z2,Z2,Z2,Z4) = (0, 0, 0, 2). In the band structures in the slab geometry with these parameters, the gapless states appear on the (100) surface as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1(e). On the other hand, Supplementary Fig. 2(b) (m = 3) shows a topologically trivial case with the symmetry-based indicator (Z2,Z2,Z2,Z4) = (0, 0, 0, 0), which results in the absence of the gapless states on the (100) surface [Supplementary Fig. 1(f)].\nC. Crystal shape of the nonsymmorphic topological crystalline insulator\nNow we discuss an equilibrium crystal shape for the TCI phase protected by Gy symmetry [Eq. (S.14)], which is determined to minimize the surface energy of the crystal. Here, we study a crystal with a cylindrical shape along the y-axis, which limits the crystal surfaces to be along (\u03b10\u03b3). By using the Wulff construction [14], we can obtain an equilibrium crystal shape from the surface energy E (\u03b10\u03b3) surf . For the details of the calculations of the surface energies, see \u201cMethods\u201d in the main text. The surface energy are calculated up to a maximum absolute value of the Miller index of 5. From these surface energies, we can obtain an equilibrium shape of the crystal [Supplementary Fig. 3(a)]. The equilibrium crystal shape of the TCI has the (001) surface over a wide range because the (001) surface energy is much lower than those of the other surfaces. This property results from two factors. First, the absence of topological surface states on the (001) surface results in the preference of the (001) surface over other surfaces with the topological\n7 (101) surface (100) surface (b) (c)\n(d) (e)\n(001) surface (102) surface\n(001)\n(a) (102)\n(101)\n(100)\nSupplementary Fig. 3. Equilibrium shape of the crystals for the Hamiltonian H(1)TCI(k) from the Wulff construction. The parameters of the tight-binding model [Eq. (S.14)] are set to be t1 = t2 = t3 = m = 1, tAB = 0.35, t \u2032 AB = 0.25. The slab thickness is L = 30. E\u03b1\u03b3surf is obtained from Eq. (S.14). The maximum absolute Miller indices are 5.

(b-e) Band structures calculated in the slab geometry, where the slabs have the (001) surface in (b), the (102) surface in (c), the (101) surface in (d), and the (100) surface in (e).\ngapless states. Second, in this calculation of the tight-binding model, the hopping amplitudes in the z direction, tAB and t\u2032AB are smaller than those in the x and y directions, t1, t2, and t3. It lowers the (001) surface energy over the (100) surface because the surface energy increases as the strengths of the chemical bondings along the direction perpendicular to the surface increase.\nWe find that the crystal shape of the TCI has the (001), (102), (101), and (100) facets in Supplementary Fig. 3(a). In addition, we calculate the band structures in the slab geometry with the (001), (102), (101), and (100) surfaces [Supplementary Fig. 3(b-e)]. Because the (001) and the (101) surfaces are not glide symmetric, the surface states are gapped [Supplementary Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)], whereas the glide-symmetric (102) and (100) surfaces are gapless [Supplementary Figs. 3(c) and 3(e)]. Thus, the crystal of the TCI is formed by the (001), (102), (101), and (100) facets with the (100) and (102) facets being gapless and the (001) and (101) facets being gapped. Our calculations of surface energies automatically include contributions both from surface states and from bulk occupied states. The\n8 Supplementary Fig. 4.

Surface energy of H(1)TCI(k)\nIn this section, we discuss the surface energies of our model H(1)TCI(k). Henceforth, we choose the parameters t1 = t2 = t3 = 1. As we show in Fig. 1(d-f) in the main text, the flat bands appear along \u0393\u0304-Z\u0304 on the (101), (102), and (201) surfaces when t\u2032AB = 0. On the other hand, when t \u2032 Ab 6= 0, they are no longer flat as shown in Supplementary\nSupplementary Fig. 4(a-1) shows the surface energy E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf of H (1) TCI(k) as a function of the angle \u03b8 between the surface and the (100) plane, defined by tan \u03b8 = \u03b3/\u03b1. Then Supplementary Fig. 4(a-2) shows the E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) SETS . The SETS does not have a peak at \u03b8 = \u03b8102, unlike the H(2)TCI(k) we discuss in the main text. Next, as in the main text, we introduce the following trial function:\nF (\u03b8) = \u2206x cos |\u03b8|+ \u2206z sin |\u03b8|+ \u2206xz sin |\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8102|+ \u2206xz sin |\u03b8 + \u03b8102|, (S.21)\nwhere \u03b8102 is the angle satisfying cos \u03b8102 = 1/ \u221a 5 and sin \u03b8102 = 2/ \u221a 5. This function can be obtained by the analysis in terms of the numbers of dangling bonds on the surface in Supplemental Material No. 6. We fit E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf in Supplementary Fig. 4(a-1) with F (\u03b8). The function does not have the cusp at \u03b8 = \u03b8102 unlike the case of H(2)TCI(k) in the main text. In addition, the surface energy at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is small compared to the other surface energies, leading to the (001) surface occupying the majority of the total surface of the crystal [Fig. 4(a-3)].\nNext, we discuss the case of the trivial insulator phase by settingm = 6, tAB = 0.35, and t \u2032 AB = 0.25. Supplementary\nFig. 4(b) shows the dependence of E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf on the surface orientations as a function of the angle \u03b8, and we fit E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf\n9 Supplementary Fig. 5. Surface energy and crystal shapes ofH(1)TCI(k) when t\u2032AB = 0. We choose the parameters t1 = t2 = t3 = 1, tAB = 0.5, t \u2032 AB = 0, (a) m = 1 (TCI), and (b) m = 6 (trivial insulator). (a-1,b-1) The (10\u03b3) surface energy from \u03b3 = 0 to \u03b3 = 9. The dots are determined by E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf . We fit the surface energy with F (\u03b8), where the fitting parameters are \u2206x = 0.6422, \u2206z = 0.02270 in (a-1) and \u2206x = 0.08560, \u2206z = 0.0001406 in (b-1). (a-2) The SETS E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) SETS of the TCI. (a-3) The equilibrium crystal shape of the TCI. (b-2) The equilibrium crystal shape of the trivial insulator.\nwith F (\u03b8). This fitting and that for TCI [Supplementary Fig. 4(a-1)] have a similar dependence on \u03b8. Furthermore, Supplementary Fig. 4(b-2) shows the equilibrium crystal shape of the trivial insulator. This crystal shape is similar to that of the TCI [Supplementary Fig. 4(a-3)] in that the (001) surface occupies the majority of the total surface of the crystals. These results indicate that it is difficult to see the effect of topological surface states on the crystal shape in H(1)TCI(k), unlike H (2) TCI(k) in the main text. In this model, because the interlayer couplings are weak, the (001) surface energy becomes significantly smaller than other surfaces, and the SETS cannot affect the crystal shape.\n2. H(1)TCI(k) with t\u2032AB = 0.\nHere, we show that the SETS cannot affect the crystal shape also when t\u2032AB = 0. We begin with the case of the TCI phase with m = 1, tAB = 0.5, and t \u2032 AB = 0. Supplementary Fig. 5(a-1) shows the dependence of the surface energies E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf on the surface orientations as a function of the angle \u03b8. In addition, Supplementary Fig. 5(a-2) indicates the E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) SETS . Because t \u2032 AB = 0, the second-nearest neighbor hopping vanishes in this model, which means that the third and fourth terms in F (\u03b8) are not necessary [Eq. (S.21)]. Therefore, we introduce the fitting function\nF \u2032(\u03b8) = \u2206x cos |\u03b8|+ \u2206z sin |\u03b8|. (S.22)\nWe fit E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) surf in Supplementary Fig. 5(a-1) with F \u2032(\u03b8). As in the case with tAB 6= 0, the surface energy at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is so small compared to the other surface energies also in this case. It leads to the (001) surface occupying the majority of the total surface of the crystal [Fig. 5(a-3)].\nIn addition, the case of the trivial insulator with m = 6, tAB = 0.5, t \u2032 AB = 0 shows the similar behaviors as shown in Supplementary Figs. 5(b-1) and 5(b-2). Thus, it is difficult to see the effects of the topological surface states on the crystal shape, as in the case with t\u2032AB 6= 0.\n10\n(a) (b)\ntAB\nE su\nrf (0\n01 )\n(c)\nSupplementary Fig. 6.

(c) The surface energy E (001) surf with various values of tAB and a mesh in the k-space being 30\u00d7 30.\nE. Surface energy without topological surface states\nHere we estimate the values of the surface energy due to chemical bonding by calculating the energy of the slab of the TCI protected by Gy symmetry. For this purpose, we consider the simplest slab of the facet with the Miller index (001) because topological surface states do not appear on this surface.\nWe use the simple tight-binding model [Eq. (S.14)]. This slab has a finite thickness in the z-direction and has periodic boundary conditions in the x- and y-directions. Let us introduce hoppings between the top surface and the bottom surface of the slab, and then we replace this hopping parameter tAB as \u03bbtAB with \u03bb being a real parameter. When \u03bb = 0, this system is just a slab geometry. On the other hand, when \u03bb = 1, this system is equal to a bulk crystal because it has the periodic boundary condition in the x, y, and z-directions. Let H (001) slab (\u03bb) denote the Hamiltonian with such geometry. Supplementary Figs. 6 (a) and 6(b) show band structures of H (001) slab (\u03bb) with \u03bb = 1 and \u03bb = 0, respectively. From this result, we confirm that the topological gapless states do not appear on the (001) surface. The surface energy of the Hamiltonian H (001) slab (\u03bb) can be expressed as\nE (001) surf =\nN\u2211\nn=1\nE (001) slab,n|\u03bb=0 \u2212 E (001) slab,n|\u03bb=1\n2Sslab , (S.23)\nwhere E (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab,n |\u03bb is the energy from the n-th lowest band of H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb), N is the total number of occupied bands, and Sslab represents the area of the slab surface of H (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) slab (\u03bb). Dependence of the surface energies, E (001) surf on tAB with the parameters t1 = t2 = t3 = m = 1 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6(c), and it shows that E (001) surf increases as tAB increases. This result supports that the surface energies without the topological surface states is largely related to the strength of the chemical bonds.\nSupplemental Material No. 3. WILSON LOOP APPROACH FOR DIAGNOSING TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS\nA. Wilson loop matrix and its eigenvalues\nHere we review the Wilson loop approach for calculations of the topological invariant based on Refs. [15\u201318] and calculate the Wilson loop for our model. First of all, we introduce the notations of tight-binding model for calculations of the Wilson loop eigenvalues and diagnosing topological invariants. We start from the tight-binding orbitals \u03c6R\u03b1(r) = \u03d5\u03b1(r\u2212R\u2212 r\u03b1) in the unit cell indexed by the lattice vector R, where r\u03b1 denotes the positions of the sites in the unit cell. By the Fourier transformations, the wave function is given by |\u03c7\u03b1(k)\u3009 = \u2211 R e ik\u00b7(R+r\u03b1) |\u03c6R\u03b1\u3009 / \u221a Nu, where Nu is the number of unit cells. A Hamiltonian H\u0302 can be expressed as the Hamiltonian matrix in terms of these wave functions, [H\u0302(k)]\u03b1\u03b2 = \u3008\u03c7\u03b1(k)| H\u0302 |\u03c7\u03b2(k)\u3009 , where this Hamiltonian has eigenstates defined as |un(k)\u3009. Under a\n11\ntranslation of a reciprocal lattice vector G in the k-space, this Hamiltonian matrix transforms as\nH\u0302(k + G) = V\u0302 \u22121(G)H\u0302(k)V\u0302 (G), (S.24)\nwhere the matrix representation of V\u0302 (G) with the basis of [H\u0302(k)]\u03b1\u03b2 is given by [V (G)]\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2eiG\u00b7r\u03b1 . Therefore, the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian at the k + G point in the k-space can be written as\n|un(k + G)\u3009 = V\u0302 (G)\u22121 |un(k)\u3009 . (S.25)\nNext, we discuss the methods of calculations of the Wilson loops. We can diagnose the topological invariant in a TCI with nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries [17\u201319] by tracking the evolution of Wannier function centers. Here we consider a 3D crystal with mutually orthogonal crystal axes. The spectrum of the Wannier function centers along the x-direction is obtained by diagonalizing a x-directed Wilson loop matrix [15, 16, 18] defined by\n[W(kx0, ky, kz)]nm\n\u2261 [ P exp ( i \u222b kx0+2\u03c0\nkx0\ndkxAx(kx, ky, kz) )]\nnm\n, (S.26)\nwhere Ax(k) is a non-Abelian Berry connection [Ax(k)]nm = i \u3008un(k)| \u2202x |um(k)\u3009, |un(k)\u3009 is the periodic part of the Bloch wave function, and P denotes the path-ordered operation. By using a discrete form of Ax(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz), we obtain the following equation:\n[ exp ( i 2\u03c0\nN Ax(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz)\n)]\nnm\n\u2248\u03b4nm + i 2\u03c0\nN\n[ Ax(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz) ]\nnm \u2248\u03b4nm \u2212 \u3008un(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz)| ( |um(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz)\u3009 \u2212 |um(kx0 + 2\u03c0(j\u22121) N , ky, kz)\u3009 ) = \u3008un ( kx0 + 2\u03c0j N , ky, kz ) |um(kx0 + 2\u03c0(j\u22121)N , ky, kz)\u3009 . (S.27)\nBy rewriting dkx as dkx = 2\u03c0/N with dkx 2\u03c0 (N is a large integer) and using Eq. (S.27), the discrete form of the Wilson loop matrix can be expressed as\n[W(kx0, ky, kz)]nm \u2248 [ P N\u220f\nj=1\nexp ( i 2\u03c0\nN Ax(kx0 + 2\u03c0jN , ky, kz)\n)]\nnm\n\u2248 \u3008un(kx0 + 2\u03c0, ky, kz)| ( P N\u22121\u220f\nj=1\nP\u0302 (kx0 + 2\u03c0j N , ky, kz) ) |um(kx0, ky, kz)\u3009\n= \u3008un(kx0, ky, kz)| V\u0302 (2\u03c0x\u0302) ( P N\u22121\u220f\nj=1\nP\u0302 (kx0 + 2\u03c0j N , ky, kz) ) |um(kx0, ky, kz)\u3009 , (S.28)\nwhere P\u0302 (k) is the projection operator onto the occupied states defined by\nP\u0302 (k) =\nnocc\u2211\nn\n|un(k)\u3009 \u3008un(k)| . (S.29)\nThe Wilson loop matrix of Eq. (S.28) is a U(nocc) unitary matrix, and the eigenvalues of Eq. (S.28) are gauge invariant. We label the eigenvalues of the Wilson loop matrixW(kx0, ky, kz) by exp[i\u03b8n(ky, kz)] with n = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , nocc. The phase \u03b8n(ky, kz) gives us Wannier centers of the occupied bands.\nWe calculate the spectra of the x-directed Wilson loop matrix in the tight-binding model of Eq. (S.14) [Supplementary Fig. 7]. If the change of the phase \u03b8n through the change of ky is nonzero, the system is topological. The bulk closes when with t1 = t2 = t3 = 1, tAB = 0.5, and 1.5 \u2264 m \u2264 2.5. When 0.5 \u2264 m < 1.5, the Wilson loop spectra wind in the change of ky from zero to 2\u03c0 [Supplementary Fig. 7(a-c)]. On the other hand, the Wilson loop spectra with m > 2.5 are trivial [Supplementary Fig. 7(e-f)]. From these results, we conclude that the topological phase transition occurs in changing the parameter m.\n12\n(d)\n(b)(a)\n(c)\n(f)(e)\nSupplementary Fig. 7.

Topological invariant for glide-symmetric TCI\nHere we review a topological invariant for the 3D TCI protected by glide Gy = {My|00 12} symmetry introduced in the previous work [20]. In the following, we show that this topological invariant can be calculated from the Wilson loop spectra based on the discussions in this previous work. Let us consider a spinful 3D insulator with time-reversal (T ) symmetry\nT H(k)T \u22121 = H(\u2212k), T 2 = \u22121. (S.30)\n13\nNext, we define the Berry connections as\nAj(k) = i\nnocc\u2211\nn\n\u3008un(k)| \u2202kj |un(k)\u3009 , (S.31)\nA\u00b1,j(k) = i nocc\u2211\nn\n\u3008u(\u00b1)n (k)| \u2202kj |u(\u00b1)n (k)\u3009 , (S.32)\nwith j = x, y, z, where the subscript \u00b1 represents the glide sector of the glide eigenvalues \u00b1ie\u2212ikz/2, and we define the Berry curvatures as\nFij(k) = \u2202kiAj(k)\u2212 \u2202kjAi(k), (S.33) F\u00b1,ij(k) = \u2202kiA\u00b1,j(k)\u2212 \u2202kjA\u00b1,i(k). (S.34)\nAccording to Ref. [20], the Z4 topological invariant for the T -symmetric TCI is given by\n\u03bd \u2261 2 \u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkx\n( AI+,x(kx, \u03c0, \u03c0)\u2212AI+,x(kx, 0, \u03c0) )\n+ 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndkz\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkx\n( F+,xz(kx, \u03c0, kz)\u2212 F+,xz(kx, 0, kz) )\n+ 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndky\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxFxy(kx, ky, 0) mod 4, (S.35)\nwhere the subscript I of AI+,j(k) indicates the first occupied states of Kramers pairs [|uIn(k)\u3009 , |uIIn (k)\u3009]. \u03bd = 0 indicates that a given insulator is trivial, \u03bd = 1, 3 indicates that the insulator is a strong Z2 TI, and \u03bd = 2 indicates that the insulator is the TCI protected by Gy symmetry.\nIn the following, we discuss how to calculate this topological invariant from the spectra of the Wilson loop matrix. The third term in the right-hand side of Eq. (S.35) can be rewritten as\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndkz\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxF+,xz(kx, \u03c0, kz)\n=\u2212 1 \u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA+,x(kx, \u03c0, \u03c0) +\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA+,x(kx, \u03c0, 0) + 2M\n+ M\u0304Y\u0304 , (S.36)\nwhere M+ M\u0304Y\u0304\nis the winding number of the Wilson loop spectra along the M\u0304 -Y\u0304 line in the + glide sector. In addition, on the (ky, kz) = (\u03c0, \u03c0) line, T maps the occupied states in the + glide sector to itself. The first and second occupied states of a Kramers pair have the + glide sector: [|u(+)In (kx, \u03c0, \u03c0)\u3009 , |u(+)IIn (kx, \u03c0, \u03c0)\u3009]. Thus, we obtain the following equation:\n\u2212 1 \u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA+,x(kx, \u03c0, \u03c0) = \u2212\n2\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI +,x(kx, \u03c0, \u03c0). (S.37)\nOn the other hand, the glide eigenvalue of occupied states is given by \u00b1i on the (ky, kz) = (\u03c0, 0) line, and the glide sectors exchange under T . Thus, under T , an occupied state |u(+)n (kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009 in the + glide sector transforms into a Kramers pair |u(\u2212)n (kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009 in the \u2212 glide sector. We can rewrite a Kramers pair as [|uIn(kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009 , |uIIn (kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009] = [|u(+)n (kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009 , |u(\u2212)n (kx, \u03c0, 0)\u3009]. Thus, the second term in the last line in Eq. (S.36) can be written as\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA+,x(kx, \u03c0, 0) =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI +,x(kx, \u03c0, 0). (S.38)\nBy combining Eqs. (S.36), (S.37), and (S.38), we obtain\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndkz\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxF+,xz(kx, \u03c0, kz) = \u2212\n2\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI +,x(kx, \u03c0, \u03c0) +\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI +,x(kx, \u03c0, 0) + 2M + M\u0304Y\u0304 . (S.39)\nSimilarly, we can rewrite the fourth and the fifth terms of the right-hand side in Eq. (S.35) as\n\u2212 1 \u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndkz\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxF+,xz(kx, 0, kz) =\n2\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI x(kx, 0, \u03c0)\u2212\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxA\nI x(kx, 0, 0) + 2M + \u0393\u0304Z\u0304 , (S.40)\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndky\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxFxy(kx, ky, 0) = \u2212\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxAx(kx, \u03c0, 0) +\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxAx(kx, 0, 0) +MY\u0304 \u0393\u0304, (S.41)\n14\nrespectively, where M\u0393\u0304Z\u0304 is the winding number of the Wilson loop spectra along the \u0393\u0304-Z\u0304 line in the + glide sector. Furthermore, MY\u0304 \u0393\u0304 is the winding number of the Wilson loop spectra of all occupied bands along the Y\u0304 -\u0393\u0304 line. By substituting Eqs. (S.39), (S.40), and (S.41) into Eq. (S.35), we get\n\u03bd \u2261 2M+ M\u0304Y\u0304 + 2M+ \u0393\u0304Z\u0304 +MY\u0304 \u0393\u0304 mod 4. (S.42)\nThus, we can calculate the Z4 topological invariant \u03bd from the Wilson loop spectra along the M\u0304 -Y\u0304 , \u0393\u0304-Z\u0304, and Y\u0304 -\u0393\u0304 lines. This result agrees with the method introduced in Ref. [18] for calculating the topological invariant for the TCI from the Wilson loop spectra.\nFrom the spectra of the x-directed Wilson loop in Supplementary Fig. 7, we can calculate the Z4 topological invariant \u03bd of the tight-binding model of Eq. (S.14). We confirmed that by calculating the spectra of the x-directed Wilson loops, they do not wind along the M\u0304 -Y\u0304 and \u0393\u0304-Z\u0304 lines, which leads to M+\nM\u0304Y\u0304 = 0 and M+ \u0393\u0304Z\u0304 = 0 in this model.\nThus, the Wilson loop spectra along the Y\u0304 -\u0393\u0304 line determine \u03bd. Supplementary Figs. 7(a-c) show that the doubly degenerate spectra wind by 2\u03c0, and therefore it follows that MY\u0304 \u0393\u0304 \u2261 2 mod 4, namely, \u03bd \u2261 2 mod 4 in these cases. These results show that our model with these parameters is the TCI protected by Gy symmetry."

Tight-binding model\nHere, we discuss surface states of a magnetic TCI protected by glide symmetry to confirm that our theory of the non-magnetic TCI in the main text can be applied to the magnetic TCI. For this purpose, we construct a 3D tightbinding model of the TCI in the space group No. 13 (P2/c). We start from a 2D tight-binding model of a Chern insulator [21] on a square lattice with two sublattices at y = 14 and y = 3 4 in the unit cell [see Supplementary Fig. 8(a)]:\nHChern;A =\u2212 \u2211\nj=1,2\n\u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z t\n[ c\u2020Aj(x+ 1, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) (\u03c33 + i\u03c31 2 ) cAj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) + h.c. ]\n\u2212 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z t\n[ c\u2020A2(x, y + 3 4 , z) (\u03c33 + i\u03c32 2 ) cA1(x, y + 1 4 , z)\n+ c\u2020A1(x, y + 5 4 , z) (\u03c33 + i\u03c32 2 ) cA2(x, y + 3 4 , z) + h.c.\n]\n+ \u2211\nj=1,2\n\u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ mc\u2020Aj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z)\u03c33cAj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) ] , (S.43)\nwhere c\u2020Aj(x, y, z) is a creation operators at the (x, y, z) site within the layers A with j-sublattice (j = 1, 2). This Hamiltonian has four basis states spanned by \u03c33 = \u00b1 and sublattices A1/A2. The coordinate (x, y, z) runs over the square lattice sites, and we set the lattice constant to 1.\nWe construct the 3D tight-binding model from this 2D Chern insulator [8, 9]. This Chern insulator is located at z = n plane (n \u2208 Z) in real space. In the space group No. 13, the symmetry generators are given by\nG\u0302y = {My|00 12}, I\u0302 = {I|000}, (S.44)\nwhere My represents the mirror reflection with respect to the xz plane. Under G\u0302y and I\u0302, the creation operator c\u2020(x, y, z) transforms as\nI\u0302 : c\u2020\u03b1(x, y, z)\u2192 c\u2020\u03b2(\u2212x,\u2212y,\u2212z)[I]\u03b2\u03b1 with I = \u03c41\u03c33, (S.45) G\u0302y : c \u2020 \u03b1(x, y, z)\u2192 c\u2020\u03b2(x,\u2212y, z + 12 )[My]\u03b2\u03b1 with My = \u03c40, (S.46)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 run over the basis of Eq. (S.43), \u03c4i (i = 1, 2, 3) is Pauli matrix corresponding to A1/A2 sublattices, and \u03c40 is the 2\u00d7 2 identity matrix.\n15\nSupplementary Fig. 8. (a) 2D Chern insulator layer A at z = 0 and 2D Chern insulator layer B at z = 1/2 in the unit cell. The layer construction from these layers has the Gy symmetry. (b) The bulk Brillouin zone and the (100) surface Brillouin zone.\nNow, we design the system to be invariant under the glide G\u0302y symmetry. By making copies of the layers of HChern;A by the G\u0302y transformation, we obtain the layers B:\nG\u0302y : HChern;A \u2192 HChern;B \u2261\u2212 \u2211\nj=1,2\n\u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z t\n[ c\u2020Bj(x+ 1, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) (\u03c33 + i\u03c31 2 ) cBj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) + h.c. ]\n\u2212 \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z t\n[ c\u2020B2(x, y + 3 4 , z + 1 2 ) (\u03c33 \u2212 i\u03c32\n2\n) cB1(x, y + 1 4 , z + 1 2 )\n+ c\u2020B1(x, y + 5 4 , z + 1 2 ) (\u03c33 \u2212 i\u03c32\n2\n) cB2(x, y + 3 4 , z + 1 2 ) + h.c.\n]\n+ \u2211\nj=1,2\n\u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\n[ mc\u2020Bj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z)\u03c33cBj(x, y + 2j\u22121 4 , z) ] , (S.47)\nwhere c\u2020Bj(x, y, z) is the creation operators at the layer B. Next, we introduce an interlayer hopping between the A and B layers. Thus, we obtain the overall Hamiltonian of the magnetic TCI\nHMTCI = HChern;A +HChern;B +H \u2032 AB , (S.48)\nwhere H \u2032AB denotes the Hamiltonian of the interlayer couplings given by\nH \u2032AB = \u2211\nx,y,z\u2208Z\ntAB 2\n[ c\u2020A1(x, y + 1 4 , z)cB1(x, y + 1 4 , z + 1 2 ) + c \u2020 A2(x, y + 3 4 , z + 1)cB2(x, y + 3 4 , z + 1 2 ) + h.c. ] . (S.49)\nThis interlayer coupling H \u2032AB breaks the mirror M\u0302z symmetry. In this way, through the layer construction with 2D Chern insulators, we obtain the Hamiltonian of the magnetic TCI protected by Gy symmetry.\nNext, to obtain the Bloch Hamiltonian, we introduce the Fourier transformations c\u2020\u03b1(k) = \u2211 R e ik\u00b7(R+r\u03b1)c\u2020\u03b1(R +\nr\u03b1)/ \u221a N , where N is the number of unit cells, \u03b1 runs over eight basis states spanned by \u03c33 = \u00b1, A/B sublattices, and X1/X2 (X = A,B), r\u03b1 denotes the positions of the sites in the unit cell, and R = (x, y, z) is the position of the unit cell with x, y, z \u2208 Z. Thus, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonian of HMTCI\nHMTCI(k) =(m\u2212 t cos kx)\u03c33 \u2212 t sin kx\u03c31 \u2212 t cos ky2 \u03c41\u03c33 \u2212 t sin ky 2 \u00b53\u03c41\u03c32 +H\u2032AB(kz) (S.50)\nwhere \u03c40 and \u00b50 are the 2\u00d72 identity matrices, \u00b5i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Puli matrices corresponding to the A/B sublattices, and \u03c4i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices corresponding to the X1/X2 (X = A,B) sublattices.

(S.50). The Hamiltonian HMTCI(k) has Gy symmetry and I symmetry:\nGy(kz)HMTCI(kx, ky, kz)G\u22121y (kz) = HMTCI(kx,\u2212ky, kz), (S.55) IHMTCI(k)I\u22121 = HMTCI(\u2212k). (S.56)\nThe Gy matrix has the glide eigenvalues gy(kz) = \u00b1 exp ( \u2212ikz2 ) because G2y(kz) = exp (\u2212ikz).\nHere, the high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone in the bulk are given by {\u0393 = (0, 0, 0), Y = (\u03c0, 0, 0), Z = (0, \u03c0, 0), C = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0), B = (0, 0, \u03c0), A = (\u03c0, 0, \u03c0), D = (0, \u03c0, \u03c0), E = (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0)}, and the high-symmetry points in the (100) surface Brillouin zone are {\u0393\u0304 = (0, 0), Y\u0304 = (\u03c0, 0), Z\u0304 = (0, \u03c0), M\u0304 = (\u03c0, \u03c0)} [Figs. 8(b)]. The band structures of HMTCI(k) in the bulk are shown in Supplementary Figs. 9(a-1) and 9(b-1) for (t, tAB ,m) = (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 3), respectively, and those in the slab geometry with the (100) surface are shown in Supplementary Figs. 9(a-2) and 9(b-2), respectively. In Supplementary Fig. 9(a-2), the gapless surface states appear, while those do not appear in Supplementary Fig. 9(b-2). As we show in the following, the former case corresponds to the magnetic TCI phase protected by Gy symmetry, and the latter case corresponds to the trivial insulator phase.\n17\nSupplementary Fig. 10. The band structures of HMTCI(k) in the slab geometry with surfaces having various Miller indices (\u03b10\u03b3). They are calculated in a slab geometry with the system size along the x-direction Lx = 30. The parameters are t = m = tAB = 1. Here we set the Fermi energy to be zero. (a,c) When \u03b3 is odd, gapless states do not appear. (b,d) When \u03b3 is even, gapless states appear.\nB. Topological invariant for magnetic TCI protected by glide symmetry\nHere, we introduce a topological invariant for the magnetic TCI protected by Gy symmetry. According to Refs. [8, 22, 23], the Z2 topological invariant is given by\n\u03bd\u2032 = 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkx\n( A+,x(kx, 0, \u03c0)\u2212A\u2212,x(ky, \u03c0, \u03c0) )\n\u2212 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkx\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkz\n( F\u2212,xz(kx, 0, kz)\u2212 F+,xz(kx, \u03c0, kz) )\n\u2212 1 2\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ndky\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 dkxFxy(kx, ky, \u03c0) mod 2, (S.57)\nwhere Aj(k) and A\u00b1,j(k) (j = x, y, z) are the Berry connections defined as in Eqs. (S.31) and (S.32), respectively, and Fij(k) and F\u00b1,ij(k) (i, j = x, y, z) are the Berry curvatures given by Eqs. (S.33) and (S.34), respectively. We note that the formula (S.57) follows the definition in Ref. [8], which is different from the one in Refs. [22, 23] by the Chern number within the kx-kz plane. The two definitions are equal when we restrict ourselves to the cases with the Chern number being zero. By using the result in the previous works [8, 9], when I symmetry is preserved and the inversion center is in the glide plane, the Z2 topological invariant can be expressed as\n\u03bd\u2032 \u2261 1 2\n\u2211\n\u0393j\n( n+(\u0393j)\u2212 n\u2212(\u0393j) ) mod 2, (S.58)\nwhere n+(\u0393j) (n\u2212(\u0393j)) is the number of occupied states with even (odd) parity eigenvalues at the high-symmetry points \u0393j (=Y , Z, C, B, A, D, E) in the Brillouin zone. By applying this formula to our model HMTCI(k) having I symmetry, we obtain \u03bd\u2032 \u2261 1 mod 2 and \u03bd\u2032 \u2261 0 mod 2 for (t, tAB ,m) = (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 3), respectively, from\n18\nthe parity eigenvalues shown in Supplementary Figs. 9(a-3) and 9(b-3). Therefore, the former is the magnetic TCI protected by Gy symmetry, and the later is the trivial insulator.\nWe also calculate the spectra of the x-directed Wilson loop matrix [Supplementary Figs. 9(a-4) and 9(b-4)]. In Supplementary Fig. 9(a-4), the Wilson loop spectra along the \u0393\u0304-Y\u0304 lines in the k space wind by 2\u03c0. On the other hand, in Supplementary Fig. 9(b-4), the Wilson loop spectra do not wind. These results also show the above conclusion.\nC. Surface states of the MTCI\nNext, to see dependence of the topological surface states on the surface orientation, we calculate band structures in the slab geometry with various (\u03b10\u03b3) surfaces [Supplementary Fig. 10]. In Supplementary Figs. 10(a), 10(c), the gapless surface states do not appear because the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface is not glide symmetric when \u03b3 \u2261 1 mod 2. On the other hand, Supplementary Figs. 10(b) and 10(d) show that the gapless surface states appear because the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface is glide symmetric when \u03b3 \u2261 0 mod 2. From these results, we conclude that our theory on the dependence of the topological surface states on the surface orientations can also be applied to the MTCI protected by Gy symmetry.\nSupplemental Material No. 5. SECOND MODEL OF NONMAGNETIC TOPOLOGICAL CRYSTALLINE INSULATOR\nA. Tight-binding model\nHere we show details of the second model of the TCI H(2)TCI(k) in the main text. The method to construct this model is similar to that in Supplemental Material No. 2. We start from the following simple tight-binding model of a 3D TI on a primitive cubic lattice:\nH(A)3DTI(k) = ( \u2212m+ \u2211\nj=x,y,z\ntj cos kj ) \u03c43\u03c30 + vx sin kx\u03c41\u03c33 + vy sin ky\u03c41\u03c31 + vz sin kz\u03c41\u03c32. (S.59)\nThis model has I symmetry and T symmetry: IH(A)3DTII\u22121 = H (A) 3DTI(\u2212k), T H (A) 3DTIT \u22121 = H (A) 3DTI(\u2212k), where I = \u03c43, and T = \u2212i\u03c40\u03c32K with K being the complex conjugation. The Hamiltonian has four basis states spanned by \u03c43 = \u00b1, \u03c33 = \u00b1.\nNext, we consider a glide G\u0302y = {My|00 12} symmetry, where My represents the mirror reflection with respect to the xz plane. Under G\u0302y, the Hamiltonian H(A)3DTI(k) can be transformed into H (B) 3DTI(k):\nG\u0302y : H(A)3DTI(kx, ky, kz)\u2192 H (B) 3DTI(kx, ky, kz) = H (A) 3DTI(kx,\u2212ky, kz), (S.60)\nin a similar way to the discussion in Supplemental Material No. 2. By combining H(A)3DTI(k) and H (B) 3DTI(k), the Hamiltonian as the direct sum of these Hamiltonians is written as\nH(A)3DTI(k)\u2295H (B) 3DTI(k) =\n( \u2212m+ \u2211\nj=x,y,z\ntj cos kj ) \u00b50\u03c43\n+ vx sin kx\u00b50\u03c41\u03c33 + vy sin ky\u00b53\u03c41\u03c31 + vz sin kz\u00b50\u03c41\u03c32, (S.61)\nwhere \u00b5i (i = 1, 2, 3) are the Pauli matrices corresponding to the A/B sublattices, \u00b50 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix, the site of the A sublattice is (x, y, z) with x, y, z \u2208 Z, and the site of the B sublattice is (x, y, z + 12 ). We add the coupling term between A and B\nH(AB)(k) = ( vab1 + vab2 cos kx ) \u00b51\u03c41\u03c31 sin kz 2 (S.62)\nto H(A)3DTI(k)\u2295H (B) 3DTI(k). Thus, we obtain the following overall Hamiltonian:\nH(2)TCI(k) = H (A) 3DTI(k)\u2295H (B) 3DTI(k) +H(AB)(k). (S.63)\nHere, the Gy glide is given by Gy(kz) = \u2212i exp ( \u2212ikz2 ) \u00b51\u03c43\u03c32, and H(2)TCI(k) has Gy symmetry:\nGy(kz)H(2)TCI(kx, ky, kz)G\u22121y (kz) = H (2) TCI(kx,\u2212ky, kz).

The high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone in the bulk are given by {\u0393 = (0, 0, 0), Y = (\u03c0, 0, 0), Z = (0, \u03c0, 0), C = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0), B = (0, 0, \u03c0), A = (\u03c0, 0, \u03c0), D = (0, \u03c0, \u03c0), E = (\u03c0, \u03c0, \u03c0)}, and the high-symmetry points in the (100) surface Brillouin zone are {\u0393\u0304 = (0, 0), Y\u0304 = (\u03c0, 0), Z\u0304 = (0, \u03c0), M\u0304 = (\u03c0, \u03c0)}. In the calculations, we use two sets of parameter values (m, tx, ty, tz, vx, vy, vz, vab1, vab2) = (2, 1, 1, 1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2), (6, 1, 1, 1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2) in Supplementary Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. We calculate band structures of H(2)TCI(k) in the bulk [Supplementary Figs. 11(a-1) and 11(b-1)] and in the slab geometry with the(100) surface [Supplementary Figs. 11(a-2) and 11(b-2)]. In addition, Supplementary Figs. 11(a-3) and 11(b-3) show the Wilson loop spectra of the occupied states of H(2)TCI(k). The former shows that the doubly degenerate spectra wind along the \u0393\u0304-Y\u0304 line, and the spectra in the + glide sector along the M\u0304 -Y\u0304 and \u0393\u0304-Z\u0304 lines are not winding. From these results, we conclude that the Z4 topological invariant \u03bd [see Eq. (S.42)] is 2, and therefore Supplementary Fig. 11(a) corresponds to the TCI phase protected by Gy symmetry. On the other hand, Supplementary Fig. 11(b-3) shows that the Wilson loop spectra do not wind, namely, \u03bd = 0, and therefore Supplementary Fig. 11(b) corresponds to the trivial insulator.\nNext, to see the dependence of the topological surface states on the surface orientation, we calculate band structures in the slab geometry with various (\u03b10\u03b3) surfaces [Supplementary Fig. 12]. As we discuss in the main text, the nonsymmorphic property of Gy symmetry leads to the singular dependence of the surface states on the parity of \u03b3. On the (101), (201), (203) and (301) surfaces [Supplementary Figs. 12(a), 12(c), 12(d), and 12(e)], the gapless surface states do not appear because the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface is not glide symmetric when \u03b3 \u2261 1 mod 2. On the other hand, on the (102) and (302) surfaces [Supplementary Figs. 12(b) and 12(f)], the gapless surface states appear because the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface is glide symmetric when \u03b3 \u2261 0 mod 2. From these results, we conclude that the topological surface states in the second model of the TCI H(2)TCI(k) have a similar dependence on the surface orientation to the first model of the TCI H(1)TCI(k) in the main text.\n21\nC. Correspondence between hopping and fitting parameters\nIn this section, we discuss correspondence between the hoppings of H(2)TCI(k) and the fitting parameters \u2206x, \u2206z, \u2206xz of the trial function F (\u03b8) to fit the surface energy in the main text. \u2206x, \u2206z, and \u2206xz correspond to the strength of the hopping parameters in the [100], [001], and [201] directions, respectively, as we discuss in Supplemental Material No. 6. In our calculation on the two cases of the trivial insulator and the TCI, we used the same hopping parameters ti, vi and vabj of H(2)TCI(k) in the [100], [001], and [201] directions, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 13(a). These hopping parameters along various directions are of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the fitting parameters \u2206x, \u2206z and \u2206xz, which physically correspond to the strengths of bondings along various directions, are expected to have the similar size. It is indeed the case in the trivial insulator [Supplementary Fig. 13(b)]. On the other hand, in the case of the TCI, such a feature does not appear [Supplementary Fig. 13(c)] although we do not change the parameters of the hopping in the x and z directions. \u2206xz compared to \u2206x and \u2206z becomes much smaller compared to that of the trivial insulator. This unphysical behavior disappears in the case of the TCI without the SETS, and the ratios between the values of \u2206x, \u2206z, and \u2206xz are close to the trivial insulator, compared to the TCI [Supplementary\n22\nSupplemental Material No. 6. SURFACE ENERGY FROM CHEMICAL BONDS\nIn this section, we derive the trial function F (\u03b8) for the surface energy from the analysis in terms of the numbers of broken bonds between the atoms when creating a surface from a bulk crystal. For this purpose, we consider a 3D network of atoms connected by bonds, which corresponds to the tight-binding models in this paper. The atoms in the netwrok are on an orthorhombic lattice with Gy = {My|00 12} symmetry, where we set the lattice constants to 1. The atoms are located at (x, y, z) (A sublattice) and at (x, y, z + 1/2) (B sublattice) with x, y, z \u2208 Z. We call the atomic layers at z = n and at z = n+1/2 (n \u2208 Z) A and B layers, respectively. The system has nearest-neighbor bonds along the x-, the y-, and the z-directions and next-nearest-neighbor bonds along the ~r = (1, 0,\u00b11/2), (\u22121, 0,\u00b11/2) directions between the atoms. In the following, we discuss the surface energy of the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface to derive the function F (\u03b8) of the surface energy in the main text. On the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface, the size of the unit cell along the x-direction is \u2206x = \u03b3 and that along the z-direction is \u2206z = \u03b1 [Supplementary Fig. 14].\nFirst, we consider the nearest-neighbor bonds. When making the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface from a bulk crystal, 2\u03b1 bonds between the atoms along the x-directions are broken, and \u03b3 bonds along the z-directions are broken [Supplementary Figs. 14(a) and 14(b)]. Let the energy per a chemical bond along the x-direction and that along the z-direction be \u03b4x and \u03b4z, respectively. Thus, the surface energy from the nearest-neighbor bonds for the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface can be expressed as\nF (1)(\u03b8) = \u03b4x 2 \u00d7 2\u03b1 Scell + \u03b4z 2 \u00d7 \u03b3 Scell\n=\u03b4x cos \u03b8 + \u03b4z 2 sin \u03b8, (S.70)\nwhere \u03b8 is an angle satisfying tan \u03b8 = \u03b3/\u03b1, and Scell = \u221a \u03b12 + \u03b32 is the area of the unit cell. The reason \u03b4i (i = x, z) is multiplied by 1/2 is that the process of cutting the bonds from the bulk result in appearance of two surfaces.\n\u0394z=3\n(b) \u0394x=7\nA B A B A B A\n(307) surface\n\u0394z=3\n(a) \u0394x=5\nA B A B A B A\n(305) surface\nz\nx\nz\nx\nA\nUnit cell \u00d7 2\u0394z \u00d7 \u0394x\nNearest-neighbor bonds\n\u00d7 4\u0394z-1\nNext-nearestneighbor bonds\nUnit cell \u00d7 2\u0394z \u00d7 \u0394x\nNearest-neighbor bonds\n\u00d7 2\u0394x-1 \u00d7 1\nNext-nearestneighbor bonds\nB\n\u00d7 1\nB\nSupplementary Fig. 14.

(a) The configuration of the steps for the (305) surface with \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1. (b) The configuration of the steps for the (307) surface with 2\u03b1 < \u03b3. In both cases, the numbers of nearest-neighbor bonds along the x- and the z-directions cut by the surface are 2\u2206z and \u2206x, respectively. The total numbers of next-nearest-neighbor bonds cut by the surface are given by 4\u2206z in (a) and 2\u2206x in (b), respectively.\n23\nNext, we discuss the surface energy from the next-nearest-neighbor bonds. Let us define the energy per a nextnearest-neighbor bond as \u03b4xz. In this case, we need to consider the following two cases: (i) \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1 and (ii) 2\u03b1 < \u03b3. In the case of (i), when making the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface from a bulk crystal, the number of broken next-nearest-neighbor bonds is 4\u2206z = 4\u03b1 [Supplementary Fig. 14(a)]. Thus, the surface energy from the next-nearest-neighbor bonds can be expressed as\nF (2)(\u03b8) = \u03b4xz 2 \u00d7 4\u03b1 Scell = 2\u03b4xz cos \u03b8 (\u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1). (S.71)\nMeanwhile, in the case of (ii) 2\u03b1 < \u03b3, when making the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface from a bulk crystal, the number of broken next-nearest-neighbor bonds is 2\u2206x = 2\u03b3 [Supplementary Fig. 14(b)]. In this case, the surface energy from the next-nearest-neighbor bonds is given by\nF (2)(\u03b8) = \u03b4xz 2 \u00d7 2\u03b3 Scell = \u03b4xz sin \u03b8 (2\u03b1 < \u03b3). (S.72)\nFurthermore, Eqs. (S.71) and (S.72) can be rewritten in a unified from as follows:\nF (2)(\u03b8) =\n\u221a 5\n2 \u03b4xz\n( sin |\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8102|+ sin |\u03b8 + \u03b8102| ) , (S.73)\nwhere \u03b8102 is the angle satisfying cos \u03b8102 = 1/ \u221a 5 and sin \u03b8102 = 2/ \u221a\n5. Thus, the total surface energy from the chemical bonds is given by\nF (\u03b8) = F (1)(\u03b8) + F (2)(\u03b8), (S.74)\nand this function is the trial function F (\u03b8) for the surface energy from chemical bonds in the main text.\nSupplemental Material No. 7. SURFACE THEORY OF THE TOPOLOGICAL CRYSTALLINE INSULATORS PROTECTED BY NONSYMMORPHIC SYMMETRY\nA. Effective surface theory from layer construction\nTo construct a surface theory of the TCI, we use layer constructions [7\u201310]. Here we introduce 2D topological insulator layers, which are periodically located and decoupled. This layer construction consists of two kinds of layers LA and LB [Supplementary Fig. 15]. We introduce weak inter-layer couplings without closing gap, where the interlayer couplings preserve the glide Gy symmetry. In the following, in order to study surface states as the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface, we consider the helical edge modes along the y-axis from the layers LA and LB and their hybridization. Then the effective Hamiltonians describing the helical edge states for the layers LA and LB can be written as HA = vky\u03c31, HB = \u2212HA, and \u03c3j (j = 1, 2, 3) is Pauli matrices. We consider (\u03b10\u03b3) surfaces with \u03b3 = 1, 2 in order to see the difference between a Gy-symmetric (\u03b3 = 2) case [Supplementary Fig. 15(a)] and a Gy-asymmetric (\u03b3 = 1) case [Supplementary Fig. 15(b)]. In the case with \u03b3 = 2, the effective Hamiltonian in the matrix representation can be expressed as\nH(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (ky) =   HA H\u03b4 H\u2020\u03b4 HB . . .\n. . . . . .

(S.76)\nFirst, we consider the case with \u03b3 = 2. Let \u03c8\u03b1 denote an eigenstate satisfying\nH(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (ky)\u03c8\u03b1(ky) = E(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 \u03c8\u03b1(ky), (S.77) with \u03c8\u03b1(ky) = (\u03c8A1\u2191, \u03c8A1\u2193, \u03c8B2\u2191, \u03c8B2\u2193, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8A2j\u22121\u2191, \u03c8A2j\u22121\u2193, \u03c8B2j\u2191, \u03c8B2j\u2193, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8A\u03b1\u2191, \u03c8A\u03b1\u2193)T . We write the eigenstate as \u03c8A2j\u22121\u2191 = \u03c6A\u2191 sin ( (2j \u2212 1)k ) , \u03c8A2j\u22121\u2193 = \u03c6A\u2193 sin ( (2j \u2212 1)k ) , \u03c8B2j\u2191 = \u03c6B\u2191 sin(2jk), \u03c8B2j\u2193 = \u03c6B\u2193 sin(2jk). By substituting this eigenstate into Eq. (S.77), we can obtain the following equations:\nvky\u03c6A\u2193 + 2\u03b4\u03c6B\u2191 cos k = E (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 \u03c6A\u2191,\nvky\u03c6A\u2191 + 2\u03b4\u03c6B\u2193 cos k = E (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 \u03c6A\u2193,\n2\u03b4\u03c6A\u2191 cos k \u2212 vky\u03c6B\u2193 = E(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 \u03c6B\u2191, 2\u03b4\u03c6A\u2193 cos k \u2212 vky\u03c6B\u2191 = E(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 \u03c6B\u2193. (S.78)\n25\nTherefore, by solving these coupled equations, we can obtain the eigenvalue\nE(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 = \u00b1 \u221a v2k2y + 4\u03b4 2 cos2 k. (S.79)\nFrom the boundary condition, we obtain\nk = \u03c0n\n\u03b1+ 1 , n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\u03b1+ 1)/2. (S.80)\nTherefore, the eigenvalue is written as E (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 = \u00b1 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n))2, where m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n) is a Dirac mass term given by\nm(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (n) = 2\u03b4 cos\n( \u03c0n\n\u03b1+ 1\n) , (S.81)\nand n runs over n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\u03b1 + 1)/2. When \u03b3 = 1, in a similar way, we can obtain the eigenvalue E(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 of the Hamiltonian H(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 (k) as E(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 = \u00b1 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=1) \u03b1 (n))2, where\nm(\u03b3=1)\u03b1 (n) = 2\u03b4 cos\n( \u03c0n\n2\u03b1+ 1\n) , (S.82)\nwith n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b1. The difference between Eq. (S.81) and Eq. (S.82) comes from the different boundary conditions. For the Hamiltonian H(\u03b3=2)\u03b1 (k), the bands with n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)/2 are doubly degenerate. On the other hand, the band with n = (\u03b1 + 1)/2 is not degenerate at ky 6= 0, and these bands are gapless. Let 2\u2206 denote the bulk gap, and we assume that the surface energy can be determined by the bands in the k-space with \u2212\u2206/v \u2264 ky < \u2206/v and \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 kz < \u03c0. Here, the energy is independent of kz because the gapless states are due to the modes along the edges of the xy layers. Therefore, the total energy with \u03b3 = 2 can be expressed as\nE (\u03b3=2) Dirac,\u03b1 =\nv\n2\u2206\n\u222b \u2206 v\n\u2212\u2206v dky\n[ \u2212v|ky|+ \u2206 + 2 \u03b1\u22121 2\u2211\nn=1\n( \u2212 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=2) \u03b1 (n))2 + \u2206 )] , (S.83)\nwhere the energy is measured from \u2212\u2206. On the other hand, when \u03b3 = 1, all the bands are doubly degenerate, and gapless states do not appear. Therefore, the surface energy in the unit cell can be written as\nE (\u03b3=1) Dirac,\u03b1 =\nv\n\u2206\n\u03b1\u2211\nn=1\n\u222b \u2206 v\n\u2212\u2206v dky\n[ \u2212 \u221a v2k2y + (m (\u03b3=1) \u03b1 (n))2 + \u2206 ] . (S.84)\nFrom these surface energies E (\u03b3=1) Dirac,\u03b1 and E (\u03b3=2) Dirac,\u03b1, we can obtain the surface energy for the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface with \u03b3 = 1, 2 per unit area as follows:\nE (\u03b10\u03b3) Dirac =\n{ 2E\n(\u03b3=2) Dirac /Scell (\u03b3 = 2)\nE (\u03b3=1) Dirac /Scell (\u03b3 = 1),\n(S.85)\nwhere Scell is the area of the surface in the unit cell.\nB. Effective surface theory with \u03b3 6= 1, 2\nIn the above discussion, we study the effective surface theory on the (\u03b10\u03b3) surfaces with \u03b3 = 1, 2. Next, we consider the cases with \u03b3 6= 1, 2. We construct the surface theory on the (\u03b10\u03b3) surfaces with \u03b3 6= 1, 2 by combining the cases with \u03b3 = 1, 2. Here atoms occupy all the positions (x, y, z) and (x, y, z+1/2) with x, y, z \u2208 Z below the plane n \u00b7r = 0, where n = (\u03b1/ \u221a \u03b12 + \u03b32, 0, \u03b3/ \u221a \u03b12 + \u03b32)T and r = (x, y, z)T . Here, we set the origin being on this plane. To obtain the surface energy E (\u03b10\u03b3) Dirac , we need to consider the following two cases: (i) \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1 and (ii) 2\u03b1 < \u03b3.\nFirst, we consider (i) \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1 case. In this case, any distance between the adjacent steps in the x direction is Dx = 1 [Supplementary Figs. 16(a-c)]. Because the inclination of the plane n \u00b7 r = 0 is \u2212\u03b1/\u03b3 (\u2264 \u22121/2) and Dx = 1, the distances between the adjacent steps in the z direction are Nz/2 or (Nz + 1)/2, where Nz is an integer satisfying\n26\n\u0394z=5\n(b) \u0394x=4\nA B A B A B A B A B A B A B\n(504) surface\nz\nx\n\u0394z=5\n(a) \u0394x=3\nA B A B A B A B A B A B A B\n(503) surface\n\u0394z=3\n(d) \u0394x=7\nA B A B A B A B\n(307) surface\n\u0394z=3\n(c) \u0394x=5\nA B A B A B A B\n(305) surface\nz\nx\nz\nx\nz\nx\nA\nUnit cell\nD = 1x D = 1x\nD = 1x D = 1/2z\nSupplementary Fig. 16.

All the distances between the adjacent steps in the x direction are Dx = 1. (d) An example of the configuration of the steps with 2\u03b1 < \u03b3. All the distances between the adjacent steps in the z direction are Dz = 1/2.\nNz/2 \u2264 \u03b1/\u03b3 < (Nz + 1)/2. Let N1 and N2 denote the number of steps with the interval Dz = Nz/2 in the z direction and that with the interval Dz = (Nz + 1)/2, respectively. The surface in the unit cell has N1 steps with Dz = Nz/2 and N2 steps with Dz = (Nz + 1)/2. When Nz is an even number, the energy of the steps with Dz = Nz/2 can be expressed as E (\u03b3=1) Dirac,\u03b1=Nz/2 , and the energy of the steps with Dz = (Nz + 1)/2 is obtained by E (\u03b3=2) Dirac,\u03b1=Nz+1 . In this case, the surface energy per unit area can be expressed as follows:\nE (\u03b10\u03b3) Dirac =\n1\nScell\n[ N1E (\u03b3=1)\nDirac,Nz2 +N2E\n(\u03b3=2) Dirac,Nz+1 ] (Nz \u2261 0 mod 2, \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1). (S.86)\nOn the other hand, when Nz is an odd number, the energy of the steps with Dz = Nz/2 can be expressed as E (\u03b3=2) Dirac,\u03b1=Nz , and the energy of the steps with Dz = (Nz + 1)/2 is given by E (\u03b3=1) Dirac,\u03b1=(Nz+1)/2 . In this case, we can write the surface energy as\nE (\u03b10\u03b3) Dirac =\n1\nScell\n[ N1E (\u03b3=2) Dirac,Nz +N2E (\u03b3=1)\nDirac,Nz+12\n] (Nz \u2261 1 mod 2, \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1), (S.87)\nwhere Scell = \u221a \u03b12 + \u03b32 is the area of the unit cell. Because the sum of the intervals Dx of the steps in the unit cell is \u03b3, we get N1 +N2 = \u03b3. In addition, from the similar condition in the z direction, we can obtain Nz 2 N1 + Nz+1 2 N2 = \u03b1. Thus, N1 and N2 are given by\nN1 = \u03b3(Nz + 1)\u2212 2\u03b1, (S.88) N2 = 2\u03b1\u2212Nz\u03b3, (S.89)\nrespectively.\n27\nNext, we consider the case of (ii) 2\u03b1 < \u03b3 [Supplementary Fig. 16(d)]. In this case, any distance between the adjacent steps in the z direction is Dz = 1/2 because of the inclination \u2212\u03b1/\u03b3 (> \u22121/2). The number of steps in the unit cell is 2\u03b1, and the energy of each step is E\n(\u03b3=2) Dirac,1. Therefore, the surface energy per unit area is given by\nE (\u03b10\u03b3) Dirac =\n2\u03b1\nScell E\n(\u03b3=2) Dirac,1 (2\u03b1 < \u03b3). (S.90)\nThus, in both (i) \u03b3 \u2264 2\u03b1 and (ii) 2\u03b1 < \u03b3 cases, we can obtain the surface energy on the (\u03b10\u03b3) surface when \u03b3 6= 1, 2 by combining the surface energy with \u03b3 = 1, 2.\nSupplemental Material No. 8. EFFECTS OF SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION\nIn this section, we discuss the effects of surface reconstructions on our theory. In general, surface reconstructions can occur, which will affect the surface electronic states, surface energies and crystal shapes. Since the surface reconstructions largely depend on details of the materials, we cannot develop a quantitative theory for general systems with surface reconstructions. Meanwhile, because our theory is based on the topology under glide symmetry, it remains valid if the glide symmetry is preserved after surface reconstruction. Meanwhile, as we discuss in the following, the glide symmetry is likely to be preserved through surface reconstruction. In order to discuss this point, we consider a layer construction, where 2D TI layers are periodically located along the out-of-plane direction. This consists of two kinds of layers LA and LB , where LA and LB are interchanged by My [Supplementary Fig. 17(a)]. The layers LA are at z = n, and the layers LB are at z = n+ 1 2 (n: integer). Then we focus on a glide-symmetric surface, a (10\u03b3) surface with \u03b3 being an even number. When \u03b3 is even, the (10\u03b3) surface can be divided into the two steps, and one consists of the layers LA LB \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LA and the other consists of the layers LB LA \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LB [Supplementary Fig. 17(b)]. The layers LA LB \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LA and the layers LB LA \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LB are interchanged under the My operation. Therefore, the configuration of the layers is invariant under a combination between a translation (\u22121/2, 0, \u03b1/2) and the My mirror, which means that this surface has Gy symmetry. When the surface reconstruction occurs, the reconstruction of LA LB \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LA and LB LA \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 LB is likely to occur in such a way that they are mapped to each other by the My operation [Supplementary\n28\n[1] J.
