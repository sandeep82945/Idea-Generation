    "abstractText": "Aim of present study was to assess pharmacological (antioxidant, antibacterial & antifungal) potential of Operculina terpathum seeds. Ethanolic extract was prepared and its phytochemical evaluation show the different chemical compounds such as carbohydrates, phenols, tannin, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, alkaloids and proteins. FTIR spectra showed the presence of organic acids, hydroxyl and phenolic compounds, amino groups, aliphatic compounds, functional groups such as amide, ketone, aldehyde, aromatics and halogen compounds. Antioxidant activity of the Operculina terpathum alcoholic extract was performed by DPPH method and it showed 97.13%whereas IC50\u00b1SEM (\u03bcg/ml) was 1.425\u00b10.16. Antibacterial activity was performed against different bacterial strains and results were comparable with that of standard. Maximum antibacterial activity was exhibited by Bacillus subtillis (28.33\u00b12 mm) and Bacillus pumilus (25.33\u00b12 mm) respectively. Antifungal activity was also performed and it showed maximum activity against Aspergillus flavous and Candida albicans6\u00b11, 5\u00b11mm respectively. These results showed that Operculina terpathum has good antibacterial and antifungal activity against different microbes and it could be used as an alternative to antibiotics, as the antibiotics resistance is very common now a days",

Plant contains\nwww.pharmacypractice.org (eISSN: 1886-3655 ISSN: 1885-642X) \u00a9 the Authors\n2\nmany active compounds that have antimicrobial properties and used to treat different diseases. In the study, 70 herbal plants were reported to have antimicrobial activity. Microorganisms recorded in the sample included Gram +ve, Gram-ve bacteria and fungi.1 Plants have been used for the cure of human illnesses for thousands of years. Until the 18th century, the careers of physician and botanist were closely related. Each plant species produces chemicals that can adversely affect certain animals or micro-organisms and strongly supports the interpretation that secondary metabolites play a vital role in disease control. Antifungal medications are medicinal agents used against a range of pathological conditions caused by fungi, most commonly involving candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, ringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, fungal infection of the nails, aspergillosis, etc.2 Operculina Turpethum is a perpetual sweet-smelling creeper with a straightforward stem, threesided or rectangular stems with numerous leaves as well as has oval appearance. It belongs to Asian locales; Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and Taiwan. Mainly it is used as expectorant, brain tonic and laxative. Pharmacological studies have revealed that Operculina Turpethum exhibit antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-microbial, antispasmodic, antidiarrheal, antiulcer, bronchodilator and anticancer properties. The additional use of useful plants has an enormous pragmatic effect in the producer countries, taking into account easy availability.3 These assessments have yielded impressive results from useful antimicrobial plants and are planned to be applied to validate antimicrobial potential against various microbes.4 This change in drug resistance is expected to cause 10 million causes worldwide by 2050.5 More than 84% of Pakistanis use alternative medicines to cure different diseases, and more than 200 local plants are used as an optional adjacent treatment for various infectious contaminations.6 Since the nation has different regions and social values, herbal remedies frequently fluctuate in such a way that approximately 600-700 plants are used to treat disease.7\nPresent study was designed to investigate chemical constituents of Operculina turpethum by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer) and screening of antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities for technical evidence for its use as a folk medicine in the treatment of different bacterial and fungal diseases."

Zone of inhibition was 14\u00b12 mm by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and it was 13.33\u00b12 mm by Bordetella bronchiseptica. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis had inhibitory effect in the range of 15.33\u00b12 mm and 16.66\u00b13 mm respectively. 17.66\u00b12 mm and 15\u00b12 mm was zone of inhibition by Micrococcus luteus and E. coli respectively. Operculia terpathum showed very good antibacterial action against all bacterial strains, results are shown in table 5\nAnti-fungal activity\nEthanolic extract of Operculia terpathum showed antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavous (6\u00b11 mm) and Candida albicans (5\u00b11 mm). Mild antifungal activity was reported by Aspergillus fumigates (4\u00b11 mm) and (3\u00b11 mm) Aspergillus terreus. Results are shown in Table 6."

Antibacterial activity offered by nonpolar compound(s) may also be a reason as it may fail to diffuse in agar media to exhibit antibacterial activity in disc diffusion assay (Anderson et al., 1988). Change in inculum size can change the results of test sample. Saponins are also reported from this plant that have different pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, analgesic, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, Anti allergic and antineoplastic. Other chemical constituents such as tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids other volatile compounds of this herb acts as defense mechanisms against different microorganisms. Flavonoids have antibacterial activity that may be due to their ability to complex with extracellular and soluble proteins and to complex with bacterial cell walls. Alkaloids, phenolic, tannins, polyphenols, quinones, flavonoids and terpenoids are the main antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of separating plants. Many chemicals found in plants\u2019 secondary metabolism have strong antibacterial activity, making them ideal candidates for developing natural alternatives to synthetic preservatives in food.12 Another study used varied concentrations of ethanol extract of Aloe vera leaves and roots on bacterial and fungal strains (15, 20, 25, 30ul). Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and other bacterial strains were employed in the study concluding that the use of plants in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments caused by these pathogenic strains is effective.13 In an in vitro analysis, major active components of cinnamon stick such as (E)-cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins exhibited important antibacterial potential against five foods containing bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella anatum.14\nIn another study by 13 common flavonoids i.e. chrysin, flavone, apigenin, luteolin, vitexin, orientin, vitexin 2\u2019\u2019-O-rhamnoside, isovitexin, isoorientin, kaempferol, quercetin, naringin and rutin were tested for their antibacterial activity and from the study it was revealed that these compounds inhibited both the\ngram +ve and gram -ve bacterial strain of which gram negative were strongly inhibited.15\nIn acute toxicity studies, Operculia terpathum did not cause any mortality up to the tested dose of as high as 5 g/kg, which is much higher than the routinely used dose.16 Further studies are needed to evaluate its chronic toxicity."

However further pharmacological investigations can be carried out to confirm their efficacy and mechanism of action Ethanolic extract of plants showed good susceptibility to almost all pathogens except very few when compared to standard ciprofloxacin as very good results seen against Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtillis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis Micrococcus luteus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E.coli respectively against different concentrations of plant extract. Antifungal activity results showed that Aspergillus flavous, Aspergillus terreus having good sensitivity but Aspergillus fumigates and Candida albicans having less sensitivity as compared to standard medicine. Further investigations are needed to understand mechanism of action."
