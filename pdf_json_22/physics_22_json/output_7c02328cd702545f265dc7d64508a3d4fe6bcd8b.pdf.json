Similar to SN 1991T, SN 1999aa was characterized by early-time spectra dominated by Fe III features and a weak Si II 6355 \u00c5 line, but it exhibited a high-velocity Ca II H&K line and morphed into a spectroscopically normal SN Ia earlier. Three explosion models are investigated, yielding comparable fits. The innermost layers are dominated by \u223c0.3 M of neutron-rich stable iron-group elements, mostly stable iron. Abo v e that central region lies a 56 Ni-dominated shell, extending to v \u2248 11 000\u201312 000 km s \u22121 , with mass \u223c0.65 M . These inner layers are therefore similar to those of normal SNe Ia. Ho we ver, the outer layers exhibit composition peculiarities similar to those of SN 1991T: The intermediate-mass elements shell is very thin, containing only \u223c0.2 M , and is sharply separated from an outer oxygen-dominated shell, which includes \u223c0.22 M . These results imply that burning suddenly stopped in SN 1999aa. This is a feature SN 1999aa shares with SN 1991T, and explains the peculiarities of both SNe, which are quite similar in nature apart from the different luminosities. The spectroscopic path from normal to SN 1991T-like SNe Ia cannot be explained solely by a temperature sequence. It also involves composition layering differences, suggesting variations in the progenitor density structure or in the explosion parameters.\nKey words: line: identification \u2013 nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances \u2013 radiative transfer \u2013 supernovae: general \u2013 supernov ae: indi vidual: SN 1999aa.\n1\nT i o l M w c t\no s M p e\nt 5\nt d f 2\ng a p & a\ns w w\n\u00a9 P C p\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/3/4445/6650889 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024 I N T RO D U C T I O N ype Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most luminous transients n the Univ erse. The y are thought to be the thermonuclear explosions f carbon\u2013oxygen (CO) white dwarfs close to the Chandrasekhar imit (Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000 ; Mazzali et al. 2007 ; Livio & azzali 2018 ). A relation between the peak luminosity with the idth of the light curve (Phillips 1993 ) makes SNe Ia standardizable andles and has led to their practical use as distance indicators and for he disco v ery of dark energy (Perlmutter et al. 1998 ; Riess et al. 1998 )\nThe rise of the SN Ia light curve is caused by the deposition f the gamma-rays and positrons emitted in the decay of the 56 Ni ynthesized during the explosion (Arnett 1982 ; Kuchner et al. 1994 ; azzali et al. 1998 , 2001 ). The optical photons created in this rocess remain trapped until the ejecta become optically thin as they xpand (Mazzali et al. 2001 ), allowing their diffusion.

Even though the majority of SNe Ia constitute a nearly equi v alent roup of intrinsically bright events and their spectroscopic features re fairly similar, observations indicate a scatter in their spectroscopic roperties (Branch 2001 ; Silverman et al. 2012a ; Jha, Maguire Sulli v an 2019 ; Siebert et al. 2019 ); see Filippenko ( 1997 ) for re vie w.\nA question that arises is how distinct these events are. A clear eparation could mean that they are of intrinsically different nature, hile a continuity of properties would suggest quasi-similar events, ith the observ ed div ersity being caused by smoothly changing arameters. Important factors are the physical mechanism through hich the white dwarf reaches ignition densities, the mass at xplosion, and the explosion mechanism.\nis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative h permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nM\nt a g a z f h g e m t t o m t c b v i\nl e t m 2 l e l e s t\na t e w m e d l s l w a S S\nS 2 m S t\ns fi o t a A o m\nFigure 1.

Simulations of pure deflaration models were unable to reproduce 56 Ni masses of \u223c0 . 5 M nd kinetic energies \u223c10 51 erg, as derived from observations (Mazali et al. 2007 ). In contrast, a pure detonation, in which the burning ront propagates supersonically and ignites the fuel by compressive eating, incinerates the whole star to iron-group (hereafter, Feroup) nuclei and cannot explain the presence of intermediate-mass lements (IMEs) in the ejecta outer layers. Alternative successful odels have been proposed in which the deflagration front transits o a detonation at some specific density (deflagration to detonation ransition, or DDT, Khokhlov 1991b ). One-dimensional simulations f delayed-detonation models have proven successful in reproducing any of the observed spectral features of SNe Ia, in particular, he presence of a layer of IMEs, the product of partial burning of arbon and oxygen. These models can also account for the energy udget of the most energetic events and for the observed photospheric elocities. Ho we ver, the exact physics of how this transition occurs s still a subject of e xtensiv e research (Woosley 2007 ).\nThe early-time spectra of normal SNe Ia are characterized by ines of singly ionized IMEs such as Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe-group lements. As time progresses, Fe lines increase in strength until hey dominate the appearance of the spectrum a few weeks after\naximum light (Filippenko 1997 ; Parrent, Friesen & Parthasarathy 014 ). Ho we ver, in some \u2018peculiar\u2019 events characterized by high uminosity (SN 1991T, and SNe of its subgroup; e.g. Filippenko t al. 1992 ), singly ionized IMEs only start to appear near maximum ight, never reaching the same intensity as in normal SNe Ia. Their arly-time spectra are instead dominated by doubly ionized species uch as Fe III and Si III . The presence of these lines requires high emperatures in the outer ejecta.\nSNe Ia with properties intermediate between those of SN 1991T nd normal SNe Ia have been discovered. One case in particular is hat of SN 1999aa, the subject of this study (Garavini et al. 2004 ; Jha t al. 2006 ; Matheson et al. 2008 ). Similar to SN 1991T, SN 1999aa as a slow decliner, with m 15 ( B ) measurements ranging from 0.75 ag (Krisciunas et al. 2000 ) to 0.85 mag (Jha et al. 2006 ). The arliest spectra of SN 1999aa resemble those of SN 1991T in being ominated by Fe III lines and by the weakness of singly ionized IME ines, in particular Si II 6355 \u00c5. Ho we v er, unlike SN 1991T, the y howed a high-velocity Ca II H&K feature. SN 1999aa morphed to ooking like a normal SN Ia earlier than did SN 1991T. In fact, 1 eek before B maximum, S II 5468, 5654 \u00c5 and Si II 6355 \u00c5 were lready visible in SN 1999aa. Figs 1 and 2 show optical spectra of N 1999aa compared to SN 1991T and the spectroscopically normal N 2003du, respectively \u223c10 d before and near B maximum. It has been suggested that SN 1999aa and similar SNe Ia [e.g. Ne 1998es (Ayani & Yamaoka 1998 ); 2012cg (Silverman et al. 012c ); and 1999dq, 2001eh, 2002hu, 2006cz, and 2008Z (Silveran, Kong & Filippenko 2012b )] constitute a subclass of their own. ilverman et al. ( 2012b ) estimate the rate of SN 1999aa-like SNe Ia o be comparable to that of SN 1991T-like events. A theoretical understanding of SN 1999aa should help clarify the pectroscopic sequence from normal to SN 1991T-like events. A rst step toward this is to derive the composition and stratification f the ejecta. This can be done using the so-called abundance omography technique (Stehle et al. 2005 ), which involves modelling temporal series of spectra to reproduce their features consistently. t early times, the spectra are characterized by a pseudo-continuum n which P Cygni profiles of the lines that dominate near the omentary photosphere are superimposed. As the ejecta expand,\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nhe photosphere recedes inward and re veals progressi vely deeper ayers. This approach was successfully used to model several SNe Ia: N 2002bo (Stehle et al. 2005 ), SN 2004eo (Mazzali et al. 2008 ), N 2003du (Tanaka et al. 2011 ), SN 1991T (Sasdelli et al. 2014 ), nd SN 1986G (Ashall et al. 2016 ).\nHere, we use the abundance tomography technique to investigate he properties of SN 1999aa. In Section 2 , we describe the data used, nd in Section 3 we explain the modelling methods. We present ur modelling results in Sections 4 and 5 . In Section 6 , we discuss he abundance tomography results. We use the derived abundances o compute a bolometric light curve in Section 7 , and Section 8 iscusses our results.

The host galaxy is NGC 2595, a barred spiral of morphologcal classification SAB(rs)c with redshift z = 0.0144 (Epinat et al. 008 ; van Driel et al. 2016 ). Distance moduli to the galaxy based n the Tully\u2013Fisher relation range from \u03bc = 32.30 \u00b1 0.53 mag Bottinelli et al. 1985 ) to \u03bc = 34.44 \u00b1 0.47 mag (Theureau et al. 007 ). Distances using the light curve of SN 1999aa vary from \u03bc = 3.43 \u00b1 0.16 mag (Amanullah et al. 2010 ) to \u03bc = 34.58 \u00b1 0.24 mag Riess et al. 2004 ).\nPhotometric data are taken from Jha et al. ( 2006 ), Krisciunas et al. 2000 ), Qiao et al. ( 1999 ), Armstrong & Schwartz ( 1999 ), Yoshida t al. ( 1999 ), and Altavilla et al. ( 2004 ). Late-time unpublished data re based on observations collected with the Optical Imager Galileo OIG) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) \u2013 La Palma. The TNG OIG UBVRI frames were reduced following standard procedures nd made use of the ECSNOOPY package (Cappellaro 2014 ) using he point spread function fitting technique for the SN measurement. he BVRI SN magnitudes were then calibrated with reference to he magnitudes of field stars retrieved from Krisciunas et al. ( 2000 ), hile for the U band, we converted the SDSS catalogue magnitudes\nf the local sequence into Johnson U following Chonis & Gaskell 2008 ). The final TNG + OIG magnitudes are shown in Table 1 , here the mean photometric errors, estimated with artificial-star xperiments, are given in parentheses. The spectra used in this study are available at the Weizmann nteractiv e Superno va Data Repository (Yaron & Gal-Yam 2012 ); hey are listed in Table 2 . The spectra were calibrated against hotometric observations. Calibration was performed in the U , B , V , nd R bands by multiplying the spectra with a line of constant gradient r with a low-order smoothed spline. We ensured that the flux in the pectra in any passband did not vary by more than \u223c10 per cent from he observed flux in that filter passband.\nM O D E L L I N G T E C H N I QU E S\npectra in the photospheric phase have been modelled using a onte Carlo spectrum synthesis code (Mazzali & Lucy 1993 ;\nucy 1999a , b ). The code assumes a sharp photosphere. As the jecta expand homologously, the photosphere recedes in velocity pace and consequently in mass coordinate. Thermal equilibrium is ssumed. Photons emitted from the photosphere propagate through he expanding ejecta and interact with the gas through line absorption, ncluding line branching (Mazzali 2000 ), or electron scattering. The equired input parameters are the density structure of the SN ejecta, he emergent bolometric luminosity L Bol , the photospheric velocity ph , the time from the explosion t 0 , and the abundances of the lements as a function of depth abo v e the photosphere.\nThe distance and the extinction to the SN are needed in order o scale the flux. Since the distance to NGC 2595 is not known ccurately, we treat it as a free parameter, within the range allowed by he literature. We tested several values of the distance modulus ( \u03bc) for hree different spectra. For larger distances the high luminosity causes high temperature, which in turn leads to unrealistic ionization. The pposite happens for distances that are too small. The best models re obtained with \u03bc = 34.00 mag, which is very close to the mean alue calculated using the various distance moduli reported in the iterature, \u03bc\u0304 = 33.975 \u00b1 0 . 34 mag. We adopt an extinction value ( B \u2212 V ) = 0.04 mag (Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis 1998 ) for the ilky Way and assume E ( B \u2212 V ) = 0.00 mag for the host galaxy Krisciunas et al. 2000 ). We also tested different rise times, between 9 and 21 d; the best results are obtained with a value of 20 d. We use three different density\u2013velocity distributions: the classical ast deflagration model, W7 (Nomoto et al. 1984 ), and two more nergetic delayed-detonation models, DD2 and DD3 from Iwamoto t al. ( 1999 ). These density profiles are shown in Fig. 3 .\nHaving fixed \u03bc, t 0 , and E ( B \u2212 V ), the modelling starts with he earliest spectrum. Different values of L Bol are tried until the ynthetic spectrum matches the observed one in flux.

In parallel, the abundances are modified until the model atches the observation. For the following spectrum in the sequence, a new, smaller v ph s defined. This will introduce a new shell where new abundances an be determined. This process is repeated for each spectrum. As he spectra evolve, deeper layers are revealed and the abundance tratification is gradually built.

The synthetic spectra orresponding to the three explosion models we use are shown in igs 4 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 , o v erlaid on the observed spectra. .1 The early-time spectra n Fig. 4 , we show models for the earliest spectra, ranging from 11 to \u22129 d from B maximum. The synthetic spectra reproduce the bserved features well. In particular, they exhibit deep absorption ines of Fe III and Si III , and the o v erall flux matches the observed ux, except in the redder bands. The velocity of the photosphere tarts at 12 600 km s \u22121 and decreases to 12 000 km s \u22121 . .1.1 Fe-group elements small amount of iron is needed at the outer shells to reproduce he deep observed features near 4250 and 5000 \u00c5. This is stable e; at these early stages, 56 Ni would not have had time to decay ignificantly into 56 Fe. The mass fraction of Fe at v > 12, 600 m s \u22121 needed to reproduce the observed features is \u223c0.015\u20130.018 Fig. 5 ). The presence of stable Fe in the outer shells has been reported n other SNe Ia. Sasdelli et al. ( 2014 ) give a solar abundance [ X (Fe ) 0.001, Asplund et al. ( 2009 )] for SN 1991T, while Tanaka et al. 2011 ) report values of \u223c0.003\u20130.005 for SN 2003du. Our values are ignificantly supersolar.\nSmall amounts of 56 Ni, Ti, and Cr are needed at these epochs o block the ultraviolet (UV) flux and redistribute it redward. The bundance of 56 Ni is not constrained at these epochs, as no visible ine in the spectrum is reproduced by 56 Ni or Co alone. Unfortunately, he spectra of SN 1999aa do not extend bluer than \u223c3400 \u00c5, where a\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nrominent feature dominated by Co III should be expected at \u223c3200 (Mazzali, Danziger & Turatto 1995 ; Stehle et al. 2005 ; Sasdelli t al. 2014 ).\n.1.2 Calcium\nhe early-time spectra of SN 1999aa show a deep absorption line ear 3700 \u00c5, with strength intermediate between that of normal Ne Ia and SN 1991T (Garavini et al. 2004 ). This feature is due to igh-velocity Ca II H&K (Mazzali et al. 2005b ). We are able to produce it with X (Ca) \u2248 0.0035 at v > 21 000 m s \u22121 with the W7 model. The DD2 and DD3 models have more ass at high velocity, and therefore X (Ca) \u2248 0.00025 is sufficient (see anaka et al. 2011 ). This is much less than the Ca abundance reported n some spectroscopically normal SNe Ia (Tanaka et al. 2008 ). o we v er, those SNe e xhibit a much stronger Ca II H&K lines and a uch earlier appearance of the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) feature than n both SN 1999aa and SN 1991T. On the other hand, the abundance e obtained is similar to that obtained for SN 1991T, for which asdelli et al. ( 2014 ) estimate a Ca abundance < 0.0003 at v > 17000 m s \u22121 using the DD3 density profile. Regardless of the density rofile used, our results suggest that the abundance of Ca at high elocities is supersolar [ X (Ca ) = 0.00006, Asplund et al. ( 2009 )].\nThe strength of the Ca II H&K feature is very sensitive not only o the Ca abundance at high velocity, but also to the parameters hat directly affect ionization, in particular the electron density. The resence of free electrons decreases the ionization and fa v ours singly onized species (Mazzali et al. 2005a , b ). Adding H results in a higher lectron density. Following Tanaka et al. ( 2011 ), in Fig. 6 we show ow the Ca II H&K feature can be reproduced with different Ca bundances coupled with different amounts of H at the outermost hells ( v > 21 000 km s \u22121 ). Ho we ver, because of the degeneracy etween the Ca abundance and the electron density, it is not possible o determine the Ca mass fraction. Hydrogen may result from the nteraction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium (Mazzali t al. 2005b ) or may be a remnant of accretion on the surface of he WD (Livio & Mazzali 2018 ). Even though small amounts of H re sufficient to reduce the ionization at the dilute outermost layers, nd therefore create the high-velocity features (HVFs) ubiquitously bserved in SNe Ia spectra (Mazzali et al. 2005b ), larger amounts X ( H ) 0.3], will give rise to an H \u03b1 feature that is not seen in he observed spectrum. The lack of H signatures can be taken as an rgument against the single degenerate scenario (Marietta, Burrows Fryxell 2000 ; Panagia et al. 2006 ) but it is not enough to rule it ut (Justham 2011 ; Hachisu et al. 2012 ). For a re vie w, see Li vio & azzali ( 2018 ).\n.1.3 Silicon, sulphur, and magnesium\nhe Si II 6355 \u00c5 line is much weaker in the earliest spectra of N 1999aa than in normal SNe Ia. It grows in strength as the spectra volve. Ho we ver, the feature near 4400 \u00c5, which is due to Si III 553, 4568, 4575 \u00c5, is prominent in the earliest spectra, as the high emperature fa v ours doubly ionized species. These Si lines are well eproduced in the synthetic spectra. The Si mass fraction is 0.025 at v 12 600 km s \u22121 , but it rapidly increases to 0.73 at v > 12 300 km s \u22121 . The two S II features at 5468 and 5654 \u00c5 are not present at these arly epochs, and only start to show at day \u223c\u22126. The Mg II 4481 \u00c5 ine is never visible in the spectra of SN 1999aa, as that region is ominated by Fe III lines.\nFigure 4. Early-time spectra. Epochs are shown with reference to B maximum. Features in the \u221210.2 d spectrum near 6780 \u00c5 (very weak) and 7500 \u00c5 (weak) are telluric. The spectra have been shifted in flux by a constant value. The horizontal dashed line marks the zero flux for each epoch.\nFigure 5. A close-up view of the day \u221211 spectrum showing the region where the strongest Fe III lines are seen.

It can be observed on top of the Si II 355 \u00c5 P Cygni emission, but it is not a common feature. This line is ot visible in SN 1999aa. An upper limit to the carbon abundance of 0.0005 by mass at v > 12 600 km s \u22121 can be determined (Fig. 7 ). he absence of C in the outermost layers fa v ours delayed-detonations odels (Khokhlov 1991b ; Marion et al. 2006 ). It is also possible that arbon is present, but most of it is in a doubly ionized state and herefore does not produce a visible feature in the spectrum. It is ifficult to excite any lower level of any optical line of C III at the emperatures of even a luminous SN Ia. Carbon may also be present at uch higher velocities, but in order to investigate this, we need earlier bservations which unfortunately are not available for SN 1999aa. The synthetic spectra using W7 show a shallow O I 7744 \u00c5 line see Fig. 4 ). This feature is not seen in spectra of SN 1999aa. The D2 and DD3 profiles have less mass in the region between 13 000 nd 16 000 km s \u22121 , where the line is formed (see Fig. 3 ), and produce much shallower feature that matches better the observed spectra days \u221211 and \u221210). The oxygen abundance can be constrained by onsidering the abundances of other elements that are present at high elocity (Si, S, Ca, Fe, and 56 Ni). Oxygen dominates at v > 12 600 m s \u22121 , but is absent already at v \u2248 12 300 km s \u22121 . This behaviour s remarkably similar to that of SN 1991T (Sasdelli et al. 2014 ).

The Fe abundance is igh, because iron from 56 Ni decay is now a significant contribution \u223c30 per cent) to the Fe abundance. The feature observed near 4300 is still dominated by Fe III . The Fe III feature near 5000 \u00c5 becomes roader because of the contribution of Fe II lines. This is reproduced easonably well in our synthetic spectra. .3.2 Calcium\nhe synthetic spectra still reproduce well both the depth and the shape f the Ca II H&K feature. At these epochs, it becomes contaminated y Si II and Co III lines in its bluer part and by Si II and Fe III lines in its edder part (see Silverman et al. 2015 ). The Ca II NIR triplet begins to ppear 2 d after B maximum, and this is reproduced in the synthetic pectra. This feature is seen much earlier in spectroscopically normal Ne Ia, where it is much stronger than in SN 1999aa even \u223c12 d efore maximum light (Stehle et al. 2005 ; Mazzali et al. 2008 ; Tanaka t al. 2011 ).

( 2012a ) for details regarding data cquisition and reduction.\nThe spectra were modelled using our non-local thermodynamic quilibrium (NLTE) code, which is based on the assumptions set ut by Axelrod ( 1980 ). The emission of gamma rays and positrons rom a distribution of 56 Ni is computed, and the propagation and eposition of these particles is determined using a Monte Carlo cheme as outlined first by Cappellaro et al. ( 1997 ). Opacities \u03ba\u03b3 0.027 cm 2 g \u22121 and \u03bae + = 7 cm 2 g \u22121 are assumed in order to ompute the deposition of energy. The energy that is deposited is sed partly for impact-ionization, while the rest heats the ejecta via ollisional excitation. The population of excited levels is computed n NLTE. Heating is then balanced by cooling via line emission.\nost emission is in forbidden lines, in particular of the elements that ominate the inner ejecta (i.e. Fe, Co, and Ni), but some is also via ermitted transitions, in particular of Ca II . The ejecta are assumed o be transparent to optical radiation, so no transport is performed. s discussed by Mazzali et al. ( 2007 ) and others, the code can use one-dimensional stratified density and composition, and it can be mployed to explore the inner layers of an SN Ia and thus to complete he tomography experiment in regions that are not accessible during he early photospheric phase.\nThe same three explosion models used for the early-time data re tested in the nebular phase, at both available epochs.

A best fit is defined empirically, as it s impossible to match every line and not all lines carry the same eight of information, but basically we need to match both the ntensity of the lines (which depends on the amount of 56 Ni as well s of the emitting element) and their width (which traces the radial istribution of the emitting elements as well as indirectly that of 56 Ni, ince heating from radioactive decay must reach the emitting region). ollisional data are not perfectly known for many of the Fe lines in he optical region, so we cannot expect that all emission lines will be imultaneously reproduced. We focus therefore on reproducing the trongest emission lines. Fortunately, these include emission from oth Fe III (the emission near 4800 \u00c5) and Fe II (the emission near 200 \u00c5), so we can control the ionization of Fe, which is the dominant pecies in the inner ejecta at the time of the nebular spectra.\nFigs 12 and 13 show the fits to the two nebular spectra. We used the ame composition at both epochs, which confirms that radioactive ecay is the sole powering mechanism of the SN luminosity.\nThe mass of 56 Ni synthesized is \u223c0.65 M for all three models. he stable Fe mass is highest when using DD2, but it is still within\nhe expected range of values (Mazzali et al. 2001 ). The extra Fe eems to be located at 9000\u201312 000 km s \u22121 . Stable Fe is necessary o reduce the ionization degree and obtain a reasonable ratio of the Fe III ] and [Fe II ]-dominated features. The mass of stable Ni is quite\now, and this is reflected by the weakness of the only visible Ni ine, [Ni II ] 7380 \u00c5. This is common to all SNe Ia we have studied, nd suggests that little stable Ni is synthesized even in the dense nnermost regions of SNe Ia. A moderate degree of clumping is used filling factor \u22650.5) in the 56 Ni-dominated regions. Further clumping ay lead to a drop in ionization at later times, as seen in SN 2011fe Graham et al. 2015 ) and SN 2014J (Mazzali et al. 2020 ), but the vailable spectra of SN 1999aa are too early and too close in time o show any change. The combined early-time and late-time studies omplete the abundance tomography experiment. The main elements n the ejecta are summarized in Table 3 , where the expected E K is lso shown and compared to that of the original models.\nA BU N DA N C E TO M O G R A P H Y\nhe mass fractions of different elements as a function of mass and elocity for the three density profiles are shown in Figs 14 , 15 , nd 16 , compared to the original abundance distributions in the ydrodynamical models (Nomoto et al. 1984 ; Iwamoto et al. 1999 ).\nThe inner core, up to v \u2248 2500 km s \u22121 , is dominated by stable e with a small amount of 56 Ni.

The distribution of these elements that we erive is in general agreement with the various explosion models. Moving outward, a 56 Ni-dominated shell extends over \u223c0.8\u20131 M , ut to v \u2248 11 000 km s \u22121 . Practically no stable Ni is present in this egion, in contrast to all explosion models, while a significant amount f stable iron is present, similar to the model prediction in the inner egions of this shell but significantly abo v e it in regions between 000 and 8000\u20139000 km s \u22121 . This results in a larger production of table Fe, at the expense of stable Ni, when our results are compared o the original models.\nA narrow, IME-dominated shell characterizes velocities \u223c11 000\u2013 2 000 km s \u22121 . The abundance of IMEs decreases sharply abo v e this elocity. In the hydrodynamic models, this shell extends to higher elocities. The confinement of the IMEs in a narrow shell was also uggested by Garavini et al. ( 2004 ) based on the velocity evolution f Si II 6355 \u00c5. IMEs are the result of incomplete burning, when the ensities drop to \u223c10 7 g cm \u22123 . Their sudden depletion suggests a udden drop in burning, which may be a key element to understand he structure of the progenitor and the explosion mechanism. The eakness of the IME lines in the early-time spectra of SN 1999aa nd other SN 1991T-like SNe Ia is therefore an abundance effect (see ilippenko et al. 1992 ; Jeffery et al. 1992 ), and not only a temperature ffect. The abundance of 56 Ni is still significant in this region.\nAbo v e the IME shell, an O-rich outer layer is present. We could ot conclusively determine the C abundance as no strong C features\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nre observed. These outermost layers determine the appearance of he earliest spectra (see Fig. 3 ). Small amounts of Ca are necessary to orm the Ca II HVFs. A small abundance of stable Fe, roughly a few er cent, is necessary in order to form Fe lines at the earliest epochs. his is larger than the solar abundance. The host-galaxy metallicity at the location of SN 1999aa is 12 log(O/H) = 8.45 (Galbany et al. 2016 ), about a factor of two elow solar, suggesting that Fe at these shells is probably the result f e xplosiv e nucleosynthesis (see also Hachinger et al. 2013 ). In eneral, the presence of Fe at these shells is more consistent with D2 and DD3 than with W7. Only a very small amount of 56 Ni s present in the O-rich layer, as also previously reported in other Ne Ia (Stehle et al. 2005 ; Tanaka et al. 2011 ). The distribution of 6 Ni is in general consistent with the explosion models.\nL I G H T C U RV E\n.1 Building the bolometric light cur v e\ne constructed a bolometric light curve of SN 1999aa in the range f 3000\u201310 000 \u00c5.

For ach epoch, we integrated the U \u2212 to I -band flux after interpolating he flux between the central wavelengths of the filters, and added t the blue and red boundaries of the interval the fluxes obtained xtrapolating the spectrum with a flat power law to 3000 and 10 000 , respectively. The final bolometric light curve was resampled to he epochs of the actual optical observations. Since the first four easurements (i.e. prior to 1999 February 13.5) are unfiltered, they ave been assimilated to V -band fluxes and a bolometric correction as applied to them equi v alent to the difference between the early olometric magnitude and the simultaneous V -band magnitude. olometric luminosities were obtained using the luminosity distance f NGC 2595 (63.1 Mpc); they are shown in Fig. 17 as black circles. We e v aluated the contribution of the NIR flux to the bolometric ight curve. NIR photometry in the J and K bands is available at our epochs after maximum brightness (Krisciunas et al. 2000 ). The IR luminosity in the range of 10 000\u201324 000 \u00c5 was constructed ollowing a procedure analogous to the one adopted in the optical. lat power laws were used to estimate the flux shortward of the J and and longward of the K band. Luminosities o v er the range 3000\u2013 4 000 \u00c5 at the four epochs when NIR observations are available are hown in Fig. 17 as red circles.\nNo UV observations are available for SN 1999aa, so we cannot ccount for flux at wavelengths shorter than the Bessell U filter ( \u03bb < 000 \u00c5 ). The UV should make a significant contribution only at the arliest epochs (see below).\n.2 Modelling the bolometric light cur v e\naving studied the abundance distribution for a few possible exploion models in SN 1999aa, one way to verify the results is to test them\ngainst another observable. The light curve is one such observable. As s customary in our work, we computed synthetic bolometric light urves using the density and ab undance distrib utions of the three odels we tested. We used a Monte Carlo code that initially follows he emission and deposition of gamma rays and positrons, exactly as n the nebular spectrum calculations. The energy that is deposited is hen assumed to be converted to optical photons, which are in turn ransported through the ejecta using a time-dependent Monte Carlo cheme as outlined by Mazzali et al. ( 2001 ). The propagation of the ptical photons is subject to an opacity. In the case of SNe Ia (and f all H-poor SNe), line opacity is the dominant opacity (Pauldrach t al. 1996 ). Line opacity can be parameterized based on the number f active lines in different species and the relative abundance of that pecies in the ejecta (Mazzali et al. 2001 ). Photon diffusion also epends on the mass in the ejecta and their expansion (i.e. their E k ).\nMNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nM\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nMNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nM\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nFigure 17.

These are compared to the bolometric light curve f SN 1999aa in Fig. 17 . All three synthetic light curves match the bserved one reasonably well. While this suggests that the models e used and the abundances we derived are credible, it is difficult to hoose a best-fitting model. Although DD2 yields the closest 56 Ni ass to the value we obtained for SN 1999aa, the correspondence etween the values we derived for the masses of the various elements nd those in the original hydrodynamic calculation is not al w ays erfect. Also, owing to the lack of early UV data, it is hard to onstrain the densities in the outer layers. We can only conclude that D2 is a reasonable model, but some modification is required. Most ikely, a specific model would have to be derived for SN 1999aa, hich may be similar to DD2 but may differ in some areas, as was he case for SN 2011fe (Mazzali et al. 2014 , 2015 ). DISCUSSION\nur synthetic spectra show reasonably good fits to the observed nes for the three density profiles used, with only small differences etween them. For example, the Si II 6355 \u00c5 feature (Fig. 4 ), he O I 7744 \u00c5 line (Fig. 8 ), and the Fe II lines near 5000 \u00c5 Fig. 10 ) are better reproduced with the DD2 and DD3 density rofiles than with W7. Ho we ver, these dif ferences are marginal, and ased on this criterion alone it is difficult to select a best-fitting odel. The yields of the most important elements or groups of elements re recapped in Table 3 . From these yields we computed the expected\ninetic energy yield for each model using the formula\nk = [1 . 56 M( 56 Ni ) + 1 . 47 M( Fe ) + 1 . 24 M( IME ) \u2212 E bind ] (1) \u00d710 51 erg\nWoosley et al. 2007 ), where E bind = 0 . 46 10 51 erg is the binding nergy of the white dwarf. Results are given in Table 3 . The values e obtain are slightly smaller than the original models. The difference ay be explained by the weak burning at the outer shells. A similar ehaviour was seen in SN 1991T (Sasdelli et al. 2014 ). In Fig. 18 , we compare the abundance distribution of SN 1999aa\nith those of three spectroscopically normal SNe Ia \u2013 SN 2003du m 15 ( B ) = 1.13 mag, Tanaka et al. ( 2011 )], SN 2002bo [ m 15 ( B ) 1.13 mag, Stehle et al. ( 2005 )], and SN 2004eo [ m 15 ( B ) = 1.46 ag, Mazzali et al. ( 2008 )] \u2013 and with that of SN 1991T [ m 15 ( B ) 0.94 \u00b1 0.05 mag, Phillips et al. ( 1999 )]. The plots show a\ntriking similarity between the internal composition of SNe 1999aa nd 1991T, but clear differences with respect to spectroscopically ormal SNe Ia. Most significantly, although IMEs reach a high abundance in a hell at \u223c11 000 km s \u22121 , the IME-dominated shell is very narrow, nd therefore has little mass. At the outer edge, unlike in normal Ne Ia, the abundance of IMEs drops very sharply at v \u2248 12 000 m s \u22121 , abo v e which oxygen dominates. This suggests that the weakness or absence of Si II and S II eatures in the earliest spectra of SN 1991T-like SNe Ia is not only an onization effect but also the result of a low abundance (Mazzali et al. 995 ). In these peculiar SNe, the IME abundance in the outermost\nMNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nM\nFigure 18.

Right-hand side, top to bottom: Stable Fe, 56 Ni, and O. SNe 1999aa and 1991T have similar stratification properties: a more complete dominance of 56 Ni in the inner layers (2000\u201310 000 km s \u22121 ), a narrow IME shell peaking near 11 000 km s \u22121 but terminating sharply abo v e \u223c12 000 km s \u22121 , and a larger pre v alence of oxygen in the outer layers, suggesting less burning in these regions.

In order to check the effect of the Si abundance on the spectra,\ne computed synthetic spectra using increasing quantities of Si at \u2248 12 600 km s \u22121 , at the expense of O, while keeping L Bol and ph unchanged (Fig. 19 ). The Si II 6355 \u00c5 line in SN 1999aa is well eproduced with a Si abundance of \u223c0.025. As the Si abundance ncreases the line gets stronger, and it matches the spectrum of N 2003du when the abundance is \u223c0.1 at high velocities, which s comparable to the abundances reported in SN 2002bo (Stehle et al. 005 ) and SN 2004eo (Mazzali et al. 2008 ). The abundance derived y Tanaka et al. ( 2011 ) for SN 2003du is even higher ( \u223c0.3 at v \u2248 0 500\u201315 000 km s \u22121 ). Although the spectroscopic properties of SN 1999aa suggest hat it is physically intermediate between SN 1991T and normal\nNRAS 515, 4445\u20134463 (2022)\nNe Ia, its photometric properties do not. Our modelling shows hat the amount of 56 Ni synthesized in SN 1999aa ( \u223c0.65 M ) is ess than in SN 1991T ( \u223c0.78 M , Sasdelli et al. 2014 ), suggestng that SN 1999aa should be less luminous than SN 1991T (see ig. 20 ). Ho we ver, SN 1999aa was a slo wer decliner than SN 1991T. N 1999aa has estimated m 15 ( B ) values ranging from 0.75 mag Krisciunas et al. 2000 ) to 0.85 mag (Jha et al. 2006 ), which may e taken to imply that it was actually more luminous than SN 1991T m 15 ( B ) = 0.94 mag].\nHo we ver, a comparison of the bolometric light curves of the two Ne shows that relying on a m 15 ( B ) alone would be misleading. he light curve of SN 1991T is brighter throughout, as it should be ased on the 56 Ni mass. Ho we ver, it peaks much earlier than that of N 1999aa. This is because the 56 Ni abundance in the outer layers f SN 1991T is larger than in SN 1999aa, causing a faster rise to\na t t i m & w w a\nFigure 21.

The luminous phase is hen sustained by the larger 56 Ni mass, but the contrast between he nominal luminosity at peak and that 15 d later is larger than n SN 1999aa, which reaches maximum brightness later. This may ean that m 15 ( B )is not valid for the SN 1991T class (see also Pinto Eastman 2000 ; Woosley et al. 2007 ; Scalzo et al. 2012 ), and it as also suggested for objects at the faint end of the luminosity\u2013 idth relation (Ashall et al. 2018 ). On the other hand, SN 2003du nd SN 1999aa, reach peak luminosities that differ by only log ( L ) 0.05, even though they have different decline rates and different\npectroscopic properties. Despite the distance uncertainties, this esult can be taken to confirm that both of these events synthesize similar mass of 56 Ni as suggested from our spectral modelling approximately 0.62\u20130.65 M , see Table 3 ).\nEven though the ab undance distrib utions in SNe 1999aa and 1991T re similar, their spectroscopic e volution sho ws dif ferences. These an be explained by the difference in luminosity between the two Ne. We computed synthetic spectra at day \u221211 starting from he model that matches SN 1999aa and progressively increased the uminosity (Fig. 21 ). As the luminosity increases, the spectrum hanges, until it finally starts resembling that of SN 1991T: The i II 6355 \u00c5 line becomes weaker, and so does Ca II H&K. The same s true for the Fe III features observed near 3200, 3500, 4200, and 900 \u00c5. SNe Ia e xhibit v ery similar spectroscopic properties beyond maxmum brightness. Therefore, an explosion-progenitor scenario that an explain the complete spectroscopic sequence should be one that llo ws v ariations only in the outer layers. The sudden depletion f the IMEs in the outer shells of SN 1999aa is not easy to xplain within the framework of conventional delayed-detonation xplosion models (Khokhlov 1991b ; Iwamoto et al. 1999 ). One ossible explanation may be an explosion that initially proceeds very fficiently but then suddenly stops, leaving an only weakly burned uter layer. One such class of models is pulsation-driven detonations Iv anov a, Imshennik & Chechetkin 1974 ; Khokhlov 1991a ; Hoeflich, hokhlov & Wheeler 1995 ). In these configurations, the progenitor s characterized by an outer layer with low density, which could e the result of the pre-expansion of a white dwarf that has gone hrough an initial failed burning phase, or to a binary merger. This esults in a steep density gradient and may cause IMEs to be confined n a relatively narrow velocity range. However, these models predict o burning in the outermost layers, and therefore the presence of a opious amount of C (Baron et al. 2008 ), which is not observed in N 1999aa or SN 1991T. Additionally, simulations of these models how IME lines at very early times, and do not resemble the pectra of SN 1991T-like SNe Ia (Dessart et al. 2014 ).

In general, none of the currently available models can explain he entire spectroscopic properties of SNe Ia o v er a large range f luminosities. Nevertheless, the pulsation-driven scenario remains nteresting for SN 1991T-like SNe because it only affects the outer jecta. Based on our current knowledge, this particular scenario hould only kick in when 56 Ni production is very high.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have modelled a series of optical spectra of the peculiar slow ecliner SN 1999aa, from \u221212 to +\u223c300 d from B maximum to nfer the composition layering of its ejecta. Three different density rofiles were used \u2013 the fast deflagration W7 and two delayed etonation models, DD2 and DD3. We have compared our results ith spectroscopically normal events as well as with SN 1991T. Our main results can be summarized as follows.\n(i) All three density profiles yield synthetic spectra similar to the bserved ones and follow their evolution. In particular, an Fe III - ominated early-time spectrum with shallow IME lines, typical of he SN 1991T class, is reproduced.\n(ii) The internal composition of SN 1999aa is dominated by eutron-rich iron-peak elements, as in normal SNe Ia. This is folowed by a 56 Ni shell (mass \u22480.65 M ). Abo v e this lies a narrow ME shell which is sharply separated from the outer, O-dominated hell.\n(iii) The confinement of IMEs to a narrow velocity range and heir depletion in the outermost layers indicates a sudden shift from regime of strong burning to one of weak incomplete burning. his behaviour is remarkably similar to that of SN 1991T, but is not bserved in normal SNe Ia. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude hat SNe 1999aa and 1991T share a similar explosion mechanism, espite their somewhat different luminosities. (iv) The observed stratification may be the result of sharp density radients in the outer shells of the progenitor. (v) The spectroscopic path from normal SNe Ia to the brightest peuliar events cannot be explained solely by a luminosity/temperature equence. It should involve composition layering differences sugesting variations either in the density structure of the progenitor hite dwarf at the outer layers or in details of the explosion. (vi) Within the SN 1991T class, IME confinement coupled with ifferences in luminosity (i.e. 56 Ni production) may explain the bserved spectra.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhis work has used data collected at the Italian Telescopio Nazionale alileo (TNG) , which is operated on the island of La Palma by\nhe Fundacion Galileo Galilei of the INAF (Istituto Nazionale di strofisica) at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos f the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.
