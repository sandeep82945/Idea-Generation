Enhancement of CO2 Absorption Efficiency: Investigate the modification of APILs' structures to enhance their CO2 absorption efficiency. This could involve the introduction of functional groups that can form stronger interactions with CO2 or increase the ionic liquid's basicity. Research could focus on the synthesis of novel APILs with designed structures for optimized CO2 capture performance, potentially leading to higher absorption capacities and selectivities for CO2 over other gases.

Thermal and Chemical Stability Studies: Conduct long-term thermal and chemical stability studies of APILs under CO2 absorption and desorption cycles. Understanding the stability of APILs in realistic CO2 capture and storage conditions is crucial for their practical application. This research could identify degradation pathways and develop strategies to enhance the durability of APILs in industrial applications.

Development of Composite Materials for CO2 Capture: Explore the development of composite materials by incorporating APILs into solid supports, such as porous materials or polymers, to create hybrid sorbents for CO2 capture. These composites could combine the high CO2 absorption capacity of APILs with the ease of handling and regeneration properties of solid materials, potentially leading to advanced materials for efficient CO2 capture from various sources.

Process Integration and Scale-Up Studies: Perform process integration and scale-up studies to assess the feasibility of incorporating APILs into existing industrial CO2 capture and separation processes. This research would involve the development of pilot-scale studies to evaluate the performance, energy requirements, and economic viability of APIL-based CO2 capture technologies in comparison to current state-of-the-art technologies.

Environmental Impact and Lifecycle Analysis: Investigate the environmental impact and lifecycle analysis of CO2 capture processes using APILs. This research would assess the overall sustainability of using APILs for CO2 capture, including their production, usage, and disposal stages. It could provide insights into the potential environmental benefits or challenges of deploying APIL-based technologies for mitigating CO2 emissions.
