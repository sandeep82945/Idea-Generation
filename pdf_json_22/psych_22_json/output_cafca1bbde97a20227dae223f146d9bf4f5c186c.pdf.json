            "text": "Working memory (WM) is a fundamental process underlying higher cognitive functions, such as learning, language comprehension and problem solving. Thus, WM has an important significance to an individual\u2019s adaptation and survival (Wagner, 1999; Baddeley, 2003). Abundant evidence suggests that exposure to sustained stress degrades WM (Evans and Schamberg, 2009; Marin et\u00a0al., 2011; Young and Yukiori, 2015). Such an effect is thought to result from poor attention resources allocation during WM processing. Researchers argue that stress results in more difficulty when inhibiting task-irrelevant internal thoughts which negatively affect attention resources, and therefore lead to impaired WM (Bishop, 2008; Schoofs et\u00a0al., 2008; Liston et\u00a0al., 2009; Qin et\u00a0al., 2009). However, few studies inform us how one might protect WM from the harmful effects of stress. Here, we\u00a0explore whether self-awareness is a protective factor for these harmful effects.\nSelf-awareness refers to a state in which individuals pay attention to themselves and experience heightened awareness of their own internal feelings and beliefs (Duval and Wicklund, 1972). The current consensus is that self-awareness has important implications for self-evaluation and motivation (Gendolla et\u00a0al., 2008; Carver and Scheier, 2012; Silvia and Phillips, 2013). It leads people to compare themselves to certain standards and endows success with more necessity and value, thereby mobilizing more resources to meet these standards (Silvia et\u00a0al., 2010, 2011). Many studies have supported this viewpoint (Alberts et\u00a0al., 2011; Huang et\u00a0al., 2017; Xu et\u00a0al., 2021). One example is the study by Alberts et\u00a0al. (2011), which found that cognitive resources can be\u00a0protected by priming self-awareness to circumvent the occurrence of ego depletion. Therefore, we\u00a0presumed that high self-awareness can also protect attention resources, offsetting the harmful effects of chronic stress on WM. Moreover, data from neuroimaging studies suggest that inducing self-awareness can activate the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region and contribute to regulating attention in this area which is implicated in WM (Lei et\u00a0 al., 2011; Vago and David, 2012).\nAlthough some people are more self-aware than others in trait (this trait is called self-consciousness) (Fenigstein et\u00a0al., 1975), self-awareness can be\u00a0 temporarily increased by various manipulations, such as seeing oneself in the mirror (Wiekens and Stapel, 2008; Bender et\u00a0al., 2018) or priming self-related personal pronouns (Walla et\u00a0 al., 2007; Xu et\u00a0 al., 2021). The scrambled sentence task (SST) is an implicit paradigm that has been shown to effectively increase self-awareness. In the SST, participants were asked to unscramble the scrambled sentence that began with the word I\u00a0(e.g., I\u00a0buy some bread) in a self-awareness condition. In the other-awareness (i.e., control) condition, participants were asked to unscramble the neutral scrambled sentence that began with no self-related personal pronouns (e.g., He\u00a0 or She buys some bread).\nEvent-related potentials (ERPs) have been widely used to assess alterations in the dynamic time course of neural activity\nduring WM processing (Picton et\u00a0 al., 1995; Key et\u00a0 al., 2005). Woodman and Vogel (2005) demonstrated that encoding and maintenance operated independently in WM (Woodman and Vogel, 2005). P2 and N2 are ERP components that are associated with the early encoding stage. Specifically, P2 is related to the early allocation of attention and the initial stage of updating (Crowley and Colrain, 2004; Celeste D Lefebvre et\u00a0 al., 2005). Indeed, participants with a lower score in WM tasks have shown smaller P2 (Francisco et\u00a0al., 2021). N2 is more sensitive to attentional control and is closely associated with the automatic processing of response-inhibition (Folstein and Petten, 2008; Qi et\u00a0al., 2018; Xu et\u00a0al., 2022). Enhanced N2 activity has been observed as an index of the difficulty in target and non-target discrimination and is considered highly suggestive of the allocation of \u201cattentional effort\u201d (Crego et\u00a0 al., 2009; Couperus et\u00a0 al., 2021). Altogether, we\u00a0 expected self-awareness to cause dissociable effects on attention resources allocation and attentional control processing at the early encoding stage, resulting in larger P2 and smaller N2 activities. Late positive potential (LPP) is a dynamic measure of the sustained allocation of attentional resources to visual stimuli, with close links to memory encoding and maintenance processing (Ruchkin et\u00a0al., 1990; Weinberg and Greg, 2011; Ma et\u00a0al., 2019). Thus, we\u00a0 expected that self-awareness would evoke more positive LPP.\nIn summary, the purpose of the current study was to explore the influence of priming self-awareness on WM in people under chronic stress. Participants were divided into two groups (selfawareness condition and control condition), and completed the implicit self-awareness priming task (i.e., the SST) or control task, respectively. Subsequently, all participants were asked to complete an n-back task, during which time behavior and electroencephalogram (EEG) were measured (Michael et\u00a0al., 2007; Aubry et\u00a0al., 2018). Based on these aforementioned observations and analyses, we\u00a0 expected that self-awareness would enable individuals to be\u00a0protected from the harmful effects of chronic stress on WM. This protective effect may occur due to the enhancement in attention resources allocation."

The relationship between self-awareness and WM among people with a low stress level will be\u00a0reported elsewhere. Participants were recruited from a local university through online and public postings. All postings specified the inclusion criteria of the study: (1) graduates who were preparing for the CNPEE (an important and competitive exam in the Chinese educational system) from May 2021 to December 2021 because many previous studies have supported that examination preparation is a long-term stressor (Liston et\u00a0al., 2009; Gonz\u00e1lez-Cabrera\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\net\u00a0al., 2014; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2016); (2) physically healthy people; (3) those with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing ability; (4) those with no habit of staying up late; (5) those with no history of psychiatric or neurological illness or psychoactive drug use. All eligible participants were further screened by the following exclusion criteria: completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Student-Life Stress Inventory (SLSI), ensuring that all participants were exposed to chronic stress (PSS top\u00a0 25%) and not exposed to any other major stressors. Participants were first screened based on the inclusion criteria at the time of recruitment and were further screened by the exclusion criteria by a self-reported questionnaire. Finally, a total of 48 participants met the criteria for inclusion in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: selfawareness condition (SA), or control condition (CC) (SA:14 female and 11 male with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 24.16 \u00b1 0.77 years; CC: 13 female and 10 male with a mean \u00b1 SD age of 23.67 \u00b1 0.85 years; t = \u22120.51, p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to PSS (t = \u22121.23, p > 0.05). Additionally, to exclude the possible intellectual differences between the two groups, we\u00a0assessed participants\u2019 IQ using the Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices (t = 1.24, p > 0.05).

After application of the electrodes, participants were seated in a dimly lit, sound-attenuated, electrically shielded chamber with a CRT monitor set\napproximately 60 cm away from participants\u2019 eyes. Participants completed the SST and n-back task while behavioral and EEG data were recorded.\nParticipants were first asked to finish the SST to increase self-awareness (Xu et\u00a0al., 2021). In the SST task, participants in the self-awareness group were asked to unscramble 80 scrambled sentences (18\u00b0 of visual angle) that started with\u2013\u201cI\u201d (e.g., I\u00a0buy some bread), whereas participants in the control group received 80 scrambled sentences (18\u00b0 of visual angle) which started with \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d (e.g., He\u00a0buys some bread). The only difference between the groups was the use of \u201cI\u201d or \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe.\u201d The task consisted of four blocks, and each block contained 20 trials, resulting in a total of 80 trials. The trials were presented randomly. In each trial, the sentence was presented on the screen for 3,000 ms, and participants answered out loud (Figure\u00a01A).\nAfter the SST task were finished, a spatial n-back task was immediately used to test WM (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019). Task difficulty varied across three task loads (0-back, 1-back, and 2-back). In the task, four gray rectangles (5\u00b0 \u00d7 3.5\u00b0 of visual angle) were located above, below, to the left, and to the right of a central fixation cross. One of the gray rectangles would turn yellow in each trial and participants responded to the location of the yellow rectangle in the 0-back load, location of the previous yellow rectangle in the 1-back load, and the location of the yellow rectangle two trials before in the 2-back load. Before the experiment, participants took part in a practice session and received feedback. The experiment did not begin until the participants reached an accuracy rate above 85% at each task load. During the formal experiment, all participants took part in the three tasks (0-, 1-, and 2-back) sequentially without feedback. Participants responded by pressing the corresponding arrow key on the digital keypad (e.g., 8 for above, 5 for below, 4 for left, and 6 for right). In each trial, one of the four gray rectangles turned yellow for at most 1,500 ms if no responses were made, with an inter-stimulus interval of 1,300\u20131800 ms which was randomly applied. There were three task loads and eight blocks per load. In total, the formal experiment included 24 blocks and each block contained 20 trials. Trials inside each block were presented randomly and the entire task lasted about 15\u201320 min (Figure\u00a0 1B). E-Prime software (Version 2.0, Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, United\u00a0States) was used to present the stimuli and record the behavioral data."

The following five electrode points were selected for statistical analysis: Fz and FCz were chosen for P2 (150\u2013200 ms) (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2016; Nikolin et\u00a0al., 2020) and N2 (215\u2013265 ms) (Luck and Hillyard, 1994; Chen and Mitra, 2009), and FCz, Cz and CPz were chosen for LPP (400\u2013700 ms) (Ahonen et\u00a0 al., 2016; Grissmann et\u00a0al., 2017; Ma et\u00a0al., 2019). The mean amplitudes of these components were averaged from these electrode sites and then analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA. Analysis was performed with two (group: self-awareness vs. control) betweensubject factors, and three (load: 0-, 1-, and 2-back) within-subject factors.

Moreover, the mediation model was tested to examine whether neural processing (P2/N2/ LPP) mediated the expected relationships between self-awareness and behavior.

According to the motivational intensity theory, attentional resources are mobilized proportional to the cognitive task difficulty as long as success is important and worthwhile (Brehm and Self, 1989; Wright and Kirby, 2001). On the other hand, priming self-awareness would heighten sensitivity to social standards, which virtually increases the importance of success. Silvia and Phillips (2013) found that self-awareness\nFIGURE\u00a03 Grand-averaged event-related potential waveforms for P2/N2 and LPP of n-back task in self-awareness and control groups.

Their finding was in line with other studies, suggesting that self-awareness significantly enhanced motivation or self-regulation and resulted in better performance with different task demands (Liebling and Shaver, 1973; Alberts et\u00a0al., 2011; Huang et\u00a0al., 2017; Bender et\u00a0al., 2018).\nFor the ERP data, we\u00a0observed dissociable effects at the early encoding stage, showing that there was larger P2 and smaller N2\u00a0in self-awareness participants than in controls. The results are consistent with our hypothesis. P2 is thought to be\u00a0related to the early allocation of attention and initial stage of context updating (Thorpe et\u00a0 al., 1996; Lefebvre et\u00a0 al., 2005, 2010). P2 has been reported in several types of WM tasks, with larger P2 always being associated with efficient attention selection (Lenartowicz et\u00a0al., 2014; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2016; Vila-Ballo et\u00a0al., 2018). Qi et\u00a0al. (2016) observed larger P2\u00a0in the control group than in the stress group (Qi et\u00a0al., 2016). Along similar lines, Li et\u00a0al. (2020) revealed that participants who reacted faster and more accurately evoked larger P2 (Li et\u00a0al., 2020). In the present study, the increased P2\u00a0in the self-awareness group relative to control group may reflect that\nself-awareness enhanced the allocation of attention resources at the encoding stage. It is likely that more attention resources were allocated to target stimuli when self-awareness was induced.\nN2 is the index related to the attention control process (Luck and Hillyard, 1994; Kreusch et\u00a0al., 2014; Couperus et\u00a0al., 2021). The N2 enhancement can be\u00a0interpreted as reflecting attention investment in target and non-target discrimination processing (N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen and Picton, 1986). A similar interpretation was proposed by S\u00e4nger Bechtold et\u00a0al. (2014) who argued that a larger N2 may therefore be\u00a0indicative of more attention resources being required for discrimination and selection during cognitive tasks. Our results, to some extent, supported this idea. The enhanced N2\u00a0 in the control group might suggest that a more intensive attention control process was triggered under the chronic stress state, in which more attention resources must be\u00a0 allotted to complete encoding tasks adequately. Combining the P2 and N2 output, self-awareness might push individuals to allocate more attention resources to target stimuli instead of non-target information in the encoding stage. Such an interpretation was also supported by our behavioral results.\nA B\nFIGURE\u00a05 Scatterplots depicting correlations between self-perceived stress level and ERP responses.

LPP in the self-awareness group was significantly larger than that in the control group. LPP is a dynamic measure of the sustained allocation of attentional resources to visual stimuli at the maintenance stage of WM (Ruchkin et\u00a0al., 1990; Hajcak et\u00a0al., 2010; Weinberg and Hajcak, 2010). Some studies have argued that decreased LPP is a sign of the difficulty of maintaining information in a n-back task or target detection task when there are simultaneous influxes of a variety of information (Macnamara et\u00a0al., 2011; Ma et\u00a0al., 2019). On the other hand, according to attentional control theory, stress restrains the allocation of attentional resources toward task-relevant stimuli (Bishop et\u00a0al., 2004; Eysenck et\u00a0al., 2007; Bishop, 2008). However, participants in the self-awareness state recovered their concentration of attention and allocated more attentional resources to the task-relevant stimuli.\nAdditionally, we\u00a0 found evidence in the results of the correlations. We\u00a0found a highly positive correlation between P2/ N2 and the PSS scores for individuals under chronic stress (i.e., CC), indicating that individuals who have higher stress perception will evoke larger P2/N2, the self-perceived stress plays a critical role in the modulation of P2/N2 components for individuals who are under chronic stress. Those results are supported by a prior n-back task study (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2016). However, in our study, when inducing self-awareness (i.e., SA), such a key role disappeared. On the other hand, P2 and N2 are associated with the early encoding stage (Li et\u00a0al., 2020; Peng et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, we\u00a0speculated that the protective effect of self-awareness on WM at the encoding stage may be\u00a0via reduction of the sensitivity of stress. Of course, this speculation requires further research.\nThe mediation analyses revealed that LPP mediated the relationships between the self-awareness-group and the RT of both 1-and 2-back tasks. LPP has been linked to memory maintenance, reinterpretation of stimulus meaning, as well as attentional biases as measured by RT (Koenig and Mecklinger, 2008; MacNamara et\u00a0al., 2009; Gable and Harmon-Jones, 2010). Evidence from a series of WM tasks suggests that WM load has negative effects on concentration and the maintenance of attention, as measured by LPP (Weinberg and Greg, 2011). Specifically, LPP was larger on low-load than on high-load trials with a shorter RT (Flaisch et\u00a0al., 2008a, 2008b). Taken together, it was speculated that the RT to targets would be\u00a0 specifically reflected in the magnitude of the LPP. In the present study, compared with the control group, larger LPP in the self-awareness group may reflect more attention resources investment in ongoing maintenance processes, possibly underlying the nature of the protective effects of self-awareness on WM process.\nThe key contribution of this work is that it is the first attempt to combine self-awareness, WM, and chronic stress and provides a new idea for the protection of WM capacity in individuals under chronic stress. We\u00a0 verified that self-awareness indeed endows individuals with higher WM performances. Furthermore, with the advantage of high temporal resolution in ERPs, we\u00a0explored the protective mechanism of self-awareness on WM capacity at the\nneural dynamics level. Exploring the protective role of selfawareness in WM processes in people under chronic stress is helpful to have a deeper understanding of individuals under chronic stress, so as to develop specific training and treatment programs."

First, our data were taken only from the results of one single intervention; however, the effects of chronic stress are long-term.

Second, we\u00a0used scrambled sentences for priming self-awareness in the current study. In future research, a variety of paradigms and techniques for priming self-awareness should be\u00a0developed. Other techniques, such as simultaneous EEG-fMRI and MEG, can be\u00a0used, which would enable us to more directly examine the interplay of the PFC, self-awareness and WM tasks in people under chronic stress. Lastly, although the present work provides a first look at the protective effect of self-awareness for WM capacity, future research with larger and more representative participant samples are needed to establish a better understanding of these effects."

We\u00a0found significantly better performance in self-awareness group participants, measured by accuracy and reaction times. The increase in P2, decrease in N2, and increase in LPP were consistent with our hypothesis. These findings suggest that the protective effect of selfawareness may occur at the encoding and maintenance stages in the WM process. Mediational analyses showed that the LPP mediated the relationship between awareness condition and WM performance (i.e., RT). This result potentially suggests that the neural mechanism of the protective effect of self-awareness on WM in people under chronic stress was exerted by improving maintenance processing."
