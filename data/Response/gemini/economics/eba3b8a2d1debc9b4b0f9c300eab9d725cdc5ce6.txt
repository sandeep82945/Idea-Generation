1. **Investigate the impact of study assumptions on MAR study outcomes and MPLC decision making.** This could involve varying the functional form of attributes, the data analysis strategy, and the method of eliciting MAR (e.g., DCE vs. PTT).
2. **Determine the best balance between estimating exact thresholds and determining upper bounds for acceptable risk levels in the PTT.** This could involve comparing the results of PTT studies that use different methods for eliciting MAR, such as open-ended questions vs. bounded choice questions.
3. **Explore the use of latent class analysis to identify heterogeneity in preferences and MAR estimates in DCE studies.** This could help to identify subgroups of respondents who have different preferences for risk and benefit trade-offs.
4. **Compare the cost-effectiveness of DCE and PTT studies.** This could help to determine which method is more cost-effective for estimating MAR in different settings.
5. **Develop guidelines for the design and conduct of PTT studies.** This could help to ensure that PTT studies are conducted in a consistent and reliable manner, and that the results are valid and reliable.
