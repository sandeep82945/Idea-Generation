Heme has a variety of functions, from electronic reactions to binding gases, which makes it useful in medical treatments, dietary supplements, and food processing. In recent years, wholecell system-based heme biosynthesis methods have been continuously explored and optimized as an alternative to the low-yield, lasting, and adverse ecological environment of chemical synthesis methods. This method relies on two biosynthetic pathways of microbial precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (C4, C5) and three known downstream biosynthetic pathways of heme. This paper reviews the genetic and metabolic engineering strategies for heme production in recent years by optimizing culture conditions and techniques from different microorganisms. 1. conclusions Heme has been widely used in various fields due to its unique structure and indispensable biochemical function. Whole-cell system-based biosynthesis methods are being explored to meet the growing demand for heme. First, in the past decade, the complex heme generation pathway (especially the newly discovered CPD and SHD pathway) and effector system in microorganisms have been studied, laying the foundation for biosynthesis and expanding research. Secondly, the strategies of efficient heme production by metabolic engineering and other means through various microorganisms as site cells are constantly enriched, and the optimization of culture conditions and technology has greatly improved the yield. In addition, wholecell-based biosensors and other new technologies in production are no longer limited to high-throughput screening due to synthetic biology and other fields.
