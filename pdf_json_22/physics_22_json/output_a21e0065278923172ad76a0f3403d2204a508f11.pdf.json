            "text": "Page 2/16\nIntroduction Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) is an intriguing nonlinear acousto-optic interaction between laser beams and electrostriction-induced transverse acoustic waves [1]. Since the excited transverse acoustic waves could low-loss transmit and re ect at the boundaries between the cladding, coating, and the ambient media, FSBS has been investigated for diverse acoustic metrologies such as ber diameter monitoring [2,3], temperature [4,5], strain [6,7], ionizing radiation [8] and acoustic impedance sensing [9\u201312] in standard bers. By measuring the frequency shift or linewidth of FSBS spectra, the information about the medium outside the optical bers under test (FUTs) is obtained. The phonon scattering is also applied to the study of dual-mechanism sensing and functional excitonic devices [13,14]. Recently, distributed optomechanical sensor has been realized by merging FSBS with location resolved Rayleigh scattering or backward Brillouin scattering, increasing the practicality, yet with spatial resolutions of tens of meters [15,16]. In order to improve the spatial resolution, optomechanical time-domain analysis (OMTDA) is proposed which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of FSBS spectra via coherent probing technique, reaching a spatial resolution up to 2 m [17]. Furthermore, protocols such as polarization separation and frequency shift extraction have been introduced to improve the spatial resolution of the sub-meter scale [18,19].\nHowever, ordinary single mode ber (SMF) coatings such as acrylate tend to constrain the acoustic waves within the cladding, preventing them from passing through the coating to reach the surrounding media. Thus, it is necessary for the FSBS-based sensing methods to strip the coating of the sensing ber, which is greatly reduced the mechanical strength and limited the industrial and engineering application. In order to overcome the drawback, both point and distributed optomechanical sensing based on FSBS have been proposed by involving polyimide-coated bers (PI- bers) as the sensing bers [20,21].\nPage 3/16\nNonetheless, the PI- bers are prone to undermine the accuracy and reliability of the measurements considering that the water absorption characteristic and the thickness nonuniformity of the polyimide coatings leave their acoustic performance susceptible to in uences and spectral instability [22,23]. Hence, an optical ber coating material with more robust adaptation to environmental changes is starved for solving the above problems, especially for liquid acoustic impedance sensing.\nIn this article, we proposed a novel distributed optomechanical sensing with stable sensing performance and high robustness by using an Aluminized coating optical ber (Al- ber). The quasi-acoustic impedance matching condition of the aluminized coating and silica core-cladding makes the Al- bers have stronger mechanical properties and higher transverse acoustic wave transmission e ciency. Experimental results demonstrate that the FSBS spectra of Al- bers are steady and insensitive to changes in relative humidity (RH). Meanwhile, the distributed FSBS over a 15-m Al- ber has been investigated with a spatial resolution of 2 m, and the air and water outside the FUTs are identi ed. The proposed distributed optomechanical sensor under quasi-acoustic impedance matching condition has a broader potential application.\nMaterials And Methods\nAcoustic impedance matching condition The transverse acoustic waves are activated to steady-state by launching an intense activating pulse via electrostriction effect. Once the pulse is interrupted, the transverse acoustic waves can still maintain the phase continuity with the driven acoustic eld and decay exponentially [19]. The re ection and transmission of the transverse acoustic waves which propagate within multi-layered structures are determined by the acoustic impedances of each layer. Assuming that the re ection and transmission of the wave at the interface are energy-conserving, the acoustic wave re ectivity at the boundary is expressed as [20]\nr = Zs \u2212 Zi Zs + Zi ,\n1\nwhere Zs and Zi are the acoustic impedance of silica and coating respectively. Note that when the impedance of the cladding and coating layers are equal (Zs = Zi), the acoustic wave re ectivity is zero (r = 0), which means that the transmitted power of the acoustic wave is maximum, i.e., the acoustic impedance matching condition. Concurrently, the acoustic impedance of the outer material of the ber is directly related to the resonance linewidth \u0393m of the FSBS spectra [24]\n\u0393m = \u0393s + VL \u03c0dln 1 |R| ,\n| |\nPage 4/16\n2\nwhere \u0393s is the intrinsic linewidths of FBSS resonance, VL = 5996 m/s is denoted as the longitudinal acoustic velocity, R is the total re ectance of sound waves. The boundary condition of the acoustic wave can be represented by [1,25]\n(1 \u2212 V2T V2L )J0(y) \u2212 V2T V2L J2(y) = 0,\n3\nwhere VT = 3740 m/s is the transverse acoustic velocity. Jn is the nth Bessel function of the rst kind. With the mth-order root ym, the boundary condition gives rise to an inverse relationship between the resonance frequency fm and the cladding diameter d [9]\nfm = VL \u22c5 ym\n\u03c0d .\n4\nFortunately, the acoustic impedance of the Aluminum (~ 17.21\u00d7106 kg/(m2\u22c5s)) [26] is close to that of Silica (~ 13.19\u00d7106 kg/(m2\u22c5s)) [20], realizing a quasi-acoustic impedance matching (rsi \u2212 Al = 0.13). Thus, the acoustic waves tend to oscillate within the cross-section of the coating, rather than merely cover the area of cladding. Consequently, the dispersion relation given by Eq.\u00a0(4) is no longer applicable which is expected to be replaced by the more general elastic dynamic equation [3]\n\u03c1 \u22022ui \u2202t2 \u2212 cijklukl + \u03b7 ijkl \u2202ukl \u2202t j = \u03b50\u03c7klijE ( 1) k E ( 2) \u2217 l j ,\n5\nwhere\u03c7klij = \u03b5im\u03b5jnpklmn, \u03c1is the medium density, cijkland\u03b7 ijklare stiffness matrix and viscosity matrix, \u03b5andpklmnare dielectric constant and polarization tensor, respectively. According to Eq.\u00a0(5), the acoustic eld distribution , along with the resonance frequency can be calculated. The exemplary intensity and displacement distribution of R0,6 mode in both the conventional SMF and the used Al- ber are present in Fig.\u00a01(a), and (b), respectively. The signi cant difference is that the intensity of acoustic wave distribution in the coating of Al- ber maintains a high level while that of SMF is rapidly attenuated to a negligible level, which is also valid for acoustic modes of other orders. Under the quasi-acoustic impedance matching between the cladding and Al-coating layer, the acoustic waves have the chance to directly interact with the outside media, realizing the chemical substance identi cation or liquid acoustic impedance sensing.\n[ ] [ ]\nPage 5/16\nExperimental setup of OMTDA system Incorporating the Al- ber, a high resolution OMTDA con guration is used to realize distributed optomechanical sensing, which is demonstrated in Fig.\u00a02. A narrow linewidth laser of 1550 nm is divided into two branches. In the upper branch with 90% laser, an activation pulse and a probing pulse end to end are generated to excite and probe the transverse acoustic waves successively in a coherent way using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). The sequential radio-frequency pulse signals are imposed onto the light wave through a double-sideband electro-optic modulator (EOM1) working under the suppressed carrier condition, and the light power is ampli ed by an erbium-doped ber ampli er (EDFA). Note a frequency interval f1 of 1.5 GHz is added to the activation pulse to remove the backward stimulated Brillouin scattering (BSBS) interaction between the activation pulse and the detecting light. After being modulated, the activation pulse contains four frequency components distributed symmetrically in pairs with the carrier component. According to Ref. [17], the probing pulse contains two frequency components with a frequency difference around the FSBS resonance frequency. Meanwhile, in the lower branch, another EOM2 cooperating with a tunable optical lter (OF2) is employed to generate the continuous detecting light. By switching the frequency loaded on the EOM2 between the Brillouin gain regions of the two sidebands contained by the probing pulse, the intensity evolution along the sensing ber of the upper and lower sidebands are recorded via BSBS successively. Then, with the frequency difference between the probing pulse swept around the resonance frequency of the acoustic wave, the localized FSBS spectrum can be scanned and demodulated by applying differential calculation of the energy accumulation.\nResults And Discussion\nSensing bers spectra analysis The acoustic mode distributions of specially coated optical bers are investigated. The experimental results of Al- ber and uncoated-SMF are rst compared. The diameter of the Al- ber core and cladding are 8.9 and 125.5 \u00b5m, respectively, and the aluminized coating thickness is ~ 20 \u00b5m. The measured FSBS spectra with the frequency range from 10 to 500 MHz of Al- ber and uncoated-SMF are shown in Fig.\u00a03(a). Since the aluminized coating acts as an acoustic eld propagation medium with quasi-acoustic impedance matching condition corresponding to a larger acoustic wave oscillation diameter, the FSBS in Al- ber has a discrete spectra distribution similar to that of the uncoated-SMF but with a relative decrease in resonance frequency spacing (~ 36.76 MHz) of each acoustic mode. Note that the spectrum becomes narrower, as the resonance frequency decreases. The resonance frequencies corresponding to R0,1~R0,14 modes obtained from both calculations and experiments are deposited in Table\u00a01. A decent consistency between the calculations and experiments veri es the feasibility of replacing the FUT of OMTDA with Alber.\nPage 6/16\nFor comparison, the PI- bers with the same cladding diameter but with distinct coating thicknesses (~ 17.1 \u00b5m for PI- ber1 and ~ 13.8 \u00b5m for PI- ber2) are chosen as FUTs and shown in Fig.\u00a03(b). Severe intensity distortions of the spectra distribution are inspected resulted from the coating thickness difference of ~ 3 \u00b5m. Speci cally, the acoustic impedance mismatch between silica and polyimide results in a relatively equivalent acoustic re ection (rsi \u2212 PI = ~ 0.57) and transmission at the cladding-coating interface, which eventually results in the interference induced acoustic wave cancellation or enhancement. Consequently, the thickness and uniformity of the coating can interfere with the performance of FSBS sensors using PI- bers. Nonetheless, the re ection at the interface is negligible when the aluminized layer is applied as the optical ber coating, avoiding the interference of the acoustic wave, leaving the system with higher robustness to coating parameters. Humidity characteristics of aluminized optical ber Apart from the irregular FSBS spectra distribution, the PI-coatings tend to absorb water when humidity is considered, which may further impact the FSBS spectra measurements. These drawbacks are fully conquered by involving Al- ber. In order to verify the non-sensitivity of FSBS in Al- ber to RH, the 15 m FUTs are placed in a temperature and humidity-controlled device with a stable temperature of 30 \u00b0C. The RH is changed from 4 %RH to 9 %RH with a step of 1 %RH. The FSBS spectrum of R0,6 mode is measured\nPage 7/16\nby the OMTDA system, as depicted in Fig.\u00a04. Note that the acoustic mode R0,6 is chosen in accordance with the previous investigation by reason of its higher FSBS e ciency and suitable linewidth in Al- ber. The central frequency and the linewidth of each spectrum are calculated to be around 209.41 MHz and 1.73 MHz, respectively. The six sets of FSBS spectra show a high degree of consistency with slight uctuations around the base. The average SNR of them reaches 34.01 dB for the strictly constrained acoustic wave within the whole cross-section resulting from the severe acoustic impedance mismatch between Al-coating and air. The SNR uctuation between the measurement sets is blown at 7.58 dB. Furthermore, the measurements of FSBS spectra at each humidity are repeated 5 times. And their central frequencies and linewidths extracted through Lorentz tting are demonstrated in Fig.\u00a05. Because of the enhanced SNR of OMTDA, the uncertainty values in frequency shift and linewidth are controlled below \u00b10.01 MHz and \u00b10.02 MHz, respectively. Meanwhile, the average frequency difference between the measurements under different humidity is 15.6 kHz, while the maximum linewidth difference equals 35.2 kHz. Both are smaller than the intrinsic measurement uncertainties. Hence, the FSBS in Al- ber is considered to be independent of humidity variation owing to the promptly formation of a dense oxidation lm outside the aluminum coating that protects the sensing ber from external relative humidity variations, which reveals the optomechanical sensing more robust adaptation to chemical or liquid sensing. Distributed substance identi cation The distributed measurement of the external environmental substance acoustic impedance is investigated. Firstly, Al- bers with the length of 15 m are used as the FUTs, placed loosely in the air without intrinsic torsional strain. The frequency of the beat created by both activation pulse and probing pulse is swept from 204 MHz to 215 MHz to cover the resonance frequency of R0,6 induced FSBS with a ne step of 0.01 MHz. In detail, the pulse width of the activation pulse is set as 1.5 \u00b5s to avoid the spectrum broadening from transient excitation of the transverse acoustic wave. The width of the probing pulse followed is 20 ns for relatively high-resolution sensing. OMTDA records the energy transfer accumulated over the propagation of the probing pulse. The local FSBS spectra can be demodulated via a differential process where a smoothing window is applied to enhance the SNR. Here, a smoothing window of 2 m is applied to represent the spatial resolution of the measurement.\nThe scanned 3D spectra distribution is shown in Fig.\u00a06(a). The re ection ratio between the Al coating and air interface approaches rAl \u2212 air \u2248 1. The linewidth of the FSBS spectra of the air environment is determined mainly by the intrinsic acoustic loss. Then, the middle 4 m of the Al- bers are laid in deionized water while the rest are kept in the air. The FSBS-induced energy transfer e ciency in water is decreased due to a larger acoustic impedance of water (1.483\u00d7106 kg/(m2\u22c5s)) [16], resulting in modest peak intensity and a broadened line shape. The distributed linewidth of the FSBS spectra is calculated by Lorentz- tting and plotted in Fig.\u00a06(c), in which an abrupt step advent at the center of the FUTs indicating the change of the external environment. The spectrum linewidth representing air surrounding is below 1.9 MHz while that in the water environment is around 3.3 MHz. The linewidth uctuations in the two regions are both con ned below 0.22 MHz, indicating a reliable distinction in acoustic impedance sensing. In\nPage 8/16\naddition, the FSBSs at 2.5 m and 7.5 m are visualized in Fig.\u00a06(d). The representative linewidths of FSBS spectra corresponding to air and water surroundings are 1.72 MHz and 3.41 MHz respectively.\nConclusion In conclusion, a distributed optomechanical sensor with stable performance and high robustness has been proposed for the external environmental substance and acoustic impedance identi cation. we use the Aluminized coating optical ber, for the rst time, to excite transverse acoustic waves via the FSBS effect, which could low-loss transmit through the cladding-coating boundary to the coating layer or even the ambient media due to the quasi-acoustic impedance matching. The Aluminized coating is not only signi cantly enhanced the sensing ber\u2019s mechanical properties and strength but also to protect the sensing ber from changes in external relative humidity. Meanwhile, the coherent stimulated probing process and the more signi cant difference in acoustic impedance between the Al- ber and the external material both enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured FSBS signal. The experimental results clearly show that the resonance frequency and linewidth of the FSBS spectra of Al- ber are extremely insensitive to RH, which is an obvious advantage over the PI- ber. Finally, the material recognition ability of the distributed acoustic impedance sensing is demonstrated by identifying the air and water surrounding the ber under test with a spatial resolution of 2 m. Such a novel sensor will be suitable for chemical sensing elds such as oil pipeline leakage and marine pollutant detection, and simultaneous temperature and acoustic impedance sensing.\nAbbreviations"
