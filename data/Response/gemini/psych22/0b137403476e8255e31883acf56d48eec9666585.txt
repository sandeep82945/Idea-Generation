1. **Investigate the impact of humility on team performance in virtual teams with different cultural backgrounds.** This study focused on a sample of students from a single university in Hong Kong, China. It would be interesting to see if the results would hold true for teams with members from different cultural backgrounds. For example, in cultures where humility is considered a virtue, team members may be more likely to exhibit humility and, as a result, experience higher levels of team performance.


2. **Examine the relationship between humility and shared leadership in virtual teams over time.** This study was cross-sectional, meaning that data were collected at a single point in time. It would be valuable to conduct a longitudinal study to examine how humility and shared leadership change over time and how these changes are related to team performance. For example, it is possible that humility may become more important for team performance as teams become more familiar with each other and develop a stronger sense of trust.


3. **Explore the role of humility in virtual teams that are geographically dispersed.** This study focused on virtual teams that were all located in the same city. It would be interesting to see if the results would hold true for teams that are geographically dispersed. For example, in geographically dispersed teams, team members may have less opportunity to interact with each other face-to-face, which could make it more difficult to build trust and rapport. As a result, humility may play an even more important role in these teams.


4. **Investigate the relationship between humility and shared leadership in virtual teams that are tasked with different types of work.** This study focused on virtual teams that were tasked with completing a single project. It would be interesting to see if the results would hold true for teams that are tasked with different types of work, such as ongoing projects or tasks that require a high degree of creativity. For example, in teams that are tasked with ongoing projects, humility may be more important for maintaining team cohesion and preventing conflict.


5. **Examine the relationship between humility and shared leadership in virtual teams that are led by different types of leaders.** This study did not consider the role of the leader in the relationship between humility and shared leadership. It would be interesting to see if the results would hold true for teams that are led by different types of leaders, such as humble leaders, authoritarian leaders, or laissez-faire leaders. For example, in teams that are led by humble leaders, humility may be more likely to spread to other team members, leading to higher levels of shared leadership and team performance.
