1. **Investigate the impact of buyer heterogeneity on information disclosure.** The paper assumes that all buyers have the same estimation bias and prior beliefs about seller qualities. However, in reality, buyers may have different levels of knowledge and experience with sharing systems, which could lead to different estimation biases and prior beliefs. It would be interesting to explore how buyer heterogeneity affects sellers' information disclosure strategies and the overall market equilibrium.
2. **Analyze the effects of information disclosure on buyer trust.** The paper assumes that buyers trust sellers who disclose more information. However, it is possible that buyers may also be skeptical of sellers who disclose too much information, as they may perceive it as a sign of desperation or dishonesty. It would be interesting to explore how information disclosure affects buyer trust and how this, in turn, affects sellers' profits.
3. **Examine the role of reputation in information disclosure.** The paper does not consider the role of reputation in information disclosure. However, in reality, sellers may have reputations for being honest and trustworthy, or for being dishonest and untrustworthy. It would be interesting to explore how reputation affects sellers' information disclosure strategies and the overall market equilibrium.
4. **Develop a dynamic model of information disclosure.** The paper presents a static model of information disclosure. However, in reality, information disclosure is likely to be a dynamic process, with sellers and buyers learning from each other over time. It would be interesting to develop a dynamic model of information disclosure to capture this learning process and explore its implications for the market equilibrium.
5. **Apply the model to a specific sharing system.** The paper presents a general model of information disclosure in sharing systems. However, it would be interesting to apply the model to a specific sharing system, such as Airbnb or Uber, to see how the model's predictions hold up in practice. This could provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners who are interested in regulating or designing sharing systems.
