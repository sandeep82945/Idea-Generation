In 2013, a further multiscale, time-dependent state, \u2018elasto-inertial\u2019 turbulence (EIT), was found which differs from Newtonian turbulence (NT) in being predominantly two-dimensional and seems to require finite Reynolds number (Re = O(103)) and Weissenberg number Wi = O(10) to exist (Dubief, Terrapon & Soria 2013; Samanta et al. 2013; Sid, Terrapon & Dubief 2018). Understanding exactly how these different types of turbulence relate to each other remains an outstanding challenge. Work at the NT\u2013EIT interface has so far focussed on the possible sustenance of elastically modified Tollmien\u2013Schlichting waves at least for very dilute solutions and weak elasticity (Shekar et al. 2019, 2020). Our focus here is the possible relationship between EIT and ET: are they two extremes of one whole (Samanta et al. 2013; Qin et al. 2019; Choueiri et al. 2021; Steinberg 2021) or distinct flow responses (see, e.g., figure 30 of Chaudhary et al. (2021) and figures 21 and 22 of Datta et al. (2021)). Finding the dynamical origin for either could help in resolving this question.\nThe very recent discovery of a new linear instability in dilute viscoelastic rectilinear flows at high Wi = O(20) (in pipes by Garg et al. (2018) and channels by Khalid et al. (2021a)) seems highly relevant. Such \u2018straight\u2019 flows had always been believed linearly stable due to the absence of curved streamlines (see, e.g., Chaudhary et al. (2019, 2021), Datta et al. (2021) and Castillo-Sanchez et al. (2022) for extensive discussions of this) although there had been some evidence of instability to finite-amplitude disturbances at low Re (Bertola et al. 2003; Pan et al. 2013; Choueiri et al. 2021; Jha & Steinberg 2021). Significantly, the neutral curve for this instability lies in a region of the (Wi,Re) parameter space between where EIT and ET are believed to exist. The instability was initially only found above Re \u2248 63 in pipe flow in the Oldroyd-B model (Garg et al. 2018; Chaudhary et al. 2021), suggesting that it needs some inertia to function. However, the corresponding instability in channel flow was found to have no such finite-Re threshold, although for Oldroyd-B fluids, the instability is restricted to ultra dilute solutions with \u03b2 0.99, and very large Wi = O(103) (Khalid et al. 2021a; Khalid, Shankar & Subramanian 2021b). Subsequently, these conditions have been relaxed to a more physically relevant critical Wi 110 at \u03b2 \u2248 0.98, by limiting the maximum extension of the polymers (Lmax = 70) in a FENE-P model (Buza, Page & Kerswell 2022). This suggests that a purely elastic instability can smoothly morph into an elasto-inertial instability, where inertia plays a role but the instability is found to only derive its energy through elastic terms. This remains the case even as high as Re = O(1000) (Buza et al. 2022). While this new instability is active for a wide range of parameter values, it does not appear to overlap with areas where either EIT or ET have been found, consistently appearing at much higher Wi at a given Re. Therefore, the question of its relevance to these nonlinear states remains open.\nA key issue is whether the branch of travelling wave (TW) solutions which emerge from the neutral curve is subcritical and so exist down to some saddle node at Weissenberg number Wisn below the critical value Wic, thereby potentially connecting the instability to either EIT and/or ET in parameter space. Page, Dubief & Kerswell (2020) demonstrated the existence of substantial subcriticality albeit at Re = 60 (and \u03b2 = 0.9) where Wisn = 8.8 is much lower than Wic = 26.7. Despite EIT not existing at this low Re, the upper branch TWs found there clearly resembled the \u2018arrowhead\u2019 states found in the simulations of Dubief et al. (2022) at Re = 1000 when EIT was annealed by increasing the elasticity. Weakly nonlinear analysis (in the channel by Buza et al. (2022) and pipe flow by Wan, Sun & Zhang (2021)) has confirmed the general subcritical nature of the instability but cannot give global information about how far Wisn(Re, \u03b2) is below Wic(Re, \u03b2). Our purpose here\n951 A3-2\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nis to answer this by performing an investigation using branch continuation to track where the TWs exist in (Wi,Re, \u03b2)-parameter space. This turns out to be feasible, as a branch continuation procedure based on solving an algebraic set of equations derived directly from the governing equations is much more efficient than branch continuing using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) code as done in Page et al. (2020). There are two reasons for this. First, the TW is highly symmetric: it is two-dimensional and has a symmetry around the channel\u2019s midplane. Second, far fewer degrees of freedom are needed to resolve the flow algebraically compared with the number needed to keep a time-stepping code stable. For example, the algebraic formulation needs only \u224850 Chebyshev modes in the cross-stream direction for convergence at the parameters considered while the DNS code needs \u2248128 modes to remain time stable. There have been previous theoretical attempts to generate nonlinear solutions to viscoelastic flow in channels and pipes but without an anchoring bifurcation point. These have centred on constructing a high-order expansion assuming the solution is dominantly streamwise and temporally monochromatic and taking the leading state to be one of the least-damped linear modes of the base state (Meulenbroek et al. 2003; Morozov & Saarloos 2005; Morozov & van Saarloos 2019).\nThis approach has produced some interesting signs of convergence with an increasing number of terms included in the expansion. In particular, by taking expansions up to 11th order in the amplitude, Morozov & Saarloos (2005) and Morozov & van Saarloos (2019) (plane Couette and channel flow, respectively) see apparent convergence to non-trivial TW solutions in creeping (Re 1) flows of upper-convected Maxwell (UCM) fluids (\u03b2 = 0) as well as Oldroyd-B fluids at low \u03b2. The branch continuation used here is similar in spirit but closer to classical weakly nonlinear theory, and differs in two significant ways: (1) it is firmly rooted in the neutral curve found by Khalid et al. (2021a), i.e. the zero-amplitude limit smoothly leads to the neutral curve (unknown in Morozov & van Saarloos 2019); and (2) the order of the expansion is taken as high as necessary (typically 50\u201380 Fourier modes) to obtain convergence.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly recaps the formulation of viscoelastic channel flow described in our earlier work (Buza et al. 2022). Section 3 then outlines the branch continuation approach, with the technical details relegated to a series of Appendices. The results are presented in two sections: \u00a7 4 considers finite inertia Re > 0 and \u00a7 5 deals with inertialess flows at Re = 0. Section 4 exclusively concentrates on \u03b2 = 0.9 and considers how the subcritical TW branches behave as: (1) Re varies over the range Re \u2208 [0, 3000]; and (2) as the domain size varies at Re = 30. For the analysis of creeping flow in \u00a7 5 at Re = 0, we explore the existence of the TWs over the (Wi, \u03b2) plane for \u03b2 \u2208 [0.5, 1) and Wi < 50 and Lmax \u2208 {70, 100, 500}, the maximum polymer extensibility in the FENE-P model. Morozov (2022) has concurrently found TWs in viscoelastic channel flow at Re = 0.01 by the complementary approach of time stepping in the Phan\u2013Thien\u2013Tanner model. These waves correspond to the attracting upper branch of the curves shown here. Finally, a discussion follows in \u00a7 6."

The Schmidt number Sc, appearing solely in the polymer diffusion term and defined as the ratio between the solvent kinematic viscosity and polymer diffusivity (Sid et al. 2018), is typically of the order of O(106) in physical applications. In this work, enhanced diffusion (i.e. lower Sc) had to be employed to regularize the hyperbolic equation (2.1c), as is customarily done in other works involving viscoelastic DNS (Sid et al. 2018; Dubief et al. 2022). This is also necessitated by the spectral methods embedded in our branch continuation scheme, which behave slightly worse than finite-difference methods in this respect, pushing the maximum admissible Schmidt number down to Sc = 250 from typically 1000 (cf. Dubief et al. (2022) and Appendix C).\nEquation (2.1) is supplemented with non-slip boundary conditions on the velocity field.

First, the steady, one-dimensional base state \u03d5b( y; Wi,Re, \u03b2) is solved for numerically at a given Wi, Re and \u03b2 (with other model parameters such as Lmax suppressed for clarity).

The resulting nonlinear, complex, algebraic system of equations comprising (3.11), (3.12) and (3.13) reads\nF(a, c,FX; k,Wi,Re, \u03b2, Sc) = 0, (3.14) where a = vec((anm) ).

Steady states of interest may now be extracted from (3.14) using a Newton\u2013Raphson root finding scheme given a good enough initial guess. The neutral curve found by Khalid et al. (2021a) and the weakly nonlinear analysis in Buza et al. (2022) are used to generate this initially. Then pseudo arclength continuation (see Appendix A) is used to proceed along the solution branch to higher amplitudes away from the neutral curve.\nSimulations were typically run at (NX,Ny) = (50, 60) where Q \u2248 43 000 real degrees of freedom or (NX,Ny) = (40, 50) (Q \u2248 29 000), depending on the complexity of the tracked states, with occasional grid-convergence checks at much higher resolutions up to (NX,Ny) = (80, 80) (Q \u2248 91 000); see Appendix B. In general, lower branch solutions were less resolution dependent, and required about half the Fourier modes of their upper branch counterparts. The minimum requirement for the number of Chebyshev modes, Ny, was around 40 across all parameter regimes, with a slight increase to 50 around saddle-node points due to the suboptimal placement of collocation points for this region. Reducing the polymer diffusion increases the requirements both in NX and Ny, and adjustments in k, the domain size, necessitate equivalent adjustments in NX .\n3.2. Direct numerical simulations The Dedalus codebase (Burns et al. 2020) was used to time step (2.1) in order to examine the stability of the TWs found. To allow this DNS code to interface seamlessly with the branch continuation code, the simulations were also performed on the half-channel using exactly the same symmetry boundary conditions described previously and using the same spectral expansions. This allowed an unstable lower branch solution of the branch continuation procedure to be used directly as an initial condition for the DNS and the fact that this remained steady under time-stepping provided a valuable cross-check of the two approaches.\nIn the DNS, the full state \u03d5 was minimally expanded into Nx = 128 Fourier modes in the periodic x-direction and into Ny = 128 Chebyshev modes in the wall-normal direction with higher resolutions of 256 and 512 available in either or both dimensions to check truncation robustness. The equations were advanced in time using a third-order semi-implicit backward differentiation formula (BDF) scheme (Wang & Ruuth 2008) and a constant timestep \u0394t = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123.\n951 A3-7\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n4. Results: TWs at finite Re for (\u03b2, Lmax, Sc) = (0.9, 500, 250) As in Page et al. (2020) and Buza et al. (2022), we fix \u03b2 = 0.9 and Lmax = 500 for the initial set of computations. The Schmidt number had to be chosen slightly smaller than that of Page et al. (2020) and Dubief et al. (2022) at Sc = 250 due to the considerations given in \u00a7 2 and Appendix C.\nUpon supplying the weakly nonlinear predictions as initial conditions to the continuation routine, any branch of solutions emanating from the neutral curve can be tracked starting directly from its bifurcation point. Three branches were launched downwards in Wi at fixed Re = 1000, 200 and 60, starting from their respective bifurcation points at kopt = 4.7, 2.7 and 1.8. These wave numbers are optimal in the sense of marginal stability and so do not necessarily minimise Wisn(Re, \u03b2), but do provide a good upper estimate of it. An additional, fourth branch was initialized from the lowest point on the neutral curve at Wi = 30 and kopt = 1.6, continued down to Re = 30 at fixed Wi, then, after a switch in direction, towards decreasing Wi at fixed Re. A schematic depiction of these branches is given in the left panel of figure 1.\nThe right panel of figure 1 shows the amplitude evolution of these four branches. As a measure of amplitude, we chose the volume-averaged trace of the polymer conformation relative to the laminar value, i.e.\nA := \u3008tr C\u3009\u03a9\u3008tr Cb\u3009\u03a9 , (4.1)\nagain, to remain consistent with Page et al. (2020). The lower Re branches of figure 1(b) are reminiscent of the branch shown in Page et al. (2020) (in fact, the green branch is at the same Reynolds number (Re = 60), albeit with different k and Sc), and the higher Re ones are lower-amplitude variants of these. This shrink in relative amplitude can be attributed to the increase in both Re and k, with the latter playing a non-negligible role through the accompanying change in domain size (see \u00a7 4.2).\nWe explore one of these states (the saddle node from the Re = 200 branch) further in figure 3, where we report the perturbation velocities as a fraction of the local base streamwise velocity, ub,X . The arrowhead of polymer stretch close to the centreline is\n951 A3-8\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nassociated with a backwards \u2018jet\u2019 in the perturbation streamwise velocity where the horizontal flow is locally slower than the base parallel solution. Both this and the contours of vertical velocity are consistent with the counter-rotating vortex pair observed by Morozov (2022) in the co-moving frame, and include a change in sign of \u2202yu\u0302y across a stagnation point leading to a locally extensional flow.\n951 A3-9\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n4.1. General interpretation of solution branches Qualitatively, all solution branches behave in a similar way. A sample case is depicted in figure 4, showcasing the main features. The lower branches emanating from the neutral curve are all unstable until reaching their respective saddle-node points, labeled by a variety of symbols in figure 1 (circle for our sample branch in figure 4), with the corresponding states shown in figure 2. Points on the (unstable) lower branches are found to be edge states which are attracting states on a codimension-one manifold separating two different basins of attraction (Skufca, Yorke & Eckhardt 2006; Duguet, Willis & Kerswell 2008; Schneider et al. 2008). This is illustrated by figure 4(b) at Wi = 20 and Re = 60 where an edge-tracking procedure, applied between the upper branch and laminar states, converges on the lower branch state. The lower branch state is a saddle but with only one unstable direction either pointing to the laminar or upper branch state. Upper branch states, at least Re = 60 (Page et al. 2020), start as stable nodes as Wi increases away from Wisn but quickly experience Hopf bifurcations to tertiary states (if the base state is the \u2018primary\u2019). These bifurcations and where these tertiary states lead are interesting questions beyond the scope of this paper.\nBased on these observations, we have the following picture: if the laminar state is disturbed with a perturbation large enough to reach a certain threshold, determined by the minimal amplitude of approach of the stable manifold of a lower branch state, the flow will evolve towards the upper branch, forming a stable TW. The threshold amplitude to trigger growth is bounded above by the amplitude of the lower branch state itself, which remains A < 1.05 across the domain of existence of TWs. In other words, this domain (shaded bright grey on figure 1) is nonlinearly unstable when subjected to finite but small amplitude disturbances.\n4.2. Influence of domain length This section is dedicated to studying the effect of k, and thus the influence of domain size [0, 2\u03c0/k], on the TWs. Figure 5 shows how a single branch of TWs at Re = 30 (purple in figure 1) changes with k. It has already been established that the steady arrowhead structure is highly sensitive to domain length in the EIT regime (Dubief et al. 2022). There, through\n951 A3-10\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ncapturing larger-scale motions, an increase in domain length was found to unveil structures of increasing complexity, with the possibility of inducing chaotic dynamics at certain parameter combinations. Similar tendencies can be observed in our case (cf. figure 5): An increase in k (and, thus, decrease in domain length) has a considerable weakening effect on the arrowhead structure, eventually resulting in a complete eradication of TWs and a subsequent relaminarization. Despite this observation, the location of the saddle-node points seems largely unaffected by k (cf. figure 5), making the marked \u2018nonlinearly unstable\u2019 region on figure 1 robust to changes in the assumed periodicity and domain size.\n4.3. High-elasticity regime: Re \u2192 0 The high-elasticity regime is difficult to access using time-stepping as it becomes increasing stiff as Re \u2192 0. The algebraic approach taken here suffers no such problems and we can approach and even consider Re = 0 (see the next section) without difficulty.\nThe existence of the centre-mode linear instability at Re = 0 is already known in the limit of very dilute polymer solutions (\u03b2 \u2192 1) for Wi = O(103) in Oldroyd-B fluids (Khalid et al. 2021b) and for Wi = O(102) in FENE-P fluids at finite extensibility (Lmax) (Buza et al. 2022). To substantiate its connection to ET, the time evolution of these growing modes has to be tracked to see whether they are able to produce turbulent behaviour, presumably after transitioning through a cascade of intermediate states. Our goal here is to see where the first level of intermediate state, the TWs, exist at low and vanishing Re.\nWeakly nonlinear theory predicts supercritical behaviour in the high elasticity (Wi/Re) regime, i.e. along the lower boundary of the linearly unstable region. To probe this, a fifth branch was initiated at fixed Wi = 60, starting upwards in Re as indicated by the weakly nonlinear analysis (Buza et al. 2022) from a marginally stable point in this region (indicated by orange on figure 1). The resulting branch of solutions is shown in figure 6. Given the supercriticality, this branch starts off as a stable node, moving up in Re. Almost immediately after leaving the initial bifurcation point (of linear stability), it reaches a saddle-node bifurcation point, turns around and proceeds to advance towards decreasing Re, maintaining a relatively low amplitude until reaching a second saddle\n951 A3-11\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nnode and transitioning to the upper branch. This is an example of how local information provided by weakly nonlinear analysis can be misleading. In fact, the neutral curve gives rise to TWs which reach to lower Wi at fixed Re and lower Re at fixed Wi as shown by figure 1. Upon further inspection, it turns out that the lower (secondary) fold shown in figure 6 at Re \u2248 30 is purely a feature of the polymer diffusion term 1/(Re Sc)\u0394C growing artificially large (as Re is decreased), the effect of which is already known to destroy small-scale dynamics (Dubief et al. 2022). It turns out that the point at which the saddle-node bifurcation occurs can be delayed arbitrarily by adjusting Sc in accordance with the variations in Re to keep the polymer diffusion finite. Numerical experimentation suggested a revised polymer diffusion term of the form\n\u03bb\nWi \u0394C, (4.2)\nfor some fixed number \u03bb. The choice of an inverse scaling with Wi is motivated by observations at Re = 0 shown in Appendix C. If \u03bb = 0.005 is enforced for the branch in question, which amounts to fixing the coefficient 1/(Re Sc) at the point marked by \u2018+\u2019 in figure 6, the branch of solutions can be followed down to Re = 0 along the lower branch (cf. the dashed line in figure 6)."

The resulting branch takes the familiar shape (from the Re > 0 cases) shown in figure 7, attaining its saddle-node bifurcation point at Wi \u2248 7.5, which serves as a lower bound for the region where TWs exist (note the waves found by Morozov (2022), at Re = 0 are all above Wi = 20, albeit with a different model). Figure 7 gives a detailed description of this branch, containing snapshots of full states that illustrate how these waves evolve as Wi is varied. Arrowhead-shaped structures are still clearly visible at low Wi (cf. panels on the left-hand side of figure 7), establishing their prevalence even in the high-elasticity regime. We also report the phase speed, c, of the inertialess TWs as a function of Wi in figure 7. Similar to the elasto-inertial case reported in Page et al. (2020), the phase speed is always faster than the bulk velocity. On the lower branch, c tends to a constant value which matches that of the linear eigenfunction. The phase speed of the upper branch solution\n951 A3-12\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nis notably slower, and is presumably set by the self-sustaining mechanism proposed by Morozov (2022).\nFor the particular case considered in figure 7 (specifically k = 1, Lmax = 500, \u03bb = 0.005) the stability of steady states was examined along the upper branch using DNS. At four points, Wi = 10, 20, 30 and 50, solutions of the branch continuation tool were transferred into the Dedalus-based DNS code, and were subsequently subjected to disturbances of finite amplitude. The perturbations were constructed from snapshots extracted from separate simulations of EIT at high-Re, which were pre-multiplied by 10\u22126 and added to the TWs. All perturbed states returned to their respective stable upper-branch solutions after a period of transient growth, suggesting that two-dimensional ET cannot be initiated from these TWs in a direct manner.\n5.1. \u03b2 \u2208 [0.5, 1): relation to recent experiments The first experiments claiming to see nonlinear instability in viscoelastic channel flow were performed by Arratia and colleagues (Pan et al. 2013; Qin & Arratia 2017;\n951 A3-13\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nQin et al. 2019). Finite-amplitude perturbations were induced by an array of obstacles placed upstream, with the number of obstacles serving as a measure of amplitude. Based on measurements taken further downstream, far away from the initial disturbances, they conclude the existence of a subcritical nonlinear instability that persists down to Wi \u2248 5.4. With the caveats that their channel had a square cross-section and FENE-P is an approximation, their results are encouragingly comparable to the two-dimensional channel prediction made here of Wisn = 7.5. In Figure S1 of the supplementary material to Pan et al. (2013), the authors indicated the boundary to the observed instability in a Wi versus perturbation amplitude plane, essentially matching our predictions for the threshold of nonlinear instability given by the Re = 0 lower branch (shown in the middle-right panel of figure 7) (that the unstable region in our case is bounded by the branch is an immediate consequence of the discussion in \u00a7 4.1: once the threshold amplitude of a lower branch edge state is reached, solutions continue to grow). However, in later proceedings, the authors claim that the unstable flow remains time dependent with features reminiscent of ET (Qin & Arratia 2017; Qin et al. 2019), as opposed to the upper branch TW scenario described here.\nMore recently, (Schnapp & Steinberg 2022) have experimentally examined the stability of viscoelastic channel flow to small disturbances using a channel of width-to-height ratio of 7. The viscosity ratio was \u03b2 = 0.74 and so significantly smaller than the above presented \u03b2 = 0.9. They describe seeing a complex transition which they call \u2018an elastic non-normal mode instability\u2019 characterised by the direct transition to many modes at once. This is different from a modal instability of a TW solution discussed here but may also be the effect of a comparatively large initial disturbance so the transition is immediately strongly nonlinear. Other recent experiments by Choueiri et al. (2021) in a pipe have also considered smaller \u03b2 = 0.57 albeit at larger Re. Motivated by this, we also performed a few TW branch continuations (at Wi = 10, 20, 30 and 50) with decreasing \u03b2 in an attempt to map out the nonlinearly unstable domain in the Wi\u2013\u03b2 plane (all with zero inertia). Results from these computations are shown in figure 8, with the left panel indicating the unstable region and the right panel containing the solution branches found with varying \u03b2. It transpires that at lower \u03b2, the solutions are a little more sensitive to the artificial diffusion (see Appendix C for further details), necessitating multiple simulations at different \u03bb values, all of which are also shown in figure 8.\nFigure 9 tracks changes in the lower branch TW amplitude, which is an upper bound on the threshold for growth, as Wi is increased. For the parameter combination in question (\u03b2 = 0.74, Re = 0), both our standard amplitude measure A and a separate measure for the magnitude of velocity perturbations, \u2016u\u0302\u2016L2(\u03a9), are shown. For Wi > 30, A remains below 1.005, implying that perturbations amounting to just 0.5 % of the laminar conformation field tr Cb are sufficient to trigger growth, making this scenario practically indistinguishable from a linearly unstable one. Here A reaches its minimum roughly around Wi = 100, then, despite setting off in an increasing trend, remains negligibly small up to Wi = 500.\nIn addition to the solution branch, figure 9 also displays two state plots at Wi = 20 and Wi = 407, now in terms of u\u0302X/ub,X to aid comparison with experimental results. The former, at Wi = 20, still resembles the structural composition of the linearly unstable centre eigenmode at higher Re: chevron-shaped streaks remain visible, but are now disconnected at the centreline. However, by Wi = 407 (and similarly for all Wi > 100 lower branch states), these structures straighten out and form streamwise counter-propagating streaks placed symmetrically around the centreline.\n951 A3-14\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n951 A3-15\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nIn their pipe set-up, Choueiri et al. (2021) detected fluctuations at Re \u2248 5 for \u03b2 = 0.57, Wi = 104 while the flow remained laminar at Re \u2248 3. Computationally, the Re = 0 branch may be continued to \u03b2 = 0.57 (for \u03bb sufficiently small) in our channel flow setting (cf. figure 8 again), albeit with a slightly larger threshold amplitude than that of figure 9. This may explain the need for a finite Re for \u2018unperturbed\u2019 instabilities (Choueiri et al. 2021). Interestingly, the flow states shown by Choueiri et al. (2021) have the connected, chevron-shaped streaks reminiscent of the centre-mode eigenfunction. In our setting, \u2018connectedness\u2019 of the chevrons is lost shortly after leaving the initial bifurcation (the general shape is still retained for moderate Wi, see the middle panel of figure 9), but the scenario could be quite different in pipes.\n5.2. Lmax \u2208 {70, 100, 500} For completeness, the effect of varying the last outstanding parameter, Lmax, on the region of nonlinear instability is depicted in figure 10. In contrast to the observations of Buza et al. (2022), which indicated that lowering Lmax has a destabilizing role in the elastically dominated regime (cf. their figure 13), here we see that the nonlinearly unstable region shrinks with decreasing Lmax. This suppressing effect is in line with past observations of the effect of finite extensibility; see, e.g., the linear analyses in Ray & Zaki (2014), Page & Zaki (2015) or even figure 16 of Buza et al. (2022). It should be noted that, in our experience, solution branches became difficult to extract at lower Lmax, with convergence issues appearing along upper branches. In fact, we can only reliably obtain upper branches for Lmax > 150, but lower branches remain accessible due to their lower resolution requirements (see Appendix B)."

            "text": "In this paper, we have used branch continuation to track two-dimensional, finite-amplitude TWs in a viscoelastic channel flow, using the FENE-P model. The TWs are borne out of the centre mode instability (Khalid et al. 2021a) which is known to be subcritical over large areas of the Re \u2212 Wi parameter space (Buza et al. 2022). Here, we have shown that the TW solution branches extend to significantly lower Re and Wi than the curve of\n951 A3-16\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 2.\n83 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nmarginal stability. For instance, we showed that the saddle node at Re = 1000 drops as low as Wi \u2248 25, while the associated linear instability at this Re does not occur until Wi \u2248 80. Most significantly, we demonstrated the persistence of the nonlinear TWs at Re = 0 for a large range of Wi, with the saddle node sitting at Wi \u2248 7.5\u201310 in dilute (\u03b2 = 0.9) solutions for a range of Lmax. Across a broad range of the parameter space, including at Re = 0, the upper branch TWs resemble the arrowhead structures observed in DNS at higher Re (Page et al. 2020; Dubief et al. 2022).\nA key feature of the solution branch at Re = 0 is the low amplitude of the lower branch TW across a very large range of Wi. This suggests that only a very weak disturbance would be required to cause the flow to transition to a potentially complicated time-dependent state, a scenario which would potentially be indistinguishable from a linear instability in an experiment. The small amplitude of the lower branch also poses the question whether the amplitude expansion pursued in Morozov & Saarloos (2005) and Morozov & van Saarloos (2019) was attempting to resolve it; see, e.g., figure 8(c) of Morozov & van Saarloos (2019).\nWhile our results demonstrate the existence of finite-amplitude arrowhead TWs over a very large range of the parameter space, a direct connection to either EIT or ET has yet to be established even within the same FENE-P model. In inertia-dominated EIT at Reynolds numbers Re = O(1000), instantaneous arrowhead-shaped flow structures resembling the stable upper branch states have been observed numerically (Dubief et al. 2022). While the region of nonlinear instability found here overlaps with these observations, further work is required to assess if there is a direct connection between the exact coherent states and EIT (e.g. through a sequence of successive bifurcations). The picture is complicated by observations from both numerics and experiments at higher Re, where near-wall activity has been observed to be dominant in both channels and pipes (Shekar et al. 2019, 2020; Choueiri et al. 2021). At present, no exact coherent states connected to other linear instabilities (e.g. Tollmien\u2013Schlichting waves in channels, see Shekar et al. 2019) have been discovered, and the possible role of such states in EIT remains an interesting open problem. At low Re, our numerical experiments indicate that the upper branch TWs are linearly stable, and we have been unable to trigger ET. Our computations have been restricted to two-dimensional flows, and so this does not rule out the existence of ET in three dimensions, or a direct route from the upper branch TWs to such a state. We hope to report results on this soon.\nAcknowledgements.

Beyond this point, as parameters are varied in larger increments, supplying sufficiently accurate initial conditions for (3.14) amounts to predicting the shape of the bifurcation branch, precisely the objective of pseudo-arclength continuation (see, e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2014).\nIf \u03ba \u2208 {Wi,Re, \u03b2} is the parameter allowed to vary in the continuation (all others are fixed), F restricts to a map F : RQ+1 \u2192 RQ and (3.14) translates to\nF(a, c,FX, \u03ba) = 0. (A1) Arclength-based techniques interpret the branch of solutions as a curve \u03b3 : R \u2192 RQ+1 embedded in configuration space, which is spanned by (a, c,FX, \u03ba) in this particular case. Assume now that a steady state has been computed at point n on the branch \u03b3 , which we write as \u03b3 (tn) = (an, cn,FX,n, \u03ban)T. A prediction for the solution at the next step, \u03b3 (tn+1), is given by moving a distance of s tangentially along \u03b3 , where s denotes the a priori specified step size. Making use of the fact that a solution branch must satisfy F \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2261 0, the tangent at point n is computed according to(\nDF(\u03b3 (tn)) \u03b3\u0307 (tn\u22121)T\n) \u03b3\u0307 (tn) = ( 0 1 ) .

The next step is to employ the Newton\u2013Raphson method using (A3) as initial condition to obtain an exact solution of (A1). Knowledge of the tangent may be used to aid this procedure, by means of constraining subsequent iterates to remain on the hyperplane orthogonal to \u03b3\u0307 (tn). Incorporating this condition into a standard Newton\u2013Raphson scheme, we obtain the system(\nDF(\u03b3\u0303 i(tn+1)) \u03b3\u0307 (tn)T\n) \u0394\u03b3\u0303 i+1(tn+1) = ( \u2212F(\u03b3\u0303 i(tn+1))\ns \u2212 \u3008\u03b3\u0307 (tn), \u03b3\u0303 i(tn+1)\u2212 \u03b3 (tn)\u3009\n) , (A4)\nsupplemented with the update rule\n\u03b3\u0303 i+1(tn+1) = \u03b3\u0303 i(tn+1)+ \u0394\u03b3\u0303 i+1(tn+1). (A5) Once the solutions have converged to a sufficient degree, i.e.\n|\u0394\u03b3\u0303 i+1(tn+1)| |\u03b3\u0303 i(tn+1)| < tol, (A6)\nis reached, we set \u03b3 (tn+1) = \u03b3\u0303 i+1(tn+1), and continue further along the branch. The tolerance \u2018tol\u2019 was set to 10\u22128 throughout all examples shown.

Further discrepancies for the higher-order modes may be caused by the finite accuracy of the edge tracking algorithm in locating the lower branch."

Thus, Sc was selected between the two of these bounds: just above the smallest number where solution branches become independent of Sc, but resolution requirements are still moderate enough for the physical memory to handle.\nIn the creeping flow limit (Re \u2192 0), a distinguished limit with Sc \u2192 \u221e such that Sc = 1/(\u03b5Re) with \u03b5 a constant clearly needs to be taken to retain finite polymer diffusion as follows \u2202tC + (u \u00b7 \u2207)C + T (C) = C \u00b7 \u2207u + (\u2207u)T \u00b7 C + \u03b5\u0394C.

Using \u03bb, robustness is recovered after a certain threshold is hit (\u03bb \u2248 0.007 for this branch), which served as the primary motivation behind choosing \u03bb as the parameter to be fixed throughout the main text."
