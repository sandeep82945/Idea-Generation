 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop nonlinear soft sensors using methods like neural networks or support vector regression to estimate product compositions in highly nonlinear processes like batch distillation. The current work uses linear PCR models which may not capture nonlinear behavior well.

2. Explore using different process variables besides tray temperatures, such as tray pressures or compositions, to develop soft sensors. This could improve estimation accuracy. 

3. Test the inferential ADRC control method on an actual pilot or industrial scale distillation column to evaluate real-world performance. The current work is simulation-based.

4. Extend the inferential ADRC approach to multicomponent distillation systems with more than 2 products. This would require developing soft sensors for multiple product compositions.

5. Investigate adaptive techniques to automatically tune the ADRC controller parameters online based on process changes. This could enhance robustness and adaptability.
