    "abstractText": "The illicit use of fentanyl has led to hundreds of thousands of opioid-related deaths worldwide. Therefore, the detection of fentanyl by law enforcement and recreational users is of utmost importance. However, current detection methods are expensive, time-consuming, require special storage conditions, and necessitate complex instrumentation that is generally unportable and requires skilled personnel to operate. An alternative approach would be using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as the recognition component of a handheld sensor, testing strip, or color-based assay. In this work, a molecularly imprinted polymer was constructed using the functional monomer methacrylic acid (MAA) and the cross-linking monomer ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), with benzylfentanyl (Bfen) as the template. The use of benzylfentanyl is advantageous because it closely mimics fentanyl\u2019s structure but does not cause any physiological narcotic effects. Important studies herein determined the optimum ratio of the template/functional monomer, with subsequent evaluations of selectivity of the MIP for the template and fentanyl versus the commonly encountered narcotics such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. The data obtained from the HPLC analysis showed that the Bfen-MIP was successful in selectively binding the template and actual fentanyl, better than other common narcotics.",

            "text": "Fentanyl is used in clinical settings to manage severe pain in cases such as cancer patients or after surgery. However, it is increasingly being used illicitly, either as a standalone drug or combined with other substances such as cocaine, heroin, or counterfeit prescription pills, which can result in unintentional overdoses and fatalities [1,2]. The illicit use of fentanyl has led to a surge in opioid-related deaths worldwide due in part to the fact that fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, and just a small amount (approximately 2 mg) can be lethal. In the United States, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported over 70,000 deaths from overdoses involving fentanyl in 2021. Canada has also seen a significant increase in fentanyl-related deaths, with greater than 75% of all opioid deaths post-2020 due to fentanyl [3]. While there are fewer but significant numbers of deaths in Europe and the rest of the world, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has put out warnings regarding rampant fentanyl diffusion in different areas of Europe as well as the presence of new formulations of fentanyl analogs, with some of them up to 10,000 times more potent than morphine [4]. Addressing the fentanyl problem requires a multifaceted approach, including strategies to reduce the availability of illicit fentanyl through law enforcement efforts, improving access to treatment for opioid addiction, and increasing public awareness of the dangers of fentanyl. Additionally, there is a need for improved detection and analytical methods to identify fentanyl for law enforcement or for the detection of fentanyl contamination in other\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3669. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15183669 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3669 2 of 11\ndrugs. Current methods of detection and analysis of fentanyl and its analogs involve various spectroscopic or chromatographic techniques such as LC-HRMS [5], SPME-GC-MS [6], GC-IR [7], GC-ECD [8], LC-UV [9], IMS [10], and other methods [11\u201313]. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, require large instrumentation that is generally unportable, and necessitate skilled individuals to carry out the test procedures. Other methods for visual and sensitive detection include surfactant-based colorimetric tests [14,15], electrochemical sensors [16,17], and immunoassays, for instance, ELISAs, EMITs, and LFAs [18]. Recently, antibody-based fentanyl test strips (FTSs) have attracted attention due to their small size, portability, and simplicity of use; however, antibodies suffer from poor stability under varying conditions, prolonged manufacture times, and can provide false-positive responses. The development of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as the molecular recognition component for fentanyl sensors and separations is a promising advancement in this area. MIPs are very stable and can maintain their recognition properties for decades, even when exposed to high or low temperatures, different solvents, and variable humidity. Moreover, MIPs are inexpensive and can be adjusted chemically to maximize performance characteristics. The synthesis of MIPs begins with the formation of a complex between a targeted template molecule (e.g., fentanyl) and monomer(s), which is most easily accomplished via noncovalent interactions by simply mixing these components in a solvent (Scheme 1). The complex is polymerized, and the template is removed by simple extraction to leave cavities in the polymer that are imprinted to match the shape of the template and provide functional groups in a complementary interactive array to the template. There have been two previous reports of molecular imprinting of fentanyl, the earliest describing a fentanyl-imprinted silicate xerogel developed for extraction based assays that exhibited an increase in adsorbed fentanyl versus nonimprinted xerogel materials with selectivity versus donepezil [19].

Current methods of detection and analysis of fentanyl and its analogs involve various spectroscopic or chromatographic techniques such as LC-HRMS [5], SPME-GC-MS [6], GC-IR [7], GC-ECD [8], LC-UV [9], IMS [10], and other methods [11\u2013 13]. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, require large instrumentation that is generally unportable, and necessitate skilled individuals to carry out the test procedures. Other methods for visual and sensitive detection include surfactant-based colorimetric tests [14,15], electrochemical sensors [16,17], and immunoassays, for instance, ELISAs, EMITs, and LFAs [18].

            "text": "There are a number of variables that affect the optimization of selective binding by the BFen-MIP, such as the template/functional monomer ratio, particle size, mobile phase composition, and flow rate. Each of these parameters was evaluated in turn before the final evaluation of binding and selectivity of fentanyl, its analogs, and select narcotics often found laced with fentanyl or its derivatives.\n3.1.1. Optimization of Template/Functional Monomer Ratio\nThe first variable investigated was the optimum template/functional monomer ratio, which was carried out by the synthesis of five different BFen-MIPs incorporating different quantities of the BFen template, while at the same time keeping the formulation of functional monomer (MAA)/crosslinker (EGDMA)/initiator (AIBN) at the value 20:78:2. It should be noted that these polymer components add up to 100% of the MIP material, which does not take into account any of the templates because the template is removed in the final step of MIP preparation. Therefore, the template does not contribute to the composition of the final material. The ratios of template/functional monomer tested were 1:10, 1:5, 1:2.5, 1:2, and 1:1, which provided a comprehensive range of data to observe trends in MIP performance. The five synthesized MIPs were evaluated using the imprinting factor (IF) as the figure of merit, following the methods described in the \u201cChromatographic Tests\u201d portion of the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section (vide supra). The IF measures the increase in the ratio of BFen binding to the imprinted polymer versus the nonimprinted polymer, in essence providing a measure of the \u201cimprinting effect\u201d, where better imprinting is indicated by larger IF values. The results are shown in Figure 1, indicating the best IF occurs at a template/functional monomer ratio of 1:2. This optimum ratio can be explained by the template/functional monomer complexes illustrated in Scheme 3, showing the solution phase intermediates in template\u2013functional monomer complex formation as the amount of template is increased, which is similarly described for other MIPs [25]. After BFen is added to MAA in step 1 of Scheme 3, it is envisioned that the template is fully complexed to yield \u201ccomplex I\u201d, with the remaining excess MAA not complexed to the template. As the template concentration increases, as in the case of the 1:5, 1:2.5, and 1:2 ratios, the absolute concentration of \u201ccomplex I\u201d increases, which leads to a proportional increase in the total number of binding sites per gram of MIP, which in turn increases the IF (per gram of MIP), as shown in Figure 1.

When the ratio reaches 1:2, the maximum concentration of \u201ccomplex I\u201d is reached, and there is no longer any excess MAA. At this point, the maximum number of \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding sites has been reached, leading to the maximum \u201cimprinting effect\u201d or IF observed. Further increasing the template to give a ratio of 1:1 decreases the number of \u201chigh affinity\u201d sites (\u201ccomplex I\u201d) which have become low-affinity sites (\u201ccomplex II\u201d and \u201ccomplex III\u201d). The low-affinity sites are a result of fewer functional monomers bound to the template, lowering the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding. Thus, the overall \u201cimprinting effect\u201d goes down as the high-affinity sites are substituted by the low affinity sites. From these results, the ratio 1:2 template/functional monomer was chosen for subsequent studies.\n3.1.2. Particle Size Optimization\nThere have been several reports that assessed the chromatographic performance of different-sized MIP particles, from which some generalizations can be made [26,27]. One of the clearest findings is MIP sizes greater than 63 \u00b5m show poorer selectivity and lower retention time due to mass transfer issues of solutes through the larger particles. On the other hand, there have been mixed findings for MIP particles ground to smaller sizes. Previous studies have shown that particle size ranges above 25 \u00b5m have provided better binding results than particles smaller than 25 \u00b5m, despite an increased number of theoretical plates and fewer problems anticipated with mass transfer associated with smaller particles in chromatography [26]. Therefore, for this study, two different particle size ranges were investigated; the larger-sized particles were obtained by sieving to the 25\u201337 \u00b5m range,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3669 7 of 11\nwhile the smaller-sized particles in the 11\u201325 \u00b5m range were obtained by filtering the particles below 25 \u00b5m through Whatman #1 filter paper. Two separate columns were packed with a slurry of differently sized MIPs and evaluated using a mobile phase system consisting of MeCN/H2O, 99.9/0.1, respectively. The results shown in Table 1 indicate that the 25\u201337 \u00b5m particle sizes produced better IF values compared to the particle size range 11\u201325 \u00b5m, which correlates well with the findings of previous studies [26,27].\nA priori, it could be envisaged that the smaller particles should provide a better IF due to shorter distances of path length diffusion, resulting in quicker mass transfer kinetics of substrates, increased surface accessibility, and better access to binding sites buried internally in the particles. However, the data show that this is not the case, which has been attributed previously to a scenario whereby a considerable number of binding sites were postulated to have been destroyed during the grinding process to smaller-sized particles. Based on these findings, the 25\u201337 \u00b5m sized particles were chosen for further studies.\n3.1.3. Mobile Phase Composition and Flow Rate\nThe mobile phase conditions were evaluated and optimized using different proportions of water and acetonitrile, and it was first determined that the elution of BFen in MeCN/H2O: 95/5 (v/v) gave retention values close to the void volume, indicating that the mobile phase was too polar. Systematically reducing the amount of water in MeCN to 1% and subsequently to 0.1% resulted in longer elution times, with 100% MeCN providing the longest peak elution times, indicating the highest binding affinity. Mobile phases incorporating 0.1% and 1% formic acid in MeCN were also studied to determine if the protonation state of the BFen had an effect on binding; unfortunately, the retention times were reduced. Thus, the acid component provided an unacceptably high eluotropic strength, and correspondingly, it was determined that the best mobile phase was 100% MeCN. In addition, several flow rates were evaluated (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mL/min); however, the IF stayed the same in all cases, and the faster flow rate of 1.0 mL/min was chosen for further studies."

In addition, two analogs of fentanyl, acetyl-benzylfentanyl (ABF) and benzoyl-benzylfentanyl (BBF), with structural similarities to fentanyl, were also examined. The chromatographic results from the experiments are shown in Figure 2, showing the best selectivity found for BFen, for which the MIP was originally developed. This is the usual finding for MIP technology, i.e., the template binds best to its own imprinted polymer [28]. To evaluate the cross-binding selectivity (CBS) of the other compounds tested, the capacity factors were normalized relative to BFen binding, as described in Section 2.5. The second-best recognized analyte was fentanyl, a very important finding that opens the door to using this MIP for promising applications in the detection and/or separation of fentanyl from other substances.

For instance, Figure 4 splits BFen into two moieties representing the top and bottom halves of the molecule. The top moiety (A) was found in both BFen and fentanyl, which were the highest binding analogs. However, ABF and BBF had changes in moiety A and suffered a severe loss of binding.

            "text": "A fentanyl-selective MIP was synthesized using BFen as the template, which is anticipated to be the analog most closely resembling f ntanyl. A tremendous advantage of using BFen is i s significantly lower toxicit compared to fentanyl, as well as the important benefit of using analogs as the MIP template, which eliminates any interference in detection by leaching any remaining template. Although the literature has two examples of fentanyl-binding MIPs, neither of these reports discussed the development of MIP matrix formulation to maximize the binding and/or selectivity of fentanyl. With the long-term goal of optimizing fentanyl-specific binding MIPs, a traditional polymer formulation utilizing EGDMA as the crosslinker and MAA as the functional monomer was chosen as the first generation of BFen-MIPs for study. This formulation was successful in selectively binding the template and genuine fentanyl. The best selectivity was found for BFen, which is not surprising since most MIP studies report that the template used for imprinting turns out to be the strongest-binding analyte. However, it was very encouraging that fentanyl exhibited the next best selectivity in binding to the MIP. The two other benzylfentanyl analogs tested also showed binding to the MIP to a lesser degree but significantly better than the nonrelated narcotics in comparison. In general, for MIPs, compounds that are most similar in structure to the template tend to exhibit better binding compared to nonrelated compounds. It is anticipated that this phenomenon could be useful for the detection of a large family of fentanyl analogs which are often encountered as contraband. The low binding of nonrelated compounds such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine could be\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3669 10 of 11\nstrategically employed in monitoring contamination with fentanyl analogs. Improvements in the fentanyl binding and selectivity using different monomers and crosslinkers, as well as optimization of the MIP component ratios, are currently under investigation. These materials will be further incorporated into detection formats and assays that will someday save many lives.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; methodology, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; validation, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; formal analysis, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; investigation, M.R.H.; resources, D.A.S.; data curation, M.R.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; writing\u2014 review and editing, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; visualization, M.R.H. and D.A.S.; supervision, D.A.S.; project administration, D.A.S.; funding acquisition, D.A.S.
