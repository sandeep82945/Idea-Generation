    "abstractText": "TheMukaiyama aldol reaction is generally a Lewis-acid catalyzed cross-aldol reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and silyl enol ether. It was first described by Mukaiyama in 1973, almost 5 decades ago, to achieve the enantioselective synthesis of b-hydroxy carbonyl compounds in high percentage yields. Mukaiyama aldol adducts play a pivotal role in the synthesis of various naturally occurring and medicinally important organic compounds such as polyketides, alkaloids, macrolides, etc. This review highlights the significance of the Mukaiyama aldol reaction towards the asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of biologically active natural products reported recently (since 2020).",

It was first described by Mukaiyama in 1973, almost 5 decades ago, to achieve\nthe enantioselective synthesis of b-hydroxy carbonyl compounds in high percentage yields. Mukaiyama\naldol adducts play a pivotal role in the synthesis of various naturally occurring and medicinally important\norganic compounds such as polyketides, alkaloids, macrolides, etc. This review highlights the\nsignificance of the Mukaiyama aldol reaction towards the asymmetric synthesis of a wide range of\nbiologically active natural products reported recently (since 2020)."

            "text": "The Mukaiyama aldol reaction was rst reported by Mukaiyama in 1973, about 50 years ago.1 He carried out the aldol reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with trimethyl silyl enol ether by utilizing titanium chloride as a catalyst.2 The electrophilic nature of carbonyl compounds is enhanced using Lewis acid catalyst, thereby leading to a facile attack by the carbon nucleophile. Similarly, Mukaiyama and his coworker Ishida implemented the aldol reaction between silyl enol ether, which was obtained as a derivative of crotonaldehyde, and cinnamaldehyde dimethyl acetal. The aldol reaction, involving these substituents was named vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction (VMAR).3\u20135 VMAR results in the synthesis of double bonds containing bulky structural skeletons, which can then be subjected to various reactions including organometallic reactions, dihydroxylation and epoxidation (Scheme 1).6\nThe general mechanism of the Mukaiyama aldol reaction involves the attack of aldehyde oxygen to titanium followed by the release of a chloride ion. The chloride ion then attacks silylenol ether 6 to generate enolate and trimethylsilyl chloride. The enolate then attacks the electron-decient carbonyl carbon followed by the addition of water to give the Mukaiyama aldol product 7 (Scheme 2).\nSilicon7\u20139 and boron enolates10\u201312 were also employed by Mukaiyama and co-workers to execute the aldol reaction, which is highly stereoselective in nature. A strong base is employed to abstract a proton from the carbonyl compound to generate silicon enolate, which is then reacted with trialkylsilyl chloride.13 Then, this silicon enolate further undergoes reaction with a carbonyl compound by utilizing a Lewis acid as catalyst. In general, the\nCollege University Faisalabad, 38000 @gcuf.edu.pk\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nMukaiyama aldol adduct is formed by the involvement of an open transition state, however, boron enolates require the use of a weak base with boron Lewis acid and the reaction proceeds through a transition state that is cyclic in nature.14,15\nVarious other Lewis acids i.e., zinc chloride, iron chloride, tin chloride, boron triuoride and aluminium trichloride have been utilized aer the employment of titanium tetrachloride in Mukaiyama aldol reactions.16 Moreover, there have been further advancements in this reaction by the application of numerous other electrophiles such as acetals, thioacetals, ketimines, imines and ketones.17\u201320 Besides electrophiles, many other nucleophiles have now been employed in the Mukaiyama aldol reaction including allylsilanes, silicon dienolates and silyl cyanides.21,22\nMoreover, a facile reaction between silicon enolates and acetals has been observed in trimethylsilyl triuoromethanesulfonate, trityl perchlorate and trityl hexachloroantimonate mediated Mukaiyama aldol reactions.23 In addition, utilization of non-metallic Lewis acids i.e., triphenyl methyl salt has also been reported.24a Previously, almost all reported Mukaiyama aldol reactions were carried out in organic solvents. Despite water being an easily accessible and ecofriendly solvent, it was not considered for Mukaiyama aldol reactions due to the possibility of decomposition of silicon enolates. However, later studies revealed that lanthanide triate catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reactions were possible using water as solvent, resulting in enantioselective synthesis of aldol adducts in high yields.24b\nb-Hydroxy carbonyl compounds with two asymmetric centers are produced as a result of the reaction between enolates and carbonyl compounds.25,26 C\u2013C bonds are formed as a result of this reaction leading to the generation of complicated structures.

Silyl enol ether 84 was further subjected to react with compound 85 via a titanium chloride catalyzed vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction (VMAR) by using dichloromethane as a solvent to obtain Mukaiyama aldol product 86 in 55% yield with a separable diastereoselectivity ratio of 7 : 1. Later, aldol adduct 86 was hydrogenated in the presence of palladium to obtain ketone 87 in >99% yield. The ketone based compound 87 was further reacted over several steps to furnish amine moiety 88. Amine 88 was then coupled with acid 89 followed by deprotection of protecting groups in acidic conditions, which led to the synthesis of bactobolin A 90 in 92% yield (Scheme 11).\nAatoxins are extremely detrimental as they contaminate food which results in the proliferation of cancer cells in animals and humans.70 In order to prevent the toxic effects of aatoxins, there is a dire need for aatoxin growth inhibitors. Aastatin A, which was obtained from Streptomyces sp. MRI142 in 1996, was\nScheme 13 Synthesis of (\u00b1)-omphalic acid 111.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nfound to interrupt the growth of aatoxins.71,72 Aastatin A is a naturally occurring and structurally complex polyketide, which contains 29 optically active carbons along with numerous hydroxyl groups. Its structure also contains a derivative of tetramic acid on its lengthy chains. There have been numerous reports on the total synthesis of aastatin A to date. Recently, Evans et al.73 reported the asymmetric and efficient approach for the total synthesis of aastatin A in 0.69% overall yield by employing various aldol reactions including the Mukaiyama aldol reaction. The C3\u2013C15 aldehyde 92 was synthesized in 94% yield by treating oxazolidinone 91 over numerous steps. Similarly, oxazolidinone 91 was made to react with aldehyde 93 through different reactions to synthesize C16\u2013C26 enolsilane 94. Aldehyde 92 and enolsilane 94 were then made to react via a trityl-catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction in the presence of Ph3CPF6 and DCM, followed by reaction with PPTS and methanol to obtain Mukaiyama aldol product 95 in 75% yield in a diastereoselectivity ratio of more than 95 : 05. It was inferred that the trityl-catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction is highly efficient as compared to the BF3$OEt2 mediated Mukaiyama aldol reaction in this case, as the latter resulted in aldol adduct 95 with a lower diastereoselectivity ratio (dr = 57 : 43). Compound 95 was further subjected to Prasad reduction, followed by preparation of acetonide and nally leading to the synthesis of ketone 96 via ozonolysis in 81% yield. In order to synthesize C27\u2013C35 aldehyde 99, aldehyde 97 and oxazolidinone 98 were treated over a number of steps. Aldehyde 99 was then made to react with ketone 100 (which was synthesized by\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027 | 32987\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

These diterpenes are used to cure a number of diseases. Their structure is composed of three carbon containing cyclic rings.79 Owing to the biological signicance of curcusone diterpenes, Cui et al.80 in 2021, for the rst time reported their total synthesis. The rst step of total synthesis involved the treatment of perillaldehyde 120 with TBSOTf, triethyl amine and dichloromethane via the Mukaiyama aldol reaction, which further involved the Lewis acid catalyzed reaction with HC(OET)3. Mukaiyama aldol product 121 was subjected to reduction followed by treatment with compound 122 in the presence of triphenyl phosphine, DEAD and tetrahydrofuran, which resulted in the synthesis of compound 123 in 48% yield.\nScheme 18 Total syntheses of ganocins A\u2013C 152\u2013154.\n32992 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027\nCompound 123 was then treated via a number of steps to obtain enone 124. Compound 124 was further treated with KHMDS, methyl iodide in the presence of tetrahydrofuran to obtain curcusone A 125a and curcusone B 125b in 63% yield. In the next step, curcusone C 125c and curcusone D 125d were synthesized from 125a and 125b, as a result of the reaction with KHMDS and MoOPh in tetrahydrofuran. 125c and 125d were then subjected to react through two different routes to obtain dimericursone (\u2212)-126a and curcusone analog 128 in 18% and 59% yields respectively. Furthermore, curcusone A and B 125a and 125b were made to react with TMEDA in the presence of oxygen and methanol, which resulted in 21% yield of pyracurcasone 129 and 60% yield of compound 130 (Scheme 15).\nAn efficient methodology for treating cyclic dienol silanes with chiral aldehydes has been put forward by using Lewis acid i.e., Yb(OTf)3 or Zn(OTf)2 as catalysts for known Mukaiyama aldol reactions.

In this regard, Adamkiewicz et al.83 reacted sclareolide 131 with CH3NHOCH3 in the presence of HCl, AlMe3 and dichloromethane, followed by its reaction with thionyl chloride and then subsequent reduction resulted in the synthesis of compound 132 in 90% yield. Compound 132 was further reacted with silyl enol ether 133 via the Yb(OTf)3 catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction, which resulted in the mixture of curcucomosin 134 and vitexolide 135 in 70% yield (5 : 1). This was then reacted with aluminium oxide and pyridine to obtain villosin 136 in 84% yield. Villosin 136 was then subjected to reduction in THF and DCM one by one, thus leading to the synthesis of coronarin E 137 and chinensine C 138 in 80% and 76% yield, respectively. Similarly, sclareolide 131 was transformed into mixture of aldehydes 139 and 140. Aldehyde 139 was subjected to Mukaiyama aldol reaction to obtain compound 141, which was further reacted with aluminium oxide and pyridine to synthesize (E)-labda-7,11,13trien-16,15-olide 142 in 78% yield (Scheme 16).\nIn order to treat various cancerous diseases, Ganoderma fungi has been found to play an effective role. This particular\nScheme 19 Synthesis of atropurpuran diterpene 162.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Many of these were found to be highly potent against acetylcholinesterase activity.85 Ganocins A\u2013C are highly structurally complex monoterpenoids with a ve-membered cyclic ring. Moreover, their structure constitutes ve asymmetric/chiral centers. Beside numerous reported synthetic routes to attain these structurally and biologically diverse molecules, an efficient synthetic methodology for their synthesis was required. For this purpose, Shao et al.86 and Zhang et al.87 in 2020 reported the synthesis of these naturally occurring terpenoids by utilizing the Mukaiyama aldol reaction as a key step. In the rst step, geranylacetone 143 was made to react with lithium diisopropyl amide and tert-methyl silyl chloride in the presence of triethyl amine and tetrahydrofuran, followed by its reaction with 5-methoxy salicylaldehyde 144 via titanium chloride catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction. This resulted in the synthesis of compound 145 in 63% yield. The Mukaiyama product 145 was further converted to phenol 146 by undergoing a number of steps. Compound 146 was subsequently reacted with Tf2O by using triethyl amine and\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027 | 32993\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Then, the intermediate compounds 146 and 147 were further reacted individually i.e., compound 146 was subjected to demethylation to synthesize cochlearol T 148 in 52% yield. Similarly, compound 147 was subjected to palladium catalyzed carboxylation followed by its reaction with 4-methylthiophenol, which gave ganocochlearin C 149 in 40% yield. The intermediate compound 149 was also subjected to palladium catalyzed carboxylation in the presence of DMSO, followed by subsequent demethylation, which afforded ganocochlearin D 150 in 73% yield (Scheme 17).\nFurthermore, intermediate 146 was made to react with SO2Cl2 in the presence of sodium carbonate, followed by reaction with cesium uoride which gave dienone. Dienone was then reduced regioselectively to furnish compound 151 in 80% yield. Compound 151 was further demethylated to give ganocin B 152 and C 153 in 66% and 65% yields, respectively. Ganocin B was subsequently converted to ganocin A 154 by undergoing several steps (Scheme 18).\nAconitum heterophyllum is the source of many diterpenes such as campylopin,88 atropurpuran89 and Guan Fu diterpenoid A.90 Among these, atropurpuran is a non-alkaloidal diterpene whose structural framework constitutes ve cyclic rings with tetracyclo and bicyclo units. Suzuki et al.91 in 2022 reported the synthesis of the highly complex structure of atropurpuran by\nScheme 20 Synthesis of garsubellin A 169.\n32994 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027\nemploying the Mukaiyama aldol reaction and intramolecular Diels\u2013Alder reaction in their strategy. The rst step involved the reaction of 6-methoxy-1-tetralone 155 with hydrogen bromide utilizing aqueous hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid followed by Hartwig hydroxylation to give phenol 156 in 80% yield. The hydroxyl group was protected by benzyl bromide followed by a subsequent Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and Me2NH2Cl in acetic anhydride. The next step involved the reaction with methyl iodide in the presence of potassium cyanide and ammonium chloride to furnish nitrile 157 in 88% yield. It was then made to react with TMSOTf in triethyl amine and DCM to afford trimethyl silyl enol ether 158, which then underwent the Mukaiyama aldol reaction with acrolein 159 by utilizing Yb(OTf)3 as a catalyst in toluene or ethanol/water to synthesize adduct 160. The adduct 160 was further treated over a number of steps to obtain atropurpuran skeleton 161. This atropurpuran skeleton then resulted in the synthesis of atropurpuran diterpene 162 on treatment with Qin's intermediate or Xu's intermediate (Scheme 19).\nGarsubellin A has been found to be isolated from Garcinia subelliptica, a tree that is present on Okinawa Japan island.92 This naturally occurring monoterpene has wide biological signicance alongside structural complexities.

They are known to boost the activity of acetylcholine transferase thus preventing the onset of Alzheimer's disease.93 Owing to their remarkable structural framework and biological signicance, various synthetic routes have been reported towards their total synthesis. However, these methods resulted in racemic synthesis of target molecules. Jang et al.94 in 2022 attempted to describe the enantioselective synthesis of target molecule. The rst step of their synthetic methodology involved the reaction of enone 163 with LDA and TMSCl followed by a titanium chloride catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction in DCM upon treatment with aldehyde 164. As a result, the Mukaiyama aldol product 165 was obtained in 75% yield, which was then subjected to a number of steps to afford compound 166. Later, compound 166 underwent conjugate addition in the presence of Ley's conditions followed by subsequent oxidation by using DMP and DCC to furnish triketone 168 in 94% yield. It was then transformed into target molecule 169 by undergoing a number of different reactions (Scheme 20).\nNaturally occurring polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols belong to the class of monoterpenoids and are known to exhibit potent biological activity against a number of diseases.95 Newly discovered acylphloroglucinol monoterpenoids containing six-membered rings were derived from\nScheme 21 Synthesis of hyptaulin B 175.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Moreover, they are found to be effective against a number of bacterial strains i.e., E. coli, S. aureus and B. subtilis. As hyptaulin A was found to be easily synthesized from hyptaulin B, Leisering et al.97 in 2022 attempted to report the total synthesis of hyptaulin B by carrying out theMukaiyama aldol reaction and photo-oxidation. The rst step of synthesis involved the enolization reaction of cyclopentanone 170 followed by Mukaiyma aldol addition with aldehyde 171 to yield diastereomers 172-(S) and 172-(R) in 91% yield with diastereoselectivity ratio of 3 : 2. Both these diastereomers were further subjected to deacetalization to afford enone 173 in 92% yield. This reaction was followed by the procurement of isomer 174 in 59% yield from enone 173. Compound 174 was then subjected to Homo-Sakurai allylation followed by the addition of trimethylamine which gave substituted ester 176 in 63% yield with 1 : 2 diastereoselectivity ratio. However, Homo-Sakurai-allylation followed by treatment with sodium hexamethyldisilazide gave ester 176 in 85% yield. Ester 176 was further reduced with DIBAL-H and then subjected to Lewis acid catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction in DCM. Then, oxidation was carried out with DMP, which gave triketone intermediate 177 in 62% yield.

Alotaketal A is one of the naturally occurring marine spiroketal that has been found to be obtained fromHamiegra species. They are included in the sesterpenoid family as they have a didehydro spiroketal moiety in their structure.98,99 Lee et al.100 in 2020 attempted to describe the total synthesis of alotketal A by involving the Mukaiyama aldol reaction and epoxide rearrangement along with the gold-mediated spiroketalization approach. The synthesis began with the reaction of R-curvane 179 via iron chloride catalyzed formation of enol ether, which resulted in the synthesis of hydroxy curvane 180 via O-nitroso Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Hydroxy curvane 180 further underwent a number of reactions to synthesize coupling fragment 181. In the next step, aldehyde 182 was made to react with compound 183 in the presence of Ti(OiPr)4, (S)-BINOL, (CF3)2CHOH and PhCF3 to obtain coupling fragment 184 in 11 : 1 enantioselective ratio. Fragments 181 and 184 were nally coupled by using copper iodide followed by treatment with lithium hydroxide in methanol and gold-mediatedspiroketalization resulted in the synthesis of target molecule alotaketal A 185 in 82% yield (Scheme 22).\nMost of the seawater norsesterpene metabolites belong to the family of naturally occurring endoperoxides. Various members of this family have been known to be isolated from different sponges i.e., Diacarnus, Sigmosceptrella, prianos or Mycale. Similarly, Mycale sponges are a source of different mycaperoxides which exhibit signicant biological activity\nScheme 22 Synthesis of (\u2212)-alotaketal A 185.\n32996 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027\nagainst a number of bacterial and viral diseases.101,102 They constitute 1,2-dioxane ring substituted propionic acid along with a sesquiterpene subunit in their structure. Various researchers have attempted to describe the total synthesis of these naturally occurring endoperoxides, but a concise and efficient stereoselective route has not been developed yet. Thus, Kerim et al.103 in 2022 synthesized various members of the mycaperoxide class for the rst time. The synthesis initiated with the generation of cyclopropylidene 187 by treating sclareol 186 over a number of steps. Cyclopropylidene was then subjected to protection with TESCl, followed by reaction with metachloroperoxybenzoic acid to give compound 188 in 81% yield. Compound 188 was further converted to peroxyacetal 189 in 84% yield, by undergoing three different steps. In the next step, peroxyacetal 189 underwent the Mukaiyama aldol reaction upon treatment with silyl enol ether 190 by using Sc(OTf)3 as catalyst and dichloromethane as solvent. A subsequent reaction with p-toluene sulfonic acid in the presence of methanol gave a mixture of different diastereomers i.e., 191a, 191b, 191c and 191d. Diastereomer 191a was further reacted with hydrogen peroxide and lithium hydroxide using THF/H2O as a solvent. Thus, mycaperoxide D methyl ester 192 was obtained in 76% yield aer reaction with TMSCHN2 in methanol (Scheme 23).\nA series of similar steps were adopted to synthesize mycaperoxide C methyl ester 196. For this purpose, compound 193a was converted to peroxyacetal 194 in 82% yield.

            "text": "The Rauvola Vomitaria plant is an isolation source of rauvomines A and B, which are monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Rauvomine A constitutes a chlorine atom at carbon number 20 and an extra cyclopropane ring is present in the skeleton of rauvomine B.106 These indole alkaloids have wide medicinal applications and they are found to be highly potent against inammatory diseases. Owing to their unparalleled biological applications and structural diversity, they have attracted the interest of various researchers. Most recently, Wu et al.107 reported the brief and efficient total synthesis of these compounds by employing the Mukaiyama aldol reaction as one of its key steps. In this regard, compounds 207 and 208 were coupled and reacted in a number of steps, thus leading to the synthesis of ketone 209 in excellent yields. In the next step, ketone 209 was made to react with compound 210 by utilizing potassium carbonate and dimethylformamide followed by its reaction with potassium hexamethyl disilazide and tert-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran to obtain tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether 211 in 95% yield. In the next step, ether 211 was subjected to the Mukaiyama aldol reaction upon treatment with titanium chloride in dichloromethane at \u221278 \u00b0C to room temperature. This reaction resulted in the synthesis of aldol adduct 212 in 70% yield, thereby synthesizing the vemembered cyclic ring of the target molecule. The compound 212 was then reacted in the presence of different conditions to obtain the central ring of rauvomines 213a and 213b, respectively. Compounds 213a and 213b were further individually reacted with (COCl)2, dimethylsulfoxide, trimethylamine followed by treatment with hydrochloric acid to obtain the dextrorotary and levorotatory stereoisomers of compounds 214a and 214b in 82% and 85% yields, respectively. In this way, total synthesis of rauvomines can be carried out by employing this\nScheme 24 Synthesis of mycaperoxide C 196.\n32998 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027\nsynthetic approach, which has been utilized to synthesize a highly complex ring in its structure (Scheme 27).\nVarious types of indole alkaloids can be extracted from Tabernaemontana corymbosa plants.108 Specically, vobasinyl iboga-type and chippiine-type indole alkaloids are found to be highly active against cancerous diseases. Kam and colleagues carried out the isolation of tronocarpine in the beginning of 21st century.109 Tronocarpine holds signicant importance in the chippiine-type alkaloids family. Its structure is composed of ve-membered cyclic rings, constituting lactams and chiral centers. Owing to the importance of the tronocarpine alkaloid, various synthetic schemes have been proposed by different researchers in recent years. However, previous reported methodologies were too long and time consuming. Hence, Nakayama et al.110 in 2021 demonstrated the efficient methodology for its synthesis. The rst step of the synthesis involved the coupling reaction between 215 and a,b-unsaturated ester 216 in the presence of n-Bu3P, acetonitrile and methanol followed by hydrogenation and addition reactions, which led to the synthesis of compound 217 in 56% yield. The compound 217 was further treated with sodium azide in DMF solvent followed by subsequent reduction with DIBAL, which gave aldehyde 218 in 52% yield. Aldehyde 218 was then subjected to Mukaiyama aldol reaction conditions in the presence of TBSOTf, DIPEA and dichloromethane at 0 \u00b0C to obtain silyl enol ether. In the following step, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal and TBSOTf were added to the reaction mixture, which resulted in 35% yield of compound 219 along with 25% yield of by-products i.e., 219a and 219b. By-products 219a and 219b were then treated with Amberlyst\u00ae15 in acetone to obtain 219 in 86% yield. Compound 219 was further reacted via several steps to obtain an excellent yield of tronocarpine alkaloid 220 (Scheme 28).\nSirivastava and Ha111 in 2021 developed a novel approach for the Mukaiyama aldol reaction by employing chiral substituents.

Compound 224 was then reacted over several steps to synthesize (\u2212)-epiallo-isomuscarine 225 (Scheme 29).\nSubstituted chiral aldehyde 221 was made to react with trimethylsilyl enol ether 226 by using zinc chloride as the catalyst in acetonitrile to furnish aldol adduct 227. The aldol adduct 227 was reacted with TBSOTf and 2,6-lutidine utilizing DCM which resulted in the synthesis of compound 228 in 85% yield. Finally, (2S,3R,5S)-enigmol analog 229 was synthesized by treating compound 228 over several steps (Scheme 30).\nSubstituted chiral aldehyde 221 underwent a zinc chloride catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction with trimethyl silyl enol ether 230 to furnish aldol adduct 231 in a diastereoselectivity ratio of more than 97 : 3. Compound 231 was reacted with TBSOTf and 2,6-lutidine in dichloromethane to afford compound 232 in 83% yield. Compound 232 was further made to react in a number of steps to synthesize epi-galantic acid 233 (Scheme 31).\nKobayashi along with colleagues isolated lycopodium alkaloids i.e., lyconesidine A and B from Lycopodium chinese. These are naturally occurring alkaloids, which are comprised of Fawcettimine alkaloids type cyclic moiety in their structural framework.112,113 They are found to be effective in inhibiting the proliferation of cancerous cells, thus behaving as anti-mitotic agents. Compounds with anti-cancerous potential have been widely investigated.114,115 Specically, Lyconsesidine B has been\n33000 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027\nfound to interrupt the polymerization process of tubulin with IC50 = 250 mM. Taking into account the structural diversity and anti-cancerous potential of Lyconesidine B, Kurose et al.116 in 2020 furnished the total synthesis of this naturally occurring alkaloid by employing the Mukaiyama aldol reaction as one of its key steps. At the onset of synthesis, enol triate 234 was reacted over a number of steps to synthesize the tetracyclic ring of lyconesidine B 235. Tetracyclic ring containing compound 235 was further treated via epoxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Cl3CCN and potassium carbonate followed by opening of the epoxide ring in the presence of H2, and Pd/C to obtain compound 236 in 86% yield. Compound 236 was then made to react with TESOTf and 2,6-lutidine followed by reduction utilizing palladium to obtain compound 237 in 96% yield. It was then reacted with TMSOTf and 2,6-lutidine in dichloromethane followed by a scandium triate catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction with aldehyde in tetrahydrofuran, which resulted in the synthesis of b-hydroxyketone 238 in 76% yield. bHydroxyketone 238 later underwent a number of reactions to obtain lyconesidine B 239 (Scheme 32).\nHaliclona species, which belong to the sea-water sponge genus, are a source of various naturally occurring organic compounds.117 These naturally occurring metabolites have been found to be highly potent against cancerous, bacterial and viral diseases.118 Similarly, seawater cyclic alkaloid, haliclonin A, was obtained from Haliclona sp. by Shin and colleagues.

The rst step involved the reaction between 3-chloro4-uorobenzotriouride 383 and resorcinol 384 in the presence of potassium hydroxide and dimethylsulfoxide, which gave the phenol substituted compound 385 in 99% yield. Then, compound 385 was made to react with acrylonitrile by using potassium carbonate and tert-butanol via an oxy-Michael addition reaction. It was followed by treatment with triuoroacetic acid in the presence of water via the Hoeben\u2013Hoesch reaction, which led to the synthesis of chromanone 386 in 80% yield. Chromanone 386 was further subjected to the titanium chloride catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction/elimination array, on reacting with silyl enol ether 387, which furnished compound\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 32975\u201333027 | 33019\nScheme 51 Synthesis of merilactone A 382.\nScheme 52 Synthesis of MK-2305 389.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
