"To solve these problems, it is necessary to concentrate on studying the metabolism of cTns."

"In the future, the data obtained will help to develop special algorithms for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients using high-sensitivity troponin immunoassays which can help physicians to initiate the earliest and the best therapeutic and preventive measures that will help improve patientsâ€™ prognosis."

"Given the abundance of possible metabolic mechanisms and factors influencing cTn levels, as well as their potential clinical significance (Table 1), we should note the high relevance of further studies of cTns protein metabolism."

"Further studies are needed to confirm and clarify the specific role of apoptosis in the release of cTn molecules from MCs."

"Therefore, additional studies are needed to validate this mechanism of cTns release."

"Additional clarifying studies on larger selections for all of the high sensitivity troponin immunoassays currently used in clinical practice are required for validation."
