Here, we present Raman imaging techniques of cryofixed specimens to 28 overcome SNR limitations by enabling long exposure of specimens under highly stabilized low-29 temperature conditions. The observation of frozen specimens in a cryostat at a constant low 30 temperature immediately after rapid freezing enabled the improvement of SNR and significantly 31 enhanced spatial and spectral resolution. We also confirmed that the cryofixation can preserve 32 physicochemical states of specimens by observing alkyne-labeled coenzyme Q in cytosol and 33 hemeproteins in acute ischemic myocardium, which cannot be done by fixation using chemical 34 reagents. Finally, we applied the technique for multiplex Raman imaging of label-free 35 endogenous molecules and alkyne-tagged molecules in cryofixed HeLa cells, demonstrating its 36 capability of high-content imaging of complex biological phenomena while maintaining 37 physiological conditions. 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47\nPage 2 of 19\nMAIN TEXT 48 49 Introduction 50 Raman microscopy is an emerging tool for molecular analysis of biological specimens under 51 physiological conditions [1],[2]. Distributions of biomolecules in a sample are imaged by 52 obtaining the spatial distributions of Raman scattering, allowing the visualization of cell dynamics 53 [3], drug effects [4],[5],[6], and cell differentiations [7],[8]. Interpreting sample-specific Raman 54 spectra and their spatial distributions, Raman microscopy enables label-free and nondestructive 55 classification of cells and tissues [9],[10],[11], which recently is a leading interest in the fields of 56 biomedicine and regenerative medicine [12],[13]. The use of Raman tags has further extended 57 Raman microscopy as a technique to track exogeneous or endogenous small molecules [14],[15]. 58 This strategy has enabled super multiplex imaging that exploits the narrow line emission of 59 Raman probes for simultaneous visualization of a large number of targets [16],[17]. 60 One of the challenges in Raman microscopy is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 61 hyperspectral imaging. The intrinsic small cross-section of Raman scattering has limited the 62 detection sensitivity and the resolutions in the spatial and spectral domains. High-intensity laser 63 irradiation may increase the number of Raman scattering photons but can easily degrade the 64 specimen. Using low-intensity laser irradiation can prevent alterations of biological specimens but 65 then requires a long acquisition time in Raman imaging, leading to motion artifacts as well as 66 physiological changes of specimens during observation. To overcome these problems, the spatial 67 resolution and field of view (FOV) are sacrificed in a trade-off with image acquisition time 68 [18],[19],[20]. The sample fixation by chemical reagents (e.g., paraformaldehyde (PFA)) or 69 organic solvents has been used for suppressing the motion of biological specimen and preserving 70 biomolecules [21],[22], but denatures cells by chemical reaction or dehydration [20],[21],[23]. 71 Additionally, the utility of the chemical fixation is limited in fixing biological activities in motion 72 [24], and there are molecular species that cannot be fixed by the current chemical fixation 73 techniques [25]. 74 Here we present a technique for high-SNR Raman imaging of biological specimens while 75 preserving their physicochemical states under a low temperature. Cryopreservation of biological 76 specimen was achieved by rapid freezing with liquid cryogen and subsequent cooling for low-77 temperature Raman observation. Long-term Raman imaging of the frozen specimen was enabled 78 by a customized microscope cryostat that can maintain the specimen under low temperature. We 79 confirmed the improvement of SNR with a longtime exposure without causing obvious sample 80 photodegradation. The wide FOV and high-resolution measurement were also realized while 81 avoiding motion blur in Raman imaging. We also confirmed that the redox state of heme proteins 82 in a heart tissue, which changes rapidly at the physiological temperature (~310 K), was preserved 83 by cryofixation and visualized by low-temperature Raman imaging, demonstrating the capability 84 of preserving chemical states of proteins. 85 86 Results 87 An inverted Raman microscope equipped with a custom cryostat that enables rapid freezing and 88 low-temperature observation was developed (Fig. 1A-B). A specimen on a fused silica coverslip 89 was placed on the sample mount in the cryostat, separated from the cooling block by a 20 \u00b5m 90 height stainless spacer that prevents cell damage that would otherwise occur by its direct contact 91 to the cooling block. The cooling block was equipped with a thermocouple, a liquid nitrogen 92 circulation channel, and a heater for temperature control of the sample. Flow of nitrogen gas in 93 the cryostat prevents frost generation that could occur around the sample during the cooling and 94 observation processes. 95 The sample was cryofixed by rapid freezing using liquid propane at 88 K (in an amount of 40-96 60 ml) to avoid destruction of cell structures by large ice crystal formation [26],[27],[28]. 97\nPage 3 of 19\nImmediately after applying the cryogen to the sample, circulation of liquid nitrogen in the cooling 98 block was started to stabilize the temperature of the cooling block for Raman measurement. The 99 liquid propane remaining on the sample, that could interfere with Raman measurement, was 100 removed via evaporation or introducing liquid nitrogen on the sample (see Materials and 101 Methods). The cryostat was sealed using a sapphire glass window and a rubber ring before 102 Raman observation. We confirmed that there was no image blurring by observation of 0.2 \u00b5m 103 beads (Fig. S1), that could be potentially caused by vibration from the liquid nitrogen circulation 104 after stabilization of the cooling block temperature. 105 We compared live-cell Raman images and spectra acquired under low temperature (233 K) 106 and room temperature (293 K). The Raman images reconstructed at 750 cm-1 (porphyrin 107 breathing of cytochromes), 1680 cm-1 (amide-I of proteins), and 2850 cm-1 (symmetric CH2 of 108 lipids) of cryofixed cells also show the contrasts similar to those of living cells (Fig. 1C). 109 Although the existence of ice crystal was confirmed in the Raman spectra at the observation area 110 (Fig. S2A), we did not observe destruction of cell body and intracellular organelles in a Raman 111 image of cryofixed cells (Fig. S2B), which could be prevented by rapid freezing as slow freezing 112 at a rate of 1 K/min showed significant destruction of sample structures (Fig. S2C). These results 113 indicate that the ice crystals that could form during rapid freezing and subsequent temperature rise 114 to 233 K were small enough to make morphological perturbation of the samples negligible in 115 optical observations. 116 Although many cellular Raman bands appeared similarly at the low and room temperatures, 117 the Raman peaks at 1061 and 2880 cm-1, which can be assigned to C\u2212C stretching and 118 asymmetric CH2 vibrational modes of lipid, respectively [29], exhibited differences between 119 cryofixed cells and living cells (Fig. 1D). The Raman images reconstructed from these bands (Fig. 120 S3A) shows spatial distributions similar to that of lipid reconstructed from 2850 cm-1 (Fig. 1C). 121 The increases in Raman signals at 1061 and 2880 cm-1 can be attributed to lipid phase changes 122 occurring at low temperature (233 K), at which the acyl chain of lipid is more ordered than at 293 123 K [29]. 124 We also found that the resonant Raman scattering of intracellular molecules appeared 125 differently at low temperatures. The Raman bands at 1153 and 1517 cm-1, which can be assigned 126 to the resonant Raman scattering of carotenoids [30], appeared only at the low-temperature 127 measurements (Fig. 1d) and showed the spatial distributions resembling those of lipid droplets 128 (Fig. S3B) that can store hydrophobic vitamins [31]. The bands at 917, 968, and 1337 cm-1 can be 129 assigned to cytochromes [32], and their spatial distributions were similar to cytochromes 130 reconstructed from 750 cm-1 (Fig. S3C). The band at 1298 cm-1 can also be assigned to 131 cytochromes [29],[32], while it can be assigned also to twisting deformational CH mode of lipid 132 [29]. The spatial distribution of the 1298 cm-1 band was similar to mixture of those of 133 cytochromes and lipid (Fig. S3D). The photobleaching effects in resonant Raman scattering from 134 carotenoids and cytochromes [32],[33],[34] could be suppressed and appeared in the low-135 temperature measurement. 136 The high stability of sample condition is beneficial to improve the spectral and spatial 137 resolution in Raman imaging, allowing the accumulation of Raman photons. In principle, the 138 spectral resolution can be improved by using a spectrophotometer with higher wavelength-139 dispersion and a narrower entrance slit, which are not always applicable because the Raman 140 signal decreases significantly under these conditions, especially in live-cell Raman imaging, 141 where the SNR is typically restricted due to the limitation of exposure time to avoid the sample 142 photodamage (Fig. 1E). This limitation is drastically mitigated in low-temperature Raman 143 imaging, and both high spectral and spatial resolutions can be achieved by long exposure with 144 compensating the loss of Raman photons (Fig. 1E-F). We confirmed the band width of 3.9 cm-1 at 145 1001 cm-1, assigned as phenylalanine, in the cryofixed conditions, whereas the same peak was 146\nPage 4 of 19\nobserved to be 8.6 cm-1 under a practical Raman measurement condition at room temperature 147 (Fig. 1F). 148 By maintaining the low temperature of the cooling block, we can maintain the chemical 149 conditions of the sample and the spatial distributions of biomolecules. Taking the advantage of 150 this, we demonstrated high-resolution Raman imaging (650 x 900 image pixels) without obvious 151 motion blur and sample drift for 10 h (Fig. 1G). We kept the temperature of the cooling block at 152 173 K during measurement to avoid growth of large ice crystals in the frozen sample upon 153 heating under prolonged laser irradiation. No obvious sample modification by laser heating was 154 observed. 155 156 The physical fixation by rapid freezing has several advantages in comparison to chemical 157 fixation using organic chemical reagents. As shown in Fig. S4 the cells fixed with PFA exhibited 158 apparent photodamage by longtime laser exposure for high SNR Raman imaging, possibly due to 159 laser-induced heating [36] or generation of reactive oxygen species [37]. On the other hand, at the 160 low temperature, no significant alteration in molecular distributions of the sample was confirmed 161 after the repetitive Raman imaging (Fig. 2A), thanks to the sample stability even under high-dose 162 laser irradiation. We also confirmed that the Raman signal linearly increased along the exposure 163 time (Fig. 2B), which indicates that the biological molecules were not degraded by high-dose 164 laser irradiation and can significantly improve the sensitivity for detecting molecules at low 165 concentrations. We also measured 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), an alkyne-tagged cell 166 proliferation probe, which can be incorporated into cell nuclei, and confirmed that the distribution 167 of EdU in cell nuclei was more clearly visualized with the longer exposure (Fig. 2C). 168 Another advantage of cryofixation by rapid freezing can include instant preservation of 169 physicochemical state of intracellular molecules under living conditions. We confirmed this 170 advantage by observing cytochromes and alkyne-tagged coenzyme Q (AltQ2), a mobile small 171 molecule [14], using the developed system. The PFA-fixed cells showed significant decreases in 172 the Raman signals of cytochromes and AltQ2 (Fig. 2D) due to oxidation of cytochromes [20] and 173 spatial alteration of AltQ2 [38], whereas the cryofixed cells showed the distributions of 174 cytochromes and AltQ2 similar to those in living cells (Fig. 2D). The result demonstrates that 175 rapid freezing and subsequently low-temperature Raman imaging can preserve and observe 176 various cellular components at an environment close to physiological conditions, which cannot be 177 done using conventional chemical fixation techniques. 178 Taking the advantages of the presented technique, we performed a high-SNR and multi-color 179 Raman imaging of cultured cells (Fig. 2E). In addition to Raman images of cytochromes, 180 DNA/RNA [39], carotenoids, lipids, and proteins that are observed without labeling, three Raman 181 tags, EdU, MitoBADY [40], and AltQ2 were simultaneously observed. We also obtained a 182 Raman image of intracellular and extracellular water distributions, using the Raman signal that 183 indicates ice crystal in and out of cryopreserved cells, which can be useful for understandings in 184 the conditions of cryopreserved cells [41]. These results demonstrate the potential of cryo-Raman 185 microscopy to detect the chemical response of endogenous molecules from their Raman spectra 186 while using various Raman tags and probes [14],[17],[42] to perform highly multiplex 187 observations. 188 189 A benefit of rapid freezing also lies in its ability to preserve transient biochemical reactions in 190 biological specimens. One example is the redox state changes of cytochromes in myocardial 191 ischemia [43]. Previous Raman imaging techniques were able to reveal the redox state change but 192 could not visualize the spatial distribution of the redox state in the heart at a specific time point. In 193 this research, we conducted rapid freezing and low-temperature Raman imaging of rat myocardial 194 tissues under ischemic and non-ischemic circumstances. 195\nPage 5 of 19\nWe used low-temperature Raman imaging to enable redox imaging of an acute ischemic heart. 196 A custom methodology and system were adapted for the experiment using heart tissues as 197 follows. In this procedure, we first froze the right ventricle of myocardial tissue by liquid propane 198 outside a cryostat (Fig. 3A). After substituting the liquid propane with liquid nitrogen, the frozen 199 tissue was moved into a microscope cryostat for an upright microscope (Fig. 3B). To prevent frost 200 formation on the sample by humid air, we immediately sealed the cryostat with the microscope 201 objective lens and rubber sheet. 202 Fig. 3C shows the results of Raman hyperspectral imaging of rat hearts rapidly frozen at 1 and 203 21 min after cessation of Langendorff perfusion with oxygenated Tyrode's solution. Raman 204 images reconstructed at 600 cm-1 show the distribution of reduced cytochrome c in 205 cardiomyocytes. The signal intensity within the cardiomyocytes is significantly greater in the 206 heart after 21 min of ischemia compared to 1 min, which is consistent with the findings from 207 single-point time-lapse Raman spectroscopy [43]. The Raman spectra also reflect the trends seen 208 in the Raman images of reduced cytochrome c (Fig. 3D). Raman signals not only at 600, but also 209 at 750 and 1128 cm-1 were higher in the ischemic heart than in the nonischemic heart. In addition, 210 the Raman band at 1640 cm-1, identified as oxygenated myoglobin [44], showed an inverse trend 211 to the reduced cytochrome c signal. Similar trends were confirmed by Raman spectroscopic 212 measurements in live ischemic and non-ischemic rat heat tissue [45]. Our results suggest that the 213 redox state of cytochrome c in cardiomyocytes was preserved by rapid freezing. In addition, we 214 were able to acquire not only Raman spectra but also Raman images while preserving 215 biochemical reactions by using cryofixation. The Raman image acquisition process took 27 min, 216 during which an acutely ischemic heart would undergo changes in redox state and shape without 217 cryofixation. 218 219 220 Discussion 221 The combination of cryofixation and subsequent low-temperature measurement of biological 222 specimens has overcome significant limitations in Raman microscopy, realizing a high SNR and a 223 large FOV as well as high spatial and spectral resolution. The technique significantly reduces 224 photodamage and motion artifacts, allowing the visualization of intracellular molecules and 225 subcellular structures invisible in the measurement without freezing, while also enhancing 226 quantification capabilities of Raman imaging [46],[47]. The cryofixation of chemical states, such 227 as redox states, can further extend the advantage of Raman imaging in its capability of sensing 228 molecular states and their environments. The extended exposure time can also achieve an even 229 better SNR than that in coherent Raman microscopy [1]. 230 Improving the detection sensitivity in Raman microscopy will expand the capability of optical 231 imaging of drug substances [48],[49],[50], which is difficult with conventional fluorescence 232 labeling. The process can also be done fully label-free, and in vivo applications can be realized by 233 use of an in vivo rapid freezing technique [51], preserving physiological conditions of organs in 234 living bodies and allows interrogation by Raman microscopy. In fact, Raman spectra mapping of 235 the mouse liver frozen rapidly in vivo was demonstrated and showed preservation of oxygenated 236 and deoxygenated states of hemoglobin in hepatic blood vessels [52]. In combination with this 237 approach, our presented technique will enable high-SNR and wide-FOV Raman imaging of 238 organs at physiological conditions at certain timepoint in living bodies with high spatial and 239 spectral resolutions. 240 In our system, the detection of signals from low concentration molecules still competes with the 241 background light that can originate from the substrates and optical components. For further 242 improvement of detection sensitivity, reduction of such background light can be achieved by 243 separating excitation and detection optical paths [53] as well as by use of non-emissive sample 244 substrates [54]. Autofluorescence of the sample is also a concern in low-temperature Raman 245\nPage 6 of 19\nimaging as it tends to increase at lower sample temperatures and adds noise to measured Raman 246 spectra (Fig. S5). Use of near-infrared or deep-ultraviolet wavelength excitation can help further 247 improvement of SNR in low-temperature Raman imaging by eliminating the fluorescent 248 background[55],[56]. 249 Another potential issue in the presented method is the formation of large ice crystals and 250 potential sample modification. In our experiments, we did not observe formation of large ice 251 crystals during Raman observation (Fig. S2B). However, the Raman spectrum measurement 252 indicated the formation of tiny ice crystals that cannot be observed by the spatial resolution of 253 optical microscopy but may be found by higher resolution imaging techniques, such as electron 254 microscopy and super-resolution optical microscopy. Despite the initial rapid freezing process not 255 leading to the development of large ice crystals within cells, specifically at a cooling rate of 104-256 105 K/s [57], elevating the temperature to evaporate the liquid propane may cause the formation 257 of large ice crystals, depending on the cell and its intracellular state [58]. In such a case, the liquid 258 propane can be eliminated without increasing the temperature by rinsing with liquid nitrogen, as 259 demonstrated in our experiments of wide-FOV imaging (Fig. 1G), multi-Raman tag imaging (Fig. 260 2E), and tissue measurement (Fig. 3C-D). The impact of laser exposure might also potentially 261 raise the sample temperature and trigger a phase transition in the ice. Indeed, we observed sample 262 thawing with a laser fluence exceeding those demonstrated above and therefore adjusted the 263 temperature between 153-233 K, depending on the exposure time, while maintaining the 264 autofluorescence low enough for Raman measurement. Controlling the temperature and chemical 265 conditions surrounding the sample will be key to expand the advantage of cryogenic Raman 266 measurement further. 267 The presented method will further attract life scientists and clinicians when combined with 268 other modalities. The presented method is highly compatible with cryo-electron microscopy [59], 269 cryogenic super-resolution fluorescence microscopy [60], and correlative light and electron 270 microscopy [61]. Such a combination allows correlative structural and chemical information for 271 the precise analysis of biological samples, providing deep insights into biological phenomena 272 from a chemical aspect that cannot be explored by conventional techniques. 273 274 275 Materials and Methods 276 Cell preparation 277 HeLa cells were cultured on fused silica coverslips with a thickness of 0.17 \u00b1 0.02 mm and a 278 diameter of 25 mm (Matsunami, S339882), and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle 279 Medium (DMEM, 043-30085, Wako-Fujifilm) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 280 S1780-500U, Biowest) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine solution (15140122, Gibco) for 281 48 h in the CO2 incubator at 310 K (37 \u00b0C). Prior to Raman measurements, the medium was 282 replaced by Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, 082-08961, Wako-Fujifilm). 283 For chemical fixation, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA (163-20145, Wako-Fujifilm) at 293 K 284 for 20 min. The fixed cells were rinsed three times and immersed in HBSS for Raman imaging. 285 For EdU measurements (Fig. 2C-E), the cells were cultured without FBS for 24 h in a DMEM 286 solution to synchronize cell cycle for all the cells. The medium was then replaced by a DMEM 287 solution containing EdU at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M and the cells were incubated for 12 h (Fig. 288 2C) or 24 h (Fig. 2E). 289 For AltQ2 measurements, the cells were rinsed with HBSS and incubated with AltQ2 at a 290 concentration of 4 \u00b5M for 30 min. 291 For multiple Raman tag imaging, the cells were first loaded with EdU by the above-described 292 protocol. The cells were then incubated in a DMEM solution containing MitoBADY at the 293 concentration of 800 nM for 1 h and subsequently loaded with AltQ2 for 30 min as mentioned 294 above. 295\nPage 7 of 19\n296 Tissue preparation 297 All of the animal experiments described in this study were conducted in accordance with the 298 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition, National Academies Press, 299 Washington DC, 2011) and with approval by the Animal Research Committee at Kyoto 300 Prefectural University of Medicine (approval No: M2022-238). Male Wistar rats at the age of 9 301 weeks were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies. The animals were placed under deep 302 general anesthesia using intraperitoneal injection with 0.1 mg/kg of medetomidine (Nippon 303 Zenyaku Kogyo), 3.0 mg/kg of midazolam (Sandoz), and 5.0 mg/kg of butorphanol (Meiji 304 Animal Health). After injection of heparin sodium (Mochida Pharmaceutical) into the inferior 305 vena cava (1 U/g body weight), the hearts were quickly resected from the animals. The excised 306 hearts were retrogradely perfused via the aorta with oxygenated Tyrode\u2019s solution (137 mM NaCl, 307 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 308 pH = 7.4) at 310 K with a constant pressure of 9.81 kPa for approximately 3 min. Then, the 309 retrograde perfusion with oxygenated Tyrode\u2019s solution was switched to a constant flux rate of 10 310 ml/min, controlled by a micro tube pump (MP-3N, Tokyo Rikakikai). For preparation of 1-min 311 ischemia heart, the right ventricle was cut out, placed on a copper plate, and frozen by liquid 312 propane in 1 min after the perfusion was stopped. For preparation of 21-min ischemic heart, the 313 whole heart was first perfused with oxygenated Tyrode\u2019s solution for more than 30 min to 314 stabilize its redox state and subsequently perfused with Tyrode\u2019s solution with 20 mM 2,3-315 butanedione monoxime (10923-52, Nacalai Tesque) for 15 min to attenuate the contraction, 316 according to the literature [43]. Global ischemia was then induced in the heart by stopping 317 perfusion for 20 min [43]. Following the global ischemia, the right ventricle was cut out, placed 318 on a copper plate, and frozen by liquid propane in 1 min. 319 320 Slit-scanning Raman microscope equipped with a cryostat 321 All measurements were performed by slit-scanning Raman microscopes equipped with cryostats. 322 For cell imaging, we set a custom cryostat equipped with a cryogen introduction unit on the 323 sample stages of a homebuilt inverted Raman microscope system. The sample coverslip was set 324 on the sample holder. The details of the optical setup can be seen elsewhere [2]. Briefly, a single-325 frequency laser at 532 nm continuous-wave oscillation (Millennia eV, Spectra Physics or Verdi, 326 Coherent) was used for Raman excitation. The laser intensity at the sample was set at 3.0 327 mW/\u00b5m2. The laser beam was focused into a line shape by use of a cylindrical lens and focused at 328 the sample located on an inverted microscope (Ti-E, Nikon) equipped with a 60\u00d7/0.95 NA dry 329 objective lens (CFI Plan Apo Lambda 60XC, Nikon). The Raman scattering light generated at the 330 sample under line illumination was collected by the same objective lens in a back scattering 331 geometry, filtered with a longpass edge filter, and refocused at the entrance slit (60 \u00b5m) of 332 spectrophotometer (CLP-300 or MK-300, Bunkoukeiki) equipped with a grating of 600 or 1800 333 L/mm. The one-dimensional distribution of Raman spectra at the sample irradiated by line 334 illumination was then recorded by a cooled CCD camera (PIXIS 2048B or PIXIS 400BReXcelon, 335 Teledyne Princeton Instruments). A galvanometer mirror was used to scan the sample to acquire a 336 two-dimensional Raman hyperspectral image. The scanning pitch was set to 250 or 220 nm. In 337 order to avoid any change in the focus position during Raman imaging, we used a focus 338 compensation system equipped in the microscope (Nikon PFS). 339 For tissue imaging, we set a cryostat (THMS600, Linkam partially customized to enable the 340 insertion of an objective lens in to the cryostat) on the sample stage of an upright slit-scanning 341 Raman microscope commercially available (Raman-11, Nanophoton). The excitation wavelength 342 was 532 nm and the laser intensity at the sample was set at 1.0 mW/\u00b5m2. The line-shaped laser 343 beam was focused on the sample using a 20\u00d7/0.75NA dry objective lens (UPLSAP20X, 344 Olympus) and the Raman scattering from the sample was collected using the same objective lens 345\nPage 8 of 19\nwith a back scattering geometry. The spectrophotometer entrance slit was set at 30 \u00b5m. The 346 grating of 300 L/mm was used. The cooled CCD camera (PIXIS 400BReXcelon, Teledyne 347 Princeton Instruments) was used to record Raman spectra. The scanning pitch was set to 1.84 \u00b5m. 348 The wavenumber axis of Raman spectra measurement was corrected by use of ethanol Raman 349 bands at 434, 884,1454, and 2930 cm-1 as reference for cell measurements and 434, 884, 1095, 350 and 1454 cm-1 as reference for tissue measurements. 351 352 Cryofixation by liquid cryogen and subsequent cooling 353 Liquid propane was produced by feeding gaseous propane into a beaker cooled at 77 K by liquid 354 nitrogen. The feeding for 4 minutes at 0.09 MPa approximately produced 60 ml of liquid propane. 355 The liquid propane in the beaker was at around its freezing point (~85 K) in a liquid nitrogen bath 356 (at ~77 K) until use for cryofixation of the sample. The cryogen temperature just before use was 357 measured with a K-type thermocouple (RS PRO) connected to a temperature controller with a 358 function of automatic cold junction temperature compensation (KT4R, Panasonic Industrial 359 Devices SUNX). 360 For the inverted microscope system, nitrogen gas was continuously introduced into the cryostat. 361 The sample at room temperature (293 K) was frozen by introducing the liquid propane inside the 362 cryostat. To avoid a temperature rise of liquid propane by contact with the cooling block before 363 reaching at the sample, the cryogen introduction unit cooled with liquid nitrogen was used to 364 guide liquid propane to the sample through the hole (with a diameter of 2 mm) of the cooling 365 block. The cooling block was cooled by circulating liquid nitrogen inside immediately after 366 introduction of the cryogen until reaching at a target temperature. The introduction of nitrogen gas 367 into the cryostat was stopped by closing the vent channel of the cryostat when the temperature of 368 cooling block became close to the target temperature. The temperature was then stabilized by a 369 temperature feedback control on the speed of liquid nitrogen flux. The liquid propane remaining 370 on the sample, that could interfere with Raman measurement, was removed via evaporation by 371 either keeping the sample temperature above the propane boiling point (231 K, for Fig. 1C-F, and 372 2A-D) or introducing liquid nitrogen (for Fig.1G and 2E) on the sample to wash out the liquid 373 propane. The temperature during Raman observation was chosen so that the autofluorescence, 374 which can be increased at low temperature (Fig.S5), does not strongly disturb the Raman 375 measurement. 376 For the upright microscope system, the tissue sample at room temperature (293 K) located on a 377 copper plate with a thickness of 50 \u00b5m was frozen outside the cryostat by pouring liquid propane. 378 The copper plate possessing the frozen sample was immediately transferred to a liquid nitrogen 379 bath to replace the surrounding liquid propane with liquid nitrogen. The copper plate possessing 380 the frozen sample was then quickly transferred into the cryostat that was cooled down to 153 K in 381 advance. The liquid nitrogen surrounding the sample was evaporated naturally before starting 382 Raman measurement. The cryostat temperature was kept through the Raman imaging by liquid 383 nitrogen circulation in the cooling plate. 384 385 Data processing 386 Acquired Raman hyperspectral image data was analyzed using a custom software developed on 387 MATLAB environment (R2017b, Mathworks). For all the datasets, cosmic rays were removed in 388 each CCD frame by applying a local median filter, the bias value of CCD was subtracted, and the 389 wavenumber region of interest was cropped. Except for the quantitative SNR improvement data 390 shown in Fig. 2A and 2B, each dataset was further processed as follows: SVD was applied to a 391 Raman hyperspectral image dataset and reconstruct a new dataset for reducing the noise [35]. 392 Raman hyperspectral data of 5 s/line and 40 s/line in Fig. 2C, before and after PFA fixation in Fig. 393 2D, were combined in each one dataset prior to SVD processing. Fluorescence background was 394 subtracted from the Raman spectra with recursive polynomial fitting by the least-squares method 395\nPage 9 of 19\n[62]. To reconstruct Raman images, for all the datasets, a difference Raman intensity at two 396 wavenumbers was mapped. All the parameters of those data processing procedures are shown in 397 Table S1. 398 For the wide-field Raman image (Fig. 1E) and multi-Raman tag imaging (Fig. 2E), unexpected 399 horizontal stripes appeared due to defected pixels of the spectrophotometer camera. We corrected 400 the stripes by so called striped correction process [63], on MATLAB environment (R2023a, 401 Mathworks) (Fig. S6). Briefly, each column of a reconstructed image was divided by the mean 402 intensity projection of the image to the y axis (i.e. parallel to the line illumination) so that the 403 stripe pattern was removed. In this process, the intensity distribution intrinsic to the sample was 404 modified. To recover the intrinsic intensity distribution, the mean intensity projection was 405 smoothed by a moving average filter with 51 pixels length and the derived smoothed signal was 406 multiplied with the striped corrected image. 407 To quantify the signal amount improvement (Fig. 2B), we defined a Raman signal at a 408 wavenumber \u03bd1 (Signal\u03bd1) as a difference between the CCD counts at \u03bd1 (I\u03bd1) and another 409 wavenumber \u03bd2 (I\u03bd2), where the CCD count looked similar to the baseline at \u03bd2. We chose (745, 410 732), (2848, 2781), and (2934, 2842) cm-1 as (\u03bd1, \u03bd2) for cytochromes, lipid, and protein, 411 respectively. We selected 12 different areas which had relatively strong Raman signals at the 412 wavenumber of interest in Fig. 2A (5 x 5 pixels/area for cytochromes at and lipid, 10 x 10 413 pixels/area for protein) and took mean values as Signal\u03bd1 for each area at each exposure time by 414 using ImageJ (1.54f). In each area, the derived Signal\u03bd1 at each exposure time was divided by that 415 at 5 s/line for normalization. The average and standard deviation of normalized signals for 12 416 different areas were calculated at each exposure time. The plots of each band were fitted to a 417 linear function by using a homemade program on Python, as the Raman signal was expected to 418 increase linearly along exposure time on the basis of the following equation (eq. 1), 419 Signalv1 = Pv1Qv1t eq. 1 420 where Pv1 is the number of Raman signal photons incident to a sensor for the wavenumber \u03bd1 per 421 unit time, Q\u03bd1 is the quantum efficiency of detector at the wavelength corresponding to the 422 wavenumber \u03bd1, and t is the signal accumulation time. 423 424 References 425 [1] J.-X.
