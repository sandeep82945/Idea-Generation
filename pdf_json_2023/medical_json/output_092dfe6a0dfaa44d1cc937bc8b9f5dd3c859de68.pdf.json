    "abstractText": "Brucella, a zoonotic facultative intracellular pathogenic bacterium, poses a significant threat both to human health and to the development of the livestock industry. Alanine racemase (Alr), the enzyme responsible for alanine racemization, plays a pivotal role in regulating virulence in this bacterium. Moreover, Brucella mutants with alr gene deletions (\u2206alr) exhibit potential as vaccine candidates. However, the mechanisms that underlie the detrimental effects of alr knockouts on Brucella pathogenicity remain elusive. Here, initially, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of Alr, which demonstrated a high degree of conservation of the protein within Brucella spp. Subsequent metabolomics studies unveiled alterations in amino acid pathways following deletion of the alr gene. Furthermore, alr deletion in Brucella suis S2 induced decreased resistance to stress, antibiotics, and other factors. Transmission electron microscopy of simulated macrophage intracellular infection revealed damage to the cell wall in the \u2206alr strain, whereas propidium iodide staining and alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase assays demonstrated alterations in cell membrane permeability. Changes in cell wall properties were revealed by measurements of cell surface hydrophobicity and zeta potential. Finally, the diminished adhesion capacity of the \u2206alr strain was shown by immunofluorescence and bacterial enumeration assays. In summary, our findings indicate that the alr gene that regulates amino acid metabolism in Brucella influences the properties of the cell wall, which modulates bacterial adherence capability. This study is the first demonstration that Alr impacts virulence by modulating bacterial metabolism, thereby providing novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella spp.",

The disease elicits chronic debilitation in humans and causes reproductive maladies in animals, with profound repercussions for livestock farming, tourism, and international trade [1,2]. Following cellular entry, Brucella induces the formation of Brucella-containing vacuoles, thereby sequestering the bacterium from lysosomal engagement and evading the host immune response. The consequent persistent infection is a major challenge in the treatment and prevention of brucellosis [3]. The initial step in Brucella\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16145. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242216145 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16145 2 of 19\ninfection involves adhesion to host cells, which is a pivotal point in the pathogenic cascade, as adhesion is the primary phase in the infectious cycle of most pathogenic bacteria [4]. Most bacterial pathogens interact with the host by means of adhesive molecules (adhesins) that are displayed prominently on bacterial cell surfaces. In the case of Brucella, adhesins are categorized into filamentous (pili) adhesins that comprise complex structures composed of multiple subunits, and non-pili adhesins, which exist as monomeric or trimeric proteins. The majority of bacterial adhesins cluster within the cell wall. Thus, alterations in cell wall properties may trigger corresponding changes in bacterial adhesion capabilities [5]. Alanine racemase (Alr) belongs to the family of isomerases that act upon amino acids and their derivatives and is localized in the cytoplasm. Bacterial Alr catalyzes the conversion of L-alanine into D-alanine, with both isomers serving as crucial constituents of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans [6]. D-alanine is the most abundant D-type amino acid in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan chains. Apart from glycine, natural amino acids are categorized into D- and L-type amino acids, with D-type amino acids prevalent across numerous organisms, particularly in bacteria [7]. D-type amino acids participate in the biosynthesis of certain peptides generated through non-ribosomal pathways. Additionally, these amino acids serve as crucial regulators for various bacterial bioprocesses, including the modulation of bacterial adhesion, adjustment of bacterial surface charge, facilitation of cell wall remodeling during the stationary phase, and modulation of virulence in pathogens [8]. Despite extensive research, understanding of the functional repertoire of bacterial Alr remains limited. The current investigation of Alr primarily revolves around validation of the impact of alr deletion on cell wall phenotypes and virulence [9]. However, the broader influence of Alr on bacterial metabolism has been overlooked. The correlation between bacterial metabolism and virulence has garnered increased attention recently, which highlights the close relationship between alterations in bacterial metabolic pathways and virulence [10,11]. This study probed the metabolic changes in Brucella following alr gene deletion, assessed the resistance of the mutant strain to stressors, and examined alterations in cell wall properties due to the absence of alr. The adhesive capabilities of the mutant strain were also examined. The results revealed that Alr, through its role in modulating Brucella amino acid metabolism, influences surface hydrophobicity, the Zeta potential, and cell wall permeability, thereby impacting the adhesive capacity. This study not only expands our understanding of the multifaceted role of Alr in bacteria but also lays a foundation for further exploration of the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella."

Comparative analysis of Alr amino acid sequences in Brucella S2 showed that the homologs uniformly contained 399 amino acids, with the only variation detected at position 188. Specifically, alanine was present at this position in proteins from B. canis GB1, B. suis 1330, and B. suis S2, whereas valine was encoded at the same position in B. abortus 2308 and B. melitensis 16M.

Here, Pearson correlation n coefficients were employed to assess the strength of linear relationships between pairs of metabolites. We presented 20 significantly different metabolites, where red signifies positive correlations and blue denotes negative correlations. A deeper color and larger circular area indicate more pronounced differences among the metabolites. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) belong to the class of phospholipids, while diglyceride (DG) is classified under neutral lipids. All three are among the primary constituents of bacterial cell membranes, together forming the fundamental structure of these membranes. The primary role of the cell membrane is to maintain the stability of the internal and external cellular environments, regulate the passage of substances, and participate in intercellular interactions. We observed that metabolites associated with the cell membrane are predominantly positively correlated. Ceramide (Cer) is categorized as a sphingolipid and plays a role in regulating bacterial adhesion and invasion. Punicic acid and oxidized glutathione contribute to the regulation of bacterial resistance against oxidative stress. The results indicate that the number of positively correlated DAM pairs and negatively correlated DAM pairs is roughly equal in both Brucella suis S2 and \u2206alr strains. This observation suggests that the absence of the alr gene induces a series of metabolic changes in Brucella, which contribute to the bacterium\u2019s survival. Moreover, it signifies that the lack of the alr gene leads to alterations in the cell membrane, closely associated with bacterial adhesion and antioxidant properties. However, due to the intricate internal mechanisms of bacteria, some metabolites show positive correlations, while others exhibit negative correlations. The specific functions of these correlations will be further validated in subsequent experiments (Figure 3B)."

            "text": "The effect of deletion of the alr gene on the growth properties of B. suis S2 was assessed initially in a chemically defined medium (CDM). Growth of the \u2206alr mutant was not significantly different compared either to the wild-type strain or a mutant strain complemented with the alr gene in trans (C\u2206alr) (Figure 5A). The cell membrane is the primary sensory interface for environmental stressors in bacteria. In view of the altered membrane characteristics of the \u2206alr strain (see the following sections), we assessed whether deletion of alr impacted the stress sensitivity of B. suis S2. Survival of the \u2206alr strain was significantly lower than that of B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr strains under conditions of high osmotic pressure (2% NaCl), which suggests a critical role for alr in regulating stress resistance in B. suis S2 (Figure 5B). Furthermore, survival of the \u2206alr strain was notably lower than that of wild-type and C\u2206alr strains under acidic conditions, which indicates an important function for alr in acid stress tolerance (Figure 5C). The viability of the \u2206alr strain was also significantly reduced upon exposure to H2O2, which suggests that alr also promotes oxidative stress tolerance in B. suis S2 (Figure 5E). However, no significant differences in survival rates of the three strains were observed under high-temperature conditions (Figure 5D). EDTA is a surfactant that damages bacterial cell membranes, leading to death. As the alr deletion influenced the membrane characteristics of B. suis S2 (see the following sections), we tested the sensitivity of the deletion strain to this compound. The survival of the \u2206alr strain was significantly lower than that of B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr when exposed to 1 mM EDTA. This reduction persisted from 0.5 to 2 h, and survival of the deletion strain was close to zero at 2.5 and 3 h (Figure 5F). SDS sensitivity testing was conducted as a second approach to assess the membrane characteristics of the \u2206alr strain. Deletion of alr significantly increased the sensitivity of B. suis S2 to SDS (Figure 5G), which emphasizes the role of the Alr protein in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity.\nInt. J. Mol.

Polymyxin B is a peptide antibiotic that interacts strongly with bacterial membranes and is frequently used to assess the membrane characteristics of Brucella. Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosomal 50S subunit. The impact of alr deletion on the resistance of B. suis S2 to polymyxin B and lincomycin was evaluated. Exposure to polymyxin B at concentrations of 600 and 1200 \u00b5g/mL produced significantly lower survival rates for the \u2206alr strain compared to the wild-type and C\u2206alr strains, which indicated increased sensitivity of the deletion strain to this antibiotic (Figure 5H). B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr exhibited similar resistance levels to lincomycin after pre-treatment with different concentrations of the antibiotic for 30 min. However, the \u2206alr derivative displayed significantly reduced resistance to lincomycin (Figure 5I). Based on the results of stress assays here, we selected pH 4.5, 1.5 mM H2O2, and 2% NaCl as conditions that simulate the host intracellular environment for further experiments [12]."

There was no significant difference in CSH between \u2206alr and B. suis S2 or C\u2206alr at time zero (Figure 7A). However, the \u2206alr mutant exhibited a significant increase in CSH at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h compared to the control strains.

Similarly, very little fluorescence was observed in B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr after 24 h in the simulated intracellular environment, which indicated the absence of significantly damaged cells (Figure 7D).

            "text": "The bacterial cell wall is a distinctive structure that is absent from mammalian cells, which makes the cell wall a common target for clinically relevant antibiotics. Disruption of cell wall synthesis reduces bacterial resistance to stress and may lead to cell rupture and deformation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a membrane-bound protein in bacteria. ALP activity is undetectable in intact cells but may be evident when the cell is damaged [15]. ALP activity was used here to assess further the effect of the alr deletion on membrane integrity (Figure 7E). B. suis S2, \u2206alr, and C\u2206alr showed no significant differences in ALP activity after 12 h in the simulated intracellular environment. However, the deletion strain exhibited a significant increase in comparison to B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr at 24, 36, and 48 h. These data suggest that the deletion of alr increases the permeability of the Brucella cell wall and leads to ALP leakage under conditions that simulate the intracellular environment. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is involved in the final step of glycolysis and thus plays a crucial role in energy metabolism. The enzyme is difficult to detect in the culture medium of intact bacteria. However, LDH may leak when the cell membrane is damaged, which leads to the detection of the enzyme in the extracellular environment [16]. B. suis S2, C\u2206alr, and \u2206alr showed no differences in extracellular LDH levels at 12 h and 24 h in the simulated intracellular environment (Figure 7F). However, \u2206alr exhibited a significant increase compared to B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr at 36 and 48 h. Thus, a time-dependent increase in extracellular LDH activity was evident with B. suis \u2206alr. These data further indicate that deletion of the alr gene causes damage to the Brucella cell membrane, which leads to the leakage of intracellular components."

            "text": "The adhesion of bacteria to host cells is influenced by the properties of the bacterial cell wall, which is a primary factor for intracellular parasitic bacterial infections. Adhesion is generally regarded as an indicator of bacterial virulence. We conducted a combined study using immunofluorescence and bacterial counting methods to investigate the adhesion ability of Brucella strains with and without the alr gene. RAW264.7 cells are the main target for Brucella infection. We first performed immunofluorescence by staining RAW264.7 nuclei in blue with DAPI and Brucella in red with an Alexa-Fluor 555-conjugated antibody. It was observed by confocal microscopy that the red fluorescence intensity decreased with the \u2206alr strain compared to B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr after 1 h of infection, which indicated a significant reduction in the number of bacteria adhering to the host cells (Figure 8A). Additionally, we used bacterial counting methods, which verified that the deletion mutant exhibited a significant decrease in adhesion rates at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min compared to B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr (Figure 8B). Brucella primarily invades the reproductive and immune systems of the host after the initial infection phase. Bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEEC) are non-phagocytic cells that are one of the main targets for Brucella infection. We DAPI-stained BEEC nuclei in blue and Brucella cells in red with the Alexa-Fluor 555-conjugated antibody and examined bacterial adhesion via confocal microscopy. The red fluorescence intensity decreased significantly with the \u2206alr mutant compared to wild-type and C\u2206alr strains after 1 h of infection, which indicated a significant reduction in the number of bacteria adhering to the BEEC (Figure 9A). Moreover, bacterial counting showed that \u2206alr exhibited a significant decrease in adhesion rates compared to B. suis S2 and C\u2206alr at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (Figure 9B). In summary, the data reveal that deletion of the alr gene reduced the adhesion of Brucella to both RAW264.7 and BEEC cell lines.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "To probe the metabolic changes in Brucella following alr gene deletion, we first conducted a bioinformatics analysis to ascertain the level of conservation of the Alr protein within Brucella species. Additionally, we elucidated fundamental characteristics of the enzyme, including amino acid composition and structure. Deletion of the alr gene resulted in the upregulation of 184 metabolites and the downregulation of 211 metabolites in B. suis S2. Moreover, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that Alr primarily regulates amino acid metabolism pathways, which are closely associated with Brucella cell wall synthesis and virulence. We observed decreased resistance to diverse stress factors in Brucella following alr gene deletion. Moreover, cells with the deletion exhibited significant cell wall damage and pronounced alterations in cell membrane permeability in simulated intracellular conditions. These changes included reduced CSH and diminished Zeta potential, which lead to the inferior adhesion capability of Brucella to host cells. Sequence homology alignment of the Alr protein revealed that, apart from position 188, the sequences were entirely conserved across five diverse Brucella species. Additionally, we found that the tertiary structures of the homologs were largely congruent. These findings underscore the high degree of conservation of the Alr protein within the Brucella genus. Similarly, the Alr proteins from Burkholderia pseudomallei (BPSL2179 and BPSS0711), B. mallei (BMA1575), B. thailandensis (BTH_I2007 and BTH_II1715), Escherichia coli (EcoliDadX and EcoliAlr), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1DadX and PAO1Alr) exhibited similarity ranging from 60% to 99% [17]. This suggests minimal compositional differences in the Alr protein across diverse bacterial species, thereby enhancing the prospects of developing broad-spectrum drugs that target Alr [18]. The synthesis of bacterial cell walls requires multiple amino acids, including d-Ala, d-Glu/Gln, d-Asp, d-Met, d-Trp, and d-Phe [19,20]. Our results indicate that the deletion of alr in B. suis leads to alterations in amino acid metabolism pathways, including alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Certain metabolites were upregulated whereas others were downregulated in the mutant strain, which suggests that Brucella employs specific compensatory mechanisms to maintain normal amino acid biosynthesis when particular genes are compromised. Our findings also revealed changes in pathways related to cysteine, methionine, and pyruvate metabolism. Previous studies, including with Citrobacter rodentium, have demonstrated that changes in arginine metabolism may affect intracellular survival and adhesion capability [21]. Additionally, the cyclopropane\u2013fatty acid\u2013acyl-phospholipid synthase (cfa) gene regulates cysteine metabolism and impacts phospholipid content, hydrophobicity, and fluidity, which promotes alterations in the membrane lipid composition [22,23]. Furthermore, alanine and glutamate are upstream metabolites in pyruvate metabolism, which in turn regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, the deletion of alr in Brucella not only affects the amino acid composition but also is accompanied by energy-related changes [24]. The function of the Alr protein in bacteria has been limited to date to the interconversion of L- and D-alanine isomers. However, deletion of the alr gene results in cell wall damage and enhanced cell membrane permeability in Aeromonas hydrophila [25]. In our study, we observed a reduction in stress resistance in Brucella following alr deletion. Transmission electron microscopy revealed structural disruptions in the Brucella cell wall that were accompanied by the leakage of cytoplasmic contents. Similar results were observed in E. coli following alr gene deletion [26]. Furthermore, under simulated intracellular conditions, PI was able to penetrate the cell wall of the alr-deficient mutant, bind to intracellular DNA, and emit fluorescence. Significant increases in intracellular ALP and LDH levels were detected in the supernatant of the deletion strain. These observations suggest a change in membrane permeability in Brucella following alr deletion, as ALP and LDH activities are not typically detectable in bacterial cultures [27]. Mutation of the alr gene in Streptococcus mutans induced alterations in biofilm biomass, biofilm structure, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, glucosyltransferase (gtf ) gene expression, acid production, and acid tolerance, although bacterial-adhesion capabil-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 16145 13 of 19\nity was not examined [10]. Similarly, changes in cell wall properties were associated with alterations in the adhesion capability [8]. CSH refers to the redistribution of bacteria at the water\u2013oil interface under various forces and is a crucial factor in controlling bacterial growth [28]. In polar aqueous systems, higher CSH makes bacteria more prone to aggregation, thereby impacting normal growth. The Zeta potential refers to the electric potential at the liquid\u2013solid layer on bacterial cell surfaces, and changes in surface charge can be detected by measuring the Zeta potential [29,30]. Changes in either CSH or the Zeta potential may influence bacterial adhesion. We observed a significant increase in cell wall CSH and a marked decrease in the Zeta potential in the B. suis alr mutant compared to the wild-type strain. These results collectively indicate that alr deletion allows the penetration of external substances to the cell, which promotes increased leakage of intracellular substances. Brucella is an intracellular parasitic bacterium that is difficult to eradicate via the host immune system or using exogenous drugs. The adhesion process is crucial to the pathogenic mechanism of Brucella. The bacterium replicates within professional phagocytic cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes, as well as non-professional phagocytic cells, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and nourishing cells [31,32]. In this study, we assessed the adhesion capability of Brucella to phagocytic cells (RAW264.7) and non-phagocytic cells (BEEC) using immunofluorescence assays and bacterial-enumeration techniques, which revealed a significant decrease in adhesion capability in Brucella after alr deletion. As adhesion is a critical step in cell infection and an essential component of virulence for intracellular parasites such as Brucella, the reduced adhesion capability induced by alr deletion implies a decrease in the virulence of Brucella. In summary, this study demonstrated that the deletion of alr in Brucella primarily induced alterations in amino acid metabolism, with consequent effects on the properties of the cell wall that lead to reduced host cell adhesion. Our findings indicate for the first time that alr modulates bacterial virulence through the regulation of metabolism, thereby offering a novel perspective for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella. Furthermore, these insights provide valuable clues for the development of genetic engineering-based vaccines that target Alr and the pathways that this protein modulates."

In contrast, univariate analysis primarily centered on univariate description and statistical inference, which encompassed interval estimation and the conduction of statistical hypothesis testing. Comparative assessments of metabolites between two groups were undertaken employing Student\u2019s t-tests and fold change analyses. Furthermore, the amalgamation of multidimensional and unidimensional analyses was deployed to identify DAMs across the groups. The selection criteria consisted of a Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) value >1 for the first principal component of the OPLS-DA model and a p-value derived from a t-test < 0.05. A comprehensive metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of DAMs was executed utilizing the KEGG database in accordance with the approach elucidated by Wu et al. [38]. For investigations pertaining to different shading treatments, one-way analysis of variance was conducted, followed by a post hoc Duncan\u2019s multiple range test. Statistical analysis for this study was conducted using R software (version 3.6.2), encompassing various multivariate analyses like PCA, PLS-DA, and more, all facilitated through the \u201cropls\u201d package within R. Additionally, we utilized specific packages, such as \u201cpheatmap\u201d, \u201cggplot2\u201d, and \u201cggrepel\u201d for data visualization, as well as \u201ccorrplot\u201d for correlation analysis.

Strains were also subjected to heat stress at 42 \u25e6C in CDM for 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Furthermore, the strains were grown in CDM containing H2O2 (1.0 and 2.5 mM) for 1 h and in medium with EDTA (1 mM) for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 h. Following the various treatments, each sample was serially diluted ten-fold and plated onto TSA. Plates were incubated at 37 \u25e6C for three days, and the survival of each strain was calculated by dividing the CFU of the treated bacteria by the CFU of the untreated samples. For the SDS sensitivity assay, Brucella strains (104\u2013106 CFUs /mL) were subjected to tenfold dilution, and 10 \u00b5L of the diluted samples was inoculated onto TSA plates containing 0.00325% SDS.
