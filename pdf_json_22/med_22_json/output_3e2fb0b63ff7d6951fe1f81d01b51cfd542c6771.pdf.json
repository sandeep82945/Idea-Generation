            "text": "Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% (1). Among esophageal cancer subtypes, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common (1). Although several treatment modalities have emerged, surgical resection and concurrent radiochemotherapy remain major modalities in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Despite remarkable advances of treatment modalities, the mortality rate of patients with esophageal cancer remains high (2). Effective and easily obtainable biomarkers will be valuable in identifying patients with ESCC who may benefit from surgery or concurrent radiochemotherapy. The pathological TNM is an important prognostic indicator in patients with cancer. However, pretreatment biomarkers are rarely used to predict the prognosis of patients with ESCC, and to our best knowledge, no studies have proposed a prognostic index for patients undergoing concurrent radiochemotherapy.\nAt present, there were many studies on clinical or basic indicators to predict prognosis (3, 4). Recent reports have utilized hemostatic factors and nutritional status to determine patient prognosis after surgery (5). Hyperfibrinogenemia and decrease albumin levels, which is reflected in the level of plasma fibrinogen and serum albumin (FA) (6\u201311), have been demonstrated to be related to the malignant behaviors of various types of cancer. The FA score, calculated as the plasma fibrinogen level divided by the serum albumin level, may reflect the prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer after surgery (12). However, its usefulness for predicting the efficacy of concurrent radiochemotherapy in ESCC has not been evaluated. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the usefulness of FA score in predicting the short-term therapeutic benefit of\nC, receiver operating\narcinoma; FA score,\nted tomography; IL,\nPR, partial response;\necrosis factor; DCR,\n02\nconcurrent radiochemotherapy and survival of patients with ESCC. Further investigations were made to confirm the prognostic effect of the nutritional index and immune factors after concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with ESCC."

ROC curves showed that the optimal cut-off levels for serum albumin and plasma fibrinogen were 43.7 g/L and 2.67 g/L, respectively. Based on these cut-off values, the albumin and fibrinogen levels were categorized into two subgroups. The FA score was then divided into three categories based on these cut-off values: (1) a score of 0 indicated a serum albumin level > 43.7 g/L and a plasma fibrinogen level < 2.67 g/L; (2) a score of 1 indicated that either the serum albumin level was < 43.7 g/L or the plasma fibrinogen level was > 2.67 g/L; and (3) a score of 2 indicated a low albumin level (< 43.7 g/L) and a high fibrinogen level (> 2.67 g/L).\nCorrelation analysis between pretreatment FA score and clinical characteristics\nAs shown in Table 1, the FA score was divided into three groups based on serum albumin and plasma fibrinogen levels. There were 15 (9.7%), 46 (29.9%), and 93 (60.4%) patients with a score of 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The FA score had no significant relationship with sex, age, smoking history, T stage, or TNM stage, but it was significantly associated with the N stage (P = 0.015) and the M stage (P = 0.042).\nShort-term efficacy analysis\nAll 154 patients underwent efficacy evaluation by CT, upper gastrointestinal radiography, and endoscopy 1-3 months after the end of concurrent radiochemotherapy.

The FA score was significantly correlated with the curative effect of radiochemotherapy (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with a FA score of 0 reached 100%, that is, no patients showed disease progression. Meanwhile, 12 and 30 patients with a FA score of 1 achieved CR and PR, respectively, and the ORR was 91.30%. In patients with a FA score of 2, the ORR was 67.74%, but CR was achieved in only 5 patients, accounting for only 5.38% of the total group. Accordingly, significant differences were observed between patients with different FA score, with P-values less than 0.001.

            "text": "undergo pathological staging, common prognostic indicators such as the pTNM stage, immunohistochemical features, and other factors cannot be used to evaluate treatment effect. Therefore, an economical, convenient, and objective testing indicator is needed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of concurrent radiochemotherapy in ESCC. The present study shows that the pretreatment FA score is significantly associated with N stage, M stage, and the therapeutic efficacy of radiochemotherapy in ESCC. Higher FA score is associated with a poorer treatment effect and shorter OS. This\nindicates that the pretreatment FA score may be an important indicator of the therapeutic effect of radiochemotherapy in ESCC.\nFibrinogen is upregulated by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 in the liver; thus, the plasma fibrinogen level can reflect tumor progression (13). Previous studies have reported that fibrinogen levels are associated with the prognosis of multiple solid tumors (14, 15). In addition, high fibrinogen levels are associated with prognosis and treatment failure in various tumors, including pancreatic, gastric, lung, and colon cancer\n(16\u201319). Furthermore, hyperfibrinogenemia has been confirmed to be closely associated with tumor progression (19). In esophageal cancer patients, plasma fibrinogen levels predict postoperative recurrence and survival (14, 20). In addition, fibrinogen is closely associated with metastasis in circulating tumor cells (21, 22). Fibrinogen may play an important role in the development, invasion, metastasis, and recurrence of various tumors. Plasma albumin produced by the liver is one of the indicators used to evaluate nutritional status and is also an independent prognostic indicator in various tumors (23). Studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia is associated with postoperative complications and poor prognosis in several cancers (11, 24, 25).\nMatsuda et al. were the first to propose the FA score, calculated as the ratio of fibrinogen to plasma albumin, as a new prognostic marker in cancer (12). Moreover, as a mixed indicator, the FA score can reflect the nutritional status, but also the inflammatory level and coagulation status of patients. A previous study assessed the prognostic impact of FA levels in esophageal cancer, however, the study enrolled patients eligible\nFrontiers in Oncology 06\nfor surgical treatment (12). This study evaluated the therapeutic effect and OS of patients with non-operative esophageal cancer treated with concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to the FA score. To our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the CR, PR, SD, and PD after concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these patients. The tumor microenvironment includes inflammatory cells, immune cells, and cytokines. The interaction of these components in the microenvironment jointly promotes tumor occurrence and development (26). Fibrinogen is an important indicator of systemic inflammation and is closely related to the coagulation system and cytokine production. Fibrinogens regulate inflammatory responses by inducing monocytes to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (27). Inflammatory responses induced in the tumor microenvironment have been implicated in cancer progression (28). The deposition of fibrinogen promotes the interaction between tumor cells and platelets and accelerates the formation of thrombin, a process that protects tumor cells from natural killer cells (29). In\nfrontiersin.org\naddition, activated coagulation and fibrinolysis systems promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Studies have shown that elevated concentrations of platelets, D-dimer, and antithrombin III are associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (30\u201332). Tumor cells can secrete fibrinogen, which in turn can promote the proliferation and angiogenesis of tumor cells, thus improving their immune invasion ability (33\u201335). This process appears to be a vicious cycle. Fibrinogen acting as a scaffold binding, together with fibroblast growth factor\u20132 and vascular endothelial growth factor, can promote the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells (36, 37). The anchoring effect of fibrinogen on growth factors also promotes tumor proliferation and stimulates tumor-related vascular formation (38). Palumb et al. showed decreased incidences of spontaneous hematogenous and lymphatic metastases in tumor-bearing mice after the elimination of circulating fibrinogen (21).\nPlasma albumin produced by the liver coordinates transport, maintains intravascular pressure, and clears free radicals (39). It is not only a commonly used indicator to evaluate the nutritional status of the body, but is also used to assess the inflammatory status (24). Malnutrition, which might be reflected by low serum albumin levels, can weaken defense, including the anatomic barriers, cellular and humoral immunity, and phagocyte function (11). Chronic inflammatory response is also associated with tumor proliferation, progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Patients with malignant tumors often experience hypoalbuminemia caused by the release of a large number of cytokines, including IL-6 released by tumor cells, which can inhibit the synthesis and secretion of albumin by liver cells. TNF-a, which is related to tumors, is also related to albumin levels. In summary, fibrinogen and plasma albumin play a negative role in the occurrence and development of tumors through several mechanisms, which can also explain the ability of the FA score to be predictive of the treatment efficacy and survival of patients receiving concurrent radiochemotherapy.\nIn conclusion, a grading system based on the FA score has clinical value for predicting the therapeutic effects of concurrent radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer. This economical, costeffective, and practical index can be a useful indicator for planning therapeutic strategies for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy.\nThe limitations of this study include its small sample size and single-center retrospective design. In addition, the predictive capability of the FA score for the therapeutic effect of radiochemotherapy was not verified in the validation cohort, thus limiting the clinical value of this study. Moreover, few basic clinical characteristics of the patients could be collected, preventing further subgroup analysis. In addition, the FA score lacks a universal derivation standard and has to be calculated based on specific values for each patient sample. This raises concern of generalizability and is a major limitation in terms of serving as a predictive factor. Amulticenter prospective study with a large sample size is warranted to verify the usefulness of the FA score for predicting the therapeutic effect of radiochemotherapy.\nFrontiers in Oncology 07"
