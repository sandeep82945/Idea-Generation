    "abstractText": "Background Clinical supervisors play an integral role in preparing podiatry graduates for clinical practice. Not enough is, however, known about how prepared podiatry clinical supervisors are for this role, in terms of training received and the challenges they face in the role. Informed by previous qualitative research, this study extends our understanding of what it means to be a clinical supervisor in podiatry. Methods An online survey comprising closed and open-ended questions gathered data from 67 registered podiatrists who were also clinical supervisors. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Chi-square analysis was used to test independence between preparedness for supervision and variables of interest (e.g. training received). Item analysis was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients and Kendall\u2019s Tau to determine whether statistically significant associations existed across the broad challenges previously identified (i.e. supervisor-specific, curriculum and students). Open-ended comments were analysed using content analysis. Results Generally, most supervisors (64%, 43/67) initially felt \u201c prepared\u201d to supervise, despite the majority (58%, 39/67) not having received any training or educational support. Overwhelming, supervisors (97%, 65/67) considered universities responsible for ensuring quality clinical supervision. They perceived many of the previously identified supervisor-specific challenges (e.g. time-consuming), curriculum issues (e.g. limited hands-on patient contact in private practice placements) and student deficiencies (e.g. poor time management). Positive correlations were found across the three sets of challenges, with the strongest measure of association found between overall student deficiencies and overall curriculum issues (p < .001). Conclusion These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of clinical supervision in podiatry. The study identified inconsistent support for clinical supervisors from partner universities. This study found a clear desire and need for supervisor training. A partnership approach is recommended in which universities work with clinical supervisors to address their overall challenges in terms of supervisor professional development, paying attention to curriculum issues, and improving student preparedness during placements.",

Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Chi-square analysis was used to test independence between preparedness for supervision and variables of interest (e.g. training received). Item analysis was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients and Kendall\u2019s Tau to determine whether statistically significant associations existed across the broad challenges previously identified (i.e. supervisor-specific, curriculum and students). Open-ended comments were analysed using content analysis.\nResults Generally, most supervisors (64%, 43/67) initially felt \u201c prepared\u201d to supervise, despite the majority (58%, 39/67) not having received any training or educational support. Overwhelming, supervisors (97%, 65/67) considered universities responsible for ensuring quality clinical supervision. They perceived many of the previously identified supervisor-specific challenges (e.g. time-consuming), curriculum issues (e.g. limited hands-on patient contact in private practice placements) and student deficiencies (e.g. poor time management). Positive correlations were found across the three sets of challenges, with the strongest measure of association found between overall student deficiencies and overall curriculum issues (p < .001).\nConclusion These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of clinical supervision in podiatry. The study identified inconsistent support for clinical supervisors from partner universities. This study found a clear desire and need for supervisor training. A partnership approach is recommended in which universities work with clinical supervisors to address their overall challenges in terms of supervisor professional development, paying attention to curriculum issues, and improving student preparedness during placements.\nKeywords Clinical supervision, Training, Podiatry, Partnership"

For many registered podiatrists in Australia and New Zealand, taking on the role of clinical supervisor of undergraduate podiatry students is voluntary, often to meet continuing professional development requirements pertaining to community service [5]. In addition, the public health system in particular expects employees (at various levels) to provide clinical supervision to junior health professionals including undergraduate students from the same discipline. It is therefore likely that many registered and practicing podiatrists are appointed as clinical supervisors, with the assumption that as practitioners in their discipline [6], they will also supervise podiatry students on placements.\nBeing a clinical supervisor, however, necessitates an expansion of professional identity from clinician to the dual roles of clinician and supervisor [7]. For Watkins and Milne [4], clinical supervision should be recognised as a distinct, area of professional practice, with its own process, models and approaches. In their opinion, clinical supervisory skills do not \u201cfall from the sky\u201d (p.178). Training and professional development are required. Whilst training to be an effective clinical supervisor is considered essential amongst the health professions [8], approaches to supervisory training in podiatry have not been extensively documented. Informed by an earlier exploratory qualitative study (October 2015-May 2016) of clinical supervisors\u2019 preparedness to supervise podiatry students in Australia [9], a larger sample of clinical supervisors was surveyed to further explore their experiences, preparedness, and training for the role, as well as previously identified curriculum issues and student preparedness for clinical placements. A greater understanding of these considerations will hopefully inform effective training and support for clinical supervisors, particularly considering that currently podiatry graduates in Australia and New Zealand (and in some countries internationally, e.g. United Kingdom, South Africa) enter clinical practice without an internship or clinical supervision. As podiatry graduates need to \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 as safe and competent health care providers, quality supervision during clinical placements should be an imperative.\nThe following research questions informed this study:\n(1) What training or educational support did clinical supervisors receive to prepare them for this role? (2) At supervision commencement, how prepared were clinical supervisors to supervise podiatry students? (3) In terms of previously identified challenges (self, curriculum, and student-related), which were most pressing for clinical supervisors?"

A combination of closed (including Likert scale items) and open-ended questions (comment boxes) were included. The survey was piloted (i.e. for face and content validity) with two registered podiatrists who were clinical supervisors (excluded from the data analysis). Pilot participants provided feedback on content and format, including language suitability in item wording and intention, to allow minor survey refinement for clarity [12]."

To enable subsequent application of statistical test methods like chi-square test and for ease of interpretation purposes, some questions were collapsed into dichotomous variables, e.g. age groups (i.e. \u201844 and under\u2019, \u201845 and above\u2019), \u2018prepared to supervise\u2019 \u2013 \u201csomewhat prepared\u201d or better (i.e. \u201cvery prepared\u201d, vs. \u2018unprepared to supervise\u2019 \u2013 \u201csomewhat unprepared\u201d or worse (i.e. \u201cnot at all prepared\u201d); years practising as a podiatrist \u2013 \u201cpre1999\u201d vs. \u201cpost 2000\u201d; years supervising \u2013 \u201c5\u00a0 years or less\u201d vs. \u201c5\u00a0years or more\u201d.

To test whether there was any significant relationship (and strength of correlation) between two independent items relating to challenges, Kendall\u2019s tau were used given the small data set [14]. Since these were ordinal variable (i.e. Likert scale), this method was considered appropriate [15]. As comparisons of individual challenges in one or more tables would be very cumbersome, we chose to compute a mean variable from each challenge set to create overall variable mean scores, and the same with the total items variable score (i.e. 29 items, overall mean) for a more concise\ninterpretation of these data. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.28.0. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.\nFree text comments were analysed using content analysis [16] to enable simple reporting of common issues and given the exploratory nature of our research [17]. Initial identification of coding categories was undertaken by the principal researcher (KR) becoming familiar by reading and re-reading the qualitative data. An iterative process of categorising and re-categorising was involved. Manageable code categories were then sorted into themes. Both researchers (KR & MM) regularly discussed the analysis to ensure consistency and agreement through the process and to permit finalising for reporting."

An overall perception score, ranging from 1 to 5, was calculated using the mean (SD) of all challenge item ratings for each respondent.\nIn terms of supervisor-specific challenges, the timeconsuming nature of supervision was the main challenge (85%), followed by the limited support they received (61.2%) and the lack of standardised assessment (61.2%). With respect to curriculum issues, the three most frequently identified challenges were: A lack of training in small business administration skills for practice (67.2%), students having limited contact with patients despite the prescribed 1000\u00a0 h of placement (67.2%) and students having limited \u2018hands-on\u2019 patient contact in private practice placements, impacting on learning (67.1%).

            "heading": "Supervisor\u2011specific challenges",
            "text": "When presented with a range of supervisor-specific challenges, foremost was the time-consuming nature of clinical supervision, which is consistent with the literature across healthcare professionals. Rothwell et\u00a0 al. [18] in their evidence review, classified \u2018lack of time\u2019 as one of the main problems impacting quality clinical supervision. Competing clinical duties can also play a part in supervisors not being able to \u2018find time\u2019 for clinical supervision [19]. The second important challenge relates to a lack of adequate support and resources (i.e. limited university support and/or resource for supervisory role), which when coupled with the third challenge of a lack of standardised assessment criteria between universities likely places unnecessary pressure on the supervisor, possibly forcing them to \u2018figure things out\u2019 for themselves [18], rather than having clarity from specific guidance and/or guidelines to fulfil the role adequately [20]. Clinical supervisors, therefore require both pedagogical and organisational resources to be able to focus on patient care and student learning [21]. From these findings, it was no surprise that most respondents also agreed with the statement: Supervisors\u2019 experience fatigue, stress and\nburnout from students, which support the Hyrk\u00e4s study of clinical supervision in psychiatric nurses, in which burnout (and low self-efficacy) was associated with a lack of support and supervisory dissatisfaction [22], and Rothwell and colleagues conclusion that a lack of ongoing support and engagement from leadership (e.g. the university) and organisation (e.g. the workplace) are real barriers to effective clinical supervision [18].\nSurprisingly, while most respondents had received little or no training when they began supervising, they generally felt prepared for the role. For some, this related to further education and training they had already undertaken while others relied on their years of experience in clinical practice. For the more recent graduates (least supervisory experience), they drew on their personal experience as students being supervised. Whilst there was no statistical association between initial preparedness to supervise and years practicing, holding an opinion that years of podiatry practice is sufficient to supervise is concerning as it may hamper any pursuit and/or involvement in supervisor professional development, as these supervisors may not see the value of continuing professional development as a supervisor and could reflect a false impression of what is required to be an effective supervisor.\nAs Higgs and McAllister confirm, despite the role of \u2018teaching\u2019 being inherent in clinical practice (e.g. educating patients), when becoming a clinical supervisor, the clinician must transition into a new culture and set of responsibilities through organised training [23]. Further, relying on behavioural role modelling from a past supervisory relationship as means to supervise by emulating their actions [24], can be severely limited, particularly given individuals learn in different ways [25]. Whilst this respondent comment likely stemmed from an effective supervisor-supervisee relationship, as Sellers et\u00a0 al. [26] emphasise, problems in a past supervisory relationship for others may lead to, for example, an avoidance of becoming a supervisor due to a history of aversive\ninteractions (and perhaps explanation for respondents indicating \u2018no\u2019 interest in becoming a supervisor in our initial sample). Without explicit training about learning and supervisory styles, the clinical supervisor would likely not appreciate the need to adjust this \u2018preferred\u2019 style in response to the perceived learning style of another student [25]. Such findings therefore raise opportunity for future research specific to the influence of supervisory styles and valued supervisory relationships on supervision outcomes in podiatry education. On a separate note, two years post registration to become a supervisor, begs additional enquiry around the appropriate number of years out practising prior to becoming a supervisor. In psychology, for example, an individual is not eligible to supervise unless they have held general registration for at least three years, and successfully completed full supervisory training with a board approved provider [27].\nIndeed, many did identify that a lack of supervisory training and/or support resulted in their initial unpreparedness to supervise (despite also the years of clinical practise already behind them). This was found in the qualitative comments, confirming our earlier research, i.e. \u201cThose who discussed receiving no supervision training or related professional development support also felt that they were not prepared for their supervisory roles\u201d [9]. There was also general agreement with the statement that a Lack of formal and/or informal training contributes to uncertainty as a supervisor. As Martin et\u00a0 al. [2] explain, a lack of training in supervision is said to contribute to confusion regarding the supervision process, and undertaking training in supervision can assist supervisor preparedness in keeping up-to-date with evidence regarding effective clinical supervision practices. In fact, some clinical supervisors in the current study, mentioned later having undertaken formal training in supervision to assist their professional role development. Such actions reinforce how supervisory skills should not be taken for granted by virtue of experience, with training necessary to ensure that when clinicians become supervisors they also become skilled to supervise [2]. A more consistent approach to clinical supervisory training, preferably based on continuing appraisal of supervisors\u2019 educational needs [28], is, however, necessary given participants\u2019 minimal or varied training and/or support."

It is wellknown that \u201chands-on\u201d clinical exposure allows the application of theory to practice and promotes clinical\nskill development and self-efficacy [29]. Lack of training in small business administration for students was also a highly rated issue amongst respondents, a finding supported by McAllister and Nagarajan [30] of newly graduated allied health professionals not having much understanding of business practice. Bearing in mind that most podiatrists in Australia and New Zealand are in private practice (i.e. small business organisations), it would be particularly beneficial for final year students to have knowledge of the common administrative requirements necessary in practice prior to graduation."

Specifically, time management is about how one manages self [31], and for setting priorities, planning and implementing these in the available time [32]. Ghiasvand et\u00a0al. [33] reinforce how time management skills are essential for clinical competence development, and Marthur et\u00a0al. [32] assert time management can be successfully achieved by setting realistic goals, and by learning and consistent practice. Likewise, the agreement ratings associated with students show limited ability to carry out basic manual podiatry clinical skill procedures, lack confidence in their clinical skills and lack independence when providing patient care, indicate much need for improving podiatry students\u2019 clinical skill experience and performance during clinical placements to ensure safe and independent practice at graduation. As Porter et\u00a0al. [34] emphasise in nursing student education, self-confidence is a key component for effective clinical performance, and from more exposure to clinical placement, confidence and motivation levels will only improve. From our findings, it is clear that universities have a responsibility to produce graduates who are both competent and confident for practice in the clinical setting [34], and further research is thus recommended to identify causes of poor self-confidence in podiatry students on placement given the implications.\nAs the strongest statistical association (in terms of Kendall\u2019s tau) is seen with overall student deficiencies and overall curriculum issues, the implication of this finding highlights the increased strain this is likely to place on clinical supervisors. Since the university needs to meet accreditation standards for podiatry training, it goes without saying that this commands quality supervision and as such requires the institution to ensure that all clinical supervisors meet minimum standards though providing the time, resources and training. Addressing the curriculum and student challenges should also be addressed via more focused hands-on clinical training at the very least."

With many placements cancelled at the onset of the pandemic and significant adjustments made, negatively impacting the clinical learning of students across the health professions [36].

            "text": "This study contributes to a deeper understanding of what it means to be a podiatry clinical supervisor pre-COVID. Training is clearly necessary to support the initial and ongoing role of the clinical supervisor (and to foster their professional identity development), particularly given clinical supervision cuts to the heart of professional podiatry training. Many of the challenges identified [9] were perceived by clinical supervisors, including the timeconsuming nature of student supervision, along with role uncertainty likely stemming from limited university support and a lack of standardised assessment criteria creating difficulties for supervisors. Similarly, these clinical supervisors were in agreement with a number of previously identified curriculum issues: primarily students having limited hands-on contact with patients, which from this (and to be expected) causing student deficiency areas requiring further attention, specific to poor time management skills, inability to prioritise patient care, and a lack of independence and confidence in their clinical skills. These findings shed light on the complexity of the supervisor role. With the majority of clinical supervisors feeling initially \u2018somewhat prepared\u2019 to undertake their supervisory role, coupled with conditions that could limit good learning environments for the students they supervise, it is more than apparent that the universities must step up to support clinical supervisors, but, registered podiatrists who undertake the role of clinical supervisor must also share responsibility to upskill. The profession should consider minimum criteria for clinical supervisors, similar to the clinical competencies established for entry-level graduates, which in our opinion might\ninclude for example, accrual of a specific number of continuing education points for attendance at regular clinical supervision training sessions and/or encouragement for tertiary based qualification in health professional education or similar. Research on clinical supervision in podiatry practice is in a very early phase of development globally. While the present findings validate our results of prior research and provide additional details about the nature of clinical supervision, further investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of this critical activity and to better prepare our new graduates, albeit safely, competently and confidently.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12909- 023- 04056-z.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Appendix\u00a01.
