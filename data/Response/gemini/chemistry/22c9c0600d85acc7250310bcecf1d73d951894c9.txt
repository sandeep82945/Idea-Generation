1. **Investigate the effect of different lipid compositions on the stability and release properties of MRPLs.** This could be done by varying the ratio of phospholipids to cholesterol, or by using different types of phospholipids.
2. **Explore the use of MRPLs for the delivery of other bioactive compounds.** This could include compounds that are sensitive to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, or compounds that need to be targeted to specific cells or tissues.
3. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of MRPLs in animal models.** This would involve conducting studies to assess the toxicity, bioavailability, and efficacy of MRPLs in vivo.
4. **Develop MRPLs for use in clinical trials.** This would involve scaling up the production of MRPLs and conducting clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy in humans.
5. **Investigate the use of MRPLs for the delivery of drugs to the brain.** This could be done by using MRPLs that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier.
