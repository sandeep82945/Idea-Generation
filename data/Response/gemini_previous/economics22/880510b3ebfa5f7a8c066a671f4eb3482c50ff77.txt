1. **Investigate the transferability of costs between different regions within MENA.** The study focused on the transferability of costs within MENA as a whole, but it would be interesting to see how costs transfer between different regions within the region. For example, are costs more transferable between countries with similar economic profiles or between countries with similar healthcare systems?
2. **Examine the transferability of costs for different types of healthcare interventions.** The study focused on the transferability of costs for direct medical costs, but it would be interesting to see how costs transfer for other types of healthcare interventions, such as indirect costs or non-medical costs.
3. **Explore the impact of different costing methods on the transferability of costs.** The study assumed that costs were measured using the same costing methodology in the same costing year, but it would be interesting to see how the transferability of costs is affected by different costing methods. For example, are costs more transferable if they are measured using a standardized costing protocol?
4. **Develop a more comprehensive cost transfer formula that includes additional macroeconomic indicators.** The study developed a cost transfer formula that includes only GDP per capita, but it would be interesting to see how the accuracy of the formula could be improved by including additional macroeconomic indicators, such as total health expenditure per capita or governmental health expenditure per capita.
5. **Conduct a prospective study to validate the cost transfer formula.** The study used a retrospective analysis of published costs to develop the cost transfer formula, but it would be interesting to conduct a prospective study to validate the formula. For example, researchers could collect cost data from a sample of countries in MENA and then use the formula to predict the costs in other countries. The accuracy of the predictions could then be compared to the actual costs.
