    "abstractText": "In particle-based computer simulations of polydisperse glassforming systems, the particle diameters \u03c3 = \u03c31, . . . , \u03c3N of a system with N particles are chosen with the intention to approximate a desired distribution density f with the corresponding histogram. One method to accomplish this is to draw each diameter randomly from the density f . We refer to this stochastic scheme as model S. Alternatively, one can apply a deterministic method, assigning an appropriate set of N values to the diameters. We refer to this method as model D. We show that especially for the glassy dynamics at low temperatures it matters whether one chooses model S or model D. Using molecular dynamics computer simulation, we investigate a three-dimensional polydisperse non-additive soft-sphere system with f(s) \u223c s\u22123. The Swap Monte Carlo method is employed to obtain equilibrated samples at very low temperatures. We show that for model S the sample-to-sample fluctuations due to the quenched disorder imposed by the diameters \u03c3 can be explained by an effective packing fraction. Dynamic susceptibilities in model S can be split into two terms: One that is of thermal nature and can be identified with the susceptibility of model D, and another one originating from the disorder in \u03c3. At low temperatures the latter contribution is the dominating term in the dynamic susceptibility.",

One method to accomplish this is to draw each diameter randomly from the density f . We refer to this stochastic scheme as model S.

We show that for model S the sample-to-sample fluctuations due to the quenched disorder imposed by the diameters \u03c3 can be explained by an effective packing fraction. Dynamic susceptibilities in model S can be split into two terms: One that is of thermal nature and can be identified with the susceptibility of model D, and another one originating from the disorder in \u03c3. At low temperatures the latter contribution is the dominating term in the dynamic susceptibility.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMany of the colloidal systems that have been used to study the glass transition are polydisperse [1]. While monodisperse colloidal fluids crystallize very easily, with the introduction of a size polydispersity they become good glassformers [2\u20139]. As a matter of fact, the degree of polydispersity \u03b4, defined as the standard deviation of the particle diameter divided by the mean particle diameter, may strongly affect glassy dynamics. For example, for three-dimensional hard-sphere colloids, it has been shown that for moderate polydispersity \u03b4 < 10% a dynamic freezing is typically seen for a packing fraction \u03c6g \u2248 0.58, while for \u03b4 & 10%, the dynamics are more heterogeneous with the large particles undergoing a glass transition at \u03c6g while the small particles are still mobile (note that this result is dependent on the distribution of particle diameters) [8]. An interesting finding regarding the effect of polydispersity on the dynamics has been reported in a simulation study of a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones model [10]. Here, Klochko et al. show that polydispersity is associated with composition fluctuations that, even well above the glass-transition temperature, lead to a two-step relaxation of the dynamic structure factor at low wavenumbers and a long-time tail in the time-dependent heat capacity. These examples demonstrate that polydispersity and the specific distribution of particle diameters may strongly affect the static and dynamic properties of glassforming fluids.\nIn a particle-based computer simulation, one can assign to each particle i a \u201cdiameter\u201d \u03c3i. Note that in the following the diameter of a particle does not refer to the geometric diameter of a hard sphere, but in a more general sense it is a parameter with the dimension of a length that appears in the interaction potential between soft spheres (see below). To realize a polydisperse sys-\ntem in the simulation of an N particle system, one selects the N particle diameters to approximate a desired distribution density f(\u03c3) with the corresponding histogram. Here, two approaches have been used in previous simulation studies. In a stochastic method, referred to as model S in the following, one uses random numbers to independently draw each diameter \u03c3i from the distribution f . As a consequence, one obtains a \u201cconfiguration\u201d of particle diameters that differs from sample to sample. Alternatively, to avoid this disorder, one can choose the N diameters in a deterministic manner, i.e. one defines a map (f, N) 7\u2192 (\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3N ), which uniquely determines N diameter values. In the following, we refer to this approach as model D. The diameters in model D should be selected such that in the limit N \u2192\u221e the histogram of diameters converges to f as being the case for model S. Unlike model S, each sample of size N of model D has exactly the same realization of particle diameters.\nRecent simulation studies on polydisperse glassformers have either used model S (see, e.g., Refs. [8, 10\u201317]) or model D schemes (see, e.g., Refs. [18\u201320]). However, a systematic study is lacking where both approaches are compared. This is especially important when one considers states of glassforming liquids at very low temperatures (or high packing fractions) where dynamical heterogeneities are a dominant feature of structural relaxation. For polydisperse systems, such deeply supercooled liquid states have only recently become accessible in computer simulations, using the Swap Monte Carlo technique [21, 22]. For these states, the additional sample-tosample fluctuations in model S are expected to strongly affect static and dynamic fluctuations in the system, as quantified by appropriate susceptibilities.\nIn this work, we compare a model S to a model D approach for a polydisperse glassformer, using molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation in combination\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n15 52\n8v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n3 0\nSe p\n20 22\n2 with the Swap Monte Carlo (SWAP) technique. This hybrid scheme allows to equilibrate samples at very low temperatures far below the critical temperature of mode coupling theory. We analyze static and dynamic susceptibilities and their dependence on temperature T and system size N , keeping the number density constant. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, N \u2192 \u221e, the sample-to-sample fluctuations of model S lead to a finite static disorder susceptibility of extensive observables. This result is numerically shown for the potential energy. Moreover, we analyze fluctuations of a timedependent overlap correlation function Q(t) via a dynamic susceptibility \u03c7(t). At low temperatures, \u03c7 in model S is strongly enhanced when compared to the one in model D. This finding indicates that it is crucial to carefully analyze the disorder due to size polydispersity when one uses a model S approach.\nIn the next section II, we introduce the model for a polydisperse soft-sphere system and define the models S and D. The main details of the simulations are given in Sec. III. Then, Sec. IV is devoted to the analysis of static fluctuations of the potential energy. Here, we discuss in detail thermal fluctuations in terms of the specific heat CV (T ) and static sample-to-sample fluctuations by a disorder susceptibility. In Sec. V, dynamic fluctuations of the overlap function Q(t) are investigated. Finally, in Sec. VI, we summarize and draw conclusions."

            "text": "Particle interactions. As a model glassformer, we consider a polydisperse non-additive soft-sphere system of N particles in three dimensions. This model has been proposed by Ninarello et al. [14]. The particles are placed in a cubic box of volume V = L3, where L is the linear dimension of the box. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the three spatial directions. The particles have identical masses m and their positions and velocities are denoted by ri and vi, i = 1, . . . , N , respectively. The time evolution of the system is given by Hamilton\u2019s equations of motion with Hamiltonian H = K+U . Here,\nK = \u2211N i=1 p 2 i /m is the total kinetic energy and pi = mvi the momentum of particle i. Interactions between the particles are pairwise such that the total potential energy U can be written as\nU = N\u22121\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 j>i u(rij/\u03c3ij) . (1)\nHere the argument of the interaction potential u is x = rij/\u03c3ij , where rij = |~ri \u2212 ~rj | denotes the absolute value of the distance vector between particles i and j. The parameter \u03c3ij is related to the \u201cdiameters\u201d \u03c3i and \u03c3j , respectively, as specified below. The pair potential u is given by\nu(x) = u0 ( x\u221212 + c0 + c2x 2 + c4x 4 ) \u0398(xc \u2212 x) , (2)\nwhere the Heaviside step function \u0398 introduces a dimensionless cutoff xc = 1.25. The unit of energy is defined by u0. The constants c0 = \u221228/x12c , c2 = 48/x14c , and c4 = \u221221/x16c ensure continuity of u at xc up to the second derivative.\nWe consider a polydisperse system, i.e. each particle is allowed to have a different diameter \u03c3i. In the following, lengths are given in units of the mean diameter \u03c3\u0304, to be specified below. A non-additivity of the particle diameters is imposed in the sense that\n\u03c3ij = \u03c3i + \u03c3j\n2 (1\u2212 0.2|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j |) . (3)\nThis non-additivity has been introduced to suppress crystallization [14] which is in fact provided down to temperatures far below the critical temperature of mode coupling theory.\nChoice of particle diameters. The diameters \u03c3i of the particles are chosen according to two different protocols. In model S, each diameter is drawn independently from the same probability density f(\u03c3). In model D, the diameters for a system of size N are chosen in a deterministic manner such that their histogram approximates f in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. As in Ref. [14], we consider a function f(\u03c3) \u223c \u03c3\u22123. In the case of an additive hard-sphere system, this probability density ensures that within each diameter interval of constant width the same volume is occupied by the spheres.\nModel S. For model S, particle diameters \u03c3i are independently and identically distributed, each according to the same distribution density\nf(\u03c3) = A\u03c3\u221231[\u03c3m,\u03c3M](\u03c3) . (4)\nHere 1B(\u03c3) denotes the indicator function, being one if \u03c3 \u2208 B and 0 otherwise. The normalization \u222b f(\u03c3) d\u03c3 = 1 is provided by the choice A = 2/(\u03c3\u22122m \u2212 \u03c3\u22122M ). We define the unit of length as the expectation value of the diameter,\n\u03c3\u0304 = \u222b \u03c3f(\u03c3) d\u03c3 , (5)\nwhich implies \u03c3M = \u03c3m/(2\u03c3m \u2212 1). We set the lower diameter bound to \u03c3m = 29/40 = 0.725. Thus, the upper bound is given by \u03c3M = 29/18 = 1.61 and the amplitude in Eq. (4) is A = 29/22 = 1.318. Note that the ratio \u03c3m/\u03c3M = 20/9 = 2.2, chosen in this work, deviates by less than 0.24% from the values 2.219 and 2.217 reported in Refs. [14] and [23], respectively. The degree of polydispersity \u03b4 can be defined via the equation \u03b42 = \u222b (s \u2212 \u03c3\u0304)2f(s)ds/\u03c3\u03042 and has the value \u03b4 \u2248 22.93% in our case. In practice, random numbers \u03c3 following a distribution f can be generated from a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1] via the method of inversion of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). The CDF is defined as\nF (\u03c3) = \u222b \u03c3 \u2212\u221e f(s) ds . (6)\n3 Its codomain is the interval [0, 1]. Now the idea is to use a uniform random number Y \u2208 [0, 1] to select a point on the codomain of F . Then, via the inverse of the CDF, F\u22121 : [0, 1]\u2192 [\u03c3m, \u03c3M], one can map Y to the number\n\u03c3 = F\u22121(Y ) =\n( 1\n\u03c32 \u2212 2 A Y\n)\u22121/2 , (7)\nwhich follows the distribution f as desired. The empirical CDF, FN , associated with a sample of N diameter values, reads\nFN (\u03c3) = N \u22121 N\u2211 i=1 1(\u2212\u221e,\u03c3](\u03c3i). (8)\nSince for model S the diameters \u03c3i are independently and identically distributed according to the CDF F , the following relation holds for all \u03c3 \u2208 R,\nlim N\u2192\u221e\nFSN (\u03c3) almost surely = F (\u03c3) . (9)\nThis follows from the strong law of large numbers. Additive packing fraction. To a hard-sphere sample with particle diameters \u03c3i, i = 1, . . . , N , one can assign the additive hard-sphere packing fraction\n\u03c6hs = 1\nV N\u2211 i=1 \u03c0 6 \u03c33i . (10)\nFor model S, the value of \u03c6hs fluctuates among independent samples of size N around the expectation value\n\u03c6\u221ehs := E S [\u03c6hs] =\n\u03c0n\n6 A (\u03c3M \u2212 \u03c3m) \u2248 0.612 . (11)\nHere n = N/V is the number density and the expectation ES [ . ] is calculated with respect to the diameter distribution \u220fN i=1 f(\u03c3i) on the global diameter space. The variance of \u03c6hs can be written as\nVarS(\u03c6hs) = N \u22121 (\u03c0n\n6\n)2 VarS(\u03c33) , (12)\nwhere VarS(\u03c33) is the variance of \u03c33i for a single particle. The fluctuations VarS(\u03c6hs) \u221d N\u22121 vanish for N \u2192 \u221e. Beyond that, the disorder susceptibility\n\u03c7Sdis[\u03c6hs] = NVar S(\u03c6hs) = Const > 0 (13)\nis constant and finite for model S. In Sec. IV B, the disorder fluctuations for model S will be discussed and analyzed in more depth.\nNote that \u03c6hs is not an appropriate measure for a nonadditive polydisperse model that we use in our work. Therefore, later on, we will define an effective packing fraction \u03c6eff to account for non-additive particle interactions.\nModel D. For model D, we also use the CDF F to obtain the particle diameters \u03c3i, i = 1, . . . , N , but now we generate them in a deterministic manner. Our upcoming construction will satisfy the following three conditions:\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n\u03c3\n0\n1\n2\n3\nf\na) N = 500\nf model S model D\n0.5 1.0 1.5\n\u03c3\n0\n1\nF\n\u03c36\ns6 s7 = F \u22121(h7)\nh6\nh7\nb) N = 10\nF FDN\n4 3. Constraint: For a given one-particle property \u03b8(\u03c3) of the diameter, the following constraint is fulfilled:\n1\nN N\u2211 i=1 \u03b8(\u03c3i) = E S [ \u03b8 ]. (16)\nThis means that the empirical mean of the function \u03b8(\u03c3i) equals the corresponding expectation ES [ \u03b8(\u03c3i) ] in model S. To ensure this, \u03b8 is required to be a strictly monotonic function in \u03c3.\nFor our work, we use \u03b8(\u03c3) = \u03c06\u03c3 3, inspired by the additive hard-sphere packing fraction, cf. Eq. (10). Here, Eq. (16) ensures that \u03c6hs has the same value for any N ,\n\u03c6Dhs = E S [\u03c6hs] \u2261 \u03c6\u221ehs . (17)\nSo, how do we define the N diameters \u03c3i in the framework of model D? First, we introduce N + 1 equidistant nodes along the the codomain of F ,\nhi = i/N, i = 0, . . . , N. (18)\nTheir pre-images si are found on the domain of F ,\nsi = F \u22121(hi) . (19)\nWe then define particle diameters \u03c3i, i = 1, . . . , N , via\n\u03b8(\u03c3i) = N \u222b si si\u22121 \u03b8(\u03c3)f(\u03c3) d\u03c3 . (20)\nSince \u03b8 is assumed to be strictly monotonic, its inverse \u03b8\u22121 exists and \u03c3i is uniquely defined by Eq. (20). By summing over i the constraint Eq. (16) is fulfilled. The proof of the uniform convergence limN\u2192\u221e FDN = F is presented in Appendix A. Note the analytical nature of the convergence for model D in contrast to the stochastic one for model S, cf. Eq. (9).\nEquation (20) with the choice \u03b8(\u03c3) = \u03c06\u03c3 3 is a sensible constraint for an additive hard-sphere system. For our non-additive soft-sphere system it is a minor tweak and not an essential condition. Another reasonable choice would be \u03b8(\u03c3) = \u03c3, which ensures that the empirical mean of the diameters exactly equals the unit of length \u03c3\u0304. Alternatively, one could ignore the constraint Eq. (16) and thus also Eq. (20) entirely and define \u03c3i = si via Eq. (19) \u2013 note that one obtains N + 1 diameters in this case. The latter approach was used in Ref. [20]. We expect that all these options are equivalent in the limit N \u2192\u221e.\nFigure 1a illustrates the distribution of diameters for the models S and D. In each case, we show one histogram for N = 500 particles, in comparison to the distribution density f . For a meaningful comparison, we have chosen the same number of 70 bins for both histograms. Since model S is of stochastic nature, we show the histogram for a single realization of diameters. In contrast, for model D the histogram at a given N and bin number is uniquely defined (assuming an equidistant\nplacement of bins on [\u03c3m, \u03c3M]). The fluctuations around f for model S appear to be larger than for D. In the following paragraph \u201cOrder of convergence\u201d, we put this finding on an analytical basis.\nFigure 1b illustrates the construction of diameters \u03c3i for model D, based on the CDF F , for a small sample size N = 10. For the resulting diameters the empirical CDF FDN is shown.\nOrder of convergence. Having established the convergence limN\u2192\u221e FN = F for models S and D, we now compare their order of convergence. To this end, we calculate \u2206F , defined as the square-root of the mean squared deviation between FN and F ,\n\u2206F = (E[(FN \u2212 F )2])1/2 . (21)\nHere, E[ . ] refers to the expectation with respect to the global diameter distribution. For model D, the expectation E[ . ] is trivial and we obtain \u2206FD = |FDN \u2212 F |. As shown in the Appendices A and B, the results for model D and S are respectively\n\u2206FD \u2264 N\u22121 , (22) \u2206FS = ((F (1\u2212 F ))1/2N\u22121/2 . (23)\nThis means that the order of convergence for model D is at least 1, in contrast to model S where the order is only 1/2. In this aspect, model D is superior to model S, since its diameter distribution approaches the thermodynamic limit faster. Numerically, from the equations above, one has max\u03c3 \u2206F D \u2264 max\u03c3 \u2206FS already for N \u2265 4."

            "text": "Depending on the protocols introduced below, different particle-based simulation techniques are used, among which are molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the Swap Monte Carlo (SWAP) method, and the coupling of the system to a Lowe-Andersen thermostat (LA).\nIn the MD simulations, Newton\u2019s equations of motion are numerically integrated via the velocity form of the Verlet algorithm, using a time step of \u2206t = 0.01 t0 (with\nt0 = \u03c3\u0304 \u221a m/u0 setting the unit of time in the following). We employ the SWAP method in combination with MD simulation [24]. To this end, every 25 MD steps, N trial SWAP moves are performed. In a single SWAP move, a particle pair (i, j) is randomly selected, followed by the attempt to exchange their diameters (\u03c3i, \u03c3j) according to a Metropolis criterion. The probability PSWAP to accept a SWAP trial as a function of T is shown in Fig. 2. It indicates that even deep in the glassy state (far below the glass-transition temperature T SWAPg \u2248 0.06, which we will define later on), the acceptance rate for a SWAP move is still & 4% for T \u2265 0.01.

This means that only the component of the relative velocity parallel to r\u0302ij is thermalized, preserving the momentum as well as the angular momentum. We choose RT = xc and \u0393 = 4.\nBoth for model S and model D, we consider different system sizes N = 256, 500, 1000, 2048, 4000, and 8000 particles at different temperatures T , respectively. In each case, we prepare 60 independent configurations as follows: The initial positions are given by a face-centeredcubic lattice (with cavities in case that N 6= 4k3 for all integers k), while the initial velocities have a random orientation with a constant absolute value according to a high temperature T = 5. The total momentum is set to 0 by subtracting \u2211 i vi/N from the velocity of each particle. The initial crystal is melted for a simulation time tmax = 2000 with \u2206t = 0.001, applying both the SWAP Monte Carlo and the LA thermostat. Then we cool the sample to T = 0.3 for the same duration, followed by a run with \u2206t = 0.01 over the time tmax = 10\n5 to fully equilibrate the sample at the target temperature T . After that we switch off SWAP (to ensure that the mean energy remains constant in the following) and measure a time series H(tj) of the total energy over a time span of 0.75 tmax. Then we calculate the corresponding mean Hav and the standard deviation sd(H), and as soon as the condition |H(t)\u2212Hav| < 0.01 sd(H) is met, we switch off the LA thermostat and perform a microcanonical NV E simulation for the remaining time up to t = tmax. This procedure reduces fluctuations in the final temperature T for subsequent NV E production runs.\nFor the analysis that we present in the following, we mostly compare NV E with SWAP production runs (in both cases without the LA thermostat). Also, we perform MD production runs with the coupling to the LA thermostat but without applying the SWAP, and accordingly refer to these runs as the LA protocol. For all of\nthese production runs, the initial configurations are the final samples obtained from the equilibration protocol described above.\nFor the LA thermostat and the SWAP Monte Carlo, pseudorandom numbers are generated by the Mersenne Twister algorithm [26]. For each sample, a different seed is chosen to ensure independent sequences. For an observable we eventually determine its 95% confidence interval from its empirical CDF, which is calculated via Bootstrapping [27] with 1000 repetitions."

The normalization for \u03c7thm is chosen such that for an extensive observable O we expect finite values for limN\u2192\u221e \u03c7thm[O].\nAn important quantity that is related to the thermal susceptibility of the potential energy U is the excess specific heat at constant volume, defined by\nCV = 1\nN \u2202\u3008U\u3009 \u2202T . (28)\nIn the canonical NV T ensemble, the relation between CV and the thermal susceptibility \u03c7 NV T thm [U ] is\nCV = \u03c7 NV T thm [U ]/T 2 . (29)\nThis formula can be converted to the microcanonical NV E ensemble to obtain [28]\nCV = \u03c7NV Ethm [U ]\nT 2 \u2212 (2/3)\u03c7NV Ethm [U ] . (30)\nFigure 3 shows CV as a function of temperature T for the different dynamics, namely the microcanonical MD via Eq. (30), the MD with SWAP using Eqs. (28) and\n(29), and the MD with LA thermostat employing again Eq. (29).\nAt high temperatures, T & 0.11, the specific heat CV from the different calculations is in perfect agreement. Upon decreasing T , one observes relatively sharp drops in CV for the microcanonical NV E and the SWAP dynamics. The drops occur at the temperatures TNV Eg = 0.11 and T SWAPg = 0.06, respectively, and indicate the glass transition of the different dynamics. These estimates of the glass-transition temperatures Tg are consistent with those obtained from dynamic correlation functions presented in Sec. V.\nAnother conclusion that we can draw from Fig. 3 is that fluctuations in U , as quantified by the CV from the SWAP dynamics simulations, correctly reproduce those in the canonical NV T ensemble. This can be inferred from the coincidence of the blue and the red data points at temperatures T > T SWAPg . For the NV E dynamics at T < TNV Eg , albeit using fully equilibrated samples as initial configurations for T > T SWAPg , relaxation times become too large to correctly resolve the fluctuations, as quantified by \u03c7NV Ethm [U ]. We underestimate them within our finite simulation time and effectively measure a frequency-dependent specific heat [29]. Thus, from the monotonicity of Eq. (30), CV is underestimated as well. Furthermore, from the coincidence of the green with the orange data points, corresponding to the NVE and LA dynamics, respectively, we can conclude that the LA thermostat correctly reproduces the fluctuations in the canonical NV T ensemble.\nFor the NV E as well as LA dynamics, we see the Dulong-Petit law, i.e. for T \u2192 0 the specific heat approaches the value CV = 3/2. An exception to this finding are the results calculated from the SWAP dynamics. This can be understood by the fact that the SWAP dynamics are associated with fluctuating particle diameters even at very low temperatures; thus the resulting dynamics cannot be described in terms of the harmonic approximation for a frozen solid."

The disorder average of B, denoted by B, is the expectation value of B with respect to the distribution density g,\nB = E(B) = \u222b B(\u03c3)g(\u03c3) d\u03c3 . (32)\nNote that in our analysis below, disorder averages are calculated by an average over all samples, i.e. over 60 realizations of \u03c3.\nFluctuations of an extensive quantity B \u223c N and its corresponding \u201cdensity\u201d b = B/N can be measured by disorder susceptibilities, defined as\n\u03c7dis[B] = Var(B)/N = B2 \u2212B 2 /N , (33)\n\u03c7dis[b] = NVar(b). (34)\nThese two different definitions have to be applied for a meaningful scaling, i.e. to ensure \u03c7dis[B] = \u03c7dis[b]. For model D, we have \u03c7Ddis[B] = 0 for any B. In contrast, for model S the variable B(\u03c3) fluctuates from sample to sample as quantified by \u03c7dis[B]. Here, in general, limN\u2192\u221e \u03c7dis[B] 6= 0, as exemplified by the fluctuations of the additive packing fraction: In Sec. II, we showed VarS(\u03c6hs) \u221d 1/N , and thus we have \u03c7Sdis[\u03c6hs] = Const > 0.\nPotential energy. Having introduced the disorder average and susceptibility, we consider the variable B(\u03c3) = \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3), corresponding to the thermal average of the potential energy for a given sample with diameter configuration \u03c3.\nIn Figure 4a the dependence of \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3) on temperature T is shown. For a given model and system size N , we present 60 curves corresponding to 60 independent samples. For model S, results for N = 256 and 2048 are shown. Here, the diameter configurations \u03c3 vary among the samples and thus, the potential energy fans out into various curves \u3008U\u3009(T ). If we measure the fluctuations of the mean potential energy per particle, \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3)/N , with its variance, the fluctuations decrease with increasing N , as expected. For model D, we show the curves of 60 independent samples at N = 256; here, sample-to-sample fluctuations are completely absent and all data collapse onto a single curve.\nFigure 4b shows the disorder susceptibility \u03c7dis[\u3008U\u3009] of model S for different system sizes. As can be inferred from the figure, in a non-monotonous manner, \u03c7dis[\u3008U\u3009] seems to approach a finite temperature-dependent value in the limit N \u2192\u221e,\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n\u03c7Sdis[\u3008U\u3009] = Constant(T ) > 0 . (35)\nEffective packing fraction. Now, we show that the disorder fluctuations in the potential energy \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3) and the empirical limit value for \u03c7Sdis[\u3008U\u3009], as given by Eq. (35), can be explained by fluctuations in a single scalar variable, namely an effective packing fraction \u03c6eff . The additive packing fraction \u03c6hs, cf. Eq. (10), is not an appropriate measure of a packing fraction for the non-additive\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30\nT\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n\u3008U \u3009/ N\nS, N = 256 S, N = 2048 D, N = 256\nsoft-sphere system that we consider in this study. Therefore, we define an effective packing fraction \u03c6eff to take into account the non-additivity of our model system.\nThe idea is to assign to each particle i an \u201caverage\u201d volume Vi that accounts for the non-additive interactions. For this purpose, we first identify all |Ni| neighbors of i within a given cutoff rc,\nNi = { j \u2208 {1, . . . , N} | j 6= i, rij < rc} . (36)\nHere rc = 1.485 is chosen, which corresponds to the location of the first minimum of the radial distribution function at the temperature T = 0.3. Then, the volume Vi of particle i is defined as\nVi = 1 |Ni| \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c0 6 \u03c33ij , (37)\nwhere non-additive diameters \u03c3ij are given by Eq. (3).\n8 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3\nT\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8 1.0 \u3008\u03c6 e ff \u3009/ \u03c6 \u221e hs\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.770\n0.775\n0.780\nNote that different from the hard-sphere packing fraction \u03c6hs, the value of the effective packing fraction \u03c6eff of a given sample not only depends on the diameters \u03c3i, but it also depends on the coordinates ri. Thus, in our simulations of glassforming liquids, it is a thermally fluctuating variable. Therefore, we will use its thermal average \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 in our analysis below.\nAn alternative effective packing fraction can be defined by assigning an average diameter Si =\n1 |Ni| \u2211 j\u2208Ni \u03c3ij\ninstead of an average volume Vi to each particle. The corresponding packing fraction is given by\n\u03c6\u0303eff = V \u22121 N\u2211 i=1 \u03c0 6 S3i . (39)\nBelow, we use the effective packing fractions \u03c6eff and \u03c6\u0303eff to analyse the sample-to-sample fluctuations in model S. Although both definitions lead to similar results, we shall see that \u03c6eff seems to provide a slightly better characterization of the thermodynamic state of the system than \u03c6\u0303eff .\nFigure 5 displays the temperature dependence of \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009. It is almost constant over the whole considered temperature range. This is a plausible result when one considers the weak temperature dependence of the structure of glassforming liquids. As we can infer from the inset of this figure, \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 increases mildly from about 0.772 at T = 0.3 to about 0.779 at T = 0.01.\nNow, we will use the variable \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 to quantify the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the potential energy per particle \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3)/N .\n0.44 0.48 0.52\n\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n\u3008U \u3009/ N\nT = 0.10a)\nN = 256\nN = 500\nN = 2048\nN = 8000\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30\nT\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n1.00\nR 2\nb) N = 8000\nT SWAPg\n\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 \u3008\u03c6\u0303eff\u3009 \u03c6hs\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30\nT\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n1.00\nR 2\nc)\nN = 8000\nN = 2048\nN = 500\nN = 256\nFIG. 6: a) Scatter plot showing data points (\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3) , \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3)/N) for model S at T = 0.10 and different system sizes N . Each tuple belongs to a particular diameter realization \u03c3. The red line is obtained via a linear-regression model \u03c6 \u2192 \u3008U\u3009 with dependent variable \u3008U\u3009 and regressor \u03c6 = \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 for N = 2048. Its coefficient of determination is R2 \u2248 0.984. b) Coefficient of determination R2 of the linear regression model \u03c6 \u2192 \u3008U\u3009 as a function of T for N = 8000, using \u03c6 = \u03c6hs (red triangles), \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 (brown circles), and \u3008\u03c6\u0303eff\u3009 (orange crosses) as regressors \u03c6. c) Similar to b), but here R2 as a function of T is shown for regressor \u03c6 = \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 only, however for different system sizes N .\n9 In Fig. 6a, we show \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3)/N as a function of the mean packing fraction \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3) at the temperature T = 0.10. Here, we have used the data for N = 256, 500, and 2048 particles. The plot suggests that the fluctuations of \u3008U\u3009 can be explained by the variation of \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009. We elaborate this finding by calculating the coefficient of determination R2 of a linear-regression fit with dependent variable \u3008U\u3009/N and regressor \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009.\nIn Fig. 6b we show R2 as a function of T for the system size N = 8000. The linear regression analysis shows that approximately 99.5% of the fluctuations can be explained by \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009. This is a striking but physically plausible result, as it shows how a reduction from N degrees of freedom given by \u03c3 to one degree of freedom given by a thermodynamically relevant parameter \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 is sufficient to explain nearly all of the fluctuations. Also included in Fig. 6b is the coefficient of determination R2 using \u03c6 = \u03c6hs and \u3008\u03c6\u0303eff\u3009 as a regressor. While we obtain R2 \u2248 0.95 for \u03c6 = \u03c6hs, i.e. clearly below the value for \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009, the value of R2 for \u3008\u03c6\u0303eff\u3009 is only slightly smaller, R2 \u2248 0.99. Thus, among the three measures of the packing fraction, the variable \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 gives the best results. Note that the glass transition at T SWAPg \u2248 0.06 is associated with a small drop of R2 for the effective packing fractions.\nFigure 6c displays the temperature dependence of R2 for \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 for different system sizes N . The plot indicates a significant decrease of R2 with decreasing N , especially at low temperatures around the glass-transition temperature T SWAPg \u2248 0.06. The reason is that a linear relationship between \u3008U\u3009(\u03c3)/N and \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 is expected to only hold in the vicinity of the disorder-averaged value \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009. For small system sizes, however, relatively large nonlinear deviations from this value occur that are reflected in a lower value of the coefficient of determination R2. Moreover, for small N , the discretized nature of the diameter configuration does not any longer allow a description in terms of a single variable such as \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009.\nOur empirical results justify the idea to replace the dependency of \u3008U\u3009 on the diameter configuration \u03c3 by one on the single parameter \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009,\n\u3008U\u3009(\u03c3) \u2248 U\u2217 (\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3)) \u2248 U\u2217 ( \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 ) + \u2202U\u2217\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2223\u2223 \u03c6=\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009).\n(40)\nHere U\u2217 is an unknown function in a scalar variable. According to the Taylor expansion above, fluctuations in \u3008U\u3009 are inherited from those in \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 as\nVar(U\u2217) \u2248 ( \u2202U\u2217\n\u2202\u03c6\n)2 \u2223\u2223 \u03c6=\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009Var(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009) . (41)\nSince \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 should scale similarly to the additive hardsphere packing fraction \u03c6hs, we have Var(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009) \u221d 1/N . Then, since U\u2217 is extensive, Eq. (35) is confirmed."

            "text": "In this section, the dynamic properties of the models S and D are compared. To this end, we analyze a timedependent overlap function that measures the structural relaxation of the particles on a microscopic length scale. The timescale on which this function decays varies from sample to sample; these fluctuations around the average dynamics can be quantified in terms of a dynamic susceptibility. We shall see that the susceptibility in model S can be split into two terms. While the first term is due to thermal fluctuations and also present in model D, the second term is due to the disorder in \u03c3. At low temperatures, the contribution from the disorder can be the dominant term in the susceptibility.\nFor our analysis, we consider MD simulations in the microcanonical ensemble as well as hybrid simulations, combining MD with the Swap Monte Carlo technique (see Sec. III). In the following, we refer to these dynamics as \u201cNV E\u201d and \u201cSWAP\u201d, respectively.\nGlassy dynamics. A peculiar feature of the structural relaxation of glassforming liquids is the cage effect. On intermediate timescales, each particle gets trapped in a cage that is formed by its neighboring particles. To analyze structural relaxation from the cages, we therefore have to look at density fluctuations on a length scale a similar to the size of the fluctuations of a particle inside such a cage. On a single-particle level, a simple timedependent correlation function that measures the relaxation is the self part of the overlap function, defined by\nQ(t) = 1\nN N\u2211 i=1 \u0398(a\u2212 |ri(t)\u2212 ri(0)|) . (42)\nHere, we choose a = 0.3 for the microscopic length scale. The behavior of Q(t) is similar to that of the incoherent intermediate scattering function at a wave-number corresponding to the location of the first-sharp diffraction peak in the static structure factor. We note that we have not introduced any averaging in the definition (42). In the following, we will display the decay of Q(t) for 60 individual samples at different temperatures. The corresponding initial configurations at t = 0 were fully equilibrated with the aid of the SWAP dynamics before, as explained in Sec. III.\nFigure 7 shows the overlap function Q(t) for model S and model D, in both cases for the NV E and the SWAP dynamics. In all cases, we can see the typical signatures of glassy dynamics. At a high temperature, T = 0.3, the function Q(t) exhibits a monotonous decay to zero on a short microscopic timescale. Upon decreasing the temperature first a shoulder and then a plateau-like region emerges on intermediate timescales. This plateau extends over an increasing timescale with decreasing temperature and indicates the cage effect. Particles are essentially trapped within the same microstate in which they were initially at t = 0. At the high temperature T = 0.3 the decay of Q(t) is very similar for NV E and\n10\nSWAP dynamics. Towards low temperatures, however, the decay is much faster in the case of the SWAP dynamics, as expected. A striking result is that at lower temperatures, the individual curves in model S show much larger variation than those in model D. In the following, these sample-to-sample fluctuations shall be quantified in terms of a dynamic susceptibility.\nRelaxation time \u03c4 . From the expectation of the overlap function, E[Q](t) (black dashed lines in Fig. 7), we extract an alpha-relaxation time \u03c4 , defined by E[Q](\u03c4) = 1/e. In Fig. 8, the logarithm of the timescale \u03c4 as a function of inverse temperature 1/T is shown. Also included in this plot are the times t\u2217 where the fluctuations of Q(t) are maximal, which will be discussed in the following paragraph \u201cDynamic susceptibility\u201d. One observes an increase of \u03c4 by about five orders of magnitude upon decreasing T . This increase is much quicker for the NV E than for the SWAP dynamics, reflecting the fact that T SWAPg is much lower than T NV E g (cf. Fig. 3). The glasstransition temperatures defined in Sec. IV via the drop in the specific heat CV (T ) are approximately consistent with the alternative definition via \u03c4(Tg) = 10 5.\n11\nDynamic susceptibility \u03c7(t). A characteristic feature of glassy dynamics is the presence of dynamical heterogeneities that are associated with large fluctuations around the \u201caverage\u201d dynamics. These fluctuations can be quantified in terms of a dynamic (or four-point) susceptibility. For the overlap function Q(t), this susceptibility \u03c7(t) can be defined as\n\u03c7(t) = NVar (Q(t)) . (43)\nThe function \u03c7(t) measures the fluctuations of Q(t) around the average E[Q](t). In practice, we use the data of Q(t) from the ensemble of 60 independent samples.\nFigure 9 shows the dynamic susceptibility \u03c7(t) for the same cases as for Q(t) in Fig. 7. As a common feature of glassy dynamics [30, 31], \u03c7(t) exhibits a peak \u03c7\u2217 := maxt \u03c7(t) at t = t\u2217. The timescale t\u2217 is roughly equal to the alpha-relaxation time \u03c4 , see Fig. 8. At the temperatures T = 0.1 for the NV E and T = 0.06 for the SWAP dynamics, \u03c7\u2217 is more than one order of magnitude larger for model S than for model D. This indicates that the disorder in \u03c3 of model S strongly affects the sample-to-sample fluctuations. In the following paragraph \u201cVariance decomposition\u201d we will present how one can distinguish disorder from thermal fluctuations.\nFigure 10 shows the maximum of the dynamic susceptibility, \u03c7\u2217, as a function of inverse temperature, 1/T , for NV E and SWAP dynamics. In both cases, the results for model S (\u03c7\u2217S) and model D (\u03c7\u2217D) are included, considering systems with N = 8000 particles. In all cases \u03c7\u2217 increases with decreasing temperature T , as expected for glassy dynamics. For both types of dynamics the difference \u2206\u03c7\u2217 = \u03c7\u2217S \u2212 \u03c7\u2217D increases with decreasing temperature as well. The lowest temperatures for which we can calculate \u2206\u03c7\u2217 are (i) T = 0.09 with a relative deviation \u2206\u03c7\u2217/\u03c7\u2217D \u2248 18 for the NV E and (ii) T = 0.065 with \u2206\u03c7\u2217/\u03c7\u2217D \u2248 23 for the SWAP dynamics.\nVariance decomposition. To understand the difference \u2206\u03c7\u2217 between \u03c7S and \u03c7D, we will decompose the dynamic susceptibility \u03c7S of model S into one term that stems from the thermal fluctuations of the phase-space variables, and a second term that is caused by the sampleto-sample variation of the diameters \u03c3.\nAs a matter of fact, in model S the overlap function Q(t) and similar correlation functions depend on two random vectors, namely the initial phase-space point q0 = (r(0), v(0)) and the diameters \u03c3. As a consequence, we define and calculate \u03c7 = NVar(Q) on a probability\n12\nspace with respect to the joint-probability density\n\u03c1(q0, \u03c3) = \u03c1(q0|\u03c3)g(\u03c3). (44) Here \u03c1(q0|\u03c3) is the conditional phase-space density introduced in Eq. (26) and g(\u03c3) is the diameter distribution defined by Eq. (31).\nNow, since Q depends on two random vectors q0 and \u03c3, we can decompose \u03c7 = NVar(Q) according to the variance decomposition formula, also called law of total variance or Eve\u2019s law [32]:\nVar(Q) = E [Var(Q|\u03c3)] + Var (E[Q|\u03c3]) (45)\n\u2261 \u3008Q2 \u2212 \u3008Q\u30092\u3009+ \u3008Q\u30092 \u2212 \u3008Q\u30092 . (46)\nHere, E [Var(Q|\u03c3)] describes intrinsic thermal fluctuations, while the term Var (E[Q|\u03c3]) expresses fluctuations induced by the disorder in \u03c3.\nThe first summand in Eq. (45) is expected to coincide for both models S and D for sufficiently large N , as Var(Q|\u03c3) describes intrinsic thermal fluctuations for a given realization of \u03c3, which are calculated via the model-independent conditional phase-space density \u03c1(q0|\u03c3). The physical observable Var(Q|\u03c3) should not depend on microscopic details of the diameter configuration \u03c3 for sufficiently large N . For the cumulative distribution functions of the diameters, the consistency equation limN\u2192\u221e FSN (s) = F (s) = limN\u2192\u221e F D N (s) holds. Thus, we expect that ES [Var(Q|\u03c3)] \u2248 ED [Var(Q|\u03c3)]. This equation should be exact in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. We have implicitly used this line of argument also in Sec. IV, where we have only shown numerical results of the specific heat for model D. Furthermore, for model D we have exactly ED[Var(Q|\u03c3)] = Var(Q|\u03c3D) = VarD(Q), since here there is only one diameter configuration \u03c3 = \u03c3D for a given system size N .\nSummarizing the results above, we can express the dynamic susceptibility for model S as follows:\nVarS(Q) = VarD(Q) + VarS (E[Q|\u03c3]) . (47)\nNow the aim is to estimate the second summand in Eq. (47). We assume that we can describe the disorder in \u03c3 by a single parameter, namely the thermally averaged effective packing fraction \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3), defined by Eq. (38). This idea has been already proven successful in Sec. IV, when we described the disorder fluctuations of the potential energy. Similarly, we write\nE[Q|\u03c3] \u2261 \u3008Q\u3009(\u03c3) \u2248 Q\u2217(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3)) , (48)\nassuming that the values of \u3008Q\u3009(\u03c3), which depend on N degrees of freedom, can be described by a function Q\u2217 that only depends on a scalar argument, the scalar-valued function \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3). The function Q\u2217 is unknown, but can be estimated numerically with a linear-regression analysis, predicting \u3008Q\u3009 with the regressor \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009. Insertion of Eq. (48) into Eq. (47) gives\nVarS(Q) \u2248 VarD(Q) + VarS(Q\u2217(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009)) . (49)\nWe can write this equation in terms of susceptibilities,\n\u03c7S \u2248 \u03c7D + \u03c7\u03c6, (50) \u03c7\u03c6 := NVar S(Q\u2217(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009)). (51)\nAlong the lines of Eq. (41) in Sec. IV, we can expand the overlap function Q\u2217 around \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 to obtain\nVarS(Q\u2217(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009) \u2248 VarS(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009) ( \u2202Q\u2217(\u03c6) \u2202\u03c6 \u2223\u2223 \u03c6=\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009 )2 .\n(52)\nSince VarS(\u3008\u03c6eff\u3009) \u223c VarS(\u03c6hs) \u221d N\u22121 and Q\u2217 \u223c Q \u2208 O(1), this equation implies that the susceptibility \u03c7\u03c6, to\n13\nleading order, does not depend on N . Moreover, for a given temperature T and time t, it approaches a constant value in the thermodynamic limit, N \u2192 \u221e. For small system sizes, however, higher-order corrections to Eq. (52) cannot be neglected. Beyond that, the discretized nature of the system at small N will lead to a failure of the \u201ccontinuity-assumption\u201d (48) itself. Finitesize effects of \u03c7 will be analyzed in the following paragraph.\nIn Fig. 10, we show for the system with N = 8000 particles that \u03c7\u2217\u03c6, i.e. \u03c7\u03c6 evaluated at t = t\n\u2217, indeed captures the sample-to-sample fluctuations in model S due to the disorder in \u03c3. Both for NV E and SWAP dynamics, it quantitatively describes the gap between \u03c7\u2217S and \u03c7\u2217D.\nFinite-size effects: Popoviciou\u2019s inequality on variances. Here, we analyze finite-size effects of the dynamic susceptibility \u03c7. To this end, we again consider the temperature dependence of the maximum of the dynamic susceptibility, \u03c7\u2217, considering only the case of the NV E dynamics. Note that for model D finite-size effects in the considered temperature range 0.09 \u2264 T \u2264 0.3 are negligible; therefore we only discuss model S in the following.\nFigure 11 shows \u03c7\u2217S as a function of 1/T for N = 256, 500, and 8000. At high temperatures T , where fluctuations are small, there is hardly, if any, dependency on the system size N . However, upon lowering T a saturation occurs at least for the small systems. This behavior can be understood by a hard stochastic upper limit on fluctuations, which is given by Popoviciou\u2019s inequality on variances [33]. This inequality is valid for any bounded real-valued random variable X: Let c and C be the lower and upper bound of X, respectively, then\nPopoviciou states that Var(X) \u2264 (C2 \u2212 c2)/4. Applying this result to X = Q with sharp boundaries c = 0 and C = 1 yields\n\u03c7 \u2261 NVar(Q) \u2264 N/4. (53)\nOur data shows that this upper bound is quite sharp for N = 256 and N = 500 at low T . This can be understood by the fact that the equality of the inequality (53) holds precisely when Q is a Bernoulli variable, i.e. when there are exactly two outcomes Q = 0 or Q = 1 each with probability 1/2. In this sense, the saturation of \u03c7 should occur at temperatures T and system sizes N at a given t when Q(t) for approximately half of the samples has decayed close to 0 while for the other half Q is still close to 1.\nThe inequality (53) is very useful to estimate how large a system size N needs to be to avoid this kind of finitesize effect: All one has to do is to compare the measured \u03c7 at a given N to the number \u03c7c := N/4. In the case that \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c7c, one has to consider larger system sizes N ."

            "text": "In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation in combination with the SWAP Monte Carlo technique to study a polydisperse model glassformer that has recently been introduced by Ninarello et al. [14]. Two methods are used to choose the particle diameters \u03c31, . . . , \u03c3N to obtain samples with N particles. Both of these approximate the desired distribution density f(\u03c3) \u223c \u03c3\u22123 with their histogram. In model S the diameters are drawn from f(\u03c3) in a stochastic manner. In model D the diameters are obtained via a deterministic scheme that assigns an appropriate set of N values to them. We systematically compare the properties of model S to those of model D and investigate how the sample-to-sample variation of the diameters in model S affects various quantities: (i) classical phase-space functions such as the potential energy U and its fluctuations, and (ii) dynamic correlation functions such as the overlap function Q(t) and its fluctuations as well.\nObviously, model D has the advantage that always \u201cthe most representative sample\u201d [20] is used for any system size N , while model S may suffer from statistical outliers, especially in the case of small N . This indicates that the quenched disorder introduced by the different diameter configurations in model S may strongly affect fluctuations that we investigate systematically in this work.\nOur main findings can be summarized as follows: The sample-to-sample fluctuations in model S can be described in terms of a single scalar parameter, namely the effective packing fraction \u3008\u03c6eff\u3009(\u03c3), defined by Eq. (38). In terms of this parameter, one can explain the disorder fluctuations of the potential energy (cf. Fig. 6) as well as the gap between the dynamic susceptibilities of models\n14\nS and D (cf. Fig. 10). The sample-to-sample fluctuations of the potential energy in model S can be quantified in terms of the disorder susceptibility \u03c7Sdis which is a non-trivial function of temperature (cf. Fig. 4) and finite in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. In model S, at very low temperatures, the dynamic susceptibility is dominated by the fluctuations due to the diameter disorder. Thus, if one is aiming at analyzing the \u201ctrue\u201d dynamic heterogeneities of a glassformer, that stem from the intrinsic thermal fluctuations, one may preferentially use model D. Note that it is possible to calculate the same thermal susceptibility in model S as in model D, however the calculation in S is more difficult, as it demands an additional average over the disorder, as shown in Sec. V. This implies that model S requires more sampling in this case.\nOur findings are of particular importance regarding recent simulation studies of polydisperse glassforming systems in external fields [15, 17, 23, 34, 35] where a model S approach was used to select the particle diameters. However, in these works sample-to-sample fluctuations due to the disorder in \u03c3 have been widely ignored. Exceptions are the studies by Lerner et al. [34, 35] where samples whose energy deviates from the mean energy by more than 0.5% were just discarded. Here the use of a model D scheme would be a more efficient alternative. However, one should still keep in mind that with regard to a realistic description of experiments on polydisperse colloidal systems, it might be more appropriate to choose model S.\nAppendix A: Convergence of the CDF FDN\nHere, we prove that the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) FDN of model D, see Eqs. (8) and (20), converges uniformly to the exact CDF F , defined by Eq. (6). As we shall see below, the order of convergence is at least 1. For the strictly monotonic function \u03b8, that we have introduced in Sec. II, we assume that it is strictly increasing, but the proof is analogous for a strictly decreasing \u03b8.\nIn the first step, we show that\n\u03c3i \u2208 [si\u22121, si], i = 1, . . . , N. (A1) Starting point is Eq. (20) from which we estimate\n\u03b8(\u03c3i) \u2264 N \u222b si si\u22121 \u03b8(si)f(\u03c3) d\u03c3 (A2)\n= N\u03b8(si) \u222b si si\u22121 f(\u03c3) d\u03c3 (A3) = N\u03b8(si)[F (si)\u2212 F (si\u22121)] (A4)\n= N\u03b8(si)\n[ i\nN \u2212 i\u2212 1 N\n] = \u03b8(si). (A5)\nSince \u03b8 is strictly increasing, its inverse \u03b8\u22121 exists and is strictly increasing, too. Applying \u03b8\u22121 to the inequality above yields \u03c3i \u2264 si. Similarly, we obtain \u03c3i \u2265 si\u22121. This confirms Eq. (A1).\nIn the second step, we consider an arbitrary > 0 and natural numbers N \u2265 N0 with N0 = d \u22121e. Now we select \u03c3 \u2208 R. For \u03c3 < \u03c3m or \u03c3 > \u03c3M, we trivially have FDN (\u03c3) = F (\u03c3). In the remaining case \u03c3m \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c3M, an index i exists such that si\u22121 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 si. The latter statement is true, because the union of all intervals [si\u22121, si] yields the total interval [\u03c3m, \u03c3M]. From Eq. (A1) it follows that there are exactly i or i \u2212 1 particles with \u03c3i \u2264 \u03c3, so that FDN (\u03c3) = i/N or FDN (\u03c3) = (i \u2212 1)/N , respectively.\nIn the third step, we point out that F (\u03c3) is a monotonously increasing function so that\ni\u2212 1 N = F (si\u22121) \u2264 F (\u03c3) \u2264 F (si) = i N . (A6)\nSubtracting FDN (\u03c3) yields\n|FDN (\u03c3)\u2212 F (\u03c3)| \u2264 1/N \u2264 1/N0 < . (A7)\nThis proves the uniform convergence\nlim N\u2192\u221e\nFDN = F (A8)\nof the order of convergence of at least 1.\nAppendix B: Convergence of the CDF FSN\nTo find the order of convergence for limN\u2192\u221e FSN = F of model S, we measure deviations by \u2206F = (ES [(FSN \u2212 F )2])1/2, see Eq. (21). We first calculate\n(FSN \u2212 F )2 = 1\nN2 N\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 j=1 (1i \u2212 F )(1j \u2212 F ), (B1)\n1i(\u03c3) := 1(\u2212\u221e,\u03c3](\u03c3i). (B2)\nHere, we abbreviated the full notation of the indicator function 1. Its expectation is given by\nES [1i(\u03c3)] = 1P (\u03c3i \u2264 \u03c3) + 0P (\u03c3i > \u03c3) = F (\u03c3). (B3)\nHere, P denotes the appropriate probability for model S. When calculating the expectation ES of Eq. (B1), only the diagonal terms i = j remain due to the stochastic independence of the diameters \u03c3i and \u03c3j for i 6= j. We end up with\nES [(FSN \u2212 F )2] = F (1\u2212 F )N\u22121, (B4) \u21d2 \u2206FS = ((F (1\u2212 F ))1/2 N\u22121/2. (B5)\nThis means the order of convergence for model S is only 1/2. Concerning the prefactor, we have max\u03c3 F (1\u2212F ) = 1/4 at the \u03c3 where F (\u03c3) = 1/2. Thus it is\nmax \u03c3\n\u2206FS = 1 2 N\u22121/2. (B6)\nNote that no inequality is used in the calculations above and thus the order of convergence is sharp.\n15\n[1] U. Gasser, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 21, 203101 (2009).
