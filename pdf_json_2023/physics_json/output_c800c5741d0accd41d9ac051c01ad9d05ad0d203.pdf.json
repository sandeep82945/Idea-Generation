    "abstractText": "Due to the risk of heavy metal pollution in infant milk powder, it is significant to establish effective detection methods. Here, a screen-printed electrode (SPE) was modified with nanoporous carbon (NPC) to detect Pb(II) and Cd(II) in infant milk powder using an electrochemical method. Using NPC as a functional nanolayer facilitated the electrochemical detection of Pb(II) and Cd(II) due to its efficient mass transport and large adsorption capacity. Linear responses were obtained for Pb (II) and Cd(II) in the range from 1 to 60 \u03bcg L\u22121 and 5 to 70 \u03bcg L\u22121, respectively. The limit of detection was 0.1 \u03bcg L\u22121 for Pb(II) and 1.67 \u03bcg L\u22121 for Cd(II). The reproducibility, stability, and anti-interference performance of the prepared sensor were tested as well. The heavy metal ion detection performance in the extracted infant milk powder shows that the developed SPE/NPC possesses the ability to detect Pb(II) and Cd(II) in milk powder.",

            "text": "Nowadays, man-made and natural disasters, including the universal application of pesticides and fertilizers, mining, smelting, fossil fuel burning, forest fires, and volcanic eruptions [1], have led to serious heavy metal contamination with the development of industry and agriculture. Heavy metal ions (HMIs) have been exposed to food, plant, soil, natural water, and many other sources. With the transmission of the food chain, heavy metal pollution eventually enters the human body, which is harmful to body health. Some studies have shown that the toxicity of HMIs can lead to serious diseases, such as encephalopathy, cardiovascular disease, organ failure, neurogenic disease, and cancer [2]. Recently, research has shown that the exposure of cows to the contaminated environment around steel processing units or thermal power areas can increase the concentration of HMIs in milk [3]. Milk, an important food of animal origin, has most of the nutrients necessary for a healthy diet, especially for children [4]. Rich nutrients in milk powder, such as vitamins and mineral substances, are essential for a baby\u2019s development [5]. Except for the necessary mineral elements, ions in milk products, such as Pb(II), Cd(II), and other HMIs, can lead to toxic effects on babies even at low concentrations. Moreover, several reports have demonstrated the intake of HMIs by infants through milk powder [6,7], which may bring serious consequences to infant health. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods to quantify HMIs in infant milk powders. Compared with conventional methods for the detection of HMIs, electrochemical techniques that take advantage of the portable, rapid, low-priced, and inherent electrochemical activity of HMIs [2] provide a better alternative for their detection. The comparison of HMI detection with electrochemical methods and other widely used techniques is shown in Table S1 [8\u201322]. The screen-printed electrode (SPE) has received wide attention for its intrinsic properties, such as small size, light weight, ease of mass production, and low\nFoods 2023, 12, 730. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12040730 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 730 2 of 12\ncost [23], which makes it suitable for on-site rapid detection compared with the traditional glassy carbon electrode. However, the non-conductive substances in the carbon inks could lead to poor electrochemical performance [2]. Thus, various nanomaterials were used on SPEs to improve the electrochemical properties. The application of nanomaterials in electrochemical sensing has received extensive concern due to their specific chemical, physical, and electronic properties, including the large specific surface area, quick mass-transport rate, and ability to speed up electron transfer [24]. Many studies have shown that electrodes modified with nanomaterials, such as metallic nanomaterials [25], carbon nanomaterials [26], silicon nanomaterials [27], and biological nanomaterials [28], can effectively enhance the electrochemical detection performance towards HMIs. Among these nanomaterials, carbon nanomaterials have attracted great interest in HMI detection due to the excellent properties of low-cost and large specific surface areas. Nanoporous carbon (NPC), as a new type of carbon nanomaterial, has been applied widely in the field of electrochemical sensing. Notable merits of low density, excellent thermal and chemical stability, hierarchical porosity, efficient mass transport, and large adsorption capacity [29,30] make NPC exhibit satisfactory properties in adsorption, catalyst, and energy-storage applications [29,31,32]. Most importantly, few reports have explored the performance of NPC in the field of electrochemical detection of HMIs. In this study, the electrochemical performance of NPC in the detection of HMIs (Pb(II) and Cd(II)) was investigated. A screen-printed electrode (SPE) was applied as the sensing substrate, and NPC was used as the modification layer and applied to facilitate the electrochemical detection of the HMIs by promoting the concentration process. Metal ions, such as bismuth, platinum, gold, and mercury, are preferred for the detection of HMIs because these ions have the ability to form an alloy with HMIs for a higher detection sensitivity [33]. Bismuth is widely used due its merits of being environmental-friendly and low-cost [34]; thus, Bi(III) was applied in this work to provide a simple way to enhance the reduction of HMIs by forming a Bi(III)-based alloy film. The material characterization of the NPC and electrochemical performance of the SPE/NPC were investigated. The relevant HMI detection parameters were optimized, and the critical properties for real applications, including the reproducibility, stability, and anti-interference performance, were also evaluated. The results demonstrated that the developed SPE/NPC possesses satisfactory abilities for the detection of HMIs. To further confirm this point, the prepared SPE/NPC was applied in the monitoring of HMI contamination in infant milk powder."

The above results demonstrate that the SPE/NPC can measure Pb(II) and Cd(II) with improved conductivity without autointerference peaks within the required voltage range. The electron transfer processes of the bare SPE and SPE/NPC were also compared by their CV curves in the K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] solution. As illustrated in Figure 2A, a pair of reversible peaks can be found in the curves of the bare SPE and SPE/NPC. Notably, the peak potential separation of the bare SPE is 0.456 V, while the one after modifying with NPC reduces it to 0.152 V, and the peak current value also increases from 8.423 \u00b5A to 12.320 \u00b5A. It can be concluded that the NPC can effectively promote the process of electron transport on the surface of the SPE. To further confirm this conclusion, we calculated the electro-active surface area of the electrode based on the CV curves.

Based on this, the electro-active surface area of the bare SPE is calculated as 0.038 cm2, while that of the SPE/NPC is calculated as 0.056 cm2. The surface area of the modified electrode is approximately 1.5-times higher than the bare electrode. Then, the HMI detection performance of the SPE and SPE/NPC was compared with the ASSWV method, and the corresponding stripping curves are shown in Figure 2B.

As th results illustrate in Figure S4, the peak current increases wit the deposited volume of the NPC suspension; a maximum peak current is achi ved in the electrode deposited with 6 \u00b5L of the NPC uspension. Subsequently, the d tection response of the SPE/NPC exhibits a decreasing trend as the deposition volume is further increased; this can be explained by the decreased conductivity and stability of the NPC layer on the SPE surface with an excessive thickness. Therefore, 6 \u00b5L of the NPC suspension is selected as the optimized deposition volume. The thickness of the Bi-based alloy film is controlled by the concentration of the added Bi(III) solution; Bi(III) solutions with various concentrations that varied from 0.65 to 0.98 mg L\u22121 were evaluated for the detection of HMIs (Figure 3B). As the concentration of Bi(III) increases, the overall trend of the stripping current first increases and then decreases; the peak current appears at a Bi(III) concentration of 0.81 mg L\u22121. The electrochemical deposition process of HMIs can be promoted effectively through the formation of a Bi-based alloy; however, the mass transfer of the metallic deposition process might be hindered by a thick Bi film formed under a high concentration of Bi(III) [40]. Thus, a Bi(III) solution with a concentration of 0.81 mg L\u22121 is adopted for the stripping analysis of the HMIs. The deposition parameters, including the deposition potential and deposition time, are also critical for the detection of HMIs. Figure 3C,D show the influences of the deposition parameters. As for the optimization of the deposition potential from \u22120.8 V to \u22121.0 V (Figure 3C), Pb(II) and Cd(II) were barely detected with the potential of \u22120.8 V; the signal begins to strengthen with an increase of deposition potential. While the deposition potential exceeds \u22121.0 V, the current responses begin to decrease due to the reduction in interfering\nFoods 2023, 12, 730 7 of 12\nsubstances in the solution under high potential. From the results exhibited in Figure 3D, the current response has an obvious increasing trend as the deposition time prolongs, and then, it gradually approaches a flat after 150 s of deposition, which can be explained as the HMIs deposited on the electrode have reached saturation. Accordingly, a depositing time of 150 s at a deposition voltage of \u22121.0 V was applied in the end."

The use of a SPE provides a portable, disposable, and efficient platform for the electrochemical determination. Notably, the unique merits of the graphite carbon phase and porous structures of NPC effectively promote the mass transfer on the sensing surface. Its surface morphology exhibits a porous structure, which provides abundant active sites for the \u201cin situ\u201d electro-deposition of Bi(III) and the following reduction in HMIs. Under optimal conditions, the SPE/NPC sensor offered a linear response ranging from 1 to 60 \u00b5g L\u22121 and 5 to 70 \u00b5g L\u22121, and satisfactory LOD of 0.1 \u00b5g L\u22121 and 1.67 \u00b5g L\u22121 for Pb(II) and Cd(II), respectively. After a long-term operation, no obvious change in the stripping responses of the HMIs was observed. For the selectivity evaluation, acceptable changes in the peak current compared with the responses of Pb(II) and Cd(II) were observed after the addition of interferences. Though excellent stability and anti-interference performance were achieved, the reproducibility still needs to be further improved. It is worth noting that there is a certain difference in the standard curves when the two ions are detected simultaneously and separately. The higher sensitivity of single heavy metal ions may imply the competition relationship between the two different ions. The interaction mechanism between the two different ions in this process needs to be further investigated. The average recovery ratio of 115.32% for Pb(II) and 86.78% for Cd(II) was realized in the real application in infant milk powder. Given the excellent electrochemical performance and simple fabrication process, the SPE/NPC developed in our work provides a promising method for the detection of HMIs in milk powder samples.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12040730/s1, Figure S1: (A) N2 adsorption\u2212desorption isotherms, (B) pore-size distribution of NPC; Figure S2: Nyquist spectra obtained with bare SPE and SPE/NPC; Figure S3: Cyclic voltammogram of bare SPE and SPE/NPC in acetate buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 4.5); Figure S4: Effects of deposition volume of NPC solution on the stripping responses of SPE/NPC in the detection of Pb(II) and Cd(II) (30 \u00b5g L\u22121); Figure S5: Stripping voltammograms of SPE/NPC for single variable of (A) Pb(II) and (B) Cd(II) with various concentrations in acetic acid buffer solution with 0.81 mg L\u22121 Bi(III), and the calibration plots of (C) Pb(II) and (D) Cd(II); Figure S6: Effects of interfering substances on the stripping performance of SPE/NPC; Figure S7: Stripping voltammograms of SPE/NPC in five infant milk powder samples before and after the addition of 30 \u00b5g L\u22121 Pb(II) and Cd(II).
