    "abstractText": "Many diseases in the human body are related to the level of L-cysteine. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an efficient, simple and sensitive platform for L-cysteine detection. In this work, we synthesized platinum palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs) using vancomycin hydrochloride (Van) as a stabilizer, which exhibited high oxidase-like catalytic activity. In addition, the catalytic kinetics of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs followed the typical Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, exhibiting a strong affinity for 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrates. More importantly, we developed a simple and effective strategy for the sensitive colorimetric detection of L-cysteine using biocompatible Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. The detection limit was low, at 0.07 \u03bcM, which was lower than the values for many previously reported enzyme-like detection systems. The colorimetric method of the L-cysteine assay had good selectivity. The established method for the detection of L-cysteine showed promise for biomedical analysis.",

            "text": "L-cysteine is one of the sulfur-containing \u03b1-amino acids with good water solubility. Meanwhile, L-cysteine is involved in the reduction process of cells and phospholipid metabolism in the liver. The intracellular concentration of L-cysteine is usually around 30\u2013200 \u00b5M [1]. High or low levels of L-cysteine in the body can cause diseases [2]. Therefore, it is important to establish an efficient, reliable and sensitive L-cysteine assay platform with which to detect its concentration. Currently, many methods have been reported for the detection of L-cysteine, including electrochemical methods, high-performance liquid chromatography, spin photometric methods, fluorescence detection and colorimetric detection [3\u20136]. However, many detection methods are limited in terms of their wide application by their cost, detection time, toxicity and environmental hazards.\nIn recent years, colorimetric detection has been considered as a promising method for the detection of L-cysteine due to its simplicity of operation and good visualization [7]. Many natural enzymes have been widely used in colorimetric assays. For example, Huang et al. [8] used the peroxidase activity of fig protease for the colorimetric assay\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13081254 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254 2 of 17\nof L-cysteine. The application of natural enzymes was limited due to shortcomings such as their complex extraction process, fallibility and cost.\nMore recently, artificial enzymes with enzyme-like activities have been developed. Since the first study of Fe3O4 nanomaterials for peroxidase-like activity in 2007 [9], nanozyme-based colorimetric sensing platforms have contributed to the rapid development of the diagnostic and bioanalytical fields. A variety of nanozymes including noble metals [10], metal oxides [11,12], carbon-based materials [13,14] and other nanomaterials [15\u201318] have been reported. Pandey et al. [19] reported the structural characterization of noble metal monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic nanoparticles, in addition to evaluating their biocatalytic activity for the non-enzymatic sensing of glucose. In particular, artificial nanozymes composed of noble metal nanoparticles have a wide range of applications due to their high interfacial stability, easy preparation and modification [20], as in the case of Pt nanotubes [21], gold nanoparticles [22] and Pd nanoparticles. Compared with monometallic nanoparticles, bimetallic nanoparticles with synergistic effects have received widespread attention because of their higher catalytic activity [23,24]. Jang et al. [25] reported a TiO2-loaded Pt-Pd bimetallic model catalyst. Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the d electrons of Pt-Pd bimetallic nanoparticles were transferred from Pt 5d to Pd 4d upon alloying and the orbital hybridization and electronic state broadening of Pt and Pd. This led to a significant improvement in the catalytic performance of the bimetallic Pt-Pd catalyst. The metals Pt and Pd are both face-centered, cubic-structured metals with similar lattice constants; thus, they are more likely to form a homogeneous alloy. When Pt and Pd form an alloy, the coupling between the metals can improve their catalytic performance. Jin et al. [26] reported a Pd-Pt bimetallic alloy nanowire that exhibited excellent oxidase activity in an acidic environment.\nDespite their small size, noble metal nanoparticles have a large specific surface area and high catalytic activity. But they tend to aggregate easily in solutions, leading to reduced activity. Therefore, the introduction of various carriers to stabilize small nanoparticles is considered one of the most effective ways to improve the catalytic activity and stability of enzyme mimics [27]. Among the nanoparticles, the carriers usually serve as a backbone to widely disperse and stabilize the active components, such as inorganic mesoporous silica [28], polymeric carriers [29] and polysaccharides, etc. [30]. Because of their good biocompatibility and easy modification, peptides have become a good means of modification on the surface of nanomaterials [31]. Vancomycin hydrochloride (Van), as an antibacterial peptide, is a glycopeptide antibiotic with a molecular weight of 1486 and has great potential for stabilizing precious metal nanoparticles.\nIn this study, we synthesized platinum palladium bimetallic nanoparticles (VanPtm/Pdn NPs, m = 1, 2; n = 1, 2) using Van as a biological template for the first time. The particle size of the Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs was around 5 nm. A high catalytic activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was achieved by exploring the preparation method and the molar ratio of platinum and palladium. Based on the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs\u2019 oxidase-like and peroxidaselike enzymatic activity, we developed a simple and effective colorimetric method for the determination of L-cysteine with a low detection limit, a wide detection range and good selectivity. Importantly, the use of Van may reduce the toxicity of noble metals, which may offer the possibility for the wide application of noble metal nanozymes."

The reason for this is that the water molecules form a thin water film around the nanoparticles in solution, resulting in a larger hydrodynamic size than that observed with TEM [35]. Compared with the Van-Pd1-Pt2 NPs and Van-Pt2-Pd1 NPs, the Van-Pt2/Pd1 NPs and VanPt1/Pd1 NPs prepared using the one-pot method exhibited a smaller hydrodynamic size, which may be due to the dispersion performance of the Van-Pt2/Pd1 NPs and Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. In addition, the zeta potentials of the Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs were also determined (Figure 3B). The zeta potentials of the Van-Pd1-Pt2 NPs, Van-Pt2-Pd1 NPs, Van-Pt2/Pd1 NPs and Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs in aqueous solution were \u221228.5 \u00b1 2.1 mV, \u221229.5 \u00b1 3.2 mV, \u221218.9 \u00b1 2.5 mV and \u221220.6 \u00b1 2.5 mV, respectively. The absolute values of the zeta potentials of all four nanoparticles were greater than 18 mV. Their zeta potential favored their good stability and maintenance of catalytic activity in the solution state.\nFigure 3. (A) Hydrodynamic siz f Van-Ptm/ dn NPs.

In order to obtain Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs with an excellent catalytic performance, we prepared nanoparticles with different metal ratios and different synthesis methods. Figure 3C shows that all the Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs had catalytic activity. Among them, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs prepared using the one-pot method exhibited the highest catalytic ability for TMB oxidation. This indicated that the nanoparticles prepared using the one-pot method had good catalytic activity. In this case, the reaction time of the VanPt1/Pd1 NPs prepared using the one-pot method was 12 h, while the reaction time of the Van-Pt1-Pd1 NPs and Van-Pd1-Pt1 NPs prepared in a stepwise manner was 24 h, which caused the nanoparticles to become aggregated, leading to a decrease in the activity of the oxidase-like nanoparticles as compared to those obtained using the one-pot method. Meanwhile, we also compared other metal molar ratios of Van-Ptm/Pdn nanoparticles, i.e., m:n = 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 1:5, 5:1, 1:10 and 10:1, as shown in Figure S1. The results showed that the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had the highest catalytic activity for TMB. In short, among the three synthesis methods, the nanoparticles synthesized using the one-pot method had better dispersion and a smaller hydrodynamic size, which caused the nanoparticles to have more active sites; hence, the one-pot method was chosen to prepare the Pt Pd bimetallic nanoparticles. When comparing the catalytic activities of the nanozymes prepared with different molar ratios of Pt to Pd, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs showed the highest catalytic activity; thus, we chose the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs for the subsequent experiments.\nTo further test our successful synthesis of Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs, we performed XPS and XRD characterizations of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. The XPS spectra of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs showed five elements, C, N, O, Pt and Pd, as demonstrated in Figure 4A. Three elements, C, N and O, were derived from the biological template of Van, while Pt and Pd elements were reduced from K2PtCl4 and Na2PdCl4, respectively. The binding energies at 71.2 eV and\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254 8 of 17\n74.7 eV corresponded to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 orbitals of the Pt elements in Figure 4B, respectively [36]. This binding energy coincided with the binding energy of the 4f orbital of the Pt atom, which indicated that the Pt2+ in K2PtCl4 had been reduced to a Pt atom. In addition, the binding energies in Figure S2 are 284.6 eV, 286.2 eV and 288.6 eV, for which the corresponding chemical groups are C-C, C-O and C=O, respectively, and the C element was provided by Van [37\u201339]. Figure 4C shows the XPS spectrum of Pd 3d. The binding energies of 335.0 eV and 340.5 eV correspond to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 orbitals, respectively, which were consistent with the 3d orbital binding energy of Pd at a valency of 0 in the Pt/Pd alloy [40]. Therefore, the successful loading of Pt/Pd alloy nanoparticles on the template of Van could be determined using XPS spectra, further proving our successful synthesis of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. The XRD results showed that the diffraction peaks appeared at 39.76\u25e6, 46.24\u25e6, 67.45\u25e6, 81.28\u25e6 and 85.71\u25e6, which correspond to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (2 2 2) crystal planes of Pd and Pt, respectively (Figure 4D). Among the peaks, 39.76\u25e6 and 46.24\u25e6 are attributed to the planar crystal structure of Pt and Pd nanoparticles. Comparing the reference code 01-001-1194 for Pt and the reference pair 46\u20131043 for Pd, the diffraction peak is slightly higher than that of Pt and slightly lower than that of Pd. It is clear that the diffraction angles of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NP alloy are in the middle of the diffraction peaks of Pt and Pd [41]. Thus, the XRD of the Pt-Pd alloy nanoparticles proved that we successfully synthesized Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs using Van. The other peaks observed at 67.45\u25e6, 81.28\u25e6 and 85.71\u25e6 were related to the planar formation of Pt and Pd in the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. Biomolecules 2023, 13, x 9 of 18\nFigure 4.

Catalytic Activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs To test the catalytic activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs, we designed the following groups: 1TMB, 2Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs, 3TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs and 4TMB+ Pt1/Pd1 NPs. As shown in Figure 5A, the TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NP group showed the highest characteristic absorption peak, and this characteristic absorption peak was provided by the oxidized TMB (oxTMB) [42,43]. During this experiment, the absorbance of the TMB and Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs at 652 nm was close to 0, while the absorbance of the TMB + Pt1/Pd1 NP group was only 26% that of the TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs group. Therefore, the oxidase-like activity originated from the synthesized Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs.\nWe also designed different groups to investigate the peroxidase-like activity of VanPt1/Pd1 NPs: 1TMB + H2O2, 2Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + H2O2, 3TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs and 4TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + H2O2. As shown in Figure 5B, the characteristic absorption peak of oxTMB at 652 nm was the highest in the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + TMB + H2O2 group after 2 min of reaction. In addition, the TMB + H2O2 and Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + H2O2 groups did not show the characteristic absorption peak of oxTMB at 652 nm. Importantly, oxTMB peaks were observed in the TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1 NP group under the influence of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs oxidase-like activity, but the absorbance was 25% lower than that of the TMB + Van-Pt1/Pd1\nFigure 4.

(C) Optimal pH and (D) optimal temperature of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs.\nThe oxidase-like activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs is influenced by external conditions, the main influencing factors being pH and temperature. In order to find the optimal conditions for enzyme catalysis, the oxidase-like activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs at different pHs and temperatures was investigated. From Figure 5C, it can be seen that the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had the best oxidase-like activity at pH = 3. The oxidase-like activity of the VanPt1/Pd1 NPs decreased at other pHs. Therefore, the optimal pH for the oxidase-like activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was 3. The pH affects the binding of the TMB with the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. The substrate TMB should not be suitable for binding to the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs at a non-optimal pH, leading to a decrease in oxidase-like activity. Furthermore, Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs should have the highest amount of reactive oxygen species at pH = 3. The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity was then explored under the conditions of the optimal pH. In Figure 5D, it can be seen that the highest value of the nanozymes\u2019 activity was reached at 30 \u00b0C. The activity of the nanozymes decreased at all other temperatures. However, the activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was maintained at a minimum of approximately\nFigure 5. (A) Oxidase-like activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs with a reaction time of 5 min at 25 \u25e6C.

The effect of temperature on the enzyme activity was then explored under the conditions of the optimal pH. In\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254 10 of 17\nFigure 5D, it can be seen that the highest value of the nanozymes\u2019 activity was reached at 30 \u25e6C. The activity of the nanozymes decreased at all other temperatures. However, the activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was maintained at a minimum of approximately 70%. Therefore, the optimal temperature for the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was 30 \u25e6C, and they had a wide temperature range of catalytic performance. Thus, we can define the optimal conditions for the enzymatic activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs as pH = 3 and 30 \u25e6C. Subsequent experiments could be performed under these conditions. In addition, the catalytic activity of nanozymes is also related to nanoscale factors, such as their size, morphology and surface, which significantly affect their activity. Nayak et al. [44] assembled polyoxometalate (POM) (phosphotungstic acid (PTA)/phosphomolybdic acid (PMA)) nanoclusters and glucose oxidase (GOx) into microsphere structures, which facilitated the better diffusion of the reactants, intermediates and products due to the small size of the microspheres. This resulted in a 3\u20135-fold increase in the peroxidase-like activity of the PTA nanoclusters in the nanozyme microspheres.\nTo investigate the catalytic activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs, the kinetic characterization of the nanozymes was required. The reaction kinetics of the nanozymes were determined by varying the concentration of the substrate TMB [32]. As shown in Figure 6A, the catalytic reaction followed the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation in the concentration range of the substrate TMB (0.04\u20130.4 mM). As shown in Figure 6B, the standard equation was obtained as y = 0.00899x + 0.04109 (R2 = 0.999) using the double-inverse data in Figure 6A. The Km and Vmax values of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs were 0.218 mM and 24.337 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121, respectively. It can be seen from Table 1 that the Km of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was smaller compared to the other nano-enzymes, such as ZIF-67 (13.69 mM), PdPt3-LNT NDs (0.263 mM), CeM (0.66 mM) and Cy-AuNCs (1.925 mM). Thus, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had an excellent affinity for TMB. In addition, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had a larger Vmax (24.337 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121) compared to the other nanomaterials, including the PdPt3-LNT NDs (2.88 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121), Pt-HMCN (15.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121), Pd150-PCRP NPs (15.58 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121) and N-CQDs (4.49 \u00d7 10\u22128 Ms\u22121), which indicated that the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had a better catalytic effect compared to monometallic materials and non-precious metals. Therefore, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had excellent oxidase-like activity, as shown not only by their larger Vmax but also by their excellent affinity with TMB.\nMeanwhile, the oxidase-like activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was maintained at around 100% after one week of storage under ambient conditions, as shown in Figure 6C. Although the oxidase-like activity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs fluctuated to some extent, the variation was within the range of 98\u2013102%. In addition, after 120 min of incubation in the temperature range of 10\u201390 \u25e6C, the catalytic performance of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs remained around 90% in the range of 70\u201390 \u25e6C, as shown in Figure 6D. These findings indicated that the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had good stability in different pH conditions and temperature tolerance, and they had good catalytic activity in extreme environments.\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254 11 of 17Biomolecules 2023, 13, x 12 of 18\nFigure 6.

Mechanism of the Oxidase-Like Activity of Van- Pt1/Pd1 NPs The oxidation reaction of TMB based on Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs is closely related to reactive oxygen species [20]. Reactive oxygen species include as singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH), superoxide anion (O2\u00b7\u2212), etc. The mechanism of the oxidase-like activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was investigated by adding different reactive oxygen species inhibitors, such as BQ, NaN3 and IPA, which have quenching effects on O2\u00b7\u2212, 1O2 and \u00b7OH, respectively.\nTo investigate the mechanism of the oxidase-like activity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs, different experimental groups were set up, as shown in Figure 7A. It showed that the addition of NaN3 into the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + TMB system (36%) had the greatest effect on the absorbance of the reaction, followed by the effect of IPA (77%), while BQ (104%) had the least effect and showed almost no difference compared with the control group of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs + TMB (100%). Therefore, the type of reactive oxygen species produced by the VanPt1/Pd1 NPs with oxidase-like activity was mainly 1O2, containing a small amount of \u00b7OH with no O2\u00b7\u2212 production.\nFigure 6.

(A) Biocompatibility of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs. (B) Schematic diagram of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs for L-cysteine detection. (C) Linear fit of \u2206A for L-cysteine in the concentration range of 6\u2013100 \u00b5M and (D) selectivity of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs.\nThe selectivity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was investigated by detecting L-cysteine (L-cys) and potentially interfering substances, such as Mg2+, alanine (Ala), phenylalanine (Phe), leucine (Leu), glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), glutamic acid (Glu), maltose (Mal), lactose (Lac) and fructose (Fru). As sh wn in Figure 8D, the absorbance of L-cysteine was much higher than that of the other interfering agents, even when the concentration of interfering agents was three times higher than that of L-cysteine. This indicated that the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had good selectivity as probes for detecting L-cysteine. The selectivity of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs for L-cysteine was high and reasonable, as compared with other reports [58,62].\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1254 14 of 17\nTo assess the potential for, and feasibility of, application in practical assays, different L-cysteine levels in mouse serum were monitored using a standard addition method. As shown in Table 3, the recoveries are 98.8% and 105.6%, respectively, indicating that the nanozymes can be applied in real samples. The good detection performance of Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs may be related to the smaller particle size and better stability of the nanoparticles."

            "text": "In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a Van-Pt1/Pd1 NP bimetallic nanozyme with good oxidase-like activity and peroxidase-like activity by exploring the synthesis methods and metal ratios. The catalytic kinetics of the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs was in accordance with the typical Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, and the smaller Km proved that the VanPt1/Pd1 NPs had a good affinity for TMB. The Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs had a good storage stability. Meanwhile, the Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs were almost non-cytotoxic, as measured using the MTT assay. More importantly, a simple, fast and reliable L-cysteine assay was established using the prepared Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs with a wide detection range of 6\u2013100 \u00b5M and a low detection limit of 0.07 \u00b5M. In conclusion, stable Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs were synthesized successfully and could be applied in the field of biomass detection.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biom13081254/s1, Figure S1: Oxidase-like activity of Van-Ptm/Pdn NPs with different ratios of Pt and Pd at 652 nm; Figure S2: High-resolution XPS spectrum of C; Figure S3: Infrared spectra of Van and Van-Pt1/Pd1 NPs.\nAuthor Contributions: H.Z.: investigation, writing\u2014original draft.
