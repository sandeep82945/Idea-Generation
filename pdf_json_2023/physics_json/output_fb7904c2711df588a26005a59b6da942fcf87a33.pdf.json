    "abstractText": "Lipase-catalyzed transesterification is a promising and sustainable approach to producing biodiesel. To achieve highly efficient conversion of heterogeneous oils, combining the specificities and advantages of different lipases is an attractive strategy. To this end, highly active Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (1,3-specific) and stable Burkholderia cepacia lipase (non-specific) were covalently coimmobilized on 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (3-GPTMS) modified Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4). The co-immobilization process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The obtained co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 exhibited a significant improvement in activity and reaction rate compared with mono and combined-use lipases, achieving 92.9% yield after 6 h under optimal conditions, while individually immobilized TLL, immobilized BCL and their combinations exhibited yields of 63.3%, 74.2% and 70.6%, respectively. Notably, co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 achieved 90\u201398% biodiesel yields after 12 h using six different feedstocks, demonstrating the perfect synergistic effect of BCL and TLL remarkably motivated in co-immobilization. Furthermore, coBCL-TLL@Fe3O4 could maintain 77% of initial activity after nine cycles by removing methanol and glycerol from catalyst surface, accomplished by washing with t-butanol. The high catalytic efficiency, wide substrate adaptability and favorable reusability of co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 suggest that it will be an economical and effective biocatalyst for further applications.",

            "text": "With the rapid development of global modernization and industrialization, the worldwide consumption of energy is progressively increasing every year, consequently inducing ecological damage and serious environmental impacts [1,2]. Currently, fossil fuels provide approximately 70\u201380% of the total energy demand, leading to a serious carbon emissions crisis and depletion of non-renewable resources [3]. Therefore, the development of alternative renewable resources is imperative to ensure continuous energy supply and sustainable development. Biodiesel is considered to be the most suitable candidate for replacing petroleum-derived fuel because it is eco-friendly, biodegradable and technically feasible [4,5]. Additionally, biodiesel has superior combustion qualities with low sulfur and aromatic concentrations, while reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and particulates [6]. Furthermore, because of possessing similar characteristics to those of petroleum diesel, biodiesel can be used in the current compression ignition engines with minor modification [6]. The global output of biodiesel is steadily increasing, with about 41.4 billion liters expected in 2025 [7]. Among various procedures for biodiesel production, transesterification of oils and short-chain alcohols is the most efficient and economic approach using a wide variety of natural feedstocks including vegetable oils, animal fats, waste oils, and oleaginous microorganisms [8]. Although the majority of global biodiesel is derived from enabled\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4726. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24054726 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4726 2 of 16\noils at present, the use of cheap waste oils is economically valuable in light of production cost and food security [9]. However, due to the poor quality, the conventional chemically catalyzed transesterification of waste oils has been restricted, including saponification and consequent low yields in alkaline-catalyzed reactions, as well as low reaction rate and corrosive nature in acid-catalyzed reactions [10]. Lipase-catalyzed transesterification is an attractive and sustainable approach for biodiesel production, offering the advantages of compatible feedstock flexibility, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and easy separation of products [11,12]. Typically, immobilized lipases are required for economically viable applications to reduce the cost, owing to the improved operational stability and easy recovery [13,14]. In recent years, diverse immobilization strategies and carrier materials have been developed to obtain highly active immobilized lipases for biodiesel production [15,16]. Furthermore, well-designed immobilization protocols could open up integrated ways for increasing enzyme activity and stability, reducing inhibition, facilitating product isolation, and even controlling reaction process [17]. Lipases belong to the class of serine hydrolase with high specificity toward different substrates, especially for heterogeneous substrates such as oils [18,19]. During the modification of oils, the substrate mixtures are composed of different glycerides, including tri-, di-, or monoglycerides formed by diverse free fatty acids [20]. In the reaction of such complex components, lipases present different selectivities, including typoselectivity for fatty acids, regioselectivity for positional ester groups (such as 1,3-specific and 2-specific), and enantioselectivity [21]. Moreover, some of the glycerides formed in the reaction may have an inhibitory effect on the lipase, which is the ideal catalyst for the major components of the starting oil [22]. Therefore, the combined use of lipases with different specificities would have a significantly improvement in full modification of oils [22]. Lipase mixtures, in free or immobilized form, have been applied in the production of biodiesel to increase efficiency and yields [23]. Miotti et al. [24] reported the combination of lipases from Burkholderia cepacia (BCL) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) immobilized onto a silica hydroxyethylcellulose matrix in the transesterification of palm kernel oil. In this work, the lipases were packed separately in a continuous two-stage reactor, achieving highest volumetric productivity of 415.3 \u00b5mol gcat\u22121 h\u22121. The positive synergistic effect could be attributed to the complementary advantage of the 1,3-specific TLL and non-specific BCL. In another study, Binhayeeding et al. [25] demonstrated the enhanced biodiesel yield using a mixture of lipases from Candida rugosa (CRL) and Rhizomucor miehei (RML) immobilized on polyhydroxybutyrate, obtaining a maximum biodiesel yield of 96.5% within 24 h. Co-immobilization is a promising proposal for accelerating the speed of reaction, taking the advantage of reduced lag time that occurs when different enzymes are used in physical combination [26,27]. According to Yao et al. [28], covalently co-immobilized CRL and TLL on polydopamine coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited superior catalytic activity in the preparation of functional oils compared to the combination of immobilized monolipases. Shahedi et al. [29] developed the co-immobilization of lipase from Candida antarctica B (CALB) and TLL on epoxy functionalized silica gel. The co-immobilized lipases could obtain a biodiesel yield of 94% through the transesterification of palm oil within 24 h. In another study, RML and CALB were co-immobilized on amine-functionalized silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles, which produced a biodiesel yield of up to 99% from waste cooking oil after 72 h [30]. Abdulmalek et al. [31] reported the covalent co-immobilization of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) and CRL on a four-arm polyethylene glycol amine polymer. The co-immobilized lipases were applied to prepare biodiesel from waste cooking oil under ultrasound conditions resulting in 97.64% biodiesel conversion rate within 120 min. However, it will be a great challenge to find the appropriate conditions for all the enzymes involved to have high activity and stability in co-immobilization. Meanwhile, co-immobilization of different enzyme may risk abandoning the entire biocatalyst when only one of the enzymes is inactivated [27].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4726 3 of 16\nConsidering different enzymes bearing different stabilities, a reasonable optimization of the co-immobilization conditions is of critical importance to completely motivate the advantages of each enzyme. For this purpose, the response surface methodology (RSM) is a powerful tool for maximizing the performance of co-immobilized enzymes, combining mathematical and statistical techniques to determine the optimum operating conditions. Additionally, the mathematical model of RSM facilitates the analysis of interactions between variables and their effects on the response in a few experiments [32,33]. Therefore, it has been widely used in recent years for the development and optimization of biological and chemical processes [34,35]. However, there are limited reports of applying RSM to optimize the co-immobilization process of enzymes. This study aims at developing efficient and reusable co-immobilized lipases for waste oil-derived biodiesel production. To this end, for the first time, highly active TLL (1,3- specific) and stable BCL (non-specific) were co-immobilized on 3-GPTMS-modified Fe3O4 MNPs. The functional magnetic carriers were selected to facilitate the recovery and improve the operational stability of biocatalyst. A 3-level\u20133-factor Box\u2013Behnken Design (BBD) was applied to design the experiments and RSM was exploited to optimize co-immobilization process. The RSM approach has been commonly used to maximize biodiesel yield; however, its application in the optimization of immobilization conditions has rarely been reported. Various variables that influence the activity of co-immobilized lipases and their interactions are described in detail. Moreover, the synergistic advantage of co-immobilized TLL and BCL in biodiesel production from waste oil is investigated under different reaction conditions. Finally, the reusability of co-immobilized TLL and BCL in biodiesel production are performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the synergistic effect between TLL and BCL is further stimulated in co-immobilization."

            "text": "As illustrated in Figure 1a, the preparation of co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 was carried out according to a three-step procedure. The efficient co-immobilization of TLL and BCL on 3-GPTMS modified Fe3O4 MNPs was achieved by a multicomponent reaction between epoxy group, cyclohexyl isocyanate and carboxy residues of lipase [29,36]. The high active nucleophilic attack of isocyanate group to epoxy group availably accelerated the binding of lipase. As particle shape, size and surface morphology could significantly affect the catalytic activity of immobilized enzyme, synthesized magnetic carriers and co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 were characterized by SEM observation (Figure 1b). Compared to magnetic carriers, coBCL-TLL@Fe3O4 maintained a uniform spherical shape with slightly increase on average diameter, suggesting homogeneous core\u2013shell covering of 3-GPTMS and lipases. Meanwhile, the microscale dimensions of co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 implied a more homogeneous biocatalyst in reaction mixture, facilitating an easy handing and recovery [37]. As shown in Figure 2a, the functionalization of Fe3O4 MNPs and co-immobilization of lipases were confirmed using FT-IR spectra. The typical peaks of Fe3O4 at 579 cm\u22121 and 628 cm\u22121 in all samples are attributed to the stretching vibration of Fe-O bond. Compared to the spectrum of Fe3O4 MNPs, two strong broad bands presented at 1045 cm\u22121 and 1092 cm\u22121 are instigated by Si-O vibration, while new peaks at 1197 cm\u22121 are assigned to SiOCH3 stretching [38], indicating the functionalization of Fe3O4 MNPs with 3-GPTMS. The characteristic peaks of C=O stretching (amide I) and N-H bending (amide II) at 1648 cm\u22121 and 1535 cm\u22121 prove the success binding of TLL and BCL on magnetic carrier.\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\nThe magnetic features of magnetic carriers and co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 were explored by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and illustrated in Figure 2b.

Optimization of Co-Immobilization Conditions In the present work, to obtain the best co-immobilized BCL and TLL (co-BCLTLL@Fe3O4) in transesterification of WCO, effects of different co-immobilization conditions on the catalytic activity of co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 were evaluated by biodiesel yields in corresponding reactions.

The total amount of lipase bound to the magnetic carriers was calculated after co-immobilization depending on Bradford method, resulting in 100% immobilization yields under all conditions. Therefore, the corresponding biodiesel yield was set as the dependent variable in optimization of the co-immobilization process. The main factors affecting the catalytic activity of co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 in biodiesel production were selected as: amount of carrier (A), cyclohexyl isocyanate dosage (B), and BCL:TLL ratio (C). The biodiesel yields for 17 runs of experimental design and homologous predicted values are presented in Table 1, ranging from 56.95% to 92.60%.

To reveal the behavior of biodiesel yield as a function of three factors in co-immobilization, the quadratic polynomial regression equation calculated by BBD was presented in Equation (1).

Considering the p-values, the individual variables with highly significant influence on biodiesel yield responses were the amount of carrier (A) and the BCL:TLL ratio (C), among which the amount of carrier (A) was the most sensitive factor affecting the biodiesel yield, possessing the highest F-value of 103.25. The quadratic polynomial model developed was statistically significant, with a p-value < 0.0001 and an F-value of 52.43. The precision of the model was further measured by adjusted determination coefficient. The R2 value of 0.9854 and adjusted R2 value of 0.9666 demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of the regression model. Additionally, the statistically non-significant lack of fit (p value of 0.2827) indicated the high fitness of the model. As shown in the plot distribution of predicted versus actual values (Figure 3), the biodiesel yield calculated from the model satisfactorily fitted to the experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Figure 4a displayed the interaction between the amount of carrier (A) and the BCL:TLL ratio (C) at a cyclohexyl isocyanate dosage of 25 \u00b5L.

As shown in Figure 5a, the transesterifications of waste oil catalyzed by different lipase preparations were investigated in hexane as a function of time, including free lipases, individually immobilized lipases, combined use of free lipases (free BCL@TLL), combined use of individually immobilized lipases (im-BCL@im-TLL), and co-immobilized BCL and TLL (co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4).

After immobilization, the activity of free BCL and free TLL increased significantly, while TLL displayed higher catalytic activity and reaction rate compared to BCL. Therefore, the initial transesterification rates of free BCL@TLL and im-BCL@im-TLL showed a small decrease in relation to free TLL and im-TLL, which was due to the addition of less-efficient BCL.

Using proper solvents in biodiesel production could pro ote ass transfer efficiency while improving lipase activity and avoiding inhibition of short-chain alcohols [39].

A maximum yield of 94.1% was observed using n-octane as solvents, which might improve the miscibility of waste oil and methanol and decrease the deleterious effect of methanol [40]. Therefore, n-octane was chosen as the ideal reaction medium for further investigation.\nFigure 6. Effect of different transesterification conditions on biodiesel yield from waste oils: (a) solvent; (b) molar ratio of methanol to oil; (c) temperature.\nAs the acyl acceptor of transesterification, an appropriate increase in methanol concentration could raise the probability of collision between substrate and enzyme and enhance the reaction rate. Meanwhile, as a competitive inhibitor, excess methanol might induce aggregation and inactivation of enzyme [41,42], decreasing the reaction yield. Therefore, the molar ratio of methanol to oil (M:O) is a crucial parameter for enzymatic biodiesel production. According to Figure 6b, free TLL exhibited maximum yield at M:O of 6:1, while free BCL remained relatively constant with methanol concentration, indicating that methanol was better tolerated than free TLL. For co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4, the biodiesel yield reached a maximum value at M:O of 6:1, and remained at a level of 87.2% at M:O of 8:1, suggesting a good tolerance to methanol. The optimal M:O of 6:1 was adopted for further optimization. The effect of reaction temperature on the enzymatic biodiesel production was explored by varying the temperature from 25 to 55 \u00b0C. As illustrated in Figure 6c, the optimal temperatures for free TLL and free BCL were 30 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C, respectively. For co-BCLTLL@Fe3O4, 98.1% biodiesel yield was produced at 25 \u00b0C and the highest biodiesel yield of 98.4% was obtained at 30 \u00b0C after 12 h. When the reaction temperature increased from 30 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C, biodiesel yields declined slightly to 91.4%. At a temperature above 50 \u00b0C, the biodiesel yield decreased drastically due to the thermal inactivation of lipases. Hence, the optimum reaction temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C, implying an energy-saving biodiesel production.\nFigure 6.

The optimal M:O of 6:1 was adopted for further optimization. The effect of reaction temperature on the enzymatic biodiesel production was explored by varying the temperature from 25 to 55 \u25e6C. As illustrated in Figure 6c, the optimal temperatures for free TLL and free BCL were 30 \u25e6C and 35 \u25e6C, respectively. For co-BCLTLL@Fe3O4, 98.1% biodiesel yield was produced at 25 \u25e6C and the highest biodiesel yield of 98.4% was obtained at 30 \u25e6C after 12 h. When the reaction temperature increased from 30 \u25e6C to 45 \u25e6C, biodiesel yields declined slightly to 91.4%. At a temperature above 50 \u25e6C, the biodiesel yield decreased drastically due to the thermal inactivation of lipases. Hence, the optimum reaction temperature was set at 30 \u25e6C, implying an energy-saving biodiesel production. In addition, a comparison between co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4, individually immobilized lipases (im-TLL and im-BCL), and the combination of immobilized lipases in transesterification of waste oil was performed as a function of time in n-octane at 6:1 M:O and 30 \u25e6C.

Conversely, the catalytic performances of free TLL and free BCL were obviously dependent on the type of oil, suggesting that lipases possessing different regioselectivity and typoselectivity in the transesterification with triacylglycerols. It can be inferred from these results that the co-immobilization of lipases differing in their selectivity could provide a fully functional and catalytic active biocatalyst for heterogeneous substrates.\nFigure 7.

The co-immobilization process was optimized using RSM with a 3-level\u20133-factor BBD. Compared with mono lipase and combined-use lipases, co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 exhibited a significant improvement in activity and reaction rate, indicating the beneficial synergistic effect of BCL and TLL remarkably motivated in co-immobilization. Various factors influencing co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4-catalyzed biodiesel production were investigated, resulting in a maximum yield of 98.4% within 12 h under optimal conditions. Significantly, co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 displayed superior activity at 30 \u25e6C, suggesting a low-energy-consuming enzymatic process. Furthermore, co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 was applied to biodiesel production using six different feedstocks, with biodiesel yields exceeding 90% were obtained after 12 h in all tested oils. The wide substrate adaptability demonstrated the perfect complementation of BCL and TLL in terms of specificity. Owing to the effective removal of methanol and glycerol by washing with t-butanol, co-BCL-TLL@Fe3O4 could maintain 77% of initial activity after nine cycles, suggesting superior reusability. Therefore, this study provides a highly efficient, magnetically separable and reusable biocatalyst for sustainable production of biodiesel from abundant oils.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, W.Z.; methodology, W.Z.; validation, M.L., L.M. and W.Z.; investigation, Q.W.; data curation, R.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, W.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, W.Z.; visualization, Q.W. and W.Z.; project administration, W.Z.; funding acquisition, W.Z.
