    "abstractText": "Mechanical couplings such as axial\u2013shear and axial\u2013bending have great potential in the design of active mechanical metamaterials with directional control of input and output loads in sensors and actuators. However, the current ad hoc design of mechanical coupling without theoretical support of elasticity cannot provide design guidelines for mechanical coupling with lattice geometries. Moreover, the correlation between mechanical coupling effects and geometric symmetry is not yet clearly understood. In this work, we systematically search for all possible mechanical couplings in 2D lattice structures by determining the non-zero diagonal terms in the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor. We also correlate the mechanical couplings with the point-group symmetry of 2D lattices by applying the symmetry operation to the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor. The decoupled micropolar constitutive equation uncovers eight coupling effects for 2D lattice structures. The symmetry operation of the decoupled micropolar elasticity tensor reveals the correlation of the mechanical coupling with the point groups. Our findings can strengthen the design of mechanical metamaterials with potential applications in areas including sensors, actuators, soft robots, and active metamaterials for elastic/acoustic wave guidance and thermal management.",

However, the current ad hoc design of mechanical coupling without theoretical support of elasticity cannot provide design guidelines for mechanical coupling with lattice geometries. Moreover, the correlation between mechanical coupling effects and geometric symmetry is not yet clearly understood. In this work, we systematically search for all possible mechanical couplings in 2D lattice structures by determining the non-zero diagonal terms in the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor. We also correlate the mechanical couplings with the point-group symmetry of 2D lattices by applying the symmetry operation to the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor. The decoupled micropolar constitutive equation uncovers eight coupling effects for 2D lattice structures. The symmetry operation of the decoupled micropolar elasticity tensor reveals the correlation of the mechanical coupling with the point groups. Our findings can strengthen the design of mechanical metamaterials with potential applications in areas including sensors, actuators, soft robots, and active metamaterials for elastic/acoustic wave guidance and thermal management.\nKeywords: mechanical coupling, point groups, symmetry operation, micropolar elasticity, mechanical metamaterials"

            "text": "Poisson\u2019s ratio [1] is a well-known mechanical coupling effect describing the coupling of longitudinal and lateral strain. In the earlier stage, Poisson and Navier believed that Poisson\u2019s ratio was 0.25 for all isotropic materials based on the uni-constant theory [2]. Later, the theoretical bound of Poisson\u2019s ratio was determined to be \u22121 to 0.5 for 3D isotropic materials using the positive-definite property of the elasticity tensor [3,4]. Since Lakes\u2019 experimental demonstration of negative Poisson\u2019s ratio of cellular foams in 1987 [5], numerous researchers have explored the engineering of the mechanical coupling with lattice (or cellular) structures in stochastic or non-stochastic manners [2,6\u201312]. In addition to Poisson\u2019s ratio, another mechanical coupling that can be described by the constitutive equation of the classical Cauchy elasticity is the axial\u2013shear coupling [13\u201315], describing a shear deformation coupled with an axial input loading.\nRecently, several mechanical coupling effects have been reported: axial\u2013twist [16], axial\u2013rotation [17], and axial\u2013bending [18] couplings. These unique coupling effects have potential applications in mechanical cloaking [19\u201321], sensors/actuators [22], deployable structures [23], and elastic/acoustic wave control\n[17,24\u201326]. These couplings cannot be explained by the classical Cauchy elasticity, which uses the symmetric stress (or strain) tensor. Instead, the micropolar elasticity with an asymmetric stress tensor [27,28] provides more freedom to search mechanical coupling effects by adapting the independent rotation of vertices.\nThe coupling effects are related to the non-zero terms of the micropolar elasticity tensor [15,17]. Liu et al. proposed a planar isotropic micropolar elasticity tensor to capture the 2D chiral effect, introducing a material parameter related to chirality that represents the axial\u2013rotation coupling [17]. From the orthotropic micropolar elasticity model proposed in [27], Yuan et al. found another parameter related to axial\u2013shear coupling and proposed an equation to quantitatively measure the magnitude of the coupling effect [15]. However, these ad hoc design-based micropolar mechanics models adapt a mixed shear strain and nodal rotation, requiring identification of all possible mechanical couplings in the generalized lattice domain.\nFrom observations of previous coupling effects [15\u201318], chirality, the broken mirror symmetry is vital in generating mechanical coupling effects. A triangular chiral [3] or hexa-chiral lattice composed of circular rings and straight ligaments has an axial\u2013rotation coupling. Notably, chirality refers to lattices with broken mirror symmetries [29,30], which is a significant factor causing an axial\u2013shear coupling. Yuan et al. showed that an axial\u2013shear coupling exists in a tetra-chiral lattice but not in a tetra-achiral lattice [15]. Li et al. designed a square chiral lattice by assigning two materials to the structs while breaking a mirror symmetry, producing an axial\u2013shear coupling [14]. Cui et al. showed that the non-centrosymmetric square lattice has axial\u2013bending coupling [18]. However, there is no clear understanding of the correlation between mechanical coupling effects and geometric symmetry.\nTherefore, this work aims to systematically search all possible mechanical couplings in 2D lattice structures. We construct a micropolar elasticity tensor that can decouple the shear strain and nodal rotation, explicitly identifying the coupling effects in the constitutive equation by obtaining non-zero diagonal terms in the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor. Following Neumann\u2019s principle [31], we obtain the micropolar elasticity tensor for varying symmetry operations, providing possible coupling effects for varying point groups of lattices. We uncover all possible mechanical coupling effects of 2D lattices, which are strongly supported by the micropolar elasticity and subsequently validated by finite element (FE)-based simulations."

The physical meaning of \ud835\udc3812 is half of the engineering shear strain, whereas \ud835\udc3412 represents a local rotation at one point.\nNote that the macroscopic rotation \ud835\udefa is different from the local rotation \ud835\udc3421 .

There are eight mechanical coupling effects for 2D lattice materials: an axial\u2013axial (A\u2013A) coupling, which is simply the Poisson effect; an axial\u2013shear (A\u2013S) coupling; an axial\u2013rotation (A\u2013R) coupling; an axial\u2013bending (A\u2013B) coupling; a shear\u2013rotation (S\u2013R) coupling; a shear\u2013bending (S\u2013B) coupling; a bending\u2013rotation (B\u2013R) coupling; and a bending\u2013bending (B\u2013B) coupling. The A\u2013A, A\u2013S, A\u2013R, and A\u2013B coupling have been previously discovered [13,15,17,18]. However, the remaining four coupling effects, S\u2013R, S\u2013B, B\u2013R, and B\u2013 B, have not yet been explored in 2D lattice structures.\nNotably, the diagonal terms of the decoupled micropolar elasticity tensor are associated with a direct effect on the resistance to deformation: the axial moduli (\ud835\udc5011 and \ud835\udc5022), shear modulus (\ud835\udc5033), and bending stiffness (\ud835\udc5111 and \ud835\udc5122). However, the non-diagonal terms represent the mechanical coupling effects. The term \ud835\udc5012 controls Poisson\u2019s effect. The terms \ud835\udc5013 and \ud835\udc5023 affect the A\u2013S coupling: e.g., a shear deformation by a uniaxial loading. The terms \ud835\udc5014 and \ud835\udc5024 affect the A\u2013R coupling, where the rotation refers to the nodal rotation \ud835\udc3412. The nonsymmetric matrix [ \ud835\udc4f11 \ud835\udc4f12 \ud835\udc4f21 \ud835\udc4f22 ] indicates an A\u2013B coupling. The term \ud835\udc5112 contributes to a B\u2013B coupling, i.e., bending in one direction led by bending in another direction.\nThe terms \ud835\udc4f41 and \ud835\udc4f42 represent a B\u2013R coupling. The term \ud835\udc5034 guides an S\u2013R coupling. The terms \ud835\udc4f31 and \ud835\udc4f32 determine an S\u2013B coupling.\nFigure 3 shows the eight potential mechanical coupling effects for 2D structures. Notably, the constitutive relation with the Cauchy elasticity tensor can still identify the A\u2013A and A\u2013S couplings [35] yet has a limitation in the search for other coupling effects. In contrast, the micropolar elasticity can recognize the rest of the couplings. The A\u2013S coupling has been found in the tetra-chiral structures [14,15,36]. A triangular chiral structure is known to have an A\u2013R coupling [17]. Recently, an A\u2013B coupling was observed in a non-centrosymmetric square lattice [18]. Note that the A\u2013B and S\u2013B couplings in this work are different from the ones in the laminated composites [37]; the bending in this study is in the in-plane deformation, whereas the bending in the laminated composites is in the out-of-plane deformation.\nWe summarize the eight different coupling effects with the corresponding terms of \ud835\udc2a in Table 1. Similar to Poisson\u2019s ratio, we can define the coupling coefficients as the ratio of the two related strains, where \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \u22121 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \u22121 , and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \u22121 represent the elements of \ud835\udc2a\u22121 . Note that one coupling effect can have multiple coupling coefficients depending on the direction of input strains.\nNotably, the shear strain \ud835\udc3812 and the local rotation \ud835\udc3412 are invariant because they are independent of the coordinate transformation [38]. However, the axial strain and the bending curvature are variant. The coupling by two invariant strains produces an invariant, i.e., an S\u2013R coupling coefficient in Table 1. The couplings by invariant and variant strains generate a variant, i.e., A\u2013S, A\u2013R, S\u2013B, and B\u2013R couplings. The couplings by two variant strains produce a more complicated scenario: the Poisson\u2019s effect (A\u2013A coupling) is variant in anisotropic materials; however, it becomes invariant in isotropic materials [35]. The bending\u2013 bending and axial\u2013bending couplings are more complicated, as discussed in Section 4."

            "text": "All 2D lattice geometries can be classified into 10 point groups depending on their symmetry property [29,39]. There are seven symmetry operations in a 2D plane: the identity transformation (1), 2-fold rotation (\ud835\udc79\ud835\udfd0), 3-fold rotation (\ud835\udc79\ud835\udfd1), 4-fold rotation (\ud835\udc79\ud835\udfd2), 6-fold rotation (\ud835\udc79\ud835\udfd4), and mirror with respect to the \ud835\udc651-axis (\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udfcf) and \ud835\udc652 axis (\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udfd0). Every symmetry operation corresponds to a coordinate transformation by the direction cosine \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57(= \ud835\udc0b) between unbarred (?\u0302?\ud835\udc57) and barred (?\u0302\u0305?\ud835\udc56) coordinate bases:\n?\u0302\u0305?\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57?\u0302?\ud835\udc57, (8)\nwhere \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = [ 1 0 0 1 ] for an identity transformation, \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = [ cos \ud835\udf03 sin \ud835\udf03 \u2212sin\ud835\udf03 cos \ud835\udf03 ] for a rotational transformation (\ud835\udc452 , \ud835\udc453 , \ud835\udc454 , and \ud835\udc456 correspond to \ud835\udf03 = \ud835\udf0b , 2\ud835\udf0b\n3 , \ud835\udf0b 2 , and \ud835\udf0b 3 , respectively), and \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = [ 1 0 0 \u22121 ] and \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 =\n[ \u22121 0 0 1 ] are the mirror transformations with respect to the \ud835\udc651- and \ud835\udc652 axes, respectively.\nUsing the transformation law of second-order tensors [31],\n[ ?\u0305?11 ?\u0305?22 ?\u0305?12 ?\u0305?21 ] = |\ud835\udc59| [ \ud835\udc5911 2 \ud835\udc5912 2 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5912 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5912 \ud835\udc5921 2 \ud835\udc5922 2 \ud835\udc5921\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5921\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5922] [ \ud835\udf0e11 \ud835\udf0e22 \ud835\udf0e12 \ud835\udf0e21 ], (9)\nwhere |\ud835\udc59| is the determinant of \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57. Note that |\ud835\udc59| = 1 for a rotational transformation and |\ud835\udc59| = \u22121 for a mirror transformation because the mirror transformation changes the handedness of the axial coordinate.\nHowever, the couple stress in 2D is a first-order tensor; thus,\n[ ?\u0305?13 ?\u0305?23 ] = |\ud835\udc59| [ \ud835\udc5911 \ud835\udc5912 \ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5922 ] [ \ud835\udc5a13 \ud835\udc5a23 ]. (10)\nThe transformation matrix for the generalized stress vector \ud835\uded4 in Equation (2) can be assembled from Equations (9)\u2013(10):\n\ud835\udc11 = |\ud835\udc59| [ \ud835\udc5911 2 \ud835\udc5912 2 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5912 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5912 0 0 \ud835\udc5921 2 \ud835\udc5922 2 \ud835\udc5921\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5921\ud835\udc5922 0 0 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5921 0 0 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5922 \ud835\udc5912\ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5911\ud835\udc5922 0 0 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc5911 \ud835\udc5912 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc5921 \ud835\udc5922] . (11)\nThus, the transformed stress in a vector form is given by\n?\u0305? = \ud835\udc11 \u2219 \ud835\uded4. (12)\nAccording to [31], the transformed strain is given by\n?\u0305? = (\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc47)\u22121 \u2219 \ud835\udec6. (13)\nNotably, \ud835\udc11 is an orthogonal transformation: \ud835\udc11\u2212\ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc11.\nThe constitutive equation in the transformed coordinate is\n?\u0305? = ?\u0305? \u2219 ?\u0305?. (14)\nSubstituting Equations (12) and (13) into Equation (14) gives:\n\ud835\udc11 \u2219 \ud835\uded4 = ?\u0305? \u2219 \ud835\udc11\u2212\ud835\udc47 \u2219 \ud835\udec6 (15)\ni.e.,\n\ud835\uded4 = \ud835\udc11\u22121 \u2219 ?\u0305? \u2219 \ud835\udc11\u2212\ud835\udc47 \u2219 \ud835\udec6. (16)\nNote the elasticity tensors in the original and transformed coordinates are given by\n\ud835\udc10 = \ud835\udc11\u22121 \u2219 ?\u0305? \u2219 \ud835\udc11\u2212\ud835\udc47 (17)\n?\u0305? = \ud835\udc11 \u2219 \ud835\udc10 \u2219 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc47 . (18)\nAccording to Neumann\u2019s principle [31], if the geometry is invariant under such transformation, the elasticity tensor should also be invariant, i.e.,\n?\u0305? = \ud835\udc10. (19)\nSolving Equation (19) by comparing the elasticity tensor before and after symmetry operation, one can identify the nonzero components of \ud835\udc10 . Table 2 summarizes the nonzero terms of \ud835\udc10 for different symmetry operations, showing that each symmetry operation has different sets of nonzero terms.\n\ud835\udc5a2\n\ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3512\n\ud835\udc3622 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3522 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3634 \ud835\udc3531 0\n\ud835\udc3644 \ud835\udc3541 0\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3722\n12\nThe components of [ \ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc3512 \ud835\udc3521 \ud835\udc3522 ] are 0 if and only if the geometry has an \ud835\udc452 symmetry, which is consistent with a previous study [40]. Note that \ud835\udc452 includes \ud835\udc454 and \ud835\udc456. Also note that the \u2018centrosymmetric\u2019 used in the literature [18,41] is equivalent to \ud835\udc452 for 2D structures.\nApplying Equation (7) to Table 2, we can obtain the decoupled micropolar elasticity tensor \ud835\udc2a for each symmetry operation, showing that each symmetry operation provides different coupling effects in the non-diagonal elements of the decoupled elasticity tensor, as shown in Table 3.\n\ud835\udc456\n[ \ud835\udc5011 \ud835\udc5012 0 \ud835\udc5014 0 0 \ud835\udc5011 0 \ud835\udc5014 0 0 \ud835\udc5011 \u2212 \ud835\udc5012 2 0 0 0 \ud835\udc5044 0 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5111 0\n\ud835\udc5111]\n5\n\ud835\udc5a1\n[ \ud835\udc5011 \ud835\udc5012 0 0 \ud835\udc4f11 0 \ud835\udc5022 0 0 \ud835\udc4f21 0 \ud835\udc5033 \ud835\udc5034 0 \ud835\udc4f32 \ud835\udc5044 0 \ud835\udc4f42 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5111 0\n\ud835\udc5122]\n12\n\ud835\udc5a2\n\ud835\udc5011 \ud835\udc5012 0 0 0 \ud835\udc4f12\n\ud835\udc5022 0 0 0 \ud835\udc4f22 \ud835\udc5033 \ud835\udc5034 \ud835\udc4f31 0\n\ud835\udc5044 \ud835\udc4f41 0\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5111 0\n\ud835\udc5122\n12\nApparently, adding symmetry leads to a reduction of mechanical coupling effects. The \ud835\udc452 symmetry eliminates A\u2013B, S\u2013B, and B\u2013R couplings. The \ud835\udc454 symmetry further eliminates an S\u2013R coupling. The \ud835\udc453 symmetry ensures that there is no A\u2013S coupling, S\u2013R coupling, B\u2013R coupling, or B\u2013B coupling. Because \ud835\udc456 is a combination of \ud835\udc452 and \ud835\udc453, it can eliminate all the coupling effects except Poisson\u2019s effect and an A\u2013R coupling. The \ud835\udc5a1 and \ud835\udc5a2 symmetry operations eliminate A\u2013S and A\u2013R couplings. Notably, no symmetry operation can eliminate Poisson\u2019s effect.\nYuan et al. showed that structures with an \ud835\udc454 symmetry such as tetra-chiral structures have an A\u2013S coupling [15]. Liu et al. showed that a hexa-chiral structure with an \ud835\udc456 symmetry has a bulk\u2013rotation coupling [17], which is equivalent to an A\u2013R coupling of this work. Cui et al. showed that the noncentrosymmetric square lattice has an A\u2013B coupling [18]. However, these works [15,17,18] lack theoretical proof of the relationship between coupling effects and symmetry. In contrast, our present work reveals that symmetry is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of A\u2013S, A\u2013R, A\u2013B, and other coupling effects."

            "text": "In general, a lattice structure can possess more than one symmetry operation; a lattice geometry can be classified into multiple point groups based on the symmetry operations to which it belongs [39]. The micropolar elasticity tensor of a point group must remain unchanged under all the symmetry operations of this point group. There are ten point groups in 2D lattice structures: 1, 2, \ud835\udc5a, 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a, 4, 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a, 3, 3\ud835\udc5a, 6, and 6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a. From Table 1, we can classify the micropolar elasticity tensor for every point group together with the corresponding symmetry operations, as shown in Table 4. Note that there are two types of elasticity tensors for the point groups \ud835\udc5a and 3\ud835\udc5a depending on the mirror symmetry axes (\ud835\udc651 and \ud835\udc652), as indicated in Table 4. Thus, we have 12(= 10 + 2) types of micropolar elasticity tensor \ud835\udc10 compared with three types in the Cauchy elasticity tensor [39]. The point group 3 ensures isotropy in the Cauchy elasticity [42]. However, the point group 6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a ensures an isotropy in the micropolar elasticity because more\nparameters are used in the micropolar theory to describe higher-order material properties. We can also find that the A\u2013B and B\u2013B couplings are not invariant because these coupling effects disappear in the elasticity tensor of 6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a; there are no \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) or \ud835\udc3712 (\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5112) elements in 6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a in Tables 4 and 5.\n4 \ud835\udc454\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 \ud835\udc3613 \ud835\udc3614 0 0 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212\ud835\udc3614 \u2212\ud835\udc3613 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3634 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711]\n7\n4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc454, \ud835\udc5a1, \ud835\udc5a2\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3611 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3634 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711]\n5\n3 \ud835\udc453\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 \ud835\udc3613 \u2212\ud835\udc3613 \ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc3512 \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3613 \u2212\ud835\udc3613 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 \u2212\ud835\udc3512 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212 \ud835\udc3612 \u2212 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3512 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3512 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711 ]\n7\n3\ud835\udc5a\n\ud835\udc453, \ud835\udc5a1\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 0 0 \ud835\udc3511 0 \ud835\udc3611 0 0 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212 \ud835\udc3612 \u2212 \ud835\udc3633 0 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc3633 0 \u2212\ud835\udc3511 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711 ]\n5\n\ud835\udc453, \ud835\udc5a2\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3512 \ud835\udc3611 0 0 0 \u2212\ud835\udc3512 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212 \ud835\udc3612 \u2212 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3512 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3512 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711 ]\n5\n6 \ud835\udc456\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 \ud835\udc3613 \u2212\ud835\udc3613 0 0 \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3613 \u2212\ud835\udc3613 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212 \ud835\udc3612 \u2212 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711]\n5\n6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc456, \ud835\udc5a1, \ud835\udc5a2\n[ \ud835\udc3611 \ud835\udc3612 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3611 0 0 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 \ud835\udc3611 \u2212 \ud835\udc3612 \u2212 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc3633 0 0 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc3711 0\n\ud835\udc3711]\n4\nWe can compare the elasticity tensor \ud835\udc10 with the ones in the literature for different lattice structures, such as a straight rectangle (point group 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a) [28], a chiral square (point group 4) [40], a straight square (point group 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a) [28], a chiral triangle (point group 6) [17], a straight triangle (point group 6\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a) [28], and a non-centrosymmetric square (point group \ud835\udc5a) [18].

Among the eight coupling effects in Figure 2, the A\u2013A coupling (Poisson\u2019s effect) belongs to all point groups, whereas the others gradually disappear as the degree of symmetry increases. Some of our findings are consistent with previous works; i.e., a tetra-chiral structure (point group 4) shows an A\u2013S coupling [15,36], a triangular chiral lattice (point group 6) shows an A\u2013R coupling [17], and a noncentrosymmetric square lattice (point group \ud835\udc5a) shows an A\u2013B coupling [18]. Neumann\u2019s principle can find zero terms only in the elasticity tensor without considering geometric connection, meaning the nonzero terms could be zero for a specific geometry. Therefore, it may be fair to say that the point group is a necessary but not sufficient condition of the coupling effects. For example, we can ensure that the square lattice whose point group is 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a does not have an A\u2013B coupling, as shown in Table 6, but cannot ensure that all the geometries belonging to 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a have an A\u2013A coupling.

As shown in Table 7, we may find an axial\u2013bending coupling effect in the point groups 1, \ud835\udc5a, 3, and 3\ud835\udc5a. To avoid the effect of other coupling effects in point groups 1, 3, and 3\ud835\udc5a, a structure of point group \ud835\udc5a is constructed, as shown in Figure 5a. Nodal forces are applied on the left and right boundary nodes while maintaining the center node fixed. For comparison, we investigate the deformation of a straight square lattice of the point group 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a for the same loading, as indicated in Figure 5b. Figure 5c plots the vertical displacements of the joints on the horizontal centerlines. Figure 5c shows the bending deformation of the horizontal centerline of a curved square lattice in the point group \ud835\udc5a and no bending deformation of the straight square lattice belonging to the point group 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a.\nA shear\u2013rotation coupling means a nonzero shear strain \ud835\udc3812 producing a rotation \ud835\udc3412 in Equation (4), which exists in a rectangular lattice of the point group 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a but not in a square lattice of the point group 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a. We apply a pure shear loading on the rectangular and square lattices, as shown in Figure 6a and Figure 6b. The rotational displacements \ud835\udf11 of the nodes on the horizontal centerlines are plotted in Figure 6c, demonstrating nonzero values for the rectangular lattice of 2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a.\nAs shown in Table 7, S\u2013B coupling can exist in point groups \ud835\udc5a, 3, and 3\ud835\udc5a. We construct a structure belonging to \ud835\udc5a, as shown in Figure 7a. Because an S\u2013B coupling is equivalent to a B\u2013S coupling, we demonstrate a B\u2013S coupling for convenience of measure. We apply moments on the nodes of the top and bottom boundaries. The vertical displacements of the nodes on the horizontal centerlines are plotted in Figure 7c, which shows the existence of shear deformation of the lattice \ud835\udc5a.\nTable 6 shows that a square lattice of the point group \ud835\udc5a can have the bending\u2013rotation (B\u2013R) coupling. We apply moments on the top and bottom boundaries of square lattices of the point groups \ud835\udc5a and 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\nas shown in Figures 8a and 8b, respectively, while fixing the center node. Figure 8c plots the rotational displacements \ud835\udf11 of the nodes on the horizontal centerline.\nA straight square lattice of 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a shows zero rotational displacements on the nodes of the horizontal centerline. In contrast, the curved square lattice of the point group \ud835\udc5a shows a nonzero constant \ud835\udf11, verifying our theory.\nAccording to Table 6, a bending\u2013bending (B\u2013B) coupling exists in point groups 1 and 2. We select a curved lattice of point group 2 for a numerical test, as shown in Figure 9a. We apply moments on the top and bottom boundaries of the lattices. Figure 9c shows the horizontal displacements on the nodes of the vertical centerline. Apparently, there is a bending deformation in the horizontal direction for the curved rectangular lattice in point group 2, demonstrating a B\u2013B coupling. However, the straight square lattice in point group 4\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a does not show a B\u2013B coupling.\nThere are many ways to generate mechanical couplings by breaking symmetry. Replacing straight ligaments of lattices with curved ones is one way to produce the coupling effects [15,18]. Alternative methods include assigning different materials to straight lattices [14], nonuniform cross-sections to the straight ligaments [44\u201346], and a combination of rigid rings and flexible struts [17,40,47]. Essentially, any methods that break the symmetry of the lattices can be used to design mechanical coupling effects."

            "text": "Due to no clear understanding of i) mechanical coupling with elasticity and ii) correlation between mechanical coupling and geometric symmetry, we secure the solution from the elasticity tensor and symmetry operation. We obtain the non-zero diagonal terms in the elasticity tensor by decoupling the shear deformation and nodal rotation in the micropolar elasticity tensor, revealing eight mechanical couplings in 2D lattices. Applying the symmetry operation to the decomposed micropolar elasticity tensor, we correlate the mechanical coupling with the point groups in 2D lattices. We also connect each mechanical coupling with the 10 point groups and seven symmetry operations in the planar lattice geometries.\nThis work focuses on the general guideline to identify mechanical couplings from the micropolar constitutive relations, limiting its scope to a qualitative study. However, one can extend our findings to quantitatively calculate mechanical coupling coefficients for a specific lattice geometry, e.g., a quantitative study of an A-S coupling coefficient of a tetra-chiral lattice [15]. Even though we can verify the mechanical couplings with FE simulations, some couplings are challenged to validate with a conventional mechanical testing method, e.g., B-R and B-B couplings of (g) and (h) in Figure 3. To rotate struts, one may need non-contact actuation, such as magnetic control.\nOur methodology and findings are significant because they can provide a mechanics-inspired design guideline on the mechanical couplings integrated with geometric symmetry. Four out of the eight mechanical couplings are the first discovery in the history of mechanics: S-R, S-B, B-R, and B-B couplings. The correlation of the mechanical couplings with the point groups in this work can strengthen the design\nof mechanical metamaterials with potential applications in various areas, including sensors, actuators, soft robots, and active metamaterials."
