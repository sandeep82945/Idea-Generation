Ergot alkaloids are secondary metabolites that are produced by fungi and contaminate cereal crops and grasses. The ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps purpurea are the most abundant worldwide. The metabolites exist in two configurations, the C-8-R-isomer (R-epimer) and the C-8-S-isomer (S-epimer). These two configurations can interconvert to one another. Ergot alkaloids cause toxic effects after consumption of ergot-contaminated food and feed at various concentrations. For bioactivity reasons, the C-8-R-isomers have been studied to a greater extent than the C-8-S-isomer since the C-8-S-isomers were considered biologically inactive. However, recent studies suggest the contrary. Analytical assessment of ergot alkaloids now includes the C-8-S-isomers and high concentrations of specific C-8-S-isomers have been identified. The inclusion of the C-8-S-isomer in regulatory standards is reviewed. The objectives of this review are to provide an overview of historic and current studies that have assessed the C-8-S-isomers. Specifically, this review will compare the C-8-R-isomers to the C-8-S-isomers with an emphasis on the biological activity and analytical assessment. conclusions Globally, ergot alkaloid contamination is an issue in food and feed and can effect the health and well-being of humans and animals. Historical and current studies on the C-8-Sisomers have been collected to demonstrate and highlight the progression of C-8-S-isomer research and compare it to the C-8-R-isomer. The biological and analytical aspects of the C-8-S-isomers are important to consider because of the potential effects to the health of humans and animals. Once there is a greater understanding of the C-8-S-isomers, acceptance of

the C-8-S-isomers into the regulatory recommendations for food and feed worldwide for the protection of human and animal health may occur.
