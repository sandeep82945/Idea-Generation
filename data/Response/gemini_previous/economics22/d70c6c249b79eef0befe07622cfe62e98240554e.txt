1. **Investigate the relationship between informal employment and subjective well-being in different cultural contexts.** The study focused on China, but it would be interesting to see if the results hold true in other countries with different cultural norms and values.


2. **Examine the impact of informal employment on subjective well-being over time.** The study used cross-sectional data, so it is not possible to say how informal employment affects subjective well-being over time. A longitudinal study could help to shed light on this issue.


3. **Explore the role of social support in mitigating the negative effects of informal employment on subjective well-being.** The study found that social capital is an important factor in determining subjective well-being, but it did not specifically examine the role of social support. A future study could investigate how social support from family, friends, and community members can help to buffer the negative effects of informal employment on subjective well-being.


4. **Investigate the relationship between informal employment and subjective well-being among specific population groups.** The study looked at the overall population of urban workers in China, but it would be interesting to see how informal employment affects subjective well-being among specific population groups, such as women, migrants, or older workers.


5. **Examine the impact of government policies on the relationship between informal employment and subjective well-being.** The study found that the social welfare system can mitigate the negative effects of informal employment on subjective well-being. A future study could investigate how government policies, such as minimum wage laws, unemployment benefits, and social security programs, can affect the relationship between informal employment and subjective well-being.
