    "abstractText": "The pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 led to a global crisis in the world healthcare system. Despite some progress in the creation of antiviral vaccines and mass vaccination of the population, the number of patients continues to grow because of the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 mutations. There is an urgent need for direct-acting drugs capable of suppressing or stopping the main mechanisms of reproduction of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Several studies have shown that the successful replication of the virus in the cell requires proteolytic cleavage of the protein structures of the virus. Two proteases are crucial in replicating SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). In this review, we summarize the essential viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 required for its viral life cycle as targets for chemotherapy of coronavirus infection and provide a critical summary of the development of drugs against COVID-19 from the drug repurposing strategy up to the molecular design of novel covalent and non-covalent agents capable of inhibiting virus replication. We overview the main antiviral strategy and the choice of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro proteases as promising targets for pharmacological impact on the coronavirus life cycle.",

There is an\nurgent need for direct-acting drugs capable of suppressing or stopping the main mechanisms of\nreproduction of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Several studies have shown that the successful replication\nof the virus in the cell requires proteolytic cleavage of the protein structures of the virus. Two proteases\nare crucial in replicating SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses: the main protease (Mpro) and the\npapain-like protease (PLpro). In this review, we summarize the essential viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2\nrequired for its viral life cycle as targets for chemotherapy of coronavirus infection and provide a critical\nsummary of the development of drugs against COVID-19 from the drug repurposing strategy up to the\nmolecular design of novel covalent and non-covalent agents capable of inhibiting virus replication. We\noverview the main antiviral strategy and the choice of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro proteases as\npromising targets for pharmacological impact on the coronavirus life cycle."

SARS and other manifestations of the disease were caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, previously not circulating in human intercourse, and received the official name \u2013 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1\nSARS-CoV-2 affected about 770 million people in 2 years, causing respiratory, renal, cardiac, cerebral and intestinal manifestations of the disease, which ranged from mild to fatal consequences.2,3 As of June 20, 2023, 2.5 years aer the diagnosis of the disease, about 6.95 million people with a conrmed diagnosis of COVID-19 have died.4\nExtensive vaccination campaigns have shown effectiveness against the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU and worldwide. The total number of administered vaccine doses worldwide amounted to more than 13461.3 million doses. As of January 2023, according to the data presented in the EU, the general improvement of the epidemiological situation with COVID-19 continued. Death rates fell to their lowest level in 12 months. Most countries of the world reported a similar picture. The proportion of patients with COVID-19 in hospitals and intensive\nkiv National University, 4 Svobody sq., enko@karazin.ua\n35524\ncare units in the EU was 28% of the maximum recorded levels during the pandemic. However, despite improving the epidemiological situation, COVID-19 continues to burden healthcare systems.\nIndicators of excessive mortality (deviation of mortality from the expected level) indicate that the consequences of the disease continue to affect the health of the Earth's population. General statistics show vaccinations do not create lasting immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The disease COVID-19 continues to spread.4,5\nOn May 5, 2023, WHO stated that COVID-19 is not a Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Given that the disease is already well known, it no longer ts the denition of PHEIC, even though it continues. However, this statement does not mean that the pandemic issue itself is over. WHOwill develop long-term, ongoing guidance for countries on how to deal with COVID-19 on a continuing basis.4,5\nGiven the continuous evolution of the virus, regular surveillance is currently being carried out under the auspices of WHO in the world, which consists of detecting and monitoring new variants of SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of variants that pose an increased risk to the global health system has prompted WHO to identify specic variants of the virus as those of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC) to set priorities for decision-making on whether vaccines should be updated or maintained or intensied in response to the increased presence of a particular variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Table 1).5,6\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Most RNA viruses evolve rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 variants with different phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility, severity, and immune evasion, continue to emerge rapidly. The Omicron variant discovered at the end of November 2021 marked the beginning of a new phase of the pandemic.8 It is less virulent but more transmissible than earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2.9 Even at the beginning of the discovery, the Omicron variant included three sister lines (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3).8 Unlike the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, which infected bronchial and lung cells, Omicron BA.1 preferred to replicate in the nasopharynx.10\nSARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, shows a signicant degree of antigenic evolution, which opens up a sufficient probability of repeated infections. Omicron, for example, has a much higher ability to cause reinfection than any of the previous options. Examining the current trends of Omicron variants, we have publications to expect new waves of infection every additional approximately four months of virus circulation, and going forward SARS-CoV-2 will have a more regular incidence pattern like that of seasonal inuenza, leading to an expectation of two to three times the annual burden the u.10 With the emergence of new variants of SARSCoV-2 that evade the immune response, vaccines developed against the virus may become less active.8 It means that the issue of the need to develop drugs against COVID-19 continues to be relevant. The importance of the emergence of new therapeutic drugs against coronavirus disease is evident.11"

            "text": "In the development of antiviral drugs, two different strategies are used: the inuence on the cells of the host organism (indirect methods) or the inuence directly on the virus (direct methods).\nThe indirect methods aim to target proteins of the host cell involved in the virus's life cycle. This approach has a lower probability of developing resistance but signicantly higher toxicity.19 Coronaviruses can enter host cells in three ways: receptor-mediated plasma membrane fusion, receptormediated endocytosis, or antibody-dependent viral entry. Therefore, receptor proteins on the host cell surface play a crucial role in virus recognizing and attaching host cells for both fusion and endocytosis.20 Preventing binding interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors provides example of this strategy21 and a foundation for developing new vaccines against COVID19.22 Some excellent reviews on this topic has recently appeared.17,19,20\nThe direct methods affect specically on the certain components of the virus and its life cycle. These approaches are diverse and characterized by signicant specicity and fewer side effects for the body. Viral proteins, such as main protease Mpro and papain-like protease PLpro, as well as other components of the virus at different stages of its life cycle can be the potential targets of the antiviral strategy of the direct approach. General therapeutic approaches to the treatment of viral infections, as a rule, are explicitly directed at viral components. However, such drugs are very sensitive to drug resistance due to rapid changes in the viral genome, especially for RNA viruses. When designing molecules for a pharmaceutical effect on the virus, it is necessary to take the most conservative targets: components of the virus that have fewer mutations and are highly specic for the virus. Reducing the risk of developing resistance in developing drugs focused on more than one viral component.23 This procedure requires particular approaches to the development of antiviral drugs.19\nIn this review, we will focus on research progress in designing and developing directly acting small-molecule inhibitors against COVID-19, focusing on their chemical structure, structure\u2013activity relationship, and clinical treatments.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 35500\u201335524 | 35501\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

It is a trimer with a molecular weight of about 600 kDa (Fig. 2a).29 The S protein recognizes the receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells and, through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), ensures the penetration of the virus into the host cell due to the fusion of the membranes of the virus and the host cell (Fig. 2b).12,30,31 Because of its key role in progressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, the S protein is one of the main targets for vaccine and drug developers. The S protein is the antigen of all vaccines currently on the market and elicits a strong immune response in vaccinated and infected individuals.32\nThe surface of the S protein is highly glycosylated. Such a glycan shell, combined with the exibility of the spikes of SARS-CoV-2, allows them to scan the host cell's surface and bind to the cellular receptor ACE2, possibly providing protection against neutralizing antibodies.29,32 The S protein is a trimer, in which each monomer consists of two subunits: S1 and S2.\nThe S1 subunit includes an N-terminal domain (NTD), a receptor-binding domain (RBD), and subdomains associated with the RBD and NTD. In the early stages of infection, the S protein undergoes several conformational changes: the closed initial conformation minimizes the antigenic surface of the virus, and the open conformation at the contact stage with the ACE2 receptor has a much larger available antigenic surface.33 Transitions between open and closed conformations are associated with the opening of the trimer and large movements of the domains, especially the RBD, which are straightened to engage the receptor (Fig. 2a).32,33\nThe crystal structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has recently been resolved (PDB ID: 2AJF, 6ZGE, 7BNN).34\u201336 An\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nexample of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (PDB: 7WVO) is shown in Fig. 2a.\nThe S protein is one of the most immunogenic among other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The emergence of new Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the presence of common S protein mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and Cterminal domain (CTD). Mutagenesis studies of SARS-CoV found that two proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987 stabilize the S protein in its pre-fusion form, which elicits a strong immune response.27\nThe current strategies to inactivate the S protein rely on preventing the viral spike protein from binding to the cellular receptor ACE2 (Fig. 2b).17,22 Considering the allosteric mechanism of RBD-ACE2 binding, it seems that low-molecular weight ligands are not effective in this role.20 Instead, developing efficient RBD-ACE2 blockers is promising alternative.21,37,38 In addition, several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, such as nCoV617 (PDB: 7E3O),39 B38 and H4 (PDB: 7BZ5)40 were suggested. The S protein stabilized by this double-proline mutation was used to develop mRNA vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 by Moderna and Pzer-BioNTech in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively.41,42 Since 2021, the BNT162b2/PzerBioNTech vaccine has been approved in 85 countries from North and South America and Europe, while mRNA-1273/ Moderna has been allowed in 45 countries in Europe and North America.43\nA recent study of structural changes in the S protein in the main variations of SARS-CoV-2 revealed several regularities in the evolutionary dynamics of the virus.

In the initial Wuhan variant, the S protein was in a closed form before contact with the ACE2 receptor.12 Such structure may have provided protection against neutralizing antibodies. During the virus evolution, the ability of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 to switch to an open conformation became a competitive advantage because it facilitated binding to the receptor. At the same time, antibodies targeting the open subdomain of the RBD were rare from the point of view of population immunity.\nAlpha-, Beta-, and Delta-variants of SARS-CoV-2 are variations with an open S protein structure. The Omicron variant has an already closed or partially closed conformation of the S protein and hides the RBD epitopes that are now recognized by antibodies due to mass vaccination. As a result, the previously circulating Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants are now noncompetitive and disappearing at the population level.32\nPermanent SARS-CoV-2 mutations are part of the evolutionary development of the virus, and the S protein is its dynamic part that directly responds to the environment and changes. Such responses to changes occurring in the S protein region lead to changes in the immunogenic characteristics of the virus and evasion of the virus from immunity.44\nSeveral drugs that are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion protein have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (bamlanivimab plus etesemab, cazirivimab plus imdevimab, sotrivab and bebtelovimab). However, they are not currently approved for use in the United States because it is expected that the activity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs against specic variants and subvariants of the virus may vary dramatically. The COVID-19 Treatment Guideline Panel recommends against the use of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 because the dominant subvariants of Omicron in the United States are not expected to be susceptible to these products.\nThe rapid evolution of the viral genome, focused mainly on S-protein mutations, creates problems when using the S-protein as a target for drug discovery. Therefore, the use of highly specic andmore mutation-resistant targets is necessary for the development of new drugs against SARS-CoV-2.30"

The N protein is a structurally heterogeneous multidomain RNA-binding protein with a length of 419 amino acids, which has the ability to recognize and bind RNA. The N protein is responsible for the identication and packaging of viral RNA. It binds to the genomic RNA of the virus, forming a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP).

Therefore, RdRp is believed to be an essential target for developing new antiviral drugs.52,54\u201358 The rst reported inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is Remdesivir, which was identied by a drug repurposing approach (Fig. 7). Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits RNA polymerases. Nucleoside analogues usually target viral replication, especially viral DNA or RNA polymerase, and are successfully used in clinical practice in the treatment of viral infections.58,59 In several studies, the RdRp protein was used as a target receptor for the in silico screening for new antiviral drugs.60\u201366\nThe mechanism of action of drugs belonging to the nucleoside analogues is based on structural similarity with natural nucleosides/nucleotides.67 However, they have some minor changes in the structure, which are critical for the further fate of the macromolecules in which they are included. Nucleoside analogues are incorporated into the RNA chain synthesized by the virus during replication and disrupt its further assembly.61 It leads to premature chain termination and, hence, the inhibition of virus replication.67 A nucleoside analog is dened as a nitrogenous base attached to a sugar where the nitrogenous base or sugar component is altered in such a way that the molecule is different from that found in nature. Modications of the nitrogenous bases include halogenation, addition of azido groups, and modications of the sugar component include ring opening, halogenation, methylation, hydroxylation, or dihydroxylation.68 A number of nucleoside analogues have already passed clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 and are on the market. The most successful examples are Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and Galidesivir (Fig. 7).56,69\nRemdesivir has been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the rst small molecule for an \u201cemergency use permit\u201d for the treatment of COVID-19.70 The full FDA approval was granted in October 2020. Intravenous therapy with this drug is allowed for use in both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients.70\nRemdesivir targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which creates new copies of coronavirus RNA.54,65 Remdesivir mimics the adenine nucleotide, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inserts it into the growing RNA molecule instead of adenine.71 This disrupts the normal form of the RNA chain and interrupts its synthesis. In several clinical trials, treatment of COVID-19 with remdesivir resulted in improved health.72 A side-effect is, however, that remdesivir is unstable in the blood and has a limited half-life of less than an hour in humans, requiring a continuous infusion.73\nFavipiravir was originally developed against the u. It belongs to nucleoside analogues and blocks the ability of the virus to copy its genetic material. It is metabolized in cells to favipiravir ribosyltriphosphate (favipiravir RTF) and selectively inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\nThere are evidences that favipiravir may be effective in SARSCoV-2 infection.

Like favipiravir, it was originally developed as an antiviral drug to treat inuenza. The mechanism of action is the accumulation of errors in the viral genome, when the drug is incorporated into the RNA of the virus, causes mutations in the viral RNA and thus stops the replication of the virus. In some countries, the drug has been approved for the treatment of conrmed COVID-19 infections.76\nGalidesivir (Galidisvir, BCX4430) is a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, which effects on the inhibition of RNA transcriptional activity was rst assessed in a cell-free isolated HCV RdRp assay.77 Galidesivir acts as a nonobligate RNA chain terminator56 and can be administered by both parenteral and oral routes.\nA side effect of nucleoside analogues, which limits their clinical treatments, is its ability for disrupting RNA polymerase chains, causing some risks of RNA mutagenesis impairing the human genes.78\nFinally, natural and synthetic agents, and the most promising repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp have recently been reviewed elsewhere.79,80"

Currently, Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is only 3CLpro protease inhibitor approved for medical use against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 18).132\u2013134 Nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir is available as the combination antiviral drug \u201cPaxlovid\u201d for oral use, developed by Pzer.135,136 Ritonavir is believed to have a synergistic effect on antiviral activity.137,138\nNirmatrelvir is a reversible covalent inhibitor carrying a nitrile warhead that binds to the 3C-like protease of SARS-CoV2, interrupting the viral replication cycle.90,123,139,140 It has been reported that Nirmatrelvir demonstrated distinct antiviral potency against prevalent variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Omicron141 and different human\nry activities (mM).120\n0\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 35500\u201335524 | 35511\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

            "text": "Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a 35 kDa domain of Nsp3, part of a 215 kDa multidomain protein.145 This protease cleaves the peptide bonds between Nsp1 and Nsp2, Nsp2 and Nsp3, and Nsp3 and Nsp4, releasing three proteins: Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3. In addition, PLpro is involved in counteracting the host's immune response during viral infection.146 The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease PLpro has long been recognized as a critical enzyme in the virus's life cycle.8\nIt is highly conserved, found in all coronaviruses, and has low sequence similarity with human enzymes.8 All these features make it a promising target for antiviral drugs.147 Some studies of PLpro led to the identication of many inhibitors specic to SARS-CoV PLpro.53 Moreover, both non-covalent and covalent inhibitors of PLpro have been discovered.56,148\u2013151\nThe SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is a protein composed of 315 amino acid residues, with a high content of cysteine residues (3.5%). Several high-resolution structures of free PLpro and its complex with inhibitors have become available (PDB: 7JIR, 7CMD, 6WX4, 6WUU, 6XA9, 6XAA).147,152\u2013154 The PLpro structure contains three domains: a small N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, a zinc-binding domain, and a catalytic thumb-palm domain, which is sometimes considered as two separate domains (Fig. 19). The zinc-binding domain, which includes four cysteines, coordinates the Zn2+ structural cation in the nger subdomain.53 This domain is believed to maintain the structural integrity of the whole PLpro protein.155\n35512 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 35500\u201335524\nIt should be noted that the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of PLpro is not specic and has similarities with human cellular DUBs (DUBs are proteases that cleave ubiquitin chains from protein substrates). Ubl inhibitors can affect human DUBs and lead to side effects. For example, Otubain-1 and Otubain-2 are PLpro-like cysteine proteases with the same triad of catalytic Cys/His/Asp, Asn residues.156 This issue might be one of the possible reasons why essential efforts in developing PLpro inhibitors have not yet led to the development of FDA-approved drugs for therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV-2 in humans.\nThe catalytically active site of cysteine cleavage (also called the active center) is located between the \u201cthumb\u201d \u2013 \u201cpalm\u201d domains and contains the canonical catalytic triad for cysteine proteases Cys111-His272-Asp286 (ref. 147) (Fig. 19), which recognizes the sequence of Leu-X-Gly-Gly residues found inbetween viral proteins nsp1 and nsp2, nsp2 and nsp3, and nsp3 and nsp4 (nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4) and performs their proteolysis \u2013 cleaves them aer the second Gly.147,157Of all PLpro cysteines, Cys111 is the most susceptible to oxidation, indicating its unique reactivity toward electrophiles.145 PLpro binds to viral proteins through its active site to fulll its biological role. The catalytically active site of PLpro is a conservative drug target among SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although some mutations have been identied, all most common mutations are located distal to the binding site.53,158\nAs mentioned above, from a structural point of view, PLpro seems to be a less attractive target for drug development compared to Mpro because it shares structural similarities with human DUBs. Nevertheless, the growing number of recent studies on PLpro inhibitors indicate that it remains one of the promising targets for the development of small molecule therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.145,155,159\nCovalent peptide inhibitors VIR250 and VIR251, consisting of a Gly\u2013Gly mimetic linker and a reactive electrophile, have proved to be active and selectively inhibited the PLpro of SARS-\nng domain, and catalytic thumb-palm domain.

So, HCV drugs that acting against PLpro synergized with the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir (Fig. 7) to inhibit virus replication, increasing remdesivir's antiviral activity as much as 10-fold.163\nIt has been shown that some human ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase-2 (USP2) inhibitors, such as thiopurine analogs, were capable of inhibiting PLpro proteases.

            "text": "The development of antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID19 continues to be relevant because of the risk of the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 mutated strains, reducing the effectiveness of existing vaccines. This review provides an overview of recent efforts in researching and developing coronavirus-related therapeutic agents. It includes an overview of coronavirus morphology, life cycle, and key proteins, focusing on antiviral strategies involving small molecule covalent and non-covalent inhibitors. The functional importance of Mpro and PLpro in the viral life cycle and the lack of close homologs in humans identify these proteases as an ideal target for screening of new inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Active sites of Mpro are highly conservative for all coronaviruses. The review summarizes the drug-repurposing effort, focused primarily on inhibitors currently known to be effective against key cysteine-like proteases. In particular, Mpro and PLpro proteases of SARSCOV-2 were overviewed as therapeutic targets and their functional signicance in the life cycle of the coronavirus was justied. Moreover, this report summarizes critical small molecule compounds discovered during the last three years, suitable for inhibiting several key coronavirus proteins.\nThe review outlines long-term drug development goals with a particular focus on a design strategy for dual-acting inhibitors that can inhibit both PLpro and Mpro proteases. It is believed that the combined therapy against both Mpro and PLpro inhibitors allows one to prevent the problem of drug resistance due to mutations in the viral genome.\nLooking at the current scenario for the discovery of dualtargeting inhibitors, we can conclude that comparing pharmacophore models of Mpro and PLpro proteases may allow the identication of a set of spatial and electronic features, which are crucial for their interaction with biological targets. The combined pharmacophore model should include the pharmacophore features of both Mpro and PLpro models. The use of various selection criteria (stopping rule) makes it possible to determine the points of the best and worst regression model to identify an array of optimal options for the pharmacophore model for dual-acting inhibitors.\nAuthor contributions\nLarysa V.
