1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of cordycepin and other bioactive compounds in the spent substrate extract.** The study found that cordycepin was the main antimicrobial active component in the extract. However, it is possible that other bioactive compounds in the extract may also contribute to its antimicrobial activity. Future research could investigate the synergistic effects of cordycepin and other bioactive compounds in the extract to determine if they can enhance the antimicrobial activity of the extract.


2. **Explore the potential of the spent substrate extract for use in the development of new antifungal drugs.** The study found that the spent substrate extract had a strong inhibitory effect on Malassezia, a fungus that can cause dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Future research could investigate the potential of the extract for use in the development of new antifungal drugs to treat these conditions.


3. **Evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the spent substrate extract in vivo.** The study found that the spent substrate extract had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro. Future research could evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the extract in vivo to determine if it can protect against oxidative stress and inflammation in animal models.


4. **Investigate the potential of the spent substrate extract for use in the development of new skincare products.** The study found that the spent substrate extract had antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. These properties suggest that the extract may be useful for the development of new skincare products to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, inflammation, and microorganisms.


5. **Explore the potential of the spent substrate extract for use in the development of new food products.** The study found that the spent substrate extract contained a variety of bioactive compounds, including cordycepin, polysaccharides, and nucleosides. These compounds have been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. Future research could investigate the potential of the spent substrate extract for use in the development of new food products that can promote health and well-being.
