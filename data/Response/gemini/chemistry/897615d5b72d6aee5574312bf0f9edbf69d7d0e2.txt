1. **Investigate the effects of capsomer charge on the assembly behavior of deformable capsomers.** The paper briefly discusses the effects of capsomer charge on assembly behavior, but a more detailed study could provide valuable insights into the role of electrostatics in virus self-assembly.
2. **Explore the effects of capsomer deformability on the assembly of more complex virus structures.** The paper focuses on the assembly of T = 1 icosahedral capsids, but it would be interesting to see how deformability affects the assembly of more complex structures, such as T = 3 or T = 4 icosahedral capsids or non-icosahedral capsids.
3. **Develop a coarse-grained model of capsomers that includes both deformability and flexibility.** The paper's model of deformable capsomers does not include flexibility, which could be an important factor in virus self-assembly. A more realistic model would include both deformability and flexibility.
4. **Use the coarse-grained model to study the assembly of virus capsids in the presence of other molecules, such as DNA or RNA.** The paper's model does not include any other molecules besides capsomers, but in reality, virus capsids are often assembled in the presence of other molecules, such as DNA or RNA. A more realistic model would include these other molecules.
5. **Use the coarse-grained model to design new virus-like particles for use in drug delivery or other applications.** The paper's model could be used to design new virus-like particles with specific properties, such as the ability to target specific cells or to deliver specific drugs. These particles could have applications in drug delivery, gene therapy, or other areas of medicine.
