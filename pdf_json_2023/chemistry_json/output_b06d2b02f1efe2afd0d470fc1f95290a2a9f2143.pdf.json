    "abstractText": "A series of ten new hydrazide\u2013hydrazone derivatives bearing a pyrrole ring were synthesized and structurally elucidated through appropriate spectral characteristics. The target hydrazones were assessed for radical scavenging activity through 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2\u2032azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) tests, with ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2-(2(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)hydrazine-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (7d) and ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(3-(2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene) hydra zine-yl)-3oxopropyl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (8d) highlighted as the best radical scavengers from the series. Additional density functional theory (DFT) studies have indicated that the best radical scavenging ligands in the newly synthesized molecules are stable, do not decompose into elements, are less polarizable, and with a hard nature. The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) revealed that both compounds possess good electron donation capacities. Overall, 7d and 8d can readily scavenge free radicals in biological systems via the donation of hydrogen atoms and single electron transfer. The performed in vitro assessment of the compound\u2019s protective activity on the H2O2-induced oxidative stress model on human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y determined 7d as the most perspective representative with the lowest cellular toxicity and the highest protection.",

A gradual decline in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms due to the generation of ROS during aging leads to increases in oxidative stress. Therefore, aging, various genetic mutations, the influence of the environment, and the associated increase in oxidative stress are a prerequisite for the development of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and many others [2]. Accordingly, the discovery of novel active substances with antioxidant potential is the basis of many programs for providing effective neuroprotection in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases [3]. A lot of market drugs containing pyrrole ring show different pharmacological activities, such as antipsychotics [4], antidepressants [5], anticonvulsants [6], anti-inflammatories [7],\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16091198 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 2 of 20\nand many others. There is increased interest in pyrroles and pyrrole derivatives exhibiting proven antioxidant effects [8,9]. Many heterocyclic hydrazones have shown antioxidant and neuroprotective activity, too [10]. For example, Boulebd et al. [11] successfully synthesized a series of new phenolic hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives and tested them for radical scavenging activity using DPPH and ABTS methods. The effects were compared with the action of ascorbic acid and Trolox, compounds with proven antioxidant activity. It was found that the synthesized new derivatives exhibited antioxidant activity comparable to those of ascorbic acid and Trolox [11]. In another study [12], twelve heterocyclic compounds bearing hydrazone functional groups were evaluated for antioxidant activity using DPPH, ABTS, and DMSO alkaline assays. The results showed that these heterocyclic compounds are potent antiradical agents [12]. In addition, a preliminary study performed by Tzankova et al. [13] identified the promising radical scavenging potential of pyrrole-based hydrazones, as determined through DPPH and ABTS assays, which pointed our attention toward the synthesis of analogous representatives in an attempt to enrich the variety of molecules. In the current study, the initial hydrazides were synthesized in our laboratory, as previously explained in detail by Bijev et al. [14] for hydrazide 7 and Georgieva et al.

All the new derivatives were obtained according to that presented in the Materials and Methods section procedures.\nThe synthesized pyrrole hydrazones are stable at room temperature for long periods of time. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by melting points, TLC characteristics, IR, and 1H-NMR spectral data, followed by MS data. The results from the spectral analysis confirmed that the new compounds are consistent with the expected structure. The corresponding experimental IR, 1H-NMR, and LC-MS spectra of the target derivatives are supplied as Supplementary Materials. The purity of the obtained compounds was proven by corresponding elemental analyses. The IR data determine the presence of new signals at 3245 cm\u22121 for the valence asymmetric (\u03bdas) vibrations for the amide NH group in the molecule of the new hydrazones and a band at 1666 cm\u22121 (Amide I) and 1533 cm\u22121 for deformational (\u03b4) vibrations of the amide NH group (Amide II). In addition, the appearance of a band at around 810 cm\u22121 determines the presence of p-substituted phenyl residue. The ester group (COOC2H5) in the third position in the central pyrrole ring is pointed by the appearance of a band at around 1693\u20131698 cm\u22121. A confirmation of the structural elucidation may be seen in the relevant 1H NMR spectra, where the corresponding groups are available at 7.86 ppm for the CH=N group and at 11.38 ppm for the CONH group, respectively. The obtained values from the experimental spectral data are consistent with the theoretical ones. The corresponding IDs, melting points, TLC characteristics, MS data, and yields are given in Table 2.

Thus, Koopaei presents some data on the interaction of carbohydrazides with carbonyl compounds in an ethanol medium with hydrochloric acid as the catalyst at 100 \u25e6C. Applying these conditions, it took 20\u201330 min to complete the reaction [20,21]. The obtained products were isolated and recrystallized. These conditions did not change either the yield or the time of the condensation. Thus, in the current work, we conducted the synthesis entirely in glacial acetic acid media.

Both techniques are based on spectrophotometric measurement of the quenching of stable colored radicals (ABTS\u2022+ or DPPH), which, in turn, allows evaluation of the radical scavenging ability of antioxidants even in complex mixtures [22].\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 10 of 20\n3.2.1. DPPH Radical Scavenging Assay\nOne of the most common assays for the evaluation of antioxidant effects is the DPPH test. Its frequent applications are mainly due to its relative inexpensiveness [23]. The scavenging activity in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay is attributed to the hydrogen-donating ability of antioxidants with a following decrease in the absorbance at 517 nm. The most probable mechanisms of the DPPH\u00b7assay are based on hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) [24], single electron transfer (SET) [25], or mixed mode [26]. The following reaction schemes are related to these mechanisms:\nDPPH (violet at 515 nm) + ArOH\u2192 DPPHH (colorless) + ArO\u00b7HAT (1)\nDPPH (violet at 515 nm) + ArOH\u2192 DPPH\u2212 (colorless) + ArO\u00b7+ SET (2)\nas suggested in [27]. This allowed us to apply this method in order to evaluate the possible radical scavenging effects of the newly synthesized pyrrole-based hydrazones. The obtained results for the target hydrazones are presented in Figure 3.\n3.2.2. ABTS Radical Scavenging Assay In the ABTS\u2022+ radical scavenging assay (an electron-transfer-based assay), the 2,2\u2032- azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical cation (ABTS\u2022+), which has a dark blue color, is reduced by an antioxidant into colorless ABTS, which can be measured spectrophotometrically at 734 nm [28]. A literary-based comparative analysis suggested two possible mechanisms of radical scavenging reactions related to the ABTS assay: formation of coupling adducts with ABTS\u2022+\u2014reaction considered as more characteristic for antioxidants of phenolic nature and oxidation without coupling. In addition, the data suggested the possibility for further oxidative degradation of the obtained coupling adducts, leading to hydrazindyilidenelike and/or imine-like adducts with 3-ethyl-2-oxo-1,3-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate and 3-ethyl-2-imino-1,3-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonate as marker compounds, respectively [29]. Considering the presence of a phenyl residue in the structure of the new pyrrole-based hydrazones, it was of interest to compare the possible radical scavenging activity of the target compounds when determined through both the most common in vitro antioxidant assays (Figures 3 and 4). The results from our evaluations demonstrated that when compared to the DPPH test, the ABTS assay revealed significantly better antioxidant capacities for the title compounds. The most prominent antioxidant was 8d, with 89% scavenging activity, while 7d showed 83%. Moreover, the hydrazide\u2013hydrazones condensed with 4-dimethylamino benzaldehyde and 7a and 8a demonstrated moderate ABTS scavenging capacities of 22% and 48%, respectively. The drastic differences between the two assays could be related to the ability of the ABTS test to examine both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds, as well as to test bulky structures [30]. However, the application of the DPPH assay is still used by numerous research groups to produce significant and comparable antioxidant results [31]. In general, the best radical scavenging effect of compounds 7d and 8d is quite expected due to the presence of a free p-hydroxyl group in the phenyl part of the structure. The appearance of weak radical scavenging properties in the ABTS assay for compounds 7a and 8a is probably due to the free electron pair in the N-atom at the p-dimethylamino fragment of the phenyl residue. In addition, a negligible effect is observed for 7b, containing an electron-withdrawing halogen Cl. The presence of o-methoxy groups in the phenyl residue is related to the lack of radical scavenging effects in 7e and 8e, probably due to the less likely possibility of these groups creating intermolecular hydrogen bonds. It should also be mentioned that, in general, the shorter series 7a\u2013e is related to better radical scavenging activity in comparison to the one methylene longer series 8a\u2013e. This may be due to additional conformational changes leading to the hindrance of the possibility of hydrogen atom transfer and/or electron transfer ability of the active functional groups.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 11 of 20"

            "text": "Several mechanisms for free-radical scavenging action of phenyl-containing molecules are proposed, where it is reported that phenolic O\u2013H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), adiabatic ionization potential (IP), proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE), proton affinity (PA), and electron-transfer enthalpy (ETE) are important factors used to evaluate the preferred free-radical scavenging pathways of such structures thermodynamically [32]. In an attempt to clarify these mechanisms, some theoretical approaches are applied, with density functional theory (DFT) being most helpful in the calculation of these physicochemical descriptors [33]. The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals and the global reactivity descriptors were calculated with the B3LYP hybrid functional considering recent findings [32]. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO values provide information about the energy distribution and the energetic behavior of the 7d and 8d. The comparatively high negative value of HOMO emphasizes the high ability of both compounds to donate electrons to empty molecular orbital energy. Moreover, the negative magnitude of EHOMO and ELUMO establishes the stability of the compounds [34]. The energy gap of the FMOs (EHOMO\u2013ELUMO) corresponds to the chemical reactivity and the kinetic stability. The calculated frontier molecular energy gaps are 0.1449 a.u and 0.1506 a.u for 7d and 8d, respectively. The large gap accounts for hard, unreactive, and less polarizable molecules. The value of chemical softness (S) and hardness (\u03b7) identifies whether the compounds are reactive and can donate electrons. These descriptors are directly correlated with molecular stability and chemical reactivity. When compared, 7d possesses slightly lower chemical hardness, which corresponds to lower stability. The calculated value of softness revealed that 8d is more favorable in the charge\u2013transfer mechanism. The negative value of the chemical potential of both ligands (\u22120.1288 and \u22120.1223) establishes good stabilities and resistance to sudden decomposition into their elements. The calculated electrophilicity index values (0.1145 and 0.0992 Ha), which are related to chemical potential and hardness, are indicative of the nucleophilicity power [35]. The DFT studies have indicated that the best radical scavenging ligands (7d and 8d) in the newly synthesized molecules are stable, which do not decompose into elements, are less polarizable, and with hard nature. The energy of HOMO revealed that both compounds possess good electron donation capacities. To examine the most probable mechanism of antioxidant activity of 7d and 8d, two processes were observed: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (SET). The bond dissociation energies (BDE) characterize the viability of hydrogen donation to the free radical. It is considered one of the most important descriptors in the process of determining the antioxidant effects [36]. Thus, the BDE was used as the best reliable thermodynamic parameter describing the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. Because this route involves the H atom transferring from a hydroxyl group of an antioxidant compound to the free radical, the weakest O\u2013H bond with the lowest BDE is expected to be abstracted easier, revealing its higher antiradical (antioxidant) activity. Therefore, a computational calculation of the BDEs of available \u2212OH groups in 7d and 8d will benefit in characterizing the theoretical antioxidant mechanism of the compounds. The activity of the \u2212OH groups in both active ligands and the formation of stable radicals was conducted by calculating the dissociation energies. In addition, apart from the HAT mechanism, another possible pathway for antioxidant molecules is single electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT). In this route, an electron is transferred from the antioxidant to the free radical, leading to radical cation formation, which subsequently deprotonates. Hence, adiabatic ionization proton (IP) and PDE are the most important parameters in describing the feasibility of the mechanism. In general, lower IPs are more subject to ionization and easier in electron-transfer rate between free radicals and antioxidants [33]. SET is related to the conceptual DFT parameters, mainly the IP energies [37]. This order reveals that compounds 7d and 8d are the most active\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 12 of 20\nantioxidants, with all the other calculated IPs being larger than the reference compound Trolox, suggesting their lower activity than Trolox. The computationally calculated BDEs values of all possible dissociation sites in 7d and 8d revealed that radical formation occurs at O31, followed by C7 and N21. A formation of possible intramolecular stabilization forces could conclude the result of strong N-H bond dissociation in the hydrazide moiety. The O\u2212H bond is the weakest one in both 7d and 8d, which describes the potential HAT mechanism in the exerted antioxidant activity. The IPs energies are responsible for the electron donation abilities of the title ligands. The former values of both compounds were higher when compared to the BDEs. Moreover, the relatively low IP energies of the pyrrole-based ligands [38] imply the substantial contribution of the SET mechanism in the antioxidant capacities. Overall, the DFT calculations demonstrated that 7d and 8d possess similar values of BDEs and IPs, which provides a good theoretical explanation for the experimental, radical scavenging assays."

            "text": "3.4.1. Effects of the Newly Synthesized Derivatives 7a\u2013e and 8a\u2013e on SH-SY5Y Cell Viability\nToxicity evaluation of newly synthetized substances in different in vitro models is an important issue in the drug development process. In the current study, we selected the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y as an appropriate model for in vitro neurotoxicity evaluation due to its frequent use in experimental neuroscience [39]. This cell line is also an appropriate model for mimicking various neurodegenerative disorders since its cells are able to convert to numerous types of functional neurons by the introduction of specific compounds. In addition, the SH-SY5Y cells possess tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase activities because of their sympathetic adrenergic ganglia origin [39], thus making it appropriate for evaluation of dopamine and serotonin modulations in neurodegeneration. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the newly synthesized N-pyrrolyl hydrazone derivatives 7a\u2013e and 8a\u2013e on the cellular viability of the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and calculated the corresponding IC50 values (Table 5). The results indicated three compounds with low toxicity; among them, compound 7c may be considered non-toxic with effects comparable to the ones of melatonin. Interestingly, the results showed that the prolongation of the methylene bridge between the central pyrrole ring and the azomethine fragment of the structure with one carbon atom is related to a slight increase in cellular toxicity. The obtained IC50 values showed that the overall cytotoxicity of compounds from series 8a\u2013e is slightly higher compared to series 7a\u2013e. Particularly, the toxicity of derivative 8d is 1.7 times higher than the one of its monomethyl analogue 7d. Based on their promising safety profile, the compounds 7c, 7d, and 8e were chosen for the further antioxidative protection assay in vitro.\n3.4.2. Effects of the Newly Synthesized Derivatives 7a\u2013e and 8a\u2013e in a Model of H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress In Vitro\nOxidative stress plays a key role in the damage to the central nervous system and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases [40]. When an imbalance between the production of free radicals and detoxification occurs, the high production of ROS can overcome the body\u2019s antioxidant defenses, leading to harmful conditions such as oxidative stress and damage to cellular structures and functions. In addition, free radical overproduction is often considered to be involved in the acute damage of the central nervous system and is strictly related to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. There are a number of facts that determine the free radical overproduction as a direct cause of immature cultured cortical neurons apoptosis [41], induction of DNA damage [42], and necrotic cell death [43], among others [44]. H2O2 is one of the most important ROS generated through oxidative stress. It causes oxidative damage in different cell structures such as nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane lipids; therefore, it is commonly used as an in vitro model for inducing oxidative cell\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 13 of 20\ndamage [45]. The main mechanism of induction of oxidative stress relates to the production of reactive hydroxyl radicals and the formation of Fenton\u2019s reaction, which interacts directly with proteins, lipids, and DNA. The less cytotoxic compounds 7c, 7d, and 8e were tested for antioxidant protection on the H2O2-induced oxidative stress model in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. As expected, H2O2-treatment (1 mM, 15 min) induced a significant decrease in SH-SY5Y cell viability. Our results demonstrated that the pre-treatment with compounds 7c, 7d, and 8e significantly increased the SH-SY5Y cell survival compared to H2O2- treatment. Both melatonin and all three test compounds show dose-dependent protective effects. Compared to the reference compound melatonin, at all the applied concentrations between 1 and 20 \u00b5M, compounds 7c and 7d both exert stronger protective effects, and 8e\u2019s effect is lower than melatonin\u2019s. Noteworthy, despite the stronger radical scavenging activity of 7d compared to 7c, shown by both the DPPH and ABTS assay, both compounds cause similar in vitro protective effects on peroxide-damaged SH-SY5Y cells, which may indicate that in the cells, the compounds have pleiotropic modes of antioxidant action. The overall results from the performed in vitro assessment of the radical scavenging activity and antioxidative protective effects on neuronal SH-SY5Y cells of the newly synthesized N-pyrrolyl hydrazones determined the ethyl 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2-(2-(4-hydroxy3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)hydrazine-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-2-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (7d) as the most perspective structure with lowest cytotoxicity, highest radical scavenging activity and best antioxidative protection on H2O2-induced oxidative stress model."

            "text": "Some limitations of the applied assays are related to the specificity of the radical scavenging evaluations used, such as the fact that DPPH and ABTS are not physiological radicals; thus, they are not similar to peroxyl-radicals or other oxygen-based radicals. This makes the test an indirect method based on the reduction of persistent radicals. Thus, some discrepancies may be observed since light, oxygen, and pH have an influence on the final absorbance. In this relation, we plan to add some additional cellular evaluations on the effect of the newly obtained substances on cell-defined oxidative mechanisms, which will add to the performed cell protective experiments on H2O2-induced oxidative stress applied here. These evaluations include 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH)-, and Fe2+ascorbate-induced oxidative stress assays on cellular and sub-cellular levels, which will be published in a following study."

[46]. Briefly, a single concentration of 1 mg/mL for each synthesized compound in methanol was obtained. Subsequent addition of 1 mL of the methanol solution of DPPH (1 mmol/L) was performed. The reaction mixtures were incubated in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Three measurements were carried out for each sample; 6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) was applied as a standard. The percentage inhibition of the tested samples was calculated by the following Formula (3):\nDPPHscavenging activity = Abscontrol \u2212 Abssample/Abscontrol \u00d7 100% (3)\nwhere Abscontrol is the absorbance of the DPPH radical in methanol, and Abssample is the absorbance of the DPPH radical solution mixed with the sample.\n4.3.2. ABTS Radical Scavenging Assay\nThe ABTS radical tests were measured according to a modified method of Arnao et al. [47]. The test solutions were dissolved in methanol (1 mg/mL) at ambient temperature. The radical cation of ABTS (ABTS+\u2022) was created by mixing 7 mmol/L solution of ABTS and 2.4 mmol/L solution of potassium persulphate, which were set to react for 14 h in the dark at room temperature. The working solutions consisted of 2 mL of the stock solution diluted in 50 mL of methanol with an absorbance of 0.294 \u00b1 0.05 units at 734 nm. Then, 1 mL of the ABTS working solution was allowed to react with the title compounds for 10 min, with a subsequent absorbance determination. The inhibition percentages were evaluated by applying the same formula as the DPPH assay (4).\nABTSscavenging activity = Abscontrol \u2212 Abssample/Abscontrol \u00d7 100% (4)\nwhere Abscontrol is the absorbance of the ABTS radical in methanol, and Abssample is the absorbance of the ABTS radical solution mixed with the sample."

The initial geometries for the DFT calculations were achieved after a conformational search with 2500 iterations and OPLS4 force field. Subsequently, full geometry optimizations of the best conformations of compounds 7d and 8d with Becke\u2019s three-parameter hybrid exchange\u2013correlation functional (B3LYP) and 6-311++G (d,p) basis set in the gas phase\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 1198 17 of 20\nwere performed. It was found that out of 11 functions and 14 basis sets, the most optimal combination in terms of both accuracy and resource usage for bond dissociation energies calculations is M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) [49]. The frontier molecular orbitals and the global reactivity descriptors were calculated at the same level of theory. The bond dissociation energies were obtained with M06\u20132X and 6\u2013311G basis set considering a recent report [49].\n4.5. In Vitro Pharmacological Evaluations 4.5.1. Cell Line\nHuman neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was purchased from European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK). SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated in an RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). The cell line was incubated at 37 \u25e6C with 5% of CO2, and the culture\u2019s medium was replaced with a time interval of 2\u20133 days.\n4.5.2. Cell Viability Assay The SH-SY5Y cells were plated for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C on 96-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well to confluence. After 24 h, the cells were treated with the compounds (1\u2013500 \u00b5M). MTT assay was performed to measure the metabolic activity in living cells. The mitochondria succinate dehydrogenase system of living cells metabolized yellow-colored, water-soluble, tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to a purple insoluble formazan crystal. The cells were incubated with the test solutions for 24 h, the MTT solution (10 mg/mL in PBS) was then added to each well, and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 3 h. Thereafter, the MTT solution was carefully aspirated, and the obtained formazan crystals were dissolved by the addition of 100 mL DMSO. The cell viability was determined by measuring the optical density \u2212570\u2013690 nm in a multiplate reader Synergy 2 (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Highland Park, Winooski, VT, USA) [50].\n4.5.3. H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress Model in SH-SY5Y Cells\nFor the H2O2-induced oxidative stress model, SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3.5 \u00d7 104/well in 100 \u00b5L for 24 h. Afterwards, the cell medium was aspirated, and the cells were treated with different concentrations of tested compounds (1, 10, 20 \u00b5M) for 90 min; then, the SH-SY5Y cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were exposed to the oxidative stress (H2O2 1 mM in PBS, 15 min). The contents of all wells were changed with culture medium. After 24 h, the amount of attached viable cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Negative controls (cells without hydrogen peroxide treatment) were considered as 100% protection, and hydrogen-peroxide-treated cells as 0% protection.\n4.5.4. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis of data has been carried out on GraphPad Prism 6 Software. All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 8). Comparisons between groups have been performed by applying one-way ANOVA with Dunnet\u2019s multiple comparisons post-test. We performed statistical analyses on the data with the aim of validating the significance of the observed differences. Differences between groups were considered significant for p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001."
