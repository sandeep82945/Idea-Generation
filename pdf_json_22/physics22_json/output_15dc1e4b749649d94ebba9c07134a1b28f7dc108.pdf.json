Such is their value that a source catalogue is a standard product f most imaging X-ray telescopes, e.g. ROSAT (White, Giommi & ngelini 1994 ; Voges et al. 1999 ; Boller et al. 2016 ), XMM\u2013Newton Saxton et al. 2008 ; Watson et al. 2009 ; Rosen et al. 2016 ; Traulsen t al. 2019 ), Chandra (Evans et al. 2010 ), and the Neil Gehrels Swift bservatory (Puccetti et al. 2011 ; D\u2019Elia et al. 2013 ; Evans et al. 014 , 2020b ). Some of these (e.g. Chandra and the XMM pointed atalogues) are narrow-field but deep; others [the ROSAT all-sky urv e y (RASS), the XMM slew surv e y, and the much-anticipated ROSITA (Predehl et al. 2021 ) catalogues] are all-sky but with less ensitivity.\nThe compilation of Swift X-ray telescope ( Swift -XRT) observaions lies between these two e xtremes, co v ering o v er 12 per cent of he sky, with typically more sensitivity than the all-sk y surv e ys: in he 2SXPS catalogue (Evans et al. 2020b ), we reported a median 0.3\u2013 0 keV source flux of 4.7 \u00d7 10 \u221214 erg cm \u22122 s \u22121 , not much abo v e he value from 3 XMM -DR8 (2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221214 erg cm \u22122 s \u22121 , 0.2\u201312 keV).\nE-mail: pae9@leicester.ac.uk 1\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Socie Commons Attribution License ( https://cr eativecommons.or g/licenses/by/4.0/), whi\ndditionally, Swift typically observes a given object multiple times, iving a powerful insight into the variability of the X-ray sky. This ombination of sensitivity, sky area, and variability information is ikely to remain unique until the multiyear eROSITA catalogues are ublished. Ho we ver, there is a drawback to typical X-ray catalogues: they re al w ays out of date. 1 Due to the time it takes to process the ata, compile the results, create a data base and/or interface for atalogue access, and document everything, the newest data are ften at least a year old by the time the catalogue is released nd the observatory has collected more data in the meantime. For any purposes, this does not matter, but with the recent growth of ime-domain and multimessenger astronomy, having an up-to-date atalogue is increasingly important. For example, when observing new gravitational wav e ev ent, Swift re gularly finds new X-ray ources, but to reliably determine which (if any) is related to the riggering event requires prior knowledge of that sky location either o identify the source as a known object or to determine whether it s abo v e historical upper limits (Klingler et al. 2019 ).\nAdditionally, transients can be found serendipitously in X-rays, .g. the fast X-ray transients found in Chandra data (e.g. Jonker t al. 2013 ; Bauer et al. 2017 ; Quirola-V \u0301asquez et al. 2022 ).

Further, the variability time-scales on hich such transients can be studied are limited either to the (hours o days) time-scale of the disco v ery observation (e.g. the fast Xay transients or nuclear quasi-periodic eruptions; Miniutti et al. 019 ; Giustini, Miniutti & Saxton 2020 ) or potentially to much onger time-scales on which follow-up can be carried out (e.g. tarling et al. 2011 ; Strotjohann et al. 2016 ). In contrast, low-latency nnouncement of transients allows rapid, multiwavelength followp to probe the nature of the transient object, and enables ongoing bservations that can probe the source\u2019s behaviour on time-scales f days to weeks/months. The scientific value of such low-latency nnouncement and response is well demonstrated by the case of N2008D. This supernova occurred in the same galaxy as another upernova (SN2007uy) that was being regularly observed by Swift , nd its sudden appearance in the X-rays was spotted by Soderberg t al. ( 2008 ). This rapid disco v ery enabled targeted observations of hat pro v ed to be the first X-ray detection of the shock breakout rom a supernova. Swift- XRT is an excellent tool for searching for new, serendipitous\n-ray transients. Its combination of good ef fecti ve area and low ackground, combined with Swift \u2019s unique observing strategy and he rapid availability of its data, allows us to look for transients in ear real time, with sensitivity to much fainter transient events than rom typical wide-field detectors such as the RXTE All Sky Monitor Levine et al. 1996 ) or Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (Matsuoka t al. 2009 ).\nIn this work, we present the \u2018Living\u2019 Swift- XRT Point Source LSXPS) catalogue and real-time transient detector. Software develped and running at the UK Swift Science Data Centre (UKSSDC) t the University of Leicester is e x ecuted each time new Swift- XRT ata are received. Those data are searched for new transients, and dded to the LSXPS catalogue, meaning it is kept up to date in nearly eal time. The provision of the real-time catalogue is essential to the ransient search: a reference image is needed to determine whether source just detected is already known in X-rays, and if not, what pper limit can be placed on its historical flux. Because Swift often eobserves locations on the sky (and a single XRT snapshot is usually ore sensitive than the RASS or XMM Slew Surv e y observations), t is commonly the case that the best reference image to use is a revious Swift data set, which is now al w ays available in LSXPS.\nDATA FLOW, F RO M Swift TO LSXPS\nn order to understand the \u2018living\u2019 nature of LSXPS and the latencies ssociated with transient detection, it is necessary to briefly introduce he structure and delivery of Swift data. A key and novel feature of wift \u2019s observing strategy is that it is al w ays observing 2 ; when a target oes into Earth eclipse, Swift immediately slews to the next target in ts observing plan. Due to its low-Earth orbit, the longest continuous bserving window is \u223c 2700 s and for operational reasons these are sually no longer than 1800 s. This means that Swift both observes any targets during a day and that the same target may be observed ultiple times on different orbits, with observations of other targets aking place in between. These individual pointings of a given target\nMore accurately, nearly al w ays: it does not observe while passing through he Southern Atlantic Anomaly or slewing; due to its rapid slew speed, the atter is not a significant factor.\nt 4\n5\nn b i d\nre referred to as snapshots , and (ordinarily) 3 all snapshots of a given arget within a single UT day are collected together on the ground into single observation : the basic data unit used for archiving and data ccess. Each observation is identified by its unique 11-digit obsID.\nSwift typically has 8\u201312 ground-station contacts per day, and again, unlike most missions) the downlinked data are made available apidly 4 via the quick-look sites in the USA, UK, and Italy. These ata are not necessarily \u2018complete\u2019: not all snapshots in a given bservation may have occurred by the time of the downlink or not ll observed data may have been downlinked during the pass. With ach subsequent ground-station pass, observations may be updated nd the data on the quick-look site replaced with a revised (more omplete) version; to track this, metadata indicates how many times he observation has been processed. Eventually, each observation will e marked as \u2018complete\u2019 by the Swift Data Center (SDC), normally \u20137 d after the data were collected. The quick-look sites will label he data as \u2018FINAL FOR ARCHIVE\u2019, and shortly thereafter these ata are mo v ed from the quick-look area to the archive. A simplified pictoral representation of this is given in Fig. 1 . he coloured boxes on the top row represent consecutive pointings, round station passes are shown with the state of the quick-look site fter each pass.\n.1 Adding data to LSXPS\nuick-look XRT data are by definition incomplete, and can also occaionally be \u2018incorrect\u2019, in the sense that the incomplete housekeeping ata can result in the pipeline processing inadequately filtering the ata. For this reason, observations are not added to the actual LSXPS atalogue until they are marked as \u2018complete\u2019 by the SDC. Analysis f these incomplete observations is, however, extremely important or transient detection \u2013 not just for the obvious reason of finding ransients as early as possible, but also to provide the most complete ossible set of reference images for future searches. 5\nFor this reason, observations are analysed each time data are eceived by the UKSSDC quick-look site, as shown in Fig. 1 . The eceipt of quick-look data triggers the LSXPS source detection, and he results are stored in a cache area that is not made publicly vailable. Transient checks (Section 4 ) are immediately carried out or each detected object and the XRT team are notified of any transient andidates, but none of the sources found in the observation, nor the bservation itself, are added to the public catalogue (although the bserv ation is av ailable to the upper-limit server, Section 6 ). The ransient checks for subsequent observations can make of use these ached data. When a revised version of an observation is received n the UK quick-look site, it is analysed and the cached results for he observation are replaced with those from this new analysis. In rder to track this evolving situation, for LSXPS we index data not y the ObsID, but by a new property, the DatasetID. This is simply n incremental integer number starting from 1, and each new version f an observation is given a new DatasetID, so \u2018Obs 1 v1\u2019 and \u2018Obs 1\nMNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\nhere may be multiple observations in 1 d. Typically within about 2 h of the downlink. F or e xample, imagine Swift observ es the field of a new GRB and finds no ew serendipitous transient. The GRB is re-observed the following day \u2013 efore the first observation is marked as complete. If X-ray sources are found n this second observation, the analysis of the first observation is vital to etermine whether any of these sources are new transients.\nM\nFigure 1.

Occasionally, either due to a human error or an inaccurate le w, two observ ations with the same targetID have significantly if ferent pointings; if observ ations with the same targetID are more han 6 arcmin offset from each other then within LSXPS we define ew targetIDs for each of these pointings, with observations being ssigned to the targets as appropriate.\nNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\nDatasetIDs are set simply by the order in which data are processed; thus, two ifferent versions of the same observation will not normally have consecutive atasetIDs.\nD\n7\np\nAs with the previous SXPS catalogues, as well as analysing ndi vidual observ ations, we also create stack ed ima g es , where all bservations of the same portion of the sky are combined to maximize he exposure. 7 A stacked image is defined as a specific set of v erlapping targets (or a single target, with multiple observations), nd the population of stacked images is created such as to produce he minimum number of stacks while ensuring that every observation nd ev ery o v erlap between observations is included in at least one tack. As in the previous catalogues, stacked images are assigned f ak e bsIDs, incremental numbers beginning with 10 10 , and the term data et is a generic term co v ering individual observations and stacked mages.\nIn the previous catalogues, stacked images were statically defined, ut this is clearly not possible for a living catalogue: not only are ew stacks being constantly added, but also the existing stacks can be odified. This can happen in tw o w ays. First, a ne w observ ation may e taken of a target in a stack. In this case, the LSXPS processing oes not change the \u2018ObsID\u2019 of the stack, but does assign it a new atasetID (how many times this stack has been analysed is also\nWe slightly increased the maximum size of a single stacked image to 2700 ixels (106 arcmin) to a side for LSXPS.\nr o t c a s t t c b o s a i\n2\nS t a w t a f ( s t s c i n a a s o s\na \u2018 fi i w t d l a c t\n3\nT s h r w\n8\nt v\nTable 1.

Secondly, a new arget may be observed which overlaps an existing stack. In this ase, the definitions of the stacks are updated. It is impossible to say priori what the outcome of this will be. In the simplest case, a new tack is defined which is the same as an old stack but with the new arget added; ho we ver, the ef fect may be that the addition of the new arget causes a stack to grow beyond the 2700-pixel limit in which ase multiple new stacks may be defined, or the new target may ridge a gap between two existing targets and so be able to merge all f their data into a single (new) stack. In either case, stacks that are uperseded are marked as such, and are not analysed when new data re received. The handling of superseded stacks is discussed further n Section 3.3 .\n.2.1 Analysing stacks\ntacks can take much longer to analyse than single observations \u2013 he runtime scales approximately with the number of snapshots \u2013 nd in the most extreme cases stacked image analysis can take many eeks to run and its temporary disc usage can near a terabyte. It is hus impractical to simply run stacked analyses whene ver ne w data re received, as is done for observations. Further, there is less need or this: as a general rule, each new observation of a stack adds only a ever-decreasing) fractional increase in exposure time, and we do not earch stacks for transients (Section 4 ) \u2013 their primary function for ransients being the provision of historical upper limits. Therefore, tacked image processing is instead managed by a CRON job. This hecks how many stacked image analyses are in progress, and if it s abo v e some threshold 8 it will terminate without submitting an y ew jobs. Otherwise, it identifies n observations (where n is again tunable parameter) which were marked as complete at least 24 h go and have not yet been subjected to stacked analysis, finds all tacks that these observations contribute to, and triggers the analysis f those stacks. This analysis will include all observations in the tack which are marked as complete.\nLong-running, high disc-usage processes are still an issue for this pproach, since they can fill up all of the available stack-processing slots\u2019, causing the CRON job to exit without scheduling any new elds for days or even weeks. To a v oid this, every time a stacked mage is analysed the runtime is recorded in a data base. Stacks hich took more than 24 h to run (or which supersede a stack which ook more than 24 h) are not handled by the routine CRON job just escribed, but are instead flagged in the data base, and analysed at a ower cadence (loosely connected to the runtime) in a separate queue, s resources allow. By definition, these slow-running fields already ontain a lot of data, therefore the incremental changes are small and he impact of this low-cadence update is minimal.\nC ATA L O G U E C O N S T RU C T I O N\nhe basic processing of a data set for LSXPS remains almost the ame as in 2SXPS (Evans et al. 2020b ) and is not described in detail ere: a brief o v ervie w is gi ven in Appendix A and the interested eader is encouraged to read the 2SXPS paper for full details; all we ill do here is to restate the four energy bands used in LSXPS:\nBoth this threshold and the frequency with which the CRON job runs are unable parameters, allowing us to change things as our compute capactiy aries.\n9\ni o c\n(i) Total : 0.3\u201310 keV (ii) Soft : 0.3\u20131 keV (iii) Medium : 1\u20132 keV (iv) Hard : 2\u201310 keV\nand reproduce details of the source classification system. Sources re allocated a detection flag based on their statistical properties, hese can have values of Good , Reasonable , and Poor (in the data ase tables, these are numerical values of 0, 1, 2, respectively). he thresholds for these parameters were set such that the fraction f spurious sources in a given sample of objects is 0.003, 0.01, nd 0.1, if that sample includes Good , Good , and Reasonable or ll sources, respecti vely; indi vidually the classifications correspond oughly to 3 \u03c3 , 2 \u03c3 , and 1 \u03c3 significance. The spurious source rate ill be considerably higher in the presence of artefacts such as stray ight, or an extended/diffuse source. For this reason, objects that re affected by such things (identified either automatically or by the anual screening, Section 3.1 ) have extra warning flags set; on the ebsite this is shown as descriptive text; in the data base these flags re bitwise values in the detection flag, as shown in Table 1 . Data sets ikewise have flags assigned to them to warn if there is a potential ssue affecting the data set as it is possible (but unlikely) that these ssues could alter the spurious detection fraction even among objects n that field with none of their warning flags set. This flag is also a inary flag, detailed in Table 2 . There is one small but important extension to the 2SXPS algorithm or LSXPS for indi vidual observ ations: the search for new transients, hich is described in Section 4 . LSXPS consists of all XRT data with at least 100 s of Photon\nounting (PC) mode exposure remaining after the standard XRTIPELINE processing at the UKSSDC, and after the removal of times ffected by bright Earth or unreliable pointing (Appendix A). These ata are split into snapshots, only snapshots with at least 50 s of xposure are accepted. 9 All XRT data meeting these criteria were\nMNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\nThis can result in LSXPS data sets with only 50 s of exposure, for example f the original 100 s of usable data was spread o v er multiple snapshots, only ne of which exceeded 50 s in duration. This was true of the previous SXPS atalogues but has not been explicitly stated before.\nM\nr a d T e t d t a u a w a\n2 r t u t a c d t t c\na\ne o\n3\nI s a b t\ns X t s c s e\n1\nv p w u 1\n1\nr w t\nn s s p a w m m m s L i w a a a s l c d E i s n f b\nm T i a p w c a t c i t b m t l s d fl\na c t c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 Janua\neprocessed with HEASOFT v6.29, and the XRT CALDB v20210915 10 nd then the catalogue creation softw are w as run on all historical ata (we did not copy the results from the earlier catalogues). his processing \u2018caught up\u2019 with the archive data towards the nd of 2022 March, and after a series of short \u2018catch-up\u2019 runs, he \u2018live\u2019 processing software to handle new quick-look data as escribed abo v e was enabled on 2022 April 1. 11 The analysis of he stacked images built from historical data was also enabled t this point, with the queue of images to process automatically pdated by the LSXPS processing as new data were received nd so new stacks defined. Once the stacked image processing as up to date, 12 the CRON job described in Section 2.2.1 was cti v ated. While the source detection algorithm is almost unchanged from SXPS, the aggregation of the results to form the final catalogue equired significant modification for LSXPS. The method by which he various detections are rationalized to a unique source list is nchanged (see section 3 of Evans et al. 2020b ), but for 1/2SXPS his step was done once, after all data sets had been processed nd the list of detected objects was final. For the dynamic LSXPS atalogue this is a continuous process, and takes place when the ata set is added to the already-existing catalogue. For observations his is done when the data are marked as complete; for stacks his step is carried out immediately after the data set processing is ompleted.\nThere are four steps involved in adding a data set to LSXPS, which re:\n(i) Manual screening of the field \u2020 . (ii) Creating a new entry in the data sets table. (iii) Incorporating the objects detected in the data set into LSXPS. (iv) Handling older versions of a stacked image \u2020 .\nItems marked with \u2020 may not take place for all fields. With the xception of item (ii) (which is just a data base operation), these perations are described in the following sections.\n.1 Manual screening of fields\nn order to make the quality of LSXPS as high as possible, the analysis oftware identifies data sets in which the results may be unreliable nd flags these for human inspection, which must be completed efore the data set can enter the catalogue. There are two criteria that rigger this flagging.\nThe first of these relates to stray light and is not applicable to tacked images. X-rays from a source \u223c 30\u201380 arcmin from the RT boresight (and so out of the field of view), can be diverted on o the XRT detector via a single reflection off the hyperbolic mirror urface; if the source is bright enought this can cause a pattern of oncentric rings to appear on the XRT detector, which can give rise to purious detections. We developed a technique to identify and fit this mission for 2SXPS (see Evans et al. 2020b , Appendix A), but this is\nNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n0 At the time of writing, all LSXPS data use these software and CALDB ersions; ho we ver, they will doubtless be updated again in the future at which oint only new data in LSXPS will use the newer software and calibration: e have no plans to periodically rebuild LSXPS from scratch following such pdates. 1 I did consider delaying by 1 d... 2 Or almost up to date. Various technical challenges were encountered elating to certain stacks with very long ( > 100 h) runtimes, almost all of hich co v er the Galactic centre. Analysis of these images was deferred until he backlog was cleared, and is now \u2013 slowly \u2013 catching up.\nfi L L s\n3\nW s d\nry 2024\not infallible, especially if there are real X-ray sources in or near the tray light. Such errors are immediately obvious to the human eye, o any field for which the automated system deemed stray light to be resent is marked for human checking. Once this data set is marked s \u2018final\u2019, the XRT team are notified and directed to a web interface hich allows them to compare the image with the fitted background odel (which includes the stray light), and to either accept the model, ark the stray light as not being present (i.e. a spurious fit), or ark it as badly fitted and provide a better input position for the ource of stray light. In the first case, the data set is accepted into SXPS. In the latter two cases, the data set is reanalysed (reusing ts existing DatasetID, as the underlying data have not changed), i.e. ith stray light modelling disabled or with the new input parameters s appropriate. As soon as this reanalysis is complete, the field is gain marked for screening. In the vast majority of cases, it is then ccepted into the catalogue. In a small number of cases, the catalogue oftware is not able to produce an adequate model for the stray ight. In this case, the XRT team will define an artefact (see below) o v ering the parts of the image affected by stray light, causing all etections therein to be flagged. As described in Appendix A of vans et al. ( 2020b ), stray light is not fully fitted to stacked images; nstead the results of the fits to the observations making up the tacked image are taken and applied to the stacks, with only the ormalization allowed to vary. For this reason, if the stray light fitting or a stack is poor, this must be handled by the creation of artefacts, as elow. The second reason for human verification of a data set is if edian intersource distance in the data set is less than 80 arcsec. his can simply indicate a full or crowded field, but it can also ndicate problems such as badly or unfitted stray light, instrumental rtefacts such as residual contamination by bright Earth or hot ixels/columns/rows in the detector, or an area of diffuse emission hich is not handled by our point-source detection system and so auses spurious detections. Such fields are flagged and the XRT team gain notified and directed to a website where they can investigate he image. If there is evidence of a problem, they will define a ircular or elliptical region, or a set of regions, and all of the objects nside these and in this specific data set have a warning flag applied o them. If the \u2018problem\u2019 is astrophysical in origin (as opposed to eing of instrumental origin), e.g. an extended source, then the team ember will mark these artefacts for propagation, which will mean hat they are automatically applied to all future observations of these ocation on the sky. This helps to reduce the number of fields needing creening, since fields are only marked for inspection if the median istance between sources that have not already had their warning ag set is below 80 arcsec. For data sets corresponding to observations in the 2SXPS catlogue, the results of the human screening of those data in that atalogue were automatically applied where possible. That is, if he automatic stray light model closely corresponded to that acepted for 2SXPS, it was accepted for LSXPS. Artefacts identied in 2SXPS were automatically applied to their corresponding SXPS fields, and those fields were therefore only flagged for SXPS screening if the unflagged sources has a low median eparation.\n.2 Adding sources to LSXPS\nhen a data set is added to LSXPS, the objects detected in that data et are compared with the sources already in LSXPS. An object is eemed to match a source in LSXPS if their positions \u2013 including\na p\np t\ns p f\nt L e a t b c o c n i b t c i a\na t o d e w a w p m t a r n a d a e L i d i s r s\n1\nS w 1\no\n3\nF a I t a s r c c \u03c7 d\nH\nH\nw t\nw c l 2 A s w p t o a s p t m a c ( e (\ns t o\n3\nW i n v s i t i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nstrometric uncertainty \u2013 agree at the 5 \u03c3 level. 13 There are three otential results for each new object:\n(i) The object has no counterpart in LSXPS. (ii) The object is an additional detection of a source in LSXPS. (iii) The object matches an LSXPS source, but impro v es the osition of the LSXPS source (i.e. its position uncertainty is smaller han that currently in LSXPS).\nThe first two are straightforward: in case (i) the object is a new ource which is added to LSXPS; in case (ii) the products and average roperties of the existing source are updated to include the results rom the new data set.\nCase (iii) is more complex as there are several possible permutaions. In the simplest scenario, the new position is identical to the SXPS position, 14 but the uncertainty is smaller. Here, the catalogue ntry is updated to use this smaller error and the processing continues s per case (ii), abo v e. If, ho we ver, the ne w position is different from he LSXPS position, the situation is more complex as the association etween individual (per-data set) detections and LSXPS sources may hange. F or e xample, if there are sev eral X-ray sources close together n the sk y, then mo ving one of these sources 1 arcsec to the East ould result in some detections previously assumed to be this source ow being better associated with a different object; or indeed the nverse. On the other hand, if a source position is revised it may now e the case that some of the detections, which had been attributed o that source, are not consistent with the new position, nor are they onsistent with that of any existing source; i.e. the original \u2018source\u2019 s now found to be two distinct sources, which of course each need record in LSXPS.\nIn order to identify and handle all of these cases, when a data set is dded to the catalogue we select every LSXPS source that lies within he field of view of the new data set, and every individual detection f those sources; then we find any other sources within 5 \u03c3 of those etections, and all detection of these; and so on recursively until no xtra objects are found. This is analogous to picking up a paperclip ith a magnet and so also retrieving all connected paperclips until gap (in this case, a 5 \u03c3 gap) is found, and essentially ensures that e collect every single detection in any data set and band that could otentially be affected by the new data set. We then apply the source atching algorithm from 2SXPS (Evans et al. 2020b , section 3.7) o this subset of detections. This yields the list of unique sources nd which detections are associated with each, and the catalogue is evised accordingly. If a source mo v es such that its name changes, a ew entry is created in the catalogue and the old entry deleted, but record of this is kept. Records are also kept of which sources are econvolved into multiple sources, and which individual detections re reassigned from one source to another. This book-keeping is xtremely important for the usability of a dynamic catalogue such as SXPS: if someone studies a particular source, perhaps announcing t to collaborators or the wider community, and then the source isappears without a trace this would be very unhelpful! The user nterface (Section 6 ) ensures that if a user requests a \u2018superseded\u2019 ource they will either be redirected to the new entry which has eplaced this source, or if necessary presented with a list of the ources into which it has been deconvolved.\n3 More correctly, at the probability associated with a Gaussian 5 \u03c3 confidence. ince the radial position errors should follow a Rayleigh distribution, this level as determined based on Rayleigh, not Gaussian, statistics. 4 We define \u2018identical\u2019 as meaning \u2018does not change the IAU-format name f the object\u2019, where the IAU format is \u2018LSXPS JHHMMSS.S \u00b1ddmmss\u2019.\nf i i fl\n1\no\n.2.1 Source products and updates\nor each source, a series of products and measurements are created, nd these are the same as in 2SXPS (see Evans et al. 2020b , section 4). n short, these comprise mean count-rates in each energy band, two ime-averaged hardness ratios and light curves of all energy bands nd hardness ratios, with one bin per observation, and one bin per napshot. Unlike some catalogues, these light curves and countates are fully corrected for effects such as pile-up, vignetting, dead olumns on the detector etc. and so can be used with no further orections needed. A measurement of variability using the Pearson\u2019s 2 is calculated for each time series. The two hardness ratios are efined as"

Spectral and flux information is also provided for each source,\nith up to three methods employed per source, depending on the haracteristics. Two spectral models are used: an absorbed power aw, and an absorbed optically thin plasma model (APEC; Smith et al. 001 ); absorption was calculated using the TBABS model (Wilms, llen & McCray 2000 ). Flux conversions and (where appropriate) pectral properties were derived using XSPEC . For every source, fluxes ere deduced using fixed spectral components: a power law with hoton index 1.7 and an APEC with a plasma temperature of 1 keV; he absorption column was set to the Galactic value along the line f sight to the source, from Willingale et al. ( 2013 ). These values re available for every source but are the least accurate since they imply assume the spectral shape, regardless of the data. Where ossible, the spectral parameters and flux are also inferred from he hardness ratios, using look-up tables linking (HR1, HR2) to the odel parameters \u2013 for full details see Evans et al. ( 2020b ) section 4.1 nd Evans et al. ( 2014 ) section 4.2. For sources with at least 50 net ounts in the total band, and a detection flag of Good or Reasonable Section 5 ) with no stray light or diffuse source warning set, we also xtract and fit a spectrum. This is done using the tools of Evans et al. 2009 ), and we fit both absorbed power-law and APEC models.\nAs LSXPS is a living catalogue, these source properties are not tatic. Every time a new data set is added to the catalogue, all sources hat lie within the field of view of that data set (regardless of whether r not they were detected in it) have their products updated.\n.3 Handling older versions of a stacked image\nhen a new version of a stacked image is added to the catalogue, t is preferable to remo v e the old version, rather than keeping large umbers of obsolete data sets. If every source detected in the old ersion is also detected either by the new version, or by another data et, then there is no reason to keep the old version of the stacked mage. Its data are remo v ed from disc and from most of the data base ables. 15 It can happen, ho we ver, that a source is detected in a stacked mage, but not in the updated version of that stack \u2013 especially for aint and variable or transient sources. If the old version of a stacked mage contains the only detection of a source in LSXPS, that stacked mage will not be remo v ed from the catalogue. Instead, the source is agged internally as an \u2018orphan\u2019, and the data set is marked as being\nMNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n5 A record of all such deleted data sets is still maintained but this is not part f the public catalogue.\nM\na n r s a i o\n3\nT d w r t r \u2018 c w \u2018 s a t a 3\nw t c t f c v d i t m I a g r p s e s a U\n4 C\nW l n i o\n1\n1\ni c\nc a\ni\ns e\nw n L e a t t p h\n4\nW c i c o r o L\n4\nW S b b p c b\ni l c b c b p a b\n18 Excluding sources found in an earlier version of the observation being analysed.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nn \u2018obsolete stack\u2019. Should an orphan source ever be detected in a ew data set (single observation or stacked image), its orphan status is emo v ed; should this happen to all orphans in an obsolete stack, that tacked image is then remo v ed. The same process is followed when new stacked image is analysed which supersedes a stack currently n the catalogue; that is, the new stack has a different definition (and bsID), but contains all of the targets in an old stack (see Section 2.2 ).\n.4 Static catalogue releases and data reprocessing\nhe introduction of a living catalogue, with near real-time updates, oes not remo v e the need for \u2018static\u2019 catalogues, for projects hich require a stable and unchanging reference such as where the eproducibility of a project is crucial. It is therefore our intention o issue frozen releases of the catalogue (3SXPS, 4SXPS, etc.) at egular intervals, likely every 1 or 2 yr. These will essentially be snapshots\u2019 of LSXPS, but will be full decoupled from LSXPS, so ompletely insulated from updates. Because of the time-scales on hich stacked image analysis runs, it may not be possible to fully synchronize\u2019 the contents of these releases; that is, to ensure that the tacks in a static release contain all of the observations in the release, nd only those observations. We do not see this as a major issue, as he key point of these releases is that their contents can be quantified nd are unchanging, and this will be ensured. The first static release, SXPS, is envisioned for 2023. Before building LSXPS, we reprocessed all historical XRT data\nith what was, at the time, the most recent HEASOFT and XRT calibraion releases (Section 3 ). Ho we v er, these are re gularly updated 16 and alibration in particular is, by its nature, al w ays retrospective. While he UKSSDC does periodically reprocess the entire XRT archive ollowing such updates, we are not planning to rebuild the LSXPS atalogue following such processing. The CALDB and HEASOFT ersions used in the live LSXPS analysis will be updated, but the ata already in the catalogue will not be revised. The reason for this s that such a revision would essentially involve completely rerunning he LSXPS analysis: a process that takes around 6 months and\nonopolises compute time, and so clearly cannot be done routinely! t is not anticipated that any software or calibration revisions will have major impact on the catalogue contents. 17 Changes in the XRT ain could potentially have a (very) small impact on the hardness atios and spectral properties of sources; ho we ver, the catalogue web ages and the API (Section 6 ) are fully integrated with the UKSSDC oftware to provide high-quality analysis of point sources (Evans t al. 2009 ), making it easy to generate custom spectral products for ources of interest, making use of the latest software and calibration, nd using the archive data locally reprocessed with these at the KSSDC.\nT RANSIENT DETECTION A N D L ASSIFICATION\ne define a serendipitous transient as an object which is uncataogued in X-rays, has a flux abo v e historical upper limits and was ot the target of the Swift observation. In order to minimize the delay n detecting and announcing these transients, we do not wait for an bservation to be marked as complete before carrying out transient\nNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n6 Indeed, HEASOFT 6.30 was released during the processing. 7 In the unlikely event that something changes that is impactful, we will nvestigate how best to respond, and in such cases a complete rebuild of the atalogue cannot be ruled out.\n1\n2\n2\nL 2\nr\nhecks, but rather carry out these checks immediately after each nalysis of an observation.\nThe transient checks applied to each detected object can be broken nto the following steps:\n(i) determine whether the object is a known X-ray source (ii) determine whether it is abo v e historical upper limits (iii) carry out basic analysis of the object (iv) classification of the object\nand these steps are described in the following sections. At each tep the process may terminate; e.g. if the source is a known X-ray mitter, then steps (ii) onwards are not carried out.\nDuring the bulk processing of historical data, the transient checks ere carried out, but notifications of new transients (see below) were ot produced and the candidate transients were not added to the main SXPS transients data base but stored separately. This is because the vents are, by definition, old and so not pressing, and may have been nnounced or published already. The primary purpose of enabling ransient checking and analysis during the historical process was o test and debug the software and tune the automated classification rocess (Section 4.4 ); ho we ver, we may release the data base of these istorical transients or some analysis thereof at a future date.\n.1 Is the object an known X-ray source?\ne deem an object to be uncatalogued in X-rays, if it does not orrespond to a source already in LSXPS (or in the cache) 18 , and s inconsistent at the 5 \u03c3 level with any object in the X-ray Master atalogue provided by HEASARC , 19 CSC 2.0 (Evans et al. 2020a ) r the live XRT GRB catalogue (Evans et al. 2009 ). 20 This set of eference catalogues may be updated in future (e.g. with the addition f eROSITA catalogues), an up-to-date list will be maintained on the SXPS website.\n.2 Comparison with historical upper limits\ne compare the flux at disco v ery with upper limits obtained from wift itself and also XMM\u2013Newton and ROSAT . 21 XMM has a similar and-pass to Swift- XRT and we can use the total (0.3\u201310 keV) LSXPS and for this analysis. ROSAT , ho we ver, has a much softer bandass, 0.1\u20132.4 keV, thus for comparison with ROSAT we use the ombination of the soft and medium (0.3\u20131, 1\u20132 keV) LSXPS energy ands, hereafter the \u2018SM\u2019 band. We create light curves with one bin per snapshot (i.e. Swift orbit) n the total, soft and medium LSXPS energy bands, summing the atter two to give the SM-band light curve. The peak per-snapshot ount-rate is then identified from these light curves, defined as the in with the highest 1 \u03c3 lower limit. 22 We also calculate the mean ount-rate of the object across the observation in the total and SM ands; if this has a higher 1 \u03c3 lower limit this is instead taken as the eak rate. To enable us to compare upper limits in the next step, we lso calculate the ratio, R , of the peak count rates in the total and SM ands.\n9 https:// heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ W3Browse/all/xray.html 0 https:// www.swift.ac.uk/ xrt live cat 1 This list may also be revised in future, especially to include eROSITA ; the SXPS website will maintain an up-to-date list. 2 This definition is robust against data points with very large errors; a count ate of 0.5 \u00b1 0.05 is deemed higher than a rate of 2 \u00b1 1.9.\nd R H o a e R p t P a w o a l l w f H t 1\nc fl s a t s w r a ( s b i\n4\nF d o i t h p k i s u t m\n2\n2\nf i c 2\n2\nc l\na a t X b\nw e c l h\n4\nT o t a h m\nf\nr n i ( t\ns o T c p I t\nm c c o t c t t\ne a d t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January\n3 \u03c3 upper limits are then obtained from LSXPS (including cached ata sets and stacked images, see Section 6 ), XMM\u2013Newton and OSAT ; the latter two instruments\u2019 limits are obtained using the ILIGT service 23 (K \u0308onig et al. 2022 ; Saxton et al. 2022 ). Of these, nly the RASS is an all-sky survey thus not all upper limits are al w ays vailable. Upper limits are created in count-rate units using the native nergy band of the instrument (0.2\u201312 keV for XMM , 0.2\u20132 keV for OSAT , and 0.3\u201310 keV for LSXPS); for XMM limits from both ointed and slew data are requested. These limits are then converted o XRT count rates, using fixed conversion factors determined using IMMS and assuming a power-law spectrum with spectral index 1.7 nd an absorbing column of 10 21 cm \u22122 ; for XMM the conversions ere calculated for each instrument and filter and so the appropriate ne is selected. XMM upper limits are converted to total-band rates, nd ROSAT limits to SM band rates. The deepest of these upper imits is then taken as the reference value to use. Since the ROSAT imit is in a different energy band from the others, for the comparison e multiply it by the ratio R defined abo v e which helps to account or the spectral shape of the object, which is unknown at this point. aving determined the deepest upper limit, the peak count-rate from he appropriate band is compared with this limit, and if it is at least \u03c3 abo v e it, the object is flagged as a candidate transient. 24\nDuring the historical processing, we found that all transient andidates that had a detection flag of Poor or one of the warning ags set (see Appendix A) were spurious detections, and indeed a ignificant fraction of alerts came from such objects (this is expected: real source with a Poor detection is unlikely to be bright enough o pass the abo v e tests, and while transients occurring within a tray light ring or known extended object are not impossible, they ill be rare, whereas spurious detections with high apparent count ates are much more common). Accordingly, such candidates are utomatically classified as Spurious (Section 4.4 ) and the analysis Section 4.3 ) is not carried out and the XRT team is not alerted to uch ev ents. The y are still posted to the team-only website discussed elow, and they can be \u2018upgraded\u2019 if a team member studying the mage believes them to be real, but they are not routinely analysed.\n.3 Basic transient analysis\nor each candidate transient identified by the previous steps, custom ata products are built using the tools that power the UKSSDC n-demand analysis services 25 (Evans et al. 2009 ). A light curve s built using all available XRT data, including those taken before he transient disco v ery (if available); this can result in evidence of istorical emission from the source even though it has not been reviously detected, since forced photometry at the location of a nown source is more sensitive than a blind search. 26 This is binned n three ways: with fixed numbers of counts per bin, with one bin per napshot, and with one bin per observation. A spectrum is also created sing only the disco v ery observation; this is partly to maximize he S/N, and also to determine the spectral state specifically at the oment of outburst. This spectrum is automatically fitted with an\n3 xmmuls.esac.esa.int/ hiligt/ 4 Note that the ROSAT limit extrapolated to the 0.3\u201310 keV band is only used or comparing with the upper limits to determine which is deepest. If ROSAT s selected by this test, it is the upper limit in the SM band that is used, and ompared with the peak SM-band count rate. 5 https:// www.swift.ac.uk/ user objects 6 In each bin, if the 3 \u03c3 lower limit on the count rate is non-zero, a \u2018detection\u2019 omprising a count rate and 1 \u03c3 errors is produced; otherwise, a 3 \u03c3 upper imit is created.\no t a t t t c\n2\n2024\nbsorbed power-law model, and if the automatic fit is successful nd the reference upper limit (Section 4.2 ) is not from LSXPS, then he upper limit is revised, the conversion from XMM or ROSAT to RT being recalculated with this fitted model, using PIMMS and the est-fitting model parameters. These data products and the revised upper limit are posted to a\nebsite accessible only to the XRT-team, who are then notified by mail of the potential transient and asked to confirm its status and lassify it. This happens even if the redetermined upper limit is no onger below the peak count-rate, in case the spectral fit was poor; o we ver, the notification email does indicate if this was the case.\n.4 Transient classification\nhe final step of transient analysis requires human checks to filter ut objects which are definitely not serendipitous transients, and o further classify those which are. This step is currently semiutomated: the analysis system tries to suggest a classification, but a uman is still required to verify or change this before the transient is ade public. Objects may be deemed not to be serendipitous transients for the ollowing reasons:\n(i) Spurious detection : the \u2018transient\u2019 may be an obviously spuious detection. Many of these cases are identified automatically as oted abo v e but some may not be \u2013 for example if the X-ray \u2018source\u2019 s actually an artefact of optical loading, the automated system will usually) warn that this is possible, but will not automatically flag he source as spurious.\n(ii) Targeted transient : the object is a transient, but is not erendipitous, it is the object Swift was observing (e.g. as a targetf-opportunity observation of a transient disco v ered elsewhere). hese cases can usually be flagged automatically by the analysis ode, which uses the OBSQUERY class in the SWIFTTOOLS PYTHON ackage 27 to determine what object was the target of the observation. n cases where the target observation had a large position uncertainty, he automatic flagging is less reliable.\n(iii) It is not a transient : analysis of the historical light curve ay show a series of previous bins in which the source flux can be\nonstrained, and is consistent with that at the time of disco v ery. In this ase the source is clearly not transient, but as a result of the specifics f the current observation happens to have been blindly detected for he first time. Alternatively, the spectral fit to the transient data may ause the historical upper limit to be abo v e the peak flux; if the XRT eam member confirms that this fit is reliable, the transient nature of he source is retracted.\nThere is an additional category that is not listed abo v e, a propritary transient . This is an object that passes the above tests and is real transient, but the parent observation was part of a programme esigned to monitor a specific region to look for new transients. In his case whether the transient should be deemed \u2018serendipitous\u2019 is pen to interpretation, but it is clearly inappropriate for the Swift team o routinely and rapidly announce the primary science of someone\u2019s ppro v ed observing programme, and before they have even had time o examine the data! In these cases, the Swift team will ende v aour o contact the observation PI and encourage them to announce the ransient, and the object will not be posted to the public transients atalogue or webpage without their consent.\nMNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n7 https:// www.swift.ac.uk/ API\nM\nt g\ns o t\nc t t u a b S S a c\nw b f\nt a a a h (\nt t s fl a f\ns 4 J o a A o s w t o r f f d d s b\n2\ne\nA c h t a t\no s o t a ( t ( t f w d t t r a I s t s t t l s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nItems which are not caught by the abo v e are still not necessarily ransients, and are manually classified into one of the following roups, collectively referred to as \u2018interesting classes\u2019.\n(i) Outburst : If the light curve shows historical detections of the ource (from the forced photometry) but at a flux le vel belo w that f the new observation, the source is likely an outburst rather than a ransient.\n(ii) Low significance : The Eddington bias (Eddington 1940 ) auses objects detected close to the sensitivity limit to be preferenially recorded with count-rates significantly abo v e their true value; his can result in sources which are in reality below the historical pper limit (i.e. not transients) to be misclassified as transients. We re not able to say a priori whether a given source is affected by this ias, although Evans et al. ( 2014 , section 6.2 and fig. 10) showed that XPS sources with fewer than \u223c 30 counts are affected by this bias. ources whose peak count-rate is < 3 \u03c3 abo v e the 3 \u2212 \u03c3 upper limit nd which have fewer than 30 counts in the detection are usually lassed as low significance .\n(iii) Needs follow-up : This is somewhat of a catch-all category, here the source does not obviously fall into either category above, ut there is some doubt as to its nature and further observations are elt necessary before it can be definitively identified as a transient.\n(iv) Confirmed transient : The object is definitely a new transient.\nThe reader will immediately realize that these classifications are o a considerable degree subjective, and they should be interpreted s such. All events falling into these categories are made publicly vailable (Section 4.5 ) and the classifications are intended as a guide nd to enable filtering, rather than a definitive statement; this also elps the clear candidates to be easily identifiable from among the larger number of) low significance and outburst events.\nThe outburst category is particularly subjective, in that in reality he only phenomenological difference between an outburst and a ransient is the sensitivity of previous observations. Two identical ources, with quiescent fluxes of (say) 10 \u221214 erg s \u22121 and outburst uxes 100 times higher, could be classed one as a transient and one s an outburst, if the latter had a historical observation long enough or forced photometry to detect it in quiescence.\nSwift J051001.8 \u2212055931 presents a good case study of this ubjectivity. It was disco v ered in observation 00014892016 (version , LSXPS DatasetID: 225587) which began at 23:59 UT on 2022 uly 20. The light curve (Fig. 2 ) showed a detection in the previous bservation that had been accumulated o v er the previous 16 h, 28 nd several non-detections (grey arrows) more than 240 d earlier. t the time of the disco v ery, the LSXPS stacked image contained nly those non-detections, from which an upper limit of 0.0084 ct \u22121 was deduced (blue arrow); the count-rate at disco v ery is clearly ell abo v e the upper limit, but the automated system recommended his be classified as an outburst due to the detection in the previous bservation. As the day-old \u2018historical\u2019 detection could indicate the ise of the transient, this was instead manually classified as needs ollow-up . A Swift ToO observation was requested to investigate urther; this revealed that the source, while still detectable, had ropped below the historical upper limit and thus the \u2018transient\u2019 isco v ery was probably either a short-lived outburst or just a lowignificance fluctuation. In this case, we classified it as an outburst, ut low significance would be equally justifiable.\nNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n8 Not accumulated continuously; that observation contained 3.2 ks of xposure gathered over the 16-h interval.\na 2\nt i\ns soon as a transient is classified into one of the interesting lasses (Section 4.4 ), it is published on the public transient webpage: ttps:// www.swift.ac.uk/ LSXPS/ transients , and added to the public ransients data base (Section 5 ). At this time, no push notifications re produced, although we are discussing the recording of these ransients (or some subset thereof) in the Transient Name Server.\nIf a transient is reobserved after discovery, whether intentionally r serendipitously, its light curve is updated and also a second pectrum constructed and fitted, using all data from the disco v ery bservation onwards. Normally, these products are only updated until he disco v ery data set enters the liv e LSXPS catalogue (Section 3 ), t which point the transient will correspond to an LSXPS source and the transient page and data base will contain this link), and he source products are kept up to date in the main catalogue Section 3.2.1 ). Ho we ver, because source products are only updated o include observations that have been added to LSXPS, they lag a ew days behind real time. On occasion there may be a transient for hich follow-up observations have been requested and for which it is esirable to maintain up-to-date products in real time. In such cases, he XRT team will manually flag the transient and its products in he transient area will continue to be updated each time new data are eceiv ed. An e xample of such an ev ent is Swift J023017.0 + 283603, source that demonstrates the power of our new transient detector. t is consistent with the nucleus of a known galaxy and has a very oft X-ray spectrum, and so was initially announced as a probable idal disruption event (Evans, Campana & Page 2022 ). Had this ource only been found in later analysis, as was hitherto typical, his classification would likely have been unchallenged. Ho we ver, he prompt transient alert from our new system allowed rapid and ong-term multiwav elength monitoring, e xposing variability on timecales of weeks, challenging the initial classification of the object nd exposing its true, and much more enigmatic, nature (Evans et al. 022, in preparation). The transient data and data base tables can be accessed through he LSXPS website and SWIFTTOOLS PYTHON module as described n Section 6 .\nFigure 3.

The solid line shows the sky coverage (corrected for o v erlaps) as a cumulative function of exposure time (i.e. area with at least the exposure indicated). The histogram shows the distribution of exposure time per data set, with the individual observations shown in light blue and the stacked images in red; the different colours are each half the width of the actual bins.\n5 C\nB o s T 3\nf 7 p o 5 h c h i\ns s a\nt d w N T d 1 d\na\n6\nT h\n2\na X\nt v c F fi v c r o b\nt i a n l 2 u\nP c S S d a m i T c A s t t o c h\no t T C\n7\nW s u o i L o u d t i o\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/174/6764727 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nC ATA L O G U E C H A R AC T E R I S T I C S A N D O N T E N T S eing a dynamic catalogue, any statement of characteristics is bviously tied to the time at which they were generated: the \u2018live\u2019 tatus of the numbers given here is available on the LSXPS website. he numbers given below were obtained at 15:00 UT on 2022 August 0. The LSXPS catalogue contains 279 021 unique sources, composed rom 1.5 million blind detections across all four energy bands, or 56 769 \u2018obs sources\u2019. 29 The median 0.3\u201310 keV flux (assuming a ower-law spectrum) is 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u221214 erg cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The sky coverage f LSXPS is shown in Fig. 3 . The total unique sky coverage is 186 deg 2 ; 3503 deg 2 have at least 1 ks of exposure and \u223c 700 deg 2 ave been observed with at least 10 ks. The 2SXPS catalogue ontained data up to 2018 August 1; thus, on average LSXPS as grown by 49 sources per day and the unique sky coverage is ncreasing at 0.94 deg 2 per day. The source detection mechanism employed for LSXPS was the ame as for 2SXPS, and so only summarized here. For full details, ee Evans et al. ( 2020b ), especially sections 3.5 and 7, figs 6 and 7, nd tables 3 and 6. As for 2SXPS, we provide \u2018clean\u2019 and \u2018ultraclean\u2019 subsets of he sources and data set. Clean sources are those with a best etection flag of 0 or 1 (i.e. Good or Reasonable with no other arning bit set); OpticalLoadingW arning, StrayLightW arning, and earBrightSourceWarning all unset; and a field flag of 0 or 1 (see able 2 ). Ultraclean sources are a subset of the clean sources, with etection and field flags of 0. There are 190 902 clean sources and 70 372 ultraclean sources in LSXPS, a growth rate of 30 (26) per ay for the clean (ultraclean) classes. The actual catalogue contents are organized into six publicly vailable tables, which are described in Appendix B."

This enables rapid followp of X-ray transients too faint to trigger all-sky monitors and so pens up a new region of transient phase space for exploration. This s enabled by the unique provision of a \u2018living\u2019 source catalogue, SXPS, which is kept constantly up to date every time a new Swift bservation is marked as completed. This catalogue and associated pper limit serv er pro vide not only a reference for our transient etector, but also a valuable resource for the rapidly growing field of ime-domain and multimessenger astronomy generally, in which it s often useful to have quick access to the most up-to-date analysis f a given sky location.\nMNRAS 518, 174\u2013184 (2023)\n0 Prior to SWIFTTOOLS v3.0, this module was SWIFTTOOLS.XRT PRODS , and hile that path is still active and supported, it now simply silently wraps WIFTTOOLS.UKSSDC.XRT PRODS .
