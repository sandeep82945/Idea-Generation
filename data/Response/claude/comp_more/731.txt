 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on automatically enhancing textbooks with images from the web:

1. Develop new vision-language models that can better handle non-natural images like diagrams, graphs, and plots. The current models struggle with abstract concepts and relationships commonly depicted in these types of images.

2. Explore approaches to associate images with long textual descriptions that span multiple paragraphs. This could involve identifying key phrases or learning dense alignments between images and text.

3. Evaluate the impact of automatic image enrichment on actual student learning outcomes. A longitudinal study monitoring comprehension and retention could reveal the true pedagogical value. 

4. Expand the image retrieval to include video clips and 3D models to further increase engagement and enhance visualization of concepts. New multimodal models would need to be developed.

5. Personalize image selection and assignment based on individual students' backgrounds, prior knowledge, and interests. This could increase relevance and help address unique learning needs.
