1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Synthesize a series of metallodendrimers with different bridging ligands and/or dendritic scaffolds and evaluate their cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cell lines. This would help to identify the structural features that are essential for the antitumor activity of these compounds.


2. **Explore the mechanism of action of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Conduct mechanistic studies to determine how the metallodendrimers interact with DNA, proteins, and other cellular targets. This information could be used to design more potent and selective anticancer agents.


3. **Investigate the in vivo antitumor activity of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Evaluate the efficacy of the metallodendrimers in animal models of cancer. This would provide information on the safety and effectiveness of these compounds in a living organism.


4. **Develop targeted delivery systems for the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Design and synthesize nanocarriers that can specifically deliver the metallodendrimers to cancer cells. This could improve the therapeutic index of these compounds by reducing their systemic toxicity.


5. **Investigate the potential of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers for combination therapy:** 
Combine the metallodendrimers with other anticancer agents to see if they can work synergistically to kill cancer cells. This could lead to the development of new and more effective cancer treatments.
