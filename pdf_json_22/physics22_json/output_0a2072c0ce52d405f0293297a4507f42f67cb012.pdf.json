    "abstractText": "We study the boundary states of the archetypal three dimensional topological order, i.e. the three dimensional Z2 toric code. There are three distinct elementary types of boundary states that we will consider in this work. In the phase diagram that includes the three elementary boundaries there may exist a multi-critical point, which is captured by the so-called deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) with an \u201ceasy-axis\u201d anisotropy. Moreover, there is an emergent Z2,d symmetry that swaps two of the boundary types, and it becomes part of the global symmetry of the DQCP. The emergent Z2,d (where d represents \u201cdefect\u201d) symmetry on the boundary is originated from a type of surface defect in the bulk. We further find a gapped boundary with a surface topological order that is invariant under the emergent symmetry. Copyright W. Ji et al.

            "text": "For many physical systems, the most prominent features happen at the boundary rather than the bulk. The well-known examples of such include the topological insulators and topological superconductor, as well as their generalizations, the so-called \u201csymmetry protected topological\u201d (SPT) states [1, 2]. Although various diagnosis based on the bulk wave functions have been developed for these systems [3\u20136], most physical observables still happen at the boundary, or defects.\nBoundaries of long-range entangled topological states have also attracted much attention. [7\u201319] For example, the two-dimensional toric code topological order has two types of gapped one-dimensional boundaries, which correspond to the boundary type with condensation of anyon e and m respectively. Furthermore, at the interface between the two types of boundaries, there is a localized Majorana zero mode. In the two-dimensional toric code, there is a transformation that exchanges the e and m anyons, and hence swaps the two boundary types. One can also drive the boundary to a (1+1)D Ising critical point that is invariant under the e \u2212 m exchange symmetry. [14] The emergent symmetry acts on the boundary precisely in the manner of the Kramers-Wannier self-duality. [20,21] Similar boundary phenomena are much less studied for higher dimensional topological orders, even for some of the archetypal topological orders. It has only been recently clarified that, on the boundary of the three dimensional Z2 topological order, there can be three distinct types of gapped phases. The three phases are condensations of topological excitations with distinct properties, one of which involves a \u201ctwist\u201d of the condensation, as will be elaborated later. [22]\nIn this work, we consider the phase diagram including the three types of gapped boundaries. We find that depending on the microscopic physics, there could exist a multi-critical point among the three gapped boundaries, and this multi-critical point is captured by the deconfined quantum critical point proposed in the context of spin-1/2 quantum magnet [23,24]. Moreover, we demonstrate that there also exists an emergent Z2,d (0-form) duality symmetry which swaps two of the boundary types, and the action of the Z2,d symmetry can be implemented by \u201csweeping\u201d an invertible defect through the system.\nThe three boundary types mentioned above are representative boundaries without anyons that are only localized at the boundary. If we loosen the last constraint, more exotic gapped boundaries can exist. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a gapped boundary which preserves the emergent Z2,d symmetry. This boundary can alternatively be constructed by gauging a bulk 3D SPT state with Z2,d \u00d7 Z2 symmetry with a boundary that has topological order."

            "text": "\u2014 Gauging a short-range-entangled state The three distinct elementary types of boundaries can be constructed explicitly through two procedures. The first construction is to gauge the Z2 symmetry in a three-dimensional shortrange entangled state with a gapped boundary. This procedure turns the system into a longrange entangled topological order. In the 3D bulk, we will always start with a trivial disordered state (a paramagnet) symmetric under the Z2 symmetry. On the 2D boundary, however, we can consider three different types of short-range entangled states at the 2D boundary: (1) The ordered state that spontaneously breaks the Z2 symmetry; (2) the trivial disordered product state or a Z2 paramagnet; (3) the Z2 non-trivial symmetry protected topological state (often referred to as the \u201cLevin-Gu\u201d state [25]).\nAfter gauging the Z2 symmetry, the bulk will become a Z2 topological order, and the three different short-range entangled 2D boundary states will turn into the following three gapped boundaries:1\n(1) The \u201cHiggsed\u201d boundary, which is the descendant of the Z2 ordered short-range entangled state after gauging. At the Higgsed boundary, the point-like e anyon in the bulk condenses at the boundary, which freezes the dynamics of the Z2 gauge field at the boundary through the Higgs mechanism. The m\u2212loop excitation in the bulk cannot terminate at the Higgsed boundary as it braids nontrivially with the condensed e\u2212anyon. This scenario is the analogue of the e\u2212boundary of the 2D toric code phase.\n(2) The \u201cdeconfined\u201d boundary, which is obtained by gauging the 3D bulk with a trivial disordered Z2 paramagnet at the boundary. This boundary condition allows the m\u2212loop to terminate at the boundary, hence we can also view this phase as the analogue of the 1d m\u2212boundary of the 2D toric code. The e\u2212anyon from the bulk, and the m\u2212loop termination at the boundary will have mutual semionic statistics at the boundary. Nevertheless, the end points of the m\u2212loop which terminate on the boundary always costs energy proportional to the length of the string. Thus, there is a string tension between two terminations attached with a single m\u2212loop.\n(3) The \u201ctwisted\u201d boundary is obtained by gauging the 3D bulk with the Levin-Gu SPT at the boundary. It is known that if we gauge the two dimensional Levin-Gu state the resulting state is the double-semion topological order. Namely, the Z2 flux gets transmuted to have semionic statistics instead of bosonic statistics of the toric code. Similarly, on the twisted boundary, the m\u2212string in the bulk can also terminate at this boundary like the deconfined boundary. However, the end point of the m-string has semionic statistics.\n\u2014 Layered construction The other construction that also gives rise to the above gapped boundaries is the so-called \u201clayered construction\u201d [22,26,27], which consists of starting with stacks of Z2 toric codes, and performing condensation of composite excitations between layers. The 3D toric code can then be obtained by condensing pairs of e excitations from adjacent layers, causing the e anyon to become mobile in the third direction. On the other hand, the m anyons in each layer are confined, but a product of m anyons braids trivially with the condensate and therefore forms the m loop of the toric code.\n1Abstractly, these topological boundaries are characterized by the so-called Lagrangian algebras of the higher category that describes the topological order. Even though the development of the theory is still on-going, simple examples such as that for the Z2 topological order have been worked out.\nThe condensation near the top-most layer of the toric code determines which gapped boundary is obtained as follows\n(1) The Higgsed boundary is obtained by also condensing e in the top-most layer. This corresponds to condensing the e particle of the 3D toric code on the boundary.\n(2) The deconfined boundary is obtained by condensing only e pairs in adjacent layers, analogous to the condensation in the bulk. This allows the m loop to terminate on the boundary\n(3) The twisted boundary is obtained by replacing the 2D toric code model on the top layer with the double semion (DS) model. Then, we still let the pair of e\u2212anyons from every two adjacent layers condense. In particular, on the top two layers, the pair to condense is the bound state of the boson, usually named ss\u0304, in the DS layer and the e particle in the second (toric code) layer. This results in the m-loop of the 3D toric code terminating as a semion s. And the boson ss\u0304 can freely move into the bulk and become the Z2 charge."

            "text": "Let us give the microscopic models in exactly solvable limits corresponding to the gapped boundaries, also called \u201ctopological boundaries\u201d [22,28]. Our system is on a three dimensional lattice. The lattice is a triangulation of the cubic lattice, each cube is triangulated into six tetrahedrons, as shown on the left of Fig. 1. We consider a smooth termination of the three dimensional lattice, so that the boundary is on a two-dimensional tilted triangular lattice, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe bulk Hamiltonian is given by\nHbulk = \u2212 \u2211\nv\nAv \u2212 \u2211\n\u2206\nB\u2206 , Av = \u220f l\u220bv X l , B\u2206 = \u220f l\u2208\u2206 Zl , (1)\nsuch that all the 14 edges in Av , as well as all the 3 edges of a triangle \u2206 in B\u2206 are within the three dimensional lattice with a boundary. Then any state that is the ground state of Hbulk is a boundary state. The wavefunctions of these states are only distinct near the boundary. More precisely, one can show that for any two boundary states, their reduced density matrices in any bulk region, say a region within order 1 distance from the boundary, are identical, by virtue of the topological order.\nIn the boundary Hamiltonian Hbdry, we allow any local terms that commute with all terms in Hbulk. What terms are there? The boundary Hilbert space is not a local tensor product Hilbert space, as there are constraints if we restrict ourselves on the ground state subspace of the bulk Hamiltonian. First, note that for any triangle \u2206 on the boundary B (see the right in Fig. 1), there is a constraint\nB\u2206\u2208B = 1 , \u220f\nl\u2208Cbdry Zl = 1 , (2)\nwhere Cbdry is any non-contractible loop on the boundary.

Given these two bulk constraints, we can find three fixed-point boundary Hamiltonians: Each Hamiltonian has local terms that commute with each other, and is translation invariant. [22]\n(1) The \u201cHiggsed\u201d boundary. On this boundary, the e particles are condensed, as well as the Cheshire charge - a string where e particles are condensed. The fixed point Hamiltonian is\nH e = \u2212 \u2211\nboundary l\nZl . (4)\n(2) The \u201cdeconfined\u201d boundary. On this boundary, the m-loop is condensed. The m-loop excitation in the bulk can open up, and terminate on the boundary.

Here, our convention is that the only non-trivial element is \u03c9(g, g, g) = \u22121. And gi , i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b78 label the states on the 8 edges around a vertex v shown on the right of Fig. 1.\nOne can see that, up to additional Pauli X operators on edges pointing into the bulk, the terms in Hm are the \u201cstar terms\u201d in the two-dimensional toric code model, and the terms in H twisted m are equivalent to the \u201cstar terms\u201d in the two-dimensional double semion model [29], up to a finite-depth quantum circuit on the boundary. Nevertheless, since the \u201cplaquette terms\u201d B\u2206 = 1 for \u2206 on the boundary, are part of bulk Hamiltonian (1). Thus, the magnetic quasiparticle excitation is not present when the bulk is in the ground state. Only a single type of point-like excitations appears on the two types of deconfined boundaries, which is the Z2 electric charge.\nThe fixed-point wavefunctions of the toric code model with the three types of boundaries are condensations of surfaces, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. More precisely, on the background that Zl = 1 on all links, a closed surface \u2202 V in the bulk is created by \u220f\nv\u2208V Av; an open surface \u2202 V that lands on the boundary is also created by \u220f\nv\u2208V Av , except that for those vertices v on the boundary, Av is given in Eq. (5). For the twisted boundary, the sign of the wavefunction amplitude counts the parity of the number of open surfaces on the boundary. The wavefunctions are obtained from the fixed-point wavefunctions of the 3D short-range entangled states with three types of short-range entangled boundaries via gauging. In particular, the basis state |{gi}\u232a, with gi \u2208 {0, 1} on the site i, is mapped to |{gi j = (gi + g j) mod 2}\u232a."

            "text": "The above gapped boundaries can host surface excitations which can freely move into the bulk. However, there can be further boundaries where some surface excitations cannot move freely into the bulk. One trivial way to achieve this is to simply stack an arbitrary (2+1)D topological order onto the boundary.\nHere, we demonstrate that there are further boundaries that are beyond stacking with 2D topological orders. The construction is very similar to that of the twisted boundary: we replace the top-most toric code layer with a different topological order, and condense certain bosonic anyons. Consider the 3D toric code with the deconfined boundary. The bulk excitations are generated by an order-two particle e3D and the loop excitation m3D. Now, consider stacking on top a two-dimensional Z4 toric code which has order-four anyons generated by e2D and m2D where e 4 2D = m 4 2D = 1. If we now condense the pair e 2 2De3D near the top, the anyon e 2 2D can now move into the bulk, since it is identified with e3D. Nevertheless, e2D is still deconfined only on the boundary.\nFor the flux sector, originally m3D is allowed to terminate on the boundary. However, since e22De3D is condensed, this forces the end point of m3D to be bound with m2D in order to braid trivially with the condensate. As a result, the point particles on the boundary are reduced to the set {1, e2D, e22D, e 3 2D} \u00d7 {1, m 2 2D}, where e 2 2D can move into the bulk. We illustrate this construction in Fig. 4. Let us provide an explicit lattice realization of this boundary. We replace the qubits on the boundary of the 3D Z2 toric code with Z4 qudits and denote the generalized Pauli operators which satisfy ZX = iXZ. Because we are dealing with Z4 variables on the boundary, we need to pick an orientation of each edge Oe = \u00b11. The bulk stabilizers are as in Eq. (1), while the\nvertex stabilizers on the boundary are\nAbdryv = \u220f\nl\u2283v;l\u2208\u2202M\nXOll \u220f\nl\u2283v;l\u2208M X l . (7)\nAs for the boundary plaquettes, we define two types of plaquettes. If the plaquette has links that are completely in the boundary then we define\nBbdryp\u2225 = \u220f\nl\u2282p;l\u2208\u2202M\nZOll . (8)\nOn the other hand, if the plaquette contains links pointing into the bulk, we define\nBbdryp\u22a5 = \u220f\nl\u2282p;l\u2208\u2202M\nZ2l \u220f\nl\u2282p;l\u2208M Zl . (9)\nAs an explicit example, for a cubic lattice, the boundary stabilizers are\nAbdryv = X \u2020 X \u2020 X X X\n(10)\nBbdryp\u2225 = Z Z\nZ\u2020 Z\u2020 , B bdry p\u22a5 =\nZ2\nZ\nZ\nZ\n, Z2\nZ Z\nZ\n(11)\nLet us now check the boundary excitations. The stabilizer Abdryv can be violated by a string of Z on the direct lattice on the boundary. The eigenvalues \u00b1i corresponds to the anyon e2D and e32D on the boundary. These anyons are deconfined only on the boundary: they cannot move into the bulk. On the other hand, the anyon e22D corresponding to A bdry v = \u22121 can move into the bulk using Zl for a link l which ends on the boundary vertex v. Next we analyze the flux excitations. The loop m3D in the bulk can be excited with a membrane of X l on the dual lattice as usual. However, when the loop ends on the boundary, we must act with X so that Bbdryp\u22a5 is not excited. This causes B bdry p\u2225 to be excited with eigenvalue \u00b1i. This corresponds to the fact that the end point of the loop in the bulk is attached with m2D of the Z4 toric code. Finally, the point particle m22D can be created with Z\n2 on the dual lattice on the boundary.\nWe can also relate the above boundary to a Z2 symmetric state. That is, by ungauging both the bulk and boundary, the bulk becomes aZ2 symmetric paramagnet, while the boundary realizes a Z2 symmetry-enriched Z2 toric code, where the e anyon carries fractionalized charge of the Z2 symmetry.\nWe remark that a more general family of such boundaries can be constructed by stacking on top of the \u201cdeconfined\u201d boundary a general anyon theory described by a modular tensor category C2D that contains a Z2 boson b2D and condensing the pair b2De3D near the top. The resulting anyons on the boundary then can be described by a premodular subcategory containing all anyons that braid trivially with b2D (since all the anyons that braid are now attached to the end points of the flux loops). To obtain the above boundary by gauging, we start with a Z2 paramagnet in the bulk, and place a Z2 SET on the boundary. This SET corresponds to the G-crossed braided fusion category that results from condensing b2D with G = Z2.\nLet us further remark that from the point of view of gauging, we can also embed such 2+1D SETs in the 3+1D bulk instead of on the boundary. Upon gauging, this gives rise to a codimension one non-invertible defect of the toric code. Such non-invertible defects have an immediate relation to defect network constructions of fracton and hybrid fracton orders [30\u201334]. In particular, starting with a \u201cfoliation\u201d of 2+1D SETs and gauging the Z2 symmetry in the bulk reproduces exactly the 1-foliated hybrid fracton models."

            "text": "The three elementary types of boundaries of the 3D Z2 topological order can also be described by effective field theories. Our starting point is a generalization of the Luttinger liquid theory that describes the boundary of two-dimensional Abelian topological orders, which we reviewed in Appendix A. A family of Abelian topological orders in three spatial dimensions can be described by a topological action of the BF kind:\nSbulk = N 2\u03c0\n\u222b\nM B \u2227 dA , (12)\nwhere A and B are the dynamical one-form and two-form fields, respectively, M is the fourdimensional spacetime, and N \u2208 Z denotes the level. The physical meaning of the two-form field B is that it is the dual of the current of the charge-N matter field that couples to the oneform gauge field A: J \u223c dB. The charge-N matter field condenses and Higgses the one-form gauge field A to a ZN gauge field, i.e. the bulk becomes a ZN topological order. If the spacetime manifold M is closed, the action is invariant under the gauge transformation of A\u2192 A+ d\u03d5 for a zero-form field \u03d5 and B\u2192 B + d\u03c7, for a one-form field \u03c7.\nTo describe the boundary, we may begin with the following action:\nS0 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nd td xd y N\u2202t\u03c6 \u2202x by \u2212 \u2202y bx + V [\u03c6, b] , (13)\nwhere \u03c6 is a zero-form field, b is a one-form field, and V [\u03c6, b] are some non-universal terms. There are two types of quasi-excitations on the boundary: the point-particle excitation created by ei\u03c6 , and loop excitation ei \u222e\nC b, and they are coupled to the gauge field A and B respectively. Local excitations, which can be created by microscopic degrees of freedom locally, are at least composites of these quasi-excitations and have trivial statistics.\nNow we consider the case with N = 2, the BF theory in the bulk describes the Z2 topological order. Due to the fusion rule of the quasi-particle e\u00d7 e = 1, and that of the quasi-loop m \u00d7 m = 1,2 we know that there are at least two local excitations ei2\u03c6 and ei2 \u222e\nC b. A more 2We abuse the notation and use m to label the Z2 flux loop excitation in three-dimensional topological order as\nwell.\ngeneric action for the boundary should include the following local terms:\n\u03b4S = \u2212 \u222b d td xd y u1 cos 2\u03c6 + \u2211\nC uC cos2\n\u222e\nC b , (14)\nwhere \u2211\nC is a formal sum of all possible closed loop configurations. In the ground state, when the quasi-particle condenses on the boundary, \u2329ei\u03c6\u232a =\u0338 0, the gauge field A is \u201cfrozen\u201d due to the Higgs mechanism at the boundary. The condensation of the quasi-particle at the boundary can be caused by the Hamiltonian Eq. 4. In the Higgsed phase of A, A= d\u03c6, and the boundary action reduces to\nSbdrye = 2\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M \u03c6 \u2227 dB . (15)\nThis action, combined with the bulk action, is invariant under the zero-form gauge transformation A\u2192 A+ d\u03d5, \u03c6\u2192 \u03c6 \u2212\u03d5, and the one-form gauge transformation B\u2192 B + d\u03c7.\nIn the opposite limit, i.e. the \u201cdeconfined boundary\u201d, the boundary Hamiltonian Eq. 5 can cause the loop excitation ei \u222e\nC b to condense at the boundary, for loops C parallel with the boundary. In the condensate of the loop excitations, the two-form field B is identified with d b. Now the gapped boundary is described by the topological action,\nSbdrym = 2\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M b \u2227 dA . (16)\nThis action, combined with the bulk action, is invariant under the zero-form gauge transformation A\u2192 A+ d\u03d5, and the one-form gauge transformation B\u2192 B + d\u03c7, b\u2192 b\u2212\u03c7.\nThere is also a third choice of the boundary topological action:\nSbdrytwisted m = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M (2b \u2227 dA\u2212 A\u2227 dA) . (17)\nThis action, combined with the bulk action, is also invariant under the zero-form gauge transformation A\u2192 A+ d\u03d5, and the one-form gauge transformation B \u2192 B + d\u03c7, b \u2192 b \u2212 \u03c7. In fact, Sbdry = 12\u03c0 \u222b\n\u2202M (2b \u2227 dA\u2212 kAdA) are allowed choices with integer k for a bosonic system; nevertheless when k = 2k\u2032 with integer k\u2032, the action is equivalent to Sbdrym up to a field redefinition b \u2192 b \u2212 k\u2032A. Hence the only physically distinct boundary action is the one with k = 1.\nLet us analyze the excitations on the boundary. We start with the second boundary condition described by\nSbdrym = 2\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M (b \u2227 dA+ A\u2227 d b) . (18)\nEven though b comes from the pure gauge in the bulk B = d b, it is a dynamical U(1) gauge field on the boundary. Then comparing Eq (18) with Eq (A.1), we recognize that this action is the two-component Chern-Simons action with a K matrix which is the same as that of the 2D Z2 topological order.\nSimilarly, on the third type of boundary, the action can be rewritten as\nSbdrytwisted m = 1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M (2b \u2227 dA+ 2A\u2227 d b\u2212 2A\u2227 dA) . (19)\nThis is the topological action describing the twisted Z2 topological order. With this twisted action, the point gauge charge of A remains a deconfined bosonic excitation on the boundary. Now let us discuss the terminations of m\u2212loops on the boundary. Consider an excited state\nin the topological order, where an open m-string ends on the boundary at two points. Such excitation only exists when the m-loop is condensed on the boundary, described either by Sbdrym or Sbdry3 . The statistics of the end-point of the m\u2212loop corresponds to the charge of b, i.e. the charge vector m= (0, 1)T of the deconfined boundary theory Eq. (18) or the twisted boundary\ngiven by Eq. (19), where K = 0 2 2 0 or K = \u22122 2 2 0 respectively. Its self-statistics is given by \u03b8m = \u03c0mT K\u22121m. On the deconfined boundary, \u03b8m = 0; while on the twisted deconfined boundary, \u03b8m = \u03c0 2 , i.e. the end-points of the m\u2212loops are self-semionic."

Physically speaking, there is a \u201cgauged Levin-Gu state\u201d on the defect.3 More precisely, the defect is obtained by first embedding a codimension-1 defect containing the Levin-Gu SPT state into a three-dimensional Z2 paramagnet. Then, after gauging the Z2 symmetry, the codimension-1 defect becomes the symmetry defect of this emergent Z2 symmetry of the toric code.\nExplicitly, the unitary operator acting on a region V is,\nU(V) = \u220f\n0123\u2208V\nei \u03c0 8 1+ \u2211 i \u0338= j(\u22121) i+ j Zi j+Z01Z23 , (20)\nwhere 0, 1,2, 3 labels the four vertices of a tetrahedron, or rather a branched 3-simplex [36].

We can create the domain wall defects on two layers (orange layers in the figure) by acting with the unitary in the region between the two layers. This topological state with defects can also be prepared with a layered construction. Here, we replace two layers of toric code models with double semion models, and still condense the pair of bosonic quasi-particles from neighboring layers. In this state, the deconfined excitations are the mobile Z2 charge, as well as the Z2 flux. The Z2 flux is now a string of magnetic quasiparticles in all layers.

However, it is possible to have a boundary that preserves the Z2,d symmetry and also have deconfined point excitations.\nWe first recall that the \u201cdeconfined\u201d boundary is transformed into the \u201ctwisted\u201d boundary under the Z2,d symmetry. Specifically, the statistics of the m-loop at the end point is transmuted from a boson to a semion.

We can see this by identifying the generating excitations as follows\ne \u2243 e , s \u2243 ms\u2032 , s\u2032 \u2243 s\u2032e .

Along the line \u03b1= 1/2, the inversion of symmetry defect by \u220f\nU( ) (see Eq. (20)) becomes an extra \u201cemergent\u201d Z2,d symmetry of the boundary Hamiltonian. At large \u03bb along the line \u03b1= 1/2, this emergent Z2,d symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the system is in either the deconfined or the twisted boundary.\nThe details near the center of the phase diagram may depend on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian. [45\u201348] With proper perturbations to Hbdry, a multi-critical point where three phases meet together may be realized at the boundary of our system. A similar phase diagram was studied numerically in Ref. [48] for a 2D system with Z32 symmetry and a similar Z2,d symmetry. Note that the only difference from Eq. (33) is that the \u03bb perturbation was a next-nearest neighbor Ising interaction, which was chosen so that it respects the full Z32 symmetry. There, it was found that the three phases indeed meet at a multicritical point, which was argued to be in the same universality class as the DQCP. We expect that by explicitly breaking the Z32 symmetry down to the diagonal Z2 symmetry by a infinitesimal amount of the Hamiltonian H e, the characteristics of the phase diagram remain the same and qualitatively reproduces the phase diagram Eq. (33) without additional terms."

            "text": "In this subsection, we discuss the connection between the phase diagram Fig. 8 to the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) [23, 24]. More precisely, the DQCP corresponds to the multi-critical point in the phase diagram which includes the three short-range entangled 2D states at the boundary of the system before gauging the Z2 symmetry. Since the Z2 gauge field does not lead to singular dynamics in the infrared, we expect that the dynamics at the transitions in the phase diagram Fig. 8, especially the potential multi-critical point can still be captured by the DQCP.\nThe DQCP has a field theory description in terms of the noncompact CP1 (NCCP1) model:\nL= \u2211\n\u03b1=1,2\n|Daz\u03b1|2 + r|z\u03b1|2 + g\n\u2211\n\u03b1\n|z\u03b1|2 2 + u|z1|2|z2|2 + h z\u2020\u03c3zz . (34)\nThere are two main tuning parameters in the system, r and h, which should correspond to \u03bb and \u03b1 in the lattice model. Compared with the original DQCP, our system should also have a parameter u> 0, which makes the theory an \u201ceasy-axis\u201d DQCP in the terminology of quantum magnets. In our case, the photon phase corresponds to the ordered phase that spontaneously\nbreaks the Z2 symmetry, which eventually becomes the Higgs phase after the symmetry is gauged.\nWhen r < 0, the phase diagram in the DQCP is in the Neel order. The easy axis anisotropy favors either N z \u223c z\u2020\u03c3zz> 0 or N z < 0, respectively. Along the line h= 0, there is an apparent symmetry in the CP1 model connecting N z > 0 and N z < 0, which is just a Z2 symmetry that flips Sz in the quantum magnet context. If all the symmetries of the DQCP are onsite, the theory of DQCP can only be realized on the 2D boundary of a 3D SPT state [49]; and the Z2 symmetry that flips N z is precisely the fermionic duality transformation of the (2 + 1)D QED with N f = 2 flavors of Dirac fermions [50\u201352], which is a dual representation of the DQCP [53\u201355]. This (2+1)D QED can also be used to describe the quantum phase transition between 2D bosonic SPT states [56,57], and the fermionic duality transformation changes the level of the bosonic SPT states. Hence this Z2 symmetry that flips Sz can also be identified as the Z2,d symmetry discussed previously (Section. 3), i.e. the emergent symmetry that swaps the deconfined and twisted boundaries (which correspond to the Z2 paramagnet and Z2 SPT state respectively before gauging). If this Z2,d symmetry is an exact onsite symmetry in our system, the short-range entangled bulk should be a SPT state protected by the Z2,d\u00d7Z2 symmetry, whose topological response is given in Eq. (32). The boundary state along the line h= 0 either spontaneously breaks the Z2 symmetry (r > 0), or the Z2,d symmetry (r < 0).\nWhen r < 0, by tuning h, the phase transition between the trivial bosonic insulator and the bosonic SPT phase is expected to be first order due to the easy axis anisotropy. If we fix h > 0 (or h < 0), the mass degeneracy of the two flavors of the bosonic fields z\u03b1 is lifted. By tuning r, the transition corresponds to the condensation of one of the two flavors of z\u03b1, which is dual to a 3D XY transition, if the gauge field a\u00b5 of the CP\n1 theory is noncompact. Since the flux of the gauge field is conserved mod Z2, the 3D XY transition is reduced to a 3D Ising transition, for both h > 0 and h < 0. This is consistent with the common wisdom that the transition between the SPT and the ordered phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking is an ordinary Landau transition.\nThe DQCP was initially proposed for two dimensional spin-1/2 quantum magnets. The phases involved in the phase diagram of DQCP are all short-range entangled states. But it is also natural for two dimensional spin-1/2 quantum magnets to form topological orders, such as the chiral-semion state, or the \u03bd= 1/2 fractional quantum Hall state if we view the spin as a boson [58]. This spin liquid state can be invariant under the full SU(2) spin symmetry, hence invariant under the Z2,d symmetry that is a subgroup of the spin rotation. The DQCP is also directly connected to the chiral semion spin liquid. The O(5) nonlinear-Sigma model (NLSM) with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term at level-1 serves as the low energy effective theory of the DQCP on the square lattice [59], and this NLSM can be derived from the so-called \u201c\u03c0\u2212flux\u201d spin liquid state, which is described by a (2+ 1)D QCD with N f = 2 flavors of Dirac fermion coupled with a SU(2) gauge field. The \u03c0\u2212flux spin liquid state can be driven into the chiral semion state by turning on a mass term of the Dirac fermion spinons."

            "text": "In this work, we discussed three elementary boundary states of the 3D toric code topological order. The three elementary boundary states can be constructed intuitively as gauging the paramagnet boundary, the ordered boundary, and the Z2 SPT boundary of a trivial symmetric paramagnetic bulk with a global Z2 symmetry. These boundary states are elementary in the sense that they do not have independent anyons that are localized only at the boundary. Other topological boundary states with anyons restricted at the boundary can be constructed, and one of the topological boundary states is invariant under a Z2,d symmetry that swaps two of\nthe elementary boundaries. We also discussed a multi-critical point among the three elementary boundaries, and demonstrated its connection to the deconfined quantum critical point proposed originally in the context of 2D quantum magnets.\nThere is a natural generalization of our results to the boundary states of the 3D bulk ZN topological order, especially for N being a prime number. For a prime number N , there are N + 1 types of elementary boundaries, which again can be constructed by gauging the ZN paramagnet boundary, the ordered boundary that spontaneously breaks the ZN symmetry, and the N\u22121 nontrivial 2D SPT states (the 2D SPT states withZN symmetry has aZN classification) on the boundary of a trivial symmetric paramagnetic bulk with the ZN symmetry."

The edge can be gapped due to the backscattering if and only if quasiparticles represented by the integer vectors M= {m}, satisfy the Lagrangian group condition [8,11]:\n1. The quasiparticles in M are mutually bosonic, \u03b8mm\u20322\u03c0 =m T K\u22121m\u2032 \u2208 Z for any m,m\u2032 \u2208M.\n2. Any quasiparticle, given by an integer vector l not in M, braids non-trivially with at least one quasi-particle in M: there exists m \u2208M, \u03b8ml2\u03c0 =m T K\u22121l \u0338\u2208 Z.\nWhen the couplings Um are large, the quasiparticles in M condense, and the boundary is\ngapped. Take the Z2 topological order with KZ2 = 0 2 2 0 as an example. There are two types of Lagrangian groups: Me = {(1,0)T } and Mm = {(0,1)T }. Another example is that in the\ntwisted Z2 topological order with Ktwisted Z2 = \u22122 2 2 0 , there is only one Lagrangian group, Me = {(1, 0)T }. When the bosons in M are condensed, the boundary is gapped. More realistically, we only consider the backscattering of local excitations. Local excitations are created by eimI\u03c6I , where m= Kn and n is an integral vector.\nExample 1. the Z2 topological order Let us take the Z2 topological order as an example. Including backscattering terms of local excitations that break as most symmetry as possible,\n\u03b4S = \u2212 \u222b\nd td x (u1 cos2\u03c61 + u2 cos 2\u03c62) .

And in the other limit, |u1| \u226a |u2|,\n\u2329ei\u03c62\u232a \u0338= 0 . (A.7)\nThe anyon in the Lagrangian group Mm is condensed. When the electric charge is condensed, \u2329ei\u03c61\u232a \u0338= 0, we have an open quasi-string excitation with end points on the boundary, ei\u03c61(x1)\u2212 \u222b L12 a1\u2212i\u03c61(x2), where L12 is a path from point x1 to point x2. The gapped boundary is now described by a topological action. To derive it, we use the equation of motion in Sbulk: da1 = 0, whose solution is a1 = d\u03bb and \u03bb|bdry = \u03c61,\nSbdry, tope = 2\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M \u03c61da2 , (A.8)\nwhere \u03c61 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) is pinned to a value \u2212i log\u2329ei\u03c61\u232a. Excitations are created on the end points of ei \u222b\na2 . Since such end points cost energy, its dynamics is not captured by the topological action.\nSimilarly, when the magnetic charge is condensed, the gapped boundary is described by\nSbdry, topm = 2\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2202M \u03c62da1 .

(A.10)\nNote that only anyons in the Lagrangian group can be condensed on the boundary, hence the only compatible condensation is described by\n\u2329ei\u03c61\u232a \u0338= 0 . (A.11)\nThe other quasi-particle associated with ei\u03c62 cannot condense, since the it is not bosonic, and not part of any Lagrangian group."
