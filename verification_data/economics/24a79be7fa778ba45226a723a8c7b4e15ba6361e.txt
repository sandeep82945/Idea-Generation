The portion of the text that mentions future research direction is:

"One next step can be considered is to model heterogeneous demand as a stochastic many-to-many assignment game. For example, urban air mobility markets can be studied by breaking the trip demand into segments by trip purpose and income level to observe where vertiports should arise and which modes they can best work together with or compete against."
