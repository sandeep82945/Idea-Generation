This technique allows us to extract the complex frequencies and separation constants of the equation without the need for sophisticated numerical techniques, and with an almost immediate implementation under the PyTorch framework. We are able to compute the oscillation frequencies and damping times for arbitrary black hole spins and masses, with accuracy typically below the percentual level as compared to the accepted values in the literature. We find that PINN-computed quasi-normal modes are indistinguishable from those obtained through existing methods at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) larger than 100, making the former reliable for gravitational-wave data analysis in the mid term, before the arrival of thirdgeneration detectors like LISA or the Einstein Telescope, where SNRs of O(1000) might be achieved.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe observation of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network [1\u20134] has opened a window to study gravity in its strong field regime. In particular, some of the current detections have made possible to access the ringdown signal of the highly distorted black holes produced after the merger, opening the prospects to turn black-hole spectroscopy into an observational field (see e.g. [5\u201312]). This discipline aims to identify and characterize the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a rotating (Kerr) black hole, as those are the fingerprint of relaxing black holes after a perturbation of their spacetime geometry. In black-hole perturbation theory any type of perturbation (scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational) can be mapped into wave equations with a short range potential. QNMs are solutions of those equations that correspond to damped oscillating modes, i.e. modes which are outgoing at infinity and ingoing at the black hole horizon. The properties of these modes are well understood (see [13\u201315] for details).\nA generic excitation of an isolated black hole leads to a prompt emission of gravitational waves, followed by a distinctive exponentially decaying QNM ringing. Such a perturbation can naturally arise in a variety of astrophysical situations. Examples include the late stages of the gravitational collapse of massive stars or the capture of infalling matter. With the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy and the detection of signals from BBH mergers, the QNM ringdown of the final black hole has become the prime example to test black hole perturbation theory. The ringdown can be searched for in the post-merger section of the gravitational-wave signal, which encodes information on the properties of the remnant object. In particular, the analysis of QNMs can be exploited to test\nthe nature of such object and, specifically, to understand if this is consistent with an astrophysical black hole as predicted by general relativity, ruling out alternative exotic compact objects [16].\nOne of the most appealing prospects of black-hole spectroscopy is, thus, the testing of general relativity. By comparing the observed QNM spectra of post-merger black holes with the known spectra of the Kerr (or KerrNewman) solutions of Einstein(-Maxwell) theories, tests of the no-hair theorem [17\u201320] may become possible. This conjecture states that for a Kerr-Newman black hole the mode oscillation frequencies and damping rates are determined uniquely by the black hole mass, angular momentum and possibly charge (which is expected to be zero for astrophysical black holes). Consistency tests of general relativity need, at least, the precise identification of three QNM parameters, two to measure the mass and the spin of the black hole and the third one for cross-check [21, 22]. Such an identification is expected to be only possible if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the ringdown stage is O(100) [5, 23, 24]. Therefore, the actual realization of strong-confidence tests of GR through black-hole spectroscopy seems out of reach for current second-generation detectors1 (but see [6] for a more promising estimate when various signal posteriors are combined) while it will be possible with the Einstein Telescope [26] and the space detector LISA [27]. At present, searches for violations of the no-hair conjecture are conducted by introducing potential deviations in the QNM parameters as additional degrees of freedom\n1 As an example, the ringdown SNR for the first signal detected, GW150914, was around 7 when the analysis is started 3ms after the signal peak. Moreover, this reaches ' 15 if the analysis is started at the signal peak introducing overtones [10, 11, 25].\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n06 10\n3v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 2\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2 to estimate through Bayesian inference. The most recent study carried out by the LVK collaboration using data form the third gravitational-wave catalog GWTC3 [4] constrains the frequency deviation parameters for the fundamental and the first overtone of the ` = m = 2 QNM by about 1% at 90% credibility [28] (see [10, 25] for the first application of this technique). Black hole spectroscopy is expected to become increasingly important as gravitational-wave detectors become more sensitive to subdominant quasi-normal modes. Moreover, the possible deviations from the predictions of general relativity can be parametrized and used to test for exotic compact objects [16] and alternative theories of gravity [29, 30].\nThe QNM frequencies and their decay rates are computed from the linear analysis around the background geometry, and can be extracted from a large variety of spacetime geometries (see [15, 31\u201337] for an incomplete list). In the case of the Schwarzschild geometry, the perturbations were first studied by [20, 38, 39] and then extended to Kerr black holes by Teukolsky [40], leading to the renowned master equation bearing his name. After separation of variables on the Teukolsky equation, two master equations depending respectively on the radial and zenital coordinates are obtained, which have to be solved in order to extract the QNMs. There is a surprisingly large diversity of methods to solve such master equations. Those have been devised during the past decades in parallel to the development of computational power. The first method, introduced by Leaver [41] and based on the Fro\u0308benius method, expands the master variables as an infinite series, imposing the convergence of such series in the whole domain through the so-called \u201cquotient method\u201d. This is equivalent to finding roots of a function which is expressed as a continued fraction, which is the reason why this approach is commonly known as the \u201ccontinued fraction\u201d method. Among the many other methods, it is worth mentioning the direct time evolution of the equations [42\u201344], the computation of bound states in an effective potential [45], the WKB approximation [46], asymptotic iteration methods [47], pseudospectral basis decomposition [48, 49], or even more exotic approaches such as the expansion in the spacetime dimension [50].\nIn this paper we solve the Teukolsky equation using a machine-learning approach, namely physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [51] and assess the quality of our results by comparing them with those obtained by the continued fraction method. The main advantage of PINNs as a method for finding QNMs is that it can be easily adapted to different systems with very little changes in the method implementation, bringing us closer to a general-purpose quasinormal mode solver. The networks can in principle solve an arbitrary number of equations with an arbitrary number of eigenvalues and separation constants just by adding them to the loss function of the system with appropriate weighting factors. Moreover, PINNs do not require a particular computational grid or numerical differentiation techniques\nand the method can be easily implemented with only a few lines of code in a machine-learning environment (as e.g. the PyTorch [52] framework employed here). The equations that are to be solved have no particular requirements for the PINN to process them, as long as their solutions are finite and regular, which makes PINNs also adequate for uses on numerical background solutions.\nThe main idea behind PINNs is to use neural networks as universal approximants of mathematical functions [53] in order to solve differential equations. In the simplest case, one can approximate a function f(x) with a fullyconnected feed-forward neural network with a single neuron in the input layer, which receives values of x. Then, a single neuron (or two, if f is complex) in the output layer will generate the value of f(x). An important advantage with respect to other numerical techniques is the ability to evaluate the derivatives of f(x) by standard automatic differentiation on every point, without the need for a numerical differentiation scheme on a fixed grid.\nAutomatic differentiation in general, and backpropagation in particular, are the commonly used techniques to take derivatives of machine learning models with respect to their parameters (weights and biases), which are then used by an optimization algorithm to train the model. In our case, we use the same infrastructure of automatic differentiation to compute the derivatives of the model outputs with respect to the input coordinates of the differential equation (in the present case, the radial and angular coordinates). Given a differential equation of the form F [x; f(x), f \u2032(x), f \u2032\u2032(x), ...] = 0, then it is straightforward to define a loss function L as the norm of the values of F on some set of points in the domain. Minimizing L is then equivalent to solving the differential equation for f(x).\nWhen the differential equation has one or multiple parameters to be computed, these can be fitted in the same manner as the weights and biases of the neural network, making the practical implementation remarkably straightforward. General boundary conditions and solution normalizations can be included in the loss function (weak enforcement) or imposed on the neural network output (hard enforcement), see for instance [54\u201356]. PINNs have been used in the past for the computation of black-hole QNMs [57\u201359] in the case of the Schwarzschild metric. In this paper we extend this approach to the more astrophysically relevant case of the Kerr metric.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II we lay out our analytic treatment of the Teukolsky equation in order to make it suitable for its implementation in a PINN, which is described in Section III. We present our results in Section IV and close with our conclusions in Section V."

A weighted sum of both contributions is defined as the total loss function of the system.\ndummy variable (x and u respectively). The output layers consist of two neurons that output the real and imaginary parts of the approximated functions. The computations across both networks are performed on real numbers exclusively. The trainable parameters of the setup will then be the weights and biases of the networks and, very importantly, the parameters \u03c9 and A. Furthermore, we adopt a \u201chard enforcement\u201d scheme to impose the normalization conditions (9), by defining\nf(x) = ( ex\u22121 \u2212 1 ) Nf (x) + 1,\ng(u) = ( eu+1 \u2212 1 ) Ng(u) + 1.\n(12)\nThis automatically ensures that (9) are satisfied without the need for any specially devoted term in the loss (11), which significantly accelerates the convergence of the method.\nThe system is implemented under the PyTorch framework, which provides automatic differentiation capabilities, making it very easy to implement the neural networks as well as the optimizing tools. Optimization is\nperformed by the Adam algorithm [60], with an initial learning rate of 0.005 which exponentially decays with a factor 0.999 per epoch. Each value of the spin parameter a is trained for a total of 2000 epochs.\nIn order to compute the QNMs for a whole range of spins in a \u2208 [0, 1/2) of the Kerr geometry, which can be then interpolated, we can proceed in a sequential manner. We start by training the Schwarzschild case (a = 0) with the weights and biases of the network randomly initialized. Initial random weights are normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviations of 0.05 (f network) and 0.01 (g network), while all biases are set to zero. The initial value of \u03c9 can be set to a value close to the expected mode (in our case we choose \u03c90 = 0.7\u22120.1i), and A is used to fix l, by initializing it to its analytic value at zero spin: A0 = l(l + 1)\u2212 s(s+ 1).\nAfter the solution for a = 0 has been trained, we start progressively increasing the value of a in small steps, and retrain the network to extract the QNM at the new value of a, until we reach the maximum value of a = 0.4999. At each training step, we take as initial weights and biases the ones resulting from the training at the previous step. In this way, we start the convergence process for each value of a with a configuration that is closer to the optimum than a randomly initialized network. We also guarantee that the network will always converge to the mode with the same value of l, which would otherwise be hard to impose for a > 0.\nWe find that, when gradually increasing the value of the spin parameter a, it is convenient to cluster the training at higher spins. In order to achieve this, we choose increasing values of a as\nak = 1\n2\n( 1\u2212 10\u2212 3(k\u22121) Na\u22121 ) , k = 1, . . . , Na, (13)\nwith Na = 20."

While our method is applicable to any ringdown mode, we choose to showcase these two. The first one is the fundamental emission mode from circular black-hole merger remnants. The second is co-dominant in the case of highly eccentric mergers, a type of source that has received much attention recently (e.g. [61\u201365]), and therefore may serve as a smoking gun for such scenario. In Figure 4 we show the final results for the near-extremality case, i.e., a = 0.4999 as the values of the learned radial and angular functions f(x) and g(u) and the learning curve for this value of the spin. The learning curve is a plot of the loss function from equation (11) as a function of the number of iterations. As expected for a converging system, it starts by dropping very fast, and then the convergence rate becomes smaller as we approach the minimum.\nThe real and imaginary parts of the QNMs are explicitly reported in Tables I and II, respectively, together\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nRe [\n] e rro\nr ( %\n) a = 0.0 a = 0.4999\n1 2 3 4 5 Number of hidden layers\n(200 neurons each)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nIm [\n] e rro\nr ( %\n)\nFIG. 3.

In this particular case, we randomly initialize the networks for each value of a. It can be observed that all of the modes in the tables are less than 1% away.\nSubdominant QNMs can also be computed with the PINN, although higher overtones (n > 0) become increasingly difficult to obtain and usually require larger training times. The simplest approach is to initialize the frequency parameter \u03c9 to a value closer to the desired mode prior to the training, which can make the training process converge to it. Slowly lowering the initial imaginary part of \u03c9 can be used as a way to scan the first overtones. More sophisticated methods use driving terms in the loss function to favor higher modes, as in [55].

This indicates that our QNMs are suitable for parameter estimation in the near future, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or Einstein Telescope, when SNRs of O(1000) can be expected [67]. We note that the quality of the PINN modes significantly decays for higher values of the spin, as the black hole approaches extremality, especially for the case of the (l,m, n) = (2, 2, 0) mode."

Signal-to-noise ratio estimates to resolve the waveforms generated by using modes from the PINN and pykerr.\npared to the accepted values in the literature [41]. This validates the method as an acceptable approach to use for black-hole spectroscopy in the foreseeable future. We have focused here on the cases of the fundamental (`,m, n) = (2, 2, 0) ringdown mode, dominant for quasicircular BBH merger remnants and the (2, 0, 0) mode, which can serve as a smoking gun for highly eccentric mergers [65]. In addition, we have displayed the calculation of the overtone (2, 2, 1) and the strongest higher angular mode in quasi-circular BBH mergers (3, 3, 0), as these are the most promising prospects to realise blackhole spectroscopy in the near future. While in this paper we have showcased the utility of PINNs in solving the astrophysically relevant case of the Teukolsky equation, this work can be regarded as a first step towards the computation of QNMs under more generic conditions (e.g. [77]).\nPINNs are very versatile, general-purpose tools that, as the particular physics case discussed in this work has shown, can solve in a remarkably straightforward way quasi-normal mode (eigenvalue) problems that would otherwise require a more involved numerical setup. Their implementation is very simple when compared to other techniques, requiring only a few lines of code in a suitable machine learning framework providing automatic differentiation capabilities. In addition, the method has also\nthe advantage of being able to solve several equations with several eigenvalues at once, in our case the radial and angular equations with the eigenvalue \u03c9 and the separation constant A. As opposed to other methods, this generalization is trivially done by performing a weighted sum of each equation\u2019s contribution to the total loss function.\nMoreover, the requirements on the type of equations to be used are very low, and PINNs are expected to solve very generic equations. In particular, they can be applied to any system of the form (8) with arbitrary coefficients Fi(x), Gi(u). Remarkably, these coefficients do not even need to have an analytical expression, which makes this approach especially interesting for the computation of QNMs for complicated numerical background solutions, such as those involving exotic compact objects or in modified gravity. Therefore, we regard this paper as a preliminary step towards the use of PINNs for the extraction of QNMs in a variety of more complex scenarios in strong-field gravity.\nThe major drawbacks of a solution procedure based on PINNs are the computation time, which is usually larger than in other methods, and the accuracy of the results. However, for the physics case studied in this work these two drawbacks do not seem to be much of a concern. On the one hand, the very small size of the required network architectures makes the training affordably fast, with approximately 2 minutes per mode. On the other hand, the precision that we obtain, albeit not as high as that achieved by some other numerical techniques (e.g. spectral methods), is sufficient to be used on experimental detection data for black-hole spectroscopy and parameter estimation for current detector sensitivities, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or Einstein Telescope."
