They are easily fluidized by applying a mechanical stress, undergoing a yielding transition that still lacks a unified description. Here, we investigate yielding in three classes of repulsive soft solids, using analytical and numerical modelling and experiments probing the microscopic dynamics and mechanical response under oscillatory shear. We find that at the microscopic level yielding consists in a transition between two distinct dynamical states, which we rationalize by proposing a lattice model with dynamical coupling between neighboring sites, leading to a unified state diagram for yielding. Leveraging the analogy with Wan der Waals\u2019s phase diagram for real gases, we show that distance from a critical point plays a major role in the emergence of first-order-like vs second-orderlike features in yielding, thereby reconciling previously contrasting observations on the nature of the transition. The yielding transition of soft glassy systems is of great relevance both in technological and industrial applications and at a fundamental level [1]. Despite profound differences in their microscopic structural features, yielding occurs with very similar macroscopic features in systems as diverse as colloidal and nanoparticle suspensions [2], emulsions [3\u20135], star polymers [6] and microgels [7]. This suggests the presence of an underlying general framework, which has been addressed in recent experimental, theoretical and numerical works [8, 9], leading to contrasting results.

Despite profound differences in their microscopic structural features, yielding occurs with very similar macroscopic features in systems as diverse as colloidal and nanoparticle suspensions [2], emulsions [3\u20135], star polymers [6] and microgels [7]. This suggests the presence of an underlying general framework, which has been addressed in recent experimental, theoretical and numerical works [8, 9], leading to contrasting results. Measurements of the macroscopic viscoelastic properties suggest that yielding develops progressively as the system is driven far from the linear regime [2, 3, 6, 7, 10]. Various models such as the soft glassy rheology [8], the mode coupling theory [11, 12] and fluidity [13\u201315] or on-lattice [16] models reproduce the evolution of viscoelastic parameters across yielding. Recent experiments and simulations probing microscopic quantities indicate that yielding is associated with an increase of particle mobility [4, 5, 17\u201323], suggesting that it may be described as a dynamic transition between a quiescent, solid-like state and a dynamically active, fluid-like state, bearing analogies with equilibrium phase transitions, an approach similar to that used in the past to describe other flow-induced transitions [24].

These works suggested contrasting scenarios for the yielding transition. Some systems exhibit features typical of a first-order transition, such as a discontinuous jump of the particle mobility [4, 5, 20\u201322] or of structural symmetries [27], the coexistence of dynamically distinct states [20], and hysteresis [28]. By contrast, in other cases yielding is described as a rather continuous transition [19, 29], with features such as sluggish dynamics [4, 17\u201319], enhanced fluctuations [4, 30] and growing length scales [19] typically associated with a second-order transition. Thus, the nature of the yielding transition remains elusive: there is a dearth of experiments and modelling addressing the mechanical response and the microscopic dynamics of a class of soft materials sufficiently diverse to allow for a general description of yielding.\nHere, we establish a unified view of the yielding transition of repulsive soft colloids by combining experiments probing both microscopic and macroscopic quantities with theoretical modelling and numerical simulations. We investigate samples of three kinds: concentrated suspensions of microgel particles (M) and charged silica nanoparticles (N), and dense emulsions (E) (see Methods for details). All samples exhibit qualitatively similar behavior in oscillatory shear tests at frequency \u03c9 and at variable strain amplitude \u03b30, as exemplified by Fig. 1a for microgels. For small enough \u03b30, G \u2032 and G\u2032\u2032, the storage and loss moduli, are independent of \u03b30, G \u2032 >> G\u2032\u2032 and the stress amplitude \u03c3 grows linearly with \u03b30, indicative of a predominantly elastic, linear response. As \u03b30 is increased, a gradual transition to the nonlinear regime is observed: G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 deviate from their low-\u03b30 behavior, with G \u2032\u2032 going through a maximum and eventually exceeding G\u2032. Deviations from a purely harmonic response become non-negligible, as shown by the growth of the normalized third harmonic amplitude I3/I1 of the stress response. At the largest strain amplitudes, \u03c3 grows sublinearly with \u03b30 and both moduli decay as power laws: G \u2032 \u221d \u03b3\u22122\u03bd0 and G\u2032\u2032 \u221d \u03b3\u2212\u03bd0 , with a sample-dependent exponent \u03bd in the range 0.6-0.75, see Supplementary Table SI1.\nThe range of strain amplitudes over which rheological quantities signal the transition from solid-like to fluid-like behavior is quite broad, making it difficult to determine the nature of the yielding transition [4, 10]. To gain a deeper insight on yielding, we couple rheometry to measurements of the microscopic dynamics, using dynamic light scattering or differential dynamic microscopy (see Methods). Both methods quantify the dynamics via the intensity correlation function g2(\u03c4)\u2212 1, which decays from 1 to 0 as microscopic displacements grow\na): Oscillatory rheology for a microgel suspension at effective volume fraction \u03d5 = 1.5 (sample M40s). Left axis: first-harmonic storage (G\u2032, black squares) and loss (G\u2032\u2032, white circles) moduli vs strain amplitude \u03b30, at fixed \u03c9 = 0.157 rad s \u22121. Right axis: first-harmonic stress amplitude (\u03c3, gold crosses) and normalized third harmonic component of the stress signal (I3/I1, brown pluses).

The\ncorrelation functions are fitted with compressed exponential functions, with compression exponent\n\u03b20 = 1.65 > 1 (lines). c): Relaxation rate 1/\u03c40 vs scattering vector. Same color code as in b). The line is a fit with slope 1, indicating ballistic dynamics.\nbeyond a length scale \u03c0/q \u2248 (0.1\u2212 1) \u00b5m set by the scattering vector q.\nThe spontaneous dynamics measured at rest are similar for all samples, and are well\ndescribed by a slow, compressed exponential relaxation: g (s) 2 (\u03c4) \u2212 1 = exp [ \u22122 (\u03c4/\u03c40)\u03b20 ] , Fig.1b, with sample-dependent values of the spontaneous relaxation rate 1/\u03c40 and of the exponent \u03b20 > 1, see Supplementary Table SI1. These dynamics are ballistic, as indicated, for the microgels, by the linear dependence of 1/\u03c40 with q, Fig.1c. Similar spontaneous dynamics have been reported for many other jammed or glassy soft samples at rest, and are attributed to the slow relaxation of quenched internal stresses [25]. To investigate the microscopic dynamics under deformation, we apply an oscillatory shear with angular frequency \u03c9 and measure g2 \u2212 1 stroboscopically, for \u03c4 values a multiple of the oscillation period 2\u03c0/\u03c9.\nThe dynamics probed by this echo protocol [31] are only sensitive to irreversible rearrangements, either spontaneous or induced by shear. Figures 2a-c reveal striking similarities of the overall behavior of the correlation functions across all samples. Under small strain amplitudes, the dynamics are independent of \u03b30, while they increasingly accelerate with growing strain at larger \u03b30. Concomitantly, the shape of g2 \u2212 1 evolves from a steep compressed exponential decay at low \u03b30 to a stretched shape at large \u03b30. Data at all strain amplitudes are very well fitted by the following expression:\ng2(\u03c4)\u2212 1 = { \u03c7 exp [ \u2212 (\u0393s\u03c9\u03c4)\u03b2s ] + (1\u2212 \u03c7) exp [ \u2212 (\u0393f\u03c9\u03c4)\u03b2f ]}2 , (1)\nwhere \u03b2f and \u03b2s are (sample-dependent) constants, whereas \u03c7, \u0393s and \u0393f vary with \u03b30. The dimensionless relaxation rates for the slow and fast relaxation modes, normalized by the oscillation frequency \u03c9, are designated by \u0393s and \u0393f , respectively.\nFigures 2d-f show the strain dependence of the normalized relaxation rates, \u0393s,f , and of the slow mode amplitude \u03c7, obtained by fitting Eq. 1 to the correlation functions of Figs. 2a-c. Three regimes can be distinguished. For small enough strain amplitudes, g2 \u2212 1 relaxes through a single, slow compressed exponential mode (\u03c7 = 1), with a stretching exponent \u03b2s \u2265 1 (see Supplementary Table SI1) and a strain-independent relaxation rate \u0393s close to that at rest, 1/\u03c9\u03c40. For the microgels, oscillatory tests at \u03c9 = 0.157 rad s \u22121 and \u03c9 = 3.14 rad s\u22121 indicate no dependence of the slow mode with \u03c9 (in physical units), further confirming that the dynamics observed in this regime are unaffected by shear and simply correspond to the sample spontaneous relaxation. As \u03b30 exceeds a threshold value, correlation functions become strain-dependent. A second, faster mode, characterized by a stretched exponential relaxation, adds to the spontaneous relaxation mode, whose relative amplitude \u03c7 rapidly decays from 1 to 0 with increasing \u03b30. Finally, for sufficiently large \u03b30, \u03c7 \u2248 0: the correlation functions are well fitted by a single stretched exponential relaxation, with \u0393f increasing as \u03b3 n 0 , with a sample-dependent exponent 1 < n < 8 (red symbols in Figs 2d-f). In this regime, we check for microgels that the fast relaxation rate, in physical units, is proportional to \u03c9, as expected in the case of dynamics fully dominated by rearrangements induced by strain oscillations. Moreover, we find that for the microgels and emulsions \u0393f scales as q 2 (see Supplementary Figs. SI8-SI9), the hallmark of diffusive motion, as also reported recently in simulations [21] and in experiments on other kinds of microgels under large shear strain [23]. This shear-induced diffusive behavior at large \u03b30 is\nanalogous to the dynamics of equilibrated dense colloidal suspensions at rest [32, 33], and contrasts with the ballistic behavior at small strain or at rest. Our experiments thus show that at the microscopic level yielding corresponds to a transition between ultraslow, ballistic relaxations at small \u03b30 (unaccounted for in previous works) and fast, diffusive relaxations beyond yielding. In analogy to the recently reported abrupt change of microscopic quantities such as the particle mean squared displacement or diffusivity [4, 21, 23], the amount of irreversible rearrangements [5, 17, 20], and the size of avalanches [22], the correlation functions measured in our experiments exhibit a marked change in a narrow interval of \u03b30, indicative of a transition sharper than for rheological quantities, compare the stars and the vertical lines in Figs. 2d-f.\nTo rationalize these findings, we introduce a simple model. The sample is coarse-grained on a lattice; each lattice site is attributed a relaxation rate \u0393i that depends on both the spontaneous relaxation at rest 1/\u03c9\u03c40 and shear-induced rearrangements \u0393sh,i:\n\u0393i= 1/\u03c9\u03c40 + \u0393sh,i (2a)\n\u0393sh,i= K \u03b3\u2212n0 +N \u22121 \u2211 j \u03b1ij\n\u0393i\u0393j\n, (2b)\nwhere K is a constant whose physical meaning will be discussed later, and where the sum in the r.h.s. of Eq. 2b runs over the N nearest neighbors of site i, with \u03b1i,j coupling constants between the dynamics of sites i and j. Equation 2a states that the overall relaxation rate is the sum of two independent contributions: 1/\u03c9\u03c40, the spontaneous relaxation rate, and \u0393sh,i(\u03b30), the site- and strain amplitude-dependent rate of the additional relaxation induced by shear. A similar additive rule has been invoked in mode coupling-based models [34\u201336], which postulated \u0393sh,i \u221d \u03b3n0 . However, this form of the shear-induced relaxation rate yields a smooth growth of \u0393i with \u03b30, rather than a well-defined transition. Instead, we propose in Eq. 2b an alternative ansatz for the shear-induced relaxation rate. It is the simplest expression that accounts for the following physical ingredients: i) \u0393sh,i should vanish for small strain amplitudes, implying \u0393i \u2248 1/\u03c9\u03c40 in the \u03b30 \u2192 0 limit; ii) in the opposite limit of large \u03b30, the dynamics should be dominated by the externally imposed shear, implying \u0393i \u2192 K\u03b3n0 , as measured in our experiments for the fast mode; iii) in the intermediate regime, the shear-induced dynamics should be ruled not only by the external drive, but also by the interactions between neighboring sites, which we expect to slow down the system relaxation, as modelled by the sum term in the r.h.s. of Eq. 2b. The latter is chosen in the spirit\nof dynamic facilitation models for the spontaneous relaxation of glassy systems [37], where sites with a higher-than-average relaxation rate facilitate the relaxation of neighboring sites.\nWe start by considering the mean-field version of the model, where the coupling constants and thus the relaxation rates are taken to be identical for all sites, \u03b1ij \u2261 \u03b1 and \u0393i \u2261 \u0393. The mean field model can be solved analytically by recasting Eqs. 2 as( \u0393\u2212 1\n\u03c9\u03c40\n)( \u03b3\u2212n0 + \u03b1\n\u03932\n) = K , (3)\nwith \u03b1 an average coupling constant. This equation is formally identical to the Van der Waals (VdW) equation of state ruling the vapor-liquid transition of real gases, with pressure p volume V and temperature T in the VdW\u2019s equation replaced by \u03b3\u2212n0 , \u0393, and K, respectively. The spontaneous non-dimensional rate 1/\u03c9\u03c40 and the coupling constant \u03b1 play the role of the molecular volume and molecular interaction parameter in VdW\u2019s law, respectively.\nIn experiments, the strain amplitude is the control parameter, typically plotted on the x axis. In Fig. 3a, we rather choose \u0393 as the abscissa, to emphasize the analogy of \u2018iso-K\u2019 solutions of Eq. 3 with VdW isotherms in a pV diagram. We find that in the mean field model K plays a key role in differentiating samples that exhibit a yield transition from samples that are predominantly fluid-like at all \u03b30, as illustrated by the three curves of Fig. 3a. For K larger than a critical value Kc, solid line in Fig. 3a, \u03b3 \u2212n 0 decreases monotonically with increasing \u0393. This corresponds to the smooth growth \u2014 with no yielding transition\u2014 of the relaxation rate of concentrated yet equilibrated colloidal fluids upon applying a mechanical drive [38] . For K < Kc, by contrast, \u03b3 \u2212n 0 (\u0393) becomes non-monotonic (dashed line in Fig. 3a): within a finite range of strain amplitudes, a unique value of \u03b30 is now associated with multiple values of \u0393. In a VdW fluid, this feature is associated with the vapor-liquid phase transition: upon compression, the system jumps from the vapor branch to the fluid branch of the isotherm line at a pressure set by the minimization of the free energy and corresponding to Maxwell\u2019s equal area rule. In our model, non-monotonic iso-K curves are associated with yielding. Starting from a solid at rest and increasing progressively \u03b30, the system descends the solid-like (left) branch of the equation of state, corresponding to small and nearly constant \u0393. In the representation of Fig. 3a, portions of the equation of state with positive slope are nonphysical, because they correspond to faster relaxation rates attained at lower strain amplitudes. Thus, the system has to jump from the left branch to the right, fluid branch, which constitutes yielding in our model. We find that in the mean field limit\nof the model, the jump occurs at the minimum of the iso-K line, from point 1 to point 2 in Fig. 3a. Introducing disorder smears the transition and, in the limit of small disorder, the yield strain is shifted to smaller values, approaching a value set by the equivalent of Maxwell\u2019s equal area rule [39] (points 1\u2019 and 2\u2019 ). Finally, the dotted line of Fig. 3a represents the critical iso-K: in analogy to the VdW\u2019s critical isotherm, it has an inflection point but no local minimum. Here, it separates systems that are fluid-like at all \u03b30 from systems that are solid-like at small enough \u03b30.\nThe mean field model, Eq. 3, describes yielding as a first-order transition between two dynamically distinct states, accounting for both the linear and the fully fluidized regimes. However, it fails to properly capture the gradual onset of the fast-relaxation mode and the regime of intermediate strain amplitudes where both modes coexist. Quenched disorder is known to smear out first-order transitions [40, 41]. To explore the role of disorder in our case, we solve numerically the full model, Eq. 2, using model parameters that fit the microgels data of Fig. 2d (details in Methods). In the presence of disorder, \u0393i varies from site to site: representative probability distributions \u03c1(\u0393i) are reported for three strain amplitudes in Fig. 3b. In agreement with experiments, three different regimes are seen: (1) under small strain amplitudes, \u03c1(\u0393i) is unimodal, peaked around a small value comparable to the relaxation rate at rest; (2) under intermediate strain amplitudes, \u03c1(\u0393i) becomes bimodal as a consequence of the appearance of a second, faster mode characterized by a rate \u0393f , typically well separated from \u0393s and growing with \u03b30; (3) under large strain amplitudes, the slow mode vanishes and \u03c1(\u0393i) is again unimodal, but is now sharply peaked around \u0393f \u221d \u03b3n0 .\nWe associate the bimodal nature of \u03c1(\u0393i) at intermediate \u03b30 with the coexistence of slow and fast relaxation modes observed experimentally, which smears the transition with respect to the mean field prediction (compare the dashed line and the distribution of \u0393i indicated by the color shades in Fig. 3a). A spatial map of the local relaxation rates reveals that slow and fast relaxing sites form a coarse structure (Fig. 3c), consistent with the spatial localization of highly mobile regions observed in the single-cycle dynamics of sheared emulsions [4]. The separation between the two modes allows one to extract from \u03c1(\u0393i) two well-defined values of \u0393s and \u0393f , as well as the relative weight \u03c7 of the slow mode. A suitable choice of the model parameters K, n, and of a log-normal distribution of \u03b1 (see Supplementary Table SI2) reproduces the experimental strain dependence of \u0393s, \u0393f and \u03c7 (lines in Fig. 2d-f).

For the mean-field model, the coordinates of the critical point are derived by imposing that both the first and the second derivative of \u03b30(\u0393) vanish, in analogy to VdW\u2019s equation of state. For the model with disorder, we use reduced variables obtained from Table I with the mean-field \u03b1 replaced by the average value \u03b1\u0304 of the site-dependent \u03b1i,j.\nFigure 4a shows the unified yielding state diagram for soft colloids obtained using reduced variables. For each sample, we tune \u03b1\u0304 and the variance \u03c32\u03b1 of the coupling constants distribution, the spontaneous relaxation rate 1/\u03c40 and the exponent n in order to reproduce the strain dependence of \u0393s,f and \u03c7, as exemplified in Fig. 2d-f. Using these fitting parameters, we re-express the experimental variables in terms of the reduced variables of Fig. 4a. In this representation, all samples fall on nearly the same solid and fluid branches, characterized respectively by a single, compressed exponential slow mode (small \u0393r, blue solid symbols in Fig. 4a) and a single, fast stretched exponential mode (large \u0393r, red open symbols). This collapse is remarkable, given the diversity of the microscopic structure of the investigated samples, which in turn results in marked differences in the sensitivity to shear, compare e.g. the steep growth of \u0393s with applied strain for the emulsions to the gentler increase for microgels and nanoparticles (Figs. 2d-f). Furthermore, by analyzing data at various q vectors for E samples, we find that the collapse is robust with respect to the choice of the probed length scale, see Supplementary. At intermediate \u0393r, within the region inaccessible to the mean field model, a fast mode and a slow mode coexist (gray half-filled symbols in Fig. 4a), as predicted by the model with disorder; the abscissa used for these points is the weighted average of the fast and slow relaxation rates (see Methods).\nIn the coexisting region, samples\u2019 properties vary markedly and systematically with Kr, which suggests classifying all systems according to this parameter. Since Kr < 1 corresponds to glassy samples and Kr > 1 to equilibrated fluids, we quantify \u2018glassiness\u2019 of samples with Kr < 1 by g = 1 \u2212Kr, which increases as the iso-Kr curves move downward (see arrow in Fig. 4a) away from the critical curve (g = 0, Kr = 1). For samples of the same kind, the trend in g (see Fig. 4b and Table SI2 in Supplementary) agrees with the behavior intuitively associated with a lesser or greater glassiness. For emulsions and microgels, we find that in general the higher \u03d5 the more glassy the sample. Consistent with the notion that with age systems evolve towards deeper states in the glassy phase, we find that g increases with age for sample N41%. Finally, one expects g to increase with \u03c9, because glassy samples fall increasingly out of equilibrium as the time scale of the driving becomes shorter. This is indeed what is seen in our experiments, compare samples M40s and M2s. Beyond these comparisons, the notion of glassiness paves the way for a quantitative comparison between samples of different nature (e.g. emulsions vs microgels) or probed according to different protocols. Keeping in mind that each iso-Kr curve \u2013and thus each g value\u2013 is characterized by a different disorder parameter of the coupling constants d = \u03c32\u03b1/\u03b1\u0304 2, we find a remarkable negative correlation between the glassiness and d, which, as shown in Fig. 4b, is characterized by a simple master curve.\nThe correlation between glassiness and disorder has also deep implications on the nature of the yielding transition. We find that the most glassy samples, for which d approaches the d = 0 mean field limit, exhibit features typical of a first-order transition, as predicted by the mean field model (Fig. 5a-c). Figure 5a shows w, the relative width of the \u03b30 range where fast and slow modes coexists in experiments, demonstrating a dramatic increase of the transition sharpness as d decreases. Figures 5b-c demonstrate hysteresis, another distinctive feature of first-order transitions (data from simulations). As seen in Fig. 5c, hysteresis is largest for the smallest disorder and vanishes when departing from the mean field limit.\nConversely, systems close to the critical K and hence with large d (small g) exhibit features usually associated with second order transitions, illustrated in Fig. 5d-f. Figure 5d shows for sample M2s that temporal fluctuations of the relaxation rate are strongly enhanced at the transition. Figures 5e-f demonstrate sluggishness, another feature of second-order transitions: in both experiments (Fig. 5e) and simulations (Fig. 5f) on systems with large d (small g), the time to attain a stationary state dramatically increases around the transition.\nmodel, corresponding to the coexistence of fast and slow relaxation modes in experiments and simulations of the model with disorder. b): Disorder d = \u03c32\u03b1/\u03b1\u0304 2 of the coupling constants \u03b1i,j (see Eq. 2) as a function of \u2018glassiness\u2019, defined as the reduced distance form the critical point, g = 1\u2212Kr (see also the arrow in a)).\nThe unified yielding state diagram established here demonstrates the universal nature of the solid-fluid transition in soft glassy systems under oscillatory shear. Our model differs from previous approaches by introducing a direct link between the macroscopic drive and the microscopic dynamics, and by including in the latter the contribution of ultra-slow,\nspontaneous relaxations; as a result, slow and fast relaxation modes may coexist. These two modes might be associated with the formation of shear bands organized in the shear gradient direction [42, 43]. Our light scattering experiments cannot test directly this hypothesis;\nhowever, our numerical data, microscopy experiments on emulsions, and photon correlation imaging measurements on sample N45% are inconsistent with shear banding (Supplementary Sec. IV), rather pointing to the formation of fast-relaxing domains similar to those of Fig. 3c. This suggests that the coexistence of slow- and fast-relaxing regions is a generic feature, not necessarily implying the structuration in shear bands. A key result of our work is the emergence of different features in the transition depending on the distance from the critical point. This indicates a promising way to reconcile apparently conflicting reports in previous studies of yielding.\nFinally, the model proposed here does not depend on the details of the interaction between the microscopic constituents of the system: we thus expect it to provide a general framework for the yielding transition, possibly including in systems with attractive interactions [44, 45].\nMETHODS\nSamples\nTable II summarizes the main sample and experimental parameters. PNIPAM microgels (M) were synthesized by emulsion polymerization as described in [46], and were suspended in a 2 mM NaN3 aqueous solution to prevent bacterial growth. The microgel radius at T = 23 \u25e6C is 294 nm, as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a diluted suspension. Sample preparation and characterization, including the determination of the effective volume fraction \u03d5, are described in [47]. Note that the effective volume fraction is larger than one, due to the particle softness. Charged nanoparticle systems (N) were prepared by concentrating an acqueous suspension of silica particles (Ludox TM50, from Sigma Aldrich), as described in [47]. The particles have a hydrodynamic radius of 23 nm, as measured by DLS in the dilute limit. To improve the scattering signal, the samples were seeded with 200 nm-diameter polystyrene particles at extremely low volume fraction, \u03c6PS < 10 \u22126. We check that this seeding has no measurable impact on the rheological properties microscopic dynamics of the samples. Concentrated emulsions (E) were prepared by dispersing polydimethylsiloxane droplets into a water/glycerol matrix, as described in [4]. The resulting droplets have an average size of 2.4 \u00b5m and 20% polydispersity. All samples were initialized\nby applying a preshear, see Sec. IIa of the Supplementary for details. Rheology and microscopic dynamics started immediately after applying the preshear for all samples, except for sample N41%Aged, which was left at rest for 12h prior to measurements.\nExperimental setups\nWith the only exception of E samples, all experiments are performed with a home-made shear cell equipped with sliding parallel plates [48], sketched in Supplementary Fig. SI2. One plate is driven by a piezoelectric strain actuator (P602, from Physik Instrumente) and a force sensor (LC601, from Omega Engineering) measures the force applied by the actuator, enabling strain-controlled rheology experiments. The sample has a cross-sectional area of about 4 cm2 and a thickness between 300 and 700 \u00b5m. For most experiments, shear rheology was coupled to a spatially-resolved Photon Correlation Imaging (PCI) apparatus [49], collecting light scattered in a direction orthogonal to the shear and forming a scattering\nangle \u03b8 with the incoming beam. For samples N, we choose \u03b8 = 141\u25e6, yielding a scattering vector q = 4\u03c0nr\u03bb \u22121 sin(\u03b8/2) = 30 \u00b5m\u22121, where nr = 1.33 is the solvent refractive index and \u03bb = 532.5 nm the wavelength of laser light. In this case, q is predominantly oriented along the shear gradient direction, with a minor component qx = 3 \u00b5m \u22121 along the vorticity direction. For M2s, we choose \u03b8 = 20\u25e6 such that q = 5 \u00b5m\u22121 is predominantly oriented along the vorticity direction, with a minor component qz = 0.9 \u00b5m \u22121 along the shear gradient. For M40s, experiments are performed using a different scattering geometry: a far-field small angle light scattering apparatus (SALS) enabling multiple scattering vectors to be probed simultaneously, oriented along both the velocity and the vorticity direction, with 0.1 \u00b5m\u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u00b5m\u22121 . Data shown in the main text correspond to q = 4.8 \u00b5m\u22121, oriented along the vorticity direction. See Supplementary Figs SI1-SI3 for the schemes of the setups.\nFor samples E, a different home-made shear cell with parallel, counter-translating plates displaced by a piezoelectric actuator is coupled to an inverted microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics [4] , see Supplementary Fig. SI3. The acquired imaged region has a depth of field of 0.5 \u00b5m, much smaller than the droplet size, and the imaged plane corresponds to the stagnation plane of the shear deformation. We analyze microscopy videos using far-field Differential Dynamic Microscopy (ff-DDM) [50], which yields an intensity correlation function equivalent to DLS, with scattering vectors 1 \u00b5m\u22121 \u2264 q \u2264 20 \u00b5m\u22121 in the velocity-vorticity plane. Data presented in the main text correspond to q = 9 \u00b5m\u22121 along the vorticity direction. Data for more scattering vectors are included in Supplementary Fig. SI6-SI9.\nCharacterization of the microscopic dynamics\nWe quantify the microscopic dynamics via the two-time intensity correlation g2(t, \u03c4)\u22121 = \u03b2\u3008Ip(t)Ip(t+ \u03c4)\u3009/[\u3008Ip(t)\u3009\u3008Ip(t+ \u03c4)\u3009], with \u03b2 a constant such that g2(t, \u03c4)\u2212 1\u2192 1 for \u03c4 \u2192 0. Ip is the scattered intensity collected by the p \u2212 th pixel of the detector (for the PCI and SALS setups), or a component of the Fourier transform of the microscope images for sample E. \u3008. . . \u3009 indicates the average over a set of pixels corresponding nearly to the same scattering vector or Fourier component.\nIn the stationary regime, we average g2 \u2212 1 over time t to reduce noise before fitting\nEq. 1 to the data. In Fig. 4a, the abscissa of the state points belonging to the coexistence region is calculated as the weighted average of the slow and fast relaxation rates, normalized by the relaxation rate at the critical point: \u0393r = [\u03c7\u0393s + (\u03c7\u2212 1)\u0393f ]/\u0393c. The slow and fast relaxation rates are obtained by fitting Eq. 1 to the experimental g2 \u2212 1.\nTo quantify the temporal fluctuations of the dynamics, we inspect the t-dependence of the two-time correlation functions, with no t averaging performed on g2(t, \u03c4)\u2212 1. For each\nt, a relaxation time \u03c4r(t) is obtained from \u03c4r = \u222b\u221e 0 [g2(t, \u03c4)\u2212 1]d\u03c4 , a procedure more robust than fitting to Eq. 1 when dealing with correlation functions that are not averaged over t and are thus more noisy. In Fig. 5d we show \u03c32\u03c4r , the temporal variance of \u03c4r(t).\nWe locate the range of the dynamic transition by determining the two strain amplitudes \u03b30,s and \u03b30,e such that 0.05 \u2264 \u03c7 \u2264 0.95 for \u03b30,s \u2264 \u03b30 \u2264 \u03b30,e. The gray shaded regions in Figs. 5d-f highlight the strain range \u03b30,s \u2264 \u03b30 \u2264 \u03b30,e. The normalized width of the transition shown in Fig. 5a is defined as w = (\u03b30,e \u2212 \u03b30,s)/(\u03b30,e + \u03b30,s).\nNumerical solution of the model with disorder\nTo study the effect of disorder on yielding, we implement our model (Eq. 2) on a Ddimensional cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Each site, i, is assigned a local relaxation rate, \u0393i, and each pair of neighbor sites is attributed a coupling constant, \u03b1ij, randomly drawn from a probability distribution, P (\u03b1). For a given strain amplitude \u03b30 and starting from an initial configuration of local rates \u0393 (init) i , we seek a configuration of local rates \u0393 (sol) i that satisfies Eq. 2 for all sites. In our implementation, \u0393 (sol) i is approached iteratively: at each step, a set of target site rates \u0393 (t) i is computed through Eq. 2 using the current site rates \u0393 (c) i . \u0393 (t) i then replaces \u0393 (c) i for the following iteration, yielding a new set of target site rates. The convergence criterion is expressed in terms of a loss function\nL = \u2211\ni\n[( log \u0393\n(c) i \u2212 log \u0393 (t) i\n) / log \u0393\n(t) i\n]2 , which tends to 0 as \u0393\n(c) i approaches \u0393 (sol) i .\nResults shown in this paper are obtained for D = 2 and a Log-Normal distribution of\nthe coupling constants: P (\u03b1;\u00b5, \u03c3) = (\u03b1\u03c3 \u221a 2\u03c0)\u22121 exp[\u2212(ln\u03b1\u2212\u00b5)2/(2\u03c32)], where the average \u03b1\u0304 and variance \u03c32\u03b1 of the coupling constants are related to the parameters \u00b5, \u03c3 of the LogNormal distribution by \u03b1\u0304 = exp(\u00b5 + \u03c32/2) and \u03c32\u03b1 = \u03b1\u0304 2(exp\u03c32 \u2212 1). We quantify disorder by the dimensionless parameter d = \u03c32\u03b1/\u03b1\u0304 2. Representative results for different choices of P (\u03b1) are shown in Supplementary Fig. SI13, and exhibit no qualitative differences.\nTo mimic the effect of preshear in experiments, the iterative solution of the numerical\nmodel is typically initiated with a uniform distribution of local rates \u0393 (init) i = \u0393 (0). The effect of hysteresis shown in Figs. 5b,c is studied by simulating an amplitude sweep experiment: \u03b30 is first increased from low to high amplitudes and then decreased from high to low amplitudes, every time initiating the iterative calculation from the model solution for the previous amplitude.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe data that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding authors upon request.\nCODE AVAILABILITY\nThe code that support the plots within this paper and other findings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding authors upon request.\n[1] D.

The relaxation rates shown here are measured at representative scattering vectors q=5 m-1, 30 m-1 and 9 m-1 for M, N and E samples, respectively. For the M and N samples, 0 and 0 are measured at rest. For the E samples, no correlation functions at rest are available, but s and s are obtained, as for the other samples shown in the table, in the low strain regime, where these parameters are essentially strain-independent and representative of the behavior at rest. For sample E70%, the decay of the correlation functions in the \ud835\udefe0 \u2192 0 limit is modest, making it difficult to determine unambiguously s, whose value was thus set to unity.\nShear protocol: All samples were presheared before each measurement at a given 0, using oscillatory shear at the same  as for the subsequent measurement. Samples E were presheared for several minutes at a high strain, typically 250\u2013300%. The strain amplitude was then reduced to the target value and at least 300 cycles were imposed at the target 0 before starting the image acquisition, which lasted 1000 cycles or more. Samples M and N were presheared at the largest 0 to be tested. The preshear lasted 500 oscillations for sample M40s, 5000 for all other M and N samples. After presehar, shear at each amplitude had 2500 oscillations (sample M40s) or 50000 oscillations (all other M and N samples). We changed the order at which the various 0 values were tested (including by varying 0 non-monotonically), finding that our results did not depend on the specific sequence of tested strain amplitudes.\nII.b Strain amplitude dependence of the viscoelastic moduli\nFigure SI4: Rheology data for all samples.\nDependence of the viscoelastic moduli G\u2019 and G\u201d and of the shear stress  on shear strain. a: microgels (same data as in Fig. 1 of the main text); b: nanoparticle samples,  = 43.5% (solid symbols and crosses) and 46% (open symbols and pluses); c: emulsions [3].

All other data were obtained using a commercial rheometer. For the N and E samples, the volume fraction is slightly different from that of the corresponding samples used for light scattering and microscopy, which entails no significant difference in the rheological properties with respect to those shown here.\nc\nII.c Dynamics at rest or in the 0 \u2192 0 limit\nFigure SI5: Dynamics at rest or in the 0 \u2192 0 limit for N and E samples.\nIntensity correlation functions for various N and E samples. For N samples, data are taken at rest. For E samples, data are taken in the low-strain regime where the dynamics are essentially independent of the applied strain: 0 = 1.18%, 0.36% and 3.85% for E65, E70, and E74, respectively. For the E samples, in the insets the line shows that the relaxation rate scales as q, indicative of ballistic dynamics. Deviations from ballistic behavior are observed only at very low q, most likely because the decay of g2-1 is too small for the fit to capture reliably the relaxation time.\nII.d Scattering vector dependence of the dynamics and of the model parameters\nFigure SI6: Scattering vector dependence of correlation functions, sample E64.\nIntensity correlation functions for sample E64%, for various imposed strain amplitudes as shown by the labels.

At low q, s approaches unity, most likely because the limited decay of g2-1 prevents the shape of the correlation function to be characterized precisely (see Fig. SI7a-c). b): q and strain amplitude dependence of the relaxation rates of the fast and slow modes. In the large strain regime, f grows as a power-law of 0, with an exponent n independent of q, as indicated by the parallel lines in the double logarithmic plot.\nh\nc): state diagram in the spirit of Fig. 4 of the main text, but obtained from data at different q vectors. All data collapse on the same curve, demonstrating that the model is robust with respect to the choice of q. d): relaxation rate of the spontaneous dynamics, obtained by extrapolating data under shear to the 0 \u2192 0 limit. The relaxation rate increases as q, indicative of ballistic dynamics. e): the model parameter K (akin to temperature T in Van der Waal\u2019s equation of state for real gases) grows as q\u00b2. At large strain, Eqs. 2a-2b of the main text show that  ~ f ~ K/ 0- n. Thus, the K ~ q\u00b2 scaling shown here implies  ~ f ~ q\u00b2, i.e. that the dynamics at large strain are diffusive (see also Fig SI9). f): the yield strain 0,c extracted by fitting the model to the microscopic dynamics exhibits only a mild dependence on the scattering vector q. g): the model parameter K expressed in reduced units (i.e. K normalized by its value Kc at the critical point) is nearly independent of the q vector. h): The normalized amplitude of the slow mode, , depends only very weakly on the q vector at which the microscopic dynamics are measured. This is consistent with the notion that the yield strain inferred from the microscopic dynamics is nearly insensitive to q, as shown in f. Furthermore, the data in h show that the width of the coexistence region is nearly independent of q. Because in the model the width of the coexistence region is mainly controlled by the amount of disorder, these data indicate that the latter is essentially insensitive to the choice of q.\nFigure SI9: Diffusive dynamics in the fluidized regime.\nSymbols: relaxation rates measured in the fully fluidized regime (strain amplitudes: 0=5% for E65% and E70%,  0=7% for E74%,  0=16% for E88%,  0=50% for M40s).

Blue, red and gray symbols refer to compressed (solid-like), stretched (fluid-like), and two-step (coexistence) relaxations, respectively. Arrows highlight the collapse of solid-like relaxations when using physical units (panel a)), and of liquid-like relaxations when using relaxation rates normalized by the angular frequency of the imposed oscillatory shear (panel b)).

            "text": "We test in a few samples the spatial heterogeneity of the dynamics and the existence of shear bands. In the geometry of our experiments, shear bands would develop most likely as layers with different shear deformation organized perpendicularly to the shear gradient direction (the \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc9b\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7\u20d7 direction in the schemes of Figs. SI1- SI3) and parallel to the shear direction. In the light scattering setups used in this work, the scattered light is collected from the whole thickness of the illuminated sample, with no spatial resolution along the shear gradient direction. It is therefore very difficult to test directly the existence of shear bands. However, we note that if shear bands parallel to the shear direction would exist, the dynamics detected in our spaceresolved setup (e.g. the PCI setup of Fig. SI1c) would be spatially homogeneous. Indeed, scattered light exiting from the shear cell and forming the image on the detector would have equally probed all bands, irrespective of the positions in the (x,y) plane that is imaged.\nFigure SI14 shows that this is not the case: instead, in the coexistence region the sample partitions in localized domains of fast and slow dynamics, incompatible with shear bands parallel to the shear direction.\nFigure SI14: Coexistence of fast and slow domains as probed by light scattering.\nStroboscopic correlation maps for sample N45% in the coexistence region (strain amplitude 0 = 5.7%), for different time delays /T = 32 (a), 128 (b), 512 (c), 1024 (d)). The amount of correlation is represented by a gray scale from black (g2-1=0) to white (g2-1=1). Scale bars: 1mm.\nExperiments on emulsions are consistent with this scenario. They probe a thin sample slab (thickness ~ 0.5 \u00b5m, smaller than the drop size), parallel to the shear direction. The observation of the coexistence of two relaxation modes under these conditions (see sample E65%, Fig. SI15) rules out the hypothesis that the\nobserved bimodal relaxation stems from distinct shear bands organized perpendicularly to the shear gradient direction.\nFigure SI15: Dynamic coexistence in emulsions (sample E65%)\na) Intensity correlation functions for sample E65%, plotted vs the normalized time delay , as in Fig. 2 of the main text. Symbols: experimental data. Lines: fits using Eq. 1 of the main text. b) Symbols: fitting parameters. Left axis: normalized relaxation rates for slow and fast modes (blue squares and red circles, respectively). Right axis: relative amplitude  of the slow mode (stars). Lines: result of numerical model with parameters reported in Table SI2.\nFurthermore, a direct visualization of the regions undergoing fast rearrangements may be obtained by taking the difference between the intensity of microscopy images taken at different times, as shown in Fig. SI16. In this representation, quiescent regions appear uniformly gray, whereas features on the drop size length scale emerge in the rearranged regions. One clearly sees the emergence of localized domains of fast-moving drops, once again incompatible with shear bands parallel to the shear direction.\nFigure SI16: Coexistence of fast and slow domains as probed by microscopy.\nImages obtained by taking the intensity difference between two sample snapshots separated by time delays /T = 1 (a), 10 (b), 100 (c), 1000 (d). Data for sample E65%, in the coexistence region (strain amplitude 0 = 3.9%). Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m.\nFinally, in simulations, we find that the system always segregates in mesoscopic domains similar to those shown in Fig. 3c of the main text, with no formation of macroscopic shear bands. An example for various imposed shear amplitudes spanning the coexistence region is shown in Fig. SI17.\nFigure SI17: Coexistence of slow and fast relaxation rates at yielding.\nSnapshots of local normalized relaxation rates, i, at various applied strain amplitudes 0 indicated above each panel from lattice simulations. The model parameters are issued from the fit to sample N45% (see Table SI2). i increases logarithmically from blue to red, as shown by the color bar.
