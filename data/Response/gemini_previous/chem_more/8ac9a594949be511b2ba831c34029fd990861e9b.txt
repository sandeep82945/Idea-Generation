1. **In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antiviral activity of the identified lead compounds against PRRSV.** This would involve testing the compounds in cell culture and animal models to determine their ability to inhibit PRRSV replication and prevent disease.
2. **Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies to optimize the lead compounds.** This would involve synthesizing and testing analogs of the lead compounds to identify structural features that are essential for their antiviral activity.
3. **Mechanistic studies to determine how the lead compounds inhibit Nsp4 activity.** This would involve biochemical and biophysical experiments to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the compounds interfere with Nsp4 function.
4. **Development of combination therapies using the lead compounds and other antiviral agents.** This would involve testing the lead compounds in combination with other antiviral agents to determine if they can synergistically inhibit PRRSV replication.
5. **Exploration of the potential of the lead compounds to inhibit other viruses.** This would involve testing the compounds against a panel of other viruses to determine if they have broad-spectrum antiviral activity.
