The covariates were screened using univariable time-dependent Cox regression, and those with P<0.1 were included in the dynamic and static analyses. We constructed a prediction model for BKV reactivation from 2.5 to 8.5 months after renal transplantation using dynamic Cox regression based on the landmarking method and evaluated its performance using the area under the curve (AUC) value and Brier score. Monte-Carlo cross-validation was done to avoid overfitting. The above evaluation and validation process were repeated in the static model (Cox regression model) to compare the performance. Two patients were presented to illustrate the application of the dynamic model.\nResults: We constructed a dynamic prediction model with 18 covariates that could predict the probability of BKV reactivation from 2.5 to 8.5 months after renal transplantation. Elder age, basiliximab combined with cyclophosphamide for immune induction, acute graft rejection, higher body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary protein level, urinary leukocyte level, and blood neutrophil count were positively correlated with BKV reactivation, whereas male sex, higher serum albumin level, and platelet count served as protective factors. The AUC value and Brier score of the static model were 0.64 and 0.14, respectively, whereas those of the dynamic model were 0.79 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.08 \u00b1 0.01, respectively. In the cross-validation, the AUC values of the static and dynamic models decreased to 0.63 and 0.70 \u00b1 0.03, respectively, whereas the Brier score changed to 0.11 and 0.09 \u00b1 0.01, respectively.\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nConclusion: Dynamic Cox regression based on the landmarking method is effective in the assessment of the risk of BKV reactivation in the early period after renal transplantation and serves as a guide for clinical intervention.\nKEYWORDS\nBK polyomavirus, reactivation, dynamic Cox regression, prediction, renal transplantation"

            "text": "BK polyomavirus (BKV) is an important factor that threatens graft function in renal transplant recipients, leading to allograft failure and even urothelial carcinoma (1). Recently, the increasing number of secondary transplantations, highly sensitized patients, and long-term administration of potent immunosuppressants have resulted in a higher rate of BKV reactivation. The incidence of BKV viruria and viremia among recipients has reached 23%\u201373% and 8%\u201362%, respectively (2, 3). Without clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of BKV reactivation relies on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of BKV DNA in body fluids during regular follow-up (4). Consequently, the detection rate of BKV is closely related to the follow-up schedule, focus on BKV detection, and medical level of followup centers. Owing to the lack of specific antiviral therapies for BKV viruria and viremia as well as BKV allograft nephropathy (BKVAN), we can only reduce immunosuppressant use or use immunoglobulin and cidofovir to control increased viral titers due to BKV reactivation (5, 6). Batal et al. reported that early intervention when urine BKV was positive contributed to the low rate of long-term graft loss, but therapy initiated when urine BKV was high was not effective and had an unsatisfactory prognosis (7). Therefore, determination of the main risks and protective factors, identification of high-risk populations, and early systemic interventions for prognosis improvement are important tertiary prevention strategies for BKV reactivation.\nSeveral studies have explored the relevant static factors of BKV replication in renal transplant recipients with inconsistent results (8\u201316); in particular, the effect of immunosuppressive regimens on BKV replication remains controversial. For example, rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors could inhibit BKV replication, whereas tacrolimus has the opposite effect, according to the research of Hirsch et al. (14). However, a systematic review of 28 randomized, controlled trials did not confirm a reduction of BKV infection with an mTOR inhibitorbased regimen compared with a calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen (15). Because most of the current studies regard BKV viremia or even BKVAN as the endpoint for risk factor analysis, a gap in knowledge remains in the early stage of BKV reactivation. However, the possibility of the effects of various factors being time-dependent is undeniable. For instance, Hirsch\n02\net al. indicated that steroids were a risk factor of BKV reactivation during the first 3 months posttransplantation, whereas tacrolimus, older age, and male sex contributed to later reactivation at 12 months (10). Therefore, to understand the influence of dynamic indices, the risk factors for BKV reactivation after renal transplantation with consideration of time should be analyzed, and a dynamic prediction model for the risk should be constructed. The landmarking method is commonly used for dynamic prediction. By selecting the restricted sample of the data at a specific moment in time to form landmark datasets, this method enables the comprehensive analysis of the baseline information and follow-up data for the risk prediction (17).\nOn the basis of covariates selected by univariable timedependent Cox regression, the present study constructed prediction models for BKV reactivation from 2.5 to 8.5 months after renal transplantation using static and dynamic Cox regression based on the landmarking method, respectively, thus providing a statistical basis for the identification and intervention of high-risk populations for BKV reactivation."

For the dynamic Cox regression model, based on the follow-up data from 0.5 to 6.5 months, the prediction time points were chosen from every month; {si, i = 0,\u2026, L} = {s0, si, \u2026, s6} = {0.5, 1.5, \u2026, 6.5} were used to predict the next w months, which indicates the probability of BKV reactivation from 0.5 + w to 6.5 + w months (Figure 1). For each si, the corresponding landmark dataset Ri was constructed, which included the follow-up population in si - si + w months. The follow-up was restricted to si + w month, which means that the time for patients without BKV reactivation changed to si + w month, ignoring the ending event. For numerical stability, the prediction time was standardized using s / (sL \u2013 s0).\nAll landmark datasets were stacked into a single \u201csuper prediction dataset\u201d and fitted with a Cox model. The effects of covariates, an interaction term for covariates and predicted time s, interaction term for covariates and quadratic term of the predicted time s2 on the positive rate of BKV were evaluated (23). According to the AIC, covariates with P<0.1 in univariate time-dependent Cox regression were screened using backward selection. The regression coefficients of covariates, covariates and s, covariates, and s2 were reported, and the changes in the\nFrontiers in Immunology 04\nhazard ratio (HR) of covariates with s are presented in Figure 1 (24). The dynamic prediction model was performed by R code, which is available in Supplementary File S1.\nEvaluation and validation of dynamic model performance\nThe fitted dynamic Cox model was used to predict the outcomes of each si, which were then compared with the actual data to obtain the performance measures (AUC and Brier score). The baseline static model was also used to predict the outcome, and the AUC and Brier score were calculated.\nMonte-Carlo cross-validation of models was done to avoid overfitting. Specifically, the data were divided into a train set (80% samples) and a test set (20% samples). The train set was used to refit the above models, which were tested in the left samples to obtain another group of performance measures (AUC and Brier score). The entire process was repeated 100 times, providing 100 groups of AUCs and Brier scores. The average of these measurements at each time point represents the performance of the models in the cross-validation.\nThe personal prediction was performed using the dynamic Cox model, which means that the probability of BKV reactivation in the next w months after the postoperative s months could be predicted.\nAll statistical tests were performed at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and all modeling analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria)."

During the follow-up period of 0.5\u20136.5 months after renal transplantation, the performance of the dynamic model was superior to that of the static model, which was based on the baseline all along.\nBased on the AUC value at every predicted moment, the cutoff value of the risk score was obtained at the maximum Youden index. A risk score exceeding the cutoff value indicates a higher risk of BKV reactivation in the following month. The accuracy of the dynamic model along with specificity and sensitivity are shown in Figures 4C1, D1.\nFigures 4A2, B2, C2, D2 illustrates the results of the crossvalidation of the dynamic model. The average AUC was 0.70 \u00b1 0.03. In comparison, the average AUCs of the model when w = 1 and w = 3 were 0.67 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.66 \u00b1 0.03, respectively.

            "text": "BKV reactivation is highly prevalent in renal transplant recipients, mainly occurring within 1 year after transplantation, with a peak period of 3\u20136 months (10). Here, we designed followup strategies according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guideline 2009 (18), that is, detecting plasma and urine BKV DNA loads once a month within 3\u20136 months after the renal transplantation and every 3 months in the following 6 months. The temporal epidemiological distribution of the BKV reactivation population in our center is consistent with those in other domestic and foreign centers.\nCox regression is the common means to predict the risk of endpoint events. However, due to perioperative trauma, graft implantation, high-dose hormone, and immunosuppressive agents, the homeostasis of immune, circulatory, endocrine, and other systems reconstructs with biochemical and physical indices varying with the external disturbance. The static prediction model based on baseline or some fixed-point during follow-up neglects the time dependency of certain covariates (23). In this way, the predicted probability cannot update with the changes in personal conditions. Hence, we proposed a dynamic prediction model based on baseline information and the regular detection indices during the postoperative 0.5\u20136.5 months. The postoperative 2.5\u20138.5 months was designed as a predictive time, and the following 2 months were the predictive time window of BKV reactivation. When compared with the static model, the trends in the early-stage physical changes and the individual heterogeneity of the renal transplant recipients were shown to be fully considered in the dynamic model. In addition, the role of the effective factors was reinforced, and the internal and external disturbances were reduced, thus achieving high sensitivity and specificity with an average AUC value up to 0.79 and accuracy up to 0.76. Subsequently, the model was validated using Monte-Carlo cross-validation. Similar to the above results, the performance in the cross-validation"

Cyclophosphamide, a potent immunosuppressive agent, is commonly used for immune induction in highly sensitized\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nrecipients and for treating recurrent glomerulonephritis after renal transplantation (25). Our study indicated that, unlike the stable dose alleviating autoimmune reactions in the chronic kidney disease stage (26), cyclophosphamide shock treatment showed a remarkable promoting effect on BKV reactivation in highly sensitized recipients during the first 2.5\u20136 months.

This might be attributed to HLA mismatch (28) and medically increasing immunosuppression after then. Urinary tract infection with positive urinary leukocyte and excessive blood neutrophils counts and other opportunistic pathogen infection are also risk factors for BKV reactivation, which indicates hypoimmunity. Obesity was proven to lead to chronic low inflammation, immune system disorders, and impaired defensive function, thus increasing the risk of infection (29, 30). Similarly, a higher BMI showed significant facilitation of BKV reactivation during the postoperative 2.5\u20134.5 months in our study. The serum albumin level reflects hepatic synthesis function, nutritional status, and inflammation and serves as an indicator of\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nthe progression of acute and chronic wasting diseases. A low level of serum albumin could influence the stability of globin and could indicate an exhausted status (31). Some studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia contributes to increased infection by opportunistic pathogens, such as CMV and BKV, after renal transplantation (32). Our results revealed a protective effect of serum albumin on BKV reactivation.\nThe limitation of this study lies in the single-center retrospective design. Because of different donor sources, quality of donor grafts, and matching rules in different centers, donor factors and HLA matching factors were not included in the independent variables in order to improve the universality of the model, whereas related indirect variables such as occurrence of\nfrontiersin.org\nDGF and acute rejection and creatinine fluctuation trend after surgery were included as a remedy.\nBased on the dynamic model, we provided a valuable statistical experience for the prevention of early BKV reactivation after renal transplantation. Compared with the existing static model for BKV reactivation (16), there is a noticeable progress in discrimination (AUC value), which is from 0.69 to 0.79. Additionally, the model emphasized a point of view that post-transplant management is not merely the management of the graft; on the contrary, it is comprehensive management containing multiple factors and systems. Patients cannot extend the follow-up interval randomly, even with good graft function, and clinicians are not expected to pursue rapid recovery of graft function, but rather to ignore the potential risks. The application of the dynamic model is beneficial for precise risk stratification of BKV reactivation and for achieving a balance between rejection and antiviral immunity. Early screening and intervention prevent the incidence of BKV infection-related diseases in high-risk populations. Furthermore, the development of individualized monitoring and treatment prevents the waste of healthcare resources to achieve maximum economic and social benefits."
