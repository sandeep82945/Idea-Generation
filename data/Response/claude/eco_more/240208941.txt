 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop methods for spatial/geographic multivariate RD designs. The current paper focuses on random sample data, but extending the methodology to spatial data could be valuable. This would require new theoretical developments.

2. Explore practical implementation and performance of the methodology for higher dimensional (more than 2) RD designs. The theory allows for any finite dimensions, but performance in higher dimensions is unknown. 

3. Incorporate additional bias correction methods like higher-order bias terms or regularization when sample sizes are small. The paper mentions some limitations when samples are very small, so exploring ways to improve performance in those cases could be useful.

4. Consider optimal kernel selection for multivariate RD estimation. The paper uses certain kernels for simplicity, but finding the optimal kernel could improve efficiency. 

5. Develop procedures to optimally aggregate or pool estimates across different boundary points. The paper focuses on pointwise estimation, but combining estimates efficiently across the boundary could provide more robust overall estimates.
