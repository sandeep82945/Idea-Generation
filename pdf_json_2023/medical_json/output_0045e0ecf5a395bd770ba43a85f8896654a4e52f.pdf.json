            "text": "Page 2/21\n1. Introduction Shark species have been successfully held in public aquariums around the world since 1864, with husbandry methods being increasingly more e cient and ethical over time (Smith et al. 2004). Numerous studies have been conducted, across taxa, investigating husbandry techniques (Matsumoto et al. 2017; Marin-Osorno et al. 2017), species biology (Ezcurra et al. 2017; Baylina et al. 2017), reproduction (Schaller 2006) and physiology (Ueda et al. 2017). Captive breeding is especially important in the case of endangered or endemic species, offering solutions to population decline (Smith et al. 2004). Like many catshark species, the pyjama shark (Poroderma africanum) is known to survive well in captivity with multiple displays in public aquariums around the world (Koob 2004; Montbach and Willis 2017). However, only one study was conducted in captivity, investigating the learning capacity of the species for feeding purposes (Ibid 2017).\nThe pyjama shark belongs to the family Scyliorhinidae and is endemic to South Africa, at depths shallower than 108 m (Ebert et al. 2021). Currently listed as least concern on the IUCN red list (Pollom et al. 2020), this species is not of economic importance, nevertheless, the population is impacted by bycatch in trawling and recreational shing (Attwood et al. 2011; da Silva et al. 2015). Males reach sexual maturity at 75.0\u201391.0 cm and females at 75.0\u201393.0 cm in total length (Lt; Dainty 2002; Ebert et al. 2021). Although recapture rate studies and abundance surveys have been conducted using mark-recapture and baited remote underwater videos (De Vos et al. 2015; Grusd et al. 2019, T. Johnson et al. unpubl data 2023), little is known about the reproductive biology and growth of this species. As an oviparous species, the incubation period is 164 days after egg laying, and the Lt at hatching is estimated to be 14 cm (von Bonde 1948; Ebert et al. 2021), but detailed information is lacking because only one fertilized egg has\nPage 3/21\nbeen observed. While this species is not at risk of extinction, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms of growth and development that can be applied in the event of a population decrease in the future, or to help conserve threatened species (Prohaska et al. 2013).\nUsing a comparative analysis of captive and wild pyjama sharks, this study aims to describe: (1) fertilization rate and incubation period of eggs; (2) morphometrics and growth; (3) age and size at maturity of females. This is the rst study to conduct analysis of morphometrics between male and female pyjama sharks and is also the rst study to consider differences in morphometrics between wild and captive Scyliorhinidae.\n2. Materials And Methods\n2.1. Aquarium rearing One male and one female pyjama shark, caught in the waters around Port Elizabeth, South Africa, arrived at the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan from a sh supplier in Taiwan on May 29, 2005. They were kept in a tank of 230 x 95 x D70 cm, with a water volume of 1.2 m3 and at a water temperature of 18\u00b0C. The male was 96.0 cm total length (Lt) and the female was 88.0 cm Lt upon arrival. Animals were fed the day after arrival and were considered to be in good health. In addition, on June 4, 2005 (seven days after the arrival), egg laying was observed for the rst time, followed by mating, suggesting that both individuals were mature. They were fed three times a week on a diet of capelin (Mallotus villosus), Japanese horse mackerels (Trachurus japonicus), black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and neon ying squids (Ommastrephes bartamii). Natural insemination occurred resulting in eggs being laid in the tank where adults were kept, and embryo development was con rmed 40 days after egg laying. Kruskal Wallis tests (H) were performed using RStudio with R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team 2022) to determine any signi cant differences between the mean number of overall eggs laid and the mean number of fertilized eggs laid between each month. Fertilized eggs and hatching pups were kept in cages in the same tank as the mature individuals. Neonates were fed daily from the day of hatching with Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), black tiger prawn without the shells, and neon ying squid lets. The pups were weighed (Wt; g) and measured for Lt (cm) on the day of hatching, and then at 10\u201330 day intervals. 2.2. Mark-Recapture Data was collected by the South African Shark Conservancy (SASC) over nine years (January 2014 - February 2023) but no sampling was conducted between March 2020 and January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sampling was weather dependent, thus not occurring daily, in the Walker Bay region, South Africa. Walker Bay is characterized by three different types of habitats (i.e., kelp, reef and sand) with sea surface temperatures ranging from 14 to 20\u00b0C. Sharks were caught either by shing (handline or rod and reel) or by hand while snorkelling. Handlines comprised 1.2 mm nylon mono lament line and debarbed circle hooks ranging in size from 6\u20190 to 12\u20190 to target various shark sizes. Hooks were baited with sardine (Sardinops sagax), Paci c saury (Cololabis saira), common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), or Cape\nPage 4/21\nHope squid (Loligo reynaudii). Bait canisters containing 1 kg of defrosted, crushed sardine were also deployed to attract specimens. Hand capture while freediving was conducted in water > 8 m deep. Captured sharks were held underwater in a soft mesh cage (30 mm mesh size, 600 mm diameter and 250 mm depth) for the duration of the dive session (~ 1 hour). This was deemed ethically suitable as catsharks are buccal pumpers and thus lack of movement does not cause metabolic stress (Ebert et al. 2021). All sharks were tagged using external dart tags (Dunlop et al. 2013). Upon capture, sex, Lt (cm) and Wt (g) were recorded. 2.3. Length-Weight relationship All the following analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 28.0 (IBM corp. 2021).\nThe length-weight relationship was determined for each sex, using the power function:\nW t = aLtb\nwhere Wt is the total weight of the shark, Lt is the total length of the shark, and a and b are constants (King 2013). Linear regressions were constructed for the natural log-transformed data and were analysed using a Gaussian ANCOVA general linear model to test for signi cance between the length-weight relationship of the sexes, as well as between aquarium reared and wild sharks. A coe cient t-test was performed to test the null hypothesis of isometric growth (H0: b = 3) in males and females using the equation:\nwhere SEb is the standard error of the slope (Morey et al. 2003). Values above and below 3 equal positive and negative allometric growth respectively (Tesch 1968). 2.4. Growth rate The following analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 28.0 (IBM corp. 2021) with respect to captive sharks and RStudio with R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team 2022) with respect to wild sharks.\nFor aquarium reared sharks, the Lt and Wt at hatching and Spearman rank correlation coe cients (rs) of Lt and Wt to days of incubation were determined and compared with the growth rates of the pyjama sharks using the von Bertalanffy growth formula (VBG) shown below (Haddon 2011):\nWhere L\u221e is asymptotic length (cm), k is the growth coe cient, t is age (years) and t0 is the theoretical age at length 0 cm (years). Signi cance between the parameters of males and females were compared using the Kimura Likelihood Ratio (\ud835\udc652) (Kimura 1980):\nt = b \u2212 3\nSEb\nLt = L\u221e(1 \u2212 e \u2212(k(t\u2212t0)))\nPage 5/21\nWhere N is the number of total measurements and ResSS is the residual sum of squares of each parameter. Constrained refers to the value of each parameter remaining unchanged from that of the values obtained from VBG of males and females combined.\nFor wild caught sharks, an age estimate model was constructed from the von Bertalanffy growth function (von Bertalanffy 1938):\nwhere L\u221e was the asymptotic Lt (cm), L0 was the Lt at birth (cm), k was the curve parameter constant, and t was the estimated age. As per the method described by Dureuil et al. (2022) a growth estimate simulation was carried out using the TMB and tmbstan packages (Kristensen et al. 2016; Monnahan and Kristensen 2018). The simulation used a Bayesian formulation of the Fabens method (Fabens 1965; see Dureuil et al. 2022 for details) to determine true estimates for L\u221e and k. This required the Lt at each capture and the time at liberty (\u0394t) between each capture. Prior to running the simulation Lmax was estimated as 106 cm as per Ebert et al. (2021) and L\u221e was estimated from its relationship to the maximum length (Froese and Binohlan 2000) using the equation:\nNegative growth rates due to measurement error, and growth rates of \u2265 0.1 cm/day were excluded as outliers. Using the rearranged VBG equation, t0 could then be estimated (Haddon 2011).\nTo compare the VBG growth parameters between captive and wild-caught sharks, an adapted version of the phi-Munro growth performance index was used (Munro and Pauly 1983):\nThis adaptation took the upper and lower 95% con dence intervals of k and L\u221e into account for the calculation, reducing levels of bias. In this instance ku and kl are the upper and lower bounds of k respectively, while L\u221e u and L\u221e l are the upper and lower bounds of L\u221e.\n3. Results\n3.1. Fertilization rate and incubation period of eggs During the study, egg laying was observed throughout the year, with the rst female introduced to the site laying 98 eggs between 2005 and 2007, and 3 hatched females laying 221 eggs between 2013 and 2020 (Table\u00a01). Of the 319 eggs, embryonic development was con rmed in 60 eggs within 40 days of laying,\nx 2 = \u2212N \u2217 ln\nResSSnoconstraints\nResSSconstrained\nLt = L\u221e \u2212 (L\u221e \u2212 L0)e \u2212kt\nlogL\u221e = 0.044 + 0.9841 \u2217 log(Lmax)\n\u03a6\u2032 = (log10ku + (2 \u2217 log10L\u221eu )) +( log10kl + (2 \u2217 log10L\u221el ))\n2\nPage 6/21\nand the fertilization rate was 18.8%. The number of eggs laid tended to be higher in March and November, and a greater proportion of eggs were fertilized between March and August (Fig.\u00a01) however the differences were not signi cant (Kruskal-Wallis test, H11 = 8.767, p = 0.459 and H11 = 2.625, p = 0.854 respectively). Of the 60 fertilized eggs, 24 hatched, excluding those that were considered dead (n = 36) because embryos stopped developing. The sexes of newly born individuals were 6 males and 18 females (Table\u00a01). The mean incubation period (\u00b1 standard error [SE]) was 238 \u00b1 4.8 days, mean Lt of hatchlings (\u00b1 SE) was 14.65 \u00b1 0.26 cm, and the mean Wt (\u00b1 SE) was 16.6 \u00b1 0.8 g (Table\u00a01). No correlation was observed between days of hatching and Lt (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.309, p = 0.141) or between days of hatching and Wt (Spearman rank correlation, rs = 0.026, p = 0.904).\nPage 7/21\nTable 1 Fertilized eggs laid by captive pyjama sharks between 2005 to 2020.

Morphometrics and growth With respects to the captivity reared sharks, a total of 1140 different measurements were used across 27 different sharks. This included 6 males (292 measurements) and 21 females (848 measurements). Male sharks exhibited negative allometric growth (b = 2.889 [SE = 0.015], t291 = -7.549, p < 0.001) with the power function Wt = 0.009Lt2.889 (Fig.\u00a02a; r2 = 0.993, p < 0.001) while female sharks exhibited isometric growth (b = 2.985 [SE = 0.008], t847 = -1.951, p = 0.051) with the power function Wt = 0.006Lt2.985 (Fig.\u00a02c; r2 = 0.995, p < 0.001). The ANCOVA revealed a signi cant difference between the regression slopes of each sex (F1 = 39.854, p < 0.001). The same number of measurements were used for VBG analysis as with length-weight analysis for captive sharks. Male sharks were represented by the growth function Lt = 108.599(1-\u212e(\u22120.212(t+0.546))) and female sharks were represented by the growth function Lt = 113.048(1- \u212e(\u22120.179(t+0.439))) (Fig.\u00a03). Kimura likelihood ratio analysis revealed no signi cant difference in L\u221e or t0 between male and female sharks (\ud835\udc6521 = 3.066, p = 0.080 and \ud835\udc6521 = 2.743, p = 0.098 respectively) though a\nPage 9/21\nsigni cant difference was found in k as well as the overall slope of the curves (\ud835\udc6521 = 9.525, p = 0.002 and \ud835\udc6523 = 40.666, p < 0.001 respectively).\nWhile Lt was recorded for all wild sharks caught, Wt was only recorded for a total of 99 wild-caught sharks and only two sharks were recaptured, giving a total of 101 different measurements. This included 54 males (56 measurements) and 45 females (equivalent measurements). As with captive sharks, males exhibited negative allometric growth (b = 1.843 [SE = 0.218], t53 = -5.319, p < 0.001) with the power function Wt = 0.861Lt1.843 (Fig.\u00a02b; r2 = 0.563, p < 0.001) and female sharks exhibited isometric growth (b = 2.861 [SE = 0.123], t44 = -1.128, p = 0.259) with the power function Wt = 0.010Lt2.861 (Fig.\u00a02d; r2 = 0.924, p < 0.001). There was also a signi cant difference between the regression slopes of each sex (F1 = 15.582, p < 0.001). With respect to wild sharks, 12 measurements of \u0394t were used for males and 22 measurements of \u0394t were used for females for the VBG. Male sharks were represented by the growth function Lt = 106.018(1-\u212e(\u22120.130(t+1.088))) and female sharks were represented by the growth function Lt = 106.052(1-\u212e(\u22120.074(t+1.917))) (Fig.\u00a03). Unfortunately, Kimura likelihood ratio analysis could not be used as age was estimated from the nal equation rather than being available prior to the analysis. However, there was a signi cant level of overlap with the 95% con dence intervals of both L\u221e and k which suggested very little variance between the curves (Fig.\u00a04).\nA comparison of the length-weight relationship for captive and wild-caught male sharks revealed a signi cant difference between the regression slopes (Fig.\u00a02; F1 = 48.022, p < 0.001), though no such difference was found with female sharks (Fig.\u00a02; F1 = 1.190, p = 0.276). VBG could not be statistically compared between captive and wild-caught sharks due to estimation of age for wild-caught sharks. However, the growth performance index was lower in wild sharks and was also lower in females compared to males of their respective location (captive males: = 3.395; wild males: = -0.686; captive females: = 3.358; wild females: = 0.418). A lack of overlap between the 95% con dence intervals of both L\u221e and k between the captive and wild-caught female sharks suggested a difference between the curves (Fig.\u00a04). No such difference was found between the males. 3.3. Age and size at maturity of females Fertilized eggs had been observed since 2005, but no eggs were laid from 2008 to 2012 due to the death of the rst mature female. Fertilized eggs were found again from June 2013, laid in the tank occupied by four females born between 2006 to 2008 (individual numbers 2, 3, 10, and 14 in Table\u00a01). Based on the date of egg laying, one of these four females laid fertilized eggs in 2013, which suggests that they reached sexual maturity between approximately 1970 days (5.4 years old) and 2680 days (7.3 years old) after hatching. The sizes of those females, potentially sexually mature, ranged from 73.0 to 86.0 cm Lt and 2180 to 3800g Wt, when the rst egg was laid. The female (No. 20) hatched on January 14th 2015, laid only empty egg cases from May 27th 2021, 2325 days after hatching (6.4 years old). This female started laying egg cases containing mature egg yolks on August 29th 2021, 2419 days after hatching (6.6 \u03a6\u2032 \u03a6\u2032 \u03a6\u2032 \u03a6\u2032\nPage 10/21\nyears old) suggesting that maturity was reached but the animal might not be mating. The size at that time was 85.2 cm Lt and 3300g Wt.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Fertilization rate and incubation period of eggs Results are consistent with a previous study on wild pyjama sharks (Dainty 2002), based on differences in gonad development in mature females captured at the same time and the presence of ovarian follicles of different sizes in the ovaries, showing that this species can reproduce all year round.\nIn this study, the water temperature was kept at a constant 18\u00b0C and the mean incubation period for fertilized eggs was 238 days. This was 74 days longer than that described by von Bonde (1948). In the closely related leopard catshark (Poroderma pantherinum) the incubation period of fertilized eggs was found to decrease with increasing water temperature (Pretorius and Gri ths. 2013). As von Bonde (1948) did not record the temperature it could be inferred that there is an effect of temperature on this species\u2019 embryonic development. Similarly, Dainty (2002) observed a substantially longer incubation period (12 months) at 14\u2103 though it should be considered that the shark was trapped in the egg and likely subsisted on the yolk until being released manually. It should also be considered that oxygen concentration has been found to have a signi cant interactive effect with temperature on the development of small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) embryos (Musa et al. 2020). Therefore, it would be recommended that further studies should be performed to determine the effect of different environmental factors on pyjama shark embryonic development. 4.2. Morphometrics and growth The overall trend for growth in pyjama sharks within this study suggested isometric growth for females and negative allometry for males regardless of being captive or wild-caught. Previous studies have suggested that small-bodied sharks that exhibit little movement typically follow an isometric growth pattern (Irschick and Hammerschlag 2015; Ahnelt et al. 2020). Allometry in sharks is likely driven by habitat change (Gayford et al. 2023), therefore sexual segregation across habitat could be considered as the primary driver for negative allometry in males. It is thought that pyjama sharks sexually segregate across depth according to distribution analysis (T. Johnson et al. unpubl data 2023) with male sharks exhibiting natal dispersal towards deeper waters of up to 108 m, and females exhibiting greater levels of philopatric behaviour as is common in many shark species (Hueter et al. 2005). Considering that all the sharks used in this study were caught or reared in shallow water (< 30 m) it could be theorized that male pyjama sharks are not as strongly adapted to the shallow water environment causing negative allometry. This could be a result of several factors, such as the temperature gradient difference, as well as intersex dietary differences, as has been described in the small-spotted catshark (Rodr\u00edguez-Cabello et al. 2007; Gravino et al. 2010; Mnasri et al. 2012). Interestingly, wild-caught male sharks showed signi cantly greater negative allometry compared to captive male sharks, as well as much weaker correlation between\nPage 11/21\nlength and weight increase. While the cause of this is currently unclear, it can be theorized that the captive males may be better adapted as they were born into a stabilized environment and a consistent feeding regime.\nCaptive female sharks were found to express a signi cantly faster growth rate than captive male sharks although they did not attain a signi cantly greater asymptotic length. There is currently no literature available to corroborate differences between males and females of this species, though data from other Scyliorhinidae species suggests that this pattern is not universal within the family. For example, the blacktip sawtail catshark (Galeus sauteri) exhibits a greater growth coe cient in females (Liu et al. 2011), while the small-spotted catshark shows the opposite pattern (Ivory et al. 2004). However, without statistical analysis, it is di cult to ascertain whether these differences are signi cant. The growth performance index was somewhat lower in captive females compared to captive males, although the difference is minimal (0.037) suggesting little variance in growth performance. Currently there is a signi cant data gap concerning growth performance in catshark species between sexes, therefore it would be di cult to ascertain if growth performance would be expected to differ.\nObserving the 95% con dence intervals for wild caught individuals would suggest no clear intersex difference between asymptotic length and the growth coe cients. However, the growth performance index was much greater in female sharks with a difference of 1.104. Munro and Pauly (1983) suggested that grouping asymptotic length and the growth coe cient is much more robust when analysing differences in growth. Therefore, we should assume that the growth performance was poor for wild male pyjama sharks, as was also re ected by the length-weight relationship. As previously discussed, this was likely a result of a difference in environmental adaptations between males and females (Rodr\u00edguezCabello et al. 2007; Gravino et al. 2010; Mnasri et al. 2012).\nBoth asymptotic length and the growth coe cients for males and females were larger in captive sharks, a pattern also re ected by a greater growth performance index in captive sharks. Other populations of wild sharks showed substantial variance in these parameters, with a slow growth rate (k = 0.036) in sharks from six sites in the Western Cape (Dainty 2002) and a large asymptotic length (L\u221e = 117.8 cm) in sharks from Mossel Bay (Grusd 2017). This suggests that growth parameters can signi cantly differ even within the same geographical region. However, it should be considered that the sexes were not split within these studies and thus likely affected the results. There is currently a large data gap concerning the difference in growth between wild and captive populations of catsharks, although it has been suggested that other elasmobranchs often exhibit increased growth within captivity due to a stable feeding regime, and consistent temperature and dissolved oxygen levels (Wass 1971; Smith et al. 2004; Awruch et al. 2009; Fujinami and Tanaka, 2013). For example, the grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) have both expressed faster growth rates in captive populations (Wass 1971; Carrier and Luer 1990). However, it has been reported that there is no difference in growth rate between captive and wild individuals of the Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) (Branstetter 1987) and the bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo) (Parsons 1993) suggesting the pattern is not universal for all elasmobranchs. Therefore, it is recommended that further studies are conducted\nPage 12/21\nconcerning the growth rate of other Scyliorhinidae between wild and captive populations to determine any patterns within the family. 4.3. Age and size at maturity of females Regarding captive female maturity, the mature Lt of 73\u201389.5 cm in this study was consistent with Dainty (2002) and Ebert et al. (2021) who record Lt at maturity to be > 82 cm and 78 cm respectively. Considering that size at maturity is highly variable in many elasmobranch species, the large Lt range was expected (Ibid 2021). Maturity was reached between 5.4 and 7.3 years in captivity, while it was estimated to be more than 24 years in the wild (Dainty 2002). Considering that the growth performance and rate was faster in captive sharks, it can be assumed that maturity may be reached at an earlier age, as has been the case in other elasmobranch species. For example, the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus) has been found to reach sexual maturity at approximately 4.5 years in captivity, compared to approximately 9\u201310 years in the wild (Goldman 2002) However, it has been reported that there is no difference in age at maturity between captive and wild individuals in the reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) (Nozu et al. 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to consider that the age at maturity of captive and wild elasmobranchs may vary depending on the species and captive environment. 4.4. Conclusion This study determined the incubation period, size and growth at hatching, age and size at maturity of captive female pyjama sharks, which allowed for comparison of growth with wild populations. This is the rst study to examine fertilized eggs, hatching, and growth in the same individual of this species, and the results, together with the growth and estimated age of the wild population, allow us to estimate these parameters more accurately for wild individuals in the future. The reared individuals grew faster, and females matured earlier than wild individuals, but as with wild individuals, the growth patterns of reared individuals differed between sexes. This suggests that it is possible to infer the growth patterns of wild populations by following the growth of captive individuals of elasmobranchs and also. provides evidence that ex situ rearing of this species is effective. Overall, this study demonstrates that captive studies in aquariums can play an important role in inferring the ecology of wild individuals acting as a baseline study for other commonly aquaria bred elasmobranchs, especially with respect to other Scyliorhinidae.\nDeclarations Acknowledgments\nWe would like to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Brian Kot of City University of Hong Kong for his help in translating the gure captions in this paper into English.
