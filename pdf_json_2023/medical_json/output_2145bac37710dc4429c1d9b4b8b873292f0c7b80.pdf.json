It is used to treat nervous system diseases, similar to Chinese medicine cinnabar and Indian Ayurveda medicine Rasasindura. However, one of the key problems faced by Zuotai is that its indications are ambiguous. Our previous study found that Zuotai exhibited the activity of ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in a chronic mild stress model. However, due to the inherent limitations of animal models in simulating human disease, clear results often require more than one model for confirmation.\nMethods: Therefore, another depression model, chronic restraint stressed (CRS) mice, was used to validate the antidepression effect of Zuotai. Prophylactic treatment was conducted for 21 consecutive days while mice were subjected to chronic restraint stress.\nResults: It was observed that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS alleviated anhedonia, behavioral despair, stereotype behavior, and reduced exploratory and spontaneous movement in CRS mice. Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS also reversed the increases of stress hormone corticosterone (Cort) in serum and pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and brain, and increased the serotonin in cortex in CRS mice, with positive dose-effect relationship. The number of Ki67-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were slightly elevated in CRS mice treated with Zuotai; however, there was no statistically significant difference. Although Zuotai increased the total Hg concentration in main organs, the levels remained below those needed to result in observed adverse effect, at least for kidney and liver; and Zuotai showed no observed adverse effect on the brain histopathology, the cell proliferation in dentate gyrus, as well as the hippocampal and cortical organ coefficients."

            "text": "Depression is a common globalmental disorder, estimated to affect 3.8% of the population (World Health Organization, 2017). It has a serious impact on the patient\u2019s daily life, work, study, and family interactions, and at its worst can lead to suicide (World Health Organization, 2017). Although great progress has been made in the treatment of depression, the remission and response rate of depression still need to be improved due to the high heterogeneity of depression and the complexity of the etiologies (Malhi andMann, 2018). A clinical study by the National Institute of Mental Health found that even after treatment with first, second, third, and fourth acute treatment steps, the overall cumulative remission rate was only 69% (Rush et al., 2006). In addition, a systematic reviewofmid- and long-term outcomes reported that up to 80% of patients with treatment-resistant depression relapsed within a year of achieving symptom remissions (Fekadu et al., 2009). Therefore, there is still a need to develop new antidepressant therapies, including pharmacotherapies.\nTraditional medicine is an importantly potential alternative for discovering new antidepressant drugs. Tibetanmedicine is characterized by regional and easy accessibility, and affordability in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region. Zuotai is a classic mineral-herbal mixture containing about 54% mercuric sulfide (HgS) in Tibetan medicine. It was first recorded in the book \u201cFour Medical Classics\u201d in the 8th century and is called by Tibetan medical practitioners as the \u201cKing of Nectar Essence\u201d. Zuotai is commonly used as a key component in many compound preparations for treating nervous system diseases (Yan et al., 2007; Wang, 2010; Li et al., 2015a), and some its compound preparations (such as Qishiwei Zhenzhu Wan, Renqing Changjue, Renqing Mangjue, et.al.) are included in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 Version). In the Indian Ayurvedic medicine system, mercuric sulfide drugs (such as Rasasindura) are often used to treat nervous disorders, insomnia, and tongue hemiplegia (Kamath et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019). According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, cinnabar (\u03b1-HgS \u226596%) improves moods, soothes nerves, and the improves eyesight, and its comound preparations are clinically used to treat insomnia, low mood, restlessness, palpitations, and epilepsy (Pharmacopeia Committee, 2015; Liu et al., 2018). Moreover, animal studies showed that cinnabar significantly alleviated the behavioral despair state of mice, using the forced swimming and tail suspension tests, increased the distance of movement in the open field test (Dai et al., 2014), and altered brain tissue serotonin (5-HT)\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\nlevels (Wang et al., 2007). Our latest study showed that metacinnabar (\u03b2-HgS) enhanced the effects of antidepressants in mice (Qiao et al., 2022). Moreover, clinical studies have reported that Zhusha Anshen Wan, a cinnabar compound preparation, ameliorated the symptoms of patients with depression (Dong, 2008; Wu, 2015). We therefore hypothesized that HgS-containing Zuotai had a similar effect as cinnabar in relieving depressive symptoms.\nAdvances in the pathophysiological understanding of depressive disorder have revealed the multi-faceted neuro-biomechanical features of this disorder. The monoamine neurotransmitter hypothesis states that depression is caused by the functional deficiency of monoamine neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, so almost all clinical antidepressant drugs used so far have been developed based on this hypothesis (Cosci and Chouinard, 2019). The neuroendocrine hypothesis states that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is closely related to the occurrence and development of depression, and it has been clinically found that patients with depression had hyperfunction of the HPA axis, with antidepressant treatment restoring it to normal levels (Pariante and Lightman, 2008). The important roles of peripheral inflammatory responses and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of depression have also been characterized and confirmed, such as elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and activated microglia in the brain of patients with clinical depression. A similar inflammatory activation has been found in animal models of chronic stress, and inflammatory stimuli also induced depression-like behaviors in animals (Remus and Dantzer, 2016). In addition, depression was often accompanied by abnormal neuroplasticity that occurred in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and other limbic systems (Patel et al., 2019). Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between the antidepressant effects of antidepressants and neuroplastic responses (Yang et al., 2020). The role of neuronal plasticity, at least in part, is mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling (Yang et al., 2020). Our previous study found that Zuotai had antidepressant activity in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice, and was involved in the regulation of the HPA axis and monoamine neurotransmitters (Zhao et al., 2018). There is a consensus that each animal model has more or less inherent limitations in terms of face validity, construct validity, and predictive validity, and almost any single animal model cannot fully simulate the characteristics of human depression (S\u00f6derlund and Lindskog, 2018; Planchez et al., 2019a). Therefore, it often requiresmore than onemodel for validation, and it is still unclear whether the antidepressant activity of Zuotai also involves regulation of neuroinflammation and BDNF.\nWe therefore used another classic animal model of depression, the chronic restraint stress model, for further verification, and to characterize the alleviating effects of Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS on the mood-like behaviors of chronic restraint-stressed mice, including interventions on stress hormone, inflammation, BDNF, monoamine neurotransmitters, and hippocampal histology. In addition, mercury is a naturally occurring heavy metal that is ubiquitous in the environment. Although mercuric sulfide used in traditional medicine is insoluble (Ksp of \u03b2-HgS is 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221252; Ksp of \u03b1-HgS is 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221253) (Dean, 1999) and is considered by EPA to be very difficult to be absorbed by gastrointestinal tract (EPA, 2002), there is a need to be concerned about the potential risk of mercury exposure. So, in this study, we also determined the total Hg in the brain and other major organs of mice.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Zuotai\nZuotai (No. 20110705, Tibetan Pharmaceutical Factory, Tibet Autonomous Region, China).\nGenerally, Zuotai contains around 54% HgS and 40% elemental sulfur (S8), as well as small amounts of other substances such asminerals and organic matters (Yan, 2007; Yan et al., 2007;Wang et al., 2010b; Xia et al., 2010; Yan andMa, 2010; Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015b; Li et al., 2015a; Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018). Zuotai is a black ultra-fine powder preparation obtained by special processing technology from elemental sulfur (S8), elemental mercury (Hg\n0), eight-metals (gold, silver, red copper, brass, bronze, iron, zinc, lead) ash, and eight-minerals (gold ore, silver ore, limestone (Quan Shi), magnetite, pyrite, realgar, orpiment, biotite) ash with a mass ratio of 50, 50, 0.333, and 0.333 (Gama et al., 1990; Xia, 2010). Before grindingmercury (Hg0) and sulfur (S8)together, it is necessary to wash them multiple times with the solutions of plant-based auxiliary materials to remove the impurities and purify mercury (Hg0) and sulfur (S8). These plant-based auxiliary materials include Rhizoma alpinae officinarum (Alpinia officinarum Hance), garlic (Allium sativumL.), black pepper (Piper nigrumL.), biota seed (Fructus piperis Longi), seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) paste, highland barley sour wine, Fructus terminaliae Billericae, Fruit of medicine Terminalia (Terminalia chebula Retz.), rapeseed oil, Acorus gramineus, emblic (Fructus phyllanthi), Herba dinathi, Apocynum venetum L., Aconitum pulchellum, Lalang grass Rhizome, castor oil, croton oil, black sesame oil, and pomegranate seed decoction. Then, equal quantities of cleaned mercury and sulfur are put together (here excess sulfur ensures the full reaction of elemental mercury), and grind them thoroughly to obtain a black powdered reaction product. 100 parts of the aforementioned reaction product, add 0.333 parts of eight-metals ash and 0.333 parts of eight-minerals ash to obtain a final mixture called Zuotai (Gama et al., 1990; Xia, 2010).\nThe Zuotai sample used in this study was determined by X-ray diffractometers (XRD, X\u2019 per Pro, PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) and automatic direct mercury analyzer (DMA-80, Milestone S.r.l., Milan, Italy). We found that the main components in this Zuotai sample were cubic crystal mercuric sulfide (\u03b2-HgS) and elemental sulfur (S8) as shown in Figure 1 (Li et al., 2015a). Based the chemical form of Hg in Zuotai, here we further calculated the percentage of \u03b2HgS in Zuotai is 54.0928% \u00b1 0.1823% (n = 3) after assaying total Hg by using automatic direct mercury analyzer, which is consistent with the results reported in previous reports (Wang et al., 2010b; Xia et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021). The result is shown in Table 1."

As shown in Figures 5A, B, CRS stress caused a significant decrease in body weight growth in chronic restraint stress (CRS) model group, and the body loss was reversed by the administration of Zuotai or \u03b2-HgS. The sucrose preference test was used to evaluate anhedonia, a typical symptom of depression, to judge the responses of experimental animals to rewards (Dang et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 5C, CRS significantly reduced sucrose preference in mice (p < 0.001), and Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed the decreased sucrose preferences, especially in the CRS + Zuotai L (p < 0.01) and CRS + Zuotai H groups (p < 0.01). Even in the sucrose adaptation training stage, Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS were shown to reverse the reduced rate of sucrose preference induced by CRS (Figure 5D). The behavioral despair state of experimental animals is another key symptom similar to that of depression patients, which can be tested using the tail suspension test (Steru et al., 1985). As shown in Figure 5E, CRS significantly increased the immobility time (behavioral despair state) of the mice in the tail suspension test, while Zuotai significantly\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08\nalleviated the behavioral despair state (CRS + Zuotai L < 0.01, CRS + Zuotai M < 0.05, CRS + Zuotai H < 0.05). In addition, \u03b2HgS was also found to significantly reverse the immobility time (p < 0.001).\nPatients with depression are often accompanied by an anxious mood (Merckmanuals, 2022). Marble burying test is a classic method used to evaluate the anxiety or repetitive stereotyped behavior of animals. Rodents have an innate tendency to bury objects. In the marble burying test, the more beads buried by a mouse, the more serious the mouse\u2019s anxiety or\nobsessive-compulsive state (Deacon, 2009). As shown in Figure 5F, compared with the control group, the number of buried beads in the CRS model group increased significantly (p < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the CRS + Zuotai L (p < 0.001), CRS + Zuotai M (p < 0.05), CRS + Zuotai H (p < 0.05), and CRS + IMI groups (p < 0.01) all significantly decreased the number of buried beads.\nThese results suggested that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed CRSinduced depressive-like symptoms in mice including anhedonia, behavioral despair, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors.\nFIGURE 5 The effect of Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS on the depressive-like and anxious-like behaviors of chronic restraint-stressed (CRS) mice.

The standing number and activity of animals in the central area of open field are often considered to be indicators for exploring a novel environment (Walsh and Cummins, 1976; Choleris et al., 2001; Kalueff and Tuohimaa, 2004; Wang et al., 2011). As shown in Figures 6A\u2013C, CRS significantly reduced the standing times and movement distance in the central area, as well as percentage of the time staying in the central area of mice. Both Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed the reduction in the exploratory behaviors of mice, and showed a positive correlation between activity in the central\nFIGURE 6 Effect of Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS on the behaviors of mice in open field test (OFT) at day 24.

The time that animals stayed in corners of the open field was correlated with the depression-like avoidance behavior of animals. It was found that CRS increased the total time of mice in corners, although there was no statistically significant difference. Compared with the CRS + Vehicle group, the rest time in the corners in the CRS + ZuotaiH and CRS+\u03b2-HgS groups were significantly reduced (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) (Figure 6D). These results showed that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS alleviated the avoidance behaviors of CRS mice, and improved their exploratory behavior to new surroundings.\nThe total movement distance and the total rest time reflect the locomotor ability of mice (Walsh and Cummins, 1976). CRS reduced the movement distance of mice; however, the difference was not statistically significant (Figures 6E). Three doses of Zuotai significantly reversed the reduction of spontaneous activity in the mice caused by CRS in a dose-dependent effect relationship, and \u03b2HgS also showed a similar effect. Correspondingly, CRS significantly increased the rest time of the mice in the open field test, while Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS significantly alleviated this effect of CRS (Figures 6F). That suggests that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS improved locomotor tendency of mice.\n3.3 Zuotai reversed the elevated stress hormone level in depressive mice\nGlucocorticoid, cortisol for human or corticosterone (Cort) for mouse, in the blood is the commonly used hormone to assess\nstress level, and a key biomarker of the HPA axis, which has a direct correlation with the onset and development of depression (Nandam et al., 2020a). Clinical studies have reported that increased levels of cortisol in the blood of depression patients are associated with increased severity of depression and more suicide attempts (Nandam et al., 2020b; Nandam et al., 2020a; Choi et al., 2022). Significant Cort increases in the blood were also observed in various animal models of depression, such as chronic restraint stress, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), chronic social defeat (CSD), et al. (Planchez et al., 2019b; Nandam et al., 2020c). Therefore, this study used Cort to assess the effect of Zuotai on the stress level of CRS mice. The results showed that chronic restraint stress could significantly increase the serum Cort level of mice, and the anti-depression positive drug imipramine (IMI) sharply reversed this increase. Compared with the CRS +Vehicle group, the Cort levels in themice serum of CRS +Zuotai L group, CRS + Zuotai M group, and CRS + Zuotai H group were significantly decreased (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively), with a positive dose-effect relationship. Furthermore, we found that \u03b2-HgS was also able to reduce the serum Cort increase induced by chronic restraint stress under the same pure HgS dose as in CRS + Zuotai L group (p < 0.05). The result is shown in Figure 7. The above indicates that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS has potential to reduce the stress hormone level induced by chronic restraint stress in mice.\n3.4 Zuotai decreased the periphery and CNS inflammation of depressive mice\nThe development of depression is often accompanied by an increased inflammatory response, which increases levels of peripheral and central pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). This phenomenon has been observed in both clinical patients and animal models of depression, while antidepressant treatment can reduce the activated immune response in patients and model animals (Nesttis, 2021). Though the organ coefficient of the secondary immune organ, spleen, did not show a significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05, Figure 10J), we found that CRS significantly increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, in the blood (all, p < 0.01) and brains (all, p < 0.001) of mice, and the positive drug imipramine can significantly reverse the surge of these cytokines in blood and brains (Figures 8A\u2013F). Importantly, Zuotai not only decreased the levels of these cytokines in blood and brains, but also showed a positive correlation of dose-effect relationship (Figures 8A\u2013F). Moreover, \u03b2-HgS also decreased these cytokines in the blood and brains of CRS mice under the dose in this experiment (Figures 8A\u2013F). Besides, some studies have reported that cytokines enter the brain through the leaky areas of the blood-brain barrier, and directly act on the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby affecting consciousness and behavioral activities (Nesttis, 2021; Roohi et al., 2021). This indicates that the achieving antidepressant effect in the CRS mice of Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS may involve in down-regulating the inflammation in periphery and central neurological system (CNS).\nFIGURE 7 The Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed the increased corticosterone (Cort) in CRSmice serum (n = 8,mean \u00b1 SEM).

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclics, 5-HT reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can correct such dysfunctions (Elhwuegi, 2004). Due to depression poorly responding to potent dopamine agonists (Roohi et al., 2021), researchers pay more attention to the other two monoamines, serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) to find antidepression therapeutics. So, in this study, we investigated the effects of Zuotai on the two monoamine neurotransmitters (5-HT andNE) in the central nervous system of CRS mice. We found that CRS significantly reduced the content of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex of CRS mice, while imipramine, Zuotai, and \u03b2-HgS increased the levels of 5-HT (Figure 9A).We also found thatZuotai and \u03b2-HgS had similar boosting effects on another neurotransmitter, NE, which is involved in the development of depression, although this effect was not statistically significant (Figure 9B). Together, these results suggested that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed the reduction of monoamine neurotransmitters in the central nervous system caused by CRS.\nFIGURE 8 Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reduced theperiphery andCNS inflammation of CRSmice (A) The concentration of IL-1\u03b2 inmice serum at day 26 (n = 10,Mean\u00b1 SEM).

There are high levels of BDNF in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and basal forebrain region, which are critical for learning and memory. BDNF was found to decrease in the brains of both depression patients and depressive-model animals (Yang et al., 2020). Our study found that CRS decreased the levels of BDNF in the hippocampus, and the administration of imipramine, Zuotai and \u03b2HgS slightly reversed this decrease, although the results were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 9C)."

In addition, the organ coefficient is an important indicator used to reflect drug toxicity or side effect. Compared with the control group, the organ coefficients (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, spleen, kidney, liver) of mice in each test group showed no significant change, except for the increase of heart coefficients of the Zuotai M-treated group mice (p < 0.05). It was speculated that the abnormal increase in the heart coefficient in this group was due to the failure to remove the remaining coagulated blood clots in the heart during weighing, but this needs to be verified in the future. The above shows the Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS can cause a certain extent of increase in main organs under the doses in this experiment for 21 days consecutive oral administration. 3.7 Zuotai has no observed adverse effect on the H&E staining histology of hippocampus The patients with major depression disorder often had atrophy of hippocampus, accompanying changes in neuronal plasticity (Espinoza Oyarce et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020), and a few studies has found that\nFIGURE 10 The risk assessment of Hg from Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS on the brain, kidney, and other organs.

It has been sufficiently verified that the high level of mercury exposure (especially vapor Hg0 and organic mercury) can cause damage to the central nervous system, including hippocampus (EPA US, 1997; WHO, 2008; ATSDR, 2022). In this study, we have found thatZuotai and \u03b2-HgS could cause a certain extent of Hg increase in hippocampus, which probably posed a risk to cause pathological injury. Therefore, here we examined hippocampus histology by using H&E staining. The result shows that there were no obviousmorphology changes in the CRS mice hippocampus, compared with the control group (Figure 11), which is distinct from the literature reported (Yun et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2015). Compared with control and CRS groups, Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS did not cause markedly pathological changes in mice hippocampal (Figure 11). The histological characteristics in all groups are the following: the dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 of hippocampus had a clear contour; neurons were arranged regularly, and pyramidal cells and granule cells had normal sizes; the granule cells were slightly increased in some areas, but cell morphology had no obvious abnormality; there was no interstitial edema, and some small blood vessels were dilated; vascular endothelial cells did not show proliferation (Figure 11). Besides, the organ coefficient of mice hippocampus in the CRS + Vehicle group decreased slightly when compared with the control group, and that was mildly reversed by Zuotai, although the results were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Figure 10H). Therefore, Zuotai has no observed adverse effect on the H&E staining histology of hippocampus and the hippocampus coefficient. 3.8 Zuotai has no obvious effect on the decreased newborn cells in dentate gyrus caused by chronic restraint stress The dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus is one of the few brain regions in adult mammals, including human, that have the ability to regenerate neurons throughout life (Zamproni et al., 2021). The neuronal regeneration in dentate gyrus is sensitive to a variety of environmental factors and stimulus factors (Kuhn et al., 1996; Kempermann et al., 1997; Gould et al., 1998; Van Praag et al., 1999). And, experimental stress (physical or psychological) has been shown to quantitatively inhibit the formation of new cells in the mammalian dentate gyrus (Gould et al., 1997; Gould et al., 1998; Tanapat et al., 1998), and both acute and chronic stress treatment procedures also decreased cell proliferation (Fuchs et al., 1997). As a classic biomarker for detecting cell proliferation ability in tissues, Ki67 was used to explore the effect of Zuotai on the neuronal regeneration of dentate gyrus. It was found that compared with the control group, the number of Ki67 positive cells in the dentate gyrus\nFIGURE 11 Influence of Zuotai on the H&E staining histology ofmice hippocampus.

Then, compared with the CRS + Vehicle group, CRS + IMI group had a significant increase of Ki67 cells in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.05), and although the three Zuotai-treated groups (with order of CRS + Zuotai L group > CRS + Zuotai M group> CRS + Zuotai H group) and CRS+\u03b2-HgS group also increased the number of Ki67 positive cells in the dentate gyrus to a certain extent, there were no statistical difference (p > 0.05). Therefore, Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS show no obvious effects on the cell proliferation of the dentate gyrus in chronic restraint stress mice. The result is shown in Figure 12."

In view of the unmet demand for the treatment of depression, identifying new antidepressants from traditional medicines is an important approach. Our previous study has reported that Zuotai alleviated depression-like behaviors in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model (Zhao et al., 2018). Present study used another depression model, chronic restraint stress model (CRS), to further validate the previously reported findings. Through behavioral\nFIGURE 12 Influence of Zuotai on the Ki67 (cell proliferation marker) positive cells in mice dentate gyrus (DG) at day 22.

The elevation of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) caused by CRS was reduced, and the decrease of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex and BDNF in the hippocampus induced by CRS was also increased. In addition, Zuotai and \u03b2HgS were found to increase the mercury concentration in the hippocampus, cortex, spleen, kidney, liver, heart, and muscle with a positive dose-effect relationship; however, histopathological examinations did not find a significant difference in the hippocampus between control and treated animals. The organ coefficients of hippocampus, kidney, spleen, and other organs also showed no significant difference.\nDepression Patients have the symptoms of persistent low mood, anhedonia, despair, and helplessness, slow thinking or action, and anxiety (Bentley et al., 2014; Merckmanuals, 2022), and are often accompanied by low functioning of monoamine neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (Elhwuegi, 2004). Many animal models have been developed to simulate clinical symptoms of depression. For example, chronic restraint stress model animals display anhedonia, behavioral despair, reduced exploring curiosity, repetitive stereotyped activities, and decreased spontaneous movements, and anti-depressive drugs can reverse these changes (Ulloa et al., 2010; Chiba et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2016). In this study, we treated chronic restraint-stressed mice with Zuotai or \u03b2-HgS, and these behaviors in the model mice were reversed. And, similar antidepression-like behaviors effects of Zuotai, \u03b2-HgS and cinnabar also were observed in CUMS model mice (Zhao et al., 2018), CRS + CUMS model mice (Qiao et al., 2022), and normal mice (Dai et al., 2014), respectively.\nThe insufficiency of monoamine neurotransmitters plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. 5-HT has the effect of improving mood, and increasing enthusiasm. It is mainly synthesized by 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and then projected to certain brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum (Frazer and Hensler, 1999). Deficiency of 5-HT results in low mood, anxiety, and lack of motivation and willfulness (Mohammad-Zadeh et al., 2008; Celada et al., 2013; \u015alifirski et al., 2021). We here found that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reversed the reduction of 5-HT in the brain cortex of CRS model mice. Our previous study also found that Zuotai reversed the reduced 5-HT level in the brain cortex of CUMS model mice (Zhao et al., 2018), and \u03b2-HgS enhanced the brain cortex 5-HT increase induced by antidepressant (sertraline) in the CRS + CUMS model mice (Qiao et al., 2022). However, there also have reports that cinnabar (\u03b1-HgS) suppressed 5-HT levels in the whole brain of normal C56BL/6 mice (Wang et al., 2007). We speculated that the possible reasons for this difference are the health or disease status of mice, drug dose, the distribution heterogeneity of 5-HT in brain, mice strain, or others. Besides, norepinephrine (NE) is another important psycho-emotional monoamine neurotransmitter, which is mainly synthesized by NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, and projected to the cerebral cortex, limbic forebrain, and hypothalamus through fibers of the ascending projection system (Benarroch, 2009; Ross and van Bockstaele, 2021). In this study, we found that the NE level had an increase tendency in the brain cortex of\nZuotai and \u03b2-HgS group mice compared with CRS group, but there is no statistical significance. This conflicts with our previous study based on the CUMS model in KMmouse (Zhao et al., 2018). We previously found that Zuotai reversed the reduced levels of NE in the cortex in CUMS mice (Zhao et al., 2018), and \u03b2-HgS had same effect in CRS + CUMS mice (Qiao et al., 2022). The reason for this difference may be due to the different backgrounds of NE in the two models, because previous study found that CUMS significantly induced the reduction of cortical NE in model mice (Zhao et al., 2018), while CRS was not found to reduce NE in the present study. In conclusion, the improvement of depression-like behaviors of the CRS model mice by Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS involved intervention of the central monoamine neurotransmitter system, including that of 5-HT.\nThe strong link between inflammation and depression has been confirmed by a growing body of evidence. Clinically, a considerable number of depression patients, especially those with treatmentresistant depression, not only have significantly increased peripheral inflammatory response markers (Nesttis, 2021; Beckett and Niklison-Chirou, 2022), but also exhibit activated inflammation states in the brain as confirmed by imaging examinations (Han and Ham, 2021). Additionally, all cytokines, brain trauma, certain vaccines, and exogenous immune toxins can cause depression-like symptoms in both humans and experimental animals (Felger and Lotrich, 2013; Bodnar et al., 2018). Moreover, CUMS, CRS, and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) can also trigger activation of peripheral and central immunities in animals, and antidepressant intervention is able to reduce the inflammation level (Han and Ham, 2021; Kitaoka, 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Previous studies have reported that inflammatory responses imposed an important impact on the brain and behavior, especially cortical neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems related to motivation, motor ability, anxiety, interest arousal, and vigilance (Miller et al., 2013). Increased peripheral blood inflammatory markers are associated with a connectivity decrease of reward circuits between ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which in turn correlated with increased anhedonia (Felger et al., 2016). For the neurotransmitter system, inflammation not only increases the expression and function of presynaptic reuptake pumps for serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, but also decreases tryptophan hydroxylase cofactors such as tetrahydro biopterin, thereby diverting tryptophan to synthesize kynurenine to reduce the synthesis monoamine transmitters (Miller et al., 2013; Suneson et al., 2021). Besides, inflammation-induced reduction of the synthesis and release of monoamine neurotransmitters (5-HT and dopamine) has been observed in humans and animals, and is directly associated with reduced motivation in animals (Miller et al., 2013; Felger and Treadway, 2017). Consistent with existing studies, we found that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS reduced the levels of inflammatory markers (IL1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) in CRS mice. Based on above, we hypothesize that the improvement of depressive-like behaviors by Zuotai and \u03b2HgS probably also was achieved by decreasing the inflammation induced by CRS, thus alleviating the dysfunctions of neural circuits and the monoamine neurotransmitter system.\nBDNF is a key regulator for neuronal plasticity in the brain, which has been increasingly associated with rapid antidepressant effects. Preclinical and clinical studies have reported that impaired BDNF signaling through its receptor TrkB in the pathophysiology of\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org17\nmood disorders (Castr\u00e9n and Monteggia, 2021). BDNF expression decreased in the postmortem brain samples of depressed patients, especially in the hippocampus and amygdala, while antidepressant treatment increases BDNF in the brain (Dwivedi, 2013; Castr\u00e9n and Monteggia, 2021). Stressed rodents had an abnormal/malfunctional state of synaptic plasticity in cortical brain regions (Patel et al., 2019). Ketamine exerted rapid antidepressant effects through improving BDNF-related synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Castr\u00e9n and Monteggia, 2021). In addition, inflammation is related to the reduction of BDNF in central nervous system. Specifically, inflammation can promote tryptophan production, the precursor of 5-HT, to synthesize kynurenine, which is then metabolized to quinolinic acid and leads to the increase of neurotransmitter glutamate. Excess glutamate has been proven to reduce BDNF and cause excitotoxicity (Castr\u00e9n and Monteggia, 2021). We found that Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS decreased inflammation caused by CRS, and also increased BDNF in the hippocampus, although the results were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This effect is also observed in other studies using CRS mice (Chiba et al., 2012) or CRS rats used as model animals (Chiba et al., 2012). Taken together, the anti-depressant-like behavioral effect of Zuotai and \u03b2-HgS may involve up-regulating inflammation-related BDNF in the hippocampus, which is directly associated with neuronal plasticity and stability.\nIn spite of the anti-depressive potential found in this study, and considering that Zuotai is a mineral-herbal mixture containing \u03b2-HgS, it is necessary to evaluate its risk of mercury exposure. The mercury toxicity is closely related to its chemical form. Organic mercury (such as MeHg) has the greatest toxicity; gaseous elemental mercury, soluble inorganic mercury, and liquid elemental mercury have less toxicity, and insoluble inorganic mercury such as \u03b2-HgS has the least toxicity (Liu et al., 2018). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the solubility of HgS is extremely low (Ksp of \u03b2-HgS is 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221252;Ksp of \u03b1-HgS is 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221253 (Dean, 1999) and difficult to be absorbed by the body (EPA, 2002; Registry, 2003), and its toxicity is very low (Liu et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). We found that Zuotai increased total Hg levels in the brain (cortex and hippocampus), kidney, liver, spleen, heart, and muscle in a dose-dependentmanner; theHg concentration in the kidney was the highest among organs and tissues, and the highest renal Hg concentration (202.88 \u00b1 73.577 ng/g) was in Zuotai high-dose group (607 mg/kg, i.g. for 21 days). For inorganic mercuric salt, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) reported that the kidney is the uppermost accumulation organ, with 40%\u201350% of the whole body burden of Hg, so kidney is extreme sensitive to inorganic mercuric salt; the following accumulated organ for inorganicmercuric salt is liver, with 10%\u201320% of the whole body burden of Hg (ATSDR, 2022). The EPA reported that the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) dose of mercuric chloride after 6-month oral administration in B6C3F1 mouse was 5 mg/kg day (namely, 3.7 Hg mg/kg day), and the corresponding total Hg concentrations in kidney and liver were 36,100\u201340,600 ng/g and 2,980\u20133,380 ng/g, respectively (National Toxicology Program, 1993; EPA US, 1997). Yang et al. reported that the total Hg concentrations in the kidney of SD rats after 6-month Zuotai (dose 53.4 mg/kg day) administration were 252.4 \u00b1 152.6 ng/g and no damage of kidney and liver was observed by the serum indicators of kidney function, H&E staining, and organ coefficient (Yang et al., 2004). In our study, the\nhighest renal Hg concentration and liver Hg concentration in the CRS mice treated with high-dose Zuotai were 202.88 \u00b1 73.58 ng/g and 28.05 \u00b1 4.59 ng/g respectively, which were lower than that in the above reports. Besides, present study found Zuotai had no observed adverse influence on the H&E staining histopathology in brain, the cell proliferation ability in dentate gyrus, and the organ coefficients (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, kidney, liver, spleen) in CRS mice. The result is consistent with the reports that Zuotai or HgS toxicity were far less than others mercury chemical forms (Liu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Summarily, the Hg concentration in organs from Zuotai at least in kidney and liver was still within the safe range under the doses and experimental duration used in this study, although Zuotai increased the concentration of Hg in these organs in a certain extent. And, Zuotai has not obviously observed adverse effect on brain under the same experimental condition.\nThere still are some limitations in this study. 1) We only tested monoamine transmitters in the cortex and BDNF in the hippocampus. Considering the spatial heterogeneity of these factors in the brain, further testing of these indicators, as well as their related receptors and synthetic or metabolic enzymes is warranted to better understand the antidepressant mechanism. 2) In this study, only H&E staining and Ki67 IHC staining were conducted, so it probably is more reliable if other staining methods (Nissl staining, Bielschowsky silver staining, IF, et al.) were applied. 3) It is known that neuroendocrine pathways, such as the HPA axis, have an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Here we just assayed the stress hormone Cort for assessing the mice stress level, so how Zuotai impacts on the neuroendocrine metabolism is still unknown. 4) It has been found that tryptophan, the precursor of 5-HT synthesis, diverts to the kynurenine synthesis pathway, which mediates the effect of inflammation on neuropsychology and behavior. We just showed that Zuotai improved the inflammatory state of the CRS mice and upregulated 5-HT; however, the detailed regulatory mechanisms are still unclear.\nIn conclusion, Zuotai exhibited an effect on alleviating the depressive behaviors in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model, accompanying with reversing the elevated stress hormone and the activated peripheral and cerebral inflammation, and increasing the monoamine neurotransmitter in brain. Although Zuotai increased the mercury amount in organs, the Hg concentration was still within the safe range, at least in kidney and liver; and Zuotai showed no obviously observed adverse effect on brain under this experimental condition. Finally, this study suggests the potential feasibility of repositioning traditional medicines, particularly mineral-herbal mixtures like Zuotai."
