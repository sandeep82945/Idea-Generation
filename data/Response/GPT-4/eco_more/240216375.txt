Exploring the Role of Education and Awareness Programs on Insurance Uptake: Investigate how targeted education and awareness programs about low-probability, high-impact risks influence individuals' understanding, risk perception, and ultimately their willingness to pay for voluntary insurance. This research could examine the effectiveness of different types of educational interventions (e.g., workshops, online courses, simulations) in various cultural contexts.

Assessment of Flexible Financial Instruments Combined with Insurance: Study the impact of integrating insurance with other financial instruments, such as emergency loans or savings plans, on insurance uptake among different socioeconomic groups. This research could explore how such integrations influence the affordability and attractiveness of insurance products, particularly for those with financial constraints.

Influence of Digital Platforms and Technologies on Insurance Accessibility and Perception: Explore how the use of digital platforms and advanced technologies (e.g., mobile apps, artificial intelligence for personalized risk assessments, blockchain for transparency) affects the accessibility of insurance products and consumers' perceptions of insurance. This research could also investigate the role of social media in shaping attitudes toward insurance against low-probability, high-impact risks.

Comparative Studies on Mandatory vs. Voluntary Insurance Systems: Conduct comparative studies to assess the effectiveness of mandatory insurance systems against voluntary systems in providing coverage for low-probability, high-impact risks. This research could include case studies of different countries or regions, focusing on policy design, implementation challenges, and outcomes in terms of coverage rates and financial resilience.

Cross-Cultural Studies on Risk Perception and Insurance Demand: Carry out cross-cultural studies to deepen the understanding of how cultural factors influence risk perception and insurance demand. This research could examine the role of cultural dimensions such as uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and individualism versus collectivism in shaping attitudes towards insurance, using both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather insights across various cultural settings.
