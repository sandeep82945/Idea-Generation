    "abstractText": "Here we report the molecular self-assembly of hydroxido-bridged {Ln5Ni6} ((Ln = Dy, Y) metal clusters by reaction of enantiopure chiral ligands, namely (R/S)-(2hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-serine) with Ni and Ln precursors. Single-crystal diffraction analysis reveals that these compounds are isostructural sandwich-like 3d-4f heterometallic clusters showing helical chirality. Direct current magnetic measurements on {Dy5Ni6} indicates ferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Ni centers, whereas those on {Y5Ni6} denote that the Ni centers are antiferromagnetically coupled and/or magnetically anisotropic. MagnetoChiral Dichroism (MChD) measurements on {Dy5Ni6} and its comparison to that of {Y5Ni6} provide the first experimental observation of intense multi-metal site MChD signals in the Visible-Near Infrared region. Moreover, the comparison of MChD with Natural and Magnetic Circular Dichroism spectra unambiguously demonstrate for the first time that the MChD signals associated with the Ni d-d transitions are mostly driven by natural optical activity and those associated with the Dy f-f transitions are driven by magnetic optical activity.",

            "text": "Molecular materials showing synergy between chirality and magnetism offer a playground for the conception and the realization of functional materials for magneto-optical applications.1\u201310 For two decades, acentric molecular magnetic systems raise a constant interest in molecular magnetism for two main reasons.11 First, obtaining such materials, in particular in their two enantiomeric forms, represents a synthetic challenge. Second, these materials are at the origin of three physical properties, Magnetization-Induced Second Harmonic Generation (MSHG),2,12 Multiferroicity,9,13 and Magneto-Chiral Dichroism (MChD),7 that are unique examples of a real synergy between low-symmetry related properties and magnetism. This opens new avenues for magneto-optical memories, optoelectronic and spintronic devices. To reach these objectives, it is fundamental to have a comprehension of these phenomena at the microscopic level.\nMChD has been at first theoretically predicted14\u201318 and then experimentally observed 14,19\u2013\n23 as a bilinear effect that depends on the relative orientation (parallel or antiparallel) of the light wavevector k and the magnetic field pseudovector B, and the intrinsic chirality of the material. It results in an enantioselective differential absorption or emission of light whose intensity is magnetization-dependent. Therefore, it can be potentially used for the optical readout of magnetic information stored in magnetic materials.6,22 Indeed, it has been proposed, but not yet demonstrated, that an intense enough, close to 10%, MChD response might be used for the optical readout of magnetic data.6 A principle similar to what is currently done with circularly polarized light in magnetooptical disk based on conventional inorganic materials can be envisioned with MChD using molecular systems able to retain the magnetization and a simpler and easily accessible unpolarized light source. For this reason, this effect has been searched in molecule-based magnets below their ordering temperatures,3,24\u201326 and should further be investigated in lanthanide-based clusters exhibiting opened hysteresis cycles.\nFrom the 1990s, discrete molecular systems, called single-molecule magnets (SMMs)\nhave been proposed as potential materials from ultimate data storage and processing.27 Owing to the central role of magnetic anisotropy on SMMs properties, the research in this domain is currently dominated by lanthanide-based systems with a definitive emphasis on DyIII and TbIII containing systems.28,29 Chirality has been introduced in such systems in order to modulate their anisotropy30\u201334 whereas complementary spin-carriers,35\u201337 transition metal ions and/or radicals, were combined with lanthanide ions for a still elusive improvements of their magnetic properties.\nAlthough EuIII complexes were at the origin of the first experimental demonstration of\nMChD,19 to date, this light-matter interaction has been studied in a limited number of lanthanide-based systems.19,21,38,39 The association of 3d and 4f metal ions to study MChD appears particularly appealing since strong MChD signals were observed for both octahedrally coordinated NiII and for LnIII complexes.19\u201321,38,39 Nonetheless, a single heterometallic 3d-4f chiral cluster containing NiII and TbIII was investigated so far in the hard X-rays range of the electromagnetic spectrum revealing a low resolution MChD signal associated to the TbIII X-ray absorption.22 The absence of MChD signals at the NiII edge and temperature and magnetic field dependent studies strongly limits our understanding of such physico-chemical phenomenon.\nTo identify and understand the chemical and physico-chemical ingredients that drive\nstrong MChD signals in complex chiral molecular systems, here we present a complete study of new chiral heterometallic clusters featuring enantiopure ligands and NiII and DyIII ions, formulated as [Ln5Ni6(R/S-HL)6(Ac)3(\u00b53-OH)9(H2O)6]\u0387(ClO4)3\u038715H2O (Ln3+ = Dy3+ (1-(R/S)), Y3+ (2-(R/S)); H3L = (R/S)-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-serine)). Strikingly, the comparison of Natural and Magnetic Circular Dichroism (NCD and MCD) and MChD spectra allows an original and unambiguous attribution of the different MChD spectral features observed in these complex systems. The objective is to find design criteria for the preparation of chiral molecular materials highly responsive to MChD."

            "text": "Synthesis. Compounds 1 and 2 were obtained by reaction of the enantiopure chiral multidentate ligands (S)-H3L and (R)-H3L, prepared by reaction of (S)-/(R)-serine with o-vanilin (Scheme S1), with Dy(ClO4)3 and Ni(Ac)2 (Ac = acetate) under reflux conditions and controlled pH.\nHigh-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), performed\nstarting from both H2O and MeOH solution, revealed several clear isotope peaks framing a main peak at m/z = 1514.37 for 1 and m/z = 1374.34 for 2. Following the crystal structure determination presented thereafter, these are assigned to the [Dy5Ni6(HL)6(Ac)3(OH)9(ClO4)]2+ and [Y5Ni6(HL)6(Ac)3(OH)9(H2O)5(ClO4)]2+ species, respectively (Figure S1). All the observed peaks are consistent with the theoretical distributions (Figure S1-S3 and experimental section), and almost all show an intact metal-core frame of the cluster, indicating a remarkably high stability of the self-assembled {Ln5Ni6} clusters in solution.\nCrystal and Molecular Structure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the four chiral clusters 1-(R/S) and 2-(R/S) are isostructural (Table S1). To illustrate their structural features, herein we discuss in detail only the molecular structure of 1-(R).\n1-(R) crystallizes in the orthorhombic chiral space group P212121 and exhibits a cationic\ncluster core formulated as [Dy5Ni6(S-HL)6(Ac)3(\u00b53-OH)9(H2O)6]3+, three perchlorate counterions, and fifteen water molecules of crystallization (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Molecular structures of the {Dy5Ni6} cluster 1-(S) (left) and 1-(R) (right). Color codes: Ni II green; DyIII purple; O, red; C, gray; N, blue. Perchlorate counterions, water molecules of crystallization and hydrogens are omitted for graphical clarity.\nThe cationic cluster core contains five DyIII ions, six NiII ions, nine 3-OH-, six HL2-\nligands, three acetate ions and six aqua ligands. The five DyIII ions are linked together by three \u00b53-OH- bonds to form a [Dy5(\u00b53-OH)3]12+ core featuring a compressed trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) arrangement (Figure 2a and S4), which is rarely reported in 3d-4f clusters.40\u201342 The two Dy3+ ions that occupy the axial positions are nonacoordinated and are bridged together by three \u00b53-OH- with a distance of 3.48 \u00c5, which is remarkably shorter than twice of the covalent radius of the metal ions (1.90 \u00c5). The coordination sphere is completed by three additional \u00b53-OH-, each of them bridging an equatorial DyIII and a NiII ion, and by three carboxylate oxygens (monodentate) of three independent ligands. On the contrary, the three Dy3+ ions that occupy the equatorial positions are octacoordinated, and their coordination sphere completed by one \u00b53-OH- bond with the axial DyIII ions, two \u00b53-OH- bonds with an axial DyIII and a NiII ion, four oxygen atoms of two o-vanillin moieties that act in a 1,2-bis-bidentate mode, and one oxygen atom of an acetate ligand.\nFigure 2. (a) The structure of the TBP [Dy5(\u00b53-OH)3]12+ unit; (b) the [Dy5Ni6(\u00b53-OH)9]18+ unit; (c) the Ni3 triangular unit with terminal ligands; (d) the metal skeleton of [Dy5Ni6]. Color codes: C, grey; O, red; N, blue; Dy, violet; Ni, green.\nEach side edge of the [Dy5(\u00b53-OH)3]12+ TBP core is bridged with a Ni2+ ion through one\n\u00b53-OH-. Therefore, the [Dy5(\u00b53-OH)3]12+ core and six Ni2+ form a [Dy5Ni6(\u00b53-OH)9]18+ metalhydroxide cluster core (Figure 2b). Two groups of three adjacent Ni2+ ions connected by three syn-anti carboxylate bridges from three different HL2- ligand (Figure 2c) form a triangular plane that sandwiches the TBP arrangement of the DyIII ions (Figure 2d). Six chiral \u00b54-HL2- ligands chelate six Ni2+ ions stabilizing and protecting the cluster core (Figure 1). The octahedral coordination geometry around each NiII ion is completed by an aqua ligand. The Ni\u2013O, Ni\u2013N and Dy\u2013O bond distances in 1-(R) are 2.006(8)\u20132.118(8) \u00c5, 2.058(11)\u20132.101(11) \u00c5 and 2.235(10)\u20132.587(9) \u00c5, respectively, which agree well with those reported previously in NiII\u2013 DyIII clusters.41\u201343\nMagnetic Properties. The magnetic properties of microcrystalline samples of 1-(R) and 2-(R), whose phase purity was checked by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure S5), were\ninvestigated in the temperature range 2\u2212300 K under an applied magnetic field B = 0.1 T, and\nat T = 2 K in the magnetic field range 0.0\u22127.0 T.\nThe values of the magnetic susceptibility times the temperature (\u03c7MT) at room temperature\nare 78.5 and 7.4 cm3 mol\u20131 K, for 1-(R) and 2-(R) respectively (Figure 3), which are in good agreement with the calculated values of 77.8 and 7.2 cm3 mol\u20131 K for six uncorrelated NiII ions (S = 1, g = 2.2) and five uncorrelated Ln3+ ions (DyIII, J = 15/2, g = 4/3 (1); YIII, diamagnetic (2)). As the temperature is decreased from 300 to 20 K, the \u03c7MT values for 1-(R) and 2-(R) remain almost constant. Upon further lowering of the temperature, the \u03c7MT value of 2-(R) drops\nto reach 5.0 cm3 mol\u20131 K at 2 K, while the \u03c7MT value of 1-(R) goes through a little marked minimum before increasing to reach a maximum value of 114.1 cm3 mol\u20131 K at 2 K.\nFigure 3. T dependence of the MT at B = 0.1 T for 1-(R) and 2-(R). The inset shows the plots of M vs B at 2 K.\nThe behavior observed for compound 2 might arise from the Zero Field Splitting of the\nNiII centers and/or antiferromagnetic interactions between them. For 1, the increase observed at low temperature definitely denotes ferromagnetic interactions between metal ions which rapidly overcome the decrease provoked by Zero Field Splitting and Stark effects in NiII and LnIII centers, respectively. The complexity of the system precludes the possibility to finely quantify these conflicting phenomena.\nThe magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of 2-(R) at T = 2 K increases slowly\nat low magnetic fields, and reaches 12.65 B mol-1 at 7.0 T, which is close to the saturation value of 13.2 B mol-1 (MS = g S n; where S = 1, g = 2.2, n = 6) that is expected for a cluster core exclusively based on NiII paramagnetic ions (Inset of Figure 3). 1-(R) shows instead a magnetization that increases rapidly at low magnetic fields and then reaches 42.37 B mol-1 at 7.0 T (Inset of Figure 3). This value is much lower than 63.2 B mol-1, expected assuming MS = g S n + gJ J m (where S = 1, g = 2.2, for n = 6 NiII centers and J = 15/2, gJ = 4/3, for m = 5 DyIII centers). This is related to a significant single-ion magnetic anisotropy, and it is consistent with the non-superposition of the M versus B/T curves (Figure S6). Indeed, for a sample measured as a microcrystalline powder of randomly oriented crystallites, and assuming a mJ = 15/2 ground state doublet, the equation reported above does not provide a good estimation of the saturation magnetization. MS = 10 B mol-1 is only valid for the molecules having the magnetic anisotropy axis parallel oriented with respect to the magnetic field B while those oriented perpendicularly to B provide 0 B mol-1. The powder average for such a system gives\nMS = 5 B mol-1.44 Considering the coordination environment around the DyIII ions present within our molecular structure, they cannot be considered strongly axial, and this reduces the overall magnetic anisotropy. Assuming an average value of 6.0 B mol-1 for each DyIII ion, plus the 13.2 B mol-1 contribution of the six NiII ions (see above) provides a value of MS of 43.2 B mol-1, in agreement with the experiments. The complexity of the system (DyIII ions in different coordination environments and in different stoichiometric ratio combined with ferromagnetic interactions at low temperature) precludes a finer analysis.\nVisible and Near Infrared Light Absorption. The absorption properties of 1-(R) and 2-(S)\nwere investigated on oriented single crystals in the 420\u22121000 nm range for temperatures going\nfrom 290 to 4 K (Figure 4). The measurements were performed in transmission mode with the light wavevector k aligned parallel to the c crystallographic axis.\nFigure 4. Temperature dependence of the Vis-NIR absorption spectra (420-1000 nm) of a single crystal of 1-(R) (left) and 2-(S) (right). Inset shows a typical indexed single crystal of 1.\nAt room temperature, the electronic spectra of 1-(R) and 2-(S) show a common feature:\ntwo intense absorptions centered at ca. 600 and 1000 nm. In view of their energy, high absorption coefficient and their presence in both 1 and 2 with only a minor shift in the position of their maxima, these absorptions are assigned to the 3T1  3A2 and 3T2  3A2 spin-allowed electronic transitions of the octahedrally coordinated NiII sites, respectively (the ground state term is 3F).20,45,46 2-(S) shows an additional band with a much lower absorption coefficient at ca. 770 nm. In view of its energy and low absorption coefficient, this band, which is not well visible in 1-(R) as other bands are present in the same spectral range (see below), is assigned to the 1E  3A2 spin-forbidden electronic transition of the NiII sites.20,45,46 1-(R) shows three additional groups of multiple absorption bands characterized by low absorption coefficients at ca. 750, 800 and 900 nm. By lowering the temperature down to 4 K, these bands became well defined, evidencing their intrinsic sharp nature, their precise number and their intensity. These\nfeatures point out that these bands are clearly associated to f-f electronic transitions of the DyIII sites, its ground state spectroscopic level being 6H15/2. Because the energy of f-f transitions is only slightly affected by ligand field effects, these bands can be assigned on the basis of their energy as follows: the two absorption bands centered at ca. 750 nm are assigned to the 6F3/2  6H15/2 transition, the two absorption bands centered at ca. 800 nm are assigned to the 6F5/2  6H15/2 transition and the three absorption bands centered at ca. 900 nm to the 6F7/2/5H5/2  6H15/2 transition, which involves a mixing of the 6F7/2 and 5H5/2 excited states.47\u201353 The temperature lowering does not affect remarkably the absorption bands assigned to the NiII sites, with only a clear blueshift of ca. 20 nm observed for the band associated to the 1T1  3A2 for both 1 and 2, most probably due to the depletion of the vibrational levels of the ground state upon temperature lowering.\nBy taking advantage of the stability of the {Ln5Ni6} clusters in solution demonstrated by\nHR-ESI-MS, optical studies in methanol at room temperature have been performed. This was done for two reasons: first, to extend the investigation of the absorption properties in the Near Infrared range up to 1400 nm; second, to have access to the natural circular dichroism (NCD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of compounds 1 and 2. Indeed, these data are much more easily obtained working in diluted liquid solution than in the solid-state or in frozensolutions. These measurements in solution provide an isotropic circular dichroic response, representative of all possible orientations of the molecules with respect to the circularly polarized light wavevector, while working on oriented systems in the solid state provides information on the intrinsic anisotropic circular dichroism.54 Furthermore, irradiation of oriented systems in the solid state with circular polarized light might results in linear birefringence and dichroism that can interfere with the circular dichroic response. These different contributions can be revealed and isolated by specific procedures, such as a collection of spectra by rotating the sample around the optical axis, but this requires adapted experimental setups.55\nThe absorption spectra recorded in H2O and in MeOH solution show for both enantiomers\nthe same spectral features and the same absorption bands observed in the solid state (Figures S7 and S8). 1 does not show any variation in the positions of the maxima passing from solidstate to solution, regardeless the solvent, while 2 shows a redshift of ca. 30 nm for the NiII spinallowed transitions and a blueshift of ca. 20 nm for the spin-forbidden band, independently on the solvent used. Interestingly, by extending the investigation up to 1360 nm, we are able to identify additional groups of sharp bands at ca. 1100 and 1280 nm for 1, that are superimposed\non the broad low energy absorption of the NiII. These transitions, that are better resolved when investigating the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and MChD spectra (see below), are assigned to the 6F9/2/5H7/2  6H15/2 and 6F11/2/5H9/2  6H15/2 transitions of the DyIII sites, respectively.47\u201353 Another absorption split in two components and superimposed on a broad and intense high energy absorption is observed at ca. 450 nm. This is assigned to the 4F9/2  6H15/2 of the DyIII sites (Figures S7 and S8).47\u201353\nOverall, this highlights the higher NCD response of the NiII sites as compared to the NCD\nresponse of the DyIII sites. This emerges more clearly when the same measurements are performed under an externally applied magnetic field B = \u00b11.5 T. As shown in Figure 5b, the NCD spectrum of 2-(R/S) under magnetic field is basically the same collected at B = 0 T, while that of 1-(R/S) show additional signals at the same wavelengths of the absorption bands revealed through absorption spectroscopy in the solid state and in solution.\nThe relative intensity of the MCD signals follows the intensity of the originating\nabsorption bands, thus seems mainly driven by the intrinsic transition probability of the electronic transition themselves. However, the number and the shape of the MCD bands for each electronic transition deserve further comments. All of them have a similar shape, with two contributions of the same sign at high energy and one contribution of opposite sign at low energy. This is also the case for the transition at ca. 900 nm (see inset and details in the experimental section). These features are less evident for the two lowest energy transitions. One can wonder if their fine structure is due to a crystal field splitting of the originating electronic transition whose main energy is dictated by spin-orbit coupling, as commonly observed for lanthanides, or by the different coordination environments of the DyIII sites that are present in the chiral clusters 1-(R/S). To probe these two possibilities, we focused on the MCD signals related to the two electronic transitions that are associated to pure excited states, which are the best defined, 6F3/2  6H15/2 and 6F5/2  6H15/2. If the crystal field splitting of the excited state in (2J+1)/2 Kramers doublets is taken into account, the 6F3/2 state is expected to provide two sublevels, while the 6F5/2 state provides three sublevels. Such a difference is expected to modify the overall shape of the signal as a different number of transitions are allowed, instead, the shape is very similar. Furthermore, typical MCD signals for mononuclear DyIII complexes do not show such splitting,47\u201353 thus indicating that the presence of DyIII sites in two crystallographically inequivalent environments can be the reason of such a spectral feature.\nTo better probe this possibility, we have analysed the MCD signals associated to the 6F3/2\n 6H15/2 and 6F5/2  6H15/2 transitions by a multiple regression fit analysis. Two contributions to the MCD signal are expected.55,59,60 The A term, which is associated to the lifting of degeneracy of ground and excited state levels due to the magnetic field (Zeeman splitting). It is temperature independent and has a derivative-shape signal. The C term, which is associated to a different population of the ground state as a function of the temperature (Boltzmann distribution). It varies as 1/T and has an absorption-like band shape.55,59,60 At room temperature one can expect that both C and A terms contribute to the MCD signal for a paramagnetic ion, whereas the C term dominates at low temperature.ref In the experimental spectra recorded at room temperature one can indeed recognized that both contributions are present. A multiple regression fit of 6F3/2 and 6F5/2 multiplets that take into consideration both C and A terms was performed to quantify these contributions.38 This procedure reproduces the experimental data well (Figure S10 and Experimental Section for details). Furthermore, the ratio between the intensity of the C terms contributions within the 6F5/2 and 6F3/2 multiplets, are ca. 0.65 and ca. 0.71, respectively, that are, within the experimental accuracy, close to 0.66, the 2:3\nstoichiometry ratio between the crystallographically inequivalent DyIII ions present in the molecular structure. The slight overall shift between the energy of the entire series of f-f transitions for the two crystallographically independent DyIII ions is justified by the crystal field effects (different coordination environment) that contribute by slightly changing the energy difference between the ground state 6H15/2 and the excited states for the two ions, while remaining mainly determined by the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling constant of the lanthanide ion (see above).47\u201353\nThe MChD spectra are extremely rich with intense MChD signals observed all along the\ninvestigated spectral range. On the basis of the assignment of the electronic transitions performed analysing the absorption, NCD and MCD spectra, the MChD contributions can be easily attributed. Going from high to low energy one can identify a sharp negative absorptionlike MChD signal at ca. 450 nm associated to the 4F9/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) transition, a derivativetype broader signal at ca. 650 nm associated to the 3T1  3A2 (NiII) transition, a weak signal at ca. 750 nm associated to the 6F3/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) transition, a sharp absorption-like signal at ca. 800 nm associated to the 6F5/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) transition and two sharp absorption-like signals at ca. 900 nm associated to the 6F7/2/5H5/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) transition. Then, a broad signal of overall derivative-type shape centered at ca. 1060 nm and associated to the 3T2  3A2 (NiII) transition is observed. This broadness hampers the observation of a MChD signal for the 6F9/2/5H7/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) centered at ca. 1080 nm, but allows the observation of additional MChD signals at ca. 1250 nm that are associated to the 6F11/2/5H9/2  6H15/2 (DyIII) transition. By increasing the temperature, the overall MChD spectrum loses intensity to reach values of\nAMChD that are comparable to the background only when the temperature reaches 150 K. This\nis not surprising given the proportionality of AMChD with the magnetization of the system, that follows the Curie law (proportionality with 1/T) in most of the investigated T range and the dominance of the C term.20,38\nAll the identified NiII and DyIII electronic transitions provide multi-metal site MChD\nsignals with a significant intensity, although the intensities of DyIII signals are not as intense as it might be expected if one considers the intrinsically high single-ion magnetic anisotropy of this lanthanide ion due to its electronic configuration. At the same time, the reduced influence of the chiral ligands on the coordination geometry of the DyIII centres compared to the NiII ions might have an effect on this regard and needs further investigations.\nTo quantitative estimate the portion of the absorption that is affected by the interaction of\nthe chiral system with the magnetic field with respect to the overall absorption, we have calculated the gMChD values for those transitions that are not superposed with other ones. These provides values of gMChD of 0.016 T-1 and 0.020 T-1 for the electronic transitions at ca. 810 and 910 nm, respectively, which are in the average range among the gMChD values reported so far in the literature.7,8,21,25,61\nMChD measurements were also performed as a function of the magnetic field B (0.0\u22121.50\nT range) at T = 5.0 K. Figure 8 shows the magnetic field dependence of the MChD spectra for\n1-(R) in the 400\u2212750 nm range. This range was selected because it provides information about\nthe intensity of one DyIII electronic transition and one NiII electronic transition without superposition with other bands.\nFigure 8. Magnetic field variation (see legend) of MChD spectra (420-1360 nm) of 1-(R) recorded on an oriented single crystal under at T = 5 K.\nThe intensity of the MChD signals increase linearly as the intensity of the magnetic field\nincreases without reaching saturation at 1.5 T. Figure 9 shows a comparison between the\ntemperature and magnetic field dependence of the absolute values of AMChD and the magnetization of the sample measured in the same conditions (B = 0.860 T, T = 5 K). The magneto-chiral optical data reproduce the dependence of the magnetization both as a function of the temperature and the magnetic field well, but more importantly, any remarkable difference is observed between the signals associated to NiII and DyIII. This is in agreement with the MChD theory but it is different with what was previously observed with hard X-rays in a 3d-4f heterometallic chiral complex investigated at room temperature. Indeed, only a MChD signal associated to the X-rays absorption of the TbIII ion was observed, while the NiII absorption did not provided any observable MChD signal.22 Here we show that in a heterometallic cluster having two magnetic sites potentially able to provide a MChD signal on the basis of their NCD and MCD response, at a given temperature and at a given value of the applied magnetic field, the normalized intensity of their MChD signals is, within the experimental accuracy, the same.\nFigure 9. Temperature (a) and magnetic field (b) dependence of AMChD signals (see legends) of 1-(R) compared to magnetization data.\nThus, signals associated to multiple sites are perfectly distinguishable and, although the\norigin of the MChD signal appear to be dictated by different phenomena, NOA for NiII and MOA for DyIII, a synergy between the optical response of the different metal sites is observed. This is correlated to the dependence that MChD has with the magnetization of the sample. Here, the high value of the overall magnetization generated by a complex molecular structure able to gather together five DyIII ions and six NiII ions, allows the MChD signals of both 3d and 4f ions to be detected up to 150 K. Detectable MChD at such temperatures are not easily accessible for single isolated paramagnetic ion in mononuclear complexes with a low magnetization and a T dependence that strictly follows the Curie law, thus evidencing the fundamental role of the chiral multimetallic cluster.\nIt should be however noted that the absorption bands associated to the DyIII ions do not\nprovide MChD signals of the same intensity. By restricting the attention to the spectral region where no superposition with NiII bands is present, between 720 and 850 nm, we can clearly see that the two absorptions at ca. 800 nm, that have been assigned to DyIII sites having different coordination environments (see above) do not contribute equally to the MChD spectrum. Indeed, only one intense contribution at 810 nm is observed, which is associated to the three DyIII ions that occupy external positions in the TBP cluster. This is not surprising as it has been already observed in a previous study that when multi-metallic systems are concerned, the metal ions bonded by the chiral ligands are those that provide the most intense MChD signals.24 Here the external DyIII ions are indeed coordinated by two chiral ligands, each of them acting in a bidentate mode, while the internal ones are coordinated only by two terminal carboxylate oxygens in a monodentate mode, with the rest of the coordination geometry completed by hydroxido ligands."

            "text": "In conclusion, 3d-4f {Ln5Ni6} (Ln = DyIII, YIII) enantiopure chiral clusters were synthesized through a self-assembly process leading to heterometallic complexes that are highly stable in solution and in the solid state. Single-Crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the metal ions are held together by \u00b53-OH- bridges leading to clusters where the six Ni2+ ions and the five Ln3+ ions organize into a structure featuring two outer Ni3 triangles sandwiching a Ln5 trigonal bipyramid. Both metal ions interact with the chiral ligands that prevent the cluster from further growth. The hydroxide bridges mediate antiferromagnetic interaction between NiII ions and ferromagnetic interaction between NiII and DyIII ions.\nA thorough spectroscopic study of the optical, magneto-optical and magneto-chiral\noptical properties evidences that in the Vis-NIR range, the Natural Circular Dichroism is dominated by the 3d ions whereas the Magnetic Circular Dichroism by the 4f ions. The Magneto-Chiral Dichroism resulting from the interplay between the two former phenomena appeared as a combination of signals driven by the Natural Optical Activity of the 3d ions and the Magnetic Optical Activity of the 4f ions. This defines a chemical strategy for designing optically active SMMs for the optical readout of magnetic data. One can indeed rely on MChDactive polymetallic chiral clusters containing both 3d and 4f ions, selecting transition metals whose d-d transitions have a high NOA and anisotropic lanthanide ions featuring f-f transitions with a high MOA. The objective is to have strong enough MChD signals to read-out the magnetization stored in a single molecule with a simple and undamaging unpolarized light (VisNIR). To achieve this, chiral SMMs with opened hysteresis cycles, that are, to date, extremely rare, have to be synthetized. This works provides design criteria towards this direction."

Aqueous solutions of lanthanide perchlorates (1 mol L-1) were prepared by digesting lanthanide oxides in concentrated perchloric acid with great care. Caution! Although not encountered in our experiments, perchlorate salts in the presence of organic ligands are potentially explosive. Only a small amount of the materials should be prepared and handled with care.\nSynthesis of N-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-L/D-serine (S/R-H3L): (S)-H3L was synthesized according to the literature,62 but the procedure was slightly modified. To a solution of 1.576 g of L-serine (15 mmol) and 0.600 g of NaOH (15 mmol) in 60 mL of a methanol:water mixture\n(v/v 1:1) was added 2.834 g (15 mmol) of o-vanillin. The resulting yellow solution was stirred for five hours at room temperature. 0.567 g of NaBH4 (15 mmol) was added to it at 0 \u00b0C and the solution was stirred until the yellow color disappeared. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5 using ~ 6mL of glacial acetic acid and stirred for half an hour. A white precipitate thus formed was filtered off, washed with methanol and air dried. Yield: 2.6 g (59%). (R)-H3L was prepared following the procedure described for (S)-H3L except that 1.576 mg (15 mmol) of Dserine was used instead of L-serine.\nSynthesis of [Dy5Ni6(S/R-HL)6(Ac)3(\u00b53-OH)9(H2O)6]\u0387(ClO4)3\u038715H2O (1-(R/S)): (S)-H3L or (R)-H3L (0.06 g, 0.25 mmol), Ni(Ac)2 (0.5 mol L\u20131,1.5 mL), Dy(ClO4)3 (1.0 mol L\u20131,1.25 mL) was added to 10 mL deionized water. The resulting solution was heated to about 80 \u00b0C and a freshly prepared NaOH solution (aq. 0.5 mol L-1) was added dropwise to the point of incipient but permanent precipitation (pH \u2248 6.4), the solution was refluxed for 2 hours and then filtered. Evaporation of the filtrate under ambient conditions afforded 0.22 g grassy rhombic crystals after one day. (Yield are 37% and 36% for 1-(R/S) based on Dy(ClO4)3.

The C, H, and N microanalyses were carried out with a CE instruments EA 1110 elemental analyzer. The infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a Nicolet AVATAR FTIR 380 Spectrophotometer with pressed KBr pellets.\nHigh-resolution Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. The high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) data were collected on Bruker En Apex ultra 7.0 T FT-MS and the data processed using the Bruker Daltonics Data Analysis 3.3 software, while simulated isotope patterns were investigated using Bruker Isotope Pattern software.\nX-Ray Crystallography. Single crystal X\u2013ray structure determination on compounds 1-(R/S) and 2-(R/S) were collected on an Oxford Gemini S Ultra CCD area detector with monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) at 173 K. Absorption corrections were applied by using the multi-scan program CrysAlis Red. The structures were solved by direct methods, and non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by least-squares on F2using the SHELXTL\u201397 program.63 The hydrogen atoms of the organic ligand were generated geometrically (C\u2013H, 0.96 \u00c5). Crystal data as well as details of data collection and refinement for the complexes are summarized in Table S1. CCDC 2125546-2125549 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif. X-ray powder diffraction studies (PXRD) were performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.15418 nm, 35.0 kV, 15.0 mA). The calculated PXRD patterns were generated from single crystal reflection data using Mercury 3.7.64\nMagnetic measurements. Magnetic measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS magnetometer working in the 2-300 K range. Diamagnetic corrections were made with Pascal's constants.65\nCircular and Magnetic Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy. The circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra were recorded using a Circular Dichroism Spectrometer, model: Chirascan Plus, Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK. The magnet was put into the sample cell under two conditions: 1) the magnetic direction was parallel with the polarized light (NS); 2) the magnetic direction was antiparallel with the polarized light (SN). The final MCD signals were introduced as (NS-SN)/2. The high-resolution spectra reported in the main figure were obtained superposing two acquisition with different detectors that are sensitive to UV-Vis and NIR light, respectively. However, both have a poor sensitivity at ca. 900 nm. The\nresult is a signal that has only two contributions of different intensity and opposite signs. If the data collection is performed on the same sample with another detector that has an overall lower resolution but do not lose sensitivity around 900 nm, a signal with a shape very similar to the other signals is obtained (inset in Figure 6). The multiple regression fit used to analyse the 6F5/2 and 6F3/2 multiplets have been performed as follows: a gaussian curve with a fwhm (130 cm-1) comparable to that of the positive signal centered at ca. 12430 cm-1 has been taken as a reference for the C-terms and the A-term obtained by calculating the first derivative of this curve. The position of these curves has been adjusted on the basis of the experimental spectrum and two identical C-term and A-term curves have been used to fit the second component of the 6F5/2 multiplet. The same was done for the 6F3/2 multiplet starting from a gaussian function with a smaller fwhm (100 cm-1). Therefore, the frequency and the fwhm of all curves was kept fix and the only parameters that were free to vary are the coefficients of the multiple-regression fit that define the intensity of the various contributions. The overall Adj-R2 was 0.9685 and the coefficients of the regression fit and their standard errors reported in Table S3.\nMagneto-Chiral Dichroism Spectroscopy. MChD spectra were recorded with a home-made multichannel MChD spectrometer operating in the visible and near infrared spectral window\n(420\u22121360 nm) between 4.0 and 300 K with an alternating magnetic field B up to \u00b12 T. A detailed description of the measurement apparatus has been reported elsewhere.66 MChD spectra were acquired on single crystals of enantiopure 1-(R/S) and 2-(R/S). The samples were mounted on a titanium sample holder over a 0.8 mm hole diameter centered with respect to a\n1.0 mm diameter collimated beam. Measurements were performed in the 4.0\u2212150 K range with\nan alternating magnetic field B = \u00b11.0 T and frequency  = 0.04 Hz. MChD spectra as a\nfunction of the magnetic field were recorded at T = 4.0 K for alternating magnetic fields of different amplitudes (0.0-1.50 T). The MChD signals were obtained at each temperature/field by recording, on average, 30.000 spectra with an integration time, tint of 5 ms, every 10 ms. Unpolarized light was provided by Thorlabs broadband Tungsten-Halogen (Thorlabs SLS201L) for wide-range Vis-NIR measurements. The data were collected with a OPTOSKY\ndetector equipped with a thermoelectric cooled sensor operating in the 420\u22121000 nm spectral\nregion with a resolution of 16 bits. Each spectrum was correlated to a specific magnetic field value by a dual channel digitizer (Picoscope 5000B) acquiring simultaneously triggers from the spectrometer and the magnetic field from a Hall effect sensor placed in proximity of the sample. Data are then post-processed as a synchronous detection with a MatLab routine to obtain a MChD spectrum. The gMChD value is obtained by using the following equation:\n\ud835\udc54MChD = 2 \u2206AMChD\nA\ngMChD = 2A/A if AMChD  (A(B  0)\u2212(A(B = 0)) or A/A if AMChD  (A(B)\u2212(A(B)).\nOur data treatment software calculates AMChD as A(B  0)\u2212A(B = 0), and the effective absorption coefficients A of the involved transitions are obtained by the spectral analysis.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nReaction scheme for the synthesis of the chiral ligands and additional magnetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic data."
