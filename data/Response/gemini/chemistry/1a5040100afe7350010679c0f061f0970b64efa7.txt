1. **Investigate the role of glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling in the antidepressant-like effects of deferiprone.** This could be done by examining the effects of deferiprone on glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in animal models of depression. Additionally, the role of these neurotransmitter systems in the therapeutic effects of deferiprone could be investigated by using pharmacological agents that block or enhance glutamatergic or dopaminergic signaling.


2. **Examine the effects of deferiprone on synaptic plasticity in animal models of depression.** This could be done by measuring the effects of deferiprone on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in brain slices or in vivo. Additionally, the role of synaptic plasticity in the therapeutic effects of deferiprone could be investigated by using pharmacological agents that block or enhance synaptic plasticity.


3. **Investigate the effects of deferiprone on cytoskeletal organization in animal models of depression.** This could be done by examining the effects of deferiprone on the expression and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins in brain tissue. Additionally, the role of cytoskeletal organization in the therapeutic effects of deferiprone could be investigated by using pharmacological agents that disrupt cytoskeletal organization.


4. **Examine the effects of deferiprone on gene expression in animal models of depression.** This could be done by using RNA sequencing to measure the effects of deferiprone on gene expression in brain tissue. Additionally, the role of gene expression in the therapeutic effects of deferiprone could be investigated by using pharmacological agents that block or enhance the expression of specific genes.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferiprone in the treatment of depression.** This would involve administering deferiprone to patients with depression and measuring its effects on depressive symptoms. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of deferiprone could be assessed by monitoring for adverse events.
