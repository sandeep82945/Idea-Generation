The study of language acquisition in children with ASD has received considerable attention in the past decades (Boucher, 2012; Eigsti, de Marchena, Schuh, & Kelley, 2011; Hudry et al., 2010; Rapin & Dunn, 2003; Tager-Flusberg, Paul, & Lord, 2005). Previous studies suggest that children with ASD are generally impaired in their ability to comprehend linguistic cues, such as pragmatics (Kelley, Paul, Fein, & Naigles, 2006; Loukusa & Moilanen, 2009), prosody (McCann & Pepp\u00e9, 2003; Paul, Augustyn, Klin, & Volkmar, 2005; Pepp\u00e9, McCann, Gibbon, O\u2019Hare, & Rutherford, 2007), and morphosyntax (Eigsti & Bennetto, 2009; Eigsti, Bennetto, & Dadlani, 2007; Roberts, Rice, & TagerFlusberg, 2004). As far as prosody is concerned, children with ASD have difficulty with speech turning, affect, signaling phrase boundaries, and emphasizing information with contrastive accents (Paul et al., 2005; Pepp\u00e9 et al., 2007). In terms of morphosyntax, children with ASD fail to correctly interpret grammatical aspect (Zhou, Crain, Gao, Tang, & Jia, 2015), clitics (Terzi, Marinis, & Francis, 2016), and sentence grammaticality (Eigsti & Bennetto, 2009).\nNonetheless, recent studies on comprehension of morphosyntax and prosody in\nchildren with ASD have revealed a different picture. Specifically, the performance of children with ASD has been found to match their typically developing (TD) peers when interpreting grammatical structures including wh-questions (Goodwin, Fein, & Naigles, 2012), grammatical aspect (Su, & Naigles, 2021; Tovar, Fein, & Naigles, 2015), and\nBlinded manuscript without author details and signatures Click here to view linked References\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 2\nword order (Su & Naigles, 2019). Moreover, children with ASD show TD-like identification of statement-question intonation (Wang, Beaman, Jiang, & Liu, 2022), and can use prosody to interpret syntactic ambiguity as effectively as their TD peers (Diehl, Friedberg, Paul, & Snedeker, 2015). The previous findings raise the possibility that the comprehension ability of children with ASD may not be impaired in all linguistic domains. Given that previous comprehension studies focus on one domain of linguistic cues in children with ASD, it is still unclear how children with ASD integrate different linguistic cues in sentence comprehension.\nAgainst this background, the current study aims to investigate how Cantonese-\nspeaking children with ASD use both syntactic and prosodic cues to comprehend focus, compared to typically developing (TD) children and adults. Focus is a key concept of informational structure. It commonly refers to new or contrastive information in a sentence. The interpretation of focus in Cantonese involves multiple levels of linguistic knowledge, including syntax, prosody and pragmatics. The realization of focus is language-specific: Languages choose some language modules, such as grammar, prosody or morphology to encode focus. In languages with relatively strict word order like English, focus is typically realized by assigning an accent to the focal element(s) (Gussenhoven, 1983). Other languages, like Spanish and Italian, prefer syntactic means of focus-marking, i.e., to have a syntactic position where the focus is typically placed (Zimmermann & Onea, 2011). Although focus in Cantonese can be realized by syntactic or/and prosodic means (Gu & Lee, 2007; Matthews & Yip, 2011; Wu & Xu, 2010), syntactic cues are primarily used to interpret focus by Cantonese-speaking adults (Lee, 2019; Matthews & Yip, 2011). Focus provides us with an ideal testing ground to examine how Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD integrate different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 3\nlevels of linguistic information and which linguistic cue they prefer to use in sentence comprehension.\nIn this paper, we investigated the comprehension of focus by five to eight-year-\nold Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD. The realization of focus in Cantonese is first introduced, along with reviews on previous studies regarding the acquisition of focus. Research questions and hypotheses of the study are then presented, followed by results from our comprehension experiment. Lastly, findings concerning the research questions are discussed."

            "text": "Focus commonly refers to new or contrastive information in a sentence. For instance, focus in answer (1) presents apple as nonpresupposed information about question (1). Focus becomes contrastive if it rejects a stated alternative in the context (Chafe, 1976). For example, the focused element apple in (2) forms a contrast with the alternative pear mentioned in question (2). (1) Question: What did John eat?\nAnswer: He ate an [apple]F.\n(2) Question: Did John eat the pear?\nAnswer: No, he ate the [apple]F.\nIt has been widely acknowledged that languages differ in their linguistic devices\nused to realize focus and the extent to which the same devices are used. In English, focus is typically realized by assigning prosodic prominence to the focal element(s), manifested primarily in expanded pitch range, accompanied by increased intensity and longer duration (Gussenhoven, 1983). For instance, the answer to question (1) would typically be uttered as (3a), where APPLE is accented (capitalization denotes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 4\naccentuation). The answer (3a) with accentuation on the object is felicitous to question (1), while (3b) with accentuation on the verb ATE is not. (3) a. John ate an [APPLE]F.\nb. # John ATE an [apple]F\nUnlike English, the use of prosody to mark focus is highly constrained in\nCantonese, a tonal language with six contrastive lexical tones (Chao, 1947). Specifically, there is no clear evidence for on-focus pitch expansion in Cantonese (Man, 2002; Wu & Xu, 2010). Instead, longer duration and higher intensity are manifested in Cantonese focused elements (Gu & Lee, 2007; Wu & Xu, 2010). For instance, in (4b), the subject WU4LEI2 \u201cfox\u201d is accented with increased duration and intensity. Compared to English, Cantonese uses focus particles (FP) and word order to a larger extent to achieve the same purpose (Chao, 1947; Fung, 2000; Lee, 2019; Matthews & Yip, 2011). For example, the FP hai6 could be imposed before the focused element to mark focus, as in (4a).\n(4) Person A: \u5154\u4ed4 \u98df\u7dca \u7d05\u863f\u8514?\ntou3zai2 sik6gan2 hung4lo4baak6 rabbit eat-PROG carrot \u201cIs the rabbit eating the carrot?\u201d\nPerson B: a. \u5514\u4fc2\uff0c \u4fc2 [\u72d0\u72f8]F \u98df\u7dca \u7d05\u863f\u8514\u3002\nm4hai6 hai6 wu4lei2 sik6gan2 hung4lo4baak6 No FP fox eat-PROG carrot\nb. \u5514\u4fc2\uff0c [\u72d0\u72f8]F \u98df\u7dca \u7d05\u863f\u8514\u3002\nm4hai6 WU4LEI2 sik6gan2 hung4lo4baak6 No fox eat-PROG carrot \u2018No, the fox is eating the carrot.\u2019 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 5\nCantonese hai6 is not equivalent to only in English. Hai6 only specifies the focused element and introduces an alternative but does not contribute to the truth conditions of the sentences, as only does in English. Cantonese uses other FPs, including zing6hai6 \u201conly\u201d, zaa3 \u201conly\u201d, ze1 \u201conly\u201d, and zau6 \u201conly\u201d, in different sentence positions to convey the focus meaning of only (Fung, 2000; Lee, 2019; Matthews & Yip, 2011).\nPrevious theoretical studies on Cantonese suggest that the rich inventory of FPs\nin Cantonese makes the use of prosody optional to encode focus meaning (Lee, 2019; Matthews & Yip, 2011). However, it is far from clear which linguistic cue (syntax or prosody) is more important for the comprehension of focus by Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD."

            "text": "Knowledge of focus is crucial for effective communication because the interlocutors need to distinguish information provided in the preceding context, e.g., \u201crabbit\u201d in (4), and an alternative, e.g., \u201cFOX\u201d in (4), to respond appropriately. Therefore, how children use linguistic cues to comprehend focus has been a central issue in the field of language acquisition for decades (Chen, 2010; Chen, Szendr\u0151i, Crain, & H\u00f6hle, 2019; Crain, Ni, & Conway, 1994; H\u00f6hle, Berger, M\u00fcller, Schmitz, & Weissenborn, 2009; H\u00f6hle, Fritzsche, & M\u00fcller, 2016; Paterson, Liversedge, White, Filik, & Jaz, 2006; Szendr\u0151i, Bernard, Berger, Gervain, & H\u00f6hle, 2018; Zhou & Crain, 2010; Zhou, Su, Crain, Gao, & Zhan, 2012).\nPrevious research on the comprehension of focus in TD children has yielded\ncontroversial results. Some researchers suggest that children\u2019s interpretation of focus with only does not seem adult-like until school age. In a picture-verification task, Crain et al. (1994) asked 3- to 6-year-old English-speaking children to judge whether 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 6\nsentences like Only the cat is holding a flag and The cat is only holding a flag were accurate descriptions of a picture in which a cat was holding a flag, a duck was holding a flag and a balloon, and a frog was holding a balloon. They found that Englishspeaking children associated only with the verb phrase regardless of its position in the sentence, different from the adult controls. Using a similar task, Paterson et al. (2006) investigated the interpretation of focus in only-sentences by English-speaking children at an elder age (7;0\u201310;0). Their results showed that children interpreted focus with and without only in the same way. Non-adult-like patterns were also observed in Mandarinspeaking children. Chen (1998) used a sentence-correction task to assess the use of different syntactic and prosodic cues by 5- to 13-year-old Mandarin-speaking children in determining given/new information. Results showed that Mandarin-speaking children rely more heavily on prosodic information than on word order in determining given and new information, whereas Mandarin-speaking adults considered word order to be the major cue for given/new information. Zhou and Crain (2010) asked 4-yearold Mandarin-speaking children to interpret focus marked by FPs like Zhiyou Yuehan chi-le pingguo \u2018Only John ate an apple\u2019 and Shi Yuehan chi-de pingguo \u2018It is John who ate an apple\u2019. It is found that Mandarin-speaking 4-year-olds tend to associate FPs zhiyou \u2018only\u2019 and shi \u2018be\u2019 with the verb phrase, whereas adults uniquely associate them with the subject.\nApart from the investigations on the syntactically marked focus, previous studies\nalso found that children before age 8 have not achieved an adult-like understanding of prosodically marked focus with only. Using a truth-value judgement task, Gualmini, Maciukaite and Crain (2003) investigated whether 4- to 5-year-old English-speaking children were sensitive to prosodic information in comprehending sentences with preverbal only in two conditions: prosodic prominence placed either on the indirect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 7\nobject (e.g., The Troll only brought an onion ring to SUPERMAN) or on the direct object (e.g., The Troll only brought an ONION RING to superman). The results showed that children interpreted the sentences in the two conditions in the same way, suggesting that they were unable to use prosodic information alone to correctly interpret focus in only-sentences. In a similar vein, studies on German-speaking children (5;1\u20137;8) (H\u00fcttner, Drenhaus, van der Vijver, & Weissenborn, 2004) and Dutch-speaking children (4;1\u20136;10) (Szendr\u0151i, 2004) also showed children\u2019s failure to understand prosodically marked focus in sentences with FPs in an adult-like fashion.\nHowever, whether the comprehension of syntactically and prosodically marked\nfocus is problematic for children has been challenged. Some researchers argued that adult-like comprehension of focus is possible. In an eye-tracking study, H\u00f6hle et al. (2009) asked German-speaking 2- to 4-year-old children to listen to sentences with either accented auch \u201calso\u201d (Toby hat AUCH eine Puppe \u201cToby has ALSO a doll\u201d) or unaccented auch \u201calso\u201d (Toby hat auch eine ENTE \u201cToby has also a DUCK\u201d) and look at a picture in which one child Toby had a doll and a duck and the other child had only one doll. The fixation patterns suggested that children could use prosodic information from at least 3 years of age onwards to identify the correct focus domain and relate focus with its corresponding alternative set. H\u00f6hle et al. (2016) further investigated the comprehension of focus with nur \u201conly\u201d in German-speaking 4-year-old children. Although the offline judgement data replicated previous findings of non-adult-like comprehension of focus, children\u2019s eye gaze data revealed adult-like patterns of focus interpretation. In a similar eye-tracking study, Zhou et al. (2012) investigated the use of prosodic information by 5-year-old Mandarin-speaking children in online comprehension of focus with zhiyou \u2018only\u2019. Their results also showed adult-like patterns in the eye-tracking task but non-adult-like explicit judgements. The high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 8\nvariation in children\u2019s performance across studies is unclear but could be attributed to the nature of the tasks, which may prevent children from putting their knowledge into full use.\nApart from task differences, other researchers suggested that children\u2019s failure in\nthe comprehension of focus in sentences with only is not necessarily due to their lack of knowledge of focus but due to extra demands from only. Therefore, Chen (2010) examined the processing of accentuation as a cue to comprehend focus in simple subject-verb-object (SVO) sentences without only by 4- to 5-year-old Dutch-speaking children. The results show that Dutch-speaking children can use prosodic information to interpret focus in an adult-like manner, although their response times were longer than adults. Szendr\u0151i et al. (2018) also reveal an adult-like interpretation of prosodically marked subject and object focus in 3- to 6-year-old English-, German- and Dutchspeaking children. Furthermore, their study showed that children of different languages had acquired cross-linguistic differences in the use of focus markers in comprehension very early on. In a recent study, Chen et al. (2019) presented Mandarin-speaking children (aged 3-5) with simple SVO sentences without only and asked them to judge whether the sentence matched the picture or not. Different from Chen (1998), their results showed that Mandarin-speaking children preferred syntactic information over prosodic information to interpret focus, indicating that children as early as 3 years of age were attuned to specific means of focus marking.\nBased on the previous findings, we noticed that firstly, it is not yet fully clear\nwhether TD children at the beginning of school-age have an adult-like comprehension of focus. Secondly, most of the previous studies on TD children examined focus comprehension involving only. This is potentially questionable because these tasks also test children\u2019s ability to comprehend only rather than focus itself, which may increase 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 9\nthe demands on children and thus influence the results. Lastly, previous studies showed that TD children exhibit language-specific abilities in understanding focus across languages. However, whether the results can be generalized to children with ASD is still unclear.\nComprehension of focus in children with ASD Previous studies on children with ASD mainly concentrated on the comprehension of prosodic focus using a test of prosodic abilities, the Profiling Elements of Prosodic Systems \u2013 Children (PEPS-C; Pepp\u00e9 & McCann, 2003). The PEPS-C includes testing of four communication areas where prosody plays a crucial role: interaction, affect, chunking and focus. Regarding the comprehension of focus is concerned, the PEPS-C measures the ability to perceive contrastive focus accents. In this task, children see two colors on the screen and hear sentences with focus accents on different colors (e.g., I wanted BLUE and black socks vs I wanted blue and BLACK socks). Then they need to point to the color that was focused. Pepp\u00e9 et al. (2007) found that English-speaking children with ASD aged 6-13 years made significantly more errors, compared to the matched TD group. On the other hand, there are studies that children with ASD between the age of 6 and 16 achieve TD-like interpretation of focus (Filipe, Frota, & Vicente, 2018; J\u00e4rvinen-Pasley, Pepp\u00e9, King-Smith, & Heaton, 2008).\nTo the best of our knowledge, only one pilot study has investigated the\ncomprehension of prosodically marked focus in Cantonese-speaking children with ASD (Zhou et al., 2021). In their study, eighteen 7- to 9-year-old Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD participated in a naturalness rating task. Children first heard question-answer dialogues and viewed corresponding pictures. The questions generated a broad focus (e.g., What\u2019s happening?), whereas the answers presented with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 10\neither neutral prosodic prominence (e.g., Mr. Zhang is flying the plane) or prosodic prominence on the subject (e.g., MR. ZHANG is flying the plane), giving rise to matched and mismatched conditions. Then, children were asked to rate the naturalness of the dialogues on a scale from 1 (very unnatural) to 5 (very natural). Their results showed that Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD tended to rate the dialogues as 5 (very natural) regardless of the conditions, suggesting that both groups of children were not able to interpret the prosodic focus. However, their findings might be masked by the nature of the task. Different from an identification/verification task, a naturalness rating provides less restricted choices which increase the choice difficulty and thus has been seldom used in children. It is possible that the children might be able to correctly interpret prosodic focus but failed to understand the task. Furthermore, Cantonesespeaking children might rely heavily on morphosyntactic means other than prosodic cues to interpret focus, especially given the focus marking strategies in Cantonese.\nTaken together, it is far from clear whether TD-like comprehension of focus is\npossible in children with ASD. The previous findings also highlight the importance of understanding language-specific patterns in children with ASD. It is thus crucial to include both syntactically and prosodically marked focus to examine whether children with ASD are subject to language-specific strategies."

We raise three research questions. First, could Cantonesespeaking TD children have adult-like comprehension of focus? As noted above, the findings of the prior studies are mixed. As our study examined focus in sentences without only, it would require relatively fewer demands on children compared to the interpretation of focus in only-sentences. Based on the previous findings on comprehension of focus in simple sentences by TD children (Chen, 2010; Chen et al., 2019; Szendr\u0151i et al., 2018), we predicted that Cantonese-speaking TD children would exhibit adult-like comprehension of focus.\nSecond, would Cantonese-speaking children with ASD show TD-like\ncomprehension of focus? As the previous study tentatively suggests that the interpretation of prosodically marked focus is difficult for Cantonese-speaking children with ASD around 7 to 9 years of age (Zhou et al., 2021), we hypothesized that children with ASD at a younger age (5 to 8 years of age) in this study would also have comprehension difficulties and not able to interpret focus in a TD-like fashion.\nThird, which linguistic cue (syntax or prosody) would Cantonese-speaking\nchildren with and without ASD prefer in interpreting focus? The previous crosslinguistic studies showed that language-specific marking of focus is acquired as early as 3 years of age (Chen et al., 2019; Szendr\u0151i et al., 2018), we predicted that both Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD shall have acquired the languagespecific marking of focus by the age of 8. Specifically, the children in the current study would rely more on syntactic cues more than prosodic cues in interpreting focus, similar to Mandarin-speaking children (Chen et al., 2019), or they could correctly interpret syntactically marked focus but were not sensitive to prosodically marked focus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 12\nMethod"

Twenty-eight Cantonese-speaking adults served as the comparison groups. All participants were born in Hong Kong and acquired Cantonese as their first language. TD children had no family history of diagnosed developmental disorders or impairments. Children with ASD were mainly recruited from the Heep Hong Society, a leading education and rehabilitation organization in Hong Kong that offers diverse support services to children with special education needs. Parents\u2019 informed consent was obtained prior to the study. All procedures were approved in accordance with the research ethical committee at the university where the testing took place. Demographic information of the three groups of participants is shown in Table 1. TD children and children with ASD were matched on age, receptive vocabulary, non-verbal IQ, and working memory. The Cantonese Receptive Vocabulary Test (CRVT; Cheung et al., 1997) was used to assess the children\u2019s receptive Cantonese vocabulary knowledge. Non-verbal IQs were assessed with the Primary Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (PTONI; Ehrler & McGhee, 2008) by the third author, a clinical psychologist. Nonverbal IQs for children with ASD ranged from 68 to 143 (mean = 111.61), while the IQs for TD children ranged from 71 to 144 (mean = 113.53). The Backward Digit Span task, based on the procedure included in the McCarthy Scales of Children\u2019s Abilities (McCarthy, 1972), was used to evaluate participants\u2019 working memory. The task was composed of two sections, in which the instructors said a list of numbers, and the participant was asked to recite the numbers backwards.

A score was assigned based on the largest, correctly reported set, with a maximum score of 10. T-tests revealed no group difference between TD children and children with ASD in terms of PTONI (t(90) = 0.260, p = 0.398), CRVT (t(90) = 0.241, p = 0.810) and working memory (t(90) = -0.487, p = 0.628).\nAutism or autism spectrum diagnoses were validated with the Autism Diagnostic\nObservation Schedule\u2122, Second Edition (ADOS\u2122-2; Lord et al., 2012) by the first author who has the qualification of administering and coding the ADOS-2 for clinical and research reliability. As a semi-structured standardized assessment tool, the ADOS2 is used to measure social and communication behaviours which contribute to a diagnosis of autism. In the current study, Module 3 was selected based on children\u2019s language and developmental levels. Children were classified as ASD when they received a total score of \u2265 7 (N = 26), and they were classified as autism if their total scores were \u2265 9 (N = 18)."

A 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 design was used to manipulate Group (ASD, TD, adults), Focus Marking (FP, prosody) and Context (match, mismatch). For the experimental dialogues, there were one version of each question from the pig and four versions of each answer from the robot. Each question from the pig consisted two parts: the first part (e.g., Who is eating the carrot?) triggered new information to be expected on subject, and the second part (e.g., I think the monkey 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 14\nis eating the carrot) elicited subject focus in the comment. The variables Focus Marking (FP, prosody) and Context (match, mismatch) were embedded in the answers from the robot, which gave rise to four experimental conditions: (a) focus marked with FP in a matched context, (b) focus marked with prosody in a matched context, (c) focus marked with FP in a mismatched context, and (d) focus marked with prosody in a mismatched context. Examples of the four conditions are illustrated in Table 2, where the focused words are bracketed and prosodic prominence is underlined. The experimental auditory stimuli in Table 2 correspond to the picture stimuli in Figure 1, in which two cartoon characters (e.g., fox vs. monkey) are performing the same action (e.g., eating) to two different objects (e.g., cabbage vs. carrot).\nThe auditory stimuli were recorded by a female native speaker of Cantonese at\n44.1 kHz sampling frequency with 16 bits resolution. She was asked to produce the stimuli with appropriate or inappropriate FP and prosody for four experimental conditions. Each stimulus was scaled to 70 dB SPL in mean intensity using Praat (Version 6.0.39; Boersma & Weenink, 2018). To ensure that prosody was placed in the right position, the answer sentences of the experimental dialogues were subjected to a phonetic analysis using Praat. All stimuli were cross-checked by two native speakers of Cantonese (one male and one female) to ensure the stimuli were natural. To measure the reliability of the stimuli, we carried out a reliability analysis on the two native speakers\u2019 judgements, using the psych package (Revelle, 2019). A good measurement of reliability (\u03b1 Cronbach = 0.84) was observed. In total, 80 experimental dialogues and 40 fillers were distributed over the four conditions via a Latin Square design. Four lists of dialogues were created such that each dialogue appeared in every experimental condition but not in the same list.

First, a cross appeared in the center of the screen. Then, a question-answer dialogue between the pig and the robot was played right after, with a 2000-ms interval between the question and the answer. The two options, \u201cYES or NO,\u201d were displayed on the screen at the end of the answer. The participants were instructed to rest their thumbs on an RT box and press the button to indicate their response as quickly as possible, but not before the end of the answer sentence. If the answer was a correct response to the question, they were asked to press the \u201cYES\u201d button (on the left side of the RT box), otherwise the \u201cNO\u201d button (on the right side of the RT box). Therefore, the \u201cYES\u201d responses to the questions were not truly \u201ccorrect\u201d, but those that the children \u201cthought\u201d were correct. For example, the answer to Condition (d) where focus was marked by prosody in a mismatched context was an incorrect response to the question in Table 2. However, if a child thought the answer was correct without realizing the inappropriate placement of prosodic prominence on the unfocused element, he or she would give a \u201cYES\u201d response. \u201cYESNO\u201d judgments and RTs were recorded at the end of each answer sentence until a button was pressed using E-prime.

Raw RTs smaller than 200 ms or above 2.5SD were further excluded. We conducted the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test on the remaining raw RTs in the R statistical program (R Core Team, 2022) to examine its normality. As the RTs were not normally distributed (W= 0.765, p < 0.001), we log-transformed the RT data to reduce the non-normality of residuals. To measure the task reliability, we carried out a reliability analysis on the log-transformed RTs comprising 80 items in the R statistical program, using the psych package (Revelle, 2019). Cronbach\u2019s alpha showed that the task reached acceptable reliability (\u03b1 = 0.881). To examine how Group, Focus marking, and Context affect participants\u2019 comprehension of focus, we used linear mixed-effects models in the lme4 package (Bates, M\u00e4chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) for all analyses in R. In the models, we included fixed factors of Group (Adults, ASD, TD), Focus Marking (FP, prosody), and Context (match, mismatch) with Participant and Item as random factors. Given the unbalanced gender distribution between the two groups of children, Gender was also included as a factor in the models for statistical analysis. Since the factor of Gender did not lead to significant differences in children\u2019s performance in the tasks, it was not included in the model selection. Thus, we assume that female participants performed similarly to male participants in the current study. The dependent variables were \u201cYES\u2013NO\u201d judgment (YES=1, NO=0) and logtransformed RTs. Effects were tested for significance by model comparison.

            "text": "The current study investigated how 5 to 8-year-old Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD use syntactic and prosodic information to comprehend focus. Our results indicate that Cantonese-speaking TD children were able to use syntactic cues to interpret focus, as they gave significantly less \u201cYES\u201d response to FP marked focus in mismatched contexts than in matched contexts, although to a lesser extent than Cantonese-speaking adults. In terms of prosodically marked focus, adults were more accurate in both matched and mismatched contexts compared to TD children, showing that TD children were not sensitive to prosodically marked focus regardless of the context. TD children seem to have adult-like comprehension of syntactically marked focus, but their interpretation of prosodic focus is not adult-like. We found that, in a task where children did not have to interpret semantic operators, such as only, they were able to show adult-like understanding of syntactically marked focus, consistent with our hypothesis and previous studies on TD children\u2019s comprehension of focus in simple sentences (Chen, 2010; Chen et al., 2019; Szendr\u0151i et al., 2018). While the primary goal of the present study was to understand the comprehension of focus in ASD, this study also provides novel information about the possibility of adult-like focus comprehension in Cantonese-speaking TD children.\nIn terms of the second research question that whether children with ASD have\nTD-like comprehension, we noticed two patterns. First, children with ASD were as good as TD children in making use of syntactic cues in interpreting focus, even though they were slower. Second, children with ASD were faster when prosody and focus were mismatched than when prosody and focus were matched, while TD children did not show the same pattern. Our results provide new empirical evidence that Cantonesespeaking children with ASD can achieve TD-like performance in language 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 21\ndevelopment, as their comprehension patterns of syntactically marked focus is similar to TD children. Meanwhile, we should also note that children with ASD exhibit nonTD-like use of prosodic information in understanding focus, even after controlling for the effects of age, receptive vocabulary, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory. The findings suggest that the comprehension difficulty observed in children with ASD is rather domain-specific, and TD-like performance in some linguistic domains is possible.\nRegarding the third research question, Cantonese-speaking adults showed a\nstronger preference in utilizing syntactic cues over prosodic information, although they make use of both syntactic and prosodic information to comprehend focus. This finding provides further empirical evidence supporting previous results on Cantonese focus realization: Cantonese relies heavily on syntax for focus marking, in contrast to English that rests on prosody to realize focus (Fung, 2000; Lee, 2019). This language-specific strategy of focus marking is also observed in Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD. By age 8, both groups of children have developed a language-specific preference, i.e., syntactic marking, to interpret focus in Cantonese, whereas their ability to make use of prosodic cues in focus comprehension has not yet fully developed. Our findings are consistent with previous results that TD children attune to the specific means of focus marking from an early age (Chen et al., 2019; Szendr\u0151i et al., 2018). The current findings further confirm that language-specific marking of focus can be acquired at the beginning of school age, from the perspective of typical and atypical language development in children with and without ASD. This language-specific strategy might enable Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD to exhibit adult-like performance in comprehending syntactically marked focus, but give rise to developmental delays in understanding prosodically marked focus in Cantonese. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 22\nWe now consider how to account for the differences between children with ASD\nand TD children. The first possibility could be that children with ASD have more difficulties than their TD peers with the integration of information. The comprehension of focus is not an easy task to accomplish. Children first need to identify relevant syntactic/prosodic information from multiple sources and then integrate the information with focused constituents through the context in order to accurately interpret the meaning. In particular, Cantonese-speaking children with ASD may correctly perceive syntactic or prosodic cues in sentences but struggle to integrate these into their processing of focus meaning through the question-answer dialogues. This may explain why children with ASD were slower than TD children in general when interpreting both syntactically and prosodically marked focus. This line of interpretation is also consistent with the weak central coherence hypothesis\u2019 claim of a domain-general difficulty integrating multiple information (Happ\u00e9 & Frith, 2006). Our findings suggest that weak central coherence may apply not only to visual and auditory processing but also to language processing in individuals with ASD, in line with the previous studies on the resolution of ambiguous words (Jolliffe & Baron-Cohen, 1999, 2000).\nNonetheless, we also found that children with ASD, compared to TD children,\nwere faster in responding to prosodic focus in mismatched contexts than in matched contexts. This pattern was absent in their responses to syntactically marked focus, which cannot be fully explained by weak central coherence. We think this non-TD-like performance of children with ASD can be attributed to their difficulty in correctly perceiving prosodic prominence in the first place. This explanation is not unlikely, considering previous studies on the perception of prosody in children with ASD (e.g., McCann & Pepp\u00e9, 2003; Paul, et al., 2005; Pepp\u00e9 et al., 2007). Children with ASD might take the inappropriate prosody as the correct form, reflected in their faster 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 23\nresponse to prosodic focus in mismatched contexts, and thus fail to map the correct prosodic information to focus.\nA further remark concerns the effect of task difficulty on the performance of\nadults and children. One anonymous reviewer pointed out that all three groups of participants showed a high number of \u201cYES\u201d responses in the mismatched contexts. If it was the task difficulty that lead to a high number of \u201cYES\u201d responses, we would expect all three groups to show similar performance across the conditions. However, we have observed a significant difference between the matched and mismatched context in comprehending FP marked focus across groups. Thus, it is unlikely that the task difficulty could explain the high proportion of \u201cYES\u201d responses in prosodically marked focus.\nOur findings complement and extend the previous research in a number of ways.\nFirst, our study contributes to a better understanding of focus comprehension in both children with ASD and TD children at the beginning of school age. Our findings also provide new cross-linguistic empirical evidence for comprehension of focus in typical and atypical development, from the perspective of Cantonese. Second, our study advances our understanding of multiple information integration in language comprehension of children with ASD. Our findings indicate that the integration of multiple information does pose difficulty to children with ASD, consistent with the weak central coherence hypothesis. Meanwhile, our results also highlight the importance of considering other factors, such as deficits in prosodic perception, to fully account for the comprehension difficulties found in children with ASD. Teasing apart the weak central coherence and prosodic deficits in ASD will require improving our experimental design. In particular, it is important to assess weak central coherence in a variety of linguistic domains in children with ASD, which will be valuable in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 24\nunderstanding the language deficits associated with autism. Finally, our study is one of the very few ones that compare the use of syntactic and prosodic information in the comprehension of children with ASD. The findings also provide evidence that Cantonese-speaking children with ASD, like TD children, are sensitive to languagespecific focus marking before age 8. The language-specific strategies might pose greater demands on children with ASD than their TD peers in acquiring a less preferred processing strategy in their language, such as the use of prosody to understand focus in Cantonese. It would be interesting to investigate whether and when Cantonese-speaking children with and without ASD start to adhere to prosodic information for focus interpretation.\nOur findings have implications for evidence-based assessments and practice in\natypical language development of children with ASD. First, our results suggest that children with ASD may not always experience more difficulties than their TD peers in all aspects of language development. Assessing their linguistic knowledge in different domains is crucial to obtain a more comprehensive picture of their language development. Second, our study highlights the importance of understanding languagespecific patterns in designing future language assessment tools to detect communication problems in children with ASD. In particular, identifying crosslinguistic differences and considering language backgrounds would be helpful in designing intervention plans for children with ASD.\nThe current study is not without limitations. First, we focused solely on high-\nfunctioning ASD children with strong language skills. Therefore, the results may not generalize to the broader population of children with ASD. Further research is needed to extend to relatively low-functioning children with ASD. Second, our study only examined the comprehension of focus. It is still unclear how Cantonese-speaking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 25\nchildren with ASD would perform in the production of focus. Previous studies found that English-speaking children with ASD made more errors in focus production than TD children (Diehl & Paul, 2013; Paul et al., 2005; Pepp\u00e9 et al., 2007). Further research is needed to obtain a richer understanding of both comprehension and production of focus. Furthermore, the current study only examined focus in subject position, without comparing focus in verb or object positions. Further studies are desired to investigate whether and to what extent focus position would influence the comprehension of children with ASD."

We have identified their use of prosodic and syntactic means, while comparing them to Cantonese-speaking adults and TD children. On the one hand, the similar patterns between children with ASD and TD children provide supporting evidence for TD-like syntactic abilities in the comprehension of focus by children with ASD. On the other hand, the results suggest that children with ASD might experience more difficulties in utilizing prosodic information to understand focus, relative to their TD peers. Our results also indicate that Cantonese-speaking children with ASD have acquired language-specific focus marking strategies by age 8. This study demonstrates how linguistic domains (e.g., prosody and syntax) and language-specific strategies can influence comprehension outcomes in children with ASD. The findings have implications for future assessments and evidence-based interventions for children with ASD in general. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65\nRunning head: Focus comprehension in children with ASD | 26\nDeclarations"
