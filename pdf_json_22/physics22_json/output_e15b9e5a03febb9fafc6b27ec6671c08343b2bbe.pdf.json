    "abstractText": "A gas of interacting particles is a paradigmatic example of chaotic systems. It is shown here that even if all but one particle are fixed in generic positions, the excited states of the moving particle are chaotic. They are characterized by the number of principal components (NPC) \u2014 the number of integrable system eigenstates involved into the non-integrable one, which increases linearly with the number of strong scatterers. This rule is a particular case of the general effect of an additional perturbation on the system chaotic properties. The perturbation independence criteria supposing the system chaoticity increase are derived here as well. The effect can be observed in experiments with photons or cold atoms as the decay of observable fluctuation variance, which is inversely proportional to NPC, and, therefore, to the number of scatterers. This decay indicates that the eigenstate thermalization is approached. The results are confirmed by numerical calculations for a harmonic waveguide with zero-range scatterers along its axis.",

            "text": "Exploring integrability-chaos transition with a sequence of independent perturbations\nVladimir A. Yurovsky School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University, 6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel\nA gas of interacting particles is a paradigmatic example of chaotic systems. It is shown here that even if all but one particle are fixed in generic positions, the excited states of the moving particle are chaotic. They are characterized by the number of principal components (NPC) \u2014 the number of integrable system eigenstates involved into the non-integrable one, which increases linearly with the number of strong scatterers. This rule is a particular case of the general effect of an additional perturbation on the system chaotic properties. The perturbation independence criteria supposing the system chaoticity increase are derived here as well. The effect can be observed in experiments with photons or cold atoms as the decay of observable fluctuation variance, which is inversely proportional to NPC, and, therefore, to the number of scatterers. This decay indicates that the eigenstate thermalization is approached. The results are confirmed by numerical calculations for a harmonic waveguide with zero-range scatterers along its axis.\nEvolution of integrable systems is completely predictable and, according to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem (see [1]), weak perturbations do not affect this property. There are numerous examples of such classical and quantum systems, including stellar mechanics, hydrogen atoms, and many-body systems, both realized in experiments, such as quantum Newton cradle [2, 3] and cold-atom breathers [4, 5] (see [6\u20139] for the theoretical description) and those waiting for the realization [10].\nWhen the integrability-lifting perturbation is sufficiently strong, the system evolution becomes unpredictable. Nevertheless, a completely-chaotic system relaxes to a state described by the Gibbs ensemble, thanks to the eigenstate thermalization mechanism \u2014 eigenstate expectation values are equal to microcanonical averages at the eigenstate energy \u2014 introduced in [11, 12] (see also [13, 14], the experimental work [15], the review [16] and the references therein). In contrast, integrable systems relax to states described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble[17\u201321].\nHowever, a generic system lies between integrable and completely-chaotic systems [22\u201349]. The incomplete chaos can be related to weak integrability-lifting perturbations [29, 31, 32, 34, 47, 48] or phase-space separation in both classical and quantum systems. It can have also a specific quantum nature, such as many-body localization [33, 37, 49] or zero-range interactions [22\u201324, 26\u2013 28, 30]. Chaoticity of such incompletely-chaotic systems can be characterized by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) [28, 31, 33, 50]. Its inverse \u2014 the number of principal components (NPC) \u2014 estimates the number of integrable system eigenstates comprising the non-integrable one. IPR ranges from 1 for integrable systems to 0 for completely-chaotic ones. It governs the expectation values after relaxation in incompletely-chaotic systems with no selection rules [28, 31]. This regularity has been confirmed in different systems [41]. The fluctuations of expectation values over eigenstates are strong for integrable systems and vanish in completely-chaotic ones, according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. These fluc-\ntuations, too, are governed by IPR [32]. Exploration of the integrability \u2013 eigenstate thermal-\nization crossover is of special interest, and the means of the system chaoticity prediction based on its Hamiltonian, with no numerical calculations, would be very useful. The exponential decay of fluctuations in many-body systems with the number of particles was predicted in [12]. However, this sharp decay complicates the exploration due to the high sensitivity of the system chaoticity to the number of particles. Analytical predictions for single particles with random-matrix perturbations (see [31] and the references therein) are applicable to strong perturbations (and chaos) only. The system chaoticity can be modified by an additional perturbation, e.g., it can transform an integrable system into a chaotic one. However, the effect of an additional perturbation on a chaotic system is ambiguous, e.g., the system integrability can be restored if the additional perturbation is equal to the integrability-lifting one with opposite sign. The system chaoticity increases when the additional perturbation obeys the independence criteria determined here. Then, a linear increase of NPC with the number of independent perturbations of the same shape is predicted. Simultaneous decay of expectation value fluctuations indicates that the eigenstate thermalization is approached. These predictions are confirmed by numerical calculations for a harmonic waveguide with zero-range scatterers along its axis. Both NPC and expectation value fluctuations are specific characteristics of quantum chaos and it is unclear if they have classical counterparts. Consider a sequence of Hamiltonians H\u0302s = H\u03020 +\u2211s s\u2032=1 V\u0302s\u2032 . Here, the integrable one H\u03020 has the eigenstates |n\u3009 and eigenenergies En labeled by a proper set of integrals of motion n. The integrability is lifted by the perturbations V\u0302s\u2032 . The eigenstates |\u03b1s\u3009 of the nonintegrable Hamiltonians H\u0302s are labeled in the increasing order of their eigenenergies E\u03b1s . If H\u0302s is invariant under some transformations, sets of |\u03b1s\u3009 with certain symmetry have to be considered separately. For example, there may be eigenstates with certain angular momentum for ar X iv :2 20 8. 00 03 9v 2 [ qu an tph ] 1 4\nJa n\n20 23\n2 \u03b1s \u03b1s\u22121\nn\nFigure 1. A chart of connection between eigenstates. The number of the integrable system eigenstates n connected to the non-integrable ones increases from 4 to 5 due to an additional perturbation.\nrotational symmetry of H\u0302s, or certain parity for inversion invariance, or certain quasimomentum for spatial periodicity. Such sets of eigenstates can be described by different Hamiltonians, e.g., with separated angular momentum for rotational symmetry, or restricted to the unit cell for spatial periodicity. Such Hamiltonians can contain fewer perturbations than the original one H\u0302s. Only the case when all H\u0302s have the same invariance group is considered.\nEach eigenstate |\u03b1s\u3009 can be expanded in terms of |n\u3009, and the strength function\nWs(En, E\u03b1s) = \u2329 |\u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009|2 \u232a (1)\nis the probability averaged over states with a fixed energy difference (see [51]). The relation between the strength functions for |\u03b1s\u3009 and |\u03b1s\u22121\u3009\nWs(En, E\u03b1s) \u2248 \u2211 E\u03b1s\u22121 Ws\u22121(En, E\u03b1s\u22121) \u2329 |\u3008\u03b1s\u22121|\u03b1s\u3009|2 \u232a (2)\nis obtained (see [51]) neglecting the interference terms. This approximation is applicable whenever the perturbation V\u0302s is independent of V\u0302s\u2032 with s\u2032 < s, i.e.,\u2211\nn,n\u2032\n\u2329 n|V\u0302s|n\u2032 \u232a\u2329 n\u2032|V\u0302s\u2032 |n \u232a \u2211 s\u2032\u2032 \u2211 n,n\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2329n|V\u0302s\u2032\u2032 |n\u2032\u232a\u2223\u2223\u22232 . (3) The summations over n and n\u2032 in the microcanonical interval (see [51]) lead to the Berry autocorrelation function [52]. It is localized within the characteristic de Broglie wavelength determined by the characteristic eigenstate energy. Condition (3) is satisfied, for example, if the spatial separation between local potentials exceeds the characteristic de Broglie wavelength (see [51]). (Effect of spatially-separated perturbations on certain characteristics of energy spectra was analyzed in [53].) Other examples are the angular-dependent potentials with no common spherical harmonics in their expansions, such as different terms in multipole expansion, and the potentials of different parity (see [51]).\nThe relation (2) means that an addition of an independent perturbation increases the number of the integrable system eigenstates involved to the non-integrable one (see Fig. 1). This intuitive picture illustrates the quantitative relation presented below.\nSince Ws(En, E\u03b1s) should decay as (En \u2212 E\u03b1s) \u22122 in the limit |En \u2212 E\u03b1s | \u2192 \u221e , (see [51]) but has no singularities as En and E\u03b1s never coincide, the Lorentzian profile\nWL(E,\u0393) = 1\n\u03c0\n\u0393\nE2 + \u03932 (4)\nis a natural choice for the continuous strength function Ws(En, E\u03b1s) \u2248 WL(E\u03b1s \u2212 En,\u0393s)\u2206E. Here \u2206E is the average difference between eigenenergies in the vicinity of E\u03b1s . Such a strength function has been applied to systems with strong random-matrix perturbations [31, 54\u2013 57], when the profile contains many energy levels and \u0393 can be evaluated using the Fermi golden rule. On the integrability-chaos crossover, explored here, the profile may contain only a few levels and the Fermi golden rule can be inapplicable, but the strength function with some \u0393 retains the necessary properties. The averaged IPR \u03b7s \u2261 \u2211 n |\u3008\u03b1s|n\u3009| 4 \u03b1s\n(where the overbar means the microcanonical average over the states \u03b1s) is related to the Lorentzian width \u0393s as (see [51])\n\u03b7s = { 2 3 } \u2206E 2\u03c0\u0393s , (5)\nwhere the factor 3 is chosen for the time reversal (T) invariant and PT invariant systems (where P is the inversion) and 2 is chosen otherwise. For the fixed integrable Hamiltonian H\u03020 determining the energy difference \u2206E Eq. (5), together with the relation \u0393s = \u0393s\u22121 + \u0393\u2032 (see [51]), leads to the recurrence relation for NPC \u03b7\u22121s\n\u03b7\u22121s = \u03b7 \u22121 s\u22121 + \u03bd. (6)\nThe parameter \u03bd is approximately independent of s if the chaotic properties of |\u03b1s\u3009 weakly depend on s and the shape of V\u0302s is independent of s (as for strong scatterers with the same strength). Then (6) provides a linear dependence \u03b7\u22121s = \u03b7 \u22121 2 + (s\u2212 2)\u03bd of NPC on the number of scatterers. An additional independent perturbation increases NPC even if its value is so high that the system can be considered as a completely chaotic one.\nThe prediction (6) is tested for models where the integrability of a particle in a potential with separable coordinates is lifted by s fixed zero-range scatterers. Other examples of such models are flat orthogonal billiards \u2014 multiscatterer generalizations of the Seba billiard [22]. Their energy spectrum properties were analyzed for up to 6 scatterers [23, 24, 43]. Scattering in a harmonic potential was analyzed in [58]. The set of scatterers is a particular case of the rank-s separable potential V\u0302s\u2032 = Vs\u2032 |Fs\u2032\u3009 \u3008Fs\u2032 | with the formfactors |Fs\u2032\u3009. For such potentials the eigenstate expansion coefficients can be expressed as (see [51])\n\u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 = s\u2211\ns\u2032=1\nVs\u2032 \u3008n|Fs\u2032\u3009 \u3008Fs\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009\nE\u03b1s \u2212 En (7)\n3\nin terms of s overlaps \u3008Fs\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009 which obey the set of linear equations\ns\u2211 s\u2032\u2032=1\n( Vs\u2032\u2032\n\u2211 n \u3008Fs\u2032 |n\u3009 \u3008n|Fs\u2032\u2032\u3009 E\u03b1s \u2212 En\n\u2212 \u03b4s\u2032\u2032s\u2032 ) \u3008Fs\u2032\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009 = 0.\n(8) This system has non-trivial solutions if the determinant of its matrix is equal to zero. Then the eigenenergies E\u03b1sare roots of the determinant. High rank separable potentials can also approximate long-range, e.g., dipoledipole, ones [59]. This approximation was used for energy spectra calculation [60].\nThe present models are generalizations of the singlescatterer model [26\u201328, 30]. The integrable Hamiltonian contains the kinetic energy and the radial harmonic potential with the frequency \u03c9\u22a5,\nH\u03020 = ~2\n2m\n[( 1\ni\n\u2202\n\u2202z \u2212A\n)2 \u22124\u03c1 ] + m\u03c92\u22a5\u03c1 2\n2 , (9)\nwhere z and \u03c1 are the axial and radial coordinates, respectively, m is the particle mass, and A is a vector potential. The discrete energy spectrum is provided either by the periodic boundary conditions (PBC), \u3008z + L|\u03b1s\u3009 = \u3008z|\u03b1s\u3009, or by a hard-wall box, \u3008z = 0|\u03b1s\u3009 = \u3008z = L|\u03b1s\u3009 = 0. The formfactors of the separable perturbation are \u3008r|Fs\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4reg(r \u2212 Rs\u2032), where \u03b4reg(r) is the Fermi-Huang pseudopotential, and the scatterer position Rs\u2032 = (0, 0, zs\u2032) has the zero radial component (see Fig. 2). The Hamiltonian H\u0302 is rotationally symmetric along the waveguide axis and the perturbation affects only the states with zero angular momentum. Then, only products |nl\u3009 of the axially symmetric wave function |n\u3009 of two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and (for PBC) a plane wave with the momentum 2\u03c0~l/L are considered here. For hard-wall box, the standing waves with the momentum \u03c0~l/L replace the plane waves (see [51]).\nUnlike a flat billiard with a constant energy density of states, in the present model E\u03b1 \u221d \u03b12/3, as for a threedimensional free particle, and the energy density of states\n\u2202\u03b1/E\u03b1 \u221d E1/2\u03b1 increases with the energy. The logarithmic asymptotic freedom [23] found for flat billiards is related to decreasing effective coupling Veff \u221d 1/ logE. However, it is a specific property of the systems with E\u03b1 \u221d \u03b1. If E\u03b1 \u221d \u03b1\u03b3(\u03b3 6= 1), one can see from the derivation [23] that Veff \u221d E1\u22121/\u03b3 has the same energy dependence as the energy difference between the states \u2202E\u03b1/\u2202\u03b1 \u221d E1\u22121/\u03b3 . Then, the present model, as well as a generic system with \u03b3 6= 1, does not show the asymptotic freedom.\nIn the absence of the vector potential, A = 0, the energy spectrum of the integrable Hamiltonian is degenerate, Enl = En\u2212l. The degeneracy will be lifted by any potential with undefined parity. The vector potential lifts it as well, with no complication of the wavefunctions. However, the Hamiltonian loses the T invariance.\nFour models are considered here. The non-symmetric model is T-noninvariant and the scatterer positions z1 = 0, zs\u2032 = (s\u2032 \u2212 1 + \u03b4s\u2032)L/s (s\u2032 > 1) have no symmetry due to random shifts \u22120.25 \u2264 \u03b4s\u2032 < 0.25 chosen once for each s. The symmetric model with zs\u2212s\u2032+1 = zs \u2212 zs\u2032 and equal Vs\u2032 is PT-invariant, where P is the inversion over zs/2 (this model is not P-invariant, as H\u03020 is not Pinvariant if A 6= 0). The T-invariant model has A = 0 and the same scatterer positions as the non-symmetric one. Only this model has degenerate Enl. The three previous models correspond to PBC, while the fourth, box, model, corresponds to the hard-wall box, has A = 0, and zs\u2032 = (s\u2032 + \u03b4s\u2032)L/(s+ 1).\nSummation over l in (8) can be done analytically (see [51]), leaving a sum over \u223c E\u03b1/(~\u03c9\u22a5) values of n (the closed-channel contributions with n~\u03c9\u22a5 > E\u03b1 decay exponentially with n). As E\u03b1 \u221d \u03b12/3, calculation of the system (8) matrix and its solution require \u223c s2\u03b12/3 and \u223c s3 operations, respectively. Then \u03b1 eigenstates are calculated for \u03b1 s3/2 with \u223c s\u03b15/3 operations (cf. with \u223c \u03b13 operations required by the direct diagonalization method).\nThe integrable system is described by two dimensionless parameters: \u03bb = mL2\u03c9\u22a5/~, characterizing the aspect ratio, and the scaled vector potential l0 = LA/(2\u03c0). In the calculations, \u03bb = \u03c03(1 + \u221a 5) \u2248 100 and l0 = 0.25 \u2212 e\u22124 \u2248 0.232 are expressed in terms of transcendent numbers. Approximately the same results are obtained for any l0 > 0.01. In Fig. 3(a) and (c), Vs\u2032 = 10\n6V0 for all scatterers is in the unitary regime (V0 = 2\u03c0~5/2m\u22123/2\u03c9\u22121/2\u22a5 is the scale of the interaction strength). Approximately the same results are obtained for any Vs\u2032 > V0. In Fig. 3(b), Vs\u2032/V0 = 106, 10\u22121, 10\u22122, 2\u00d7 10\u22123, 10\u22123, 10\u22124, 0 for the 7 IPR values from left to right (the points for Vs\u2032/V0 = 106 and 10\u22121 are almost indistinguishable). Each point in Fig. 3 represents an average over the states 101 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 106 of the non-integrable system.\nThe plots of NPC [see Fig. 3(a)] as a function of the number of scatterers for the four models confirm the\n4 0 10 20 30 40 50\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n(a)\nN P\nC\ns\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n(b)\nV a r \u03b1\n(A ^ )/\nV a r n\nl( A ^\n)\nIPR\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n(c)\nV a r \u03b1\n(A ^ )/\nV a r n\nl( A ^\n)\ns\nFigure 3.

(b) The ratio of variances over eigenstates of the non-symmetric model with 32 scatterers to ones of the integrable system as a function of the inverse participation ratio on the change of the perturbation strength from the unitary regime to zero. (c) The same ratio as a function of the number of scatterers in the unitary regime. In (b) and (c), the symbols represent four observables, namely, the axial momentum (crosses), the part of the transverse potential energy in the total energy (pluses), and the occupations of the positive momenta (triangles) and of the odd axial modes (circles). The lines show IPR.\nlinear dependence (6). The linear fits have two modeldependent parameters: \u03b72, which cannot be predicted by (6) since the system with a single scatterer is not chaotic enough, and \u03bd. In Fig. 3(a), \u03bd = 1.07, 0.7, 0.68, and 0.53 for the non-symmetric, symmetric, box, and Tinvariant models, respectively. Taking into account the symmetry-dependent factors in Eq. (5), we can see that \u0393\u2032 is approximately the same for the first three models.\nThe Lorentzian width is related to IPR by Eq. (5). Figure 3(a) demonstrates the linear dependence even when \u0393s \u223c \u2206E. Therefore, even when the Fermi golden rule is inapplicable to \u0393s as the profile contains only few energy levels, the strength function can be approximated by the Lorentzian profile.\nThe physical implication of the rule (6) is related to the fluctuations of expectation values \u2329 \u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223O\u0302\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b1\u232a of an observable O\u0302, characterized by their variance Var\u03b1(O\u0302) =\u2329 \u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223O\u0302\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b1\u232a2 \u2212 \u2329\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223O\u0302\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b1\u232a2 over the eigenstates |\u03b1\u3009. It is\nproportional to IPR and the variance for the underlying integrable system\nVar\u03b1(O\u0302) = \u03b7Varn(O\u0302) (10)\nas was derived, in slightly different form, in [32]. The applicability criteria of this relation can be determined\nusing the fact that it can also be derived in the same way as the relation between the initial, thermal, and relaxed expectation values (7) in [28] replacing the density matrix by the observable. Then (10), like the relation (7) in [28], is applicable to perturbations with no selection rules. The relation (10) was compared with numerical results [32] for a many-body system with two-body interactions. However, such systems do have selection rules, as each two-body interaction conserves quantum numbers of other particles. It is probably the reason why the numerical results [32] were described by (10) only up to some energy-dependent factor. Systems with separable perturbations have no selection rules, and the relation (10) describes the dependence of variances on the number of scatterers and interaction strength for four observables [see Fig. 3 (b) and (c)]. The observables are: the axial momentum \u3008nl |p\u0302ax|n\u2032l\u2032\u3009 = l\u03b4n\u2032n\u03b4l\u2032l, the occupation of positive momenta \u2329 nl \u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302pos\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032l\u2032\u232a = \u03b4n\u2032n\u03b4l\u2032l\u03b8(l), the occupation of\nthe odd axial modes \u2329 nl \u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302odd\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032l\u2032\u232a = \u03b4n\u2032n\u03b4l\u2032l\u03b4lmod2,1,\nand the part of the transverse potential energy m\u03c92\u22a5\u03c1 2/2 in the total energy, \u2329 nl \u2223\u2223\u2223U\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032l\u2032\u232a = [(2n + 1)\u03b4n\u2032n \u2212 (n +\n1)\u03b4n\u2032n+1 \u2212 n\u03b4n\u2032n\u22121]\u03b4l\u2032l~\u03c9\u22a5/(2Enl). The averages and variances of these observable expectation values over the integrable system eigenstates are directly calculated. The\naverages are \u3008nl |p\u0302ax|nl\u3009 = l0, \u2329 nl \u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302pos\u2223\u2223\u2223nl\u232a = 1/2,\u2329\nnl \u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302odd\u2223\u2223\u2223nl\u232a = 1/2, and \u2329nl \u2223\u2223\u2223U\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223nl\u232a = 1/3. Al-\nthough the average expectation value of the axial momentum is constant, its variation amplitude increases with the state energy. Then, the variance Varnl(pax) = mL2(E\n5/2 max \u2212 E5/2min)/[10\u03c02~2(E 3/2 max \u2212 E3/2min)] depends on\nthe averaging interval [Emin, Emax] boundaries. The variances for other observables are independent of the interval, Varnl(P\u0302pos) = 1/4, Varnl(P\u0302odd) = 1/4, and Varnl(U\u0302) = 1/45. The expectation values over the nonintegrable system eigenstates are calculated using the expansion coefficients (7).\nTogether with (6), the relation (10) provides the decay of fluctuation variance on the increase of the number of scatterers, Var\u03b1(O\u0302) = Varn(O\u0302)/[\u03b7\u221212 + (s \u2212 2)\u03bd], or eigenstate thermalization approaching in a single-body system. Then, a set of fixed scatterers mimics the behavior of many-body systems \u2014 sets of moving scatterers [61]. However, in many-body systems the fluctuations decay exponentially with the number of particles. Then their chaoticity is extremely sensitive to the number of particles and the interaction strength. For fixed scatterers, the fluctuation decay is only inversely proportional to their number. This opens possibilities of fine control of the system chaoticity and exploration of the integrabilitychaos crossover.\nChaotic properties of many-body systems of inter-\n5 acting particles are studied in numerous experimental and theoretical researches. However, due to computational difficulties, a direct numerical simulation is performed for lattice systems (e.g., [14, 17, 19, 31\u2013 33, 37, 38, 40, 41, 44, 47, 48]) with a finite Hilbert space, while the problem complexity increases as a high power of the lattice site number and exponentially with the number of particles. A single particle in an external potential allows us to explore an infinite Hilbert space. Eigenstate thermalization has been analyzed [62] for 3 \u00d7 104 states of a Sinai-type billiard. However, the chaoticity of that system can not be tuned and the calculation of highly excited states is obstructed by the increase of the coordinate grid size. The properties of systems with several independent perturbations (particularly, scatterers) can be tuned by the number of perturbations and their strengths. Although the general results are confirmed by numerical calculations for a specific model, they are applicable to any integrable system, perturbed by several scatterers.\nThe predictions should be testable experimentally in several physical systems. Tightly-trapped cold atoms of one kind can play the role of scatterers for an atom of a second kind in a wide trap. Moreover, several atoms of the second kind \u2014 with interactions between them turned off by a broad Feshbach resonance \u2014 can be used to get averages. In optics, photons in a cavity can be scattered by optical defects [63].\n[1] G. Zaslavsky, Chaos in Dynamic Systems (Harwood, New York, 1985). [2] T. Kinoshita, T. Wenger, and D. S.

References to equations in the Letter do not contain S.\nI. AVERAGES\nThe microcanonical window [Emin, Emax], containing a large number of states NMC, is small compared to the system energy scales. The microcanonical average is defined as\nF (\u03b1) \u03b1 = 1\nNMC \u2211 \u03b1\u2208MC F (\u03b1), (S-1)\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 MC means that Emin < E\u03b1 < Emax. The average over states with a fixed energy difference in the strength function (1) is defined as\n\u3008F (\u03b1, \u03b2)\u3009 = 1 NMC \u2211 \u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032\u2208MC F (\u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032)\u03b4\u0304E\u03b2\u2212E\u03b1+E\u03b1\u2032 ,E\u03b2\u2032 , (S-2)\nwhere \u03b4\u0304E\u03b2\u2212E\u03b1+E\u03b1\u2032 ,E\u03b2\u2032 selects the state \u03b2 \u2032 with the energy E\u03b2\u2032 closest to E\u03b2 \u2212 E\u03b1 + E\u03b1\u2032 .\nII. DERIVATION OF THE RELATION (2)\nConsider at first the Hamiltonian H\u03022 = H\u03020 + V\u03021 + V\u03022. The Schr\u00f6dinger equations lead to the following relations between the eigenstates |\u03b12\u3009, |\u03b11\u3009, and |n\u3009 of the Hamiltonians H\u03022, H\u03021, and H\u03020, respectively,\n\u3008\u03b11|\u03b12\u3009 =\n\u2329 \u03b11|V\u03022|\u03b12 \u232a E\u03b12 \u2212 E\u03b11 , \u3008n|\u03b11\u3009 = \u2329 n|V\u03021|\u03b11 \u232a E\u03b11 \u2212 En\n(S-3)\nLet us represent the expansion coefficients as \u3008n|\u03b12\u3009 = \u2211 \u03b11 \u3008n|\u03b11\u3009 \u3008\u03b11|\u03b12\u3009 and separate the diagonal part of the strength function (1)\nW diag2 (En, E\u03b12) = \u2329\u2211 \u03b11 |\u3008n|\u03b11\u3009|2 |\u3008\u03b11|\u03b12\u3009|2 \u232a\n= 1\nNMC \u2211 E\u03b11 \u2211 n\u2032,\u03b1\u20321\u2208MC |\u3008n\u2032|\u03b1\u20321\u3009| 2 \u03b4\u0304E\u03b11\u2212En+En\u2032 ,E\u03b1\u20321\n1 (E\u03b12 \u2212 E\u03b11)2 \u2211 \u03b1\u20322 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2329\u03b1\u20321|V\u03022|\u03b1\u20322\u232a\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03b4\u0304E\u03b12\u2212E\u03b11+E\u03b1\u20321 ,E\u03b1\u20322 . (S-4)\nThe eigenstates |\u03b1\u20321\u3009 are independent of the potential V\u03022 as the Hamiltonian H\u03021 does not include V\u03022. Besides, E\u03b1\u20321\u2212E\u03b1\u20322 is independent of \u03b1\u20321 since E\u03b1\u20321 and E\u03b1\u20322 are independent being eigenenergies of different non-integrable Hamiltonians. This means that the value of the last sum in Eq. (S-4) appears as the states |\u03b1\u20321\u3009 were indiscriminately chosen from a microcanonical interval. Then the sum can be approximated by its microcanonical average over \u03b1\u20321, leading to\nW diag2 (En, E\u03b12) \u2248 \u2211 E\u03b11 W1(En, E\u03b11) \u2329 |\u3008\u03b11|\u03b12\u3009|2 \u232a . (S-5)\nIf the non-diagonal part of the strength function can be neglected, replacing \u03b12, \u03b11, V\u03022, and V\u03021 by \u03b1s, \u03b1s\u22121, V\u0302s, and\u2211s\u22121 s\u2032=1 V\u0302s\u2032 , respectively, we get the relation (2). In order to evaluate the non-diagonal part, let us represent the expansion coefficients as\n\u3008n|\u03b12\u3009 = 1\nE\u03b12 \u2212 En \u2211 \u03b11 (\u2329 n|V\u03021|\u03b11 \u232a \u3008\u03b11|\u03b12\u3009+ \u3008n|\u03b11\u3009 \u2329 \u03b11|V\u03022|\u03b12 \u232a)\n8 using Eqs. (S-3) and the completeness of the set |\u03b11\u3009 [\u03b11 here is the same as in (S-4)]. The corresponding probabilities can be expressed\n|\u3008n|\u03b12\u3009|2 = 1 (E\u03b12 \u2212 En)2 \u2211 \u03b11,\u03b1\u20321 ( B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( V\u03021, V\u03021,n ) B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( I\u0302 , I\u0302 , \u03b12 ) +B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( I\u0302 , I\u0302 ,n ) B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( V\u03022, V\u03022, \u03b12 ) +B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( I\u0302 , V\u03021,n ) B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( I\u0302 , V\u03022, \u03b12 ) +B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( V\u03021, I\u0302,n ) B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( V\u03022, I\u0302, \u03b12 )) (S-6)\nin terms of the products of the matrix elements\nB\u03b11\u03b1\u20321\n( O\u03021, O\u03022, \u03b2 ) = \u2329 \u03b11|O\u03021|\u03b2 \u232a\u2329 \u03b2|O\u03022|\u03b1\u20321 \u232a .\nIn the generic case, different degrees of freedom of H\u03020 have incommensurate frequencies, and the quantum numbers n and n\u2032 of the energy-neighboring states will be mutually uncorrelated. Then, substituting (S-6) into the strength\nfunction (1), we can replace B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( O\u03021, O\u03022,n ) by its microcanonical average B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( O\u03021, O\u03022,n )n [see (S-1)] and obtain the following approximation for the fixed energy difference average [see (S-2)]\u2329 1\n(E\u03b12 \u2212 En)2 B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321\n( O\u03021, O\u03022,n ) B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( O\u03023, O\u03024, \u03b12 )\u232a \u2248 1\n(E\u03b12 \u2212 En)2 B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321\n( O\u03021, O\u03022,n )n B\u03b1\u20321\u03b11 ( O\u03023, O\u03024, \u03b12 )\u03b12 (S-7)\nThe independence of the random functions \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 and \u3008n|\u03b1\u2032s\u3009 for \u03b1s 6= \u03b1\u2032s [12, 52] leads to the approximate equality of the microcanonical averages\n|\u03b1s \u3009\u3008\u03b1s| \u03b1s \u2248 |n \u3009\u3008n| n (S-8)\nof the product of two eigenfunctions. This results in\nB\u03b11\u03b1\u20321\n( I\u0302 , I\u0302 , \u03b2 )\u03b2 \u2248 1 NMC \u03b4\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 , B\u03b11\u03b1\u20321 ( I\u0302 , V\u0302 , \u03b2 )\u03b2 \u2248 1 NMC \u2329 \u03b11|V\u0302 |\u03b1\u20321 \u232a (S-9)\nif \u03b11 and \u03b1\u20321 belong to the microcanonical interval (otherwise, the averages vanish). Then, using Eqs. (S-6), (S-7), (S-8), and (S-9) one can approximate the diagonal and non-diagonal parts of the strength function (1) as\nW diag2 (En, E\u03b12) \u2248 1\nN 2MC(E\u03b12 \u2212 En)2  \u2211 n,n\u2032\u2208MC (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2329n|V\u03021|n\u2032\u232a\u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2329n|V\u03022|n\u2032\u232a\u2223\u2223\u22232)+ 2 \u2211 \u03b11\u2208MC \u2329 \u03b11|V\u03021|\u03b11 \u232a\u2329 \u03b11|V\u03022|\u03b11 \u232a (S-10)\nW nond2 (En, E\u03b12) \u2248 2\nN 2MC(E\u03b12 \u2212 En)2  \u2211 n,n\u2032\u2208MC \u2329 n|V\u03021|n\u2032 \u232a\u2329 n\u2032|V\u03022|n \u232a \u2212 \u2211 \u03b11\u2208MC \u2329 \u03b11|V\u03021|\u03b11 \u232a\u2329 \u03b11|V\u03022|\u03b11 \u232a . The last, single, sums here can be neglected compared to the double sums. Then, the non-diagonal part is negligible when the condition (3) for s = 2 is satisfied. The recurrent application of this condition provides the condition (3) for any s.\nThe microcanonical average of the product of two eigenfunctions\n\u3008r1|n\u3009 \u3008n|r2\u3009 n \u2248 CBerry(|r1 \u2212 r2|, (r1 + r2)/2)\nis the Berry autocorrelation function [52]\nCBerry(r,R) = \u0393 (D/2) JD/2\u22121(K(R)r)\n(K(R)r/2)D/2\u22121 ,\nwhere D is the number of degrees of freedom (the dimension of the vectors n , r, and R), \u0393 is the \u0393-function, J is the Bessel function (see [64]), and K(R) is the absolute value of the local wavevector. The autocorrelation function decays\n9 when r exceeds the characteristic de Broglie wavelength K\u22121, determined by the mean energy of the microcanonical interval.\nConsider several important cases when W nond2 becomes negligible and, therefore, the condition (3) is satisfied. For local coordinate-dependent potentials V\u03021 and V\u03022 the sum in W nond2 can be transformed as\u2211\nn,n\u2032\u2208MC\n\u2329 n|V\u03021|n\u2032 \u232a\u2329 n\u2032|V\u03022|n \u232a \u2248 \u02c6 dDRdDrV1(R + r/2)V2(R\u2212 r/2)C2Berry(r,R). (S-11)\nThen,W nond2 becomes negligible when the distance between V1 and V2 exceeds the characteristic de Broglie wavelength. If the ranges of V1 and V2 are substantially less than the characteristic scale of H\u03020, we can neglect the R-dependence of the Berry autocorrelation function, substituting CBerry(r,R) \u2248 CBerry(r,R0), where R0 is any point in the vicinity of V1 and V2. Then Fourier transform leads to\u2211\nn,n\u2032\u2208MC\n\u2329 n|V\u03021|n\u2032 \u232a\u2329 n\u2032|V\u03022|n \u232a \u2248 \u02c6 dDpV\u03031(p)V\u03032(\u2212p)C\u03032Berry(p), (S-12)\nwhere\nV\u0303i(p) = (2\u03c0) \u2212D/2 \u02c6 dDrVi(r)e \u2212ipr, C\u03032Berry(p) = (2\u03c0) D/2 \u221e\u0302\n0\nrD\u22121dr JD/2\u22121(pr)\n(pr)D/2\u22121 C2Berry(r,R).\nIn any dimension, if V1 and V2 can be expanded in terms of hyperspherical harmonics, Vi(r) and its Fourier transform V\u0303i(p) are expanded in terms of the same hyperspherical harmonics (see [65]). For example, in the 3D case (D = 3), when Vi(r) = \u2211 l,m vilm(r)Ylm(r/r), its Fourier transforms can be expanded in terms of the same spherical\nharmonics, V\u0303i(p) = \u2211 l,m v\u0303ilm(p)Ylm(p/p), where v\u0303ilm(p) = \u221a 2/\u03c0(\u2212i)l \u00b4\u221e 0 r2drjl(pr)vilm(r) and jl is the spherical Bessel function. Substituting these expansions into Eq. (S-12) we see that, due to the orthogonality of the spherical (or hyperspherical) harmonics, W nond2 vanishes when V1 and V2 do not contain the same harmonics. For example, it is the case when V1 and V2 are different terms in multipole expansion of a potential. The odd (even) Vi(r) includes only spherical harmonics with odd (even) l. Then for the perturbations of different parity the condition (3) is satisfied too.\nThe pseudopotential expansion of multipolar interactions [59] has the form\nV\u0302i = \u2211\nl,m,l\u2032,m\u2032\n|v\u2032il\u2032m\u2032(r)Yl\u2032m\u2032(r/r) \u3009\u3008 vilm(r)Ylm(r/r)| . (S-13)\nThe sum inW nond2 contains the matrix elements \u3008v1lm(r1)Ylm(r1/r1) |CBerry(|r1 \u2212 r2|,R0)| v2l\u2032\u2032m\u2032\u2032(r2)Yl\u2032\u2032m\u2032\u2032(r2/r2)\u3009 \u221d \u03b4l\u2032\u2032l\u03b4m\u2032\u2032m [since the matrix elements have the same form as Eq. (S-11), the derivation above is applicable]. Then different terms in the expansion (S-13) can be considered as independent perturbations.\nEquation (S-10) also shows that Ws(En, E\u03b1s) should decay as (En \u2212 E\u03b1s) \u22122 in the limit |En \u2212 E\u03b1s | \u2192 \u221e.\nIII. DERIVATION OF THE RECURRENCE RELATION (6) FOR NPC\nChoosing the Lorentzian profile (4) for the continuous strength function Ws(En, E\u03b1s) \u2248 WL(E\u03b1s \u2212 En,\u0393s)\u2206E, replacing the sum over E\u03b1s\u22121 by the integral, and substituting \u2329 |\u3008\u03b1s|\u03b1s\u22121\u3009|2 \u232a = W \u2032(E\u03b1s , E\u03b1s\u22121)\u2206E, we reduce (2)\nto the integral equation:\nWL(E\u03b1s \u2212 En,\u0393s) = CSI \u02c6 dE\u03b1s\u22121W \u2032(E\u03b1s , E\u03b1s\u22121)WL(E\u03b1s\u22121 \u2212 En,\u0393s\u22121), (S-14)\nwhere the factor CSI compensates for inaccuracy of the sum-integral replacement. The solution of (S-14) W \u2032(E\u03b1s , E\u03b1s\u22121) = WL(E\u03b1s \u2212 E\u03b1s\u22121 ,\u0393\u2032)/CSI with \u0393\u2032 = \u0393s \u2212 \u0393s\u22121 is obtained using the Fourier transform.\nWhenever it is applicable, the Fermi golden rule provides [31, 54\u201357]\n\u0393s \u2248 \u03c0 N 2MC\u2206E \u2211\nn,n\u2032\u2208MC\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2329 n \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s\u2211\ns\u2032=1\nV\u0302s\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032 \u232a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 .\n10\nFor independent perturbations, obeying the condition (3), the sum over n and n\u2032 above can be split as\n\u2211 n,n\u2032\u2208MC \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2329 n \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s\u2211 s\u2032=1 V\u0302s\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032 \u232a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 = \u2211 n,n\u2032\u2208MC \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2329 n \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s\u22121\u2211 s\u2032=1 V\u0302s\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032 \u232a\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 + \u2211 n,n\u2032\u2208MC \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2329n \u2223\u2223\u2223V\u0302s\u2223\u2223\u2223n\u2032\u232a\u2223\u2223\u22232 . Then \u0393s = \u0393s\u22121 + \u0393\u2032, in the agreement with the general relation derived above.\nUsing Eq. (S-2), we can represent IPR as the average over states with a fixed energy difference\n\u03b7s \u2261 \u2211 n |\u3008\u03b1s|n\u3009|4 \u03b1s = \u2211 n \u2329 |\u3008\u03b1s|n\u3009|4 \u232a . (S-15)\nAccording to Berry\u2019s conjecture [52], non-integrable system eigenfunctions are Gaussian random functions. The Gaussian distribution of the \u3008r|\u03b1s\u3009 values was confirmed even for single-scatterer models [22, 27] which have IPR \u223c 0.5 and, therefore, are rather far from the eigenstate thermalization regime. As a consequence, \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 = \u00b4 dDr \u3008n|r\u3009 \u3008r|\u03b1s\u3009 can be considered as random Gaussian variables. In T-invariant systems, \u3008r|\u03b1s\u3009 and \u3008r|n\u3009 can always be chosen to be everywhere real. Therefore, \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 are real random Gaussian variables. In PT-invariant systems, \u3008\u2212r|\u03b1s\u3009\u2217 = \u00b1\u3008r|\u03b1s\u3009 and \u3008\u2212r|n\u3009\u2217 = \u00b1\u3008r|n\u3009 (the signs \u00b1 in two identities are independent). Then we have either \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009\u2217 = \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009, Im \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 = 0, and \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 being a real random Gaussian variable, or \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009\u2217 = \u2212\u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009, Re \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 = 0, and \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 being a real random Gaussian variable multiplied by i. If the system is not T-invariant nor PT-invariant \u3008n|\u03b1s\u3009 should be considered as complex random Gaussian variables.\nThe fourth moment of a Gaussian variable is the second one squared and multiplied by 2 or 3 for complex or real variables, respectively (see [31]). Then averaged IPR (S-15) can be transformed as\n\u03b7s = { 2 3 }\u2211 n \u2329 |\u3008\u03b1s|n\u3009|2 \u232a2 \u2248 { 2 3 } \u02c6 dEnW 2 L(E\u03b1s \u2212 En,\u0393s)\u2206E = { 2 3 } \u2206E 2\u03c0\u0393s (S-16)\nThis leads to the relation for NPC (6) with \u03bd = 2\u03c0\u0393\u2032/(2\u2206E) or \u03bd = 2\u03c0\u0393\u2032/(3\u2206E), respectively. For large s the chaotic properties of |\u03b1s\u3009 weakly depend on s and if the shape of V\u0302s is independent of s (as for scatterers with the same strength), \u03bd will be approximately independent of s.\nIV. HARMONIC WAVEGUIDE WITH ZERO-RANGE SCATTERERS ALONG ITS AXIS\nProjecting the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the rank-s separable potential( H\u03020 +\ns\u2211 s\u2032=1 Vs\u2032 |Fs\u2032\u3009 \u3008Fs\u2032 | ) |\u03b1s\u3009 = E\u03b1s |\u03b1s\u3009\nonto eigenstates |n\u3009 of H\u03020, we get the expansion coefficients (7). Then we can express |\u03b1s\u3009 in terms of the overlaps \u3008Fs\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009,\n|\u03b1s\u3009 = \u2211 n s\u2211 s\u2032=1 |n\u3009 \u3008n|Fs\u2032\u3009 E\u03b1 \u2212 En Vs\u2032 \u3008Fs\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009 . (S-17)\nFinally, projection of this equation onto the formfactors |Fs\u2032\u2032\u3009 leads to the set of linear equations (8) for the overlaps. Eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of H\u03020 (9) are expressed as\n\u3008\u03c1, z|nl\u3009 = L\u22121/2e2i\u03c0lz/L \u3008\u03c1|n\u3009 , Enl = ~\u03c9\u22a5(2n+ 1) + ~2(2\u03c0l/L\u2212A)2/(2m) (S-18)\nwith \u2212\u221e < l <\u221e for PBC and\n\u3008\u03c1, z|nl\u3009 = (2/L)1/2 \u3008\u03c1|n\u3009 sin\u03c0lz/L, Enl = ~\u03c9\u22a5(2n+ 1) + (\u03c0~l/L)2/(2m) (S-19)\nwith 1 \u2264 l <\u221e for the hard-wall box. Here\n\u3008\u03c1|n\u3009 = 1\u221a \u03c0a\u22a5 L(0)n ((\u03c1/a\u22a5) 2) exp(\u2212(\u03c1/a\u22a5)2/2) (S-20)\n11\nis the radial wavefunction, a\u22a5 = (~/m\u03c9\u22a5)1/2 is the transverse oscillator range, and L(0)n are the Laguerrre polynomials (see [64]). Now n = (n, l) and, like in [26], the sum over l in (8) with the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies (S-18) can be calculated analytically using the formula\n\u221e\u2211 l=\u2212\u221e exp(2i\u03c0l\u03b6) l + a = \u03c0 sin\u03c0a exp(\u22122i\u03c0a(\u03b6 \u2212 [\u03b6]\u2212 1/2)) (S-21)\n(see Eq. (5.4.3.4) in [66]). Then the system (8) attains the form\ns\u2211 s\u2032\u2032=1 Ss\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5) \u3008Fs\u2032\u2032 |\u03b1s\u3009 = 0 (S-22)\nwith Ss\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5) = \u3008Fs\u2032 |S(z \u2212 zs\u2032\u2032 , \u03b5)\u3009Vs\u2032\u2032/V0 \u2212 \u03b4s\u2032s\u2032\u2032 . Here S(z, \u03b5) is the Green function of the integrable system on the waveguide axis. For z \u2265 0 it is expressed as\nS(z, \u03b5) = \u221a \u03bb \u221e\u2211 n=0 1 2pn e2i\u03c0l0z/L [ e2ipnz/L (cot(\u03c0l0 + pn)\u2212 i)\u2212 e\u22122ipnz/L (cot(\u03c0l0 \u2212 pn)\u2212 i) ] , (S-23)\nwhere \u03b5 = mL2(E \u2212 ~\u03c9\u22a5)/(2~2) and pn = \u221a \u03b5\u2212 \u03bbn. For z < 0 we have S(\u2212z, \u03b5) = S\u2217(z, \u03b5). The formfactors \u3008r|Fs\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4reg(r\u2212Rs\u2032) are expressed in terms of the Fermi-Huang pseudopotential \u03b4reg(r)f(r) = \u2202\u2202r [rf(r)]r=0 which extracts the regular part of the function f(r) at r \u2192 0. Then for s\u2032 6= s\u2032\u2032 we have Ss\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5) = S(zs\u2032 \u2212 zs\u2032\u2032 , \u03b5) since S(zs\u2032 \u2212 zs\u2032\u2032 , \u03b5) is regular in this case. However, S(z, \u03b5) has a pole at z \u2192 0. The asymptotic of the irregular part at z \u2192 0\n\u2212 \u221a \u03bb \u221e\u2211 n=[\u03b5/\u03bb]+1 e\u22122|pn|z/L |pn| \u223c \u2212 L\u221a \u03bbz \u2212 \u03b6 ( 1 2 , [ \u03b5 \u03bb ] + 1\u2212 \u03b5 \u03bb )\nis expressed, as in [67] in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function (see [64]). The term \u223c 1/z is eliminated by the Fermi-Huang pseudopotential. Then we can represent the diagonal matrix elements as\nSs\u2032s\u2032(\u03b5) = Vs\u2032\nV0\n[ \u221a \u03bb\n\u221e\u2211 n=0 ( sin 2pn pn(cos 2\u03c0l0 \u2212 cos 2pn) + \u03b8(n\u2212 \u03b5/\u03bb) |pn| ) \u2212 \u03b6 ( 1 2 , [ \u03b5 \u03bb ] + 1\u2212 \u03b5 \u03bb )] \u2212 1.\nIn the T-invariant model, A = l0 = 0 and the function (S-23) is real. The case of a hard-wall box is treated in a similar way. For s\u2032 \u2265 s\u2032\u2032 we have\nSs\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5) = \u2212 Vs\u2032\u2032\nV0\n[ \u221a \u03bb\n\u221e\u2211 n=0 ( 2 sin 2pn(1\u2212 zs\u2032/L) sin 2pnzs\u2032\u2032/L pn sin 2pn \u2212 \u03b8(n\u2212 \u03b5/\u03bb) |pn| \u03b4s\u2032s\u2032\u2032 ) + \u03b6 ( 1 2 , [ \u03b5 \u03bb ] + 1\u2212 \u03b5 \u03bb ) \u03b4s\u2032s\u2032\u2032 ] \u2212 \u03b4s\u2032s\u2032\u2032\nand Ss\u2032\u2032s\u2032(\u03b5) = Ss\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5). The homogeneous system of linear equations (S-22) has non-trivial solutions if the determinant of its matrix is\nequal to zero. Then the roots \u03b5\u03b1 of the determinant, det(Ss\u2032s\u2032\u2032(\u03b5\u03b1)) = 0, give us the non-integrable system eigenenergies E\u03b1 = 2~2\u03b5\u03b1/(mL2) + ~\u03c9\u22a5 and solutions of the system (S-22), being substituted to Eq. (S-17), provide the eigenfunctions."
