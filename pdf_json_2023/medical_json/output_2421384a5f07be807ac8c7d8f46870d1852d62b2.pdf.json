    "abstractText": "Epidermal electronics, an emerging interdisciplinary field, is advancing the development of flexible devices that can seamlessly integrate with the skin. These devices, especially Electric Double Layer (EDL)-based sensors, overcome the limitations of conventional electronic devices, offering high sensitivity, rapid response, and excellent stability. Especially, Electric Double Layer (EDL)-based epidermal sensors show great potential in the application of wearable electronics to detect biological signals due to their high sensitivity, fast response, and excellent stability. The advantages can be attributed to the biocompatibility of the materials, the flexibility of the devices, and the large capacitance due to the EDL effect. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of EDL epidermal electronics as wearable sensors for health monitoring and wound healing. These devices can analyze various biofluids, offering real-time feedback on parameters like pH, temperature, glucose, lactate, and oxygen levels, which aids in accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Beyond healthcare, we explore the role of EDL epidermal electronics in human-machine interaction, particularly their application in prosthetics and pressure-sensing robots. By mimicking the flexibility and sensitivity of human skin, these devices enhance the functionality and user experience of these systems. This review summarizes the latest advancements in EDL-based epidermal electronic devices, offering a perspective for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",

            "text": "The skin, as the largest organ in the human body, serves as a critical interface for sensing environmental stimuli and extracting bioelectric signals [1]. This unique position renders it an invaluable platform for healthcare applications, disease diagnosis [2], and human-machine interaction. Consequently, the field of epidermal electronics, which focuses on the development of flexible and conformal electronic devices to monitor physiological signals from the human body, has experienced a surge of interest and growth [3]. However, conventional electronic devices often fall short in terms of flexibility [4], biocompatibility [5\u20137], and permeability [8], permeability refers to the ability of a device to allow for the natural exchange of substances, such as gases, fluids, or even ions, between the skin and the environment. This attribute is particularly important to maintain the skin\u2019s normal functions and health, like breathing and sweat secretion, while the device is attached. Highly permeable devices can minimize the obstruction of these natural processes, reducing the potential for skin irritation or damage and improving the comfort and wearability of the device. which are essential for effective interfacing with the skin. This discrepancy leads to significant mechanical and biological mismatches [9,10]. Therefore, the pursuit of high-performance epidermal electronic devices that can efficiently collect and process a diverse range of biological signals is of paramount importance in this field [11].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13080787 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 2 of 29\nEpidermal devices show great potential in health monitoring due to their inherent advantages in flexibility, biocompatibility, and permeability. These properties enable them to seamlessly conform to the skin\u2019s surface, reducing discomfort and interference with normal skin function. Moreover, their ability to continuously monitor various physiological signals in real-time meets the escalating demand for rapid diagnostics and treatment in modern healthcare. This real-time and continuous monitoring capability of epidermal devices can potentially revolutionize healthcare by enabling early detection. A promising solution to the development of high-performance epidermal electronics involves the design and fabrication of devices based on the electrical double layer (EDL) effect [12,13]. EDLs, typically formed at the interface between electrolytes and conductors, offer substantial capacitance due to the EDL effect. In epidermal electronics, EDLs can be harnessed as tactile sensors by exploiting the capacitive characteristics contributed by the EDL capacitance formed at electrolyte-conductor interfaces [14]. These sensors can respond to both static and dynamic stimuli. Additionally, EDL-based devices can serve as biosensors to extract physiological signals with a high signalto-noise ratio, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), leveraging the EDL effect. The performance of EDL-based epidermal electronic devices can be further enhanced by optimizing the materials, structures, and system designs. Furthermore, EDLbased devices can respond to mechanical stimulation, making them suitable for applications that require the detection of physical changes or movements. This feature, combined with their ability to process electrochemical signals, broadens their potential use in health monitoring and diagnostics. These properties of EDL are illustrated in Figure 1. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current status of EDLbased epidermal electronics, covering material synthesis, device fabrication, integration technology, and device applications. We will discuss the various materials employed in the construction of epidermal electronic devices [15\u201318], including metallic materials, polymeric materials, and biomaterials. The influence of these materials\u2019 mechanical and electrical properties, as well as their biocompatibility, will be emphasized [19\u201321]. We will also delve into device fabrication and integration technology, offering insights into the methods for fabricating flexible devices and systems capable of adhering to the skin. Furthermore, we will present the potential applications of EDL-based devices in mechanical signal sensing [22], bioelectrical signal monitoring [21], and electrochemical sensing [23]. It is our hope that this review will serve as a comprehensive guide to the current state and future prospects of epidermal electronics, laying a solid foundation for the development of the next generation of wearable electronics.

            "text": "In the field of electrochemistry, the Electric Double Layer (EDL) stands out as a molecularly thin interface separating two substances populated by electrically charged particles. These can include an electrode from a solid material and an electrolyte solution [29]. Constituted of two layers of opposite charges, the EDL is structured by the adsorption of ions on the solid surface, thereby forming one layer. Concurrently, the other layer forms within the proximate solution near the surface. Owing to the separation between these charges, the EDL possesses a remarkably high capacitance. Consequently, the EDL holds a pivotal role in affecting various physical and chemical processes unfolding at the interface. Owning to the advantages of EDL, an EDL electrode emerges as an electrode to store electric charge at the electrolyte solution interface [30]. By their high charge density and rapid charge-discharge rates, EDLs are attractive in applications, such as electrochemical capacitors, sensors, and actuators. However, it is imperative to note that the performance relies on the factors, such as electrode material and electrolyte composition [31] as presented in Table 1. Also, an Electric Double Layer Transistor (EDLT) can be designed and fabricated based on the EDL effect [32]. This unique type of transistor employs an electrolyte solution as the gate dielectric. By inducing a significant volume of charge carriers through the EDL, the EDLT can modulate the electrical transport in the transistor channel. With low voltage operation, high transconductance, and compatibility with organic semiconductors, EDLTs extend their potential use into the production of flexible, stretchable, and biocompatible electronic circuits. EDLT can be applied in the fields of biosensors, neuromorphic devices, and memory devices [33]."

These visuals underscore the preliminary phases of the microfluidic injection process, carried out with a syringe, all contained within a sleek, elastomeric microfluidic enclosure. While polymeric materials have been widely employed in flexible electronics, their low electrical conductivity poses a challenge to further enhance the device\u2019s performance. To overcome this issue, conductive polymers such as polyaniline [59], polypyrrole [60], and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) [61] were developed. In addition, through doping these conductive polymers with other materials like carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metallic nanoparticles, researchers were able to further enhance their electrical conductivity.

The devices showed promising applications in wearable electronics, sensors, and actuators due to their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, as shown in Figure 3g. In addition, they demonstrated that the nanocomposite material could be used to fabricate a self-healing strain sensor that could recover its functionality after being damaged by cutting or tearing. To better understand the working mechanism of the EDL effect in these materials, it is important to develop theoretical and experimental methods that can capture the microscopic structure of the electrochemical interface and its working mechanisms. However, modeling and measuring the EDL structure for complex systems involving conductive polymers and their hybrid materials remains a challenge. For example, the effects of polymer chain conformation, molecular interactions, and ion solvation on EDL behavior are not fully understood.

While each technique has its advantages and drawbacks, advancements in subtractive manufacturing, along with the development of novel hybrid and additive processes, will contribute to the development of epidermal electronic devices by enhancing their performance, functionality, and conformability with the human body. Lithography is a versatile manufacturing technique that utilizes light to pattern the thin film. As a result, a desired shape or structure can be defined. This technique is widely\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 10 of 29\nused in epidermal electronics, where lithography can be applied to produce thin, flexible, and conformable devices with microstructures to monitor various physiological signals. In a study by Khodagholy et al. [87], researchers utilized lithography to fabricate high-density conformable electrode arrays for epidermal electronic applications, as shown in Figure 5a. This device can record local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal action potentials (APs) from the brain surface without penetrating the brain surface. This neural interface array is based on organic materials and is ultra-compliant, biocompatible, and scalable, allowing coverage of large cortical areas while maintaining high resolution and stability. In 2018, Semple et al. reported a lithography method based on a single self-assembled monolayer (SAM), as shown in Figure 5b [88]. This technique enables the preparation of electrodes with a resolution of 15 nm and has been successfully applied to a wide range of flexible electronic devices such as high-speed Schottky diodes, memory resistors, highly sensitive photodiodes, metal oxide transistor arrays, RF diodes, and nano-LEDs.\nLaser cutting is a technique that uses a high-power laser beam to cut materials into desired patterns, with advantages in fast speed, low cost, and high accuracy. This method can also be applied to fabricate epidermal electronics that can conform to the skin and have sensing, heating, and communication functions. For example, Sadri et al. developed paper-based epidermal electronic devices for wearable and implantable applications by using spray-based deposition of salinizing agents and conductive inks followed by laser cutting technology to create paper-based devices with different shapes and functions [89].

Shahariar et al. explored the potential of inkjet printing on textiles for the integration of passive electronic devices and sensors [91]. They proposed a novel inkjet printing process that uses particle-free reactive silver ink on uncoated polyester textile knit, woven, and nonwoven fabrics. This method allows the ink to conformally coat individual fibers, creating a conductive network within the textile structure without altering its durability and mechanical behavior. They also found that the electrical conductivity of the inkjet-printed conductive coating could be significantly improved through in situ heat-curing during the printing process.

This review summarizes the potential of inkjet printing in epidermal electronics and offers a low-cost, scalable, and automated manufacturing process. Screen printing This technique is able to transfer material with a designed pattern onto a stretchable and flexible substrate using a stencil or mesh screen. In brief, the substrate is covered with the screen, which is then used to squeegee the ink through the mesh openings and onto the substrate, a circuit with the desired pattern can be realized. For example, Wang et al. demonstrated the potential of screen printing for fabricating stretchable and wearable strain sensors [92].

In addition, EDL pressure sensors can monitor pulse waves and blood pressure, two pivotal health indicators [77,131,132]. In 2017, Li et al. introduced a flexible supercapacitive sensing modality to fabric materials via an elastic ionic-electronic interface. The novel design offered high sensitivity [133], noise immunity, and remarkable stability for wearable pressure and force sensing, as depicted in Figure 11c. In 2019, Huang et al. developed EDL pressure sensors to detect pulse wave signals and estimate blood pressure non-invasively by attaching the sensor to the wrist or finger [133]. Another compelling application lies in monitoring muscle movements and plantar pressure. In 2022, Hua et al. presented an EDL pressure sensor [134] that could be incorporated into wearable devices like gloves, socks, or shoes. The sensor effectively measured muscle activation and foot pressure distribution during various activities such as walking, running, or cycling, thereby aiding users in improving their posture, balance, and performance.\n5.1.2. Bioelectrical Signal Monitoring\nBioelectrical signals hold paramount importance in the monitoring of human physiology and various disease states [135\u2013139]. The EDL-gated FET biosensor array has emerged as an effective platform for probing ion channels and bioelectric signals of circulating tumor cells, signifying a revolutionary advancement in diagnostic procedures. Luo et al. [139] demonstrated the significant strides made in EEG monitoring via EDLgated FET biosensors, introducing a wearable, non-invasive methodology for capturing cerebral activity. The employment of these devices in sleep research, neurofeedback therapy, and the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions such as epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease is noteworthy. The research underscored high accuracy in differentiating various mental states when these devices were employed to detect cerebral activity during diverse cognitive tasks. Additionally, Luo et al. [139] highlighted how EDLgated FET biosensors have significantly contributed to EMG monitoring. These devices enable the measurement of EMG signals, mirroring the electrical activity of muscles. These measurements can be used to assess muscle function, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, and guide rehabilitation efforts. Reports of these systems being used to monitor muscle activity in amputees and control robotic prostheses, as stated in recent research [140], illustrate potential applications. Moreover, comprehensive EMG systems capable of measuring muscle activity and incorporating flexible strain and temperature sensors have been developed. This system provides a wealth of information about muscle function and health, as depicted in Figure 12a.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 19 of 29\nBeyond EEG and EMG monitoring, EDL-gated FET biosensors have significantly contributed to the detection of cellular transmembrane potential, specifically in the context of ion channels and bioelectric signals in cells. Moreddu et al. introduced a novel approach offering a non-invasive and high-throughput method for monitoring bioelectrical activity, as shown in Figure 12b [138]. Their research revealed that the presence of a HEK-293 cell on the electrode increased fluorescence intensity output by 5.8% compared to bare microelectrodes. This technology holds the potential for evaluating cell-substrate adhesion\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 20 of 29\nand monitoring cell proliferation, opening new possibilities for examining the electrical phenomena involved in cell migration and cancer progression. Pulikkathodi et al. presented an EDL-gated FET-based biosensor technology capable of detecting biomarkers [141], such as whole cells and transmembrane potential, with high sensitivity. This sensor can record the bioelectric signals of cells and assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases like cancer by identifying specific cell types and functions. The principle of their work is depicted in Figure 12c. Biosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 23 of 31\nFigure 12.

[143] introduced a flexible, transparent iontronic film serving as a thin-film capacitive sensing material for wearable and healthmonitoring applications. The film can measure pressure distribution and dynamic pressure changes with superior resolution and accuracy, as shown in Figure 13a,b. Figure 11c demonstrates one such application.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 22 of 29\n5.2.3. Therapeutic Applications in Rehabilitation\nEDL pressure sensors can support physical therapy and rehabilitation by tracking muscle and bone movements, identifying potential complications as summarized by Table 4. These results can guide clinicians in providing effective and personalized treatment for patients. For example, Xu et al. [142] reported the use of EDL pressure sensors for monitoring knee joint posture and movement post-orthopedic surgery. The collected data can be processed through deep learning algorithms to provide feedback and guidance for improved rehabilitation.\nFurthermore, EDL-based epidermal electronics can also play a role in drug delivery. Kim et al. [86] presented research utilizing the electric double-layer effect to precisely control the permeability of nanopores and regulate molecular flow. The researchers designed an electrically gated nanoporous membrane composed of metal oxide nanotubes coated with polymers possessing different charges inside and outside the tubes. Applying an electric field caused the polymers to either repel or attract, changing the pore size and dynamically regulating the passage of molecules. The research demonstrated that this electrically gated nanoporous membrane could control drug molecule delivery precisely. The flow of drugs could be swiftly turned on or off by merely altering the electric field parameters, highlighting promising applications of electronic devices in drug therapy and controlled release. Despite the remarkable progress made for EDL sensors in healthcare, a number of potential challenges and limitations need to be considered. Safety and biocompatibility are paramount for biomedical devices. Long-term exposure to these devices and any potential side effects should be investigated. For instance, potential allergic reactions to the materials used, the risk of infection from prolonged use, and the potential impact on skin health need to be studied [83,84]. Another major issue lies in the accuracy and reliability of these sensors. While EDL sensors demonstrate high sensitivity and range, factors such as ambient temperature, humidity, and external mechanical stress could potentially influence their performance. As such, calibration protocols and error correction methods should be established to ensure the accuracy and reliability of measurements [77,85]. Finally, while the use of EDL sensors in drug delivery is promising, the control of drug release based on electrical fields is a complex task. Factors such as the rate of drug release, drug degradation, and the effect of electrical fields on drug stability require careful consideration [86].\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 787 23 of 29"

            "text": "In conclusion, the emergence of epidermal electronics holds transformative potential in realms such as healthcare and human-machine interfaces. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest developments in EDL-based epidermal electronics, with a particular emphasis on the synthesis and preparation of materials, device fabrication methodologies, and systems-level applications. These advancements have heralded the inception of flexible, conformal, and biocompatible electronic devices that integrate seamlessly with human skin. However, despite these noteworthy achievements, significant challenges remain that limit the potential enhancement of EDL-based devices, specifically the biocompatibility, stability, reliability, and scalability. The biocompatibility of these devices is challenged by the materials, which can induce skin irritation, inflammation, or hypersensitivity reactions, and potential electrolyte leakage or evaporation could pose hazards to both the skin and the environment. The stability of EDL-based devices is vulnerable to external factors such as mechanical deformation, temperature fluctuations, humidity alterations, and sweat secretion. Furthermore, the reliability of these devices can be influenced by several factors like electrode surface roughness, electrolyte viscosity, ion size, valence, concentration, and applied voltage, which may lead to variations in device capacitance or impedance, introducing potential errors or noise into signal detection or transmission. Lastly, the scalability of these devices faces restrictions due to the limitations of traditional fabrication methods, such as photolithography, inkjet printing, and screen printing, and the complexity increases with the size or number of devices, necessitating sophisticated design and fabrication approaches.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.G. and H.Z.; writing-original draft preparation, Y.G. and H.Z.; writing-review and editing, Q.L.; visualization, H.Z., B.S. and C.Z.; supervision, Q.L.; funding acquisition, Q.L.; Y.G and H.Z. contributed equally to this paper.
