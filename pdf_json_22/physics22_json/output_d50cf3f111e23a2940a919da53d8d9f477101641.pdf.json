James Department of Physics, University of Toronto\n60, St. George St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A7\n(Dated: July 29, 2022)\nWe consider the kinematics of bi-partite quantum states as determined by observable quantities, in particular the Bloch vectors of the subsystems. In examining the simplest case of a pair of twolevel systems, there is a remarkable connection between the presence of non-classical correlations and the chirality of the two bases generated by the singular value decomposition of the correlation matrix of the Bloch vectors. We investigate the limits imposed by quantum mechanics of this effect and it relationship with other methods on quantifying the system\u2019s non-classical behaviour.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEntanglement is the intimate correlation between two or more separated systems peculiar to quantum mechanics [1]. The past three decades have seen a remarkable growth in interest in this phenomenon, spurred on by the promise of revolutionary applications in communications and information processing [2]. For bipartite systems in a pure quantum state, entanglement is well characterized and can be quantified reasonably uncontroversially, for example by calculating the degree of purity or entropy of the reduced density matrix of one of the sub-systems. However, extending this characterization to mixed states remains problematical. Even in the simplest non-trivial case, that of a pair of two-level systems (or qubits), a large number of generalizations of the definition of quantum entanglement have been proposed, and none can be unequivocally declared preeminent [3]. As a general rule, these are all based on some notion of information content of the system; For example, Wootters\u2019s famous work [4] provides a compact, reasonably easy-to-evaluate formula for the entanglement of formation of a mixed state of two qubits (see Appendix A for a discussion). The Entanglement of Formation has its maximum if the state is a fully entangled pure state, and is zero if and only if the state is separable (in the sense defined by Werner [5]). And yet, to quote Wootters: \u201cthere remains a basic question concerning the interpretation of the entanglement of formation that has not yet been resolved\u201d. The veritable menagerie of related measures of non-classical correlations have since been investigated by other authors [6, 7]; after 25 years, it would be a bold quantum mechanic who would assert the existence of a single unequivocal quantitative metric of quantumness.\nImportant though quantum information is, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is one possible application of a physical effect, and that quantum mechanics is not a branch of information theory or computer science. By fixating on quantum information, which may or may not ultimately lead to a widely deployable technology, we may be overlooking fundamental physical aspects of the phenomenon, as well implicitly marginalizing other\npossible applications, as yet unknown and unexplored. Hence a physically motivated, easily calculable operational method in which to define and quantify the notion of quantum coherence remains strongly desirable.\nIn this paper we approach this problem from such a different perspective. Heretofore the density operator \u03c1 has been regarded as the operational quantity used to specify a multi-partite quantum state, and attempts to characterize entanglement all ultimately rest on the evaluation of some function of \u03c1. However we suggest that this seems a peculiar approach, given the fact that \u03c1 cannot be observed directly, and must instead be deduced via quantum state tomography [8, 9], which, even for quite simple systems, involves a burdensome program of data collection and computational reduction. The observable quantities in quantum mechanics are the correlations between the results of joint measurements carried out upon systems prepared in the appropriate state; an ensemble (in principle infinite, in practice of finite size) of such measurements uniquely specifies the state. Indeed, Hardy has shown one can derive a consistent quantum theory using such quantities as the operational variables [10]. The Bloch vector provides a mathematically compact, elegant and intuitive way in which to arrange these observable quantities for the simple case of a single two-level system. This formulation was introduced to describe the dynamics of nuclear spins in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments [11] (although historically similar concepts had been considered much earlier to describe rigid body dynamics [12] and optical polarization [13]). Bloch vectors have been found to be invaluable in the description of the dynamics of single two-level atomic systems [14, 15], so much so that we should be loath to abandon them when considering two or more such systems. Specifically, here we examine whether the correlations between the Bloch vectors for individual qubits can be used to investigate quantum correlations of a multiqubit system without first having to deduce the density matrix. While properties of the density matrix are employed in the derivation of our results, ultimately this results can be calculated without resorting to the tribulation of tomographic state reconstruction. ar X iv :2 20 7. 13 80 8v 1 [ qu an tph ]\n2 7\nJu l 2\n02 2\n2 The paper is organized as follows: first, we consider the properties of the Bloch vector representation of qubit pairs, and introduce the Sinisterness S as a quantitive measure of correlation. We next consider the relationship between this quantity and the density operator, which will be useful in establishing its mathematical properties. We illustrate our results by calculating the Sinisterness for a number of important categories of quantum states, which serves to illustrate its connection with other types of correlation, in particular the Concurrence. A number of the more involved mathematical derivations are included in the Appendices. A preliminary report of the results presented here was published in [16]."

For a single two-level system, the average of this vector is the Bloch vector, defined as follows:\na = \u3008\u03c3\u3009 \u2261 Tr{\u03c1(A)\u03c3}, (2.1) where \u03c3 is the vector formed of the Pauli operators, with cartesian components \u03c31 = |1\u3009\u30082| + |2\u3009\u30081|, \u03c32 = i|1\u3009\u30082| \u2212 i|2\u3009\u30081| and \u03c33 = |2\u3009\u30082| \u2212 |1\u3009\u30081|, (|1\u3009 and |2\u3009 being the two levels of the system), and \u03c1(A) is the density operator, which we interpret as a compact means of specifying the probability densities of the random variables associated with our system. For a single isolated qubit these probabilities are all completely specified by the Bloch vector; specifically, the density operator is related to the Bloch vector by the formula:\n\u03c1(A) = 1\n2 (I + a \u00b7 \u03c3) , (2.2)\nwhere I = |2\u3009\u30082|+ |1\u3009\u30081| is the identity operator. For the bipartite system, besides the average values of the two Bloch vectors for the individual qubits, a and b, we also consider the cross-correlation tensor of the two spins, defined by\ncij = 1\n4 \u3008(\u03c3i \u2212 aiI)\u2297 (\u03c3j \u2212 bjI)\u3009, (2.3)\nwhere we have introduced the tensor product \u2297 to combine the two spaces of individual systems, with ordering implying on which sub-space operators act. The matrix cij is real, but not necessarily symmetric; its nine components, together with the six components of a and b completely specify the probability distribution of the bipartite system:\n\u03c1(AB) = 1 2 (I + a \u00b7 \u03c3)\u2297 1 2 (I + b \u00b7 \u03c3) + 3\u2211 i,j=1 cij\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j .\n(2.4)\nDecompositions of this kind were first considered by Fano some time ago [19] and have found considerable utility in the theory of entanglement and in quantum state tomography [8]. In particular, the geometric properties of a related correlation tensor and its connection to quantum coherence have been discussed by Englert and Metwally [20]."

            "text": "If all the components of cij are zero, the state is factorable, and the two sub-systems are completely uncorrelated. If that is not the case, we are immediately confronted with the issue of how to interpret these correlations. To begin this task, we invoke the principle that coherence properties must be independent of any local change of basis. For Bloch vectors, a unitary operation is equivalent to a transformation of three-dimensional coordinate axes introduced implicitly by the definition of \u03c31, \u03c32 and \u03c33. Thus it behoves us to choose some particular set of axes which will simplify the system. Particularly useful sets of axes is provided by the singular value decomposition [23], of the matrix cij , which we shall write as follows:\ncij = 3\u2211 p,q=1 Uip\u03a3pqV T qj , (2.5)\nwhere U and V are orthogonal matrices, and \u03a3 is a real, non-negative definite diagonal matrix. We shall denote the singular values (i.e. the diagonal elements of \u03a3) as sp (p = 1, 2, 3), thus eq.(2.4) may be re-written as\n\u03c1(AB) = 1 2 (I + a\u2032 \u00b7\u03b1)\u2297 1 2 (I + b\u2032 \u00b7 \u03b2) + 3\u2211 p=1 sp\u03b1p \u2297 \u03b2p,\n(2.6) where a\u2032i = \u2211 j U T ijaj , b \u2032 i = \u2211 i V T ijbj , \u03b1i = \u2211 j U T ij\u03c3j and\n\u03b2i = \u2211 j V T ij\u03c3j .\nHowever this is not simply a special case of eq.(2.4) written with new coordinate axes so that the crosscorrelation term is diagonal. While the matrices U and V are real orthogonal matrices in three dimensions, they are not necessarily proper rotations, implying that the two sets of system-dependent operators {\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13} and {\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23} do not necessarily obey the standard commu-\n3 tation relations for Pauli operators. Thus, for example,\n[\u03b1p, \u03b1q] = 3\u2211 i,j=1 UTpiU T qj [\u03c3i, \u03c3j ]\n= 3\u2211 i,j=1 UTpiU T qj\n( 2i\n3\u2211 k=1 ijk\u03c3k\n)\n= 2i 3\u2211 i,j,k,r=1 UTpiU T qj ijkUkr\u03b1r\n= 2i 3\u2211 r=1 \u2032pqr\u03b1r (2.7)\nwhere ijk is the usual Levi-Civita tensor and \u2032 pqr =\u22113\ni,j,k=1 ijkU T piU T qjU T rk. Like ijk, the transformed ten-\nsor \u2032pqr is completely anti-symmetric, e.g.\n\u2032prq = 3\u2211 i,j,k=1 ijkU T piU T rjU T qk\n= 3\u2211 i,j,k=1 ikjU T piU T rkU T qj = \u2212 3\u2211\ni,j,k=1\nijkU T piU T qjU T rk\n= \u2212 \u2032pqr. (2.8)\nSimilar arguments may be applied to interchanging any two indices. Thus it follows that \u2032pqr = ( \u2032 123) pqr, where\n\u2032123 = Det{UT }. Since Det{UT } = Det{U} it follows\n\u2032pqr = Det{U} pqr. (2.9)\nFurther, since Det{UUT } = Det{I} = 1, it follows that Det{U} = \u00b11; When Det{U} = 1, the transformation U is a proper rotation, under which the chirality of the coordinate system and commutation relation is not changed; however, when Det{U} = \u22121 the rotation is improper and a right-handed set of basis vectors is transformed into a left-handed set. Thus the commutation relation eq.(2.7) reduces to\n[\u03b1p, \u03b1q] = 2iDet{U} 3\u2211 r=1 pqr\u03b1r. (2.10)\nSimilar remarks apply to \u03b2p and V. If both U and V are improper rotations, it is straightforward to interchange the labels of any two of the singular values sp to render them into proper rotations. However, if one is proper and the other one improper, this is not possible: swapping the label of sp to convert the the improper matrix to be proper will have the reverse effect on the other transformation.\nIt is a remarkable fact that, for all entangled states, one of these transforms is proper and the other improper; or\ngeometrically speaking, the two diagonalized coordinate frames for the two qubits have opposite chirality. Following Dr. Joseph Altepeter, who seems to have been the first to point out a connection between chirality of Bloch vector representations and entanglement [21], we refer to states with this chiral property as sinisterness (from the Latin word for left-handed).\nThe determinant of the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix cij is related to the singular value decomposition in a useful way. The determinant is given by the usual expression\nS \u2261 Det{c} = 1 6 3\u2211 i,j,k,l,m,n=1 ijk lmncilcjmckn. (2.11)\nSubstituting eqs.(2.5) and (2.9) , we find that\nS = 1 6 3\u2211 i,j,k,l,m,n=1 ijk lmn\n\u00d7 3\u2211 p=1 UTpispV T pl 3\u2211 q=1 UTqjspV T qm 3\u2211 r=1 UTrkspV T rn\n= 1\n6 Det{U}Det{V} 3\u2211 p,q,r=1 ( pqr) 2spsqsr\n= Det{U}Det{V}s1s2s3. (2.12)\nThe singular values sk are all positive, while determinants are either +1 for a proper rotation, or \u22121 for an improper rotation. Thus a simple way to determine whether or not a state is sinister is to calculate the determinant of its correlation matrix cij : if it is negative, the state is sinister. Indeed, as we shall see, the value of this determinant in fact reveals some quantitative features of the state, so much so that we suggest it may be useful considering it as an alternative way to quantify the quantumness of a state. Accordingly, we define the Sinisterness of a state to be given by the formula\nS = Det{cij} (2.13) = Det{\u3008(\u03c3i \u2212 aiI)\u2297 (\u03c3j \u2212 bjI)\u3009/4} (2.14)\nOne important property is readily apparent: since the value of the determinant is invariant under proper rotations, the Sinisterness is invariant under local unitaries, an important feature usually required of any measure of quantum correlation."

There is, in general, an infinite number of such a decompositions for any separable state; however there exists some optimal decomposition for which the number of terms has the smallest possible value, called the optimal ensemble cardinality, L, of the state [24]. One might conjecture the value of the optimal ensemble cardinality L by counting independent parameters: a pair of d-level quantum systems has Hilbert space of dimension N = d2; a density matrix in an N -dimensional space has N 2 \u2212 1 = d4 \u2212 1 independent real parameters. A normalized, pure state of a d-level system with an arbitrary global phase has 2(d \u2212 1) real parameters, hence the Werner decomposition of a separable state of two d-level systems with N terms in the convex hull has (4(d \u2212 1) + 1)N \u2212 1 real parameters, when we take into account the weighting factors and the normalization. Thus, na\u0308\u0131vely, one might expect an arbitrary separable state should have an optimal ensemble cardinality L \u2264 dd4/(4d \u2212 3)e. In the case d = 2, this gives L \u2264 4; Indeed Wootters has demonstrated how to construct a Werner decomposition for a separable pair of two-level systems with at most four terms (see [4], eq.(23)), confirming that L \u2264 4 in this case.\nLet us thus write the \u201coptimal\u201d Werner decomposition as follows:\n\u03c1 (AB) separable = 4\u2211 n=1 pn|\u03c8n\u3009\u3008\u03c8n| \u2297 |\u03c6n\u3009\u3008\u03c6n|, (4.30)\nwhere \u22114 n=1 pn = 1, and pn \u2265 0 (and we have included the case that L < 4 by allowing the value of pn to be zero). Without loss of generality, we can assume that p1 \u2265 p2 \u2265 p3 \u2265 p4. Defining the unit vectors an = \u3008\u03c8n|\u03c3|\u03c8n\u3009 and bn = \u3008\u03c6n|\u03c3|\u03c6n\u3009, we find\ncij = 4\u2211 n=1 pn(an,i \u2212 a\u0304i)(bn,j \u2212 b\u0304j), (4.31)\nwhere a\u0304 = \u22114 n=1 pna\u0304n and b\u0304 = \u22114 n=1 pnb\u0304n. In Appendix A it is shown that the determinant of this matrix (and thus the Sinisterness) can be written in the following relatively compact form\nSsep = 36 p1p2p3p4 V(a1,a2,a3,a4)V(b1,b2,b3,b4), (4.32) where V(a1,a2,a3,a4) = [(a1 \u2212 a2)\u00d7 (a2 \u2212 a3)] \u00b7 (a3 \u2212 a4)/6 is an antisymmetric quadruple vector product whose magnitude is equal to the volume of the pyramid whose vertices have the position vectors a1, a2, a3 and a4.\nSome useful conclusions may be drawn from eq.(4.32). Firstly, if optimal ensemble cardinality L of the separable state is 3 or less, then by definition, p4 = 0 and we immediately find that S = 0. Further, since an and bn are both Bloch vectors corresponding to pure states, they are unit vectors. As is shown in Appendix B, the maximum volume for a pyramid whose vertices lie on the unit sphere is 8/9 \u221a 3. Further, the maximum possible product p1p2p3p4 occurs when p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = 1/4. Thus we find that:\n\u2212 1/27 \u2264 Ssep \u2264 1/27 (4.33)\nwith the immediate implication that if S < \u22121/27 the state must be entangled.

            "text": "Here we provide a proof for the formula for the maximum volume of the tetrahedron whose vertices A, B, C and D all lie on the surface of a sphere. Let O be the center of the sphere (of radius R) and O\u2032 the center of the circumscribed circle KABC of the triangle ABC (see Fig,(3)).\nThe volume of the pyramid ABCD is VABCD = 1 3hDAABC , where hD is the perpendicular height of D above the ABC plane, and AABC is the area of the triangle ABC. In terms of the vector product, AABC = 1 2 | \u2212\u2212\u2192 AB \u00d7 \u2212\u2212\u2192 BC|, while, using the scalar product hD = \u2212\u2212\u2192 CD\u00b7( \u2212\u2212\u2192 AB\u00d7 \u2212\u2212\u2192 BC)/| \u2212\u2212\u2192 AB\u00d7 \u2212\u2212\u2192 BC|; thus VABCD = 16 | \u2212\u2212\u2192 CD\u00b7 ( \u2212\u2212\u2192 AB\u00d7\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 BC)| = 16 |[( \u2212\u2192 OA\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2192 OB)\u00d7( \u2212\u2212\u2192 OB\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2192 OC)]\u00b7( \u2212\u2212\u2192 OC\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2192 OD)|. To find the maximum value of VABCD first, let us show that \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O is perpendicular to the plane ABC. Let the z-axis be perpendicular to the plane ABC, so that any point P on the circumference of KABC has the position vector \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032P = r(cos\u03c6, sin\u03c6, 0), where r is the radius of KABC . Using the same coordinate axes, let \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O = a(sin \u03b80 cos\u03c60, sin \u03b80 sin\u03c60, cos \u03b80), and hence | \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032P \u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O| = \u221a r2 + a2 \u2212 2ar sin \u03b80 cos(\u03c6\u2212 \u03c60). Since all points on KABC are on the surface of the sphere it follows that | \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032P \u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O| = R, for all values of \u03c6; hence differentiating the square root term with respect to \u03c6 we find sin \u03b80 = 0 and hence \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O = (0, 0, a), i.e. parallel to the z-axis and hence perpendicular to the plane ABC. Now we shall demonstrate the maximum value of hD is a+R, which occurs when \u2212\u2212\u2192 OD \u2016 \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O. If we write \u2212\u2212\u2192 OD = R(sin \u03b8d cos\u03c6d, sin \u03b8d sin\u03c6d, cos \u03b8d) and \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032O = (0, 0, a) we find hD = \u2212\u2212\u2192 O\u2032D \u00b7 ~ez = a + R cos \u03b8d. Thus, differentiating to find the maximum, we find \u2202hD/\u2202\u03b8d = 0 and \u22022hD/\u2202\u03b8 2 d < 0 when \u03b8d = 0, implying \u2212\u2212\u2192 ODmax = R(0, 0, 1) and hD,max = a+R.\n9 The next step is to maximize the area of the triangle ABC. Intuition tells us that the maximum will occur in the symmetric situation, i.e. ABC is an equilateral triangle. However intuition, like sincerity, is always subject to proof, which we now supply. Referring to Fig.(4), the area AABC = AABO\u2032 + ABCO\u2032 \u2212 AACO\u2032 = 12r\n2[sin(\u03b1) + sin(\u03b2)\u2212 sin(\u03b1+\u03b2)], where r is the radius of the circumscribed circle, \u03b1 is the angle AO\u2032B and \u03b2 is the angle BO\u2032C, as shown. Differentiating AABC , we find the condition for a maximum:\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b1 AABC =\nr2\n2 [cos(\u03b1)\u2212 cos(\u03b1+ \u03b2)] = 0 (B.1)\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b2 AABC =\nr2\n2 [cos(\u03b2)\u2212 cos(\u03b1+ \u03b2)] = 0. (B.2)\nThese equations imply that, at a maximum or minimum, cos(\u03b1) = cos(\u03b2), and hence \u03b2 = \u00b1\u03b1, (where we assume \u03b1 and \u03b2 have values between 0 and 2\u03c0 . If \u03b2+\u03b1 = 0, eqs.(B.1-B.2) imply that cos(\u03b1) = cos(\u03b2) = 1, and sin(\u03b1) = sin(\u03b2) = 0 and hence the area AABC = 0. Similarly, if \u03b2 = \u03b1, eq.(B.1) implies cos(\u03b1) = cos(2\u03b1), and hence \u03b1 = 2\u03b1, i.e. \u03b1 = 0 (which again, implies AABC = 0), or \u03b1 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b1, or \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 2\u03c0/3. This last case corresponds to the equilateral triangle; it can be confirmed to be the maximum by showing that the eigenvalues of the Hessian are all negative. Since sin(2\u03c0/3) = \u221a 3/2 and sin(4\u03c0/3) = \u2212 \u221a 3/2, we find AABC,max = 3 \u221a 3r2/4.\nThe last step is to maximize the volume VABCD,max = 1 3AABC,maxhD,max = a + R. The only remaining underdetermined parameter is a, the length OO\u2032. By Pythagoras\u2019s Theorem, r2 = R2 \u2212 a2, and hence VABCD,max(a) = (a+R)(R2\u2212 a2) \u221a 3/4. Differentiating, we find \u2202\u2202aVABCD,max = 0 when a = \u2212R or a = R/3. The former solution corresponds to a minimum (volume zero), while the second corresponds to the maximum. Hence we finally obtain VABCD,max = R38/9 \u221a\n3. Using this solution, it can be shown reasonably straightforwardly that the distances between any two of the points\nA, B, C and D is the same, viz., R \u221a\n8/3, and thus the maximum volume corresponds to a regular tetrahedron."

As with the pure state, the complex-conjugate of the density operator \u03c1\u2217 is defined in the standard computational basis (this operation is basis dependent: if, for example, we did a complex conjugation in the eigenbasis of \u03c1, it would not have any effect)."

            "text": "Alternatively (and in the present problem, fortuitously, since the square roots of non-commuting operators in the expression forR are awkward to manipulate analytically) one can show that eq.(D.7) is equivalent to\nC(\u03c1) = max{ \u221a r1 \u2212 \u221a r2 \u2212 \u221a r3 \u2212 \u221a r4, 0}, (D.8)\nwhere rn (n = 1, ...4, again numbered in decreasing magnitude) are the eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian matrix defined by the formula\nR = \u03c1\u0303\u03c1. (D.9)\nRelevant properties of non-Hermitian matrices and their bi-orthogonal expansions are reviewed briefly in Appendix C. Let us denote the left and right eigenvectors of R by \u3008un| and |vn\u3009 respectively; they are normalized in the way described in Appendix C, i.e. \u3008un|vn\u3009 = \u03b4mn. Thus\n\u3008un|R = rn\u3008un| (D.10) R|vn\u3009 = rn|vn\u3009 (D.11)\nThe transpose of eq.(D.11) gives\n\u3008v\u2217n|RT = rn\u3008v\u2217n|, (D.12)\nwhere RT = \u03c1T (\u03c32\u2297\u03c32)\u03c1(\u03c32\u2297\u03c32) = (\u03c32\u2297\u03c32)R(\u03c32\u2297\u03c32). Hence\n\u3008v\u2217n|(\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c32)R = rn\u3008v\u2217n|(\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c32). (D.13)\nThus the left eigenvectors of R are just the \u201cspin-flipped\u201d right eigenvectors |un\u3009 = |v\u0303n\u3009, and we obtain\n\u3008v\u0303m|vn\u3009 = \u03b4mn. (D.14)\nIf we now took the Hermitian adjoint of eq.(D.11), and use the fact that both \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0303 are both Hermitian, we obtain:\n\u3008vn|\u03c1\u03c1\u0303 = r\u2217n\u3008vn|. (D.15)\nMultiplying both sides on the right by \u03c1, we find\n\u3008vn|\u03c1R = r\u2217n\u3008vn|\u03c1. (D.16)\nComparing with eq.(D.10) we see this implies that the eigenvalues rn are all real, and that, after normalizing,\n|v\u0303n\u3009 = \u03c1|vn\u3009 \u3008vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009 . (D.17)\nThe bi-orthonality property eq.(C.4) thus implies\n\u3008vn|\u03c1|vm\u3009 = \u03b4mn\u3008vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009. (D.18)\nAlthough in a sense we have diagonalized \u03c1, this equation does not imply |vn\u3009 is an eigenvector of \u03c1, since the vectors |vn\u3009 are not orthogonal, as would be the case for the eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator. The eigenvalues rn are, from eqs.(C.1),(C.6) and (D.14), given by\nrn = \u3008v\u0303n|R|vn\u3009 = \u2211 m \u3008v\u0303n|\u03c1\u0303|v\u0303m\u3009\u3008vm|\u03c1|vn\u3009\n= \u3008v\u0303n|\u03c1\u0303|v\u0303n\u3009\u3008vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009. (D.19)\nSince (\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c32)2 = I, matrix element \u3008v\u0303n|\u03c1\u0303|v\u0303n\u3009 is equal to \u3008v\u2217n|\u03c1\u2217|v\u2217n\u3009, which, because of the Hermiticity of \u03c1, reduces to \u3008vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009. Hence the eigenvalues rn are all real non-negative numbers, and\n\u3008vm|\u03c1|vn\u3009 = \u221a rn\u03b4mn. (D.20)"

Here we will derive an expression for the first order change in Concurrence, \u03b4C. Note that \u03b4\u03c1 is constrained to be Hermitian and trace zero, and that \u03c1+ \u03bb\u03b4\u03c1 is non-negative definite. We also implicitly assume that C(\u03c1) 6= 0, so this analysis should be treated with caution for states that are close to being separable. The first order perturbation to the matrix R is \u03b4R =\n12\n\u03c1\u0303(\u03b4\u03c1) + (\u03b4\u03c1\u0303)\u03c1, and the first order perturbation to the eigenvectors is given by eq.(C.11):\n|\u03b4vn\u3009 = \u3008v\u0303n|\u03b4vn\u3009|vn\u3009+ \u2211 m\nm6=n\n\u3008v\u0303m|\u03b4R|vn\u3009 rn \u2212 rm |vm\u3009. (D.21)\nNormalization of the perturbed eigenvectors implies that \u3008v\u0303n|\u03b4vn\u3009 + \u3008\u03b4v\u0303n|vn\u3009 = 0; using \u3008\u03c6\u0303|\u03c8\u3009 = \u3008\u03c8\u0303|\u03c6\u3009, we see\nthat this implies 2\u3008\u03b4v\u0303n|vn\u3009 = 0, hence the first term on the right hand side of eq.(D.21) must be zero. Using eq.(D.20), we find\n\u221a rn + \u03bb\u03b4( \u221a rn) = {\u3008vn|+ \u03bb\u3008\u03b4vn|} {\u03c1+ \u03bb\u03b4\u03c1} {|vn\u3009+ \u03bb|\u03b4vn\u3009}+O[\u03bb2]\n= \u3008vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009+ \u03bb {\u3008vn|\u03b4\u03c1|vn\u3009+ \u3008\u03b4vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009+ \u3008vn|\u03c1|\u03b4vn\u3009}+O[\u03bb2] (D.22)\nFrom eq.(D.21) we find\n\u3008vn|\u03c1|\u03b4vn\u3009 = \u2211 m\nm6=n\n\u3008v\u0303m|\u03b4R|vn\u3009 rn \u2212 rm \u3008vn|\u03c1|vm\u3009\n= 0, (D.23)\nwhere we have used eq.(D.20); a similar analysis shows that \u3008\u03b4vn|\u03c1|vn\u3009 = 0. Hence we obtain \u03b4( \u221a rn) = \u3008vn|\u03b4\u03c1|vn\u3009, which implies the following expression for the variation in the Concurrence:\n\u03b4C = Tr{W\u03b4\u03c1}. (D.24)\nwhere\nW = |v1\u3009\u3008v1| \u2212 |v2\u3009\u3008v2| \u2212 |v3\u3009\u3008v3| \u2212 |v4\u3009\u3008v4|. (D.25)\nTo re-iterate: |vn\u3009 is the right-eigenvector of the operator R = \u03c1\u0303\u03c1, normalized so that \u3008v\u2217n|(\u03c32 \u2297 \u03c32)|vm\u3009 = \u03b4mn; these vectors do not form an orthonormal basis, and in general the terms in the definition of eq.(D.25) are not projectors.\nFor the specific case of the Werner state, we have the simplification that RW is Hermitian, eq.(4.35), and thus the bi-orthogonal basis states are also orthogonal. In this case eq.(D.25) reduces to W = 2\u03a0\u2212 I, and hence writing \u03b4\u03c1 = \u03c1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c1W we find\n\u03b4CW = 2 (\nTr{\u03a0\u03c1\u2032} \u2212 (3 + 1) 4\n) , (D.26)\nwhere we have used Tr{\u03a0\u03c1W } = (3 + 1)/4."
