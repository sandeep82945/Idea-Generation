    "abstractText": "We explore type II supersymmetric double field theory in superspace. The double supervielbein is an element of the orthosymplectic group OSp(10, 10|64), which also governs the structure of generalized superdiffeomorphisms. Unlike bosonic double field theory, the local tangent space must be enhanced from the double Lorentz group in order to eliminate unphysical components of the supervielbein and to define covariant torsion and curvature tensors. This leads to an infinite hierarchy of local tangent space symmetries, which are connected to the super-Maxwell\u221e algebra. A novel feature of type II is the Ramond-Ramond sector, which can be encoded as an orthosymplectic spinor (encoding the complex of super p-forms in conventional superspace). Its covariant field strength bispinor itself appears as a piece of the supervielbein. We provide a concise discussion of the superspace Bianchi identities through dimension two and show how to recover the component supersymmetry transformations of type II DFT. In addition, we show how the democratic formulation of type II superspace may be recovered by gauge-fixing.",

            "text": "The massless sector of the bosonic string can be described in a duality-covariant way in the language of double field theory (DFT) [1\u20136]. In this approach, the metric, KalbRamond field, and dilaton are encoded in a generalized metric that transforms under generalized diffeomorphisms, which encompass standard diffeomorphisms and abelian Bfield transformations. The generalized metric nominally depends on twice the usual number of coordinates: the additional coordinates can be understood as dual to winding modes of strings. Different duality frames correspond to different solutions of a section condition that determines which coordinates are the physical ones. For type II superstrings, the above constituents describe only the massless part of the NS-NS sector. An additional (bosonic) sector, the massless Ramond-Ramond sector, involves a complex of p-form field strengths that describe either the IIA or IIB superstring depending on whether p is even or odd. Finally, the massless R-NS sectors involve the gravitini and dilatini. Since the IIA and IIB superstrings are related by (spacelike) Tduality, their complete massless sectors ought to also be described within the framework of double field theory. Indeed, this was shown by Hohm, Kwak, and Zwiebach for the Ramond-Ramond sector [7, 8], and by Jeon, Lee, Park, and Suh for the Ramond-Ramond and fermionic sectors as well [9, 10].1 The two approaches [7, 8] and [9, 10] are fascinating in how complementary they are in their treatment of the Ramond-Ramond sector. Hohm, Kwak, and Zwiebach employ the metric formulation of double field theory and encode the Ramond-Ramond sector in a spinor of O(D,D). Since spinors of O(D,D) encode p-form complexes of GL(D), this is a very natural assignment and it is inspired by earlier approaches involving torus compactifications [13, 14]. No mention is made of the generalized vielbein of DFT since there is no need for it: as a purely bosonic formulation, one can make do with the generalized metric. In contrast, the supersymmetric approach of Jeon, Lee, Park, and Suh includes the gravitini and dilatini and fully analyzes their supersymmetry transformations. The Ramond-Ramond sector is described not as a spinor of O(D,D) but as a bispinor of O(D \u2212 1, 1) \u00d7 O(1, D \u2212 1); in common parlance, it possesses \u201cflat\u201d rather than \u201ccurved\u201d spinor indices, and this in turn bears relation to early work by Hassan [15, 16]. All of this is quite natural from the perspective of the supersymmetry transformations, of course, because the complex of Ramond-Ramond p-forms appears there as a flattened bispinor. (A closely related discussion was given in the context of generalized geometry [17, 18], which is equivalent to double field theory when the section condition is explicitly solved.) Very recently, we have discussed in some detail the connection between the spinor and bispinor formulations of the Ramond-Ramond sector [19], and this permits one to connect the results of [7, 8] and [9, 10] without any gauge-fixing. The goal of the present paper is to explore type II double field theory in superspace, where supersymmetry is geometrized along with the duality symmetry, in a way that allows us to directly make contact with [7, 8] and [9, 10]. In fact, one of Siegel\u2019s early papers\n1The generalized metric and Ramond-Ramond sector also emerge as the lowest two levels in the O(10, 10) decomposition of E11 [11, 12]. We will return to this point in the conclusion.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\non what we now call type I double field theory couched it in a superspace setting [2]. We revisited Siegel\u2019s work recently [20]. Let us briefly highlight some of the crucial features of this superspace approach:\n1. The type I supervielbein is an element of the orthosymplectic group OSp(10, 10|32), which is a straightforward supersymmetrization of O(10, 10). However, the local tangent space group is not just O(9, 1)L \u00d7 O(1, 9)R. Nor is it the largest natural sub-supergroup, which would be OSp(9, 1|32)L \u00d7 O(1, 9)R. Rather, the left tangent space symmetry is extended from O(9, 1)L to a proper subgroup HL \u2282 OSp(9, 1|32)L. (Actually, it is only the connected part, including SO+(9, 1), because we fix the chirality of supersymmetry.) The Lie algebra of this group was explored and it was shown how it is precisely what is needed to eliminate from the type I supervielbein all but the physical fields.\n2. In order for a local connection to exist to define the torsion tensor, the local symmetry group HL must be extended to a new group H\u0302L (with the additional generators leaving the supervielbein inert). Notably, the bosonic truncation of this suggested that the right-handed sector O(1, 9)R should also be extended to a new group O\u0302(1, 9)R. For example, a new local symmetry appears at dimension 1 that gauges the shift symmetry of the irreducible hook representation of the Lorentz connection. A new connection is then introduced for this local symmetry, new symmetries must be gauged, and so on, leading to a (presumably) infinite hierarchy of additional local gauge symmetries and associated (composite) connections of increasing engineering dimension.\n3. The extended group H\u0302L is dual to the super-Maxwell\u221e algebra recently explored in [21, 22]. Using the Pol\u00e1\u010dek-Siegel framework for gauge symmetries in double field theory [23] (see also appendix B of [20] for a detailed discussion), this lets one naturally define the torsion and curvature tensors that either vanish or involve only physical components (i.e. the generalized Ricci tensor and scalar in the Riemann tensor). After solving the superspace Bianchi identities, the covariant torsion and curvature tensors lead to the correct supersymmetry transformations of supersymmetric type I DFT [24, 25]. In addition, it appears possible there may exist higher curvatures beyond dimension two, although this point has yet to be explored.\nThe above results each have clear extensions to type II double field theory, and the first part of this paper will address this. There is past work on type II DFT in superspace by Hatsuda, Kamimura, and Siegel [26, 27] and by Cederwall [28], elements of which inspire the work here. In the former approach, only the double Lorentz group is employed and a number of torsion constraints are imposed on the supervielbein. This appears to be in contradiction with our results, where the additional connections in H\u0302L\u00d7 H\u0302R are crucial for constraining the torsion tensors. Presumably the results in [26, 27] could be recoverable after further constraining our supervielbein (either by hand or by gauge choice); but as we will see, the extra gauge symmetries are crucial for building invariant torsions and curvatures and for making sense of the truncations to component DFT and conventional type II superspace. The work by Cederwall (who also gauged the double Lorentz group)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nintroduced a key idea: just as the Ramond-Ramond p-forms of GL(D) lift to super pforms of GL(D|s) in conventional type II superspace (for D = 10 and s = 32), RamondRamond spinors of O(D,D) ought to lift to spinors of OSp(D,D|2s). Understanding this prescription in detail and how the Ramond-Ramond sector is simultaneously observed in the DFT supervielbein (as argued in [26\u201328]) is one of our main results. The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 provides a concise discussion of the superspace structure of type II DFT from the perspective of the supervielbein, extended connections, torsion constraints, and Bianchi identities. Much of this is directly analogous to the type I situation. We give a complete solution to the Bianchi identities, specifying torsions and curvatures through dimension two. The new ingredient, the Ramond-Ramond orthosymplectic spinor, will be introduced in section 3 where we discuss both curved and flat spinors and the constraints on the Ramond-Ramond spinor field strength. The physical component fields and their supersymmetry transformations will be derived in section 4, recovering the results [10] of Jeon et al. Then in section 5, we will explain how conventional type II superspace can be recovered in a democratic way, encompassing not only IIA and IIB but also their variants IIA\u2217 and IIB\u2217, which arise by timelike T-duality [29]. We offer some concluding comments and speculate on extensions and open problems in section 6. Finally, there are two appendices. The first addresses our 10D spinor conventions, while the second is a technical discussion about decomposing the DFT supervielbein."

This approach was essentially pioneered by Siegel [2], who addressed what we now call type I and heterotic double field theory, and reintroduced by Hatsuda, Kamimura, and Siegel [26, 27] and Cederwall [28]. Our previous work [20] addressed type I DFT (D = 10, s = 16) and here we will be concerned with type II (D = 10, s = 32). The details are essentially the same so we will be brief. The supercoordinates are collectively denoted zM.

(2.2)\nThe metric \u03b7 itself is graded symmetric, \u03b7MN = \u03b7NM(\u22121)nm.

A similar statement applies to its dual winding coordinate, z\u0303M = (x\u0303m, \u03b8\u0303\u00b5\u0302). We have denoted the fermionic index with a hat for later convenience: in type II superspace, there are two copies of the fermions and we can further decompose \u03b8\u00b5\u0302 = (\u03b8\u00b5, \u03b8\u00b5\u0304). The supervielbein is naturally taken as a weighted element of OSp(D,D|2s)\u00d7R+. As in the bosonic case, it is more convenient to split the supervielbein into an OSp(D,D|2s) element, which we denote VMA, and a separate scalar density, the superdilaton \u03a6, which we take to have weight 1. These transform respectively as\n\u03b4VMA = \u03beN\u2202NVMA + ( \u2202M\u03be N \u2212 \u2202N \u03beM(\u22121)nm ) VNA , (2.7a)\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u03beN\u2202N\u03a6 + \u2202N \u03beN \u03a6 (\u22121)n . (2.7b)\nThe condition that the supervielbein is a group element amounts to\nVAM = \u03b7MNVNB\u03b7BA (\u22121)am . (2.8)\nThe supervielbein admits a conventional level decomposition, with the OSp(D,D|2s) generator TMN decomposed into the GL(D|s) generator TMN at level 0 and nilpotent generators TMN and TMN at levels \u00b11. Exponentiating each of these gives three independent matrix factors which can be combined in the conventional way2\nVMA = (\n1 B 0 1 ) \u00d7 ( E 0 0 E\u2212T ) \u00d7 ( 1 0 S 1 ) ,\nB = BMN (\u2212)n, E = EMA, E\u2212T = EAM (\u22121)am+a, S = SAB .\n(2.9)\nIn this expansion, EMA is an invertible supermatrix that can be identified as the supervielbein, BMN is the Kalb-Ramond super-two-form, and SAB is an additional scalar superfield, which will turn out to contain the dilatino and Ramond-Ramond bispinor, as we will discuss\n2The field S was denoted C in the context of type I DFT [20] and is typically denoted \u03b2 in bosonic DFT.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nshortly. Let us presume the section condition to be trivially satisfied with \u2202\u0303M = 0. Then under generalized diffeomorphisms (2.7) with \u03beM = (\u03be\u0303M , \u03beM ), these fields transform as\n\u03b4BMN = 2 \u2202[M \u03be\u0303N ] + \u03beP\u2202PBMN + 2 \u2202[M |\u03bePBP |N ] , (2.10a) \u03b4EM\nA = \u03beN\u2202NEMA + \u2202M\u03beNENA , (2.10b) \u03b4SAB = \u03beM\u2202MSAB (2.10c)\nThis decomposition of the supervielbein is the simplest means of identifying the various type II superfields present, although it is not completely correct: not every orthosymplectic element (or O(D,D) element for that matter) can be put in this form. The above decomposition really applies to a specific connected component, and this is related to the topology of the supergroup in ways we will discuss in due course. A key point to mention is that the topology of a supergroup is determined by its bosonic part, which in the case of OSp(D,D|2s) is O(D,D) \u00d7 Sp(2s,R). Since the symplectic groups are connected, the topology of the orthosymplectic group is determined by the split orthogonal group, and this decomposes into four pieces O(\u03b1,\u03b2)(D,D) with \u03b1 = \u00b11 and \u03b2 = \u00b11 depending on whether there is an orientation reversal in either factor in the maximal compact subgroup O(D)\u00d7O(D). This has been discussed at length in [19], building off a discussion in [9, 10], and we will discuss in section 5 how to generalize it.3\nThe superdilaton meanwhile transforms as a scalar density\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u03beN\u2202N\u03a6 + \u2202N\u03beN \u03a6 (\u22121)n (2.11)\nand one can define the conventional dilaton superfield \u03d5 by factoring out the superdeterminant of EMA,\ne\u22122\u03d5 = \u03a6\u00d7 sdetEMA . (2.12)\nRecalling that the conventional dilaton is given in component DFT by e\u22122\u03d5 = e\u22122d \u00d7 det ema, one can see that e\u22122d differs from \u03a6 by a factor of sdetEMA/ det ema."

This cannot be a generic element of OSp(D,D|2s), as then the entire DFT supervielbein could be gauged away. The simplest possibility, advocated by Hatsuda, Kamimura, and Siegel [26, 27] and Cederwall [28], is for the local symmetry group to simply be the double Lorentz group. Recall that in the bosonic case, the local tangent space symmetry group is O(D\u2212 1, 1)\u00d7O(1, D\u2212 1) and can\n3A slightly different parametrization will be used in section 4 for component DFT, but we will show how to relate them.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nbe defined as a subgroup of O(D,D) that also leaves invariant not just \u03b7a\u0302b\u0302 but also a flat metric Ha\u0302b\u0302; these are given by\n\u03b7a\u0302b\u0302 = ( 0 \u03b4ab\n\u03b4ab 0\n) , Ha\u0302b\u0302 = ( \u03b7ab 0 0 \u03b7ab ) . (2.14)\nThen for the bosonic double vielbein, decomposed as in (2.9), one can gauge Sab to zero, leaving behind the diagonal Lorentz subgroup to be the local symmetry group of the vielbein ema. However, in the superspace framework, this is unsatisfactory because it leaves unphysical components behind in the supervielbein, specifically in whatever is left unfixed in SAB.\nHere is a good opportunity to elaborate on the tangent space vector indices A. In the bosonic theory, a double vectorW a\u0302 can be decomposed either toroidally asW a\u0302 = (W a, W\u0303a), or chirally as W a\u0302 = (W a,W a); these are related by\nW a = 1\u221a 2 (W a + \u03b7abW\u0303b) , W a = 1\u221a 2 (W a \u2212 \u03b7abW\u0303b) . (2.15)\nIn the chiral decomposition, \u03b7a\u0302b\u0302 and Ha\u0302b\u0302 are given by 4\n\u03b7a\u0302b\u0302 = ( \u03b7ab 0 0 \u03b7ab ) , Ha\u0302b\u0302 = ( \u03b7ab 0 0 \u2212\u03b7ab ) , \u03b7ab = \u2212\u03b7ab = \u2212\u03b7ab . (2.16)\nIn the superspace case, one naturally assigns the fermionic components of A to be spinors of one or the other Lorentz groups. For type I DFT, they carried spinor indices \u03b1 of the left Lorentz group. For type II, there will be both left and right spinor indices, \u03b1 and \u03b1. It will occasionally be useful to group all left indices together. Then the unbarred capital Roman indices A = (a, \u03b1) transform only under the left Lorentz group and the barred capital Roman indices A = (a, \u03b1) transform only under the right, and we write\nWA = (WA,WA) = (Wa,W\u03b1,W \u03b1, Wa,W\u03b1,W \u03b1) , WA = (WA,WA) = (W a,W\u03b1,\u2212W\u03b1, W a,W\u03b1,\u2212W\u03b1) , (2.17)\nand\n\u03b7AB = ( \u03b7AB 0\n0 \u03b7AB\n) =  \u03b7ab 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b7ab 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0\n ,\n4In our type I DFT paper [20], we took the opposite sign for \u03b7ab. The advantage of the choice made here is that all formulae for the right sector follow from the left sector merely by barring expressions.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\n\u03b7AB = ( \u03b7AB 0\n0 \u03b7AB\n) =  \u03b7ab 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b7ab 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0  . (2.18)\nA natural proposal for the tangent space group might seem to be extend the bosonic case by introducing a flat supermetric HAB. This is not really the right approach. An easy way to see this is that in conventional superspace, the supervielbein EMA is the fundamental geometric object and there is no natural notion of an invertible supermetric. The closest analogue is GMN = EMaENb\u03b7ab; however, (i) this is not invertible, and (ii) does not involve the gravitino one-form EM\u03b1 and so it doesn\u2019t completely encode the relevant physics. Within double field theory, one could address at least the first issue by constructing an invertible HAB by adding a sign to the right-handed sector of \u03b7AB; this mirrors the bosonic situation (2.16) and then one could build projectors 12(\u03b4A\nB \u00b1 HAB) onto the left and right-handed sectors. However, the relevant local symmetry group is not the group leaving invariant \u03b7 and H: this group, OSp(D \u2212 1, 1|s)L \u00d7OSp(1, D \u2212 1|s)R, is too large.\nInstead, we argued in [20] that the original proposal of Siegel [2], inspired by the Hamiltonian description of the superstring worldsheet, was more sensible. Let\u2019s review Siegel\u2019s proposal for type I DFT. There the spinors are valued in the left Lorentz group and this group is extended with the parameters \u03bb subject to the conditions\n\u03bb\u03b1 b = 0 , \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 4\u03bb ab(\u03b3ab)\u03b1\u03b2 . (2.19)\nwith \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 , \u03bbab, and \u03bba\u03b2 unconstrained except for the symmetry conditions \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b2\u03b1 and \u03bbab = \u2212\u03bbba. The second condition above amounts to the requirement that fermionic orthosymplectic indices transform as spinors under the SO(9, 1) subgroup of OSp(9, 1|32). In addition, as we showed in [20], it is natural to include an additional constraint on the fermionic parameter \u03bba\u03b2 ,\n(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u03b2\u03bba\u03b2 = 0 (2.20)\nwhich eliminates its spin-1/2 part. The upshot is that we have three local symmetries, generated by \u03bbab, \u03bba\u03b2 , and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 . This group, which we denoted HL, is a subgroup (for type I) of OSp(9, 1|32). It is also precisely the right group to eliminate the unphysical parts of the tensor SAB of the supervielbein (2.9). For type I, this tensor consists of Sab, Sa\u03b2 , and S\u03b1\u03b2 , and the \u03bb parameters allow one to eliminate all but the spin-1/2 part of Sa\u03b2 \u2014 this is the dilatino.\nFor type II DFT, the obvious proposal is to require the local symmetry group of the supervielbein to be HL \u00d7 HR where HR is just a copy of HL. For type II DFT, the tensor\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nSAB now consists of\nS\u03b1\u03b2 S\u03b1\u03b2 S\u03b1\u03b2\nSa\u03b2 Sa\u03b2\nSab\nWe can eliminate Sab, the spin-3/2 pieces of Sa\u03b2 and Sa\u03b2 , and S\u03b1\u03b2 and S\u03b1\u03b2 . The remaining spin-1/2 pieces of Sa\u03b2 and Sa\u03b2 will become the two dilatini, and S\u03b1\u03b2 must become the Ramond-Ramond polyform field strength, written as a bispinor. This identifies all the physical fields from a superspace perspective."

The analysis will be extremely similar to the type I analysis [20], so we will not go into exhaustive detail.\nThe generalized fluxes FABC and FA are given by\nFABC = \u22123D[AVBM VMC] , FA = DA log \u03a6 + \u2202MVAM(\u2212)am+m . (2.21)\nThese are the only scalars (under diffeomorphisms) that can be built purely from the supervielbein involving a single derivative, and can be alternatively defined as the generalized Lie derivative of the supervielbein and superdilaton with respect to the supervielbein,\nLVAVB M = \u2212FABCVCM , LVA\u03a6 = FA\u03a6 .

(2.24c)\nWe give the various components of the flux tensors in table 1, organized by engineering dimension. We use hatted indices a\u0302 = (a, a) and \u03b1\u0302 = (\u03b1, \u03b1) to denote both left and right-handed vector and spinorial indices collectively. The basic definition of engineering dimension is to assign dimensions 1/2, 1, and 3/2 to D\u03b1\u0302, Da\u0302, and D\u03b1\u0302, respectively, and identically for \u2202\u00b5\u0302, \u2202m\u0302, and \u2202\u00b5\u0302. In this way, for example, Va\u0302m\u0302 has vanishing engineering dimension. This rule implies that a flux FABC has dimension \u22122+\u2206(A)+\u2206(B)+\u2206(C) where \u2206(A) denotes the dimension of DA, consistent with (2.23).5 Similarly, FA has dimension \u2206(A).\n5The factor of \u22122 arises because the flux FABC has dimension \u2206(A) + \u2206(B)\u2212\u2206(C) and then lowering the C index with \u03b7 exchanges \u2206(C) with 2\u2212\u2206(C).\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\ndimension fluxes\n\u221212 F\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 = T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 0 F\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302c\u0302 = T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302c\u0302 1 2 F\u03b1\u0302b\u0302c\u0302, F\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 , F\u03b1\u0302\n1 Fa\u0302b\u0302c\u0302, Fa\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 , Fa\u0302\n3 2 Fa\u0302b\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 , F\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 , F \u03b1\u0302\n2 Fa\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302\n5 2 F \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302\nTable 1. Generalized fluxes in type II super-DFT.\nThe fluxes themselves are not invariant under the local symmetry group HL \u00d7 HR. This group leaves the superdilaton invariant and acts on the supervielbein and fluxes as\n\u03b4VAM = \u03bbABVBM , \u03b4FABC = \u22123D[A\u03bbBC] + 3\u03bb[ADFD|BC] , \u03b4FA = \u2212DB\u03bbBA \u2212FB\u03bbBA . (2.25)\nIn order to build invariant torsions, we introduce the HL \u00d7 HR connection \u2126ABC = (\u2126ABC,\u2126ABC) with non-vanishing components\n\u2126A bc , \u2126A\u03b2\u03b3 = 1 4\u2126A bc (\u03b3 bc)\u03b2\u03b3 , \u2126A b\u03b3 , \u2126A \u03b2\u03b3 , \u2126A bc , \u2126A\u03b2 \u03b3 = 14\u2126A bc (\u03b3 bc)\u03b2 \u03b3 , \u2126A b \u03b3 , \u2126A \u03b2\u03b3 .

(2.28)\nThese are the covariantizations of the generalized fluxes (2.21) and can be defined as the covariant generalized Lie derivatives of the supervielbein and superdilaton, similarly to (2.22). Note that the dimension -1/2 and dimension 0 torsion tensors coincide with the fluxes, because the \u2126 connections are dimension +1/2 and higher. (We assign dimension to \u2126 so that the torsion and flux dimensions match.)\nA conventional HL \u00d7HR connection would transform as\n\u03b4\u2126MAB ?= L\u03be\u2126MAB + \u2202M\u03bbAB \u2212 \u2126MAC\u03bbCB + \u2126MBC\u03bbCA(\u2212)ab . (2.29)\nHowever, \u2126 is actually going to transform a bit differently and this is related to an enhancement of the local symmetry group. This comes about for two reasons: (i) certain components of \u2126 are absent in the torsion, implying an enhanced symmetry that shifts these components; and (ii) the supersymmetry constraints we wish to impose on the torsion require modifications of the \u2126 transformations. The upshot is that the local symmetry\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\ngroup is enhanced from HL \u00d7 HR to H\u0302L \u00d7 H\u0302R, but only the subgroup HL \u00d7 HR actually acts on the supervielbein. In our previous work on type I DFT [20], we defined the group H\u0302L by relating it to the so-called super-Maxwell\u221e algebra, using the framework of Pol\u00e1\u010dek and Siegel [23] where one doubles not just spacetime but also the local gauge symmetries (e.g. the Lorentz group). For a detailed discussion of this framework, see appendix B of [20]. In the interests of being pedagogical, we will first sketch here why such an extended group is necessary by reviewing how constraints, both physical and conventional, may be imposed on the torsion. Let us begin with an observation. All components of torsions and curvatures are covariant objects. However, the only covariant objects in type II double field theory, at least at the component level, are found at dimension 3/2 and dimension 2: these are the generalized gravitino curvature and the generalized Riemann tensor, and they are built out of derivatives of the physical fields (e.g. double vielbein, gravitini, dilatini, dilaton) that lie at lower dimensions. This means that in order to recover component double field theory, all components of torsions and curvatures through dimension 1 must vanish. Let us describe how this comes about by analyzing the constraints we can impose on the various torsion tensors. Using the various components of the spin connection \u2126, it is possible to impose constraints on the torsion tensor:\nfixing \u2126A bc =\u21d2 T\u03b1\u0302bc = Tabc = Tab\u03b3 = 0 , Ta = 0 , (2.30)\nfixing \u2126A b\u03b3 =\u21d2 T\u03b1\u0302b\u03b3 = 1 10X\u03b1\u0302,\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b2\u03b3 , Tab\u03b3 = 1 10Xa\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b2\u03b3 ,\nT \u03b1b\u03b3 = 1 10X \u03b1 \u03b2(\u03b3b)\u03b2\u03b3 , (2.31)\nfixing \u2126A\u03b2\u03b3 =\u21d2 T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = Ta\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = T \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = 0 (2.32)\nand similarly for their barred versions. Because \u2126Ab\u03b3 is \u03b3-traceless, only certain representations may be eliminated. The remaining torsion tensors may be organized by dimension. At dimensions -1/2 and dimension 0, no \u2126 connections appear and so the torsion tensors can be identified with the flux tensors:\nT\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 = 0 , T\u03b1\u03b2 c = k (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 , T\u03b1\u03b2 c = k (\u03b3\u0304c)\u03b1\u03b2 , T\u03b1\u03b2 c\u0302 = T\u03b1\u03b2 c = T\u03b1\u03b2 c = 0 . (2.33)\nThe constant k fixes the normalization of supersymmetry and is imaginary for a Majorana representation of the \u03b3-matrices. We leave it unspecified, because then we can more easily compare against results in other papers with different conventions. Finally, we fix T\u03b1\u0302 to vanish: this defines \u03a6 as the superdilaton uniquely. We summarize the various torsion tensors and constraints imposed in table 2. In using the \u2126 connections to eliminate various torsion tensors, it happens that the putative transformation rule (2.29) receives corrections. This happens for two reasons. First, the naive action of HL \u00d7HL would rotate T\u03b1\u0302b\u0302c\u0302 into T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302c\u0302, but this is contradicted by\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\ndimension conventional constraints physical constraints remaining torsions\n\u221212 \u2212 T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 = 0 \u2212\n0 \u2212 T\u03b1\u03b2 c = k (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 T\u03b1\u03b2 c = 0 \u2212\nT\u03b1\u03b2 c = k (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 T\u03b1\u03b2 c = 0\nT\u03b1\u03b2 c\u0302 = 0 1 2 T\u03b1\u0302bc = T\u03b1\u0302bc = 0 T\u03b1\u0302 = 0 T\u03b1\u0302bc, T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b3\u0302\n1 Ta\u0302b\u0302c\u0302 = Ta\u0302 = 0 \u2212 T\u03b1\u0302b \u03b3 , T\u03b1\u0302b\u03b3\nT\u03b1\u0302b\u03b3 = 110 X\u03b1\u0302,\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b2\u03b3 X\u03b1\u0302,\u03b2\u0302 T\u03b1\u0302b \u03b3 = 110 X\u03b1\u0302,\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b2\u03b3\n3 2 Tab \u03b3\u0302 = Tab \u03b3\u0302 = 0 \u2212 T \u03b1\u0302, T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3\nTab\u03b3 = 110 Xa\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b3\u03b2 Xa \u03b2 , Xa \u03b2 Tab \u03b3 = 110 Xa\u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b3\u03b2\nT\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = 0\n2 Ta\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = Ta\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 = 0 \u2212 X\u03b1\u03b2 , X\u03b1\u03b2 T \u03b1b\u03b3 = 110X \u03b1 \u03b2(\u03b3b)\u03b2\u03b3\nT \u03b1b \u03b3 = 110X \u03b1 \u03b2(\u03b3b) \u03b2\u03b3\n5 2 T \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 = 0 \u2212 \u2212\nTable 2.

(2.34b)\nThe second complication is that the \u2126 connections are not uniquely determined by fixing the torsions. This is well-known in the bosonic sector where there remains unfixed the irreducible hook representation of \u2126a bc; it turns out similar ambiguities appear in the other connections. It is natural to associate these ambiguities with additional local gauge symmetries, and indeed we must do so, because the algebra of the HL \u00d7HR transformations only closes on \u2126 subject to these new transformations [20]. These additional transformations involve parameters \u039ba,b\u03b2 and \u039b\u03b1,b\u03b2 (which are both \u03b3-traceless in b\u03b2) and \u039b\u03b1|\u03b2\u03b3 which is\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nsymmetric in \u03b2\u03b3 but with vanishing totally symmetric part:\n\u03b4\u039b\u2126M bc = VMa\u039ba|bc \u2212 2VM\u03b1\u039b[b,c]\u03b1 , (2.35a) \u03b4\u039b\u2126M b\u03b2 = 1 4VM \u03b1(\u03b3cd)\u03b1\u03b2\u039bb|cd + VMa\u039ba,b\u03b2 + VM\u03b1\u039b\u03b1b\u03b2 , (2.35b) \u03b4\u039b\u2126M\u03b2\u03b3 = VM\u03b1(\u03b3cd)\u03b1(\u03b2\u039bc,d\u03b3) + 2VMa\u039b(\u03b2a\u03b3) + VM\u03b1\u039b\u03b1|\u03b2\u03b3 .

            "text": "Before moving on, we want to address the significance of the remaining torsions \u2014 those in the final column in table 2. We have already alluded to the fact that the Bianchi identities will tell us that all these torsions vanish. Before getting to that, we should understand just what these objects correspond to at the component level. For the dimension 1/2 and dimension 1 torsions, they lead to potential contributions to the supersymmetry transformations of the vielbein (via T\u03b1\u0302bc), the gravitini (via T\u03b1\u0302b\n\u03b3 , T\u03b1\u0302b\u03b3 , and T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302\n\u03b3\u0302) and the dilatini (via X\u03b1\u0302,\u03b2\u0302). In principle, there could have been new covariant fields into which these fields transform; that there are not will turn out to be a consequence of the Bianchi identities at the superspace level. We emphasize that just because T and X will turn out to vanish does not mean that there are no supersymmetry transformations; rather, SUSY transformations will arise from the complicated orthosymplectic structure of the supervielbein. For dimension 3/2, one can interpret T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b3 similarly as a contribution of new covariant fields to the SUSY transformation of the Ramond-Ramond bispinor. The fact that there is no such new contribution is again a consequence of closure. More interesting are T \u03b1\u0302, Xa\u03b2 , Xa\u03b2 . From their dimension, they have an obvious interpretation as curvatures for the dilatini and gravitini. A linearized analysis \u2014 see section 4.2 of [20] for the type I discussion \u2014 would reveal that after solving the section condition in components, these tensors are given by\nT \u03b1 = (\u03b3a)\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202a\u03c1\u03b2 + \u2202b\u03a8b \u03b1 , Xb\u03b1 = \u2202b\u03c1\u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b3 a)\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202a\u03a8b \u03b2 (2.36)\nwhere \u03c1\u03b1 is the dilatino and \u03a8b \u03b1 is the gravitino. There are two important facts about these quantities. The first is that they are the equations of motion (in the linearized theory) for the dilatini and gravitini respectively; the fact that they vanish in superspace is therefore consistent. The second fact is that when the derivatives are covariantized with the double Lorentz connection, these are the only invariant curvature tensors that one can construct. For example, D[a\u03a8b]\n\u03b2 is Lorentz covariant but it involves the irreducible hook representation of the component Lorentz connection \u03c9a bc; this means it is not truly a covariant object. At dimension 2, the only quantities we encounter are X\u03b1\u03b2 and its barred version. (The generalized Ricci tensor and curvature scalar are found elsewhere in the generalized Riemann curvature.) A linearized analysis would reveal that X\u03b1\u03b2 is nothing but the Dirac operator on the Ramond-Ramond bispinor,\nX\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d (\u03b3b)\u03b2\u03b1\u2202bS\u03b1\u03b1 .

It was crucial here that the \u2126 connections be extended from the double Lorentz group to HL\u00d7HR so that conventional constraints could be imposed on those torsion components (see table 2) that have no component interpretation. For those not constrained in this way, there is physically meaningful data \u2014 a supersymmetry transformation or an equation of motion \u2014 associated with them. This is one reason to believe the results of [26, 27] should be understandable only after a significant gauge-fixing."

            "text": "Let\u2019s return to the discussion of the \u2126 connections. Already we have discussed how constraining the torsion tensors leads to an extension of the local symmetry group to H\u0302L\u00d7H\u0302R. We have elaborated in [20], for the case of type I DFT, how this group can be seen to come about by considering successive commutators of the corresponding generators, and gave a proposal for the connection to the super-Maxwell\u221e algebra. For type II DFT, the righthanded sector is just a copy of the left-handed sector, so we may bring over all of our results.\nWe summarize the generators of the left-handed sector in table 3. A simple way of understanding this set is that the tilde generators Q\u0303\u03b1, M\u0303ab and so on arise as a free Lie algebraic extension of the super-Poincar\u00e9 algebra of Q\u03b1 and Pa. In the case of a Yang-Mills superalgebra (a possible extension of super-Poincar\u00e9 that highlights the various possible structures), Q\u0303\u03b1 can be interpreted as the spinorial gaugino superfield, M\u0303ab is the bosonic\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nfield strength, and so on, with higher dimension generators corresponding to covariant derivatives of these objects and commutators thereof. Their Lorentz representations and engineering dimensions follow from the free Lie algebra construction. The dual generators lying at non-positive dimensions are implied by extending the free Lie algebra to a double superalgebra; this requires an invariant bilinear form \u03b7 pairing generators of dimension \u2206 and 2\u2212\u2206 (such as Pa with itself, Q\u03b1 with Q\u0303\u03b1, and so on). Further details may be found in [20]. Since we will only be working to dimension 2 in curvatures, only a few of these generators will be relevant for us. The generators corresponding to the \u03bbAB parameters we denote MAB. They are normalized to recover the OSp(9, 1|32) transformation\n1 2[\u03bb BCMCB, PA] = \u03bbABPB + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (2.38)\nwhere the elided terms correspond to deformations arising from the background kdependent SUSY algebra.

(2.41c)\nThe additional generators responsible for the shift symmetries of \u2126, are denoted Ka|bc, Ka,b\u03b2 , and K\u03b3,b\u03b2 . Some of their (anti)commutators are given in [20], but we do not reproduce them here. We adopt the Pol\u00e1\u010dek-Siegel framework for local gauge symmetries in double field theory [23] (see also appendix B of [20]). Superspace double field theory can be built on a rigid double super-Poincar\u00e9 algebra involving the generators Q\u03b1, Pa, and Q\u0303\u03b1 in the left-handed sector and Q\u03b1, Pa, and Q\u0303\u03b1 in the right. They obey the algebra\n{Q\u03b1, Q\u03b2} = \u2212k (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 Pc , [Q\u03b1, Pb] = \u2212k (\u03b3b)\u03b1\u03b3Q\u0303\u03b3 , (2.42)\nwith other (anti-)commutators vanishing. (The right-handed sector follows by adding bars to all indices.) These relations can be collectively written\n[PA, PB] = \u2212fABCPC (2.43)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nwhere the structure constants with a lowered index, fABC = fABD\u03b7DC , are (graded) totally antisymmetric. This rigid algebra is then augmented by additional generators corresponding to H\u0302L \u00d7 H\u0302R. The latter we denote Xa, where the graded index a has no relation to a vector index, and corresponds to an infinite set of generators lying in increasingly complicated Lorentz representations. The full extended algebra schematically reads\n[PA, PB] = \u2212fABCPC \u2212 X\u0303cfcAB , (2.44a) [Xa, PB] = \u2212faBCPC \u2212 faBcXc , (2.44b) [Xa, Xb] = \u2212fabcXc , (2.44c)\n[X\u0303a, X\u0303b] = \u2212X\u0303c fcab , (2.44d) [PA, X\u0303b] = \u2212X\u0303cfcAb , (2.44e) [Xa, X\u0303b] = \u2212X\u0303c fcab \u2212 fabCPC \u2212 fabcXc . (2.44f)\nThe generators Xa comprise Lorentz transformations Mab, the additional tangent space transformations acting on the supervielbein, which we denote M\u03b2a and M\u03b1\u03b2 , the new shift symmetries of \u2126 involving the \u039b parameters (whose generators we denote by K), and a higher tower of generators that arise when we attempt to build curvatures for \u2126. It is important that Xa furnish a closed algebra \u2014 this generates H\u0302L\u00d7 H\u0302R. The generators X\u0303a are additional dual generators that are paired with Xa via a non-degenerate \u03b7 metric, in the same manner that Pa is paired with itself and Q\u03b1 is paired with Q\u0303\u03b1.\nA more compact form of the above relations is\n[XA\u0302, XB\u0302] = \u2212fA\u0302B\u0302 C\u0302XC\u0302 (2.45)\nfor XA\u0302 = (Xa, PA, X\u0303 a) and where fA\u0302B\u0302C\u0302 = fA\u0302B\u0302 D\u0302\u03b7D\u0302C\u0302 is totally antisymmetric with \u03b7A\u0302B\u0302 given by\n\u03b7A\u0302B\u0302 =\n 0 0 \u03b4a b\n0 \u03b7AB 0 (\u22121)ab \u03b4ba 0 0  . (2.46) The requirement of a non-degenerate \u03b7 is one reason to introduce the dual generators X\u0303a. Now we want to gauge this formal algebra by introducing a supervielbein, connections, and so on. Following the discussion in appendix B of [20], we introduce the superdilaton \u03a6, the supervielbein VMA, connections HMa, and an additional graded antisymmetric superfield P ab. These transform under diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations (with parameter \u039ba) as6\n\u03b4\u03a6 = L\u03be\u03a6 , (2.47a) \u03b4VMA = L\u03beVMA + VMB\u039bcfcBA , (2.47b) \u03b4HM a = L\u03beHMa + \u2202M\u039ba +HMb\u039bcfcba + VMB\u039bcfcBa , (2.47c)\n\u03b4P ab = \u03beM\u2202MP ab \u2212 \u039bcfcab \u2212 2 \u039bcP d[afcdb] \u2212HM[a\u2202M\u039bb] \u2212 \u039bcHD[afDcb] .

One can check that the algebra of H\u0302L \u00d7 H\u0302R closes on these fields with\n[\u03b4\u039b1 , \u03b4\u039b2 ] = \u03b4\u039b12 for \u039b12 a = \u039b1b\u039b2cfcba (2.48)\nWith these ingredients, we can construct covariant derivatives \u2207A = VAM\u2202M \u2212HAbXb , \u2207\u0303a = HMa\u2202M + ( P ab \u2212 12H MaHM b ) Xb . (2.49)\nThese correspond to the curved extensions of PA and X\u0303a. Their algebra can again be written (2.45), but with some of the components of f now becoming structure functions. These consist of four curvatures TABC , RABc, RAbc, and Rabc, which appear in the curved algebra as\n[\u2207A,\u2207B] = \u2212TABC\u2207C \u2212RABcXc \u2212 \u2207\u0303c fcAB , (2.50a) [Xa,\u2207B] = \u2212faBC\u2207C \u2212 faBcXc , (2.50b) [Xa, Xb] = \u2212fabcXc , (2.50c)\n[\u2207\u0303a, \u2207\u0303b] = \u2212\u2207\u0303c fcab \u2212RabC\u2207C \u2212RabcXc , (2.50d) [\u2207A, \u2207\u0303b] = \u2212\u2207\u0303c fcAb \u2212RAbC \u2207C \u2212RAbcXc , (2.50e) [Xa, \u2207\u0303b] = \u2212\u2207\u0303c fcab \u2212 fabC\u2207C \u2212 fabcXc .

Here we will take a bit of a different approach and focus only on the first set (2.67a), which does not involve the superdilaton. The reason for this is that the double supergeometry emerging there will naturally correspond to generalized type II supergravity [30], where a dilaton is not presumed to exist. The analysis of (2.67a) is nearly identical to the type I discussion, so we will be relatively brief, proceeding by dimension.\nDimension 0.

Using \u2126[cba] and \u2126cba, we can set Ta\u0302b\u0302c\u0302 = 0 as a conventional constraint. Since we are not addressing the superdilaton curvatures yet, we do not set Ta\u0302 = 0, so \u2126bba remains unfixed.

Combining (2.70a) with (2.71a) implies that X\u03b1,\u03b2 is purely vectorial. We can set this to zero as a conventional constraint by redefining \u2126bba. In summary,\nTa\u0302b\u0302c\u0302 = 0 , Ta\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 = 0 (2.72)\nThese constraints are consistent with the vanishing of all lower dimensional torsion tensors except for T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302c\u0302.

Specifically,\nBab = \u2212R\u0302ab , Bab = 0 , B\u03b1 \u03b2 = \u221214R\u0302ab(\u03b3 ab)\u03b1\u03b2 , B\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 . (2.88)\nThese vanish simply by choosing R\u0302ab = R\u0302ab = 0.

In bosonic double field theory, the Ramond-Ramond sector is described either by an O(D,D) spinor [7, 8] or an O(D\u22121, 1)L\u00d7O(1, D\u22121)R bispinor [9, 10]. These two descriptions can be related using the spinorial vielbein [19]. Our goal in this section is to give the superspace lift of these relations. That is, we will describe how the Ramond-Ramond super p-forms of type II superspace fit into a spinor of OSp(D,D|2s), and we will give the prescription for identifying a spinorial supervielbein in this framework. Much of this material follows naturally from the bosonic case, so we will be brief where the analogies are clear. Key initial elements of this discussion were already given by Cederwall some time ago [28].\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7"

(3.8)\nBecause superspace forms are typically written in this fashion with other related changes (e.g. the de Rham differential acting from the right), it is natural to define an orthosymplectic spinor as a bra rather than a ket. This will lead us to transpose a number of equations relative to the bosonic case. While this mirroring of bosonic formulae is inconvenient at first glance, it has the practical effect of eliminating a number of minus signs that would otherwise occur. A key feature of orthosymplectic spinors is that because the Clifford algebra is infinite dimensional, spinors will necessarily also be infinite dimensional. This corresponds to the notion that a superform can be of arbitrary rank as there is no upper bound on the number of fermionic legs d\u03b8\u00b5\u0302. Following what we did with the Clifford algebra, it will be convenient to decompose an orthosymplectic spinor depending on how many \u03b2\u00b5\u0302 oscillators they involve. That is, we take\n\u3008C| = \u221e\u2211 p=0 \u3008C|p , (3.9)\nwhere \u3008C|p involves \u03b2\u00b5\u03021 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2\u00b5\u0302p .

For a generalized diffeomorphism, the parameter \u039b is given by \u039bMN = \u2202M\u03beN \u2212 \u2202N \u03beM(\u2212)nm. This suggests that we define the generalized diffeomorphism of C in analogy to the bosonic case as\n\u03b4\u3008C| = \u03beN\u2202N \u3008C|+ 1 2\u3008C|\u0393 MN\u2202N \u03beM + 1 2\u3008C|\u2202M\u03be M(\u2212)m\n= \u03beN\u2202N \u3008C|+ 1 2\u3008C|\u0393 M\u0393N\u2202N \u03beM .

A flat orthosymplectic spinor is then written, similar to (3.9), as\n\u3008/\u0302C| = \u2211 p \u30080|b\u03b1\u03021 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 b\u03b1\u0302p /\u0302C\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021 (3.16)\nwhere b\u03b1\u0302 = (b\u03b1, b\u03b1) are bosonic raising operators, acting to the left on a spinor vacuum state \u30080|, so that they obey\n[b\u03b1\u0302, b\u03b2\u0302 ] = \u03b4\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 , \u30080|b\u03b1\u0302 = 0 . (3.17)\nThe quantity /\u0302C\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021 is a bispinor carrying additional symmetric spinor indices; we can write it as\n/\u0302C\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021 = ( C\u0302\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021,\u03b1\u03b1 C\u0302\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021,\u03b1\u03b1 C\u0302\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021,\u03b1\u03b1 C\u0302\u03b1\u0302p\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03b1\u03021,\u03b1\u03b1 ) (3.18)\nwith \u03b1\u0302i including both barred and unbarred indices. The action of \u0393A on \u3008/\u0302C| is defined as\n\u3008/\u0302C| \u00b7 \u0393a = \u03b3a\u3008/\u0302C| , \u3008/\u0302C| \u00b7 \u0393a = \u03b3\u2217\u3008/\u0302C|\u03b3\u0304a , \u3008/\u0302C| \u00b7 \u0393\u03b1\u0302 = \u221a 2 \u03b3\u2217\u3008/\u0302C|\u03b3\u0304\u2217 b\u03b1\u0302 , \u3008/\u0302C| \u00b7 \u0393\u03b1\u0302 = \u221a 2 \u03b3\u2217\u3008/\u0302C|\u03b3\u0304\u2217 b\u03b1\u0302 . (3.19)\nThe various factors of \u03b3\u2217 and \u03b3\u0304\u2217 are necessary to reproduce the flat Clifford algebra. The \u00b7 action above is to the left on any bispinor-valued Fock space and not just \u3008/\u0302C| itself, so\n7Because the action of \u0393a\u0302 is defined to the left on any bispinor, we have e.g. | /V \u3009 \u00b7\u0393a\u0393b = (\u03b3a| /V \u3009) \u00b7\u0393b = \u03b3b\u03b3a| /V \u3009, and so the order of the left-handed gamma matrices gets reversed. This is in contrast to the discussion in [19], where the Fock space structure was transposed and so the action of right-handed gamma matrices was reversed.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nfor example, \u3008/\u0302C| \u00b7 \u0393a\u0393b = ( \u03b3a\u3008/\u0302C| ) \u00b7 \u0393b = \u03b3b\u03b3a\u3008/\u0302C|, leading to a reversal of ordering on the left-handed spinor sector. We introduce the bispinorial operator /\u0302V that converts to the spinor Fock space, so that\n\u3008/\u0302C| := \u03a6\u22121/2 \u3008C| /\u0302V . (3.20)\nThe action of the \u0393M matrices on /\u0302V is defined as\n\u0393M /\u0302V = /\u0302V \u00b7 \u0393A VAM (3.21)\nwhere \u0393A acts to the left on /\u0302V just as on \u3008/\u0302C| in (3.19). The specific dictionary between the curved and flat Fock vacuum states follows when taking /\u0302V to be that associated with the identity supervielbein; for shorthand, we denote this as /\u03021. Then we have\n\u30080|/\u03021 = 1\u2297 \u30080| = 1 25/2 ( \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b1\u30080| 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b1\u30080| ) . (3.22)"

            "text": "Now suppose that \u3008C| describes the complex of Ramond-Ramond p-forms. In addition to diffeomorphisms (3.10), it transforms under abelian gauge transformations as\n\u03b4\u3008C| = \u3008\u03bb| \u2190 /\u2202= 1\u221a\n2 \u3008\u03bb|\u0393M\n\u2190 \u2202M (3.23)\nso that the field strength \u3008F| = \u3008C| \u2190 /\u2202 is invariant. As is typical in superspace formulations, we impose constraints on the covariant field strengths \u2014 that is, constraints on the flat components of the field strength tensor flattened with the supervielbein, e.g. FA1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ap . For the Ramond-Ramond sector, the analogous constraints must then be imposed on the flattened bispinor\n\u3008 /\u0302F| := \u03a6\u22121/2\u3008F| /\u0302V . (3.24)\nA remarkable simplification occurs here. In type II supergravities, there are only three nonzero components of FA1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Ap : these are F\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap\u22122 (which is constant and given by \u03b3-matrices), F\u03b1\u0302 a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap\u22121 (which is given by the dilatino), and Fa1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap (which is the covariant field strength). We have already claimed that the covariant field strengths and the dilatino will be encoded in the supervielbein; since these will have non-tensorial transformations under superdiffeomorphisms, we cannot use them to build \u3008 /\u0302F|. This suggests that the only natural choice for \u3008 /\u0302F| is a constant! Structurally, there is only one way to do this. Because the fermionic oscillators b\u03b1\u0302 carry the same type of index as those on the bispinor, it is possible to write down one constant bispinor which involves no dynamical information aside from the structure of the flat fermionic Fock space:\n\u3008 /\u0302F| = \u22124k (\n0 0 \u30080|b\u03b1b\u03b1 0\n) . (3.25)\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nWe choose the normalization to involve the constant k, which is the same that appears in the torsion tensor constraint (2.33); this will lead to standard normalization conventions for the Ramond-Ramond sector in type II supergravity. This coincides with the expansion (3.18) if we identify the sole non-vanishing component as\nF\u0302\u03b12\u03b11,\u03b1\u03b1 = \u22124k \u03b4\u03b12\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b11\u03b1 . (3.26)\nThis is a rather simple expression, and we should perform a few sanity checks. First, the field strength must be closed. In covariant notation, this condition reads\n0 = 1\u221a 2 \u3008 /\u0302F|\n( \u0393A \u2190 \u2207A +\n1 12\u0393 ABCTCBA + 1 2\u0393 ATA\n) . (3.27)\nThe only non-vanishing torsion is T\u03b3\u0302\u03b2\u0302a\u0302, so only the second term contributes:\n0 = \u03b3c\u3008 /\u0302F|b\u03b1b\u03b2(\u03b3c)\u03b2\u03b1 + \u03b3\u2217\u3008 /\u0302F|\u03b3\u0304cb\u03b1b\u03b2(\u03b3\u0304c)\u03b2\u03b1 . (3.28)\nThe first term is proportional to( 0 (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2\n(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 0\n) \u00d7 (\n0 0 \u30080|b\u03b2b\u03b1 0\n) \u00d7 b\u03b3b\u03b4(\u03b3c)\u03b3\u03b4 = ( \u30080|(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2b\u03b2b\u03b3b\u03b4(\u03b3c)\u03b3\u03b4b\u03b1 0\n0 0\n) (3.29)\nbut this vanishes using the fundamental 10D gamma matrix identity (\u03b3c)\u03b1(\u03b2(\u03b3c)\u03b3\u03b4) = 0. A similar cancellation occurs for the second term. This identifies \u3008 /\u0302F| as a preferred covariantly closed and constant orthosymplectic spinor. As a second check, we can verify that \u3008 /\u0302F| is Lorentz covariant. This is more or less obvious when we interpret it as (3.26), but it is useful to understand how this works in ket language. An infinitesimal left-handed Lorentz transformation acts as\n\u03b4\u03bb\u3008 /\u0302F|= 1 2\u3008 /\u0302F| (1 2\u0393 ab \u2212 14\u0393\u03b2\u0393 \u03b3(\u03b3ab)\u03b3\u03b2 ) \u03bbba = 1 4\u03bbab ( \u03b3ab\u3008 /\u0302F|+ \u3008 /\u0302F|b\u03b2b\u03b3(\u03b3ab)\u03b3\u03b2 ) = 0 . (3.30)\nThe term in parentheses is the embedding of the SO(9, 1) generatorMab into the orthosymplectic group: it consists of the piece that rotates vectors and the piece rotating spinors. Together these cancel out when the explicit form of \u3008 /\u0302F| is used. The same occurs for the right-handed sector. In fact, \u3008 /\u0302F| can be seen to be invariant under the full HL\u00d7HR group. We leave this as an instructive exercise. To confirm this result, we will verify in due course that it correctly reproduces the supersymmetry transformation of component Ramond-Ramond bispinor given in [10]. We will also show that it leads to the correct Ramond-Ramond polyform in conventional type II superspace."

First, as with any on-shell component theory, this can be tricky because on-shell supersymmetry necessarily implies equations of motion. Second, we have not yet discovered a generic schema for constructing invariant actions in OSp(D,D|2s) superspace; this is in contrast to GL(D|s) superspace where invariant actions are associated with closed super D-forms [31\u201334]. Nevertheless, one could still derive the equations of motion from superspace; for the sake of brevity, we will not exhaustively analyze these here, as this would mostly mirror the type I analysis [20], and would necessarily lead to the results in [10] (since those equations of motion are implied by closure of the algebra)."

            "text": "In order to derive the physical component fields, we must first arrange the supervielbein in a specific way. The generators of OSp(10, 10|64) can be decomposed with respect to O(10, 10)\u00d7 Sp(64,R) and assigned levels as\nT \u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 level -2 , T \u00b5\u0302n\u0302\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 level -1 , T m\u0302n\u0302 , T\u00b5\u0302 \u03bd\u0302\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nlevel 0 , T\u00b5\u0302n\u0302\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 level +1 , T\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 level +2 . (4.1)\nThe level corresponds to the difference between the number of lowered and raised fermionic indices. Then the DFT supervielbein VMA can be arranged in factors of increasing levels, i.e.\nV = V\u22122V\u22121V0V+1V+2 . (4.2)\nOne consequence is that the fields and generators assigned to V+1 and V+2 will be more naturally written with tangent space indices. We enumerate the fields in table 4. This arrangement is rather different from the superspace decomposition given in (2.9). That parametrization (and its generalization in section 5) is more useful to recover type II superspace after solving the section condition, while the one here is useful for component DFT analysis. We will spell this connection out more clearly in section 5.7. Let\u2019s briefly explain the field content in table 4. The component fields lie in the first three lines. The bosonic double vielbein is Vm\u0302a\u0302. The fermionic fields \u03a8a\u0302\u03b2\u0302 consist of the gravitini \u03a8a\u03b2 and \u03a8a\u03b2 and the dilatini \u03c1\u03b1\u0302, which we define as\n\u03c1\u03b1 := \u03a8a\u03b2(\u03b3a)\u03b2\u03b1 , \u03c1\u03b1 := \u03a8a\u03b2(\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b2\u03b1 . (4.3)\nThe spin-3/2 pieces of \u03a8a\u03b2 and \u03a8a\u03b2 are pure gauge artifacts, as are S\u03b1\u03b2 and S\u03b1\u03b2 . S\u03b1\u03b2 encodes the covariantized Ramond-Ramond field strengths. The remaining fields turn out to be gauge artifacts of a different type: the lowest components of their \u03b8 expansions can be removed by \u03b8-dependent diffeomorphisms. These are related (at leading order) to corresponding fields in conventional superspace. For example, \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\n\u03b1\u0302 corresponds to the supervielbein component E\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302. The two pieces of \u039e\u00b5\u0302m\u0302 = (\u039e\u00b5\u0302m,\u039e\u00b5\u0302m) correspond respectively to E\u00b5\u0302a and B\u00b5\u0302n in conventional superspace. Finally, B\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 corresponds to the fermionic legs of the super 2-form BMN .\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nH E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nLet\u2019s work out the explicit expressions for the supervielbein. The fields at nonzero levels are normalized so that they fill out a graded symmetric element AMN of OSp(10, 10|64),\nAMN =  0 \u039em\u0302\u03bd\u0302 \u03a8a\u0302 \u03b2\u0302\n\u2212\u039en\u0302\u00b5\u0302 B\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 0 \u2212\u03a8b\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 0 S \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302  . (4.4) This notation is somewhat sloppy, as we are using flat indices for positive elements and curved indices for negative ones, but we trust this will not be confusing. Exponentiating the above generators using V = exp(AMN ) for each level gives\nV+2 = 1 0 00 1 0 0 S 1  , V\u22122 = 1 0 00 1 \u2212B 0 0 1  , B = B\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 , S = S \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 ,\nV+1 =  1 \u03a8 00 1 0 \u2212\u03a8T \u221212\u03a8 T\u03a8 1  , \u03a8 = \u03a8a\u0302\u03b2\u0302 , \u03a8T = (\u03a8T )\u03b1\u0302b\u0302 = \u03a8b\u0302\u03b1\u0302 , ,\nV\u22121 =  1 0 \u2212\u039e\u2212\u039eT 1 12\u039eT\u039e 0 0 1  , \u039e = \u039em\u0302\u03bd\u0302 , \u039eT = (\u039eT )\u00b5\u0302n\u0302 = \u039en\u0302\u00b5\u0302 , (4.5) At level 0, there are two distinct commuting pieces, which we denote\nV0 = Vm\u0302 a\u0302 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n , V\u03c6 = 1 0 00 \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302 0\n0 0 \u03c6\u03b1\u0302\u00b5\u0302  . (4.6) Vm\u0302\na\u0302 is the component DFT vielbein and we presume \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302 to be invertible with inverse \u03c6\u03b1\u0302\u00b5\u0302. Then a generic orthosymplectic element can be decomposed as\nV = V\u22122V\u22121V\u03c6\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 V\u039e \u00d7V0 \u00d7 V+1V+2\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 V\u03a8 = V\u039e \u00d7 V0 \u00d7 V\u03a8 (4.7)\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nWe emphasize that V0 contains the bosonic double vielbein, V\u03a8 involves the gravitini, dilatini, and Ramond-Ramond bispinor, and V\u039e involves fields with no component analogues since their \u03b8 = 0 parts can be eliminated. Note that V0 denotes a generic element of O(D,D) \u2282 OSp(D,D|2s) while V\u22122V\u03c6V+2 is a (nearly) generic element of Sp(2s,R) \u2282 OSp(D,D|2s). The organization of elements ensures that all flat indices above transform straightforwardly under the double Lorentz group. Meanwhile, the higher \u03bb transformations are entirely soaked up in V\u03a8 = V+1V+2. The fields there transform as\n\u03b4\u03a8a\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bba\u03b2 , \u03b4\u03a8a\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bba\u03b2 , (4.8)\n\u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03a8c(\u03b1\u03bbc\u03b2) , \u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03a8c(\u03b1\u03bbc\u03b2) , (4.9) \u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = 12\u03a8 c\u03b2\u03bbc \u03b1 + 12\u03a8 c\u03b1\u03bbc \u03b2 , (4.10)\nwith all other fields invariant. Note that we can define a shifted version of S\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nS\u030a\u03b1\u03b2 := S\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 12\u03a8 c\u03b1\u03a8c\u03b2 + 1 2\u03a8 c\u03b1\u03a8c\u03b2 (4.11)\nto eliminate its higher \u03bb transformation entirely.

(4.12)\nWe will actually avoid imposing this gauge, so that we can track how gauge invariance emerges. In the decomposition (4.7), let us split off the V\u03a8 part and denote V\u030a = V\u039eV0.

As we will solve the fermionic part of the section condition by taking \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302 = 0, it follows that\nD\u030aA := V\u030aAM\u2202M =  Va\u0302 m\u0302\u2202m\u0302\nV\u030a\u03b1\u0302m\u0302\u2202m\u0302 + \u03c6\u03b1\u0302\u00b5\u0302\u2202\u00b5\u0302 0\n \u2261 D\u030aa\u0302D\u030a\u03b1\u0302\n0  .

The additional double fermionic derivative is D\u03b1\u0302: its explicit form will be useful in subsequent computations. The key property of (4.16) is that the pieces of V\u039e appear only implicitly via D\u03b1\u0302. These simple expressions crucially follow only upon imposing \u2202\u00b5\u0302 = 0, which we will presume henceforth in this section."

            "text": "There are three types of diffeomorphisms to consider: bosonic generalized diffeomorphisms of component double field theory and the fermionic and dual fermionic diffeomorphisms. We treat the fermionic diffeomorphisms as covariantized diffeomorphisms and keep the bosonic and dual fermionic diffeomorphisms uncovariantized. That means we parametrize the latter as standard diffeomorphisms with\n\u03beM = (\u03bem\u0302, 0,\u2212\u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302) (4.17)\nand encode the former as\n\u03beA = (0, \u03b1\u0302, 0) . (4.18)\nThe parameter \u03bem\u0302 describes double diffeomorphisms in the component theory, \u03b1\u0302 describes supersymmetry, and \u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302 is a residual dual fermionic symmetry that plays no role for the physical fields. Let\u2019s first address the transformations (4.17), as these are quite simple to understand. Denoting the diffeomorphism as\n\u03b4VMA = \u03beN\u2202NVMA +KMNVNA , KMN = \u2202M\u03beN \u2212 \u2202N \u03beM(\u2212)nm , (4.19)\nwe observe that only non-positive levels contribute to K on account of \u2202\u00b5\u0302 = 0, and it follows that\n\u03b4V\u039e = \u03bem\u0302\u2202m\u0302V\u039e + (K\u22122 +K\u22121)V\u039e + [K0,V\u039e] , \u03b4V0 = \u03bem\u0302\u2202m\u0302V0 +K0V0 , \u03b4V\u03a8 = \u03bem\u0302\u2202m\u0302V\u03a8 . (4.20)\nIt is useful here that the level zero element K0 only involves \u2202m\u0302\u03ben\u0302 and not \u2202\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u03bd\u0302 or \u2202\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u03bd\u0302 , as this simplifies the transformation of V\u039e. Because the K0 piece is just the bosonic O(10, 10) element, V0 transforms as a DFT vielbein should, while the gravitino, dilatino, and RR bispinor are scalar fields. The negative level transformations are completely soaked up by the fields in V\u039e, which transform as\n\u03b4\u039em\u0302\u03bd\u0302 = \u03ben\u0302\u2202n\u0302\u039em\u0302\u03bd\u0302 + \u2202m\u0302\u03be\u0303\u03bd\u0302 \u2212 \u2202\u03bd\u03bem\u0302 + (\u2202m\u0302\u03ben\u0302 \u2212 \u2202n\u0302\u03bem\u0302)\u039en\u0302\u03bd\u0302 , \u03b4B\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 = \u03ben\u0302\u2202n\u0302B\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 + \u2202\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u0303\u03bd\u0302 + \u2202\u03bd\u0302 \u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302 + \u039em\u0302(\u00b5\u0302(\u2202m\u0302\u03be\u0303\u03bd\u0302) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd\u0302)\u03bem\u0302) .

For example, if we have set S\u03b1\u03b2 to zero, it remains so. This means component diffeomorphisms match superspace ones, with no compensating transformations needed to preserve the gauges (4.12). This will not be the case for supersymmetry transformations."

            "text": "We have identified the vielbein, gravitini, and dilatini as components of the supervielbein. We still need to identify the dilaton and the Ramond-Ramond sector and verify that they transform sensibly under standard diffeomorphisms (4.17).\nThe dilaton. Recall the superdilaton \u03a6 transforms under diffeomorphisms as\n\u03b4 log \u03a6 = \u03bem\u0302\u2202m\u0302 log \u03a6 + \u2202m\u0302\u03bem\u0302 \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u00b5\u0302 + \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302 (4.22)\nfor a completely generic \u03beM. At the component level, the last term can be dropped because we take \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302 = 0, but the second term remains problematic as it will obstruct the construction of a sensible supersymmetry transformation. This suggests that we define the component dilaton as\ne\u22122d := \u03a6\u00d7 det\u03c6\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302 =\u21d2 e2d\u03b4e\u22122d = \u2202m\u0302\u03bem\u0302 + 2 \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302\u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302 . (4.23)\nNow the second term drops out when \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302 = 0 and the component dilaton transforms as a scalar field.8\nThe Ramond-Ramond sector. For the Ramond-Ramond sector, we proceed analogously to how superspace p-forms reduce to component p-forms. Recall for these, we have the notion of a double bar projection, taking both \u03b8\u00b5 = 0 and d\u03b8\u00b5 = 0. Thus we have\nC = \u2211 p 1 p!dz M1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 dzMpCMp\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7M1(x, \u03b8) =\u21d2 C = C|| = \u2211 p 1 p!dx m1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 dxmpCmp\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m1(x) ,\n(4.24)\nwhere Cmp\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m1(x) = Cmp\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m1(x, 0). For the case of an orthosymplectic spinor, the analogous operation is to project to \u03b2\u00b5\u0302 = 0. That is, we define\n\u3008C| := \u3008C| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u3008C|\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b8\u00b5\u0302=\u03b2\u00b5\u0302=0 (4.25)\nThe spinor \u3008C(x)| transforms precisely as a component O(D,D) spinor when \u03beM is given by (4.17) and we set \u2202\u0303\u00b5\u0302 = 0:\n\u03b4\u3008C| = \u03ben\u0302\u2202n\u0302\u3008C|+ 1 2\u3008C|\u0393 m\u0302\u0393N\u2202N \u03bem\u0302 + 1 2\u3008C|\u0393 \u00b5\u0302\u0393N\u2202N \u03be\u0303\u00b5\u0302 proj.=\u21d2\n\u03b4\u3008C| = \u03ben\u0302\u2202n\u0302\u3008C|+ 1 2\u3008C|\u0393 m\u0302\u0393n\u0302\u2202n\u0302\u03bem\u0302 . (4.26)\n8Another way of arriving at this same conclusion is to recall that the component DFT dilaton is related to the supergravity dilaton by a factor of e = det ema, that is, e\u22122d = e e\u22122\u03d5. The superdilaton in Siegel\u2019s superspace DFT is similarly related to the conventional (non-density) superspace dilaton by a factor of E = sdetEMA, i.e. \u03a6 = E e\u22122\u03d5. In conventional superspace, the component and superspace dilatons coincide (hence both are \u03d5 above). This implies that e\u22122d = \u03a6\u00d7 e/E = \u03a6\u00d7 det\u03c6\u00b5\u03b1.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nSpin connection. In analogy to (4.14), we define the component spin connection\n\u03c9a\u0302 b\u0302c\u0302 := (V\u03a8)a\u0302 D\u2126D b\u0302c\u0302 = \u2126a\u0302 b\u0302c\u0302 + \u03a8a\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\u2126\u03b1\u0302 b\u0302c\u0302 (4.27)\nThe motivation for this is two-fold: first, it lets us define the component covariant derivative as\nD\u030aa\u0302 := (V\u03a8)a\u0302BDB = Da\u0302 + \u03a8a\u0302\u03b2\u0302D\u03b2\u0302 = D\u030aa\u0302 \u2212 1 2\u03c9a\u0302 b\u0302c\u0302Mc\u0302b\u0302 . (4.28)\nSecond, it gives a very simple prescription for translating torsion constraints in superspace to torsion constraints in components. As shown in [20], the above definition of the spin connection implies that the component torsions are given by\nTc\u0302b\u0302a\u0302 = (V\u03a8)a\u0302 A(V\u03a8)b\u0302 B(V\u03a8)c\u0302CTCBA . (4.29)\nA similar calculation shows that the component dilaton torsion is\nTa\u0302 = Ta\u0302 + \u03a8a\u0302\u03b1\u0302(T\u03b1\u0302 + T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b2\u0302) + \u03a8b\u0302\u03b2\u0302T\u03b2\u0302b\u0302a\u0302 \u2212\u03a8a\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\u03a8b\u0302\u03b2\u0302T\u03b2\u0302\u03b1\u0302b\u0302 + S \u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 ( T\u03b3\u0302\u03b2\u0302a\u0302 + \u03a8a\u0302 \u03b1T\u03b3\u0302\u03b2\u0302a\u0302 ) . (4.30)\nUsing the superspace constraints on the torsion tensors, we conclude that\nTabc = 3k\u03a8[a\u03b1(\u03b3b)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8c]\u03b2 , (4.31a)\nTabc = 2k\u03a8a\u03b1(\u03b3[b)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8c]\u03b2 \u2212 k\u03a8b\u03b1(\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8c \u03b2 , (4.31b)\nTa = \u2212k\u03a8a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \u2212 k\u03a8a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 + k(\u03b3a)\u03b2\u03b3S\u03b2\u03b3 , (4.31c)\nand similarly for their barred versions. We could further impose the gauge conditions (4.12), but it will be enlightening to avoid that here. The above conditions imply that \u03c9abc and \u03c9abc receive additional contributions \u2206\u03c9 relative to the expressions \u03c9(V ) that follow from the bosonic theory:\n\u2206\u03c9[abc] = k \u03a8\u0304[a\u03b3b\u03a8c] , (4.32a) \u2206\u03c9bba = \u2212k \u03a8\u0304a\u03c1\u2212 k \u03a8\u0304\u2032a\u03c1\u2032 + k(\u03b3a)\u03b2\u03b3S\u03b2\u03b3 , (4.32b) \u2206\u03c9abc = 2k \u03a8\u0304a\u03b3[b\u03a8c] \u2212 k\u03a8\u0304\u2032b\u03b3\u0304a\u03a8\u2032c . (4.32c)\nThis means that this spin connection is not invariant under the higher \u03bb transformations. This had to be the case from its definition (4.27) and the transformations (2.34a) of \u2126Mbc, which imply that\n\u03b4\u03c9abc = \u22122k \u03a8\u0304a\u03b3[b\u03bbc] \u2212 2k 9 \u03b7a[b(\u03b3c])\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb \u03b1\u03b2 + \u039ba|bc , (4.33)\nconsistent with the contributions \u2206\u03c9.\nThe covariant Ramond-Ramond field strength. To uncover the relation between the component Ramond-Ramond bispinor field strength /\u0302F and the bispinor component S\u030a\u03b1\u03b2 of the supervielbein, we follow again the conventional supergravity dictionary by projecting to \u03b2\u00b5\u0302 = 0. That is, we identify\n\u3008F | := \u3008F| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u3008 /\u0302F| /\u0302V\u22121\u03a61/2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 .

(4.42)\nAs we are restricting our choice of \u03beA, we should be careful about expressions like \u2207A\u03beB = DA\u03be\nB\u2212\u2126ABC\u03beC , which might lead to an unexpected contribution when the \u2126 connection is not purely Lorentz. Luckily, for \u03beA = (0, \u03b1\u0302, 0), the only contribution is the Lorentz piece \u2126A\u03b2\u03b3 \u03b3 = 14(\u03b3\nbc)\u03b3\u03b2\u2126A bc \u03b3 . To emphasize this, we replace \u2207 with D where D carries only the double Lorentz connection. For the torsion term, only T\u03b3\u0302\u03b2\u0302a\u0302 is non-vanishing. Thus the only nonzero elements of KAB are\nK\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = 2D(\u03b1\u0302 \u03b2\u0302) , Ka\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = Da\u0302 \u03b2\u0302 , K\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = D\u03b1\u0302 \u03b2\u0302 , K\u03b1\u0302b\u0302 = k(\u03b3 b\u0302)\u03b1\u0302\u03b3\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 ,\nK\u03b1\u0302b\u0302 = \u2212Db\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 , K\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = \u2212D\u03b2\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 , Ka\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = k(\u03b3a\u0302)\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 \u03b3\u0302 , (4.43)\ncorresponding to levels +2, +1, 0, and \u22121. The possible compensating \u03bb transformations lie at levels +2, +1 and 0.

(4.46)\nThese are rather complicated expressions, but only some of them are relevant. For example, the full expressions for (J\u030a2)\u03b1\u03b2 and (J\u030a2)\u03b1\u03b2 tell us about \u03b4S \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 but S\u03b1\u03b2 and S\u03b1\u03b2 are pure gauge degrees of freedom, so are not really relevant; in effect, these transformations would just identify what \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 would need to be in order to maintain a specific gauge choice. And while S\u03b1\u03b2 contains the Ramond-Ramond field strength, we will actually derive the transformation of the potential directly. The transformation of \u03c6\u00b5\u03b1 isn\u2019t really relevant either; it involves a leading term \u2202\u00b5\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 implying that at lowest order in \u03b8 one is free to fix \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\n\u03b1\u0302 = \u03b4\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302. That leaves the transformations of the bosonic vielbein and the gravitini and dilatini.\nWe discuss these below.\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nDFT vielbein.

(4.47)\nThe expression for Jab is exactly as expected from [10]. The nonzero expressions for Jab and Jab indicate that in order to make contact with supersymmetric type II DFT [10] (where they are taken to vanish) one should choose \u03bb appropriately. This is rather natural to do since these expressions involve \u03a8b\u03b1 and \u03a8b\n\u03b1, which transform under the higher \u03bb-transformations. Imposing \u03bbab and \u03bbab to kill these, we find\n\u03b4Vm\u0302 a = k Vm\u0302b ( \u03b1(\u03b3\u0304b)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8 a\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8b \u03b2 ) , (4.48a)\n\u03b4Vm\u0302 a = k Vm\u0302b ( \u03b1(\u03b3b)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8a\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1(\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2\u03a8b \u03b2 ) . (4.48b)\nGravitini and dilatini. The gravitini and dilatini transformations are a good bit more complicated.

Explicitly, this reads\n\u03b4\u03beC = L\u03beC = \u03beydC + d(\u03beyC) =\u21d2 \u03b4cov\u03be C = \u03beydC = \u03beyF . (4.59)\nThis generalizes easily for an orthosymplectic spinor. The transformation (3.10) can be rewritten\n\u03b4\u03be\u3008C| = 1 2 ( \u3008C|\u0393N \u2190 \u2202N ) \u0393M\u03beM + 1 2 ( \u3008C|\u0393M\u03beM ) \u0393N \u2190 \u2202N= \u3008F|/\u03be + \u3008\u03bb| \u2190 /\u2202 (4.60)\nwhere \u3008\u03bb| = \u3008C|/\u03be = 1\u221a2\u3008C|\u0393 M\u03beM is a special parameter for an abelian transformation. This leads to the definition of a covariant diffeomorphism,\n\u03b4cov\u03be \u3008C| = \u3008F|/\u03be = 1\u221a 2 \u3008F|\u0393M\u03beM . (4.61)\nTo proceed to components, it helps to again recall what we do in conventional superspace. Starting with a 1-form, for example, we write\n\u03b4cov\u03be CM = \u03beNFNM = EMB\u03beAFAB (4.62)\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nkeeping CM with a curved index but rewriting \u03be and F with flat indices. Subsequently projecting to d\u03b8 = 0 gives\n\u03b4cov\u03be Cm = EmB \u03b1F\u03b1B|\u03b8=0 (4.63)\nThe steps for an orthosymplectic spinor are similar. The analogous procedure of (4.62) is to flatten \u3008F|, writing \u3008F| = \u3008 /\u0302F| /\u0302V\u22121 \u03a61/2. This leads to\n\u03b4cov\u03be \u3008C| = 1\u221a 2 \u3008 /\u0302F| /\u0302V\u22121\u0393M\u03beM\u03a61/2 = 1\u221a 2 \u3008 /\u0302F|\u0393\u03b1\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 /\u0302V\u22121\u03a61/2 (4.64)\nUsing a very similar computation as that leading to (4.37), we find\ned \u00d7 \u3008\u03b4cov\u03be C| /V \u3009 = 1\u221a 2 \u3008 /\u0302F|\u0393\u03b1\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 /\u0302V\u22121\u03a8 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (4.65) The left-hand side can be rewritten as the variation of /\u0302C = ed\u3008C| /V \u3009:\ned \u00d7 \u3008\u03b4cov\u03be C| /V \u3009 = \u03b4 /\u0302C \u2212 /\u0302C\u03b4d+ 1 4 /\u0302C \u00b7 \u0393a\u0302b\u0302Jb\u0302a\u0302 (4.66)\nwhere Jb\u0302a\u0302 = Vb\u0302 m\u0302\u03b4Vm\u0302a\u0302. Let\u2019s evaluate the right-hand side in two steps. First,\n1\u221a 2 \u3008 /\u0302F|\u0393\u03b1\u0302 \u03b1\u0302 = \u22124k  0 0 \u30080|( \u03b1b\u03b1 \u2212 b\u03b1 \u03b1) 0  . (4.67) Next, we evaluate V\u22121\u03a8 . Only the level one terms contribute because (4.67) involves only a single raising operator. This means effectively we have V\u22121\u03a8 = 1 + 1 2\u0393\u03b2\u0302\u0393\na\u0302\u03a8a\u0302\u03b2\u0302 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

Both of these features are natural when we descend from double field theory. The descent from super-DFT to conventional superspace is a somewhat involved procedure, with the primary technical hurdle being the parametrization of the supervielbein in a convenient way. The main result in this section will be to recover a type II superspace that is fully democratic, meaning not only that it treats Ramond-Ramond potentials and their duals simultaneously (i.e. democratic in the sense of [44]), but also IIA and IIB (as well as IIA\u2217 and IIB\u2217) rather in parallel.

            "text": "As a first step to understanding how type II superspace emerges, we will review how conventional gravity emerges from the bosonic double vielbein. In the chiral tangent frame basis, the double vielbein may always be decomposed as (see e.g. [9, 10])\nVm\u0302 a\u0302 = 1\u221a\n2\n( \u03b4m\nn bmn 0 \u03b4mn\n) \u00d7 ( en a e\u0304n a\n\u03b7abeb n \u03b7abe\u0304b n\n) , (5.1a)\nVa\u0302 m\u0302 = 1\u221a\n2\n( ea n \u03b7aben b\ne\u0304a n \u03b7abe\u0304n\nb\n) \u00d7 ( \u03b4n m \u2212bnm\n0 \u03b4nm\n) . (5.1b)\nThe two vielbeins ema and e\u0304ma rotate separately under the two Lorentz groups, while the Kalb-Ramond two-form bmn is invariant. This is a rather generic decomposition, and it follows simply by assuming that Vam = 1\u221a2ea m and Vam = 1\u221a2 e\u0304a m are both invertible matrices. (This is essentially equivalent to assuming that the component Hm\u0302n\u0302 of the generalized metric is invertible.) The requirement that this be an O(10, 10) element amounts to demanding that ema and e\u0304ma both give the same metric,\ngmn = emaenb\u03b7ab = \u2212e\u0304mae\u0304nb\u03b7ab . (5.2)\nEquivalently, (e\u22121e\u0304)ab is an element of O(1, 9). Using this observation, we may further separate Vm\u0302a\u0302 into three factors, schematically, V = Vb \u00d7 Ve \u00d7 V\u039b:\nVm\u0302 a\u0302 = 1\u221a\n2\n( \u03b4m\nn bmn 0 \u03b4mn\n) \u00d7 ( en b en b\n\u03b7abeb n \u2212\u03b7abebn\n) \u00d7 ( \u03b4b\na 0 0 (e\u22121e\u0304)ba\n) . (5.3)\n10Type IIA supergravity was formulated in [35, 36] by dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity [37]. Its massive deformation was introduced in [38]. Type IIB supergravity was formulated in [39, 40]. The starred cases were proposed by Hull [29]. Type IIA supergravity was discussed in superspace in [41, 42] and the IIB superspace was already employed in [40].\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nThe last factor is an element of O(1, 9) \u2282 O(10, 10). If the full double Lorentz group is gauged, then we may always discard this as a gauge choice. However, if only SO(1, 9) or SO+(1, 9) are gauged, we must more carefully account for it. As argued in [9, 10, 19], this factor is crucial for distinguishing between the various duality frames for the RamondRamond sector.\nThe spinorial form of the vielbein may also be written as a product of three factors,\n| /V \u3009 = Sb \u00d7 | /V e\u3009 \u00d7 /\u039b (5.4)\nwhere Sb is a Fock-space operator (i.e. it carries curved spinor indices on both sides), | /V e\u3009 is a bispinor-valued ket (i.e. it carries a single curved spinor index on the left), and /\u039b is spinor Lorentz transformation. We are treating | /V e\u3009 here as a bispinor-valued ket rather than a ket with an additional flat spinor index on the right. Thus it is crucial here that V\u039b is purely a right-handed Lorentz transformation, and so we may write /\u039b simply by right multiplication. In treating the spinorial vielbein asymmetrically in this way, we have to give prescriptions for how each of these objects behaves. The Kalb-Ramond factor is\nSb = exp ( \u2212 14\u0393 mnbnm ) = exp ( \u2212 12\u03b2 m\u03b2nbnm ) (5.5)\nand acts as Sb\u03b2mS\u22121b = \u03b2m and Sb\u03b2mS \u22121 b = \u03b2m + \u03b2nbnm.

This would suggest introducing a spinorial Lorentz transformation \u039b\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 and defining a new gravitino EM \u03b1\u0303 transforming under the left Lorentz group by\nEM \u03b1 = EM\u03b2\u0303\u039b\u03b2\u0303 \u03b1 . (5.21)\nWe would expect this spinorial \u039b to obey\n\u039b\u03b1\u0303\u03b3 (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b3\u03b4 \u039b\u03b2\u0303 \u03b4 ?= (\u03b3\u0304b)\u03b1\u03b2\u039bb a . (5.22)\nThis fails! One obvious reason is that we are employing a chiral basis for the 10D \u03b3matrices, which cannot account for Lorentz transformations that flip chirality (i.e. with an odd number of orientation reversals). However, this fails to be possible even for a combined time and space orientation reversal, where one would find a minus sign in the above equation. The reason is that the correct relation for \u03b3 matrices would read (in Dirac notation) /\u039b\u03b3\u0304a /\u039b\u22121 = \u03b3\u0304b\u039bba. For (5.22) to be satisfied, we need (/\u039b\n\u22121)\u03b4\u03b2\u0303 = (/\u039b)\u03b2\u0303\u03b4 and this holds only for the connected part, SO+(1, 9) = O(+,+)(1, 9). Luckily, all O(1, 9) transformations may be understood as a fixed element \u039b\u030a in one of the four connected sectors times an SO+(1, 9) transformation \u039b\u0307. We write this as\n\u039bab = \u039b\u030aac \u039b\u0307cb (5.23)\n\u2013 45 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nThen we choose \u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 to obey\n\u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303\u03b3 (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b3\u03b4 \u039b\u0307\u03b2\u0303 \u03b4 = (\u03b3\u0304b)\u03b1\u03b2\u039b\u0307b a . (5.24)\nThis leads us to define the following constant quantities:\n(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 := (\u03b3 b)\u03b1\u03b2 (\u039b\u030a \u22121)b a , (\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 := \u2212(\u03b3b)\u03b1\u03b2 (\u039b\u030a\u22121)b a . (5.25)\nThis is equivalent using the full vector and spinorial \u039b:\n(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 = \u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303 \u03b3\u039b\u0307\u03b2\u0303 \u03b4 (\u03b3b)\u03b3\u03b4 (\u039b \u22121)b a , (\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 = \u2212(\u03b3b)\u03b3\u03b4 (\u039b\u22121)b a (\u039b\u0307\u22121)\u03b3\u03b1\u0303(\u039b\u0307\u22121)\u03b4 \u03b2\u0303 . (5.26)\nThe reason we have included an additional sign for (\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 is to recover the same Clifford algebra as the standard \u03b3-matrices\n(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303(\u03b3 b)\u03b2\u0303\u03b3\u0303 + (\u03b3b)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303(\u03b3 a)\u03b2\u0303\u03b3\u0303 = 2 \u03b7ab \u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b3\u0303 . (5.27)\nThe four different possibilities correspond to each of the four duality frames IIB, IIA, IIB\u2217, and IIA\u2217. We are free to make whatever choice we wish for \u039b\u030a. The most convenient choices are as follows:\n\u039b\u030a =  1 IIB R01\u00b7\u00b7\u00b79 IIB\u2217 R1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b79 IIA R0 IIA\u2217\n(5.28)\nwhere Ra denotes a sign flip of the a direction. Note that R1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b79 is equivalent to R9 up to a constant SO+(1, 9) transformation, but the former is more convenient for our choice of \u03b3-matrices. Keeping in mind that (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03b3 a)\u03b1\u03b2 and (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u03b2 , these lead to\n(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 =  (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIB \u2212(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIB\u2217 \u2212(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIA (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIA\u2217 , (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 =  (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIB \u2212(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIB\u2217 \u2212(\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIA (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2 IIA\u2217 . (5.29)\nThe \u03b1\u0303 index for IIA/IIA\u2217 must be understood as the opposite chirality as \u03b1. Thus we denote for the gravitino, for example,\nEM \u03b1\u0303 = EM\u03b1 \u2032 IIB/IIB\u2217\nEM\u03b1 IIA/IIA\u2217 (5.30)\nwhere prime for IIB/IIB\u2217 denotes this being the second gravitino. One way of understanding these expressions for (\u03b3a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 is via the supersymmetry algebra,\n{Q\u03b1, Q\u03b2} = \u2212 k\u221a 2 (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u03b2Pc , {Q\u03b1\u0303, Q\u03b2\u0303} = \u2212 k\u221a 2 (\u03b3c)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303Pc . (5.31)\n\u2013 46 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nFor IIB, the second SUSY is just a copy of the first. For IIA, the extra sign factor in (5.29) is needed so that both chiralities may be combined into a single 32-component supercharge with\n{Q,Q} = k\u221a 2 \u03b3c\u03b3\u2217C \u22121 Pc = k\u221a 2 \u03b3cC\u2212111D Pc , (5.32)\nwhich is the natural truncation from the D = 11 supersymmetry algebra. But we are also allowing here for the possibility of the starred supergravities. In the formulation we are using, these have the wrong sign in the supersymmetry algebra from their unstarred analogues. Alternatively, one can multiply all upper/lower tilded spinors by \u00b1i (i.e. make an imaginary similarity transformation) to restore the conventional sign for supersymmetry, but at the cost of changing the reality condition for tilded spinors (and the RamondRamond bispinor). The upshot is that we now can, without any gauge-fixing, split VE\u039b into VE\u00d7V\u039b where VE is given in the toroidal basis by (5.19) with\nEM A = (EM a, EM\u03b1, EM\u03b1\u0303) (5.33)\nand V\u039b is given in the chiral basis as\n(V\u039b)AB =  \u03b4a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u039bab 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 (\u039b\u0307\u2212T )\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\n , \u039bab = \u039b\u030aac\u039b\u0307cb (5.34)\nPart of this is an SO+(1, 9) transformation, which can be eliminated by a gauge transformation; the remainder can be thought of as a constant similarity transformation on barred vector indices, converting barred gamma matrices (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2 to (\u03b3 a)\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\u0303 in (5.29)."

This means that tilde spinor indices are identical to barred spinor indices (because \u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2), but it will be useful to keep the tilde notation anyway.

(5.52)\nThis gives the supergravity \u2126 in terms of the DFT one:\n\u2126cba = 1\u221a 2 (F\u030acb\u0303a\u0303 \u2212 F\u030ac\u0303ba) = 1\u221a 2 (\u2126c\u0303ba \u2212 \u2126cb\u0303a\u0303)\u2212 \u03b7cdS d\u03b3\u2126\u03b3b\u0303a\u0303 \u2212 \u03b7cdS d\u03b3\u0303\u2126\u03b3\u0303ba (5.53)\nThe other dimension 1 torsion components involve T\u03b3\u0302b\u03b1\u0302. First, we compute\nT\u03b3b \u03b1 = \u221a 2F\u030a\u03b3b\u0303 \u03b1 \u2212 14\u2126bcd(\u03b3 cd)\u03b3\u03b1 = \u2212 1 4 \u221a 2 (F\u030abc\u0303d\u0303 + F\u030ab\u0303cd)(\u03b3 cd)\u03b3\u03b1 = \u2212 1 8Hbcd(\u03b3 cd)\u03b3\u03b1 , (5.54)\nand similarly\nT\u03b3\u0303b \u03b1\u0303 = +18Hbcd(\u03b3 cd)\u03b3\u0303 \u03b1\u0303 . (5.55)\nFor the remaining torsion components, we have\nT\u03b3\u0303b \u03b1 = C\u03b3\u0303b\u03b1 = \u221a 2F\u030a\u03b3b\u0303 \u03b1 = \u2212 \u221a 2(VS)\u03b1\u03b2F\u03b2\u03b3b\u0303 = k \u221a 2S\u03b1\u03b2\u0303(\u03b3b)\u03b2\u0303\u03b3\u0303 , (5.56)\nand similarly,\nT\u03b3b \u03b1\u0303 = \u2212k \u221a 2S\u03b1\u0303\u03b2(\u03b3b)\u03b2\u03b3 . (5.57)\nWe emphasize that the results given here for the torsion and H-flux tensors are actually gauge-invariant under the higher \u03bb symmetries and the right Lorentz group (as they must be, since they are built out of invariant potentials) and could have been derived without imposing the gauge (5.35).\n\u2013 50 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7"

            "text": "To completely characterize type II supergravity we must also derive the Ramond-Ramond field strengths. This will require some knowledge of the spinorial supervielbein. It turns out to be easy enough to work in a generic gauge here, so we will not impose (5.35). Recall that we had introduced the spinorial supervielbein in section 3.3 as an operator /\u0302V converting the super-Fock space to the spinor Fock space. Just as we decomposed the bosonic spinorial vielbein in (5.4), we will split up the spinorial supervielbein in a somewhat asymmetric way, writing\n/\u0302V = SB \u00d7 /\u0302VE\u039b \u00d7 /\u0302VS . (5.58)\nThe first factor SB is a pure Fock space operator:\nSB = exp ( \u2212 14\u0393 MNBNM ) = exp ( \u2212 12\u03b2 M\u03b2NBNM ) (5.59)\nNext, /\u0302VE\u039b is an operator converting the Fock space to the spinor Fock space. It acts as\n\u0393M /\u0302VE\u039b = /\u0302VE\u039b \u00b7 \u0393A(VE\u039b)AM . (5.60)\nDecomposing this explicitly gives\n\u0393M /\u0302VE\u039b = 1\u221a 2 \u03b3a /\u0302VE\u039bEaM + 1\u221a 2 \u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304aEaM\n+ \u221a 2 \u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304\u2217b\u03b1E\u03b1M + \u221a 2 \u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304\u2217b\u03b1E\u03b1M ,\n(\u2212)m\u0393M /\u0302VE\u039b = 1\u221a 2 EM a\u03b3a /\u0302VE\u039b + 1\u221a 2 EM a\u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304a\n\u2212 \u221a 2EM\u03b1 \u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304\u2217b\u03b1 \u2212 \u221a 2EM\u03b1 \u03b3\u2217 /\u0302VE\u039b\u03b3\u0304\u2217b\u03b1 . (5.61)\nAs a sanity check, one can confirm that the Clifford algebra is satisfied. Finally the factor /\u0302VS is given in terms of flat \u0393A matrices as\n/\u0302VS = exp ( \u2212 12\u0393\u03b1\u0393\u03b2S \u03b2\u03b1 \u2212 14\u0393\u03b1\u0393\u03b2S \u03b2\u03b1 \u2212 14\u0393\u03b1\u0393\u03b2S \u03b2\u03b1 \u2212 12 \u221a 2\u0393\u03b1\u0393bSb\u03b1 \u2212 1 2 \u221a 2\u0393\u03b1\u0393bS b\u03b1 ) .\n(5.62)\nThis must be evaluated acting to the left on a bispinor-valued Fock space. Now we can analyze the connection between the orthosymplectic Ramond-Ramond spinor field strength \u3008F| and its flattened version. First, let us recall that \u3008F| is given by the conventional expansion\n\u3008F| = \u2211 p 1 p!\u30080|\u03b2 M1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2MpFMp\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7M1 . (5.63)\nWe have asserted its flattened version to be given by\n\u3008 /\u0302F| = \u3008F| /\u0302V \u03a6\u22121/2 = \u22124k (\n0 0 \u30080|b\u03b1b\u03b1 0\n) . (5.64)\n\u2013 51 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nUsing the decomposed spinorial vielbein, this can be rewritten as\n\u3008 /\u0302F| /\u0302V\u22121S = \u3008F\u0302 | /\u0302VE\u039b \u03a6 \u22121/2 , (5.65)\nwhere \u3008F\u0302 | = \u3008F| /\u0302VB is given by (5.63) with F replaced by F\u0302 = Fe\u2212B. What has happened here is identical to what occurs in the bosonic analysis: the\npolyform F = \u2211 pFp that naturally appears in double field theory is a complex of closed p-forms that transform into each other under the B-field gauge transformations. They are related to invariant field strengths F\u0302p by\nF\u0302 = \u2211 p F\u0302p = \u2211 p Fp e\u2212B = F e\u2212B . (5.66)\nThe polyform F\u0302 is not closed but obeys dF\u0302 = \u2212F\u0302 \u2227H. We are now going to separately analyze the two sides of (5.65). Let\u2019s start with the left:\n\u3008 /\u0302F|/V\u22121S = \u22124k \u30080| ( \u2212ib\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1 \u2212\u03c7\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\nb\u03b1b\u03b1 + S\u03b1\u03b1 ib\u03b1\u03c7\u03b1 ) = \u22124k \u30080| ( bb\u0304\u2032 + ib\u03c7\u0304\u2032 + i\u03c7b\u0304\u2032 + /S \u2212 \u03c7\u03c7\u0304\u2032 ) . (5.67)\nIn the first line we have written the expression in Weyl notation and in the second line we have repeated it in Dirac notation. Recall here that in our convention for Dirac notation, a Majorana fermion \u03c8 decomposes as \u03c8 = (\u03c8\u03b1, \u03c8\u03b1) and \u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8TC = (\u03c8\u03b1, \u03c8\u03b1), and similarly for barred indices, with these spinors denoted by primes. We emphasize that no gauge fixing was required here; this is a consequence of (5.64) being invariant under HL \u00d7HR. For the right-hand side of (5.65), we will need to do some work. First, we define, here in this section alone, flattened versions of the Fock space raising operators,\n\u03b2a := \u03b2MEM a , \u03b2\u03b1 := \u03b2MEM\u03b1 , \u03b2\u03b1 := \u03b2MEM\u03b1 . (5.68)\nNote that we are using EM\u03b1 rather than EM\u03b1\u0303 here. This will be temporary but very convenient to avoid introducing just yet the Lorentz transformation taking us from tilde to barred spinor indices. Now we require the following lemmas:\n\u30080|\u03b2a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap /\u0302VE\u039b = \u03b3ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z| \u00d7 E1/2 , (5.69a)\n\u30080|\u03b2a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap\u03b2\u03b1\u0302 /\u0302VE\u039b = \u03b3\u2217\u03b3ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z|\u03b3\u0304\u2217b\u03b1\u0302 \u00d7 E1/2 , (5.69b)\n\u30080|\u03b2a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap\u03b2\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u03b2\u0302 /\u0302VE\u039b = \u03b3ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z|b\u03b1\u0302b\u03b2\u0302 \u00d7 E1/2 . (5.69c)\nThese expressions involve the flat bispinor vacuum\n\u3008/Z| := \u30080| /\u0302VE\u039b = 1\n25/2 \u30080|/\u039b (5.70)\nwhere /\u039b is the 32-component Dirac bispinor corresponding to the Lorentz transformation \u039bab. Note that the vielbein superdeterminant E is given by\nE = sdet ( EM a, EM \u03b1, EM \u03b1\u0303 ) = sdet ( EM a, EM \u03b1, EM \u03b1 ) , (5.71)\n\u2013 52 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nand can be equally written with EM\u03b1\u0303 in place of EM\u03b1, since \u039b\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 lies in the connected part of the Lorentz group. The proofs of (5.69a)\u2013(5.69c) are fairly straightforward. One can easily show that (5.69c) follows from (5.69b), which follows from (5.69a). The proof of (5.69a) is inductive. The initial step is\n\u30080| /\u0302VE\u039b = 1\n25/2 \u30080|/\u039b\u00d7 E1/2 . (5.72)\nTo show this, we first decompose /\u0302VE\u039b into the product of /\u0302VE and /\u0302V\u039b where EMA = (EMa, EM\u03b1, EM\u03b1\u0303) lies in the connected part GL+(10|32). Then \u30080| /\u0302VE = E1/2 \u00d7 125/2 \u30080|1 follows exactly as in the component calculation. Then the action of /\u0302V\u039b decomposes into two parts: one is the vectorial \u039bab transformation, which generates the Dirac bilinear /\u039b; the second is the connected spinorial transformation \u039b\u0307\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 , which generates its determinant (which is unity) upon acting on the spinorial Fock vacuum. The inductive step follows by observing\n\u30080|\u03b2[a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap] /\u0302VE\u039b = 1 2\u03b3\n[ap ( \u30080|\u03b2a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap\u22121] /\u0302VE\u039b ) + 12\u03b3\u2217 ( \u30080|\u03b2[a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2ap\u22121 /\u0302VE\u039b ) \u03b3\u0304b\u039bb ap]\n= E1/2 (1\n2\u03b3 ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z|+ 12\u03b3\u2217\u03b3 [ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z|\u03b3\u0304b\u039bb ap] )\n= E1/2 (1\n2\u03b3 ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z|+ 12\u03b3\u2217\u03b3 [ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u03b3\u2217\u03b3 ap]\u3008/Z| ) = E1/2\u03b3ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\u3008/Z| . (5.73)\nNow we can apply the lemma (5.69). Let the p-form complex be given in flat indices by\nF\u0302 = \u2211 p 1 p!\u30080|\u03b2 A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b2AP F\u0302AP \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A1 (5.74)\nwhere for now we continue to use EMA = (EMa, EM\u03b1, EM\u03b1) to flatten indices. Comparing this expression to (5.67), it is clear that the only non-vanishing components are F\u0302aP \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 , F\u0302\u03b1 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 , F\u0302\u03b1 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 , and F\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 ap\u22122\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 . This means that we can directly compute\n\u3008F\u0302 | /\u0302VE\u039b \u03a6\u22121/2 = 1\n25/2 e\u03d5\u30080| \u2211 p ( 1 (p\u2212 2)!\u03b3 ap\u22122\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 /\u039b b\u03b1b\u03b2F\u0302\u03b2\u03b1 ap\u22122\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1\n+ 1(p\u2212 1)!\u03b3 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 /\u039b b\u03b1F\u0302\u03b1 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 + 1 (p\u2212 1)!\u03b3 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 /\u039b b\u03b1F\u0302\u03b1 ap\u22121\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 + 1 p!\u03b3 ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 /\u039b F\u0302ap\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 ) . (5.75)\nThe factors of \u03b3\u2217 in (5.69) vanish when we account for the chirality of the bispinor vacuum and the even/odd degree of the p-forms Fp.

If we apply the Lorentz transformation \u039b\u0307 to the field strengths (and also to \u03c7\u03b1), we find that \u039b is replaced by the\n\u2013 54 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nconstant \u039b\u030a above. Now, what kind of object is /\u030a\u039b? It is a constant spinorial Lorentz transformation corresponding to the vectorial \u039b\u030aab. For the four duality frames, it is given by\nIIB /\u030a\u039b \u22121 = ( \u03b4\u03b1\u0303 \u03b2 0\n0 \u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\n) , (5.81a)\nIIB\u2217 /\u030a\u039b \u22121 = ( \u03b4\u03b1\u0303 \u03b2 0\n0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\n) , (5.81b)\nIIA /\u030a\u039b \u22121 = ( 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 0\n) , (5.81c)\nIIA\u2217 /\u030a\u039b \u22121 = ( 0 \u2212\u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2\n\u03b4\u03b1\u0303\u03b2 0\n) . (5.81d)\nThe overall sign choice for each of these is ambiguous, and corresponds to the Z2 ambiguity in the Ramond-Ramond sector. The choice we have made above is rather simple and lets us easily make contact with the results of Wulff [43] . In Weyl notation, we find\nF\u0302\u03b2\u0303\u03b1 ap\u22122\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a1 = \u2212 k\u221a 2 e\u2212\u03d5 \u00d7 \u03b4\u03b2\u0303\u03b2(\u03b3a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap\u22122)\u03b2\u03b1 IIB/IIB\u2217 (p odd)\u03b4\u03b2\u0303\u03b2(\u03b3a1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ap\u22122)\u03b2\u03b1 IIA/IIA\u2217 (p even) (5.82) with the relative sign conventions for starred and unstarred duality frames chosen to match here.

(5.85)\nNote that the bispinor of [30, 43] is chosen to be antisymmetric as opposed to symmetric. Although the starred supergravities were not explicitly given in [30], they can be easily derived by analytic continuation from the unstarred cases. Starting from an unstarred supergravity, one relaxes the reality condition on all fields, then makes an imaginary similarity transformation in superspace,\nD\u03b1\u0303 \u2192 \u2212iD\u03b1\u0303 , EM\u03b1\u0303 \u2192 iEM\u03b1\u0303 , \u03c7\u03b1\u0303 \u2192 \u2212i\u03c7\u03b1\u0303 , S\u03b1\u03b2\u0303 \u2192 iS\u03b1\u03b2\u0303 . (5.86)\nand then reimposes the original reality condition.11 The transformation of the dilatini follows because they are the spinor derivative of the dilaton, and the redefinition of S follows from its embedding in the DFT supervielbein. Alternatively, both redefinitions arise by keeping the higher dimension torsion conditions in section 5.4 unchanged. (The dimension 0 torsion has flipped sign as we have mentioned in (5.31), so that the supersymmetry algebra in the tilde sector has the opposite sign.) But we also must alter the Ramond-Ramond sector with an imaginary factor, because otherwise the dimension 0 constraint (5.82) would imply that the field strengths are imaginary. We choose to flip\nF \u2192 iF (5.87)\nso that the dimension 0 constraint (5.82) is unchanged; this is then responsible for the well-known sign flip of the Ramond-Ramond Lagrangian. One can then easily check that the conditions for the starred supergravities in (5.83) and (5.84) follow from their unstarred analogues."

The latter is built from a 10-form C10 [46, 47].12 Similarly, IIA/IIA\u2217 runs from F\u03020 to F\u030212. The superform C\u030211 has no bosonic part. The 0-form field strength F\u03020 (which has no potential in a conventional sense) is the Romans mass [38]."

Incidentally, this will also yield as the dictionary between the component fields of type II supergravity and their DFT analogues. First, let us give a special decomposition of the square supervielbein EMA = (EM a, EM\u03b1\u0302) used in (5.12):\nEM A = \u03b4mn 0 \u039e\u00b5\u0302n \u03b4\u00b5\u0302\u03bd\u0302 \u00d7 enb \u03c8n\u03b2\u0302 0 \u03c6\u03bd\u0302 \u03b2\u0302  =  ema \u03c8m\u03b1\u0302 \u039e\u00b5\u0302nena \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302 + \u039e\u00b5\u0302n\u03c8n\u03b1\u0302  .

The field \u03c6\u00b5\u0302\u03b1\u0302 appearing here can be identified with the same field in (4.7). For the bosonic double vielbein in V0 of (4.7), we use the decomposition (5.1).

It is an interesting exercise to check this relation explicitly using the two different expressions we have for /\u0302F . The expression in component DFT is (4.39). To derive the analogous expression in type II supergravity requires a bit of work.

            "text": "The goal in this paper was to define the supergeometry of type II double field theory in superspace and to provide the tools to derive component DFT as well as conventional type II superspace, building on the progress made in type I [20]. As in type I, we showed that one can take all torsion and curvature tensors to vanish through dimension two, except for the basic dimension zero constant torsion tensor associated with supersymmetry. It was crucial here that the tangent space group be extended beyond the double Lorentz group. We further built on the discussion of orthosymplectic spinors in [28], giving a prescription for their constant field strength, as well as a complete description for how to transform between \u201ccurved\u201d and \u201cflat\u201d orthosymplectic spinors. An interesting result that came for free was a unified description of democratic type II superspace in section 5.6.\nThere are several additional avenues one could pursue. We highlight a few below.\nGeneralized type II DFT and supergravity. In analyzing the Bianchi identities in section 5, we took pains to separate the Bianchi identities for TABC from those of the dilaton torsion TA. We showed that no data from TA was necessary to constrain the dilaton-independent torsion and curvature tensors through dimension two. Moreover, the constraints imposed on the dilaton torsion and dilaton curvatures (through dimension two at least) could be deduced purely from their Bianchi identities without supposing the existence of a superdilaton field. The reason we organized the analysis in this way is that Tseytlin and Wulff have shown that if one starts with conventional type II superspace and supposes only the constraints of \u03ba-symmetry, one can show that one arrives at generalized type II supergravity [30] (see also [49]). This is a formulation of supergravity where the dilatini are not presumed to arise from the spinor derivative of a dilaton. In addition to the usual supergravity fields, one finds two vectors at dimension 1, denoted Xa and Ka. The latter is a Killing vector of the entire supergravity multiplet. In standard supergravity, Ka vanishes and Xa = Da\u03d5. The constraints we employed for double field theory in superspace are the exact analogues of the \u03ba-symmetry constraints, and so if we were to not suppose the existence of the superdilaton, it is more or less obvious that we should recover the generalized type II supergeometry of Tseytlin and Wulff by generalizing the bosonic discussion of [50] to superspace. The idea is one would replace \u2202M log \u03a6 in the definition of the dilaton flux FA with a more general vector that does not obey the section condition. The dilatini, the vector field Xa, and the Killing vector Ka should then turn out to be various components of this quantity. It would be interesting to work this out in detail.\n\u2013 60 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nGreen-Schwarz action in double superspace. The work of Tseytlin and Wulff was inspired by the question of whether \u03ba-symmetry of the Green-Schwarz superstring uniquely selected out the constraints of 10D supergravity. In light of that, it would be natural to try to formulate a GS-type action using the doubled supergeometry introduced here. Such a doubled worldsheet was discussed by Park already in a flat space background [51] (see also the work by Bandos [52]). This was generalized to include fermions to second order (along with the Ramond-Ramond fields) for more general backgrounds by Sakamoto and Sakatani [53]. A complete formulation should be possible, and one would expect the \u03basymmetry of this action to lead to the constraints we have imposed on TABC . A very similar idea (in Hamiltonian language) was the motivation for [26], where constraints on torsion were motivated also by \u03ba-symmetry. This is a topic we are currently exploring.\nNon-geometric backgrounds. Recent work has emphasized that conventional supergravity backgrounds (i.e. with an invertible metric and two-form) are not the only allowed generalized metrics in double field theory [54\u201356] (see also [57] in exceptional field theory). One such example is the Gomis-Ooguri non-relativistic string background [58], which in the classification scheme of [54] is a (1, 1) non-Riemannian background. This was already discussed in the context of the doubled Green-Schwarz superstring some time ago [51]. This should be able to be addressed in type II supersymmetric double field theory, both at the component level and in superspace.13\nExceptional superspace. A final fascinating topic is the generalization to exceptional field theory. It is well-known that the exceptional groups ED(D) possess O(D,D) subgroups, and so one might consider the embedding of O(10, 10) into E11. In fact, an early discussion of the Ramond-Ramond sector of double field theory (at least in the IIA duality frame) was found in a level decomposition [12] of the E11 formulation of West [11, 59] (see also the recent work on E11 [60, 61] and its supersymmetrization [62]). A natural avenue would be to explore the lower levels of the supersymmetric version of E11 by attempting to encode OSp(10, 10|64) within it. This would involve geometrizing the abelian \u3008\u03bb| transformation of the Ramond-Ramond sector and encoding the Ramond-Ramond potentials \u3008C| into the supervielbein itself. Such an approach has already been explored implicitly by Hatsuda, Kamimura, and Siegel [27], who attempted to geometrize the Ramond-Ramond charges that appear in the supersymmetry algebra. This could be a fascinating springboard to formulating E11 in superspace."

A 32-component Dirac spinor \u03c8 is written in terms of 16-component Weyl spinors as\n\u03c8 = ( \u03c8\u03b1 \u03c8\u03b1 ) (A.3)\nFor a Majorana spinor, its Dirac conjugate is the same as its Majorana conjugate, with\n\u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8TC = ( \u03c8\u03b1 \u03c8\u03b1 ) . (A.4)\nOur \u03b3-matrices are chosen to be Majorana (i.e. real), so that the B-matrix is the identity. Then the Majorana condition is simply \u03c8\u2217 = \u03c8. An explicit realization of 10D Majorana \u03b3-matrices follows from the Majorana representation of SO(8). There one employs 8-component Weyl matrices (\u03c3i)\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 , where here (and here alone) \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0307 denote the 8s and 8c of SO(8). All SO(8) vector and spinor indices are raised and lowered with the identity matrix, and we choose \u03c31(\u03c32)T \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c37(\u03c38)T = 1.14 Then for 10D Majorana gamma matrices, we have in 8\u00d7 8 block notation\n(\u03b3i)\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03b3i)\u03b1\u03b2 = ( 0 \u03c3i\n(\u03c3i)T 0\n) , (\u03b30)\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212(\u03b30)\u03b1\u03b2 = ( 1 0 0 1 ) ,\n(\u03b39)\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03b39)\u03b1\u03b2 = (\n1 0 0 \u22121\n) . (A.5)\nThese 10D \u03b3-matrices have a natural lift to 11D, where we identify \u03b3\u2217 = \u03b310 and C11D = C\u03b3\u2217.\nFor the right sector of SO(1, 9), we take very similar conventions, with\n\u03b3\u0304a = \u03b3\u2217\u03b3a =\u21d2 (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03b3 a)\u03b1\u03b2 , (\u03b3\u0304a)\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212(\u03b3a)\u03b1\u03b2 .

            "text": "In this appendix, we elaborate on how to construct the general form of the supervielbein in type II double field theory in a way that is well-adapted to conventional superspace. This construction in many ways mirrors that of the bosonic case discussed in section 5.1, but involves key additional elements.\nFirst, we identify some specific components of the generalized vielbein as follows:\nV\u03b1M = E\u03b1M , V\u03b1M = E\u03b1M , VaM = 1\u221a 2 EaM , VaM = 1\u221a 2 E\u0304aM . (B.1)\nIn analogy to the two sets of invertible vielbeins eam and e\u0304am in the bosonic case, we propose the following two sets of invertible vielbeins:\nEAM = Ea M E\u03b1 M\nE\u03b1 M\n , E\u0304AM = Ea M E\u03b1 M\nE\u03b1 M  , (B.2) That these should be invertible is a relatively mild assumption; it is true outside of a measure zero set. However, note that both E\u03b1M and E\u03b1M appear in EAM and in E\u0304AM . Moreover, they EAM and E\u0304AM do not transform uniformly under the Lorentz groups. EAM involves a left vector and both types of spinor, while E\u0304AM involves a right vector. Let their inverses be denoted EMA and E\u0304MA. We are going to again give special names to some of these components:\nEMA = ( EM a EM\u03b1 EM\u03b1 ) , E\u0304MA = ( EM a EM \u03b1 E\u0304M\u03b1 ) . (B.3)\nFollowing the bosonic case, we identify a matrix \u039bba and its inverse \u039bab via\nEM a = EMb\u039bba , EMb = EM a\u039bab . (B.4)\nThe fact that such a simple relation exists follows from the fact that E\u03b1M = E\u0304\u03b1M and E\u03b1M = E\u0304\u03b1M . The fact that \u039bba is again a Lorentz transformation follows from the orthosymplectic structure, which we will show in due course. The components E that we have identified obey a certain modified orthonormality condition, which we can write as\n( E\u03b1 M E\u03b1 M Ea M Ea M )  EM \u03b2 EM \u03b2 EM b\nEM b\n =  \u03b4\u03b1 \u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u03b4ab \u039bab\n0 0 \u039bab \u03b4ab\n . (B.5)\nOne can think of (E\u03b1M , E\u03b1M , EaM ) as a square matrix whose inverse is (EM\u03b1, EM\u03b1, EM a). The same statement holds with the vector index a replaced with a barred vector index a, because\nEa M = \u039babEbM , EaM = \u039babEb M .

Start by defining\nSa\u03b2 := \u221212E aM E\u0304M\u03b2 , S\u0304a\u03b2 := \u2212 1 2 E\u0304 aMEM\u03b2 . (B.7)\nThen one can work out a complete dictionary as follows:\nEM a = EM a , E\u0304M a = EM a , (B.8a) EM\u03b1 = EM\u03b1 + 2EMbSb\u03b1 , E\u0304M\u03b1 = EM\u03b1 , (B.8b)\nEM\u03b1 = EM\u03b1 , E\u0304M\u03b1 = EM\u03b1 + 2EMbSb \u03b1 , (B.8c)\nand inverses\nE\u03b1M = E\u03b1M E\u0304\u03b1M = E\u03b1M , (B.9a) E\u03b1M = E\u03b1M E\u0304\u03b1M = E\u03b1M , (B.9b)\nEaM = EaM \u2212 2Sa\u03b2E\u03b2M EaM = EaM \u2212 2Sa\u03b2E\u03b2 M . (B.9c)\nThe fermionic superfields Sa\u03b2 and Sa\u03b2 are the only additional information encoded in EAM and E\u0304AM aside from the EMA vielbeins (and of course the matrix \u039bab). Now, the most general expressions for D\u03b1, D\u03b1, and Da\u0302 are\nD\u03b1 = E\u03b1M\u2202M + V\u03b1M\u2202M , (B.10a) D\u03b1 = E\u03b1M\u2202M + V\u03b1M\u2202M , (B.10b) Da = 1\u221a 2 EaM\u2202M + VaM\u2202M , (B.10c) Da = 1\u221a 2 E\u0304aM\u2202M + VaM\u2202M . (B.10d)\nLet\u2019s focus first on D\u03b1. Using the property that V\u03b1MVM\u03b2 = 0, one can show that E\u03b1MVM\u03b2 is symmetric in \u03b1 and \u03b2. This piece can be identified as part of the Kalb-Ramond two-form, so that\nD\u03b1 = E\u03b1M ( \u2202M \u2212BMN\u2202N (\u2212)n ) . (B.11)\nNext using V\u03b1MVMb = 0 and VaMVMb = \u03b7ab, one can show that\nDa = 1\u221a 2 EaM\n( \u2202M \u2212BMN\u2202N (\u2212)n ) + 1\u221a\n2 (\u2212)mEM a\u2202M (B.12)\nfor the same B-field. Repeating these conditions with barred indices (as well as mixed handedness conditions like VaMVMb = 0), leads to the conclusion\nD\u03b1 = E\u03b1M ( \u2202M \u2212BMN\u2202N (\u2212)n ) , (B.13)\nDa = 1\u221a 2 E\u0304aM\n( \u2202M \u2212BMN\u2202N (\u2212)n ) + 1\u221a\n2 (\u2212)mE\u0304M a\u2202M , (B.14)\n\u2013 64 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nwith the same two-form BMN , along with the additional requirement that \u039bba = \u2212\u039bab. This identifies \u039b as a Lorentz transformation. This is all quite similar to the bosonic case. The main complications arise when analyzing D\u03b1 and D\u03b1. Without loss of generality, D\u03b1 can be written\nD\u03b1 = (Z \u03b1\u03b2 + Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2)D\u03b2 + Z \u03b1\u03b2D\u03b2 + (Z \u03b1b + \u221a 2Sb\u03b1)Db + (YM\u03b1 + EM\u03b1)\u2202M , (B.15)\nin terms of arbitrary Y and Z factors. The additional terms constitute shifts in the generic factors, and as we will show, almost all of the Z and Y terms vanish. For two vectors XA = XAM\u2202M and YA = YAM\u2202M introduce the inner product notation\n\u3008XA, YB\u3009 = XAMYBN \u03b7NM(\u2212)bm . (B.16)\nThen we use\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b2 = \u3008D\u03b1, D\u03b2\u3009 = E\u03b1MYM\u03b2 + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , (B.17a) 0 = \u3008D\u03b1, D\u03b2\u3009 = E\u03b1MYM\u03b2 , (B.17b)\n0 = \u3008Da, D\u03b2\u3009 = Z\u03b2a + 1\u221a 2 EaMYM\u03b2 , (B.17c) 0 = \u3008Da, D\u03b2\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 E\u0304aMYM\u03b2 (B.17d)\nto conclude that YM\u03b1 and Z\u03b1b both vanish. Next we use\n0 = \u3008D\u03b1, D\u03b2\u3009 = Z \u03b1\u03b2 + Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2 \u2212Z \u03b2\u03b1 \u2212 Sc\u03b2Sc\u03b1 \u2212 2Sb\u03b1Sb\u03b2 = 2Z [\u03b1\u03b2] (B.18)\nto conclude that Z \u03b1\u03b2 is symmetric. Similar equations hold for D\u03b1. Then we use\n0 = \u3008D\u03b1, D\u03b2\u3009 = Z \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212Z \u03b2\u03b1 (B.19)\nto prove that Z \u03b1\u03b2 = Z \u03b2\u03b1. We relabel the remaining Z factors as \u2212S, giving\nD\u03b1 = \u2212(S\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2)D\u03b2 \u2212 S\u03b1\u03b2D\u03b2 + \u221a 2Sc\u03b1Dc + E\u0304M\u03b1\u2202M , (B.20a) D\u03b1 = \u2212(S\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2)D\u03b2 \u2212 S \u03b1\u03b2D\u03b2 + \u221a 2Sc\u03b1Dc + EM\u03b1\u2202M . (B.20b)\nNext, it will be useful to identify how these objects transform under the HL \u00d7 HR gauge transformations. Because all superfields transform in a clear way under the double Lorentz group, we focus on the infinitesimal \u03bbb\u03b1, \u03bbb\n\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 , and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 gauge symmetries. From \u03b4V\u03b1M, \u03b4V\u03b1M, and \u03b4Va\u0302M, we deduce\n\u03b4E\u03b1 M = \u03b4E\u03b1M = 0 , \u03b4EaM = \u221a 2\u03bba\u03b2E\u03b2M , \u03b4EaM = \u221a 2\u03bba\u03b2E\u03b2 M , \u03b4BMN = 0 (B.21)\nand then it follows that\n\u03b4EM a = 0 , \u03b4EM a = 0, (B.22a) \u03b4EM\u03b1 = \u2212 \u221a 2 EMb\u03bbb\u03b1 , \u03b4E\u0304M\u03b1 = 0 , (B.22b) \u03b4EM\u03b1 = 0 , \u03b4E\u0304M\u03b1 = \u2212 \u221a 2 E\u0304Mb\u03bbb \u03b1 . (B.22c)\n\u2013 65 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 7\nThis can be summed up as follows. The superfields Sa\u03b1 and Sa\u03b1 simply shift as\n\u03b4Sa \u03b1 = \u2212 1\u221a\n2 \u03bba\n\u03b1 , \u03b4Sa \u03b1 = \u2212 1\u221a\n2 \u03bba\n\u03b1 , (B.23)\nwhile all the EMA factors are invariant,\n\u03b4EM A = \u03b4EAM = 0 . (B.24)\nFrom \u03b4V \u03b1\u0302M and using the explicit expressions in (B.20), we determine that\n\u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 + \u221a 2Sc(\u03b1\u03bbc\u03b2) , (B.25a) \u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 + \u221a 2Sc(\u03b1\u03bbc\u03b2) , (B.25b)\n\u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 (B.25c)\nFinally, we can rewrite the entire inverse supervielbein as a product of three factors\nVAM = (V\u22121S )A B \u00d7 (VE\u039b)BN \u00d7 (V\u22121B )N M (B.26)\nThe third term is built out of the Kalb-Ramond super two-form,\n(V\u22121B )M N =\n( \u03b4M N \u2212BMN (\u2212)n\n0 \u03b4NM\n) , (B.27)\nThe second factor VE\u039b is written, in a chiral decomposition of the indices, as\n(VE\u039b)AM =  1\u221a 2Ea M 1\u221a 2EMa E\u03b1 M 0 0 EM\u03b1 1\u221a 2Ea M 1\u221a 2EMa E\u03b1 M 0\n0 EM\u03b1\n . (B.28)\nThe VS factor is given, also in a chiral decomposition, as\n(V\u22121S )A B =  \u03b4a b \u2212 \u221a 2Sa\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u221a 2Sb\u03b1 \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0 \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2 0 0 0 0 \u03b4ab \u2212 \u221a 2Sa\u03b2 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 0\n0 \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2 0 \u221a\n2Sb\u03b1 \u2212S\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Sc\u03b1Sc\u03b2 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n .
