The rules included having both treatment and control groups, randomly assigning patients to groups, and assigning double blind (meaning neither patient nor physician knew whether the patient was in the treatment or control group). The ethics of randomized controlled trials are complicated but include a requirement of \u201cclinical equipoise,\u201d defined as a state of genuine uncertainty in the medical community regarding the therapeutic merits of a proposed treatment (Freedman 1987).\nDespite this gold standard quality, randomized controlled trials were rarely used because they were expensive and time-consuming (Junod 2016). The thalidomide disaster\u2014which\u00a0 has been called the largest human-made medical disaster in history (Vargesson 2015)\u2014changed that attitude. In the 1950\u2019s, pregnant women with morning sickness were prescribed the drug thalidomide for its antiemetic effects. Unfortunately, within a few years, doctors noticed that thalidomide was associated with a high rate of birth defects. After the dangerous side-effects of thalidomide were recognized, resistance to randomized controlled trials \u201csuddenly melted away,\u201d\n185\n1 3\nLearning with\u00a0insufficient data: a\u00a0multi\u2011armed bandit\u2026\n(Junod 2016).

            "text": "Then the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s presented a new problem: urgency. Young and healthy people suddenly fell ill and died. These patients demanded access to potentially life-saving new treatments now. They did not have years to wait for the results of randomized controlled trials (Jansen and Stryker 1993).\nThere was in fact a precedent for quicker access: If a patient had a life-threatening disease and had exhausted all licensed therapeutic options, the patient\u2019s doctor could request a \u201ccompassionate use\u201d exception to treat the patient with a therapeutic agent that was already under investigation. But obtaining authorization for compassionate use was a slow, ad hoc, per-patient process. AIDS activists successfully pushed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to streamline the process with the 1987 \u201cinvestigational new drug\u201d (IND) regulations (Jansen and Stryker 1993). These regulations sped up AIDS patients\u2019 access to drugs. However, many AIDS activists wanted more and faster approval of drugs, so the tension between safety and urgency was not settled.\nIn the 2020s, the covid-19 pandemic also created urgency, and compassionate use regulations were often invoked to speed access to new treatments. For example, as early as the spring of 2020, the anti-viral remdesivir was administered to patients with severe covid-19 under the U.S. IND compassionate use regulations (Grein et\u00a0al. 2020). Different countries leveraged a variety of compassionate use regulations during the covid-19 pandemic, and internationally standardized \u201cmanaged access programs\u201d have been proposed (Aliu et\u00a0al. 2021)."

In particular, compassionate use harms learning: \u201cThe administration of off-label drug use, compassionate drug use, and uncontrolled studies during a pandemic also could discourage patients and clinicians from participating in RCTs, hampering any knowledge that could be gained\u201d (Kalil 2020). That is, a desperate patient may prefer to receive a new drug under compassionate use rather than enroll in a randomized controlled trial, since a trial provides only a 50/50 chance of actually receiving the new drug rather than a placebo. (Note that urgency does not justify unscientific treatments for covid-19, like drinking bleach.)\nIn summary, public health historically had two extremes of decision-making procedures: the safety of randomized controlled trials or the urgency of exceptions made for compassionate use.\n186 J.\u00a0C.\u00a0W.\u00a0Ortega\n1 3"

In reinforcement learning, the core tradeoff is between learning information and using information, or \u201cexploration\u201d and \u201cexploitation\u201d (March 1991; Kaelbling et\u00a0al. 1996). Randomized controlled trials can be seen as first focusing 100% on learning (exploring), and then, when the study is complete, focusing 100% on using (exploiting) the statistically validated treatment. In contrast, in reinforcement learning, an optimal algorithm would adaptively adjust the balance between learning information and using information based on uncertainty and trials remaining. And when there are no trials remaining, compassionate use would be optimal\u2014doing no learning, just using (exploiting) the treatment that currently seems most promising.\nOf course, public health is concerned with more than just optimality. But the tradeoff between learning and using information has already motivated the use of adaptive clinical trials of pharmaceuticals, so it is useful to understand this perspective to help us apply it to the non-pharmaceutical realm."

            "text": "Let me illustrate the tradeoff between learning and using information with a generic reinforcement learning problem. A \u201ctwo-armed bandit\u201d has two options that must be tried to assess success. An algorithm sequentially selects which option to try, based on past successes and failures. The goal is to design an algorithm that maximizes the total reward over time. This paper will sketch only a simple bandit algorithm. For a recent survey of the huge variety of bandit algorithms, including using\u00a0multiple arms, adjusting for context, and\u00a0applying behavioral or ethical constraints, see (Bouneffouf and Rish 2019).\nSuppose the options are two advertisements for a video camera, one with a cat and one with a dog, and we want to know which ad garners more clicks. The advertiser assesses success by showing users an ad and measuring how many users click on the ad.\nSuppose the dog ad has been shown to 500 users and garnered 5 clicks, which is a click-through rate of 5/500 = 1%. Meanwhile, the cat ad is new and has been shown to only 10 users and garnered zero clicks, which is a 0% click-through rate. If you had to recommend an ad at this point, which would it be? The dog ad has been more successful, so that seems to be the obvious choice. In computer science parlance, choosing the current front-runner is called the \u201cgreedy\u201d algorithm. The dog ad is indeed optimal when there is only one more user to show an ad to. But what if there were one million more users? We are still uncertain about the click-through rate of the cat ad. Then showing the dog ad for the next million users foregoes the opportunity to learn about the true success of the cat ad.\n187\n1 3\nLearning with\u00a0insufficient data: a\u00a0multi\u2011armed bandit\u2026\nThe core insight of the bandit approach is that the \u201cgreedy\u201d algorithm of selecting the currently best option, the \u201cfront-runner\u201d, loses the opportunity to learn about other options. The algorithm that maximizes long-run success instead allocates some trials to learning\u2014if there is uncertainty and enough future trials to enjoy the fruits of learning.\nFor example, the advertiser might show the dog ad to 80% of users and the cat ad to the other 20%. As data is gathered on click-through rates, the proportion seeing each ad shifts to favor the ad garnering more success. If the click-through rate on the dog ad continues to be higher, its proportion would climb to 90% and eventually 100%. But if the cat advertisement started getting a higher click-through rate, then the dog ad\u2019s proportion would drop to 70, 60, 50, and eventually to 0%, which means showing only cat ads.\nShowing one ad 100% of the time of course means learning has ceased. The bandit algorithms find the optimal moment to stop learning and use the fruits of learning. But before that moment, the algorithms maintain a diversity of viable options, converging on a best option only as uncertainty decreases."

            "text": "Now let\u2019s apply the bandit perspective to the algorithms of randomized controlled trials and compassionate use. Randomized controlled trials use both the options equally during the entire trial\u201450% placebo, 50% new treatment\u2014until the required sample size is achieved. From the bandit perspective, this would imply equal uncertainty about both treatments throughout the trial. At the end of the trial, investigators assess whether the treatment had a significant difference from the placebo: if yes, then use the treatment 100% of the time, and if not, revert to the standard of care 100% of the time. From the bandit perspective, all the exploitation of the learning takes place only after the end of the trial.\nCompassionate use would be akin to an allocation of 100% new treatment, a form of greedy algorithm. Recall that the greedy algorithm is optimal if there is only one trial left, and from the perspective of a dying patient, there is only one trial left\u2014their own life! But at the societal level, there are many trials left, so society would prefer to learn. This example illustrates a tension between what is optimal for a dying patient (who has one trial) and what is optimal for society (which has many trials). This tension dissipates if the patient is not deathly ill because the patient has a long life ahead, many future trials. Then the patient has time to benefit from the fruits of learning, too.\nFrom the point of view of bandit algorithms, an optimal algorithm uses an adaptive allocation that varies based on uncertainty and trials remaining. And there actually is a form of clinical trial that leverages this idea."

Adaptive clinical trials were allowed\u2014but not\n188 J.\u00a0C.\u00a0W.\u00a0Ortega\n1 3\nrequired\u2014by the U.S. FDA in 2010 (Pallmann et\u00a0al. 2018). Adaptive clinical trials are similar to bandit algorithms but with full statistical rigor to ensure patient safety. Adaptive trials allow investigators to review the data mid-trial to make certain types of changes to the treatment protocol. A typical change is assigning more patients to the currently more successful \u201carm\u201d of the trial, similar to what bandit algorithms do. However, the adaptations are not ad-hoc: they must be carefully designed upfront by statisticians so that statistically valid conclusions can still be drawn.\nWith such statistical rigor, adaptive trials greatly reduce the safety versus urgency trade-off. They are just as safe as standard trials yet converge to the best treatment faster. As a recent tutorial on the topic explained: \u201cTrials with an adaptive design are often more efficient, informative and ethical than trials with a traditional fixed design since they often make better use of resources such as time and money, and might require fewer participants\u201d (Pallmann et\u00a0al. 2018). That said, the relative merits and ethics of randomized controlled trials and adaptive clinical trials are still debated (Fillion 2019).\nIn any case, the urgency of the covid-19 pandemic spurred not only more compassionate use but also more adaptive clinical trials that came to conclusions more quickly than traditional randomized controlled trials. For example, an adaptive clinical trial to treat severely ill covid-19 patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir began on February 21, 2020. By April 29, 2020, just three months later, preliminary results were shared: patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (Beigel et\u00a0 al. 2020). Based on such results, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir in the treatment of covid-19 in May 2020 (Beigel et\u00a0al. 2020). Adaptive clinical trials helped the world find treatments for covid-19 safely and more quickly than with traditional randomized controlled trials."

Why not? Randomized controlled trials for non-pharmaceuticals tend to be logistically and ethically challenging. And when trials can be undertaken, they tend to require years.

The investigators also could not mandate mask usage, so instead villages in the intervention arm were provided free masks along with encouragement and incentives to wear masks in public. It takes time to distribute masks and to broadcast public health announcements and incentives appropriate for local conditions. Because compliance was far from guaranteed, the investigators also had to measure actual mask usage. Finally, because mask-wearing is tested on healthy people, investigators had to track infection rates over five months to allow time for natural covid-19 outbreaks to develop. In the end, the first results (a preprint) were only available in September 2021. The conclusion was that a 30-percent increase in mask-wearing led to a 10 percent drop in covid-19 infection rates (Abaluck et\u00a0al. 2021).\nThe mask-wearing trial could not easily be made into an adaptive trial because adaptive trials do not work well \u201cif the outcome measure of interest takes so long to record that there is basically no time for the adaptive changes to come into effect before the trial end\u201d (Pallmann et\u00a0al. 2018).\nThe randomized controlled trial assured us of the safety of public mask-wearing\u2014masks did not increase infection rates or have dangerous side-effects.

At that time, using expert best judgment, several major public health agencies\u2014the WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control\u2014recommended against the public wearing face masks (Jingnan 2020). From the bandit point of view, using a single option halts valuable learning if uncertainty was high. So how much uncertainty was there?\nEpidemiologists debated the merits of public mask-wearing in medical journals in February 2020. Some epidemiologists argued in favor of public mask-wearing as the safer option (Greenhalgh et\u00a0al. 2020). Meanwhile, other epidemiologists (Martin et\u00a0 al. 2020) argued that masks could be harmful in several ways. First, if the public re-used dirty masks, pathogens could accumulate and increase infection risk. Second, there were possible bad behavioral side-effects. People who wore masks might not bother to use other, more effective means of reducing transmission, such as avoiding social gatherings. And even worse, these people might feel so protected by masks that they took additional risks, like visiting covid-positive people (\u201cmoral hazard\u201d). And finally, the public might buy so many masks that healthcare professionals could not obtain an adequate supply (Martin et\u00a0al. 2020).\nThis debate demonstrated great uncertainty and therefore a need for learning about public mask-wearing. And\u00a0 there was time to learn and reap the benefits of learning. Even in February 2020, we could anticipate at least a few more months of the pandemic, during which time we could be gathering data about face masks. In that case, putting 100% focus on one recommendation\u2014in this case recommending\n190 J.\u00a0C.\u00a0W.\u00a0Ortega\n1 3\nagainst masks\u2014came at the cost of learning about the true success of wearing masks.

However, some locales, such as Jena, Germany, went against the public health recommendations and required face masks in the spring of 2020 anyway. As a sideeffect, these locales enabled learning about the safety and effectiveness of wearing face masks. Analyses of data from European regions (Mitze et\u00a0al. 2020) and, later, US counties (Lyu and Wehby 2020) provided strong evidence that, to the surprise of health officials, wearing masks reduced covid-19 transmission. The European study summarized the effect size in lay terms:\nConsider a region in which the number of COVID-19 cases increased by 10% from one day to another. This increase would have been only 6% if there had been an obligation to wear face masks. With a 10% daily increase in COVID19, cases double within 7 days; in contrast, a 6% daily increase means cases double only within 12 days (Mitze et\u00a0al. 2020).\nThese researchers did not have randomized controlled trials. Instead, they used a method known as \u201csynthetic control,\u201d which relies on existing variation\u2013 such as before and after a locale mandates masks\u2014to make a statistically-weighted combination of groups to act as a control (Bouttell et\u00a0al. 2018).\nWhile not a gold standard, the findings of the synthetic control studies tilted the weight of evidence toward face masks. By June of 2020, public health authorities reversed course and recommended wearing face masks (Yan 2020). The randomized controlled trial for face masks continued, publishing a preprint in September 2021 (Abaluck et\u00a0al. 2021), 15\u00a0months later, and confirming that the best recommendation was indeed to wear masks. Thus, the learning enabled by cities like Jena brought public mask wearing 15\u00a0months earlier than the\u00a0randomized controlled trial, saving countless lives."

While it was perfectly appropriate to declare that the balance of evidence leaned against public mask wearing in February 2020, the US Surgeon general actively discouraged and even disparaged mask-wearing. His tweet on February 29, 2020, stated: \u201cSeriously peopleSTOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus\u2026\u201d (Jingnan 2020). The tone scolds people who bought masks, even though there were well-respected epidemiologists who advocated wearing masks.\nIn contrast, drinking bleach to prevent or treat covid-19 was never scientifically viable and should always be discouraged. Scientists had no uncertainty about drinking bleach to cure covid-19. There was no learning cost to discouraging bleach because we had no need to learn more about bleach. Ideally, public health officials would focus discouragement where it matters most, such as not drinking bleach."

            "text": "A more lofty communication goal would be to help the public understand all the scientifically viable options, the evidence for and against each option, and the uncertainty about each option. These are the essential inputs to a bandit algorithm and could enable people to choose options that, in aggregate, balance using information with learning new information. From a related perspective, economist Charles F. Manski has argued for \u201cforthright communication of uncertainty in reporting of official statistics and in research that aims to inform policy\u201d (Manski 2020). While the lay public may often seem too unsophisticated to understand uncertainties in science, there is active research on methods to successfully communicate scientific uncertainties, both verbally and visually (Hullman 2022).\nManski goes even further, arguing for actively incentivizing a diversity of policies among the scientifically plausible options when uncertainty is high. For the case of covid-19 interventions in the United States, Manski suggested, \u201cThe federal government can provide incentives to the states to encourage them to enact desirable portfolios of policies\u2026 modifying the incentives as knowledge accumulates\u201d (Manski 2020). The intersection of incentives and diversity with safety and urgency are a topic for future research."

But as new covid-19 variants evolve, uncertainty increases, and we have to shift the balance more toward learning again. For example, in January of 2022, the CDC declared that the public needed better face masks to protect themselves from the new omicron variant (2022). This masking change is unlikely to be the last change in recommendations due to a change in the virus. We need to be ready to learn again whenever uncertainty increases again."

But adaptive algorithms, such as those used in multi-armed bandit problems, show that public health can maintain safety while converging faster to the best option. Adaptive algorithms work by balancing learning information (\u201cexploration\u201d) with using information (\u201cexploitation\u201d), adjusting the allocation as data is gathered and uncertainty decreases. Adaptive clinical trials are already in use for pharmaceuticals and helped more quickly identify safe and effective treatments during the covid-19 pandemic. But we do not yet have adaptive decisionmaking for non-pharmaceuticals, such as whether the public should wear face masks. I hope the bandit algorithms\u2019 perspective will spur the design of better public health decision-making and communication methods so we do not have to rely on rogue experiments by cities like Jena, Germany.\u00a0Let us keep in mind that public health\u00a0pronouncements\u00a0impact future learning.\nAcknowledgements I would like to thank Heather Adkins, Guido Fioretti, Dan Goldstein, Marc Harper, Jake Hofman, Donald MacKenzie, Jesus M.
