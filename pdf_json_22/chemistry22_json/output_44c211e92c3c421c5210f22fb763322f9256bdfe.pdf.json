    "abstractText": "The adiabatic approximation in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is known to give an incorrect pole structure in the quadratic response function, leading to unphysical divergences in excited state-to-state transition probabilities and hyperpolarizabilties. We find the form of the exact quadratic response kernel and derive a practical and accurate approximation that cures the divergence. We demonstrate our results on excited state-to-state transition probabilities of a model system and of the LiH molecule.",

            "text": "Curing the Divergence in Time-Dependent Density Functional Quadratic Response Theory\nDavood Dar,1 Saswata Roy,1 and Neepa T. Maitra1 1Department of Physics, Rutgers University, Newark 07102, New Jersey USA\n(Dated: May 1, 2023)\nThe adiabatic approximation in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is known to give an incorrect pole structure in the quadratic response function, leading to unphysical divergences in excited state-to-state transition probabilities and hyperpolarizabilties. We find the form of the exact quadratic response kernel and derive a practical and accurate approximation that cures the divergence. We demonstrate our results on excited state-to-state transition probabilities of a model system and of the LiH molecule.\nUntil recently, quadratic response has received far less attention than linear response. Most response applications had involved properties related to the optical spectra of a molecule in equilibrium, while relatively few ventured into non-linear regime to gain access to properties such as two-photon absorption, sum-frequency generation, and hyperpolarizabilities which can be obtained from the quadratic response of the ground-state system [1, 2]. However, in the past few decades, nonlinear optical processes have emerged as key in a number of applications, including optical data storage and switching, for examples. Moreover, an increasingly relevant class of applications involve excited-state dynamics, where a molecule is initially photo-excited and coupled electron-ion motion ensues. Such applications inherently require the response of an excited state, appearing in the form of excited state-to-state transition amplitudes. These amplitudes also appear even without nuclear motion: when simulating the dynamics of a molecule in a non-perturbative laser field by expressing the wavefunction in a superposition of eigenstates, coupled by the laser field.\nResponse theory offers a way to obtain these quantities by circumventing the expensive calculation of the excited-state wavefunctions, and may yield more accurate properties when, inevitably, approximations are used. However, response theories of approximate electronic structure theories suffer from an unphysical divergence problem when the difference between two excitation frequencies is equal to another excitation frequency [3]. This had been first discovered in timedependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) forty years ago [4] but lay relatively dormant until the work of Ref. [3] which showed the divergence also appears in response theories based on coupled-cluster, multi-configuration selfconsistent field, and in adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) [3, 5\u20137].\nAddressing this issue for TDDFT [8\u201311] is of great interest: not only does TDDFT have a favorable systemsize scaling enabling the calculation of photo-induced dynamics in complex molecules, it is in principle an exact theory and so offers the possibility of finding more accurate functional approximations that cure the unphysical divergence, which is what we aim to achieve here.\nWe find the form of the exact quadratic response kernel of TDDFT and show explicitly why the adiabatic approximations used thus far are responsible for the incorrect pole structure of the second-order response function that creates the divergence, and that a relatively gentle linear frequency-dependence in the quadratic response kernel corrects the pole structure and tames the divergence. Inspired by this, we derive a frequencydependent approximation for the quadratic response kernel. Results on a two-electron model system and on the LiH molecule show that our approximation provides a practical and accurate fix to the problem of divergences in TDDFT quadratic response.\nIn TDDFT response theory, the central object at each order of response is a density-response function expressed in terms of response functions of the Kohn-Sham (KS) system, and exchange-correlation kernels [10, 12]. The linear density response function of the interacting system to an external perturbation \u03b4vext(r, t), \u03c7(r, r\u2032, t \u2212 t\u2032) = \u03b4n(r,t)\u03b4vext(r\u2032t\u2032) = \u2212i\u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032)\u3008\u03a80|[n\u0302(rt), n\u0302(r\u2032t\u2032)]|\u03a80\u3009, where \u03b8(t\u2212t\u2032) is the step function, has the spectral representation\n\u03c7(r, r\u2032, \u03c9) = \u2211 a ( n0a(r)na0(r \u2032) \u03c9 \u2212 \u2126a + i0+ \u2212 n0a(r \u2032)na0(r) \u03c9 + \u2126a + i0+ ) (1)\nwhere n0a(r) = \u3008\u03a80|n\u0302(r)|\u03a8a\u3009 is the transition density between the ground state, \u03a80 and the excited state, \u03a8a which has excitation frequency \u2126a = Ea\u2212E0 and n\u0302(r) is the one-body density-operator; the 0+ indicates the shift of the pole slightly below the real-axis to ensure causality and will be omitted hereon. In TDDFT, \u03c7 is instead obtained from the non-interacting KS system, through the Dyson-like equation [13, 14]\n\u03c7tddftij (\u03c9) = \u03c7S,ij(\u03c9) + \u03c7S,ik(\u03c9)fHXC,kl(\u03c9)\u03c7lj(\u03c9) (2)\nwhere \u03c7S is the density response function of the KS system and fHXC(\u03c9) is the Hartree-exchange correlation kernel. The indices i, j represent the spatial variables ri and rj and repeated indices imply integration. While \u03c7S(\u03c9) displays residues given by transitiondensities between ground and excited states of the KS system, and poles given by KS excitation frequencies, the linear response (LR) kernel, fHXC,kl[n0](t \u2212 t\u2032) =\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n09 88\n5v 3\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ch\nem -p\nh] 2\n8 A\npr 2\n02 3\n\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032) |rk\u2212rl| + \u03b4vXC[n](rk,t) \u03b4n(rl,t\u2032) \u2223\u2223\u2223 n=n0 , corrects these to those of the true response function. Almost always, an adiabatic approximation is used, where the exchangecorrelation potential vXC[n](r, t) depends only on the instantaneous density and is approximated by the functional derivative of a ground-state energy functional, EXC[n]. This results in a frequency-independent kernel, fadia XC,ij [n](\u03c9) = \u03b42EXC[n] \u03b4n(ri)\u03b4n(rj)\n. With an adiabatic approximation, LR TDDFT has become a workhorse of electronic structure calculations, yielding excitation spectra with an unprecedented balance between accuracy and effi-\nciency. The adiabatic approximation is known to fail for certain classes of excitations, and improved, frequencydependent, approximations have been derived for some cases, e.g. double-excitations [15, 16].\nGoing to second-order in the perturbation, defines the quadratic response (QR) function [12, 17, 18], \u03c7(2)(r, r1, r2, t\u2212 t1, t\u2212 t2) = \u03b4 2n(r,t) \u03b4vext(r1,t1)\u03b4vext(r2,t2) :\n\u03c7(2)(r, r1, r2; t\u2212 t1, t\u2212 t2) = (\u2212i)2\n2 \u03b8(t\u2212 t1)\u03b8(t1 \u2212 t2)\n\u00d7 \u3008\u03a80| [[n\u0302(r, t), n\u0302(r1, t1)] , n\u0302(r2, t2)] |\u03a80\u3009 + (1\u2194 2) (3)\nwhich has the spectral representation [18]\n\u03c7(2)(r, ri, rj , \u03c9i, \u03c9j) = 1\n2 \u2211 a,b ( n0a(r)nab(ri)nb0(rj) (\u03c9i + \u03c9j \u2212 \u2126b)(\u03c9j \u2212 \u2126a) \u2212 n0a(rj)nab(r)nb0(ri) (\u03c9i \u2212 \u2126b)(\u03c9j + \u2126a) + n0a(rj)nab(ri)nb0(r) (\u03c9i + \u03c9j + \u2126b)(\u03c9i + \u2126a) + (i\u2194 j) ) (4)\nwhere the state-a to state-b transition density is nab(r) = \u3008\u03a8a|n\u0302(r)|\u03a8b\u3009, and can be extracted from double residues of \u03c7(2). The second-order response may be extracted from TDDFT linear response quantities together with a QR kernel gXC(r, r1, r2, t\u2212 t1, t\u2212 t2) = \u03b4 2vXC(r,t) \u03b4n(r1,t1)\u03b4n(r2,t2) \u2223\u2223\u2223 n0 through [12, 19, 20]:\n\u03c7(2),tddftmnp (\u03c91, \u03c92) = \u03c7mi(\u03c91 + \u03c92)\u03c7 \u22121 S,ij(\u03c91 + \u03c92)\u03c7 (2) S,jkl(\u03c91, \u03c92)\u03c7 \u22121 S,lq(\u03c91)\u03c7qn(\u03c91)\u03c7 \u22121 S,kr(\u03c92)\u03c7rp(\u03c92)\n+ \u03c7mi(\u03c91 + \u03c92)gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92)\u03c7jn(\u03c91)\u03c7kp(\u03c92) (5)\n(again using the index notation for spatial dependences). In the adiabatic approximation, gadia XC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92) = \u03b43EXC[n] \u03b4ni\u03b4nj\u03b4nk \u2223\u2223\u2223 n=n0 is frequencyindependent. Eq. (5) is usually recast in terms of a matrix in the space of KS single-excitations in molecular codes, e.g. [21, 22], or written in a Sternheimer formulation [10, 23], which has enabled calculations of a wide range of non-linear optical properties of complex systems, e.g. [24\u201328] However, several works encountered greatly exaggerated responses in domains where the difference between two excitation frequencies \u2126b and \u2126c is equal to another excitation frequency, \u2126a, i.e. \u2126c \u2212\u2126b = \u2126a [3, 6, 7, 29, 30], which, in this work, we call the \u201cresonance condition\u201d. Ref. [3] tracked this unphysical divergence to an incorrect pole structure in \u03c7(2),tddft when an adiabatic approximation is made, pointing out the similarity to the divergence observed in Ref. [4] for TDHF, as well as in other response theories. The question arises: Since TDDFT is in principle an exact theory, what is the structure of the exact QR kernel that cures this divergence? And can we build a practical approximation that inherits this behavior?\nTo answer these questions, we construct the exact \u03c7(2) in a Hilbert space truncated to contain four many-body\nstates, denoted 0, a, c, c\u2032, and solve for the exact form of the QR kernel in this truncated space by inversion of Eq. (5). The resonant case is met when \u2126c = 2\u2126a. We include the possibility of a double-excitation contribution to the many-body states, where the states c and c\u2032 are approximately linear combinations of a single KS excitation \u03bd3 and a double KS excitation 2\u03bd1 (see Fig. 1 for a slightly more general truncation, and note that in this paper we will refer to KS excitations via the symbol \u03bd and true excitations via the symbol \u2126). In fact the resonance condition is suggestive of a state of doubleexcitation character: \u2126c = \u2126b + \u2126a would have doubleexcitation character if \u2126a and \u2126b are predominantly single excitations out of a Slater determinant reference and if the TDDFT corrections to the excited state energies are small. We will consider the second-order response at frequencies, \u03c91, \u03c92 that are much closer to \u2126a than to \u2126c.\nTo simplify the inversion, we assume that the KS states have frequencies \u03bd1, \u03bd3 well-separated from each other, and far enough from the ground-state, such that the single-pole approximation may be applied [10, 13, 31, 32]. Then, constructing the linear response functions \u03c7 and \u03c7S, and the KS quadratic response function \u03c7 (2) S and using them in Eq. (5)(see Supplemental Material for detail) gives\n\u03c7(2),tddftmnp (\u03c91, \u03c92) =\n( ac,mi\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c + ac\u2032,mi \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c\u2032\n)[ a\u22121\nS3,ij \u03bd21 2\u21262a ( AS13,jnp \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a + AS13,jpn \u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a )\n+ a\u22121 S3,ij \u03bd21 \u21262a \u3008fHXC\u30091(AS13,jnp +AS13,jpn) + gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92)aa,jnaa,kp\n(\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a)(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a)\n (6)\nwhere AS13,jnp = nS01(rj)nS13(rn)nS30(rp), aS3,ij = nS03(ri)nS30(rj), defined in terms of the KS transition densities. The residue ac,mi = n0c(rm)nc0(ri) and \u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091 =\u222b \u03c60(r)\u03c61(r)fHXC(r, r \u2032, \u03c9)\u03c60(r \u2032)\u03c61(r\n\u2032)d3rd3r\u2032. All quantities on the right of Eq. (6) can be obtained from LR TDDFT, the QR kernel, or from the KS system directly.\nWhen gXC is independent of frequency, the incorrect pole structure is salient, with the last line of Eq. (6) having a three-pole structure instead of the two appearing in the exact \u03c7(2) of Eq. (4) [3, 6, 30]. We note that in\nmost cases the frequencies \u03c91,2 are in a region dominated by single excitations, where the adiabatic approximation for the linear response xc kernel fXC does a reasonable job, i.e. the exact fXC does not have important frequency-dependence in the region it is probed in Eq. (6). Instead, it follows that gXC must carry a frequency-dependence that removes the extra pole, which means the numerator of the last term in Eq. 6 must be of the form: Xinp(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a) + Yinp(\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a) where Xinp and Yinp are functions of {ri, rn, rp}. The permutation-symmetry of \u03c7(2) under (r1, \u03c91)\u2194 (r2, \u03c92) implies Yinp = Xipn, leading to:\nXinp(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a) +Xipn(\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a) = gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92)aa,jnaa,kp + a\u22121S3,ij \u03bd21 \u21262a \u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091(AS13,jnp +AS13,jpn) (7)\nEq. (7) shows that the exact QR kernel gXC in the vicinity of \u03c91,2 close to \u2126a has a linear frequency-dependence. For the general case where \u2126a 6= \u2126b, a similar analysis leads to gXC(\u03c91 \u2248 \u2126a, \u03c92 \u2248 \u2126b) having a linear behavior as X(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a) + Y (\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126b). It remains now to derive an approximation for Xinp which yields a practical approximation for gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92).\nIn order to determine Xinp, we interpolate between\ntwo limiting cases. The first is to set gXC \u2192 gadiaXC when \u03c91 = \u03c92 = 0 in Eq. (7), which gives an equation for Xinp +Xipn. A possible solution is\nXinp = \u22121 2\u2126a\n( gadiaXC,ijkaa,jnaa,kp + a \u22121 S3,ij\n\u03bd21 \u21262a \u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091AS13,jnp ) (8)\nUsing Eq. (8) in Eq. (7) gives gApp,1XC (\u03c91, \u03c92) that corrects the single-excitation contribution (AS13,jnp ) to the\nquadratic response but appears not to include doubleexcitation contributions to the transition density. It is unclear whether the first term captures true doubleexcitation character because an adiabatic QR kernel yields a response that has poles at sums of LR-corrected single excitations without any mixing with doubleexcitations and even these poles are missing when only forward transitions are kept [33, 34]. Our second limiting case therefore focusses on the double-excitation contribution.\nThus the second limit is the opposite case when state c is a close to a pure double excitation. Considering Fig. 1 the KS state 3 is absent and we denote the KS state with two electrons excited to orbital 1 at the dashed line, as d. The KS residue appearing in Eq. (6), AS1d,ijk = nS01(ri)nS1d(rj)nSd0(rk) = 0 due to the last factor, and\nequating Eq. (6) to the true \u03c7(2) in this limit yields\nac,mig App,2 XC,ijkaa,jnaa,kp =\n1 2 [(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a)Aca,mnp\n+ (\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a)Aca,mpn] (9)\nThe residue Aca = n0cnacna0, contains the groundto-excited transition densities of the true system n0a and n0c which are accessible from LR, and substituting the KS excited-to-excited transition density n1d for nac in Eq. (9) gives the second limit in our approximation for gXC. Our final approximation interpolates between the two limits through the weighting of the double-excitation component to the true state (details in the Supplemental Material),\ngApp XC,iqr(\u03c91, \u03c92) = \u2212\n( \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 2\u2126a\n2\u2126a\n) gadiaXC,iqr \u2212 ( a\u22121 S3,ij\n\u03bd21 \u21263a \u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091(\u03c91AS13,jnp + \u03c92AS13,jpn) (10)\n+ a\u22121c,im\n2 (\n\u221a 1\u2212 aca\u22121S3 )mo n0c(ro)\n2 [(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a)nd1(rn)n0a(rp) + (\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a)nd1(rp)n0a(rn)]\n) a\u22121a,nqa \u22121 a,pr\nFor an excited state c that has predominantly singleexcitation character, the first two terms dominate, while the third term incorporates the effect of its doublyexcited character. As evident from Eq. (10), all ingredients for our approximation can be obtained from linear response TDDFT, or adiabatic QR TDDFT.

Eq. (12) can be compared with the adiabatic approximation, for which\nnadiaca (r) = ( \u03bd1 \u2126a )3/2 \u03b1c ( 1 + \u2126a \u2212 \u03bd1 \u2126c \u2212 2\u2126a ) nS13(r) + n0a(r) \u2126c \u2212 2\u2126a \u222b n0c(r1)g adia XC (r1, r2, r3)n0a(r2)n0a(r3)dr1dr2dr3 . (13)\nThe divergence is evident in the last two terms when the resonant condition, \u2126c \u2212 \u2126a = \u2126a is satisfied; further,\nthere is no contribution from any double-excitation. In practice, there are several ad hoc workarounds to the unphysical divergence, including applying damping factors [21], neglecting the kernels in \u201csimplifiedTDDFT\u201d [35], setting the term to zero, and the pseudowavefunction approximation [3, 5, 6, 36, 37] where orbital relaxation terms in the second-order response are neglected, which is equivalent to solving the secondorder response equation at zero frequency. The second term in Eq. (12) could be viewed as in the pseudowavefunction spirit in the sense that it can be obtained by setting \u03c91 to zero in the divergent term of Eq. (13). The connections with the standard pseudowavefunction approximation are left for future work, including what the implied underlying gXC kernel is; our work suggests it also has a linear frequencydependence. In any case, all the standard workarounds miss any double-excitation contribution to the transition density (the first term in Eq. (12)), which can be significant as our first example below demonstrates.\nOur first example is a model system of two electrons in a one-dimensional harmonic plus linear potential, vext(x) = 1 2x\n2 + \u03b3|x| where \u03b3 is a parameter in the range[\u22121, 1]; varying \u03b3 tunes the system in and out of the resonance condition. The electrons interact via a soft-Coulomb interaction: \u03bb\u221a\n(x1\u2212x2)2+1 , where we con-\nsider \u03bb = 0.2a.u. as a weak interaction in which the assumptions made in Eqs. (6)\u2013(12) apply, but we also consider the results at the full coupling strength \u03bb = 1a.u. In order to test our approximation for the QR kernel alone, without conflating errors from approximations made to the LR treatment, we will use the exact KS and LR quantities in the equations. The LR thus includes doubleexcitation contributions, which would be missing in an adiabatic LR treatment.\nFig. 2 shows the transition dipole moment, \u00b5ac = \u3008\u03a8a|x\u0302|\u03a8c\u3009 between the first two excited states, \u03a8a and \u03a8c for which the resonance condition, in this case \u2126c = 2\u2126a, holds as |\u03b3| \u2192 0. We calculate \u03b1c from the ratio of the matrix element \u3008\u03a80|x\u03022|\u03a8c\u3009 to the corresponding matrix element of the KS system. At the weaker coupling strength \u03bb = 0.2, our approximation Eq. (12) clearly cures the divergence of ALDA shown, and is barely distinguishable from the exact result in quite a wide region around the divergence. Tuning \u03b3 away from \u03b3 = 0, we move away from the resonance condition, and eventually we expect that our approximation may decrease in quality compared to ALDA: the error in our approximation from neglecting the mixing of other single excitations may no longer be negligible compared to the large error caused by the spurious pole in adiabatic approximations in the resonance region. For the particular case here, our approximation continues to do well for positive \u03b3 where the system remains harmonic at large distances, while for negative values a double-well develops in vext which brings the two lowest energy levels closer together as delocalized orbitals, deviating from the more clearly separated levels of a single well, and\nleading to a breakdown of the single-pole-like assumptions in the derivation of Eq. (12). Although our approximation was derived in the limit of well-separated excitations, we still observe a good performance at full coupling strength \u03bb = 1.0 (right panel in Fig. 2), not only curing the divergence seen in ALDA but also giving predictions close to the exact.\nWe now turn to LiH, using PBE0 [38] with def2-SVP basis set [39], within the Turbomole package [22]. The fourth excited state frequency is close to twice the first excited state frequency in the region around 2.6A\u030a in PBE0; the first and fourth excited states correspond to the first two excited states in the A1 irreducible representation of C2v point group symmetry. Also around this bond-length, the frequency of the lowest doublyexcited KS state matches that of the 4th single KS excitation (see top right panel Fig. 3). The PBE0 excitation energies are a little shifted from those of the reference full configuration interaction calculation taken from Ref. [3], while the transition dipole moment diverges in the resonance region \u21264 = 2\u21261 [3]. Our approximation, applied together with adiabatic PBE0 LR, shown in Fig. 3 tames this divergence, and follows the trend of the exact result, but with an overestimate; the adiabatic LR lacks the double-excitation contribution which, from the upper right panel could be expected to be significant, and so only the second term in Eq. (12) contributes. Further, we set the third term to zero, because we ran into some numerical problems in its extraction from Turbomole; we note that for the two-electron case of the harmonic oscillator where gadiaX is strictly zero and gadiaC was small, it may be small in this case as well. Likely, including this together with the double-excitation contribution with the LR kernel of Ref. [15] should improve the performance of our QR kernel; we leave for future work\nthe investigation of oscillator strengths from a modified dressed LR TDDFT [14, 40, 41] which would be used to determine \u03b1c. The figure shows also the result from the pseudo-wavefunction approximation that is often used [3, 6, 37], which, despite being an ad hoc correction, appears to perform a little better than ours on when compared with the same relative position in FCI. Again, as we move away from the resonance region, our approximation deviates as expected; the prescription would be that we revert to adiabatic PBE0 when the curves meet.\nIn summary, we found the form of the exact frequency-dependent kernel in QR TDDFT and derived an approximate kernel based on this. Tests on the excited-state transition amplitudes of a model system and on the LiH molecule suggest it is a promising practical cure to the unphysical divergence problem in adi-\nabatic QR TDDFT; Eq. (10) can be applied also to cure the divergences in other second-order response properties such as hyperpolarizabilities, two-photon absorption, etc. Our approach can be generalized to situations beyond the single-pole-type of analysis here, when more than one KS single-excitation contributes to a given state. Alternatives to the two limiting approximations that we interpolated between here may lead to improved accuracy and will be explored in future work. This work also stresses the importance of including double-excitation contributions in LR; the kernel of Ref. [15] needs to be generalized to describe how the oscillator strength gets redistributed in this case [14, 40, 41]. We note that TDDFT can also be applied in the real-time domain to obtain non-linear optical properties [42] and the implications of the frequencydomain divergences for the time-domain have yet to be explored. Future work also includes determining whether the divergence is related to the spurious pole shift of generalized LR TDDFT [11, 43, 44] in the adiabatic approximation, as was previously surmised [3]. The QR kernel is the functional derivative, or response, of the LR kernel evaluated at the ground-state, and in this sense may be viewed as containing information about the linear response of an excited state. On the other hand, the pole shifting occurs quite generally, not just in situations where the resonance condition is satisfied."

(I) Derivation of the TDDFT Second Order Response Equation in the Truncated Hilbert Space\nThe Dyson equation for the second-order response function was derived in Ref. [12] in terms of the linear response xc kernel, the KS response function, and the quadratic response xc kernel. (We note a typo in Eq. (173) of Ref. [12] where the step functions on the right should read \u03b8(t\u2212\u03c4)\u03b8(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4 \u2032)). To transform the time-domain expression into the frequency-domain, we Fourier transform using the factors ei\u03c91(t\u2212t1)ei\u03c91(t\u2212t2) [33]. Combining the resulting equation with the Dyson equation in linear response, we obtain\n\u03c7(2),tddftmnp (\u03c91, \u03c92) = \u03c7mi(\u03c91 + \u03c92)\u03c7 \u22121 S,ij(\u03c91 + \u03c92)\u03c7 (2) S,jkl(\u03c91, \u03c92)\u03c7 \u22121 S,lq(\u03c91)\u03c7qn(\u03c91)\u03c7 \u22121 S,kr(\u03c92)\u03c7rp(\u03c92)\n+ \u03c7mi(\u03c91 + \u03c92)gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92)\u03c7jn(\u03c91)\u03c7kp(\u03c92) , (S.14)\nwhere, as in the main text, the subscripts represent the spatial variables. We will evaluate the terms explicitly within the assumption of the truncated subspace discussed in the main text.\nThe frequencies \u03c91, \u03c92 are taken to be far closer to \u2126a than to \u2126c, while their sum \u03c91 + \u03c92 is far closer to \u2126c than to \u2126a. Further, we make a single-pole (Tamm-Dancoff)-like approximation in that we neglect the backward transitions, but we restore the oscillator strength sum-rule when relating the transition amplitudes of the KS and interacting systems.\nWith these considerations, we find the first-order response functions:\n\u03c7ij(\u03c91(2)) \u2248 aa,ij\n\u03c91(2) \u2212 \u2126a where aa,ij = n0a(ri)na0(rj), with n0a(r) = \u3008\u03a80|n\u0302(r)|\u03a8a\u3009 (S.15)\n\u03c7S,ij(\u03c91(2)) \u2248 aS1,ij\n\u03c91(2) \u2212 \u03bd1 , where aS1,ij = nS01(ri)nS10(rj)\n(S.16)\nwhere the subscript S indicates KS quantities, and similarly,\n\u03c7ij(\u03c91 + \u03c92) \u2248 ac,ij\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c + ac\u2032,ij \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c\u2032\n(S.17)\n\u03c7Sij(\u03c91 + \u03c92) \u2248 aS3,ij\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03bd3 (S.18)\nFor the second order KS response function we have\n\u03c7 (2) S,jkl(\u03c91, \u03c92) \u2248\n1\n2\n( AS13,jkl\n(\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03bd3)(\u03c92 \u2212 \u03bd1) + AS13,jlk (\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u03bd3)(\u03c91 \u2212 \u03bd1)\n) (S.19)\nWe make use of the single-pole approximation \u2126a = \u03bd1 + 2\u3008fHXC\u30091 where \u3008fHXC\u30091 \u2261 \u222b drdr\u2032\u03c60(r)\u03c61(r)fHXC(r, r \u2032, \u03c9)\u03c60(r \u2032)\u03c61(r \u2032) (S.20)\nand impose the oscillator strength sum rule within the single-excitation approximation\n\u2126aaa \u2248 \u03bd1aS1 (S.21)\nto express\n\u03c7\u22121 S,kr(\u03c92)\u03c7rp(\u03c92) \u2248 \u03c92 \u2212 \u03bd1 \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a \u03bd1 \u2126a \u03b4kp (S.22)\nWe note that making use of the single-pole approximation includes a diagonal correction to the KS excitation frequency and neglects coupling of the single-excitation to other single-excitations through off-diagonal elements of the kernel; this is justified by the stated assumption that the KS orbital energies are well-separated. This assumption could be relaxed however, at the cost of a more complicated expression for the kernel; this would be in the same spirit as was done in a different context, Ref. [45], when applying the dressed TDDFT kernel to double-excitations in linear polyenes, for example. Since the residues of the response functions are of central interest in this work, we wish to respect and restore the oscillator strength sum-rule as above [14, 31, 32].\nPutting these together we finally obtain\n\u03c7(2),tddftmnp (\u03c91, \u03c92) =\n( ac,mi\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c + ac\u2032,mi \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c\u2032\n)[ a\u22121\nS3,ij \u03bd21 2\u21262a ( AS13,jnp \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a + AS13,jpn \u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a )\n+ a\u22121 S3,ij \u03bd21 \u21262a \u3008fHXC\u30091(AS13,jnp +AS13,jpn) + gXC,ijk(\u03c91, \u03c92)aa,jnaa,kp\n(\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a)(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a)  (S.23) which is Eq. (6) in the main paper.\nB. (II) Approximation for the QR Kernel\nAs observed in the paper, an adiabatic approximation for gXC(\u03c91, \u03c92) leaves the expression for \u03c7(2),tddft with an excess pole compared to the exact \u03c7(2), which is ultimately responsible for the divergence in the residues. An approximation for gXC must have a frequency dependence that removes this pole which means the numerator of the last term of Eq. (S.23) above must be of the form:\nXinp(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a) + Yipn(\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a) (S.24)\nConsidering the symmetry of \u03c7(2) under (rn, rp, \u03c91) \u2194 (rp, rn, \u03c92), we deduce that Yipn = Xipn, and so the approximation for gXC(\u03c91, \u03c92) reduces to finding an approximation for Xinp. Equating the numerator of the last term of Eq. (S.23) to Eq. (S.24) with Yipn = Xipn, gives Eq. (7) in the main text.\nAs discussed in the main paper, our approximation is derived from two limiting cases for which we provide more detail here.\n(i) First limiting case: We set gXC \u2192 gadiaXC when \u03c91 = \u03c92 = 0 in Eq (7) of the main text, which gives Eq. 8 of the main text for Xinp. Such an approximation leads to the QR kernel\ngApp\u22121 XC,iqr (\u03c91, \u03c92) = \u2212\n( \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 2\u2126a\n2\u2126a\n) gadiaXC,iqr \u2212 a\u22121S3,ij\n\u03bd21 \u21263a \u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091(\u03c91AS13,jnp + \u03c92AS13,jpn)a\u22121a,nqa\u22121a,pr (S.25)\nwhich, when inserted into Eq.(6), gives\n\u03c7(2),App\u22121mnp (\u03c91, \u03c92) =\n( ac,mi\n\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c + ac\u2032,mi \u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c\u2032\n)[ a\u22121S3,ij\n\u03bd21 2\u21262a ( AS13,jnp \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a + AS13,jpn \u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a )( 1\u2212 2\u3008fHXC(\u03c92)\u30091 \u2126a ) \u2212 1\n2\u2126a\n( 1\n\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a +\n1\n\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a\n) gadiaXC,ijkaa,jnaa,kp ] (S.26)\nIf we were then to extract the transition density between states a and c (Eq. 11 of the main text), we obtain\nnApp\u22121ca (r) = ( \u03bd1 \u2126a )3/2( 1\u2212 2 \u3008fHXC\u30091 \u2126a ) \u03b1cnS,13(r)\u2212 n0a(r) \u2126a \u222b n0c(r1)g adia XC (r1, r2, r3)n0a(r2)n0a(r3)dr1dr2dr3 (S.27)\nwhere we have defined \u03b12c as an r-independent approximation to ac,ija \u22121 S3,jk:\nac \u2248 \u03b12caS3 (S.28)\nPhysically, \u03b1c reflects the ratio of the true transition density to the KS one. Due to the oscillator-strength sumrule applied within the separated levels assumption, \u03b12c \u2248 \u03bd3/\u2126c when the interacting state is predominantly a single-excitation. When there is mixing with a KS double-excitation however, \u03b12c decreases, reducing to zero in the limit of a pure double-excitation. This approximation (Eq. (S.27)) however appears not to include double-excitation contributions to the transition density. The first term corrects the single-excitation component, while it is unclear whether the second term, which tends to be much smaller than the first, captures true double-excitation character: an adiabatic QR kernel yields a response that has poles at sums of LR-corrected single excitations without any mixing with double-excitations but even these poles are missing when only forward transitions are kept [33]. Our second limiting case therefore focusses on the double-excitation contribution.\n(ii) Second limiting case: Here we consider the case when state c is close to a pure double-excitation of the KS system, denoted d. There is no single KS excitation in the vicinity, so no pole in the KS LR function nearby. This means\nthat the KS residue AS1d,ijk = n01(ri)n1d(rj)nd0(rk) is strictly zero because nd0(r) \u2261 0 since a one-body operator cannot connect determinants different by two orbitals. The interacting residue is small but non-zero because the corresponding term nc0 involves the state c which has small contributions from single-excitations to the KS double excitation that dominates the interacting state in this limit. In this limit the exact interacting \u03c7(2) has the form\n\u03c7(2)mnp(\u03c91, \u03c92) = 1\n2(\u03c91 + \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126c) ( Aca,mnp \u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a + Aca,mpn \u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a ) , Aca = n0cncana0 (S.29)\nso that equating Eq. (S.23) to this, gives Eq. (9) of the main paper. We now approximate the part of the residue Aca that is not accessible from LR, nca simply by the KS transition-density nd1, yielding\nac,mig App\u22122 XC,ijk aa,jnaa,kp =\nn0c(rm)\n2 [(\u03c91 \u2212 \u2126a)nd1(rn)n0a(rp) + (\u03c92 \u2212 \u2126a)nd1(rp)n0a(rn)] (S.30)\nOur complete approximation interpolates between limits (1) and (2) through\ngAppXC = g App\u22121 XC + \u221a 1\u2212 aca\u22121S3 gApp\u22122XC (S.31)\nas in Eq. (10) of the main text, with the rationale that 1\u2212 aca\u22121S3 represents the fraction of the true oscillator strength arising from the double-excitation component of the state.\n[1] M. G.
