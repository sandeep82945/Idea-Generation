    "abstractText": "The coexistence of ceftazidime, which is a popular third-generation of cephalosporin antibiotic, with ubiquitous paracetamol or acetaminophen, is very likely because the latter is given to the patients to reduce fever due to bacterial infection along with an antibiotic such as the former. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the detailed binding of ceftazidime with plasma protein, human serum albumin (HSA), in the absence and presence of paracetamol using spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence, UV-visible, and circular dichroism, along with in silico methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/PBSA-based binding free energy analysis. The basic idea of the interaction was attained by using UV-visible spectroscopy. Further, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that there was a fair interaction between ceftazidime and HSA, and the mechanism of the quenching was a dynamic one, i.e., the quenching constant increased with increasing temperature. The interaction was, primarily, reinforced by hydrophobic forces, which resulted in the partial unfolding of the protein. Low concentrations of paracetamol were ineffective in affecting the binding of ceftazidime with has; although, a decrease in the quenching and binding constants was observed in the presence of high concentrations of the former. Competitive binding site experiments using warfarin and ibuprofen as site markers revealed that ceftazidime neither binds at drug site 1 or at drug site 2, articulating another binding site, which was confirmed by molecular docking simulations.",

In recent years, a lot of studies were performed on this topic and still numerous investigations are going on to understand the mechanisms of interactions of various substances with various types of proteins, enzymes, and receptors [1,2]. The importance of such interactions is due to the possible concurrences of these substances inside living beings. Moreover, several proteins also serve as the drug delivery agents and can be used in designing the drug delivery formulations [3\u20136]. Inside the human body, plasma proteins are the proteins that have a large probability of interactions with the drugs given to treat several illnesses [7]. There are several modes of administration of the drugs in which intravenous, intermuscular, and oral are amongst the most common modes. The drug injected through intravenous or intramuscular mode goes directly to the circulatory system, while the one given orally passes through the digestive system and is absorbed through small intensities then passed into the circulatory system [8,9]. It is the circulatory system that is responsible for the drugs being transported\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14811. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241914811 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J.

Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in the blood that constitutes about 55% of the total plasma proteins and is responsible for controlling the blood osmotic pressure [11]. HSA is a large globular protein and is proficient in binding a large number of endogenous and exogeneous ligands due to its versatile structure, which has several binding sites that can accommodate a variety of ligands [12]. Due to the usefulness, binding efficiency, and prevalence, HSA is one of the most sought-after among scientists to understand its mechanisms with the drugs, small molecules, and ligands [13]. It is also a good candidate as a model protein for understanding protein\u2013ligand interactions [14]. Ceftazidime (Drug Bank ID: DB00438) is a popular third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. It is also given to the patients suffering from flu, cold, or viral infections. Ceftazidime is given to the patients suffering from fever due to infection that have a low white blood cell count. It can also be given in Whitmore\u2019s disease that is an infection of the lungs and can range from mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia. It is also a beneficial drug in the case of certain wound infections and food poisoning. The anticancer activity of ceftazidime, in which it inhibits DLD-1 cells by inducing apoptotic cell death, was also reported very recently [15]. When ceftazidime given to the patients in the form of an injection given intravenously or intramuscularly, therefore, its interaction with HSA inside human body is highly anticipated. Thus, it would be interesting to study the interaction of ceftazidime with HSA. Recently, we studied the interaction of bovine serum albumin and lysozyme with ceftazidime in our previous works [16,17] and in the present study, we elaborated this work by seeing the effect of paracetamol on the binding. It is renowned that paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen (Drug Bank ID: DB00316), is the most common medicines given to the patients suffering from fevers that happens due to the infection. Apart from this, it is also an effective drug to treat moderate pains. Paracetamol is commonly given orally in the form of tablets or syrups, which are absorbed by the small intestine through passive diffusion. It can also be given in the form of injection. Keeping in mind the possibility of co-existence of paracetamol and ceftazidime, particularly, in the bacterial or viral infections, we saw the effect of paracetamol on the binding of HSA and ceftazidime. The use of computational methods in science and technology is increasing day by day. There are several approaches that are advantageous in drug designing and discovery. The combination of experimental and computational studies in a chemical or biochemical process gives a complete picture of its mechanism. Therefore, we applied both experimental and computation methods to study the interaction of ceftazidime with HSA in the absence and presence of paracetamol. The experimental studies were carried out using UV-visible, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopies, whereas in silico studies were accomplished using computational methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA-based binding free energy analysis were performed."

Ceftazidime shows a strong absorption peak at 255 nm and HSA a strong absorption at 280 nm, which is a prominent wavelength in the case of proteins containing aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine because of their absorption at this wavelength [18]. Therefore, the contribution of ceftazidime was subtracted from the UV-visible absorption spectra of HSA-ceftazidime complex (given in Figure 1B along with the UV-visible spectrum of pure HSA), which are considered as the difference spectra [19\u201322]. Figure 1B shows that the absorbance of HSA decreased constantly on the sequential addition of ceftazidime, which is most probably due to the interaction between the protein and drug.\nInt. J. Mol.

The first phenomenon is termed as static quenching, while the second one is known as dynamic quenching. The method to calculate the quenching constants was developed by Stern and Volmer [26], which is also called the Stern\u2013Volmer equation and can be given as: \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 = 1 + \ud835\udc3e [\ud835\udc44] (1) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of HSA in the absence and presence of ceftazidime (quencher), [Q] is the concentration of quencher, and KSV is the Stern\u2013Volmer quenching constant. The values of KSV (Table 1) can be obtained using Equation (1) from the plots of F0/F vs. [Q], which are given in Figure 4A. The involvement of the quenching mechanism, either static or dynamic, can be understood with the help of temperature variation. Dynamic quenching increases in increasing the temperature while static quenching constant decreases in such a case. The values of KSVs for HSA-ceftazidime interaction at various temperatures are given in Table 1.

The binding of ceftazidime with bovine serum albumin was found to be slightly stronger as compared to HSA, whereas lysozyme showed a weak binding with the former. Compared with the binding of HSA with other substances, such as indomethacin, safranal, and cuminaldehyde, these substances interacted more strongly with the former as compared to ceftazidime, whereas the binding of gemcitabine and cuminol was weaker [25,28\u201330]. Temperature rise resulted into the increase in the values of both Kb as well as n.

Due to its large structure, HSA has several binding sites, among which the two most common binding sites are the drug binding site 1 (DS1) or Sudlow\u2019s site 1 and drug binding site 2 (DS2) or Sudlow\u2019s site 2 [32,33]. DS1 is located in subdomain IIA, while DS2 is located in subdomain IIIA. There are several molecules that have the specific affinities towards these binding sites; for instance, warfarin binds strongly at DS1 and ibuprofen binds at DS2 [12]. There is another binding site within HSA, which is also known as fatty acid binding site 1, located in subdomain IB, which has a precise affinity for hemin [12]. Therefore, these molecules could be considered as the specific site markers for these sites and can be used to see the competitive binding between the molecule under consideration. The respective corrected fluorescence quenching spectra of HSA, complexed with warfarin, ibuprofen, and hemin, in the absence and presence of ceftazidime, are given in Figure 6A\u2013C whereas the observed spectra are shown in the supporting info as Figures S3\u2013S5. The corresponding quenching and binding plots are given in Figure 7A,B and the calculated values of quenching and binding constants are shown in Table 2. While ibuprofen does not affect both KSV as well as Kb, these parameters decreased considerably in the presence of warfarin and even more with hemin. Thus, it can be understood that the binding site of ceftazidime within HSA is located either in subdomain IB or subdomain IIA, with a greater possibility within the former because the binding was least in that case. To obtain more understanding on the binding site, we performed computational studies using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, which will be described in the next sub-sections.\nFig re 5.

This type of behavior of partial unfolding was also found in the case of ceftazidime interaction with bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, as well as in the case of cefoperazone binding with serum albumin [16,17,24]."

            "text": "HSA is a large globular protein with an atomic mass around 65 kDa, which is divided into three domains characterized as domain 1, domain 2, and domain 3, and each domain is, further, divided into two subdomains labeled as A and B. Due to its large structure, HSA has several binding sites, among which the two most common binding sites are the drug binding site 1 (DS1) or Sudlow\u2019s site 1 and drug binding site 2 (DS2) or Sudlow\u2019s site 2 [32,33]. DS1 is located in subdomain IIA, while DS2 is located in subdomain IIIA. There are several molecules that have the specific affinities towards these binding sites; for instance, warfarin binds strongly at DS1 and ibuprofen binds at DS2 [12]. There is another binding site within HSA, which is also known as fatty acid binding site 1, located in subdomain IB, which has a precise affinity for hemin [12]. Therefore, these molecules could be considered as the specific site markers for these sites and can be used to see the competitive binding between the molecule under consideration. The respective corrected fluorescence quenching spectra of HSA, complexed with warfarin, ibuprofen, and hemin, in the absence and presence of ceftazidime, are given in Figure 6A\u2013C whereas the observed spectra are shown in the supporting info as Figures S3\u2013S5. The corresponding quenching and binding plots are given in Figure 7A,B and the calculated values of quenching and binding constants are shown in Table 2. While ibuprofen does not affect both KSV as well as Kb, these parameters decreased considerably in the presence of warfarin and even more with hemin. Thus, it can be understoo that the binding site of ceftazidime withi HSA is located either in subdomai IB or subdomain IIA, with a greater possibility within the f rm r because the inding was least in that case. To obt in more understanding o t binding site, w performed comput tio al studies using molecula docking molecular dynamic simulations, which will be described in the ext sub-sections.\nInt. J. Mol.

The results from DSSP show that the protein primarily consists of alpha helices (mainly alpha class) and loops, which remains consistent throughout the simulation for all complexes (Table 5). It is observed that no considerable changes occur in the secondary structure of HSA upon binding either of the ligands, which is in accordance with far-UV CD results. To better visualize the regions of flexibility in the structure of HSA, we additionally performed B-factors analysis on all systems where it can be observed that unbound HSA does not have much flexibility, which increases upon ligand binding (Figure 13). Most of the flexibility is limited to domains I and III of the protein. The interaction between the ligand molecules and protein receptors provides insights into the extent of binding, which is analyzed via hydrogen bonds observed throughout the simulation. Paracetamol, on average, maintains only one hydrogen bond throughout the simulation; meanwhile, ceftazidime maintains an average of two hydrogen bonds. In the paracetamol and ceftazidime complex with HSA, paracetamol does not form a considerable hydrogen bond on average, yet only shows dispersed bonds at different time points. On the contrary, ceftazidime shows a high number of hydrogen bonds in the first 15 ns, upon which they decrease while maintaining 2 hydrogen bonds on average during the simulation. The principal component analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories applies the multivariate dimensionality reduction technique to identify essential or biologically relevant motions observed throughout the simulation based on the calculations of eigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues. These eigenvectors or principal components are subsequently projected onto an essential subspace where each point represents a distinct confirmation of the protein (Figure 14A). The dispersion of these states or confirmations on the essential subspace indicates the variance in different states, which can also be empirically studied by the trace of covariance matrix (tr(C)) value. The native protein displays a tr(C) value of 390.54 nm2 with dispersed confirmations on the essential subspace, which indicates a higher intrinsic mobility of HSA. The paracetamol\u2013HSA complex also displays a dispersed cluster of confirmations with tr(C) values similar to that of the native protein,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14811 14 of 18\n390.521 nm2. The HSA complex with ceftazidime displays a decrease in the mobility of HSA, which is indicated by the tr(C) value of 338.86 nm2 and a more concerted distribution of states in the essential subspace. A similar result as the ceftazidime complex is observed for the paracetamol\u2013ceftazidime HSA complex, where a slightly increased value of tr(C), 374.59 nm2, indicates that paracetamol decreases the stability of the complex and introduces perturbations in the confirmations. Next, PCA motions were visualized using the porcupine analysis, which displays motions as spikes. The directionality and the length of the spike represent the magnitude of the motion. The unbound HSA system shows PCA motions dispersed throughout the protein, while the ligand bound complexes display motions limited to domains I and III. The Paracetamol HSA complex displays dominant motions throughout the protein while the ceftazidime\u2013HSA complex shows decreased motions throughout the protein. The paracetamol\u2013ceftazidime-HSA complex shows a significant increase in PCA motions of domains I and III contributing to the instability in the complex (Figure S11). To understand the thermodynamic components of the confirmations observed in PCA, free energy landscape (FEL) plots were plotted and analyzed. The FEL plots define several energy basins, which are contoured as red, representing the highest energy states, with intermediate states as yellow followed by green, and ultimately, the lowest energy states are represented with blue followed by purple. In the FEL plot for native protein (Figure 14B), several energy minima can be observed, indicating the protein molecule\u2019s inability to attain a low energy state; similar results are also observed for the paracetamol HSA complex (Figure 14C). The ceftazidime\u2013HSA complex shows a concerted energy minimum in the plot, which indicates that upon ligand binding, the complex is able to attain a defined minimum energy state, indicating the stability of the confirmations in the minima (Figure 14D). Similarly, the paracetamol\u2013ceftazidime\u2013HSA complex is also able to attain a local minimum indicative of complex stability (Figure 14E).\nTable 5.

It is observ d that no considerable changes occur in the secondary structure of HSA upo binding either of the ligands, which is in accordance with far-UV CD result . To better visualize the regions of flexibility in the structure of HSA, we addi onally perf rmed B-factors nalysis on all systems w ere it can be observed that u bound HSA does\not have much flexibility, which incr ases upon lig d binding (Figure 13). Most of the flexibility is limited to domains I and III of the protein. The interaction betwe n the ligand molecules and protein receptors provides insights into the extent of binding, which is analyzed via hydrogen bonds observed throughout the simulation. Paracetamol, on average, maintains only one hydrogen bond throughout the simulation; meanwhile, ceftazidime maintains an average of two hydrogen bonds. In the paracetamol and ceftazidime complex with HSA, paraceta ol does not form a considerable hydrogen bond on average, yet\nonly shows dispersed bonds at different time points. On the contrary, ceftazidime shows\na high number of hydrogen bonds in the first 15 ns, upon which they decrease while maintaining 2 hydrogen bo s on average during the simulation.\nTable 5.

Ceftazidime displays an average binding free energy of \u221216.48 \u00b1 6.95 kcal/mol, while the values vary significantly during the simulation, as displayed in Figure 15. During 35\u201360 ns of the simulation, ceftazidime shows poor binding affinity values going into positive values at some time points, which leads to an increase in the standard deviation observed in the average free energy value. This result can be attributed to the collisional quenching observed during fluorescence studies, which could indicate that while the interaction of ceftazidime with HSA is transient, the complex formed between the two is, however, stable as shown in the FEL plots. Next, paracetamol alone with HSA displays poor values for binding free energy, and the average value calculated is \u22125.34 \u00b1 2.92 kcal/mol. Next, in the paracetamol\u2013 ceftazidime\u2013HSA complex, paracetamol displays similar trends even at a different site, indicating the poor interaction ability of paracetamol with HSA. However, it is found that the interaction of paracetamol near the ceftazidime binding site causes a disruption between ceftazidime and HSA. A decrease in the binding free energy value is observed in ceftazidime (\u221213.68 \u00b1 5.15 kcal/mol) when paracetamol is introduced to the complex, which is a result similar to that observed by the competitive binding site assay.\nInt.

            "text": "The detailed study of the interaction of human serum albumin (HSA) with a popular antibiotic drug, ceftazidime, was performed using several spectroscopic techniques along with in silico approaches. Because of the very large probability of coexistence of ceftazidime with a popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, paracetamol, the effect of the latter was also seen on the interaction. Ceftazidime interacted with HSA through a dynamic quenching mechanism with approximately a 1:1 binding ratio. The preferred binding site of ceftazidime within HSA was located in subdomain IB and the interaction led to the partial\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14811 17 of 18\nunfolding of HSA. Small concentrations of paracetamol did not influence the binding of HSA with ceftazidime, although, higher concentrations decreased the binding significantly. The major forces involved in the binding were hydrophobic forces.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms241914811/s1.
