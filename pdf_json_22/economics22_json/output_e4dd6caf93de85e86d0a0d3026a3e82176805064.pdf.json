    "abstractText": "Since markets are undergoing severe turbulent economic periods, this study investigates the information transmission of energy stock markets of five regions including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Pacific where we differentiated the regional energy markets based on their developing and developed state of economy. We employed time\u2013frequency domain from Jan 1995 to May 2021 and found that energy stocks of developed regions are highly connected. The energy markets of North America, South America, and Europe are the net transmitters of spillovers, whereas the Asian and Pacific energy markets are the net receivers of spillovers. The results also reveal that the connectedness of regional energy markets is time and frequency dependent. Regional energy stocks were highly connected following the Asian financial crisis (AFC), global financial crisis (GFC), European debt crisis (EDC), shale oil revolution (SOR), and COVID-19 pandemic. Time-dependent results reveal that high spillovers formed during stress periods and frequency domain show the higher connectedness of regional energy stock markets in the short run followed by an extreme economic condition. These results have significant implications for policymakers, regulators, investors, and regional controlling bodies to adopt effective strategies during short run to avoid economic downturns and information distortions.",

It is critical to\nunderstand the information transmission mechanism in the regional energy stock market as it helps the investors, hedge funds, and insurance companies in making investment and hedging decisions (Hasan et\u00a0al.\u00a02021; Naeem et\u00a0al.\u00a02021a, b; Dagar et\u00a0al.\u00a02021).

Against such a backdrop, we examine the information transmission between the regional energy stock markets by using the time\u2013frequency domain provided by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barun\u00edk and K\u0159ehl\u00edk (2018).\nThe energy markets across the globe are interconnected as the shocks in the oil market substantially increase the risk in the natural gas and other energy markets (Shen et\u00a0al.\u00a02018). The regional, geographical, and political differences make it worthwhile to study the regional connectedness of the energy market (Hasan et\u00a0al.\u00a02021). Many studies have investigated the volatility spillover between the energy, stock, bond, cryptocurrency, crude oil, and commodity market including the interdependence structure between these markets (Akram et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Ferrer et\u00a0al.\u00a02018; Naeem et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Tiwari et\u00a0al.\u00a02020). For example, it is believed that the energy transmission across the adjacent countries is faster than the non-adjacent countries and it is expected that the energy connectedness in the regional electricity markets is higher in the closer vicinities. Similar findings are obtained by Bunn and Gianfreda (2010), de Menezes and Houllier (2015), and Xiao et\u00a0al. (2019) by examining the risk transmission in the regional energy market of Europe. Xiao et\u00a0al. (2019) concludes that European energy market experienced relatively high connectedness and it is easy for the regulators to identify the market with high risk of system instability. The findings obtained by de Menezes and Houllier (2015) suggest that the German market is less integrated with the adjacent markets. In contrast, the geographical and political relations are rather complex in Asian market and difficult to link the cross-border energy connectedness. For measuring the connectedness in the Asian market, it cannot be grasped by considering member countries in isolation (Cui et\u00a0al., 2021; Singh et\u00a0al.\u00a02019). On the other hand, the Australian electricity markets share their geographical locations and are highly connected within a particular region due to physical interconnectors (Apergis et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Han et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Simshauser and Tiernan\u00a02019). The present study aims to examine the dynamic information transmission between the regional energy stock markets. In particular, we make an attempt to address the following issues. Can the information in the European energy market help to predict the risk in the Asian energy market or any other regional energy market? Does the information interdependence structure changes over time? Is the heterogeneity present in one market representative of the other regional markets?\nSince markets are undergoing severe challenges posed by information transmission, the current study is motivated to examine the risk connectedness of energy stock markets of five regions including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Pacific. For analysis purpose, we first\nconstruct the test statistic using the time\u2013frequency domain to examine the information transmission among the regional energy markets. More specifically, we used the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barun\u00edk and Krehlik (2018) approach to show the time-varying connectedness between the regional energy markets. Time\u2013frequency domain in the energy market is important because it helps the investors in devising the investment strategies, trading tools, and approaches (Caporin et\u00a0al.\u00a02021; Kang et\u00a0al.\u00a02019; Naeem et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Murshed et\u00a0al.\u00a02021a, b; Rehman et\u00a0al.\u00a02021). The adopted method proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) in combination with the Barun\u00edk and K\u0159ehl\u00edk (2018) offers several advantages over the traditional methods. While Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) approach focuses only on the time domain, the approach developed by Barun\u00edk and K\u0159ehl\u00edk (2018) offers the information on degree and direction of spillover in the frequency domain. This approach helps to disintegrate the overall connectedness into smaller frequencies to make it possible and know the contribution of the small frequencies in the overall connectedness of a system. It also directly models the quantile and links it to the market risk, avoiding the indirect risk measure using time-varying mean and variance (Hasan et\u00a0al.\u00a02021; Tiwari et\u00a0al.\u00a02020; Zakari et\u00a0al.\u00a02021, 2022; Khan et\u00a0al.\u00a02021; Islam et\u00a0al.\u00a02021). Finally, the time\u2013frequency connectedness uses very little distributional assumption on the underlying data generation process.\nBuidling on these arguments, the current study contributes to the existing literature in many ways. First, the study takes energy stock markets of five regions, namely, North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Pacific. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which uses the data of energy companies and their stocks belonging to five regions. Second, we utilized the time-and-frequency connectedness analysis to observe whether markets are transmitting/receiving spillovers over the period of time. Third, DY[12] and BK[18] approaches are appealing in examining the interconnectedness of energy markets as the former segregates the net risk transmission/reception while the latter segregates the short- and long-run spillovers. Fourth, we found that energy markets of developed regions are highly connected among each other and transmit spillovers whereas developing regions are receiving spillovers. Hence, we compared the economic orientation of these regions and provided unique insights. Fifth, our sub-sample analysis provided robust results with full sample period indicating higher connectedness during the periods of financial distress. Finally, we framed various implications for policymakers, regulation bodies, investors, and portfolio managers.\nThe findings of the study reveal that North American (NAMR) and South American (SAMR) energy stock markets are the net transmitters of information spillovers. Europe (EURO) transmitted moderate spillovers whereas\nAsia (ASIA) and Pacific (PACF) are the net recipients of information spillovers. Moreover, the connectedness of energy markets was high during stress periods where global economic fragility, uncertainty, and world-wide closure of business operations resulted in the formation of higher spillovers. The frequency dependent analysis showed that regional energy markets showed significant spikes in the short run whereas connectedness becomes lower in the long run. Followed by the uncertainties in the global working conditions and economic distress, the energy markets of five regions showed varying patterns of connectedness. Additionally, the sub-sample analysis also confirmed that NAMR is the net transmitter of information spillovers followed by SAMR and EURO. And, ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of the information spillovers.\nThe remaining study proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide the review of relevant literature related to the regional connectedness of energy markets. In \u201cMethodology,\u201d we provide the methodology used for the study and \u201cEmpirical results\u201d presents the empirical analysis and findings of the study. Finally, in \u201cConclusion,\u201d we conclude with several policy and regulatory implications."

(2021) examined the time\u2013frequency connectedness between the Asian electricity markets by using the Barun\u00edk and K\u0159ehl\u00edk (2018) and Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Macroeconomic factors of the energy market such as geographical location, supply, and demand play an important role in information transmission and the connectedness of the regional energy markets (Singh et\u00a0al.\u00a02019; Muhammad and Khan\u00a02021; Karim and Naeem\u00a02021). Despite the economic and political differences between the countries in Asian region, a great potential for the connectedness of energy sector in the Asian region exists (Oseni and Pollitt\u00a02016). Several efforts have been made to connect the energy sector in the Asia region in the last couple of decades and some advancements have also been made in this regard (Bhattacharyay\u00a02010). Under the CAREC program strategy, the TAPI gas pipeline project was approved to help and improve the regional energy trade between the TAPI countries (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India). The expansion of central Asian power system is intended to enhance the regional energy trade and connectedness of new energy markets such as Afghanistan and Turkmenistan with the central Asian markets (Zobaa and Lee\u00a02006). These connectivity initiatives highlight towards the fact\nthat, although the regional trade practices among the Asian nations have been low, the right steps are being undertaken to strengthen the regional energy connectedness among the Asian nations (Hasan et\u00a0al.\u00a02021).\nMany scholars have focussed on the network connectedness of the energy market in Europe (Geng et\u00a0al.\u00a02021; Xiao et\u00a0al.\u00a02019). The energy market has become increasingly integrated in Europe due to the market coupling and interconnection capacity and further integration plan is expected in the early 2020s (Lockwood et\u00a0al.\u00a02017). The UK\u2019s exit strategy from European Union will have a long-term impact on the energy market integration and information transmission in the European region (Lockwood et\u00a0al.\u00a02017; Lowe\u00a0 2017; Karim et\u00a0 al.\u00a0 2021a, b). Lin and Li (2015) applied VAC-MGARCH approach to study the spillover effects across natural gas and concluded that oil and natural gas markets are co-integrated across the European market within the first and second moments. The information transmission is expected to have multiple possible impact on the energy integration including the availability and cost of finance, energy market and security of supply, nuclear power, and supply chain of all energy markets across Europe and energy efficiency policy (Egan\u00a02019; Mayer et\u00a0al.\u00a02019).\nThe rest of the studies are summarized in Appendix\u00a01 (Table\u00a03)."

(2019), Naeem et\u00a0al. (2020), Caporin et\u00a0al. (2021), and Shahzad et\u00a0al. (2021), our study also used both time and frequency domains. The use of time\u2013frequency domains simultaneously offers two benefits. First, the directional spillovers are obtained, exhibited by a network diagram. Second, the short- and long-run components can be segregated following the frequency domain."

The data have been sourced from DataStream of the relevant energy sectors. Table\u00a02 illustrates the descriptive statistics of markets under study where highest average values are reflected by SAMR, PACF, and NAMR followed by EURO. ASIA yield the least average returns for the complete sample period. The highest variability of average returns is indicated by SAMR followed by NAMR while EURO and PACF depicted comparable exposure to risk. Finally, ASIA exhibited lowest variability in the average returns among the rest of the regional energy sectors. The Jarque\u2013Bera test of normality indicates that values are substantially higher and there is abnormality in the average returns.\nNetwork connectedness of\u00a0regional energy markets\nThis study attempts to investigate the information transmission of five regional energy markets, namely, North\nAmerican region (NAMR), South American region (SAMR), European region (EURO), Asian region, (ASIA), and Pacific region (PACF). The information transmission has been estimated through time and frequency dependence structure provided by Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik-Krehlik (2018) approaches respectively. Figure\u00a01 presents the network connectedness of five regions based on Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) method, where two distinct clusters are formed. The first cluster reveals connectedness between NAMR, SAMR, and EURO regions where markets are highly connected with each other and transmit spillovers to other markets. We argue that NAMR, SAMR, and EURO are developed regions and due to strong economic and financial stability, these regions are transmitting spillovers to developing regions. Accordingly, PACF and ASIA form the other cluster and are highly connected with each other. The network diagram displays NAMR and SAMR which are the net transmitters of spillovers whereas ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of spillovers. The connectedness among the regional energy markets is evident for the regions which are adjacently located with each other. The geographical proximity of these markets makes the information transmission feasible and easily accessible resulting in the higher connectedness of the energy regions. The findings are in line with the arguments of Han et\u00a0al. (2020), Manner et\u00a0al. (2019), and Yan and Truck (2020) who also reported similar findings claiming higher connectedness of markets of closer vicinities. Meanwhile, we also segregate the regions of energy stock markets based on their developed and developing economic stature.\nFigure\u00a02 illustrates the connectedness of regional energy markets in the short and long run following Barunik-Krehlik (2018) approach. Figure\u00a02a presents the spillovers of information transmission in the short run which reiterate the formation of two main clusters. The information spillovers are higher among NAMR, SAMR, and EURO in the short run. And, these regions show higher connectedness in the short run and are net transmitters of information spillovers. On the other hand, PACF and ASIA regions form second cluster of connectedness and are the net recipients of information spillovers. Meanwhile, the short-run analysis points to the crisis periods where majority of the regional markets are highly connected following the uncertain economic downfall\nand disruptions in the information transmission. For this reason, our findings corroborate Balli et\u00a0al. (2019) who argue that various commodities, like energy commodities, form high spillovers in the short run following a particular crisis.\nCorrespondingly, Fig.\u00a02b presents the connectedness of regional energy markets in the long run which illustrates that NAMR and SAMR are transmitting spillovers to other energy regions. EURO region is transmitting moderate spillovers to PACF and ASIA regions. Meanwhile, PACF and ASIA are the net recipients of information spillovers in the long run. The nodes on the regional energy markets\n(highlighted with red) determine the net transmitting and net receiving capacity of spillovers. In this way, it is suggested that the regional energy markets which are sharing their geographies are highly connected to each other whereas the energy markets which are located at distant places tend to show disconnection with other energy regions. The other significant takeaway of the analysis reveals that the energy regions of developed economies are highly connected with each other and transmit information spillovers to the energy regions of developing economies. Thus, regional energy markets of developed economies are net transmitters of spillovers whereas energy markets of developing economies are net recipients of spillovers."

            "text": "Figure\u00a0 3 presents the time-varying connectedness of regional energy markets based on Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik-Krehlik (2018) models. The time-varying connectedness of regional energy markets suggests that\nconnectedness among the markets is time-varying and patterns of spillovers vary based on different time periods. Figure\u00a03a presents the time-varying connectedness based on DY[12] model with significant spikes and troughs highlighting various time-periods of economic uncertainty and stress. The first spike is observed during Asian financial crisis (1997\u20131998) where regional energy markets showed higher connectedness as the crisis period resulted in information asymmetry and several markets shared information to overcome the drastic impact of the crisis. Hence, the graph depicts high spillovers during Asian financial crisis period. Soon after the crisis, markets tend to normalize and regained their normal working conditions illustrating the decline in the connectedness of the markets in the graph. Regional energy markets revealed spikes during global financial crisis (GFC) for the period 2007\u20132008 where high spillovers were formed among the markets. Reiterating, the energy markets of five regions were highly connected during the period of economic fragility. Concurrently, markets revealed high spillovers during 2010\u20132012 indicating the European debt crisis (EDC) where markets were significantly influenced by the anti-inflation policy from the European Central Bank (Blundell-Wignall\u00a02012). Similarly, a spike during 2014\u20132016 points to the shale oil crisis where US oil markets suffered crisis during the shale oil revolution (SOR). The higher connectedness among regional energy markets revealed that asymmetrical information patterns and crisis led the markets to form high spillovers. Correspondingly, the spike during 2019\u20132020 highlights the current COVID-19 pandemic which significantly influenced the economic status around the globe. The higher connectedness of regional energy markets shows that spillovers were high during the crisis period and economic stress. Our findings are in line with Greenwood-Nimmo et\u00a0al. (2016) and Sehgal et\u00a0al. (2017) arguing that spillovers get intense during the period of economic severity and when markets are stabilized, the connectedness becomes lower.\nFigure\u00a03b reveals frequency dependent connectedness of regional energy markets following the model of Barunik-Krehlik (2018) where short run is highlighted with orange and long run is presented by yellow. Similar to Fig.\u00a03a, the graph shows substantial spikes and troughs. The initial spike in the short-run points towards Asian financial crisis (1997\u20131998) where energy markets of five regions showed higher connectedness followed by a market-wide contagion. As the aftermaths of the shock disappeared, markets started to stabilize and connectedness\na)\nb)\nc)\n\u25b8\nbecomes lower. The spike during 2006\u20132008 shows higher spillovers during global financial crisis where majority of the financial markets collapsed. Soon after GFC, markets showed higher connectedness during 2010\u20132012 pointing to the European debt crisis (EDC) where markets formed high spillovers revealing economic uncertainty and fragility. Correspondingly, the shale oil crisis during 2014\u20132016 depicted a spike in the graph where energy markets are significantly impacted by the shale oil revolution. The final spike in the graph highlights the ongoing pandemic condition generated due to COVID-19 signifying higher connectedness of regional energy markets where emergency situation of global lockdowns and closure of business operations has formed high spillovers of energy markets. The spikes in the short run mainly reveal that frequency connectedness of regional energy markets is affected in the short run and lasts for a shorter period of time (Londono\u00a02019). Conversely, the connectedness of regional energy markets in the long run suggests that markets remain disconnected in the long run as it highlights normal market and economic conditions (Bouri et\u00a0al.\u00a02020)."

            "text": "Figure\u00a04 illustrates sub-sample analysis of regional energy markets using Diebold-Yilmaz (2012) approach for three crisis periods, namely, global financial crisis (GFC), shale oil revolution (SOR), and COVID-19 crisis (COV). The connectedness among the regional energy markets shows similar patterns in all of the crisis periods where NAMR, SAMR, and EURO are net transmitters of the spillovers and show higher connectedness whereas ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of the information spillovers and show lower connectedness with other energy markets. Our findings recall the arguments of Hasan et\u00a0al. (2021) on connectedness among Asian electricity markets, who reported that the connectedness of energy markets becomes high during a crisis period. Moreover, the regional markets of developed economies are net transmitters and vice versa.\nFigure\u00a05 illustrates sub-sample analysis using BarunikKrehlik (2018) approach for three crises periods in the short run. Figure\u00a05a, b, and c show that regional energy markets formed moderate spillovers and there is moderate connectedness among the regional energy markets. However, NAMR, SAMR, and EURO are marked as the net transmitters of information spillovers whereas ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of spillovers. Given the short-run period, the regional energy markets of closer borders tend to show\nb)\nc)\nhigher connectedness during the crisis periods. In line with various studies of connectedness (Naeem et\u00a0al.\u00a02021a, b; Karim and Naeem\u00a02021; Karim et\u00a0al. 2022a, b,\u00a0c), we report that spillovers are fashioned based on the development of the regional economic and financial power. Thus, markets are connected when there are distressed times and are weakly connected during stable times.\nFigure\u00a06 gives the analysis of sub-sample using BarunikKrehlik (2018) model in the long run for three significant crises periods, i.e., GFC, SOR, and COV. For the results in each sub-sample, Fig.\u00a06a, b, and c reveal higher connectedness of regional energy markets where NAMR is the net transmitter of spillovers followed by SAMR and EURO. Contrarily, ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of spillovers in the long run for each sub-sample. Our findings recall the studies of Naeem et\u00a0al. (2021b), Elsayed et\u00a0al. (2020), Le et\u00a0al. (2021), and Salisu and Vo (2020), and it is asserted that the crisis period, driven by the market sentiment of fear, spreads across the globe that resulted in higher spillovers among the energy markets.\nOverall, our findings illustrate that information transmission among the regional energy markets showed spillovers differentiated into developed regions\u2019 energy markets and developing regions. Notably, the connectedness among the markets was higher during the periods of economic stress and fragility followed by uncertain global financial condition and unstable business operations."

            "text": "This research presented the information transmission of regional energy markets using the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Barunik and Krehlik (2018) models of time-and-frequency-dependent structures. The time-based connectedness of five regional energy markets showed NAMR and SAMR as the net transmitters of information spillovers. EURO transmitted moderate spillovers whereas ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of information spillovers. We segregated the spillovers based on the financial and economic strength of five regions. We documented that developed regions (NAMR, SAMR, and EURO) are transmitting spillovers while developing regions (ASIA and PACF) are receiving spillovers. Moreover, the connectedness of energy markets was high during stress periods where global economic fragility, uncertainty, and world-wide closure of business operations resulted in the formation of higher spillovers. The frequency-dependent\nb)\nc)\nanalysis showed that regional energy markets experienced significant spikes in the short run whereas connectedness becomes lower in the long run. Followed by the uncertainties in the global working conditions and economic distress, the energy markets of five regions showed varying patterns of connectedness. Additionally, the sub-sample analysis also confirmed that NAMR is the net transmitter of information spillovers followed by SAMR and EURO. And, ASIA and PACF are the net recipients of the information spillovers.\nOur findings draw significant implications for policymakers, investors, financial institutions, financial markets, regulatory bodies, and global market players. Policymakers can evaluate their policies and reformulate certain strategies to avoid the drastic effects of crises coming in their way of progress and development. Meanwhile, policymakers of each region can redevelop their policies pertaining to energy stock markets and encourage their affiliates to invest in the stocks of energy companies as they are reportedly performing well than the developing regions. Investors can assess their risk portfolios by adding a blend of commodities and financial instruments to diversify their risks in the face of economic downfall. Moreover, for\ninvestors, we recommend investing in the energy stocks of developing regions as they are diversifiers among developed energy stock markets. Hence, drawing useful strategies from the study can help the investors to mitigate their risk during turbulent time periods. Regulatory bodies can redevelop their strategies to provide sufficient safety to the investments of the investors particularly during crisis times. In this way, crisis periods provide substantial insights for financial markets to consider those financial instruments and commodities which provide shelter to their mainstream investments. As future research avenues, the study recommends to include various other regions and their energy stock markets to provide a comprehensive analysis on portfolio diversification and risk assessment. Following this, our study is of particular importance to upcoming researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers to relish the findings of the study in a meaningful way.\nAppendix\u00a01\nSee Table\u00a03\nAppendix\u00a02\nSee Fig.\u00a07\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank the organizers and participants of International Conference on Economics, Energy and Environment-ICEEE\u20192021 for their helpful comments that improved the quality of our manuscript.\nAuthor contribution Sitara Karim: writing \u2014 review & editing, methodology, software, formal analysis, original draft.\nMuhammad Abubakr Naeem: conceptualization, data curation; methodology, software, visualization, writing \u2014 review & editing.\nMustafa Raza Rabbani: writing \u2014 review & editing, original draft.
