Miers (Bignoniaceae), a simple high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) method based on mangiferin as an internal standard to quantify verbascoside, and the verbascoside acute oral toxicity and antileishmanial activity. HPLC\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry\u2013DAD (HPLC\u2013HRMS\u2013DAD) analyses of the crude ethanol S. perforatum leaf extracts (CE-1 and CE-2) revealed that verbascoside was the major constituent in both extracts. CE-1 was purified, and verbascoside and casticin, among other compounds, were isolated. The developed HPLC-DAD method was validated and met the required standards. Investigation of the CE-2 acute toxicity indicated a lethal dose (LD50) greater than 2,000 mg/kg of body weight. Both CE-1 and CE-2 exhibited antileishmanial activity. The isolated compounds, verbascoside and casticin, also displayed antileishmanial activity with effective concentrations (IC50) of 6.23 and 24.20 \u00b5M against promastigote forms and 3.71 and 18.97 \u00b5M against amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis, respectively, but they were not cytotoxic to J774A.1 macrophages. Scanning electron microscopy of the L. amazonensis promastigotes showed that the parasites became more rounded and that their plasma membrane was altered in the presence of verbascoside. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that vacuoles emerged, lipids accumulated, kinetoplast size increased, and interstitial extravasation occurred in L. amazonensis promastigotes exposed to verbascoside. These findings suggest that S. perforatum is a promising candidate for further in vivo investigations against L. amazonensis.\nKEYWORDS\nantileishmanial, acute toxicity, Stizophyllum perforatum, validation, verbascoside HPLC method, antileishmanial activity\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Stizophyllum perforatum (Cham.) Miers (Bignoniaceae), synonyms Bignonia perforata Cham. and Bignonia physaloides Cham., is a liana that grows in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Guyana, and Brazil. The genus Stizophyllum comprises only three species, S. perforatum, Stizophyllum inaequilaterum, and Stizophyllum riparium, which are morphologically similar and occur in wet to dry forests and disturbed vegetation from Mexico to southern Brazil. Interestingly, Stizophyllum species are pioneers and are typically found in disturbed areas, forest margins, and secondary vegetation (Lohmann and Taylor, 2014; Beyer et al., 2017). Additionally, the crude leaf extract obtained from S. perforatum has been shown to exhibit trypanocidal activity (Silva et al., 2014).\nTriterpenes and pregnane derivatives with cytotoxic action against P-388 lymphocytic leukemia have been isolated from S. riparium whole plant extract (Duh et al., 1987; Duh et al., 1991). In Peru and Panama, S. riparium is used as folk medicine to treat snakebites (Valadeau et al., 2010) and to dilate atrophied urethras in cases of anuria (Gupta et al., 1993). However, no information regarding the isolation of compounds from S. perforatum or its antileishmanial activity has been published.\nThe occurrence of phenylethanoid glycosides in Bignoniaceae species is well documented (Alipieva et al., 2014; Alvarenga et al., 2015; Bertanha et al., 2020). In this study, we isolated verbascoside, a phenylethanoid glycoside known for its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antineoplastic, wound-healing, neuroprotective, and antileishmanial properties, from S. perforatum (Alipieva et al., 2014; Maquiaveli et al., 2016a; Maquiaveli et al., 2017).\nTo the best of our knowledge, no internal standard-based highperformance liquid chromatography\u2013diode array detection (HPLCDAD) method is available for quantitatively determining verbascoside in S. perforatum. Here, we validated such a method by following the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency regulations. We also investigated the antileishmanial activity of verbascoside against Leishmania amazonensis, as well as the changes that verbascoside elicits in L. amazonensis promastigotes. Finally, we assessed toxicological aspects by evaluating acute oral toxicity."

Sample volumes of 20 \u00b5L were injected at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min; the oven temperature was 40\u00b0C. The column was equilibrated at 2% B for 15 min. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded from 200 to 600 nm, and the chromatograms were monitored at l = 330 nm. The method was validated by following the guidelines of the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and involved assessing several parameters, including selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, and precision (ANVISA, 2017). Selectivity was confirmed using a diode array detector, which allowed the UV-Vis spectra to be obtained and peak purity to be assessed during analyses of the crude ethanol S. perforatum leaf extracts. This also helped to verify the identity of the standard by comparing its retention time with the verbascoside standard retention time.

CE-2 (1.5 mg in 1 mL of methanol) was spiked with IS at 50, 10, or 3 mg/mL, which was followed by sonication. After 10 min, the solution was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5804 at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and transferred to a vial. Accuracy was evaluated by back-calculation and expressed as the percent deviation between the experimental amounts of IS and the amounts added at the three examined concentrations.

For this purpose, L. amazonensis promastigotes maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic (10,000 IU/mL penicillin and 10,000 mg/mL streptomycin) (Cultilab) were transferred to a 96-well plate (1 \u00d7\nfrontiersin.org\n106). The tested sample (CE-1, CE-2, HF, EAF, HMF, EAF-1, EAF2, EAF-3, EAF-4, 1, or 3) was initially added at 50 \u00b5g/mL or 50 \u00b5M. Subsequently, promising samples were further evaluated at concentrations ranging from 50 to 3.12 \u00b5M or 50 to 3.12 \u00b5g/mL. The L. amazonensis promastigote cultures were incubated in a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) incubator at 24\u00b0C for 24 h, and the antileishmanial activity was determined by counting the total number of live L. amazonensis promastigotes in a Neubauer chamber. The positive and negative controls consisted of amphotericin B (at concentrations ranging from 0.0027 to 1.56 mM) and RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively.\nThe antileishmanial activity was also assessed against L. amazonensis amastigotes; the method described by Oliveira et al. (2022) was followed. Briefly, a suspension of 2 \u00d7 105 J774.1 macrophages in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco\u00ae) was seeded on glass coverslips in a 24-well microplate and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 2 h. After incubation, the adherent macrophages were infected with L. amazonensis promastigotes at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well (10:1 ratio) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Non-internalized L. amazonensis promastigotes were washed, and the infected cultures were incubated with one of the tested samples at concentrations ranging from 3.12 to 50 \u00b5g/mL or 3.12 to 50 \u00b5M for 48 h. Amphotericin B (0.095 to 1.56 mM) and RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Next, coverslips were prepared and examined under an optical microscope (Nikon) by counting 200 macrophages to determine the number of L. amazonensis amastigotes within each infected cell. In both experiments, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed by following the protocols of Alvarenga et al. (2016) and Pereira et al. (2015) with some modifications. L. amazonensis promastigotes (1 \u00d7 106/mL) were incubated with 1 at 8.92 or 89.7 mM (EC50 and EC90), RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (negative control), or amphotericin B (positive control) at 24\u00b0C for 24 h. After incubation, L. amazonensis promastigotes were centrifuged and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.2) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was removed, and L. amazonensis promastigotes were washed twice with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and processed for TEM or SEM analyses. The samples were analyzed using a JEOL Model JEM100CXII transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) or a Joel JSM-5200 scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at the Multi-User Microscopy Laboratory of the Ribeir\u00e3o Preto Medical School."

At 50 \u00b5g/mL, the three resulting fractions showed activity against L. amazonensis. However, HF and EAF had stronger activity than HMF, so they were used in further purification steps. EAF was submitted to sequential re-fractionation on a Sephadex LH-20 column to isolate verbascoside (1). Subfractions 63 and 64 were then purified by preparative TLC to isolate penduletin (2) and casticin (3). Another EAF aliquot was processed by SPE to obtain four SPE subfractions (EAF-1, EAF-2, EAF-3, and EAF-4). Bioassays against L. amazonensis revealed strong activity for EAF-3, so it was purified by silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC to isolate casticin (3), penduletin 4\u2032-methyl ether (4), ursolic acid (5), and oleanolic acid (6). HF was purified on a silica gel column to give mixtures of stigmasterol (7) and b-sitosterol (8), as well as 5 and 6. HMF also exhibited antileishmanial activity, albeit lower. Nevertheless, it was purified by SPE to isolate 1 in fraction 2 after a preparative HPLC step.\nThe spectral data (Supplementary Material) of the compounds (Figure 1) were consistent with previously published data and allowed us to identify 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and the mixture of 7 and 8 (Wang et al., 1989; Goulart et al., 1993; Kanchanapoom et al., 2002; Lima et al., 2003; Citoglu et al., 2004; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2013; Sevindik et al., 2015)."

Among these compounds, only 5 had previously been isolated from S. riparium, a morphologically similar species (Duh et al., 1987; Beyer et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 1\u20134 and 6\u20138 in Stizophyllum.\nChromatographic fingerprinting of CE-1 and CE-2 showed some differences in their chemical composition, well established and influenced\nFrontiers in Plant Science 08\nby factors such as plant source, growth, harvest, season, and water availability (Chaves et al., 1997; Copaja et al., 2003; Soni et al., 2015; Gobbo-Neto et al., 2017; Prinsloo andNogemane, 2018; Sampaio andDa Costa, 2018; Gimenez et al., 2020). However, we also observed some similarities, including the peak at Rt of 11.7 min, which revealed that 1 is present in both CE-1 and CE-2. Thus, we selected 1 as the chemical marker for S. perforatum. Interestingly, 1 has also been described in other Bignoniaceae species, such as Cuspidaria pulchra and Xylophragma harleyi (Lima et al., 2003; Alvarenga et al., 2015).

Additionally, we compared the formulas obtained from the HPLC\u2013HRMS characterization with the formulas of previously described compounds, but we were unable to identify any of them. Nevertheless, we were able to identify 5 by NMR data after it was isolated.\nThe developed HPLC method is suitable for controlling the quality of herbal materials from S. perforatum, and according to\nFrontiers in Plant Science 10\nIndrayanto (2022), method validation in plant science is crucial for developing modern drugs from herbal medicines.\nOur results concerning the antipromastigote and antiamastigote activities of CE-1 and CE-2 are more promising than the results reported by Maquiaveli et al. (2016b), who isolated 1 and isoverbascoside from the n-butanol fraction of Stachytarpheta cayennensis, tested them against L. amazonensis promastigotes and\nFIGURE 4 Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images of Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes (24 h).

In addition to that, a previous study reported that the crude leaf extract obtained from S. perforatum exhibits trypanocidal activity with an EC50 of 20.2 \u00b5g/mL (Silva et al., 2014). Another study, which also isolated 5 from Ajuga laxmannii, showed that the crude methanol extract of this plant has EC50 of 30.1 \u00b5g/mL against Leishmania donovani axenic amastigotes (Atay et al., 2016). Here, we determined that the concentration of 1 in CE-1 and CE-2 is 3.51 \u00b1 0.20 and 3.78 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5g/mL, or 0.59% and 0.63% relative to the dry crude ethanol leaf extract, respectively. However, the concentrations of 1 in the plant extracts mentioned in the literature were not established.\nVerbascoside (1) has various biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, wound-healing, neuroprotective, and antileishmanial activity properties (Alipieva et al., 2014; Atay et al., 2016; Maquiaveli et al., 2016a; Maquiaveli et al., 2017). 1 has an EC50 of 19 mM against L. amazonensis promastigotes and is a competitive arginase inhibitor (Ki = 0.7 mM) (Maquiaveli et al., 2016a). Additionally, 1 inhibits L. amazonensis amastigotes (EC50 = 32 mM) by selectively inhibiting arginase, which reduces the protective oxidative mechanism of the parasite and impairs trypanothione synthesis. Arginase belongs to the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, which is important for parasite infectivity (Maquiaveli et al., 2017). Our results are more promising\u20141 has EC50 of 6.23 and 3.71 mM for L. amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively. The antileishmanial activity of 1 has also been established against L. donovani axenic amastigotes (8.7 \u00b5g/ mL) (Kirmizibekmez et al., 2004; Atay et al., 2016).\nFlavonols exhibit antileishmanial activity against L. donovani axenic amastigotes (Tasdemir et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2014). Quercetin has been evaluated against L. amazonensis-infected macrophages, and its IC50 is 3.4 mM (Fonseca-Silva et al., 2013). Regarding flavonols, quercetin is a mixed inhibitor of L. amazonensis arginase, whereas quercitrin and isoquercitrin are uncompetitive inhibitors of this enzyme (da Silva et al., 2012).\nTriterpenes, such as 5 and 6, isolated from the bioactive fractions, also present antileishmanial activity against L. amazonensis promastigotes, Leishmania major promastigotes, and intracellular L. amazonensis amastigotes to some extent (TorresSantos et al., 2004; Peixoto et al., 2011; Begum et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2015). According to Yamamoto et al. (2015), 5 presents IC50 of 6.2 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5g/mL against promastigotes, 6 is inactive, and 5 alters the ultrastructure in L. amazonensis promastigotes.\nThe presence of these compounds in CE-1 and CE-2 can contribute to antileishmanial activity. These findings are often considered to result from a synergistic or additive effect of the constituents (Caesar and Cech, 2019). Our results provide evidence of the antileishmanial activity induced by S. perforatum and additional evidence of the antileishmanial activity of 1 and 3. Further in vivo studies should be conducted to assess the antileishmanial activity of the S. perforatum crude extract against Leishmania."
