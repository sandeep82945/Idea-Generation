Investigation of Environmental Impact: Further studies could explore the environmental impact of heat-treated coal, particularly focusing on the reduction of sulfur content and its implications for air quality and acid rain prevention. This could involve detailed analysis of the gaseous emissions during the combustion of heat-treated coals, comparing the emissions from coals treated at different temperatures to assess the optimal conditions for minimizing harmful emissions.

Development of Advanced Coal Treatment Technologies: Building on the observed changes in coal's molecular structure with heat treatment, future research could focus on developing advanced coal treatment technologies. These could aim to enhance the desirable properties of coal, like increased carbon content and decreased sulfur content, through controlled heat treatment processes. This could include the design of new pyrolysis reactors that allow for precise control of temperature and atmosphere.

Coal Gasification and Liquefaction: Given the changes in the molecular structure of coal with heat treatment, there's an opportunity to investigate how these modifications affect coal's behavior in gasification and liquefaction processes. Research could aim to optimize these processes by selecting coals treated at specific temperatures to increase the efficiency of gasification and liquefaction, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable methods for producing synthetic fuels and chemicals from coal.

Study of Heat Treatment on Coal's Adsorption Properties: Another potential research avenue is the study of how heat treatment affects the adsorption properties of coal, especially for applications like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or water treatment. This could involve investigating the porosity, surface area, and functional group content of coals treated at different temperatures to determine their effectiveness in adsorbing gases or pollutants.

Application in Renewable Energy Systems: Finally, exploring the use of heat-treated coals in renewable energy systems, such as biomass co-firing or in the production of carbon electrodes for batteries or supercapacitors, could be a forward-looking research area. This would involve evaluating how modifications in the coal structure impact its combustion efficiency or electrochemical properties, contributing to the development of more sustainable energy storage and generation solutions.
