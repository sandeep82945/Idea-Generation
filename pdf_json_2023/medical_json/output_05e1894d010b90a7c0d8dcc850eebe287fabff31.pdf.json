    "abstractText": "One of the greatest challenges in the domain of emotional regulation is comprehending the functionality of strategies and their utilization in various social contexts. In this sense, this study analyzes differences in the use and efficacy of regulation strategies, particularly of interpersonal strategies like altruism, social support, negotiation, mediation, regulation, and rituals, in samples of workers (N = 687) and students (N = 959) from Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Spain, and Uruguay, and athletes (N =144) from Spain. Participants answered questions pertaining to measures of affect or emotional regulation (MARS and ERQ self-regulation scales and EROS heteroregulation), as well as questions of a wellbeing scale (PHI) and questions related to emotional creativity (ECI), humor styles (HSQ), and adjustment to stress. Athletes reported less emotional discharge, use of humor, and affection, and greater confrontation and use of rituals than students and workers. A congruent relationship was found between the use of functional strategies (like direct coping, distraction, reevaluation, and active physiological regulation) and adjustment to stress, well-being, and creativity. Seeking social support, negotiation, and, to an extent, altruism, confirmed their predicted adaptive character. Mediation and delegation did not confirm their predicted adaptive character. Rumination, social comparison, rituals, confrontation, and suppression were maladaptive for workers and students, but the first four strategies were functional for athletes, who display a higher self-control and a more team-oriented and competitive emotional culture. Finally, the results show that adaptive regulation strategies mediate the relationship between well-being and adjustment",

            "text": "Affect is defined as the subjective experience of the general emotional state, which can be positive/pleasant or negative/unpleasant [1]. Emotional episodes typically result in a mixture of emotions, while also reinforcing, creating, or relying on mood states [2]. Emotions shape individuals\u2019 subjectivity through the process of symbolic interaction between identity, norms, and social values [3], and influence the behaviors that can be observed in different social contexts. Despite emotions being conceived by researchers from very different perspectives, there appear to be some key similarities among experts [4]. First, emotions involve moderately related changes in domains such as subjective experience,\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6865. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20196865 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nbehavior, and physiological aspects. Second, they develop over time [5]. In this sense, the Process Model of Emotion Regulation proposed by [4] provides a framework for understanding how emotions are generated and regulated, and how different components of emotional responses interact with each other. According to this model, the sequence begins with the appraisal of a psychologically relevant situation. The appraisal process determines whether the situation is perceived as positive or negative, and whether it is relevant to the individual. Whether of one kind or another, these situations are e evaluated in terms of what they mean to the individual based on their goals [6]. Finally, the model suggests that emotions are important because of their relationship with prominent social beliefs [7] and ethical decisions [8,9]. Current research concludes that emotions and cognitive processes mutually influence each other and are co-determined by sociocultural processes [10\u201312]. In this sense, there is an important consensus that emotions are not just individual, internal experiences but are shaped by cultural norms, social contexts, and historical and political circumstances [13]."

            "text": "Emotional regulation is a process considered necessary for optimal personal and social adaptation [14]. Individuals who possess well-developed emotional competencies to regulate their affectivity report having more positive relationships with others, exhibit fewer antisocial behaviors, and are less prone to psychological disorders compared to those who exhibit lower levels or lack such competencies [15]. While affect regulation refers to the modification of moods, emotional regulation refers to individuals\u2019 capacity to modify components of their emotional experience. According to the Process Model of Emotion Regulation in [4], emotional regulation begins when a person chooses between possible situations based on their probable emotional impact. The model suggests that once an emotion is generated, it can be regulated through various cognitive and behavioral strategies which modify the appraisal, physiological arousal, and expression components of the emotional response. These strategies include the following: (1) the modification of the situation, which involves altering the situation to modify its emotional impact; (2) attentional deployment, which involves focusing attention on one aspect of the situation; (3) cognitive change, which involves modifying the meaning attributed to the situation, according to which the potential emotional meanings would lead to a new decision, resulting in the experience, behaviors, and physiological response tendencies that define the emotion; and, finally, (4) modulation of affective response refers to directly influencing the experience, behavior, or physiological components of the emotional response after the emotion has been generated."

            "heading": "2.1. Goals of Affect Regulation",
            "text": "Regulation is considered functional if adaptive goals are achieved [16]. Different motivations or goals for emotional regulation are important. First, arousal regulation (which increases when people are bored or decreases when they are upset) and, second, hedonic regulation, usually related to a decreased negative affect and improved positive affect, are two basic goals related to affect valence and activation. Third, instrumental or problem solution goals or task-related (or achievement outcomes) goals are important. Fourth, goals of social integration or goals with belonging-oriented outcomes are relevant in general and especially in the workplace. Other goals or motives are important, like maintaining a positive self-image and defending self-esteem and cognitive motives, or understanding emotions and affect [17,18]. Briefly, affect regulation can be characterized by the inclination to improve feelings and arousal, solve tasks successfully, defend self-esteem, and understand and control experience, as well as to maintain or improve social integration."

Here, not only the search for social support, widely studied, but also forms of regulation that involve mobilizing changes in social relationships can be integrated, like altruism, negotiation, mediation, delegation, and public rituals. As forms of regulation based on social relationships, seeking and giving social support, as well as negotiation, have been studied. In particular, prosocial behavior or altruism that increases well-being [19]. Negotiation is aimed at making a deal and proposing a compromise with others, in order to reduce stress. Previous studies have identified negotiation and altruism as frequently chosen regulation strategies that are associated with adjustment [20]. Mediation and delegation are forms of regulation also linked to the use of social relationships. Mediation seeks the intervention of third parties as intermediaries, while delegation involves vicarious and indirect control through figures of higher status and expertise, in which the instrumental resolution of the situation is delegated (e.g., to a doctor, a teacher, or a more knowledgeable colleague). Mediation and delegation as indirect forms of changing the situation through social relationships were more effective than direct coping in situations with limited controllability [21]. However, the involvement of third parties as mediators and delegation were rarely used in previous samples, and the latter was not adaptive in the workplace [20]. Private and public rituals, as well as participation in social movements or social participation, constitute forms of regulation that involve the use of social instruments. Both private and public rituals have been associated with well-being in coping with collective stressful events [22]. In the work environment, it was identified the use of collective or public rituals as a regulation strategy [23] and there is evidence of their positive effects in other areas [18,24]. Finally, participation in social movements, although it is a less frequent form of coping, and is only applicable in situations of collective problems, can be an adaptive way for the regulation of stress [25]."

            "text": "Another form of regulation that relates to social relationships is the use of humor. Styles of humour refer to how a person interacts with others using fun in interpersonal communications [26]. Humor mitigates negative affect, and together with the expression of affection o, constitutes a way of regulating feelings. Humor would aid in regulation through physiological reactions, producing relief through the production of endorphins, similarly to what occurs during physical activity [27]. Studies have shown that the activation of opposite emotions that influences the use of affection and humor directly helps to increase positive emotions and reduce negative ones [28]. Furthermore, humor can help to reinterpret and react to stressors in a more positive way, reducing their impact and symptoms of anxiety [27]. Research has also shown that humor reinforces adaptive regulation forms such as reevaluation or de-dramatization and the search for social support through affiliative humor [20]. Finally, there is a positive association between sense of humor, assertiveness, and creativity [28]."

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, positive forms of regulation such as humor are associated with creativity. In general, creativity can be defined as the ability to generate novel, original, infrequent, and useful or adaptive responses to a problem or situation. In the affective domain, creativity facilitates adaptive regulation. A personality trait linked to this topic is called emotional creativity (EC). It is the ability to attend to and experience complex emotions\u2014rare or novel ones\u2014in an authentic and adaptive way [29,30]. EC has been associated with well-being and correlated with a higher adjustment after an intense emotional experience. It has also been shown in university students to be a predictor\nof intrinsic motivation and academic commitment [31]. This trait is related to divergent thinking, the ability to be creative and original in emotional experiences, and emotional regulation, specifically reinforcing adaptive reappraisal. Finally, motional creativity is linked to creative performance [32]. In addition to this personality trait, forms of regulation such as humor, active physiological regulation, regulated emotional expression, gratitude and self-reward, thankfulness, and reappraisal facilitate creativity. The use of humor involves distancing, creative and positive reformulation of events. Probably through affective and cognitive pathways, it strengthens creativity or the generation of innovative responses [26]. Active physiological regulation, which involves some kind of physical activity, increases positive affect and, through it, creativity [33]. Regulated emotional expression increases creativity, probably because it is related to greater abilities to analyze and delay the response, which allows overcoming habitual responses [34]. Self-reward and thankfulness are associated with creativity because they involve the interpretation of reality in an innovative way, where the search for alternative positive stimuli helps to elaborate creative responses. Reappraisal as distancing and changing perspective also reinforces creativity [35]."

            "text": "Research has shown that people who use more functional regulation strategies experience high psychological well-being [4,36]. Therefore, well-being measures are also important to verify the functionality of emotional regulation strategies in different situations [37]. Specifically, some studies have focused on studying the relationship between regulation strategies and psychological or eudaimonic well-being (which refers to the extent to which individuals perceive their lives to be meaningful, purposeful, and fulfilling), while others have also related them to measures of hedonic well-being (which refers to the subjective experience of pleasure, happiness, and life satisfaction) [38]. For example, in a study conducted by [39] with 470 adults, positive reappraisal and refocusing on planning were positively correlated with subjective and psychological wellbeing. Additionally, rumination, catastrophizing, and self-blame were linked to poorer well-being. In another study low suppression, low self-critical use of humor, and affiliative humor were linked to higher levels of psychological well-being. Similarly, self-enhancing humor and low suppression were associated with higher levels of happiness [40]. More recently, a study conducted by [18] analyzed different strategies of emotional regulation [4] and its association with hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The results showed that maladaptive coping strategies, such as withdrawal and social isolation, and suppression were associated with higher levels of negative affect or low hedonic well being. Conversely, coping strategies such as social support, gratitude and self-reward, reappraisal, as well as venting and regulated expression were found to be significantly associated with higher levels of positive affect. Similar results were found in the relationship of strategies with psychological well-being. Specifically, suppression, social isolation and withdrawal were associated with low psychological well-being., At the opposite, strategies such as problem-directed action and planning, attentional deployment through distraction, seeking social support, cognitive change by reappraisal, response modulation by active physiological regulation, as well as venting and regulated expression, acceptance and gratitude/self-reward, have been found to be positively correlated with psychological wellbeing. However, as observed in previous studies, the functionality of emotional regulation strategies and their relationship with well-being varies depending on the situations and interactions that occur with others [37]. Therefore, it is essential to conduct more studies that allow us to verify the functionality of emotional regulation strategies and their relationship with well-being in different contexts."

The study design sought to examine the relationship of affective regulation to stress adaptation and well-being, as well as the relationship of affective regulation to trait and performance creativity. In this research, instruments related to affective regulation were used. In this section, as a measure of affect regulation, the MARS scale [41,42] was responded to. A version consisting of 64 items was applied (see Tables 2\u20135). Participants were asked to indicate how often they performed the actions mentioned to regulate/manage stress situations in the study, work, or sports context. The response scale was a Likert-type scale (0 = never to 6 = almost always). However, in the athlete\u2019s studies, items of Altruism, Mediation, Negotiation, Delegation, Social participation, Search for information and Passive physiological regulation were not included\u2014because they were not relevant for this domain.\nNote. n.d. = no data available in this study.

In bold the eta squares that explain 1 percent or more of the variance.\nNote. n.d. = no data available in this study. In bold the eta squares that explain 1 percent or more of the variance.\nParticipants also answered the perception of adjustment in the mentioned episodes [17,40]. Here, the perceived functionality of the emotional regulation strategies was measured through six items that asked to what extent the following goals had been achieved when coping with stressful episodes at work: (1) decrease the intensity with which this emotional experience was lived, i.e., to change from high emotional experience, i.e., to change from high activation to calmness, relaxation calm, relaxation; (2) decrease displeasure, discomfort or unpleasantness, i.e., change from displeasure to greater pleasure; (3) understand the emotional experience of the situation; (4) to control or solve the problem associated with the situation, i.e., to change to greater control over the situation; (5) to manage relationships with other people, to change them for the better, to have a better relation (6) to improve one\u2019s self-image. Responses were given on a Likert-type scale (1 = little or no change to 10 = change to a great extent). The reliability of the scale in the studies was highly satisfactory (\u03b1 = 0.95 \u00d7 101; \u03b1 = 0.84 \u00d7 102; \u03b1 = 0.90 \u00d7 103). Other scales answered in this section by workers and student\u2019s samples included the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) [43]. This scale assess individual differences in two emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. The scale consists of 10 items [e.g., when I want to feel more pleasant emotions, I change what I am thinking] and is responded to on a Likert scale (1 = completely disagree and 7 = completely agree). The reliabilities were found to be acceptable in the studies in which it was used (\u03b1 = 0.74 and 0.69 \u00d7 101; \u03b1 = 0.77 and 0.78 \u00d7 102). Participants in the students and athlete\u2019s samples answer the emotional inter-regulation EROS instrument [44]. This scale of nine items evaluates individual differences in the regulation of others\u2019 emotions (or hetero regulation). A first dimension composed of six items evaluates the tendency to increase others\u2019 positive emotions and decrease their negative emotions [e.g., I did something pleasant or rewarding with others]. A second dimension\nof three items evaluates the tendency to increase others\u2019 negative emotions [e.g., I talked to someone about their mistakes and limitations]. It is responded to on a Likert scale (1 = completely disagree and 5 = completely agree). The reliability in improving and worsening emotions was partially adequate in both studies (\u03b1 = 0.76 and 0.61 \u00d7 102; \u03b1 = 0.75 and 0.89 \u00d7 103). Another section included in all studies consisted of measuring well-being and healthrelated quality of life. General, eudaimonic, hedonic, and social well-being were measured using the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI) [45]. This instrument, which contains 11 items [e.g., \u201cI feel very satisfied with my life\u201d], is responded to on a Likert-type scale (0 = completely disagree and 10 = completely agree). The reliability was very adequate in all three samples (\u03b1 = 0.87 \u00d7 101; \u03b1 = 0.87 \u00d7 102; \u03b1 = 0.91 \u00d7 103). Health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-36 health survey in the study 1 [46]. This instrument is also responded to on a Likert-type scale. It includes a general health dimension that asks about physical health (1 = excellent to 5 = poor; from 1 = completely true to 5 = completely false), a mental health dimension that asks about anxiety and depression (1 = completely true to 6 = completely false), and a vitality dimension that asks about energy and fatigue (1 = always to 6 = never), in all cases during the last month. The reliability in this study [E2] was satisfactory (\u03b1 = 0.75 for general health, 0.82 for mental health, and 0.82 for vitality). In the study 2 humor styles were also measured using the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) [26]. This instrument consists of 32 items and four dimensions: affiliative humor (\u03b1 = 0.40 if item 29 is eliminated), self-enhancing humor (\u03b1 = 0.68), aggressive humor (\u03b1 = 0.61 if item 23 is eliminated), and self-defeating humor (\u03b1 = 0.70). Each dimension contains 8 items. It is responded to using a Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). The study 1 measured emotional creativity as a trait and its indicators of creativity and innovation in the ideation phase. Emotional creativity as a trait was measured using the Spanish version of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI-S) [30], which is composed of 17 items grouped into three dimensions: emotional preparedness or disposition (e.g., when I have strong emotional reactions, I seek the reasons for my feelings); novelty or ability to experience new or unusual emotions (e.g., I have felt a combination of emotions that probably other people have never experienced), and effectiveness/authenticity (e.g., the way I express and experience my emotions helps me in my reactions with other people). Participants responded using a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree). The reliability of this study was very satisfactory (\u03b1 = 0.83, E1). Participants in the study 1 were then presented with a case of a workplace conflict [32] and were asked to: (1) write about how they would feel in that situation, (2) how they would regulate their emotions and those of others in this case, (3) what they would include in a written proposal to the company\u2019s management as solutions for improvement, and (4) what other actions they would take\u2014independently of the written proposal\u2014to resolve the workplace conflict. Using the CAT method [47], independent judges evaluated each participant\u2019s fluency or number of ideas. They also evaluated the originality, effectiveness, and authenticity versus conventional or socially desirable responses using a Likert scale (5 = high, 1 = low). The correlations between the judges\u2019 scores were significant with r(63) = 0.65 for effectiveness, r = 0.70 for originality, and r = 0.68 for authenticity [E1]."

They are also formulated in standard international Spanish. In addition, cross-cultural value studies such as the World value survey show the existence of a shared Catholic European and Latin American cultural value domain [49]. This justifies in our opinion to carry out a general analysis. Reliability analyses were carried out for each scale per sample. Means comparison between samples of the use of regulatory strategies was carried out to contrast the exploratory H1.\nAnalysis comparing how students, workers and athletes regulated emotions using only Spaniards samples shows similar results to general ones. Means of regulation strategies were compared between samples to explore differences between work, study and sport contexts. Subsequently, regulation strategies were correlated with stress adjustment and psychological well-being. Correlations between strategies with the variables of adjustment to stress and well-being in all samples allows us to examine H2. In more exploratory analysis, we examine the relationship of affect regulation with creativity in solving a work conflict. In the sample of workers, trait creativity and creativity of work conflict resolution were correlated with regulation strategies. In the student sample, the relationship between humor styles and regulation and criterion variables is examined. For a probability of a Type I error of \u03b1 = 0.05 and a probability of a Type II error (1 \u2212 \u03b2) of 0.80, and for a typical effect size in social psychology of r = 0.21 [50] or of r = 0.24 [51] the required sample size for correlation analysis is N = 176 and N = 134 respectively [52] so that our samples meets the statistical power requirement. Finally, the mediational role of strategies between psychological well-being and stress adjustment is carried out to examine H3. A mediational analysis using Process was carried out in the student\u2019s sample. For student large sample basic multiple regression analysis prerequisites (homoscedasticity...) were meet. Psychological well-being as global evaluation of person disposition is arguable the cause (X variable) of strategies of coping (M or mediation variables) as well a cause of adjustment to stress in the achievement domain (Y or effect or dependent variable). Moreover, PWB correlated with both coping strategies and adjustment, and coping with adjustment\u2014meeting four steps that establish mediation X-M-Y are all correlated (see Kenny https://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm, accessed on 23 October 2022) [53]. However, recall that Hayes states that these correlations need not be significant in order to apply a mediational analysis. In our case, we only included variables that were significantly correlated in any case. Program was Hayes\u2019s Process. Effect size estimation for mediation was carried out as suggested by a reviewer with Kenny and another computer software. Using Kenny MedPower https://davidakenny.shinyapps.io/MedPower/, accessed on 23 October 2022, a sample of 250 is required for power 0.80 or higher in the direct and indirect coefficients of a mediational analysis (for an estimated effect size 0.20). For a probability of a Type I error of \u03b1 = 0.05 and a probability of a Type II error (1\u2014\u03b2) of 0.80, and for a mediation coefficient of r = 0.20, and supposing 10 covariables, a sample of N = 276 is required\u2014using https://xuqin.shinyapps.io/CausalMediationPowerAnalysis/, accessed on 23 October 2022. So our sample meets the assumptions and statistical power requirement for mediational analysis."

Athletes, followed by workers, show more use of the gratitude and self-reward strategy than students, except in doing something special to reward and feel better, this strategy is more used by the last group. Explained variance was 8.6%, 5% and 2,4% for items 28, 30 and 31 respectively. Athletes, followed by workers, more than students, report using spiritual activities and reappraisal as a form of regulation\u2014but only in one item and explaining 1.8% of variance in the last case. Athletes report performing more social comparison and students less, with workers located between both groups in the use of this family of regulation\u2014explained variance was 2.5% and 9.2%."

Participation is associated with adjustment and well-being in students, while in workers it is negatively associated with both.

Finally, mediation and delegation do not confirm their supposed adaptive character, and the latter is even negatively associated with wellbeing in samples of workers and students.\nThe distraction strategy is positively associated with both adjustment and well-being in students and athletes; acceptance is positively associated with adjustment in athletes and with well-being in both groups.

Differences in the use and, to a lesser extent, the efficacy of regulation strategies were found between workers, students, and athletes. Dysfunctional regulation strategies such as rumination and social comparison are maladaptive for workers and students but not for athletes, which has also been shown in previous studies [18]. Moreover, maladaptive strategies in the former two groups such as confrontation and suppression do not have negative effects on athletes (H1). There is a congruent relationship between the use of functional strategies and adjustment to stress, well-being, and health-related quality of life. This congruence is also found to some extent in humor styles such as self-affirmation, as well as in creativity, both emotional and applied or innovation in the ideation phase to cope with a conflicting work situation (H2). However, negative heteroregulation, that worsens the emotions of others, is associated with well-being and personal adjustment in the student sample. This result may suggest that attempting to influence the emotions of others, even critically, has positive effects for the individual, reinforces self-esteem and personal self-efficacy, even if it has negative effects on others. However, this conclusion must be relativized because of the low reliability of the scale. Furthermore, it was confirmed that adaptive regulation strategies mediate the relationship between well-being and adjustment to stress (H3). It is possible to conclude that the use of adaptive self- and hetero-regulation strategies facilitates adjustment and is related psychological well-being. Confirming their general adaptive nature, the following strategies were associated with adjustment and well-being: direct coping, social support, distraction, self-reward, gratitude, reappraisal, active physiological regulation, use of humor and affection, as well as regulated expression. On the other hand, low psychological abandonment, low passive physiological regulation, and low suppression were associated with adjustment and well-being. The results suggest that individuals who know and regulate their own emotions properly can be more effective in work, studies, and sports teams. This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis showing the relevance of these emotional processes in adaptive behavior in different contexts [55]. A state of high well-being has horizontal influence between peers, and vertical influence through the leaders, helping to create a positive group climate. Since moods tend to be contagious and/or transmitted in\nboth work teams and groups, when they are positive in a high well-being climate, they can help mitigate negative situations in study, work, and sports groups [56]. When leaders are in a good mood, team/group members are more positive and cooperate more [57]. These aspects can facilitate their creativity [48,58]. In the following paragraphs we discuss, in detail, the difference in frequency of use of the strategies between students, workers and athletes. We then examine their functionality in each group. We differentiate in our discussion the three phases of Gross\u2019s model: situation modification and social bonding, attention reorientation and cognitive change, and finally, experience modification and emotional regulation."

The effect size was small, of eta squared 0.01 or 0.02, equivalent to an r = 0.10 or 0.14 or d = 0.20 or 0.28. These results could be explained by the fact that direct action (see items 04, 05 and 06 in Table 2) is possibly more frequent in the professional sports context, although it is also expected to be commonly used in the educational context and desirable in the workplace. Lower use of social support strategy in the worker sample than in the student sample, is probably explained by the fact that the work environment tends to be more concrete and focused on the individual than that of sports\u2014especially if it is cooperative or collective. Students specifically seek more emotional social support, and express and discharge emotions more intensely than the other two groups, as described below. This could be explained by a more informal youth sociability and more horizontal social relationships. It is possible that in work and high-performance sports contexts, more regulated interactions give less room for expressive spontaneity. Overall, students use more regulation forms that involve mobilizing social relationships in line with more horizontal and spontaneous interactions that occur in the educational setting. Specifically, students make relatively more use\u2014than workers- of negotiation. In turn, athletes make greater use of rituals as a regulation strategy than the other two groups."

This result confirms that helping others allows individuals to move away from egocentrism and feel effective and socially integrated [20]. Helping others, even if done \u201cselfishly\u201d, is effective [19]. Negotiation may be adaptive because it involves negotiating at a similar level of status and reducing conflict. Others forms of social regulation, like mediation and delegation are negatively associated with adjustment in workers, but not in students. The results suggest that asking for a third-party intervention in the work context is not functional, probably because it implies \u201cbreaking\u201d defined roles. Delegating to others is also not adaptive in either group. In performance or achievement contexts, delegating is associated with not directly taking control of the situation, which can result in low levels of effectiveness and self-esteem."

These results suggest that despite the current weaknesses of the student movement, participating in social movements has positive effects for students. As for workers, the low well-being in\nrelation to social participation could be explained by the weakness of the labor movement and the cost it could have for salaried personnel. While rituals are not adaptive in students and show a negative association in workers, they are associated with well-being and adjustment in athletes. Evidence supports that the level of collective ritual and its effects are potent in sports contexts where the use of amulets, lucky signs, coordinated chants, and collective celebrations are behaviors of high frequency and significance [59]. It has been postulated that the use of private rituals is common for coping with competition anxiety [60,61]. This study confirms this approach, suggesting that using rituals as a regulation strategy reduces anxiety and helps to focus on the task, allowing for an improvement in performance."

This shows a greater secularization in young people with higher education than in other groups. Athletes reevaluate and self-reward more and have a higher attitude of gratitude than the other two groups\u2014and the effect size was medium high or important. The fact that this group uses all forms of cognitive change and focus on activity corroborates what has been found in other studies [62,63]. Although sport is found to be a source of greater satisfaction and flow than study and work [64], other results qualify this assertion [65]. It is possible that in the study environment and some work contexts, it is more difficult to find and use positive stimuli to reward oneself. Another explanation is that people may not know how to use these regulation styles in the analyzed areas, even though they are familiar with them."

Rumination and social comparison are non-adaptive strategies in students and workers, although they are positively associated with adjustment and well-being in athletes in this and other study [66]. Although workers report using social comparison at a moderate level, it is negatively associated with well-being in this group. This last result is also found in students. Remember that in general, social comparison has been shown to be a maladaptive regulation strategy [18].

These results are replicated in this study, except for the case of athletes. While these strategies have been shown to be maladaptive in other studies, it was found that both discharge and confrontation were associated with regulated expression of emotions and adjustment in the sample of workers. These results suggest that direct but nonaggressive expression of anger may be an adaptive strategy in the work environment [32]. On the other hand, the fact that venting is not dysfunctional in sports can be explained, in part, because an ideal emotional profile in sports included, among other traits, being somewhat anxious and a little angry, consistent with the meta-analysis of [68] on sport psychology and performance."

This could suggest that the expression of humor and affection plays different roles depending on the analyzed context. It is possible that the sense of competition and commitment in sports leads to humor being considered a distraction -as measured in this study- and that demonstrations of affection are not desirable or are expressed differently in the context of competitive sports, studying, and work. It is important to remember, in the same vein, that there was less acceptance of expressiveness or discharge and greater confrontation in the sports field than among students and workers. Humor styles were also found to be associated with well-being. Consistent with previous studies [69], in this study, self-enhancing humor was associated with well-being. Aggressive humor was associated with non-adaptive coping strategies such as confrontation and discharge, suggesting a social integration cost for this style. However, this humor style was also associated with altruism, gratitude, and distraction, which help to obtain social support. Its ambivalent nature can be explained by the fact that it is not negatively associated with well-being. Self-defeating humor, which is usually associated with distress neuroticism and low wellbeing [26], was found to be associated with nonadaptive strategies such as suppression, passive physiological regulation, confrontation, and delegation, which may explain its general association with distress. However, it was also associated with reappraisal and active physiological regulation. The ambivalent nature of self-defeating humor can be explained by the fact that this style focuses on internal processes. Laughing at oneself as a detached critique can be adaptive, while coping with stress through intense physical exercise can be an externalized form of coping.

The specific strategies that mediate between these variables are direct coping, low abandonment, reappraisal, active physiological regulation, and regulated expression. These confirm their central role in emotional regulation. Well-being was associated with greater acceptance and discharge, which in turn showed a negative effect on adjustment in this analysis. That is, these strategies mediated negatively. The results suggest that students with higher well-being tend simultaneously to express their emotions intensely while also practicing self-control. Multivariate results suggest that, when eliminating the influence of other adaptive regulation forms, these strategies (discharge and acceptance) have a negative influence, e.g., if the influence of regulated expression of emotions is eliminated, discharge itself does not help adjustment. Acceptance, if the influence of positive reappraisal is eliminated, is not helpful either. These results were found with nuances in the other two groups (mediational analysis not shown). For example, in workers, the effect of well-being on adjustment was shown to be significant through gratitude, low discharge, and high reappraisal. In athletes, acceptance mediated positively between well-being and adjustment. As study limitations, it is noted that this is a cross-sectional study that prevents making causal statements and that the samples were large but convenience samples. Another limitation is that the reliabilities of some of the scales, like EROs worsening heteroregulation scale and affiliative humor scales\u2014in some of the samples in this study\u2014are low. MARS strategies such as behavioral avoidance and distraction in athletes, rumination and active physiological regulation in students, showed reliabilities below 0.70, although not as low as the previous ones. This limits the scope of the results of this study. Regarding the results of humor and creativity, the small samples do not allow for generalizing the findings, however, they are consistent with previous studies.

            "text": "In conclusion, it is noted that in general, an adaptive regulation profile would be formed by high direct coping, which would help people perceive and validate effective actions. This profile would also involve focusing attention on the positive, self-rewarding, gratitude attitudes, distracting from the most negative and stressful aspects, and focusing attention on rewarding stimuli. Not inhibiting emotions and expressing them in a regulated\nmanner is another component of the adaptive profile, as well as thinking positively or reevaluating the situation by distancing oneself from stress and extracting positive aspects from what has happened. Regarding hetero-regulation, in general, adaptive tactics are direct coping, reappraisal, and social support for managing the emotions of others. People like their leaders to motivate them and give positive feedback for a job well done. The mentioned profile of self and hetero-regulation can contribute to high well-being. Specifically, this profile should be examined in different samples and their specificities, e.g., criticism and expression of dissatisfaction with the emotions of others in the sports context are associated with well-being, suggesting that in that context, they are adaptive. Training and intervention in the area of affective regulation should take into account the predominance of functional emotional social influence on others, which contributes to generating emotionally positive climates with low negativity.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.C.D.C.D., X.O.G. and D.P.-R.; methodology, S.C.D.C.D. and D.P.-R.; software, D.P.-R. and S.C.D.C.D.; validation, S.C.D.C.D., X.O.G., V.D., C.C.-D. and A.I.; formal analysis, S.C.D.C.D. and D.P.-R.; investigation, S.C.D.C.D.; X.O.G. and D.P.-R.; resources, S.C.D.C.D., X.O.G., D.P.-R., V.D., C.C.-D. and A.I.; data curation, S.C.D.C.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.C.D.C.D., X.O.G. and D.P.-R.; writing\u2014review and editing, V.D., C.C.-D. and A.I.; visualization, V.D., C.C.-D., A.I., D.P.-R., S.C.D.C.D. and D.P.-R.; supervision, S.C.D.C.D. and D.P.-R.; project administration, S.C.D.C.D.; funding acquisition, S.C.D.C.D., X.O.G. and D.P.-R.
