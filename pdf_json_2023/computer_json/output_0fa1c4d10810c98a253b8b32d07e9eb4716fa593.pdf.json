    "abstractText": "Sea level monitoring is particularly important in coastal areas that are vulnerable to marine disasters. It was recently demonstrated that the global navigation satellite system multipath reflectometry (GNSS-MR) technique, which uses multipath signals reflected from the sea, can be applied to determine the sea level. However, this approach does not provide sufficient accuracy or equally spaced sampling to meet the actual sea level monitoring requirements for certain stations. To solve the deficiency of the traditional GNSS-MR technique, the least squares method, which is based on sliding time windows, was applied. Using the sliding windows to combine the quadconstellation multi-GNSS retrieval can effectively improve the accuracy and time resolution of sea level retrieval, but insufficient data or a lack of data in some time ranges and missing overflights in some timeframes can lead to the calculation of faults in these time windows, causing the estimated loss of corresponding sampling points. In this study, we used a robust regression solution strategy based on multi-GNSS sea level retrieval and an improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD) algorithm to process sea level retrieval after robust regression. BRST and HKQT stations are located on the western coast of France and the northern coast of Hong Kong. The two stations can both receive satellite observation data from the four satellite systems. Through the experiment, using data retrieved from the BRST and HKQT stations, the results of this study demonstrate that the IVMD method based on multi-GNSS sea level retrieval can further improve the accuracy to <10 cm and can achieve 10 min equal interval sampling. This is significant for using GNSS-MR technology to detect sea level height and monitor sea level change and could be applied to other sites.",

            "text": "Global warming has led to a rise in sea levels, and sea level monitoring is particularly important for coastal areas that are vulnerable to marine disasters [1]. Traditionally, sea level monitoring was performed using a tide gauge (TG) [1]. The emergence of satellite altimetry technology has made it possible to detect the sea level of the global oceans, playing a key role in the study of sea level changes [2]. Since the development of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), the applications of GNSSs have expanded continuously. The multipath effect, which has been considered an error source, has been demonstrated to be suitable for estimating the sea level [3], and it has gradually developed into the Global Navigation Satellite System multipath reflectometry (GNSS-MR) technique, which has been applied to detect vegetation water content [4], soil moisture [5], and snow depth [6]. The GNSS-MR has become a research focus because of its advantages, i.e., its low cost, all-weather monitoring, and automatically fixed framework [7]. GNSS-MR technology was first proposed for sea level estimation by Hall [8]. Larson et al., developed a GNSS-MR sea level retrieval technique based on offshore geodetic receivers and successfully measured the sea level height retrieval for three months [3]. Nakashima and Heki used the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations of a single satellite\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1733. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15071733 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1733 2 of 15\nto detect sea level height changes based on GNSS-MR sea level retrieval technology, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of retrievals can reach 27 cm [9]. With the further development of GNSS-MR technology, more satellite signals were used for sea level monitoring. L\u00f6fgren et al., used the SNR data of the L1 and L2 frequency bands of the GPS and GLONASS systems to study sea level change, realizing sea level estimation by using multi-GNSS SNR observations [10]. Jin et al., used the Beidou system L2, L6, and L7 frequency bands for the first time to estimate the sea level change using a method based on the combination of SNR data from a three-frequency phase code. The experimental results showed that the Beidou reflection signal can also be used for sea level monitoring [11]. Ansari et al., confirmed that the KELM-based estimates from multi GNSS-R observations, comprising QZSS-R and other complementary measurements from GPS-R and GLONASS-R, provided alternative unbiased estimations to the traditional tide-gauge measurement [12]. Furthermore, more error sources have been corrected to improve the accuracy of sea level monitoring [13\u201315]. Purnell et al., proposed a model estimation method to quantitatively evaluate the effects of surface roughness, sea surface dynamics, and tropospheric delay on the accuracy of GNSS-R sea level estimation [16]. In contrast, a better quality control method is used for GNSS-MR. Strandberg et al., proposed an inversion model based on nonlinear least squares and the B-spline function [17], which combines the SNR data of the GPS and GLONASS systems for sea level retrieval. The results were in agreement with the measured data from the tide-gauge station. Santamar\u00eda et al., used SNR observations and obtained tidal level retrieval with an RMS of approximately 3 cm through atmospheric refraction correction using an extended Kalman filter and a smoothing algorithm [18,19]. Wang et al., used the wavelet decomposition method to decompose different frequency signals in SNR observation data to eliminate the impact of noise from coastal reflection signals and improve the accuracy of the spectrum analysis results [20]. In 2019, Wang et al., used the wavelet analysis method to process the SNR observation series and used the results of the traditional LSP method retrieval as the gross error threshold to extract the instantaneous tidal level height value of each epoch in each arc segment, which greatly increased the time resolution of the GNSS-MR retrieval [21]. Zhang et al., used empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose and denoise the SNR observation series, select the effective components by calculating the correlation between each component and the original signal, and then reconstruct the tide level value. The results showed that EMD can expand the available elevation range of GNSS-MR technology and avoid the loss of effective data [22]. Aimed at the problem that GNSS-R technology cannot monitor the sea level in real time in practical applications, Strandberg et al., adopted the method of combining the unscented Kalman filter and the B-spline function to carry out GNSS-R experiments in Sweden and Australia, respectively. The precision of their tide level retrieval was better than 5 cm, achieving the real-time monitoring of tide level changes [23]. In terms of sea level retrieval, Roussel et al., combined sea level retrieval using GPS and GLONASS data based on the least squares method using sliding windows [24]. Wang et al., established the state equation and used sliding time windows to combine the quad-constellation multi-GNSS retrieval results to verify that multi-GNSS-MR can further improve the accuracy and time resolution of sea level retrieval [25]. Compared with the classical SNR analysis method, the method using sliding windows to solve the sea level retrieval is more precise and can achieve equal interval sampling by using moving windows [26,27]. However, insufficient data or a lack of data in the corresponding time range and missing overflights in the corresponding timeframe can lead to the calculation of faults in these time windows and the estimated loss of corresponding sampling points. Therefore, based on the multi-GNSS combination method using a sliding window, this study proposes an improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD) algorithm based on the parameter selection of the objective function which takes energy entropy mutual information (EEMI) as an indicator [28\u201333]. This can remove the sea level height outliers after a multi-GNSS combination using sliding windows, which can supplement the lack of\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1733 3 of 15\ndata in the least square estimation when the window retrieval data is insufficient, further limiting the error of the least squares retrieval and improving the accuracy and time resolution of the GNSS-MR technology based on multi-GNSS data in sea level monitoring."

Theory and Methods 3.1. Multi-GNSS Combination Algorithm 3.1.1. Classical Sea Level Retrieval Theory\nThe classic principle of sea level retrieval, based on the GNSS-MR technique, uses a static sea level model to obtain the reflector height (RH), i.e., the vertical distance between the reflecting surface and the antenna phase center. Under the assumption of a static sea level, the relationship between the main frequency of the SNR and RH is as follows:\n\u210e\ufffd = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06 2\n(1)\nwhere \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06 is the wavelength of the signal, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06 is the peak frequency of the SNR arc that can be extracted by the Lomb\u2013Scargle periodogram analysis, and \u210e\ufffd is the reflector height, which has errors. There are two main error sources that need to be considered: (i) the error caused by the variation rate of parameter RH, namely tan(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52)\n?\u0307?\ud835\udc52 \u210e\u0307, where \u210e\u0307 is the variation\nrate of the parameter RH and ?\u0307?\ud835\udc52 is the variation rate of the elevation angle. (ii) The error caused by troposphere delay, namely \u0394\u210e\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 , which can be deduced from the global temperature and pressure model. The absolute height of the sea level was calculated by subtracting RH from a constant. This constant can be ascertained from the international reference coordinates.\n3.1.2.

            "text": "The combination method for multi-GNSS sea level retrieval using sliding windows cannot resist the effects of the error completely; some low-quality signals in the window will affect the final accuracy of the overall retrieval. In addition, some windows lack data due to missing overflights in the corresponding timeframe, which may result in calculation and estimation failures in these windows. To solve this, an IVMD method based on multiGNSS combination sea level retrieval is proposed. We used the energy entropy mutual information (EEMI) as an indicator and took the sum of two EEMI modal functions as objective functions to develop the VMD algorithm. We then analyzed the effectiveness and feasibility of this method using sea level retrieval data from the BRST and HKQT stations.\n3.2.1. Principles of the VMD Method\nVMD is one of the recently established multi-resolution techniques for adaptive and non-recursive signal decomposition into different IMFs. It can be used to reduce the nonstationary of data [35]. The basic principle of VMD is to decompose the original signal f into K modal elements with a center frequency \u03c9k and reconstruct it so that the VMD process can be seen as the solution to the constrained variational problem. Equation (6) describes this process. min {\u00b5k},{\u03c9k} { K \u2211 k=1 \u2016\u2202t [( \u03b4(t) + j\u03c0t ) \u00d7 \u00b5k(t) ] e\u2212j\u03c9kt\u201622 } s.t. \u2211\nk \u00b5k = f\n(6)\nHere, \u03c9k is the center frequency of the modal function, \u00b5k(t) is the intrinsic modal function, e\u2212j\u03c9kt is the center frequency of the analytic signal, and \u03b4(t) is the impulse function. To solve the above variational problem, we used the Lagrange operator \u03bb(t) and the quadratic penalty factor \u03b1 to ensure the tightness of the constraint conditions and the accuracy of reconstruction when containing Gaussian noise, which can be expressed as\nL(\u00b5k(t), \u03c9k, \u03bb(t)) = \u03b1 K \u2211 k=1 \u2016\u2202t [( \u03b4(t) + j\u03c0t ) \u2217 \u00b5k(t) ] e\u2212j\u03c9kt\u201622\n+\u2016 f (t)\u2212 K \u2211\nk=1 \u00b5k(t)\u2016+\n\u2329 \u03bb(t), f (t)\u2212 K \u2211\nk=1 \u00b5k(t)\n\u232a (7)\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1733 7 of 15\nEquation (7) can be solved by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to update \u00b5kn+1(t), \u03c9kn+1, \u03bbn+1(t) to find the optimal. The iterative process of the intrinsic modal function \u00b5k(t) is as follows:\n\u00b5k n+1(\u03c9) =\nf\u0302 (\u03c9)\u2212\u2211i 6=k \u00b5\u0302i(\u03c9) + \u03bb\u0302(\u03c9)\n2\n1 + 2\u03b1(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9k)2 (8)\n\u03c9n+1k =\n\u222b \u221e 0 \u03c9|\u00b5\u0302k(\u03c9)|\n2d\u03c9\u222b \u221e 0 |\u00b5\u0302k(\u03c9)| 2d\u03c9 (9)\nwhere n is the number of iterations and f\u0302 (\u03c9), \u00b5\u0302k(\u03c9), \u00b5\u0302kn+1(\u03c9), \u03bb\u0302(\u03c9) represent the results of the Fourier transforms of f\u0302 (t), \u00b5k(t), \u00b5n+1k (t), \u03bb(t). The iterative process of the Lagrange operator is as follows:\n\u03bb\u0302n+1(\u03c9) = \u03bb\u0302n(\u03c9) + \u03c4 [ f\u0302 (\u03c9)\u2212 K\n\u2211 k=1 \u00b5\u0302n+1k (\u03c9)\n] (10)\nwhere \u03c4 is the iteration step. Equation (10) shows the convergence condition:\nK\n\u2211 k=1\n\u2016\u00b5\u0302n+1k \u2212 \u00b5\u0302 n k \u2016 2 2\n\u2016\u00b5\u0302nk \u2016 2 2\n< \u03b5 (11)\n3.2.2. IVMD Algorithm\nThe determination of the number of decomposed modal functions, K, and the setting of penalty factors, \u03b1, are the keys to signal decomposition using the VMD method. Compared to the number of useful components in the processed signal, if the K value is less, it will cause insufficient data decomposition; if K is more, it will cause over-decomposition. If the value of the penalty factor is not suitable, it may lead to the overlapping of the center frequency of the modal function. Therefore, selecting appropriate parameters is particularly important. At the same time, multi-GNSS sea level retrieval is polluted by stationary and non-stationary noise; therefore, we cannot only use a single metric to obtain the characteristics of the signal. The mixture of two or more single metrics can provide greater robustness; therefore, to determine the parameters of VMD, we used energy entropy mutual information (EEMI) as an indicator, took the sum of two EEMI modal functions as objective functions, and applied the Grasshopper optimization algorithm to optimize the VMD parameters [36]. The formula used is as follows: f itness = min \u03b3=(K,\u03b1) { \u2212 2 \u2211 i=1 EEMI } K \u2208 [2, 8]\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 10, 1000]\n(12)\nwhere f itness is the objective function, \u03b3 = (K, \u03b1) is the value range of the VMD the parameters, and EEMI = EE \u2217MI, EE, and MI can be calculated as follows: Ei = \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e |im fi(t)| 2dti, i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K \u03c3i = Ei E EE = \u2212 N \u2211\ni=1 (\u03c3i)In(\u03c3i)\n(13)\nwhere EE and MI represent the energy entropy and mutual information, im fi(t)(i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K) are the modes of different frequency, and Ei = {E1, E2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , EK} is the energy distribution\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 1733 8 of 15\nof the different signals in the frequency domain.

It can be seen from the figure that the IVMD decomposed the multi-GNSS sea level retrieval data from the BRST station and HKQT station into six IMFs.

            "text": "The combination method for multi-GNSS sea level retrieval based on sliding windows can effectively improve the accuracy and time resolution of sea level retrieval but cannot completely eliminate errors, and some low-quality signals in the window will affect the final accuracy of the overall retrieval. In addition, some windows lack data due to missing overflights in the corresponding timeframe, which may result in calculation and estimation failures in these windows. To solve this problem, this study proposes an IVMD method based on multi-GNSS combination sea level retrieval. We take energy entropy mutual information (EEMI) as an indicator and the sum of two EEMI modal functions as objective functions to develop the VMD algorithm. Here, we targeted the problem that the traditional VMD method cannot determine the number of decomposed modal functions (IMF) and the value of penalty factors in the denoise process, which leads to an insufficient decomposition or an over-decomposition and causes the loss of part of the effective true information on the basis of the traditional VMD algorithm. Accordingly, the energy entropy mutual information was taken as the objective function, and the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) was used to optimize the objective function. Thus, the number of modal decomposition and the value of the penalty factor are determined adaptively, and the denoise signal is determined by the composite index T. The results of this study show that the sea level retrieval using a multi-GNSS combination based on the IVMD method can further improve the accuracy to <10 cm and can achieve 10 min equal interval sampling. Specifically, the robust regression method combines the retrieval of multiple constellations from multiple signals, whereas the IVMD method combines more input sea level retrievals from GNSS-MR. In other words, the robust regression method relies on internal retrieval consistency to avoid outliers, whereas the IVMD filtering method relies on external constraints and internal retrieval consistency to avoid overall accuracy reduction caused by outliers. In future, our research will try to apply IVMD filtering to LSP retrieval and skip robust regression, which will require allowing the existence of random noise in some prior RH.\nAuthor Contributions: R.L. provided the initial idea; R.L. and H.X. designed the experiments for this study; X.W. and Y.W. analyzed the experiment results; R.L. wrote the paper.
