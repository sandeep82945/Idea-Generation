1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Synthesize a series of metallodendrimers with different bridging ligands and/or dendritic scaffolds to determine how these structural variations affect the cytotoxicity and selectivity of the compounds. This could help to identify key structural features that are responsible for the observed antitumor activity.


2. **Explore the mechanism of action of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Conduct mechanistic studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the metallodendrimers exert their cytotoxic effects. This could involve investigating the interactions of the compounds with DNA, proteins, and other cellular targets, as well as examining the induction of apoptosis or other cell death pathways.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers:** 
Test the most promising metallodendrimers in animal models of cancer to assess their in vivo efficacy and toxicity. This would involve administering the compounds to tumor-bearing animals and monitoring tumor growth, survival, and other relevant parameters.


4. **Investigate the potential of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers for combination therapy:** 
Combine the metallodendrimers with other anticancer agents, such as chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapies, or immunotherapies, to determine if synergistic or additive effects can be achieved. This could lead to the development of more effective and less toxic treatment regimens for cancer.


5. **Explore the use of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers for targeted drug delivery:** 
Modify the metallodendrimers with targeting ligands that can specifically bind to cancer cells or tumor-associated receptors. This could improve the selectivity and efficacy of the compounds by directing them to the desired target cells and reducing systemic toxicity.
