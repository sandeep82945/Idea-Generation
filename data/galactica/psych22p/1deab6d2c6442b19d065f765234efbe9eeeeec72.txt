Objective: Inpatient treatment programs for substance use disorders (SUDs)
typically have an abstinence policy for patients, but unsanctioned substance
use nonetheless takes place and can have significant negative clinical
impacts. The current study sought to understand this problem from a patient
perspective and to develop strategies for improved contraband substance
management in an inpatient concurrent disorders sample. Methods: First, a qualitative study (n = 10; 60% female) was undertaken
to ascertain perceived prevalence, impact, and patient-generated strategies. Second, an anonymous follow-up survey was conducted with unit staff
clinicians to evaluate the suggested strategies. Results: Patients reported that contraband substance use was present and
had significant negative consequences clinically. Recommendations from
patients included more extensive urine drug screening, the use of drug-
sniffing dogs, and direct contingencies for contraband use. Nineteen staff
competed an anonymous follow-up questionnaire to evaluate the viability of
these strategies, revealing variable perceptions of feasibility and effectiveness. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the adverse consequences of
contraband substance use in addiction treatment programs and identify
patient-preferred strategies for managing this challenge. KEYWORDS

Frontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org conclusion This study provides rich patient perspectives on the issue of contraband substance use on an acute concurrent disorders unit. Several strategies were put forward by the patients who participated and were supported by the frontline staff who would be primarily responsible for implementing new policies.
