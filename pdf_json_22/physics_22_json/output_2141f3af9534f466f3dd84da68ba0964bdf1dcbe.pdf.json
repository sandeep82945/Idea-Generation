    "abstractText": "Light activated proteins are at the heart of photobiology and optogenetics, so there is wide interest in understanding the mechanisms coupling optical excitation to protein function. In addition, such light activated proteins provide unique insights into the real-time dynamics of protein function. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, the function of a photoactive protein can be initiated by a sub-100 fs pulse of light, allowing subsequent protein dynamics to be probed from femtoseconds to milliseconds and beyond. Among the most interesting photoactive proteins are the Blue Light Using Flavin (BLUF) domain proteins, which regulate the response to light of a wide range of bacterial and some euglenoid processes. The photosensing mechanism of BLUF domains has long been a subject of debate. In contrast to other photoactive proteins, the electronic and nuclear structure of the chromophore (flavin) is the same in darkand light-adapted states. Thus, the driving force for photoactivity is unclear.",

            "text": "Light activated proteins are at the heart of photobiology and optogenetics, so there is wide interest\nin understanding the mechanisms coupling optical excitation to protein function. In addition, such\nlight activated proteins provide unique insights into the real-time dynamics of protein function.\nUsing pump-probe spectroscopy, the function of a photoactive protein can be initiated by a sub-100\nfs pulse of light, allowing subsequent protein dynamics to be probed from femtoseconds to\nmilliseconds and beyond. Among the most interesting photoactive proteins are the Blue Light Using\nFlavin (BLUF) domain proteins, which regulate the response to light of a wide range of bacterial and\nsome euglenoid processes. The photosensing mechanism of BLUF domains has long been a subject\nof debate. In contrast to other photoactive proteins, the electronic and nuclear structure of the\nchromophore (flavin) is the same in dark- and light-adapted states. Thus, the driving force for\nphotoactivity is unclear.\nTo address this question requires real-time observation of both chromophore excited state\nprocesses and their effect on the structure and dynamics of the surrounding protein matrix. In this\nAccount we describe how time resolved infra-red (IR) experiments, coupled with chemical biology,\nprovides important new insights into the signalling mechanism of BLUF domains. IR measurements\nare sensitive to changes in both chromophore electronic structure and protein hydrogen bonding\ninteractions. These contributions are resolved by isotope labelling chromophore and protein\nseparately. Further, a degree of control over BLUF photochemistry is achieved through mutagenesis,\nwhile unnatural amino acid substitution allows us to both fine tune the photochemistry and time\nresolve protein dynamics with spatial resolution.\nUltrafast studies of BLUF domains reveal non-single exponential relaxation of the flavin excited state.\nThat relaxation leads within one nanosecond to the original flavin ground state bound in a modified\nhydrogen-bonding network, as seen in transient and steady-state IR spectroscopy. The change in H-\nbond configuration arises from formation of an unusual enol (imine) form of a critical glutamine\nresidue. The dynamics observed, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations, suggest a\nunique sequential electron then double proton transfer reaction as the driving force, followed by\nrapid reorganization in the binding site and charge recombination. Importantly, studies of several\nBLUF domains reveal an unexpected diversity in their dynamics, although the underlying structure\nappears highly conserved. It is suggested that this diversity reflects structural dynamics in the\nground state at standard temperature, leading to a distribution of structures and photochemical\noutcomes. Time resolved IR measurements were extended to the millisecond regime for one BLUF\ndomain, revealing signalling state formation on the microsecond timescale. The mechanism involves\nreorganization of a -sheet connected to the chromophore binding pocket via a tryptophan residue.\nThe potential of site-specific labelling amino acids with IR labels as a tool for probing protein\nstructural dynamics was demonstrated.\nIn summary, time-resolved IR studies of BLUF domains (along with related studies at visible\nwavelengths and quantum and molecular dynamics calculations) have resolved the photoactivation\nmechanism and real-time dynamics of signalling state formation. These measurements provide new\ninsights into protein structural dynamics, and will be important in optimising the potential of BLUF\ndomains in optobiology.\nKey References Hall, C.R., Tolentino, J., Iuliano, J.N., Adamczyk, K., Lukacs, A., Greetham, G.

            "text": "Blue Light Using Flavin (BLUF) domain proteins are a family of photoactive flavoproteins found mainly in bacteria but also in eukaryotes.5-8 They act as sensing modules for a range of light-\ncontrolled processes, including bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, biofilm formation, phototaxis and\ncontrolling levels of cyclic-AMP. Consistent with their diverse function, BLUF domains are found in a\nrange of protein structures, either as elements of larger proteins that change structure upon irradiation or in protein complexes that dissociate under illumination.9 Despite this diversity, the\nBLUF domain itself is modular and can be swapped between BLUF containing proteins without loss of function.10 Modularity makes the BLUF domain an attractive element for optogenetics, in which light-sensing proteins are recruited to lend light-activation to specific protein functions.11\nConsequently those functions can be stimulated on demand with spatial and temporal control. Optogenetics is a powerful tool with demonstrated therapeutic potential,11,12 which has added\nurgency to research aiming to understand and optimise operation of BLUF domains.\nPhotoactive flavoproteins are widespread in nature, and three types have been identified: lightoxygen-voltage (LOV) domains; photolyase/cryptochrome family; BLUF domains.7,13 A fourth type, a fatty acid photodecarboxylase, has very recently been identified.14 In each, the chromophore is the\nisoalloxazine moiety of either flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD),\nabsorbing at around 450 nm (oxidized form, Figure 1A). The light-sensing mechanism of the BLUF\ndomains is the least understood. In LOV domains triplet FMN reacts with an adjacent cysteine to form a meta-stable adduct, initiating a change in protein structure.15 In cryptochromes excited FAD\n(FAD*) is photoreduced by electron transfer from a conserved Trp triad, leading to charge separation, proton transfer in plant cryptochromes,16 and subsequent chemical reaction.17 In both\ncases the flavin changes chemical state between dark and light-adapted forms. In contrast, in BLUF\ndomains FAD is fully oxidized in both dark and light-adapted states. The only difference is a 15 nm\nred-shift in the electronic spectrum on formation of the light-adapted state, suggesting a change in\nchromophore environment. This raises the question: what is the driving force for structure change in\nBLUF proteins? Here we describe experiments that probe the BLUF light-sensing mechanism using\ntime-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR), isotope editing and unnatural amino acid (UAA)\nsubstitution. These studies are placed in the context of time-resolved electronic spectroscopy and\nquantum chemical calculations.\n2. BLUF structure and photochemistry\nThe structure of the PixD BLUF domain (a light-sensor for the photophobic response of cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.PCC6803) is shown in Figure 1B.18 The isoalloxazine moiety is\nbound between two -helices, which are aligned parallel to a five-strand -sheet, such that the\nisoalloxazine plane is at right angles to it. The flavin is held in place by multiple H-bonds with\nresidues in the -sheet and -helices. These H-bonding residues are highly conserved, suggesting\nthat the intricate H-bonding network (Figure 1C) is of functional significance. Mutagenesis showed\nthat residues Q50 and Y8 are essential for observation of the characteristic light-activated red-shift. Both are integral to the H-bonding network.19 Direct evidence for light-driven change in this network\nwas provided by vibrational spectroscopy, which showed a red-shift in an FAD mode, assigned to a stronger H-bond with the C4=O carbonyl in the light-adapted state.20 Residues capable of forming H-\nbonds at C4=O include N32, Q50, M93 and W91.\nConfiguration of the Met and Trp residues in dark adapted structures has been the topic of debate\n(Figure 1C,D). The earliest crystal structures, of the BLUF domain protein AppA (AppABLUF, involved in control of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, showed Trp adjacent to the isoalloxazine ring and involved in the H-bonding network; the Win configuration (Figure 1D).21 Later structures suggested Trp is switched out of the H-bonding network (Wout), replaced by Met, yielding a distortion in the -sheet structure (Figure 1C).22 It was suggested that Trp/Met exchange\nmight be the switch between light and dark-adapted states. Most recent structures show a Wout dark-state configuration in AppA, consistent with studies of fluorescence polarisation.23\nTwo crystal structures of light-adapted BLUF domains have been reported. Neither showed evidence\nfor extensive structure change, such as a W/M switch, but both indicated light-induced changes in the 4-5 strands of the -sheet, suggesting their involvement in signalling state formation.22,24 Residues in this region were also perturbed in NMR studies of light and dark-adapted states.25 The most recent study showed light-adaptation was associated with only modest structure changes,26\nreturning the focus to understanding light modulation of the H-bonded network (Figure 1C,D)."

            "text": "Our high sensitivity ultrafast TRIR pump-probe experiments are described elsewhere.27,28 In TRIR the\n450 nm pump\u2212IR probe delay of up to 6 ns is controlled by varying the optical pathlength. In the\ntime-resolved multiple-probe spectroscopy (TRMPS) configuration a separate synchronised 1 kHz\nsource provides the 450 nm pump, and optical and electronic delays combine to yield 10 kHz\nmultiplexed time-delayed IR probe pulses from 100 fs to 1 ms. TRIR is a difference method, so only\nvibrations modified by photoexcitation and subsequent structure changes appear. Vibrational modes\nshifted due to excitation of FAD yield negative signals in difference spectra, while modes of FAD*\nand any photoproducts give positive signals. The frequency and/or intensity of vibrational modes of\nmany amino acids are sensitive to their H-bonding environment, so TRIR/TRMPS experiments track protein structure evolution in real-time from 100 fs to 1 ms.29,30\nThe TRIR spectrum of PixD is shown in Figure 2A.2 There are negative signals (bleaches) at 1700, 1638, 1580 and 1547 cm-1. These were assigned to FAD based on TRIR of FAD or FMN in solution, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotope labelling.31,32 The two\nhighest wavenumber bleaches are C4=O and C2=O stretch modes, coupled to the N3H wag. DFT\nshowed these are not exclusively localised on specific carbonyls. Instead, depending on H-bonding\nenvironment and N3H/D exchange, their character evolves between two localized modes (with C4=O\nat higher wavenumber) and a delocalised O=C4\u2212(N3H)\u2212C2=O symmetric/anti-symmetric pair. This\nfeature is important in understanding the sensitivity of these modes to their H-bonding environment.31 The 1580 and 1547 cm-1 bleaches were assigned to flavin ring modes.\nFAD* contributes positive features appearing instantaneously (i.e. during the <100 fs pump pulse).\nCalculation and assignment of excited state vibrations is less straightforward than for ground states, but there are recent assignments for FAD*.33-36 The transient pair at 1380 and 1420 cm-1 arise from C=C/C=N ring modes of FAD*. The complex set of transients below 1700 cm-1 are calculated to have\ncontributions from FAD* carbonyl modes, but comparison with FAD* in solution37 suggests additional contributions from surrounding protein residues (e.g. at 1623 cm-1).\nTurning to temporal evolution (Figure 2A), the FAD* transient at 1380 cm-1 decays with non-single-\nexponential kinetics, and a mean lifetime of 87 ps. Since the fluorescence lifetime of FMN* in aqueous solution is 4.5 ns,38 picosecond decay indicates efficient quenching in PixD (the lifetime of\nFAD in aqueous solution is much shorter, but that reflects intramolecular quenching by the adenine\nmoiety, which plays no role in BLUF domains, as it is usually anchored at the protein solution interface, Figure 1B). The intense bleach at 1547 cm-1 is a good indicator of ground state recovery,\nwhich occurs with a mean time of 137 ps, slower than FAD* decay. This is characteristic of\nintermediate state kinetics, and TRIR resolves the intermediates as a pair of transients at 1515 and\n1535 cm-1, which initially rise and then decay. One plausible FAD* quenching mechanism is electron\ntransfer, which is often observed in flavoproteins, independent of whether they are photoactive or not.39 The mechanism is charge separation (CS) between adjacent Tyr (or Trp)-FAD* pairs to form Y\u25cf+ and FAD\u25cf\u2212 (although subsequent proton transfer may occur). The BLUF structure (Figure 1B-D) shows Tyr (and possibly Trp) residues near the chromophore. To assign the 1515/1535 cm-1 modes we synthesised a model compound for the neutral radical FADH\u25cf and studied its TRIR, observing a strong ground state bleach at 1528 cm-1,40 which supports electron transfer as the quenching step in PixD, with FADH\u25cf as the 1535 cm-1 intermediate.41 The same conclusion was reached in transient optical absorption measurements,42,43 but overlap of the broad FAD* and radical spectra,\nnecessitated sophisticated kinetic analysis.\nGiven the obvious formation and decay of intermediates, the TRIR data were globally analysed\nassuming sequential kinetics. Global analysis fits the spectral evolution to a sum of first order kinetic steps and recovers a set of Evolution Associated Difference Spectra (EADS).44 Three intermediates\nand one final component were required for an adequate fit (Figure 2B). The fastest step (2.5 ps) showed a rise of the 1515 cm-1 transient, followed by a 20 ps rise at 1535cm-1, with both decaying\nwith time constants of 110 ps and 525 ps. The existence of two radical intermediates in the PixD TRIR suggests sequential electron then proton transfer steps, TyrOH-FAD*\u2192TyrOH\u25cf+-FAD\u25cf\u2212\u2192TyrO\u25cfFADH\u25cf; this mechanism features prominently in theoretical calculations of the BLUF mechanism\n(below) and is represented schematically in Figure 3. Note that multi-exponential kinetics point to\ninhomogeneity in ground-state population.\nThe final EADS (Figure 2B) is significant as it reveals a persistent change in structure associated with\nformation of the light-adapted state. The most prominent feature is a positive/negative pair at 1690 cm-1 indicating a shift to lower wavenumber of a carbonyl mode of FAD. This occurs within 500 ps,\nbut after the radical species recombine. The shift suggests stronger H-bonding to a flavin C4=O in the\narrow) occurs in seconds to minutes.\nlight-adapted state arising within 1 ns consistent with transient electronic spectroscopy and steady state IR.43,45\n4. Diversity in BLUF photodynamics.\nWhile it is established that BLUF domains are modular, their photocycles exhibit variation; light to dark recovery of PixD takes seconds, but in AppABLUF it takes fifteen minutes.5 Similar diversity was found in primary process. In contrast to PixD, early studies of AppABLUF failed to identify radical intermediates, although FAD* decay was non-exponential and quenched (mean decay time was 255 ps).46,47 In contrast, the photoinactive Y21W mutant of AppABLUF (equivalent to Y8 in PixD) showed typical radical intermediate features associated with FAD\u25cf\u2212 (at 1521 cm-1), presumably arising\nbecause CS in Trp/FAD* is more energetically favourable than for Tyr.4,48 Thus, radical intermediates\nare readily observable in AppABLUF, but are not observed during formation of its light-adapted state.\nThe only indication of light-activated structure change in AppABLUF was a transient at ca 1666 cm-1 formed during the excitation pulse (Figure 4A).46 Although an FAD* carbonyl might contribute here, no such mode was observed for FAD* in solution,37 or in the light-adapted state of AppABLUF or a photoinactive mutant Q63L. Thus the 1666 cm-1 transient was assigned to a mode of an amino acid residue instantaneously perturbed by electronic excitation. This assignment was confirmed by 13C\nlabelling the apoprotein. One candidate is Q63 (equivalent to Q50 in PixD), which is essential for\nlight-activation, and forms an H-bond with N5 in the dark-state (Figure1D). To test this the Q63E mutant was studied.49 Replacing Gln with Glu allows the H-bond network of AppABLUF to be retained, but the C=O mode of the Glu sidechain will be shifted relative to Gln. Electronic excitation of Q63E indeed resulted in a new instantaneous bleach at 1724 cm-1, with a corresponding transient at 1704 cm-1. The 1724 cm-1 bleach was assigned to the carbonyl of the Glu RCOOH side chain (confirmed by 13C labelling). A stable protonated Glu carboxylate sidechain suggests a change in pKa in the flavin binding pocket, compared to aqueous solution. That the Glu C=O mode shifts to 1704 cm-1 on FAD*\nformation points to weakening of the C=O bond, indicating increased H-bond strength with N5 on\nFAD* formation. The instantaneous transient appearance shows that changes in the H-bonding\nnetwork can be induced by changes in electronic state alone, without major reorganisation of\nnuclear structure.\nThere are two plausible explanations for the failure to observe radical intermediates in AppABLUF. First, observation is kinetically restricted, because charge recombination (CR) is much faster than CS.43 A consequence would be a very short-lived CS state, restricting the extent of nuclear\nreorganisation possible during the intermediate lifetime. Second, electron transfer in PixD is incidental to mechanism (as it is in many photo-inactive flavoproteins39,50) and a neutral pathway,\ndriven by changes in the H-bond network alone, is sufficient for BLUF light-state formation.\nTo test the hypothesis that electron transfer in AppABLUF occurs with rate limiting CS, UAA substitution was employed. The putative donor, Y21, was exchanged for a series of fluorotyrosines (FY), modifying the redox potential and pKa.4 Under the assumption of CS being the primary step, and assuming applicability of a simple Marcus model in the normal region, the prediction was that\nthe CS rate would increase when Y21 was exchanged for 2-or 3-FY due to the change in redox\npotential. In contrast, a threefold decrease in FAD* decay rate was observed. The same experiment\nin PixD led to slower CS, consistent with the faster PixD reaction being in the Marcus inverted region.2 Thus modulation of electron transfer by FY substitution in PixD was consistent with its obvious CS reaction, but inconsistent with CS in AppABLUF.4 Ultrafast data on six BLUF domains were reviewed.2 In three examples PixD, OaPAC (a light-controlled adenylyl cyclase from Oscillatoria acuminata) and PapB51 (from purple bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which controls biofilm\nformation) radical intermediates were observed, while in three others, AppA, BlrB (from\nRhodobacter sphaeroides, a small BLUF domain of unknown function) and BlsA (from Acinetobacter baumannii, a regulator influencing a number of light sensitive processes) none were detected.52,53\nThis suggests the existence of at least two classes of BLUF domain with distinct kinetics.\nConsideration of protein structure and/or sequence suggests radical intermediates are observed\nwhen two amino acids can H-bond to C2=O, but absent when there is only one H-bonding partner\n(see Figs 1C,D). It would be interesting to investigate this hypothesis in other BLUF domains, and\nseek a role for C2=O H-bonding on CS.\nThere is ambiguity in modulation of reduction potential by FYs, as Tyr fluorination modifies both redox potential and pKa (hence H-bond interactions).54 FY exchange effects on TRIR were extended to three different BLUF domains (AppABLUF, PixD and OaPAC) (Figure 4). The exchange does not perturb the main features of the BLUF domain ground state i.e. the bleach modes associated with\nthe isoalloxazine ring are unchanged (Figure 4). However, as the pKa of YF reduces formation of the light-adapted state (indicated by a red-shift in the C=O mode) is suppressed. It is likely that as Tyr pKa reduces the critical H-bond network is disrupted and the Tyr may be deprotonated at the lowest pKa.\nFigure 4 also provides further evidence of BLUF domain diversity. In AppABLUF the effect of FY exchange on FAD* is an increase in mean lifetime as pKa decreases, with subnanosecond (quenched) components lengthening and decreasing in weight.4 In PixD, the red-shifted C4=O is only formed\nwith 2-FY, which has the smallest pKa change. When the red-shifted C4=O state is absent there is no radical intermediate at 1520-35 cm-1, but FAD* is still quenched (Figure 4B). In OaPAC (Figure 4C)\nradical and product formation are suppressed for larger pKa shifts, as for PixD, but FAD* quenching is also suppressed, to the extent that the triplet state of FAD* is formed. These data highlight the key\nroles of the H-bond network and proton transfer in formation of the light adapted state. At lower\npKa formation of tyrosinate could occur and promote electron transfer (consistent with assignment of the 1515 cm-1 transient to FAD\u25cf\u221255) but stable light-adapted states cannot form."

            "text": "The absence of radical intermediates in AppABLUF led us to consider possible neutral pathways to the light-adapted state (Figure 3).46,49 The 1666 cm-1 transient assigned to Q63 was proposed to result\nfrom side chain keto-enol (or equivalently amide-imide) tautomerization, leading to ultrafast H-bond\nreorganization around C4=O, initially without nuclear reorganisation. Stabilising the light-adapted\nstate after FAD* decay requires nuclear structure change, proposed to be rotation of the Q63 tautomer. The eventual decay of the 1666 cm-1 mode as the red-shifted state formed was assigned\nto relaxation of the unstable enol back to the keto form; the mechanism is illustrated in Figure 5. A\nrole for Q63 rotation in stabilising the light-adapted state was proposed earlier, where electron transfer was the driving force and Gln retained the keto form.21,42 The pathway in Figure 5 is\nconsistent with absence of a CS state in AppABLUF, although the origin of enol tautomer stability is unclear.\nDomratcheva et al56 and Saghdegian et al57 proposed a role for keto-enol tautomerization on the\nbasis of theoretical calculations. They calculated that red-shifts in electronic and IR absorption were\nreproduced by formation of the Q63 enol, and that keto-enol tautomerization was accompanied by\nrestructuring of the H-bond network. The driving force was electron transfer from Y21 to flavin,\nfollowed by proton transfer from the Y21 phenol to Q63, as seen in PixD TRIR (but not AppABLUF). Since these original observations Gln tautomerization has become an important feature of\ntheoretical and experimental studies of BLUF domains.\nTwo recent studies investigated Gln tautomerization, combining IR difference spectroscopy, isotope labelling and computation. Domratcheva et al computed light-state spectra for unlabelled and 15N labelled Gln in BlrB and compared the result with IR difference measurements.58 Data were\nconsistent with Wout and Gln oriented with its carbonyl H-bonded to Y9. Electronic excitation results in electron and proton transfers such that the Gln enol forms with OH and NH both H-bonded to the C4=O. Iwata et al studied 15N and 13C labelled AppABLUF, and concluded that light-state formation\nrequires tautomerization and rotation of Gln, but that this state was stable with Win.59 They also reported a downshifted frequency of a phenolic OH, consistent with a Tyr-enol H-bond, which was reproduced in a computational study.60 While there are differences in detail between these studies\n(which investigated different BLUF domains) evidence of a role for Gln tautomerization is\ncompelling. Both require the usually unstable enol tautomer to persist for the lifetime of the light-\nstate (tens of minutes in AppABLUF), which is remarkable, requiring the light-adapted state to be rigid (which further suggests relaxation of the 1666 cm-1 transient (Figure 5) reflects enol rotation rather than relaxation to keto46).\n6. Comparison to calculations.\nFurther mechanistic detail followed from quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations of experimental data.61-67 Most calculations accurately reproduce electronic and IR spectral shifts on\nlight-state formation by assuming Gln enol formation leading to a new H-bond network, and usually\nincluding Gln rotation. Calculation of excited state relaxation yields data comparable to ultrafast experiments. Initially the locally excited (LE) state of FAD* is stable, with a Tyr\u25cf+\u2212FAD\u25cf\u2212 CS state at\nhigher energy. Calculations suggest that structural evolution in the LE state and nuclear\nreorganisation in the protein stabilises the CT state, such that it crosses the LE state and electron\ntransfer occurs. Details vary and a number of relaxation pathways and structures have been\nconsidered, but key parameters are nuclear reorganization in the isoalloxazine ring, electrostatic interactions with the FAD* charge distribution and Tyr\u2013FAD distance.61-67 Importantly, for CS to be\nrapid (as suggested by experiment) most pathways require a specific geometry of the conserved Gln.\nThe Gln geometry which stabilises the CT state is also well aligned for protonation of its carbonyl by the very acidic Tyr\u25cf+ proton. This proton transfer is followed by a second to FAD\u25cf\u2212, to yield the enol\nand a neutral radical pair. Most recent calculations suggest rotation of the enol to make an H-bond\nat C4=O. CR recovers the fully oxidized form of FAD but now in the metastable light-adapted state.\nThe final reorganisation requires at least a several picosecond lifetime for the diradical state. This\nequilibria as suggested by calculations and which may suppress radical population. {i/j} implies\ndynamics equilibria for W and Q orientations. Arrow indicates Q orientation. (k) or (e) indicated keto\nor enol forms of Q respectively.\nmechanism (Figure 6A) is consistent with TRIR measurement in PixD (Figure 2) and OaPAC (Figure 4) and a recent light-adapted crystal structure.26\nAn explanation for the absence of detectable radical intermediates in several BLUF domains is\nrequired. Calculation has not yet found an energetically accessible route for the mechanistically feasible neutral pathway to the Gln tautomer.46,49 The explanation of rate determining CS and fast\nCR was contradicted by FY data and the requirement for a several picosecond lifetime in the CS state.4 A possible explanation lies in the inhomogeneous FAD* kinetics (a feature of all ultrafast studies of BLUF domains)42,46 and the dynamic FAD binding site suggested by calculations.61,67\nDomratcheva established that the key Gln residue rotates freely over a low barrier even in the darkstate, so different conformers exist at room temperature.61 Hammes-Schiffer et al showed that (i)\nGln reorients in the dark-state of AppABLUF on a nanosecond timescale and is coupled to location of\nthe conserved Tyr and (ii) that the Trp/Met exchange can be thermally activated over a barrier of ca 50 kJmol-1, suggesting both conformers exist; Win was slightly more stable than Wout. Further, Win can adopt two distinct orientations, only one of which supports the electron and proton transfer.66,67\nThus, residues around the flavin adopt a number of structures that may quench the excited state\nwith a range of rates and mechanisms, but not lead to photactivation, consistent with non-single exponential FAD* decay. Formation of the Y\u25cf+-FAD\u25cf\u2212 (hence the light-adapted state) requires a\nspecific geometry which must also support proton transfer. Thus, the rate-determining step may be\nfluctuations in the FAD environment to generate structures competent for CS and proton relay.\nThese ideas are incorporated into the kinetic scheme shown in Figure 6, where fluctuations \u2018gate\u2019\nthe reaction in either ground or excited state (Figure 6B). Such a scheme allows photoexcitation of\n\u2018activated\u2019 ground state geometries, and subsequent CS, enol formation (consistent with instantaneous appearance of the 1666 cm-1 transient) and rotation while maintaining overall low concentrations of the radical intermediates compared to bleached flavin.4,46 Thus, the distinction\nbetween BLUF domains that do and do not show radical intermediates may be population of ground\nstates competent to undergo CS and proton transfer. BLUF domains with prominent radical\nintermediates have more stable (or frequently accessed) geometries for light-state formation, and\npossible higher light-adapted state yields. The BLUF domain dependent effects of FY exchange\n(Figure 4) and mutagenesis may be to modify both photochemistry and ground state dynamics. An\nimportant test of this hypothesis will be measurements of the relative quantum efficiency of\ndifferent BLUF domains; such measurements are planned.\n7. Dark-adapted to signalling state: optical allostery.\nThe red-shifted light-adapted state formed in <1 ns is not the final signalling state. Local changes in\nthe flavin H-bonding network must translate into structure changes in the -sheet, modulating, for\nexample, the affinity of the BLUF domain for output partner proteins. It is of general interest to\ndynamics suppressed. Adapted with permission from ref. 3 (2013) ACS.\nfollow such allosteric structure changes in real time, as they are a key feature of many protein\nfunctions.\nStructural evolution in AppABLUF was measured from <1 ps to >100 s by TRMPS.3 Most spectral changes are complete in 10 ns, but evolution in a 1622/1631 cm-1 bleach/transient pair and a\ntransient/bleach pair associated with C4=O continues for microseconds (Figure 7A). Assignment of the former to protein amide I modes was confirmed by 13C labelling, and the wavenumber implies the change is in -sheet residues. Lineshape evolution for the 1622/1631 cm-1 pair suggests a time\ndependent spectral shift to higher wavenumber (e.g. loosening of H-bonds). However, kinetic\nanalysis (Figure 7B) reveals a more complex picture; the transient evolves faster than the bleach,\nsuggesting complex non-single exponential kinetics and the involvement of more than one residue.\nFurther, although evolution in the C4=O pair was of low amplitude, it had a separate timescale to the 1622 cm-1 bleach. Thus, after formation of the red-shifted state there is structural evolution on\ndistinct microsecond timescales modifying the -sheet (some 10\u00c5 from Q63) and the H-bond\nnetwork around the flavin.\nThese measurements were extended to W104A and M106A mutants of AppABLUF.3 Both show formation of red-shifted C4=O, but reversion to the dark-state is accelerated in W104A.68 In vivo\nW104A acts as if locked in a light-adapted structure. Both factors suggest involvement of W104 in signalling state formation.69,70 In line with this, W104A mutation has a large effect on TRMPS data (Figure 7C). The 1631 cm-1 transient appears within 10 ns, but the 1622 cm-1 bleach appears only\nweakly. Thus in W104A perturbation to the -sheet does not develop, confirming W104\u2019s role in\nsignal propagation. In contrast the transient/bleach associated with C4=O develops more strongly\nthan in AppABLUF and within 10 ns. Thus, formation of the red-shifted state is enhanced and\naccelerated by W104 mutation, but communication of photoexcitation to the -sheet is suppressed.\nM106A, was qualitatively similar to AppABLUF, presenting no evidence for its role in allostery.\nTRIR reveals allosteric dynamics, but the level of detail is limited; Figure 7A shows that -sheet is\nperturbed, but not which residues. Ideally, one would like single residue resolution to track allosteric\ndynamics. Residue selective isotope labelling is possible, but usually all occurrences of the residue"

An\nalternative is to employ UAA substitution to exchange one occurrence of a residue for an \u2018IR beacon\u2019\nsuch as cyano- or azidophenylalanine (AzPhe). These probes are site specific and absorb strongly in blank regions of the IR spectrum; they are widely applied in steady state protein IR.71-73\nWe incorporated AzPhe in AppABLUF/PixD in place of W104/91 and M106/93.1 Results were complicated by the complex lineshape of AzPhe, but revealed a number of new features (Figure 8).\nOn replacing W104/91 the azido mode responds instantaneously to electronic excitation, suggesting\ndirect involvement of this residue in the H-bonding network (e.g. via Q63/50). The azido mode\nsubsequently evolves on a bi-exponential timescale, with kinetics similar to FAD* decay. In PixD\nM93AzPhe showed a weaker response than W91 but a similar timescale, while in AppABLUF M106AzPhe response was very weak. These preliminary studies highlight the potential of \u2018IR\nbeacons\u2019 for tracking allosteric dynamics.\n8. Dark-state recovery.\nThe BLUF photocycle is completed by recovery from signalling to dark-state, which takes seconds to\ntens of minutes, depending on the BLUF domain. This recovery phase has been less investigated,\nalthough Masuda and co-workers showed it was slower in D2O than H2O, indicating a role for proton tunnelling in the rate determining step, and that W104A mutation accelerated recovery.5\nWe probed the recovery mechanism through exchange of Y21/Y8 in AppABLUF/PixD for a series of FY derivatives, modifying the Tyr pKa.2,74 In contrast to the forward reaction, the recovery is well represented by a single exponential (Figure 9A). The kinetic isotope effect is >5 in all cases,\nconsistent with proton tunnelling. Even in cases where the characteristic red-shift of the C4=O mode\nwas absent from EAS (Figure 4) the absorption red-shift can be observed (Figure 9B). However, as\nthe pKa of Y21/8 is decreased the stability (or yield) of the red-shifted state is greatly reduced,\nfavouring a photostationary state closer to the dark-state. This may reflect an effect of Tyr pKa on the population of ground state orientations competent to undergo CS (Figure 6B).\nFigure 9C shows a Br\u00f8nsted plot for the recovery rate constant, k. The effect of Y21 pKa on AppABLUF is remarkable, a ca 900 fold acceleration over the pKa range 9.0-7.2, in sharp contrast to the forward\nphotoreaction. Further, the slope is close to 1 suggesting a transition state in which the H-bond is\nessentially broken. It is difficult to ascertain which H-bond is involved, as it depends in part on the\nstructure of the red-shifted state, which is unresolved. Interestingly the larger rate constant for\nrecovery in PixD was less sensitive to Y8 pKa, increasing by a factor of 15 across the range. Further the slope of the Br\u00f8nsted plot for PixD was between 0.43 (H2O) and 0.28 (D2O) suggesting less proton transfer in the transition state, consistent with mechanistic diversity among BLUF domains.\n8. Conclusions Photoactivated protein function combined with TRIR allows the study of real time\nprotein dynamics. The complete photocycle of BLUF domains has been observed, from <1 ps to >1\nks. Application of a battery of spectroscopic and theoretical methods clarified the mechanism of\nBLUF domain photoactivation. The most likely route is electron and double proton transfer in the\nFAD-Gln-Tyr triad leading to Gln in its enol form, generating the red-shifted state and modified H-\nbond network. Most data point to Gln being rotated in the light-adapted state, but there are\nexperimental data and calculations to the contrary, so this is still to be unambiguously resolved.\nSignificant diversity among BLUF domains exists, and accounting for it suggests further levels of\ncomplexity. In particular, protein dynamics in the ground state feed into photochemical dynamics.\nThis complexity presents new challenges, but warrants investigation. It is likely that the complexity\nresolved in BLUF domains is the rule rather than the exception in functional protein dynamics. It is\nevident in BLUF domains because of the high signal-to-noise and time resolution attained. Thus,\nBLUF domain photodynamics will remain an excellent model system for observation and calculation\nof protein dynamics.\nFormation of the red-shifted state is not the end of the story. In AppABLUF protein dynamics are observed on a microsecond timescale, assigned to allostery leading to the signalling state. This\nobservation yields new mechanistic detail, which was refined using mutagenesis and UAA exchange\nfor IR beacons. The combination of light-activated proteins, TRIR, UAA exchange and QMMM\ncalculations is a powerful probe of allostery."
