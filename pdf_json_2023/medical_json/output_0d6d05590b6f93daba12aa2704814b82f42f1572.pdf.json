    "abstractText": "Background: Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-\u03b2-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side chains, leading to the disassembly of the extracellular matrix, facilitating cell invasion and metastasis dissemination. In this research, we investigated the role of a new HPSE inhibitor, RDS 3337, in the regulation of the autophagic process and the balance between apoptosis and autophagy in U87 glioblastoma cells. Methods: After treatment with RDS 3337, cell lysates were analyzed for autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins by Western blot. Results: We observed, firstly, that LC3II expression increased in U87 cells incubated with RDS 3337, together with a significant increase of p62/SQSTM1 levels, indicating that RDS 3337 could act through the inhibition of autophagic-lysosomal flux of LC3-II, thereby leading to accumulation of lipidated LC3-II form. Conversely, the suppression of autophagic flux could activate apoptosis mechanisms, as revealed by the activation of caspase 3, the increased level of cleaved Parp1, and DNA fragmentation. Conclusions: These findings support the notion that HPSE promotes autophagy, providing evidence that RDS 3337 blocks autophagic flux. It indicates a role for HPSE inhibitors in the balance between apoptosis and autophagy in U87 human glioblastoma cells, suggesting a potential role for this new class of compounds in the control of tumor",

            "text": "The endo-\u03b2-glucuronidase heparanase (HPSE) is the primary enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) side chains linked to proteoglycan core proteins, leading to the disassembly of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This event is therefore involved in the main biological phenomena associated with tissue remodeling and cell invasion, including inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis [1\u20134]. HPSE is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a precursor of 68 kDa, which, in the Golgi, is then processed in proHPSE (65 kDa). After secretion in the extracellular space as a latent 65-kDa enzyme, HPSE rapidly interacts with membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), such as syndecans [5,6] for being endocytosed and processed into a highly active 50-kDa enzyme [7]. HPSE has been shown to reside primarily within endocytic vesicles, and it assumes a polar, perinuclear localization colocalizing with lysosomal markers [8]. Recent studies have identified cathepsin L, a lysosomal protease, responsible for the processing and activation of HPSE [9,10]. Activated HPSE may have different destinations in the cell; it can be secreted, included in autophagosomes, shuttled into the nucleus, or anchored on the surface of exosomes [11\u201313].\nCells 2023, 12, 1891. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12141891 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nPrevious studies illustrated that HPSE expression is increased in different types of tumors (i.e., carcinomas and sarcomas) and hematologic malignancies [3,14\u201316]. The role of HPSE in the development of cancers is mainly due to its degradation activity of HS, which facilitates metastasis dissemination and cell invasion. HPSE has been proven to be involved in the autophagy process since it is kept in lysosomes following secretion [12]. Several studies provide evidence that enhanced tumor growth and chemoresistance exerted by HPSE are mediated, in part, by increasing autophagy. A role for HPSE inside the cell has been described, especially regarding its non-enzymatic activity that plays an essential role in regulating a variety of biological functions [17,18]. Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism through which cytoplasmic contents, including macromolecules or organelles, are sequestered into autophagosomes, which are double-membrane vesicles. After their fusion with lysosomes, the intracellular material is degraded and recycled [19\u201322]. In the setting of cancer, the function of the autophagic process is complex. Whereas some studies prove that autophagy can be beneficial for tumor cell survival [23,24], others indicate that the self-degradative process may prevent tumor growth during the early stages of tumorigenesis [25,26]. Since the elevation of HPSE expression in cancer is often associated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis, this has encouraged the development of HPSE inhibitors [27,28]. HPSE can be defined as a multifunctional protein that is involved in the establishment and development of numerous diseases. Once inactivated, there are no other enzymes capable of performing the same function. It is evident that HPSE can be an effective and promising therapy target. Several HPSE inhibitors were identified in the last two decades that were able to neutralize extracellular HPSE and decrease its intracellular contents [27,29]. These range from monoclonal antibodies, heparin derivatives and polysulfated oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. However, despite the intensive efforts in this field of research, no compounds capable of inhibiting or modulating HPSE activity have reached the clinical stage, while only four drugs have entered the clinical trials as anticancer agents. These polysulfated polysaccharides show several limits, mainly related to their heterogeneous nature and high molecular weight, thus hindering the characterization, standardization, evaluation of biological data, and patient compliance, due to their parental administration route. Differently, the development of small molecule compounds is more encouraging, given that they can overcome some limits of polysaccharides. Indeed, small molecules, owing to their small size, are highly advantageous thanks to their ability to hit both extracellular and intracellular targets\u2014as they can easily cross the cellular plasma membrane\u2014their more suitable pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the capability of being optimized for oral administration. Moreover, small molecules can be easily and cheaply synthesized, and most of the drugs generated by pharmaceutical companies are still small molecules [30]. Previously, several asymmetrical and symmetrical small molecule derivatives characterized by a benzazolyl-5-acetate scaffold were synthesized and described as potent HPSE inhibitors endowed with nanomolar/micromolar potencies [31,32]. Among them, the symmetrical benzazole compounds were found more effective in inhibiting HPSE with respect to the compounds characterized by an asymmetrical shape. In particular, in this study, we used the symmetrical inhibitor RDS 3337 (Figure 1), characterized by a benzoxazol-5-yl acetic acid scaffold functionalized with a central thiourea moiety and a glycine residue, and endowed with high anti-HPSE activity in the nanomolar range (80 nM). It is worthy of note that, while RDS 3337 is less potent than roneparstat, one of the most potent inhibitors of HPSE described (that is, in clinical trials), the amount potentially needed for clinical use could be about half of that of roneparstat, due to their enormous difference in molecular weight. Of interest, it has been shown that this compound was able to reduce the in vitro invasive ability of human glioblastoma cell lines (U87), although the underlying mechanisms involved are not completely clear.

Human glioblastoma U87 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 \u00b0C in a humified 5% CO2 atmosphere. All experiments were carried out using cells split no more than seven times. For autophagy induction, RPE1 cells were stimulated under the condition of nutrient deprivation with Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma H9269) for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C. The optimal incubation time with HBSS was selected on the basis of preliminary experiments.

Then, cells were treated with different concentrations of RDS 3337 (80, 320, 1280 nM) for an incubation time of 24, 48, or 72 h. Vehicle-treated cells or cells incubated with RDS 3337 were analyzed by Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) assay to assess cell viability.

            "text": "It is known that HPSE has been recently shown to play a role in the autophagy of cancer cells, leading to chemoresistance and tumor progression. Thus, in this study, we first examined HPSE inhibitor RDS 3337 effects on human non-cancer neuro-ectodermal cell line RPE-1, which represents a non-transformed alternative to cancer cell lines. With this aim, we used the HPSE inhibitor RDS 3337, a compound with high anti-HPSE activity, showing nanomolar potency, with an IC50 value of 80 nM. First of all, we tested the cytotoxic effect of RDS 3337 under our experimental conditions, using both Trypan Blue and 2- (4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, and monosodium salt (WST-1) assays. RPE-1 cells were treated with RDS 3337 at different concentrations (80\u20131280 nM) and analyzed by both cell counting and cell viability, as shown in Figure 2A,B. Since the highest concentration (1280 nM) showed a significantly higher cytotoxic effect, as revealed by Trypan Blue, as well as by WST-1 assay, we selected the dose of 320 nM.\nSimilar findings were found using the BrdU assay (Figure 2C). Next, to explore the effect of HPSE inhibitor RDS 3337 on the expression of the\nautophagic marker microtubule-associated protein1 light chain 3 (LC3), we employed immunoblotting analysis in RDS 3337-treated and untreated RPE-1 cells. As shown in\nFigure 2D, the analysis revealed a mild but significant increase of LC3 II after incubation with 320 nM RDS 3337 for 18 h or 72 h. Quantitative analysis confirmed these data (Figure 2D, see histograms). This finding suggests an accumulation of autophagosomes [34]. As expected, when cells were stimulated with HBSS for 16 h at 37 \u25e6C for autophagy induction, the analysis revealed an increase of LC3 II levels together with a significant decrease\nof p62/SQSTM1 levels, as confirmed by densitometric analysis. This finding indicates the activation of the autophagic flux [34]. On the contrary, when HBSS pre-treated cells were successively exposed to RDS 3337 (18 h or 72 h), the increase of LC3 II was accompanied by a significant enhancement of p62/SQSTM1 levels (Figure 2D, see histograms), indicating an impairment of the autophagic clearance. Indeed, p62/SQSTM1 is a selective autophagy receptor, which sequesters ubiquitinated proteins into autophagosome vesicles by interacting with LC3. Moreover, since p62 is a substrate for autophagic degradation, its degradation can represent a marker of autophagic clearance.\nCells\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 15\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSupplementary\u00a0Figure\u00a0S2.\u00a0As\u00a0expected,\u00a0this\u00a0methodological\u00a0approach\u00a0is\u00a0less\u00a0sensitive\u00a0as\u00a0 compared\u00a0to\u00a0Western\u00a0blot\u00a0for\u00a0this\u00a0test.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0sum,\u00a0these\u00a0findings\u00a0indicate\u00a0that\u00a0HPSE\u00a0inhibitor\u00a0RDS\u00a03337\u00a0induces\u00a0a\u00a0significant\u00a0 increase\u00a0of\u00a0Cyto-ID\u00a0staining,\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0level\u00a0of\u00a0p62/SQSTM1\u00a0in\u00a0RPE-1\u00a0cells\u00a0pre-treated\u00a0 with\u00a0HBSS,\u00a0suggestive\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0autophagosomes\u00a0accumulation\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0consistent\u00a0arrest\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 autophagic\u00a0flux.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a02.\u00a0HPSE\u00a0inhibitor\u00a0RDS\u00a03337\u00a0promotes\u00a0LC3-II\u00a0and\u00a0p62/SQSTM1\u00a0accumulation\u00a0in\u00a0RPE-1\u00a0cells.\u00a0 RPE-1\u00a0cells\u00a0were\u00a0cultured\u00a0with\u00a080,\u00a0320,\u00a0or\u00a01280\u00a0nM\u00a0RDS\u00a03337\u00a0for\u00a024,\u00a048,\u00a0or\u00a072\u00a0h.\u00a0(A)\u00a0The\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0 viable\u00a0cells\u00a0was\u00a0assessed\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0Trypan\u00a0Blue\u00a0exclusion\u00a0 test.\u00a0Data\u00a0are\u00a0reported\u00a0as\u00a0 the\u00a0mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0 among\u00a0five\u00a0independent\u00a0experiments.\u00a0Statistical\u00a0analysis\u00a0indicated:\u00a0***\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001\u00a0versus\u00a0vehicle.\u00a0(B)\u00a0 Cell\u00a0 viability\u00a0 was\u00a0 measured\u00a0 by\u00a0 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2htetrazolium,\u00a0monosodium\u00a0salt\u00a0(WST-1)\u00a0assay.\u00a0Data\u00a0are\u00a0reported\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0 (SD)\u00a0among\u00a0five\u00a0independent\u00a0experiments.\u00a0Statistical\u00a0analysis\u00a0indicated:\u00a0*\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.05,\u00a0**\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.005,\u00a0***\u00a0p\u00a0 <\u00a0 0.001\u00a0 versus\u00a0 vehicle.\u00a0 We\u00a0 consider\u00a0 cells\u00a0 with\u00a0 only\u00a0 DMSO\u00a0 as\u00a0 vehicle-treated\u00a0 cells.\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 Cell\u00a0 proliferation\u00a0was\u00a0 analyzed\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0BrdU\u00a0 incorporation\u00a0method.\u00a0Three\u00a0 independent\u00a0 experiments\u00a0 were\u00a0performed,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0quantitative\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0percentage\u00a0of\u00a0BrdU+\u00a0cells\u00a0 is\u00a0shown.\u00a0Data\u00a0are\u00a0 reported\u00a0as\u00a0mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0(SD).\u00a0***\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0versus\u00a0vehicle\u00a0and\u00a0****\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001\u00a0versus\u00a0 vehicle.\u00a0(D)\u00a0RPE-1\u00a0cells,\u00a0untreated\u00a0or\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a0320\u00a0nM\u00a0RDS\u00a03337\u00a0for\u00a018\u00a0or\u00a072\u00a0h,\u00a0were\u00a0lysed\u00a0in\u00a0 lysis\u00a0buffer.\u00a0RPE-1\u00a0cells\u00a0were\u00a0starved\u00a0with\u00a0HBSS\u00a0for\u00a016\u00a0h,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0autophagic\u00a0flux\u00a0was\u00a0monitored\u00a0in\u00a0 igure 2.

The samples\nwere analyzed by Western blot, using rabbit anti-LC3 pAb or rabbit anti-SQSTM1 mAb. Anti-actin mAb was used as a loading control. A representative experiment among the three is shown.

Cells were starved with HBSS for 16 h, or treated with 320 nM RDS3337 for 72 h, and the autophagic flux was monitored in the presence or absence of 100 nM Baf A1. At the end of treatment, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after single staining with a Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit. To detect p62/SQSTM1 levels, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilization by 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, with anti-p62/SQSTM1, followed by anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488. The bar graph reports the mean \u00b1 SD obtained in three independent experiments. * p < 0.05 versus vehicle, ** p < 0.005 versus vehicle, *** p < 0.0001 versus vehicle, **** p < 0.0001 versus vehicle.\nTo discriminate between autophagy inducers and blockers, we blocked autophagy with bafilomycin A1 after treatment and evaluated the content of LC3B-II and p62/SQSTM1 by Western blot. Thus, as the control of autophagy flux, RPE-1 cells were treated with BafA1. As expected, cells treated with HBSS and successively with BafA1 displayed a significant accumulation of LC3-II together with a significant increase of p62/SQSTM1 in comparison with control cells (Figure 2D), indicating a block of the autophagic flux [34]. Of interest, also in samples incubated with BafA1 after RDS 3337 treatment for 18 h or 72 h, a significant accumulation of LC3-II, accompanied by a significant increase of p62/SQSTM1, was found (Figure 2D). This finding indicates an effect of the compound in the block of the autophagic flux. Western blot results obtained, as above, were also confirmed by flow cytometry, using Cyto-ID and anti-p62/SQSTM1 Ab. Following treatment with RDS 3337, the analysis revealed a significant increase in Cyto-ID staining, which indicates autophagosome formation, with a high level of p62/SQSTM1, indicating a blockage of the autophagic flux. These findings confirmed an accumulation of autophagosomes [34]. In parallel, cells stimulated with HBSS for 16 h at 37 \u25e6C showed an increase of Cyto-ID staining as compared to control cells, together with a significant decrease of p62/SQSTM1 levels, which indicated the activation of the autophagic flux. On the contrary, in cells pre-treated with HBSS and then with RDS 3337, an increase of Cyto-ID staining without degradation of p62/SQSTM1 was observed, indicating an impairment of the autophagic clearance. As expected, cells pre-treated with HBSS and successively with BafA1 displayed a significant increase of Cyto-ID staining, with a high level of p62/SQSTM1, indicating a block of the autophagic flux. Interestingly, again, in samples incubated with BafA1 after RDS 3337 treatment, a significant increase of Cyto-ID staining, suggestive of autophagosome accumulation, together with a high level of anti-p62/SQSTM1 staining, was found, indicating an effect of the HPSE inhibitor in the block of autophagic flux. In Figure 2E, the mean fluorescence intensities are reported; all the cytofluorimetric panels are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. As expected, this methodological approach is less sensitive as compared to Western blot for this test. In sum, these findings indicate that HPSE inhibitor RDS 3337 induces a significant increase of Cyto-ID staining, with a high level of p62/SQSTM1 in RPE-1 cells pre-treated with HBSS, suggestive of an autophagosomes accumulation and a consistent arrest of the autophagic flux."

No statistically significant differences were f und bet e n BafA1 and RDS 3337 18 h or 72 h + BafA1 samples.\nThus, we analyzed the effect of this compound on the autophagic pathway in U87 cells, which basically show quite a high vel of LC3-II together with a low level of p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 3D). With this aim, we valuated the protein levels of the autophagy-related marke s, including both LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1, in U87 c lls after incubation with 320 nM RDS 3337 for 18 h or 72 h versus control cells (vehicle). As sho n in Figure 3D, immunoblotting analysis of lipidated LC3-II and its quantification (histograms on the right) revealed a significant increase of LC3-II in U87 RDS 3337 treated cells compared to untreated ones (vehicle). Interestingly, the analysis of p62/SQSTM1, under the same experimental conditions, showed a significant increase with respect to untreated cells, suggesting a consistent arrest of its degradation. These findings suggest an accumulation of autophagosomes. Next, to better clarify the action of RDS 3337 in the autophagic process in U87 glioblastoma cells, we verified the autophagic flux using 100 nM BafA1 for 2 h, which prevents lysosomal acidification and, as a consequence, accumulates LC3-II by inhibiting p62/SQSTM1\ndegradation. Thus, the levels of both lipidated LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 were assessed by Western blot in RDS 3337-treated cells in combination with BafA1. As shown in Figure 3B, cells treated with RDS 3337 and successively with BafA1 displayed a consistent and significant accumulation of both LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 as compared to control cells or with RDS 3337-treated cells, indicating a block of the autophagic flux. All results were also confirmed by using a neuroblastoma cell line, i.e., SK-N-BE2 neuroblastoma cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Altogether, these data suggest the ability of HPSE inhibitor RDS3 3337 to induce both LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 increase, suggestive of an autophagosome accumulation and a consistent arrest in the autophagic flux."

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "Results of the present research support the notion that HPSE promotes autophagy, providing evidence that the RDS 3337 HPSE inhibitor blocks autophagic flux. HPSE, which traditionally functions extracellularly by cleavage of heparan sulfate and promoting the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), has long been associated with an increase in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis [36]. However, the recent literature strongly supports a non-enzymatic activity of HPSE in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways [37]. In this regard, a variety of biological functions and key signaling molecules have been investigated, including cell proliferation, mobility, angiogenesis, and activation of \u03b21 integrin, HIF-2\u03b1, Flk-1, and/or AKT signaling [38\u201341]. New discoveries have led to the consideration of a possible role for HPSE in modulating autophagy, mainly in the context of tumor growth and chemoresistance, although such a function still remains to be elucidated [12]. A higher increase of autophagy was observed following HPSE overexpression in tumor-derived cells, with an enhancement of tumor growth and chemoresistance. This agrees with a strong pre-clinical and clinical correlation between HPSE expression and the progression of these malignancies [42,43]. Accordingly, studies in HPSE-deficient or transgenic mice established its contributions to autophagy [12]. Enrichment of HPSE in lysosomes suggests that the enzyme may control the normal physiology of these organelles [12,28]. Since it is well known that double-membrane vesicles, called autophagosomes, are fused with lysosomes during autophagy, it cannot be ruled out that lysosomal HPSE may play a role in the completion of autophagy. This emerges from the observation that HPSE is localized within autophagosomes in association with LC3-II in SIHN-013 laryngeal carcinoma cells overexpressing HPSE [12]. More recently, Yang et al. showed that either active or enzymatically inactive HPSE enhanced both autophagosome formation and the expression of related genes in gastric cancer cells [44]. In particular, the presence of non-enzymatic HPSE was able to upregulate both LC3-II protein expression and the level of LAMP2, a lysosomal membrane protein.\nIn the present study, we analyzed the effect of RDS 3337 HPSE inhibitor on human non-cancer neuro-ectodermal cell line RPE-1 with low levels of autophagy and on U87 human glioblastoma cells, which are endowed with increased levels of autophagy. With this aim, the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway was examined by Western blot analysis. As a rule, autophagic flux is deduced on the basis of LC3-II turnover in both the presence and absence of lysosomal or vacuolar degradation [45]. Here, our findings point out an increase of LC3-II amount both in RPE-1 cells and, more evidently, in U87 human glioblastoma cells following HPSE inhibitor RDS 3337 treatment, suggestive of an autophagosomes accumulation and a consistent arrest in the autophagic flux, as confirmed by cell treatment with BafA1. Consistently, the RDS 3337 treatment might compromise the pro-autophagy function of the intracellular HPSE, considering the ability of the inhibitor to easily cross the cellular plasma membrane. Up to the present, there are still some important issues unresolved about the role of HPSE inhibitors in affecting autophagic pathways and what are the underlying mechanisms involved. Autophagy related to HPSE appears to involve the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1), an autophagy-suppressive regulator that integrates growth factor, nutrient, and energy signals; inhibition of mTOR1 leads to autophagy induction [46]. Recently, a direct correlation between HPSE overexpression and mTOR1 activity has also been proposed. In fact, in HPSE overexpressing SIHN013 laryngeal carcinoma cells, mTOR1 activity was downregulated, and this condition positively stimulated the autophagic process [12]. Stress-activated autophagy is known to favor the survival of tumor cells, mostly when apoptosis is defective, protecting them from anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and facilitating multi-drug-resistance development [47]. In this regard, it has been shown that autophagy made MCF-7 cells resistant to apoptosis induced by epirubicin, one of the most effective drugs against breast cancer. On the other hand, inhibition of autophagy by the downregulation of Beclin-1, a crucial upstream protein of autophagy, increased the epirubicin sensitivity of MCF-7 cells by accelerating caspase-9 activity and intrinsic apoptosis [48]. Here, we assessed whether alteration in autophagic activity upon RDS 3337 treatment in U87 human glioblastoma cells could lead to the induction of apoptosis. The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis is complex; similar stimuli can induce either autophagy or apoptosis, and the two phenomena may involve signal transduction pathways, which in turn are dependent on the type of cell nature and duration of stimulus, and stress. In many cases, when the apoptotic response is started, autophagy stops to function, partially because of the caspase-mediated cleavage of essential autophagy proteins [49]; thus, the cascade of caspase-activation associated with apoptosis shuts off the autophagic machinery [50]. Based on these considerations, we investigated the cell death rates by the evaluation of caspase 3 activation. Our results showed that RDS 3337 treatment induced a significant increase, in a time-dependent manner, of the cleaved-caspase 3 as compared with control cells. Furthermore, we also observed that activation of caspase 3 was associated with an increase of both cleaved Parp1 protein, the nuclear enzyme engaged in DNA repair, as well as the sub-G1 phase, which identifies DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cells. Taken together, the downregulation of the autophagic process may sensitize cells to anticancer drugs, since the deregulation of signal pathways leading to autophagy plays a crucial role in producing critical pathophysiological consequences in numerous cellular mechanisms, including the process of tumorigenesis [51]. Our evidence on apoptosis activation may suggest a role for HPSE inhibitor, making its use particularly advantageous for therapeutic applications, where the progression of tumor growth can be controlled by acting in a balance between apoptosis and autophagy and regulating the autophagic process, without a cytotoxic mechanism affecting cell viability."
