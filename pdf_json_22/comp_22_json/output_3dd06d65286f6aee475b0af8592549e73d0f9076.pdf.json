    "abstractText": "With the climate change we are experiencing today, the number and intensity of heatwaves are increasing dramatically, significantly impacting our buildings\u2019 overheating. The majority of the prefabricated concrete panel buildings in Hungary are considered outdated from an energy point of view. These buildings may be at greater risk from extreme weather events. To examine this, long-term monitoring measurements are needed. Therefore, we developed a unique, reliable, and cost-effective wireless monitoring system, which can track in real time the indoor air quality data (temperature, relative humidity, CO2) of the investigated apartment building, as well as users\u2019 habits, such as resident presence, window opening, and blind movement. The data were used to analyse and quantify the summer overheating of the dwelling and user habits. The measurements showed that the average temperature in all rooms was above 26 \u25e6C, and there were several occasions when the temperature exceeded 30 \u25e6C. Overheating in apartment buildings in summer is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. Further investigation of ventilation habits will help develop favourable ventilation strategies, and using these measurements in dynamic simulations will also help improve the models\u2019 validity for further studies.",

            "text": "According to the latest available data [1] of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, the share of prefabricated reinforced concrete sandwich panel block housing [2] is approximately 13.3% in Hungary, i.e., there are more than half a million \u201cpanel\u201d dwellings, with 1,150,000 inhabitants. The vast majority of these buildings only contain a 5\u20138 cm insulation layer in the reinforced concrete large panel system which is now significantly aged and deteriorated, has not undergone in-depth renovation [3], and is considered outdated from an energy performance point of view. One of the consequences of climate change is an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events [4,5], such as the intensity and frequency of summer heatwaves [6,7], which may pose an even greater risk to panel dwellings [8]. Additionally, a study [9] showed that 10-storey housing blocks made of prefabricated reinforced concrete panels are among the most endangered building types in terms of climate vulnerability. Regarding vulnerability, the older age group (65+) is most at risk from heatwaves. The proportion of flats occupied only by older people is the highest in Budapest (25%) and around 20% in the rest of the country. Considering these data, it is essential to address this type of building, as there are few real-time measurement data available. The measurement of buildings\u2019 indoor environment is usually performed using lowcost wireless monitoring devices capable of monitoring various parameters [10]. However, the limitations and capabilities are worth keeping an eye on if anyone uses low-cost sensors,\nSensors 2022, 22, 8638. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22228638 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 8638 2 of 16\nsince many cheap sensors can produce significant errors [11]. The most studied indoor air parameters in wireless low-cost IoT devices are temperature and relative humidity [12\u201318]. Monitoring the carbon dioxide concentration of the indoor air with low-cost sensors is also used to evaluate indoor air quality, occupancy, or building performance [19\u201322]. For detecting motion and indoor presence, passive infrared sensor (PIR) arrays can be placed in rooms or doorways [23], or magnetic reed switches can be used to act as door sensors [24]. Window opening is usually measured using magnetic switches [25\u201327]. Since shading plays a significant role in creating an adequate state of comfort in the interior in both winter and summer [25], monitoring of the window shading devices (e.g., blinds, shutters) can also be essential, and magnetic sensors could be a suitable solution [26]. We aimed to develop a wireless sensor network to measure the indoor air quality of a panel dwelling in Budapest. This system must be affordable and reliable, and an interactive online interface is also required to track measurements and monitor user habits. The monitoring measurements will provide a realistic picture of the summer temperature and relative humidity in the dwelling, as well as the evolution of the occupant\u2019s habits (presence, ventilation, and shading)."

The number of switches is determined by the required resolution of the shutter\u2019s position. In our measurements, three switches proved sufficient for an average-sized window. As the shutter is lifted or lowered, the magnet will pass the switches one by one, closing each contact for a short interval.

Therefore, the closing of the contact can be detected as an edge change by the microcontroller.\nThe position of the window sash is also measured using reed switches on the internal frame and permanent magnets on the internal side of the sash. The key to successfully distinguishing the three possible states (closed, tilted, open) is the correct placement of two switches. The first switch and magnet are placed on the bottom edge, and the contact should stay closed when the window is closed or tilted.

As long as the window was only open for a short time and tilted mode, the ventilation could not b efficient; as soon as the occupant opened the window fully, the internal temperature dropped drastically by 5 \u25e6C. Measurements and analyses such as these will help to develop more efficient ventilation strategies in the future, as well as to calibrate dynamic simulations. The measurements will allow us to analyse the air exchange in the study area and develop occupant profiles.\nFigure 15.

            "text": "We developed a low-cost wireless monitoring sensor system that can collect temperature, relative humidity, CO2, and user behaviour data such as window opening and external shutter position. The designed monitoring system was constructed and installed in an apartment located in a large concrete panel building to measure the temperature and user behaviour, since this type of building has proven to be one of the most vulnerable to heatwaves. The possibility of measuring window sash and shutter position to monitor the window tilting or opening and the shutter operation is among the novel capabilities of our developed sensor system. We developed a web application to visualise real-time measurement data, and its dashboard can be freely changed and combined, which usually cannot be achieved with commercial systems. We used a LiDAR-based survey to obtain the building\u2019s floor plan and internal layout. The 2020 iPad Pro\u2019s LiDAR sensor proved to be a fast and adequate solution for the task, providing acceptable accuracy for the drafting. During the analysed summer month following the installation of the wireless monitoring system, it was found that although residents reported that the temperature in their homes was tolerable during the summer, there were frequent cases of temperatures above 30 \u25e6C in the rooms, well above the accepted summer comfort limit of 26 \u25e6C. Bedrooms were found to be the hottest rooms, both during the day and at night, with more than a 40% difference in the values of the ODH26 indicator. Examining ventilation habits shows that if the outside temperature is adequate, effective ventilation at night can significantly reduce the internal temperature. As in the case of the apartment under study, it is also necessary to consider the CO2 concentration when assessing indoor comfort, which can rise slightly or stagnate even with a tilted window but can only be effectively reduced when the window is fully open. The research and the monitoring system that has been developed will contribute to a deeper understanding of how our buildings work and how climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of overheating in buildings. The recorded measurements can be used to perform various analyses or for further dynamic simulation studies. We can create user profiles with an extensive dataset to make our simulations more accurate. The elements of the measurement system can usually be reused later, i.e., it can be installed at a new measurement site with minor modifications after the measurement is finished. Our study will help to develop more efficient ventilation strategies in the future, as well as to calibrate dynamic simulations. The measurement of user patterns was limited to the external building envelope (windows and shutters). For further studies, it may be worth measuring the movement of internal doors, as these can impact the internal air quality. Long-term measurements will continue during the winter for a whole year, during which time changes in user habits according to the seasons may be observed.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, Z.S. and B.N.; methodology, D.S., B.D., Z.S. and B.N.; software, B.D. and D.S.; formal analysis, D.S., Z.S. and B.N.; investigation, D.S.; data curation, B.D. and D.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.D., D.S. and B.N.; writing\u2014review and editing, Z.S. and B.N.; visualisation, D.S. and B.D.; supervision, Z.S.; project administration, Z.S. funding acquisition, Z.S.
