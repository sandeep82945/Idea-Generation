    "abstractText": "Background One size does not fit all in assessment and intervention for people with convictions for sexual offences. Crime scene indicators and risk-related variables have been used to identify distinct clusters of people with convictions for sexual offences, but there is a need for more robust typologies that identify clusters based on psychologically meaningful risk factors that can be targeted in treatment.",

Elliott*\nBackground One size does not fit all in assessment and intervention for people with convictions for sexual offences. Crime scene indicators and risk-related variables have been used to identify distinct clusters of people with convictions for sexual offences, but there is a need for more robust typologies that identify clusters based on psychologically meaningful risk factors that can be targeted in treatment.\nAims To use robust modelling techniques to identify latent profiles of people with convictions for sexual offences based on indicators of dynamic risk.\nMethod Adult male participants, who had been convicted for sexual offences and assessed for eligibility for the prison-based Core Sex Offender Treatment Programme delivered by His Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service (UK), were randomly allocated to a test (n = 1577: 70.2%) or validation (n = 668: 29.8%) data-set. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to select measures of dynamic risk from psychological test data. EFA indicated four factors, from which six measures were selected for inclusion in latent profile analysis.\nResults Five latent profiles were identified in the test and validation datasets. These were labelled low psychological impairment, impulsive, distorted thinker, rape preoccupied and child fantasist. Profiles varied in individual characteristics, offence histories, victim preferences and level of risk.\nConclusions Our findings should be used to guide assessment and intervention practices that are tailored to distinct psychological profiles consistent with principles of risk, need and responsivity.\nKeywords: Mental health services; psychiatry and law; psychological testing; risk assessment; sexual offending..\nCopyright and usage \u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

The SARN is one of the most reliable and wellvalidated frameworks of dynamic risk, and these four domains have been treatment targets on offender behaviour programmes developed by His Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS). However, one of the largest barriers to effective assessment and intervention persists in the form of varying profiles of risk and need exhibited by different individuals. In such cases, the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach is clearly limited.\nGiven this heterogeneity, it is unsurprising that attempts have been made to categorise people into more homogeneous groups on the basis of offence type (e.g. contact versus online offending), victim age (e.g. prepubescent versus pubescent) or victim familiality.6 More sophisticated typologies have employed clinical case files and standardised tests to assign individuals to various categories.7,8 However, these models have been criticised on several grounds. Some of the main critiques include the exclusion of incest offenders, the complexity of the classification systems, the time-consuming nature of the classification process and\ndifficulty accounting for so-called \u2018cross-over\u2019 offenders who have offended against adults and children.9,10 More recently, advanced statistical techniques have been used to allocate people to distinct classes using crime scene indicators,11,12 but such typologies are less revealing about the specific changeable (or \u2018dynamic\u2019) risk factors that, when targeted in treatment, may be expected to reduce the risk of recidivism.\nIn this exploratory study, we used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct subtypes of people convicted of sexual offences based on indicators of dynamic risk from psychological test data. We aimed to build on earlier work, which identified dynamic risk clusters that largely resembled a continuum of severity,13 by employing more robust modelling techniques and using a large sample divided into test and validation data-sets. We also examined whether the resulting profiles were distinguishable based on individual characteristics, offence histories and victim preferences.\nMethod"

All participants were assessed between 2003 and 2014 (with 65% of assessments occurring between 2007 and 2011, inclusive) for eligibility for the prison-based version of HMPPS Core Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP). Approximately 97% of the sample was serving a sentence for a conviction between 1996 and 2012, with 77% convicted between 2003 and 2009. Ages ranged between 21 and 84 years (mean 41.8,* Joint first authors.\nThe British Journal of Psychiatry (2023) 223, 555\u2013561. doi: 10.1192/bjp.2023.126\n555 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2023.126 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ns.d. = 12.7, median 42 years). Most of the sample was recorded as being in aggregate White ethnic categories (89.8%), with 5.9% classified in aggregate Black ethnic categories, 2.7% in aggregate Asian ethnic categories, 1.3% in aggregate \u2018mixed-race\u2019 ethnic categories, 0.2% in aggregate \u2018other\u2019 ethnic categories, with a further 0.1% not specified and 4.4% of the data missing. Most of the full sample (n = 1526: 68.0%) attended the Core SOTP (rolling or fixed formats), 362 (16.1%) attended a combination of the Core and Extended SOTP, 315 (14.0%) attended the Better Lives Booster (for individuals with intellectual difficulties) and 42 (1.9%) attended the Healthy Sexual Functioning programme (information about Core and Extended SOTP is given in Supplementary Material A, available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2023.126). Consequently, our sample was heterogeneous regarding executive functioning, sexual interests and victim types.\nAfter removing duplicates and individuals for whommore than 10% of data were missing, a final data-set of 2245 participants remained for analysis. Participants were randomly allocated to a test (n = 1577: 70.2%) or validation (n = 668: 29.8%) data-set. Results from a simulation study have suggested that a minimum sample size of 500 should be sufficient to accurately identify a correct number of latent profiles.14\nEthics approval was not received for this human study because we used existing data collected by HMPPS for the purposes of service evaluation. All adult participants provided written informed consent for their data to be used in research. The project was approved by the Ministry of Justice National Research Committee (granted 5 May 2021)."

Only pre-programme test scores were considered for inclusion. One scale was removed because of missing data (30% missing) and two further scales were removed because of perfect or near-perfect positive correlations with other study measures (Supplementary Material A). Any scales that were positively oriented were reverse scored so that higher scores were indicative of greater risk/impairment. Forty scales were removed because of a lack of theoretical support as psychologically meaningful risk factors.3\nExploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to reduce the number of variables, with the aim of selecting one variable per theoretically plausible risk domain for use in the LPA. Three metrics were used to judge how many factors could plausibly be extracted from the data: (a) parallel analysis; (b) Velicer\u2019s minimal average partial (MAP) criterion; and (c) the very simple structure (VSS) criterion.15 Parallel analysis revealed that the eigenvalues of seven components exceeded the associated simulated eigenvalue generated from random data. Both the MAP (smallest average squared partial correlation of 0.0129) and the VSS criterions (maximum correlation of 0.79) suggested four components. Since all three tests broadly indicated that additional value is limited beyond four factors (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Material A), EFA using a varimax rotation and a maximum likelihood solution was used to establish the fit of a four-factor model. Supplementary Table S1 (Supplementary Material A) provides the factor loadings per scale cluster. The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) was 0.05 (d.f. corrected RMSR = 0.06), \u03c72(524) = 4.2, P < 0.001.\nThe EFA resulted in four classes of scales, approximating three of the four SARN domains of risk:4 factor 1, socio-affective and emotional management; factor 2, sexual preoccupation/interests, child specific; factor 3, sexual preoccupation/interests, non-child\nspecific; and factor 4, pro-offending thinking (adult and child). Finally, we constructed correlation matrices for each of the four factors, to ensure that we selected scales for inclusion in the LPA that (a) had a sufficiently high factor loading and (b) had a high average correlation with other scales and thus were a good exemplar of the underlying general construct.\nA total of six subscales were selected for inclusion in the LPA: one from the socio-affective and emotional management factor (Impulsive carelessness:16 factor loading FL = 0.88, mean r (rm) = 0.61); one from the sexual preoccupation/interests, child-specific factor (Child molest: fantasy:17 FL = 0.81, rm = 0.53); two from the sexual preoccupation/interests, non-child-specific factor, representing interests (Rape: fantasy:17 FL = 0.73, rm = 0.43) and preoccupations (Sexual obsession:17 FL = 0.58, rm = 0.40); and two from the pro-offending thinking factor, one non-child specific (Rape myth acceptance:18 FL = 0.74, rm = 0.55) and one child specific (Sex with children:19 FL = 0.78, rm = 0.54)."

Gaussian finite mixture models were estimated using the expectation\u2013maximisation (EM) algorithm (starting with the expectation step) for model-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering.23\nIt is recommended that a range of criteria are used for identifying the correct number of profiles.14 Although the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)24 is used as the default, we also used the Akaike information criterion (AIC),25 consistent AIC (CAIC),26 sample size adjusted BIC (SABIC)27 and integrated complete-data likelihood criterion (ICL)28 to judge model estimation. Larger loglikelihood values (BIC, SABIC, AIC, CAIC or ICL) relative to the previous model indicate better fit. Entropy and minimum probability were also assessed,29 with values closer to 1 indicative of better fit. Finally, we examined findings from the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT),30 with larger changes in log-likelihood relative to the previous model indicative of better fit. We calculated estimates for one to nine profiles, generated via two models that presumed either equal variances (as opposed to allowing variances to vary) and covariances fixed to zero (Model 1 in tidyLPA) or equal variances and equal covariances (Model 3 in tidyLPA)."

The distorted thinkers (relative mean difference of +5.4 years) and child fantasists (+6.7 years) were significantly older than those with an LPI profile. Individuals with an impulsive profile had a significantly greater number of prior convictions than those with an LPI profile, whereas those with a distorted thinker or child fantasist profile had significantly fewer prior convictions. Individuals with an impulsive, rape preoccupied or child fantasist profile \u2013 but not a distorted thinker profile \u2013 all had significantly more sexual convictions than those with an LPI profile.

In contrast, those with a distorted thinker profile may benefit from programmes that address distorted thinking patterns related to sex with adults and/or children, but may benefit less, on average, from interventions targeting sexual preoccupation/interests or socio-affective function and emotion management. Individuals with the rape preoccupied profile presented with high levels of both risk and need and should be prioritised for more intensive treatment focused on reducing sexual fantasising and sexual preoccupation. Rape preoccupied individuals who are high risk and show pronounced sexual preoccupations or paraphilic sexual interests may additionally benefit from medication to reduce sexual arousal.42 These medications tend to include anti-androgens, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues.42 Although there is a lack of robust evidence to support the medical management of sexual arousal, some degree of success has been reported.43 Finally, people with a child fantasist profile, where there was a relatively high frequency of IIOC index offences, but few distorted attitudes about children and sex and low sexual preoccupation, may benefit from elements of healthy sex interventions44 and\n559 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2023.126 Published online by Cambridge University Press\npsychoeducation about the consequences of IIOC.45 However, more robust, long-term outcome studies are needed to understand the potential benefits of these approaches in prisons and in the community."

            "text": "Our work has several strengths, including a large, heterogeneous sample, data on intelligence, the number and type of previous convictions, and information about level of risk and index offence codes. However, our results are nonetheless subject to some limitations. First, factor analyses revealed that the psychological test data indexed three of the four domains of risk identified by Thornton,4 but did not yield an antisocial component. The inclusion of measures of antisocial personality pathology and psychopathic tendencies would add to the richness of the latent profiles. Second, the LPAs relied solely on data collected using self-reports and are therefore subject to obvious limitations, including socially desirable responding. Future work should include alternative measurements, including clinical checklists and indices of physiological arousal (e.g. penile tumescence to sexual stimuli). Third, information about victim type was also only available for index offences, and we do not know the proportion of individuals in each profile who had prior convictions involving child victims, female victims or use of IIOC. Fourth, profiles derived using LPA might not represent true profiles that exist in the target population. Superfluous classes can be identified owing to non-normality of the data, non-linear relationships between the indicator variables or a misspecification of the model.46 The interpretation of profiles is also subjective. Although there are no clear rules on how to make sense of profiles, we followed reviews of best practice and considered the balance of the indicators and the context of the relevant literature.47"
