    "abstractText": "Human anxiety is a grave mental health concern that needs to be addressed in the appropriate manner in order to develop a healthy society. In this study, an objective human anxiety assessment framework is developed by using physiological signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and recorded in response to exposure therapy. The EEG signals of twenty-three subjects from an existing database called \u201cA Database for Anxious States which is based on a Psychological Stimulation (DASPS)\u201d are used for anxiety quantification into two and four levels. The EEG signals are pre-processed using appropriate noise filtering techniques to remove unwanted ocular and muscular artifacts. Channel selection is performed to select the significantly different electrodes using statistical analysis techniques for binary and fourlevel classification of human anxiety, respectively. Features are extracted from the data of selected EEG channels in the frequency domain. Frequency band selection is applied to select the appropriate combination of EEG frequency bands, which in this study are theta and beta bands. Feature selection is applied to the features of the selected EEG frequency bands. Finally, the selected subset of features from the appropriate frequency bands of the statistically significant EEG channels were classified using multiple machine learning algorithms. An accuracy of 94.90% and 92.74% is attained for two and four-level anxiety classification using a random forest classifier with 9 and 10 features, respectively. The proposed state anxiety classification framework outperforms the existing anxiety detection framework in terms of accuracy with a smaller number of features which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm.",

Anxiety is the natural response of the body to a stressful scenario e.g., first day at school, before appearing for an interview or exam [2], prior to a public speaking task [3], due to a painful medical process [4] or a chronic life-threatening disease [5]. Every individual in society has to face anxiety in atleast one phase\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 1 / 29\na1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Muhammad F, Al-Ahmadi S (2022) Human state anxiety classification framework using EEG signals in response to exposure therapy.

Anxiety is a normal emotion and can be beneficial in many circumstances. Confronting an anxious situation triggers our natural fight or flight response resulting in the release of hormones, hence making us more vigilant and attentive to our surroundings. However, if the stressful setting continuous for a prolonged duration it can result into anxiety disorders which is harmful for the human health.\nHuman stress and anxiety have been used as interchangeable terms in the acedemic litera-\nture because they share many common symptoms like faster heartbeat and breathing, diarrhea, or constipation, but there exists a distinction between the two emotions. Stress is a sentiment of being unable to handle the psychological or emotional burden caused by an external stimulus. Some of the symptoms precisely linked with stress include anger, loneliness, dizziness, general unhappiness, and a feeling of being overwhelmed. The cause of stress can be shortterm (e.g., a deadline at the office or a quarrel with a family member) or long-term (e.g., chronic illness, bad financial conditions, or an unhappy marriage). On the other hand, anxiety originates due to factors that are persistent and continues to exist even after the stressful situation is over. Symptoms explicitly connected with anxiety are restlessness, tension, sweating, nervousness, and a feeling of uneasiness. Chronic stress has been found to be a key factor in developing depression and anxiety symptoms with an effect on sleep, mood, and appetite of an individual [6\u20139].\nAnxiety can be categorized into two main types i.e., state anxiety and trait anxiety [10].\nState anxiety echoes the psychological and physiological response of a person to a particular situation at hand whereas, on the contrary, trait anxiety describes the personality trait of an individual. Human trait anxiety is commonly measured using rest state recording [11] whereas, state anxiety is an instant form of anxiety and is generally measured in response to some stimulus which instigates mental strain [12]. When a person is facing stress or anxiety, the human body responds by providing the required physiological and immune system adjustment in order to achieve the required cerebral equilibrium [13]. Stressors trigger changes in the human nervous system which instigates numerous physical and physiological variations in the human body which have been measured with different markers to date [14].\nHuman anxiety is a common mental health concern for a very large segment of the world population. According to the statistics of a survey conducted in the United States of America (USA), approximately 18% of the total population (i.e., 40 million people) is affected by an anxiety disorder and only 36.9% of these individuals from among these anxiety patients are receiving treatment [15]. Moreover, according to the findings of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), the probability of getting hospitalized is six times higher in anxiety patients as compared to a healthy individual [16]. According to another survey conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health, 19% of the American individuals over 18 years of age experience an anxiety disorder and approximately 31% of the USA residents experience stress throughout their lifetime [17]. Prolonged anxiety disorder weakens the immune system of a person and hence the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases is strikingly increased. A strong bond between anxiety disorder, stroke, and heart disease has been reported in a number of research studies [18, 19]. Anxiety disorder tends to develop a diverse type of risk factors which include depression, genetic problems and personality disorders. Approximately half of the anxiety disorder patients tend to face depression depicting a strong association between the two mental health issues. Anxiety disorder can be categorized into generalized anxiety disorder (affecting 3.1% of the U.S. population), panic disorder (affecting 2.7% of the U.S. population), social anxiety disorder (affecting 6.8% of the U.S. population), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (affecting 1.0% of the U.S. population), and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (affecting 3.5% of the U.S. population). According to statistics, women are more prone to generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 2 / 29\ndisorder whereas social anxiety disorder is faced equally by both genders. In addition to the adults, 25.1% of the children, between the age of 13 to 18 years, are also victims of anxiety disorder. Researchers have reported that children with anxiety disorder have poor performance at school, miss out on important social experiences and become drug addicts [20, 21]. Evasion of stressful situations is of no benefit to human health nor is it helpful in devising a strategy to cope with these anxious state of affairs in the future. The above mentioned statistics illustrates the fact that assessment of human anxiety is of supreme importance and appropriate measure to lessen the consequences of anxiety to human health need to be developed.\nDiagnoses of anxiety have been a challenge both for researchers and clinicians. Clinical\nanalyses mainly depend on the documented symptoms frequently detected in the anxiety patients but there exists a significant overlap in these diagnostic criteria for stress, anxiety, and depression [22]. It is possible that two individuals spotted with anxiety and depression may share a common symptom. This symptoms-based diagnostic method can help medical practitioners in giving their verdict, but this approach lacks in providing a quantifiable objective measure from which fundamental reasons for the occurrence of anxiety can be sensed. It can be deduced from these facts that there exists a clear gap in the clinical domain to develop an impartial and accurate measure to detect anxiety and its disorders. The biomedical research community believes that chemical biomarkers like salivary alpha-amylase and chromogranin A are the more trustworthy solutions for the anxiety assessment [23, 24].\nMoreover, the psychologists consider the standard psychometric questionnaires as a\ndependable measure of anxiety. These questionnaires have been used for quite a long time and have provided an accurate assessment of human anxiety, but they are not able to provide any insight into the physiological changes occurring within the body of the individual affected by the anxiety. Some of the regularly used questionnaires for the quantification of anxiety include State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire [25], Hamilton Anxiety Measure (HAM-A) [26], Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) [27], Death Anxiety Questionnaire (DAQ) [28], Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [29] and Scale of Death Anxiety (SDA) [30]. Another incipient and imperative method of valuation of anxiety is the use of physiological constructs. Anxiety measurement has been achieved by using electroencephalography (EEG) [31], electrocardiography (ECG) [32], photoplethysmography (PPG) [33], galvanic skin response (GSR) [34], heart rate (HR) [35], heart rate variability (HRV) [8], blood pressure (BP) [36], and electromyography (EMG) [37] signals. In this study we aim to develop an EEG signals-based state anxiety measurement framework because of its importance in curing individuals with anxiety disorders and helping them become useful segment of the society. We intend to identify the relationship between the EEG recording headband electrodes, EEG frequency bands and the anxious and non-anxious individuals."

            "text": "A diverse range of human anxiety measurement schemes using physiological signals has been proposed in the literature which can be characterized into two lines i.e., state-anxiety and traitanxiety. The footsteps for the general framework of human anxiety quantification are outlined beneath. Firstly, the physiological signals of the participants are acquired in the rest-state (for measurement of trait anxiety) [38] or in response to stimulus (for the measurement of state anxiety) [12]. Subsequent to data acquisition, is a feature set that has the ability to segregate anxious and non-anxious subjects is extracted. Finally, an appropriate classification algorithm is employed to quantify human anxiety from the recorded physiological signals.\nHuman state anxiety detection based on features extracted from the EEG signals recorded\nin response to face-to-face psychological stimuli is presented in [39]. The study reported an\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 3 / 29\naccuracy of 86.7% for the four-class anxiety classification using a stacked sparse autoencoder scheme. An association between the math anxiety and the EEG signals of the participants is discussed in [40] with a reported accuracy of 93.75% using the Na\u00efve Bayesian tree. A new EEG based anxiety detection and mitigation massage headband is developed in [41]. Beta waves have been found to be associated with the high anxiety participants whose amplitude was successfully suppressed by the massage headband. Another state anxiety measurement scheme using EEG signals in response to emotional video clips is presented in [31]. The study discovered the fact that asymmetry index values were higher in relaxed subjects and are reduced during the anxious situation. An EEG-neurofeedback scheme for anxiety classification in response to mindfulness recording and resting-state EEG signals is presented in [42]. A visual analogue scale was used to subjectively label the participants into three anxiety classes. The highest accuracy of 87.18% for anxiety classification was achieved using the SVM algorithm.\nAnother type of state anxiety i.e., social anxiety is measured using heartbeat signals\nrecorded in response to two different social evaluative situations i.e., public speaking and thesis defending in a study conducted in [43]. Statistical analysis of baseline and anxiety state data revealed that the complexity of the heartbeat is significantly reduced during social anxiety situations. Moreover, accuracy of 81.82% is attained for detection of low and high anxiety state using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Another state anxiety measurement scheme using heartbeat intervals of student recording prior to the university examination is elaborated in [35]. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that a negative correlation was found between state anxiety and the largest Lyapunov exponent as well as entropy measure feature. The relationship of PPG data with the state anxiety is explored in [33]. A strong correlation of 0.81 between the subjective score of the participants and the anxiety detected by the machine learning-based approach is attained.\nAn objective anxiety measurement framework using the fusion of features extracted from the EEG and the PPG signals recorded in response to two scenarios i.e., riding a bike at their most comfortable speed and while imagining that they had to contend with somebody who is riding at 80km/hr. is discussed in [44]. Principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbor classifier led to an accuracy of 62.5% for three state anxiety classification. A wearable sensorbased state anxiety detection study in two and three levels using physiological signals of ECG, GSR, and respiration rate acquired in a randomized controlled trial is presented in [45]. An accuracy of 89.8% and 74.4% is attained for two and three-class anxiety classification using a bagged tree classifier, respectively. A state anxiety identification scheme in older individuals with ages ranging from 60-80 years using physiological signals of GSR and PPG and a contextbased feature in response to trier social stress test (TSST) protocol is explored in [46]. Ground truth for the proposed scheme was obtained using STAI questionnaire responses from the participants. Results of the study showed that with the addition of context-based features, a 3.37% and 6.41% higher accuracy is obtained by the random forest classifier in comparison to only using GSR and PPG signals, respectively. An anxiety detection framework using eye, mouth, and head movement activity and heart rate feature through video recorded facial cues is discussed in [47]. The highest classification accuracy of 91.68% is achieved for anxiety detection using the AdaBoost classifier. Driver\u2019s anxiety detection using a fusion of EEG, PPG, GSR, and pupil size of the subject is examined in [48]. EEG signal resulted superior in performance with an accuracy of 77.01% in comparison to the fusion of other signals which resulted in lower accuracy as compared to EEG. A four-level anxiety level recognition scheme for virtual reality therapy system using physiological signals of BP, GSR, and skin temperature is elaborated in [49]. An accuracy of 80.1% is achieved by the SVM classifier using the leave one-subject out cross-validation scheme. A stress and anxiety detection scheme in the academic environment\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 4 / 29\nusing physiological signals of heart rate, skin temperature and oximetry signals is presented in [50]. The highest classification accuracy of 95% was achieved for two level anxiety classification using SVM classifier with a feature vector length of 3. Anxiety-displaying activities recognition study using motion sensors of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer is presented in [51]. A deep learning model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory achieved an accuracy of 92% for anxiety related activities.\nHuman state anxiety assessment schemes available in the literature have used a diverse\nrange of anxiety-inducing stimuli\u2019s (Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) [52], Cold Pressor Test (CPT) [53], public speaking [54, 55] and mental arithmetic task [56]) and physiological signals (EEG, ECG, GSR, PPG, HR, and BP) to quantify anxiety in a robust manner. However, the body of the literature on human anxiety measurement is still growing and is not as rich as the number of studies available for human stress measurement. There exists a significant scope to further strengthen the findings of the existing anxiety assessment schemes. Recently, a new publicly available dataset for the assessment of human state anxiety using EEG signals named \u201cA Database for Anxious States based on a Psychological Stimulation (DASPS)\u201d has been developed by the authors in [12]. The authors have investigated the trial duration, feature type, feature combination, and anxiety levels of the participants in their study conducted in [39]. The study determined the fact that 1 second time duration is optimum for anxiety stimulation and achieved an accuracy of 86.7% for four-level anxiety classification. However, the proposed scheme has not examined the effect of EEG electrodes and frequency band selection for the optimum classification of anxiety into multiple levels. Moreover, the selection of the best subset of features from the selected EEG frequency band is still pending and needs to be inspected to improve the computational complexity of the algorithm. To this end, we propose a novel anxiety classification model addressing the above-mentioned challenges of the channel, EEG frequency band, and feature selection in the DASPS dataset to improve the accuracy and the robustness of the anxiety detection algorithm. The recorded EEG signals in the DASPS are processed for noise cancellation and channel selection in the pre-processing phase. Following this, the frequency bands of the EEG signal are computed using discrete-time Fourier transform, and feature extraction is performed in the frequency domain. EEG frequency band selection algorithm is applied to select the optimum frequency band for the anxiety classification. Furthermore, the extracted features from the selected EEG frequency bands are applied upon with a feature selection algorithm to further improve the computational complexity of the proposed scheme. Finally, the selected subset of features from the optimum EEG frequency band of the statistically significant EEG electrodes are subjected to classification using five different classification algorithms which include k-nearest neighbors (kNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and SVM. Moreover, another benefit of using the DASPS dataset for anxiety quantification is that the EEG signals are acquired using a lowcost commercially available headset which can be used for anxiety detection in both laboratory and out of laboratory environment."

Firstly, all the existing state anxiety classification schemes that have been developed using\nthe EEG datasets which are not publicly available for future research and hence cannot be used to further improve the results of their proposed scheme. A fair comparison is not possible with their methods, whereas, in our proposed scheme a publicly available EEG signals\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 5 / 29\ndatabase named DASPS\u201d has been used and we have worked on improving the results of the study in which the DASPS database has been developed.\n2. Secondly, we have examined the effect of EEG electrodes and frequency band selection for\nthe optimum classification of anxiety into multiple levels.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only one existing study discussed in [57] has explored the\neffect of these parameters (electrode (channel) and frequency band selection of the EEG data) for state anxiety classification. There are some shortcomings of this existing anxiety classification scheme as compared to our proposed scheme which include low classification accuracy for four level anxiety classification and a bulky feature vector length. The proposed scheme addresses these concerns by exploring the effect of selecting optimum subset of features from the selected EEG frequency band to lessen the computational complexity of the algorithm. The earlier schemes have employed feature selection from the entire EEG data without selecting optimum subset of EEG electrodes and frequency bands.\nThe organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. The proposed human anxiety quanti-\nfication framework comprising of details about data acquisition protocol, pre-processing, feature extraction, frequency band, and feature selection, and classifiers adopted for the anxiety classification is elaborated in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on the experimental results and their analysis followed by the comparison of the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art schemes available in the literature.

            "text": "In this study, the DASPS database consisting of EEG signals recorded in response to exposure therapy is used. Exposure therapy is a popular type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that involves stating situations that prompt anxiety to a level that is both comfortable and tolerable [58]. The details about the EEG database are explained in this section. EEG signals of 23 healthy participants (10 males, 13 females) with no reported history of any mental or physical illness having an average age of 30 years were recorded during the experiment. The involvement of the participants in the experiment was entirely voluntary. A written consent was obtained from each subject prior to the start of the experiment. (As we have used a publicly available EEG dataset in our study, which the authors have developed in [39] but they have not mentioned the name of ethics committee which approved the experimental protocol rather they have mentioned that the written consent was obtained from all the participants.) Next, the participant is asked to subjectively report their anxiety level before the experiment using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). The tool is composed of 14 different items, where each item corresponds to a number of symptoms and can be rated on a scale of 0 to 4.\nThe total score of the questionnaire can range from 0 to 56. This prior anxiety severity com-\nputation helps the psychotherapist to determine the amount of exposure a particular person can withstand. Following the subjective anxiety assessment, the subject is asked to be seated in a comfortable chair in a closed eye manner avoiding speech and gesture movements as much as possible. The psychotherapist starts the recital of the first scenario and aids the subject of the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 6 / 29\nexperiment to imagine it to elicit anxiety. Both the recital and the imagination phase are composed of 15 seconds each. The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale is used to inquire the subject that how he felt during the stimulation. SAM scale consists of two parameters i.e., valance which ranges from negative to positive, and arousal that runs from calm to excited state. Both valance and arousal have a nine points scale for measuring the subject\u2019s emotion. This sequence of provoking anxiety by psychotherapists and evaluation of valance and arousal by the subject is executed six times in the experiment. Finally, at the end of the experiment, HAM-A was once more answered by the subject to report his current anxiety level. After this, the participant was allowed to leave the experiment room. The timeline diagram for the experimental protocol is presented in Fig 2.\n3.1.1 EEG recording equipment. EEG data acquisition is performed using Emotiv EPOC\nwireless headset. The headset consists of 14 electrodes and 2 mastoids placed according to the 10-20 electrode positioning system [59]. The electrodes included in the Emotiv EPOC EEG headset are AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4. One of the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 7 / 29\nmastoids acts as a ground reference point to compare the voltage of all other electrodes of the headset whereas, the other mastoid is used as an indirect reference to minimize the effect of electrical interference [60]. Some of the salient features to use the Emotiv EPOC headset in this experiment include ease of use, the faster setup time of 3 to 5 minutes, rechargeable battery which lasts up to 12 hours. Moreover, due to the wireless nature of the headset, it is easy to wear for the user and does not require a complex setup like the clinical EEG data acquisition equipment. The efficacy of the Emotiv EPOC headset has been reputable in a number of emotion recognition [61\u201366] and stress measurement studies [67\u201370] available in the literature.\nThe reliability of the Emotiv EPOC headset as compared to medical grade EEG data acqui-\nsition equipment has been explored in several studies in the literature to validate the findings of the consumer grade EEG devices. In the studies conducted in [71] and [72], the authors have conducted an experiment related to auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) to find out the equivalence of the quality for the ERPs measured using consumer grade Emotiv EPOC headband and medical grade Neuroscan EEG equipment in adults and children, respectively. The studies concluded the fact that the consumer grade EEG system can be reliably considered a valid alternative to medical grade devices for the acquisition of EEG signals. In addition to this, another experiment conducted in [73] in which the authors tried to identify the quality of the signals of two different consumer grade EEG data acquisition equipment\u2019s for control tasks. The authors deduced the fact that the Emotiv EPOC headset has been substantially better as compared to the other consumer grade device for the classification of variety of control tasks. Moreover, the Emotiv EPOC headset has been used in a range of emotion recognition studies like evaluation of music pleasure [74] and stress [68] with good level of reliability and accuracy. Our study is focused on measurement of state anxiety which is also an emotion that can be reliabily estimated via Emotiv EPOC headband.\nEmotive EPOC headset records the raw EEG data for all the 14 electrodes and saves it in\nthe form of an \u201c.edf\u201d file which can be converted to a \u201c.csv\u201d or \u201c.mat\u201d file for further processing. EEG data were recorded for a duration of 6 minutes with each trial consisting of 1 minute which is composed of 30 seconds for the recitation of the situation by psychotherapist and imagination by the subject and 30 seconds for answering the SAM rating scale. The sampling rate of the EPOC headset is 128 Hz and the impedance was kept at 7 kilo-ohms. Raw experimental output for the EEG signal acquired from the Emotiv EPOC headset is shown in Fig 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 8 / 29\n3.1.2 Data analysis. In order to analyze the effect of stimuli in eliciting anxiety, the\nauthors in [12], analyzed the SAM score after every trial of the experiment and HAM-A scores of the subjects at the start and end of the experiment. Russell explained the concept of anxiety as a situation corresponding to low valance and high arousal (LVHA) in a study conducted in [75, 76]. Hence for the measurement of anxiety, the quadrant of LAHV is the main region of focus. To evaluate the relative variability of the participant\u2019s scores for all the six trials of the situation, the Coefficient of Variation (CV) was computed. A mean CV of 0.58 and 0.42 was obtained for valance and arousal score across all the participants for each trial of the experiment which can be regarded as a low variance. The authors have also reported that when the valance and arousal score of the participants was plotted on a 2D plane consisting of Low Valence and Low Arousal (LVLA), High Valence and Low Arousal (HVLA), Low Valence and High Arousal (LVHA), and High Valence and High Arousal (HVHA) quadrants, the majority of the participants were found in the LVHA and LHLA quadrant advocating the fact that the stimuli used was effective in provoking anxiety in most subjects. Moreover, it was also reported that the number of subjects having severe anxiety before the experiment was 7 whereas after facing the stimulus the number of participants augmented to 13 again stressing the fact that stimuli was efficacious in anxiety elicitation."

            "text": "In biomedical signal processing, it is necessary to pre-process the data to suppress the noise and artifacts from the acquired signals so that a clean signal is reached which could be fed to the feature extraction stage to realize decent classification accuracy. EEG signals contaminated by the physiological artifacts generated by parts of the human body other than the human brain include electrooculography (EOG) artifacts (having frequency range less than 4 Hz) and electromyography (EMG) artifacts (having frequency range greater than 30 Hz). Moreover, other than the physiological artifacts generated by different parts of the human body, there also exist artifacts caused by the power line interference having a frequency range of around 50 Hz.\n3.2.1 EEG artifact removal. EOG artifacts can be subdivided into eye blinking and eye movement artifacts. Both types of artifacts belong to low frequencies i.e., less than 4 Hz, but eye blinking artifact has significantly higher amplitude as compared to eye movement artifact.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 9 / 29\nMoreover, the eye blinking artifacts are mainly identified in the EEG data from the frontal electrodes of the headband whereas, on the other hand the eye movement artifacts are characterized by the difference in the symmetry of the left and right brain hemisphere. EMG artifacts can be categorized in two ways i.e., forehead movement and jaw clenching artifacts. Both forehead movement and jaw clenching are primarily an activity consisting of high frequency components i.e., less than 13 Hz with some exception of low frequencies. The presence of these frequencies can significantly deteriorate the diagnosis criterion and can lessen the usefulness of the recorded EEG data significantly. Therefore, these artifacts need to be eliminated from the EEG data to make the diagnoses more effective and reliable. In addition to applying the artifact removal techniques the participants in the experiment were instructed to keep muscles and eye movement minimum to achieve good quality EEG data.\nTo remove EOG and EMG artifacts from the recorded EEG signals, an automatic artifact\nremoval tool of the EEGLab [77] was employed. An appropriate finite impulse response (FIR) bandpass filter having passband ranging from 4 to 45 Hz (order = 15, filter length = 16, window = Hanning) to truncate the baseline, muscular and ocular artifacts from the acquired signals was applied. Moreover, a cutoff frequency of 45 Hz ensures that power line noise interference is also mitigated from the EEG signal. To conquer the effect of EMG noise from the signal, blind source separation canonical correlation analysis-based algorithm implemented in EEGLab was used [78]. The algorithm used a criteria emg_psd which defines a threshold for the average power ratio of the recorded EEG signal and the components which have a value less than the defined threshold are regarded as EMG artifacts and are discarded. The estimator used for the valuation of power spectral density of the EEG signal is hamming window-based Welch periodogram. For the removal of EOG artifacts, the EEGLab uses improved weighted adjusted second-order blind identification method (iWASOBI) and fractal dimension parameter [79]. As a rule of thumb, the signal components having low fractal dimension values corresponds to low-frequency segments of the signal and is a suitable criterion for the identification of EOG components.\nIn the second phase of the pre-processing stage, channel selection is performed by applica-\ntion of student t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for two and four-level, respectively on the EEG data obtained from Emotiv headset. Power spectral density is computed using the Welch algorithm with an overlapping window of 50%. The decision about statistically significant channels of the Emotiv EPOC headset is made on the basis of p-value and the channels are considered statistically significant if the p\ufffd 0.05.

Power spectral density is realized using the Welch method of the Brainstorm3 toolbox in MATLAB. Welch method uses an overlapping window of 50% for computing power spectrum followed by the application of hamming window to each of the overlapped sequences. Next to this, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of each segment was computed and the power of the FFT coefficients of all overlapping windows was averaged out. Hence the raw EEG data is represented by the power spectrum of its frequency bands [80]. Obtained frequency bands of the EEG signal from each channel of the Emotiv EPOC include delta (2-4 Hz), theta (5-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-29 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz) bands. Following this, the feature extraction is performed from these frequency ranges.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 10 / 29\nThe reason for using fast fourier transform (FFT) as a feature extraction method over dis-\ncrete wavelet transform (DWT) are manifold. Firstly, the computational power required to compute the DWT is higher as compared to the FFT algorithm, thus creating computational overhead. Secondly the additional information provided by the DWT over FFT is the time at which a particular frequency occurred in the EEG signal and in this study, we are not interested in locating the events in time, therefore use of DWT instead of FFT only adds to the computational cost. Moreover, when choosing FFT in comparison to discrete cosine transform (DCT) for feature extraction is due to the reason that FFT considers the harmonically related complex exponential functions whereas, DCT only takes real valued cosine functions. Therefore, DCT is more suited over FFT for applications where compression is needed.\nFrequency domain features extracted from the EEG data of the selected channels of the\nEmotiv EPOC headset include rational asymmetry (RASM), mean power (MP), and asymmetry index (AI). RASM is the ratio of the power spectrum for the selected asymmetric channels of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. MP feature is represented by the average of the power spectrum of each band for each selected channel of the Emotiv EPOC headband."

The frequency selection algorithm works by selecting the EEG frequency band which achieves the highest classification accuracy from among all the frequency band combinations. The algorithm iterates this procedure 1000 times to select the optimum frequency band. A combination of features from the theta and beta band of the EEG data resulted in the highest classification accuracy among all frequency band combinations.\nAfter EEG frequency band selection, the features from the selected EEG frequency bands\nare applied upon with the wrapper method for feature selection to select the optimum subset of features. The wrapper method is a recursive feature elimination technique that removes the features which are least correlated with the class labels.\nRecursive feature reduction is a highly efficient optimization technique that extracts the feature subset yielding the highest accuracy. Like any recursive function, this technique calls itself again and again keeping track of the best and the worst performing feature subsets and removing the worst-performing feature subset at the end of the iteration. In the next iteration, the feature selection is performed only with the remaining feature subset. This process continues recursively till the point reaches when there is no change in the feature subset in the subsequent iterations and the algorithm converges resulting in the final optimum subset of features."

A variety of machine learning classifiers with different sets of optimization parameters were used for our proposed anxiety classification scheme. The parameters used for the classification models were chosen using grid search hyperparameter tuning method. KNN is termed as a lazy learning algorithm because it stores all the examples of the training set and computes the distance of the test sample from each example of the training data and the test data is assigned to the class having a smaller Euclidean distance. For the KNN classifier we performed the grid search using values of k = 1,3,5,7,9 but the highest classification accuracy was obtained using k = 5. DT is another non-parametric supervised machine learning technique that is based on entropy measure of\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 11 / 29\nthe data and it classifies the data by building a tree and predicting the output variable for the test data by simple decision rules deduced from the data features. Similarly, for the decision tree classifier we tried different depth values for the tree and found the depth value of 32 to be the optimum. Increasing the tree depth further does not improved the classification performance therefore a tree depth of 32 is used in the current study. RF is an extension of the DT classifier in which we have multiple decision trees (hundred or even thousands of them) and the final classification result is achieved by majority rule i.e., the final decision is the decision of the majority of the decision trees. For the random forest classifier, we used different number of decision trees and a value of 500 trees with a depth of 32 was found to be the best among all and hence it is used in this study. MLP is a back-propagation feed-forward neural network. The simplest kind of MLP network consists of single input, hidden, and output layers. An activation function that transforms the input to the output is implemented in the hidden layer of the network. The Multilayer perceptron classifier was tested with different optimizer and activation functions and the optimum classification results were obtained using 4 hidden layers, \u2018Adam optimizer\u2019 and \u2018Relu activation function\u2019 with a momentum and learning rate of 0.3 and 0.4, respectively. SVM is one of the most well-known algorithms used for supervised machine learning. It classifies the data points by building an N-dimensional hyperplane between the two classes. Radial basis function (RBF) produced the best results and hence is used as a SVM kernel in this study. In the proposed anxiety classification scheme, we have reported the classification results obtained from the best tuned parameters. The recently proposed deep learning methods were not used for the current study because the number of subjects involved in the study were only 23 and therefore the available EEG data was not sufficient to train the deep learning model. In future we intend to acquire EEG data from a larger number of subjects to be able to obtain results for anxiety classification using deep learning models."

To this end, the frequency band selection algorithm proposed in [81] was used to identify the appropriate subset of frequency bands. EEG frequency band selection is applied using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Leave-one out cross validation method is a special type of cross-validation scheme in which the number of folds of the cross validation is equal to the number of instances in the dataset. Leave-one out cross validation treats each instance as a test data for once, while all other instances are considered as a training data. This phenomenon results in k number of models for k instances of data and the average of the classification accuracy obtained from each of the model is considered as the accuracy of the overall model. In the proposed anxiety classification, the number of instances is 4140 hence the value of k in cross-validation is 4140 in this experiment. In our study, it was found that using features only from the theta and beta band of the EEG data from the selected EEG channels resulted in the highest accuracy as compared to all other EEG frequency band combinations both for two and four class anxiety classification for SAM based labeling. Similarly, for HAM-A score-based labeling, the optimum subset of frequency bands include theta and beta band, resulting in the highest classification accuracy both for two and four-class labeling. Fig 7(a) and 7(b) shows the bar graph of the classification accuracy obtained from each of the EEG frequency band combinations using SAMbased labeling for two and four levels, respectively.

            "text": "In this paper, a two and four-level anxiety classification framework is developed by using EEG data of 23 subjects recorded during exposure therapy and using Emotiv EPOC headset. Channel selection is performed to select the statistically significant channels using t-test for twolevel and ANOVA for four-level on the power spectral density of the data from the EEG electrodes. Channels AF3, AF4, FC5, FC6, P7, and P8 are found to be statistically significant from among 14 channels of the Emotiv EPOC headset. Frequency domain features which include mean power, rational asymmetry, and asymmetry index are extracted from the selected EEG channels. Next, the frequency band selection algorithm is applied to identify the appropriate EEG frequency bands which in this study are theta and beta bands. The wrapper method is applied for feature selection from all the features of the selected frequency bands. Finally, the selected subset of features is fed into five different machine learning algorithms i.e., DT, kNN, SVM, MLP, and RF for anxiety classification. RF classifier achieved the highest classification accuracy both for two and four-level anxiety classification. An accuracy of 94.90% and 92.74% is achieved for two and four-level anxiety classification using HAM-A based labeling and RF classifier with a feature vector length of 9 and 10, respectively using data only from 6 selected EEG channels. Many clinical applications which can improve the quality of life of an individual in the society can be derived from the findings of the current study. The limitations of the proposed anxiety classification scheme include a lesser number of participants which restricts us from applying the deep learning model for classification. Moreover, the anxiety elicitation protocol was applied on participants with an average age of 30 years. The results of the experiment with subjects having higher average age e.g., around 50 years still need to be examined to\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265679 March 18, 2022 24 / 29\nfurther validate the findings of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the effect of EEG data recorded from participants with different ethnical background also needs to be examined.\nAuthor Contributions\nFormal analysis: Farah Muhammad.\nFunding acquisition: Saad Al-Ahmadi.\nInvestigation: Farah Muhammad.\nMethodology: Farah Muhammad.\nProject administration: Saad Al-Ahmadi.\nSupervision: Saad Al-Ahmadi.\nValidation: Farah Muhammad.\nVisualization: Farah Muhammad.\nWriting \u2013 original draft: Farah Muhammad.\nWriting \u2013 review & editing: Saad Al-Ahmadi."
