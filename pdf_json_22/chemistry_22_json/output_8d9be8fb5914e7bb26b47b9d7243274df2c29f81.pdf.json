Compound 1 is structurally similar to the complex [Ru(DIP)2(sq)](PF6) (2) (Figure 1, sq= semiquinonate), previously investigated by Gasser and co-workers, which also was found to have cytotoxicity in the nanomolar concentration range in several cancer cell lines (i. e., higher than cisplatin), and a very promising in vivo activity.[34] A small series of similar complexes, resulting from the coordination of substituted catecholate-type dioxo ligands to the same {Ru(DIP)2} core, was investigated as well.[35] All compounds were isolated and studied as racemic mixtures of \u0394 and \u039b enantiomers.\nWe recently developed a synthetic strategy for the microwave-assisted efficient preparation of bis-heteroleptic Ru(II) polypyridyl compounds [Ru(L1)2(L2)]\n2+ that involves the isolation of intermediates of the type [Ru(L1)2(O^O)]Cln, where O^O is a symmetrical anionic dioxo ligand.[36] The dioxo complexes are neutral (n=0) when O^O is oxalate (ox) or malonate (mal), mono-cationic (n=1) when O^O is acetylacetonate (acac). Having this synthetic capability at hand, we decided to extend the studies mentioned above and investigated how the nature and charge of the dioxo ligand affected the anticancer properties of the {Ru(DIP)2} core. For this purpose, we prepared a small series of complexes, both neutral and cationic: [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b7\n2-mal)] (3), [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b72-acac)]Cl (4), and [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b7 2-ox)] (5) (Figure 2). In addition, with the aim of\nassessing the relevance of the diimine ligand, the corresponding complexes bearing 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) in place of DIP were prepared and investigated as well: [Ru(phen)2(\u03b7\n2-mal)] (6), [Ru(phen)2(\u03b72-acac)]Cl (7), and [Ru(phen)2(\u03b72-ox)] (8) (Figure 2).

Compounds 3\u20138 are all soluble in DMSO, chloroform, and in aqueous media containing 1% of DMSO.\nStability studies in DMSO, medium cell culture, and human plasma\nThe biological activity of anticancer drugs candidates is strongly influenced by their stability in DMSO, medium cell culture, and human plasma. For this reason, we performed stability studies of complexes 3\u20138 at 37 \u00b0C in DMSO and DMEM medium (Gibco) (Supporting Information Figures S1 - S2). Importantly, no significant changes in the absorption spectra in DMSO and medium cell culture after 24 h were observed for the series of DIP complexes 3\u20135. In contrast, a small decrease in the absorption band intensity, more marked for the neutral complexes, was observed in the spectra of the phen compounds 6\u20138, probably due to slow partial precipitation. Finally, the stability of the compounds was investigated by incubating them in human plasma at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h, followed by UV-Vis and HPLC analysis. The UV-vis spectra and HPLC chromatograms for compounds 3\u20135, 7, and 8 (Supporting Information Figures S3\u2013 S5) were very similar before and after incubation in human plasma, indicative of good stability of the complexes under biological conditions. A change in the UV spectrum\u2019s shape, indicating chemical transformation, was observed only for the malonate complex 6 (similar to what observed in DMEM, Figure S2). After 48 h, only 15% of the complex was still intact, as observed by HPLC (Supporting Information Figure S5).\nCytotoxicity studies on 2D monolayer cells\nThe first step toward the biological investigation of complexes 3\u20138 was the evaluation of cell viability in monolayer cultures of CT-26 (mouse colon adenocarcinoma), PC-3 (human Caucasian prostate adenocarcinoma), and RPE-1 (human normal retina pigmented epithelial) cell lines using a fluorometric cell viability assay with the Resazurin reagent. Cisplatin and 1 were tested in the same cell lines as positive and additional controls. The IC50 values of the tested compound are reported in Table 1.\nCompounds 3\u20135 with the DIP ligand present the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the micromolar range. In contrast, phen compounds 6\u20138 have much lower cytotoxicity with IC50 higher than 100 \u03bcM (except for 7 in the CT-26 cell line). Of particular interest, in the three cell lines the cationic compound 4 exhibits IC50 values in the mid-nanomolar concentration range, ca. one order of magnitude lower than those of the corresponding neutral complexes. The IC50 values of 4 are comparable with those of 1 in the same cell lines,[33] as well as with those of other complexes previously tested by us.[34\u201335] The results also highlight the importance of the DIP ligand instead of phenanthroline for observing cytotoxicity. This\nis probably due to the higher lipophilicity of this ligand, allowing a better cellular uptake (see below). Disappointingly, this series of novel complexes \u2013 similarly to 1 - did not display any selectivity towards the CT-26 and PC-3 cancer cell lines compared to the healthy cell line RPE-1. However, overall, complex 4 is still the best candidate among the complexes investigated in the 2D model.\nICP-MS cellular uptake studies\nThe cellular uptake of the complexes 3\u20138 was then investigated in CT-26 cells by determining the amount of Ru inside the cells using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after 2 h of incubation at 5 \u03bcM. The cationic complex [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b7\n2-acac)]Cl (4) was found to have the most significant uptake, almost three times larger compared to the phen counterpart [Ru(phen)2(\u03b7\n2-acac)]Cl (7). This is most probably due to the higher lipophilicity of the DIP ligand compared to phen. The uptake of 4 is also ca. three times larger than that of the similar DIP reference complex 1 (in this case, however, the comparison might be affected by the different counter-ion, Cl vs PF6). In contrast, the neutral complexes with the DIP ligand (3 and 5) present a lower uptake (ca. 50%) compared the phen analogues 6 and 8. This observation is rather counter-intuitive since compounds 3 and 5 have a higher cytotoxicity than 6 and 8. The lower uptake of the DIP complexes 3 and 5 might be due to the lower solubility of these complexes in the cell culture medium. However, taken together, the uptake and cytotoxicity data imply that 3 and 5 have a higher specific cytotoxic activity compared to the phen analogues 6 and 8, reasonably attributable to their higher lipophilicity.\nAdditionally, we choose the best candidate from the cytotoxicity experiments, namely [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b7\n2-acac)]Cl (4), to explore its cellular localisation. For this, we performed cellular fractionation experiments to ascertain in which organelle it localizes. The relative biodistribution of 4 among the different subcellular compartments is presented in Figure 4 (right). The complex was found to localize mainly in the mitochondria (ca. 50% of the total amount of Ru), whereas a smaller fraction (ca. 10%) was detected in the nucleus. Interestingly, the similar cationic reference compound 1, contrary to complex 4, was found to accumulate more in the nucleus than in mitochondria.[33]"

Figure 6 represents the Mito stress test profile after 24 h of treatment; the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) changes with specific electron-transport chain inhibitors. Oligomycin (inhibitor of ATP synthase (complex V)), FCCP (uncoupling agent), antimycin-A (complex III inhibitors), and rotenone (complex I inhibitor) were employed in this study. In general, both cationic compounds 4 and 7 affected the mitochondrial processes. It is evident from the low basal respiration and the inhibition of ATP production compared to untreated cells (orange dots) that the mitochondrial membrane of the cells treated with such complexes lost the capacity to restore the proton balance when treated with an uncoupling agent (FCCP). The maximal respiration (the OCR value when the mitochondrial membrane is uncoupled) and spare respiratory capacity (difference in the OCR values between maximal respiration and basal respiration) of the cells were reduced compared to those of untreated cells (Figure 6). The low basal respiration observed in cells treated with the cationic complexes 4, 7, and 1 in comparison to untreated cells indicates a severe impairment of mitochondrial respiration. The results with complex 4 are consistent with its measured large mitochondrial uptake (see above). Interestingly, the effect of 1 is similar to that of 4, even though it has a lower mitochondrial uptake.[33]\nConversely, the neutral DIP and phen compounds show similar profiles as the untreated cells, suggesting that they enter into the mitochondria to a lesser extent (if at all). As a consequence, the cytotoxic activity of the neutral DIP complexes 3 and 5 might have a different origin compared to that of the cationic complex 4."

            "text": "In summary, we performed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study based on the promising activity expressed by the maltol (mlt) complex [Ru(DIP)2(mlt)](PF6) (1) that our groups recently reported.[33] We developed two self-consistent small series of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes of the type [Ru(L1)2(O^O)]Cln, where O^O is a symmetrical anionic dioxo ligand (3 - 8). They allowed us to investigate how the nature of the diimine ligand (L1=1,10-phenanthroline (phen) or 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DIP)), of the dioxo ligand (O^O= oxalate (ox), malonate (mal), acetylacetonate (acac)), and - ultimately - of the charge (n=0 or 1) affected their in vitro anticancer properties. Cytotoxicity studies performed on two cancerous cell lines and one non-tumorigenic cell line in cellular monolayer cultures revealed that the DIP complexes 3\u20135 displayed much higher bioactivities than the corresponding phen complexes 6\u20138. In addition, the cationic acac complex [Ru(DIP)2(\u03b7\n2-acac)]Cl (4) was found to be remarkably more cytotoxic compared to the neutral ones, with IC50 values in the mid-nanomolar range and comparable to those of 1 and of cisplatin. Compound 4 also showed an excellent uptake in CT-\n26 cancer cells, at least three times larger than the neutral DIP complexes of similar lipophilicity 3 and 5, and inhibited their mitochondrial respiration. Conversely, the uptake of the neutral complexes was lower and they did not significantly affect mitochondrial respiration, thus suggesting also a different intracellular distribution (and, possibly, cytotoxic mechanism).\nThese results indicate that cationic polypyridyl-dioxo Ru(II) complexes perform much better than neutral ones and that diimine ligands with large lipophilicity (DIP vs. phen) are to be preferred. Whereas the effect of the lipophilicity of the diimine ligand was somehow expected, the effect of the charge was not obvious, even though consistent with previous results from our and other groups. In a series of complexes in which different catecholate-type dioxo ligands were bound to the {Ru(DIP)2} core, we found that cationic complexes with semiquinonate ligands were much more cytotoxic compared to neutral catecholate compounds.[33\u201335] Consistently, the mono-cationic cyclometalated Ru(II) complex [Ru(bpy)(phpy)(dppz)]+ was found to be rapidly taken up by cancer cells, and nearly 90% of the complex accumulated in their nuclei after a 2 h incubation.[37] On the other hand, a 2+ charge - even in the presence of good lipophilicity - does not seem to be appropriate for anticancer activity: Barton et al. reported that, in the dppz-based Ru(II) complex [Ru(DIP)2(dppz)]\n2+, the lipophilic DIP ligand facilitates complex cellular uptake into the cell cytoplasm but has low inhibition against different tumour cells as it cannot enter into the cell nucleus.[38] In a recent paper, Glazer et al. investigated a series of cationic [Ru(bpy)2(O^O)] + complexes, where O^O is acac or a substituted acac.[24] They found that the in vitro cytotoxicity of the complexes roughly correlates with the lipophilicity/hydrophobicity of the acac ligand (and thus of the complex).[24] The cytotoxic activity of complex 4 is consistent with these results; in Glazer\u2019s complexes, the lipophilicity of the substituted-acac ligands compensates for the less lipophilic bpy ligand (compared to DIP).\nTaken together, these results suggest that, for being effective, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes not only must enter the interior of cells (i. e., have good lipophilicity) but must also be able to reach some important cellular organelles like the cell nucleus and/or the mitochondria (i. e., have a mono-positive charge). In agreement with Glazer\u2019s findings on the good stability of the [Ru(bpy)2(O^O)]\n+ complexes, also in our case we might say that ligand exchange is not a key component of their mechanism of action.\nEven though complex 4 showed no selectivity towards the CT-26 and PC-3 cancer cell lines compared to the healthy cell line RPE-1, in the future, it might be worth to extend such in vitro investigation towards a broader panel of cell lines for ascertaining if this is a general feature. In addition, the problem of low selectivity could be overcome by encapsulation or by conjugation of the complex to targeting biomolecules (e.g., peptides or antibodies).[39\u201340]\nFinally, with these SAR results at hand, and considering the complexes described in this work, we anticipate that complex 4 \u2013 with its promising anticancer properties and excellent cell uptake \u2013 could be used as a model to synthesize novel Ru(II)based anticancer drugs. In particular, it might be worth\nChemBioChem 2022, 23, e202200398 (5 of 7) \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.\nCytotoxicity assay using a 2D cellular model: The cytotoxicity of the tested Ru complexes was assessed by a fluorometric cell viability assay using Resazurin (Acros Organics). Briefly, cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates at a 4\u00d7103 cells/ well density in 100 \u03bcL. After 24 h, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the ruthenium complexes and controls. Dilutions for complexes 3\u20138 were prepared as follows: 10 mM stock solution in\nDMSO was diluted to 100\u20130.01 \u03bcM with medium. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and 100 \u03bcL of complete medium containing resazurin (0.2 mg/mL final concentration) was added. After 4 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the fluorescence signal of the resorufin product was read (ex 540 nm, em 590 nm) in an Infinite 200 PRO Microplate Reader from TECAN. IC50 values were then calculated using GraphPad Prism software.\nICP-MS cellular uptake studies: CT-26 cells were seeded at a density of 1\u00d7106. The next day, cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM of the corresponding complex diluted in the cell culture medium from a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO. After 2 h, cells were collected, counted, and stored at 80 \u00b0C. ICP-MS samples were prepared as follows: samples were digested using 70% nitric acid (1 mL, 60 \u00b0C, overnight) and then further diluted 1 :100 (1% HCl solution in MQ water) analysed using ICP-MS. All ICP-MS measurements were performed on an Agilent 7900 Quadrupole ICP-MS located at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (France). The monitored isotopes are 99 and 101 Ru. Daily, before the analytical sequence, an indium internal-standard was injected after inline mixing with the samples to correct for signal drift and matrix effects. A set of calibration standards was analysed to confirm and model (through simple linear regression) the linear relationship between signal and concentration. The model was then used to convert measured sample counts to concentrations. Reported uncertainties were calculated using error propagation equations and considering the combination of standard deviation on replicated consecutive signal acquisitions (n=3), internal-standard ratio and blank subtraction. The non-linear term (internal-standard ratio) was linearized using a first-order Taylor series expansion to simplify error propagation. The amount of metal detected in the cell samples was transformed from ppb to \u03bcg of metal. Data were subsequently normalized to the number of cells and expressed as \u03bcmol of metal/number of cells.\nSample preparation for cellular fractionation: CT-26 cells were seeded in three 15 cm2 cell culture dishes and cells were 90% confluent on the day of treatment. On the day of treatment, cells were incubated with the target complex at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM for 4 h, then the medium was removed and the cells were washed, collected, and counted. After re-suspension in cold PBS, the organelles were isolated by using different protocols (one cell culture dish per isolation was used).\nMitochondria and nucleus isolation: To isolate mitochondria, a Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Cat. Nr: MITOISO2, SigmaAldrich) and Nucleus Isolation Kit (NUC-101) were used according to the manufacturer procedure for the isolation of mitochondria via homogenization method.\nMetabolic studies: mito stress test: CT-26 cells were seeded in Seahorse XFe 96- well plates at a density of 20 000 cells/well in 80 \u03bcL of the medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and either complex 1 (1 \u03bcM), 3 (5 \u03bcM), 4 (0.5 \u03bcM), 5 (10 \u03bcM), 6 (25 \u03bcM), 7 (10 \u03bcM), or 8 (25 \u03bcM) was added. After 24 h of incubation, the regular medium was removed, and cells were washed three times using Seahorse base media and incubated in a non-CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. A Mito stress assay was run using 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1 \u03bcM FCCP, and a mixture of 1 \u03bcM antimycin-A/1 \u03bcM rotenone in ports A C, respectively, using a Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyser."
