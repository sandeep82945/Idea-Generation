    "abstractText": "Introduction: Biofilm is highly resistant to antibiotics due to its heterogeneity and is implicated in over 80% of chronic infections; these refractory and relapse-prone infections pose a huge medical burden. Methods: In this study, rhamnolipid (RHL), a biosurfactant with antibiofilm activity, was loaded with the antibiotic azithromycin (AZI) to construct a stable nanomicelle (AZI@RHL) that promotes Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm disruption. Results: AZI@RHL micelles made a destruction in biofilms. The biofilm biomasses were reduced significantly by 48.2% (P<0.05), and the main components polysaccharides and proteins were reduced by 47.5% and 36.8%, respectively. These decreases were about 3.1 (15.9%), 7.3 (6.5%), and 1.9 (19.5%) times higher compared with those reported for free AZI. The disruption of biofilm structure was observed under a confocal microscope with fluorescent labeling, and 48.2% of the cells in the biofilm were killed. By contrast, the clearance rates of cells were only 20% and 17% when treated alone with blank micelles or free AZI. Biofilm formation was inhibited up to 92% in the AZI@RHL group due to effects on cell auto-aggregation and eDNA release. The rates for the other groups were significantly lower, with only 27.7% for the RHL group and 12% for the AZI group (P<0.05). The low cell survival and great formation inhibition could reduce biofilm recolonization and re-formation. Conclusion: The antibiofilm efficacy of rhamnolipid was improved through micellar nanoparticle effects when loading azithromycin. AZI@RHL provides a one-step solution that covers biofilm disruption, bacteria inactivation, recolonization avoidance, and biofilm re-formation inhibition.",

Methods: In this study, rhamnolipid (RHL), a biosurfactant with antibiofilm activity, was loaded with the antibiotic azithromycin (AZI) to construct a stable nanomicelle (AZI@RHL) that promotes Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm disruption. Results: AZI@RHL micelles made a destruction in biofilms. The biofilm biomasses were reduced significantly by 48.2% (P<0.05), and the main components polysaccharides and proteins were reduced by 47.5% and 36.8%, respectively. These decreases were about 3.1 (15.9%), 7.3 (6.5%), and 1.9 (19.5%) times higher compared with those reported for free AZI. The disruption of biofilm structure was observed under a confocal microscope with fluorescent labeling, and 48.2% of the cells in the biofilm were killed. By contrast, the clearance rates of cells were only 20% and 17% when treated alone with blank micelles or free AZI. Biofilm formation was inhibited up to 92% in the AZI@RHL group due to effects on cell auto-aggregation and eDNA release. The rates for the other groups were significantly lower, with only 27.7% for the RHL group and 12% for the AZI group (P<0.05). The low cell survival and great formation inhibition could reduce biofilm recolonization and re-formation. Conclusion: The antibiofilm efficacy of rhamnolipid was improved through micellar nanoparticle effects when loading azithromycin. AZI@RHL provides a one-step solution that covers biofilm disruption, bacteria inactivation, recolonization avoidance, and biofilm re-formation inhibition.

            "text": "Antibiotic abuse has induced an increasing potential for drug resistance, a phenotype of which is bacterial biofilm. Biofilms are implicated in ~65% of microbial infections and over 80% of chronic infections in humans according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).1 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm can colonize tissues and implantable devices, and generate refractory and relapse-prone infections such as pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis. Longterm and multiple antibiotic interventions are advocated in chronic infections, but the diseases end with a poor prognosis because of the biofilm heterogeneity. The dense extracellular polymer (EPS) envelope of biofilms acts as a permeability barrier to small-molecule drugs, although few internalized drugs can also be inactivated by biofilms\u2019 enzymes.2 Worse still, the drug tolerance of embedded cells is 10\u20131000 times that of bacterioplankton. Antibiofilm strategies involving debridement, bacterial signaling inhibitors, EPS-degrading agents, combinatorial antibiotic therapies, and nanoparticles are being investigated,3,4 which are mono strategies for early biofilm formation or late biofilm disruption. Strategies should be expected to disrupt the EPS of biofilms directly and kill the exposed bacteria with antimicrobial agents.5 Thus,\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 7403\u20137415 7403 \u00a9 2023 Lin et al.

Exogenous 0.1% RHL was reported to remove 35% of S. aureus biofilms formed on nutrient medium and 86.9% on skim milk medium in only 2 h.12 They can disrupt biofilms by binding to metal ions within EPS and blocking signaling pathways.13 RHL can reduce the surface free energy on biofilms and selectively interfere with proteins in EPS.14 The RHL-involved nanoparticles prepared by Hu et al15 effectively hindered the adhesion of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to biotic and abiotic surfaces, removing a critical step in the recurrence of biofilm reinfection. Therefore, RHL can disrupt mature biofilms and inhibit biofilm formation. It also has excellent potential as a carrier box with no toxicity over traditional synthetic surfactants. Amphiphilic RHL self-assembles into micelles when the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached. The insoluble drug is encapsulated in its hydrophobic core to increase the drug\u2019s solubility.16 However, RHL is a weak antimicrobial agent due to its fairly large MIC (~2%), so combining it with antibiotics is ideal.17 M\u00fcller et al demonstrated the property of RHL to form stable micelle for the effective loading of hydrophobic drugs, including Nile red, dexamethasone, and tacrolimus, for drug delivery to the skin.18 This pioneering research opens up a new application of RHL as a drug delivery system.\nThe nanoparticle drug delivery system is an emerging drug delivery technology with low toxicity, slow release, high efficiency, long-lasting effect, stability, and targeted release.19,20 Quasi-spherical nanoparticles are highly bactericidal because they induce the production of large-area film stretching and rupture due to their small size, surface effects, quantum size effects, bulk effects, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects.21 Nanoparticles with a more remarkable property to act and penetrate biofilm matrices than drug molecules are an emerging strategy for removing mature biofilms.22 Nanoparticles such as silver, zinc oxide, and nitric oxide interfere with the adhesion of S. aureus, thus preventing biofilm formation. The nanoparticles formed by metal integrators and hydrophobic compounds have shown excellent biofilm scavenging activity but are toxicogenic and unsuitable for long-term application.23\nGraphical Abstract\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S436971 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 7404\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nWe hypothesized that the biosurfactant RHL, which disrupts mature biofilms and inhibits biofilm re-formation, can load the azithromycin (AZI) to form stable micelles. The micelles allow the antimicrobial agents to kill bacteria in unison and elevate the antibiofilm efficacy with the nanoparticle effect."

The exclusive RHL encapsulated the sensitive antibiotic AZI to eradicate S. aureus biofilm and inhibit its re-formation. AZI@RHL micelles possessed an average size of 136.3\u00b168.5 nm and an average Z-potential of \u201323.1\u00b16.8 mV with a good size distribution (Figure 1A and D). Blank micelles without loading AZI have an average size of 150.9\u00b1113.0 nm and an average Z-potential of \u201337.6\u00b14.7 mV (Figure 1A). Decreased particle size of AZI@RHL micelles may be caused by the increased charge repulsion from AZI that favors demicellization.25 The changes in size and zeta potential confirmed the success of encapsulating AZI in the core of RHL. From the TEM image (Figure 1C), spherical and dispersed micelles are formed and substances were encapsulated in cores. The ideal size of AZI@RHL ensured its subsequent diffusion in the mucuslike biofilm; the particle size is highly correlated with steric hindrance, and the water channels of biofilms allow the passage of particles of about 200 nm.10 In addition, AZI@RHL micelles had a high encapsulation rate (80.34%) and loading efficiency (19.42%), which significantly increased the solubility of AZI. The cumulative release rate of AZI@RHL was about 29.9% in the first 2 h, and it reached 68.7% at 36 h, indicating that AZI@RHL micelles have a sustained release effect (Figure 1F). The release process fit well with the Ritger-Peppas equation (Q = 23.7264 (t^0.2996), R2=0.9880), and the release value of 0.2996 indicated that AZI@RHL micelles released AZI mostly through Fick diffusion.26\nThe CMC value of RHL was measured as low as 0.25 mg/mL, which allowed structurally stable nanocarriers. This was consistent with the results of the temperature influence test, where AZI@RHL micelles showed stability at 60 \u00b0C (Figure 1G). The property of RHL to withstand high temperatures was also reported.27 However, AZI@RHL micelles were unstable under intense light for a long time. The freshly prepared micelle solution was brownish-yellow and transparent (Figure 1B). The color gradually lightened up (not shown), accompanied by a significantly decreased encapsulation rate (Figure 1G, P<0.05) after intense light exposure. The light-proof storage is necessary, or freeze-\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S436971 DovePress 7407\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ndrying is also a good option. The lyophilized micelles powder has the characteristics of a faint yellow color, uniform texture, and good reconstitution (Figure 1B). RHL is formed by one or two rhamnoses (hydrophilic) molecules linked to one or two fatty acids (hydrophobic), which are saturated or unsaturated alkyl chains.28 Intense light accompanied by heat readily oxidizes unsaturated alkyl chains.\nThe hemocompatibility results (Figure 1E) of AZI@RHL micelles showed that the hemolysis rate was less than 5% at 16 \u00b5g/mL, a non-toxic dose range. Meanwhile, 32 \u00b5g/mL AZI@RHL resulted in a high hemolysis rate of 82.56%,\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S436971 DovePress International Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 7408\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nsuggesting that the dose should be administered via different routes, especially avoiding high intravenous doses. Therefore, our subsequent experimental doses were lower than 16 \u00b5g/mL."

Meanwhile, AZI@RHL micelles could inhibit over 90% of bacteria at a concentration of 16 \u00b5g/mL. Hence, MIC(AZI) was 32 \u00b5g/mL, and MIC(AZI@RHL) was 16 \u00b5g/mL. The blank micelles had a weak bacterial inhibition, which is presumed to be one of the reasons for the superior inhibition effect of AZI@RHL micelles over AZI. The production of large area film stretching and rupture induced by nanoparticle surface effects, quantum size effects, bulk effects, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects may also be a significant reason.21 This finding demonstrated that the micellar shell has no influence on the interaction of AZI with bacteria."

            "text": "Prior to biofilm experiments, the growth curve of S. aureus biofilm was established (Figure 2B). S. aureus biofilm formation is a dynamic process divided into four main stages: 1. Adherence phase: planktonic single cells, selfaggregates, or coaggregates adhered directly to the surface or co-adhered. Most bacteria are still planktonic and are only wrapped in some EPS, which can be reversed. 2. Proliferative phase: activation of specific gene expression induces the massive secretion of EPS and proliferation within the shelter to escape the external attack, which is irreversible. 3. Mature phase: mushroom-like microcolony mature biofilm formed and easily transfer to the next stage due to various factors such as external environment, strain differences, and signaling. 4. Dissemination phase: biofilms are dispersed, and the released bacteria can migrate and reselect new carriers to establish new infections.2 On the basis of the growth curve of S. aureus biofilm, the biofilm formation inhibition experiment should be administered at 0 h with drug treatment of 12 h, and the mature biofilm disruption experiment should be administered after 3 d. The enormity of disrupting mature biofilms and the importance of avoiding recolonization and re-formation could also be seen based on the dynamics and cycling process of the biofilm."

            "text": "The biofilm clearance rates were increased in a dose-dependent manner after treated with AZI, blank micelles, and AZI@RHL micelles (Figure 2C). The biofilms showed a maximum clearance of only 15.9% in the presence of AZI. The resistance of S. aureus biofilm to AZI was confirmed in previous research.29 The failure of AZI against biofilms is mainly attributed to the biofilm matrix: the hydrophobic drug fails to penetrate the EPS.30 Meanwhile, AZI may interact with and be inactivated by the proteins, eDNA, and polysaccharides in EPS.31 Therefore, antibiotics alone do not provide an excellent antibiofilm effect. RHL exhibited EPS clearance, with 24.7% biofilm clearance of blank RHL micelles at 16 \u00b5g/ mL. At the same dose, AZI@RHL micelles showed a 48.2% clearance rate of up to 80% at 64 \u00b5g/mL (data not shown) and exhibited significant effects over AZI and blank micelles at all doses (P<0.05). In addition, AZI@RHL micelles had a clearance rate of 41.8%, which was higher than AZI at their respective sub-MIC. The multifunctional nanoparticle of chitosan/RHL loading clarithromycin (PEG/CLR/RHL25 LPNs) prepared by Hu was used to remove H. pylori biofilm, and only 59.9% clearance rate of biofilm was achieved with a dose of 160 MIC.15 The biofilm was further visualized by FITC-Con A specifically labelable binding D-(+)-glucose and D-(+)-mannose moieties of the major component polysaccharides of EPS (Figure 2E). The extensive S. aureus biofilm with abundant EPS matrix in the control was observed under a confocal microscope. Consistent with the crystal violet results, the blank micelles showed a slight EPS dispersion effect but almost none was observed for AZI alone. A remarkable reduction in biofilm biomass and thickness was observed after treatment with AZI@RHL micelles. Therefore, RHL could disrupt the critical matrix surrounding the bacteria and assist antibiotics kill the bacteria within biofilms.32\nThe biofilm comprises 10\u201325% bacterial cells and 75\u201390% EPS matrix envelope.33 The effect of AZI@RHL on bacteria and EPS components, including polysaccharides and proteins, was also investigated to further evaluate the antibiofilm activity of AZI@RHL.

By contrast, the AZI group was less effective at 6.5% polysaccharide clearance rate (Figure 2D). All groups exhibited protein clearance, with AZI, blank micelles, and AZI@RHL micelles reaching the rates of 19.5%, 29.2%, and 36.85%, respectively (P>0.05). AZI@RHL micelles caused a more significant reduction in live bacteria, achieving a rate (47.22%) higher than the sum of those for free AZI and RHL blank micelles (P<0.05). Almost no difference in bactericidal effect was found between AZI (17.0%) and RHL (20.0%) (P>0.05). This result suggested that RHL had a solid property to disrupt S. aureus biofilm but not to kill the bacteria, which was consistent with the previous report that RHL could disrupt Yarrowia lipolytica biofilm without affecting bacterial growth.34 Surfactants are often used in sludge dewatering and have the capability of dissolving EPS and converting it to soluble organics.35 The hydrophilic nature of EPS is mainly due to its components of hydrated polysaccharides, protein, and DNA molecules. Its hydrophobic characteristics are attributed to polysaccharide-linked methyl and acetyl groups. EPS also contains lipids and their derivatives. These biosurfactants can disperse hydrophobic substances in the medium to dissolve EPS.36 The protein denaturing property of surfactants should be considered.37 RHL was reported to have the property to disrupt biofilm by mediating signaling pathways, binding metal ions, or some other ways.38,39\nThe biofilm structure and bacteria state inside the biofilm were observed by fluorescence microscopy; all bacteria were labeled green, and the dead ones were labeled red (Figure 2F). The excellent effect of AZI@RHL micelles on the biofilms and bacteria within the biofilms was further confirmed. Numerous green live bacteria within dense biofilms were observed in the control. AZI@RHL micelles showed a good bactericidal property, causing loose biofilm structure, reduced biomass, and many red dead internal bacteria in the merge plot. However, some certain red dead bacteria were observed in all test groups. This finding consistently proved RHL\u2019s weak antibacterial activity. Although AZI can harm bacteria by hampering protein synthesis, AZI alone showed no efficacy against embedded bacteria. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of EPS and to the low antibiotic sensitivity of biofilm bacteria due to reduced growth and inactive metabolism.40 We speculated that the small size, slightly negative and hydrophilic surface of AZI@RHL micelles allowed the penetration through the EPS and contribute to this result. Therefore, AZI@RHL micelle showed promising results in antimicrobial drug delivery and antibiofilm activity."

            "text": "Bacteria dispersed from the impaired biofilm can re-adhere and re-form biofilms on new surfaces, leading to recurrent episodes of infections. In addition to the eradication of mature biofilms, prevention of biofilm re-formation is also essential for the treatment of biofilm-associated infections. After demonstrating the property of AZI@RHL micelle to disrupt biofilms, we verified its inhibitory property. As shown in Figure 3B, AZI@RHL micelles with 1/2MIC (8 \u00b5g/mL) and 1/4MIC (4 \u00b5g/mL) efficiently inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation. AZI@RHL micelles showed 92.13% inhibition at 8 \u00b5g/mL, although only 23.74% was achieved at 4 \u00b5g/mL (P<0.05). Free AZI and blank micelles exhibited poor inhibition, with only 12.0% and 27.7% at 8 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, and 6.4% and 14.7% at 4 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (P <0.05).\nThe inhibitory property of AZI@RHL micelles on S. aureus biofilms was also examined by crystal violet staining. The initial adhesion capacity, auto-aggregation capacity, and eDNA release capacity of S. aureus were analyzed to further determine the mechanism. Initial adhesion is the first and critical step in biofilm formation. S. aureus can adhere to abiotic surfaces through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and biological surfaces by various CWA proteins targeting different substrates. These proteins have different binding specificities for host substrate components such as fibronectin, fibrinogen, and collagen. The hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface is determined by the bacterial surface proteins. After AZI@RHL micelle treatment, the reduced number of colonies on the plate indicated that bacterial adhesion was affected (Figure 3A). RHL is adsorbed on the cell surface and alters the proteins, carbohydrates, and membrane phospholipids on the cell surface through solubilization and the release of apolar membrane components. These alterations probably cause the reduction in cell surface hydrophobicity and the changes in cell permeability or cell lysis, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.41\nAfter initial attachment, multiple intercellular aggregation factors are produced by S. aureus to maintain the stability of the immature biofilm.3 Cell aggregation is the basis for close contact and signal exchange between bacteria. The rate of bacterial auto-aggregation decreased from 22.3% to 17.1% (P>0.05) (Figure 3C) in presence of AZI@RHL micelles.\nInternational Journal of Nanomedicine 2023:18 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S436971 DovePress 7411\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nThus, cellular communication was impeded. Surfactants have been considered as additives in biotherapeutic agents owing to their antiaggregation properties.42 However, marine bacteria aggregation was reportedly assisted by the anionic surfactant, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, at high concentrations.43 Matrix component eDNA must be released from dead cells into the extracellular environment. eDNA is inserted into transposons or pathogenicity islands of other bacteria and contributes to the communication of virulence factor and antibiotic resistance factor genes. In this study, the amount of eDNA released decreased from 10.0 ng/\u00b5L to 7.4 ng/\u00b5L, a reduction of 26.09% (P<0.05). Cellular communication was further impeded, and biofilm evolution was inhibited. However, whether the low eDNA amount is caused reduced secretion or degradation remains unclear. The key to S. aureus biofilm formation is CWA protein-mediated adhesion, information exchange after tight bacterial binding, and substances secretion. The biosurfactant RHL disrupts the bacterial lipid membrane and couples with the micelle-carrying AZI for bacteriostasis, thereby inhibiting biofilm formation.\nOverall, the above results demonstrated that AZI@RHL micelles possessed an excellent property to disrupt S. aureus biofilm and inhibit its re-formation. However, the effect of AZI@RHL micelles to curb S. aureus biofilm infection in vivo needs further research."

It prominently reduced biofilm biomass, eliminated EPS, destroyed biofilm architecture and decreased bacteria viability within the biofilm. Besides, AZI@RHL could also inhibit bacteria adhesion to the abiotic surfaces, auto-aggregation and eDNA release to prevent biofilm regeneration. The results verified that AZI@RHL micelles possessed the most effective antibiofilm activity by combining the disrupting property of RHL and the antibacterial abilities of AZI in a drug delivery system. In summary, AZI@RHL micelles provided a one-step solution to S. aureus biofilm problems and highlighted a promising strategy to address persistent S. aureus infection. The property of AZI@RHL micelles to counter biofilm infections in vivo must be verified in further trials."
