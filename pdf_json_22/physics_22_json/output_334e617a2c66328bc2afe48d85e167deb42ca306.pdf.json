    "abstractText": "This study provides new sets of experimental results supporting Westerlund\u2019s conjecture that Dead Matter Has Memory [1]. Memory effects in the dynamic response of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) that integrate its prior history of stimulation and state have been experimentally observed and reported in a few recent studies. The different excitation signals used to quantify such effects in these studies aimed at charging a device to the same voltage value and the exact same accumulated charge level but in different manners. Having reached the same unique voltage-charge point, it was observed that different yet repeatable discharge patterns occur, proving the existence of memory. The aim of this work is to provide further experimental evidence of the inherent memory effect in EDLCs in response to time-varying stationary input excitations with different statistical properties. In particular, different sets of charging voltage waveforms composed of fixed dc values with superimposed uniformly-distributed random fluctuations of different amplitudes were created and used to charge the same EDLC device to a unique voltage-charge point. The duration of these signals was the same but with different values of variance around the mean value. We observed different timecharge responses depending on the extent of the noise level in these charging waveforms. This is interpreted and discussed in the context of inherent memory using fractional-order voltagecharge equations of non-ideal capacitors.",

INTRODUCTION\nOver 30 years ago, Westerlund [1] highlighted the memory effect in non-ideal capacitors that follow power-law (dis)charge dynamics giving rise to the conclusion that dead matter must have memory. In a follow-up article, Westerlund and Ekstam [2] established the mathematical foundation of capacitor theory in the context of fractional-order calculus which cannot be avoided for the accurate modeling of nonideal capacitive devices. The booming interest in fractional calculus and fractional-order dynamics has enabled more recent in-depth studies on the memory effect in dielectrics [3], neuron models [4], [5] and supercapacitors [6]. The experimental work done using supercapacitors in particular has provided solid proof of the existence of memory leaving no doubt to the validity of the dead matter has memory conjecture [7]. Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices known for their outstanding power performance, excellent reversibility and long cycle life, but they are still lagging\nbehind in terms of energy density when compared with batteries. Their charge storage mechanisms can be either physical, i.e. purely electrostatic ion adsorption in the electric doublelayer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, or pseudocapacitive via highly reversible and relatively fast redox reactions, or both. Furthermore, the transport dynamics in such devices in response to an external excitation is mainly subdiffusive [8], which can be attributed to several factors including the porous nature of the electrodes, their fractal geometries and also because of internal friction forces and continuous scattering of ions diffusing in the supporting electrolytes and through the wetted pores [9]. In addition, different types of inter-ion interactions, crowdedness and buffering in narrow pores play a role in establishing retarded diffusion processes in these devices [8]. From a system-level perspective, the dynamics of supercapacitors follow a power-law behavior which can be viewed as the collective result of many coupled processes with different widely distributed time constants [10]. Multiple time scale dynamics hint at the existence of memory effects that take into account the global, non-local time behavior of past activities up to the present time. This type of behavior can be well described with fractional-order integro-differential equations [11], [12].\nIn recent years, there has been an intense effort to experimentally verify and quantify the memory effect in EDLCs. For example, in [7] it was shown that discharging a supercapacitor into a constant resistor from the same voltage and charge point reached using two different charging waveforms (step voltage and linear voltage ramp) of two different durations leads to two different responses, mostly in the short term, transient regime. This indicated that contrary to ideal capacitors, knowledge of the initial condition is not sufficient to determine the present and future states. In a second study [13], a quantitative estimate of memory using the voltage memory trace interpretation of fractional-order dynamics [5] was provided. A follow-up paper by the same group illustrated the application of the memory effect by sequentially encoding information into the charging pattern of the device, and then uniquely retrieving the coded information from the discharge response [14].\nIn this work, we further investigate the memory effect of supercapacitors, albeit in response to time-varying stationary voltage excitations. The input voltage waveforms are derived from uniform distributions of different sample ranges, means and variances. It is observed that the extent of the noisy exci-\n2 tation around the mean value (i.e. the prehistory and features of the charging sequence) determine the actual response of the device at any given time. The cross correlation function between charge and voltage shows a visible degree of correlation, and thus short term memory effects, that fade out as the time lag is increased. We also allude to the effect of noise variance on the weighted sum memory trace that takes into account all prior history of the device. It is worth mentioning that in a recent study [15] aimed at explaining the cardiac memory where the electrical activity in the heart depends on the prior history of one or more system state variables the following was mentioned: . . . Memory is represented via capacitive memory, due to fractional-order that arises due to non-ideal behavior of membrane capacitance. Therefore, we believe that studying the memory effect in capacitive devices is of significant importance."

            "text": "Consider a linear capacitive device characterized in the frequency domain (steady-state condition) by a capacitive system function C(s) (s = j2\u03c0f with f being the frequency), such that the charge-voltage relationship is given by:\nQ(s) = C(s)V (s) (1)\nThe corresponding time-domain charge-voltage relationship would then be represented in terms of a hereditary (convolution) integrals as [16], [17]:\nq(t) =\n\u222b t\n0\nc(t\u2212 \u03c4)v(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = (c\u229b v)(t)\n=\n\u222b t\n0\nv(t\u2212 \u03c4)c(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = (v \u229b c)(t) (2)\nwhere the lower limit of the integrals can also be taken to be \u2212\u221e to reflect infinite past. Here in Eqs. 1 and 2, f(t)\u2190\u2192 F (s) represents the pair of time-domain function f(t) and its frequency-domain Laplace transform F (s), assumed to exist, i.e. L{f(t)}(s) = F (s) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e f(t)e\u2212stdt and\nL\u22121{F (s)}(t) = f(t) = (2\u03c0j)\u22121 \u222b a+j\u221e\na\u2212j\u221e F (s)estds. Analy-\nsis and discussions on these formulas and others for describing non-ideal capacitive devices can be found for instance in some of our recent work [18]\u2013[20]. The integral in Eq. 2 indicates that the accumulated charge in the device at an instant t depends on the values of the applied voltage taken at times in the interval \u03c4 \u2208 [0, t] weighted by the convolution kernel c(t\u2212 \u03c4) characteristic of the device under study.\nFor the particular case of an ideal capacitor we write c(t\u2212 \u03c4) = C1 where C1 is a constant, independent of time or frequency. Thus, Eq. 2 simplifies to be the well-known relation\n\u2206q(t) = C1\u2206v(t) (3)\nwhere \u2206q(t) is evidently equal to q(t) \u2212 q(0), where q(0) is an initial arbitrary charge stored on the device. The same is for the voltage difference \u2206v(t). Ideal capacitors are therefore said to be memoryless devices.\nHowever, if the convolution kernel c(t\u2212\u03c4) is not a constant, then all events over the history of the device contribute to its current state of charge. The capacitance of electrochemical\ncapacitors including EDLCs, pseudocapacitors and hybridized versions of the two cannot be taken as a constant. This is due to their complex structures, inhomogeneities and porosities of their electrodes, leading to distributed response times. These devices have been shown to exhibit fractional-order behavior [3], [6], [12], [21] that requires for their frequency-domain modeling invoking a fractional-order impedance function, e.g.:\nZCPE = V (s)\nI(s) =\n1\nC\u03b1s\u03b1 (4)\nNote that s\u03b1 = \u03c9\u03b1\u2220\u03b1\u03c0/2, with 0 < \u03b1 6 1 and C\u03b1 is in units of F s\u03b1\u22121 [22]. The fractional-order capacitor is also known as the constant phase element (CPE) and its impedance reduces to that of an ideal capacitor 1/(C1s) when \u03b1 = 1. The use of a fractional-order model indicates a priori that memory effects should be expected in time-domain experiments. We note in this regards that the time-domain voltage-current relationship corresponding to Eq. 4 is given, by inverse Laplace transform, by the integro-differential equation:\ni(t) = C\u03b1 C 0 D \u03b1 t v(t) (5)\ninstead of the traditional ODE, i(t) = C1dv(t)/dt, known for ideal capacitors. The operator C0 D \u03b1 t represents here the rightsided Caputo time fractional derivative of order \u03b1 > 0,\nC 0 D \u03b1 t f(t) =\n1\n\u0393(m\u2212 \u03b1)\n\u222b t\n0\n(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212\u03b1\u22121+mf (m)(\u03c4)d\u03c4 (6)\nwhere m \u2212 1 < \u03b1 6 m, m \u2208 N, and f (m)(\u03c4) is the mth derivative of f(\u03c4) (in our case m = 1). Again, this type of integrals indicate that all prior history of the function should be accounted for in order to determine the actual behavior of the device at the present time t. This can also be viewed from the finite difference approximation of Eq. 6. For tk = k\u2206t, k = 0, 1, . . . ,K and using a time step \u2206t = T/K , then for all 0 6 k 6 K \u2212 1 we have:\nC 0 D \u03b1 t v(tk+1) \u2248\n1\n\u0393(2\u2212 \u03b1)\nk \u2211\nj=0\nbj [v(tj+1)\u2212 v(tj)]\n(\u2206t) \u03b1 (7)\nwhere bj = [ (k + 1\u2212 j)1\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 (k \u2212 j)1\u2212\u03b1 ]\n, with a (2 \u2212 \u03b1)order accuracy in time [23]. We can rewrite Eq. 7 as:\nC 0 D \u03b1 t v(tk+1) \u2248\n(\u2206t)\u2212\u03b1\n\u0393(2\u2212 \u03b1) {v(tk+1)\u2212 v(tk) +\nk\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\nbj [v(tj+1)\u2212 v(tj)]} (8)\nwhich is the the sum of the immediate past of the voltage (first two terms, weighted by the Gamma function and the fractional time, (\u2206t)\u03b1) and a memory trace [5] (summation term) that contains voltage information about all previous activity of the device. The memory trace term increases when the fractional order \u03b1 in Eq. 8 decreases further away from one [4], [13]. It is understood that at the limiting case of \u03b1 = 1 (corresponding to first order integer derivative), the behavior of the differentiable function is determined only locally in an infinitesimal neighborhood of the considered point. In this case, the memory trace part vanishes, and does not have any\n3 effect on the dynamics of the device [4], which is simply a memoryless capacitor.\nReferring back to the convolution integrals and their system function kernels, the expression of the current represented by Eq. 6 with m = 1 (i.e. 0 < \u03b1 6 1) can be written as the Laplace convolution:\ni(t) = C\u03b1t\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u229b\ndv(t)\ndt (9)\nwhere the capacitive kernel is the power law function\nc(t) = C\u03b1t\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b1) (10)\nthat tends to zero as t\u2192 \u221e. The charge-voltage relationship for these non-ideal capacitive devices in response to a voltage signal v(t) is not simply \u2206q(t) = C1\u2206v(t) (Eq. 3), but rather:\nq(t) = C\u03b1t\n\u2212\u03b1\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b1) \u229b v(t) (11)\nor in discrete form:\n\u2206q(t) = C\u03b1\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u03b1)\nk \u2211\nj=0\n(t\u2212 tj) \u2212\u03b1v(tj) (12)\nThis relation clearly indicates the presence of a memory effect in these devices [5]."

(d) Plot of the ratio \u2206q/\u2206v vs. time and (e) plot of Rvq(\u03c4) (Eq. ??) vs. number of time lags\noverall trends of the curves start first with a relatively quick power-law growth of the accumulated charge followed by an asymptotic limit as the charging time is increased [14]. We also observe from this quasi-stationary signal that in response to a sudden change of a voltage stimulus, the device responds accordingly with relatively large change in the instantaneous charge, followed by slower adaptation until the next change in voltage input (see Fig. 2(c)). The overall extent of change in the accumulated charge superposed on the general trend is accentuated by the increase in variance of the input voltage signal (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c)). This leads to the primary important conclusion that the device\u2019s accumulated charge adapts to changes in the stimulus statistics, not only in terms of its mean value but also in its variance.\nPlots of the point-by-point ratios of charge to voltage are shown in Fig. 2(d). These results show also that by the end of the charging period, the overall accumulated charges are different from each other even though the last value of voltage was set to 0.5 V in all cases2.\nIn Fig. 2(e), plots of normalized cross-correlations between voltage and charge for the different levels of noise used are shown. The cross-correlation is defined as Rvq(\u03c4) = E {v(t) q(t + \u03c4)} where E {\u00b7} denotes the expected value. The charge-voltage correlation as a function of time lag when the dc voltage input signal is superposed with the highly\n2The same is observed for the other tested scenarios, i.e. with different mean values and different excitation durations.\nfluctuating signal of \u03c32 = 83.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 V2 always shows lower values compared to the cases with lower variance values. This indicates a lack of correlation between the two variables and thus the invalidity of the constitutive relation \u2206q(t) = C1\u2206v(t), which applies for the case of ideal capacitors only [19]. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient defined as \u03c1vq = Cov{v, q}/\u03c3v\u03c3q where Cov {\u00b7} denotes the covariance between v and q are found to be -0.0491, - 0.0297, 0.0684 and 0.2141 for the four different superposed signals respectively. The highest value of \u03c1vq goes with the highest variance of noise. This is an indicator that the device remembers the extent of the noise level.\nIn connection with Eq. 12 which indicates that the memory trace term is more pronounced when the value of \u03b1 decreases, we note that the magnitude of non-dc frequency components of the voltage input v(t) increase with the increase of variance of the uniform noise (see DTFT of voltage excitations in Fig. 3). The stronger high-frequency components in the excitation signal are directly related to the increase of impedance phase angle in the device (i.e. lower value for \u03b1), as depicted in Fig. 1(b). Hence, the higher are the magnitudes of these frequency components, the stronger is the effect of the memory trace term in Eq. 12. To further verify this point, Eq. 12 was numerically executed with the same voltage signals applied experimentally on the supercapacitor device (Fig. 2(a)), and with C\u03b1 and \u03b1 being 0.660 F sec \u03b1\u22121 and 0.905, respectively. These values are estimates of the CPE model parameters used\n5\nto fit the impedance data measured at different dc voltage biases. The normalized cross-correlations between these voltage signals and their corresponding charges obtained via Eq. 12 are plotted in Fig. 4, and show similar trends to the experimental results (see Fig. 2(e)).\nlower values of the fractional coefficient \u03b1, and thus with a"

            "text": "In summary, we have provided further experimental evidence of the inherent memory effect in EDLCs which results from the complex multi-time scale dynamics of their internal microscopic structure and mechanisms. These results, in conjunction with those previously reported in [14], show that it is possible to encode information in the statistical distribution of the random noise signal superimposed on the dc step charging voltage of a device. From the fractional calculus modeling point of view, the memory effect in these devices is attributed to stronger higher frequency harmonics of the input signal, and as a consequence to the extent of deviation of the device from ideality. In other words, high variance fluctuations make the device operate in a less capacitive, more resistive mode with\nstronger memory trace that integrates all past values of its state. We believe that there is no further doubt regarding the validity of the \u201ddead matter has memory\u201d conjecture [1]."
