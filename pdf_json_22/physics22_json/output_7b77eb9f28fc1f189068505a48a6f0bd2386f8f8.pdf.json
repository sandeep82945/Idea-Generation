We discover that zeros of the partition function lead to poles in the internal energy and logarithmic singularities in the Helmholtz free energy that create divergent expansions in the canonical ensemble. Analyzing these zeros reveals that the radius of convergence increases at higher temperatures. In contrast, when the reference state is degenerate, these poles in the internal energy create a zero radius of convergence in the zero-temperature limit.

Furthermore, finite-temperature perturbation theory can diverge at zero temperature even when the zero-temperature perturbation expansion is convergent.10 This situation arises for degenerate or incorrect reference states and its manifestation in electronic perturbation theory is known as the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem.11 However, the general relationship between the convergence of finite-temperature perturbation theory and its zero-temperature counterpart has not yet been fully established. The convergence of a perturbation expansion H = H + \u03bbH can be mathematically examined by investigating the structure of the energy function E(\u03bb) in the complex-\u03bb plane. From complex analysis, the radius of convergence rc for a perturbation expansion of a function f (\u03bb) is determined by the distance of the closest singularity of f (\u03bb) to the origin in the complex-\u03bb plane. These singularities represent points where f (\u03bb) becomes non-analytic and may correspond to a pole, a branch point, or a more complicated non-analytic feature. The perturbation expansion will converge for the physical system at \u03bb = 1 when rc > 1 and will diverge for rc < 1. Therefore, understanding the convergence of finite-temperature perturbation theory requires a detailed investigation into the structure of thermodynamic functions in the complex-\u03bb plane. Complex analysis also plays an important role in the theory of thermodynamic phase transitions. In Lee\u2013Yang theory, zeros of the partition function exist at complex temperatures for finite systems near a phase transition. These zeros converge onto the real axis in the thermodynamic limit and intersect at the critical temperature.

Finally, we extend these results to directly connect zero-temperature exceptional points and finite-temperature zeros of the partition function in the theory of quantum phase transitions.\nWe illustrate these ideas using a two-level system representing a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. In the spinor basis of the S\u0302z operator, the Hamiltonian is\nH = \u239b \u239c \u239d \u2212Bz \u2212Bx \u2212Bx Bz \u239e \u239f \u23a0 , (1)\nwhere Bz and Bx are the (real) components of the magnetic field along the z and x directions, respectively. For Bx = 0 and Bz > 0, the ground state represents an electron aligned in the positive z direction while the excited state represents an electron aligned with the negative z direction. In the Bz \u2192 0 limit, the electron in its ground state aligns with the positive (negative) x direction for positive (negative) Bx and a quantum phase transition occurs at Bx = 0. Any two-state system of this type can be seen as a qubit.\nWithin perturbation theory, the Hamiltonian is partitioned into a Hermitian reference Hamiltonian H(0) and a perturbation H(1).12 The time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is then recast as\nH(\u03bb)\u03a8k(\u03bb) = (H(0) + \u03bbH(1))\u03a8k(\u03bb) = Ek(\u03bb)\u03a8k(\u03bb), (2)\nwhere the parameter \u03bb controls the strength of the perturbation. The exact energies and wave functions of the ground and excited states become \u03bb-dependent functions, with \u03bb = 0 corresponding to the\nreference model and \u03bb = 1 representing the physical system. Expanding the energy around \u03bb = 0 gives the power series\nEk(\u03bb) = \u221e\n\u2211 j=0\nE( j)k \u03bb j, (3)\nwhere E( j)k provides the jth-order perturbation correction. This expansion has a radius of convergence rc that controls the values of \u03bb where the partial sums of increasing length tend toward the exact value of Ek(\u03bb).\nWhen H(\u03bb) is considered in the complex-\u03bb plane, it becomes non-Hermitian and the discrete eigenvalues become unified as a continuous Riemann surface.26 This Riemann surface represents a \u201cone-to-many\u201d function, with each sheet representing a different eigenstate. The most common singularities on E(\u03bb) are exceptional points (or branch points) where the two energy levels become degenerate and the eigenstates become identical.12,13,21,27\u201329 These non-Hermitian features are related to the onset of dynamic stabilities, avoided level crossings, and quantum phase transitions.21 Remarkably, following an eigenstate around an exceptional point interconverts the two energy levels,23,26,27,30 a property that has even been realized experimentally.31,32\nThe reference and perturbation Hamiltonians for the two-level system can be defined as\nH(0) = \u239b \u239c \u239d \u2212Bz 0 0 Bz \u239e \u239f \u23a0 and H(1) = \u239b \u239c \u239d 0 \u2212Bx \u2212Bx 0 \u239e \u239f \u23a0 , (4)\nwith the exact zero-temperature eigenstates\nE\u00b1(\u03bb) = \u00b1 \u221a B2z + \u03bb2B2x. (5)\nHere, the ground and excited state are defined as E1 = E\u2212 and E2 = E+, respectively. These eigenstates form an artificial avoided level crossing along the real-\u03bb axis at \u03bb = 0 that mirrors the true avoided crossing along the real Bx axis. The corresponding twosheeted Riemann surface is shown in Fig. 1(a). When the discriminant in Eq. (5) is zero, the eigenstates become degenerate, creating square-root branch points at \u03bbbp = \u00b1iBz/Bx. Since these exceptional points are the only singularities in E(\u03bb), the radius of convergence is rc = \u2223 BzBx \u2223 and the zero-temperature perturbation expansion converges at the physical value \u03bb = 1 when \u2223Bx\u2223 < \u2223Bz \u2223.\nWe now consider a canonical ensemble of non-interacting subsystems, where the partition function of a general N-level system is\nZ(\u03bb) = N\n\u2211 k=1 exp(\u2212\u03b2Ek(\u03bb)). (6)\nHere, \u03b2 = (kBT)\u22121 and kB and T denote the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. The internal energy is\nU(\u03bb) = \u2212d ln Z(\u03bb) d\u03b2 = \u2211 N k=1Ek(\u03bb) exp(\u2212\u03b2Ek(\u03bb)) Z(\u03bb) , (7)\nand the Helmholtz free energy is\nF(\u03bb) = \u2212 1 \u03b2 ln Z(\u03bb).

(4)] in the canonical ensemble as a function of the perturbation strength \u03bb for Bx = 32 Bz . (a) The zero-temperature ground and excited state energies form a two-sheeted Riemann surface with square-root branch points at \u03bb = \u00b1i Bz/Bx (black dot). (b)\u2013(d) At finite temperature, the internal energy features a sequence of poles corresponding to zeros of the partition function Z(\u03bb), with the spacing increasing at higher temperature. The distance of the closest pole to the origin determines the radius of convergence for a perturbation expansion of the internal energy.\nThe perturbation series for these thermodynamic potentials are given by Taylor expansions around \u03bb = 0,6 i.e.,\nU(\u03bb) = \u221e\n\u2211 j=0\nU( j)\u03bbj and F(\u03bb) = \u221e\n\u2211 j=0\nF( j)\u03bbj, (9)\nwhere the individual corrections are, e.g.,\nU( j) = 1 j! \u2202 jU(\u03bb) \u2202\u03bbj\n\u2223 \u03bb=0 . (10)\nThe radius of convergence is then controlled by the distance of the closest singularity to the origin in the complex-\u03bb plane.\nSingularities in U(\u03bb) at non-zero temperature can be identified by inspecting the general form of Eq. (7). One possibility is that U(\u03bb) has a singularity at values of \u03bb corresponding to exceptional points in the zero-temperature energy. We find that this is not the case because a thermodynamic summation, including every discrete eigenstate, removes singularities caused by exceptional points. This property is shown for the partition function in the Appendix and can be extended to the numerator of the internal energy.\nOn the other hand, Z(\u03bb) can become zero in the complex-\u03bb plane, creating poles in the internal energy that dictate the radius of convergence for the perturbation expansion. At large temperatures, we find Z(\u03bb)\u2192 1 for all \u03bb. However, if we consider low temperatures near a degeneracy between E1(\u03bb) and E2(\u03bb), the partition function approximates to\nZ(\u03bb) \u2248 e\u2212\u03b2E1(\u03bb)[1 + e\u2212\u03b2(E2(\u03bb)\u2212E1(\u03bb))]. (11)\nZeros of Z(\u03bb) then occur when e\u2212\u03b2(E2(\u03bb)\u2212E1(\u03bb)) = \u22121, giving an infinite set of possible solutions that satisfy\nE2(\u03bb) \u2212 E1(\u03bb) = kBT(2n + 1)\u03c0 \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6\n\u03c9n\ni \u2200 n \u2208 Z. (12)\nIn other words, zeros of the partition function for low-T occur when the real components of E1(\u03bb) and E2(\u03bb) are degenerate and the difference in the imaginary components is equal to the\nMatsubara frequencies \u03c9n.33 For T \u2192 0, the Matsubara frequencies form a continuum along the imaginary axis and zeros of the partition function occur whenever the real components are degenerate, regardless of the imaginary components. In this limit, the zeros of the partition function form a continuum along the locus of points where the real component of the lowest excitation energy is zero. These points include non-Hermitian branch cuts on the ground-state energy surface as well as Hermitian conical intersection seams. The same zeros of Z(\u03bb) create logarithmic singularities in the Helmholtz free energy, meaning that F(\u03bb) and U(\u03bb) have an identical radius of convergence.\nIn the two-level system, the internal energy is given in terms of the perturbation strength \u03bb as\nU(\u03bb) = \u2212 \u221a B2z + \u03bb2B2x sinh(\u03b2 \u221a\nB2z + \u03bb2B2x) cosh(\u03b2 \u221a B2z + \u03bb2B2x) , (13)\nwhere the denominator represents the partition function Z(\u03bb) = cosh(\u03b2 \u221a B2z + \u03bb2B2x). Plotting the internal energy at various temperatures in Figs. 1(b)\u20131(d), we find that the square-root branch cut in the zero-temperature energy is lost for T \u2260 0. Instead, there are a sequence of poles with a separation that increases for higher temperatures. Solving Z(\u03bb) = 0, the positions of these poles is\n\u03bbpole = \u00b1i Bz Bx\n\u221a 1 + \u03c0 2k2BT2\n4Bz2 (4n + 1)2 \u2200 n \u2208 Z. (14)\nTherefore, the poles extend along the imaginary axis and their spacing decreases with temperature. When T \u2192 0, the poles tend toward a continuum extending outward from the zero-temperature exceptional points, corresponding to the line where the real components of the ground- and excited-state energies are degenerate. Ultimately, this continuum of poles recovers the branch cut on the lowest-energy sheet of the zero-temperature Riemann surface [Fig. 1(a)].\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 171101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0091442 156, 171101-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:17:17\nThe closest pole to the origin corresponds to n = 0, giving the radius of convergence\nrc = RRRRRRRRRRRR Bz Bx \u221a 1 + \u03c0 2k2BT2 4Bz2 RRRRRRRRRRRR . (15)\nIn the T \u2192 0 limit, this radius of convergence tends toward the expected value for the ground-state energy perturbation series and scales quadratically with respect to T (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, for T \u2192\u221e, we recover the asymptotic behavior rc \u223c \u03c0kBT2Bx . Therefore, the perturbation series will always converge at a sufficiently large T as long as Bx is finite.\nRemarkably, we find that the finite-temperature perturbation series in the two-level system can converge at non-zero temperatures even when the zero-temperature expansion diverges. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 3 for the internal energy and Helmholtz free energy with Bx = 32 Bz . The temperature at which the thermodynamic perturbation expansion becomes convergent at \u03bb = 1 can\nbe identified by solving rc > 1, giving kBT > 2\u03c0 \u221a\nBx2 \u2212 Bz2 in the two-level system. For Bx = 32 Bz , the perturbation expansion becomes convergent at kBT = 0.711 763Bz , as indicated by the vertical gray lines in Fig. 3. Numerical results indicating the accuracy of the low-order corrections either side of this temperature are given in Table I. (Note that only terms of even order contribute to the expansion.) The numerical data in Fig. 3 and Table I demonstrate that the Helmholtz free energy and internal energy start to diverge at the same temperature, confirming that the zeros of the partition function (common to both thermodynamic potentials) are the origin of these divergences.\nOn the other hand, it is also possible for a finite-temperature expansion to become divergent in the T \u2192 0 limit while the corresponding zero-temperature expansion is convergent. In this scenario, there is a mismatch between the T \u2192 0 limit of U(n) and the corresponding zero-temperature ground-state correction E(n)1 , known as the Kohn and Luttinger problem.11 This issue originally\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 171101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0091442 156, 171101-4\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:17:17\nsuggested that the formulation of finite-temperature electronic perturbation theory may be incorrect, inspiring a comprehensive reformulation that expands all thermodynamic potentials on an equal footing.7,34\u201336 However, Hirata subsequently demonstrated that the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem still persists by showing that U(1) and U(2) tend toward the wrong limit when the degeneracy is lifted at first order,10\nlim T\u21920\nU(1) = E[E(1)k ] \u2260 E (1) 1 , (16a)\nlim T\u21920\nU(2) = \u2212\u221e \u2260 E(2)1 , (16b)\nwhere E[E(1)k ] is the average of the first-order corrections for the degenerate reference states k. These limits give a zero radius of convergence at zero temperature and Hirata concluded that the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem \u201coriginates from the non-analyticity of the Boltzmann factor at T = 0.\u201d10\nApplying our analysis in the case of a degenerate reference state, we find that the zeros of the partition function must converge onto \u03bb = 0 for T \u2192 0. Therefore, the zero-temperature continuum of poles in U(\u03bb) intersects \u03bb = 0 and the radius of convergence becomes zero, in agreement with Ref. 10. In contrast to zero-temperature perturbation theory, this feature arises from the properties of the partition function and only requires a degeneracy in the zeroth-order ground state; it does not assume anything about the convergence properties of the zero-temperature eigenstates. The presence of a non-analytic pole in U(\u03bb) at \u03bb = 0 then leads to an inherently divergent perturbation expansion. Consequently, we can refine Hirata\u2019s concluding statement to say that the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem originates from a singularity in a thermodynamic potential at \u03bb = 0 created by a zero of the partition function for T \u2192 0.\nHowever, this analysis does little to explain the origin of differences between the results of zero-temperature and finitetemperature perturbation theory in the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem. To elucidate this further, we fix Bz = 0 in the two-level system to give degenerate reference states where the zero-temperature energies converge exactly at first-order,\nE\u00b1(\u03bb) = \u00b1Bx\u03bb. (17)\nThe corresponding internal energy is\nU(\u03bb) = \u2212Bx\u03bb tanh( Bx\u03bb kBT ) (18)\nwith poles at\n\u03bbpole = \u00b1i \u03c0kBT 2Bx (4n + 1) \u2200 n \u2208 Z. (19)\nThe radius of convergence is then directly proportional to T and finite-temperature perturbation theory will diverge for T \u2192 0, even though the zero-temperature energies are convergent.\nFor this example, the derivatives required for the first- and second-order corrections to the internal energy are\n\u2202U \u2202\u03bb = \u2212Bx 2\u03bb kBT sech2( Bx\u03bb kBT ) \u2212 Bx tanh( Bx\u03bb kBT ), (20a)\n1 2 \u22022U \u2202\u03bb2 = \u2212 Bx 2 kBT sech2( Bx\u03bb kBT ) [1 \u2212 Bx\u03bb kBT tanh( Bx\u03bb kBT )]. (20b)\nBoth functions are mathematically undefined at \u03bb = T = 0, and the value obtained by perturbation theory will depend on the order in which this limit is approached. For the first-order correction, two possible limits are\nlim T\u21920+ ( lim \u03bb\u21920+ \u2202U \u2202\u03bb ) = 0 and lim \u03bb\u21920+ ( lim T\u21920+ \u2202U \u2202\u03bb ) = \u2212Bx, (21)\nas illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The first case corresponds to the zero-temperature limit of finite-temperature perturbation theory (red curve), recovering the average of the zero-temperature firstorder corrections as described in Ref. 10. In contrast, the second case represents a perturbation expansion of the zero-temperature internal energy (blue curve) and recovers the expected behavior limT\u21920U(1) = E(1)1 . Similarly, the two limits for the second-order correction yield\nlim T\u21920+ ( lim \u03bb\u21920+ 1 2 \u22022U \u2202\u03bb2 ) = \u2212\u221e and lim \u03bb\u21920+ ( lim T\u21920+ 1 2 \u22022U \u2202\u03bb2 ) = 0, (22)\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 171101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0091442 156, 171101-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nas illustrated in Fig. 4(b). Again, the first case recovers the divergent finite-temperature behavior described in Ref. 10, while the second case tends to the second-order correction of the exact ground state.\nThese results suggest that the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem is fundamentally an order-of-limits issue that arises because the internal energy with degenerate reference states is non-analytic for \u03bb = 0 and T = 0 and the derivatives required for perturbation theory are mathematically undefined. Because this situation arises from zeros of the partition function, the divergence depends on the degeneracy of the reference states regardless of their coupling through the perturbation. Therefore, this problem cannot be removed by simply using degenerate perturbation theory.37 Instead, it appears that the only resolution is to remove the degeneracy using an alternative reference or partitioning, as recently proposed in Ref. 38.\nFinally, having identified a relationship between branch cuts of the zero-temperature eigenstates and zeros of the partition function in the T \u2192 0 limit, a natural question is whether this concept can be extended to unify Lee\u2013Yang theory with the convergence of exceptional points onto the real axis at quantum phase transitions. Previous work by Cejnar and co-workers has investigated this connection by associating non-Hermitian degeneracies with point charges and connecting the position of these degeneracies in the complex plane with zeros of a Coulombic partition function.39,40 However, we are not aware of any direct connection between Lee\u2013Yang zeros and zero-temperature exceptional points at quantum phase transitions.\nThe two-level spin-1/2 model provides a model of a quantum phase transition in the limit Bz \u2192 0. For a fixed value of Bx > 0, this quantum phase transition occurs at \u03bb = 0, with the spin flipping its alignment from the negative-x direction (\u03bb < 0) to the positive-x direction (\u03bb > 0). This transition is demonstrated by a derivative discontinuity in the zero-temperature energy and a discontinuous jump in \u27e8Sx\u27e9 at \u03bb = 0, as shown in Fig. 5 (left and middle panels, respectively). For Bz \u2260 0, a complex-conjugate pair\nof exceptional points exists in the complex-\u03bb plane (Fig. 5: right panel), creating an avoided level crossing on the real axis. As expected, these zero-temperature exceptional points converge onto the real axis in the Bz \u2192 0 limit corresponding to the quantum phase transition.\nThis physical phase transition is mathematically equivalent to the analysis of finite-temperature perturbation theory in the complex-\u03bb plane. Therefore, we can use it to directly connect Lee\u2013Yang zeros at quantum phase transitions with zero-temperature exceptional points. Because the quantum phase transition only occurs when T = 0 for Bz = 0, we expect the zeros of the partition function to converge onto the real axis in the T \u2192 0 and Bz \u2192 0 limit. We have already shown that zeros of the partition function for T \u2260 0 and Bz \u2260 0 occur along the imaginary axis extending out from the zero-temperature exceptional point. For T \u2192 0, these zeros form a continuum along the branch cut that terminates at the exceptional point. Therefore, in the Bz \u2192 0 limit, the convergence of the exceptional points onto the real axis also causes the zeros of the partition function to move closer to the real axis. The position of these zeros still has a complex component for T \u2260 0 and the internal energy is smooth along the real axis. However, when the zeros of the partition function converge onto the exceptional points for T \u2192 0, they must also converge onto the real axis as Bz \u2192 0, creating the expected behavior for a quantum phase transition.\nAs a result, the convergence of Lee\u2013Yang zeros and exceptional points onto the real axis arises from the same mathematics, providing a unified perspective on quantum phase transitions in the complex plane. The exceptional point in the zerotemperature energy is simply the zero-temperature continuum limit of the poles in the internal energy caused by zeros of the partition function. This result is a formal mathematical connection, in contrast to the previous Coulombic analogy between non-Hermitian degeneracies and zeros of the partition function.39,40\nJ. Chem. Phys. 156, 171101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0091442 156, 171101-6\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 00:17:17\nIn this work, we have shown that divergent finite-temperature perturbation theory is driven by singularities created by Lee\u2013Yang zeros of the partition function that move further into the complex plane as the temperature increases. Therefore, perturbation theory is more likely to be convergent at higher temperatures. This result suggests that extrapolating analytic continuations of the perturbation corrections at higher temperatures to T = 0, in a similar approach to Refs. 41\u201343, may provide improved accuracy when the zero-temperature expansion is divergent. Alternatively, because the divergent perturbation expansions at T \u2260 0 arise from poles, the internal energy will be particularly well-suited to resummation techniques based on Pad\u00e9 approximants.12,13,44 For a degenerate reference, we find that the poles in the internal energy converge onto \u03bb = 0 in the T \u2192 0 limit, creating a mathematically undefined perturbation expansion that is the origin of the Kohn\u2013Luttinger problem.\nFinally, by extending our analysis to quantum phase transitions in the spin-1/2 model, we have demonstrated a direct mathematical connection between finite-temperature Lee\u2013Yang zeros and zero-temperature exceptional points. This unifying connection provides a more complete picture of quantum phase transitions through the lens of complex analysis. Recently, Lee\u2013Yang zeros and exceptional points have been independently realized in experiments.31,32,45,46 The possibility of experimentally probing the conversion of Lee\u2013Yang zeros into an exceptional point at low temperatures is an exciting prospect for the discovery and verification of exotic non-Hermitian chemical physics."

            "text": "Consider the partition function Z(\u03bb) of an N-level system in the vicinity of an kth order algebraic branch point \u03bbbp (where k > 1). In this region, the states that are not involved in the branch point provide a smooth, analytic contribution Z(\u03bb) and the partition function to be decomposed as\nZ(\u03bb) = Z(\u03bb) + k\n\u2211 j=1 exp(\u2212\u03b2Ej(\u03bb)), (A1)\nwhere the states indexed by j coincide at the branch point. To establish whether Z(\u03bb) is analytic at \u03bbbp, we consider the first derivative\ndZ(\u03bb) d\u03bb = dZ(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2212 \u03b2 k \u2211 j=1 dEj(\u03bb) d\u03bb exp(\u2212\u03b2Ej(\u03bb)). (A2)\nNear the kth-order branch point, the corresponding energy levels behave as\nEj(\u03bb) \u2248 Ebp + a(\u03bb) 1 k exp(2\u03c0ij\nk ) (A3)\nfor some smooth real function a(\u03bb) with a(\u03bbbp) = 0. For example, in the two-level system considered in this letter, the energy levels near the branch point E\u00b1(\u03bb) = \u00b1(B2z + \u03bb2B2x)1/2 correspond to a(\u03bb) = B2z + \u03bb2B2x and k = 2. The non-analyticity of the zero-temperature energy levels for \u03bb\u2192 \u03bbbp then arises from the derivatives\ndEj(\u03bb) d\u03bb = 1 k da(\u03bb) d\u03bb a(\u03bb)( 1 k\u22121) exp(2\u03c0ij k ), (A4)\nwhere clearly the a(\u03bb)( 1k\u22121) term diverges in the limit lim\u03bb\u2192\u03bbbp a(\u03bb) = 0 for k > 1. Inserting Eq. (A3) into Eq. (A2) and considering the \u03bb\u2192 \u03bbbp limit then yields\ndZ(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2248 dZ(\u03bb) d\u03bb \u2212 \u03b2 1 k da(\u03bb) d\u03bb a(\u03bb)( 1 k\u22121) exp(\u2212\u03b2 Ebp)\nk\n\u2211 j=1 exp(2\u03c0ij nk ) \u00b4\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b8\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b9\u00b6 0 .\n(A5) Because \u2211kj=1 exp( 2\u03c0ijnk ) = 0, we find that dZ(\u03bb) d\u03bb remains finite at the branch point even though the zero-temperature energy levels are non-analytic. This derivation can be trivially extended to show that high-order derivatives of the partition function are also finite at a branch point. Consequently, the partition function is a complex analytic function of \u03bb, even in the presence of non-analytic algebraic branch points in the zero-temperature energy levels. A similar approach can be applied to the numerator of the internal energy."
