1. **Investigate the impact of various divalent cations on the kinetics of myosin and troponin in real-world conditions.** This could involve studying the effects of these cations on muscle contraction and relaxation in both healthy and diseased states.


2. **Examine the potential of cardiac troponin C and atrial and ventricular myosin regulatory light chains as targets for toxic cations.** This could involve investigating the binding of these cations to these proteins and the subsequent effects on their function.


3. **Explore the role of amino acid substitutions and post-translational modifications in altering the affinity of EF-hand proteins and other targets for divalent cations.** This could help to identify potential mechanisms by which toxic cations could disrupt the normal function of these proteins.


4. **Investigate the potential for using divalent cations as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve studying the effects of these cations on the contractile function of the heart and the potential for them to protect against heart damage.


5. **Develop new methods for detecting and quantifying divalent cations in the heart.** This could help to improve our understanding of the role of these cations in cardiovascular health and disease.
