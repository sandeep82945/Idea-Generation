Antimicrobial resistance has worsened in Latin America. There is an urgent need to understand the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) and the barriers to implementing effective ASPs in light of limited national action plans or policies to promote ASPs in the region.\nMethods. We performed a descriptive mixed-methods study of ASPs in 5 Latin American countries in March-July 2022. An electronic questionnaire with an associated scoring system (hospital ASP self-assessment) was used, and ASP development was classified based on the scores (inadequate, 0\u201325; basic, 26\u201350; intermediate, 51\u201375; or advanced, 76\u2013100). Interviews among healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in antimicrobial stewardship (AS) inquired about behavioral and organizational factors that influence AS activities. Interview data were coded into themes. Results from the ASP self-assessment and interviews were integrated to create an explanatory framework.\nResults. Twenty hospitals completed the self-assessment, and 46 AS stakeholders from these hospitals were interviewed. ASP development was inadequate/basic in 35% of hospitals, intermediate in 50%, and advanced in 15%. For-profit hospitals had higher scores than not-for-profit hospitals. Interview data validated the self-assessment findings and provided further insight into ASP implementation challenges, which included limited formal hospital leadership support, inadequate staffing and tools to perform AS work more efficiently, limited awareness of AS principles by HCWs, and limited training opportunities.\nConclusions. We identified several barriers to ASP development in Latin America, suggesting the need to create accurate business cases for ASPs to obtain the necessary funding for their effective implementation and sustainability.\nKeywords. antibiotic stewardship; Latin America.\nCorrespondence: V.

Several cross-sectional\nsurveys that evaluated the development of ASPs in Latin American hospitals found that several core elements of ASPs, such as dedicated personnel and pharmacy expertise, are lacking [1]. Furthermore, most countries in Latin America reported not having implemented a national action plan to combat AMR according to a recent survey [2], and few have conducted national assessments of antibiotic use [3, 4]. There is an urgent need to understand the current challenges to implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AS) activities in the region, including behavioral and organizational factors that have not been well addressed through prior evaluations. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of 20 hospital ASPs in 5 Latin American countries.\nFabre et al \u2022 CID 2023:77 (Suppl 1) \u2022 S53\nClinical Infectious Diseases\nS U P P L E M E N T A R T I C L E\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cid/article/77/Supplem ent_1/S53/7219527 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024"

            "text": "Study Design This descriptive mixed-methods study involved a cross-sectional evaluation of hospital ASPs using a previously validated electronic ASP self-assessment tool [5] (Supplementary Material, ASP Self-Assessment) completed by AS teams that rated the type and quality of AS activities in their hospitals followed by semistructured interviews with those leading ASPs. While the ASP self-assessment collected systematic data across different themes, the interviews provided an opportunity for AS stakeholders to express their first-hand experiences regarding barriers to implementing ASPs. We integrated the results from the interviews and self-assessment to provide an explanatory framework.\nThe Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Institutional Review Board (IRB) as well as local IRBs at participating hospitals approved the study.\nStudy Participants Twenty hospitals from Panama, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina were recruited for participation through a regional network (PROAnet) in March 2022. Healthcare workers (HCWs) directly involved in AS activities (infectious disease [ID] physicians, microbiologists, and pharmacists) at these institutions were invited to participate in semistructured interviews.\nData Collection The ASP self-assessment was electronically delivered to each site (1 per hospital). The survey included 94 questions organized in 5 domains (1, leadership support and accountability; 2, clinical guidelines; 3, strategies to optimize antimicrobial use; 4, monitoring and reporting; 5, education and training and patient safety), with each question including a graded response (meets criteria, partially meets criteria, does not meet criteria, and, in some, not applicable). Each domain could earn up to 100 points, and the total score represented the mean of the sum of all domains. Based on the total score, ASP development was categorized as inadequate (0\u2013 25), basic (26\u201350), intermediate (51\u201375), and advanced (76\u2013100).\nSemistructured interviews were conducted in Spanish by a native Spanish-speaking medical anthropologist (C. S.) online using a videoconference program in March 2022\u2013July 2022. The research team developed the initial interview guide according to the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework [6], which investigates behavioral and systematic components of healthcare practices and has been previously used to identify barriers and facilitators to infection prevention and AS programs [7, 8] (Supplementary Material, Interview Guide). Interviews lasted between 45 and 60 minutes.\nStatistical Analyses Results from the self-assessment were analyzed using descriptive statistics. We evaluated results overall and by hospital\ntype (for-profit and not-for-profit). Interview recordings were transcribed and analyzed in the original language. Two raters independently coded selected transcripts to develop a preliminary coding dictionary that was refined as more transcripts were analyzed. Directed content analysis of the interview transcripts was performed focusing on barriers and facilitators of ASP implementation guided by the SEIPS model [6]. Quotations included in the manuscript were translated into English by 2 bilingual authors."

Additionally, cultural determinants remain an obstacle to the multidisciplinary work needed to improve antibiotic use in hospitals. Support from public health authorities continues to be limited.\nDedicated personnel are a basic pillar of any ASP. In our study, few hospitals met the minimum staffing recommendations for ASPs [9], with many participants reporting a lack of expertise in AS and quality improvement implementation. Participants reported excessive workload and multiple responsibilities often without the appropriate financial compensation. Similar to our findings, a recent global study that evaluated the implementation of IPC programs that included Latin American countries showed workload and staffing to be a major barrier to IPC program implementation [11]. Participants perceived financial constraints as a barrier to better resource allocation. Previous studies have shown that ASPs can be cost-effective in Latin American countries [12]; however, a better understanding of reimbursement models is needed to appropriately prioritize interventions to get ASPs started and to incentivize the development of ASPs in resource-limited settings [13]. Participants reported the need for cultural and organizational changes regarding how hospitals approach antibiotic use, with many citing power distance among HCWs (eg, physician\u2013pharmacist, physician\u2013nurse, surgeon\u2013nonsurgeon), lack of cohesive work across disciplines (eg, redundant guidelines), and poor understanding of the consequences of inappropriate antibiotic use at the patient level. A recent national program aimed at strengthening AS across healthcare settings in the United States incorporated training in both technical (best practices for management of common syndromes) and behavioral (teamwork, effective communication) aspects of AS using patient safety as the framework to change antibiotic prescribing for patients across healthcare settings, which resulted in a significant reduction in antibiotic use and antibiotic-related adverse events [14, 15]. Collaboration with regional partners to build ASPs has been beneficial for resource-limited hospitals and might help mitigate the lack of trained dedicated personnel in some hospitals [16, 17]. Participants had very favorable views of public health activities related to AMR such as access to AMR testing and regional/national surveillance activities. However, they indicated the need for more robust support for training and guidance in ASP implementation but also in developing regulations to help prioritize ASP implementation and set minimum requirements for functioning programs.\nOur study has some limitations. We used a convenience sample of hospitals and, as such, it does not represent an\nadequate sample of hospitals/population per country or for the region (Brazil, which is the most populous country in Latin America, was not included). We recruited hospitals through a regional network that was developed to help build ASPs, hence, these hospitals might be more engaged in ASPs and our results may underestimate barriers to ASP implementation. However, we identified similar gaps to prior studies that used different sampling methodologies [18, 19]. Our study did not specifically address how the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic impacted ASP implementation in the region; however, participants mentioned both positive and negative consequences (eg, it increased specialty value and worsened clinical burden, respectively).\nIn summary, we identified common and unique barriers to the implementation of ASPs in for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. We identified barriers with relatively easy solutions (eg, those related to education and training, increasing engagement from hospital administrators, and making a business case for ASP) and others that require longer-term efforts (eg, investments in IT resources, increasing access to clinical pharmacists, improved HCW compensation, less hierarchical relationships).\nSupplementary Data Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.
