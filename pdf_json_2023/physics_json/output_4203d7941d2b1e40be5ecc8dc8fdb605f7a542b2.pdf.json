    "abstractText": "In this work, two-dimensional (2D) Zn-HMT (Zn(NO3)2(HMT)2(H2O)2]n) nanosheets were synthesized using a facile one-step chemical precipitation in the presence of Zn(NO3)2, hexamine (HMT), and anhydrous ethanol at room temperature. Subsequently, hexagonal Tx-ZnO (Tx-ZnO refers to the zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles) were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-phase method at different temperatures (x = 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, and 800 \u25e6C) nanoparticles with different morphologies were synthesized by a high-temperature calcination approach using 2D Zn-HMT nanosheets as precursor. The crystal structure, morphology, specific surface areas, surface and interface properties, optical properties, and charge migration behaviors of the as-synthesized Tx-ZnO nanoparticles were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), automatic specific surface and aperture analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible spectrophotometer, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The photocatalytic performances and stabilities of the as-synthesized typical Tx-ZnO nanoparticles with various morphologies were evaluated and compared with the commercial ZnO (CM-ZnO) nanoparticle. The T700-ZnO nanoparticle with spherical and irregular morphology exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity (99.12%) for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB), compared to T500-ZnO (92.32%), T600-ZnO (90.65%), T800-ZnO (44.04%), and the CM-ZnO (88.38%) nanoparticle, which can be attributed to the cooperative effects of higher crystallinity, bigger crystal size, the strongest separation efficiency, the lowest recombination rate, the fastest charge carrier transfer path, and the highest charge-transfer efficiency. The superior photocatalytic activity illustrated by the T700-ZnO nanoparticle makes it have potential application prospects for the treatment of",

Various semiconductors have been prepared, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc sulfide (ZnS), gallium nitride (GaN), copper oxide (CuO), ferric oxide (Fe2O3), and zinc oxide (ZnO). Among the semiconductors mentioned above, ZnO is an excellent n-type wide bandgap (3.37 eV) semiconductor that is very suitable to be used as a photocatalyst because of its superior photocatalytic activity, high thermal stability, strong adsorption efficiency, and non-toxicity [4\u20138]. Generally, ZnO exists in three polymorphs namely: rock\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5135. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28135135 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5135 2 of 19\nsalt, wurtzite (hexagonal, space group P63mc), and zinc blende (cubic, space group Pa-3). Among the three different crystalline phases of ZnO, hexagonal wurtzite ZnO possesses the highest photocatalytic activity and is widely accepted in catalytic applications. Compared to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, rock salt ZnO is very rare because it only exists under conditions of high pressure [9]. There are two primary methods for preparing ZnO nanoparticles: gas-phase synthesis and liquid-phase synthesis. Gas-phase synthesis mainly includes gas\u2013liquid\u2013solid growth, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, etc. For example, Song et al. successfully fabricated vertically aligned ZnO nanorods on wide band gap substrates (GaN, Al0.5Ga0.5N, and AlN) through a vapor\u2013 liquid\u2013solid growth method [10]. Chu et al. successfully synthesized well-aligned ZnO nanowires with excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of methylene blue on Si(100) substrates through carbothermal reduction and vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid methods [11]. Protasova et al. synthesized vertically aligned ZnO nanowires on Si substrates by the chemical vapor deposition method. In liquid-phase synthesis, the growth process is carried out in water or organic solutions at relatively low temperatures [12]. Compared to the gas-phase synthesis technique, the liquid-phase synthesis method is more suitable for mass production due to its advantages of low production cost, scalability, and low temperature [12]. For example, Lu et al. successfully prepared ZnO microcrystals with ellipsoidal morphology through a hydrothermal process using zinc nitrate and ammonia as the Zn2+ ion and base sources, respectively [13]. Chen et al. successfully synthesized ZnO nanocrystals with various morphologies such as bullet-like, rod-like, sheet-like, polyhedron-like, and crushed stone-like through a hydrothermal process using different organic compounds as template agents [14]. Ta et al. successfully synthesized metal (M)-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 composites with a sponge-like porous structure by a facile one-pot pyrolysis method using Zn(NO3)2, Mg(NO3)2, and CH4N2O as the precursors [15]. Ta et al. also successfully synthesized three-level AgNWs/ZnO NRs/AgNPs hierarchical nanostructures via a three-step solution method [16]. Recently, using a deep eutectic solvent as a template, Liu et al. synthesized flower-like ZnO nanoparticles with higher photocatalytic performance for the degradation of methyl orange through a simple hydrothermal method [17]. Benu et al. synthesized fibrous ZnO microrods with higher photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of RhB through a macroemulsion-mediated solvothermal method using zinc nitrate and zinc acetate as precursors [18]. The detailed synthesis conditions, experimental variables, and morphologies of the various aforementioned strategies are presented in Table 1. In this work, hexagonal Tx-ZnO nanoparticles with different morphologies were first synthesized by a facile one-step precipitation method combined with a high-temperature calcination method using zinc nitrate and hexamine as the sources and absolute ethyl alcohol as the solvent. Under heating treatment (500\u2013800 \u25e6C), the Zn-HMT precipitate can be decomposed into hexagonal Tx-ZnO nanoparticles. The crystal phases, morphologies, surface and interface properties, optical properties, and photocatalytic performances of the as-synthesized Tx-ZnO nanoparticles were explored to elucidate the correlation between their structure and properties. The photocatalytic activity of Tx-ZnO nanoparticles with various morphologies was studied by the degradation of RhB. Among the four typical photocatalysts calcined at different temperatures, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased in the order of T800-ZnO (44.04%) < T600-ZnO (90.65%) < T500-ZnO (92.32%) < T700-ZnO (99.12%). Among them, the T700-ZnO sample is the most effective photocatalyst due to the cooperative effects of higher crystallinity, bigger crystal size, the strongest separation efficiency, the lowest recombination rate, the fastest charge carrier transfer path, and the highest charge-transfer efficiency. The superior photocatalytic activity of T700-ZnO makes it a promising candidate for future photocatalytic applications.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5135 3 of 19"

The XRD patterns of ZnO samples obtained by calcining the white Zn-HMT precipitation in an air atmosphere of 500~800 \u25e6C for 2 h are shown in Figure 1b\u2013h. For all Tx-ZnO (x = 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800) samples, only the diffraction peaks of the ZnO phase were observed, indicating that the Zn-HMT precipitation was completely transformed to the ZnO phase at 500~800 \u25e6C. The peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 31.86\u25e6, 34.48\u25e6, 36.32\u25e6, 47.60\u25e6, 56.68\u25e6, 62.96\u25e6, 66.46\u25e6, 67.98\u25e6, 69.60\u25e6, 72.58\u25e6, and 77.06\u25e6 are undisputedly indexed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (004), and (202) crystal planes of hexagonal ZnO (JCPDF no. 36-1451, P63mc, a = b = 3.2498 \u00c5, c = 5.2066 \u00c5), respectively. The sharp peaks of diffraction observed in the XRD patterns indicate that the as-synthesized Tx-ZnO nanoparticles are highly crystalline.

Morphological Analysis The morphologies of the Zn-HMT precipitates and the as-synthesized Tx-ZnO\nnanoparticles are studied using the FESEM images (Figure 2). Figure 2a shows a typical FESEM image of the obtained Zn-HMT precipitates with a molar ratio of 1:1. The Zn-HMT precursor presents a two-dimensional, irregular, plate-like structure. After a simple pyrolysis process at 500~800 \u00b0C in air, the two-dimensional Zn-HMT plate-like structure is successfully converted to Tx-ZnO nanoparticles. Figure 2b displays a typical FESEM image of a T500-ZnO sample prepared by calcining the Zn-HMT precursor at 500 \u00b0C. As the FESEM images illustrate, most of the T500-ZnO nanoparticles are almost irregularly spherical in morphology, with an average size of 58.6 nm (diameter ranging from 24.5 to 98.3 nm). In addition, some irregular large nanoparticles with a length of 118.5~189.5 nm and some rod-like nanoparticles with a length of 49.6~130 nm and a width of 26.9~56.6 nm were also observed. As can be seen from Figure 2c, when the calcination temperature is 600 \u00b0C, many large irregularly shaped nanoparticles with an average size of 164.6 nm (length of about 102~304 nm) and some small rod-shaped, spherical, and irregular morphologies with an average size of 47.5 nm (length of about 25.7~71.9 nm) are observed in the T600-ZnO sample. Figure 2d,e display the typical FESEM images of T700-ZnO and T800-ZnO samples, respectively. As the FESEM images illustrate, most of the T700-ZnO (T800-ZnO) nanoparticles are spherical in morphology with a size of 109.7~238.8 nm (106.1~244.4 nm) in diameter and irregular in morphology with an average size of 259.5 nm (312.2 nm), respectively. Figure 2f displays the FESEM images of the CM-ZnO sample. As can be seen, all of the nanoparticles are found to be approximately 12.7~33.8 nm with a mean size of 21.2 nm.\nFigure 1.

Figure 2a shows a typical FESEM image of the obtained Zn-HMT precipitates with a molar ratio of 1:1. The Zn-HMT precursor presents a two-dimensional, irregular, plate-like structure. After a simple pyrolysis process at 500~800 \u25e6C in air, the two-dimensional Zn-HMT plate-like structure is successfully converted to Tx-ZnO nanoparticles. Figure 2b displays a typical FESEM image of a T500-ZnO sample prepared by calcining the Zn-HMT precursor at 500 \u25e6C. As the FESEM images illust ate, most of the T500-ZnO nanopart cles are almost irregularly spherical in morphology, with an average size of 58.6 nm (diameter ranging from 24.5 to 98.3 nm). In addition, some irregular large nanoparticles with a length of 118.5~189.5 nm and some rod-like nanoparticles with a length of 49.6~130 nm and a width of 26.9~56.6 nm were also observed.

However, various peak intensities are achieved for Tx-ZnO particles prepared at different temperatures and CM-ZnO. The sharp peak located at about 397 nm in the UV region corresponds to the excitonic emission, which is a near-band-edge emission [26]. The peaks located at about 420 nm and 481 nm in the blue band region correspond to band edge free excitons and bound excitons, respectively [26]. The peak located at about 437 nm in the blue band region can be attributed to the presence of an oxygen vacancy in the ZnO lattice, which is caused by the recombination of radiating electron holes in the oxygen vacancy sites [20]. The peak located at near 545 nm in the green region is associated with surface recombination and singly ionized oxygen vacancies [27]. In PL spectroscopy, the intensity of the peak is related to the recombination and separation of electrons and holes. Generally speaking, a high-intensity peak indicates fast recombination of electrons and holes, while a low-intensity peak indicates better separation of electrons and holes [20].

The self-photodegradation efficiency of the RhB is only 8.66% without a ZnO sample, while T700-ZnO shows the most efficient degradation efficiency (99.12%), followed by T500-ZnO (92.32%), T600-ZnO (90.65%), CM-ZnO (88.38%), and T800-ZnO (44.04%). The corresponding pseudo-first-order kinetic plots and apparent rate constants (k, min\u22121) were obtained by substituting the photocatalytic experiment data into \u2212ln(Ct/C0) = kt [32], as shown in Figure 10b,c, respectively.

In particular, T700-ZnO gave the highest apparent rate constant of 0.0385 min\u22121, magnified by 1.82, 1.93, 8.19, 2.18, and 48.13 folds as compared to T500-ZnO, T600-ZnO, T700-ZnO, T800-ZnO, CM-ZnO, and the blank sample, respectively. To explore the intrinsic photoactivity, the apparent reaction rate constants (k) were also normalized to the specific surface areas (ks) [33]. The specific surface areas were calculated to be 39.98, 23.92, 17.17, 12.21, and 54.78 m2/g for T500-ZnO, T600-ZnO, T700-ZnO, T800-ZnO and CM-ZnO, respectively.

Figure 11a shows the color variation of RhB solution with illumination time in the presence of a T700-ZnO sample under UV irradiation. It can be seen that with the extension of illumination time, the pink color of the RhB solution gradually becomes lighter until it becomes colorless after 120 min.

The Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface areas were obtained by using a micromeritics ASAP 2020 automatic specific surface and aperture analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Atlanta, GA, USA) at 77 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250XI XPS spectrometer (New York, NY, USA) using monochromatized Al K\u03b1 radiation (1486.6 eV) with a 30 eV pass energy at a 0.05 eV step over a 700 \u00b5m \u00d7 300 \u00b5m sample area. The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of the samples were measured between 200 and 800 nm with a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an integrated sphere attachment. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a HORIBA Fluoromax-4 fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Instruments Inc., Kyoto, Japan) with an excitation of 325 nm laser light. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI600E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). An indium\u2013tin oxide glass was used as a working electrode; a platinum plate (opening area: 1 cm2) and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) were used as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively."

Conclusions ZnO nanoparticles with various morphologies were successfully synthesized via a high-temperature calcination method using 2D Zn-HMT nanosheets as the precursor. XRD, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra, PL emission spectra, and EIS measurements were employed to investigate the structure, morphology, microstructure, optical properties, and charge migration behaviors. With the change in calcinations, the band gap of the Tx-ZnO was enlarged from 3.10 to 3.22 eV. The T700-ZnO nanoparticle with spherical and irregular morphology exhibited the most superior photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB, compared to T500-ZnO, T600-ZnO, T800-ZnO, and the benchmark CM-ZnO nanoparticle. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of T700-ZnO nanoparticles can be attributed to the cooperative effects of higher crystallinity, bigger crystal size, the strongest separation efficiency, the lowest recombination rate, the fastest charge carrier transfer path, and the highest charge-transfer efficiency. Our results open a new window for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, which have a high potential for removing organic contaminants from wastewater under irradiation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.D., X.Q. and Y.L.
