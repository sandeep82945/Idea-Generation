    "abstractText": "A large number of studies have studied the influence of emotional experience on an indi\u2010 vidual\u2019s estimation performance, but the influence of implicit emotion regulation is still unknown. Participants were asked to complete the following tasks in order: idiom matching task, multipli\u2010 cation computational estimation task (MCE task), gender judgment task (GJ task), and emotional experience intensity assessment task. The words matching task was adopted to achieve the purpose of implicit emotion regulation (implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression). Behavioral results showed that implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression equally contributed to improving an in\u2010 dividual\u2019s estimation speed (but not ACC (accuracy)). The MCE task related ERP (event\u2010related potential) results showed that the influence of implicit emotion regulation on estimation consisted of two phases. In the first phase (encoding phase), implicit reappraisal both enhanced (larger P1 amplitudes) and weakened (smaller N170 amplitudes) an individual\u2019s encoding sensitivity, while implicit suppression enhanced an individual\u2019s encoding sensitivity (larger P1 amplitudes). In the second phase (estimation strategies retrieval phase), implicit reappraisal (but not implicit suppres\u2010 sion) costmore attention resources (larger LPC2 and LPC3 amplitudes). The present study suggested that both implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression contributed to improving an individual\u2019s es\u2010 timation performance, and the regulation effect of implicit suppression (vs. implicit reappraisal)",

            "text": "Previous studies showed that an individual\u2019s estimation performances might be af\u2011 fected by emotion experience [1\u20133], age [4,5], cognitive load [6,7], cognitive style [8], and cultural differences [9,10], and so on. For example, a study [11] showed that when par\u2011 ticipants were asked to complete an estimation task with a specified strategy, their per\u2011 formances were influenced by their math anxiety level. To be more specific, compared with the high math anxiety group, the low math anxiety group showed higher ACC and shorter RT (response time); in other words, participants with lowmath anxiety performed better. Additionally, a recent study explored the influence of emotional experience under laboratory conditions on individuals\u2019 performance of completing an estimation task [2]. Combined with the emotion priming paradigm, Liu et al. [2] asked participants to complete the MCE task and the emotion labeling task in each trial, under angry, fear,\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13010077 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77 2 of 19\nhappy, and neutral priming conditions (the prime stimuli were facial expression images). In the MCE task, the multiplication estimation question and two alternative answers were presented on the screen simultaneously; participants were asked to find out the correct answer by using the down\u2011up strategy (DU strategy, rounding the first operand down to the nearest decade, while rounding the second operand up to the nearest decade, e.g., doing 30 \u00d7 70 = 2100 for 32 \u00d7 67). In the emotion labeling task, participants were asked to judge which emotion was conveyed by the priming stimulus (facial expression image). The behavioral results showed that participants\u2019 ACC of completing the MCE task under different emotion priming conditions showed no significant difference, while the corre\u2011 sponding RT under fear (vs. neutral) priming condition was longer, which indicated that fear priming reduced participants\u2019 estimation speed. More importantly, this study indi\u2011 cated that not all negative emotional experiences (e.g., fear) were detrimental to partici\u2011 pants\u2019 estimation performance. However, the result of Liu et al. [2] was based on explicit priming condition, so what influence does implicit emotional priming have on individuals\u2019 estimation performance? To solve this issue, a newly published study [1] adopted the same experimental procedure and stimuli as Liu et al. [2], except they replaced the emotion labeling task with a gender judgment task, i.e., participants were asked to judge the gender of the facial expression image (priming stimulus). The results indicated that participants\u2019 ACC of completing the MCE task was not influenced by the emotion type of the implicit priming stimuli, which was consistent with previous study [2]. However, the corresponding RT under implicit happy and fear (vs. neutral) priming conditions was shorter, which indicated that implicit happy and fear priming improved participants\u2019 estimation speed. In a word, these stud\u2011 ies [1,2] showed that an individual\u2019s estimation performance was influenced not only by emotional experience, but also by emotional priming style (explicit vs. implicit). Can emo\u2011 tion regulation improve the adverse effects of negative emotional experience (for example fear) on individuals\u2019 estimation performance? If so, what are the similarities and differ\u2011 ences between the effects of explicit emotion regulation and implicit emotion regulation? A recent study has explored the influence of emotion regulation on an individual\u2019s es\u2011 timation performance [12]. In this study, participants were required to complete the MCE task by using the DU strategy, under neutral, happy, and fear priming conditions, dur\u2011 ing which they were told to regulate their emotional experience by using a specified emo\u2011 tion regulation strategy (view, reappraisal, or suppression). Referring to previous stud\u2011 ies [13,14], \u201creappraisal\u201d refers to regarding oneself as a detached observer, and realizing that the emotion experience conveyed by the upcoming facial expression image has noth\u2011 ing to dowith oneself; \u201csuppression\u201d refers to consciously suppressing one\u2019s expression of emotional experience, elicited by the upcoming facial expression image, and trying their best to keep their facial expressions unchanged, thus leading others to be unable to rec\u2011 ognize their emotional feeling through seeing their face. The behavioral results showed that participants\u2019 ACCs of completing the MCE task under different emotion regulation conditions showed no significant difference. However, reappraisal (but not suppression) contributed to improving an individual\u2019s estimation speed (shorter RT) under a happy priming condition, and both reappraisal and suppression contributed to improving an in\u2011 dividual\u2019s estimation speed under a neutral priming condition; however, an individual\u2019s estimation speed under a fear priming conditionwas not influenced by emotion regulation. Additionally, the ERP results showed that the P1 amplitudes, elicited by using reappraisal (vs. view), were larger under happy and fear priming conditions, while the P1 amplitudes elicited by using suppression (vs. view) were larger only under a happy condition. Mean\u2011 while, the corresponding N170 amplitudes were smaller when using reappraisal and sup\u2011 pression (vs. view) under a happy priming condition. Previous studies showed that the P1 component was an effective indicator of indexing attention to digit\u2011pattern and their potential numeric meaning, and the amplitudes of P1 would be enlarged by attention; it may be an early indicator of brain activity when participants complete an estimation task [1,15,16], and N170 may be an effective indicator of indexing the digital encoding\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77 3 of 19\nof the computing task [17,18]. Therefore, the P1 and N170 related results indicated that reappraisal and suppression contributed to encoding the estimation question. Addition\u2011 ally, the corresponding LPC amplitudes under the reappraisal (vs. suppression) condition were smaller, indexing less cognitive resource cost because previous studies showed that LPC seems to reflect the retrieval of procedural strategies, and is an important indicator of cognitive resource allocation, with easy (vs. difficult) computing problems which cost less cognitive resources [19,20]. Totally speaking, both reappraisal and suppression con\u2011 tributed to improving an individual\u2019s arithmetic performance, and the regulation effect of reappraisal (vs. suppression) was better. The dual\u2011process framework theory proposed that both explicit and implicit emo\u2011 tion regulation were important for us, though researchers paid more attention to explicit emotion regulation in previous studies [21]. Explicit emotion regulation (also called con\u2011 trolled/conscious emotion regulation) refers to effortful attempts to change the time course and intensity of emotional experience and emotional responses [21]. Implicit emotion regu\u2011 lation refers to unconsciously goal\u2011driven change to any aspect of an individual\u2019s emotion experience and experience responses, while paying no attention to the process of regulat\u2011 ing their emotions andwithout engaging in deliberate control. Therefore, implicit emotion regulation is also called automatic/unconscious emotion regulation [21,22]. Methods used to induce automatic emotion regulation include the sentence unscrambling task [23,24], word matching task [25\u201327], and implementation intention paradigm [28,29]. For exam\u2011 ple, adopting the wordmatching task, Yang et al. [25] investigated the influence of implicit emotion regulation on outcome evaluation. In this study [25], participants were required to complete the word matching task (two conditions: priming emotion regulation condi\u2011 tion, and control condition) before completing the monetary decision\u2011making task. In the wordmatching task, participants were required to select between two alternative words to match the meaning of the goal word. In the monetary decision\u2011making task, participants were asked to select between two alternatives, which means that they would have won or lost different amounts of money, and then they were required to evaluate their emotional experience intensity in relation to the outcome. The results showed that priming emotion regulation contributed to reducing an individual\u2019s emotional experience intensity when participants won money. Meanwhile, under the priming emotion regulation condition (vs. control condition), the feedback\u2011related negativity amplitudes were reduced, which indicated that the word matching task modulated motivational salience of outcomes. Col\u2011 lectively, these studies mentioned above indicated that implicit emotion regulation can improve an individual\u2019s emotional experience and cognitive performance. To our knowledge, only a few studies have studied the relationship between emo\u2011 tion regulation and an individual\u2019s arithmetic performance [30,31]; therefore, does implicit emotion regulation contribute to improving an individual\u2019s performance of completing estimation tasks? In order to explore the relationship between implicit emotion regula\u2011 tion and an individual\u2019s estimation performance and the potential neural mechanism, a 3 (implicit priming emotion type: fear, neutral, and happy) \u00d73 (implicit emotion regula\u2011 tion strategy type: view, reappraisal, and suppression)within\u2011subject experimental design study was adopted. In the present study, participants were asked to complete the MCE task by using DU strategy (e.g., by doing 30 \u00d7 70 = 2100 for 34 \u00d7 67) under different im\u2011 plicit emotion priming conditions, duringwhich theywere asked to regulate their emotion by completing the idiom matching task. Please refer to the Methods section for details. Considering previous studies showed that participants\u2019 ACC of completing the estima\u2011 tion task were not influenced by emotion priming [1,2], and the dual\u2011process framework theory proposed that both explicit and implicit emotion regulation contributed to improv\u2011 ing individuals\u2019 cognitive performance [21], we hypothesized that participants\u2019 RT (but not ACC) of completing the MCE task would be reduced by implicit emotion regulation (hypothesis 1). Additionally, considering a large number of previous studies showed that reappraisal contributed to improving an individual\u2019s cognitive performance, along with less cognitive resource cost than suppression\u2014i.e., the regulation effect of reappraisal was\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77 4 of 19\nbetter than suppression [12,32,33]\u2014we hypothesized that both implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression contributed to estimation question encoding (enlarged P1 and N170 amplitudes). Additionally, individuals who complete the MCE task under implicit reap\u2011 praisal (vs. implicit suppression) condition cost less cognitive resources (reduced LPC amplitudes) (hypothesis 2)."

In order to distinguish neutral facial expressions fromneutralwords, neutralwords were named \u201cview\u201d (consistent with the \u201cfreely view\u201d strategy in the field of emotion reg\u2011 ulation). For a certain idiom, only if not less than 75% (24 participants) of the total number of participants classify it into one of the three groups mentioned above, the idiom can be used in the material of the formal experiment. Additionally, twenty\u2011five college stu\u2011 dents were recruited to evaluate the familiarity of each idiom using a 9\u2011point scale, where \u201c1\u201d means \u201cvery unfamiliar\u201d and \u201c9\u201d means \u201cvery familiar\u201d. Another twenty\u2011five partic\u2011 ipants were asked to use a 9\u2011point scale to evaluate the relevance of the meaning of each idiom to \u201cdescribe natural scenes\u201d (view), \u201cnone of my business\u201d (reappraisal), and \u201chide one\u2019s own emotional experience\u201d (suppression), where \u201c1\u201d means \u201cnot relevant\u201d, and \u201c9\u201d means \u201chighly relevant\u201d. Referring to previous studies [25,35], the fourth group of sub\u2011 jects (25 people) were asked to use a 9\u2011point scale to evaluate their emotional experience elicited by each idiom. The two dimensions of valence and arousal are combined, where \u201c1\u201d means very negative, \u201c5\u201d means calm, \u201c9\u201d means very positive, from 5 to 1 means the negative emotional experience is getting stronger, from 5 to 9means the positive emotional experience is getting stronger. All subjects who participated in the words assessment were no longer participating in the formal experiment. Finally, 72 words were selected as for\u2011 mal experimental materials, of which 40 were view related words, and 16 were reappraisal related words, and 16 were suppression related words. Referring to previous study [27], the familiarity, relatedness to view, reappraisal, and suppression, as well as the emotional experience elicited by the three types of words, were analyzed.

            "text": "The experimental procedure was programmed with E\u2011prime 2.0 (Psychology Soft\u2011 ware Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The formal experiment consisted of 9 blocks, a single block sequentially containing the idiom matching task, MCE task, gender judgment task (GJ task), and emotional experience intensity assessment task (Figure 1). The specific de\u2011 tails are as follows: (1) in the idiommatching task (8 times); a white\u201d+\u201d (500 ms); followed by three words (the target idiom at the top of the screen, while two alternative words were at the bottom of the screen, without time limit, until a response was given); then a blank (200 ms); participants were required to choose which alternative idiom conveyed the same meaning as the target idiomby pressing \u201cF\u201d (for the alternative idiom on the left side) or \u201cJ\u201d (for the alternative idiom on the right side). (2) In the MCE task (54 times) and the GJ task (54 times), the order in which the stimuli were presented in a single trial was as follows: each trial started with a white \u201c+\u201d (500 ms), followed by a blank (200 ms), then the facial expression image (1000 ms), a blank (200 ms), the MCE task (RT or 10,000 ms), and next, the GJ task (unlimited), then a blank (200 ms). The facial expressions were administered in a randomizedmanner, and the probability of presenting each face expression image before the MCE and GJ task was equal. In the MCE task, participants were required to choose the correct answer by using the DU strategy, by pressing \u201cF\u201d (for the alternative answer on the left side) with their left middle finger, or pressing \u201cJ\u201d (for the alternative answer on the right side) with their right middle finger. The alternative answers were calculated by DU and UD strategies. In the GJ task, participants were required to judge the gender of the facial expression by pressing \u201cF\u201d (for the alternative answer on the left side) with their left middle finger, or pressing \u201cJ\u201d (for the alternative answer on the right side) with their right middle finger. Both in theMCE task andGJ task, the correct answer appears in different po\u2011 sitions (on the left and right side) with the same probability. Participants were encouraged to complete both tasks as accurately and quickly as possible, though theGJ task hadno time limit. (3) In the emotional experience intensity assessment task (at the end of each block), participants were required to rate their emotional experience intensity by using a 9\u2011point scale: \u201c1\u201d means \u201cvery calm\u201d, and \u201c9\u201d means \u201cvery strong\u201d. Therefore, the whole experi\u2011 ment consisted of 72 times (9 blocks \u00d7 8 times/block) of the idiommatching task, 486 times (9 blocks \u00d7 54 trials/block) of MCE task, 486 times (9 blocks \u00d7 54 times/block) of GJ task, and 9 times of emotional experience intensity assessment (9 blocks \u00d7 1 time/block).

Using the TCP/IP conn ctions between E\u2011 prime 2.0 and Vision Recorder 2.0 (Brain Product, Gilching, Germany) allowed us to send events from E\u2011prime 2.0 to Vision Recorder 2.0. In the present study, different experimen\u2011 tal conditionswere defined by E\u2011prime 2.0 before the experiment; thus, e could configure E\u2011prime 2.0 to send an event at every onset of a stimulus. Additionally, event marking was adopted for post\u2011processing synchronization. The average epoch for ERP was 3000 ms, including a 200 ms baseline. According to previous studies [1,2,37], the onset was locked on the onset of the facial expression image. Trials were accepted for segmentation only if participants completed both the MCE and the GJ tasks correctly. EEG evoked by the angry, fear, neutral, and happy were averaged.

Based on the topographical distribution of grand\u2011averaged ERP activity of this study and previous studies [38,39], corresponding time windows and electrode sites for the ERP components related to the MCE task and facial expression processing were well extracted. To be more specific, (1) facial expres\u2011 sion processing related components: the mean amplitude of C\u2013N170 (140\u2013180 ms) was analyzed at P5, P6, P7, P8, PO7, and PO8 electrode sites.

The mean amplitude of T\u2011N170 was analyzed at P5, P6, P7, P8, PO3, PO4, PO7, and PO8 electrode sites, during 140\u2013180 ms after MCE task onset (corresponding to the time range of 1340\u20131380 ms post facial expression onset).

Referring to previous studies [13,20,26,40], in order to further ex\u2011 amine the influence of dynamic process of emotion regulation on completing theMCE task, the LPC components were divided into three short time windows: LPC1 (1800\u20132200 ms), LPC2 (2200\u20132600 ms), and LPC3 (2600~3000 ms). The ACC and RT of completing the idiom matching task and the MCE task, and the emotional experience intensity assessment score were analyzed by using ANOVA; the in\u2011 dependent variables were implicit priming emotion type (happy, neutral, and fear) and type of emotion regulation strategies (neutral, reappraisal, and suppression). Addition\u2011 ally, three\u2011factor repeated\u2011measures ANOVA was performed on the ERP data, and the independent variables were implicit priming emotion type, type of emotion regulation strategies, and hemisphere (left hemisphere vs. right hemisphere). Dependent variables were the amplitudes of the ERP component mentioned above. SPSS 16.0 was used for statistical analysis, the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction was applied to the p values, while Bonferroni\u2019s correction was applied to post hoc tests. Additionally, partial eta\u2011squared (\u03b72p ) was used to describe effect sizes."

A recent study [31] showed that high (vs. low) math anxious individuals showed decreases in math accuracy associated with increased electrodermal activity under suppression conditions. However, for both high and low math anxious individuals, reappraisal weakened the relationship between physiological arousal and math accuracy, and even elevated physiological arousal was no longer negatively related with math accuracy, which suggested that reappraisal (but not suppression) contributed to improving a math anxious individual\u2019s math accuracy, which supported our findings to some extent. Considering explicit emotion regulation had been adopted in Pizzie and Kraemer\u2019s work [31], and participants\u2019 math anxiety levels had been measured, we proposed that the regulation effect of suppression on math accuracy would be affected by math anxiety level and emotion regulation style (explicit vs. implicit), while the regulation effect of reappraisal was relatively stable.

In fact, after the formal experiment ended, we also ver\u2011 bally asked all participants how they thought about the purpose of setting theGJ task; none of them reported that the task was adopted to induce their implicit emotional experience, which indicated that we successfully achieved the purpose of implicit emotion priming.

The present study showed that the T\u2011P1 amplitudes elicited by completing the MCE task were larger in the left (vs. right) hemisphere, suggesting that the left hemisphere was more sensitive to completing digit processing tasks, which was consistent with previous studies [53,54]. In terms of the types of implicit emotion regulation strategy types, compared with the baseline (view), the T\u2011P1 amplitudes elicited by completing the MCE task under implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression condition were larger, suggesting that implicit emotion regulation enhanced an individual\u2019s encoding sensitivity to the estimation question. This can be related to pre\u2011 vious studies indicating that the P1 component was an effective indicator of indexing at\u2011 tention to digit\u2011pattern, and that their potential numeric meaning increased attention re\u2011 sources along larger P1 amplitudes [1,15,16]. The present study showed that the T\u2011N170 amplitudes were influenced by the inter\u2011 action effect of implicit priming emotion type and implicit emotion regulation strategy type. To be more specific, compared with the baseline (view) and implicit suppression, implicit reappraisal contributed to estimation question encoding (smaller T\u2011N170 ampli\u2011 tudes) under the implicit neutral priming condition. However, inverse results were found under the implicit fear priming condition, while an individual\u2019s encoding performances were not influenced by implicit emotion regulation under the implicit happy priming con\u2011 dition. Totally speaking, both T\u2011P1 and T\u2011N170 belong to the ERP components induced in the encoding stage of the MCE task; T\u2011N170 (but not T\u2011P1) amplitudes were influenced by the interaction effect of implicit priming emotion type and implicit emotion regulation strategy type, which clearly reveal that the dynamic process of encoding are modulated by implicit emotion regulation. These results indicate the superiority of analyzing several\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77 16 of 19\nsmall time windows (T\u2011P1 and T\u2011N170) separately at the encoding stage, instead of adapt\u2011 ing a general analysis of the ERP amplitude changes over a longer period of time window, such as 0\u2013200 ms [55,56], 0\u2013250 ms, and so on [57]. LPC is a positive component that appears in the visual cortex during the late stages of processing the target stimuli, and it is often regarded as an effective indicator of re\u2011 source allocation in response to attention [58\u201360]. The present study showed that implicit emotion regulation dynamically affected attention allocation while individuals were com\u2011 pleting the MCE task. In the early stage of estimation operation (T\u2011LPC1), a participant\u2019s estimation performance was not influenced by implicit emotion regulation, reflected by the T\u2011LPC1 amplitudes showing no significant differences under different implicit emo\u2011 tion regulation conditions. Meanwhile, in the LPC2 and T\u2011LPC3 stages, the influence of implicit emotion regulation on an individual\u2019s estimation performance was consistent. In detail, the T\u2011LPC2 and T\u2011LPC3 amplitudes were larger when individuals were using the implicit reappraisal (vs. view, implicit suppression) under the implicit fear priming con\u2011 dition. In addition, the corresponding T\u2011LPC2 and T\u2011LPC3 amplitudes under view and implicit suppression conditions showed no significant differences, indicating greater at\u2011 tention resources cost under implicit reappraisal (but not implicit suppression) condition, reflecting the superiority effect of implicit suppression (vs. implicit reappraisal). It should be noted that this superiority effect only occurred under the implicit fear priming condi\u2011 tion, which also indicated that the influence of implicit emotion regulation on an individ\u2011 ual\u2019s estimation performance was modulated by the valence of the implicit priming stimu\u2011 lus. Additionally, the present study showed that both the T\u2011LPC2 and T\u2011LPC3 amplitudes were influenced by implicit emotion regulation, while the T\u2011LPC1 amplitudes were not, suggesting the necessity of dividing LPC into three distinct time windows (LPC1, LPC2, and LPC3), and this was consistent with previous studies [13,20,26,28,40]. Hypothesis two was partly confirmed. To sum up, the behavioral results of this study showed that participants successfully carried out implicit emotion regulation by completing the idiom matching task, and par\u2011 ticipant\u2019s RT (but not ACC) of completing the MCE task with the DU strategy was in\u2011 fluenced by implicit emotion regulation. Implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression equally contributed to improving a participant\u2019s estimation performance under different implicit priming conditions. The ERP results revealed the dynamic time course of implicit emotion regulation affecting estimation performance. Firstly, in the encoding stage, the in\u2011 fluence of implicit reappraisal on encoding sensitivity was increased first (larger T\u2011P1 am\u2011 plitudes) and then decreased (small T\u2011N170 amplitudes), while implicit suppression con\u2011 tributed to improving a participant\u2019s encoding sensitivity (larger T\u2011P1 amplitudes). Sec\u2011 ondly, in the retrieval stage, implicit reappraisal (vs. view) cost more attention resources (larger T\u2011LPC2 and T\u2011LPC3 amplitudes) when completing the MCE task under the im\u2011 plicit fear priming condition, which reflected the advantage effect of implicit expression (vs. implicit reappraisal). The present study investigated the influence of implicit emotion regulation on an indi\u2011 vidual\u2019s estimation performance under implicit emotional priming condition for the first time. The behavioral results showed that an individual\u2019s estimation performances were equally improved (shorter RTs) by implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression, while the ERP results further expanded our understanding of the relationship between implicit emotion regulation and an individual\u2019s estimation performance. In detail, both implicit suppression and implicit reappraisal contributed to improving an individual\u2019s estimation performance, and the regulation effect of implicit suppression was better than implicit reappraisal, especially under the implicit fear priming condition. However, it should be noted that the ACCs around 0.99 suggested that the difficulty of the estimation task may have been too low in order to allow variations, generated by the emotion regulation strat\u2011 egy, to be induced. The behavioral results showed that an individual\u2019s ACCs of completing the MCE task were not influenced by the implicit emotion prime and implicit emotion reg\u2011 ulation; this may be related to the fact that only one estimation strategy has been adopted\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 77 17 of 19\nin the present study, and future studies can verify this speculation by adopting harder estimation strategies (e.g., RD and RU)."

Totally speaking, both implicit reappraisal and implicit suppression contributed to improving an individual\u2019s estimation performance, and the regulation ef\u2011 fect of implicit suppression (vs. implicit reappraisal) was better.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.Z., D.K., D.L. and W.L.; data curation, X.Z., F.L., Y.Z., W.L. andD.L.; formal analysis, C.Z., X.Z. and F.L.; funding acquisition, C.Z.; investigation, X.Z., Y.W. and Y.Z.; methodology, F.L., Y.W., W.L. and D.K.; project administration, C.Z., F.L., Y.W., W.L., D.K. andD.L.; resources, Y.W., Y.Z. andD.L.; software, F.L.; validation, Y.W. andW.L.; visualization, X.Z., Y.Z., W.L. and D.K.; writing\u2014original draft, C.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.Z., D.K., D.L. and W.L.
