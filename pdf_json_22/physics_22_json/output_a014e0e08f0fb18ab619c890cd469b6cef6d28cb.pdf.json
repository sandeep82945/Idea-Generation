    "abstractText": "The emergence of cooperation among self-interested agents has been a key concern of the multi-agent systems community for decades. With the increased importance of networkmediated interaction, researchers have shifted the attention to the impact of social networks and their dynamics in promoting or hindering cooperation, drawing various contextdependent conclusions. For example, some lines of research, theoretical and experimental, suggest the existence of a threshold effect in the ratio of timescales of network evolution, after which cooperation will emerge, whereas other lines dispute this, suggesting instead a Goldilocks zone. In this paper we provide an evolutionary game theory framework to understand coevolutionary processes from a bottom up perspective in particular the emergence of a cooperator-core and defector-periphery clarifying the impact of partner selection and imitation strategies in promoting cooperative behaviour, without assuming underlying communication or reputation mechanisms. In doing so we provide a unifying framework to study imitation-based cooperation in dynamic social networks and show that disputes in the literature can in fact coexist in so far as the results stem from different equally valid assumptions.",

            "text": "From social media, to power grid [35] and road systems [23], to mycorrhizae connecting trees [55], networks play a major role in promoting desirable behaviour. They can improve transport of nutrients or goods [62], they can connect long lost friends [63, 67] and they can even make computer systems resilient to attack [20]. In this paper we focus on how social networks affect the emergence of cooperation in games, specifically the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. Our analysis will entirely be based on the effects of social influence on cooperative choices, without assuming underlying communication or reputation mechanisms. In doing so, we resolve some of the discrepancies seen in the experimental and theoretical literature by proposing a standardised framework of differential equations to compare against.\nThe multi-agent systems community has been greatly concerned with social networks and their effect on interaction since its very start. Social network analysis has been used to derive and extract systems of reputation [42, 46], to explain the emergence of cooperation [14, 47] or conventions [1] and to explore mechanisms of ostracism [40]. Networks have also been used as a policy/control tool to prevent polarisation [52], to promote cooperation via partner selection [50, 51] while also being an emergent property out of reciprocity [38].\nDynamic Networks and Cooperation. When the network is formed by self-interested agents engaging in strategic interaction, some desirable global properties, i.e., achieving Pareto-optimal outcomes, can be hindered by the desire to achieve higher payoff for the agents themselves. Cooperation in the context of game-theory may mean contributing to some collective-risk social dilemma (e.g. investments in green energy) to avoid a collective catastrophe, while defection means no contribution at all [56, 60]; in other settings cooperation may mean incurring some kind of cost (e.g. a tax) to receive social services and defecting means tax-avoidance while benefiting from said services [15]. In this paper in particular we focus on the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, when the benefits of cooperation are outweighed by those of defection, such that the latter is the individually rational choice.\nSocial networks however are rarely, if ever, static and instead are constantly changing. This may be due to an increase in user up-take of an online platform [25], mobility in contact networks [28] or indeed, as in this paper, in response to the behaviour of friends. That is, not only does the network structure impact the game, but the game dynamics also impact the topology of the connections. The question becomes what emerges out of such co-evolutionary processes?\nSome theoretical results [16] backed by empirical evidence [17] have suggested that networks have little effect on cooperation or contribution [59]. However, these findings have been obtained using static networks, while a positive effect on cooperation was found experimentally in dynamic [43, 65] and temporal [26] networks with some analytic backing [34, 39, 49]. Even static networks were found to improve cooperation in experiments [44], simulations [48] and theory [12, 33, 39], though it seems to be the case that dynamic networks are far more amenable to cooperation than their static counterparts [29].\nTime Scales. When partnerships are imposed exogenously the importance of time scales - characteristic lengths of time over which a particular process occurs - is highlighted; when edge activity is \u201cbursty\u201d - i.e. narrow, sudden spikes of activity - cooperation is impeded while intermediate temporality analytically maximises cooperation [26]. Other studies have found a similar Goldilocks zone - maximal gain for an intermediate value(s) of input(s) - in the time scales [54].\nAutonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (2022) 36:34\n1 3\nPage 3 of 25 34\nOther streams of research, however, have focused on a threshold effect or time scale separation, where above a certain threshold cooperation flourishes, and below it fails. On the one hand, a few experiments have reported no evidence for such a threshold [65], likely due to considering too restricted a span of time scales, specifically the ratio between strategy and tie update rates. On the other hand, other works support the existence of a threshold [22, 43], which are further backed by a slew of theoretic work [34, 39, 49] that have direct analogues in percolation theory [8, 36].\nExperiments and Theory The conflict about which qualitative phenomenon occurs partially reflects the variety of often disjoint assumptions, frameworks and foundational concepts in the literature, at least in terms of temporal aspects. There is certainly a disconnect between theory and experiment; the former mostly considers large time evolution [39] or steady-state results [34] while experiments are typically limited to short term studies on the scale of tens of rounds [43, 44, 65]. There is then great variety in partner selection (e.g. random, round-robin, preferential) for experiments or dynamic tie updates for simulations, occurring in different regimes of the ratio between strategic and topological time scales [13, 34, 49].\nMoreover, such experiments rarely, if ever, vary the ratio of timescales and as such there is very little empirical data regarding timescale separation. Understanding systematically why theories offer very different predictions, each backed by their own set of experiments, is a crucial task to truly understand cooperation. The core of such a task is to identify where fundamental assumptions align, differ or are compatible in a systematic way that has yet to be undertaken by current research.\nPopularity of Cooperators Regardless of the macroscopic phenomena - Goldilocks zone or time scale separation - experimental results have broadly agreed that those who cooperate tend to be more popular than their misbehaving counterparts. This has then informed the theory, including in our work, of how agents connect to one another. When networks are dynamic and ties are at least partly endogenous - that is, individuals choose to break/ form ties rather than being enforced by, say, the researcher - subjects rarely break links with a cooperator [43] partially causing them to have higher degree [4]. In fact as cooperators attract preferential attachment [39, 41, 48], they emerge as \u201cleaders\u201d with high payoff [9].\nAssortativity for mutually cooperative links arises out of subjects avoiding defectors when connections are formed bilaterally [65] and via unfriending misbehaving neighbours formed unilaterally [10, 43]. Moreover through ostracism [27] and punishment (for example sanctions as a form of costly ostracism [40]), the co-evolutionary process generates networks with scale-free degree distributions, that promote even more cooperation [48], and are heavily clustered [10] around cooperators [45]. Despite these results, the literature has rarely discussed the topology of the networks that form over long periods of time due to these phenomena.\nIn this paper we show theoretically and illustrate by simulations that a highly-interconnected sub-graph or core of cooperators, collectively working and benefiting one another, forms while being surrounded by parasitic defectors in the periphery, mostly avoiding one another while clinging to cooperators in the core. This structure we dub the cooperatorcore defector-periphery (CCDP).\nCooperation without Reputation Although there is solid theoretical and empirical evidence that reputation is an important mechanism for promoting cooperation [7, 30, 31, 37, 46], here we take an alternative approach and look at the emergence of cooperation when reputation or other communication mechanisms are not available or not reliable enough, and simply focus on the effects of imitation strategies and network dynamics on promoting\n1 3"

CANDY starts with assumptions on agents\u2019 decision-making - how someone decides to cooperate/defect (the imitation strategy) and chooses to befriend/unfriend others (the network evolution) - and produces the resulting average payoff and total number of cooperators. An illustration of the type of results CANDY can produce is given in Fig.\u00a0\u00a01.\nMethodologically, this framework allows for rigorously testing and comparing different assumptions, finding sets of assumptions which are compatible with empirical data and overcome much of the literature heterogeneity. For instance one may suspect the division in whether the ratio of timescales produces a threshold or Goldilocks effect to be due to the differences in assumptions theorists made or in exogenous update rules imposed upon test subjects. Our framework allows the coexistence of such incompatible results by rigorously scrutinising the underlying assumptions.\nTo illustrate the power of the CANDY framework, we recover the theoretical results [34] for when edges undergo a birth-death process and strategies follow a Moran [32, 61] or Wright-Fisher [21] process. Furthermore, we consider other edge update models (such as cooperator-popularity) and behavioural models (such as conditional cooperation) that capture the assumptions of other research lines, in order to illustrate the qualitative differences that emerge.\nMoreover, we provide a nuanced discussion on timescale separation by reproducing both the threshold effect as seen in [22, 34, 39, 43, 49] and a Goldilocks zone for defection; in many cases we suspect such effects are really artefacts of the finite number of rounds occurring. In recovering both phenomena we highlight how sensitive results are to both\nAutonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (2022) 36:34\n1 3\nPage 5 of 25 34\ninitial conditions and to the assumptions of the researcher. That is to say, by having slightly different but equally valid assumptions, the qualitative results can be significantly different.\nFinally we illustrate how one assumption/observation - that cooperators are more popular - can lead to the emergence of the same core-periphery structure, despite instrumentally different update rules. Such core-periphery structures have been observed in experiments with human subjects [57] and other agent-based models [45, 53], even when edges can only be broken, not formed for agents with multidimensional opinion spaces; there is an intuitive correspondence between our cooperators and defectors to homogeneous and adversarial agents respectively seen in [53]."

For reference, therefore, we write below the equations for the total number of cooperators C and the average payoff ?\u0304? in terms of local variables.\nRather than dealing with strictly discrete variables, we can instead move to the continuum by considering probabilities - here such probabilities are also identically the expectations of binary variables.

So long as the update rules have a closed form, the above N(N + 1) equations fully specify the dynamics. CANDY allows for update rules that are time-dependent, parameterised and/or heterogeneous - suffice to say an incredibly broad range of possibilities. Moreover, by integrating the vector fields f g and f s , the flows (see Appendix B for more detail) are fully recovered = ( g, s) allowing researchers to potentially sidestep lengthy and computationally heavy agent-based simulations.\nThe evolution of C and ?\u0304? are further gotten by differentiating Eqs.\u00a04 and 5 to get DEs in terms of the generalised processes.\nIn specifying the local evolution due to f g and f s , researchers are able to clearly lay out their assumptions, numerically integrate and finally compare predictions. This generative method follows the same approach as much of the agent-based modelling community, but with the added bonus of allowing for comparisons between qualitatively different hypotheses as it provides a standard framework to work within.\nIn general solving for the two global variables requires local knowledge and solutions may not be analytically tractable. However under certain local processes, FC and F may be written only in terms of C and ?\u0304? (and generally t), in which case the global behaviour reduces significantly down to a system of 2 coupled DEs, or even a single equation. When analytic solutions do not exist, numerical integration may still provide a computational improvement on pure agent-based simulations, depending on the level of heterogeneity. The more homogeneous the population - and hence the fewer unique coupled equations to solve - the more efficient and accurate a numerical integration method would be.\nAt worst, for example, if all agents were entirely unique with unique strategies then CANDY would perform as slowly as a complex ABM. Furthermore writing down neat or efficient equations to describe increasingly complex interactions becomes more difficult. However a sufficiently complex ABM would also suffer a similar difficulty when more and more externalities, socio-cognitive factors, etc. are considered.\nIn the next two sections we look at the two dimensions of the coevolutionary process, that of partner-updates and that of strategy-updates. We treat the two processes as\n(10)f g ij =gij(0, 1)(1 \u2212 a\u0303ij) \u2212 gij(1, 0)a\u0303ij\n(11)f si =hi(0, 1)(1 \u2212 s\u0303i) \u2212 hi(1, 0)s\u0303i\n(12) dC\ndt \u2261 FC =\n\u2211\ni\u2208V\nf s i\n(13) d?\u0304?\ndt \u2261 F\ud835\udf0b =\nb \u2212 c\nN\n\u2211\ni,j\u2208V\n(f g\nij s\u0303i + a\u0303ijf s i )\n2 Strictly speaking such transition rates depend on the realisation/observation/sample of the Bernoulli variables, not on the respective parameters - in other words dependence is on the non-tilde quantities.

If the alter j is a cooperator, sj = 1 , then the ego i will unilaterally form an edge with j if none previously existed. Otherwise if j is a defector, sj = 0 , i will unilaterally break ties with j if the edge already existed. Note that by specifying at each time step we have inadvertently set a graph-theoretic timescale g ; in the units of time-steps g = 1 but one could also use units defined by the total number of edges possible - in other words the number of dyads - T = N(N \u2212 1)\u22152.\nFrom this, we can specify the transition rate for an edge (i,\u00a0j) to form gij(0, 1) or break gij(1, 0).\nThe factor of 1/2 is the probability to choose the active node as the ego, i.e. the one to unilaterally make or break a tie.

Finally the evolution of a\u0303ij can be found by summing the gain terms and loss terms.\nAs a sanity check when both i and j cooperate and are connected, f g = 0 so the edge is stable. Similarly when both are defectors and disconnected f g = 0 so the lack of an edge is stable too. Finally in general, as strategies are not fixed, to compensate for their probabilistic nature, we can simply replace si with s\u0303i . The utility of having such a kernel is that we can obtain a DE for ki - simply sum over all j \u2260 i , k\u0307i = \u2211 j\u2260i f g ij - and by extension a DE for the payoff per capita when strategies are fixed."

In reality someone may copy a friend even if their payoff was worse; for a start there might be some leniency where a friend might earn $10 more but I do not instantly side with him. Moreover, although a single friend may earn more via their alternative strategy, there may be social pressures to stick to my current strategy. Model 2 takes the extreme and assumes the only thing that matters is the number of friends with a given strategy, so that if 80% of my neighbourhood are cooperators I\u2019m 80% likely to cooperate.\nThe birth-death process of [39] takes a hybrid/intermediate stance relative to Models 1 and 2. It assumes that a) payoffs matter for imitation but not as rigidly as a step function - instead it should be smooth and continuous - and b) that social pressures also matter, so that the probability to flip strategies is given by the average probability to imitate an alternative strategy. Explicitly, the probability pij for i to imitate the alternative strategy of j, i.e. si \u2260 sj , follows a sigmoid with parameter measuring the strength of peer pressure and payoffs acting as the energies. The probability for i to flip strategies is the mean of pairwise pij over alternative-strategy neighbours.

We begin with the graph-theoretic models sans strategy - that is cooperators and defectors are fixed but they may change friendships - to illustrate how the network evolves and the structures that emerge. As both extreme popularity and active linking produce similar core-periphery mesostructures, we then combine extreme popularity - being the simplest model - with the three behavioural models: imitate-payoff, conditional cooperation and pairwise comparison. In doing so we identify cases where timescales separate and cases where they do not.\nFor our computational examples and illustrations in Figs.\u00a0 2, 3, 4 and 5 we simulate using N = 20 agents, 100 runs of a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with (b, c) = (100, 50) to be in line with the experiments of [43]. Each simulation is ran for 5T = 950 time-steps, where T is the number of dyads T = N(N \u2212 1)\u22152 = 190 . In this way, as 1 edge is updated at each timestep, then on average in T time-steps then all node pairs (dyads) are updated once.\nMoreover, our simulations begin with a variety of initial network conditions, that is networks produced by different random graph generators.\n\u2013 Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e8nyi (ER) - the canonical random graph model where pairs of nodes are connected with probability p = 0.2. \u2013 Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) - a preferential attachment model that grows a network of N = 20 nodes by continuously adding nodes with m = 3 edges.\n\u2013 Random assignment (rBA) - the initial cooperators are randomly assigned. \u2013 Highest assignment (hBA) - the initial cooperators are assigned to the nodes with\nhighest degree.\n\u2013 Cooperator Clique (CClique) - the C = 15 initial cooperators are completely connected to one another as a clique, while the remaining defectors are entirely disconnected from all others. \u2013 Complete - all nodes are attached to one another. \u2013 Stochastic Block Model (SBM) - specifically we use the assortative planted partition\nmodel [6], a special case of an SBM, with 2 communities, with an in-group edge probability of p = 0.8 and out-group edge probability of q = 0.02.\n(22)\nf s i =\n1\n\ud835\udf0fs\n\ufffd\nj\u2208V\npij ki aij \ufffd (1 \u2212 s\u0303i)s\u0303j \u2212 s\u0303i(1 \u2212 s\u0303j) \ufffd\n= 1\n\ud835\udf0fski\n\ufffd\nj\u2208V\npijaij \ufffd s\u0303j \u2212 s\u0303i \ufffd\n= 1\n\ud835\udf0fski\n\ufffd\nj\u2208V\naij(s\u0303j \u2212 s\u0303i)\n1 + exp[\u2212\ud835\udefd \u2211\nl\u2208V (bsl \u2212 c)(ajl \u2212 ail)]\n1 3"

In fact once strategies are allowed to change, as we will see in the next section, the two absorbing fixed points of the system are in effect core-peripheries of C = 0 and C = N . That is, either the system turns into a complete graph of only cooperators, or an empty graph of only defectors; the stability of these two states is governed entirely by what strategy-update rules are implemented, i.e. the assumptions of how people decide to cooperate or defect."

After 5T rounds the ensemble-average payoff per capita is measured and plotted. A commonality to note is towards the fixed strategy limit, the rate of cooperation tends towards the initial C = 15 precisely because exceedingly few people have changed from cooperate to defect (or vice versa).\nFor comparison, in experiments where a fraction of subject pairs - such as in [65] and [57] - are picked at random to update every round, s\u2215 g = .

            "text": "As seen in Fig.\u00a0 3, there is a separation of time scales in most realistic graphs under extreme popularity (GM1) and imitate-payoff (BM1). After such a long period of time most of the realistic graph models behave near identically with mass defection occurring consistently for \ud835\udf0fs\u2215\ud835\udf0fg < 10 and non-zero levels of cooperation persisting above this threshold. The difference in behaviour between the static network limit and the dynamic network - that the fraction of cooperators is higher in the dynamic case - has been observed in experiments [65].\nHowever for the CClique initial graph - a highly artificial/pathological network where all cooperators begin as friends with all defectors entirely disconnected - playing under the same rules a reverse Goldilocks zone appears. That is for intermediate values of s\u2215 g defection is rife, while towards the fixed network limit cooperation is nearly maximal.\nFrom an individual\u2019s perspective placed in a realistic graph, defection is the optimal and preferential strategy - the population is mixed enough that defectors can infect cooperators. As such when strategies can update quickly enough, all players have enough time to defect hence mass defection occurs. However when strategies are slow to update, there simply is not enough time for everyone to defect; consider when s\u2215 g = 10 , although all pairs have been updated around 5 times each, only around half of possible imitation updates have occurred.\nIn contrast, the CClique condition actually promotes cooperation at the individual level, at least in the early stages, precisely due to the core being resilient against defection. Note that the strategy vector s will only start to change once a defector has attached to the core - otherwise there will be no alternative strategy to imitate from. Provided the core is large enough, when strategies update rapidly the likelihood of a defector imitating a cooperator is far higher than the reverse, in other words the core converts defectors quicker than they can infiltrate the core. As the edges update quicker, more and more defectors can attach themselves to the core quickly enough to start converting the cooperators. After some point strategies become too slow for everyone to defect hence the payoff per capita rises again in the limit of fixed strategy. These two competing factors thus produce a reverse Goldilocks zone, where cooperation is minimised, not maximised, at intermediate ratios.\nFinally note that for all realistic initial conditions when the network is static ( s\u2215 g = 0 ), we reproduce the qualitative result, seen empirically in [16, 17] and theoretically in [59], that static networks do not promote cooperation. In fact this behaviour appears again for different strategy update rules, such as the conditional cooperation in the left of Fig.\u00a04. However let us be clear that this is not always the case, across all static networks and across all update rules; we can qualitatively capture the discrepancies seen in the literature."

For v = (0.2, 0.8) , that is when cooperators easily defect, we see a similar curve for most realistic initial conditions as in the imitate-payoff case - heavy defection for low ratios with higher cooperation at higher\nAutonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (2022) 36:34\n1 3\nPage 19 of 25 34\nratios. However we already see differences, for a start when cooperators have the highest degree in a scale-free graph non-zero cooperative levels are maintained at all s\u2215 g . This directly contrasts the rBA condition, where cooperators are randomly assigned in a scale-free graph. This result alone implies possible policy implications in order to sustain global cooperation.\nSecond, unlike in Fig.\u00a0 3, the CClique condition no longer produces a minimum in cooperators, instead there is a clear separation where mass cooperation occurs. If the simulations were to run longer then we would see mass cooperation at all ratios, whereas for the realistic initial graphs mass defection would occur. This suggests that for this parameter set, this rule combined with the network structure heavily promotes cooperation at all times.\nThird, we see how the parameter values control the extent to which cooperation is promoted, looking at the right of Fig.\u00a04. This happens because the threshold to defect is now much higher, so that cooperators remain cooperative, while defectors begin to cooperate, thus cooperative rate only ever increases."

That is cooperation is promoted across all s\u2215 g likely as there are already many cooperators to begin with so that a defector feels an immense amount of peer pressure to cooperate. In this case when is lower, the resultant level of cooperation will be similarly smaller, as there is less pressure to imitate them; otherwise increasing would increase the speed at which mass cooperation happens. Moreover, we suspect the role of initial number of cooperators to be vital, that varying C0 \u2261 C(0) will lead to a bifurcation in C\u221e \u2261 C(t \u2192 \u221e) . Already two bifurcation points are trivial, C0 = 0 and C0 = N , as in both cases there are no alternative views to copy hence C\u221e = C0.\nInterestingly here, the CClique initial condition produces the lowest payoff per capita - unlike under different behavioural models. Even nearer the fixed strategy limit, the payoff per capita is around 50 units short of the realistic networks - this suggests that inside the core roughly one cooperator has had the chance and decided to defect.\nConsider the CClique\u2019s evolution at intermediate times - that is when defectors have connected to the core but no agent has changed strategies - where there are C0 cooperators and each cooperator has on average d defecting friends (hence each defector has on average C0d\u2215D cooperative partners.

Moreover, when \ud835\udf0fs\u2215\ud835\udf0fg >> 1 , we can use Eq.\u00a023 to estimate d(t) \u2248 (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212t\u2215 g))D\u22152 - so that d grows rapidly past d = 2 towards d = D\u22152 .

In using a singular framework, CANDY, we are able to isolate which assumptions and to what end they promote mass cooperation, suggesting that discrepancies in the literature arise from different assumptions and experimental design than being necessarily descriptive of real-world behaviour.\nThrough our framework we have been able to reconstruct the qualitative results of many previous works, even where they may at first glance seem contradictory. For a start, multiple experiments [43, 44], agent-based simulations [48] and theory [12, 33, 39] show that non-zero levels of cooperation are maintained when strategies are updated sufficiently quick ( s\u2215 g small) or similarly when networks are fully static; we see this across all initial networks for the pairwise comparison rule (Fig.\u00a05) and for the conditional cooperation under the right parameter regime (right of Fig.\u00a04). Moreover, for some rules we considered, we see a threshold effect in the timescales that has been theorised by [34] and [49] while in other cases we see a distinct lack of one as in the conditional cooperation (right of Fig.\u00a04) reported by [65]. Finally we are able to replicate some of the empirical trends seen in experiments [43, 65], that for higher s\u2215 g a higher rate of cooperation is maintained.\nOur analysis suggests that although the speed of interactions (both behavioural and relational) is an important factor, it is not in general a sufficient condition for mass cooperation as suggested in [26], and is largely a by-product of the finite nature of the game. In the majority of conditions, we observed a threshold effect in the relative update speed s\u2215 g ; however given infinite time for any ratio of timescales, such a \u2019threshold\u2019 disappears, and mass cooperation/defection depends upon the condition. For example as seen in the conditional cooperation with extreme popularity, the initial network structure matters immensely and can either promote cooperation or promote defection. In other words, time-permitting, what truly matters is the context, the game structure(s) and the decision-making style of agents, not the relative speed of updates.\nThe one exception is in the single case of a so-called Goldilocks zone in defectors, where, for the pathological CClique initial network, a near static network promotes cooperation while rapid edge updates seem to favour defection. In the infinite time limit we would expect to see a threshold emerging.\nNotable future research avenues include the study of games other than the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and the analysis of real-world group formation, such as working groups exhibiting hierarchical compartmentalisation and shifting pairwise interaction (e.g., Facebook or MS Teams).\nUnderstanding the core-peripheral structures that emerge in real-world interaction, where cooperators collaborate closely with one another and defectors are ostracised, may have useful policy implications.\nA further avenue for future work would be to explore a protocol whereby defectors are slowly engaged and introduced into the cooperator-core, to reduce the temptation on a cooperator to defect and to ease the defector into a more positive mindset.\nAutonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (2022) 36:34\n1 3\nPage 21 of 25 34"

The product Z = ZXZY = \u2211 i,j XiYj is Poisson binomial Z \u223c PB(pX, pY).\nAs C is the sum of N independent non-identical Bernoulli distributions it is Poisson binomial, C \u223c PB(s\u0303) , with mean \u2211\ni\u2208V s\u0303i [66]. Moreover, by Proposition\u00a02, the per capita payoff is similarly Poisson binomial, with mean \u2211\ni,j\u2208V a\u0303ijs\u0303j(b \u2212 c)\u2215N . In other words we can replace the local variables on the right hand side of Eq.\u00a04 and 5 with their respective probabilities to find the expectations of the global variables, which for brevity we also denote as C and ?\u0304?.\n(27)aij \u223c Bern(a\u0303ij)\n(28)si \u223c Bern(s\u0303i)\n4 Even though the distribution parameters follow coupled differential equations, the random variables are importantly pointwise independent and thus statistically independent.\nAutonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (2022) 36:34\n1 3"

Equivalently one can think of this as the space of N \u00d7 N adjacency matrices with bounded weights. Similarly let S\u0303 = [0, 1]N be the space of N probabilities to cooperate, or equivalently the space of N continuous strategies. Conceptually we are thus considering a point (A\u0303, s) \u2208 A\u0303 \u00d7 S\u0303 in the product space, that moves continuously due to the vector field F, which represents the coevolutionary process.\nAnalogously to flows and vector fields in \u211d2 which have an x-component and a y-component, our velocity F has an \u2018adjacency-component\u2019, f g , and a \u2018strategy-component\u2019 f s ; each \u2018component\u2019 is in fact either matrix-valued or vector-valued. Assuming the process does not explicitly depend on node-labels we can further assign two a time scale to each component: a graph-theoretic g and a strategic s.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
