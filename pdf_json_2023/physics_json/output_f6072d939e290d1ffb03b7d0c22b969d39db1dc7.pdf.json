INTRODUCTION This communication follows up on and extends our recently proposed general-purpose theoretical framework for estimating the effect of placing molecular matter in a photonic cavity on the rates of electronic energy and charge transfer processes.1 Our strategy is based on equilibrium Fermi\u2019s Golden Rule (FGR) rate theory, which treats the coupling between the electronic and photonic degrees of freedom (DOF) as a small perturbation within the framework of second order perturbation theory. The reader is referred to Ref. 1 for a detailed description and analysis of our framework in the case where the photonic DOF correspond to a single cavity mode. In this communication we examine the effect of going from a model that accounts for a single cavity mode in a one-dimensional cavity to a more realistic model that accounts for multiple cavity modes in a two-dimensional cavity.\nThe main findings reported in this communication are: (1) Similar to the single-mode case, cavity-modified FGR rate constants can be obtained from cavity-free inputs in the case of multiple modes; (2) The cumulative effect of coupling to multiple modes can enhance FGR rate constants by orders of magnitude relative to the single mode case; (3) A generalization of the cavity-modified Marcus rate theory from the case of a single mode to the case of multiple modes."

It should be noted that, while the nuclear Hamiltonians H\u0302nD and H\u0302 n A are electronic-state specific, the corresponding photonic Hamiltonian, H\u0302 p, is not. Going forward, we will also assume that the molecular electronic coupling term satisfies the Condon approximation, such that V\u0302nDA = V n DA (a constant, as opposed to a nuclear operator). Finally, we note that the Hamiltonian of the molecular system in the cavity-free case is given by\nH\u0302 m = H\u0302nD\u2223D\u27e9\u27e8D\u2223 + H\u0302 n A\u2223A\u27e9\u27e8A\u2223 + V\u0302 n DA[\u2223D\u27e9\u27e8A\u2223 + \u2223A\u27e9\u27e8D\u2223], (3)\nwhere the superscript m will be used throughout to indicate purely molecular (i.e. cavity-free) operators.\nIn this work, the photonic Hamiltonian and electronic coupling term are assumed to account for contributions from multiple cavity modes:1\nH\u0302 p =\u2211 \u03b1 H\u0302 p\u03b1 = 1 2\u2211\u03b1 (p\u03022p\u03b1 + \u03c9 2 p\u03b1q\u0302 2 p\u03b1), (4)\nV\u0302pDA =\u2211 \u03b1 V\u0302p\u03b1DA =\u2211 \u03b1\n\u221a 2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1gp\u03b1 q\u0302p\u03b1. (5)\nHere, H\u0302 p\u03b1 and V\u0302p\u03b1DA are the contributions of the \u03b1-th cavity mode to the photonic Hamiltonian and electronic coupling term, respectively (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, . . .). This should be contrasted with Ref. 1 where only a single photonic mode was assumed (i.e. the above sums over the index \u03b1 reduce to a single term). {q\u0302p\u03b1}, {p\u0302p\u03b1} and {\u03c9p\u03b1} are the positions, momenta and angular frequencies associated with the cavity modes and\ngp\u03b1 =\n\u00bf \u00c1 \u00c1\u00c0\u03bc2DA\u03c9p\u03b1\n2h\u0335\u03b50V , (6)\nwhere \u03bcDA is the donor-acceptor transition dipole moment, \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity and V is the volume of the cavity.\nIn the next step, we specialize to the case of a two-dimensional cavity with the z and x-directions parallel and perpendicular to the mirrors, respectively. The frequencies of the photonic modes in such a case are given by:\n\u03c9p = c\nnr\n\u221a\nk2x + k 2 z , (7)\nwhere kx and kz are wave vectors that correspond to the respective directions and nr is the refractive index. In the x-direction we restrict ourselves to the fundamental mode k0,x = \u03c0/Lx, where Lx is the width of the cavity along the x axis, while in the z-direction the modes are assumed to satisfy periodic boundary condition, such that k\u03b1z = 2\u03b1\u03c0/Lz , where Lz is the length of the cavity along the z axis. Substituting kx = k0,x = \u03c0/Lx and k\u03b1z = 2\u03b1\u03c0/Lz back into Eq. (7) yields:\n\u03c9p\u03b1 = \u221a \u03c92p0 + \u03b1 2\u03b42z , (8)\nwhere \u03c9p0 = c\u03c0/(nrLx) is the fundamental cavity frequency along the x axis, and \u03b4z = 2c\u03c0/(nrLz) is assumed to be a parameter\nindependent of Lx or \u03c9p0.2,3 We also assume that gp\u03b1 is proportional to\u221a\u03c9p0\u03c9p\u03b1, such that the dimensionless parameter \u03c7 defined by Eq. (9), which measures strength of the cavity-induced electronic coupling relative to that of the cavity-free electronic coupling, is independent of \u03b1:\n1 \u03c7 \u2261 h\u03352g2p\u03b1 (VnDA\u03b2h\u0335) 2\u03c9p0\u03c9p\u03b1 .

This assumption, together with the assumption that the onset of rate kinetics happens on a time scale which is much faster than the time scale of the actual electronic transition (set by the inverse of the rate constant), results in the following expression for the cavity-modified donor-to-acceptor transition rate constant:1,4\u20136\nkD\u2192A = 1 h\u03352\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dt CD\u2192A(t).

Following a similar procedure to that applied to a single-mode model in Ref. 1, and taking advantage of the fact that the modes in the multiple-mode case are uncoupled, then leads to the following expression for kD\u2192AkmD\u2192A :\nkD\u2192A kmD\u2192A = 1 +\u2211 \u03b1 h\u03352g2p\u03b1 (VnDA) 2 \u27e8N\u0302(\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1)\u27e9eq[ kmD\u2192A(\u03c9p\u03b1) kmD\u2192A(0) + kmA\u2192D(\u03c9p\u03b1) kmA\u2192D(0) ].\n(14)\nHere, \u27e8N\u0302(\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1)\u27e9 is the expectation value of the number of photons in the \u03b1-th cavity mode at thermal equilibrium,\n\u27e8N\u0302(\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1)\u27e9eq = 1\ne\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1 \u2212 1 , (15)\nkmD\u2192A(\u03c9p\u03b1) is given by\nkmD\u2192A(\u03c9p\u03b1) = 1 h\u03352\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9p\u03b1tCmD\u2192A(t), (16)\nand kmA\u2192D(\u03c9p\u03b1) can be obtained from kmD\u2192A(\u03c9p\u03b1) by switching the labels A and D in Eqs.

It should be noted that kmD\u2192A(0) \u2261 k m D\u2192A and k m A\u2192D(0) \u2261 k m A\u2192D are the cavity-free donorto-acceptor and acceptor-to-donor transition rate constants, respectively. It should be noted that kD\u2192AkmD\u2192A \u2192\u221e when VDA \u2192 0, which reflects the fact that the cavity-free kmD\u2192A \u2192 0 when VDA \u2192 0, while the cavity-modified kD\u2192A remains finite.\nEquation (14) is the main result of this communication. It represents a generalization of a similar expression obtained for the single-mode case in Ref. 1. The main difference is the sum over multiple modes on the R.H.S. of Eq. (14), which reduces to a single term in the single cavity mode case studied in Ref. 1. Since every term in the sum on the R.H.S. of Eq. (14) is non-negative, we conclude that kD\u2192AkmD\u2192A \u2265 1, with equality in the cavity-free case. Thus, within our model, coupling to cavity modes would always enhance the rate constant, with the overall enhancement consisting of the sum of enhancements associated with coupling to individual cavity modes. In this communication, we will focus on the effect on the cavityinduced enhancement of the donor-to-acceptor rate constant caused by going from a single mode to multiple modes. To this end, we focus on electronic energy and charge transfer reactions whose cavity-free kinetics can be described by Marcus theory, which corresponds to a widely used approximate version of FGR-based rate theory."

(17d)\nHere, \u0394E is the cavity-free donor-to-acceptor reaction free energy and Er is the cavity-free reorganization energy. In what follows, we will assume that the cavity-free donor-to-acceptor (D\u2192 A), transition is thermodynamically favorable (i.e. \u0394E < 0).\nFollowing a procedure similar to that followed in Ref. 1, we define the following multi-mode cavity enhancement function of the Marcus theory rate constant:\nF(\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p0,\u03b2h\u0335\u03b4z) = \u03c7( kD\u2192A kmD\u2192A \u2212 1)\n=\u2211 \u03b1\n\u03b22h\u03352\u03c9p0\u03c9p\u03b1\u27e8N\u0302(\u03b2h\u0335\u03c9p\u03b1)\u27e9eq\n\u00d7 [ kmD\u2192A(\u03c9p\u03b1)\nkmD\u2192A(0) + kmA\u2192D(\u03c9p\u03b1) kmA\u2192D(0) ]. (18)\nWe note that the frequencies of the multiple cavity modes, {\u03c9p\u03b1\u2223\u03b1 = 1, 2, . . .}, depend on two parameters, which are determined by the experimental setup, namely \u03c9p0 and \u03b4z [see Eq. (8)]. The results presented below are based on assuming that \u03b4z = 0.5 a.u., which corresponds to Lz \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm [using \u03b4z = 2c\u03c0/(nrLz) and assuming nr = 1]. We also consider a range of \u03c9p0 values such that \u03b2h\u03c9p0 \u2208 [1, 50], which corresponds to Lx \u2208 [0.5 \u2212 20] \u03bcm [using \u03c9p0 = c\u03c0/(nrLx) and assuming nr = 1 and T = 300 K]. The fact that the length scale of the cavity (as measrued by Lx and Ly) is in the \u03bcm range implies that they correspond to experimentally accessible microcavities. We also consider values of \u03b2\u2223\u0394E\u2223 and \u03b2Er between 5 and 50. This corresponds to \u2223\u0394E\u2223 and Er in the (0.13\u20131.30) eV range at room temperature, which is typical for charge transfer reactions in molecular systems.1 In what follows, we will focus on analyzing the effect of going from a single cavity mode to multiple cavity modes on the cavity-induced enhancement of the Marcus theory rate constant.\nThe cavity enhancement function in Eq. (18), F(\u03b2h\u03c9p0, \u03b2h\u03b4z), is shown in Fig. 1, as a function \u03c9p0, for different numbers of cavity modes (1, 2, 10, 100).

Also shown in Fig. 1 is the contribution from the dominant cavity mode, which corresponds to the cavity mode with the largest contribution to the sum on the R.H.S. of Eq. (18). Inspection of Fig. 1 reveals that going from a single cavity mode to multiple cavity modes can enhance the cavity-modified Marcus theory rate constant by at least an order of magnitude. Furthermore, the additional enhancement is cumulative, i.e. the enhancement results from summing over multiple terms on the R.H.S. of Eq. (18) and cannot be explained by a single dominant mode. We also note that while the dominant term corresponds to\nJ. Chem.

To this end, we extended our recently proposed theoretical framework for estimating cavity-modified equilibrium FGR rate constants1 beyond the single cavity mode case to cases where the molecular system is coupled to multiple cavity modes.\nSimilarly to the single-mode framework in Ref. 1, the FGR rate constant can be calculated from cavity-free inputs in the multi-mode case. Our major finding is that accounting for multiple cavity modes\ncan enhance the Marcus theory rate constant by several orders of magnitude in comparison to the single-mode case. Furthermore, the additional enhancement is cumulative and cannot be explained by a single dominant mode. Another finding is that the rate is affected by a finite number of cavity modes whose frequency lies below a cutoff frequency. A detailed analysis of the conditions necessary for maximizing this effect and its dependence on the reaction energy and reorganization energy was presented in the case of the Marcus limit of FGR rate theory.\nWhile being rather general, the proposed framework is still based on a number of assumptions, including restricting ourselves to two electronic states, assuming zero permanent dipole moments and neglecting nonequilibrium effects. Extending the framework beyond those restrictive assumptions would be desirable towards closing the gap between theory and experiment in this emerging domain of chemical reactivity."
