    "abstractText": "Sustained attention is critical to cognition, social competence, and academic success. Importantly, sustained attention undergoes significant development over the early childhood period. Yet, how sustained attention fluctuates over time on task has not been clearly outlined, particularly in young children. In this study, we provide a first test of whether the pupillary response can be used as an indicator of moment-to-moment sustained attention over time on task in young children. Children aged 5 to 7 years (N = 41) completed a psychomotor vigilance task, where they were asked to press a button as fast as possible at the onset of a target stimulus. We measured reaction times over the course of the task, pupil size prior to target onset (baseline pupil size), and pupil size in response to target onset (task-evoked pupil size). The results showed a stereotypical vigilance decrement in children\u2019s response times: as time on task increased, reaction times increased. Critically, children\u2019s task-evoked pupil size decreased over time on task, while no such change was present in baseline pupil size. These results suggest that young children\u2019s waning sustained attention may be linked to a decrease in alertness while overall arousal is maintained. We discuss the importance of leveraging pupillometry to understand the mechanisms of sustained attention over individuals and development.",

            "text": "Sustained attention, the ability to maintain focus on a task for a prolonged period of time, is a hallmark of an intelligent cognitive system. The ability to sustain attention has been found to underlie many important behaviors, including key cognitive processes, such as language, memory, and cognitive flexibility (Benitez et al. 2017; Choudhury and Gorman 2000; Jongman et al. 2015; McQuillan et al. 2021; Yu et al. 2019), skills critical to academic success (Gardner-Neblett et al. 2014; Isbell et al. 2018; Rhoades et al. 2011; West et al. 2021) and social competence (Andrade et al. 2009; Davies et al. 2008). Given the importance of sustained attention, a large body of literature has documented how this ability varies across individuals (Isbell et al. 2018), social and cultural groups (Brandes-Aitken et al. 2019), and clinical populations (Burton et al. 2018; Ebert and Kohnert 2011; Gallardo-Moreno et al. 2020; Huang-Pollock et al. 2020; Rose et al. 2017; Swaab-Barneveld et al. 2000; Tucha et al. 2009; Vivanti et al. 2017). Of note is how sustained attention abilities change across development (Fortenbaugh et al. 2015). In particular, this ability undergoes significant improvements over the early childhood period (Colombo and Cheatham 2006; Fisher 2019). Although this progression has been well documented using a variety of tasks, this work has largely ignored a key feature of sustained attention\u2014that it can fluctuate from moment to moment over the course of time on a given task (Benitez et al. 2017; Isbell et al. 2018). Understanding the development of sustained attention requires assessing how it is maintained over a prolonged period of time, as well as how the stability of sustained attention changes across individuals and ages (Esterman and Rothlein 2019). In this study, we examine how the\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107. https://doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence10040107 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jintelligence\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 2 of 16\npupillary response can provide a measure of the maintenance of sustained attention from moment to moment over time on task in young children. Measuring the pupillary response has recently become a common tool in psychophysiological research (Laeng et al. 2012; Strauch et al. 2022; Math\u00f4t 2018; Math\u00f4t et al. 2018). Changes in pupil diameter occur automatically, without overt control, making it a method of measurement that can be used across ages and abilities. In adults, changes in pupil size have been linked to alerting, orienting, and executive function networks (Strauch et al. 2022) and have been found to be coupled with arousal, effort, memory, and cognitive control abilities (Just et al. 2003; Laeng et al. 2012). A growing body of work has also linked changes in pupil size to a range of cognitive processes in infants and children, including object processing, learning, memory, predictive processes, and cognitive control (Ackermann et al. 2020; Boersma et al. 1970; Bonmassar et al. 2020; Chatham et al. 2009; Cheng et al. 2019; Eckstein et al. 2017; Hepach and Westermann 2016; Johnson et al. 2014; Karatekin et al. 2007; McGarrigle et al. 2017; Selezneva and Wetzel 2022; Sirois and Brisson 2014; Sirois and Jackson 2012; Zhang et al. 2018; Zhang and Emberson 2020). Relevant to understanding sustained attention, changes in pupil size have been proposed as a psychophysiological marker of a neuromechanism connected to alertness and arousal\u2014the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) system (Aston-Jones and Cohen 2005; Gilzenrat et al. 2010; Rajkowski et al. 1993; Strauch et al. 2022). LC activity can be characterized by the amount of activity at baseline (tonic activity) as well as in response to a task-relevant event (task-evoked activity). During periods of inattentiveness, LC tonic activity is low, LC task-evoked activity is low, and performance on the given task is poor. During periods of focused attention, LC tonic activity is moderate, LC task-evoked activity is high, and performance is high. In contrast, during periods of distractibility, LC tonic activity is high, LC task-evoked activity is low, and performance is poor. As such, the relationship between LC tonic activity and attention is characterized as an inverted-U-shaped relationship. Neural recordings in non-human primates (Joshi et al. 2016; Rajkowski et al. 1993; Varazzani et al. 2015) and neuroimaging studies in human adults (Aln\u00e6s et al. 2014; Murphy et al. 2014) have linked LC activity with the pupillary response (see also Eckstein et al. 2017, for a review), indicating that the two are strongly coupled. Critically, behavioral studies in human adults have linked pupillary responses to moment-to-moment fluctuations in sustained attention (Beatty 1982a, Beatty 1982b; Robison and Unsworth 2019; Unsworth and Robison 2016; Unsworth and Robison 2018; Zhao et al. 2019). Using a psychomotor vigilance task, on each trial, Unsworth and Robison (2016) measured adults\u2019 reaction times to the onset of the target stimulus, task-evoked pupil size changes, indexed as the change in pupil size post target onset, and baseline pupil size, indexed as pupil size prior to the start of a trial. As time on task increased, reaction times increased, demonstrating a vigilance decrement (Dinges and Powell 1985). Importantly, both baseline pupil size and task-evoked pupil size decreased over the course of the task. Further, the pupillary response was linked with different types of self-reported attentional lapses consistent with LC-NE functioning. Compared to high attention states, high arousal but low attention states yielded larger baseline pupil sizes, low arousal and low attention states yielded smaller baseline pupil sizes, and low attention states yielded smaller taskevoked pupil size changes. Thus, baseline pupil size changes seem to be coupled with the LC-NE tonic state, indexing arousal, and task-evoked pupil size changes seem to be coupled with the LC-NE phasic state, indexing alertness or high-intensity attention. In sum, Unsworth and Robison (2016) implicate both arousal and alertness in adults\u2019 momentto-moment sustained attention over time on task. If the pupillary response is linked with fluctuations in sustained attention, then it may be a critical measure for understanding moment-to-moment sustained attention in early childhood. However, no study to date has assessed whether and how the pupillary response is coupled with sustained attention over time on task in young children. A limited set of studies have linked children\u2019s task-evoked pupillary response to mental effort (Boersma et al. 1970; Johnson et al. 2014; Karatekin 2004) and working memory\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 3 of 16\nperformance (Johnson et al. 2014; Cheng et al. 2019). To our knowledge, however, only two studies have provided preliminary evidence that the task-evoked pupillary response may be linked with moment-to-moment sustained attention in infants (Cheng et al. 2019) and older children (Karatekin et al. 2007). Cheng et al. (2019) found that, during a working memory task, the task-evoked pupillary response at encoding was larger for 13-month-old infants who were more accurate at test. The authors concluded that high-intensity focused attention at encoding supports the maintenance of visual information in working memory. Using a target detection task, Karatekin et al. (2007) showed that the task-evoked pupil size decreased over time on task in adults and 10-year-old children, but only adults showed a decrease in baseline pupil size. The authors concluded that the decrease in task-evoked pupil size indicated a waning of alertness, while no change in baseline pupil size in children indicated that arousal was maintained throughout the course of the task. These findings hint at a developmental difference in the mechanisms that support sustained attention in older children and adults. However, several questions remain: (1) is the pupillary response coupled with moment-tomoment sustained attention over time on task in young children? and (2) if so, are changes found in both the baseline and the task-evoked pupillary response? Answering these questions can shed light on how arousal (indexed via the baseline pupillary response) and alertness (indexed via the task-evoked pupillary response) supports moment-to-moment sustained attention over time on task in young children. In the present study, we assessed pupil size changes in 5- to 7-year-old children over time on a psychomotor vigilance task, where children were instructed to press a button when a target stimulus appeared on the screen, with the onset of the target varying randomly across trials (between 1 and 8 s). We measured the reaction time of button presses in response to the onset of the stimulus, as well as the baseline pupillary response (pupil size prior to the onset of the stimulus) and the task-evoked pupillary response (pupil size post onset of the stimulus). If young children\u2019s sustained attention wanes over time, then we should find a vigilance decrement in children\u2019s reaction times. If young children\u2019s pupillary response is coupled with sustained attention, then we should also find that children\u2019s pupillary response shows time-on-task effects. Importantly, by measuring both baseline and task-evoked pupil size changes, we may be able to shed light on the mechanisms behind sustained attention. If both arousal and alertness support the maintenance of sustained attention in young children, then we should find time-on-task effects in both baseline pupil size changes and task-evoked pupil size changes as have been found in adults (Unsworth and Robison 2016)."

Our goal was to administer the study to as many children as possible over a one-year span, with the intention of collecting at least 82 participants so we could detect age-related correlations of at least 0.30 with 80% power. However, data collection ceased during the COVID-19-related closures in March 2020. We were able to collect half of our target sample (N = 41), which meant that our correlation analyses were underpowered. Our final sample included 41 children (M = 6.52 years, SD = 0.77, range 5 to 7.9 years). An additional 4 children were excluded due to failure to complete the vigilance task (2) and failure to follow instructions (2). One child was included in the assessment of reaction times but excluded from the pupillary analyses due to an error in recording the eye data. The final sample was composed of 22 girls, 19 boys, 15 children whose parents indicated they were exposed to a language other than English, and 26 indicating no exposure to a second language. Our sample was racially and ethnically diverse. The racial/ethnic breakdown, as reported by the parent, was the following: White (17), Hispanic/Latino (7),\nJ.

Additionally, 3 children were reported to have a developmental impairment. We opted to include these three children to be most data-inclusive, as they were able to follow the instructions to complete the task (results remain qualitatively the same if these children are excluded). The children and their families were invited to the Learning & Development Lab at Arizona State University (ASU) as part of a larger study on individual differences in cognitive abilities. During the session, in addition to the psychomotor vigilance task, children completed four tasks not reported here: a change-detection working memory task, the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery flanker task (Zelazo et al. 2013), and a cross-situational word-learning task (Benitez et al. 2020).

In addition, stars appeared on the right-hand side of the screen, indicating how many trials they had completed successfully in that block. The task included a practice block as well as at least 3 testing blocks of 10 trials each.\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 5 of 16\nThe task was completed inside a single-walled sound-attenuated booth, with children seated comfortably at a table to which a chinrest was mounted. The table was in front of a height-adjustable ViewSonic LCD monitor (1920 \u00d7 1080), approximately 18 inches from eye level, with the main stimulus being 17 degrees of visual angle in size. The lighting in the booth was set on the same brightness setting (medium) for all children. The brightness at eye level was approximately 285 lux during the task. The children were told that they were going to play a game on the computer called whack-a-mole, during which they would have to catch a mole. At the start of the session, the children were instructed to place their chins on the chinrest. The chinrest was surrounded by paper-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 \u201crocks\u201d in a way that did not interfere with the eye-tracker, and the participants were instructed that they must place their chins on the chinrest during the game so they could \u201chide\u201d from the mole. A researcher stood behind the child during the entire task so they could instruct and monitor the child. A second researcher sat at the control computer outside the booth running the task. The second researcher could hear and see the child and the researcher via a camera. The researcher inside the booth was instructed to signal to the researcher outside the booth to initiate each phase and trial of the task. Once the child was seated and in the chinrest, a 5-point child-friendly calibration procedure was initiated, where a rubber duck was displayed (together with a ringing sound) at the center and 4 corners of the monitor. Children were instructed to look at the duck. The researcher outside the booth pressed a key when the child was looking at the stimulus. The calibration procedure was repeated a second time if needed. After calibration, children completed several practice trials in order to become oriented to the task. Each trial (for practice and test trials) started with a screen instructing participants to place one hand on the button response and the other hand next to the response box placed on the table in front of them (see \u201cpreparation\u201d in Figure 1). When the research assistant ensured the child\u2019s hands were in position and the child was attentive to the screen, they signaled to the outside researcher to initiate the trial. During the practice trials, the researcher provided feedback to children to try and press the button as fast as possible with the same hand, to maintain their chin on the chinrest, and to place their hands at the start position at the start of each trial. If the child failed to press the button after 5 s, the trial would end, and a red X would appear\u2014these trials would be counted as incorrect. Children were presented with 5 practice trials. If a child was incorrect on 1 or more practice trials, they would restart the practice phase. Only after children completed all 5 practice trials correctly did children move on to the test trials. In this way, we emphasized to children to make as few errors as possible during the task. The test trials were presented in blocks of 10 trials each. All children were asked to complete at least three blocks of 10 trials correctly. Children were encouraged to complete more trials, up to 6 blocks. However, these additional trials were not analyzed since children varied with respect to how many trials they completed beyond the 3 blocks required. Thus, only the first 30 correct test trials were analyzed for all children. Once children completed a block, they were given a sticker to place on a sticker sheet, and the next block started. If children were incorrect on a trial, that trial was discarded, and a new trial was presented to replace it. This ensured that children completed 10 correct trials for each block. No RT or eye data were collected on incorrect trials (these composed only 0.04% of the total data). The entire task lasted about 6 min. After completion of all the tasks, parents completed a demographic questionnaire for their child. The entire session lasted approximately 45 min."

We used the pupil diameter of the right eye for our analyses consistent with prior research (Unsworth and Robison 2016; left and right pupil sizes were highly correlated, r = 0.82, p = < .001; the results were qualitatively the same when the left eye was used). Only valid pupil data were included in the analyses (invalid pupil data due\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 6 of 16\nto missing data or blinks were excluded). From the pupil data, we extracted two measures. First, we measured the baseline pupil diameter by averaging the pupil values over the first second of the wait screen. We picked the first second of the wait screen given that the length of the wait screen varied randomly between 1 and 8 s. Second, we computed a task-evoked pupillary response by examining changes in pupil diameter in response to the appearance of the mole. To do so, for each trial, we calculated the pupil size change by subtracting the average pupil size over the 2000 ms time window post-target onset from the average pupil size over the 500 ms time window before target onset, consistent with prior research (Unsworth and Robison 2016)."

Our results provide strong evidence for a link between the task-evoked pupillary response and waning sustained attention over time on tasks in young c ildren.\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 11 of 16\nThe decrease in the task-evoked pupillary response over time on task is consistent with prior studies in adults showing that the task-evoked pupillary response is largest in moments of focused attention states, compared with off-task attention states (Unsworth and Robison 2016) and with findings that the task-evoked pupillary response decreases as vigilance decreases in both adults and older children (Karatekin et al. 2007). Critically, our results yield some insights into the mechanisms that may underlie the maintenance of sustained attention in young children. In particular, if the pupillary response is a psychophysiological marker of LC-NE activity, as previous studies have proposed (Aln\u00e6s et al. 2014; Aston-Jones and Cohen 2005; Gilzenrat et al. 2010; Joshi et al. 2016; Murphy et al. 2014; Rajkowski et al. 1993; Varazzani et al. 2015), then the current results show that over the course of the task, as children\u2019s performance deteriorated, their task-evoked pupillary response decreased, suggesting that alertness waned. However, the lack of change in baseline pupil diameter indicates that arousal was maintained over the course of the task. These findings are in line with the only other study we know of that has tested the link between older children\u2019s sustained attention and both baseline and task-evoked pupillary responses (Karatekin et al. 2007). Together, these results point to the possibility that the mechanism behind maintaining sustained attention in children, at least under the conditions tested here, may be more heavily dependent on the ability to maintain alertness than the ability to maintain optimal levels of arousal. It is important to note that the mechanisms recruited for sustaining attention over time on a task may depend on the particulars of the task itself. If baseline pupil size changes are an index of LC tonic activity and arousal, it is quite possible that we may see changes in this measure in young children if the task was longer, more difficult, or if the reward for performance was manipulated. Indeed, children were continuously motivated to perform well on the task by being awarded a star on the screen for every trial completed and stickers for every block completed. Children were also provided with auditory feedback (a laughing mole) with every successful response. Given that previous research has found that reward improves sustained attention in adults (Massar et al. 2016), the stars, stickers, and laughing mole may have allowed children to maintain optimal levels of arousal throughout the task. Further, although children were allowed to re-set before the start of the next test trial, we cannot discard the possibility that feedback from the prior trial could have impacted the baseline pupillary response on the next trial. In future studies, it will be important to manipulate the time on task, difficulty, and presence of reward to better understand how these influence baseline and task-evoked measures of the pupillary response under different conditions in young children. We also have to acknowledge that the discrepancy in the time-on-task effects between the task-evoked pupillary response and the baseline pupillary response may not necessarily reflect different mechanisms of attention and instead may reflect that these two pupillary markers are differentially sensitive to the demands of the task. Previous research has consistently shown that the task-evoked pupillary response decreases over time on task (Beatty 1982a, Beatty 1982b; Robison and Unsworth 2019; Unsworth and Robison 2016; Unsworth and Robison 2018; Zhao et al. 2019). However, time-on-task effects on the baseline pupillary response have been less consistent: in adults, although several studies have shown effects of time-on-task on the baseline pupillary response (Kristjansson et al. 2009; Murphy et al. 2011; Unsworth and Robison 2016; van den Brink et al. 2016), others have shown no effects (Martin et al. 2022; Beatty 1982b). Further, increases and decreases in baseline pupil size changes may each be related to different types of waning attention (Unsworth and Robison 2016). Future work is needed to better understand how the baseline pupillary response is coupled with sustained attention performance, not just in adults but also in young children. We additionally explored how fixations change over the course of the task, and we found that as time on task increased, the distance of children\u2019s fixations from the center (where the main stimulus was presented) increased. This result shows that children\u2019s eyes started to wander away from the target stimulus over the course of the task and\nJ. Intell. 2022, 10, 107 12 of 16\nis consistent with children\u2019s RT performance and the task-evoked pupillary response, indicating that children\u2019s sustained attention waned. However, when accounting for gaze distance from center, we still found a significant effect of trial on the task-evoked pupillary response, demonstrating that children\u2019s wandering eyes did not account for the changes in the task-evoked pupillary response over time on task. Nonetheless, we do have to acknowledge that because eye movements affect the accuracy of pupil measurement, children\u2019s eye movements may have impacted the measurement of the task-evoked pupillary response (Hayes and Petrov 2016; Gagl et al. 2011; Brisson et al. 2013). This issue is not unique to our study; it is difficult for even adults to maintain fixation consistently over the course of a long task. There is yet no strong consensus on best practices for how to account for eye movements when measuring the pupillary response (Math\u00f4t et al. 2018). We suggest here that developing such best practices should take into consideration conditions for testing young children. Although it is clear that sustained attention undergoes dramatic improvements over development, and large increases occur over early childhood (Colombo and Cheatham 2006; Fisher 2019; Fortenbaugh et al. 2015), what is less clear are the mechanisms underlying these changes. What our study demonstrates is that we can leverage pupillometry to understand the psychophysiological drivers of sustained attention, even in a very young sample. Demonstrating this link is the first step in understanding what factors contribute to moment-to-moment shifts in sustained attention. One next step is to understand how these mechanisms change across development. Although our study included a relatively small age span, we found several trends in our correlations between age and our measures even in this short window of development: performance on the vigilance task was better in older children than younger children, the baseline pupillary response was larger in older children than younger children, and the task-evoked pupillary response was smaller in older children than younger children. In future studies with a larger age span, a larger sample size, and an adult comparison, we will be able to measure the pupillary response over time on task across ages to gain insights into how mechanisms of sustained attention change over development. Finally, the pupillary response may be harnessed to understand individual differences in cognitive abilities. Several studies have linked adults\u2019 individual pupillary response in sustained attention tasks with their attentional control, working memory capacity, longterm memory, processing speed, and intelligence (Ahern and Beatty 1979; Coors et al. 2022; Robison and Brewer 2022; Tsukahara et al. 2016; Tsukahara and Engle 2021; but see Coors et al. 2022 and Robison et al. 2022 for failures to replicate the link between intelligence and resting pupil size). A limited set of studies have examined individual differences in the ability to maintain attention over time in early childhood, suggesting that this ability is linked with individual differences in other cognitive abilities. In a sample of 3- to 6-year-old children, Benitez et al. (2017) demonstrated that children who were able to maintain their attention selectively to a specific dimension over time were also children who were able to flexibly switch between dimensions in the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) Task, a measure of cognitive flexibility (Frye et al. 1995). In a different study, Isbell et al. (2018) demonstrated that 3- to 6-year-old children who displayed higher attentional fluctuations, indexed via higher variability in reaction times in a Go/No go task, were also children who performed worse not only on measures of cognitive flexibility (the DCCS task) but also on measures of academic performance (tests of math and reading readiness). If the pupillary response is linked with young children\u2019s sustained attention, as our findings indicate, then it may also predict different domains of cognitive abilities as well as academic performance. This is an important avenue to explore in future research."
