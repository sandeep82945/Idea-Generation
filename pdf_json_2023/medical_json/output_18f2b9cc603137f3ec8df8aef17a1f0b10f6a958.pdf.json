Dietary shifts, however, can result in metabolic alterations and the exposure of new parasites that can impact animal fitness and population survival. Our study focuses on the Asian water monitor lizard (Varanus salvator), one of the largest predators in the Asian wetlands, as a model species to understand the health consequences of living in a human-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We evaluated the effects of dietary diversity on the metabolism of monitor lizards and the impact on the composition of their parasite communities in an oil palm-dominated landscape. Our results showed that (1) rodent-dominated diets were associated with high levels of lipids, proteins and electrolytes, akin to a fast-food-based diet of little representativeness of the full nutritional requirements, but highly available, and (2) lizards feeding on diverse diets hosted more diverse parasite communities, however, at overall lower parasite prevalence. Furthermore, we observed that the effect of diet on lipid concentration differed depending on the size of individual home ranges, suggesting that sedentarism plays an important role in the accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides. Parasite communities were also affected by a homogeneous dietary behaviour, as well as by habitat type. Dietary diversity had a negative effect on both parasite richness and prevalence in plantations, but not in forested areas. Our study indicates that human-dominated landscapes can pose a negative effect on generalist species and hints to the unforeseen health consequences for more vulnerable taxa using the same landscapes. Thus, it highlights the potential role of such a widely distributed generalist as model species to monitor physiological effects in the ecosystem in an oil palm-dominated landscape.\nKey words: animal health, Asian water monitor lizard, blood chemistry, Borneo, diet, oil palm, parasites Editor: Heath MacMillan\nReceived 5 January 2023; Revised 10 July 2023; Editorial Decision 16 July 2023; Accepted 21 July 2023\nCite as: Guerrero-Sanchez S, Frias L, Saimin S, Orozco-terWengel P, Goossens B (2023) The fast-food effect: costs of being a generalist in a humandominated landscape.

            "text": "Agricultural expansion in the tropics has converted most natural landscapes into mosaics of forest and industrialized crops, altering the availability and distribution of food resources for a wide range of wildlife (Oro et al., 2013). While for some, taxa deforestation and land use change can result in resource depletion, for others, anthropogenic changes in the landscapes offer an abundant food source with human-base resources that are both abundant and predictable (McKinney, 2006; Newsome et al., 2014). As a result, many wildlife species have adapted to benefit from these resources, leading to larger populations that are more aggregated and better fed (Prange et al., 2003). Raccoons (Procyon lotor), for example, have been reported to have higher population densities and survival rates in urban and suburban areas in Northern United States and Canada, as well as very low weight loss during winter, compared to those living in more natural environments (Hoffmann, 1979; Rosatte et al., 1991; Prange et al., 2003). Moreover, shifts in intra- and interspecies interactions are more likely to be observed in human-modified landscapes (Ciucci et al., 2020), including an increased risk of human\u2013wildlife contact (Hopkins III et al., 2014), favouring changes in pathogen host range and distribution (Patz et al., 2000; Gillespie and Chapman, 2006; Lafferty et al., 2006; Cardoso et al., 2016; Bonnell et al., 2018).\nIn Asia, one of the largest beneficiaries of anthropogenic food is the Asian water monitor lizard (Varanus salvator), one of the largest predators in the region\u2019s wetlands (Traeholt, 1994; Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2021). The species natural habitat is linked to lowland freshwater, such as mangroves, swamps and wetlands under 1000 m above the sea level (m.a.s.l.; Horn and Gaulke, 2004), where they feed on a large range of animals, such as fish, frogs, invertebrates, birds, small mammals and animal carcasses (Traeholt, 1994; Uyeda, 2009). Nonetheless, monitor lizards are exceptionally persistent in anthropogenic habitats, being particularly abundant in the proximity of farms, households and urban areas (Uyeda, 2009; Karunarathna et al., 2017). High food availability, as well as reduced areas of suitable habitat for the species, has driven lizards inhabiting oil palm habitats to a sedentary behaviour, establishing home ranges that are significantly smaller than those of lizards living in natural forest (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2022). Consequently, these adaptations to agricultural landscapes have induced changes in their ecology and behaviour, altering their physiology through a higher accumulation of blood metabolites and exposure to novel parasite assemblages (Jessop et al., 2012; Smyth et al., 2014).\nDietary shifts induced by human-modified habitats have physiological consequences for wildlife health, as they often provide resources that may vary considerably in terms of quality, energy and nutrient composition from natural diets (Oro et al., 2013). For example, body condition can increase as a result of a higher and predictable intake of calories\n(Kaneko and Maruyama, 2005), or decrease if anthropogenic food is low quality (Liker et al., 2008). Anthropogenic food can boost wildlife body condition and increase immune defences, as shown in lace monitors (Varanus varius) foraging on human subsidies in Australia, where not only provisioned individuals were larger and heavier than nonprovisioned animals, but they also showed lower intensity of blood parasites (Jessop et al., 2012). By being localized, anthropogenic food can also reduce wildlife movement and foraging time (Murray et al., 2015), which could be compared to the accessible and affordable fast food for humans. Just like fast food has consequences to human health (Davis and Carpenter, 2009), shifts to a more homogeneous and highly caloric diet also have physiological implications in animals. Lace monitors feeding on human subsidies have reported higher levels of creatinine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase compared to those feeding on more natural diets (Jessop et al., 2012).\nParasite diversity, on the other hand, is strongly linked to the host dietary behaviour (Lafferty, 1999; Poulin and Morand, 2004). Thielges and Poulin (2016), for example, found that the prey range in birds at the Pacific Coast of the United States and Mexico is positively associated with parasite richness, where birds with broader diets showed a higher parasite richness. Host susceptibility to infection and higher parasite loads can also be the consequence of a poor-quality diet (Ezenwa, 2004). For example, rock iguanas (Cyclura cychlura) supplementary fed with processed food, rich in carbohydrates and sugar, not only presented an altered nutritional status but also showed increased prevalence of hookworm (Knapp et al., 2013). In other species, the induced sedentary behaviour, reflected in the reduction of the individual home range and population aggregation, increases exposure to infected conspecifics, as well as the shedding and accumulation of pathogens into the environment (Becker and Hall, 2014; Gilbert et al., 2016).\nHere, we evaluated the influence of dietary diversity on the physiological responses and exposure to parasites of Asian water monitor lizards in an oil palm-dominated landscape. By providing reliable food resources, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations could boost the body condition of lizards, increase their immune defences and reduce their foraging time, which in turn could reduce parasite fitness by decreasing individual susceptibility to infection and promoting quick recovery (Becker et al., 2015). We hypothesized that the feeding behaviour of plantation lizards was less diverse than that of lizards living in the forest, and that this tendency would be reflected in (1) higher values of biochemical markers associated with shifts in the dietary diversity and (2) a reduction in overall parasite diversity and increased parasite prevalence. Using V. salvator as model species, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the physiological implications of species adaptations to human-dominated landscapes and provide information that can be extrapolated to other more cryptic and vulnerable species.\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /conphys/article/11/1/coad055/7242363 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nFigure 1: Study area in Malaysian Borneo (top left corner).

The floodplain (\u223c30 m.a.s.l.) consists of a complex matrix of different types of forest interspersed with rural settlements and large extensions of oil palm crops along the Kinabatangan River, which, along with oxbow lakes and tributaries, irrigate the landscape either seasonally or permanently (Estes et al., 2012). Along the Kinabatangan River, the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS) expands in a series of patches of protected forest (hereafter referred to as \u201clots\u201d) encroached between the main river and industrial palm oil. Connectivity among these lots, and between lots and other forested areas, is generally poor, often consisting in narrow strips of highly degraded forest, and in the worst cases, completely absent (Ancrenaz et al., 2004; Abram et al., 2014)."

We established two transects in each site and placed one cage trap every 400 m for a total of five traps per transect (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2021). Traps were then opened and baited in the early morning, using chicken entrails, and checked in the early afternoon. Asian water monitor lizards were grouped by habitat (forest/plantation) and site (forest lot/plantation estate), according to where they were trapped. Since monitor lizards, especially those living in the boundaries, can roam in both types of habitats, using OPP as food sources and forested areas as a shelter (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2021), we established a third group for those that were captured in both types of habitats to avoid bias or pseudo-replications. All trapped lizards were tagged with an intradermal transponder (ID-1AA; Trovan LTD, UK).\nEach lizard was weighted, and body length was measured from the tip of the mouth to the cloaca (snout to vent length). We also collected up to 2 ml of blood from the coccygeal vein for the biochemical analysis, which included lipids, proteins and electrolytes. Although it is safe to collect up to 5% of blood in relation to body weight (Jacobson, 1993), to minimize the risk of lesions caused by the venepuncture\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /conphys/article/11/1/coad055/7242363 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\n(i.e. accidental pinch of the caudal nerves or rupture of the vein), we only collected blood from individuals over 3 kg. Due to difficulties in sex determination by physical methods, not all individuals were sexed unequivocally. Frynta et al. (2010) reported that male varanids are three times larger than females. Therefore, by being unable to determine the sex of all individuals, we could not estimate their age range, and we omitted sex and age as independent variables in the analysis."

Regurgitation is a common response mechanism to threatening situations (e.g. being trapped) in reptiles (Greene, 1988), and thus, it was anticipated to happen in most (if not all) of the trapped individuals during the study. The regurgitated content was collected, and food items were identified and classified into taxonomic groups, according to morphological features. The food items recorded in this study only represent what captured individuals ate prior to being captured and are likely informative of local food availability rather than dietary preferences. We used the term \u201cdietary diversity\u201d instead of \u201cprey diversity\u201d to avoid any confusion with individual preferences."

Samples were analysed for a full biochemistry panel in a commercial laboratory (Gribbles Sdn. Bhd., Sandakan, Malaysia). For this study, we selected a set of biochemical elements (hereafter biomarkers) commonly associated with dietary behaviour. Cholesterol (including lowand high-density lipoproteins [LDL-Ch and HDL-Ch, respectively]) and triglycerides are indicators of energy intake, use and storage in an individual. They are also commonly associated with highly caloric food and, together with sedentary behaviour, drivers of cardiovascular diseases (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). Proteins are a significant part of an individual\u2019s metabolism, as they are fundamental for body structure and functionality. Low-quality proteins may be reflected in the ability of an animal to perform its biological functions and make it more vulnerable to both metabolic and infectious diseases (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). Uric acid serves as an indicator of protein metabolism, usually of concern when there is an exceedingly high intake of proteins (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium and chloride, are essential in tissue homeostasis and strongly related to muscular functionality (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). They are also associated with a high consumption of processed food, as they are a main component of artificial flavouring and preservatives (Meyer and Harvey, 2004)."

Differences between sites and habitats were calculated by analysis of their variance. Body condition (BC), i.e. an index that reflects the physiological and nutritional status of an individual (Labocha et al., 2014), was estimated as the linear regression between log-transformed body weight and log-transformed body length (Green, 2001).\nDifferences for each biomarker were assessed with generalized linear models (GLM) using two different categorical variables, i.e. habitat (forest vs. OPP) and sites (3 forest lots and 3 oil palm estates). Later, we grouped the study sites according to the habitat type and evaluated the differences within each group. Each biomarker GLM was set with the corresponding family distribution error. GLM were carried out with the stats v3.6.3 package for R (R Core Team) and validated using the diagnostics for hierarchical regression models (DHARMa, v.0.4.6; Hartig, 2022). Distribution for both biochemical markers and parasite data was assessed using the fitdistrplus v1.1.8 package for R (R Core Team; Delignette-Muller and Dutang, 2015) and is presented in Section 2 of the supplementary material (fit of distribution for the biochemical values, BC, and parasite data by maximum likelihood estimation).\nTo determine if dietary diversity accounted for a significant proportion of the variation between habitats and among sites for each of the biomarkers assessed, generalized estimation equations (GEE) were run by using the geeglm function in geepack v.1.3-1 (Halekoh et al., 2006). Contrary to other GLM that estimate a within-group variance component, GEE models estimate the average response of each group, considering the most suitable between-group correlation structures (Hardin and Hilbe, 2002; Yan and Fine, 2004; Zuur et al., 2009).

A subset of 10 individuals between 15 and 20 kg (presumed adult males) was extracted from the whole sampled population to understand the effect of home range size over the association between dietary diversity and the value of the biochemical markers. Those lizards belonged to a group of 14 individuals tagged with GPS trackers, and which home ranges were defined in a previous study using local convex hull (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2022), and all of them were tested for total cholesterol, nine for proteins and electrolytes and eight for triglycerides and LDL-Ch and HDL-Ch . In this case, GEE models were set with either an independent or exchangeable correlation structure, and like in the analysis mentioned above, a proper distribution error was set for each biomarker. Here, the models were also validated with the Pearson correlation of the residuals.\nParasite richness and prevalence were estimated per site and habitat type, although only prevalence was compared per habitat type and per site using GLM with Poisson distribution errors. Prevalence among habitats and sites was also compared per each one of the parasitic groups with major presence in the study. The effect of dietary diversity and BC on both parasite richness and prevalence was evaluated with GEE models. In the case of prevalence, models were performed with the overall parasite community and, finally, for each one of the parasitic groups with major presence in the study.

We also found significant differences among all the sites for total cholesterol, LDL-Ch, HDL-Ch, total proteins and albumin. However, when we compared sites grouped per type of habitat, only high-density cholesterol levels were different among forested sites, while the rest of the markers did not show significant variations. OPP sites, on the contrary, presented significant differences among them for total cholesterol, LDL-Ch, total proteins and albumin (Table 2, see also Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).\nThe influence of habitat type and home range size The results of the GEE models showed that dietary diversity had a significant negative effect on low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in monitor lizards, but that this effect was stronger in plantation areas (Figure 3b and Table 2. See also Supplementary Table 3). Total proteins, on the other hand, increased with dietary diversity, and the association was stronger in OPP than in forested areas. Triglycerides and potassium showed significantly higher levels associated with low dietary diversity in OPP, but not in forested areas.\nFor those samples with a known home range size, the intensity of the effect of dietary diversity on BC and three fat-related biomarkers showed to be dependent on home range size (Figure 3c and 4, see also Table 2 and Supplementary Table 4). BC decreased with higher dietary diversity in individuals with larger home ranges. However, when home ranges shrank, this correlation gradually shifted tendencies, with BC increasing along with dietary diversity. Reduction of home range size also boosted a negative association between low-density cholesterol dietary diversity. HDL cholesterol and\ntriglycerides were higher in individuals with smaller home ranges and lower dietary diversity, but the intensity and direction of the effect shifted gradually from negative to positive with increasing home range sizes.\nParasite species richness and prevalence Faecal samples were collected from 73 lizards (nForest = 32; nPlantation = 41), and overall parasite prevalence was estimated at 79.4% (n = 58). During our trapping period, conditions surrounding the Kuril estate were inadequate for faecal sample collection, i.e. there was an excess of mud due to continuous rain and flooding, and thus, data from this study site were not included in the analysis. A total of 10 parasite taxonomic groups were identified, corresponding to nematodes (n = 8), cestodes (n = 1) and trematodes (n = 1; Table 3). Nematodes included parasites from the genus Capillaria (42.4%), Strongyloides (17.8%), Trichuris (9.5%), Physaloptera (5.4%) and Ascaris (1.3%), and from the orders Oxyurida (35.6%), Strongylida (26%) and Spirurida (5.4%).\nOut of the 10 taxonomic groups of helminths identified, all of them were found in forest, while only eight were detected in OPPs, where Ascaris spp. and Trematoda were absent. Parasite prevalence, on the other hand, was significantly higher in plantation estates than in forest sites (Table 2). We also found significant differences among sites, where the Hillco estate showed the highest parasite prevalence (83%) among the study sites, followed by the Kopi estate and Lot 5 (80%) and Lot 6 (71.4%). Forest lizards showed significantly higher prevalence of Trichuris spp. (15.6% vs. 4.8% in OPP), spirurids (9.37% vs. 2.44%) and oxyurids (43.8% vs. 29.3%), while plantation lizards had significantly higher prevalence of parasites of the genus Strongyloides spp. (22% vs. 12.5%).

In Southeast Asia, large areas of forest have been converted to extensive agriculture, providing Asian water monitor lizards, and other mesopredators, with habitats where foraging efforts are considerably lower than in natural habitats, and where rewards, represented by abundant sources of animal protein and human subsidies, are significantly higher (Becker et al., 2015; Jennings et al., 2015; Guerrero\u2013 Sanchez et al., 2022). Our study shows that oil palm plantations provide monitor lizards with a lower dietary diversity than the surrounding forest, resulting in consequences to both their physiology and encounter with novel parasites (Jessop et al., 2012; Smyth et al., 2014; Wells et al., 2018). Previous research indicates that the relative abundance of rodents in the Kinabatangan floodplain is not different between forest and the surrounding OPPs (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2022). Nonetheless, in this study, rodents represented the dominant prey group collected from the vomit of plantation lizards, with only a few records from the forest.

However, our results showed the opposite regarding both total and LDL-Ch c, which were significantly higher in forested areas. This could be influenced by the low levels of LDL-Ch we found in the Kuril estate, which also presents the highest species richness in the dietary inventory among oil palm sites.\nThe interaction between two different habitats (natural forest and OPP, in this case) can affect, either positively or negatively, the composition and structure of animal communities, as well as species distribution and behaviour (Potts et al., 2016). For Asian water monitor lizards, variations in prey community structure between edge and interior areas also influence individual movement and population distribution (Jessop et al., 2012). A previous study showed no differences in lizards\u2019 abundance and body size between OPP and forested areas (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2021). However, the distribution of abundance and body size in narrow patches of forest showed a tendency towards the mean values observed in plantation sites, suggesting an influence\nof anthropogenic habitats on adjacent forest, i.e. an edge effect. Here, this edge effect extends to the physiology of the population, where both BC and lipid levels of lizards in Lot 5 are similar to lizards inhabiting the adjacent oil palm estate (Hillco). However, the dietary inventory does not present similarities between these two sites. Hence, the edge effect in this case would not necessarily apply to the distribution of both prey and lizards, but it could be related to the physiology of the prey. An experimental study carried out by Mayntz and Toft (2001), for example, concluded that variations in wolf spiders\u2019 metabolites depended on the nutrient composition of the prey\u2019s diet. The effect of prey\u2019s food on the predator\u2019s nutrient intake is worth considering in future studies.\nFrom an animal\u2019s perspective, physiological biomarkers are a valuable tool to understand environmental changes (Cooke et al., 2013). Not only are they highly sensitive to environmental alterations, but also their variations are often related to fitness components that drive population persistence (Bergman et al., 2019). Lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol are important metabolites derived from the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). As a secondary source of energy, their levels are associated not only with food quality but also with individuals\u2019 activity patterns, where sedentary behaviour can lead to an energy demand\u2013intake imbalance.

OPPs are associated with a decrease in parasite species richness and higher parasite prevalence (a). In contrast, in forested areas, an increase in dietary diversity leads to an increase in both the number of parasite taxonomic groups (richness) and parasite prevalence (b).

Animal and trees\u2019 shape source: Phylopic.org.\neffects of such behaviour on BC and biochemical levels, we incorporated previous information of home range sizes for the same population (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2022), showing that lizards with larger home ranges spend more time roaming between different core areas than those inhabiting OPPs. Our findings suggest that sedentary behaviour, coupled with low diverse diets, specially based on small mammals (i.e. rodents; Kaneko and Maruyama, 2005), leads to higher levels of LDLCh, known to be associated with cardiovascular disorders (Meyer and Harvey, 2004). On the other hand, high values of HDL-Ch, cholesterol, and triglycerides, are associated with a higher dietary diversity in lizards with larger home ranges, and are more likely to be associated with the demand of energy required to constantly roam between core areas. Similarly to the LDL-Ch, these two lipids are associated with energy metabolism but can be metabolized faster when energy demand exceeds the intake.\nThe effects of habitat type on electrolytes, such as potassium and chloride, could be a consequence of the ingestion of processed food, either directly or through the food web (Jessop et al., 2012). Total proteins, on the other hand, seem to increase with dietary diversity, but the effect is more intense in oil palm habitats. As a carnivorous generalist, the diet of\na monitor lizard has a high protein content. However, our findings suggest a stronger correlation in OPP than in forested areas, which could be explained by the biomass intake rather than by the actual dietary diversity. In addition, higher levels of globulin in lizards inhabiting OPP, compared with those living in forest sites, could be an effect likely determined by the higher exposure to pathogens (i.e. parasitic helminths) in oil palm plantations than in forest sites. Overall, our findings regarding home range size highlight the importance of improving both size and quality of forest patches within OPP, such as high conservation value areas, in order to increase prey diversity and promote larger animal mobility (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2022). Not only would these changes in land use management benefit the physiological health of the Asian water monitor lizard population, and other generalist species in the area, but it also has been suggested to benefit the survival of other species such as orangutans (Pongo spp.; Ancrenaz et al., 2021)."

In this study, diets that were more diverse were associated with higher prevalence of trichurids and strongyles, which forest lizards might encounter while foraging in the forest. Less diverse diets, on the other hand, were related to higher prevalence of Strongyloides spp., oxyurids and capillarids, which are parasites prevalent in rodents (Wells et al., 2007; Frias, personal observation) that could have been transmitted trophically to the lizards.\nThe higher presence of invertebrates in the stomach of lizards in forested areas, compared with those in OPP, is consistent with the presence of trematodes and cestodes in natural habitats. However, a highly diverse dietary content also influences the low prevalence of such parasites. Although lizards generally inhabit partially inundated habitats, the presence of two large oxbow lakes in Lot 6 can favour the life cycle of digenean trematodes, which have free-living aquatic stages, and requires specific conditions for successful transmission (Galaktionov and Dobrovolskij, 2003). At the same time, lizards living in aquatic habitats may be more likely to feed on animals that contain trematode infective stages (Combes et al., 1994). We should not discard the presence of a research station in Lot 6, its intense human activity in the area, and its role in the high parasite prevalence, very similar to those found in oil palm estates.\nAnthropogenic habitats can alter host\u2013parasite interactions and lead to either increased or decreased infection risk (Patz et al., 2000; Gillespie and Chapman, 2006; Lafferty et al., 2006; Cardoso et al., 2016; Bonnell et al., 2018). Individuals having diverse parasite communities maintain a healthy balance among parasite populations (Lafferty et al., 2006). But when such balance is disturbed, it leads to the increase of certain parasite groups and negatively impacts the individual fitness and the population survival (Frias and MacIntosh, 2019). By decreasing their foraging activities in the forest, plantation lizards also decrease their encounters with parasites with complex life cycles. Similarly, having rodents as a predictable food source can increase the prevalence of helminths transmitted through prey ingestion in plantation lizards (Lafferty et al., 2006; Dunne et al., 2013; Leung and Koprivnikar, 2019). We also observed a significant association between BC and both parasite richness and intensity of infection in plantation lizards, where smaller lizards hosted fewer parasite species and shed more parasite infective stages into the environment. This observation suggests that homogeneous diets may alter host parasite communities and potentially impact individual fitness (Lafferty et al., 2006; Frias and MacIntosh, 2019).\nThe fast-food effect: the role of dietary diversity and sedentarism on population health Fast-food, as we know it, is usually associated with hypercaloric meals that are quick, convenient and low priced. Long-term consumption of fast-food is also associated with obesity and cardiovascular disorders (Rosenheck, 2008; Alter and Eny, 2005), and the proximity of fast-food restaurants to schools has been linked to obesity in teenagers in the United States (Davis and Carpenter, 2009). Similarly, humandominated landscapes, especially industrial crops and farms, offer neighbouring wildlife abundant food resources that are easily accessible, convenient, and have similar health consequences to animal populations (Murray et al., 2015), hence a fast-food effect. Although the impact of the fast-food effect may not be immediately noticeable for lizards and other reptiles, it could pose a risk for mammals and birds that have adapted to similar landscapes and are more sensitive to physiological changes (Becker et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2016). The Asian water monitor lizard is a widespread, highly adaptable and long-lived species commonly found in human-altered landscapes. These life history traits make it a fitting model species to help us understand the physiological threats posed by changing ecosystems.\nFast-food consumption in humans is a complex health issue that not only involves obesity and cardiovascular disorders but also implies a cascade of social, economic and cultural causes and consequences (Rosenheck, 2008; Davis and Carpenter, 2009). Likewise, the fast-food effect in wildlife involves a complex series of elements that need to be understood by observing different aspects of wildlife ecology (i.e. prey abundance and distribution, human subsidies, demography, distribution, activity patterns of target species, etc.) and not only by comparing populations in different habitats. Aside from dietary diversity and movement ranges, other important elements to consider are biomass intake, including the nutritional properties of prey, and parasites present in prey communities. While the first element would offer a more complete picture of how energy intake is used and metabolized by predators, a wider knowledge of parasite communities infecting prey would help us understand transmission pathways through food webs (Lafferty et al., 2006). Additional demographic and longitudinal information would be important complements to evaluate the impact of the fastfood effect on individual fitness.\nThe metabolic responses of lizards and the changes in parasite community composition, influenced by a diet derived from landscape alterations, suggest a decreased physiological status and fitness in the wildlife community in the area. The abundance and high catchability rate of Asian water monitor lizards (Guerrero-Sanchez et al., 2021) allowed us to generate more data than it would have been possible by targeting other wildlife species living in similar habitats,\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /conphys/article/11/1/coad055/7242363 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nwhich are more cryptic or have a lower catchability rate, such as leopard cats (P. bengalensis), civets (Viverra tangalunga and Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), macaques (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca. nemestrina), Bornean sun bears (Helarctos malayanus) and bearded pigs (Sus barbatus), among others. Such information provides a hint towards the hidden consequences that living in disturbed ecosystems can have for other species as well.\nFinally, this study presents the most robust data on blood biochemistry for the Asian water monitor lizard in the wild. Although none of the sampled individuals showed signs of being unhealthy, it remains to be explored whether these metabolite levels lay or not within healthy ranges for populations living in the forest and in plantations. To our knowledge, there is no reference database that allows for an accurate comparison of our results. The International Species Information System (https://www.species360.org/) is the most comprehensive biometric database for animal information; however, it is mostly composed of samples from captive animals with different dietary schemes. Hence, we recommend caution when using the information presented here as reference for the species."
