    "abstractText": "With the increasing complexity of robot systems, it is necessary to simulate them before deployment. To do this, a model of the robot\u2019s kinematics or dynamics is required. One of the most commonly used formats for modeling robots is the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). The goal of this article is to understand how URDF is currently used, what challenges people face when working with it, and how the community sees the future of URDF. The outcome can potentially be used to guide future research. This article presents the results from a survey based on 510 anonymous responses from robotic developers of different backgrounds and levels of experience. We find that 96.8% of the participants have simulated robots before, and of them 95.5% had used URDF. We identify a number of challenges and limitations that complicate the use of URDF, such as the inability to model parallel linkages and closed-chain systems, no real standard, lack of documentation, and a limited number of dynamic parameters to model the robot. Future perspectives for URDF are also determined, where 53.5% believe URDF will be more commonly used in the future, 12.2% believe other standards or tools will make URDF obsolete, and 34.4% are not sure what the future of URDF will be. Most participants agree that there is a need for better tooling to ensure URDF\u2019s future use.",

INTRODUCTION\nSimulating robots has become an integrated part of robot system development [1], [2], as it reduces the cost by allowing experimentation with parameters and environments in advance of committing to the physical hardware. A commonly used method to represent a robot\u2019s geometry and physical appearance is the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) [3]. It was introduced with the Robot Operating System (ROS) in 2009 as a format to describe the kinematics, geometries, and dynamics of robots in a universal manner [4].\nA URDF file is an XML-based file with an extension of .urdf, that can be imported and exported by different tools for visualization or simulation purposes. It describes robot links (rigid bodies) and the joints that connect the links using a tree structure.\nThe use of URDFs has increased over the years, as evidenced by the trend in Google queries for the term \u2018URDF\u2019, see Fig. 1. Although URDF is widely used, it\nD. Tola is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark (e-mail: dt@ece.au.dk).\nP.

We would like to thank our colleagues for the detailed feedback on the survey, and particularly Cla\u0301udio Gomes for helping with both revision of the questions and distribution of the survey. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Aarhus University with the approval number TECH-2022-013.\nhas inherent issues which have been made clear by multiple roboticists through online forums such as ROS Discourse [5] (posts from 2016-2022), GitHub repositories [6] (posted in 2015), and Google groups [7] (posted in 2015). Additionally, the first ROSCast (in 2016) at MetroRobots.com discussed some of the underlying issues of URDF and potential future directions [8]. At the time of writing (February 2023) many of the challenges with URDF, that were described since 2015, still persist. Over time, see Fig. 2, other open-source object description formats have been developed such as the Simulation Description Format (SDF) [9], Universal Scene Description (USD) [10], and MuJoCo Modeling XML File (MJCF) [11].\nWith various formats emerging, it is necessary to understand the current state of URDF and its potential future directions. We conducted an anonymous survey on the experience of roboticists with URDF, where we asked about the development of URDF, its limitations, and desired improvements. The results of this survey can be used to direct\nar X\niv :2\n30 2.\n13 44\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n2 M\nar 2\n02 3\nfuture research on URDF and robot description formats.

The visual representation can be defined using basic 3D shapes such as boxes and cylinders or using 3D polygon meshes that typically consist of connected triangles defining the shape of the object. Figure 3 shows two examples of robotic arms modeled with URDF, the left one using basic 3D shapes, and the right one using 3D polygon meshes."

            "text": "URDF is a stand-alone file format that includes relevant modeling details of a robot. It was initially introduced with ROS but has since been adopted by tools both within and outside of the ROS ecosystem. Listing 1 illustrates how a link and a joint of a robot can be modeled using URDF.\n1 <link name=\"base link\"> 2 <visual> 3 <origin xyz=\"0 0 0.25\"/> 4 <geometry> 5 <cylinder length=\"0.05\" radius=\"0.1\"/> 6 </geometry> 7 </visual> 8 </link>\n9 ... 10 <joint name=\"joint 1\" type=\"continuous\"> 11 <parent link=\"base link\" /> 12 <child link=\"link 1\" /> 13 <axis xyz=\"0 0 1\" /> 14 <origin xyz=\"0 0 0.05\"/> 15 </joint>\nListing 1: Parts of a URDF file for the robotic arm shown on the left in Fig. 3.\n1) Links: are rigid bodies of the robot that can be connected using joints. The base link, on lines 1-8 in Listing 1, represents the fixed base of the robot which is visualized as a cylinder, the upright gray cylinder shown in Fig. 3 (left robot). Further information on link properties can be found in the ROS Wiki page [12]. Note, that only links of rigid bodies can be represented using URDF, deformable bodies cannot.\n2) Joints: connect two links, a parent and child link. The parent link is closer to the robot base, and the child link is closer to the tool tip. The joint, on lines 10-15 in Listing 1, connects the base link with another link, link 1. These two links can be seen on the left robot in Fig. 3, in which the bottom light gray cylindrical link is the parent link, and the long vertical dark gray cylindrical link is the child link. This joint is continuous, meaning it is revolute with no motion limits. Additional joint properties can be found in the ROS Wiki page [13].\nB. Xacro\nXacro is a macro language for XML that is used to construct URDF files [14] and the xacro preprocessor is part of the ROS ecosystem. It provides tags that can be used to configure URDF files based on the application, to reduce redundancy and improve the maintainability of the models. These tags are defined in a URDF-based xacro file with the extension (.xacro). The xacro preprocessor is an executable used to generate URDF files by interpreting the xacro tags and using input values. The preprocessor allows combining multiple xacro files, which is especially beneficial when dealing with complex robotic structures [15]."

This structure of starting with demographic questions was adapted from another survey on simulation for testing robots [2]. We used the online tool SurveyXact [16] to conduct the survey and collect data. To avoid asking irrelevant questions, the survey was structured with different paths depending on the participant responses, resulting in varying numbers of responses for different questions.

In total, 689 participants took the survey, where 515 of them fully completed the survey and the remaining partially completed it. Out of the 515 responses, 5 did not give their consent therefore ending the survey, leaving 510 completed responses which this article is based on. In our recruitment emails and posts, we described that we are conducting a survey on robot simulation and URDF. As URDF was directly stated in the recruitment description, we can assume that most participants have experience with or knowledge of the format.\nThe experience of the participants and the organizations where they have simulated robots or worked with URDF are presented in Table I, where 13/510 participants had no experience with this. In total 16/510 participants had never simulated a robot before (based on answers to D1 and S1). The majority of the participants have heard of URDF (477/497) and used it (472/477). The experience of the participants on URDF is presented in Table II. Participants reported different levels of experience with simulation and URDFs, within different sizes and types of organizations. We can claim that the sample size (510) and the participants\u2019 background is diverse ensuring that the study is not limited to one type of population, but there is a potential bias towards people in academia (82%) compared to industry (52%)."

Specifically, we used in vivo coding as the phrases defining the topics are taken directly from terms used by the participants themselves [17].

Position bias can occur depending on the order of the choices, and to reduce this we have ordered the choices alphabetically. Forcedchoice bias occurs when participants do not agree with any of the choices, but are forced to choose one of the options to continue the survey. To reduce this, we have in many questions allowed participants to select \u201cOther\u201d and describe their answer using text, allowing them to provide information based on their subjective experience/opinion. A bias may also occur when allowing participants to answer both via multiple-choice and text, as many participants want to limit the time spent on a question, and therefore may choose to skip providing additional information using the text option.\nAdding further comments or notes was possible at the end of the survey. Some of these comments can be found in the appendix in Section II, and pointed out potential biases in the formulation of the questions, where:\n\u2022 Three reported that S10 is limiting and induces a bias (participants A, B, and C). Question 10 asks the participants how they have used URDF, with the possibility to choose only one of the choices: \u2018Always in combination with ROS\u2019, \u2018Always in combination with ROS, but would prefer not to require ROS\u2019, or \u2018Without ROS\u2019. We agree with the participants\u2019 statements and therefore chose to limit the conclusions drawn from these results. \u2022 One reported S16 is leading by using the word painful and makes it clear that we are looking for a specific result (participant D). The question is open-ended and goes as follows \u2018What would you say is the most painful part of creating/modifying a URDF model?\u2019. One of our motivations for creating this survey is a result of our experience with the workflow of creating URDFs, which we believe is painful, and is unfortunately made clear in the question potentially inducing a bias. \u2022 One reported S18 as biased, as it seemed we were asking which of the following improvements should we implement first (participant A). This does not reflect the truth behind the question and its choices. The\nExternal validity describes how well the results can be generalized [19]. The threat to external validity in this survey is reduced with a large number of participants (>500), their various organizational backgrounds, and differing years of experience, see Table I and Table II.\nConstruct validity is related to generalization of results with focus on correctly labeling results by making inferences based on observations. As we have categorized the responses to open-ended questions ourselves, there is a potential threat to the construct validity in the results. Conclusion validity concerns defining the relationship between variables in the data and whether or not the conclusion is reasonable. As we have compared variables between responses from different questions, there is a potential that the conclusions we have made are not entirely reasonable. To mitigate these threats, we have shared the preliminary findings of the survey with people from the community through the same media used for recruitment.\nTo promote further research we share our recruitment materials, questionnaire, and additional results at the URL1."

One of the participants that had not previously used\n1github.com/Daniella1/urdf_survey_material\nURDF stated it was too difficult, while another stated it was due to the limitations of representing deformable bodies.\nThe software tools used by participants to simulate robots (S2, 494 responses) are shown in Fig. 4, where Gazebo was the most used tool (83%), followed by RViz (78%). RViz is part of the ROS ecosystem which is provided by the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) [20]. The foundation also provides Gazebo, which is easily integrated to work with the ROS ecosystem. The least-used tool is FlexSim which less than 1% of the participants have used. Of the participants, 21% stated they use other tools for simulating robots, and the most popular answers among them were PyBullet (17%), NVIDIA Omniverse consisting of Isaac Sim and Gym (14%), MuJoCo (11%), manufacturerspecific tools such as ABB studio or URSim (9%), and Drake (7%). Manufacturer-specific tools do not typically support URDF, as they provide models of their own robots, making it difficult to simulate a complete application with components from other manufacturers or custom robots."

            "text": "Application domains (S7, 472 responses): URDF has been used in a variety of application domains, including Manufacturing (46%), Transportation (24%), Agriculture (14%), Medical (12%), Cleaning (8%), Defense (6%), and\nMarine (6%). Additionally, 34% of respondents stated they used URDF in other domains, with 28% of the 34% using them in Academia, 7% in Service robots (e.g. for household, retail, healthcare), 6% in Logistics or Warehouses, 6% in Construction robots, and 5% use URDF in Mining.\nManufacturers (S8, 472 responses): Of the robots most commonly used with URDF, the manufacturers are Universal Robots (54%), Kuka (37%), Franka Emika (26%), Robotiq (24%), ABB (21%), Clearpath Robotics (21%), Kinova Robotics (15%), Willow Garage (14%), Fanuc (10%), Boston Dynamics (9%), and Yaskawa Motoman Robotics (6%). In addition, 40% of the participants stated they use URDFs of other manufacturers, with 31% stating they have used URDF for self-made/custom robots, and 8% stating the robot URDFs they use are not of any manufacturer. The 8% that did not belong to a manufacturer can also be classified as custom robots, resulting in a total of 39%.\nRobot types (S9, 472 responses): The types of robots modeled in URDF are shown in Fig. 5. Of these, single robotic arms were the most commonly modeled (81%), while delta robots were the least modeled (4%). Other types of robots were used by 6% of the participants, 14% of whom modeled underwater vehicles. The low percentage of delta robots modeled with URDF can potentially be related to the limitations of URDF not supporting parallel linkages or closed-chain systems.\nResponses to multiple questions provide consistent information. The fact that URDFs from Universal Robots (54%) and Kuka (37%) are most commonly used, and the main types being single robotic arms (81%) and mobile robots (64%), implies that these robots are commonly used in the dominant application for URDF which is manufacturing (46%).\nURDF and ROS (S10, 472 responses): Looking at the use of URDF and ROS, 66% stated always using URDF in combination with ROS, 18% always with ROS but would prefer not to require ROS, and 16% without ROS. As described earlier in Section III, this question was biased as\nthe users could not choose with and without ROS. We can only conclude that URDF is commonly used with ROS, by the large number of responses to this (66%), but also by looking at the high usage of simulation tools compatible with ROS (Gazebo and RViz). We can also state that a number of the participants prefer URDF\u2019s independence from ROS, but we cannot rely on the percentage here, as the question is leading and could affect the responses."

            "text": "Tools to create URDF (S11, 441 responses): Tools the respondents were aware of are xacro (82%), SolidWorks URDF exporter (57%), Fusion2URDF (17%), OnShape to URDF exporter (12%), the Blender extension Phobos (12%), and PTC Creo to URDF exporter (4%). Additionally, 90% have used xacro to generate URDFs (S12, 361 responses).\nURDF and 3D polygon meshes (S13, 472 responses): URDF can be used with basic shapes, such as boxes and cylinders, or with 3D polygon meshes that visualize the robot, see Fig. 3. Most of the participants (93%) have used URDF with 3D polygon meshes.\nMethods to obtain URDF (S14, 439 responses): Of the participants that had used URDF with 3D geometrical meshes, 67% stated they developed the URDF by hand, 61% obtained the URDF from a CAD tool, 59% from a ROS package, 47% from the website of the robot manufacturer, and 20% from a simulation tool. It is important to note that this question was asked with the possibility to answer multiple options, and therefore if a participant has developed a URDF by hand, they may have also used a CAD tool for aligning or working with the meshes. Furthermore, it is possible that some participants have obtained a URDF and subsequently modified it, therefore choosing the option \u201cdeveloping the URDF by hand\u201d.\nMost robots in ROS packages are described using xacro. The results from the survey showed that 261 participants have used ROS packages, 313 have used xacro, and in total 203 have both obtained URDFs from ROS packages and at some point in their work used xacro. As most ROS packages contain xacro files that need to be processed with the xacro preprocessor, we would assume that the number of participants that have obtained URDFs from ROS packages would be similar to the number of participants that have used xacro before. The fact that only 203/261 have obtained URDFs from ROS packages and also used xacro before shows a discrepancy in our expectations. This may indicate that either many ROS packages contain URDF files that do not need to be preprocessed with xacro, or a misunderstanding by the participants of what a ROS package is. Another interesting fact about the results is the excessive use of xacro, where 313/361 respondents stated they have used xacro before. This indicates that it is a useful tool, but similarly to URDF, it has a number of issues [15].\nDifficulty rating of creating/modifying URDFs (S15, 439 responses): The participants that have created/modified URDFs rated the difficulty of this, of whom the majority (57%) rated it as medium, 32% experienced it as difficult,\n7% experienced it as easy, 1% answered \u201cDo not know\u201d, and 3% stated they have no experience with this.\nFurthermore, one of the participants stated \u201cWe have a coffee mug in the lab that says, \u2018DO NOT CHANGE THE URDF!\u2019\u201d, anecdotally illustrating the perceived complexity of modifying URDFs.\nChallenges with creating/modifying URDFs (S16, 278 responses): Of the respondents, that have created/modified URDFs, the most painful parts of the process were setting up the poses and meshes of the robot (21.2%), the lack of tooling making it difficult to debug the URDF (18.6%), and adjusting dynamic and kinematic parameters to be accurate (9.0%). The full overview of the categories is shown in Table VI in the appendix."

In addition, 10% of the participants experienced other challenges presented in Table VII in the appendix.\nThe most common challenges found in the survey from responses to various questions are summarized in Table III.\nImprovements (S18, 461 responses): The main improvements chosen by the participants are better tools for combining and manipulating URDF files (70%), easier methods or tools to create URDF files (69%), better tools for validating URDF files (65%), better documentation (56%), a versioned standard (i.e., URDF v1.0, URDF v1.1, etc.) (35%), and standardized metadata like originator, date, version, etc. A number of the participants suggested improvements which are categorized in Table VIII in the appendix, with the key points being a clear demand for better tooling for creating, combining and manipulating, and validating URDFs.\nFuture directions (S19, 477 responses): Of the respondents, 53% believed that URDF will be more commonly used in the future with the main arguments being that URDF is the de-facto standard in ROS, and as a lot of tools in ROS\nrely on it, it would be too difficult to replace URDF with a new format. 34% were not sure of URDF\u2019s future use, and 12% did not believe it would be used in the future. Their main arguments were that URDF is too limited and instead other formats that tackle these limitations will take over. More details on these elaborations are presented in Table IX, Table X, and Table XI in the appendix.\nThe main benefits of URDF perceived by the respondents are summarized in Table IV."

It is clear that most participants that rate themselves as intermediate have between 1-5 years of experience with URDF, whilst very few with less than a year of experience rate themselves as experts, suggesting the competence self-ratings are reasonable.\nFigure 8 shows the participants\u2019 future predictions based on self-rated competences with URDF. The results imply there is no significant correlation between the competences of the participants and their future predictions for URDF.\nFigure 9 shows the participants\u2019 perceived difficulty of creating/modifying URDFs based on their self-rated com-\npetences with URDF. The results imply that the majority of the participants experienced creating/modifying URDFs as of medium difficulty, regardless of their self-rated competence with URDF. There is a clear pattern within the beginner and experts groups. There are fewest beginners in the easy column, with more in medium, and the most in difficult, whilst for the experts the rating is the opposite, i.e., there are fewest experts in the difficult column. This may indicate, as some of the participants have mentioned themselves, that the learning curve of working with URDF is steep, and with more experience the easier it becomes to work with URDF.\nOf the participants that found it difficult to create/modify URDFs, 74% found it difficult to create a URDF (as expected), and 60% had issues importing URDFs into simulation tools, see Fig. 10. Issues with URDF not supporting parallel linkages were experienced by 50% of the participants that rated the process of creating/modifying URDF as easy, whilst only 3% of them had issues with creating URDFs. These results can be associated with the results in Fig. 9, where the majority of the URDF experts rated the process of creating/modifying the file as easy, indicating the learning curve of working with URDF is steep. This could potentially be a symptom of a lack of documentation.\nOf the participants that do not believe URDF will be used in the future, 45% of them have had difficulties importing\nthe URDF into simulation tools, and 40% have had difficulties creating a URDF, as shown in Fig. 11. Although those numbers are high, there is also a high percentage of participants that believe URDF will be used in the future and have encountered the same challenges, indicating there is no specific challenge that has affected the opinion of the participants."

            "heading": "A. Summary",
            "text": "1) Q1: Who is using URDF?: URDF has mainly been used in academic (82%) and industrial (53%) organizations. The majority of the users (62%) have 1-5 years of experience, and have used URDF within the last month (67%) of taking the survey (conducted December 2022). More than 66% of the participants have used URDF in combination with ROS while others have used it without ROS, showing the format is used both within and outside of the ROS ecosystem.\n2) Q2: What is URDF being used for?: Manufacturing (46%) and Transportation (24%) are the dominating application domains for URDF\u2019s use. The most common robot types modeled with URDF are single robotic arms (81%) and mobile robots (64%), which are also the main types of\nrobots used in manufacturing. Most of the participants use URDF with 3D visualizations (93%).\n3) Q3: What are the limitations of URDF?: Most of the respondents had created URDFs by hand, and this is where the main limitations were found. When creating a URDF multiple tools are needed, such as CAD software for modifying the meshes, a program to write the XML structure, and additional software to visualize and test the URDF. Participants described that the debugging process was tedious; every time a parameter in the URDF file was tweaked, the file was loaded into the visualization software (again) and tested. Additionally, difficulties when importing URDFs into simulation tools, and the inability to model parallel linkages or closed-chain systems were reported.\nThe main improvements for URDF, desired by the participants, are better tools for creating, manipulating, and validating URDFs. Improved documentation to decrease the steep learning curve of URDF was also high on the list of desired improvements for URDF.\n4) Q4: What is the future of URDF?: The majority (53%) of the participants believed that URDF will be used in the future. Their main argument being that URDF is the de-facto standard in ROS where many tools rely on it to function, making it too difficult to replace URDF with another format. The remaining participants were either not sure of or did not\nbelieve in URDF\u2019s future use. Their reasoning was primarily based on the current limitations of URDF. They suspect that another format, which addresses these limitations, will take over in the future."

            "heading": "B. Discussion",
            "text": "1) Other formats: Many of the participants mentioned other formats such as SDF [9], USD [10], and MJCF [11]. A few also mentioned they are working on new formats that they believe will replace URDF. With the existing and emerging formats that can be used for modeling robots, it can be overwhelming for newcomers in robot modeling to determine which format to use. It may be beneficial to create an overview of the capabilities and limitations of the different formats, to allow users to easily determine which format is most suitable for their needs.\n2) XML: Contrasting opinions were revealed on using XML for describing URDF files. Some saw an advantage in its human-readability and simplicity, whilst others believed that XML is outdated and the current structure of the format contains a lot of boiler-plate code.\n3) Tackling challenges: One of the main challenges is having difficulties with importing URDFs into simulation tools. Although, we have not analyzed the causes of this, we suggest creating guidelines for tools to support URDF. These guidelines would potentially make it easier for simulation tools to implement support for URDF, but also provide a consistent user interface across simulation tools, especially if the same function names are used.\nAnother interesting challenge is that participants could not find URDFs of the specific versions of the robots they were using. This could potentially be tackled by creating a URDF database in which it would be possible for users to share URDFs, rate each other\u2019s URDFs, describe issues/limitations, and update their URDF with improved versions."

            "text": "In this article, we conducted a survey of 510 robotics developers to determine the use of URDF, its current challenges, desired improvements, and future outlooks of URDF by the robotics community. We found that most of the participants that have simulated a robot before have also used URDF. Additionally, the majority had used URDF within the last month when taking the survey (conducted December 2022). The majority of the participants believed that URDF will be more commonly used in the future, especially if it is improved. We identified challenges and limitations of the format, that the participants would like to be tackled or improved. Furthermore, we analyzed and discussed results and provided suggestions on how some challenges can be tackled. The results of this survey can be used as guidelines for future research."
