INTRODUCTION\nThe capillary waves are commonly observed in the ocean swell on the length scale of a few centimeters. They often appear as a result of breaking of steep gravity waves [9] or other processes related to water wave turbulence, such as the formation of direct energy cascade [4, 8]. When wind blows on the ocean surface, or a breaking ocean wave is observed, a spray of droplets often is formed when tiny droplets detach from the main body of water.\nLeaving aside the ballistic motion induced by gravity, the internal motion of a droplet is dominated by the kinetic energy entrapped in its body, and the surface tension forces acting upon its free surface. The perfect sphere is a minimizer of the surface area of a fluid droplet and hence potential energy due to surface tension attains its minimum value in a spherical droplet. Similarly, in a 2D fluid the minimal perimeter is attained by a disc-shaped droplet. Once detached from the bulk of the fluid, it carries away angular momentum from the fluid body as a part of its kinetic energy. Both quantities are conserved in time and contribute to its dynamics which can be quite complicated, and is described by the Euler equations with a free boundary. When the angular momentum carried by a droplet is too large to be balanced by surface tension, the droplet may break further into even smaller droplets, and a cascade of multiple breaking droplets observed on a large scale may be contributing to generation of water spray at the crests of steep ocean waves. Some environmental processes, like the gas exchange at the air\u2013water interface, can be greatly enhanced by an effective increase of surface area through droplet generation. It is our aim to understand the\n2 internal dynamics of droplets, and the processes that may result in their breaking.\nIn the present work, we consider nonlinear traveling waves on the free surface of a droplet of radius R induced by a balance of angular momentum and the forces of surface tension. We follow the conformal variables approach originally introduced by Stokes in [14] and later extended to time-dependent problem in [11, 15]. A framework for studying flows in closed domains (like a fluid blob) as well as on the exterior of an air bubble submerged in a 2D ideal fluid has been developed in [3]. Our approach is based on the conformal variables technique for bounded domains described in [6].\nWe find families of nonlinear traveling waves that bifurcate from a disc shaped droplet and can be parameterized by an integer number of wavelengths per perimeter of a droplet (the number of lobes, k), and the wave steepness. The solutions are found numerically in terms of Fourier series satisfying pseudo\u2013differential nonlinear eigenvalue problem that is qualitatively similar to the Babenko equation for Stokes waves in 2D [1] and can be solved by similar numerical techniques [13, 17].\nGiven wave length \u03bb, we recover the family of Crapper wave solutions [2, 10] in the limit \u03bb\u226a R (k \u2192 \u221e). This limit is equivalent to traveling capillary waves in infinite depth fluid. Oscillations of 3D droplets have been a subject of interest since the works of Rayleigh [12], and have been studied both experimentally and analytically, see e.g. [16]. It is yet unclear whether there is a relation between dynamics of 2D and 3D droplets.\nThe text is organized as follows. In the first three sections we describe the motion integrals relevant to droplet mechanics, the conformal variables approach and the equation describing a nonlinear traveling wave (10). Section IV describes the series solution for infinitesimal waves which are employed as the initial guess in the Newton-Conjugate-Residual method [13, 17] in section V. The main results and conclusions are described in section VII."

It is often more convenient to implement iterations for a real unknown function, and we may recall that the components of the conformal map are not independent and are related via the Hilbert transform, i.e. since z = x + iy and \u03b4z = \u03b4x+ i\u03b4y, then\nx = \u2212H\u0302y, \u03b4x = \u2212H\u0302 [\u03b4y] ,\nand the linearized equation (19) is equivalent to an auxiliary real equation for one real unknown function \u03b4y given by\n\u2212 2\u03b2\u03b4yu +\u2126 2\n(\n\u2212 1\n2 (H\u0302\u03b4y)k\u0302|z|2 \u2212 (H\u0302y)k\u0302((H\u0302y)(H\u0302\u03b4y) + y\u03b4y)\u2212 H\u0302\n[\n1 2 \u03b4yk\u0302|z|2 + yk\u0302((H\u0302y)(H\u0302\u03b4y) + y\u03b4y)\n])\n+ \u03c3\u2202u\n(\n\u2212 yu |zu|3 (\u2212(H\u0302y)u\u03b4yu + yu(H\u0302\u03b4y)u)\u2212 H\u0302\n[\n\u2212 (H\u0302y)u |zu|3 ((H\u0302y)u\u03b4yu \u2212 yu(H\u0302\u03b4y)u)\n])\n\u2212 2\u03b2yu + 1 2 \u21262 ( \u2212(H\u0302y)k\u0302|z|2 \u2212 H\u0302 [ yk\u0302|z|2 ]) + \u03c3\u2202u\n(\n\u2212(H\u0302y)u |zu| \u2212 H\u0302\n[\nyu |zu|\n]\n)\n= 0,\nor, writing it in compact form,\nL1(y, \u03b4y) + L0(y) = 0. (20)\nWhen Hilbert transform is applied to the equation (20), we obtain the linear equation for \u03b4y:\nH\u0302L1(y, \u03b4y)\u03b4y = \u2212H\u0302L0(y) (21)\nwith a self-adjoint operator with respect to the standard inner product:\n(f, g) =\n\u03c0 \u222b\n\u2212\u03c0\nf(x)g(x)dx (22)\nfor real-valued f(x) and g(x). A linear system with a self-adjoint operator is amenable to be solved by the Conjugate-Residual (CR) method. We solve (20) numerically using a Fourier pseudospectral\n8 method to approximate the function z. The projection operator P\u0302 , Hilbert transform H\u0302 and derivatives with respect to u are applied as Fourier multipliers. At each Newton iteration a new linear system is solved with CR, and Newton iterations are performed until a required tolerance, \u03b5, is attained: \u2016N\u0302 ( z(m) ) \u2016 \u2264 \u03b5.\nThe second order approximation (15) is used as an initial guess, z(0), to initiate the Newton\u2019s iterations. Once a nonlinear solution is determined with a given set of parameters, it is used to follow the solution branch to strongly nonlinear waves by parameter continuation, either in \u03b2 or \u21262, while keeping surface tension \u03c3 fixed.\nA constraint relating the physically relevant quantities,\n\u00b5\u03b2 \u2212 4\u2126J \u2212 2\u03c3L = 0, (23)\nis used to determine the value of \u21262 if \u03b2 is known, or vice versa. Here 4i\u00b5 = \u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 (zz\u0304u \u2212 z\u0304zu) du is\nthe droplet area, L = \u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 |zu|du is the droplet perimeter length, and 4J = \u2212\u2126\n\u222b\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 |z|2k\u0302|z|2du is\nthe rescaled angular momentum.\nThe solutions of (10) enjoy two symmetries, one is related to the freedom of choosing the phase shift in the rotation angle, and the second symmetry is related to rescaling of the droplet surface. The choice of phase shift is fixed by seeking only even y(u), and in order to hold the droplet area \u00b5 fixed, we rescale z(u), \u03b2, L and J once a solution of (10) is obtained,\nz(u) \u2192 z\n\u03bd , \u00b5\u2192\n\u00b5\n\u03bd2 , L\u2192\nL \u03bd , J \u2192 J \u03bd4 . (24)\nFor example, choosing \u03bd = \u221a \u00b5/\u03c0 ensures that \u00b5 = \u03c0 is preserved. The number of Fourier modes that we considered is limited by N = 65536, and the magnitude of the Fourier mode at series truncation is 10\u22129. The relative tolerance for solving the linear system (20) in the CR method is 10\u22122, and the nonlinear residual for Newton\u2019s iterations \u03b5 = 10\u22129."

            "text": "The nonlinear waves obtained with Newton-Conjugate-Residual method are illustrated in Fig. 3 with k = 4 and k = 25 lobes. In addition, we show parameter curves \u21262 vs H/\u03bb (see Fig. 4, left) and J vs H/\u03bb (see Fig. 4, right). Here H denotes the height of the wave, and \u03bb is the spatial period.\nWe illustrate two typical solutions of the nonlinear equation (10) by showing the shape of the free surface and the velocity field in Fig. 1. We find that a traveling wave becomes elongated as\n9\nthe steepness grows, and the number of Fourier modes necessary to resolve the solution grows with wave steepness (see Fig. 2), indicating the existence of a singularity in the analytic continuation of z(w) to the upper half-plane w \u2208 C+. The nature of this singularity, and the existence of a limiting wave is the subject of ongoing research.\nThe numerical simulations and theoretical considerations suggest that a solution with sufficiently many lobes approaches the Crapper wave as the number of lobes grows (Fig. 3). The right panel of Fig. 3 indicates that steepness of the self-touching (limiting) Crapper wave is approached by the\n10\nnonlinear solutions of (10) as the number of lobes k increases. This can be explained as follows: the wavelength is given by \u03bb = 2\u03c0/k, and as it becomes small compared to the perimeter of the droplet (when k grows), the effects of local curvature become less significant and vanish in the limit k \u2192 \u221e. Another open question concerns the number of lobes for which self-touching of neighboring waves occurs (Crapper scenario) versus the presently unknown limiting scenario for few lobes, e.g. k = 2 and k = 3 for which no indication of a tendency to self-intersect was observed."

            "text": "Breaking of water waves in deep ocean is associated with generation of water droplet spray. The latter partially accounts for the energy\u2013momentum transfer in wave turbulence. The physical processes that generate water spray have been observed in physical ocean [7], as well as theoretically [5]. As plunging breaker develops on the crest of an ocean wave, there is an abrupt growth of small scale features, and several physical mechanisms suddenly come into play. The force of the surface tension, normally having little effect on long gravity waves becomes one of the dominant forces at the crest of a breaking wave. The detachment of a water droplet from a plunging breaker is a complicated and nonlinear process, and the present work does not make an attempt to understand it to the full extent.\nWe considered a problem of deformation of a fluid disc with a free boundary subject to the force of surface tension. We found that a conformal map associated with such a flow satisfies a pseudo\u2013 differential equation that is similar to Babenko equation for the Stokes wave. We demonstrate the results of numerical simulation with initial data close to linear waves, and observe excellent agreement for small amplitude waves, and report significant deviations as amplitude grows.\nThe nonlinear equation (9), or its complex form (10), are solved by the Newton-ConjugateResidual method [13, 17] that is also applicable to the Stokes wave problem. The present work is a precursor to further investigation of nonlinear waves, and of particular interest are the questions of existence of the limiting wave, its nature and singularities. One may speculate that the limiting wave will not form an angle on the surface, since it would make the potential energy grow; yet the numerical simulations suggest the breaking of a droplet (for small number of lobes), and a tendency to develop a self-touching solution like the Crapper wave (for large number of lobes). The study of limiting scenarios is the subject of ongoing work.\n11\n[1] K. I.
