 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate more advanced digital beamforming techniques to further suppress the interference from the far-field user to the near-field user. The paper currently only considers analog beamforming, so exploring digital beamforming could help reduce the interference more.

2. Analyze the scenario with multiple near-field and far-field users. The paper focuses on a simple 2-user case. Extending the analysis to multi-user communications could reveal new insights. 

3. Study the effects of user mobility on the interference dynamics. The paper assumes fixed user locations but mobility could significantly impact the interference patterns.

4. Evaluate different multiple access techniques like NOMA and SDMA for near-field vs far-field users. The paper uses orthogonal multiple access but non-orthogonal techniques may perform better.

5. Explore deployment scenarios with both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. The paper considers an ideal propagation environment. Investigating effects of scattering and fading could be useful.
