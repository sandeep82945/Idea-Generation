    "abstractText": "Two difficulties associated with the computations of thermal vibrational correlation functions are discussed. The first one is the lack of a well-behaved expression that is valid at both high-temperature and T \u2192 0 K limits. Specifically, if the partition function and the propagator are considered separately, then thermal vibrational correlation functions may have an indeterminate form 0/0 in the limit T \u2192 0 K. This difficulty is resolved when the partition function and the propagator are jointly considered in the harmonic approximation, which allows a problematic term that emanates from the zero-point energy to be cancelled out thereby producing a thermal correlation function with a determinate form in T \u2192 0 K limit. The second difficulty is related to the multivaluedness of the vibrational correlation function. We show numerically that an improper selection of branch leads to discontinuities in the computed correlation function and an incorrect vibronic spectra. We propose a phase tracking procedure that ensures continuity of both real and imaginary parts of the correlation function to recover the correct spectra. We support our findings by simulating the UV-vis absorption spectra of pentacene at 4 K and benzene at 298 K. Both are found to be in good agreement with their experimental counterparts.",

The first one is the lack of a well-behaved expression that is valid at both high-temperature and T \u2192 0 K limits. Specifically, if the partition function and the propagator are considered separately, then thermal vibrational correlation functions may have an indeterminate form 0/0 in the limit T \u2192 0 K. This difficulty is resolved when the partition function and the propagator are jointly considered in the harmonic approximation, which allows a problematic term that emanates from the zero-point energy to be cancelled out thereby producing a thermal correlation function with a determinate form in T \u2192 0 K limit. The second difficulty is related to the multivaluedness of the vibrational correlation function. We show numerically that an improper selection of branch leads to discontinuities in the computed correlation function and an incorrect vibronic spectra. We propose a phase tracking procedure that ensures continuity of both real and imaginary parts of the correlation function to recover the correct spectra. We support our findings by simulating the UV-vis absorption spectra of pentacene at 4 K and benzene at 298 K. Both are found to be in good agreement with their experimental counterparts."

            "text": "In silico design of light emitting materials is one of the major applications of computational spectroscopy. Reliable predictions of line positions and shapes in fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra are in demand for identifying promising molecules among thousands and sometimes tens of thousands candidates.\nSimulations of vibrationally resolved electronic spectra can be broadly classified as timeindependent (TI)1\u20134 or time-dependent (TD).5\u201310 In TI approaches, spectra are simulated as superposition of individual vibronic transitions, often broadened phenomenologically to match experiments. TI methods become impractical for large molecules due to the pro-\nhibitively large number of contributing vibronic transitions.11 The extensive computational costs have even prompted some researchers to tackle the problem via quantum computing, particularly via boson sampling and to rethink the computational hardware that ought to be used for such problems.12 In TD approaches, vibronic spectra are computed by the Fourier transform of the transition dipole correlation function.\nWhen vibronic transitions are considered, TI and TD formalisms require at least two potential energy surfaces (PESs) \u2014 one for the initial and another for the final electronic state. Because the construction of fully anharmonic multidimensional PESs is challenging for all but the smallest molecules,13 numerous TI and TD approaches rely on the harmonic approximation (HA) in which the true PESs are approximated by multidimensional paraboloids that are constructed from truncated Taylor expansions at relevant nuclear configurations. The relative position and orientation of two paraboloids can be defined through the first-order Duschinsky transformation.14 Under the umbrella of the HA, additional approximations can be made depending on the choice of reference nuclear geometries where Taylor expansion is made. For example, an adiabatic Hessian model evaluates the final electronic state Hessian at a minimum of the final electronic state, whereas in a vertical Hessian model, the minimum of the initial electronic state is used.15\u201318 Further approximations, such as the independent mode displaced harmonic approximation,19 neglect Duschinsky rotation and/or assume that the initial and final states have identical harmonic frequencies.\nNumerous studies6\u20139,18,20\u201322 have applied the TD formalism in conjunction with the HA. For rigid molecules, this is a viable alternative to methods that perform on-the-fly dynamical propagations, as they often require expensive electronic structure calculations to be done at every time step and Hessians to be re-evaluated multiple times.10,23 A popular and quite successful approach is to use the propagator of a quantum harmonic oscillator in the coordinate basis, the so-called Mehler kernel, to evaluate the transition dipole correlation function analytically. Though some studies6,8,18 have derived an expression that incorporates thermal effects (herein referred to as \u00b5T ), others 22,24 have neglected temperature dependence\nand derived it exclusively at 0 K (\u00b50). Though one might reasonably expect \u00b5T to converge smoothly to \u00b50 when T \u2192 0 K, this is not the case since \u00b5T becomes ill-defined in this limit. \u00b5T is commonly expressed as a fraction where the Mehler kernel is in the numerator and the partition function is in the denominator and both approach 0 as T \u2192 0 K, leading to an indeterminate form 0/0 and causes numerical instabilities at extremely low temperatures. To circumvent the issue, de Souza et al. 9 suggested to redefine certain terms in \u00b5T at temperatures lower than 10 K such that it would coincide with \u00b50. Doing so, one effectively gets two separate expressions: one used at very low temperatures (less than 10 K) and another used everywhere else. Although this solution is acceptable, because one does not expect to see noticeable differences in spectra taken in the 0 K to 10 K interval, a deeper understanding of the cause of the issue as well as potential consequences are highly desired.\nQuantum dynamics of one-dimensional harmonic oscillators that uses the Mehler kernel exhibits occasional time-discontinuities and sudden phase jumps.25\u201327 This feature is well documented and explained in many textbooks that introduce the path-integral formalism.28\u201330 Given that \u00b5T (t) corresponding to two multidimensional harmonic oscillators is built from several single-mode propagators, one expects these discontinuities to impact vibronic spectra simulations. Thus, it seems natural to assess such impact and develop a method that delivers continuous \u00b5T (t). While one may argue that because such discontinuities do not arise in quantum dynamics obtained by solving the time-dependent Schro\u0308dinger equation, that the use of the Mehler kernel ought to be discarded; the propagator approach should be preserved as it allows for easy consideration of thermal effects.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We begin by introducing key equations used to simulate vibronic spectra within the time-dependent approach. Next, we show how terms inside \u00b5T (t) can be factored and canceled out under the HA to yield a well-behaved expression at T \u2192 0 K. For the sake of simplicity, we analyze the one-dimensional model first before deriving an expression for the thermal vibrational correlation function of a multidimensional harmonic oscillator. After that, we look into the time-discontinuity of \u00b5T (t) and propose a\nphase tracking scheme that effectively amounts to the inclusion of a Maslov correction 25 for all individual normal modes. The result is a formula for thermal transition dipole correlation function that is well-defined across all temperatures, time-continuous, and numerically stable. It can be computed for relatively large molecules while fully accounting for Duschinsky rotations and displacements within the adiabatic Hessian model. We illustrate our developments by simulating absorption spectra of pentacene at 4 K in the Franck\u2013Condon approximation and benzene at 298 K in the Herzberg\u2013Teller approximation and compare them with their experimental counterparts. Atomic units are used throughout the paper."

This is not only a conceptual\nproblem, but it also makes computations susceptible to numerical instabilities at extremely low temperatures.\nTo circumvent this issue, some studies (e.g. Ref. 9) have employed two different expressions for \u00b5FCT (t). One is intended for high temperatures where one does not encounter the aforementioned numerical issues and coincides with the derivations presented so far. Another is meant for temperatures near 0 K and is derived from Eq.

(22)\nIt is worth noting that one can also partially derive Eq. (21) by neglecting or removing the zero-point energy in the Mehler kernel and in ZI(T ). We can do so by multiplying both expressions by eiE HO 0 t where EHO0 is the zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator,\nKnoZPE(q, q \u2032, t) = eiE HO 0 t \u3008q|e\u2212iH\u0302t|q\u2032\u3009 (23)\n=\n\u221a mw\n\u03c0 1\u221a 1\u2212 e\u22122iwt e(imw( cot(wt) 2 (q2+q\u20322)\u2212 1 sin(wt) qq\u2032)), (24)\nZnoZPE(T ) = e EHO0 k\u03b2T Z(T ) (25)\n= 1\n1\u2212 e\u2212 w k\u03b2T\n, (26)\nso that\nK\u0303(q, q\u2032, \u03c4) = eiE0t KnoZPE(q, q\n\u2032, \u03c4)\nZnoZPE(T ) , (27)\nthereby making the quotient of KnoZPE and ZnoZPE differs from K\u0303 by a global phase. This phase does not alter the spectral line shape, it merely shifts it horizontally by EHO0 along the energy axis.\nThe issue of the indeterminate form of limT\u21920 \u3008q|e\u2212iH\u0302\u03c4 |q\u2032\u3009\nZ(T ) is general as it is not limited\nto the harmonic oscillator model and arises in all bounded systems. The generic forms of \u3008q|e\u2212iH\u0302t|q\u2032\u3009 and Z(T ) for any bounded system can be expressed in the eigenbasis {\u03c6n(q)} and energy spectrum {En} of the Hamiltonian\n\u3008q|e\u2212iH\u0302\u03c4 |q\u2032\u3009 = e\u2212 E0 k\u03b2T e\u2212iE0t \u2211 n ei\u2206En\u03c4\u03c6\u2217n(q)\u03c6n(q \u2032), (28)\nZ(T ) = e \u2212 E0 k\u03b2T \u2211 n e \u2212\u2206En k\u03b2T , (29)\nwhere E0 is the system\u2019s zero point energy, \u2206En is the energy difference between En and E0 and limT\u21920 e \u2212 E0 k\u03b2T \u2192 0. As a result, Eq. (23), Eq. (25) and Eq. (27) are general equations in the sense that they are valid to all bounded systems \u2014 one only needs to replace EHO0 with E0. These equations used in conjunction with Eq. (22) can effectively yield Franck-Condon correlation functions with a determinate forms. Moreover, it is evident that when partition functions and propagators are obtained approximately, that the cancellation in Eq. (27) only works if both entail the exact same zero-point energy.\n2.3 \u00b5\u0303FCT (t) in the multidimensional case\nEq. (18), may be re-expressed more succinctly in mass-weighted coordinates as\nK(q, q\u2032, t) =\n\u221a a\n2\u03c0i e\n i2 [ q q\u2032 ] b \u2212a\n\u2212a b\n  q\nq\u2032\n \n(30)\nwhere a = w sin(wt) and b = w tan(wt) . In the case of a N -dimensional harmonic oscillator, if one works in the basis of normal modes Q, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as the sum of N one-dimensional Hamiltonians. The corresponding N -dimensional propagator is thus the product of one-dimensional ones,\nK(Q,Q\u2032, t) = N\u220f n=1 Kn(qn, q \u2032 n, t)\n=\n\u221a det(A)\n(2\u03c0i)N e\n i2 [ Q Q\u2032 ] B \u2212A\n\u2212A B\n  Q\nQ\u2032\n \n(31)\nwhere A and B are diagonal matrices with elements An = wn\nsin(wnt) and Bn = wn tan(wnt) , re-\nspectively. In the case of K\u0303(Q,Q\u2032, \u03c4), one obtains a similar expression but with a different\npre-exponential factor,\nK\u0303(Q,Q\u2032, t) = det(\u2126)e\n i2 [ Q Q\u2032 ] B \u2212A\n\u2212A B\n  Q\nQ\u2032\n \n(32)\nwhere \u2126 is a diagonal matrix with elements \u2126n = \u221a wn \u03c0 (1\u2212e\u2212wn\u03b2)e iwnt 2\u221a 1\u2212e2iwnte\u22122wn\u03b2 .\nFor molecules under the HA, nuclear degrees of freedom are often represented in the basis of normal modes. Those coincide with the eigenvectors of mass-weighted Hessians of either initial or final electronic states, which are denoted by \u039bI and \u039bF , respectively. Given an initial nuclear configuration expressed in the basis of normal modes of the final electronic state QF , a change in basis to the normal modes of the initial electronic state QI can be done via the Duschinsky transformation\nQI = JIFQF + K (33)\nwhere JIF = \u039b \u1d40 I\u039bF and K = \u039b \u1d40 ILF with LF being the nuclear displacement of the final state PES minimum expressed in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates.\nUltimately, by solving the integral resulting from the insertion of Eq. (31) and Eq. (32) into multidimensional analogue of Eq. (22) and the change of variables as per Eq. (33), we get\n\u00b5\u0304FCT (t) = det(\u2126I)\n\u221a (\u22122\u03c0i)N det(AF )\ndet(D) e\n( i ( \u2212E\n\u1d40D\u22121E 2\n+F ))\n(34)\nwhere\nD =  BF + J\u1d40IFBIJIF \u2212(AF + J\u1d40IFAIJIF ) \u2212(AF + J\u1d40IFAIJIF ) BF + J \u1d40 IFBIJIF  , E\u1d40 = [ K\u1d40(BI \u2212AI)JIF K\u2032\u1d40(BI \u2212AI)JIF ] ,\nF = K\u2032 \u1d40 (BI \u2212AI)K\n(35)\nFor large molecules, the determinants in Eq. (34) may acquire large magnitudes and their\ncomputations may result in overflow errors. Thus, to compute \u00b5FCT (t) of large molecules, it is necessary to reexpress the pre-exponential factor in a more tractable form. Looking at Eq. (34), one may be tempted to compute det(\u21262IAFD \u22121) and expect a numerical outcome whose magnitude is close to 1, given that the matrix elements of \u21262IAF are of approximately the same order of magnitude as those of D. However, this cannot be done because D is a 2N \u00d7 2N matrix and \u2126I and AF are N \u00d7N matrices.\nTo proceed forward approximately along this path, we need to define an N \u00d7N matrix whose determinant equals that of D. Such matrix is D\u0303 = D11 ( D11 \u2212D12D11\u22121D12 ) , which is constructed from the submatrices of D where D11 = (BF + J \u1d40 IFBIJIF ), D12 = \u2212(AF +\nJ\u1d40IFAIJIF ) and satisfies det(D) = det ( D\u0303 ) and (det(D))\u22121 = det ( D\u0303\u22121 ) .9,33 Furthermore,\nto ensure that the use of \u221a\ndet(\u21262I) gives the same result as that of det{\u2126I}, we introduce \u03b7 that equals either +1 or \u22121 such that det(\u2126I) = \u03b7 \u221a det(\u21262I). The substitution of these terms inside Eq. (34) yields\n\u00b5\u0304FCT (t) = \u03b7(\u22122\u03c0i) N 2 \u221a det ( \u21262IAF D\u0303 \u22121 ) e ( i ( \u2212E \u1d40D\u22121E 2 +F )) , (36)\nwhich is a numerically more stable than Eq. (34).\n2.4 Time-discontinuity in \u00b5\u0303FCT (t)\nA direct numerical implementation of Eq. (36) yields a discontinuous \u00b5\u0304FCT (t) and an erroneous vibronic spectrum. The source of the time-discontinuity is the pre-exponential factor. The term under the square root is a complex-valued function of time, |S(t)|ei\u03b8(t) and has two\nsquare roots: \u221a |S(t)|ei \u03b8(t) 2 and \u221a |S(t)|ei( \u03b8(t) 2 +\u03c0). When a square root is computed, most numerical libraries output the principal value, which is usually the root with the positive real component. Such choice is not always valid.\nFundamentally, the discontinuity arises because the expression used for the one-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator propagator, Eq. (18), can be discontinuous in time; it is multiplied by\n1\u221a \u22121 = e \u2212i\u03c0/2 after half-period increments.26 In the path integral (PI) formalism, these extra phase jumps stem from the contributions of variations surrounding classical trajectories; see Appendix D for the detailed explanation.\nTo correct for the discontinuity in the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator propagator, it is common to employ the Maslov phase correction.25 This correction consists in adopting the following expression for the Mehler kernel instead of Eq. (18):\n\u3008q|e\u2212iH\u0302t|q\u2032\u3009 = \u221a m\n2\u03c0i\n\u221a w\n|sin (wt)| e\n( imw ( (q2+q\u20322) cot(wt)\n2 \u2212 qq \u2032 |sin(wt)| )) e \u2212i\u03bd\u03c0 2 , (37)\nwhere \u03bd is called the Morse index and it is the number of elapsed half-periods in the time span [0, t].28\u201330 In deriving \u00b5FCT (t) of a multidimensional harmonic oscillator, one could have begun with Eq. (37) rather than Eq. (18). This would have produced an expression analogous to Eq. (36) that would have included e \u2212i\u03bd\u03c0 2 terms for every initial and final electronic state normal modes. Such an approach would have had the advantage of preventing the timediscontinuity issue. The disadvantage, however, is that one would have had to keep track of all Morse indexes and evolve them over the course of the dynamics, thereby making the entire procedure cumbersome and error prone. Instead, we propose an alternative approach of tracking the total phase. We multiply the right-hand side of Eq. (36) with a real phase factor \u03b8(t). This phase factor will equal either 1 or \u22121, depending on which value minimizes the difference between \u00b5FCT (t) values at consecutive time steps. This effectively allows one to select the appropriate branch of z 1 2 and to ensure the continuity of real and imaginary parts of \u00b5FCT (t), which, as we will show in Sec. 3.2, is paramount to vibronic spectra simulations. The inclusion of the phase factor yields a final expression for the FC correlation function\n\u00b5\u0303FCT (t) = \u03b8\u03b7(\u22122\u03c0i) N 2 \u221a det ( \u21262IAF D\u0303 \u22121 ) e ( i ( \u2212E \u1d40D\u22121E 2 +F )) , (38)\nwhich is applicable for any temperature T \u2265 0 K, is continuous in time, and is stable numerically for large molecules with many vibrational degrees of freedom. The phase tracking\nprocedure removes the need to compute the Morse indexes of all normal modes at all time steps. However, assessing the continuity between \u00b5FCT (t) values of adjacent time steps requires that dynamical simulations be performed with sufficiently small time steps.\nIn the case where several normal modes have the same frequencies, degenerate Hessian eigenvectors are arbitrarily defined. This arbitrariness can find itself in the Duschinsky matrix JIF of Eq. (33), and in \u00b5\u0303 FC T (t) of Eq. (38). The degeneracies could cause \u00b5\u0303 FC T (t) to have an arbitrary phase, which would be unresolved by the phase-tracking procedure herein. In our implementation, we avoid this issue altogether by computing the normal modes once at the start of the dynamics. The Duschinsky matrix is computed once, and it is stored in memory and reused in subsequent time steps. This effectively amounts to fixing the basis of the degenerate subspace."

This level of theory is comparable to ones used in other theoretical simulations of vibronic spectral shapes that report good agreement with their experimental counterparts.9,18,38 Additionally, it was demonstrated22 that this level of theory produces spectral line shapes similar to those obtained with the second-order approximate coupled-cluster (CC2) method and hybrid functionals used in conjunction with larger basis sets.11\nHessians were computed by first-order numerical differentiation of gradients and atomic coordinate displacements of 0.01 A.

The experimental spectrum has been obtained using the matrix-isolation technique where pentacene monomers were trapped in a neon matrix. At low concentrations, this methodology approximates light absorption and emission in the absence of solvation and environmental effects. Thus, DFT and TDDFT calculations were done in vacuum. The phase-corrected theoretical spectrum was shifted by 0.56 eV as to improve correspondence with experiment. The need to shift theoretical spectra stems from the general tendency of B3LYP to overestimating singlet vertical excitations of benzene and acenes by approximately 0.5 eV.22,42\nAs clearly visible in Fig. 1, absence of phase correction results in a nonsensical spectrum (the red dotted curve). The solid blue line however includes the phase correction for which the branch has been appropriately chosen to render the correlation function continuous in time.\nThese results indicate that the continuity of real and imaginary components of the simulated correlation function has a dramatic impact on vibronic spectra and that the methodology based on Eq.

            "heading": "4 Conclusions",
            "text": "We investigated two complications that may arise while computing thermal vibrational correlation functions in the harmonic approximation. The first complication is that the correlation functions can be ill-defined at extremely low temperatures if the partition function and the Mehler kernel, which are their key components, are considered independently. This is caused by zero-point energy terms present in both the partition function and the propagator. Their removal, either through a cancellation of terms or by neglecting the zero-point energy entirely, yields a thermal correlation function that has a determinate form in the T \u2192 0 K limit. This provides a means of computing vibronic spectra within the time-dependent formulation that is unified without resorting to consider two disjoint temperature regimes.\nThe second complication is that thermal vibrational correlation functions in molecular\nsystems can be discontinuous in time. This occurs because the pre-exponential factor of the Mehler kernel is multivalued. Though one may attempt to construct correlation functions from Maslov-corrected single mode propagators, this would necessitate evolving all underlying Morse indexes during dynamics, which may be cumbersome to implement. Alternatively, as we have shown, the inclusion of a single global phase parameter in the final expression of the correlation function suffices to produce a result whose real and imaginary parts are continuous. This phase ultimately selects the appropriate branch of z 1 2 and minimizes the difference between values of the correlation function of adjacent time steps. While the current work was under review, Begus\u030cic\u0301 et al. 23 published a study that also addressed in part the discontinuity of the correlation function.\nBy addressing these two complications, we obtained an expression for the thermal dipole autocorrelation function, Eq. (38), that is well-defined and continuous in time. We assessed our findings on two realistic molecular systems, pentacene at 4 K and benzene at 298 K. We found that nonsensical absorption spectra were obtained when phase corrections were omitted (as in the case of pentacene), while with the phase correction our theoretical results matched well with the experimental counterparts.\nAlthough our work focused mostly on harmonic systems, our conclusions are relevant to other models. In any model with positive zero-point energy, one should expect that independent considerations of propagators and partition functions can lead to thermal correlation functions with indeterminate forms in the T \u2192 0 K limit. In such case, one can resort to the procedure described in Sec. 2.2 to obtain a determinate form. We also expect the timediscontinuity issue to persist in bound anharmonic models whose potential energy surfaces are locally well approximated by quadratic functions and where the underlying dynamics are confined to those regions. This would be the case if the initial and final potential energy surfaces resemble Morse potentials with overlapping minima and large dissociation energies. Furthermore, as it may be difficult to predict analytically the exact instance of the propagator\u2019s sudden phase change in arbitrary potentials, the numerical procedure discussed in\nSec. 2.4 is a general solution for obtaining continuous correlation functions."

The integral term in Eq. (63) is often referred to as the fluctuation factor 29 and in the case of the harmonic oscillator it coincides with the pre-exponential factor in Eq. (18), the root of the time-discontinuity. The second functional derivative of the action\n\u039b = \u03b42S [qc] \u03b4q\u03b4q\u2032 = \u2212m d 2 dt2 \u2212 \u2202 2V [qc] \u2202q2 , (64)\nis needed to evaluate the second variation \u03b42S[\u03b4x].\nTo do so, a common approach50 consists in expanding \u03b4q in the basis of the eigenfunctions of \u039b, \u039bun(t) = \u03bbnun(t) subject to boundary conditions un(0) = un(t \u2032) = 0. In the case of the harmonic oscillator, this amounts to a Fourier expansion\n\u03b4q(t) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 anun(t) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 an\n\u221a 2\nt\u2032 sin\n( n\u03c0t\nt\u2032\n) , (65)\nwhich results in the fluctuation factor being proportional to \u220f\u221e\nn=1 \u03bb \u22121/2 n where \u03bbn = m [( n\u03c0 t\u2032 )2 \u2212 w2]. The term \u03bbn can be interpreted to be the curvature of S[q] near qc along the direction un(t). All \u03bbn starts off by being positive before becoming negative after their half-periods. The classical harmonic trajectory minimizes the action when t\u2032 < \u03c0 w and becomes a saddle point when t\u2032 > \u03c0 w . Ultimately, this switch is the reason behind the discontinuity of \u00b5\u0304FCT (t)."
