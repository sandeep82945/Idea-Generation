    "abstractText": "The important feature of petunia in tissue culture is its unpredictable and genotype-dependent callogenesis, posing challenges for efficient regeneration and biotechnology applications. To address this issue, machine learning (ML) can be considered a powerful tool to analyze callogenesis data, extract key parameters, and predict optimal conditions for petunia callogenesis, facilitating more controlled and productive tissue culture processes. The study aimed to develop a predictive model for callogenesis in petunia using ML algorithms and to optimize the concentrations of phytohormones to enhance callus formation rate (CFR) and callus fresh weight (CFW). The inputs for the model were BAP, KIN, IBA, and NAA, while the outputs were CFR and CFW. Three ML algorithms, namely MLP, RBF, and GRNN, were compared, and the results revealed that GRNN (R\ufffd83) outperformed MLP and RBF in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the relative importance of the four phytohormones. IBA exhibited the highest importance, followed by NAA, BAP, and KIN. Leveraging the superior performance of the GRNN model, a genetic algorithm (GA) was integrated to optimize the concentration of phytohormones for maximizing CFR and CFW. The genetic algorithm identified an optimized combination of phytohormones consisting of 1.31 mg/L BAP, 1.02 mg/L KIN, 1.44 mg/L NAA, and 1.70 mg/L IBA, resulting in 95.83% CFR. To validate the reliability of the predicted results, optimized combinations of phytohormones were tested in a laboratory experiment. The results of the validation experiment indicated no significant difference between the experimental and optimized results obtained through the GA. This study presents a novel approach combining ML, sensitivity analysis, and GA for modeling and predicting callogenesis in petunia. The findings offer valuable insights into the optimization of phytohormone concentrations, facilitating improved callus formation and potential applications in plant tissue culture and genetic engineering.

            "text": "Plant tissue culture approaches have revolutionized the field of plant propagation and plant improvement due to their remarkable potential for rapid multiplication of plant species, germplasm preservation, and the production of disease-free plant material [1\u20134]. Petunia (Petunia hybrida) is an ornamental flowering plant widely cultivated for its vibrant and diverse flower colors, making it a popular valuable plant in the horticultural industry [5]. Traditional methods of petunia propagation, such as seed germination and vegetative propagation through cuttings, often face limitations in terms of time, efficiency, and genetic stability [6\u20138]. Therefore, the utilization of plant tissue culture techniques offers valuable alternatives for overcoming these challenges and achieving more efficient and reliable propagation and plant improvement strategies in petunia [9].\nOne of the key advantages of plant tissue culture approaches in petunia propagation is the\nability to achieve rapid and mass multiplication of elite cultivars [6\u20138]. Through techniques such as shoot proliferation, somatic embryogenesis, and organogenesis, a large number of plantlets can be generated from a single explant, irrespective of the availability of seeds or the season [10\u201312]. This rapid multiplication not only facilitates commercial production but also aids in the preservation of valuable germplasm and rare genotypes [13, 14]. Furthermore, tissue culture methods allow for the production of disease-free plant material by eliminating pathogens during the sterilization process and maintaining strict aseptic conditions throughout the culture period [15]. The resultant plants are free from diseases such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, ensuring their healthy establishment in the field or greenhouse [16]. These diseasefree plants also serve as a valuable resource for genetic improvement programs, providing a clean starting point for the introduction of desirable traits and the development of novel cultivars in petunia [9]. Overall, plant tissue culture approaches offer significant advantages in terms of rapid multiplication and disease-free propagation, making them indispensable tools in the propagation and plant improvement of petunia [6\u20138].\nCallus formation is a crucial multi-variable process that plays a pivotal role in plant tissue\nculture systems [17]. Callus, an undifferentiated mass of cells derived from explants, serves as an intermediate stage for subsequent organogenesis or embryogenesis, and is widely utilized for various applications including plant regeneration, genetic transformation, and secondary metabolite production [18]. The formation and development of callus are influenced by a multitude of factors, including explant type, culture medium composition, hormonal balance, physical conditions, and genetic factors [19]. Understanding the intricate interplay among these variables is essential for optimizing callus induction and subsequent plant regeneration protocols. However, due to the complex nature of callus formation, it remains a challenging process to predict and control [20]. This necessitates a comprehensive investigation into the multiple factors governing callus initiation and growth, enabling a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and facilitating the development of efficient tissue culture systems for a wide range of plant species [21].\nMachine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for advancing our under-\nstanding of complex biological processes, including callus formation in plant tissue culture systems [22\u201328]. Traditional approaches have relied on empirical observations and trial-anderror methods, which are time-consuming and often yield suboptimal results [29, 30]. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have demonstrated great potential in deciphering the underlying mechanisms of callus formation and facilitating the optimization of tissue culture protocols [31\u201333]. By leveraging large datasets and complex mathematical models, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, extract relevant features, and predict outcomes with a higher degree of accuracy [34\u201337]. These techniques enable researchers to\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293754 November 3, 2023 2 / 18\nsystematically analyze and integrate diverse variables, such as explant type, culture medium composition, hormonal balance, physical conditions, and genetic factors, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their individual and collective contributions to callus induction and growth [20]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms can uncover non-linear relationships and hidden interactions among variables, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of callus formation [33]. This knowledge can then be utilized to design targeted experiments, optimize culture conditions, and develop predictive models that enhance the efficiency and reliability of the callus formation process [38]. Overall, the integration of machine learning techniques holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of callus formation mechanisms and facilitating the development of more efficient and precise tissue culture protocols in plant biotechnology [19, 39].\nThe current study was aimed to harness the power of machine learning techniques to\nimprove our understanding of the complex process of callus formation in Petunia hybrida tissue culture systems. Therefore, the specific objectives of this study include: (1) collecting a comprehensive dataset comprising various concentrations of different phytohormones influencing callogenesis; (2) training and validating machine learning algorithms on the dataset to develop predictive models for callus induction and growth in Petunia; (3) identifying key variables and their interactions that significantly influence callus formation; (4) gaining insights into the non-linear relationships and complex dynamics underlying callus formation; and (5) utilizing the developed predictive models to optimize tissue culture protocols and improve the efficiency and reliability of callus formation in Petunia. By achieving these objectives, this study aims to contribute to the field of plant tissue culture and provide valuable tools and knowledge for the advancement of Petunia biotechnology applications."

The input layer of the RBF network receives the input variables, which in our study are the concentrations of BAP, KIN, NAA, and IBA. Each input variable is represented by a neuron in the input layer, where the values are fed forward to the hidden layer for further processing.\nThe hidden layer of the RBF network is responsible for transforming the input variables\ninto a higher-dimensional feature space.

Each component performs a specific function in processing the input data and producing the desired output.

The input layer acts as a conduit, passing the input values to the subsequent layers for further processing.\nThe pattern layer is responsible for storing the training patterns of the dataset. In our study,\neach training pattern comprises the input variables (phytohormone concentrations) and their corresponding output variables (callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus). The GRNN stores these patterns in its memory and uses them for subsequent computations.\nThe summation layer calculates the similarity between the input pattern and the stored\ntraining patterns. It employs the Gaussian kernel function to determine the weighted similarity between the input pattern and each stored pattern. The kernel function assigns higher weights to patterns that are closer to the input pattern, capturing the relationship between the input variables and the output variables. The output layer of the GRNN generates the predicted output values. It uses the weighted similarities calculated in the summation layer to estimate the output values based on the training patterns stored in the pattern layer. The output layer applies a weighted averaging mechanism, where the predicted output values are weighed by their respective similarities to the input pattern. During the training phase, the GRNN adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted output values and the actual output values. This process is accomplished through a combination of supervised learning and memory-based reasoning, leveraging the stored training patterns to guide the learning process."

Initially, we trained the machine learning model, MLP in our case, using the entire dataset and obtained the corresponding predictions for the output variables. Subsequently, we performed a systematic variation of the input variables within a predetermined range while keeping the remaining inputs constant. For each variable, we incrementally modified its value and recorded the resulting changes in the output variables. This process allowed us to observe the sensitivity of the output variables to variations in the individual input variables. The VSR was calculated by dividing the absolute change in the output variable by the corresponding change in the input variable.

Indeed, we employed GA to determine the optimal concentrations of BAP, KIN, NAA, and IBA for maximizing callogenesis parameters (i.e., callus formation rate and callus fresh weight) in petunia tissue culture. GA is a powerful optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It is particularly well-suited for solving complex optimization problems with a single objective. The architecture of the GA used in our study consisted of several key components: the population, fitness function, selection mechanism, crossover operator, mutation operator, and termination criteria (Fig 1B). The population represented a set of potential solutions, with each solution corresponding to a specific combination of phytohormone concentrations. In our case, the concentrations of BAP, KIN, NAA, and IBA formed the variables of each solution within the population. The fitness function evaluated the performance or suitability of each solution in the population. In our study, the fitness function measured the callus formation rate resulting from each combination of phytohormone concentrations. The higher the callus formation rate, the higher the fitness score assigned to the corresponding solution. The selection mechanism determined which solutions would be selected as parents for reproduction in the next generation. Roulette wheel selection as one of the most powerful selection methods was used in the current study. Roulette wheel selection ensures that solutions with higher fitness scores have a higher probability of being selected as parents. The crossover operator facilitated the recombination of genetic material from selected parents to produce offspring. In our study, the crossover operation involved combining the concentrations of phytohormones from two parent solutions to create new solutions representing potential combinations of concentrations. The mutation operator introduced random changes or perturbations to the genetic material within the solutions. This randomness helped to explore the search space and prevent premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. In our case, the mutation operator modified the concentrations of phytohormones in the solutions to introduce novel combinations. The termination criteria determined when the GA should stop searching for optimal solutions. Common termination criteria include reaching a maximum number of generations, achieving a desired fitness threshold, or reaching a predefined computational time limit.\nWe utilized previously published Matlab codes [41] to develop ANN and GA algorithms, as\nwell as to conduct sensitivity analysis in our study."

Our findings revealed significant variations in callus formation and growth in response to different hormone concentrations (Table 1). Notably, the absence of\nphytohormones in the culture medium resulted in the complete absence of callus formation. This highlights the essential role of exogenous hormones in promoting callus induction in petunia.\nAmong the tested phytohormones, BAP and IBA demonstrated a pronounced effect on cal-\nlus formation. The highest callus formation rate of 92.86\u00b14.611% was achieved with a combination of 1.5 mg/L BAP and 1.5 mg/L IBA (Table 1). This concentration resulted in a substantial increase in callus initiation and development. Additionally, the fresh weight of the callus reached 1.79\u00b10.035 g, indicating robust growth and biomass accumulation (Table 1). In addition, varying concentrations of KIN and NAA exhibited different effects on callus formation rate or fresh weight of callus. 2 mg/L KIN along with 2 mg/L NAA resulted in higher callus formation rate (85.71\u00b17.435%) in comparison with other concentrations of these phytohormones (Table 1). Overall, our results demonstrate that the presence and specific concentrations of phytohormones significantly influence callus formation in petunia tissue culture. The combination of 1.5 mg/L BAP and 1.5 mg/L IBA emerged as the most effective hormonal treatment, yielding the highest callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus.

This indicates that approximately 80.1% and 82.7% of the variability in the callus formation rate and callus fresh weight, respectively, could be explained by the input variables.

Additionally, the MBE values of 0.824 and 0.008 indicate a slight positive bias in the predictions, indicating a slight tendency to overestimate the callus formation rate and callus fresh weight, respectively (Table 2).

The dominance of IBA highlights its critical role in promoting callus formation and growth, while the contributions of NAA, BAP, and KIN emphasize the involvement of auxins and cytokinins in the callogenesis process. These results contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing tissue culture and provide a foundation for optimizing phytohormone concentrations to enhance callogenesis efficiency in petunia tissue culture protocols.\nOptimization of the phytohormone concentrations for maximizing callogenesis\nThe present study aimed to optimize the callus formation rate and callus fresh weight in a tissue culture system using a genetic algorithm. The optimization process involved the manipulation of four phytohormones (i.e., BAP, KIN, NAA, and IBA). Through the genetic algorithm, the combination of 1.31 mg/L BAP, 1.02 mg/L KIN, 1.44 mg/L NAA, and 1.70 mg/L IBA was identified to yield a remarkable callus formation rate of 95.83% (Table 4). Additionally, another combination of 1.39 mg/L BAP, 0.81 mg/L KIN, 1.22 mg/L NAA, and 1.60 mg/L IBA resulted in a substantial callus fresh weight of 1.80 g (Table 4). These findings highlight the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in optimizing the tissue culture system for enhanced callus formation and biomass accumulation. The results provide valuable insights for the development of efficient protocols for plant tissue culture and can contribute to the improvement of various applications such as plant propagation and genetic transformation.\nConfirming the results of the optimization process through the validation experiment\nThe optimized combinations of phytohormones obtained through the genetic algorithm were further validated in a laboratory experiment to assess the reliability of the predicted results. The results of the validation experiment demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the validation results and the optimized results obtained through the genetic algorithm for both callus formation rate (96.43\u00b13.571) (Fig 1C) and callus fresh weight (1.86 \u00b10.065) (Fig 1D). This confirms the reliability and accuracy of the genetic algorithm in predicting optimal PGR combinations for achieving high callus formation rates and callus fresh weights. The validation experiment provides strong support for the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm as a powerful tool in optimizing tissue culture systems. These findings have practical implications for the development of efficient protocols for plant tissue culture, enabling enhanced callus production and biomass accumulation for various applications such as plant propagation and genetic transformation."

            "text": "Callus formation plays a critical role in plant regeneration, genetic transformation, and secondary metabolite production, making it a crucial step in plant biotechnology applications [31, 42, 43]. However, the factors influencing callus induction and growth in Petunia are multifaceted and interconnected, making it challenging to predict and control this process using traditional methods [20]. Therefore, the application of machine learning techniques offers a promising avenue for uncovering the underlying mechanisms and facilitating the optimization of callus formation protocols in Petunia. The reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach in modeling and predicting various in vitro culture systems have been previously approved in different species such as cannabis [29, 32, 44\u201348], chickpea [49], ajowan [38], Prunus rootstock [50\u201352], chrysanthemum [27, 53\u201357], pear rootstock [58\u201360], Passiflora caerulea [28, 61], wheat [62], wallflower [63], walnut [64], and tomato [31].\nIn our study, we explored the performance of three different machine learning algorithms,\nnamely MLP, RBF, and GRNN, for modeling and predicting callogenesis in petunia tissue culture. By considering different concentrations of four phytohormones (BAP, KIN, NAA, and IBA) as input variables and the callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus as output variables, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of these ML approaches in capturing the underlying patterns and optimizing the callogenesis process.\nThe results of our evaluation emphasize the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in cap-\nturing the relationships between phytohormone concentrations and callogenesis in petunia tissue culture. The GRNN model displayed the best overall performance, followed closely by the RBF and MLP models. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning techniques in optimizing tissue culture protocols by accurately predicting callogenesis. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the selection of appropriate algorithms for future studies and practical applications in petunia tissue culture. Firstly, the GRNN model is known for its ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data due to its non-linear nature [65]. It uses a radial basis function activation function, which allows it to approximate any continuous function with high accuracy [66]. This flexibility enables the GRNN model to effectively capture the intricate relationships between the concentrations of phytohormones and callogenesis [21] in petunia tissue culture. In contrast, the MLP model, while capable of modeling non-linear relationships, may struggle with highly complex patterns and may require more hidden layers and neurons to achieve similar performance [63]. Secondly, the GRNN model has a unique architecture that inherently possesses memory [62]. It can store\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293754 November 3, 2023 12 / 18\nand recall previously encountered patterns, which aids in generalization and prediction [21]. This memory-based approach allows the GRNN model to make predictions based on the similarities between the input patterns in the training set and the new data points [46]. This characteristic is particularly beneficial in the context of callogenesis prediction in petunia tissue culture, where historical data and patterns play a crucial role [20]. In contrast, the RBF model and MLP model lack this explicit memory capability, which may limit their ability to effectively capture long-term dependencies and generalize well to new data [66].\nFurthermore, the GRNN model is relatively less prone to overfitting, a common issue in\nmachine learning models [28]. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise and variability present in the training data rather than the underlying patterns and relationships [39]. The GRNN model\u2019s smoothing parameter, also known as the spread, helps control the model\u2019s generalization ability by determining the width of the radial basis functions [29]. This parameter acts as a regularization mechanism, preventing the model from fitting the training data too closely and thereby improving its ability to generalize to unseen data. This regularization property contributes to the robustness and accuracy of the GRNN model in predicting callogenesis [21].\nBy employing sensitivity analysis, we were able to identify the relative importance of the dif-\nferent phytohormones in regulating callogenesis [50, 67]. This information can guide the optimization of tissue culture protocols by focusing on the most influential variables. Additionally, the VSR values can assist in understanding the underlying mechanisms of callogenesis and provide valuable insights for further investigations and improvements in petunia tissue culture techniques. The sensitivity analysis was performed by calculating the sensitivity ratio for each phytohormone, which quantifies the contribution of each factor to the overall variation in the callogenesis parameters [29]. The analysis demonstrated that IBA had the most significant impact on both the callus formation rate and the callus fresh weight. This finding suggests that IBA plays a pivotal role in regulating the proliferation and growth of callus tissue in petunia. It may promote cell division and expansion, thereby enhancing the formation of callus tissue [9].\nFollowing IBA, the sensitivity analysis revealed that NAA ranked second in terms of impor-\ntance for callogenesis. NAA is known for its auxin-like properties, and its influence on callus formation rate and callus fresh weight underscores the significance of auxin in regulating tissue growth and differentiation [9]. BAP, a cytokinin, was found to be the third most important factor. Cytokinins are essential for cell division and differentiation, and their presence in the culture medium has been shown to stimulate callus initiation and growth [6\u20138, 68]. Finally, KIN, another cytokinin, exhibited the least importance among the four phytohormones studied. Although less influential than the other factors, KIN still contributed to the callogenesis process in petunia tissue culture.\nThe result of the optimization process through genetic algorithm showed that the combina-\ntion of 1.31 mg/L BAP, 1.02 mg/L KIN, 1.44 mg/L NAA, and 1.70 mg/L IBA would result in a 95.83% callus formation rate. The results shed light on the role of these phytohormones in regulating callogenesis and provide valuable insights for optimizing tissue culture protocols in petunia propagation and plant improvement. Firstly, the effect of BAP on callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus was prominent in our study. Higher concentrations of BAP demonstrated a stimulatory effect on callogenesis, resulting in increased callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus [6\u20138]. This observation aligns with previous studies indicating the positive role of BAP as a cytokinin in promoting cell division and differentiation [6\u20138]. In addition to BAP, the influence of KIN on callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus was also examined. Our findings revealed that KIN exhibited a more nuanced effect compared to BAP. At lower concentrations, KIN had limited impact on callogenesis parameters. However, as the concentration increased, KIN demonstrated a dose-dependent response, leading to enhanced callus formation rate and fresh weight of callus. This suggests that KIN might play a\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293754 November 3, 2023 13 / 18\nrole in modulating cell division and proliferation processes during callogenesis [9, 69, 70]. Moreover, our study explored the effect of NAA and IBA, two auxins, on callus formation rate and callus fresh weight in petunia. These findings align with previous studies [6\u20139] highlighting the role of auxins in promoting cell proliferation and callogenesis."
