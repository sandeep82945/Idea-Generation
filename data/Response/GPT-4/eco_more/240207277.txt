Comparative Studies Across States or Countries: Conduct comparative studies on the effects of demand bundling in different geographical areas or educational systems. This could involve analyzing similar programs in other states or countries to understand how varying regulatory, economic, and technological environments impact the effectiveness of demand aggregation strategies for internet procurement.

Long-term Impact on Educational Outcomes: Investigate the long-term impacts of improved internet access on educational outcomes. This could include research on student performance, digital literacy, and the ability of schools to integrate technology into the curriculum over time. Assessing whether and how enhanced internet connectivity contributes to closing the digital divide and improving equity in education would be crucial.

Economic Analysis of Network Effects and Market Dynamics: Explore the economic effects of demand bundling on internet service providers (ISPs) and the broadband market, including analyses of market competition, network effects, and the sustainability of lower prices and higher speeds. Understanding how these dynamics affect ISPs' willingness to participate in such programs and their investment in infrastructure could provide insights for policy design.

Demand Function and Welfare Analysis: Further research could focus on estimating the demand function for broadband internet in schools more precisely. With detailed data on price sensitivities and preferences for different bandwidth levels, researchers could provide a more nuanced analysis of welfare changes resulting from demand bundling programs. This could help in designing programs that maximize the welfare gains for schools with different needs and constraints.

Policy Design and Implementation Challenges: Delve into the challenges and best practices in designing and implementing demand bundling programs. This could include qualitative research on the administrative and logistical hurdles faced by schools and governments, strategies for encouraging participation, and the role of federal and state policies in supporting or hindering such initiatives. Understanding these factors could lead to recommendations for improving the efficacy and efficiency of procurement processes for public institutions.
