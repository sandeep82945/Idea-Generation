            "text": "Report\nTo the Editor: In 1954, Joseph Murray performed a kidney transplantation between monozygotic twins, which is regarded as the first long-term successful kidney transplantation worldwide.1 The organ survived for 8 years. In 1962, the first successful deceaseddonor kidney transplantation between genetically unrelated patients aided by immunosuppression allowed for significantly increased numbers of transplantations worldwide.1 In 1968, the first kidney transplantation in the University Hospital of Groningen, The Netherlands was performed.2 Three years later, this center\u2019s 20th kidney was transplanted to the 30-year old female who is the subject of this report.\nThe patient had been on dialysis for 4 months, with biopsy-proven autosomal dominant Alport\u2019s syndrome as the underlying kidney disease. She received a kidney from a 22-year old donor who died from traumatic injuries. The surgical procedure was successful. In the weeks after transplantation, kidney function improved. The patient was discharged 2 months after transplantation.\nDuring the following years, kidney function remained stable, with azathioprine and prednisolone for immunosuppressive maintenance. Every additional 5 years of graft survival were considered a milestone, and were celebrated as such by the patient, who brought cake for the entire department. Treating physicians were struck by the sustained excellent kidney graft function (Figure 1). The patient survived more than 50 years after transplantation, relatively unbothered by her kidney disease. She recently passed away after a long and meaningful life. In the Supplementary Materials, the perspectives of the patient\u2019s sister, as well as those of her former nephrologist and dialysis nurse (both retired for years) are described extensively. Notably, all of them mention the patient\u2019s optimism, humor, and wittiness as the key to her graft survival.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a case with a deceased-donor kidney graft survival of over 50 years in the medical literature. This is absolutely remarkable, especially considering that kidney transplantation was still in its infancy in the early 1970s;\nKidney International Reports (2023) 8, 1123\u20131124\nreports from the late 1970s suggest 5-year graft survival rates <30%.3 All in all, this case of half a century of deceased-donor kidney graft survival is unique and shows the potential longevity of deceaseddonor kidneys.\nDISCLOSURE All the authors declared no competing interests.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS We gratefully acknowledge the kind help we received in the writing of this report from the patient\u2019s sister and brother in law, as well as the patient\u2019s former treating nephrologist Dr. Hein Jordans and dialysis nurse Ms. Aly Wolsink. Their hospitality, openheartedness, and the nice conversations we had are greatly appreciated.\nFunding The authors received no support/funding relevant to this work.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Supplementary File (PDF) Perspectives of the patient\u2019s sister, former treating nephrologist and dialysis nurse.\n1.
