 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of consumer behavior on the live streaming ecosystem by incorporating consumers as an additional subject in the evolutionary game model. This could provide insights into how consumer actions affect value co-creation.

2. Conduct empirical research to validate the theoretical evolutionary game model proposed in the paper. For example, survey live streaming anchors, suppliers, and platforms to see if their actual behaviors align with the model predictions. 

3. Explore how different platform governance mechanisms, like reputation systems, content moderation, etc., could be incorporated into the model to study their impact.

4. Investigate whether the model findings hold in different cultural contexts outside of China. Cross-cultural factors may influence behaviors.

5. Expand the model to account for additional real-world complexities, like asymmetric information between subjects, repeated interactions over time, and heterogeneous agent types. This could reveal new insights about strategy evolution.
