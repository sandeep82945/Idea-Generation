    "abstractText": "Background Traditional herbal medicine has been used for centuries to cure many pathological disorders, including cancer. Thymoquinone (TQ) and piperine (PIP) are major bioactive constituents of the black seed (Nigella sativa) and black pepper (Piper nigrum), respectively. The current study aimed to explore the potential chemo\u2010modulatory effects, mechanisms of action, molecular targets, and binding interactions after TQ and PIP treatments and their combination with sorafenib (SOR) against human triple\u2010negative breast cancer (MDA\u2010MB\u2010231) and liver cancer (HepG2) cells. Methods We determined drug cytotoxicity by MTT assay, cell cycle, and death mechanism by flow cytometry. Besides, the potential effect of TQ, PIP, and SOR treatment on genome methylation and acetylation by determination of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3B), histone deacetylase (HDAC3) and miRNA\u201029c expression levels. Finally, a molecu\u2010 lar docking study was performed to propose potential mechanisms of action and binding affinity of TQ, PIP, and SOR with DNMT3B and HDAC3. Results Collectively, our data show that combinations of TQ and/or PIP with SOR have significantly enhanced the SOR anti\u2010proliferative and cytotoxic effects depending on the dose and cell line by enhancing G2/M phase arrest, inducing apoptosis, downregulation of DNMT3B and HDAC3 expression and upregulation of the tumor suppressor, miRNA\u201029c. Finally, the molecular docking study has identified strong interactions between SOR, PIP, and TQ with DNMT3B and HDAC3, inhibiting their normal oncogenic activities and leading to growth arrest and cell death. Conclusion This study reported TQ and PIP as enhancers of the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of SOR and addressed the mechanisms, and identified molecular targets involved in their action.",

Besides, the potential effect of TQ, PIP, and SOR treatment on genome methylation and acetylation by determination of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3B), histone deacetylase (HDAC3) and miRNA\u201129c expression levels. Finally, a molecu\u2011 lar docking study was performed to propose potential mechanisms of action and binding affinity of TQ, PIP, and SOR with DNMT3B and HDAC3.\nResults Collectively, our data show that combinations of TQ and/or PIP with SOR have significantly enhanced the SOR anti\u2011proliferative and cytotoxic effects depending on the dose and cell line by enhancing G2/M phase arrest, inducing apoptosis, downregulation of DNMT3B and HDAC3 expression and upregulation of the tumor suppressor, miRNA\u201129c. Finally, the molecular docking study has identified strong interactions between SOR, PIP, and TQ with DNMT3B and HDAC3, inhibiting their normal oncogenic activities and leading to growth arrest and cell death.\nConclusion This study reported TQ and PIP as enhancers of the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of SOR and addressed the mechanisms, and identified molecular targets involved in their action.\nKeywords Thymoquinone, Piperine, Sorafenib, Epigenetic, Molecular docking\n\u2020Alaa Elmetwalli, Ali H.

            "text": "Cancer is a global burden and is ranked as one of the major causes of death especially in low-income nations [1]. Globally, liver cancer is the 6th most common and the third leading cause of cancer mortality (8.3%) after lung (18.0%) and colorectal (9.4%) cancer, with the highest incidence rates found in Asia and Africa [2]. On the other hand, worldwide, breast cancer has now exceeded lung cancer in incidence, with approximately 2.3 million new cases in 2020 and 685,000 deaths [3].\nChemotherapy is one of the major treatment patterns for cancer, used alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. Chemo-drugs kill cancer cells by interfering with the cell cycle regulating genes, therefore, inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, leading to cell death mainly by apoptosis [4\u20136]. Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy suffer from mild side effects, such as alopecia, constipation, and fatigue, to serious ones, such as sterility, cardiotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, reducing these side effects would contribute to a better lifestyle for these patients [7].\nSorafenib (SOR), doxorubicin, and cisplatin are the most used chemotherapeutic agents suitable for patients with liver and breast cancer. Sorafenib is a protein kinase inhibitor that is active against various protein kinases. In 2008, the US FDA approved SOR (NEXAVAR\u00ae) for treating patients with liver and advanced kidney cancers [8]. SOR has well-known anticancer potential (Supplementary File 1), as stated in the CTD database (http:// ctdba se. org/). Also, it is used as a therapy for about 890 cancer clinical trials (Supplementary File 2), as recognized in the clinical trials database (https:// clini caltr ials. gov/).\nNatural products derived from plants have always been used to treat various diseases and most of the present anticancer drugs use active ingredients extracted from plant sources [9\u201313].\u00a0 These compounds usually exert their effect through several mechanisms such as\nactivation of apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of angiogenesis [14].\nThymoquinone (TQ) is a major bioactive constituent of the black seed (Nigella sativa) [15], it has shown different anticancer activities through cell proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis induction in cancer cells, the possible mechanisms of TQ anticancer activity against various proliferative cancer cells were summarized in the review article by El-Far [16]. Interestingly, TQ was reported to have a significant selectivity against various malignant cells [17\u201321]. The anticancer potential and clinical trials of TQ were stated in Supplementary File 3 and Supplementary File 4, respectively. The taxonomic hierarchy of Nigella sativa L. is shown in Table\u00a01 [22].\nPiperine (PIP) is the major bioactive alkaloid found in black (Piper nigrum), white and long pepper (Piper longum), it has several actions, including anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties [23]. The anticancer potential and clinical trials of TQ were stated in Supplementary File 5 and Supplementary File 6, respectively. Also, the taxonomic hierarchy of Piper nigrum [24] and Piper longum [25] is shown in Table\u00a01.\nThis study examined the potential inhibitory effect of TQ, PIP, and SOR against human triple-negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, molecular targets and mechanisms involved in such activities were also investigated."

            "text": "SOR was the first systemic compound prescribed by US FDA that significantly increased the survival rate for liver cancer patients [32]. However, the one major disadvantage of SOR is its high toxicity, especially at high doses [33]. Therefore, testing new natural\nagents that might enhance its effects and allow lower doses, would potentially minimize this toxicity [34]. TQ and PIP are two natural compounds commonly used for medicinal purposes [35, 36]. To the best of our knowledge, combining TQ or PIP with SOR has not been investigated. One study on breast carcinoma xenograft reported a combination between TQ and PIP [37]. In the current study, we showed that combinations of TQ and/or PIP with SOR have significantly enhanced the latter anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects in both HepG2 and MDA-MB231 cells with variable potency. Overall, HepG2 cells were more responsive to PIP or SOR since both compounds showed lower IC50 values compared with MDA-MB231 cells. This finding agrees with the fact that SOR is prescribed mainly in the\ntreatment of hepatocellular carcinomas [38]. Interestingly, the IC50 values for SOR were significantly diminished in both HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells (up to 85% and 75%, respectively) after combined treatment with TQ and/or PIP at different doses. As a consequence, to reduce clinical doses and reduce the common side effects associated with high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs, it is crucial to decrease the 50% inhibitory cytotoxic dose of the chemotherapeutic drug SOR while maintaining its overall cytotoxicity. This could be done through the actions of the natural compounds TQ and PIP.\nTQ and PIP alone treatments showed anti-proliferative effects, which agrees with previous studies that reported a decrease in viability of lymphocyte leukaemia cells when treated with TQ [39]. Another study showed that TQ reduced the cell viability of the Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line in a dose-dependent manner [40]. On the other hand, Greenshields et\u00a0 al. observed that PIP reduced the proliferation and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells [41].\nMany recent reports, including the current study, indicated promising chemo-modulatory actions of TQ when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents used against various cancers [42, 43]. In 2020, it was reported that TQ enhanced docetaxel efficiency in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by reducing its effective dose [44]. Moreover, TQ synergistically improved the anticancer activity of doxorubicin and cisplatin in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells [45]. Similarly, PIP was also reported to exert chemo-modulatory effects on chemotherapeutic drugs in different cancers [46, 47].\nWe have investigated the potential mechanisms causing this anti-proliferative effect, such as modulation of cell cycle interphase, cell death (apoptosis vs. necrosis), and epigenetic genome modifications. The cell cycle is vital in maintaining cell growth and tissue homeostasis, abnormalities in cell cycle progression results in\nserious diseases, including cancer [48]. We showed that SOR single treatment has resulted in significant G2/M cell cycle arrest in HepG2 and MDA-MB231 cells, which agrees with a previous study that was performed on Hep3B, HepG2, PLC-PRF-5, and SK-Hep1, human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines [49]. However, other studies reported SOR to arrest cells at G0/G1 phase [50, 51]. Similar to SOR and TQ caused a significant G2/M arrest, TQ was previously reported to cause a G2/M phase arrest in HepG2 cells [52]. However, others have reported that exposure of HepG2 cells to TQ arrested cells at the G0/G1 phase [53]. Depending on the cell line under investigation and tumor behaviour, PIP and TQ were previously suggested to cause cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M phases by binding to different cell cycle regulatory proteins [54, 55]. This observation explains the different cell cycle arrest phases that might be observed using the same compound.\nImpaired apoptosis is reported as one of the mechanisms leading to SOR resistance in cancer cells and the antiapoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma 2, is suggested to modulate this phenomenon [50]. Many reports have attributed the anticancer effects of TQ and PIP to its selective proapoptotic actions through the regulation of p53, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and B-cell lymphoma 2 equilibrium and activation of the caspase enzymes [46, 56]. We have examined the apoptotic and necrotic cell death after individual and combined TQ, PIP, and SOR treatment. Notably, necrosis-related cell death was the most observed cause of cell death in HepG2 cells regardless of the treatment. In contrast, in MDA-MB231 cells, apoptotic cell death was prevalent in TQ and SOR single treatments and triple TQ + PIP + SOR treatments.\nInterestingly, a combination of TQ or PIP with SOR increased the population of necrotic cells by 6.5 and 8 folds, respectively, compared to SOR alone treatment. Such data might be important in future combination therapy studies aiming to bypass apoptosis as a major cell\nTable 4 Docking score of thymoquinone (TQ), piperine (PIP), and sorafenib (SOR) against DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3B) (target site PDB ID: 6KDL\u2011A), histone deacetylase (HDAC3) (target site PDB ID: 4A69\u2011A), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor\u20112 (VEGFR\u20112) (target site PDB ID:3V2A\u2011A)\nName of the ligand\nDNMT3B (target site PDB ID: 6KDL\u2011A) HDAC3(target site PDB ID: 4A69\u2011A) VEGFR\u20112 (target site PDB ID:3V2A\u2011A)\nBinding Free Energy (kcal/ mol) pKi Ligand Efficiency (kcal/ mol/non\u2011H atom) Binding Free Energy (kcal/ mol) pKi Ligand Efficiency (kcal/ mol/non\u2011H atom) Binding Free Energy (kcal/ mol) pKi Ligand Efficiency (kcal/mol/non\u2011H atom)\nThymoquinone (TQ) \u20115.9 4.33 0.4917 \u20115.4 3.96 0.45 \u20115.1 3.74 0.425\nPiperine (PIP) \u20117.1 5.21 0.3381 \u20116.5 4.77 0.3095 \u20116.4 4.69 0.3048 Sorafenib (SOR) \u20118.8 6.45 0.275 \u20117.9 5.79 0.2469 \u20117.4 5.43 0.2313\ndeath mechanism in SOR-resistant cancer cells. Bypassing cancer drug resistance by induction of necroptosis is under clinical investigation as a promising therapeutic mechanism against apoptosis-resistant cancer cells [57].\nThe current study showed that both TQ and PIP potentiated the anti-HDAC3 and anti-DNMT3B effect of SOR, causing a significant drop in HDAC3 and DNMT3B expression levels. HDACs and DNMT3B act as transcriptional repressors for tumor suppressor genes, high mRNA levels of HDAC3 and DNMT3B are associated with poor prognosis in patients with different types of cancer [58, 59]. Combination therapy with histone deacetylases (HDACi) or (DNMT3B) inhibitors are currently under investigation for achieving a full cancer therapeutic potential [60, 61]. Several studies have already reported the synergistic effects of treatment with HDACi and various chemotherapeutic drugs [62, 63]. SOR, TQ, and PIP were reported to act as HDACi and DNMT3B inhibitors [64\u201366]. Furthermore, molecular docking revealed that TQ, PIP, and SOR formed hydrophobic and hydrogen\nbonds with DNMT3B and HDACi, indicating their affinity for inhibiting DNMT3B and HDACi.\nIn the same way, TQ, PIP, and SOR can bind effectively to VEGFR-2 and inhibit angiogenesis. More research is needed to figure out how TQ, PIP, SOR, and their combinations affect cancer angiogenesis.\nThe miR-29C has been identified as a crucial miRNA in several cancers; it regulates several oncogenic processes, including epigenetics. The miR-29 family was reported to function as tumor suppressor microRNA through sponging DNMT3A and DNMT3B. However, the biological activity of miR-29C in cancer development and progression is still disputed, most studies reported miR-29C as a tumor suppressor, and others suggested it acts as an oncogene [67]. miR-29b levels were oppositely related to HDAC levels in\u00a0 vitro and human tissue [68]. To the best of our knowledge, the\neffect of SOR, TQ, and PIP on miR-29C expression levels was not investigated before; the current study confirmed the tumor suppressor role of miR-29C since all our treatments have caused a significant increase in miR-29C expression levels with the highest increase detected in PIP alone (53-fold in HepG2) and PIP + TQ (58-fold in MDA-MB-231).\nThe molecular docking study was based on assessing the binding energy and binding affinity of ligand-receptor interactions as reflected by the docking score in kcal/mol. A lower docking score indicates a higher binding affinity. The molecular docking results showed a strong affinity\nof SOR to DNMT3B, and HDAC3, followed by PIP and then TQ.\nDNA methylation occurs almost exclusively in CpG islands in mammals catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNMT1 has been shown to maintain methylation in somatic cells, and DNMT3a and DNMT3B are thought to be involved in de novo DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells and early embryos. It was recently found that DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3B are overexpressed in several human tumors, compared to levels in corresponding normal tissues [69\u201371]. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that the anticancer properties of bioactive components (i.e., parthenolide, folate, retinoids, etc.) may be attributed to its influence on epigenetic processes through binding to DNMT1 enzymatic centre or/and disrupting\u00a0 DNMT\u00a0 transcription [72]. Inhibiting DNMT3B with RNA interference or a selective DNMT3B inhibitor effectively suppressed the DNMT3B activity in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Our docking study showed strong binding between SOR, PIP, and TQ to DNMT3B, which inhibited DNMT3B activity. This finding agrees with another study that showed that DNMT3B inhibitor showed a synergistic effect with SOR in the SOR-resistant Hep3B cells [73].\nGenome acetylation is one of the most important epigenetic modifications in promoters of genes that regulate the cell cycle, differentiation, cell growth, and survival in cancer [74]. The acetylation of active genes is controlled by the expression and activity of HDAC [75]. Recently, several reports have shown some\u00a0dietary phytochemicals\u00a0as HDAC inhibitors [76\u2013 78]. HDAC inhibitors lead to increased histone acetylation and transcriptional upregulation of gene expression, inducing cancer cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and necrosis in a variety of transformed cell lines by several mechanisms depending on the cancer type; HDAC inhibitors, and doses [79]. We showed strong binding between SOR, PIP, and TQ to HDAC, which would probably inhibit HDAC biological activity through disrupting protein\u2013protein interactions important for HDAC activity, as recently suggested [80]. Induction of apoptosis seems to be the predominant route of HDACi-induced cell death [81]; this agrees with our data showing apoptosis as the main cell death mechanism in PIP-treated HepG2 cells."
