 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Extend the weighted Myerson value to other types of network structures besides undirected networks, such as directed networks or hypergraphs. This could allow modeling more complex relationships among players.

2. Investigate other solution concepts from cooperative game theory besides the Myerson value, and define weighted versions of them for network games. This could provide alternative fair allocation rules. 

3. Study how different choices of weights, based on various centrality measures, impact the resulting allocations given by the weighted Myerson value. This could reveal insights about the roles of players.

4. Consider dynamic network games where the underlying network structure evolves over time. Define weighted Myerson values for this setting. This could model real-world situations better.

5. Explore bidding mechanisms for other solution concepts in network games besides the Myerson value. The analysis may reveal new properties about the strategic incentives of players.
