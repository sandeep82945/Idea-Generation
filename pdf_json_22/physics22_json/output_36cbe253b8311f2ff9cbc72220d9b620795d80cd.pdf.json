    "abstractText": "Contact geometry allows us to describe some thermodynamic and dissipative systems. In this paper we introduce a new geometric structure in order to describe time-dependent contact systems: cocontact manifolds. Within this setting we develop the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms, both in the regular and singular cases. In the singular case, we present a constraint algorithm aiming to find a submanifold where solutions exist. As a particular case we study contact systems with holonomic time-dependent constraints. Some regular and singular examples are analyzed, along with numerical simulations.",

            "text": "In the last decades, the interest in the formalism and applications of differential geometric structures to the study ofmathematical physics and dynamical systems has risen drastically [1, 3, 29, 39]. The natural geometric framework for autonomous conservative mechanical systems, both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian, is symplectic geometry and the variational approach is based on Hamilton\u2019s variational principle. For nonautonomous systems [11, 21, 24, 38, 43] the same variational principle is valid, but the underlying geometry is cosymplectic geometry [2, 10, 13]. Time-dependent systems can also be geometrically formulated as the Reeb dynamics of a contact system. Both symplectic and cosymplectic structures are particular instances of Poisson geometry [22, 39, 50].\nRecently, the application of contact geometry to the study of dynamical systems has grown significantly [4, 18, 26]. This is due to the fact that contact geometry is not only a way to geometrically model the time-dependency in mechanical systems [23], which can also be done by means of cosymplectic geometry, but it also allows us to describe mechanical systems with certain types of damping, quantummechanics [14],\ncircuit theory [31], control theory [45] and thermodynamics [5, 48], among many others [41]. In recent papers [7, 8], the authors consider time-dependent systems, although a rigorous geometric description of time-dependent contact mechanics is in order. These systems include mechanical systems with time-dependent external forces and, in particular, controlled systems whose controls can be used to compensate the damping.\nLet us recall that the variational approach to contact systems is based on Herglotz\u2019s principle [36] (see for instance [15\u201317]). This variational principle generalizes the Hamilton principle and it is appropriate to deal with action-dependent Lagrangians. From the geometric perspective, it is important to point out that contact structures are not Poisson, but Jacobi. This is due to the fact that the Leibniz rule is not fulfilled [18].\nIn the present paper, we develop a formalism in order to geometrically describe contact mechanical systems with explicit time-dependence. We begin by introducing a new geometric structure: cocontact manifolds. These manifolds extend the notion of both contact and cosymplectic structures. We study the properties of these manifolds, exhibit some examples, prove a Darboux-type theorem for these structures, and show that cocontact manifolds are Jacobi manifolds. In addition, we introduce the notion of cocontact orthogonal complement of a submanifold and define and characterize the coisotropic and Legendrian submanifolds of a cocontact manifold. This geometric framework is later used to develop both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of time-dependent mechanical systems with dissipation.\nThe introduction of time-dependence makes us consider systems subjected to constraints that can vary with time. Such systems can be described by introducing the constraints in the Lagrangian via Lagrange multipliers. These Lagrangians are obviously singular, since the velocity associated to the Lagrange multipliers do not appear in the expression of the Lagrangian. In order to study such systems, we introduce the notion of precocontact structure as a weakened version of a cocontact structure, and describe a suitable constraint algorithm.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the geometrical setting that will be used throughout the paper. We present the notion of cocontact manifold and some examples. In particular, we see that cocontact manifolds are Jacobi manifolds, and thus all the theory about Jacobi structures is applicable to cocontact structures. Section 3 is devoted to develop a Hamiltonian formulation for dissipative time-dependent systems, while Sect. 4 dedicated to develop the Lagrangian formulation for cocontact systems and state the associated generalized Herglotz\u2013Euler\u2013Lagrange equations. In Sect. 5 we study the case of mechanical systems described by singular time-dependent contact Lagrangians and give a description of the constraint algorithm to obtain the dynamics in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations. Section 6 is devoted to analyze the case of damped mechanical systems with holonomic constraints which can depend on time. Finally, in Sect. 7, three examples are presented and worked out: the damped forced harmonic oscillator, a system with time-dependent mass subjected to a central force with friction, and the damped pendulum with variable length. We also show and discuss some simulations of these systems.\nThroughout the paper all the manifolds and mappings are assumed to be smooth and second-countable. Sum over crossed repeated indices is understood."

            "text": "Definition 2.1 LetM be amanifold of dimension 2n+2. A cocontact structure onM is a couple (\u03c4, \u03b7) of 1-forms onM such that \u03c4 is closed and such that \u03c4 \u2227\u03b7\u2227(d\u03b7)\u2227n is a volume form onM . Under these hypotheses, (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) is called a cocontactmanifold.\nWe can see from this definition that every cocontact manifold has two tangent distributions. The first one is generated by ker \u03c4 , is integrable, and gives a foliation made of contact leaves. The other one is ker \u03b7 and it is not integrable. This structure will be very useful when proving the Darboux theorem.\nExample 2.2 Let (P, \u03b70) be a contact manifold and consider the product manifold M = R\u00d7 P . Denoting by dt the pullback to M of the volume form in R and denoting by \u03b7 the pullback of \u03b70 to M , we have that (dt, \u03b7) is a cocontact structure on M . Example 2.3 Let (P, \u03c4,\u2212d\u03b8) be an exact cosymplectic manifold and consider the product manifold M = P \u00d7 R. Denoting by s the coordinate in R we define the 1-form \u03b7 = ds \u2212 \u03b8 . Then, (\u03c4, \u03b7) is a cocontact structure on M = P \u00d7 R. Example 2.4 (Canonical cocontact manifold) Let Q be an n-dimensional smoothmanifold with local coordinates (qi ) and its cotangent bundle T\u2217Q with induced natural coordinates (qi , pi ). Consider the product manifolds R \u00d7 T\u2217Q with coordinates (t, qi , pi ), T\u2217Q \u00d7 R with coordinates (qi , pi , s) and R \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R with coordinates (t, qi , pi , s) and the canonical projections\nR \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R\nR \u00d7 T\u2217Q T\u2217Q \u00d7 R\nT\u2217Q\n\u03c11 \u03c12\n\u03c0\n\u03c02 \u03c01\nLet \u03b80 \u2208 1(T\u2217Q) be the canonical 1-form of the cotangent bundle, which has local expression \u03b80 = pidqi . Denoting by \u03b82 = \u03c0\u22172 \u03b8 , we have that (dt, \u03b82) is a cosymplectic structure in R \u00d7 T\u2217Q.\nOn the other hand, denoting by \u03b81 = \u03c0\u22171 \u03b80, we have that \u03b71 = ds \u2212 \u03b81 is a contact form in T\u2217Q \u00d7 R.\nFinally, consider the 1-form \u03b8 = \u03c1\u22171\u03b82 = \u03c1\u22172\u03b81 = \u03c0\u2217\u03b80 \u2208 1(R \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R) and let \u03b7 = ds \u2212 \u03b8 . Then, (dt, \u03b7) is a cocontact structure in R \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R. The local expression of the 1-form \u03b7 is\n\u03b7 = ds \u2212 pidqi . Proposition 2.5 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a cocontact manifold. We have the following isomorphism of vector bundles:\n: TM \u2212\u2192 T\u2217M v \u2212\u2192 (i(v)\u03c4 )\u03c4 + i(v)d\u03b7 + (i(v)\u03b7) \u03b7\nProof It is clear that ker = 0, since M is a cocontact manifold. Hence, it follows that has to be an isomorphism.\nThis isomorphism can be extended to an isomorphism of C\u221e(M)-modules:\n: X(M) \u2212\u2192 1(M) X \u2212\u2192 (i(X)\u03c4 )\u03c4 + i(X)d\u03b7 + (i(X)\u03b7) \u03b7\nProposition 2.6 Given a cocontact manifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7), there exist two vector fields Rt , Rs \u2208 X(M), called Reeb vector fields, satisfying the conditions\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9 i(Rt )\u03c4 = 1 , i(Rt )\u03b7 = 0 , i(Rt )d\u03b7 = 0 ,\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9 i(Rs)\u03c4 = 0 , i(Rs)\u03b7 = 1 , i(Rs)d\u03b7 = 0 .\nRt is the time Reeb vector field and Rs is the contact Reeb vector field.\nTaking into account the isomorphism introduced above, we can give an alternative definition of the Reeb vector fields:\nRt = \u22121(\u03c4 ) , Rs = \u22121(\u03b7) .\nTheorem 2.7 (Darboux theorem for cocontact manifolds) Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a cocontact manifold. Then, for every point p \u2208 M, there exists a local chart (U ; t, qi , pi , s) around p such that\n\u03c4 |U = dt , \u03b7|U = ds \u2212 pidqi .\nThese coordinates are called canonical or Darboux coordinates. Moreover, in Darboux coordinates, the Reeb vector fields are\nRt |U = \u2202 \u2202t , Rs |U = \u2202 \u2202s .\nProof The idea of the proof is the following: in every cocontact manifold there is a contact foliation made of leaves of the distribution generated by ker \u03c4 (which are (2n+1)-submanifolds) and, on each of them, the restriction of\u03b7 is a contact form.Now, we can take local coordinates adapted to the foliation and, on each leaf, use theDarboux theorem for contact manifolds. Hence, we have local coordinates (t\u0303, qi , pi , s) such that \u03b7 = ds\u2212 pidqi . Finally, we can write \u03c4 as a combination of all these coordinates, \u03c4 = f (t\u0303, qi , pi , s)dt\u0303 , where f is a non-vanishing function, and then we can redefine the coordinate t . Remark 2.8 Consider a cocontact manifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) such that \u03c4 = dt . Then, the two-form\n= e\u2212t (d\u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2227 \u03c4)\nis a symplectic form on M . Moreover, the two-form is exact, since\n= d(e\u2212t\u03b7) ."

This morphism of vector bundles induces a morphism of C\u221e(M)-modules \u0302 : 1(M) \u2192 X(M).\nGiven a smooth function f \u2208 C\u221e(M), we define the Hamiltonian vector field associated with f as\nX f = \u0302(d f ) + f E .\nThe characteristic distribution C of (M, , E) is spanned by these vector fields X f . It is integrable, and it can be defined in terms of the bivector and the vector field E as\nC = \u0302(T\u2217M) + \u3008E\u3009 .\nIn general, the morphism \u0302 is not an isomorphism, as can be seen in the following example.\nExample 2.11 (Contact manifolds) Consider a contact manifold (M, \u03b7). We have the C\u221e(M)-module isomorphism : X(M) \u2192 1(M) given by\n(X) = i(X)d\u03b7 + (i(X)\u03b7)\u03b7 ,\nand we denote its inverse by = \u22121. The Reeb vector field is R = \u03b7. Then we can define a Jacobi structure ( , E) on M given by\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2212d\u03b7( \u03b1, \u03b2) , E = \u2212R .\nIn this case, the morphism \u0302 is given by\n\u0302(\u03b1) = (\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1(R)R ,\nand it is clear that \u0302 is not an isomorphism, since ker \u0302 = \u3008\u03b7\u3009 and Im \u0302 = ker \u03b7. Example 2.12 (Poisson manifolds) A Poisson manifold is a smooth manifold M such that C\u221e(M) has a Lie bracket satisfying the Leibniz rule\n{ f g, h} = f {g, h} + { f , h}g .\nIt can be seen that this implies the weak Leibniz rule (1), thus giving a local Lie algebra structure to the set of smooth functions on M . One can prove that the Jacobi bracket of a Jacobi manifold (M, , E) is Poisson if and only if E = 0. Taking this into account, a Poisson manifold is a Jacobi manifold with E = 0. We can redefine the notion of Poisson manifold as a couple (M, ), where is a bivector such that [ , ] = 0.\nWe know that both symplectic and cosymplectic manifolds are Poisson. Hence, they are also Jacobi manifolds with\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03c9( \u03b1, \u03b2) , E = 0 ,\nwhere \u03c9 is the 2-form of the symplectic or cosymplectic manifold and is the inverse of the flat morphism of the symplectic or cosymplectic manifold.\nJacobi structure of cocontact manifolds\nConsider now a cocontact manifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7). In Darboux coordinates, the flat isomorphism reads\n( \u2202\n\u2202t\n)\n= dt = \u03c4 ,\n( \u2202\n\u2202qi\n)\n= dpi \u2212 pids + p2i dqi ,\n( \u2202\n\u2202 pi\n)\n= \u2212dqi ,\n( \u2202\n\u2202s\n)\n= ds \u2212 pidqi = \u03b7 .\nIts inverse is the isomorphism : 1(M) \u2192 X(M), which is given by\ndt = \u2202 \u2202t ,\ndqi = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202 pi , dpi = pi \u2202 \u2202s + \u2202 \u2202qi ,\nds = \u2202 \u2202s \u2212 pi \u2202 \u2202 pi .\nWe can define a 2-contravariant skew-symmetric tensor :\n(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2212d\u03b7( \u03b1, \u03b2) ,\nwhich in Darboux coordinates reads\n= \u2202 \u2202qi \u2227 \u2202 \u2202 pi \u2212 pi \u2202 \u2202 pi \u2227 \u2202 \u2202s .\nProposition 2.13 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a cocontact manifold. Then, ( , E), where E = \u2212Rs, is a Jacobi structure on M.\nThe previous proposition can be proved usingDarboux coordinates. UsingDarboux coordinates, the Jacobi bracket reads\n{ f , g} = \u2202 f \u2202qi \u2202g \u2202 pi \u2212 \u2202g \u2202qi \u2202 f \u2202 pi \u2212 pi\n( \u2202 f\n\u2202 pi\n\u2202g \u2202s \u2212 \u2202g\n\u2202 pi\n\u2202 f\n\u2202s\n)\n\u2212 f \u2202g \u2202s + g \u2202 f \u2202s .\nIn particular, one has\n{qi , q j } = {pi , p j } = 0 , {qi , p j } = \u03b4ij , {qi , s} = \u2212qi , {pi , s} = \u22122pi .\nLegendrian submanifolds\nIn the previous sectionwe have seen that every cocontactmanifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) is a Jacobi manifold taking (\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2212d\u03b7( \u03b1, \u03b2) and E = \u2212Rs . We will study a special kind of submanifolds associated to this structure.\nIn first place, we find a new expression for the morphism \u0302 which is easier to manipulate. We have\n\u03b1 = \u03b1 = i \u03b1d\u03b7 + (i \u03b1\u03b7)\u03b7 + (i \u03b1\u03c4 )\u03c4 ,\nand contracting with the Reeb vector fields Rs, Rt , we get\n\u03b1(Rt ) = i \u03b1\u03c4 , \u03b1(Rs) = i \u03b1\u03b7 .\nNow,\n\u03b2(\u0302(\u03b1)) = \u2212i \u03b2 i \u03b1d\u03b7 = i \u03b1i \u03b2d\u03b7 = i \u03b1 ( \u03b2 \u2212 (i \u03b2\u03b7)\u03b7 \u2212 (i \u03b2\u03c4 )\u03c4 )\n= \u03b2( \u03b1) \u2212 \u03b2(Rs)\u03b1(Rs) \u2212 \u03b2(Rt )\u03b1(Rt ) = \u03b2 ( \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1(Rs)Rs \u2212 \u03b1(Rt )Rt ) ,\nand thus\n\u0302(\u03b1) = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1(Rs)Rs \u2212 \u03b1(Rt )Rt .\nIt is clear that \u03c4, \u03b7 \u2208 ker \u0302. Consider \u03b2 \u2208 ker \u0302. Then, \u03b2 = \u03b2(Rs)Rs +\u03b2(Rt )Rt . Using the morphism , we have that\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(Rs)\u03b7 + \u03b2(Rt )\u03c4 .\nHence, we have that ker \u0302 = \u3008\u03c4, \u03b7\u3009. Definition 2.14 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a cocontact manifold and consider a submanifold N \u2282 M . We define the cocontact orthogonal complement of N as\nTpN \u22a5 = \u0302 ((TpN )\u25e6 ) .\nNotice that v \u2208 TpN\u22a5 if, and only if, there exists \u03b1 \u2208 T\u2217pN such that \u0302(\u03b1) = v and \u03b1(u) = 0 for every u \u2208 TpN . Definition 2.15 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a cocontact manifold and consider a submanifold N \u21aa\u2192 M . (i) N is said to be coisotropic if TN\u22a5 \u2282 TN . (ii) N is said to be isotropic if TN \u2282 TN\u22a5.\n(iii) N is said to be Legendrian if TN = TN\u22a5. The following theorem characterizes isotropic and Legendrian submanifolds.\nTheorem 2.16 Consider a cocontact manifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) with dim M = 2n + 2 and a submanifold j : N \u21aa\u2192 M. Then, (i) N is isotropic if and only if j\u2217\u03b7 = 0 and j\u2217\u03c4 = 0. (ii) N is Legendrian if and only if j\u2217\u03b7 = 0, j\u2217\u03c4 = 0 and dim N = n. Proof (i) Suppose TN \u2282 TN\u22a5. Let v \u2208 TpN , then v \u2208 TpN\u22a5 and hence there\nexists some \u03b1 \u2208 T\u2217pN such that \u0302(\u03b1) = v and \u03b1(u) = 0 for every u \u2208 TpN . Then,\n\u03b7(v) = \u03b7(\u0302(\u03b1)) = \u03b7( \u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1(Rs)Rs \u2212 0 = 0 .\nSince \u03b7p(v) = 0 for every p \u2208 N and every v \u2208 TpN , we have j\u2217\u03b7 = 0. Analogously, j\u2217\u03c4 = 0. Conversely, suppose j\u2217\u03b7 = 0 and j\u2217\u03c4 = 0. Let v \u2208 TpN . We want to check that v \u2208 TpN\u22a5. Consider\n\u03b1 = ivd\u03b7 .\nSince j\u2217\u03b7 = 0, we have j\u2217d\u03b7 = d j\u2217\u03b7 = 0 and thus iuivd\u03b7 = \u03b1(u) = 0 for every u \u2208 TpN . Now, we want to check that\nv = \u0302(\u03b1) = \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1(Rs)Rs \u2212 \u03b1(Rt )Rt = \u03b1 .\nSince is an isomorphism, this is the same as checking that (v) = \u03b1, which is obvious taking into account that j\u2217\u03b7 = 0 and j\u2217\u03c4 = 0. Finally, we have already proved that \u03b1(TpN ) = 0.\n(ii) Suppose that TN = TN\u22a5 and let k = dim N . Thus, at any point p \u2282 N ,\ndim TpN \u25e6 = 2n + 2 \u2212 dim TpN = 2n + 2 \u2212 k .\nSince TN \u2282 TN\u22a5, we have that \u03c4p, \u03b7p \u2208 TpN \u25e6 and then ker \u0302p \u2282 TpN \u25e6. Now, since TpN = TpN\u22a5 = \u0302p(TpN \u25e6),\ndim TpN \u25e6 \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 2n+2\u2212k = dim \u0302p(TpN \u25e6) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 k + dim ker \u0302p \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 2 ,\nwhich implies that k = n. Conversely, we have that 2n + 2 \u2212 n = dim TpN\u22a5 + 2 and thus dim TpN\u22a5 = n = dim TpN . Since TpN \u2282 TpN\u22a5, it is clear that TpN = TpN\u22a5."

(ii) The fibre Hessian F2L : R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R \u2212\u2192 (R \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R) \u2297 (R \u00d7 T\u2217Q \u00d7 R)\nof L is everywhere nondegenerate (the tensor product is of vector bundles over R \u00d7 Q \u00d7 R).\n(iii) (R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R, dt, \u03b7L) is a cocontact manifold. The proof of this result can be easily done using natural coordinates, where\nFL : (t, qi , vi , s) \u2212\u2192 ( t, qi , \u2202L\n\u2202vi , s\n)\n,\nand\nF2L(t, qi , vi , s) = (t, qi ,Wi j , s) , with Wi j = ( \u22022L \u2202vi\u2202v j ) .\nAnd the three conditions in the above proposition are equivalent to say that the matrix W = (Wi j ) is everywhere regular, hence they are equivalent. Definition 4.6 A Lagrangian function L is said to be regular if the equivalent conditions in Proposition 4.5 hold. Otherwise L is called a singular Lagrangian. In particular, L is said to be hyperregular if FL is a global diffeomorphism. Remark 4.7 As a result of the preceding definitions and results, every regular cocontact Lagrangian system has associated the cocontact Hamiltonian system (R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R, dt, \u03b7L, EL).\nGiven a regular cocontact Lagrangian system (R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R,L), from Proposition 2.6 we have that the Reeb vector fields RLt , RLs \u2208 X(R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R) for this system are uniquely determined by the relations\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9 i(RLt )dt = 1 , i(RLt )\u03b7L = 0 , i(RLt )d\u03b7L = 0 ,\n\u23a7 \u23a8\n\u23a9 i(RLs )dt = 0 , i(RLs )\u03b7L = 1 , i(RLs )d\u03b7L = 0 .\nTheir local expressions are\nRLt = \u2202 \u2202t \u2212 Wi j \u2202 2L \u2202t\u2202v j \u2202 \u2202vi ,\nRLs = \u2202 \u2202s \u2212 Wi j \u2202 2L \u2202s\u2202v j \u2202 \u2202vi ,\nwhereWi j is the inverse of theHessianmatrix of the LagrangianL, namelyWi jW jk = \u03b4ik .\nNotice that if the Lagrangian function L is singular, the Reeb vector fields are not uniquely determined. This will be discussed in Sect. 5."

If C has constant rank, we say that the couple (\u03c4, \u03b7) is of class cl(\u03c4, \u03b7) = dim M \u2212 rank C. Definition 5.2 Consider a smooth manifold M . The couple (\u03c4, \u03b7), where \u03c4, \u03b7 \u2208 1(M), is a precocontact structure on M if d\u03c4 = 0, the characteristic distribution of the couple (\u03c4, \u03b7) has constant rank and cl(\u03c4, \u03b7) = 2r + 2 \u2265 2. The triple (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) will be called a precocontact manifold.\nTheorem 5.3 (Darboux theorem) Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a precocontact manifold with dim M = m.Then, aroundeverypoint p \u2208 M, there is a local chart (U ; t, qi , pi , s, u j ), where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 c, 2r + 2 + c = m, such that\n\u03c4 |U = dt , \u03b7|U = ds \u2212 pidqi , C = \u2329 \u2202\n\u2202u j\n\u232a\n.\nProof Since the one-form \u03c4 is closed, we have that locally \u03c4 = dt . Moreover, ker \u03c4 is an integrable distribution and thus induces a foliation F of M . Consider the leaf F0 corresponding to t = t0. We want to see that the class of \u03b7|F0 is odd (the definition of class of a one-form can be found in Definition VI.1.1 in [30]). It is clear that, on a point p \u2208 F0, C = C\u03b7|F0 . Hence,\ncl(\u03b7|F0) = m \u2212 1 \u2212 rank C\u03b7|F0 = m \u2212 1 \u2212 rank Ct0 = cl(\u03c4, \u03b7) \u2212 1,\nand since cl(\u03c4, \u03b7) \u2265 2 is even, we have that cl(\u03b7|F0) \u2265 1 is odd. Now, using Theorem VI.4.1 in [30] we obtain the desired result. Remark 5.4 If cl(\u03c4, \u03b7) = m thenmmust be even andwe recover the cocontact structure introduced in Definition 2.1.\nGiven a precocontact manifold (M, \u03c4, \u03b7), the morphism can be defined in the same way as in the regular case:\n: TM \u2212\u2192 T\u2217M v \u2212\u2192 (i(v)\u03c4 )\u03c4 + i(v)d\u03b7 + (i(v)\u03b7) \u03b7 .\nHowever, in this case it is not an isomorphism (see Proposition 5.6).\nDefinition 5.5 A vector field Rs \u2208 X(M) is a contact Reeb vector field if\n(Rs) = \u03b7 .\nA vector field Rt \u2208 X(M) is a time Reeb vector field if\n(Rt ) = \u03c4 .\nBoth kinds of vector fields always exist thanks to the theorem 5.3, and global ones can be constructed using partitions of the unity. Crucially, in the precocontact case the Reeb vector fields are not unique.\nProposition 5.6 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) be a precocontact structure on M. Then\nC = ker \u03c4 \u2229 ker \u03b7 \u2229 ker d\u03b7 = ker = (Im )\u25e6 .\nProof We will begin by proving that ker \u03c4 \u2229 ker \u03b7 \u2229 ker d\u03b7 \u2287 ker . Let X \u2208 ker , then\n(X) = 0 . (21)\nLet Rs, Rt be a contact and time Reeb vector fields respectively. Contracting both sides of equation (21) with Rs , we have\n0 = i(Rs)i(X)d\u03b7 + i(Rs)((i(X)\u03b7)\u03b7) + i(Rs)((i(X)\u03c4 )\u03c4 )\n= \u2212i(X)(i(Rs)d\u03b7)) + (i(X)\u03b7)(i(Rs)\u03b7) + (i(X)\u03c4 )(i(Rs)\u03c4 ) = i(X)\u03b7 .\nOn the other hand, contracting with Rt , we obtain\n0 = i(Rt )i(X)d\u03b7 + i(Rt )((i(X)\u03b7)\u03b7) + i(Rt )((i(X)\u03c4 )\u03c4 ) = \u2212i(X)(i(Rt )d\u03b7)) + (i(X)\u03b7)(i(Rt )\u03b7) + (i(X)\u03c4 )(i(Rt )\u03c4 ) = i(X)\u03c4 .\nHence, we also have that i(X)d\u03b7 = 0 and then X \u2208 ker \u03c4 \u2229 ker \u03b7 \u2229 ker d\u03b7. The other inclusion is trivial.\nNow we will show that ker = (Im )\u25e6. Let X \u2208 ker . By the first equality, i(X)\u03c4 = 0, i(X)\u03b7 = 0 and i(X)d\u03b7 = 0. Then, for every vector field Y ,\ni(X) (Y ) = i(X)(i(Y )\u03c4 )\u03c4 + i(X)i(Y )d\u03b7 + i(X)(i(Y )\u03b7)\u03b7 = \u2212i(Y )i(X)d\u03b7 = 0 ,\nand hence ker \u2282 (Im )\u25e6. Now, as it is clear that both subspaces of TpM have the same dimension, we have that ker = (Im )\u25e6.\nNotice that if R1 and R2 are two contact (or two time) Reeb vector fields, then, R1 \u2212 R2 \u2208 C. Conversely, if R is a contact (time) Reeb vector field, then R + V is a contact (or time) Reeb vector field for any V \u2208 C. Definition 5.7 A precocontact Hamiltonian system is a family (M, \u03c4, \u03b7, H) where (M, \u03c4, \u03b7) is a precocontact manifold and H \u2208 C\u221e(M) is the Hamiltonian function on M .\nDefinition 5.8 Let (M, \u03c4, \u03b7, H) be a precocontact Hamiltonian system and Rs and Rt two contact and time Reeb vector fields respectively.

Both problems are solved by applying a suitable constraint algorithm."

These steps are applied iteratively, but the\nfirst step is specially relevant because it will solve the multiplicity of Reeb vector fields.\nConsider a \u03b3H with particular Reeb vector fields Rs and Rt .

Conversely, consider p \u2208 M\u03041 and Y \u2208 C. Then, (iY dH)p = 0, which implies (iY \u03b3H )p = 0. Thus (\u03b3H )p \u2208 (C)\u25e6p = (TpM).

Since R\u0304t \u2212 Rt , R\u0304s \u2212 Rs \u2208 C, we have that \u03b3H = \u03b3\u0304H on M1.\nNotice that on M1, the precocontact Hamiltonian equation for the precocontact system (M, \u03c4, \u03b7, H) does not depend on the choice of the Reeb vector fields Rt , Rs .\nIn M1 (which we assume to be a submanifold) there exists a solution XH of (22), but it may not be tangent to M1.

In M f we can find solutions to equations (22) which are tangent to M f . Notice that, in the Lagrangian case, we need to impose the sode condition.\nIn general, the Reeb vector fields are not tangent to the submanifolds provided by this constraint algorithm. One can continue the algorithm by demanding the tangency of the Reeb vector fields, as shown in [19].

            "text": "There are two classes of constraints:holonomic, which only depend on the generalized coordinates and time, and nonholonomic, which have a dependence on velocities or momenta. Nonholonomic constraints are more intricate and there are several ways to implement them (see [33] for a general study of these kind of constraints in the symplectic setting).\nIn a recent article [20] the authors consider contact systems with nonholonomic constraints and show how a contact system can be understood as a symplectic system with nonholonomic constraints. This chapter adds to these results by considering singular Lagrangians and allowing explicit dependence on time of both the Lagrangian and the constraints. On the other hand, we only consider holonomic constraints.\nConsider a Lagrangian precocontact system (R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R,L\u2032), with \u03c4 = dt . We will denote by \u03b7L\u2032 , C\u2032 and EL\u2032 the contact form, characteristic distribution and Lagrangian energy associated to the system (R \u00d7 TQ \u00d7 R,L\u2032). Now we add a set of independent constraints f \u03b1(t, qi , s) = 0 with 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 d, which define a submanifold S \u21aa\u2192 R\u00d7TQ\u00d7R. In order to define a suitable constraint submanifold, these constraints functions must verify the condition\nrank\n( \u2202 f \u03b1\n\u2202qi\n)\n= d , \u2200t, s .\nTherefore, we can understand these constraints as a constraint in the generalized coordinates (qi , s) for every value of time t .\nIn order to find the precocontact Lagrangian vector field for (S,L), we add d new configuration variables \u03bb\u03b1 , thus the enlarged manifold is R \u00d7 T(Q \u00d7 Rd) \u00d7 R, with local variables (t, qi , vi , \u03bb\u03b1, v\u03b1, s). We consider the new Lagrangian:\nL = L\u2032 + \u03bb\u03b1 f \u03b1 .\nthus \u03bb\u03b1 act as Lagrange multipliers and we consider them dynamical variables.\nWe have the precocontact Lagrangian system (R\u00d7T(Q\u00d7Rd)\u00d7R,L). The contact form is the same \u03b7L = \u03b7L\u2032 , and the characteristic distribution is\nC = C\u2032 \u222a \u2329 \u2202\n\u2202\u03bb\u03b1 ,\n\u2202\n\u2202v\u03b1\n\u232a\n.\nAnd the Lagrangian energy is\nEL = EL\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1 f \u03b1 .\nThe primary constraints are generated by sections of C, which we can separate in two classes, those which are sections of C\u2032 and \u2202\n\u2202\u03bb\u03b1 and\n\u2202\n\u2202v\u03b1 . The last ones give the\nconstraints:\nL\u2202/\u2202\u03bb\u03b1 EL = \u2212 f \u03b1 = 0 ; L\u2202/\u2202v\u03b1 EL = 0 .\nThus,we recover the original constraints from the constraint algorithm. IfY is a section of C\u2032, then\nLY EL = LY EL\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1LY f \u03b1 = 0 .\nThe primary constraints for the Lagrangian L\u2032 (that is, without imposing f \u03b1 = 0) are LY EL\u2032 . Thus, these constraints become coupledwith f \u03b1 and are not conserved in general. From this point the constraints algorithm should continue imposing the tangency condition. The outcome will depend on the particular Lagrangian and constraints.\nWe will now compute the dynamical equations, which are complementary to the constraint algorithm. Consider a holonomic vector field:\nX = f \u2202 \u2202t + vi \u2202 \u2202xi + v\u03b1 \u2202 \u2202\u03bb\u03b1 + Gi \u2202 \u2202vi + G\u03b1 \u2202 \u2202v\u03b1 + g \u2202 \u2202s .\nThen the precocontact equations (22) are\nf = 1 , g = L , f \u03b1 = 0 , \u22022L\u2032 \u2202t\u2202vi + v j \u2202 2L\u2032 \u2202q j\u2202vi + G j \u2202 2L\u2032 \u2202v j\u2202vi + L\u2032 \u2202 2L\u2032 \u2202s\u2202vi \u2212 \u2202L \u2032 \u2202qi\n= \u2202L \u2032\n\u2202s \u2202L\u2032 \u2202vi + \u03bb\u03b1 ( \u2202 f \u03b1 \u2202qi + \u2202 f \u03b1 \u2202s \u2202L\u2032 \u2202vi ) ."

(24)\nNotice that if we consider a pendulum with fixed length (t) = \u25e6, we recover the usual equation for a damped pendulum:\n\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212\u03b3 \u03b8\u0307 \u2212 g \u25e6 sin \u03b8 .\nOn the other hand, setting \u03b3 = 0 in equation (24), we obtain the equation of the simple pendulum with variable length studied in [32].\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we have represented a couple of simulations of a damped pendulum of mass m = 1 with variable length considering (t) = 1 + 0.1 sin(2\u03c0 t), friction coefficients \u03b3 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.75 respectively, and initial conditions \u03b8(0) = \u03c0/4 and \u03b8\u0307 (0) = 0. We have plotted the evolution of the radial and angular coordinates and we can see the loss of amplitude, and hence of energy, of the system. Notice that in this example, the energy does not tend to zero, but to a positive constant since the radial coordinates keeps oscillating forever."

            "text": "In this paper we have introduced a geometrical formulation for time-dependent contact systems by defining a new geometric structure: cocontact manifolds. This new notion combines the well-known contact and cosymplectic structures. We have also proved that cocontact manifolds are Jacobi manifolds and defined and characterize the notions of isotropic and Legendrian submanifolds.\nThis geometrical setting allows us to develop the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms for time-dependent contact systems, generalizing those for contact systems [6, 18, 26] and cosymplectic systems [23]. In addition, we have studied the problem where the system is defined by a singular Lagrangian, thus introducing the notion of precocontact structure. This is useful since many systems are defined by singular Lagrangians. As an application, we have studied the particular case of cocontact systems with time-dependent holonomic constraints.\nWe have worked out two regular examples: the damped forced harmonic oscillator and the Kepler problem with non-constant mass and friction; and a singular one: a pendulum with variable length and friction. This last example is singular because we have introduced the constraint with a Lagrange multiplier and the constraint algorithm gives back the constraint. Computer simulations of some of these examples have been included.\nThe structures introduced in this paper could be used to improve our understanding of time-dependent dissipative systems. For instance, providing new geometric integrators [7\u20139, 49] from the discretization of the obtained equations, discussing symmetries and their associated dissipated and conserved quantities, and studying reduction procedures such as coisotropic reduction [1, 18] and Marsden\u2013Weinstein reduction [42]. It would be also interesting to state the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi theory for these systems and describe the Skinner\u2013Rusk unified formalism for cocontact systems.\nThe formulation presented in this work is also a first step towards finding a geometric formalism for non-autonomous dissipative field theories based on the k-contact setting [25, 27, 34] and generalizing the multisymplectic formalism [12, 46]. The kcontact formalism allows to describe autonomous field theories, such as field theories with damping, some equations from circuit theory, such as the so-called telegrapher\u2019s equation, or the Burgers\u2019 equation. Nevertheless, there are many examples of nonautonomousfield theories, likeMaxwell\u2019s equationswith a non constant charge density or general relativitywithmatter sources that require a formulation for non-autonomous field theories.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge fruitful discussions and comments from our colleague Narciso Rom\u00e1n-Roy.
