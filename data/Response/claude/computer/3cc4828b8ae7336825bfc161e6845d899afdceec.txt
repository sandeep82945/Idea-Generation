 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Investigate the effectiveness of different priming methods proposed in the Cyclical Priming Methodology (CPM) model, such as motivation-oriented priming (MOP), reflective experience priming (REP), direct attentional priming (DAP), etc. Conduct experiments to see which methods have the biggest impact on reducing scarcity mindset and improving learning.

2. Explore individual differences in response to priming interventions. Identify student characteristics or learning profiles that make certain groups more receptive to specific priming techniques. This could allow more personalized priming. 

3. Test CPM and priming methods in different subject domains beyond animation and creative topics covered in the studies. Some subject matter may be more conducive to certain priming techniques.

4. Examine the optimal timing and frequency of priming interventions within the Experiential Learning Theory cycle. When should different primes be introduced for maximum benefit? How often should they be repeated?

5. Develop and evaluate immersive virtual reality environments tailored to specific priming methods, leveraging VR's affordances. For example, design VR spaces optimized for motivation-oriented priming or reflective experience priming.
