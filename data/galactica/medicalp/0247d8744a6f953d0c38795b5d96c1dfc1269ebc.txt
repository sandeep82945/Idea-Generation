Conclusion: In the general population of Japan, not engaging in leisure-time exercise and low income affect psychological distress among young adults. Further detailed studies are needed to consider overall physical activity, job type, and work style. KEYWORDS

Among young adults, leisure-time exercise and higher annual household income were associated with lower psychological distress, whereas in the 40–64 age group with greater social responsibility, employment type was associated with increased psychological distress. Among older adults, higher education and higher annual income were associated with less psychological distress. For those over 40 years of age, cohabitation was associated with reduced psychological distress. data availability statement The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because data cannot be shared publicly due to ethical restrictions.
