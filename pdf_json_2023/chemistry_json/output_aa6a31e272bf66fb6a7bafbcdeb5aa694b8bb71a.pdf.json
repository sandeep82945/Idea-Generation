    "abstractText": "The phosphorolysis of cello-oligosaccharides is a critical process played in the rumen by Ruminococcus albus to degrade cellulose. Cellodextrins, made up of a few glucosyl units, have gained lots of interest by their potential applications. Here, we characterized a cellobiose phosphorylase (RalCBP) and a cellodextrin phosphorylase (RalCDP) from R. albus 8. This latter was further analyzed in detail by constructing a truncated mutant (Ral\u0394N63CDP) lacking the N-terminal domain and a chimeric protein by fusing a CBM (RalCDP-CBM37). RalCBP showed a typical behavior with high activity on cellobiose. Instead, RalCDP extended its activity to longer soluble or insoluble cello-oligosaccharides. The catalytic efficiency of RalCDP was higher with cellotetraose and cellopentaose as substrates for both reaction directions. Concerning properties of Ral\u0394N63CDP, results support roles for the N-terminal domain in the conformation of the homodimer and conferring the enzyme the capacity to catalyze the phosphorolytic reaction. This mutant exhibited reduced affinity toward phosphate and increased to glucose-1-phosphate. Further, the CBM37 module showed functionality when fused to RalCDP, as RalCDP-CBM37 exhibited an enhanced ability to use insoluble cellulosic substrates. Data obtained from this enzyme\u2019s binding parameters to cellulosic polysaccharides agree with the kinetic results. Besides, studies of synthesis and phosphorolysis of cello-saccharides at long-time reactions served to identify the utility of these enzymes. While RalCDP produces a mixture of cello-oligosaccharides (from cellotriose to longer oligosaccharides), the impaired phosphorolytic activity makes Ral\u0394N63CDP lead mainly toward the synthesis of cellotetraose. On the other hand, RalCDP-CBM37 remarks on the utility of obtaining glucose-1-phosphate from cellulosic compounds.",

Iglesias*\nLaboratorio de Enzimolog\u00eda Molecular, Instituto de Agrobiotecnolog\u00eda Del Litoral (CONICET\u2014UNL), Facultad de Bioqu\u00edmica y Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidad Nacional Del Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina\nThe phosphorolysis of cello-oligosaccharides is a critical process played in the rumen by Ruminococcus albus to degrade cellulose. Cellodextrins, made up of a few glucosyl units, have gained lots of interest by their potential applications. Here, we characterized a cellobiose phosphorylase (RalCBP) and a cellodextrin phosphorylase (RalCDP) from R. albus 8. This latter was further analyzed in detail by constructing a truncated mutant (Ral\u0394N63CDP) lacking the N-terminal domain and a chimeric protein by fusing a CBM (RalCDP-CBM37). RalCBP showed a typical behavior with high activity on cellobiose. Instead, RalCDP extended its activity to longer soluble or insoluble cello-oligosaccharides. The catalytic efficiency of RalCDP was higher with cellotetraose and cellopentaose as substrates for both reaction directions. Concerning properties of Ral\u0394N63CDP, results support roles for the N-terminal domain in the conformation of the homodimer and conferring the enzyme the capacity to catalyze the phosphorolytic reaction. This mutant exhibited reduced affinity toward phosphate and increased to glucose-1-phosphate. Further, the CBM37 module showed functionality when fused to RalCDP, as RalCDP-CBM37 exhibited an enhanced ability to use insoluble cellulosic substrates. Data obtained from this enzyme\u2019s binding parameters to cellulosic polysaccharides agree with the kinetic results. Besides, studies of synthesis and phosphorolysis of cello-saccharides at long-time reactions served to identify the utility of these enzymes. While RalCDP produces a mixture of cello-oligosaccharides (from cellotriose to longer oligosaccharides), the impaired phosphorolytic activity makes Ral\u0394N63CDP lead mainly toward the synthesis of cellotetraose. On the other hand, RalCDP-CBM37 remarks on the utility of obtaining glucose-1-phosphate from cellulosic compounds.\nKEYWORDS\ncellobiose phosphorylase, cellodextrin phosphorylase, cello-oligosaccharides, CBM, enzymatic catalysis\n1 Introduction\nCellulose, the quantitatively highest biopolymer on Earth, plays a critical role as a structural polymer, source of sugars and material for industrial applications (Moon et al., 2011; Huber et al., 2012; Nakajima M et al., 2017). Cellulose is a linear polymer of a hundred to a thousand glucosyl units linked through \u03b2-(1\u2192 4)-glycosidic bonds. Cellulose oligomers, or cellodextrins, made up of a few glucosyl units, have gained some interest because of their properties (Kluge et al., 2019; \u00c1vila et al., 2021). These materials have potential applications for non-digestible dietary fiber products (Adharis et al., 2018), novel bio-based surfactants"

Cellodextrins are interesting feed ingredients in livestock animals, showing potential prebiotic and healthpromoting properties (Sybesma et al., 2015).\nCello-oligosaccharides have been produced from the degradation of natural cellulose or synthetic pathways via chemical or enzymatic reactions (Bill\u00e8s et al., 2017; Kluge et al., 2019). Soluble cellodextrins were proven to be beneficial dietary fibers and prebiotics that stimulate the growth of many healthy human gut bacteria more efficiently than inulin, trans-galacto-oligosaccharides, and cellobiose alone (Zhong et al., 2020). One way to generate cellodextrins is through chemical (e.g., acidcatalyzed cellulose degradation) or enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. However, there are important concerns about chemical degradation because of the generation of oligosaccharides and unwanted byproducts. The enzymatic hydrolysis, meanwhile, requires highly pure enzymes (e.g., cellulases, \u03b2-glucosidases) and gives a mixture of cellodextrins (Zhong et al., 2019). Furthermore, the isolation of the cellodextrins from hydrolysis mixtures needs significant efforts in downstream processing (Zhang and Lynd, 2003). An alternative approach is to produce cellodextrins through bottom-up synthesis to overcome cellulose degradation issues. Since chemical synthesis involves multistep procedures, difficulties appear in controlling glycosidic bond formation\u2019s regioselectivity and stereospecificity during polymerization and obtaining high molecular weight polysaccharides (Xiao and Grinstaff, 2017). Enzymatic routes constitute convenient tools for overcoming such critical troubles (Bill\u00e8s et al., 2017). In vitro enzymatic synthesis of cello-oligosaccharides provides some advantages compared to the previous methods. For example, wellcontrolled structures of products are obtained in a one-step polymerization owing to the high regio-, enantio-, chemo-, and stereo-selectivity of the enzymes. In addition, the production of controlled product composition eliminates the need for posterior purification steps (Zhong et al., 2020). Moreover, enzymes are nontoxic compounds that catalyze the reaction under ecologic environments, and they are isolated from sustainable resources or produced as recombinant proteins (Shoda et al., 2016; Fodor et al., 2017).\nRuminococcus albus 8 is a critical ruminal bacterium involved in the digestion of dietary cellulose. This microorganism degrades cello-oligosaccharides mainly through phosphorolysis catalyzed by cellobiose phosphorylase (RalCBP; EC 2.4.1.2) and cellodextrin phosphorylase (RalCDP; EC 2.4.1.49) rather than hydrolysis catalyzed by \u03b2-glucosidase (Hamura et al., 2012; Sawano et al., 2013). Glycoside phosphorylases belong to the glycoside hydrolase family 94 (GH94) and play an important role in the metabolism of long-chain cellodextrins (Ubiparip et al., 2021). They catalyze a glycoside\u2019s reversible phosphorolysis to produce the corresponding sugar 1-phosphate (Eq. 1), enabling efficient synthesis of a diversity of oligosaccharides with sugar 1- phosphate as the donor and a suitable carbohydrate acceptor in the synthetic reaction with strict regioselectivity (Luley-Goedl and Nidetzky, 2010; Nakai et al., 2010; O\u2019Neill and Field, 2015; Puchart, 2015; Zhong et al., 2019; Gabrielli et al., 2021).\nCello \u2212 oligosacharide n( ) + Pi \u2194 Cello \u2212 oligosacharide n\u22121( ) + Glc \u2212 1P (1)\nCellodextrin phosphorylases have been extensively used in the enzymatic synthesis of polysaccharides (Nakai et al., 2013; O\u2019Neill\nand Field, 2015; Zhong et al., 2019; Zhong and Nidetzky, 2020; Nidetzky and Zhong, 2021). They have the broadest acceptor and donor substrate specificity of all GH94 enzymes, making them good tools for suitable biocatalytic production of diverse carbohydrates and related molecules. Still, the average degree of polymerization (DP) of cellodextrin produced by CDP ranged from 8 to 10 glucose units, suggesting that these enzymes cannot elongate high DP cellodextrin chains (Ubiparip et al., 2021). This lack of capacity may result from the decrease in cellodextrin solubility as their DP increases, leading to reduced access of the soluble enzyme to the longer substrates. To overcome this issue, enzymes from different GH families, usually contain a catalytic module and one or more non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (Boraston et al., 2004). CBMs can enrich enzymes on the surface of solid substrates through affinity adsorption to enhance their activity (Shoseyov et al., 2006). Remarkably, in addition to the catalytic domain, most glycosyl hydrolases from R. albus display different motifs involved in substrate binding and/or cell adhesion (Christopherson et al., 2014; Storani et al., 2020; Yeoman et al., 2021). Among them, CBM from family 37 (CBM37), exclusive from this bacterium, exhibits an affinity to broad substrates like cellulose, xylans, and other oligosaccharides (Ezer et al., 2008). Unlike many glycoside hydrolases, no report deals with glycoside phosphorylase containing a CBM. From the crystal structure of Clostridium thermocellum CDP, it was identified that this protein had a unique N-terminal extension involved in homodimer assembly and contributed to the substrate binding site conformation (O\u2019Neill et al., 2017). We identified that multiple GH94 enzymes have a very conserved N-terminal region that could be involved in homodimer assembly and/or binding site conformation.\nThe present work describes the structural and functional characterization of two members of the family GH94 (CDP and CBP) from R. albus 8. Here, we analyzed the putative function of the first 63 N-terminal amino acids conserved in RalCDP as a putative CBM. On the other hand, we hypothesized that adding a CBM to a cellodextrin phosphorylase catalytic domain could improve enzyme access to insoluble substrates, thus enhancing its activity. To achieve this goal, we explored how the fusion of a CBM37_2 from R. albus 8 Cel5G affects its activity on insoluble substrates."

The standard reaction media contained 100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 6.0, 2 mM Glc-1P, 20 mM of different glucosyl acceptors (glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose or cellopentaose), and a proper dilution of the enzyme in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL.

They are commonly homodimers, and each subunit is composed of three distinct domains: an N-terminal \u03b2-sandwich domain that forms most of the dimer interface, a helical linker, and an (\u03b1/\u03b1)6-barrel catalytic domain (Hidaka et al., 2004, 2006; Bianchetti et al., 2011; Nakajima H et al., 2017; Kuhaudomlarp et al., 2019). Interestingly, the length and conformation of catalytic, adjacent, and opposite loops were identified as the determining features that restrict the size of the acceptor binding site differentiating between CBPs, CDPs, and ChBPs (Hidaka et al., 2004; 2006; De Groeve et al., 2010; Bianchetti et al., 2011; O\u2019Neill et al., 2017; Gabrielli et al., 2021).\nWe recognized two putative glycosyl phosphorylases from the GH94 family in the proteome of R. albus 8 project ID\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04\nUP000004259, identified with entry codes E9SB92 and E9SAK5. Protein sequence E9SB92 is entirely identical to CBP from R. albus NE1 (Hamura et al., 2012). It presents high identity (67% and 56%, respectively) to the enzymes from Clostridium thermocellum (PDB: 3qde) (Bianchetti et al., 2011) and Cellvibrio gilvus (PDB: 2cqs) (Hidaka et al., 2006). The protein derived from E9SAK5 aligned with the same sequences presenting much lower identity and similarity (30% and 45%, respectively). The alignment of E9SAK5 with members of the GH94 family showed higher sequence similarities with Vibrio proteolyticus ChBP, and Vibrio furnissii CBP, with an identity of 37% and a similarity of 68% for both proteins. Sequence alignments showed the conservation of critical amino acids involved in the phosphate-binding site and other residues conforming substrate-binding subsites \u22121, +1, and +2 (Figure 1).\nStructure comparison performed between V. proteolyticus ChBP (PDB code: 1v7x) (Hidaka et al., 2004), C. thermocellum CBP (PDB code: 3qde) (Bianchetti et al., 2011), CtCDP (PDB code: 5nz8) (O\u2019Neill et al., 2017), and a model of the E9SAK5 protein designed by AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al., 2021) revealed significant structural differences in catalytic, adjacent, and opposite loops length (Figures 2A, B). Based on these dissimilarities, we assumed that the protein sequence from entry E9SAK5 corresponded to R. albus 8 cellodextrin phosphorylase (RalCDP), despite its relatively low sequence similarity with other CDPs, like Thermoclostridium stercorarium (53%), and Thermotoga neapolitana (49%). In addition, multiple sequences analysis of several glycosyl phosphorylases from the family GH94 revealed that the N-terminal domain presents a highly conserved region (amino acids 1\u201363). This region was predicted to be involved in substrate binding, homodimer interaction, and to be a putative CBM by the SMART tool (Letunic and Bork, 2018; Letunic et al., 2021).

            "text": "Ruminococcus albus 8 CBP and four variants of CDP were constructed and produced in E. coli, as described in Figure 3. Thus, the constructs were designed to produce RalCBP (the E9SB92 protein), and RalCDP (the E9SAK5 protein) and its truncated version lacking the firsts sixty-three N-terminal amino acids (Ral\u0394N63CDP). Also, we joined the CBM37 by a flexible glycine linker to RalCDP and Ral\u0394N63CDP to construct the fusion proteins RalCDP-CBM37 and Ral\u0394N63CDP-CBM37 (Figure 3A). Flexible linkers are the most often employed since they allow freedom of mobility and interaction between domains (Martins et al., 2020). The applied strategy enables fusing the CBM to the enzymes\u2019 N- or the C-extreme. Still, all resulting enzymes were inactive when the CBM was linked to the N- terminal. As also illustrated in Figure 2A, all the recombinant proteins were produced with a His-tag fused to its C-terminal and purified by Ni2+-affinity (Ni2+-IDA) chromatography.\nFigure 3B shows that recombinant proteins were produced and purified to a high electrophoretic degree. RalCBP has 829 amino acids and a theoretical molecular mass of 92.3 kDa, while RalCDP has 809 amino acids and 90.2 kDa. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins exposed a band of approximately 90 kDa. Gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200 indicated that both enzymes are homodimers with a molecular mass of 180 kDa (Figure 3C). These data are\nin good agreement with that reported for other enzymes of the GH94 family previously characterized (Kim et al., 2002; Krishnareddy et al., 2002; Nakai et al., 2010; Bianchetti et al., 2011). Meanwhile, the mutant Ral\u0394N63CDP eluted as a single peak with an elution volume corresponding to a monomer. This latter result suggests a loss of interaction between the subunits consequent with the absence of the conserved region on the N-terminal. Conversely, adding the CBM37 to the C-extreme of RalCDP did not disturb the homodimer conformation. On the other hand, the CBM37 fusion to the C-terminal of Ral\u0394N63CDP produced a protein oligomer that eluted in a volume corresponding with a homo-pentamer (Figure 3C).\nWe measured the enzymatic activity of each elusion peak by assaying the respective enzyme in the synthesis sense of catalysis. RalCBP and RalCDP presented a specific activity of 57 U/mg and 98 U/mg, with glucose and cellobiose as substrates, respectively. For the truncated version Ral\u0394N63CDP, this value was 31 U/mg, despite its conformational change from a homodimer to a monomer. Different results were observed with the fusion of the CBM to these enzymes. RalCDP-CBM37 showed a specific activity of 45 U/mg; meanwhile, Ral\u0394N63CDP-CBM37 was completely inactive, probably due to its oligomeric state.\nFIGURE 2 (A) Crystal structure of CtCDP (PDB code: 5zn8) and (B) 3Dmodel of RalCDP homodimer structure performed by Alphafold2.

No optimum pH and temperature differences were evident between any enzyme\u2019s phosphorolytic and synthetic activities. RalCDP exhibited maximum activity at pH range 5\u20137, but the proteins RalCBP, Ral\u0394N63CDP, and RalCDP-CBM37 showed a narrower maximum activity peak at pH 6\u20137. At pH 5, RalCBP and Ral\u0394N63CDP displayed a reduction of 60% in their respective catalytic activity compared with RalCDP and RalCDPCBM37. In the same way, a slight difference (~20%) was detected for the mutant enzymes at pH 8.0 (Figure 4A). Regarding the proteins\u2019 stability at different pH conditions, RalCDP and RalCDP-CBM37 conserved 80% of their enzymatic activity after incubating for 1 h in the pH range 4\u20139. RalCBP only preserved this activity level when incubated in the pH range of 4\u20136. Meanwhile, in the rest of the\nconditions tested, RalCBP showed around 50%\u201360% of its catalytic activity. Ral\u0394N63CDP was the enzyme with the least stability, with 40% residual activity after incubation with sodium citrate buffer (pH 4\u20135) or potassium phosphate (pH 5\u20139). However, this enzyme conserved 70% residual activity when incubated in sodium acetate buffer (between pH 4\u20136). Also, all enzymes showed shallow stability when incubated in sodium citrate buffer at pH 3.0 for 1 h (Figure 4B).\nDetermination of optimal temperature for catalytic activity showed that RalCBP, RalCDP, and Ral\u0394N63CDP presented a maximum at 45\u00b0C. However, RalCDP activity decreased considerably at temperatures slightly lower or higher than its optimal temperature (60% and 40% of its optimal activity at 40\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C, respectively). It was noticed that the fusion of the CBM37 domain to RalCDP improved the enzyme\u00b4s behavior toward temperature.

RalCDP-CBM37 retained more than 60% of its catalytic capacity up to 60\u00b0C, while at this temperature, the RalCDP activity reduced by 90% (Figure 4D).

            "text": "Ruminococcus albus CBP and CDP variants\nWe further characterized the recombinant phosphorylases determining their kinetic properties when using different substrates in both senses of catalysis, with results detailed in Table 1. We also analyzed if the CBM addition improves enzyme activity on long-chain oligosaccharides or if the quaternary structure change (due to the lack of the N-terminal region in the protein) could modify the active site conformation, opening it to broader substrates. We tested the phosphorolytic and synthetic activities of RalCBP and the active CDP forms (RalCDP, Ral\u0394N63CDP, and RalCDP-CBM37) with substrates with different DP like glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and the two cellulosic oligosaccharides CMC and PASC.\nTable 1 shows that RalCBP exhibited phosphorolytic activity only with cellobiose and cellotriose. The kinetic parameters indicated a higher (by more than two orders of magnitude) catalytic performance of the enzyme with cellobiose (Figure 5). Indeed, the major difference was that the kcat value with cellotriose was 250-fold lower than that obtained with the disaccharide, although both KM values were similar (only 2-fold lower for cellobiose) (Table 1). Concerning synthetic activity using Glc-1P as the donor substrate, RalCBP exhibited maximum catalytic efficiency with glucose as the acceptor (Figure 5). The DP of the acceptor substrate affected considerably RalCBP catalytic ability. Compared with glucose, decreases of 450- and 1,100-fold in kcat were determined with cellobiose and cellotriose, respectively, but KM values exhibited increases of ~5-fold (Table 1). Overall, the kinetic behavior of RalCBP agrees with its identification of cellobiose phosphorylase.\nData obtained in the RalCDP characterization as a cellodextrin phosphorylase were markedly different from the above described for RalCBP. Thus, RalCDP showed synthetic activity with multiple acceptors, like glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and, less efficiently, the polysaccharides PASC and\nFIGURE 5 Enzymatic efficiencies of RalCBP (dark gray), RalCDP (light gray), RalCDP-CBM37 (white), and Ral\u0394N63CDP (striped) with cellooligosaccharides of different DP for synthesis (A) and phosphorolysis (B).\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org09\nCMC (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency with the monosaccharide was considerably lower than with the other soluble substrates or RalCBP (Figure 5). Indeed, RalCDP exhibited maximum catalytic efficiency with cellotetraose and cellopentaose substrates and values 3-, 4- and 25-fold lower for cellotriose, cellobiose and glucose, respectively. On the other hand, the enzyme\u2019s catalytic capacity for using the polysaccharides CMC and PASC was significantly low (Table 1; Figure 5). These results indicate the preference of this enzyme for oligosaccharides over the use of di- or monosaccharides as acceptors. However, the activity decreased when the DP increased considerably, like CMC and PASC polysaccharides, as described for other CDPs [54]. Similarly, RalCDP achieved maximum catalytic efficiencies in the phosphorolysis direction with cellopentaose and cellotetraose, diminishing in one order of magnitude by cellotriose and cellobiose (Figure 5). This decrease in catalytic efficiency was due to increased KM values as it decreased the substrate\u2019s polymerization degree. In contrast, the kcat values were similar with all cello-oligosaccharides. Otherwise, phosphorolytic activity (in terms of kcat) with polysaccharides CMC and PASC was 1,000- fold lower (Table 1).\nThe N-terminal region removal provided notably different kinetic parameters to Ral\u0394N63CDP compared with the wild-type RalCDP. As shown in Table 1, the truncated enzyme exhibited a ~1,000-fold reduction in its phosphorolytic capacity with cellobiose and was inactive with other disaccharides or oligosaccharides. Besides, the analysis of the synthetic reaction showed a 10-fold lower kcat for the elongation of cellobiose with Glc-1P. Other differences in kinetic behavior observed between Ral\u0394N63CDP and RalCDP for catalysis in the synthesis and phosphorolysis directions refer to affinity toward the substrates Glc-1P and phosphate (Table 2). Ral\u0394N63CDP showed a ~30-fold reduction in phosphate affinity, leading to a significant decrease in its catalytic efficiency for phosphorolysis. However, the capacity for catalyzing the synthetic reaction with cellobiose remains at the same level as the wild-type RalCDP.\nOn the other hand, the fusion of the CBM37 to Ral\u0394N63CDP and RalCDP had quite varied effects on the catalytic properties. Ral\u0394N63CDP-CBM37 was completely inactive, while RalCDPCBM37 showed similar kinetic parameters to RalCDP when using soluble oligosaccharides as substrates (Table 1). However, for the polysaccharides CMC and PASC, the CBM-tagged protein enhanced the kcat for phosphorolysis by one order of magnitude. It exhibited a 2-fold reduction in KM for CMC and PASC for both\nreaction directions (Table 2). This increased enzyme affinity for polysaccharides substrates enhances by ~20-fold the catalytic efficiency for phosphorolysis compared to RalCDP (Figure 5)."

As shown in Figure 6A, RalCDP could not bind to the insoluble polysaccharide PASC, remaining mainly in the soluble fraction after incubation. The same result was obtained for Ral\u0394N63CDP, indicating that the N-terminal region, predicted as CBM, lacks a carbohydrate-binding function, at least to cellulosic substrates. However, the addition of CBM37, exemplified by RalCDP-CBM37, remarkably improved its binding capacity to this polysaccharide. The increment supports this result in enzyme affinity to polysaccharides observed in the kinetics parameters determined for this enzyme.\nWe calculated the respective binding parameters from the isotherm of the interaction betweenRalCDP-CBM37 and PASC, shown in Figure 5B. The fusion protein presented a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.73 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M and an adsorption capacity (Amax) of 2.36 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcmol/g.

These results indicate that CBM37 effectively recognizes the insoluble substrate PASC, also reinforcing the absence of functionality of the protein\u2019s N-terminal domain for binding to the polysaccharide, as supported by results obtained with the complete RalCDP (Figure 6A). The increment in substrate binding affinity to the insoluble substrate was also reflected in the kinetic parameters of RalCDP-CBM37, which presents a decrease in KM with PASC compared to RalCDP (Table 1)."

However, this did not occur in reactions catalyzed by Ral\u0394N63CDP for any of the Glc-1P concentrations tested (Figure 7B). The absence of glucose in Ral\u0394N63CDP reactions is a consequence of its low affinity for Pi, as was shown in its kinetic characterization (Table 2). In addition, at low Glc-1P concentration (10 mM), we observed the synthesis of higher DP saccharides with the catalysis of Ral\u0394N63CDP than that exerted by RalCDP, reflecting reaction displacement towards polysaccharides synthesis.\nThe use of HPLC allowed further analysis of the reaction products of both enzymes. The reactions were performed from 30min to 4 h using Glc-1P and cellobiose in a 3:1 ratio. As illustrated by Figure 7C, RalCDP produced cellotriose, cellotetraose (~25 and ~20%, respectively), and increasing amounts of cellopentaose over the\nreaction time course (7, 17, and 24% for 1, 2, and 4 h, respectively). Meanwhile, in the reactions catalyzed by Ral\u0394N63CDP, only cellotriose and cellotetraose were produced (Figure 7D). The percentage of cellotriose detected was lower than those from RalCDP reactions. However, increasing amounts of cellotetraose were produced over time (23%\u201338%), being higher than those from RalCDP (18%\u201320%). These differences in reaction products could be attributed to the fact that Ral\u0394N63CDP cannot extend the oligosaccharide chain beyond cellotetraose, as shown in its kinetic characterization (Table 1), giving rise to the accumulation of this oligosaccharide. While, RalCDP has a high enzymatic activity with cellotetraose and cellopentaose. For these reasons, the RalCDP reaction would channel cellotetraose toward synthesizing oligosaccharides with a higher DP.\nThe higher catalytic efficiency of RalCDP-CBM37 with cellulosic polysaccharides could be an advantage for its\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org11\napplication in different processes. Its higher phosphorolytic capacity could be useful for the production of Glc-1P from high available polysaccharides like cellulose. Thus, we followed the arsenolysis of PASC at different reaction times catalyzed by RalCDP and RalCDPCBM37, the two enzyme versions exhibiting higher phosphorolytic\nactivity. The strategy of replacing phosphate with arsenate was previously useful for measuring phosphorolytic activity on the insoluble polysaccharide PASC (Eis and Nidetzky, 1999; Zhang and Lynd, 2005). Figure 8 shows that RalCDP-CBM37 presented a ~4-fold higher activity than RalCDP (0.71 vs. 0.16 \u00b5mol glucose/ \u00b5mol enzyme. min). A maximum glucose yield of 0.26 mM was obtained after a 1 h reaction with RalCDP-CBM37, while RalCDP presented a maximum glucose yield of 0.1 mM after 2 h. This higher rate of phosphorolysis seems to be caused by the enhanced adsorption capacity, increasing the effective local enzyme concentration on the insoluble substrate due to the addition of the CBM."

Here, we noticed that these differences led to an increase in the active site accessibility for long-chain oligosaccharides in RalCDP, as shown in Figure 2.\nAs was hypothesized from structural analysis and confirmed by 3D-models in Figure 2, RalCDP showed remarkable kinetic differences from other CDPs (detailed in Supplementary Table S2). This enzyme was active with substrates of different DP, ranging from monosaccharides to long-chain cellulosic oligosaccharides. Previously, TaCDP/CBP showed activity on both monosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides (Wu et al., 2017), but only CtCDP showed activity on long-chain oligosaccharides (Ye et al., 2011). RalCDP activity with monosaccharides was similar to that of TaCDP/CBP but showed a 3- and 9-fold higher activity than CtCDP, for PASC phosphorolysis and synthesis, respectively (Supplementary Table S2).\nDespite CDPs being active on cello-oligosaccharides, they are single modular proteins with no apparent CBM. However, we noticed that RalCDP presents a highly conserved N-terminal region, which is predicted to be involved in substrate binding, homodimer interaction, and/or a putative CBM. To analyze in depth the properties of these GH94 family proteins, we constructed two variants of RalCDP, one truncated mutant (Ral\u0394N63CDP) lacking the conserved N-terminal region and another one (RalCDP-CBM37) fused to a CBM of family 37, unique from R. albus (Xu et al., 2004; Ezer et al., 2008). The exact mechanism of the CBM37 in the R. albus cellulase system is still unknown, but its members recognize and bind strongly to cellulose and numerous other polysaccharides (Xu et al., 2004).\nCharacterization of the recombinant proteins reveals that the conserved N-terminal region is critical to homodimer assembly since the construction on the truncated mutant Ral\u0394N63CDP lead to a monomeric enzyme. This was also predicted in crystal structures of other GH94 enzymes (Hidaka et al., 2004; 2006; Bianchetti et al., 2011; Kuhaudomlarp et al., 2019). In addition, we identify that this modification of the quaternary structure decreased the enzyme capacity to catalyze the phosphorolysis of cellodextrins. Although, the activity in the direction of synthesis was only slightly affected in the truncated mutant. The kinetic analysis proved that differences in the enzymatic activity of monomeric Ral\u0394N63CDP resulted from its affinity decrease toward phosphate and increase for Glc-1P. Kinetics parameters for Glc-1P and Pi of RalCDP showed that enzyme relative affinity for these substrates was 80- and 360-fold higher than those reported for R. albus NE1 CDP (Sawano et al., 2013) (Supplementary Table S2). These results indicate that the\nminimal differences observed in the sequence of the loops conforming to the active site lead to a significant difference in substrate recognition.\nThe reduced phosphorolytic capacity observed inRal\u0394N63CDP has been exploited for the synthesis of soluble cello-oligosaccharides from cellobiose and Glc-1P at lower donor: acceptor ratios than those reported from other CDPs wild-type versions (Zhong et al., 2019; Zhong and Nidetzky, 2020; Nidetzky and Zhong, 2021). Ral\u0394N63CDP produced increasing amounts of cellotetraose over the reaction time course (Supplementary Figure S3). This confirms that this enzyme cannot extend the polysaccharide chain over four glucose units, as previously noticed in its kinetic characterization. These features of Ral\u0394N63CDP make it an excellent molecular tool for synthesizing short-chain cellooligosaccharides (Ubiparip, 2020; Zhong et al., 2020). Such soluble cellodextrins were proven to be useful dietary fibers and prebiotics that stimulate the growth of many healthy human gut bacteria more efficiently than inulin, trans-galactooligosaccharides, and cellobiose alone (Zhong et al., 2020). In addition, producing such controlled product composition eliminates the need for subsequent organic solvent purification steps.\nWorthy, CDPs could also be employed to degrade \u03b2-glucans by phosphorolysis and produce high-value Glc-1P from a cheap and easily accessible substrate like cellulose. Kinetic characterization of RalCDP showed higher catalytic efficiency for the synthetic rather than the phosphorolytic reaction with cellulosic polysaccharides PASC and CMC. However, the fusion of the CBM37 to the C-terminal of RalCDP improved both the kcat for phosphorolysis and the enzyme affinity to insoluble cellulosic substrates (without affecting homodimer assembly). The increase in phosphorolytic activity here achieved by the fusion of the CBM37 to RalCDP was 13.5-fold higher than that from the fusion of CBM9 to CtCDP (Ye et al., 2011) (Supplementary Table S3). Thus, RalCDP-CBM37 would constitutes an improved molecular tool to degrade cellulosic polysaccharides generating Glc-1P. Also, the fusion of CBM37 increased the synthetic reaction\u2019s catalytic efficiency, mainly reducing the enzyme KM (Supplementary Table S2). These effects on KM and catalysis with insoluble substrates were reported in studies fusing CBMs to different singledomain enzymes like cellulases, xylanases, or laccases. (Ravalason et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2021).\nThe analysis of the CDPs binding capacity suggests that RalCDP and Ral\u0394N63CDP could not bind to insoluble polysaccharides (PASC). However, the fusion of the CBM37 to RalCDP enhanced its adsorption capacity by 5-fold. The adsorption parameters obtained for this construct were similar to those achieved by the fusion of CBM9 to C. thermocellum CDP (Ye et al., 2011) (Supplementary Table S4). In the same way, CBM9 fusion did not modify the kinetic parameters with soluble substrates but improved enzyme activity on insoluble cellulose. Despite the poorly understood CBM37 binding mechanism to cellulose, our results suggest that this domain may direct the enzyme towards cellulose chain ends increasing the RalCDPCBM37 activity and binding capacity to insoluble polysaccharides in the same level. Furthermore, a slight\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org13\nincrement in optimum temperature and thermal stability was also observed after fusing CBM37 to RalCDP (Figure 4D; Supplementary Figure S2). This stabilization effect was previously noticed by the fusion of CBM3 and CBM9 to GH5 cellulase (Maharjan et al., 2018) and by linking CBM72 to Umcel9A (Duan et al., 2017). In the same way, the removal of the CBM from the thermostable endoglucanase from Phialophora sp. G5 observed a decrease in the enzyme\u2019s thermal stability (Zhao et al., 2012).\nAs a concluding remark, we proved that RalCDP has activity with a wide range of substrates, frommonosaccharides to long-chain polysaccharides. Also, we achieved two RalCDP versions with valuable features. Ral\u0394N63CDP catalyzes the reaction with higher efficiency in the synthetic direction under low Glc-1P:cellobiose ratios, an advantageous characteristic for the tightly controlled synthesis of short-chain cello-oligosaccharides. Conversely, RalCDP-CBM37 has enhanced activity on polysaccharides, thus enabling the prospect of producing sugars-1P from highly available cellulosic substrates or synthesizing long-chain oligosaccharides."
