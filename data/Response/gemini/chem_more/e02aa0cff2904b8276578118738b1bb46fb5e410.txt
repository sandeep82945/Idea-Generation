1. **Investigate the performance of DFPN with TCA on larger and more complex graphs.** The paper only provides a proof of completeness for DFPN with TCA on general graphs, but it does not provide any experimental results. It would be interesting to see how the algorithm performs on larger and more complex graphs, such as those that arise in real-world applications.
2. **Develop new diversity measures for synthesis routes.** The paper uses the total number of different intermediate molecules as a measure of diversity, but this measure is not well-defined and may not be the most appropriate for all applications. It would be interesting to develop new diversity measures that are more specific to the domain of synthesis planning.
3. **Apply DFPN* to other applications.** The paper only applies DFPN* to retrosynthesis, but it could be applied to other applications as well. For example, DFPN* could be used to find diverse solutions to combinatorial optimization problems or to generate diverse samples from a probability distribution.
4. **Develop new algorithms for finding diverse solutions to two-player games.** DFPN* is just one of many possible algorithms for finding diverse solutions to two-player games. It would be interesting to develop new algorithms that are more efficient or that can find more diverse solutions.
5. **Investigate the theoretical properties of DFPN and other algorithms for finding diverse solutions to two-player games.** The paper provides a proof of completeness for DFPN with TCA, but it does not provide any other theoretical results. It would be interesting to investigate the theoretical properties of DFPN and other algorithms for finding diverse solutions to two-player games, such as their time complexity and their convergence properties.
