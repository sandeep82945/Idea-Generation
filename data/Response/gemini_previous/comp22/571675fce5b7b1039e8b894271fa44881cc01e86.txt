1. **Investigate the use of transfer learning to improve the performance of the survival prediction model.** Transfer learning is a technique that allows a neural network to learn from a task that is related to the task that it is ultimately intended to perform. In this case, a pre-trained neural network could be used to learn from a dataset of images that are not related to brain tumors, and then the knowledge that the network has learned could be transferred to the task of predicting survival in brain tumor patients.


2. **Explore the use of other types of neural networks for survival prediction.** The paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for survival prediction. However, there are many other types of neural networks that could be used for this task, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These other types of neural networks may be able to learn more complex relationships between the features in the MRI images and the survival of the patients.


3. **Investigate the use of other imaging modalities for survival prediction.** The paper uses MRI images for survival prediction. However, there are other imaging modalities that could be used for this task, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. These other imaging modalities may be able to provide different information about the tumor that could be useful for predicting survival.


4. **Develop a method for predicting survival in brain tumor patients who have received treatment.** The paper focuses on predicting survival in brain tumor patients who have not received treatment. However, it would also be useful to develop a method for predicting survival in patients who have received treatment. This would be a more challenging task, as the treatment could affect the appearance of the tumor on the MRI images.


5. **Develop a method for predicting survival in brain tumor patients who have multiple tumors.** The paper focuses on predicting survival in brain tumor patients who have a single tumor. However, it would also be useful to develop a method for predicting survival in patients who have multiple tumors. This would be a more challenging task, as the multiple tumors could interact with each other and affect the patient's survival.
