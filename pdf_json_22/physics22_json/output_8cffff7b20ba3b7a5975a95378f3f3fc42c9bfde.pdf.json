Such a 2D h-BN liquid crystal lightmodulator can tune deepUV light with a phase retardation in the range of (0\u20131/8)\u03c0 , and is found to be stable after repeated operation.\nThis milestone study is a breakthrough as it is the first time that h-BN liquid crystal devices have been used to tune deep UV light (Fig. 1) [3], creating numerous exciting opportunities ahead. It is not difficult to imagine that the widely used birefringencetunable optics can be transferred from current visible and infrared regions to the technologically important deep UV region. Meanwhile, considering that 2D materials can be massively produced by top-down exfoliation\nmethods [5\u20137] or bottom-up growth methods [8], it is reasonable to infer that 2D-material-based inorganic liquid crystal devices can be scalably manufactured with low cost, as demonstrated in recent work using 2D mineral material vermiculite [9].\nConflict of interest statement.None declared.\nYoung Hee Lee1,2 1IBS Center for Integrated Nanostructure Physics, Institute for Basic Science, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea and 2Department of Energy Science and Department of Physics, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea E-mail: leeyoung@skku.edu"
