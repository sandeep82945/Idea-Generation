1. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of penicillic acid with other antibiotics.** Penicillic acid has been shown to have antibacterial activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, it is possible that its activity could be enhanced when combined with other antibiotics. This could lead to the development of new antibiotic combinations that are more effective against resistant bacteria.


2. **Explore the use of penicillic acid as a natural preservative.** Penicillic acid has been shown to have antifungal and antibacterial properties. This suggests that it could be used as a natural preservative in food and other products. This could help to reduce the use of synthetic preservatives, which can have harmful effects on human health.


3. **Investigate the potential of penicillic acid as a treatment for biofilm-associated infections.** Biofilms are communities of bacteria that are attached to a surface. They are often difficult to treat with antibiotics, as the bacteria in biofilms are protected from the effects of the drugs. Penicillic acid has been shown to have antibiofilm activity against a variety of bacteria. This suggests that it could be used as a treatment for biofilm-associated infections.


4. **Study the mechanisms of action of penicillic acid.** The exact mechanisms by which penicillic acid exerts its antibacterial and antifungal effects are not fully understood. Further research is needed to investigate these mechanisms. This could lead to the development of new strategies for using penicillic acid to treat infections.


5. **Evaluate the safety and toxicity of penicillic acid in animal models.** Before penicillic acid can be used as a therapeutic agent, it is important to evaluate its safety and toxicity in animal models. This will help to determine the safe dosage and administration route for penicillic acid.
