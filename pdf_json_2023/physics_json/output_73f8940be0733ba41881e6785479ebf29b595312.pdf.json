    "abstractText": "In modern era, deficiency of Vitamin D3 is predominantly due to limited exposure to sunlight and UV radiation resulting from indoor lifestyles. Several studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency can lead to chronic vascular inflammation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. This study introduces a green synthesis of novel bimetallic nanoporous composite, CuO/Ag using lemon extract. The synthesized nanoporous material, CuO/ Ag@lemon extract was characterized using several analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoparticles were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to prepare modified CuO/Ag@lemon extract\u2013GCE interface. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical properties investigation was carried out on the modified electrode. using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and amperometry for detecting of Vitamin D3. The DPV method displayed a linear response range of 0.02\u201322.5 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 2.62 nM, while the amperometric method showed a broader linear range of 0.25\u201323.25 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 2.70 nM with 82% modified electrode stability. The designed electrode exhibited a positive response to the inclusion of Vitamin D3 with electro-oxidation, reaching steady-state within 3.4 s, with 87% reproducibility within a day. The proposed method offers a rapid and sensitive platform for detection of Vitamin D3 with minimal interference from other molecules. The early diagnosis of Vitamin D3 deficiency using modified electrodes allows for early treatment, thereby preventing severe health complications.",

            "text": "In modern era, deficiency of Vitamin D3 is predominantly due to limited exposure to sunlight and UV radiation resulting from indoor lifestyles. Several studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency can lead to chronic vascular inflammation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. This study introduces a green synthesis of novel bimetallic nanoporous composite, CuO/Ag using lemon extract. The synthesized nanoporous material, CuO/ Ag@lemon extract was characterized using several analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoparticles were immobilized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to prepare modified CuO/Ag@lemon extract\u2013GCE interface. The electrocatalytic and electrochemical properties investigation was carried out on the modified electrode. using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and amperometry for detecting of Vitamin D3. The DPV method displayed a linear response range of 0.02\u201322.5 \u00b5M with a detection limit of 2.62 nM, while the amperometric method showed a broader linear range of 0.25\u201323.25 \u00b5M with a detection limit of 2.70 nM with 82% modified electrode stability. The designed electrode exhibited a positive response to the inclusion of Vitamin D3 with electro-oxidation, reaching steady-state within 3.4 s, with 87% reproducibility within a day. The proposed method offers a rapid and sensitive platform for detection of Vitamin D3 with minimal interference from other molecules. The early diagnosis of Vitamin D3 deficiency using modified electrodes allows for early treatment, thereby preventing severe health complications.\nIn recent days, BMNPs are esteemed for their exclusive and splendid optical, magnetic, electronic1\u20133, and catalytic properties because of the coalescence of two distinct metal nanoparticles in an unambiguous pattern4,5. Their enactment often exceeds over their single counterparts endorsed to synergistic effects of combined metal nanoparticles6\u20139.\nThe modern need is to develop novel BMNPs having higher aspect ratio and surface plasmon band and use them to improve sensors with better selectivity, sensitivity, stability, and reliability10\u201313. The synthesis of BMNPs with controlled structures shows electrocatalytic properties and hence are paramount important in the field of sensor technology14. The tuning of metal nano-surfaces in BMNPs upon introduction of second metal nanoparticles are categorized into three main effects viz. ensemble effect, ligand effect and strain effect15. These three effects can be considered as vital for improving the electrocatalytic properties of BMNPs by increasing energy\nOPEN\n1Department of Mathematics and Sciences, College of Arts and Applied Sciences, Dhofar University, Salalah PC 211, Oman. 2Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, Dhofar University, Salalah, PC 211, Oman. 3Department of Chemistry, Govt.

These solid-state methods are operated at high-temperatures and annealing process usually takes long periods18. However, green technology offers a new opportunity for synthesis of BMNPs as it is an ecologically conscious, meek, unwavering, prompt, and economical method19. Typically, the production of BMNPs entails combining two distinct metal solutions in an aqueous medium, along with a reducing agent that is derived from plant extracts, ensuring an environmentally conscious approach20. During the process of synthesizing metallic nanoparticles, phytochemicals serve dual functions: firstly, as a reducing agent, and secondly, as a stabilizing agent for the nanoparticles21,22. Plant-mediated synthesis of BMNPs involves use of plant extract that is rich in reducing agents (flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolic acid) which makes synthesized BMNPs more stable and varied in size and shape23. Karthik et\u00a0al.24\u201326 offer a novel method for green production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing different leaf extract. This ecologically friendly technology eliminates the need of hazardous chemicals while demonstrating the promise of AgNPs in critical applications.\nA review of the literature uncovered that lemon juice has been effectively employed for the synthesis and in-situ stabilization of silver and gold nanoparticles in aqueous environments27,28. These research highlight the importance of novel electrocatalytic materials and their many applications. Notably, several materials have showed outstanding catalytic characteristics in pharmaceutical analysis, helping to accurately determine individual medications. Furthermore, sophisticated nanocomposite materials have proven to be extremely effective at detecting environmental pollutants, particularly in the context of environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the impact of distinct doping techniques on materials has been investigated in the context of tackling issues in numerous scientific fields29\u201332. In this communication, we have used lemon juice rich in antioxidants viz., polyphenols, limonoids, ascorbic, and citric acid having potential to decrease ions possessing high oxidation states. We assume that an analogous mechanism may also works for the exploration of BM CuO/Ag nanoporous materials by utilizing lemon juice as both capping and reducing agent.\nIn recent times, vitamin D has gained significant attention in modern society, as individuals face challenges in obtaining the necessary amount of this essential vitamin for optimal health due to various socio-economic and environmental factors. Vitamin D is an indispensable fat-soluble vitamin for deciding bone health by sustaining the concentration levels of phosphorus and calcium in the body33. Vitamin D deficiencies can cause serious health problems including hypertension, Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, autoimmune diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders cardiovascular and cancer diseases34. Vitamin D exits in two main forms ergo calciferol (Vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3). Among two metabolic forms, the detection of Vitamin D3 form is preferred over vitamin D2, because meta-analysis shows that Vitamin D3 is more effectual at raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations than vitamin D235.\nThe unadventurous techniques used for identifying Vitamin-D concentration are mass spectrometry, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, radioimmunoassay, and chromatography etc36\u201338. Though above procedures show high exactitude and sensitivity but they need trained operators, centralized laboratories, a lengthy procedure for sample preparations, costly equipment, which hinders their applications for the on-site detection39. The demand for development of low cost, affordable, highly selective and highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for monitoring of vitamin D is emergent in the field of sensor technology. The designing of an electrochemical sensor by suitable modification of the electrode surface can remarkably improve the sensor response for the detection of target molecules40.\nIn this perspective, current work designates green exploration of well-controlled CuO/Ag BMNPs structuralized by n-hexane and lemon extract and immobilized these synthesized BMNPs for uncovering of Vitamin D3 (Fig.\u00a01). The synthesized CuO/Ag@n-hexane and CuO/Ag@lemon BMNPs were characterized by XRD, EDX, SEM and TEM techniques. The electrocatalytic performance of fabricated interfaces CuO/Ag@n-hexene-GCE and CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE was examined using CV, DPV, and amperometry for detection of Vitamin D3. The proposed method offers a rapid and sensitive platform for estimation of Vitamin D3 with minimal interference from other molecules. The early diagnosis of Vitamin D3 deficiency using modified electrodes allows for early treatment, thereby preventing severe health complications."

This system included a Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a glassy carbon working electrode (GCE) with a diameter of 3.0\u00a0mm. The working electrodes were prepared by modifying the surface of the unmodified glassy carbon electrode (b-GCE) with a dispersion of CuO/Ag@n-hexene and CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoporous materials. The preparation of this dispersion involved sonicating 5.0\u00a0mg of the synthesized monoliths separately in ethanol (10\u00a0mL). Prior to the modification of the electrode, the GCE surface was polished using alumina slurry, cleaned with ethanol via sonication for a duration of 10\u00a0min, rinsed with distilled water, and then dried at room temperature. A 10 \u03bcL volume of the prepared dispersion was applied onto the GCE surface, and the solvent was allowed to naturally evaporate at room temperature. To optimize the performance of the electrodes, the modified GCEs (CuO/Ag@n-hexene-GCE and CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE) underwent electrochemical activation by subjecting them to cyclic potential sweeps ranging from -1.0 to + 2.0\u00a0V in a 0.1\u00a0M HNO3 solution until steady voltammograms were obtained. Following each electrochemical study, the modified electrode surfaces were cleansed with a 1.0\u00a0mM NaOH solution by performing potential sweeps in the opposite direction (from 1.0\u00a0V to 0.0\u00a0V)."

The presence of these peaks indicates that bimetallic monolith has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure due to the presence of silver.\nFigure\u00a03B shows similar XRD peaks of synthesized CuO/Ag@lemon extract with a slight shift in their positions compared to CuO/Ag@n-hexane nanoporous material. Moreover, the presence of a structural directing agent (SDA) led to an increase in the intensity of diffraction peaks in XRD pattern of CuO/Ag@lemon extract compared to CuO/Ag@n-hexane. The variations in intensity are caused by differences in the scattering and absorption properties of the materials involved. CuO/Ag@lemon is expected to have greater scattering and absorption capabilities than hexane due to the addition of nanoparticles or other geometrical features. The reason for formation of monoliths can be attributed to the combined effect of surfactant and solvent used during\nFigure\u00a03. XRD patterns of synthesized (A) CuO/Ag@n-hexane and (B) CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoporous materials.\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:20482 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46774-w\nsynthesis process. The surfactant acts as a stabilizing agent, while solvent controls morphology of monoliths. XRD Studies confirms both types of synthesized monoliths exhibited crystalline behaviour.\nMorphological characterization of synthesized CuO/Ag@n-hexane and CuO/Ag@lemon extract nonporous materials The SEM (Fig.\u00a04A,B) study of synthesized BMNPs CuO/Ag structuralized by n-hexane and lemon extract obtained at 10\u00a0\u03bcm and 1\u00a0\u03bcm scale shows bimetallic nanoparticles are stabilized by covalent bonds between copper, silver, and oxygen atoms and in addition the presence of n-hexane and lemon extract acts as structural directing agents. Structural directing agents (SDAs) help direct growth of bimetallic nanoparticles and maintain their specific structure or shape. In present studies, n-hexane and lemon extract as SDAs ensure CuO/Ag BMNPs maintain their bimetallic structure and do not undergo unwanted reactions. The non-polar solvent n-hexane produces less crystalline bimetallic nanoparticles due to weaker stabilization and less effective structural directing properties. In contrast, a polar lemon extract containing organic compounds leads to more clear and uniform nanoparticle formation through stronger stabilization and more effective structural directing properties. These observations suggest that the choice of solvent and extract can significantly impact the properties and formation of synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles. The crosslinking between Cu and Ag, indicating that there may be metal\u2013metal bonds present in the bimetallic nanoparticles. These bonds contribute to the stability and unique properties of the BMNPs and the role of n-hexane and lemon extract as structural directing agents helps to ensure that these bonds are maintained.\nFigure\u00a04C of CuO/Ag@n-hexane nanoporous material at 200.0\u00a0nm scale reveals a porous structure with nanoparticles dispersed throughout. The pores are likely formed due to the removal of n-hexane during the synthesis process. The nanoparticles appear to be agglomerated, indicating weaker stabilization and less effective structural directing by n-hexane. Figure\u00a04D of CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoporous composite at 50.0\u00a0nm scale reveals a similar porous structure, but with more uniform and clear nanoparticle formation, as observed in the inset single particle image at 20.0\u00a0nm scale. This suggests that the use of lemon extract as a polar solvent and structural directing agent results in better stabilization and more effective structural directing of the nanoparticles.\nFigure\u00a04E shows the diameter distribution of CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoporous material, indicating a relatively narrow size distribution. This is likely due to the ability of the organic compounds in the lemon extract to act as surfactants or as a capping agent, controlling the size and dispersity of the nanoparticles during the synthesis process. Figure\u00a04F shows the EDX analysis of CuO/Ag@lemon extract nanoporous material, confirming the presence of silver, copper, and oxygen elements in the bimetallic nanoparticles. The relative abundance of each element suggests that the synthesis process has been successful in producing bimetallic nanoparticles with desired elemental compositions.\nElectroanalytical determination of Vitamin D3 at CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE interface Cyclic voltammetry was employed to investigate the electrochemical oxidation of Vitamin D3 at modified electrodes including GCE, CuO/Ag@n-hexane-GCE, and CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE. The experiments were conducted in 0.1\u00a0M KCl, serving as the supporting electrolyte, with 0.02\u00a0\u00b5M Vitamin D3. The potential range was set from 0.1 to 0.5\u00a0V, and the scan rate was 10 mVs-1 (Fig.\u00a06A). The results indicated that all three modified electrodes (GCE, CuO/Ag@hexane extract-GCE, and CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE) exhibited a distinct oxidative peak in the forward scan, while no peak was observed in the reverse scan. This observation suggests that the oxidation process of Vitamin D3 at these modified electrodes primarily involves the oxidation of the triene moiety present in Vitamin D3. This is attributed to the electron-rich nature of Vitamin D3, which contains a triene moiety at the fifth, seventh, and tenth positions, along with a hydroxyl group at the third position (19). The Fig.\u00a05. mechanism of electrooxidation of Vitamin D3 involves oxidation of triene moiety.41\u201344 However, among three conjugated double bounds (C8\u2013C19), it is not certain that where the oxidation occurs primarily. Literature reported proposes hydroxylation may occur at C7 and C8 or at C10 and C19 positions45. These reported studies strongly suggest oxidation of Vitamin D3 is an irreversible process involves 2 electrons and 2 protons transfer. On the basis of these studies mechanism of electrooxidation of Vitamin D3 can be summarized in Scheme\u00a02.\nTo determine whether the oxidation process on the CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE modified electrode occurred under adsorption or diffusion control, the impact of scan rate on the peak current of Vitamin D3 was investigated. The experiments were conducted in 0.1\u00a0M KCl as a supporting electrolyte, with a Vitamin D3 concentration of 0.02\u00a0\u00b5M, within a potential range of 0.1 to 0.5\u00a0V. The scan rate was varied from 10 mVs\u22121 to 190 mVs\u22121 (Fig.\u00a06B). It was observed that as the scan rate increased, the peak currents also increased, and the peak potential shifted in a positive direction. These findings confirmed the diffusion-controlled oxidation of Vitamin D3 at the developed interface (Fig.\u00a06C).\nTo create main sight about electrocatalytic property of modified electrodes towards electrochemical detection of Vitamin D3, both CV and DPV techniques were employed. Figure\u00a06A shows electrochemical oxidation (CV) of Vitamin D3 at GCE, modified CuO/Ag@n-hexane\u2014GCE, and CuO/Ag@lemon extract\u2014GCE. A broad oxidation peak (0.25\u00a0V) was obtained at GCE, whereas less positive potential peak (0.15\u00a0V) and two-fold higher oxidation current was obtained at CuO/Ag@hexane \u2212 GCE electrode. These results of modified CuO/Ag@hexane \u2212 GCE electrode justify an advantage of using bimetallic nanoporous CuO/Ag materials for sensing of Vitamin D3. The reason for higher electrocatalytic activity of CuO/Ag@hexane \u2212 GCE modified electrode is attributed to the synergistic effects of bimetallic CuO/Ag nanoporous materials which outperform in comparison to their single-component counterparts by improving current density, lowering over-potential and hence enhancing electron transfer kinetics between electrode\u2013electrolyte interfaces. Moreover, a substantial increase in peak current (fourfold higher) of Vitamin D3 oxidation was observed at CuO/Ag@lemon extract\u2014GCE interface credited to presence of citric acid in lemon extracted CuO/Ag nanoparticles which accelerates the reduction of\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:20482 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46774-w\nmetal precursors, increases surface area, porosity and aspect ratio and hence leads to higher sensitivity towards detection of Vitamin D3. The electrocatalytic activity of the CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE interface was further evaluated using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), as shown in Fig.\u00a07A. The obtained results from DPV were\nFigure\u00a04. SEM Images of (A) CuO/Ag@n-hexane nonporous BMNPs at 10\u00a0\u00b5m (B) CuO/Ag@lemon extract nonporous material at 1\u00a0\u00b5m.

DPV was used to assess the linearity of the framework and calculate the limit of detection (LOD) under the optimized conditions. Figure\u00a07 (B) demonstrates DPV curves for electrochemical oxidation of a concentration range of Vitamin D3 at CuO/Ag@lemon extract\u2014 GCE interface in 0.1\u00a0M of PBS (pH = 7.1). It was observed that anodic peak current for Vitamin D3 oxidation increases linearly with subsequent increase in [Vit. D3] with a slight positive shift. The constructed calibration curve (Ip vs [Vit. D3]) shown in Fig.\u00a07 (C) is apparently linear over a concentration range of (0.02\u201322.5\u00a0\u00b5M) with a slope of 0.735\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0\u03bcM\u22121 and a correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.994). The detection limit (DL3\u03c3) of 2.62\u00a0nM (S/N = 3), where \u201c3\u03c3\u201d represented as standard-deviation from six-blank measurements. The present report and regression data along with the detection limit were very compared with literature values estimated by reported electrochemical measurements (Table\u00a01). The coherent sensitivity of present system is attributed to synergetic effects of bimetallic CuO/Ag nanoporous materials. These synergetic activities of synthesized BMNPs (CuO/ Ag) properties acceleration of faster electron transfer kinetics at electrode surface by increasing charge transfer\nFigure\u00a05.

The current electrochemical approach provides numerous benefits when compared to previously reported methods for detecting [Vitamin D3]: (i) simple fabrication process, (ii) long-term stability of modified interface, (iii) high sensitivity (2.62\u00a0nM). These analytical characteristics make this method highly suitable for the detection of [Vitamin D3].\nIn order to additional asses the performance of modified CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE interface amperometric method was also applied under continuously stirred electrolyte solution at a constant applied potential. As shown in Fig.\u00a08 A, 0.02\u00a0\u00b5M of Vitamin D3 was injected into constantly stirred 0.1\u00a0M KCl electrolyte solution, the CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE modified electrode exhibited a rapid amperometric response in 3.4\u00a0s and obtained response was constantly stable for more than 1000\u00a0s. Further, CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE modified electrode was used to examine concentration dependent activity towards determination of Vitamin D3. As shown in Fig.\u00a08 B, the periodical injection of Vitamin D3 from 0.02\u00a0\u00b5M to 0.2\u00a0\u00b5M to the continuously stirred 0.1\u00a0M KCl electrolyte solution displayed a noticeable amperometric responses indicated that significant sensitivity towards the wide-range detection of Vitamin D3.\nThe calibration plot was derived from function of Vitamin D3 concentrations vs. amperometric current response that exhibited a linear fit indicating potential sensitivity against wide-range of Vitamin D3 (Fig.\u00a08C). The LOD of developed sensing platform was obtained by using linearity plot from Fig.\u00a08C about 2.70\u00a0nM (S/N = 3), where \u201c3\u03c3\u201d represented as standard-deviation from six-blank measurements. The LOD of as fabricated CuO/ Ag@lemon extract-GCE modified electrode was indeed comparable with other noble and non-noble metal nanostructures-based Vitamin D3 interface (Table\u00a01).\nFigure\u00a07.

The selectivity assessment was conducted by introducing 20\u00a0\u00b5M of various compounds into an electrochemical cell containing a 0.05\u00a0\u00b5M of Vitamin D3 solution. Analysis of Fig.\u00a09 demonstrates that the amperometric responses of Vitamin D3 remained largely unaffected by the presence of interfering agents, indicating that the developed interface maintains its robustness even in the presence of these compounds.\nThe CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE modified electrode demonstrated reproducibility and reusability when tested using the amperometric technique under equivalent conditions. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values for reproducibility and reusability were found to be 94% and 82%, respectively, falling within an acceptable range. This confirms the good shelf-life and reproducibility of the fabricated CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE interface. Furthermore, the stability of the fabricated interface was evaluated over a period of 30\u00a0days, with measurements taken at intervals of 7\u00a0days. It was observed that the fabricated interface maintained 92.3% of its initial current response after 25\u00a0days and 82.7% after 30\u00a0days. These results indicate that the CuO/Ag@lemon extract-GCE platform is deemed suitable shelf life of 25\u00a0days."

The deficiency has been linked to various health complications, including cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods used for the synthesis of BMNPs are costly and result in the production of hazardous substances, posing risks to the environment. In order to minimize the potential toxicity in the environment, it is crucial to adopt greener approaches, which are environmentally friendly and safe. Therefore, the present study\nFigure\u00a08.

Various experimental factors were optimized, including contact time, the concentration of the extract, and metal ion concentration, to achieve the synthesis of CuO/Ag BMNPs. This study presents a novel nanoporous material, CuO/Ag@lemon extract synthesized using the sol\u2013gel method, and characterized using TEM, XRD, SEM and EDX techniques. The electrochemical properties of these bimetallic nanoparticles were investigated using CV, DPV, and amperometry methods for detecting Vitamin D3. The remarkable sensitivity of the current system is imputed to the synergistic effects of the BMNPs material (CuO/Ag), which enhance electron transfer kinetics due to its high conductivity and improved charge transport capabilities. These effects are not achievable with monometallic nanoparticles alone. The proposed method offers advantages of being relatively fast, simple, and cost-effective compared to previously reported techniques used for Vitamin D3 analysis. This method provides a rapid and sensitive platform for detection of Vitamin D3 with minimal interference from other molecules, enabling early diagnosis and treatment of Vitamin D3 deficiency to prevent severe health complications."
