    "abstractText": "Purpose of the review This review summarizes the updated literature on airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It provides guidance for clinicians to carefully incorporate the most recent recommendations related to airway management, oxygenation, and ventilation both during CPR and after return of spontaneous circulation. Recent Findings The American Heart Association and the International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care provide updated recommendations related to airway management during CPR, which focus on advanced airway strategies in out-of-the hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that any single advanced airway technique is superior to the other in terms of survival and neurological outcomes. There is controversy as to whether early advanced airway management could lead to favorable outcome. Summary Advanced airway strategies and alternatives to airway management (including passive oxygenation) can be utilized in different settings while minimizing interruption in chest compressions.",

Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are important treatment steps; however, adequate oxygenation and ventilation are also important in preventing organ damage from hypoxia. Recent trials have evaluated the impact of the choice of airway management\nand the timing of airway management strategies on the survival to hospital discharge and neurological outcomes. This review presents a summary of the recent literature and the most recent guidelines regarding the changes in airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for adult cardiac arrest as well as for pediatric and neonatal resuscitation. Many of the studies were applied to OHCA setting, and the recommendations for IHCA are extrapolated from OHCA studies.\nPerioperative cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest outside the operating room present challenges to anesthesiologists and other clinicians who provide airway management. There are few studies that emphasize the specifics of airway management during perioperative cardiac arrest and outside the operating room cardiac arrest. As a result, clinicians providing airway management should refer to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines when performing advanced airway management during CPR.

Airway management during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provides adequate oxygenation and ventilation, prevents hypoxic injury, and increases the chances of overall and neurological survival. In the 2019 updated guidelines, recommendations were updated related to the use of advanced airway devices, the need for training, and the need to master an advanced airway strategy in addition to a second (backup) strategy. The guidelines also emphasized the use of capnography [3\u2022]. The 2019 and 2020 focused updates on ACLS guidelines emphasized that either bag-mask ventilation or an advanced airway strategy may be considered during CPR for adult cardiac arrest in any setting while minimizing interruptions in chest compression [4\u2022\u2022]. Placement of an advanced airway device can be delayed until after 2 rounds of chest compressions are completed if bag mask ventilation is adequate. The 2020 BLS guidelines simplified rescue breathing to be 10 breaths per minutes or every 6\u00a0s while using either a supraglottic airway (SGA) or an endotracheal tube (ETT). The use of an SGA is prioritized in\u00a0situations where clinicians have received minimal training in airway management or when the intubation success rate is low (Fig.\u00a01) [4\u2022\u2022]. In 2021, the international consensus on CPR and emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) released an updated summary on advanced life support, including special situations such as airway management in drowning, use of barrier devices, and the performance of CPR in the prone position [5\u2022\u2022]."

In a report using the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR), the analysis of 1,691,472 anesthetics included procedures performed in the radiology and gastrointestinal suites, and reported the incidence to be 5.6 cardiac arrests per 10,000 anesthetics [7]. Many risk factors have contributed to the incidence of perioperative cardiac arrest, including anesthesia for emergency procedures, trauma patients, and hemodynamically unstable patients. Airway-related cardiac arrest can result from post-intubation hemodynamic instability, difficult airway and hypoxia, or during emergence and extubation [8]. Other airway-related causes of cardiac arrests include respiratory depression during Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) or conscious sedation. In all situations, perioperative cardiac arrest can contribute to the complexity and difficulty of airway management during CPR. During perioperative cardiac arrest related to airway management, if an advanced airway is not in place, the clinician managing the airway should revert back to the basics of ACLS and consider an advanced airway management strategy [4\u2022\u2022]. The basics of advanced airway management during cardiac arrest include bag-mask ventilation or placement of an advanced airway management device (either an SGA or ETT) based on the skills of the airway manager."

Rescue breathing can be performed via mouth-tomouth, with or without a barrier, or via bag mask ventilation (BMV). Visible chest rise is required to confirm the appropriate technique while avoiding excessive ventilation. Rescue breathing should be delivered as one breath every 6\u00a0s (or 10 breaths per minute). Once CPR is started, two ventilations should be initiated after completing 30 compressions [9, 10]. Once return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is obtained, rescue breaths should continue at the same rate, if the patient is not spontaneously breathing, while performing pulse checks every 2\u00a0min. Per the 2020 updated AHA guidelines, either BMV or an advanced airway strategy may be considered during CPR to provide rescue breathing for\n1 3\nadult cardiac arrest in any setting, based on the provider\u2019s skills and the situation [4\u2022\u2022]."

(Fig.\u00a01). In settings where providers receive minimal training for endotracheal tube placement or the tracheal intubation success rate is low, then SGA placement would be preferred. In an in-hospital setting, an advanced airway should be used by expert providers trained in airway management. Many of the airway recommendations for airway management in IHCA are extrapolated from the OHCA studies.\nThe updated ACLS guidelines released in 2020 emphasized that clinicians should master one advanced airway technique as well as a second technique as a backup strategy. Multiple recent studies have compared the use of an SGA versus an ETT and found no difference in survival or neurological outcomes between the two devices [11, 12]. As a result, the 2020 updated guidelines provided recommendations to use either technique during CPR in any setting (OHCA or IHCA). In a recent observational study including 14,969 patients, use of an early advanced airway strategy in the form of endotracheal intubation (ETI) was correlated with favorable neurological outcomes [13]. Timing of advanced airway placement has been evaluated in 2 recent studies. Okubo et\u00a0al. performed a secondary analysis of the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART) to evaluate the impact of timing of advanced airway placement on patient outcome. In this analysis, the authors evaluated different cohorts based on timing of advanced airway placement and divided them into 4 cohorts (0- < 5\u00a0min, 5- < 10\u00a0min, 10- < 15\u00a0min, and 15\u201320\u00a0min). The results showed no association with the timing of advanced airway placement and survival to hospital discharge. Delay in advanced airway placement was associated with poor one month neurological outcomes among patients with OHCA [14, 15\u2022\u2022]. However, in an observational study of a nationwide cohort in Japan, early endotracheal intubation was associated with improved survival for a non-shockable rhythm (but not for a shockable rhythm) when compared to delayed endotracheal intubation [16\u2022\u2022]. In a recent RCT comparing i-gel SGA placement versus ETI (AIRWAYS-2 trial) in an OHCA setting, there were no statistically significant differences between both interventions in terms of patient outcomes at 3 and 6\u00a0months [17\u2022]. When comparing SGA and ETI in cost-effectiveness and quality of life, the results showed no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of cost or quality of life [18\u2022\u2022]. However in an earlier study evaluating the impact of early ETI on survival in IHCA, the results showed that early intubation was associated with decreased survival to discharge [19]. Since the data is conflicting related to the ideal timing for advanced airway placement, it is recommended to follow the ACLS recommendations to use an advanced airway strategy when feasible and based on the clinical situation."

Either option could be chosen based on the skills of the provider and the success rate of endotracheal intubation (ETI). The use of an SGA allows effective ventilation that results in a waveform capnography pattern similar to that obtained with an ETT in place. There is no evidence that an ETT is superior to a SGA in terms of survival and neurological outcomes. In the initial analysis of the Pragmatic Airway Resuscitation Trial (PART) comparing the outcomes of a laryngeal tube (LT) versus ETI in OHCA, the investigators found that the initial insertion of an LT was associated with significantly greater 72-h survival compared to initial ETI [12]. In a secondary analysis of the PART trial comparing the outcomes of BMV versus advanced airway placement, authors found that BMV was associated with improved OHCA outcomes, improved survival to discharge, and neurologically intact survival compared to an advanced airway strategy [20]. Advanced airway insertion first pass success was associated with increased ROSC but no other outcomes [21\u2022]. In another secondary analysis of PART trial comparing the time of interruption of chest compressions, the investigators found that LT placement was associated with a shorter duration of interruption of chest compressions [22].\nEndotracheal Intubation Techniques\nSeveral studies have evaluated the success rate of ETI when using different intubation techniques during CPR. In 2 recent studies comparing the success rate of intubation using videolaryngoscopy (VL) versus direct laryngoscopy during CPR, the studies showed that the use of VL was associated with a higher first attempt success rate compared to direct laryngoscopy [23, 24]. VL was also associated with better glottic visualization and lower esophageal intubation rate. In another prospective study, the use of VL in an anesthesiologist-staffed helicopter emergency medical service was associated with high first pass success rates [25]. There is also preliminary evidence that the use of VL may achieve intubation with minimal interruption of chest compressions [23, 26, 27]. However, there may be limitations to the use of VL in OHCA settings, such as the presence of blood, vomit, or secretions, or bright light, which can obscure visualization of the glottis on the video screen and may decrease intubation success rates."

During cardiac arrest, there may not be adequate time to obtain more information on the patient regarding previous airway difficulty. Availability of appropriate equipment and supportive personnel will contribute to the success of airway management. Although videolaryngoscopy (VL) is a preferred method in these circumstances by many providers, the availability of VL or the contamination of the airway with vomiting or blood may reduce the success rate of VL. In the ICU setting, the use of high flow nasal cannula for pre-oxygenation was proven to be effective in reducing the severity of desaturation [44]."

The AHA published updated guidelines related to BLS and ACLS in adults, pediatric, and neonatal patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [45\u2022\u2022]. The goal was to provide guidance for healthcare providers who care for patients in cardiac arrest while maintaining their safety [45\u2022\u2022, 46\u2022\u2022]. Recommendations related to oxygenation, ventilation, and airway management focused on the use of strategies to minimize the aerosolization risk. Attaching a High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is recommended. Patients in cardiac arrest should be intubated with a cuffed tube at the earliest possible opportunity, and when intubating patients, it is better to minimize attempts by allowing the most experienced provider to intubate and to pause chest compressions during intubation. Other recommendations related to airway management focused on the use of VL to reduce the exposure to aerosolized particles. If intubation is delayed, an SGA with a HEPA filter could be an alternative.\nWith increased knowledge about the virus, a more stable personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and vaccination of frontline healthcare providers and the public, the AHA released updated guidance in 2021 and 2022 for healthcare providers aimed to reduce the provider risk to infection, reduce the provider\u2019s exposure, and provide timely care [46\u2022\u2022] The 2022 recommendations emphasize the use of PPE before performing CPR, defibrillation and airway management [47]."

Assisted ventilation using BMV is well accepted, however, it may result in interruptions of chest compressions and increased risk of aspiration and barotrauma. The use of an advanced airway technique may result in improved ventilation, reduce the risk of aspiration, and minimize interruptions in chest compressions. The 2019\u20132020 updated pediatric basic and advanced life support guidelines focused on recommendations for advanced airway management. Recent trials showed that ETI and BMV achieve similar rates of survival and neurological outcomes in pediatric OHCA [52, 53]. Similarly, there were no differences in the outcomes between SGA and ETI. However, the data is lacking in regards to recommendations for the use of an advanced airway in IHCA. In a recent large cohort study using ETI in pediatric OHCA, results showed that it was associated with worse outcomes regardless of the etiology of the cardiac arrest [54\u2022]. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis,\n1 3\nETI or SGA were not superior to BMV in the resuscitation of children in cardiac arrest [55]. Regardless of the airway strategy chosen, the ventilation rate in children should be 20\u201330 breaths per minute, or 1 breath every 2\u20133\u00a0s while performing CPR [56\u2022]. Excessive ventilation should be avoided and the use of supplemental oxygen should be titrated to target an oxygen saturation of 94\u201399% [56\u2022, 57]. In an updated international consensus on CPR and ECC science for pediatric life support, most recommendations from the 2019 and 2020 guidelines are similar regarding choice of airway device, oxygenation, and ventilation during cardiac arrest, with the only change being a focus on the preferred use of BMV for ventilation in the pediatric OHCA [58]."

For newborns who do not initiate adequate breathing efforts after stimulation, clinicians should deliver effective ventilation using a facemask. If not effective, providers should check for airway patency and apply positive pressure ventilation pressure. If this strategy continues to be ineffective, then an advanced airway should be utilized, either an SGA or an ETT. While supporting oxygenation and ventilation, heart rate (HR) is monitored and chest compressions should be initiated if the HR is below 60 beats/minute. Per the 2015\u20132020 AHA guidelines for neonatal resuscitation, suctioning the airway is reserved only if the airway appears obstructed or if positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is required [61]. Routine suctioning is not recommended as suctioning may lead to bradycardia, apnea, or risk of iatrogenic infection.\nFor preterm newborn infants who are receiving PPV for bradycardia or inadequate respiratory efforts, the current guidelines recommend against the routine use of sustained inflation for more than 5\u00a0s. Data is lacking for full term and late preterm infants as to the duration of insufflation needed for ventilation. In addition, the 2020 guidelines endorse prior recommendations regarding the use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during initial ventilation of premature newborn infants. The recent guidelines also endorse prior recommendations regarding the use of continuous positive airway pressure over intubation or intermittent PPV. For preterm newborns who require respiratory support, it is recommended to start with lower oxygen concentrations (21\u201330%) rather than higher concentrations (60\u2013100%), then titrate oxygen concentration using pulse oximetry [59\u2022\u2022, 60, 62].

Common causes of maternal cardiac arrest include hemorrhage, heart failure, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and complications of anesthesia. Ventilation and oxygenation are important components of management in the setting of pregnancy due to increased maternal metabolism, increased oxygen consumption, and decreased functional reserve capacity caused by the gravid uterus. This makes pregnant women more prone to hypoxia, which might result in fetal hypoxia that can have detrimental effects. As a result, an advanced airway strategy should be performed early during maternal cardiac arrest. The airway of a pregnant patient is anticipated to be difficult, due to distorted landmarks caused by edema and increased risk of bleeding due to vascularity. Hence, it is recommended that the most experienced healthcare provider performs the intubation. To maintain ventilation in the unstable pregnant patient, providers should maintain a higher PEEP and a plateau pressure less than 30. Oxygenation goals should be higher when compared to the non-pregnant population, in order to avoid fetal hypoxemia. The goals of ventilation should aim at lower PaCO2 values of 30 which maintain the maternal\u2013fetal CO2 gradient and an appropriate hemoglobin-oxygen affinity [63]."
