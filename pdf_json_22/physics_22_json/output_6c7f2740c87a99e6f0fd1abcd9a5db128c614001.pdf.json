With a spectrum of manufacturing processes being developed to engineer the heterogeneous structures, ferroelectrets are made with attractive piezoelectric properties well-suited for applications, such as pressure sensors, acoustic transducers, etc. However, the sources of the macro-dipole charges have usually been the same, microscopic dielectric barrier discharges within the voids, induced when the ferroelectrets are poled under a large electric field typically via a so-called corona poling, resulting in the separation and trapping of opposite charges into the interior walls of the voids. Such a process is inherently self-limiting, as the reverse internal field from the macro-dipoles eventually extinguishes the microdischarges, resulting in limited density of ions and not too high overall piezoelectric performance. Here, a new method to form ferroelectrets with gigantic electroactivity is proposed and demonstrated with the aid of an external ion booster. A laminate consisting of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and fluorinated-ethylene-propylene (FEP) was prefilled with bipolar ions produced externally by an ionizer and sequentially poled to force the separation of positive and negative ions into the open fibrous structure, rendering an impressive piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 1600 pC/N\ufffdan improvement by a factor of 4 in comparison with the d33 of a similar sandwich poled with nonenhanced corona poling. The (pre)filling clearly increases the ion density in the open voids significantly. The charges stored in the open-cell structure stays at a high level for at least 4 months. In addition, an all-organic nanogenerator was made from an ePTFE-based ferroelectret, with conducting poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) coated fabric electrodes. When poled with this ion-boosting process, it yielded an output power twice that of a similar sample poled in a conventional corona-only process. The doubling in output power is mainly brought about by the significantly higher charge density achieved with the aid of external booster. Furthermore, aside from the bipolar ions, extra monopolar ions can during the corona poling be blown into the open pores by using for instance a negative ionic hair dryer to produce a unipolar ePTFE-based ferroelectret with its d33 coefficient enhanced by a factor of 3. Ion-boosting poling thus unleashes a new route to produce bipolar or unipolar open-cell ferroelectrets with highly enhanced piezoelectric response.",

With a spectrum of manufacturing processes being developed to engineer the heterogeneous structures, ferroelectrets are made with attractive piezoelectric properties well-suited for applications, such as pressure sensors, acoustic transducers, etc. However, the sources of the macro-dipole charges have usually been the same, microscopic dielectric barrier discharges within the voids, induced when the ferroelectrets are poled under a large electric field typically via a so-called corona poling, resulting in the separation and trapping of opposite charges into the interior walls of the voids. Such a process is inherently self-limiting, as the reverse internal field from the macro-dipoles eventually extinguishes the microdischarges, resulting in limited density of ions and not too high overall piezoelectric performance. Here, a new method to form ferroelectrets with gigantic electroactivity is proposed and demonstrated with the aid of an external ion booster. A laminate consisting of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and fluorinated-ethylene-propylene (FEP) was prefilled with bipolar ions produced externally by an ionizer and sequentially poled to force the separation of positive and negative ions into the open fibrous structure, rendering an impressive piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 1600 pC/N\ufffdan improvement by a factor of 4 in comparison with the d33 of a similar sandwich poled with nonenhanced corona poling. The (pre)filling clearly increases the ion density in the open voids significantly. The charges stored in the open-cell structure stays at a high level for at least 4 months. In addition, an all-organic nanogenerator was made from an ePTFE-based ferroelectret, with conducting poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) coated fabric electrodes. When poled with this ion-boosting process, it yielded an output power twice that of a similar sample poled in a conventional corona-only process. The doubling in output power is mainly brought about by the significantly higher charge density achieved with the aid of external booster. Furthermore, aside from the bipolar ions, extra monopolar ions can during the corona poling be blown into the open pores by using for instance a negative ionic hair dryer to produce a unipolar ePTFE-based ferroelectret with its d33 coefficient enhanced by a factor of 3. Ion-boosting poling thus unleashes a new route to produce bipolar or unipolar open-cell ferroelectrets with highly enhanced piezoelectric response.

PP electrets can only be applied for long periods of time if they are kept below 60 \u00b0C.2 Ferroelectrets made of a fluorinated polymer show a much better thermal and long-term stability.10\u221212 Expanded PTFE foam with open cells is produced by heating PTFE rods that are next quickly stretched.13 The d33 of neat ePTFE is fairly low after charging.1 By putting two FEP films on the top and bottom of an ePTFE layer, the piezoelectric coefficient of the sandwich can be increased to about 400 pC/N, due to added charges trapped at the upper and lower FEP-ePTFE interfaces. Hence, most ePTFE-based ferroelectrets are made as sandwiches with the ePTFE foam enclosed between FEP films.14 There are also other fluorinated polymer-based ferroelectrets with patterned pores made by laser cutting or with templates.12,15\nApart from intrinsic properties such as the elastic modulus and the dielectric constant of the polymers, the piezoelectric activity of ferroelectrets is mainly determined by the total charge stored. The latter is related to the porous structure and the density of charges trapped at the pore interface.11,16\nUsually, macro-dipoles inside pores are generated via microplasma discharges triggered by high electric fields from external corona or contact charging.15,17 Paschen breakdown is initiated at the threshold voltage, whereupon further discharges occur when the voltage increases. The reversed internal electric field matches up with the external field during the voltage rampdown stage. After the external field is removed, the retained positive and negative charges form macro-dipoles across the pores.17 Von Seggern et al.11,16 studied the influence of porosity and film thickness on the remanent interface charges in ePTFE-based sandwich ferroelectrets. A very high poling field is required to increase the charge density, when porosity and porous-layer thickness are reduced. Hence, the window for optimization is quite limited. However, if the internal charges are supplemented by an external ion source, the piezoelectric performance can be improved substantially. An ePTFE-based ferroelectret is very suitable for external injection of positive or negative ions, owing to its open-porous structure.\nPiezoelectric nanogenerators are indispensable in wearable electronics for harvesting the mechanical energy from human motion and for converting it into electricity for powering other devices.18 An all-organic ferroelectret nanogenerator (FENG) w i t h p o l y ( 3 , 4 - e t h y l e n e d i o x y t h i o p h e n e ) : p o l y - (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS)-coated fabric as electrodes has been proposed previously.19,20 Fabric electrodes have not only the advantage of being flexible, soft, biocompatible, and skin-friendly7,21 but also of being porous and compliant; they may also form two charge-spring dipole layers22,23 in addition to\ufffdand in the same direction as\ufffdthe inner ferroelectret charge-spring dipoles. The rather unexpected additional dipole moments might contribute considerably to the overall piezoelectric response.20,22,23 Therefore, the ePTFE-based ferroelectret polarized by the new charging method was assembled deliberately with fabric electrodes to build a highperformance ferroelectret nanogenerator and demonstrate its outstanding functionality.\nIt has been reported24\u221226 that FEP-based unipolar ferroelectrets also show significant piezoelectricity and high thermal stability. The unipolar ferroelectrets were produced in a straightforward way by charging artificial open tubular cavities in FEP negatively and covering them with an uncharged, one-sided metallized film. Negative corona charging should be applied,27 as negative electret charges are usually more stable than positive charges in the fluorocarbonbased Teflon family of polymers. Obviously, ePTFE-based ferroelectrets with their inherent open cells are also attractive for monopolar or unipolar charging. Negative corona charging of ePTFE-based ferroelectrets can easily be combined with a simultaneous blow-in of negative ions. In this way, we have studied the feasibility of a fill-in of extra monopolar ions and explored the enhancement in piezoelectric activity.\nIn this paper, two ferroelectrets with a FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP\u2212 ePTFE\u2212FEP 5-layer structure and different thicknesses were polarized by means of corona poling and through corona charging with an extra boost of external positive and negative ions. The beneficial effect of adding ions of both polarities on the piezoelectric activity shows up in the enhanced d33 coefficient. The rise in piezo-response has also been\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12185 ACS Appl. Mater.

The charging involving blow-in of extra ions was also extended to unipolar corona charging."

            "text": "2.1. Preparation of ePTFE-Based Sandwich Structures. Expanded-PTFE (ePTFE) films with average pore sizes of 1 or 3 \u03bcm and a thickness of approximately 20 \u03bcm were provided by BHA Altair. 12.5 \u03bcm thick FEP films were supplied by Goodfellow Corp. According to our previous study on ferroelectret nanogenerators, an FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP stack with an ePTFE pore size of 3 \u03bcm yields the highest piezoelectric activity owing to the good trade-off between the number of macro-dipoles and the overall elastic modulus. Therefore, FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP (or FeFeF) stacks with an average pore size of 3 \u03bcm were fused together by means of a Carver Laboratory hot press. The sandwich was held at 285 \u00b0C for 0.5\u22121 h under an applied force of 5 kN. Bonding between the layers was achieved, as the FEP films melted slightly, while the pores in the ePTFE layers were kept intact.28 Details of the procedure can be found in the literature.20 Figure 1 shows the schematic of the laminate, and only a single ePTFE layer is shown in Figure 1a and b for simplification. Figure 2a and b shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of an ePTFE surface with 3 \u03bcm pore size and of an FeFeF laminate cross-section, respectively.\nFor fabricating unipolar ferroelectrets, the open pores of the laminate must first be exposed to a corona charging and then be closed by use of an uncharged nonporous film. To this end, four ePTFE layers with 1 \u03bcm pore size and two FEP layers were put together by hot pressing under the same conditions as above. Smaller pores and a thicker four-layer porous foam were employed to reduce the charge loss after poling. The FEP film at the bottom acts as a barrier that separates the positive charges at the bottom electrode and the negative charges inside the pores. Two FEP films were added to avoid detrimental effects from defects after hot pressing. Another FEP film was put on top of the 4ePTFE-2FEP stack after charging, and the resulting laminate is abbreviated as F-4e2F in the following.\n2.2. Corona Charging Process. For bipolar charging, two sandwiches with the same final thickness were prepared from each type of FeFeF sandwich. One sandwich was poled in a normal corona charging setup at a corona-tip voltage of +20 kV for 5 min. The distance between the needle tip and the top surface of the sample was 5 cm. The sketch of the setup is shown in Figure 1a. Details of the\npoling process are given in the literature.20 The other FeFeF sandwich was poled with ion-enhanced corona poling. As depicted in step I of Figure 1b, dry clean air at a pressure of 20 psi (1.38 bar) was sent to an in-line ionizer (Ioncell from Simco-Ion) for ionization. The resulting ions of both polarities were injected from two sides into the layered sandwich, and two other ports were left open to let air flow out. The experimental process can be found in Figure S1. After the sandwich had been filled with ions of both polarities through the interconnected pores of ePTFE for around 5 min, it was moved quickly (within 1 min) to the corona charging rig for poling under +20 kV for 5 min. The accumulated ions could thus be separated and trapped in the ePTFE foam and at the interfaces between FEP and ePTFE, as depicted in step II of Figure 1b. Combined with the bipolar ions created during the dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) caused by the high poling field, the total ion density and, thus, the trapped charge both increase significantly. Accordingly, the piezoelectric performance is markedly enhanced in comparison to that achieved via traditional poling. Hollow and solid filled symbols represent the charges obtained from corona poling and ions filling in Figure 1, respectively.\nFor monopolar charging, two similar 4e2F sandwiches had been prepared. One was poled with \u221220 kV for 5 min. Then, an uncharged FEP film was put on top. The poling process of the other sandwich can be found in Figure S2. A negative ionic hair dryer (Conair) was operated from above for blowing negative ions into the open pores during the negative corona charging. It can be assumed that due to DBDs, created near the bottom electrode, positive charges are trapped into the bottom of the FEP film of the sandwich. Negative ions collected in the interlinked pores of ePTFE come both from direct injection by means of the ion blower and the negative corona charging. Finally, an uncharged FEP film was used for sealing.\n2.3. Fabrication of Ferroelectret Nanogenerators. Conducting PEDOT:PSS-coated fabrics made of 94% cotton and 6% Spandex were employed as electrodes in the nanogenerator. Details of the coating procedure are given in the literature.20 SEM images of the surface and cross-section of the fabric coated with conductive PEDOT:PSS can be seen in Figures S3 and S4. The FeFeF ferroelectret was cut into pieces of 16 \u00d7 16 mm2, and two PEDOT:PSS-coated conductive fabrics with an area of 13 \u00d7 13 mm2 were put on the top and the bottom as electrodes, each of which is extended in one direction for connecting to the external circuit. Kapton tape was used for protection and for insulation of the active nanogenerator area.\n2.4. Characterization and Measurements. The morphology of the ePTFE and the laminated films was visualized with a ThermoFisher Verios SEM. The piezoelectric coefficient was measured with a PM3500 d33 meter from KCF Technologies at a force amplitude of 0.25 N and a frequency of 110 Hz. The tested film was placed between two aluminum sheets in order to avoid contact problems between hard probes and soft ferroelectrets. The ferroelectret nanogenerators were compressed by a cyclic force with a peak of 40 N at 1 Hz, which was provided through a self-designed linear motor system. The short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage arising from the piezoelectric response were measured with a Keithley 6514 electrometer. A rough estimate of the ion density near the surface of the monocharged ferroelectret was obtained with a KT401 mini air ion tester from Kilter Electronic Institute, Co."

            "text": "3.1. Enhancing Piezoelectricity by Means of Corona Poling with Ion Boost. As shown in Figure 1b, an equal amount of positive and negative ions was injected into the porous layer from two outlets of the ionizer. These ions will survive for a while due to the intertwining of fibers in ePTFE and the relatively long recombination time. However, it would be unfavorable for ion injection if the open pores of ePTFE were too small. Sufficient porosity of the ePTFE layers is important for the injected ion density and the ion lifetime.\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces www.acsami.org Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12185 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2022, 14, 42705\u221242712\n42707\nTwo FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP\u2212ePTFE\u2212FEP (FeFeF) sandwiches with overall thicknesses of about 60 and 40 \u03bcm, respectively, were investigated, prepared under different hot-pressing conditions. Obviously, the porosity of the thicker FeFeF sandwich is higher. Both were poled by means of corona charging with additional ion blowing and by use of corona charging without extra ions. The resulting d33 coefficients can be seen in Figure 2c and d, for different aging times.\nFigure 2c shows that d33 of the thicker FeFeF film can be as high as 1600 pC/N just after poling by means of the corona charging with additional ions. This amounts to four times the response of a sample after standard corona poling (400 pC/ N). Since d33 was measured dynamically, which usually yields a lower value than a quasistatic measurement,29 a d33 value of 1600 pC/N is outstanding, when compared to the values of other ferroelectrets reported in the literature.2,30 Figure 2c further shows that the d33 value of the sample poled by blowing in ions first decreases with time and reaches a stable value of approximately 1200 pC/N two months after poling. Figure 2d presents the d33 results of the thinner (40 \u03bcm thick) FeFeF sample. The d33 of this sandwich poled with the ion-enhanced corona-charging process remains stable at 500 pC/N over time\ufffdi.e., up to five times the value of a sample that had been poled in a normal corona-charging setup. Therefore, filling with extra positive and negative ions before applying corona improves the piezoelectric coefficient by no less than a factor of 4\u22125 times for a FeFeF structure. The ePTFE foam ferroelectret with the higher porosity reaches a higher d33, while the one with the lower porosity shows better stability. This will be discussed in the following.\nReferring to the SEM images in Figure 2a and b, the blownin ions in step I should be kept in the voids between the intertwined fibers of the ePTFE layers. The thicker laminate with higher porosity has larger pores across its thickness, which allows the bipolar ions to be injected more easily so that more\nions will be trapped at the same air pressure. The transfer to the corona setup will cause some leakage of ions, especially for the thicker film. The transfer time should thus be as short as possible. Interestingly, after the prefill, the positive corona poling in step II creates two additional macro-dipoles, since its high poling field assures that negative and positive charges are trapped at the upper (FEP\u2212ePTFE) and lower (ePTFE\u2212FEP) interfaces between the FEP and ePTFE layers, respectively. The charges that are finally trapped stem from two sources: (1) from the prefill of positive and negative ions in step I and (2) from ions that originate from the dielectric-barrier discharges (DBDs) excited by the +20 kV corona.\nWhen only corona poling without additional ion injection is applied, the d33 value of the thicker sandwich is somewhat larger. In this case, the charges only arise from the second source. This means that the larger pore size of the thicker film is a bit more favorable for DBD inception. Since d33 of the sandwich poled by corona charging with ion boost increased no less than four times, it can be inferred that the charges from the first source, the ion prefill, contribute the most to the d33 value observed here. The exceptional piezoelectric coefficient of 1600 pC/N for the thicker FeFeF stack stems from the more efficient filling of ions in step I and the slightly more efficient DBD process in step II. It can be noticed from Figure 2c that the high charge level in the thicker sandwich is less stable. The injection pressure and the porosity of the ePTFE layers can undoubtedly be optimized to ensure a high amount of ion inflow and an increase in charges generated during the DBDs, along with a better charge stability. A higher porosity will moreover make the ePTFE foam more compliant. This will produce a higher d33.\n3.2. Performance Improvement of Ferroelectret Nanogenerators. After poling either with the novel ionenhanced bipolar corona-charging process or with the standard one, the two FeFeF laminates of 60 \u03bcm thickness were both\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12185 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2022, 14, 42705\u221242712\n42708\nassembled into an all-organic ferroelectret nanogenerator. Figure 3a and b shows the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage responses of the two differently poled sandwiches under a cyclic force of 40 N at a frequency of 1 Hz. Both the current and the voltage output improve very significantly when the FeFeF samples were poled by means of the corona-charging process with a prefill of positive and negative ions. The peak-to-peak short-circuit current (Ipp) increases to 0.5 \u03bcA and the peak-to-peak open-circuit voltage (Vpp) to 35 V, respectively. Assuming the nanogenerator drives a load with the same resistance as the ferroelectret sandwich, the peak output power can be calculated by multiplying 1/2 Ipp with 1/2 Vpp. The result is shown in Figure 3c. The output power of the ferroelectret nanogenerator poled via the new charging method turns out to be twice of that from a similar device poled in a conventional corona-charging setup, whereas the d33 coefficient increases by a factor of 4. The factors determining the degree of output-power improvement should be discussed in detail, as they are the cause of this discrepancy.\nFigure 3d schematically depicts the charge-spring dipolelayer arrangement proposed for the ePTFE-based ferroelectret nanogenerator with porous fabric electrodes at the top and at the bottom. Only a single PTFE layer is displayed for simplicity. As proposed earlier,20 the two air-filled conductive fabric layers form two additional charge-spring dipole layers due to their image charges induced by the electric field from the nearby FEP and ePTFE electret charges. Therefore, the final total piezoelectric response stems from three chargespring dipole layers connected in series and arranged in the same direction (the dipoles point upward). One of them derives from the charged ePTFE-layer sandwich. The other two dipole layers are formed by the macro-dipoles created by\nthe open-porous conducting fabrics. For the two nanogenerators made from similar ePTFE-based ferroelectrets but prepared with different charging methods, the contribution from the fabric electrodes to the overall output as shown in Figure 3c is the same. Hence, the final difference in the response of the nanogenerators will indeed be less than the difference in piezoelectricity of the two bare ePTFE-based ferroelectrets.\nAnother reason for the discrepancy in the performance enhancement may be the different testing conditions. Force and frequency (40 N, 1 Hz) applied to the nanogenerators differ from the values applied during the d33 measurement (0.25 N, 110 Hz). Ferroelectret sandwiches have specific resonances that are related to their elastic moduli and that can be used to determine their piezoelectric coefficients.31,32 The elastic modulus of the ePTFE-based ferroelectrets is low due to the soft nature of ePTFE, which might thus be more suitable for applications with a small cyclic force, such as biosensors. Force and higher frequency during d33 measurement could be more favorable for ePTFE-based ferroelectrets, so that the improvement of the poling with ion boost shows up more prominently in d33.\n3.3. Monocharging of Unipolar Ferroelectrets with Injection of Additional Ions. Figure 4 shows the sketch of the two monocharging processes for preparing unipolar ferroelectrets. Hollow and solid filled symbols represent the charges obtained from corona poling and ions filling, respectively. As shown in Figure 4b, negative ions were injected into the 4e2F laminate by means of an ionic hair dryer during corona charging. The ion density measured near the ePTFE surface was 17\u221219 \u00d7 106 ions/cm3, whereas the ion density of the laminate exposed solely to the negative corona\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12185 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2022, 14, 42705\u221242712\n42709\ncharging was only 8\u22129 \u00d7 106 ions/cm3. The ion densities are estimates because the results can be affected by changes in the testing distance and inaccuracies of the ion tester. However, the large difference in the ion densities nonetheless demonstrates the effect of the additional ions. Covering the ePTFE top surface with another uncharged FEP film right after the charging resulted in an F-4e2F sandwich. Figure 4c shows the d33 coefficients of the two different F-4e2F ferroelectrets measured after different aging times. The d33 value of the F4e2F ferroelectret that was corona-charged with simultaneous injection of external ions reaches 240 pC/N, i.e., about three times the corresponding value for a sample poled only by means of standard corona charging. The piezoelectric coefficients of the two sandwiches remain quite stable over time periods of up to four months. Since only negative charges are trapped in monoferroelectrets, internal charge neutralization is impossible. Thus, the higher stability of negative charges on PTFE and FEP is further enhanced\ufffda clear advantage of monocharging over bipolar charging.25\nThe effect of blowing in nonionized air was also investigated. Could this also lead to a higher ion density? In a comparative experiment, one ePTFE\u2212FEP laminate was poled unipolarly by means of the new method shown in Figure 4b, and another one was done just by use of a negative corona discharge with simultaneous injection of air from a small fan. After the top of the laminates was covered with a FEP film, the laminated stack charged with the ionic hair dryer exhibited a much higher d33 coefficient than the one obtained by means of air-flow-assisted corona charging via a simple fan. The comparison clearly demonstrates that the very significant increase of d33 that is visible in Figure 4c for the F-4e2F sandwiches charged with the novel method is mainly caused by the injection of additional negative ions. As illustrated in Figure 2, there are two concurrent sources of injected negative ions, one from the corona discharge, the other from the ionic hair dryer. The injected charges are trapped on the intertwined fibers of ePTFE by the high poling field of the negative corona.\nIn order to better understand the respective roles of the injected ions and of the corona charging itself, two additional experiments were carried out:\n(1) When the 4e2F laminate was just filled with the negative ions from the ionic hair dryer, the measured d33 coefficient was a mere 14 pC/N after putting an uncharged FEP film on top, i.e., a value that is well below the 240 pC/N in Figure 4c. This implies that it is the strong electric field of the electric charges deposited by the \u221220 kV corona that enforces the trapping of the ions collected inside the ePTFE matrix.\n(2) When the corona charging was only applied after prefilling the laminate with negative ions from the ionic blower, the d33 value of the F-4e2F sandwich was just around 120 pC/N. Apparently, the injected ions leak out quite easily from the open-porous ePTFE foam.\nTherefore, performing the negative corona charging simultaneously with the injection of negative ions is the most effective way for producing highly active unipolar ePTFEbased ferroelectrets.\nIt was reported earlier that the piezoelectric coefficient of unipolar ferroelectrets is lower than that of bipolar ferroelectrets.24 Along the same line, d33 of the F-4e2F poled by means of standard corona charging is not that high in Figure 4. However, the d33 coefficient of F-4e2F stacks can be\nimproved three times by blowing in extra negative ions from an external source. Such an ion-enhanced corona charging provides a significant boost to the monocharging process and paves the way for high piezoelectricity in ePTFE-based unipolar ferroelectrets. The piezoelectric properties of unipolar ferroelectrets may be further improved by an optimal design of the open-porous structure, by enhancing the ion density of the ionic hair dryer, or by applying a more sophisticated negative ionizer to further raise the injected ion density."

A significant charge-level and piezoelectriccoefficient enhancement is achieved by blowing in extra positive and negative ions before corona poling. The rise in performance has been demonstrated by preparing and assessing all-organic ferroelectret nanogenerators. Highly piezo-active unipolar ePTFE-based ferroelectrets were prepared successfully in a similar way by adding a negative-ion boost during corona charging.\n(1) After applying the enhanced corona poling with injection of additional positive and negative ions, the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of an ePTFE-based ferroelectret with a FeFeF stack sequence reached 1600 pC/N, which exceeds the d33 value of a similar stack poled by means of traditional corona poling by a factor of 4. The piezoelectric performance stays at a high level for at least three months. The structure with the lower porosity showed a better charge stability.\n(2) Two FeFeF ferroelectrets poled either with the new or with the standard corona-poling method were turned into ferroelectret nanogenerators equipped with conducting fabric electrodes. The peak output power was found to be doubled due to the application of the 2-step charging with a prefill of bipolar ions. The gain was not 4-fold because the air-filled conducting fabric electrodes contributed to the overall output in both nanogenerators as well.\n(3) By combining corona charging with a simultaneous inflow of additional negative ions for monocharging, d33 could be increased 3-fold. The ion-enhanced charging works well for fabricating highly charged unipolar ferroelectrets with good charge stability.\n\u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT *s\u0131 Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.2c12185.\nPhotograph of the experimental setup and microstructures of the conductive fabric (PDF)\n\u25a0 AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Authors\nJan van Turnhout \u2212 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Delft University of Technology, 2628CD Delft, The Netherlands; Email: j.vanturnhout@tudelft.nl Yang Cao \u2212 Electrical Insulation Research Center, Institute of Materials Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269, United States; orcid.org/0000-00017034-2792; Email: yang.cao@uconn.edu\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces www.acsami.org Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c12185 ACS Appl.
