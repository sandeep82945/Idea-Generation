    "abstractText": "To probe the motivational roles of hedonic gratification and social gratification in giving \u201cLike\u201d feedback on social media, we developed a set of novel pictures to simulate WeChat Moments. We subsequently examined how the personality trait of extraversion and stimulus content characteristics (e.g., emotional valence, personal relevance) influenced \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. A 2 (extraversion: extrovert group vs. introvert group) \u00d7 3 (emotional valence: positive vs. neutral vs. negative) \u00d7 2 (personal relevance: personally relevant vs. personally irrelevant)-mixed experimental design was applied to data obtained from 56 WeChat Moments users. These participants included 28 individuals with the highest extraversion scale scores (the extrovert group), and 28 individuals with the lowest extraversion scale scores (the introvert group), according to the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Briefly, participants observed pictures on an interface similar to that of WeChat Moments and were given the option to \u201cLike\u201d each picture. \u201cLike\u201d rates and response time were then compared across groups and conditions by applying a mixed-design analysis of variance. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated to explore relationships between the \u201cLike\u201d rates under each condition and the scores for each personality trait. Compared with the neutral pictures, the positive and negative pictures were \u201cLiked\u201d more and less frequently, respectively (F2,108 = 46.22, p < 0.001). Comparedwith the poster-unrelated pictures, the personally related pictures were \u201cLiked\u201d more frequently (F1,54 = 19.54, p < 0.001). In the extrovert group, the frequency of \u201cLikes\u201d given to unrelated negative content positively associated with neuroticism (r = 0.42, p = 0.025) and negatively associatedwith conscientiousness (r = \u22120.46, p = 0.014). No correlations were observed in the introvert group. Compared with not giving \u201cLike\u201d feedback, participants gave \u201cLikes\u201d to positive and negative pictures more quickly (p = 0.035) and slowly (p < 0.001), respectively.These results support the hypothesis that hedonic gratification and social gratification motivate \u201cLike\u201d feedback for positive content and personally related content, respectively. \u201cLiking\u201d behavior was not affected by extraversion, but was related to neuroticism and conscientiousness. Content-related differences in time intervals for giving \u201cLike\u201d feedback in this study suggest that people do not hesitate to give \u201cLike\u201d feedback to positive content on WeChat Moments, yet linger in deciding to give \u201cLike\u201d feedback to negative content.",

We subsequently examined how the personality trait of\nextraversion and stimulus content characteristics (e.g., emotional valence, personal\nrelevance) influenced \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. A 2 (extraversion: extrovert group vs. introvert\ngroup) \u00d7 3 (emotional valence: positive vs. neutral vs. negative) \u00d7 2 (personal relevance:\npersonally relevant vs. personally irrelevant)-mixed experimental design was applied\nto data obtained from 56 WeChat Moments users. These participants included 28\nindividuals with the highest extraversion scale scores (the extrovert group), and 28\nindividuals with the lowest extraversion scale scores (the introvert group), according to the\nNEO Five-Factor Inventory. Briefly, participants observed pictures on an interface similar\nto that of WeChat Moments and were given the option to \u201cLike\u201d each picture. \u201cLike\u201d\nrates and response time were then compared across groups and conditions by applying\na mixed-design analysis of variance. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated\nto explore relationships between the \u201cLike\u201d rates under each condition and the scores\nfor each personality trait. Compared with the neutral pictures, the positive and negative\npictures were \u201cLiked\u201d more and less frequently, respectively (F2,108 = 46.22, p < 0.001). Comparedwith the poster-unrelated pictures, the personally related pictures were \u201cLiked\u201d\nmore frequently (F1,54 = 19.54, p < 0.001). In the extrovert group, the frequency of \u201cLikes\u201d given to unrelated negative content positively associated with neuroticism\n(r = 0.42, p = 0.025) and negatively associatedwith conscientiousness (r = \u22120.46, p =\n0.014). No correlations were observed in the introvert group. Compared with not giving\n\u201cLike\u201d feedback, participants gave \u201cLikes\u201d to positive and negative pictures more quickly\n(p = 0.035) and slowly (p < 0.001), respectively.These results support the hypothesis\nthat hedonic gratification and social gratification motivate \u201cLike\u201d feedback for positive\ncontent and personally related content, respectively. \u201cLiking\u201d behavior was not affected\nby extraversion, but was related to neuroticism and conscientiousness. Content-related\ndifferences in time intervals for giving \u201cLike\u201d feedback in this study suggest that people\ndo not hesitate to give \u201cLike\u201d feedback to positive content on WeChat Moments, yet\nlinger in deciding to give \u201cLike\u201d feedback to negative content.\nKeywords: social media, WeChat Moments, giving \u201cLike\u201d feedback, emotional valence, personal relevance, personality traits"

            "text": "With the booming development of social media platforms such as WeChat Moments, QQ Zone, Microblog, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, the \u201cLike\u201d button has become one of the easiest and most rapid response options to enable users to communicate through a single click. Consequently, the \u201cLike\u201d option has become immensely popular (Sumner et al., 2018). \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media platforms is also an important indicator of how users give feedback, obtain feedback, and make social comparisons. For example, on WeChat Moments (a popular social media platform in China, hereafter referred to as \u201cMoments\u201d), users can \u201cLike\u201d content posted by their friends without any implicit, ambiguous, or double-entendre implications. Users can also review \u201cLike\u201d feedback from their friends after posting content, and \u201cLike\u201d feedback from mutual friends after their friends post content. The number of \u201cLikes\u201d received from friends are readily observable below each post. Thus, \u201cLiking\u201d is standardized, visual, and quantifiable feedback, respectively. Compared with face-to-face or peer-to-peer social contact, \u201cLiking\u201d represents a novel type of communication.\nTo investigate why people provide \u201cLike\u201d feedback on social media, a number of studies have been conducted. Motivations for \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media have been discussed within the theoretical framework of uses and gratifications (U&G) (Kim, 2014; Hayes et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Ozanne et al., 2017; Hossain et al., 2019; Shao and Kwon, 2019; Wang et al., 2019), which is a well-known and effective approach for understanding why and how people use media (Ruggiero, 2000). Previous studies have empirically validated the hypothesis that behavioral intentions of \u201cLiking\u201d are predicted by three aspects of gratification, hedonic, social, and utilitarian (Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Ozanne et al., 2017; Hossain et al., 2019). Hedonic gratification refers to enjoyment (Lee et al., 2016; Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Hossain et al., 2019; Shao and Kwon, 2019), entertainment (Kim, 2014; Ozanne et al., 2017), and passing time (Lee et al., 2016). Social gratification refers to social support (Hayes et al., 2016; Gan and Chunmei, 2017), interpersonal relationships (Lee et al., 2016), social interactions (Hossain et al., 2019), bonding (Ozanne et al., 2017), and socialization (Kim, 2014). Meanwhile, utilitarian gratification refers to seeking information (Kim, 2014; Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Ozanne et al., 2017; Hossain et al., 2019) and expression (Kim, 2014; Shao and Kwon, 2019). These factors have been proved as motivations which significantly predict \u201cLiking\u201d behavior either directly or indirectly based on intention, and this in turn decides \u201cLiking\u201d behavior (Shao and Kwon, 2019).\nIn addition to the U&G approach, scholars have considered other theories to account for factors that empirically influence \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), some studies have shown that relational facilitation, self-presentation, and metacommunication are key drivers of \u201cLiking\u201d activity on Facebook (Sumner et al., 2018; Dhir et al., 2019). By integrating guanxi theory and the affective response model, another study has indicated that guanxi cues (i.e., mianzi giving, renqing, and ganqing) positively and indirectly affect the intention of Chinese people to \u201cLike\u201d on\nthe Moments platform (Zhao and Zhang, 2020). Since relational facilitation, self-presentation, metacommunication, and guanxi have also been examined in interpersonal relationships (Sumner et al., 2018; Dhir et al., 2019; Zhao and Zhang, 2020), it is consistent for these factors to be considered for their social value in influencing \u201cLiking\u201d behavior in social media.\nIt has been demonstrated that hedonic gratification, social gratification, and utilitarian gratification can motivate \u201cLike\u201d intentions (Chin et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016; Dhir et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2019; Shao and Kwon, 2019; Wang et al., 2019). According to TPB, individual behavior is influenced by behavioral intention (Ajzen, 1991). Consequently, the stronger the \u201cLike\u201d intention of users, the greater the chance that \u201cLiking\u201d behavior will be exhibited. However, it is important to note that \u201cLike\u201d intention does not universally lead to actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior (Sun et al., 2016). In addition, given that an unobtrusive measure of actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior is not obtainable, self-reporting data (Lee et al., 2016; Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Hossain et al., 2019; Shao and Kwon, 2019; Li and Wang, 2021) or information from interviews (Hayes et al., 2016; Ozanne et al., 2017) have been used to obtain individuals\u2019 recollections of past behaviors. Yet, while \u201cLike\u201d intentions have been used to predict past \u201cLiking\u201d behavior, it remains for actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior to be investigated to reveal how gratifications drive actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media. Chin et al. (2015) conducted a field experiment to investigate the relationship between motivations and actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. They developed 32 different combinations of content posted on Facebook while controlling five variables: hedonic, utilitarian, affiliation, compliance, and conformity motivations. Each content posted on Facebook was displayed to participants, and the participants subsequently responded on survey forms. The resulted showed that the five motivations examined all had a positive impact on the participants\u2019 attitudes toward \u201cLiking,\u201d which in turn had a positive impact on their \u201cLike\u201d intention. Furthermore, it was observed that \u201cLike\u201d intention had a positive impact on actual \u201cLiking\u201d behaviors (Chin et al., 2015).\nThe design of the field experiment described above provides a useful reference for investigations of the relationships between motivations and actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. However, there are two aspects that need to be considered in future studies. One is that Chin et al. (2015) used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among five motivations, attitudes toward \u201cLiking,\u201d \u201cLike\u201d intentions, and \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. However, it remains unknown whether these motivations represent independent variables that drive users to give or not give \u201cLike\u201d feedback on social media. The second aspect to consider is that utilitarian gratification was confused with hedonic gratification in the study by Chin et al. (2015), since four types of positive and negative narratives were designated as hedonic and utilitarian. Utilitarian gratification includes expression and information seeking as motivations of \u201cLiking\u201d behavior, and these can vary greatly among individuals. Consequently, it is not feasible to control utilitarian gratification as a variable of content posted on social media. Therefore, in the design of the present study, only hedonic gratification and social gratification were examined,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 772547\nwith different types of simulated Moments content developed to address these two motivation variables.\nIt has been suggested that the motivations for using social media can vary according to individuals\u2019 personality traits (Papacharissi and Mendelson, 2011). However, to date, few studies have investigated the relationship between personality traits and \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media. Moreover, among the studies which have performed these investigations, their results are not consistent. For example, Kabadayi and Price (2014) observed that extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experiences indirectly influenced \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. In another study, affective attitudes toward Facebook \u201cLiking\u201d were positively predicted by extraversion and agreeableness, while openness to experiences was a negative predictor (Lee et al., 2016). In a more recent study, agreeableness and conscientiousness, yet not extraversion, had positive and negative effects on \u201cLiking\u201d behavior, respectively (Li andWang, 2021). In terms of social media use, extraversion has been associated with a greater number of Facebook friends (Tazghini and Siedlecki, 2013). Moreover, some studies have found that extraversion is the most significant personality trait predictor for use of social media (Wilson et al., 2010; Gosling et al., 2011). Extraversion describes a person\u2019s tendency to be sociable and his/her ability to experience positive emotions (Butt and Phillips, 2008). Thus, extraversion is related to both social gratification and hedonic gratification. In the present study, extraversion will be evaluated as a personality trait variable to examine whether extroverts or introverts exhibit greater \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media.\nPrevious studies have used questionnaires, interviews, and field experiments to investigate hedonic and social gratification as motivations of \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media. However, it remains unclear whether \u201cLiking\u201d behavior is related to extraversion as a personality trait. Moreover, to date, no experimental studies have strictly manipulated independent variables and controlled irrelevant variables to confirm the effects of extraversion, hedonic gratification, and social gratification on actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the responses of two groups of participants who received high (extrovert group) vs. low (introvert group) scores for the extraversion trait. Both groups were shown images of simulated Moments content that exhibited different emotional valences (positive vs. neutral vs. negative) and different personal relevance to the poster (personally relevant vs. personally irrelevant). The participants were given the option to \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cNo-like\u201d the pictures. Similar to the field experiment study conducted by Chin et al. (2015), emotional valences were designed to represent hedonic gratification in the present study. Regarding social gratification, Chin et al. (2015), affiliation motivation was designated according to whether or not the posted content was related to the originators\u2019 daily lives or mood changes. Furthermore, estimates of the affiliation motivation of the participants were based on scoring of items such as, \u201cthe content of this post allows me to be informed about poster\u2019s living/mood/recent status\u201d (Chin et al., 2015). Therefore, personal relevance to the poster was designed to represent social gratification in the present study. According to U&G theory and the results of previous studies, the following\nhypotheses were established for the present study. Hypothesis 1: Simulated positive images from Moments will receive more \u201cLikes\u201d than neutral and negative images. Hypothesis 2: Pictures accompanied by personally relevant captions will receive more \u201cLikes\u201d than pictures accompanied by personally irrelevant captions. Hypothesis 3: Participants in the extrovert group will \u201cLike\u201d simulated Moments images more often than participants in the introvert group."

The emotional valence of each emotional picture (positive vs. neutral vs. negative) and the personal relevance of each poster\u2019s captions (personally relevant vs. personally irrelevant) were independent variables that were manipulated.

Meanwhile, the \u201cLike\u201d rates of the extrovert and introvert groups did not differ. However, in the extrovert group, the \u201cLike\u201d rate for\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 772547\nthe negative-personally irrelevant Moments images was found to positively correlate with neuroticism scores, yet negatively correlated with the conscientiousness scores. Finally, it took participants less time to \u201cLike\u201d the positive Moments images than to decide to not give a \u201cLike.\u201d Conversely, the participants took less time to not click a \u201cLike\u201d for the negative Moments images than to click \u201cLike.\u201d In contrast, there was no difference in the time taken to \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cNo-like\u201d the neutral Moments images.\nHedonic gratification motivates individuals to experience positive affects (Meehl, 1975). Correspondingly, greater \u201cLike\u201d feedback was provided for the positive Moments images that were simulated in the present study. While positive emotional stimulation is generally related to hedonic gratification, there are differences. For example, hedonic gratification may be motivated in some individuals by neutral emotional stimulation of something they are interested in (such as a porcelain), or even by negative emotional stimulation (such as a horror film) (Martin, 2019). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to scan the brains of participants when they \u201cLike\u201d photos posted by others on social media. It has been observed that their orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, ventral tegmental area (VTA), striatum (including the pallidum), amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the brain are activated (Sherman et al., 2018). These regions have also been shown to be implicated in the hedonic network (Alexander et al., 2021). Thus, whether \u201cLiking\u201d positive emotional stimulation or negative emotional stimulation, positive hedonic gratification may be experienced. Nevertheless, it is impossible to choose the content to post on Moments according to the personal characteristics of one viewer, either for a specific experimental condition or for an actual poster on Moments. That is why positive emotional images were simulated for this study and were used to detect hedonic gratification of \u201cLiking\u201d behavior in our cohort.\nThe emotional state of individuals browsing Moments images may be complex and dynamic. If real-time fluctuations in the emotions of a viewer could be monitored, it is anticipated that powerful evidence of hedonic gratification for \u201cLiking\u201d would be obtained. Recently, dynamic Affective Representation Mapping was demonstrated as a technique for measuring realtime fluctuations in emotions as the decision-process unfolds (Heffner et al., 2021). With this tool, the subjective experience of emotion can be precisely and mathematically mapped alongside \u201cLiking\u201d decisions made on social media in future study.\nSocial gratification of \u201cLiking\u201d behavior is complicated (Kim, 2014; Hayes et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Gan and Chunmei, 2017; Ozanne et al., 2017; Hossain et al., 2019). In the present study, only the desire for interpersonal contact was considered. A multidimensional construct of affiliation motivation proposes that the desire for interpersonal contact is greater among individuals who especially value learning about others and exploring what others are like (Hill, 1987). As a result, the frequency of users sharing personal content has been found to have a direct effect on the frequency of \u201cLikes\u201d they receive from other users on social media (Bartsch et al., 2006; Marengo et al., 2021). In the present study, the participants provided \u201cLike\u201d feedback (as a type of interpersonal contact) for the simulated\nMoments images that were related to the posters. This result is consistent with a desire for interpersonal contact (namely, social gratification) to serve as a motivation of viewers\u2019 \u201cLiking\u201d behavior. Another study also observed that first-person narration alongside images (equivalent to personally relevant Moments images in the present study) gained more \u201cLikes\u201d because they boost a user\u2019s motivation to achieve social belonging (Chang et al., 2019). There are other social gratification factors to consider as well. For example, conformity motivation and subjective norms can affect viewers\u2019 attitudes to \u201cLike,\u201d \u201cLike\u201d intention, and actual \u201cLiking\u201d behavior (Chin et al., 2015; Dhir et al., 2019; Hossain et al., 2019; Shao and Kwon, 2019). However, these factors are not reflected in the contents of the simulated posts used in the present study. Therefore, it remains for them to be addressed in future experiments.\nExtraversion is related to both social gratification and hedonic gratification, since extraversion describes a person\u2019s tendency to be sociable and his/her ability to experience positive emotions (Butt and Phillips, 2008). Thus, it is not surprising that extraversion is related to \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on social media (Kabadayi and Price, 2014; Lee et al., 2016). However, similar to a previous study, we did not find a relationship between extraversion and \u201cLiking\u201d behavior (Li and Wang, 2021). A possible reason for this result is that both introverts and extroverts benefit from \u201cLiking\u201d behavior for different reasons. For example, introverts may build up their social relations with \u201cLiking\u201d behavior, while extroverts may provide \u201cLike\u201d feedback for social enhancement (Zywica and Danowski, 2008).\nTo simulate the actual response of users when they browse Moments, the participants in our study were not asked to respond as quickly as possible. Consequently, the time taken to make a \u201cLike\u201d/\u201cNo-like\u201d choice was analyzed. It was observed that \u201cLike\u201d feedback was provided at a faster rate than \u201cNo-like\u201d feedback for positive emotional content, and was slower for negative emotional content. Critical social cognitive processing that is responsible for this dissociation between \u201cLiking\u201d and \u201cNo-liking\u201d behavior may involve the theory of mind (ToM). ToM is responsible for the comprehension and representation of other\u2019s beliefs, intentions, emotions, and feelings, and for predicting the behavior of others (Premack and Woodruff, 1978; Frith and Frith, 2006; Wu et al., 2020). When providing feedback to others, a user may think about how this specific poster may react upon receiving this feedback (Meshi et al., 2015). A poster, the mutual friends of a poster, and a viewer can check \u201cLike\u201d feedback that is provided. Thus, the viewer who clicks \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cNo-like\u201d for a particular post may potentially infer the state of mind of the poster. For \u201cLiking\u201d positive contents, ToM may encompass an attractive force. However, ToM may encompass a repulsive force for \u201cLike\u201d feedback for negative content. It is possible that the task of \u201cLiking\u201d on Moments may represent an effective paradigm for detecting cognitive vs. affective ToM.\nAs mentioned above, the results of the present study provide further insight into possible reasons why viewers \u201cLike\u201d content on social media, with hedonic and social gratification identified as factors. The present results also suggest an effective paradigm to investigate cognitive vs. affective ToM. Regarding practical implications of the present study, a content strategy\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 772547\nto attract more \u201cLikes\u201d on social media is demonstrated for both individuals and commercial users. A recent study demonstrated that the frequency of \u201cLikes\u201d received by others positively related with perceived happiness (Marengo et al., 2021). Conversely, feelings of exclusion have been reported when \u201cLikes\u201d are not received from close relations or socially superior network members (Hayes et al., 2018). For brand marketers, consumers\u2019 \u201cLikes\u201d can not only enhance brand connections and customer engagements, but can also positively affect online brand endorsement (Hoffman and Fodor, 2010; Malhotra et al., 2013; Bernritter et al., 2016). Overall, it is clear that individuals and commercial users should effectively present on social media to increase \u201cLikes\u201d received.\nThe current study has certain limitations which should be addressed in future research. First, the effect of hedonic and social gratification on \u201cLiking\u201d behavior on actual social media could be further investigated. It has been reported that the affective state in the Ultimatum Game is higher for unfair offers, and is associated with the rejection of unfair offers. More importantly, this pattern has only been observed for offers proposed by human conspecifics, not for offers generated by computers (van\u2019t Wout et al., 2006). In the present study, we attempted to simulate the details of Moments content as realistically as possible. However, our participants are presented with a computer that they know no one is behind. Consequently, their \u201cLiking\u201d behavior may not be the same as that on actual Moments. A second consideration is that additional studies should be conducted to test other factors that may influence \u201cLiking\u201d behavior from the perspective of hedonic and social gratification. For example, the effect of the number of \u201cLikes\u201d that a post has received and the influence of the relationship between the viewer and poster on \u201cliking\u201d behavior could be examined. Finally, a self-report measure of motivation for \u201cLiking\u201d behavior was not included in the present study because we felt that selfreports are uniquely ill-suited to the current research questions. However, it must be acknowledged that there are individual differences in hedonic and social gratification which motivate \u201cLiking\u201d behavior."
