Investigating the Resistance Mechanisms of F. graminearum to GAPJ: Given that F. graminearum demonstrated resistance to GAPJ treatment, future research could focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of this resistance. Comparative genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses between resistant and susceptible strains could identify key genes and pathways involved in the resistance mechanism. This research could lead to targeted strategies to overcome resistance, such as modifying GAPJ parameters or combining GAPJ with other treatments to enhance efficacy.

Optimization of GAPJ Parameters for Enhanced Mycotoxin Degradation: The study found a reduction in DON levels and an unintended increase in D3G levels after GAPJ treatment. Future studies could explore the optimization of GAPJ parameters (e.g., discharge power, treatment duration, and reactive species concentration) to maximize the degradation of DON and other mycotoxins without leading to the formation of potentially harmful by-products. This could include the development of predictive models to optimize treatment conditions based on the specific mycotoxin and grain type.

Development of Combined Treatment Strategies: Given the complexity of fungal and mycotoxin decontamination, combining GAPJ with other decontamination methods (e.g., UV radiation, ozonation, or enzymatic treatments) could offer a more effective strategy for reducing fungal load and mycotoxin levels in grains. Research in this area could focus on identifying synergistic combinations of treatments that are effective against a broad range of fungi and mycotoxins while preserving grain quality.

Evaluation of GAPJ Treatment on Other Grains and Food Products: Extending the application of GAPJ treatment to other grains (such as wheat, corn, and rice) and food products (such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts) could provide insights into the versatility and effectiveness of this technology across different food matrices. Research could also investigate the impact of GAPJ treatment on the nutritional quality, sensory attributes, and shelf-life of treated products.

Assessment of the Environmental and Economic Impact of GAPJ Treatment in the Food Industry: An important area for future research is the evaluation of the environmental footprint and economic viability of integrating GAPJ technology into existing food processing and storage systems. This could involve life cycle assessments to evaluate the environmental impact and cost-benefit analyses to assess the economic feasibility of large-scale implementation. Additionally, research could explore the development of portable or scalable GAPJ systems to make this technology accessible to different sectors of the food industry, including small-scale producers.
