 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Extend the DiDCMM model to allow for degree heterogeneity in both row and column nodes. The current model only considers heterogeneity in row nodes. Allowing heterogeneity in both could better capture real-world network structure.

2. Develop efficient algorithms for fitting the DiDCMM model that do not rely on singular value decomposition. This could allow the model to scale to much larger networks. 

3. Evaluate the performance of the DiDCMM model and DiMSC algorithm on a wider range of real-world directed network datasets. This could provide more insight into when the model provides a good fit to real data.

4. Develop methods to automatically select the number of communities K when fitting the DiDCMM model. The current approach requires K to be pre-specified.

5. Incorporate node attributes and metadata into the DiDCMM model. This could allow connectivity patterns to be explained by exogenous factors like demographics.
