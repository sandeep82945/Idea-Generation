Comparative Pharmacological Studies: Conduct in-depth comparative studies of C. gileadensis extracts and essential oils against conventional drugs used for treating inflammation, arthritis, and microbial infections. This research would aim to evaluate the efficacy, safety profile, and potential for reduced side effects of the plant extracts and essential oils in comparison to synthetic medications.

Formulation and Development of Topical and Oral Pharmacological Products: Explore the formulation of topical creams, ointments, and oral medications based on the bioactive compounds identified in C. gileadensis. This could involve nanoencapsulation techniques for enhancing the bioavailability and stability of phytochemicals like caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), hesperidin, and chrysin.

Mechanism of Action Studies: Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacological activities of the key bioactive compounds found in C. gileadensis, such as Î²-myrcene, nonane, and CAPE. This could include studies on their interaction with cellular targets, signaling pathways involved in anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant responses, and their role in inhibiting protein denaturation and enzyme activities.

Toxicological and Safety Evaluation: Perform comprehensive toxicological studies to assess the safety and potential toxic effects of prolonged use of C. gileadensis extracts and its major constituents. This would include acute, sub-acute, and chronic toxicity studies in animal models, genotoxicity tests, and evaluation of potential drug-herb interactions.

Clinical Trials: Design and conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of C. gileadensis extracts in treating specific conditions such as arthritis, pain, inflammation, and bacterial infections. This would provide crucial data for the validation of its traditional uses and potential integration into mainstream healthcare as a natural therapeutic option.
