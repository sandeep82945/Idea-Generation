Enhanced Group Activity Recognition Models with Adaptive Learning: Develop advanced machine learning models that can adapt in real-time to the dynamics of group activities. These models could learn from the changing patterns of group interactions and improve their predictions over time, especially in environments where group activities are fluid and participants' roles or activities change frequently.

Cross-Modal Data Integration for Activity Recognition: Explore the integration of data from multiple sources and modalities, such as combining Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data with audio, video, and environmental sensors. This cross-modal integration could provide a more holistic understanding of group activities and individual roles within these activities, potentially improving the accuracy and richness of activity recognition.

Privacy-Preserving Techniques for Collaborative Activity Recognition: Investigate novel approaches to ensure privacy and security in collaborative activity recognition systems. This research could focus on developing decentralized, privacy-preserving algorithms that allow devices to share activity information without compromising individual privacy, possibly using techniques such as federated learning or differential privacy.

Real-world Deployment and Scalability of Collaborative Activity Recognition Systems: Conduct studies on the deployment of collaborative activity recognition systems in real-world settings, such as offices, schools, or public spaces. This research would assess the scalability, reliability, and user acceptance of these systems, identifying challenges and opportunities for their practical implementation.

Application of Collaborative Activity Recognition in Healthcare and Well-being: Explore the application of collaborative activity recognition in monitoring and supporting health and well-being, particularly in communal settings like assisted living facilities or during group therapy sessions. This research could focus on identifying how group dynamics and individual participation in activities contribute to overall health outcomes, with the goal of developing interventions that promote healthier behaviors within groups.
