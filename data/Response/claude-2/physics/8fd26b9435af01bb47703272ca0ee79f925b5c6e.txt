 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate binding of toxic divalent cations like Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ to cardiac troponin C and ventricular/atrial myosin regulatory light chains. These EF-hand proteins may be targets for toxic cation binding and disruption of function.

2. Examine how amino acid substitutions and post-translational modifications alter binding affinities of EF-hand proteins (e.g. troponin C, myosin regulatory light chain) for physiologically relevant and toxic divalent cations. This could identify mechanisms regulating cation binding.  

3. Study effects of physiologically relevant divalent cations at high concentrations (e.g. Ca2+ in malignant hyperthermia, Cu2+ in Wilson disease) on myosin ATPase activity and muscle contraction kinetics. This could reveal mechanisms of cation-induced muscle dysfunction.

4. Systematically evaluate effects of a wider range of divalent cations on kinetics of different myosin isoforms and other motor proteins. Relationships between cation properties (e.g. size, charge) and protein kinetics could be established.

5. Investigate possible synergistic effects of co-exposures to essential and toxic divalent cations on muscle proteins and cardiomyocyte function. This could better represent real-world exposures and reveal complex cation interactions.
