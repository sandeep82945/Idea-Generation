 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Further optimize the minimal active H2 relaxin analog B9-31 through additional amino acid substitutions and modifications to improve binding affinity and activity.

2. Explore alternative methods to induce helicity and stabilize the minimal H2 relaxin analogs, such as cyclization or incorporation of other helix-inducing amino acids.

3. Develop longer-acting analogs by modifying B9-31 with polyethylene glycol, albumin binding moieties, or other half-life extending strategies. 

4. Test the in vivo efficacy of optimized minimal analogs in animal models of fibrosis, heart failure, and other conditions to assess therapeutic potential.

5. Design biased analogs to selectively activate certain signaling pathways downstream of RXFP1 to optimize beneficial effects and reduce side effects.
