The difference between the neutron and proton separation energies, \u2206S, is around \u221220 MeV for the 14C+n system and +8 MeV for 14N+n. The population of the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 orbitals for both systems is reduced by a factor of approximately 0.5 compared to the independent single-particle model, or about 0.6 when compared to the shell model. This finding strongly contrasts with results deduced from intermediate-energy knockout reactions between similar nuclei on targets of 9Be and 12C. The simultaneous technique used removes many systematic uncertainties.\nIntroduction.\u2014Single-particle motion of nucleons in the nuclear mean field is quenched by correlations, the understanding of which has relevance to the study of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and beyond [1, 2]. For stable nuclei, the degree of quenching is around 0.6 and appears to be reasonably independent of the reaction mechanism that is used to probe it, the mass of the nucleus, the orbital-angular momentum of the nucleon probed, nucleon separation energy, and is the same within uncertainties for both protons and neutrons [3\u20136].\nStable nuclei have differences between their proton (Sp) and neutron (Sn) separation energies, \u2206S, of about \u00b110 MeV; for proton adding/removing reactions, \u2206S = S\u2217p \u2212 Sn and for neutrons S\u2217n \u2212 Sp (the asterisk denotes corrections for excited states where relevant). Information from intermediate-energy heavy-ion knockout reactions on 9Be and 12C targets using radioactive-ion beams (referred to as \u201cHI knockout\u201d here) has revealed a strong dependence between the degree of quenching (or reduction factor, R, defined as the ratio of the experimental and theoretical inclusive cross sections) and \u2206S, especially at extreme values of |\u2206S| > 10 MeV [5]. This trend, shown in Fig. 1(a), has been the topic of much discussion [6].\n\u2217 E-mail: kay@anl.gov \u2020 Present address: Department of Physics, Florida State Univer-\nsity, Tallahassee, Florida 32306, USA \u2021 Present address: Instituto Galego de F\u0301\u0131sica de Altas Enerx\u0301\u0131as,\nUniversity of Santiago de Compostela, E-15782 Santiago de Compostela, Spain \u00a7 Present address: Physics Division, Argonne National Labora-\ntory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, USA\nThere are limited data on nucleon-removal reactions from such exotic nuclei with di erent reaction probes, such as transfer and proton knockout, and they appear\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n02 10\n5v 1\n[n uc\nl-e x]\n5 J\nul 2\n02 2\n2 to disagree with the results of Ref. [5], for example, the blue points in Fig. 1(b) [7, 8].\nHere, we report on new data, also shown in Fig. 1(b), from a simultaneous determination of quenching factors for different momentum transfer in the nucleon-adding 14N(d,p)15N and 14C(d,p)15C transfer reactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier, spanning 28 MeV in \u2206S. The (d,p) reaction is well understood and the simultaneous measurement using these two isobars eliminates many uncertainties. Our result supports the hypothesis that the strong dependence of R on \u2206S seen in the HI-knockout data is unique to that probe.\nSome nucleon-removal reaction techniques, such as the (p,2p) reaction and nucleon-transfer reactions do not yield evidence for this trend in \u2206S, but the body of work is very scarce. The neutron-removing 34,36,46Ar(p,d)33,35,45Ar reactions [9, 10] (covering a range of \u221210 . \u2206S . +12 MeV, similar to stable nuclei) and 14O(d,3He/t)13N/13O reactions [7] (\u2206S approximately \u221218 MeV and +18 MeV, see Fig. 1(b)) give results that are not necessarily conclusive, but consistent with R being almost constant with \u2206S. More recently, two works using the (p,2p) knockout reaction on isotopes of oxygen spanning \u221220 . \u2206S . +23 MeV were published [8, 11], also consistent with R being fairly constant with \u2206S (see Fig. 1(b) for Ref. [8] results).\nFrom a theoretical perspective, no clear picture has yet emerged concerning the behavior of R as a function of \u2206S in HI knockout, with various efforts made to explore this via nuclear structure and reaction theory (see, for example, Refs. [6, 12\u201318]).\nTo provide additional insights, we took advantage of the weak binding of the s and d states in 15C, which results in a large, negative value of \u2206S. We measured the neutron-adding (d,p) reaction at beam energies where the reaction models used are well validated. In early HIknockout work, Terry et al. [19] showed that removal of the s1/2 neutron from\n15C, when impinging on a 9Be target, had a quenching factor of 0.96(4), in contrast to results for well-bound states near stability.\nIn order to reduce systematic uncertainties in both the experimental and reaction theory sides, we studied the same reaction simultaneously on two isobars, 14N(d,p)15N and 14C(d,p)15C, under identical conditions, giving an assessment of R at \u2206S of approximately \u221220 MeV and +8 MeV (when considering the energy of the excited states populated), and for both 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 strength.\nBoth reactions have been studied before in normal kinematics. Previous results for the 14C(d,p)15C reaction [20\u201324] are somewhat at odds with each other [25], with values of R ranging from \u22480.6 to 1.0 for both 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 transfer. Several of these measurements suffer from significant contamination present in the 14C targets and from difficulty in estimating their thickness. Previous measurements of the 14N(d,p)15N reaction [26, 27] are in better agreement with each other; those of Ref. [27] provide detailed information on the spin and parity using\ne.g. recoil trajectories\nRecoil detector (RD)\n(dE, E)e.g. proton trajectories\nPosition sensitive Si array (PSD)\nTarget (t)\nExtent of HELIOS volume\nIonization chamber (IC)\n\u0394|t-IC| ~1300 mm\nBeam\n\u0394|t-RD| 900 mm\u0394|t-PSD|\n125-475 mm\n(a)\npolarized beams. The goal of the current work is to provide an accurate comparisons of the degree of quenching between these two systems lying \u224828 MeV apart in \u2206S. Experiment.\u2014The measurement was carried out in inverse kinematics using the HELIOS spectrometer [28] at the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Laboratory. A cocktail beam of 14C and 14N was accelerated to 10 MeV/u at a total intensity (14C+14N) of approximately 300,000 particles per second. A 124(7)-\u00b5g/cm2 thick deuterated-polyethylene target was used (with an estimated hydrogen content was around 6%). The thickness was determined offline in five measurements across its surface of \u03b1-particle energy-loss characteristics, before and after the experiment; the uncertainty is represented by their rms spread. A schematic of the experimental setup, discussed below, is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe total beam rate was determined by a fast-counting ionization chamber [29] located \u22481300-mm downstream of the target, where the discriminator rate was used as a scaler to count the total incident ions. The beam composition was sampled at a rate of 15 times per second, triggered (dominantly) by an \u03b1 source which illuminated the position-sensitive silicon detector array, itself the trigger for the data acquisition. The two different beam species were clearly separated by energy and energy-loss determined measurements in two segments of the ionization chamber. The beam ratio, determined by this method was corroborated by Rutherford elastic scattering in the recoil detectors, placed 900 mm downstream from the target; a hole in the center allowed unreacted beam to\n3 0 100 200 300 400 500\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nC ou\nnt s/\n25 k\neV\nQ value (MeV)\n\u20134 \u20133 \u20132 \u20131 0 1 2 0\n20\n40\n60\n14C(d, p)15C and 14N(d,p)15N (a)\n(b)\n(c)\n0. 0,\n1 /2\n+\n0. 74\n0, 5\n/2 +\n7. 15\n5, 5\n/2 +\n7. 30\n1, 3\n/2 +\n7. 56\n7, 7\n/2 +\n8. 31\n3, 1\n/2 +\n8. 57\n1, 3\n/2 + 10 .0\n7, 3\n/2 +\n11 .2\n,\nFIG. 4.

The solid data points are for the 14 C(d,p)15 C reaction and empty symbols for 14 N(d,p)15 N. Panel (a) shows states populated via (in the case of 15 N, dominantly) \u2018 = 0 transfer (red) and (b) for \u2018 = 2 (blue). The colored solid (dashed) curves denote the dominant (subdominant) \u2018 -transfer where relevant.\n14C(p,d)13C reaction [31] show that about 3% of the 0d5=2 strength, and a negligible (< 1%) component of the 1s1=2 strength, is seen in neutron removal (probing occupancy), validating this assumption, and broadly agreeing with shell-model calculations. These results can be readily compared to the inclusive cross sections determined in HI-knockout reactions.\nTo extract spectroscopic factors from the experimental data, the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) is used, which has been well validated over many years [4, 32]. A similar model, using the adiabatic wave approximation (ADWA) provides a comparison, although at these incident beam energies results are similar.\nThe DWBA calculations were done using the niterange codePtolemy [33], and those for the ADWA calculations used the codeTwofnr [34]. In the DWBA case, the deuteron bound state was described by the Argonne 18 potential [35]. For ADWA, the JohnsonTandy adiabatic model was used [36]. The beam species bound-state form factors were generated using a WoodsSaxon potential, de ned by r 0 = 1 :25 fm, a = 0 :65 fm, Vso = 6 MeV, r so0 = 1 :1 fm, and aso = 0 :65 fm. The depth of the potential was varied to reproduce the binding energy of the transferred nucleon to the nal state.\nDi erent global optical-model parameterizations were\n4\nexplored in the incoming (d+14C/14N) and outgoing (p+15C/15N) channels. For deuterons, these included the parameterizations of Refs. [37\u201339]. Those of Ref. [38] were not explicitly derived from fits which included nuclei in this mass range, while those of Refs. [37, 39] were. For protons, the parameterizations of Refs. [40, 41] were used. Again, these are not explicitly derived from fits to nuclei in this mass range, but from systems close in mass. For the ADWA calculations, the proton/neutron potentials used are those derived from the nucleon-nucleus optical potentials [40]. Different combinations of parameter sets and modest variations in the bound-state radius parameter resulted in variations in spectroscopic factors of approximately 15-30%, which is commensurate with other parameter sensitivity studies [42]. These variations were most significant for the s wave in 15C and are reflected in the quoted uncertainties. The parameterizations used gave satisfactory fits to previously determined 14C(d,p)15C data at similar energies [21, 23, 24], further validating the choices made.\nThe spectroscopic factors were derived from fitting the experimental angular distributions, illustrated in Fig. 4. The deduced R values are given in Table I, derived by comparing the DWBA-derived spectroscopic factors with shell-model calculations carried out using oxbash [43] and the WBP interaction [44].\nFor 15C, R is determined to be 0.64(15) and 0.53(9) for the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 strength, respectively. The uncertainties are estimated by the rms spread in the different DWBA and ADWA fits. This contrasts the value of 0.96(4) for the s-wave strength deduced in the HIknockout study [19].\nFor 15N, the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 strength is carried by two sets of multiplets, which were previously studied [26, 27]. The majority of the strength (\u224895%) is shared among five states between 7.155 and 8.571 MeV in excitation energy, naively arising from the coupling of a 1s1/2 or 0d5/2 neutron to the 1+, T = 0 14N ground state. A lowerlying, positive-parity doublet (5.270 and 5.299 MeV) carries the remaining <5% of the strength, with small spectroscopic factors seen in previous transfer-reaction studies [27]. In this measurement, they were not observed due to the detector acceptance. The omission of these states from the summed strength contributes to the overall uncertainty to a similar extent as other sources. There\nis no other 1s1/2 or 0d5/2 strength below the neutronseparation threshold. As for 14C, the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 orbitals in 14N are approximately fully unoccupied, with no strength observed in neutron-removal reactions [45], corroborated by the shell-model calculations.\nThe 15N 0d5/2 strength is shared between two pure 0d5/2 states and one mixed state, as was well established in previous studies (e.g., Ref. [27]). The J\u03c0 = 3/2+ state at 8.571 MeV has strength that is approximately one-third 1s1/2 and two-thirds 0d5/2 in terms of S and, though weakly populated, represents about 10% of the total 0d5/2 strength. The remaining strength is carried by the J\u03c0 = 5/2+ and 7/2+ states at 7.155 and 7.567 MeV. Most of the 1s1/2 strength lies in the 7.301 MeV, J\u03c0 = 3/2+ state (which has small admixtures of 0d5/2 strength) and the 8.313-MeV, J \u03c0 = 1/2+ state (mixed with a small fraction of ` = 2, 0d3/2 strength as determined from a previous (d,p) study with polarized beams [27]). The remaining 1s1/2 strength is carried by the 8.571-MeV state mentioned above. The SF values for 15N (see Table I and in Fig. 1) represent the summed spectroscopic factors for the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 orbitals. We note that the states discussed here account for all the 1s1/2 and 0d5/2 strength below the neutron-separation energy threshold and, as for 15C, can be readily compared to the inclusive cross sections determined in HIknockout reactions. The larger uncertainties for 15N are a consequence of fitting the ` = 0 + 2 states.\nConclusions.\u2014In a measurement where many systematic errors are absent because of the ratio method, we show that for two different nuclei separated by \u224828 MeV in \u2206S, a similar degree of quenching of the single-particle strength is observed for both the s and d excitations. This contrasts with the factor-of-two difference observed in HI-knockout over the same range in \u2206S. This work provides the first assessment of neutron-adding (d,p)reaction data at extreme \u2206S, complementing a very limited number of data sets from nucleon-removing knockout and transfer reactions, adding to the growing evidence of a discrepancy between HI knockout and results using other probes.\nThere is an expectation that more data will become available as radioactive beams at energies above the Coulomb barrier become more widely available for transfer-reaction studies, for example, at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams. With many of these facilities likely to provide isobarically impure beams, the simultaneous beams technique discussed in this work could be a convenient and useful approach for future studies. Developing a body of transfer-reaction data, using both adding and removing reactions, comparable in magnitude to that of the HI-knockout data is likely essential to guide theoretical insights into this discrepancy.\nAcknowledgements.\u2014The authors recognize fruitful discussions with John Schiffer and would like to acknowledge Bob Scott and the ATLAS operations team for the delivery of the cocktail beam.
