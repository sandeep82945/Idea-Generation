    "abstractText": "As an important transmission component of industrial robots, the harmonic reducer determines the positioning accuracy, bearing capacity and service life of the robot end-effector. Predicting the performance can grasp the working status in advance and avoid major losses caused by uncertain factors such as component damage. The current paper focuses on a harmonic reducer performance prediction algorithm based on Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET) and LargeVis dimensionality reduction. Firstly, an accelerated life test platform is designed to collect multi-dimensional parameters that can characterize the operating state of the harmonic reducer throughout the life cycle. Afterwards, as far as the MSET method is concerned, the fault warning threshold is set according to the residual between the constructed memory matrix of the health state data and the actual observed value. Finally, utilizing LargeVis to reduce the dimensionality of multi-dimensional features, combining with Mahalanobis distance to construct a health index degradation model, and then selecting Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict the downward trend of the harmonic reducer. The analysis of the accelerated life test data of the harmonic reducer demonstrates that the proposed method can send out the fault warning signal 18 minutes in advance in the sample with a life of 5.7 hours, and has a strong ability to predict the degradation trend of the harmonic reducer.

INTRODUCTION Industrial robots are the most common type of robots, which are widely used in intelligent manufacturing. In the era of Industry 4.0, industrial robots also play an indispensable role in it [1]. Industrial robots can replace people to do many things, such as painting of cars and tightening of screws, which require high stability, low failure rate and low vibration of industrial robots [2]-[5].\nReducers are an important component of industrial robots [6], and their life and stability are directly related to the operating conditions of industrial robots. Precision reducers are utilized in all joints of industrial robots to improve the overall stiffness and output torque of the robot. There are\ntwo main types of precision reducers used in robots, RV reducers and harmonic reducers. RV reducers are large in size compared to harmonic reducers and are mainly used in large joints of industrial robots. Harmonic reducer is small in size, large transmission ratio, small mass and high transmission efficiency and transmission accuracy, which is widely used in wrist and small arm hand joints of industrial robots. The performance of harmonic reducer is directly related to the safety and stability of industrial robots.\nThe model diagram of harmonic reducer is shown in Figure 1. Harmonic reducer mainly consists of flexible wheel, rigid wheel and wave generator. As the use time increases, the harmonic reducer motion accuracy decreases\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

At present, the factory uses regular inspection and maintenance to troubleshoot the harmonic reducer. There is a certain lag in this troubleshooting method, and it is important to establish a harmonic reducer health assessment model to predict its performance [7].\nResearchers have conducted some theoretical and experimental studies on the performance evaluation of mechanical structures such as reducers. Zhang [8] investigated the reliability evaluation method of harmonic reducers using transient finite elements and accelerated life tests. Qian [9] proposed a multi-failure mode time-varying reliability analysis method based on a two-loop Kriging model to analyze the time-varying reliability of reducers. Liu [10] proposed a simple index indicating the failure severity based on the ratio between the characteristic frequency component of the failure and the currently sampled vibration signal. The fault characteristic frequency components are identified by applying wavelet packet decomposition and Hilbert transform to the original signal. Shiau [11] proposed a nonparametric regression-based accelerated life stress model for describing the accelerated degradation curve. An estimate of the mean time to failure under normal conditions of the product was obtained by analyzing the relationship between the stress level and the acceleration factor. Crk [12] proposed a multivariate multiple regression function parametric analysis method for applied stresses using a degradation trajectory-based approach. Doksum [13] proposed a variable stress accelerated life test model based on the concept of cumulative degradation with a Wiener process and inverse Gaussian distribution, which has more flexibility for nonparametric life models. Li [14] built a performance margin model based on the hysteresis and transmission error of harmonic reducer as key parameters, and analyzed and quantified the multi-source uncertainty to construct a reliability model. Jun [15] proposed a new n-ARIMA based equipment performance degradation model method, and used a non-smooth autoregressive integrated moving\naverage model to build an equipment performance degradation model to verify the performance degradation of OTM650. Riascos-Ochoa [16] proposed a Levy framework to simulate the effect of degradation sources on the degraded system, and obtained the moments of reliability function, probability density and lifetime. The performance of harmonic reducers is often expressed through multiple state parameters, such as vibration, transmitted torque, temperature, etc. These performance evaluation methods, designed using a single state parameter, do not reflect the performance of harmonic reducers.\nSome scholars have also developed performance evaluation models through neural networks. Ma [17] proposed a particle swarm optimization based reliability life prediction analysis for harmonic reducers. Wang [18] proposed a hybrid prediction method for remaining service life prediction of rolling bearings using a correlated vector machine regression with different kernel parameters to represent the bearing test dataset and adaptively estimate the remaining service life using an exponential degradation model combined with Frechet distance. Prudhom et al [19]. showed that a simple fault severity index using short-time fourier transform (STFT) information can be proposed based on the notation over definition of time-frequency transform instead of fault indicators. Wang [20] proposed a bearing performance evaluation method based on topological representation and hidden Markov model, where a topological network of original features is obtained by self-organizing mapping, and a hidden Markov model is used as the evaluation model to assess the bearing performance degradation trend. These performance evaluation models established using neural networks are able to predict the performance state of the mechanism, but a large amount of experimental data is required to establish convolutional neural networks and machine learning models, harmonic reducers have a long service life, and it takes more than ten years to collect hundreds of data sets to establish performance evaluation datasets, and the model training process is complex and prone to overfitting.\nIn brief, our significant technical contributions are the following:\n(1) A test platform for the accelerated life of harmonic reducer is built, and multiple sets of multi-dimensional data parameters such as input speed, output speed, input torque, output torque, temperature and acceleration in X, Y and Z directions are collected during the operation.\n(2) The designed MSET method can realize the comprehensive condition monitoring of the harmonic reducer, and the fault warning signal can be sent out 18 minutes in advance by setting the fault threshold.\n(3) The dimensionality reduction of the characteristic parameters is realized by the LargeVis technology, and the performance degradation trend information of the harmonic reducer is predicted by combining with the LSTM method.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "In this paper, a test platform is set up to conduct accelerated life experiments and collect multidimensional parameters that can characterize the operation state of the harmonic reducer during its full life cycle. The test platform consists mainly of drive frequency conversion motor, harmonic reducer, torque sensor, magnetic powder brake, accelerometer, as shown in Figure 2. Among them, the performance parameters of the drive motor are shown in Table 1, with a rated power of 1.1kW and a rated torque of\n3.5 N\u00b7m. It is connected with the harmonic reducer through a coupling to drive the harmonic reducer. The performance parameters of the measured harmonic reducer are shown in Table 2. The torque sensor selects a range of 5 N\u00b7m and 200 N\u00b7m respectively to measure the torque of the input and output terminals. The TR-3 acquisition instrument matching the sensor is selected, and the RS232 interface is adopted to communicate with the computer. The model of the magnetic powder brake is FZ200J/Y, which can provide a rated torque of 200 N\u00b7m, all of which meet the test requirements.\nFIGURE 2.

The operating time ranges from several hours to dozens of hours, with strong uncertainty. If the traditional method based on physical model is used, there will be a large error. The MSET method based on data drive proposed in this paper is used for condition monitoring and fault warning to inform the appropriate time for preventive maintenance of equipment.\nIn addition, the lifespans of samples No. 6 and No. 9 are 3.1 hours and 1.1 hours, respectively, which is relatively short. Combine with the analysis of the test site and consultation with the manufacturer of the harmonic reducer, the two groups of samples are found to be short in running time due to manufacturing defects. Therefore, there is no reference value. At the beginning of the test process, the harmonic reducer is in an accelerating state, and the data after the harmonic reducer runs smoothly is intercepted for analysis. In addition, sensor errors during the test may cause a large difference between individual data and the overall sample, which should be discarded in the subsequent model calculation.\nWhen the harmonic reducer is running, the temperature in the body rises due to friction heating. Especially in the later period of use, the vibration intensifies and the input and output torque cannot be maintained. Therefore, input speed, output speed, input torque, output torque, temperature and acceleration in X, Y, and Z directions are collected in the test to analyze the performance of the harmonic reducer."

For industrial robot equipment, there is a certain risk in its fault test, and it is difficult to obtain the fault feature database. Hence, the MSET technology is utilized to estimate the true state of the observation vector by learning the mechanical knowledge contained in the historical monitoring data, and then a fault warning model is established.\nFirstly, the historical memory matrix D is constructed by utilizing the monitoring data under in normal operation state, and then the MSET model is established. Assuming that n variables are collected by the sensor , the observation vector at a certain sampling time tm can be expressed as:\n T1 2 3( ) ( ) , ( ) , ( ) , , ( )m m m m n mt x t x t x t x t X (1)\nWhere xn(tm) is the observed value of variable xn at sampling time tm.

Its columns represent the values of all observed variables at a certain sampling moment, and its rows represent the values of an observed variable at different sampling moments.\nFor a new observation vector Xobs, it can be compared with the historical observation vector stored in the memory matrix D, and then the prediction vector Xest can be estimated. Xest can be expressed as the product of D and the weight vector w :\n1 1 2 2( ) ( ) ( )est m mt t t   X D w w X +w X + +w X (3)\nWhere Xest is the linear combination of the m historical observation vectors in D. The weight w represents the similarity measure between the vectors in Xest and D, and the weight w can be calculated by minimizing the residuals. The residual formula is as follows:\n-obs est  X X (4)\nThe optimal weight vector w is selected to minimize the residual sum of squares between the newly measured vector Xobs and the predicted value Xest. Then the residual sum of squares can be given by:\n2 T T 1\nT\n2\n1\n( ) ( ) ( )\n=( ) ( )\n= ( ( ) )\nn i obs est obs esti\nobs obs\nn m obs j iji j i\nS\ni\n   \n \n    \n \n\n\n \n\n\nw X X X X\nX Dw X Dw\nX w D\n(5)\nTake the partial derivatives of S(w) with respect to w1, w2,\u2026, wm and make them equal to 0.

Once a failure occurs, Xobs deviates from the observation vector in the memory matrix, the accuracy of the output value decreases, and the residual will increase accordingly. Hence, the residual between Xest and Xobs can reflect the abnormal state and fault information. By means of monitoring changes in residuals and setting reasonable thresholds, fault alarm can be achieved."

The feature selection of the Pearson correlation coefficient method is employed to screen the rows of the memory matrix. Because it has a simple process, high computational efficiency, and it is suitable for large-scale data. The degree of linear correlation between two variables is calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the value range is generally [-1, 1]. The larger the absolute value, the higher the degree of linear correlation. Then the overall Pearson correlation coefficient formula between the two variables is as follows:\n, [( , )]cov( , ) x y x y\nx y x y\nE x yx y           (8)\nThe formula for calculating the correlation coefficient between two samples can be expressed as:\n1 ,\n2 2\n1 1\n( )( )\n( ) ( )\nn\ni i i\nx y n n\ni i i i\nx x y y r\nx x y y\n\n \n  \n \n\n \n(9)\nDue to the long sampling time and the huge amount of data, the memory matrix will be redundant, thereby reducing the computational efficiency.

However, considering the changes of actual machining parameters and operating conditions, the estimation accuracy of the MSET with a fixed memory matrix will gradually decrease and frequent maintenance is required. Accordingly, it is necessary to improve the flexibility of the fixed memory matrix. In this paper, a dynamic memory matrix construction method based on KNN algorithm is adopted to construct the columns of the matrix, realize online calculation of MSET, and observe the distance between the vector and each sample in the training set in real time. Taking variable xi as an example, the method flow of adding observation vectors to the memory matrix is shown in Figure 4. Here, \u03b4 is a small positive number.\n3) Sliding window method Within the context of the current paper, the sliding window method is adopted to eliminate the uncertain factors and random interference of the harmonic reducer in operation, thereby improving the reliability of fault warning. By finding an appropriate sliding window width, the statistical characteristics of continuously changing residuals can be quickly captured.\nAssuming that in a certain period of time, the sequence number of residuals estimated by the MSET method can be given by:\n 1 2( , ) , , ,obs est N    X X (10) Setting the width of the sliding window to N, then the moving average of N consecutive residual values within the window can be calculated as:\n1\n1 N i\niN      (11) The threshold of fault warning \u025bt is determined by the maximum average residual value in the sliding window. Under the condition of normal operation of the equipment, the maximum residual average value between the normal observation vector and the estimated vector of the MSET model is \u025bN. The fault warning threshold can be designed as:\nT Nk  (12)\nWhere k is the alarm threshold coefficient, which is determined by the operator according to actual experience, and the value is generally greater than 1. When the residual value is greater than the residual threshold \u025bT, the system sends out an alarm signal."

The first alarm is issued at the 3890th sampling point, that is, about 18 minutes before the fault occurs, and the residual value at the subsequent sampling points increases sharply. The MSET algorithm can be used to evaluate the residuals between prediction vector and observation vector, and an alarm can be issued in time, thereby winning precious time for troubleshooting. In the meanwhile, the proposed MSET method can uniformly describe the states of multiple variables without modeling each variable separately, which can quickly realize the fault warning and has higher application value."

Since the data of the harmonic reducer is relatively stable in the first 10 minutes of operation, it is regarded as healthy data. The Mahalanobis distance is based on the data of the first 10 minutes, and the dimensionality reduction features in the health state are taken as the baseline data to calculate the distance between the sample data to be tested and the baseline data. Afterwards, the Mahalanobis distance is nonlinearly mapped, and the health index of each sample point is calculated according to the health index expression. Then\nthe change graph of the health values is shown in Figure 12. For the sake of a simple notation, (a) represents the 8th group of experiment, (b) displays the 14th group of experiment, the following experiments are consistent with the characterization method of this experiment, and will not be repeated one by one. Here, the value of k0 is 1. It can be clearly seen from the figure that the overall trend of the health value is on a downward trend, and the results of the health assessment are consistent with the actual situation. It is directly proved that the combination of the LargeVis dimensionality reduction and the Mahalanobis distance method can better evaluate the performance degradation state of the harmonic reducer.\nLSTM is employed to predict the performance state of the harmonic reducer. Figure 13 demonstrates the comparison between the actual and the predicted degradation curves of the two groups of experiments. Where blue indicates the actual degradation curve, and red represents the predicted degradation curve. It is found that with regard to the performance degradation, the predicted results are similar to the actual value, and infinitely close to the actual value.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.
