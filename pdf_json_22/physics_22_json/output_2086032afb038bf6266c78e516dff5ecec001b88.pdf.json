We show that the notion of genuine tripartite nonlocality allows us to certify control power in such a scenario. By considering a specific adversarial attack strategy on a device characterized by depolarizing noise, we find that control power is a monotonically increasing function of genuine tripartite nonlocality. These results are relevant for building practical quantum communication networks and also shed light on the role of nonlocality in multipartite quantum information processing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nControlled Quantum Teleportation (CQT) is a paradigmatic multipartite quantum communication protocol where a third party (or parties) determines the success or failure of quantum teleportation [1]. In the standard quantum teleportation protocol [2], an arbitrary qubit is teleported from Alice to Bob using maximally entangled EPR states. This idea has found applications in several quantum information schemes such as quantum gate teleportation [3], cluster state quantum computing [4] and quantum repeaters [5]. Controlled quantum teleportation is an important multipartite extension of bipartitie quantum teleportation [1]. CQT is an integral part of the design of Quantum Teleportation Networks (QTN) that could form the backbone of the future quantum internet [6]. In the simplest CQT scheme, the success or failure of teleportation of a qubit from the sender to the receiver can be decided by a third party, also known as the controller, Charlie [1]. This scheme works under the assumption that all parties are trusted, i.e., their devices and measurements are working exactly according to the specifications provided by the supplier. However, this is often not the case in real applications. There may be physical imperfections in the devices and measurement directions, which can not only lead to a lower teleportation fidelity but also can be used by an adversary to control the success or failure of teleportation. In scenarios where the precise knowledge of the underlying quantum state and measurement settings is not available, the framework of device-independent (DI) quantum information processing can be useful [7]. Traditionally, the notion of Bell nonlocality has been used for DI quantum information applications [8]. Bell\n\u2217 sgangopa@uwaterloo.ca \u2020 sghose@wlu.ca\nnonlocality refers to the phenomenon in which correlations obtained by performing local measurements on distant entangled states cannot be explained by any local hidden variable (LHV) model [9]. Bell nonlocality is often quantified by the violation of Bell inequalities. In applications such as DI Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) [10], the violation of a Bell inequality strictly bounds the information leaked to an eavesdropper. Other notable applications of DI analysis include randomness amplification [11] and obtaining computational advantages [12]. What makes the DI formulation so powerful is the minimalism in assumptions regarding the functioning of the devices involved; it relies only on the observed measurement outcome correlations.\nRecently, a stronger form of Bell\u2019s inequality has been used in the DI study of a multipartite quantum communication protocol called secret sharing [13]. A secret bit is split among n \u2212 1 parties in such a way that at least m \u2264 n \u2212 1 parties must collaborate to reveal it. Moreover, upto n\u2212 2 parties can be untrusted. It was shown that the maximal violation of Svetlichny\u2019s inequality [14] guarantees that no information is leaked to an untrusted receiver. For non-maximal violation, it was observed that the larger the Svetlichny inequality violation, the smaller is the information leaked to the untrusted parties. In [13], the secret message was a classical bit whereas a quantum secret sharing protocol can also share qubits. In the tripartite case, a quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocol becomes equivalent to a CQT protocol where Alice\u2019s secret qubit can be recovered by Bob iff Charlie assists [15]. This naturally leads one to ask what is the role and nature of nonlocality in the device independent (DI) analysis of QSS where the secret is quantum. A first step towards that goal would be to study DI tripartite QSS or equivalently, DI CQT. While DI quantum teleportation of a qubit was published close to a decade ago [16], a DI study of CQT is still an open question.\nIn this work, we consider a CQT scenario where the receiver is untrusted. The receiver can collude with an external eavesdropper to increase the fidelity of telepor-\n2 tation beyond the classical limit even when the controller has not allowed it. Despite the allowed collusion and depending on the nature of the device used, it might still be impossible for Bob to achieve a teleportation fidelity as high as that with Charlie\u2019s participation. Therefore, an untrusted receiver may lead to a decrease in control power but not entirely nullify it. We quantify the effective control power in this scenario and show that the maximal violation of the Svetlichny inequality guarantees maximum control power. We also show that the effective control power is non-zero for a significant range of the Svetlichny inequality violation where it is monotonically increasing. Finally, we emphasize the necessity of genuine tripartite nonlocality in the DI certification of the CQT scheme. We discuss the relevance and importance of these results in Section V."

(8)\nThe average fidelity of teleportation between the unknown pure state (\u03c1a) and Bob\u2019s final state (\u03c1B) is calculated as\nF =\n\u222b\nd~a 4\u03c0 \u3008a| \u03c1B |a\u3009 . (9)\nwhere the averaging has been performed over all pure qubit states. Henceforth, we will refer to the average fidelity of teleportation performed with Charlie\u2019s participation as FC and that without Charlie\u2019s participation as FNC . From Eq. (8) and Eq. (9),\nFC =\n\u222b\nd~a 4\u03c0 \u3008a| I2 + ~a.~\u03c3 2 |a\u3009 = 1. (10)\nSuppose Charlie does not reveal \u03b3. Bob will randomly perform either R\u22121c0c1,+1 or R \u22121 c0c1,\u22121.

(11)\nThe control power of Charlie is defined to be the difference between FC and FNC [17]. Without the controller\u2019s participation, the average teleportation fidelity should be minimized and with the controller\u2019s participation it should be maximized. Thus, the higher the difference between the above fidelities, the higher is the control. The control power of Charlie is therefore expressed as follows:\nCP = FC \u2212 FNC = 1\u2212 2\n3 =\n1 3 .

            "text": "In the usual two-party teleportation protocol using EPR states, Bancal et al. [18] suggested a construction by which it is possible to device-independently certify whether a teleportation device is using quantum resources. Alice and Bob are given a pair of black boxes that supposedly perform the quantum teleportation of a qubit. The input of each box is a unit vector of the Bloch sphere. Alice\u2019s box takes the state to be teleported as the input given by the vector ~a and outputs two bits (c0c1) \u2208 {0, 1}2. In the back box scenario of teleportation, it is assumed that Alice knows the state to be teleported. Bob\u2019s box takes a vector ~b as input and gives one bit output \u03b2 \u2208 {+1,\u22121}. ~b represents a measurement of the teleported state in the ~b.~\u03c3 direction. The vendor claims that their boxes contain EPR states, using which the teleportation is performed on each run. Alice and Bob wish to verify the vendor\u2019s claim. In [18], it was shown that it is indeed possible to certify teleportation in this black box scenario. In other words, it is possible to infer a posteriori that the black boxes used quantum resources to perform the teleportation from the input/output statistics of the boxes. In a teleportation protocol, Alice is typically required to send (c0, c1) to Bob such that he can perform the appropriate corrective rotation based on some preestablished agreement to prepare the unknown qubit. However, it was shown [19] that 2 classical bits of information are enough to simulate the statistical correlations of the maximally entangled singlet state. Hence, a black box certification of quantum resources is not possible if Alice communicates with Bob. Therefore, Alice and Bob do not reveal any of their measurement input/output until several (ideally infinite) rounds have been completed. Each round consists of the pair of boxes taking inputs (~a,~b) and giving outputs (c0c1, \u03b2). In the end, they can construct the probability distributions P (c0c1, \u03b2|~a,~b). Alice and Bob have no knowledge\nof the inner working of the composite black boxes except that they are not communicating. It is also assumed that Alice and Bob have free will. At the end of the protocol, the only information they have is the data table of inputs and outputs (c0c1, \u03b2|~a,~b) for each round. Using this, they must test whether the source of correlations is quantum. This scenario can be easily mapped into a Bell scenario. Let Alice choose from state settings { ~a1, ~a2} and Bob choose from measurement setting {~b1, ~b2}. Alice\u2019s black box gives two bits (c0, c1) as the output, which must be mapped to one bit. This can be done by choosing \u03b1 = 2cj \u2212 1 if Alice\u2019s input is aj . Thus, one can construct the distributions P (\u03b1, \u03b2|j, k) from P (c0c1, \u03b2|~a,~b). Finally, the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell function can be calculated as\nCHSH = \u2211\nj,k\u2208{0,1} P (\u03b1 = \u03b2|j, k)\u2212 P (\u03b1 6= \u03b2|j, k). (13)\nIf CHSH > 2, it is guaranteed that the pair of black boxes generate statistical correlations that are not possible to obtain using only classical resources [9]. In other words, if CHSH > 2, it is certified that quantum resources are being used for teleportation."

In this section, we address the question of how to device independently certify control power in such a scenario. The goal of a CQT protocol is to ensure that Charlie can control whether quantum resources are being used for teleportation.

The causal structure of inputs, outcomes and common source of correlations of the different parties involved can be represented in the following way using directed acyclic graphs (DAG):\nIn Fig. 1, each directed edge represents a causal relation between two nodes. The start of each edge is called the parent node and the arrival of each edge is called the child node. In a classical causal model, the source of correlations and all other nodes are random variables such that the parent nodes completely characterize a child node.\nThe explanation of how to interpret the DAG in Fig. 1, is as follows:\n\u2022 The node \u039b represents the common source of correlations (the underlying state in the black boxes) supplied by the eavesdropper Derek.\n\u2022 J, K, L denote the inputs (measurement choices) of Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively.

Hence, Bob does not have measurement independence. The arrow from \u039b to K represents the fact that Bob\u2019s choice of measurement setting depends on the information he receives from Derek through the black box.\n\u2022 Extra arrows from inputs/outcomes from one party to another were avoided due to the requirement that all announcements be made simultaneously at the end of several rounds.\nIf {vi}ni=1 denote the nodes of the graph, p(vk|v1, v2, ..., vn) = p(vk|pa(vk)) where pa(vk) denotes all parent nodes of vk.

Because of the normalization of pA(a | j), to achieve the maximum quantum violation S = 4 \u221a 2 necessarily, we must have CHSH(\u22121)0 = CHSH \u2032 (\u22121)1 = \u22122 \u221a 2 and CHSH(+1)0 = CHSH \u2032 (+1)1 = 2 \u221a 2. For any given \u03b1 and j, Charlie and Bob\u2019s joint state must maximally violate the CHSH. Only maximally entangled two-qubit pure states can generate such a correlation. Thus, by the monogamy of entanglement, \u03c1BCD = \u03c1BC\u2297\u03c1D where \u03c1BC is a maximally entangled pure state of Bob and Charlie. This means that if S = 4 \u221a 2, then Derek cannot remain entangled to Bob and Charlie\u2019s devices. Now suppose the same device which yielded S = 4 \u221a 2 during the device independent test, is used for the standard controlled quantum teleportation scheme (Section IIA). If Charlie does not give permission to teleport i.e., does not reveal \u03b3l then p(\u03b4 = \u03b3l) = 14 . This reflects the fact that Derek\u2019s state is separate from Bob and Charlie\u2019s composite state and therefore cannot obtain information about their systems by performing local operations on his system. Essentially, it means that Bob has no extra information about what the corrective rotations R\u22121s0s1\u03b3l are beyond what the trusted parties Alice and Charlie choose to reveal. Alternatively, we note that only the maximally entangled GHZ state |000\u3009+|111\u30092 (upto local unitary operations) violates the Svetlichny inequality maximally, i.e., gives S = 4 \u221a 2.

This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice, Bob, Charlie and Derek are restricted to performing quantum operations on their respective systems - no joint quantum operations allowed between any two parties. Charlie\u2019s authority will be quantified by the Effective Control Power (ECP) which we define as\nECP = FNEC \u2212 FENC . (17)\nHere FNEC indicates the average fidelity of teleportation with Charlie\u2019s permission and no eavesdropping. FENC indicates the average fidelity of teleportation without Charlie\u2019s permission but with eavesdropping (i.e., Derek\u2019s participation). The general definition of controller\u2019s authority would be\nCP = FEC \u2212 FENC . (18)\nThe superscripts (E) indicate that eavesdropping has been considered in both cases of control (with and without Charlie\u2019s permission). We shall leave the more general quantification of controller\u2019s authority as future work and focus on Effective Control Power (ECP ) of Charlie in this section. Note that FEC \u2265 FNEC because eavesdropping will always increase fidelity. Therefore, ECP is a lower bound to the more general definition of controller\u2019s authority quantified by [Eq. (18)]. It is guaranteed that for the adversarial strategy under consideration, Charlie has at least ECP amount of control."

Alice and Bob\u2019s composite state is projected into one of the EPR states after Charlie performs a measurement and reveals the measurement setting and outcome to Bob. When Charlie does not make his measurement information known to Bob, i.e., does not give permission to teleport, Bob does not know which EPR state the teleportation channel has\n8 been projected into. This prevents Bob from achieving an average teleportation fidelity higher than 2/3. Recall, that the goal of the adversary (Section III B) is to maximize the average teleportation fidelity when Charlie has not allowed the teleportation. Bob\u2019s next best option is to ask Derek to perform a measurement in a suitable basis and reveal its outcome (\u03b4) to Bob such that Alice and Bob\u2019s composite state is projected close to one of the four EPR states. This gives Bob some relevant information regarding the corrective rotations, using which he can recover the state to be teleported with higher fidelity (see point 4 of Adversarial Capabilities, Section III B 2). Our goal is to find the maximum fidelity of teleportation that Bob can achieve without permission from Charlie using this extra information (\u03b4). This will allow us to evaluate the worst case Effective Control Power (ECP) of Charlie. The adversarial strategy can thus be formulated as the following problem:\nAdversarial Strategy.

            "text": "Svetlichny Inequality Violation\nA useful approach to analyze the adversarial strategy and Derek\u2019s role is to describe the problem using the framework of decoherence and noise models in open systems. The ideal CQT scheme assumes that the tripartite state shared by Alice, Bob and Charlie is a pure GHZ state (|\u03c8\u3009 = (|000\u3009+ |111\u3009)/ \u221a 2). More generally, in a realistic scenario, the pure GHZ state would undergo decoherence due to entanglement with the environment. This environment could be the adversary Derek, and hence the decoherence model can be used to analyze Derek\u2019s effect on CQT as follows. The state \u03c1f after a decoherence process \u03b5 is given by \u03c1f = \u03b5\u03c1i. The action of \u03b5 can be described using Kraus operators {Ej}j in the following way [25],[26]:\n\u03b5\u03c1i =\nM \u2211\nj=1\nEj\u03c1iE \u2020 j . (23)\nFirst, we will consider the case where the whole state is affected by the same decoherence process described by the total depolarizing channel. It is a process in which the ideal GHZ state is mixed with white noise with probability p. Thus,\n\u03c1totalf = p I\n8 + (1\u2212 p) |\u03c8\u3009 \u3008\u03c8| . (24)\nNext, we will consider the decoherence process in which each qubit of the tripartite GHZ state undergoes a depolarizing channel. Note that the qubit depolarizing process is physically more appropriate than the total depolarizing process because the three qubits are distributed to three different parties who are usually at different locations. Each qubit is coupled to its local environment and undergoes depolarizing independently though they were initially entangled at a single location. The qubit depolarizing channel is described by the Kraus operators E0 = \u221a 1\u2212 p\u2032I; Ei = \u221a p\u2032 3 \u03c3i where p \u2032 = 3p2 [26].

(25)\n\u03c1totalf , \u03c1 qubit f are mixed states unless p = 0. One can think of these mixed states as a part of a bigger pure quantum state \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a comprising Alice, Bob, Charlie and Derek such that TrD( \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a \u2329 \u03c8ABCD \u2223 \u2223) = \u03c1 qubit/total f . In the language of quantum cryptography, one would say Derek \u2018holds\u2019 a purification of the mixed tripartite state. Since \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a\nis a pure state, Derek is the most general eavesdropper. Any larger quantum system \u03c1ABCD\u2206 with more eavesdroppers \u22061,\u22062, . . . ,\u2206N will be of the separable form \u03c1ABCD\u2206 = \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a \u2329 \u03c8ABCD \u2223\n\u2223 \u2297 \u03c1\u22061,\u22062,...,\u2206N , which means that \u22061,\u22062, . . . ,\u2206N cannot be correlated with \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a .\nIn this paper, we will use the spectral decomposition of a density matrix to obtain a purification of \u2223 \u2223\u03c8ABCD \u232a\n[27] from \u03c1 total/qubit f .

For the GHZ state, it means that with probability (1\u2212 p)3 the state is unaltered; with probability 3p(1\u2212p)2, the GHZ state is transformed into a bipartite entangled state and with probability 3p2(1\u2212p)+p3, it is transformed into a separable state.\nIt was shown in Ref.

Bipartite entangled states and separable states do not violate this inequality while the tripartite entangled perfect GHZ state ( |000\u3009+|111\u3009\u221a 2 ) violates it max-\nimally (S = 4 \u221a 2).

            "text": "In this paper, we have performed a device independent study of controlled teleportation of a qubit with an untrusted receiver. We constructed a device independently testable scenario in a way that allowed us to certify in the context of controlled teleportation, whether quantum resources were being used by the device despite the receiver being untrusted. We found in this case that the well-known Svetlichny inequality must be violated to certify quantum correlations. A maximal violation of the Svetlichny inequality guarantees maximum control power. This is in contrast to the controlled teleportation with all trusted parties where the maximal violation of Mermin\u2019s inequality was sufficient to certify maximum control power. This indicates that a stronger form of nonlocality, also known as \u2018genuine tripartite nonlocality\u2019, is required to device independently test the controlled quantum teleportation with an untrusted receiver. Until recently [13], there was no application of higher order Bell\u2019s inequalities in DI quantum cryptography. Our work demonstrates one of the first instances of the usefulness of stronger forms of Bell\u2019s inequalities (Svetlichny inequality in this case) in DI quantum communication protocols. We proposed an adversarial strategy which, while not proven to be optimal, can effectively decrease the controller\u2019s authority by taking advantage of a non-ideal device that non-maximally violates Svetlichny inequality. By taking the example of two families of quantum states characterized by the total depolarized and the qubit depolarized GHZ states, we showed that the controller\u2019s authority is a monotonically increasing function of the maximal Svetlichny inequality violation. For the given family of depolarized GHZ states, adversarial strategy and a Svetlichny inequality violation, one can infer the controller\u2019s authority from our numerically obtained plot. We found a window of non-maximal Svetlichny inequality violation where the controller\u2019s authority is nonzero. This shows that the controlled teleportation scheme with an untrusted receiver is robust to depolarizing noise present in the device. This result can be a guiding framework for practical implementations of DI CQT. In this paper we have used effective control power as the figure of merit in DI CQT, whereas the authors of [13] used (1\u2212pguess) (probability of the untrusted receiver guessing the wrong secret bit) as the figure of merit in the DI secret sharing of a bit. However, we see that in both\ncases, the relationship of these figures of merit with that of genuine tripartite nonlocality is very similar. From this observation, intuition suggests that the von Neumann entropy of the quantum information revealed to the untrusted receiver would show similar trends to that of effective control power in DI CQT. The translation from effective control power to an entropic measure of quantum information would help to generalize our work to a multipartite QSS protocol.\nSince CQT forms the basis of quantum teleportation networks, the techniques developed for DI analysis in this paper provide a stepping stone for performing DI analysis of quantum networks with untrusted nodes and practical implementation of a quantum internet."
