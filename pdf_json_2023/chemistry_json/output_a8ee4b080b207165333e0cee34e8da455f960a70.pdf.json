In this work, we investigate the limits of their classical and near-classical treatment while staying within the framework of quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver. To this end, we consider naive and physically motivated, classically efficient product ansatz for the parametrized wavefunction adapting the separable pair ansatz form. We combine it with post-treatment to account for interactions between subsystems originating from this ansatz. The classical treatment is given by another quantum circuit that has support between the enforced subsystems and is folded into the Hamiltonian. To avoid an exponential increase in the number of Hamiltonian terms, the entangling operations are constructed from purely Clifford or near-Clifford circuits. While Clifford circuits can be simulated efficiently classically, they are not universal. In order to account for missing expressibility, near-Clifford circuits with only few, selected non-Clifford gates are employed. The exact circuit structure to achieve this objective is moleculedependent and is constructed using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. We demonstrate our approach on a set of molecules of interest and investigate the extent of our methodology\u2019s reach.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAn important goal of computational chemistry is to understand the behavior of strongly correlated electronic systems, as they are key to many applications in materials science. Examples hereof are the development of more efficient catalysts, drugs or high-temperature superconductors. Since the computational complexity of many existing classical, exact numerical methods scales exponentially with system size owing to solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, there has been increased interest in developing quantum algorithms for this task in recent years [1\u2013 3]. One of the most popular approaches for finding the ground state [4] and several low-lying excited states [5\u20138] is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) [9\u201311].\nThe VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that utilizes the variational principle to find variational approximations to the eigenstates and associated eigenvalues of a molecular Hamiltonian. Given a molecular Hamiltonian encoded as a linear combination of tensor products of Pauli operators, a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is used to prepare a trial wavefunction\n\u2217 aspuru@utoronto.ca\n(ansatz) and compute its energy. By optimizing the parameters of the quantum circuit, approximations to the ground and also excited states and their energies can be obtained. The VQE has been successfully applied to simulations of small molecules on quantum hardware [12]. One strategy to find trial wavefunctions is given by chemically-inspired ansatze, such as the popular family of Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatze [4, 13]. UCC utilizes domain knowledge from quantum chemistry to prepare trial wavefunctions by exciting electrons from a reference state, which is usually the Hartree-Fock state. In contrast, hardware-efficient ansatze [12, 14] construct circuits from a limited set of gates that exploit the characteristics of the underlying device, such as connectivity or coherence time. Instead of directly encoding chemical knowledge into the ansatz, hardware-efficient ansatze rather try to be maximally expressible given hardware constraints. Despite continuous development of quantum hardware, current devices are prone to significant errors and can only support a limited number of operations on a few qubits, which limits the complexity of the quantum circuits used to generate trial wavefunctions. Thus, the development of techniques for designing shallow and resource-efficient ansatze is not only academically significant, but also of considerable practical importance. High gate errors and low coherence times of devices that ar X iv :2 30 3. 01 22\n1v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 0\nJu l 2\n02 3\n2 are available in the current and near future \u2013 so called noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) [15] \u2013 pose a critical limit to the circuit depth. As a result, many techniques have been developed to find suitable shallow circuits, see refs. 9, 11, 13 for a representative overview.\nIn this work, we attempt to clusterize circuits to facilitate the usage of existing NISQ devices to run larger experiments. There has been recent work in this direction, as in refs. 16, 17. Both studies attempt to discover clusters or reduce the number of qubits per circuit through the utilization of correlation metrics. While ref. 16 makes use of mutual information to clusterize the circuit, ref. 17 uses entanglement forging to divide the circuit into two pieces that are executed separately. In our method, we pre-define the clusters and generally \u201ccut\u201d the circuit into two equally large pieces. We consider two options in choosing the clusters. For a physically motivated choice, we use the separated-pair-ansatz from ref. 18, which is classically tractable and provides a natural clustering into electron-pairs, made up of pair-natural orbitals [19, 20]. Beyond that, we also consider arbitrary clusters. Here, we expect that the sub-optimal choice of clusters can be accounted for by a Clifford circuit since permutation of qubits can be realized as a sequence of Clifford gates. Then, to re-gain lost correlation by assuming the product state, we search for a re-entangling circuit.In order to enable that the quantum computation can be carried out on hardware with a lower number of qubits, we use this circuit to similarity-transform the system Hamiltonian. In the literature[21], this transform is often called \u201cfolding\u201d or \u201cdressing\u201d the Hamiltonian. This procedure then is similar to the virtual Heisenberg circuits from ref. 22 or ref. 16. The latter optimizes, beyond the quantum and the virtual circuit, a classical neural network to enable error mitigation.The circuit that modifies the Hamiltonian is trained together with VQE circuits, minimizing the overall energy. This means that the (near-)Clifford circuit modifies the Hamiltonian so that its ground state is closer to a product state. This procedure is briefly outlined in fig. 1. We emphasize here, that both the cluster circuits as well as the virtual circuits are to be optimized. This means that for each modification of the virtual circuit, the parameters in the cluster circuits will be adjusted.\nFor the re-entangling circuits, we will first focus on using Clifford circuits only. The latter describe sequences of unitaries composed of elements of the Clifford group. Thus, they leave the number of Pauli strings when transforming a Hamiltonian in the Pauli basis invariant. As a consequence, the measurement complexity does not increase as opposed to folding general gates into the Hamiltonian. This will be extended by near-Clifford circuits, which introduce a small number of non-Clifford operations into these gate sequences so that the expressibility is increased but the operator complexity does not increase vastly. It is known that Clifford circuits are efficiently simulatable classically but do not form a uni-\n\u2702 \u2702\nFIG. 1: Overview of our proposed method of dividing large system into smaller pieces. The ansatz consists of two parts: (i) VQE-like circuits denoted by gray boxes and with continuous, variational parameters (ii) near-Clifford, classically simulable circuit (green box) whose architecture is to be found by the optimizer as well. Near-Clifford circuits are evaluated by modifying (or dressing) the Hamiltonian H.\nversal set of quantum gates [23\u201325]. There have been recent efforts for the usage of Clifford circuits on earlystage quantum computers, such as the development of initialization strategies to find better initial circuits and guesses for gate parameters based on Clifford gates only [26, 27]. Other areas of application include classically efficient compression of quantum circuits [28] and a standalone ansatz for variational quantum algorithms [29]. Such a parametrization however is not able to reproduce the results obtained with universal gate sets due to limited expressibility of the Clifford group. In this study, we are exploring the limit to which classical post-processing (mostly relying on Clifford gates) can reduce the resource requirements in quantum chemistry calculations. Since Clifford gates form a discrete set, the optimization requires specialized techniques, as described in section IID.\nWe start this work by outlining our proposed methodology in section II, including a motivation for the choice of clusters, looking at how to fold important circuit identities and the way Clifford and near-Clifford circuits are constructed. Then, we show results in section III for simulating the ground-states of several molecules (H2, N2 and BeH2) before concluding our work in section IV."

            "text": "We choose subsystems either in a naive, unformed manner or guided by physical intuition.\nIn the naive approach, we set clusters by simply cutting the circuit in Ncl roughly equally large clusters without considering any additional information. This allows us to test the capabilities of the re-entangling circuit M(\u03c4) to correct for shortcomings of the naive clustering compared to the physically motivated approach and experiment with more arbitrary clusterings - for example, within electron pairs. In particular, we will see that the inclusion of permutations [30] into the ansatz allows the approach to retrieve a more optimal clustering.\nFor the physically motivated splitting, we use the separated-pair ansatz (SPA) [18] with fixed pair-natural orbitals \u2013 i.e., we are not considering orbital-optimization as in ref. 31. The SPA ansatz admits a natural decomposition into factorized clusters made up by Nel/2 electron pairs, where the full wavefunction reads (cp. Eq. (15) in ref. 18)\n|\u03c8SPA\u27e9 = Nel/2\u220f j=1 Uj(\u03b8j)UHF |00 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\u27e9 , (3)\nwith pair-specific UCC-circuits Uj , number of electrons Nel and a circuit to prepare the Hartree-Fock state UHF.\nThe reasoning behind our method is that we, on one hand, would like to push the boundaries of the classically efficient SPA-ansatz. On the other hand, we also expect a self-assembly of clusters throughout our technique. The latter can be understood in the sense of the so-called\npermVQE [30], where qubits (or conversely, orbitals) are permuted in order to maximize mutual information leading to a reduction in circuit depth. Since permutations are Clifford operations, including them in the allowed set of operators for M(\u03c4) does not increase complexity of the Hamiltonian. This means that the sub-optimal choice of clusters here is correctable by the virtual circuit M(\u03c4).\nAs we will discuss later in section II C, any modification of the Hamiltonian beyond Clifford gates may increase its complexity in form of the number of independent terms in the Pauli basis significantly. While it is in general beneficial to use measurement reduction techniques to lighten the measurement load, it can particularly help here when non-Clifford gates in M(\u03c4) increase the measurement complexity. These procedures typically effectuate a grouping of the Hamiltonian terms by various means so that multiple terms can be measured simultaneously [32\u201337]. At this point, we note that most of the techniques find a unitary operation that is applied directly before measurement so that the grouping of terms can be achieved in a desired basis. This is the case in particular for the methodologies outlined in refs. 36, 37 that suppress the cost to at most O(N2) measurements. Unfortunately, this unitary gate needs to be evaluated on the quantum hardware with support beyond clusters for the method to be effective, which is impractical when dividing the circuit into clusters with the objective to run each cluster on hardware independently. However, one can still make advantage of graph clique cover methods such as ref. 34 and especially the approach proposed in ref. 35, which can also compress the measurements into a number of partitions that is at best O ( N2 ) ."

This allows us to implement the mapping H M(\u03c4)\u2212\u2192 H\u0303(\u03c4) by sequentially folding individual operations Vl(\u03c4l). Since folding operations to find V \u2020l HVl are an important part of our method (cp. to fig. 2), we first look at efficient ways to find analytical implementations, using different classes of unitary gates. This encompasses recent work [40\u201343] related to analytical gradients for parametrized quantum circuits using the parameter-shift rule [44], where in this work, we resort to refs. 40, 41 in particular. We first investigate rotation-like gates, whose generators are involutions, and gates that are generated by projections. Both have in common that their generators have exactly two eigenvalues, while the latter can be reformulated as the former by modifications so that their spectrum is symmetric around zero. Beyond that, we discuss excitation-like gates, whose spectrum differs from involutions by an additional zero-eigenvalue, and discuss a strategy for general gates that is inspired by ref. 41.\na. Rotation-like gates. For rotation-like gates such as RX , RY , RZ , the generators are involutions G2 = 1. Hence we can write V (\u03c4) = cos ( \u03c4 2 ) 1 \u2212 i sin ( \u03c4 2 ) G. This gives us the identity\nV \u2020(\u03c4)HV (\u03c4) = cos2 (\u03c4 2 ) H + sin2 (\u03c4 2 ) GHG\n\u2212 i cos (\u03c4 2 ) sin (\u03c4 2 ) [H,G].\n(6)\nb. Projector-generated gates. Another important class of gates is generated by projection operators, i.e. G2 = G. We can motivate this class in the following way: If one tries to generate an X-gate by using the rotation RX(\u03c0) = exp ( \u2212i\u03c02X ) , one obtains \u2212iX. A phase-true X is generated by the projection G = 12 (1\u2212X) and \u03c4 = 2\u03c0, i.e. X = exp ( \u2212i\u03c02 (1\u2212X) ) . One can thus generally relate this to the class of rotation-like gates from the above section with self-inverse generators G\u0303 and associated angles \u03c4\u0303 by setting \u03c4 = 2\u03c4\u0303 and G = 12 (1\u2212 G\u0303):\nV (\u03c4) = exp ( \u2212i\u03c4 2 G ) \u2261 exp ( \u2212i \u03c4\u0303 2 G\u0303 ) . (7)\nThis means that projector-generated gates are equivalent up to a U(1) transformation to rotation-like gates since G\u03032 = 1. We still deem it worthy to mention them as a separate class to emphasize that a phase-true implementation of certain gates requires a projection as generator, which is of importance for controlled versions of these gates. Hence upon having done this substitution, the folding can be performed just as in eq. (6).\n5 c. Excitation-like gates. For quantum chemistry applications, circuit elements corresponding to fermionic excitations are of particular interest as they conserve particle-number symmetry. Beyond that, qubit excitations [13, 21, 45, 46] or (multi)-controlled rotations belong to this class. These gates belong to a class of operations that are generated by G = P+ \u2212P\u2212 +P0, projecting on eigenstates with symmetric eigenvalues \u00b1\u03bb and 0. One may express the generated unitary operator as [40]\nV (\u03c4) = cos (\u03c4 2 ) 1\u2212 i sin (\u03c4 2 ) G+ ( 1\u2212 cos (\u03c4 2 )) P0. (8)\nThe associated folded Hamiltonian is then V \u2020(\u03c4)HV (\u03c4) = cos2 (\u03c4 2 ) H + sin2 (\u03c4 2 ) GHG (9)\n+ ( (1\u2212 cos (\u03c4 2 ))2 P0HP0\n\u2212 i cos (\u03c4 2 ) sin (\u03c4 2 ) [H,G] (10)\n+ cos (\u03c4 2 )( 1\u2212 cos (\u03c4 2 )) {H,P0}\n+ i sin (\u03c4 2 )( 1\u2212 cos (\u03c4 2 )) (GHP0 \u2212 P0HG) .\n(11)\nd. General gates. To obtain an exact expression for general gates, one can use the spectral decomposition of Hermitian generators G = \u2211 k \u03bbkPk, with \u03bbk eigenvalues and Pk projectors on the respective eigenspaces and then proceed similarly as for excitation-like gates, e.g. following the procedure outlined in section B.2. of ref. 41. If the dimensionality of the generator prohibits a numerical eigendecomposition, the gate may be decomposed into lower-dimensional building blocks.\ne. Hamiltonian-dependent identities. Whenever the transformed Hamiltonian has specific properties they might be exploited for similarity transformations with specific gates. A prominent example relevant in the context of this work are fermionic single-excitations with Gpq = \u2212i\u03bapqa\u2020paq and anti-Hermitian matrix \u03ba in combination with Hamiltonians consisting of fermionic annihilation (creation) operators ap (a\u2020p) only.

Next, we explore the types of circuits that facilitate the recovery of correlation energy lost through the clustering of states. Using quantum-chemical encoding (see e.g. reviews [2, 3]), a molecular Hamiltonian can be written as a linear combination of Pauli strings\nH = \u2211 \u03b1 c\u03b1P\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1 c\u03b1\u03c3\u03b11 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03c3\u03b1Nq , (12)\nwhere \u03b1 = (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1Nq ) and \u03c3\u03b1j \u2208 {1, X, Y, Z} is a Pauli matrix acting on site \u03b1j . We transform the original Hamiltonian as described above in section II C 1 and measure expectation value of\nH\u0303 =M(\u03c4)\u2020HM(\u03c4) = \u2211 \u03b1 c\u03b1M(\u03c4) \u2020P\u03b1M(\u03c4). (13)\nThe complexity of the measurement depends on the cardinality of the transformed Hamiltonian, i.e., the number of distinct Pauli strings in H\u0303 that require independent measurement.\nAt this point, we notice that the cardinality of the transformed Hamiltonian can significantly grow, depending on the structure of M(\u03c4). For single-qubit gates M(\u03c4) \u2208 SU(2), one can write\nM(\u03c4) = exp(i\u03c4 n\u20d7 \u00b7 \u03c3\u20d7) = cos(\u03c4)1+ i sin(\u03c4)n\u20d7 \u00b7 \u03c3\u20d7, (14)\nwhere \u2225n\u20d7\u2225 = 1, \u03c3\u20d7 = (X,Y, Z). We further note that the Pauli operators (together with phase factors, see eq. (15)) form a group. On one qubit, this means that due to the closure property, transformation of a Pauli operator by a single-qubit operation as in eq. (14) can only produce terms with {1, X, Y, Z}, up to the phase factors. Thus for each single-qubit operator that transforms a Pauli-string in the Hamiltonian as in eq. (12), the number of terms grows at most by a factor of 4. Then, for a system of Nq qubits, a virtual circuit consisting of only single-qubit gates leads to a cardinality of at most |H\u0303| \u2264 O ( 4Nq |H| ) [50]. This bound holds as well for multi-qubit gates. Thus, dressing the Hamiltonian with general gates is very costly and should be avoided. As an example, we show the increase in number of terms for folding a UCCSD circuit into the Hamiltonians for H2, BeH2 and N2 in fig. 7a. The cost-effective solution is given by gates from the Clifford group Cn, which is defined as the subgroup of the unitary group that normalizes the Pauli group. That is, the set of unitary operations that keep the Pauli group\n\u03a0n = { ei\u03b8 \u03c0 2 \u03c30 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03c3n : \u03b8 \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, (15)\n\u03c3j \u2208 {1, X, Y, Z} }\ninvariant under similarity transformations [51], i.e.\nCn = {U : U\u2020\u03c3U = \u03c3\u2032;\u03c3, \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 \u03a0n}. (16)\nHence for M(\u03c4) \u2208 Cn, the cardinality of a Hamiltonian over n qubits remains unchanged.\nHowever, for Clifford gates only, we just introduce a certain, restricted type of entanglement between the clusters as Clifford circuits are not universal [23, 52]. This might already prove useful, but ultimately we considering near-Clifford circuits, so that we can control the additional cost and take benefit from more general transformations. Such circuits are composed mostly out of\n6 Clifford gates, however, also contain a limited number of non-Clifford gates in order to boost expressiblity.\nref. 53 also has investigated the growth of Hamiltonian terms for certain non-Clifford circuits as the qubit coupled cluster (QCC) approach can be formulated as a folding of the Hamiltonian. They found that, while exponential increase cannot be avoided, the coefficient c for an increase that goes as cN , is smaller for so-called involutory linear combinations of entanglers that lead to a involution as opposed to standard QCC entanglers. More recently, ref. 54 extended this work by exploiting the structure of the Clifford group to build a Hamiltonian that is folded by so-called normalizer Pauli strings rather than qubit excitations. Within their approach, they circumvent the complications that come with a discrete optimization problem, however, they do not address a Clifford-only circuit, which is the main focus of this work."

At the same time, both structure and parameters need to be adjusted for the near-Clifford circuits, which are supposed to account lost correlation due to the enforced product ansatz in the Uj \u2019s. For the case when M \u2208 CNq , there are no continuous parameters available that would allow an adaptive scheme such as in the family of ADAPT-VQE methods [55, 56] and qubit coupled cluster techniques [21, 45] as the Clifford group only forms a discrete set. One could think of Bayesian mappings from the discrete gate set to a continuous parameter such as in ref. 57 or a simple simulated annealing strategy as in ref. 29. In our tests, a simulated annealing strategy was surpassed by a genetic algorithm, which is what we use and will describe in the following.\nThe genetic algorithm we choose resorts to an operator pool, which it uses as a reference set for the discrete optimization problem. Elements of the operator pool are used to modify the circuit by adding new operators and modifying existing gates in M(\u03c4).\nThe operator pool we use can be found in table I. Aside from the generators of the Clifford group (H,S,CX), we also include the Pauli gates, controlled Pauli gates, a SWAP gate to mimic permutations. These have proven helpful in ref. 30 to reorganize the correlation pattern in the state, so it is easier to describe with a cluster product ansatz. We also include gate blueprints that are inspired by fermionic excitations [13], where we fix the angle of the freely parametrized RZ-rotation in the center aiming to obtain an approximate representation in form of a Clifford gate so that it is either one of S,Z, S\u2020. These are supposed to mimic gate sequences that have proven\nuseful in finding ground-states for quantum chemistry. Extending the gate pool may aid to speed up optimization, as these sequences can be picked from the pool and do not need to be found via optimization. Next, we explain the optimization procedure to find a Clifford circuit M , which is also described in algorithm 1.\nThe general procedure to generate the classical circuit is outlined in fig. 3. First, we generate a set of initial populations by randomly sampling circuits built from the operator pool. Any initial gates that do not have support over multiple clusters can be seen as an extension/modification of the cluster circuits; thus, one can choose to avoid them in the optimization procedure. We discuss this further in section III C.\nBased on the initial circuits per population, we impose a set of modifications, drawn randomly from the set of allowed operations. These are comprised of the addition of gates from the pool, exchanging specific gates with others or re-arranging them and deleting gates. We choose a scheduling so that each modification occurs with a certain probability; e.g., we found that favoring changing over deletion and addition is advantageous, while during early iterations the rate of additions should initially be higher.\nAlgorithm 1 Architecture search for M 1: Input operator pool, reference method / circuits, number\nof populations, offsprings per population and maximum iterations 2: for all populations do 3: compute reference energy 4: sample initial circuits M 5: optimize reference to compute energy with initial cir-\ncuits 6: end for 7: while not converged do 8: for all populations do 9: for all offsprings per population do\n10: propose modification to M 11: optimize reference to compute energy 12: end for 13: pick offspring to continue with based with proba-\nbility e\u2212 \u2206E T , update T\n14: end for 15: end while 16: Output circuit M , optimal reference, approximation to\nground-state energy\nThen, for each population, we allow a number of offsprings/children with independent modifications. We pick the child with the lowest energy to continue the search. After a set number of iterations or when a convergence criterion is fulfilled \u2013 here, the change in energy between iterations \u2013 we end the optimization and pick the minimum over all populations as an approximation to the optimal solution. Within the search, we make use of an additional \u201cpatience\u201d hyperparameter \u2013 this parameter is increased whenever the modifications does not lead to an improvement in energy. When the patience parameter\n7 Pool of Clifford gates {H,S,X, Y, Z,CX , CY , CZ , SWAP,Exc1,Exc2}\nExc1 Rot\nExc2\nRot\nRot \u2208 {S,Z, S\u2020}, \u2208 {RX(\u03c0/2), RY (\u03c0/2)}\nreaches a certain value, the associated population \u201cfrustrates\u201d and re-sets its circuit instructions to a previous stage. We further allow updates such as in simulated annealing, where we pick the best offspring per population with probability e\u2212 \u2206E T and decrease temperature T over the course of iterations. As a result, the best improvement in energy is picked most likely but there is still a chance that even an increase in energy would be allowed to avoid local minima; however, we do not allow increases in energy beyond the minmium energy that was found for the employed reference method U with M = 1.\nAfter each such optimization step, the parameters in the cluster circuit Uj(\u03b8) are adjusted. For the case of Clifford circuits, one may consider techniques proposed in refs. 58, 59 to further optimize the depth of the resulting circuits."

            "text": "It is well-known that circuits made up from Clifford gates only are not universal [23]. We aim to counter-act this by adding few non-Clifford gates to the circuit M(\u03c4). However, we also know that including more and more non-Cliffords likely leads to an immense increase in number of terms in the Hamiltonian, making measurement intractable. Thus what we understand as a near-Clifford circuit is a circuit that results in a \u201creasonable\u201d increase in the sense that |H\u0303| \u2264 C|H| for some moderately-sized constant C. In particular, we want to avoid a regime with exponential increase. An easy choice whose capabilities we will explore later on is modifying a single Clifford gate towards its parametrized version, i.e. for a Clifford gate UCliff with generator form UCliff = exp(\u2212i\u03b8CliffG) and fixed \u03b8Cliff, we use U(\u03b8) = exp(\u2212i\u03b8G) with a free parameter that can be used for optimization. Hence, for our experiments here, we will loop over all Clifford gates\nwithin the virtual circuits M , except for controlled gates and SWAP, and replace them with parametrized versions. We outline this strategy in algorithm 2. For example, we substitute X \u2192 RX(\u03c4) or Exc1;2 (cp. with Tab.

            "text": "Simulation code was written with the tequila [60] framework using the qulacs simulator [61] as simulation backend for the quantum circuits and the automat-\n8\nically differentiable framework of [40]. Direct basis determination via pair-natural orbitals was performed with madness [62] as described in ref. 19 with the diagonal approximation described in ref. 18 and the MP2-PNO implementation of ref. 20 without cusp regularization. The latter interfaces mean-field implementations described in refs. 63, 64. The Jordan-Wigner encoding corresponds to the implementation in OpenFermion [65]. Orbitals in standard basis sets were computed with psi4 [66]while orbital optimization was carried out in pyscf [67, 68].\nFor the genetic algorithm as outlined in fig. 3, we choose the number of populations between 10\u201315 and the number of offsprings per population as 8\u201310. The convergence criterion for the reference method is set to 10\u22125, and the maximum number of iterations (tree depth in fig. 3) is set between 10\u201325. We observed that the performance of the algorithm is quite insensitive to these parameters (around 10\u22124 milli-Hartrees), which motivates our choice, cp. to fig. 10 the SI in appendix B.\nFor all the following results, we show the error of various employed methods with respect to the exact ground state (Full Configuration Interaction) within the same basis set. The reference state as in eq. (17) is obtained following the procedure in in the SI in appendix A. With this as a starting point, we assemble a virtual circuit M built from Clifford gates only (\u201cReference + Cliffords\u201d) and subsequently search over all Clifford gates and check if the energy can be improved by optimizing their parameter when making them parametrized (\u201cReference + Near-Clifford circuit\u201d).\nHydrogen molecule\nWe use the 6-31G basis set for H2, where we choose an active space of six spin-orbitals to obtain a six-qubit toy example. As a reference, we enforce a product state of overall six qubits, made up by the product over a state containing the \u201cfirst\u201d and another one containing the \u201clast\u201d three orbitals. Here, first and last corresponds to the ordering with respect to orbital energies. As showcased in fig. 4, this approach has a rather high error, of the order of hundreds of milli-Hartree. However, addition of a virtual Clifford circuit enables to suppress the error to the order of milli-Hartrees. In the case of small bond distances, the reduction is as much as three orders of magnitude. For large bond distances, the improvement by adding additional entanglement is lower but still accounts for roughly one order of magnitude. This is because the true state is close to a state preparable by a pure Clifford circuit supported only on the first four qubits as explained in ref. 31. To sum up, we observe significant improvement for Clifford-gates only. While the addition of freely parametrized non-Clifford gates does not reliably lower the energy, if successful, it can yield up to another order of magnitude in accuracy.\nNitrogen molecule\nFor the N2 molecule, as depicted in fig. 5, the SPA outperforms our product state reference method in most regimes, while still not coming close to FCI level. The SPA performs worse here due to the surrogate model that is used to generate the PNOs which are used as a basis.

(17) or appendix A in the SI.\nPlesset perturbation theory and thus the PNOs inherit its shortcomings [19, 20, 69]. Even more powerful models, such as k-UpCCGSD, struggle here [18, 70]. While our method makes use of the same PNO basis, it is, in contrast to the SPA, able to recover a part of this error.\nUpon addition of a virtual Clifford circuit, we again observe a consistent improvement. It is noticeable that for short bond lengths, SPA and our method overall perform quite comparably. For longer bond lengths, despite using the same PNO basis as SPA, it seems to be able to recover part of the error due to the basis. Furthermore, we found that parametrizing a single Clifford gate of the virtual circuit for the most part improves the energies compared to the Clifford circuit only barely. As the parameter space for N2 is already considerably large, convergence of the genetic algorithm for the Clifford-circuit already takes rather long. The increase in complexity by adding even a single non-Clifford gate already makes it hard for the algorithm to find optimal configurations.\nBeryllium hydride\nWe further consider BeH2 as a system of interest in comparison with results from ref. 18. We use a basis of eight qubits in a frozen-core approximation using MRAPNOs (PNOs determined by multi-resolution analysis), made up by two clusters of two spatial orbitals based on each bonding electron pair. As expected, we can see in fig. 6a that the SPA-ansatz slightly outperforms our reference method. However, the addition of a virtual circuit made up by Cliffords only allows to improve beyond the SPA. This can be further boosted by parametrizing one of the Clifford gates. We note that the improvement seems to produce a somewhat constant offset, while the general behaviour of the error curve remains unchanged. This behaviour is similar to orbital optimization on top of the SPA reference (OO-SPA), as done in ref. 18. However, we note that the improvement by the optimized Clifford circuits and especially near-Clifford circuits is generally slightly higher. This is despite of the orbital optimizations being non-Clifford operations, which are typically expected to be more expressible. We observed that the behaviour of the procedure is more favorable if power method-based reference method is used instead of the SPA as a reference. The outcome of the initial optimization is somewhat randomized and therefore has eased to find gate sequences that lower the energy in subsequent iterations. We expect SPA to be stuck in a more stable local minimum as compared to the iterative power-method solver, as for SPA, our procedure consistently either aborted early or only led to circuits outputting the same energy. Beyond that, we provide a discussion on fidelity computations for optimization outcomes with eigenstates obtained by direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the eight qubit basis in the SI in appendix C, fig. 11.\nWe next investigate the consequences of using nonoptimal clustering, i.e. clusters from different bonding electron pairs. We mix pairs so that a spin-orbital of one pair is exchanged with one the other pair. Results for this case can be found in figs. 6b and 6c as well as that the reference method behaves significantly worse. However, this does not seem to influence the outcome of the computations that include a virtual circuit. This is likely due to the inclusion of SWAP gates into the operator pool, which are able to retrieve the optimal clustering by permuting orbitals [30]. In fact, we notice here that the circuits built from Clifford gates only perform as well as the near-Clifford circuits for most geometries and performs slightly better as in the un-permuted case. Since the employed algorithm is random and the outcome of the genetic algorithm with a finite number of populations and offsprings has some variance, this is not surprising.\n10\n1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 Bond Distance Be H in Angstrom\n10 3\n10 2\nEn er\ngy d\niff er\nen ce\nE E F\nCI in\nH ar\ntre e\nReference method Reference + Clifford circuit Reference + Near-Clifford circuit SPA OO-SPA\n(a) BeH2 with clusters according to electron pairs, 8 qubit simulation\n1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 Bond Distance Be H in Angstrom\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\nEn er\ngy d\niff er\nen ce\nE E F\nCI in\nH ar\ntre e\nReference method Reference + Clifford circuit Reference + Near-Clifford circuit SPA OO-SPA\n(b) BeH2 with permuted reference clusters, also see fig. 6c.\nB. Increase in the number of Hamiltonian terms\nFor the results discussed above, we show the increase of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian when folding the classical circuit in fig. 7b, compared to folding a full UCCSD circuit several non-Clifford gates in fig. 7a. We show both the cardinality before (|H|) and after folding (|H\u0303|). Additionally we demonstrate the range of cardinalities that can be accessed by exchanging one Clifford gate for another one in the previously optimized Clifford circuits for each geometry. As expected, the upper bound of 4Nq times the previous complexity is respected.\nWhile it is clear that the measurement cost increases, we note that the increase when folding one gate should be manageable given that a single non-Clifford gate only increases the complexity by a constant factor. In fact, in the case of hydrogen, the cardinality after folding for the optimized circuit is almost at the lower bound of the range of circuits. However, this cannot be established as a trend for the larger systems."

We note that a recurring theme in the circuits discovered are CX ladder-like structures that entangle and exchange information across the qubits (fig. 8). One can also see that in the way we set up the algorithm, there is an initial part of the circuit that does not have support beyond the clusters. This means one can see this section of the virtual circuit rather as a part of U than M(\u03c4), and one may choose to not allow such gates if one assumes the reference circuit U is already good enough. An argument for leaving the gates that could be incorporated into the cluster-unitaries Uj is that the algorithm has identified a part of the description of the cluster-states |\u03c8j\u27e9 that can be described classically. This is beneficial when an ansatz for the circuits Uj has been established that is evaluated on real quantum computer. Then, thanks to M , the circuit for Uj could be shorter."

The range of folded circuits depicts the envelope of maximum- and\nClifford circuits to re-entangle a molecular wavefunction that has been enforced into the form of a product state. Within our proposed procedure, we use the energy as the only, global criterion for optimization; we deploy a genetic algorithm that mutates a set of random, initial virtual circuits using a Clifford operator pool. Empirical validation of our re-entangling method using Cliffords only shows that the partitioned ansatz, implemented on a smaller set of qubits, achieves similar levels of accuracy as the separable-pair ansatz. After successful optimization of the Clifford circuit, we \u201cturn on\u201d the parameter of one the Clifford gates in the virtual circuit to further improve the energy (while continuing to adjust the parameters in the cluster circuit). As we demonstrate, the increase in measurement cost using such near-Clifford circuits is still modest. A worthwhile direction to follow in the future would be to perform a more concise investigation of near-\nClifford operations in this context, e.g. resorting to the proposed approach in ref. 54 to assess the Hamiltonian growth.\nFuture work might include investigating more sophisticated genetic algorithms. Aside of cross-population mutations that enable broader exploration of the space of Clifford circuits, it would be interesting to include populations with permuted orbital ordering at the beginning of the optimization procedure. This is motivated by our observations in the case of BeH2 in fig. 6b, where the permuted ordering is able to outperform the optimal ordering for some geometries.\nDespite yielding significant improvements for H2 and BeH2, the improvements we see by adding the nonClifford gate is nearly negligible in the case of N2, which suggests that one non-Clifford gate is not enough in this case. Thus further work needs to be done to explore near-Clifford circuits and in particular influence of few, specific gates on the expressibility of circuits."
