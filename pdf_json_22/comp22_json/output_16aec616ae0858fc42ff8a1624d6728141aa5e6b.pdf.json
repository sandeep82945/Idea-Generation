As illustrated in Figure 1, the following basic connection between 2-layer graph drawings and graph pathwidth1 is folklore:\nObservation 1. A connected bipartite graph G has a 2-layer drawing with no crossings if and only if G is a caterpillar if and only if G has pathwidth 1.\nv0 v1 v2 v3 v4\nw0 w1 w2 w3 w4\nw0\nv0\nw1\nv0\nw1\nv1\nw1\nv2\nw2\nv2\nw3\nv2\nw4\nv2\nw4\nv3\nw4\nv4\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n06 65\n6v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nC O\n] 1\n4 Ju\nl 2 02\nMotivated by this connection, we consider (and answer) the following question: what properties of 2-layer drawings characterise bipartite graphs of bounded pathwidth?\nA matching in a graph G is a set of edges in G, no two of which are incident to a common vertex. A k-matching is a matching of size k. In a 2-layer drawing of a graph G, a k-crossing is a set of k pairwise crossing edges (which necessarily is a k-matching). Excluding a k-crossing is not enough to guarantee bounded pathwidth. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2, if Th is the complete binary tree of height h, then Th has a 2-layer drawing with no 3-crossing, but it is well known that Th has pathwidth bh/2c+ 1. Even stronger, if Gh is the h\u00d7h square grid graph, then Gh has a 2-layer drawing with no 3-crossing, but Gh has treewidth and pathwidth h.\nAngelini, Lozzo, F\u00f6rster, and Schneck [1] showed that every graph that has a 2-layer drawing with at most k crossings on each edge has pathwidth at most k + 1. However, this property does not characterise bipartite graphs with bounded pathwidth. For example, as illustrated in Figure 3, if Sn is the 1-subdivision of the n-leaf star, then Sn is bipartite with pathwidth 2, but in every 2-layer drawing of Sn, some edge has at least (n\u2212 1)/2 crossings.\nThese examples motivate the following definition. A set S of edges in a 2-layer drawing is non-crossing if no two edges in S cross. In a 2-layer drawing of a graph G, an (s, t)-crossing is a pair (S, T ) where S is a non-crossing s-matching, T is a non-crossing t-matching, and every edge in S crosses every edge in T ; as illustrated in Figure 4.\nWe show that excluding a k-crossing and an (s, t)-crossing guarantees bounded pathwidth.\nTheorem 2. For all k, s, t \u2208 N, every bipartite graph G that has a 2-layer drawing with no (k+1)-crossing and no (s, t)-crossing has pathwidth at most 8k2(t\u22121)+4k2(s\u22121)2(s\u22122)+5k+4.\nWe prove the following converse to Theorem 2.\nTheorem 3. For any k \u2208 N every bipartite graph G with pathwidth at most k has a 2-layer drawing with no (k + 2)-crossing and no (k + 1, k + 1)-crossing.\nTheorems 2 and 3 together establish the following rough characterisation of bipartite graphs with bounded pathwidth, thus answering the opening question.\nCorollary 4. A class G of bipartite graphs has bounded pathwidth if and only if there exists k, s, t \u2208 N such that every graph in G has a 2-layer drawing with no k-crossing and no (s, t)-crossing."

            "text": "Lemma 5. Let G be a bipartite graph with bipartition A, B, where each vertex in A has degree at least 1 and each vertex in B has degree at most d. Assume that G has a 2-layer drawing with no (k + 1)-crossing and no non-crossing (` + 1)-matching. Then |A| 6 k`d.\nProof. Let X be a set of edges in G with exactly one edge in X incident to each vertex in A. So |X| = |A|. Let E1, . . . , Ed be the partition of X, where for each edge vw \u2208 Ei, if v \u2208 A and w \u2208 B, then v is the i-th neighbour of w with respect to A. So each Ei is a matching. By Dilworth\u2019s Theorem, there is a partition Ei,1, . . . , Ei,k of Ei such that edges in each Ei,j are pairwise non-crossing. By assumption, |Ei,j | 6 `. Thus |A| = |X| 6 k`d.\nProof of Theorem 2. (We make no effort to optimise the bound on the pathwidth of G.) Let A and B be the layers in the given drawing of G. Let A be the total order of A, where v \u227aA w if v is to the left of w in the drawing. Define B similarly. Let be the poset on E(G), where vw xy if v A x and w B y. Two edges of G are comparable under if and only if they do not cross. Thus every antichain under is a matching of pairwise crossing edges. Hence there is no antichain of size k + 1 under . By Dilworth\u2019s Theorem [9], there is a partition of E(G) into k chains under . Each chain is a caterpillar forest, which can be oriented with outdegree at most 1 at each vertex. So each vertex has out-degree at most k. For each vertex v, let N+G [v] := {w \u2208 V (G) : \u2212\u2192vw \u2208 E(G)} \u222a {v}, which has size at most k + 1.\nLet X = {e1, . . . , en} be a maximal non-crossing matching, where e1 \u227a e2 \u227a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u227a en. Let Y0 be the set of vertices of G strictly to the left of e1. For i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n\u2212 1}, let Yi be the set of vertices of G strictly between ei and ei+1. Let Yn be the set of vertices of G strictly to the right of en. By the maximality of X, each set Yi is independent. For i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n},\narbitrarily enumerate Yi = {vi,1, . . . , vi,mi}. Note that vi,j is an end-vertex of no edge in X (for all i, j).\nFor each i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, if ei = xy then let Ni = N+G [x]\u222aN + G [y] and let Vi be the set consisting of Ni along with every vertex v \u2208 V (G) such that some arc \u2212\u2192xv \u2208 E(G) crosses ei. Note that |Ni| 6 2(k + 1). For each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n} and j \u2208 {1, . . . , mi}, let Vi,j := (Vi\u222aVi+1)\u222aN+G [vi,j ] where V0 := Vn+1 := \u2205.\nWe now prove that\n(V0,1, . . . , V0,m0 ; V1; V1,1, . . . , V1,m0 ; . . . ; Vn; Vn,1, . . . , Vn,mn) (1)\nis a path-decomposition of G. We first show that each vertex v is in some bag. If v is an end-vertex of some edge ei, then v \u2208 Vi. Otherwise v = vi,j for some i, j, implying that v \u2208 Vi,j , as desired. We now show that each vertex v is in a consecutive sequence of bags. Suppose that v \u2208 Vi \u2229 Vp and i < j < p. Thus ei \u227a ej \u227a ep. Our goal is to show that v \u2208 Vj . If v is an end-vertex of ej , then v \u2208 Vj . So we may assume that v is not an end-vertex of ej . By symmetry, we may assume that v is to the left of the end-vertex of ej in the same layer as v. Thus, v is not an end-vertex of ep. Since v \u2208 Vp, there is an arc \u2212\u2192yv that crosses ep or y is an end-vertex of ep. Since ej \u227a ep, this arc \u2212\u2192yv crosses ej . Thus v \u2208 Vj , as desired. This shows that v is in a consecutive (possibly empty) sequence of bags Vi, Vi+1, . . . , Vj . If v \u2208 Vi then v \u2208 Vi,j for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , mi}, and v \u2208 Vi\u22121,j for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , mi\u22121}. It remains to consider the case in which v is in no set Vi. Since the end-vertices of ei are in Vi, we have that v = vi,j for some i, j. Since Yi is an independent set, v is adjacent to no other vertex in Yi. Moreover, if there is an arc \u2212\u2192xv in G, then either x is an end-vertex of ei or ei\u22121, or \u2212\u2192xv crosses ei\u22121 or ei, implying v is in Vi\u22121 \u222a Vi, which is not the case. Hence v has indegree 0, implying Vi,j is the only bag containing v. This completes the proof that v is in a consecutive set of bags in (1). Finally, we show that the end-vertices of each edge are in some bag. Consider an arc \u2212\u2192vw in G. If v = vi,j for some i, j, then v, w \u2208 Vi,j , as desired. Otherwise, v is an end-vertex of some ei, implying v, w \u2208 Vi, as desired. Hence the sequence in (1) defines a path-decomposition of G. We now bound the width of this path-decomposition.\nFor i, j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n}, let Yi,j be the set of vertices v \u2208 Yi such that there is an arc \u2212\u2192xv in G with x \u2208 Yj . Suppose that |Yi,j | > 2k2|j \u2212 i|+ 1 for some i, j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n}. Without loss of generality, i 6 j and there exists Z \u2286 Yi,j \u2229A with |Z| > k2(j\u2212 i) + 1. Let H be the subgraph of G consisting of all arcs \u2212\u2192xv in G with x \u2208 Yj \u2229B and v \u2208 Z (and their end-vertices). If H has a non-crossing (j \u2212 i + 1)-matching M , then (X \\ {ei+1, . . . , ej}) \u222aM is a non-crossing matching in G larger than X, thus contradicting the choice of X. Hence H has no non-crossing (j \u2212 i + 1)-matching. By construction, H has no (k + 1)-crossing, every vertex in V (H) \u2229A has degree at least 1 in H, and every vertex in V (H) \u2229 B has degree at most k in H. By Lemma 5 applied to H with ` = j \u2212 i and d = k, we have |Z| = |V (H)\u2229A| 6 k2(j \u2212 i), which is a contradiction. Hence |Yi,j | 6 2k2|j \u2212 i| for all i, j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n}. For i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, let Pi be the set of vertices v in G for which there is an arc \u2212\u2192xv in G that crosses ei\u2212s+1, ei\u2212s+2, . . . , ei or crosses ei, ei+1, . . . , ei+s\u22121. Suppose that Pi > 4k2(t\u2212 1) + 1. Without loss of generality, there exists Q \u2286 Pi \u2229 A with |Q| > k2(t \u2212 1) + 1 such that for each vertex v \u2208 Q there is an arc \u2212\u2192xv in G that crosses ei\u2212s+1, ei\u2212s+2, . . . , ei. Let H be the subgraph of G consisting of all such arcs and their end-vertices. So V (H) \u2229A = Q. If H has a non-crossing t-matching M , then ({ei\u2212s+1, ei\u2212s+2, . . . , ei}, M) is an (s, t)-crossing. Thus H\nhas no non-crossing t-matching. By construction, H has no (k + 1)-crossing, every vertex in V (H)\u2229A has degree at least 1 in H, and every vertex in V (H)\u2229B has degree at most k in H. By Lemma 5 applied to H with ` = t\u2212 1 and d = k, we have |Q| = |V (H) \u2229A| 6 k2(t\u2212 1), which is a contradiction. Hence |Pi| 6 4k2(t\u2212 1) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nConsider a bag Vi, which consists of the end-vertices of ei, along with every vertex v \u2208 V (G) such that some arc \u2212\u2192xv \u2208 E(G) crosses ei. Thus\n|Vi| = |Ni|+ |Pi|+ \u2211\na,b\u2208{0,1,...,s\u22122} |Yi\u2212a,i+b|\n6 2(k + 1) + 4k2(t\u2212 1) + \u2211\na,b\u2208{0,1,...,s\u22122} 2k2|(i + b)\u2212 (i\u2212 a)|\n= 2(k + 1) + 4k2(t\u2212 1) + 2k2 \u2211\na,b\u2208{0,1,...,s\u22122} (a + b)\n= 2(k + 1) + 4k2(t\u2212 1) + 2k2 (s\u2212 1)  \u2211 a\u2208{0,1,...,s\u22122} a  + (s\u2212 1)  \u2211 b\u2208{0,1,...,s\u22122} b  = 2(k + 1) + 4k2(t\u2212 1) + 2k2(s\u2212 1)2(s\u2212 2).\nHence\n|Vi,j | 6 |Vi|+ |Vi+1|+ (k + 1) 6 4(k + 1) + 8k2(t\u2212 1) + 4k2(s\u2212 1)2(s\u2212 2) + (k + 1) 6 8k2(t\u2212 1) + 4k2(s\u2212 1)2(s\u2212 2) + 5(k + 1).\nTherefore the path-decomposition of G defined in (1) has width at most 8k2(t\u2212 1) + 4k2(s\u2212 1)2(s\u2212 2) + 5k + 4.\nProof of Theorem 3. Let (X1, . . . , Xn) be a path-decomposition of G with width k. Let `(v) := min{i : v \u2208 Xi} and r(v) := max{i : v \u2208 Xi} for each v \u2208 V (G). We may assume that `(v) 6= `(w) for all distinct v, w \u2208 V (G). Let {A, B} be a bipartition of G. Consider the 2-layer drawing of G, in which each v \u2208 A is at (`(v), 0), each v \u2208 B is at (`(v), 1), and each edge is straight.\nSuppose that {v1w1, . . . , vk+2wk+2} is a (k + 2)-crossing in this drawing, where vi \u2208 A and wi \u2208 B. Without loss of generality,\n`(v1) < `(v2) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(vk+2) and `(wk+2) < `(wk+1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(w1). (2)\nFor each i \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 2}, if `(vi) < `(wi) then let Ii := {`(vi), . . . , `(wi)}; otherwise let Ii := {`(wi), . . . , `(vi)}. By (2), Ii \u2229 Ij 6= \u2205 for distinct i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 2}. By the Helly property for intervals, there exists p \u2208 I1 \u2229 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2229 Ik+2. Thus vi or wi is in Xp for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 2}. Hence |Xp| > k + 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore there is no (k + 2)-crossing.\nSuppose that ({v1w1, . . . , vsws}, {x1y1, . . . , xsys}) is a (s, s)-crossing in this drawing, where vi, xi \u2208 A and wi, yi \u2208 B. Without loss of generality,\n`(v1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(vs) < `(x1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(xs) and `(y1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(ys) < `(w1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(ws).\nWe claim that k > s. If `(vs) < `(w1) then `(v1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(vs) < `(w1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(ws), implying v1, . . . , vs, w1 \u2208 X`(w1), and k > s. If `(ys) < `(x1) then `(y1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(ys) < `(x1) < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < `(xs), implying y1, . . . , ys, x1 \u2208 X`(x1), and k > s. Now assume that `(w1) < `(vs) and `(x1) < `(ys). Thus `(w1) < `(vs) < `(x1) < `(ys), which is a contradiction since `(ys) < `(w1). Hence s 6 k and the drawing of G has no (k + 1, k + 1)-crossing."
