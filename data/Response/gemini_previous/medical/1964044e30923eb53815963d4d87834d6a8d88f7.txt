1. **Investigate the mechanisms of resistance to ICI therapy in patients with advanced cSCC.** This could involve studying the genetic and molecular alterations that occur in tumors that become resistant to ICI, as well as the role of the tumor microenvironment in resistance. This knowledge could lead to the development of new strategies to overcome resistance and improve the efficacy of ICI therapy.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICI therapy in combination with other systemic therapies in patients with advanced cSCC.** This could include studies of ICI therapy in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or other immunotherapeutic agents. The goal of these studies would be to determine whether combination therapy can improve the response rate and survival of patients with advanced cSCC.


3. **Explore the role of ICI therapy in the adjuvant setting for patients with advanced cSCC.** This could involve studies of ICI therapy given after surgery or radiation therapy to prevent recurrence of disease. The goal of these studies would be to determine whether ICI therapy can improve the long-term survival of patients with advanced cSCC.


4. **Investigate the use of ICI therapy in patients with advanced cSCC who have immunosuppressive conditions.** This could include studies of ICI therapy in patients with autoimmune diseases, hematological malignancies, or solid organ transplants. The goal of these studies would be to determine whether ICI therapy is safe and effective in these patients and to identify strategies to manage the risk of immune-related adverse events.


5. **Develop and validate biomarkers that can predict response to ICI therapy in patients with advanced cSCC.** This could involve studies of genetic, molecular, or immunological markers that are associated with response to ICI therapy. The goal of these studies would be to develop tools that can help clinicians select patients who are most likely to benefit from ICI therapy.
