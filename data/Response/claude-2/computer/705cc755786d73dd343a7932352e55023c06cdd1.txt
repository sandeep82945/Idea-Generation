 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Investigate other object attributes that models may be sensitive to, such as occlusion, lighting conditions, color and texture changes, etc. Develop editing tools and benchmarks to evaluate model robustness to these attributes.

2. Explore different model architectures, training strategies and data augmentations to further enhance robustness against object attribute changes. For example, attention mechanisms, self-supervised pretraining, and compositional/modular networks could be promising directions.

3. Conduct experiments on larger scale datasets beyond ImageNet, such as COCO, to evaluate generalizability of findings. Also test on domain-specific datasets like medical images or autonomous driving datasets.

4. Perform model debugging and analysis to understand exactly why and how different attributes impact model performance. This can reveal insights into model representations and guide development of more robust models. 

5. Develop metrics beyond just accuracy drops to better quantify model robustness to attribute changes. Metrics based on uncertainty, sensitivity, causal influence etc. could prove useful.
