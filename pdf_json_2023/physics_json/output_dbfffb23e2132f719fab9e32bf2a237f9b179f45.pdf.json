    "abstractText": "In this work, we determine the dissociation line of the nitrogen (N2) hydrate by computer simulation using the TIP4P/Ice model for water and the TraPPE force field for N2. We use the solubility method proposed recently by some of us to evaluate the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at different pressures, from 500 to 1500 bar. Particularly, we calculate the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution when it is in contact with a N2-rich liquid phase and when in contact with the hydrate phase via planar interfaces as functions of temperature. Since the solubility of N2 decreases with temperature in the first case and increases with temperature in the second case, both curves intersect at a certain temperature that determines the dissociation temperature at a given pressure. We find a good agreement between the predictions obtained in this work and the experimental data taken from the literature in the range of pressures considered in this work. From our knowledge of the solubility curves of N2 in the aqueous solution, we also determine the driving force for nucleation of the hydrate, as a function of temperature, at different pressures. In particular, we use two different thermodynamic routes to evaluate the change in chemical potential for hydrate formation. Although the driving force for nucleation slightly decreases (in absolute value) when the pressure is increased, our results indicate that the effect of pressure can be considered negligible in the range of pressures studied in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the driving force for nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits crystallographic structure sII, along its dissociation line, is studied from computer simulation.

INTRODUCTION\nHydrates are non-stoichiometric inclusion solid compounds in which guest molecules, such as methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), among many other species, are enclathrated in the voids left by a periodic network of water molecules or host.1,2 Water molecules interact not only via dispersive attractive and repulsive interactions but also through specific, short-range, and highly directional hydrogen-bonding interactions, which determine the network arrangement of the system. The guests generally do not compete with the specific interactions that keep together the coordinated lattice formed by the host. Hydrates crystallize in the well-known structures sI, sII, and sH. Hydrates of small molecules, such as CH4 and CO2, form sI hydrates, while some small molecules, including N2 and H2, and in general larger substances, like THF, usually form sII hydrate structures.1,2\nThe formation of sII structures of hydrates with small molecules like N2 and H2 is unusual. However, the nonstoichiometric nature of hydrates offers the possibility of multiple cage occupancy.1,2 In 1997, the authors of the work of Kuhs et al.3 carried out a series of high-resolution neutron diffraction experiments on N2 hydrates that demonstrated that small cages exhibit single occupancy but large cages are doubly occupied at relatively high pressures. The experimental results were also corroborated by molecular dynamics computer simulations4\u20136 and additional experiments including neutron powder diffraction7 and Raman scattering measurements.8 More recently, some authors have also confirmed this idea via Monte Carlo simulations of the N2 hydrate. It is also important to mention the pioneering works of Alavi et al.9,10 on the study of the stability of H2 and H2 + tetrahydrofurane hydrates in the context of multiple occupancy from molecular dynamics simulations. Under this perspective, it is possible to understand, from a molecular perspective, why\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-1\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\nsmall molecules like N2 and H2 form, at least at low and moderate pressures, sII hydrate structure. The explanation of the preference to form sII hydrates instead of sI hydrates is because N2 and H2 molecules better stabilize small hydrate cages, which are in greater number in sII crystallographic structure11 (see below for a more detailed description of the type and number of cages in each structure).\nFundamental and applied research on hydrates has been motivated by several reasons.1,2,12,13 One of the most important applications of hydrates in the current environmental, energetic, and economic context is the use of hydrates of N2, H2 and their mixtures, and in combination with THF, as strategic materials for gas transportation and storage.14\u201317 This represents an alternative to the currently used metal hydrides, whose development has not been implemented yet due to factors such as incomplete characterization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of these new storage media. The use of hydrates in this application would represent a reduction in raw material costs, with similar volumetric storage performance. To this end, it is necessary to have an accurate and precise understanding of the thermodynamics, with particular emphasis on phase equilibria, and also of the kinetics of the formation and growth of these hydrates.\nIt is clear from the previous discussion that the N2 hydrate is a strategic material from both a practical and industrial point of view. In addition, the study of N2 hydrates is also relevant from a theoretical perspective due to its crystallographic structure. The N2 hydrate exhibits sII structure formed from 136 water molecules distributed in 16 D (pentagonal dodecahedron or 512) cages and 8 H (hexakaidecahedron or 51264) cages. Assuming single full occupancy, the sII unit cell has 24 additional N2 molecules. Interestingly, although sI and sII hydrate structures are very different, their stoichiometry is very similar. Hydrates with sI structure have 1 guest molecule (CO2 or CH4 for example) per 5.75 water molecules in the unit cell (or 8 guest molecules per 46 water molecules, i.e., 46/8 = 5.75) and hydrates with sII structure has 1 guest molecule (N2) per 5.67 water molecules in the unit cell, approximately (or 24 N2 molecules per 136 water molecules, i.e., 136/24 \u2248 5.67). Note that in the sII structure, 66.7% of the cages are D cages, whereas only 25% are D cages in the sI structure. Due to this and the reasons previously explained, N2 hydrate is one of the few hydrates to form a sII crystallographic structure with a small guest as N2 that is able to exhibit multiple occupancy in their cages. In this work, we concentrate on N2 hydrates from a molecular perspective and perform molecular simulations to study the dissociation line of this hydrate and one of the key parameters that controls its nucleation, \u0394\u03bcN, the driving force for nucleation.18\u201321\nThe dissociation line of N2 hydrates has been determined experimentally by several authors.22\u201326 In addition, it is also possible to describe theoretically the phase equilibria of the hydrate using the van der Waals and Platteeuw (vdW and P) formalism,27,28 in combination with an equation of state.29 From the point of view of molecular simulation, several authors have studied a few properties of the N2 hydrate, including thermodynamic stability of the hydrate under the perspective of single/double cage occupancy using Monte Carlo30\u201334 and molecular dynamics simulations.4\u20136 However, none of the previous works are devoted to determining the three-phase line of the N2 hydrate. Particularly interesting for the present study is the work of Yi et al.16 In this paper, the authors use the well-known\nTIP4P/2005 model for water35 and the 2CLJQ model for N2 presented in the work of Vrabec et al.36 to determine the dissociation line of the N2 hydrate and to investigate the pressure influence on hydrate growth. Particularly, they have checked that the amount of cages occupied by two N2 molecules (double occupancy of the large cages of the hydrate) is increased when the pressure is very high, above 1000 bar. Although the TIP4P/2005 model is one of the most accurate and widely used rigid nonpolarizable water model in the literature, it is not particularly suited to deal with solid phases. In these cases, the also well-known TIP4P/Ice water model is preferable since it predicts very accurately the melting point of water in a wide range of pressures.37 This is also corroborated by a nice paper of Conde and Vega in which the authors show that it is necessary to develop a good model of water for accurately describing the melting temperature of ice Ih in order to make good predictions of dissociation temperatures of hydrates.38\nThe usual methodology to calculate dissociation lines of hydrates from molecular simulations, based on the original ideas of Ladd and Woodcock proposed in the 1970s, is the well-known direct coexistence technique.39 Conde and Vega published the first paper in which the technique was used to determine the three-phase coexistence line of CH4 methane.38,40 From that paper, several authors have determined the dissociation line of several hydrates using the same approach,41\u201347 including the authors of the work of Yi et al.16 that have determined the dissociation line of N2. However, in this work we propose to use a new and alternative technique, the socalled solubility method, introduced by some of us to determine the dissociation temperature, at 400 bar, of CH4 and CO2 hydrates.48,49 Is it possible to use the solubility method for hydrates that exhibit sII crystallographic structure? The method is based on the calculation of the solubility of the guest, in this case, N2, in an aqueous solution in equilibrium via planar interfaces with the N2-rich liquid phase and with the hydrate. In the first case, the molar fraction of N2 (when it is in contact with the N2 phase) is a decreasing function of temperature. In the second case, the molar fraction of N2 (when it is in contact with the hydrate phase) is an increasing function of temperature. Consequently, both curves intersect, at a given pressure, and this allows to determine the T3 of the hydrate. A schematic representation of the solubility method has been represented in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the solubility curves of N2 in the aqueous phase, as functions of temperature, are calculated when it is in contact with a N2-rich liquid phase and a hydrate phase via planar interfaces. The temperature at which both curves cross is the point at which the aqueous, hydrate, and N2-rich liquid phases are in equilibrium, i.e., the so-called T3 at the corresponding pressure.\nThe solubility method is a very interesting and clean way to calculate the dissociation temperatures of hydrates. However, determination of the two solubility curves is also important in the context of nucleation of N2 hydrates. The first solubility curve (Lw\u2013LN2 ) corresponds to the thermodynamic states at which hydrates are formed at experimental conditions when both phases are in equilibrium via a planar interface. The second solubility curve (H\u2013LN2 ) is also key for determining the driving force for the nucleation of hydrates using a new and alternative route presented by some of us in a previous work.49 From this information, in this work, we also propose to evaluate the driving force for the nucleation of N2 hydrates considering the hydrate formation as a chemical reaction in which\nJ.

According to these studies, the change in chemical potential of this reaction can be identified as \u0394\u03bcN, the driving force for nucleation. We propose to use two different thermodynamic routes,48,49 at three different pressures, to estimate the driving force for the nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits sII crystallographic structure. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time the driving force for the nucleation of N2 hydrate is calculated from computer simulation.\nTo answer the questions posed earlier on the possibility of determining the dissociation line from the solubility method and the driving force for nucleation using route 1 and dissociation route of the N2 hydrate, a clathrate exhibiting the sII crystallographic structure, we follow here the simplest strategy taking into account the complexity of N2 hydrates. We assume that both cages of the hydrate, D and H cages, are fully occupied. In addition to that, we only consider single-cage occupancy. According to the literature, this is a good approximation at low pressures and can be considered a first approach to determine the dissociation line and driving force for the nucleation of N2. A more detailed study of how occupancy affects these properties is beyond the scope of this preliminary study and will be the subject of a future work.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the models, simulation details, and methodology used in this work. The results obtained, as well as their discussion, are described in Sec. III. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. IV."

Some of the simulations are performed using the standard Berthelot combining rule with \u03beON = 1.0. We also perform simulations using Eq. (1) with an optimized value of \u03beON. As we will see later in Sec. III, this allows to accurately describe the three-phase coexistence line of the N2 hydrate along a wide range of pressures. To obtain the optimal value of unlike interaction parameters between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of water and nitrogen molecules, respectively, we try different values of the combining parameter \u03beON, including 1.00, 1.10, and 1.15. With these values, we determine the solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase when in contact with the N2-rich liquid phase and the hydrate. From this information, we obtain the values of the dissociation temperature, T3, at 500 bar. We then compare the predictions made by the model and the experimental data from the literature, finding that \u03beON = 1.15 provides the best description of T3 at this pressure. Then, we use this parameter to predict the value of T3 of the hydrate at different pressures. It is interesting to note that we observe that an increase of 0.05 units in the combining parameter \u03beON produces an increment in the T3 value by 5 K approximately.\nWe use a Verlet leapfrog52 algorithm with a time step of 2 fs to solve the Newton\u2019s equations of motion. We also use the Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat53 and the Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat,54 with a time constant of 2 ps, to ensure that simulations are performed at constant temperate and pressure. In all cases, we use a cutoff of 1.0 nm for the Coulombic and dispersive interactions. The Fourier term of the Ewald sums is evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method.55 The width of the mesh is 0.1 nm with a relative tolerance of 10\u22125.\nWe simulate liquid\u2013liquid (Lw\u2013LN2 ) and hydrate\u2013liquid (H\u2013Lw) two-phase equilibria to determine the three-phase coexistence line of the N2 hydrate according to the solubility method.48,49 We also perform bulk simulations to calculate the driving force for the nucleation of this hydrate at different conditions of pressure and supercooling. For systems that exhibit Lw\u2013LN2 equilibria, the simulations are carried out in the NPz\ud835\udc9cT ensemble, in which only Lz , the side of the simulation box perpendicular to the Lw\u2013LN2 planar interface, is varied. In the case of systems that exhibit H\u2013Lw equilibria, we perform simulations in the anisotropic NPT ensemble in which each side of the simulation box is allowed to fluctuate independently to keep the pressure constant. This ensures that the solid hydrate structure is equilibrated without stress. Finally, simulations of bulk systems of N2, water, and hydrate are performed in the isotropic NPT ensemble, i.e., the sides of the simulation box fluctuate isotropically to keep the pressure constant.\nJ.

            "text": "We determine the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution, as a function of temperature, when it is in contact with N2-rich liquid phase via a planar interface. In particular, we consider three different pressures: 500, 1000, and 1500 bar. To this end, we prepare an initial simulation box consisting of two fluid phases: a N2-rich liquid phase formed of 1223 guest molecules and a water phase with 2800 water molecules. Both simulation boxes are put in contact via a planar interface according to the direct coexistence simulation technique. Arbitrarily we choose the z-axis to be perpendicular to the planar interface and the xy plane parallel to the interface. The total dimensions of the initial simulation box are Lx = Ly = 3.8 nm and Lz \u2243 15 nm.\nSince we are dealing with an inhomogeneous system in which a planar interface exists perpendicular to the z-axis, simulations are performed in the NPz\ud835\udc9cT ensemble. According to the rule phase, this ensures that the system evolves to the equilibrium state at fixed temperature and pressure during the simulations. Note that in the NPz\ud835\udc9cT ensemble, only the length of the simulation box along the z-axis is allowed to vary, keeping the interfacial area \ud835\udc9c = Lx \u00d7 Ly constant along the simulation. In other words, the z component of the pressure tensor (perpendicular to the interface) is constant and equal to the equilibrium pressure. Due to the low solubility of N2 in water, long simulation times are required in order to calculate the solubility of this compound in the aqueous solution. In particular, the simulations run during 800 ns. We consider an equilibration period of 200 ns, followed by a production period of 600 ns during which the corresponding magnitudes are calculated and accumulated.\nIn order to calculate the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution, we determine the density profiles of N2 and water of the system at the three selected pressures and several temperatures. As we have previously mentioned, we use two different values of the \u03beON parameter, the deviation of \u03b5ON from the Berthelot rule. Particularly, we consider \u03b5ON = 1.0 and 1.15. Figure 2 shows the density profiles at the studied conditions when \u03beON = 1.15. For better visualization and for avoiding repetition, only one of the two interfaces has been represented in Fig. 2. The left side corresponds to the aqueous phase, which initially was a pure water phase, and the right side to the N2-rich liquid phase. Note that due to the extremely low solubility of water in the N2-rich liquid phase, this phase can be considered a pure N2 liquid phase. Density profiles have been obtained by dividing the simulation box into 200 slabs perpendicular to the z direction along which the system exhibits a planar Lw\u2013LN2\nFIG. 2. Simulated equilibrium density profiles, \u03c1(z), across the Lw\u2013LN2 interface of N2 (continuous curves) and water (dashed curves) as obtained from MD NPz\ud835\udc9cT simulations, using \u03beON = 1.15, at 500 (top), 1000 (middle), and 1500 bar (bottom) and different temperatures (see legends).\ninterface. The position of the center of mass of the molecules is assigned to each slab and the density profiles are obtained from mass balance considerations.\nSince the density profiles of both mixture components exhibit the same qualitative behavior, we simultaneously analyze the behavior of the density profiles at the three pressures. We first consider the behavior of the density profile of water along the interface (dashed curves). The density of water in the aqueous phase (left side of the profile) increases when the temperature is increased. In the N2 liquid phase (right side of the profile), the density of water is practically zero in all cases. As we have already mentioned, this indicates that the solubility of water in the N2 liquid phase can be considered\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-4\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\nnegligible. In other words, the Lw\u2013LN2 phase behavior of the water + N2 mixture can be described as a saturated aqueous solution of N2 in contact with a pure N2 liquid phase at different temperatures and pressures. It is interesting to note that there exists preferential adsorption of water at the interface. This adsorption is observed in all cases but it decreases when the pressure is increased and/or when the temperature is increased.\nWe now focus on the behavior of the density profiles of N2 at the interface (continuous curves). As can be observed, the density of N2 in the aqueous phase decreases when the temperature is increased. This is the expected behavior since the solubility of gases in water increases when temperature is decreased. Moreover, preferential desorption can be observed in the aqueous solution phase near the interface in all cases. This is in agreement with the preferential adsorption of water explained in the previous paragraph. As previously shown, preferential desorption decreases when pressure and/or temperature are increased. There is also preferential adsorption of N2 near the interface but on the side corresponding to the N2 liquid phase. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the adsorption decreases when the pressure and/or the temperature are/is increased. Finally, it is interesting to point out that the density of the N2 liquid phase decreases when the temperature is increased and/or when the pressure is decreased. Although the results presented in Fig. 2 correspond only to \u03beON = 1.15, we have also obtained the same qualitative results in the case where \u03beON = 1.0.\nFrom the analysis of density profiles, it is possible to calculate the equilibrium molar fraction of N2 in the aqueous solution phase when the initial pure water and pure N2 phases are put in contact via a planar interface. The equilibrium density of water and N2 in the aqueous solution phase can be easily obtained by averaging the density of each component over the aqueous region. At this point, it is important to remark that the region chosen has to be far enough from the interface in order to accurately calculate the bulk densities in the aqueous solution region. The results obtained in this work for both values of \u03beON, 1.0 and 1.15, at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar and at several temperatures are shown in Fig. 3.\nAccording to Fig. 3, the solubility of N2 in water decreases when the temperature is increased, at a given pressure. Note that the same qualitative behavior is obtained from both values of \u03beON. In addition to this, at a given temperature, the solubility of N2 in water increases when the pressure is increased. Note that this is the expected behavior of the solubility of a gas in an aqueous phase. It is especially interesting to discuss the effect of \u03beON on the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution. As can be seen, the solubility of N2 in water is small. An increment in the value of \u03beON provokes an increment in the solubility. The differences in solubility for different values of \u03beON become larger when the temperature is decreased and the pressure is increased. In particular, at the lowest common temperature of 260 K, the solubility of N2 becomes 2, 2.5, and 3 times higher, at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, respectively, when \u03beON is increased from 1.0 to 1.15. On the other hand, at the highest common temperature of 290 K, the solubility becomes 1.9, 2, and 2.1 times higher, at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, respectively. Notice that the effect of temperature on solubility is larger when the pressure and \u03beON are increased. The solubility results obtained in this work have been compared with experimental data taken from the literature56 (see Fig. 3). As far as the authors know, at the conditions\nFIG. 3.

As can be seen, simulation results obtained when \u03beON = 1.0 and 1.15 are located between the experimental data, i.e., when \u03beON = 1.0, experimental data are slightly underestimated. In contrast, when \u03beON = 1.15, the experimental data are slightly overestimated. In both cases, there is agreement between experimental data and simulation results."

Results corresponding to the Lw\u2013LN2 interfacial tension of the water + N2 binary mixture, at several pressures and temperatures, are shown in Fig. 4. Lw\u2013LN2 interfacial tensions have been obtained by averaging the diagonal components of the pressure tensor over the last 600 ns without taking into account the first 200 ns of equilibration. The final 600 ns have then been divided into 10 independent blocks of 60 ns each, and the statistical error has been obtained as standard deviation of the average.62\nInterfacial tension is an extremely sensible property that strongly depends on the molecular details of the model used. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 4, where the results for the interfacial tension are clearly different for the two values of \u03beON considered\nJ. Chem.

An increment of \u03beON from 1.0 to 1.15 provokes a reduction of \u03b3 by 9%, approximately. This is true for all the thermodynamic conditions studied in this work. However, as can be seen, the Lw\u2013LN2 interfacial tension of the mixture exhibits the same qualitative \u03b3 behavior for both values of \u03beON, as a function of temperature. Particularly, at fixed pressure, \u03b3 decreases when the temperature is increased. However, this dependency on the temperature becomes smaller when the pressure is increased. At 1500 bar, \u03b3 is practically constant at all temperatures. In contrast, at fixed temperature, \u03b3 increases when the pressure is reduced.\nWe have also included experimental data taken from the literature of the interfacial tension of the water + N2 binary mixture at the same pressures considered in this work.63 Unfortunately, there only exist data at 298 K. As can be seen in Fig. 4, predictions obtained using \u03beON = 1.0 overestimate the experimental values at all pressures. However, when \u03beON = 1.15 the agreement between simulation results and experimental data is improved, giving an excellent description of \u03b3 at 1000 and 1500 bar. At 500 bar, the simulation result slightly underestimates the experimental data by 3 mN/m, approximately. Note also that the variation of interfacial tension with pressure, at constant temperature, is softer when \u03beON = 1.0 than when \u03beON = 1.15. This results in a better description of \u03b3 as a function of pressure at 298 K, as it has been already shown."

            "text": "We have also determined the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution phase in contact with the N2 hydrate phase via a planar interface at the same pressures considered in Sec. III A, i.e., 500, 1000, and 1500 bar. The initial simulation box is prepared in the same way for the three pressures. First, the N2 hydrate phase is built up by replicating a unit cell of the crystallographic sII structure twice in each spatial direction, forming a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 unit cell of the solid structure. We also take explicitly into account that hydrates are\nproton-disordered structures. To obtain this arrangement, hydrogen atoms are placed using the algorithm proposed in the work of Buch et al.64 This allows to generate solid configurations satisfying the Bernal\u2013Fowler rules,65 with zero (or at least negligible) dipole moment. The unit cell of a sII hydrate has 136 molecules of water and 24 cages. Here, we will assume that the hydrate exhibits single occupancy, i.e., only one N2 molecule per cage. According to this, the total hydrate box contains 1088 molecules of water and 192 molecules of N2. This hydrate box, with one N2 molecule per cage, is equilibrated during 20 ns at each pressure in the NPT ensemble, allowing the system to independently change the dimensions of the simulation box by using an anisotropic barostat. This is necessary in order to avoid any stress in the solid structure. When the N2 hydrate is equilibrated, a pure water phase formed from 2176 molecules of water (double the number of water molecules than in the hydrate structure) is added to the hydrate phase along the z direction. The final simulation box has 3264 molecules of water and 192 molecules of N2. The dimensions of this simulation box used to calculate the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution are Lx = Ly \u2248 3.5 nm and Lz \u2248 9 nm. We recall that we use the same N2 hydrate\u2013water initial simulation box for the three pressures.\nAt this point, it is important to remark that the initial hydrate\u2013water simulation box could be prepared in a different way. Particularly, it is possible to have a hydrate phase in contact, via a planar interface, with an aqueous solution with a few guest molecules dissolved in that phase. This is how we prepared simulation boxes of methane and CO2 hydrates in contact with an aqueous solution in our previous works.48,49 The aim of this approach was twofold: (1) to start the simulations with an initial aqueous phase in which the composition of the guest is close to the equilibrium one when it is in contact with the hydrate phase and (2) to avoid a situation where a considerable part of the hydrate melts to reach the equilibrium liberating guest molecules to the aqueous phase. However, in the current case (N2 hydrate), the solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase is low enough and it is possible to use a simulation box with pure water in contact with the N2 hydrate phase. When some cages of the hydrate melt, the N2 liberated to the aqueous phase rapidly saturates the system. According to this, we do not include N2 molecules in the initial water phase. Since the initial aqueous phase is pure water, the hydrate must melt in order to release N2 into the aqueous phase until it reaches equilibrium. Since the hydrate phase only can melt to reach the equilibrium, there is no growth process in which a double spontaneous occupancy could take place. Following this procedure, we can ensure that the solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase is the exact solubility reached when a hydrate phase with single occupancy is in contact with an aqueous phase. In order to study the effect of occupancy on the solubility, it would be necessary to use a multipleoccupied hydrate phase, but this is beyond the scope of the current work.\nThe simulations are performed in the NPT ensemble with an anisotropic barostat, at the corresponding pressure, to avoid any stress on the hydrate structure. The simulations run for 800 ns, the first 200 ns for the equilibration of the interface. This first part is not taken into account for analysis of the results. The density profiles are then obtained from the last 600 ns following the same procedure as in Sec. III A. Density profiles are obtained by dividing the simulation box into 200 slabs perpendicular to the z direction. The center\nJ. Chem.

In order to avoid repetition, only one of the interfaces is presented. The behavior observed for the three studied pressures, 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, and for both values of \u03beON, 1.0 and 1.15, is qualitatively the same. As happens with the Lw\u2013LN2 density profiles, the density profiles at the three studied pressures exhibit the same qualitative behavior. We first focus on water density (dashed curves). The density of water in the aqueous phase (left side of the density profiles) decreases when the temperature is increased. The density profiles of water in the hydrate phase (right side of the profiles) show the usual oscillations expected for a solid phase in which the molecules exhibit long-range translational\norder. Particularly, the peaks observed for the density of water correspond to the equilibrium crystallographic positions occupied by the molecules in the hydrate structure. We also analyze the density profiles of N2 (continuous curves). They show the excepted behavior, in agreement with the density profiles of N2. According to the results, the density of N2 in the aqueous phase increases as the temperature is increased.\nSimilar to the case of the Lw\u2013LN2 density profiles, from the analysis of H\u2013Lw density profiles it is possible to calculate the solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase when it is in contact with the hydrate phase via a planar interface. As can be observed in Fig. 6, the solubility of N2 increases when the temperature is increased along the isobar solubility curve. In contrast, at constant temperature the solubility of N2 decreases when the pressure is increased. The qualitative behavior of N2 solubility curves is the same for both values of \u03beON, 1.0 and 1.15. However, as can be observed, an increment in the value of \u03beON provokes a reduction of the N2 solubility value at all the studied conditions of temperature and pressure."

At this point, it is important to remark that the three-phase coexistence line, also commonly called the dissociation line of the hydrate, corresponds to the thermodynamic states at temperatures and pressures at which the N2-rich liquid phase, the aqueous solution, and the hydrate phase coexist in equilibrium (H \u2212 Lw \u2212 LN2). This equilibrium of three phases can also be viewed as two simultaneous two-phase equilibria, hydrate\u2013aqueous solution equilibrium (H\u2013Lw) and aqueous solution\u2013N2-rich liquid equilibrium (Lw \u2212 LN2). As has been shown in Secs. III A and III B, the solubility of N2 in both equilibria depends on the temperature (at fixed pressure). At T3, the aqueous solution\nJ. Chem.

In other words, if the isobaric solubility curves of N2 in the aqueous phase when it is in contact with the N2-rich liquid phase and with the hydrate phase are plotted in the same graph, both curves must cross at T3, the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at a given pressure. Note that this methodology has been successfully applied for the determination of T3 of methane and carbon dioxide hydrates by some of us.48,49\nFigure 7 shows the solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase from the Lw \u2212 LN2 and H\u2013Lw equilibria at the three pressures studied in this work. The results obtained for \u03beON = 1.0 and 1.15 at each pressure have been represented together in order to analyze the effect of modifying the Berthelot rule. As can be seen, in the three cases the solubility curves follow the same qualitative behavior: The solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase when it is in contact with the N2-rich liquid phase decreases with temperature, as it happens with the solubility of most gases in water; in contrast, the solubility of N2 when it is contact with the hydrate phase increases with temperature. Note that this behavior with temperature is similar to that observed when a solid is dissolved in water.\nWe first concentrate on the results obtained at 500 bar. The experimental value of T3 taken from the literature at this pressure is 284.5 K.23,25 The values obtained in this work using \u03beON = 1.0 and 1.15 are 271(2) and 286(2) K, respectively. As can be seen, the value of T3 obtained using \u03beON = 1.0 clearly underestimates the T3 value by 4.8%. However, it is important to remark that the results obtained when (\u03beON = 1.0) are pure predictions. This means that the parameters that describe the unlike interactions between the water and nitrogen models have been obtained from the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule without any fitting. A difference of just 4.8% is still a good result taking into account the system complexities. The use of a larger value of \u03beON, making the unlike interactions with N2 and water more favorable, helps predict the T3 value of the system better. Particularly, the agreement between the experimental value and the simulation result when \u03beON = 1.15 is excellent, since the predicted values are inside the uncertainty (286 \u00b1 2 K).\nWe now turn to the results obtained at 1000 bar using \u03beON = 1.0 and 1.15. The T3 values obtained for these values unlike dispersive interactions are 279(2) and 293(2) K, respectively. The experimental value of T3 at 1000 bar taken from the literature is 292 K.23,25 As it happens at 500 bar, the computer simulation predictions obtained using \u03beON = 1.15 are in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 292 K and inside the error bar. As it also occurred with the previous pressure, predictions using the original Berthelot rule (\u03beON = 1.0) slightly underestimate the experimental T3 value (by 4.5%).\nFinally, the results obtained at 1500 bar follow the expected behavior observed at 500 and 1000 bar. Particularly, our simulation results indicate that the dissociation temperature of the N2 hydrate at this pressure using \u03beON = 1.15 is 298(2) K. Note that this value is also in excellent agreement with the experimental value of the dissociation temperature at this pressure, 296 K.23,25 Note that using the \u03beON = 1.0 value for unlike dispersive interactions, we obtain the value T3 = 285(2) K, which only underestimates the experimental value by 3.8%.\nFIG. 7.

The symbols and colors are the same as those in Figs. 3 and 6. The crossing of the each pair of curves (continuous and dashed) determines the dissociation temperature of the hydrate, T3, at the corresponding pressure. The vertical black lines correspond to the experimental T3 values taken from the literature.23,25 In all cases, the curves are included as guide to the eye.\nFigure 8 summarizes one of the most important results obtained in this work, the PT projection of the dissociation line for N2 hydrate as obtained from molecular simulation. We also include experimental data taken from the literature22\u201326 to assess the simulation results\u2019 accuracy. As can be seen, the results obtained using the original Berthelot rule \u03beON = 1.0 (purple diamonds) only provide a qualitative description of the three-phase line of the hydrate, systematically underestimating the dissociation line. A more accurate description of the dissociation line is obtained if the modified\nJ. Chem.

It is important to take into account the previous work of Yi et al.,16 in which the authors have already studied the dissociation line of the N2 hydrate by combining molecular dynamics simulations and the direct coexistence technique (red squares). They used different models for water and N2. Particularly, they used the TIP4P/2005 model for water molecules, more suitable to describe pure water and aqueous solutions in the absence of solid phases,35 and a 2CLJQ model for N2 molecules.36 As we have already mentioned in the Introduction, their results systematically underestimate the experimental data by 4 K at pressures above 500 bar. Particularly, the simulation predictions of Yi and co-workers are slightly outside the error bar. However, as the authors of the work of Yi et al. claim,16 the equilibrium curve they obtained is found to be generally parallel to that obtained from experiments, suggesting that the models used by these authors are able to qualitatively predict the three-phase coexistence behavior of the system.\nTo recap, all the predictions obtained in this work at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar using the Berthelot rule without the use of a modified unlike intermolecular dispersive energy provide good agreement with experimental data taken from the literature. Particularly, all deviations underestimate the experimental T3 values by less than 4.8%. However, as we have already mentioned, it is possible to improve the simulation results using a modified Berthelot rule for the unlike dispersive interactions. This allows to predict, within the uncertainty of the simulations, the dissociation line of the N2 hydrate in the whole range of pressures considered in this study.\nAs we have already mentioned, this is the first work in which the solubility method is used to obtain the T3 value of a hydrate that exhibits type sII crystallographic structure. According to this, we have only considered single occupancy and this is why we have not studied pressures above 1500 bar. Note that, according to the literature, multiple occupancy is expected at high pressures. It would be really interesting to consider the effect of multiple occupancy on\nthe dissociation line of the hydrate. However, this is not a simple task. Multiple occupancy studies in hydrate systems are complicated to be undertaken by simulation. Recently, the authors of the work of Michalis et al.17 have determined the dissociation line of H2 hydrates at several pressures but only considering single occupancy. According to the authors, it is complicated to stabilize the hydrate structure when a multiple occupancy configuration is used. In fact, they could not stabilize the corresponding simulation boxes, which are similar to those used in this work since H2 hydrates also exhibit type sII crystallographic structure. In a previous work of some of us,49 the effect of occupancy of CO2 hydrates was studied using the solubility method. According to these results, the effect of occupancy on the solubility of CO2 when in contact with a hydrate\u2014and, consequently, also on the T3 value of the CO2 hydrate\u2014is negligible. However, the effect of multiple occupancy on the driving force for nucleation is noticeable. We think the same conclusions can be extrapolated to the case of N2 but we also think more studies are required in order to understand the effect of multiple occupancies on the stability conditions of hydrates that exhibit type sII crystallographic structure. However, this is beyond the scope of this work."

            "text": "At the dissociation line of the hydrate, the N2 liquid phase, the hydrate, and the aqueous solution are in equilibrium at a temperature T3 (at a given pressure). Two possible scenarios can arise at this fixed pressure if temperature changes. If T < T3, the hydrate is the most stable phase and it will grow until extinguishing one of the components (water or N2) of the other two phases. The non-extinguished component will form a second phase in equilibrium with the hydrate. In contrast, if T > T3, the liquid phases are more stable than the hydrate. As a consequence, the hydrate melts in two immiscible liquid phases in equilibrium (aqueous solution and N2-rich liquid). However, as we have previously shown, it is possible to have two liquids in equilibrium via a planar interface, the aqueous solution and the N2 liquid phase, at temperatures below the dissociation temperature of the hydrate at a given pressure (T < T3). In this situation, the liquid phases are metastable compared with the hydrate phase. How can the liquid phases exist if they are thermodynamically less stable than the hydrate?\nThe explanation is that the formation of hydrate from the aqueous solution of N2 is an activated process. According to Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT),66 the solid phase begins with the formation of a small cluster of \u201csolid\u201d molecules immersed in the liquid. The formation of this cluster is only possible if the system can break through a free energy barrier, which depends on the hydrate\u2013aqueous solution interfacial free energy and the difference in chemical potential between the hydrate and the aqueous solution, usually known as the driving force for nucleation \u0394\u03bcN. According to the CNT, the free energy barrier becomes smaller when the temperature is below T3 (supercooling conditions) and when the concentration of N2 in the aqueous phase is increased (supersaturated conditions). In both cases, the driving force for nucleation increases (the difference in chemical potential becomes more negative). Obviously, this causes the liquid phases to become less stable at the same time that the hydrate phase becomes more stable. This is also corroborated by an inspection of Fig. 3: When T is reduced,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-9\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\nthe solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase is increased, reducing the stability of the liquid phases and increasing the stability of the hydrate phase.\nAccording to the literature,19,48,49 the formation of a hydrate in an aqueous solution can be viewed as a chemical reaction at constant T and P,\nN2(aq, xN2) + 5.67 H2O(aq, xN2)\u2192 [N2(H2O)5.67]H. (3)\nNote that the compound [N2(H2O)5.67]H is the \u201chydrate\u201d and we call one \u201cmolecule\u201d of the hydrate in the solid the molecule [N2(H2O)5.67]. The factor 5.67 arises because of the stoichiometry of the hydrate structure (the hydrate unit cell is built by 136 molecules of water and 24 molecules of N2 or equivalently by 136/24 \u2248 5.67 molecules of water per each molecule of N2). Since we perform simulations at three different pressures, all quantities depend not only on temperature but also on pressure. Due to this, we keep in our notation the explicit dependency on T and P. In this work, we assume that the occupancy is one molecule of N2 in each cage of the hydrate, i.e., full single occupancy. Following the previous works of Grabowska et al.67 and Algaba et al.,49 the chemical potential of a \u201cmolecule\u201d of hydrate, as a function of T and P, is given by\n\u03bcHH(P, T) = \u03bcHN2(P, T) + 5.67 \u03bc H H2O(P, T), (4)\nwhere \u03bcHN2(P, T) and \u03bc H H2O(P, T) are the chemical potentials of N2 and water in the hydrate phase, respectively. Note that since we are assuming that the hydrate is fully occupied, the chemical potential of the hydrate does not depend on composition. Using Eq. (4), the driving force for nucleation can be written as19,48,49\n\u0394\u03bcN(P, T, xN2) = \u03bc H H(P, T) \u2212 \u03bcaqN2(P, T, xN2) \u2212 5.67 \u03bc aq H2O(P, T, xN2),\n(5)\nwhere \u03bcHH(P, T) is the chemical potential of the hydrate defined in Eq. (4), \u03bcaqN2(P, T, xN2) is the chemical potential of N2 in the aqueous phase, and \u03bcaqH2O(P, T, xN2) is the chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase. Note that we have expressed both chemical potentials in the aqueous solution as functions of xN2 since the composition of water is fully determined as we are dealing with a two-component system and xH2O = 1 \u2212 xN2 .\nAt this point, it is important to remark that \u0394\u03bcN can be calculated at any value of P, T, and xN2 . However, it is particularly interesting to investigate the behavior of \u0394\u03bcN along the Lw \u2212 LN2 coexistence curve, conditions at which nucleation experiments are performed.48,49 Notice that the Lw \u2212 LN2 isobar coexistence curves at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar have been previously obtained in this work. According to this, xN2 is a function of P and T. Following the notation used by some of us in previous works,48,49 the driving force for nucleation at experimental conditions can be written as\n\u0394\u03bcECN (P, T) = \u03bcHH(P, T) \u2212 \u03bcaqN2(P, T, x eq N2(P, T))\n\u2212 5.67 \u03bcaqH2O(P, T, x eq N2(P, T)). (6)\nNote that at T3, all the chemical potentials are equal since all the phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium and \u0394\u03bcECN = 0. In addition to this, since we are interested in changes in chemical potentials and not in individual values, we can set to zero the chemical potential of\nN2, water, and hydrate at T3 for all pressure values considered in this work.\nIn the following sections, we present two different routes for the calculation of \u0394\u03bcECN (P, T). These routes have been used by some of us in previous works to determine the driving force for nucleation of methane and carbon dioxide hydrates under experimental conditions.48,49,66 Moreover, it is important to point out that all the driving force results obtained in this work have been obtained when \u03beON = 1.15."

We first concentrate on the calculation of the chemical potential of N2 in the aqueous phase. Along the Lw \u2212 LN2 solubility curve (at fixed pressure), the two liquid phases, the aqueous solution phase and N2-rich liquid phase, coexist in equilibrium. We have already checked that the solubility of water in the N2-rich liquid phase is negligible (see Fig. 2). According to this, we can assume that this phase is formed only from pure N2. Since both phases are in equilibrium, the chemical potential of N2 in the aqueous phase, \u03bcaqN2(P, T, x aq N2), and in the pure N2 phase, \u03bcN2(P, T), should be the same. Consequently, the chemical potential of N2 in the aqueous phase can be expressed as\n\u03bcaqN2(P, T, x aq N2) \u2248 \u03bc aq N2(P, T, x aq N2 \u2248 1) \u2248 \u03bcN2(P, T), (7)\nwhere \u03bcN2(P, T) represents the chemical potential of pure N2 at temperature T and pressure P. It is possible to obtain the value of \u03bcN2(P, T) along an isobar (constant pressure) from the knowledge of enthalpy of pure N2, hN2(P, T), in the N2 phase via the well-known Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz thermodynamic relation for pure systems,\n(\u2202(\u03bcN2(P, T)/T) \u2202T\n) P,NN2 = \u2212hN2(P, T) T2 . (8)\nNote that the derivative of the chemical potential of pure N2 is performed at constant pressure and number of molecules. Finally, it is possible to calculate the variation of \u03bcN2(P, T) from its value at T3 by integrating Eq. (8) at constant pressure P,\n\u03bcaqN2(P, T, x aq N2) \u2248 \u03bcN2(P, T) kBT = \u03bcN2(P, T3) kBT3 \u2212 \u222b T T3 hN2(P, T\u2032) kBT\u20322 dT\u2032.\n(9) Since \u03bcN2(P, T3) = 0, Eq. (9) can be written as\n\u03bcaqN2(P, T, x aq N2) \u2248 \u03bcN2(P, T) kBT = \u2212\u222b T T3 hN2(P, T\u2032) kBT\u20322 dT\u2032. (10)\nTo evaluate hN2(P, T), we use a simulation box with 1000 molecules of N2. We perform MD simulations at constant temperature and pressure in the isothermal\u2013isobaric or NPT ensemble. We use an isotropic Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat to fix the pressure that allows to modify the volume isotropically. At each pressure, 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, we consider several temperatures, from 250 to 290 K at 500 bar, from 255 to 295 K at 1000 bar, and from 260 to 300 K at 1500 bar. The simulation box size, Lx = Ly = Lz = L, varies\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-10\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\nfrom L = 4.85 to 4.11 nm depending on T and P. The simulations are run for 100 ns. The first 20 ns are taken as the equilibration time, and only the last 80 ns are used to evaluate hN2(P, T).\nAs in the case of the calculation of the chemical potential of N2, it is possible to calculate the chemical potential of the N2 hydrate integrating the corresponding Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz thermodynamic expression, at constant pressure, as follows:\n\u03bcHH(P, T) kBT = \u2212\u222b T T3 hHH(P, T\u2032) kBT\u20322 dT\u2032. (11)\nIt is important to recall that integration of Eq. (11) is performed at constant pressure since we evaluate the chemical potential along a given isobar. Here, hHH(P, T\u2032) represents the enthalpy of the hydrate at pressure P and temperature T\u2032. Since the stoichiometry of the hydrate is fixed and we are assuming full occupancy, the hydrate can be considered a pure compound. According to this, the values of hHH needed to calculate the chemical potential are obtained in the same way as those corresponding to the N2 liquid phase: We perform MD simulations of N2 hydrate in the isothermal\u2013isobaric or NPT ensemble. The simulation box is formed by replicating the unit cell of the N2 hydrate twice in each space direction obtaining a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 configuration. This corresponds to a simulation box that contains 1088 molecules of water and 192 molecules of N2. Similarly, the pressure is fixed using the isotropic Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat since the sII structure of the N2 hydrate exhibits cubic symmetry. The simulations are performed at the same pressures and temperatures as those corresponding to pure N2. In this case, the simulation box size is Lx = Ly = Lz \u2248 3.46 nm. According to Eq. (3), hHH(P, T\u2032) is obtained by dividing the total enthalpy of the simulation by the number of molecules of N2 or the number of hydrate cages since we are assuming full but single occupancy per cage. The simulations are also run for 100 ns. The first 20 ns are taken as the equilibration time, and only the last 80 ns are taken as the production period.\nThe chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase, \u03bcaqH2O, cannot be determined with the same strategy used to calculate \u03bcaqN2 and \u03bc H H. Unfortunately, an accurate prediction of the chemical potential of water critically depends on the solubility of N2 and this effect should be taken into account.48,49 To overcome this issue, here we follow the same approach introduced by some of us for the calculation of driving forces for the nucleation of methane and carbon dioxide hydrates.48,49\nAccordingly, \u03bcaqH2O is obtained in two steps. In the first step, we assume that the aqueous phase is formed from pure water since the solubility of N2 is very small and calculate the change in chemical potential of water in solution when the temperature varies from T3 to T. This can be done using the same procedure previously used for the calculation of chemical potential of N2 in the aqueous solution and the chemical potential of hydrate, i.e., calculating the molar enthalpy of pure water as a function of pressure and temperature, hH2O(P, T). To this end, we perform MD simulations in the isothermal\u2013isobaric or NPT ensemble using an isotropic Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat. The simulation box is formed from 1000 molecules of water. We perform simulations at the same thermodynamic conditions of T and P as in the case of pure liquid N2 and N2 hydrate. The simulation box size is Lx = Ly = Lz \u2248 3.08 nm. As in the previous cases, the simulations run for 100 ns\ntaking the last 80 ns as the production period. Note that the final change in chemical potential of pure water when the temperature varies from T3 and T (at constant pressure) can be easily obtained by integrating the corresponding Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz thermodynamic relation.\nIn the second step, we take approximately into account that the aqueous phase is not really a pure water phase. This is necessary since there is a change in composition when the temperature varies from T3 to T. Following the previous works of some of us,48,49 this second contribution to the chemical potential takes into account the change in aqueous composition when the temperature varies from T3, xeqN2(P, T3), to T, x eq N2(P, T), at constant pressure.\nThe chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase at T and P can be written as\n\u03bcaqH2O(P, T, xNeq2 ) \u2248 \u2212\u222b T\nT3 hH2O(P, T\u2032) kBT\u20322 dT\u2032 + [kBT ln{xeqH2O(P, T)}\n\u2212 kBT3 ln{xeqH2O(P, T3)}]. (12)\nWe recall here that xeqH2O is directly related to x eq N2 since we are dealing with a two-component system, i.e., xeqH2O = 1 \u2212 x eq N2 .\nFinally, the driving force for nucleation at experimental conditions for the N2 hydrate at T and P can be written combining Eqs. (6) and (10)\u2013(12) as\n\u0394\u03bcECN (P, T, xeqN2) kBT\n= \u2212\u222b T\nT3 hHH(P, T\u2032) \u2212 {hN2(P, T\u2032) + 5.67 hH2O(P, T\u2032)} kBT\u20322 dT\u2032\n\u2212 [kBT ln{xeqH2O(P, T)} \u2212 kBT3 ln{x eq H2O(P, T3)}]. (13)\nNote that the term hHH(P, T\u2032) \u2212 {hN2(P, T\u2032) + 5.67 hH2O(P, T\u2032)} inside the integral is minus the dissociation enthalpy as a function of P and T\u2032, hdissH (P, T\u2032).19 Moreover, it is important to remark that the term outside the integral, ln{xeqH2O(T)} \u2212 kBT3 ln{x eq H2O(T3)}, arises to take into account the change in chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase because of the change in composition. For further details, we refer the reader to our previous works.48,49\n2. \u0394\u03bcECN (T) via dissociation route According to our previous works,48,49 Eq. (13) can be simplified following three approximations: (1) hdissH does not change with the temperature; (2) its value is taken at T3; and (3) hdissH does not vary with the composition of N2 in the aqueous phase. The first and second approximations allow to take hdissH out of the integral with a constant value, hdissH (T3). The third approximation allows to eliminate the last term of Eq. (13). Using the three approximations, it is possible to obtain a simplified version of Eq. (13).\nThe chemical potential of water in the aqueous phase at T and P can be written as\n\u0394\u03bcECN (P, T) = kBT\u222b T\nT3 hdissH (P, T3) kBT\u20322 dT\u2032 \u2248 \u2212hdissH (P, T3)(1 \u2212 T T3 ).\n(14) To the best of our knowledge, Eq. (14) was presented for the first time by Kashchiev and Firoozabadi several years ago.19 Particularly,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-11\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\nthis equation corresponds to Eq. (31) of the work of these authors. Since the final expression for \u0394\u03bcECN is given in terms of hdissH , we call this expression the dissociation route of the driving force for nucleation.48,49 As we will see in Section III D 3, it can be considered a good approximation for the driving force for nucleation at small supercooling values.\n3. \u0394\u03bcECN (T) results We have obtained the driving force for nucleation of the N2 hydrate using route 1 and the dissociation route presented in Secs. III D 1 and III D 2. Figure 9 shows \u0394\u03bcECN , as a function of the supercooling \u0394T, using both routes. We have included the predictions for the three pressures studied in this work. As can be observed, \u0394\u03bcECN obtained from both routes exhibits the same qualitative behavior in the whole range of temperatures. Particularly, both routes agree very well at low supercooled temperatures, from \u2223\u0394T\u2223 = 0 to 10\u201315 K, approximately. However, when \u2223\u0394T\u2223 increases, deviations between both routes become larger. This is due to the approximations made in Eq. (14). For \u2223\u0394T\u2223 \u2272 15 K, the assumptions made do not have a significant effect on \u0394\u03bcECN (T) values. However, when the supercooling temperature is increased, the variations of hdissH and solubility of N2 in the aqueous phase with temperature become important, making the predictions for dissociation route less accurate. Although the route given by Eq. (14) is an easy and fast way to estimate \u0394\u03bcECN , we do not recommend it in general except for temperatures close to T3. This conclusion is in agreement with our previous findings in the case of the CO2 and CH2 hydrates.48,49\nIt is also interesting to analyze the effect of pressure on the driving force for nucleation of the N2 hydrate. As can be seen, \u0394\u03bcECN values at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar are very similar. The driving force for nucleation slightly becomes less negative as the pressure increases. This indicates that nucleation is favored when the pressure is decreased. However, differences between the \u0394\u03bcECN values at the three pressures, at a given temperature, are really small. The maximum variation of the driving force for nucleation, \u0394\u03bcECN , when the pressure is varied is achieved at the maximum supercooling temperature, \u0394T = \u221240 K. At these conditions, \u0394\u03bcECN = \u22122.59, \u22122.55, and \u22122.47kBT at 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, respectively. This means\nthat the maximum variation of \u0394\u03bcECN , at fixed \u0394T and assuming single occupancy, is below 5%. From this perspective, the effect of pressure on the driving force for nucleation can be considered negligible. This result is relevant since it is the first time that the effect of pressure on the driving force for nucleation is studied for a hydrate with the sII structure. According to the results presented in Fig. 9, we can assess that \u0394\u03bcECN does not depend on pressure in the range (500\u20131500 bar) considered in this work and assuming single occupancy of the hydrate."

            "text": "We have determined the solubility of N2 when its aqueous solution is in contact with a N2-rich liquid phase and with a N2 hydrate phase via planar interfaces. Particularly, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures and at three different pressures, 500, 1000, and 1500 bar. We have also estimated the driving force for the nucleation of N2 hydrates using two different routes previously proposed by some of us to deal with CH4 and CO2 hydrates.48,49 Both, solubilities and driving forces for nucleation, are key to understanding, from a thermodynamic point of view, the parameters that control nucleation of hydrates. As in our previous work, water is described using the TIP4P/Ice water model.48,49 In this work, we model N2 using the TraPPE model.51 Unlike dispersive interaction parameters between the oxygen atom of water and the nitrogen atoms of N2, \u03b5ON = \u03beON(\u03b5OO \u03b5NN)1/2, are described using two different values for \u03beON: (1) the standard value obtained from the Berthelot combining rule, \u03beON = 1, and (2) a modified value that correctly predicts the dissociation temperatures of the N2 hydrate at all the pressures considered in this work, \u03beON = 1.15. We calculate all the solubilities using the direct coexistence technique between the two phases (aqueous solution\u2013N2 and aqueous solution\u2013hydrate) at several pressures. We have also performed additional simulations of the pure systems, at several temperatures and pressures, to calculate the driving force for nucleation along the dissociation line of the hydrate.\nWe have analyzed the aqueous solution of N2 when it is in contact with the liquid phase (pure N2) and with the N2 hydrate using the two values of \u03beON previously mentioned. From this information, we have obtained the solubility of N2 in water when the solution is in contact with the N2 liquid phase. The solubility of N2 decreases with temperature, in a similar way to that of carbon dioxide and methane.48,49 Interestingly, the solubility of N2 is similar to that of methane and one order of magnitude smaller than that of carbon dioxide. We have also studied the solubility of N2 in the aqueous solution when it is in contact with the hydrate. This magnitude increases with the temperature, as it happens with the solubility of methane and carbon dioxide in water.48,49\nFollowing our previous works,48,49 we also determine the dissociation temperature of the N2 hydrate (T3), at three different pressures, 500, 1000, and 1500 bar, from the intersection of solubility curves of N2 when the aqueous phase is in contact with the N2-rich liquid phase and when it is in contact with the hydrate. This is possible since the formation of the hydrate phase below the dissociation line and the formation of the N2 liquid phase above the dissociation line, at a given pressure, are activated processes. In other words, there exists metastability below and above the\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 224707 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0176120 159, 224707-12\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\n12 January 2024 19:22:24\ndissociation temperature of the hydrate. The temperature at which the intersection occurs is the T3 value of the hydrate at the corresponding pressure. We have also compared the predictions obtained from computer simulations with experimental data taken from the literature.23,25 Agreement between both results, within error bar of the simulation values, is excellent for the three pressures studied in this work. This is the first time this technique is used and extended to obtain the dissociation line of a hydrate that exhibits the sII solid structure.\nFinally, we also estimate the driving force for nucleation of the N2 hydrate at three different pressures. Particularly, we have calculated \u0394\u03bcECN using two of the routes proposed in our previous paper (routes 1 and 3). Route 1 can be used with confidence since the solubility of N2 in water is similar than that of methane. We also use the simple and approximated dissociation route to obtain a complementary estimation of \u0394\u03bcECN . Although the dissociation route is a simple and fast way to estimate the driving force for nucleation, we do not recommend it in general except for temperatures close to T3. Our results indicate that the effect of pressure on driving force for nucleation can be considered negligible, although \u0394\u03bcECN slightly decreases (in absolute value) when the pressure is increased. Note that this conclusion is valid for the range of pressures considered in this work and assuming single occupancy of the hydrate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the driving force for nucleation of a hydrate that exhibits crystallographic structure sII, along its dissociation line, is studied using computer simulations."
