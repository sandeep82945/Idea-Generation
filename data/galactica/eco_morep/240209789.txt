I provide a model of rational inattention with heterogeneity and prove it is observationally equivalent to a state-dependent stochastic choice model subject to attention costs. I demonstrate that additive separability of unobservable heterogeneity, together with an independence assumption, suffice for the empirical model to admit a representative agent. Using conditional probabilities, I show how to identify: how covariates affect the desirability of goods, (a measure of) welfare, factual changes in welfare, and bounds on counterfactual market shares. 1  S7 concluding remarks I present a theoretical model with additively separable latent heterogeneity that describes the behavior of a population of rationally inattentive decision makers. Under some regularity conditions, I show that this model is observationally equivalent to a state-dependent stochastic choice model constrained by attention costs. In the interest of learning how demand responds to changes in attributes, I include covariates as arguments in the utility indices. Assuming regressors and unobservable heterogeneity are independent, I show that my model admits a representative agent. This aggregation property, together with the structure of the model, allows me to to identify structural and counterfactual parameters when the conditional mean SDSC function is observable, that is, when the econometrician observes conditional probabilities given states and covariates. In particular, I identify how attributes shift the desirability of different goods, (a measure of) welfare, factual changes in welfare, and bounds on counterfactual probabilities of choice. Further assuming utility indices are additively separable in (latent) states, I establish identification with conditional mean stochastic choice data. In the latter case, as the analyst does not need to observe the realization of the state, the model can be used for empirical applications using market-level data.
