"Our results suggest the possibility to target the CB2 receptor with beneficial therapeutical effects, limiting the release of further pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing the differentiation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. In 2019 we demonstrated that in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients, the co-administration of Dexamethasone—the glucocorticoid most frequently used in ITP patients—with JWH133 resulted in an extremely potentiated anti-inflammatory effect. This synergism could represent a cardinal element in DMD therapy as well, allowing to reduce CCs dosage and consequently the related side effects."
