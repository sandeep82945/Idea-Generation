    "abstractText": "In this work, \u03b2-thiogalactoside mimetics bearing 1,1-diarylmethylene or benzophenone aglycons have been prepared and assayed for their affinity towards LecA, a lectin and virulence factor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. The hit compound presents higher efficiency than previously described monovalent inhibitors and the crystal structure confirmed the occurrence of additional contacts between the aglycone and the protein surface. The highest affinity (160 nM) was obtained for a divalent ligand containing two galactosides. The monovalent high affinity compound (Kd = 1 \u03bcM) obtained through structure-activity relationship (SAR) showed efficient antibiofilm activity with no associated bactericidal activity.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen causing severe infections of the respiratory tract particularly in immune-suppressed patients. In addition, P. aeruginosa induces chronic infections in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, damaging the lung epithelium by strains presenting high intrinsic or acquired resistance to\nantibiotics as loss of susceptibility when under biofilms and resulting in morbidity and mortality for young adults[1] P.\naeruginosa adhesion to epithelial cells involves several proteins able to bind to the glycans at the surface of human tissues\nand, including two soluble ones: the galactose specific lectin LecA (PA-IL) and the fucose specific lectin LecB (PA-\nIIL).[2, 3] Experimental studies on mice and humans demonstrated that monosaccharides and more specifically galactose\nprevent lung colonization by P. aeruginosa.[4-6] Therefore, LecA appears as a target of interest and the development of\nhigh affinity glycomimetics as an attractive strategy to treat such infections.[7] Furthermore, LecA is also involved in\nbiofilm formation which makes it a relevant target in the context of antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa.[7] Galactose-\nderivatives targeting this protein were demonstrated to disrupt biofilm formation and restore antibiotic sensitivity.[8-10]\nLecA is a homotetramer with four galactose binding sites, each containing a calcium ion coordinated by both the\ncarbohydrate and the surrounding amino acids (Figure 1A).[11] Because of the spatial organization of the four galactose\nbinding sites, the lectin binds with high avidity to natural glycolipids on cell surfaces. [12] This avidity can be exploited\nfor the design of multivalent glycocompounds that reach high affinity for the lectin.[13] Although the multivalent\ngalactosides showed a stronger affinity (nanomolar range) against LecA than monovalent analogues, their complex\nstructures and high molecular weight result in lack of druglikeness and poor pharmacokinetic properties that are main\ndrawbacks for reaching clinical trials. Divalent compounds able to cross-link two galactose binding sites on the surface\nof LecA, were demonstrated to present sufficient avidity to reach efficiency in the nanomolar range (20-80 nM) (Figure\n1B).[14, 15] However, small monovalent ligands such as galactosides bearing an aromatic aglycon are considered to be\nmore drug-like molecules with favorable bioavailability to reach the targeted infected tissues. As highlighted in the Figure\n1B, a variety of monovalent aryl-\u03b2-O-galactosides were reported to be more active ligands against LecA than galactose.\nLibraries were synthetized and tested with net gain in affinity for phenyl (Kd 8.8 \u00b5M) and nitrophenyl (PNP-\u03b2-Gal; Kd\n14 \u00b5M).[16, 17] The increase in affinity is rationalized by the occurrence of an hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the\ngalactose binding site on LecA surface but also of an unusual T-stacking interaction between the ring of the aglycone and\nthe one of His50.[17] The most affine monovalent ligand to date is a phenyl-galactoside extended by the tripeptide Lys-\nPro-Leu (GalAG0) from Reymond group (Kd 3 \u03bcM).[18] In parallel, Roy et al. reported a novel series of aryl 1-\nthioglycosides, which are more resistant to the metabolic hydrolysis under biological conditions, as a promising and\ninnovative series of glycomimetics with high affinity for LecA.[19] Naphtyl thioglycoside was identified as a good\ncandidate with a Kd of 6 \u03bcM. In addition, the X-ray crystal analysis of the LecA/thionaphtyl-\u03b2-Gal complex revealed that\nthe naphtyl ring plays a pivotal role in the binding pocket by adapting two different conformations in sites A/D and B/C\nof the tetrameric LecA protein. This difference in the naphthyl group orientation was attributed to changes in both \u03a6 and\n\u03a8 torsion angles at the S-glycosidic linkage. Then, the aromatic ring was much closer to the protein surface in protomer\nB than in protomer A. These advanced achievements created an increased interest to discover new small glycomimetic\nthioglycosides.\nIn order to emulate this approach, we sought to explore a new chemical space around the hydrophobic ring with the\npurpose to identify unique structures with better affinity and antibiofilm activities. In this work, we report the synthesis\nof a novel series of monovalent and divalent aryl thioglycosides as LecA inhibitors (Figure 2). Their (i) affinity towards\nLecA, (ii) biofilm inhibition against P. aeruginosa as well as (iii) cytotoxicity against MRC-5 cell line were also\npresented. Notably, the glycomimetics developed here were potent inhibitors of biofilm formation in stark contrast to the ineffective native carbohydrates.\ngalactose ligand as sticks.

Moreover, a variant\nof this method implying the use of the palladium G3-Xanthphosbiphenyl precatalyst under mild reaction conditions (rt\nand aqueous solvent) was developed to functionalize challenging substrates with thiosugars[22] including nucleic\nacids[23] and unprotected long peptides.[24] With these conditions on hand, we first designed a short series of three\nphenyl \u03b2-S-galactopyranoside 4a-c in the aim to evaluate the substitution of the aromatic ring on the affinity toward LecA. Thus, analogues bearing methoxyl, isopropyl and benzaldehyde groups at the para position of the phenyl ring were\nprepared in good yields through a sequence of Pd-catalyzed coupling of the iodinated starting materials 1a-c with the tetra-O-acetylated 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactopyranose 2 followed by the Zamplen deprotection of the acetate groups (Scheme 1). Interestingly, compound 4b which may be considered as a direct aromatic glycomimetic of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) will be a good indicator of the effect of introducing the S-aromatic linkage of IPTG toward\nthe affinity for the lectin (Scheme 1).\nThen, in another part of this study, we focused our synthesis on the 1,1 biaryl thiogalactosides 8a-e and 9a (Scheme 1). We speculated that the presence of two phenyl nucleus linked by Csp2 carbone bridge could provide strong \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking\ninteractions with residues of the binding pocket and will allow us to understand the role played by hydrophobic aglycones\nin binding to LecA.\nThe synthesis of the second series of our thiogalactosides starts from the preparation of the iodinated diphenyl substrates\n6a-f through a Pd\u2010catalyzed Barluenga\u2010Valdes cross-coupling between aryl iodides 1a-c and the corresponding tosyl hydrazones 5a-b.[25] Then, the coupling of the tetra-O-acetylated 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactopyranose 2 with biaryls 6a-f furnished the desired acetylated galactoside intermediates 7a-f in yields ranging from 63% to 96%. Simple deprotection of the acetate groups by action of sodium methoxide in methanol led to the desired compounds 8a-e and 9a in a quantitative yield (Scheme 1).\nFinally, to examine the flexibility versus rigidity of ethylene bridge of 8b, the reduction of this later was performed by hydrogenation with Pd/C. Accordingly, the compound 8f was obtained quantitatively as a mixture of the two diastreosiomers (Scheme 1).\nScheme 1. Synthetic route toward thiogalactoside analogues 3a-c, 8a-f and 9a."

            "text": "2.2.1. Determination of affinity towards LecA and thermodynamic parameters\nThe affinity of generated thiogalactosides has been assessed in solution by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), a\nbioanalytical technique for the study of ligand\u2212receptor interactions that generates thermodynamic information on the\nligand binding process. Typical thermograms of LecA interacting with the four best ligands are given in Figure 2 and all\nothers are available in Supplementary Information. Titration of LecA by monovalent ligands resulted in exothermic peaks\nand saturation of 50% of protein occurred with a stoichiometry close to n = 1, indicating the expected binding interaction.\nAs expected, the divalent compound 9a displays a stoichiometry ligand/protein close to 0.5, indicating that each of the galactose residues is bound to a LecA protomer which is confirmed by aggregation observed in ITC tube.\nTable 1 reports the affinity values for all compounds. For monovalent galactosides, the values vary between 1 and 12\n\u00b5M with higher affinity obtained for compounds 4b, 8a and 8c with Kd lower than 3 \u03bcM. This is 30-fold better than the\naffinity observed for galactose and also stronger than the best affinity reported previously for best thio-galactoside ligands\nfor LecA displayed in Figure 1.[19] Interestingly, the affinity of the isopropyl-phenyl-S-galactoside 4b (Kd = 2.45 \u03bcM) is 10-time higher than the corresponding non-aromatic IPTG (Kd = 32 \u03bcM).[16] This result demonstrates clearly the gain\nobtained with S-aryl galactoside ligands compared to S-alkyl analogues. Importantly, the series bearing biaryl aglycones\n(compounds 8a-f) showed a promising activity particularly with the benzophenone monovalent galactoside 8a with a Kd of 1 \u03bcM. To our knowledge, this is the strongest reported affinity for a monovalent galactoside towards LecA. The\nstructure-activity relationship study (SAR) showed that replacing the carbonyl bridge in 8a by a double bond (compound 8b) lead to a lower affinity toward the lectin with a Kd of 6.9 \u03bcM. In addition, reducing the double bond into a methyl group (compound 8e) decreased the affinity (Kd = 9 \u03bcM). This result suggests a role for the oxygen atom of the carbonyl bridge and indicates that an optimal positioning of the two aromatics is crucial for the binding to LecA.\nIt is worth noticing that since benzophenone scaffolds are often used as photoactivatable probes,[26-29] our hit\ncompound 8a could potentially display photoactivatable properties. It could therefore be envisaged that the irradiation of 8a at 330-365 nm would generate radicals able to react with the protein target by photo-crosslinking.However, during our characterization, particularly during -crystallization experiments and subsequent analysis of crystal structure, we did not\nobserve any photo-crosslinking arising from the alkylation of the benzophenone scaffold to the lectin protein.\nThe analysis of the thermodynamic contribution demonstrated that the interaction is driven by enthalpy of binding,\nwhich is opposed by an entropy barrier, as often observed in protein/glycocompoundinteractions.[30] The compounds\nthat reach the stronger enthalpy, 4b, 8a and 8c, are the ones with higher affinity, indicating that creation of additional contacts around the galactose binding sites is the appropriate strategy to obtain efficient ligands. Compound 8a singles out by its stronger enthalpy and also by a heat integration curve that did not fit perfectly with one site model. Together\nwith baseline noise around saturation of 50% of protein, usually associated with aggregation, this indicates additional\ninteractions, probably with neighboring tetramers in solution (Figure 2).\nThe divalent galactoside 9a displayed an excellent affinity toward LecA with a Kd = 160 nM (Figure 2). In addition,\nthe stoichiometry value of 0.44 indicates that the two thiosugar moieties interact with LecA. Considering the short size\nof the linker and the precipitation observed during titration, compound 9a does not bind to two adjacent galactose binding sites on one LecA tetramer but rather cross-link two tetramers.\nTable 1 .

The solid line represents the\nbest least-square fit to experimental data using a one site model.\n2.2.2. Co-crystal structures of LecA with compounds 8a and 8c\nCo-rystallization experiments were conducted with 8a, 8c and 9a ligand with the protein either preincubated with the ligand or deposited on the coverslip with dried ligand on it (dry-soaked method). Co-crystals were obtained for LecA\nwith compounds 8a and 8c only, diffracting to 1.75 and 1.53 \u00c5, respectively. The content of unit cell was different with one lectin tetramer and four ligands for the complex with 8a and one lectin dimer with only one ligand for the complex with 8c (Figure 3 A and B). This difference resulted from the ligand-induced packing. For 8a, stacking contacts are observed between the aryl rings of two ligands in facing tetramer as frequently observed for LecA in complex with\naromatic galacto compounds, while for 8c, the distal aryl moiety contacts the binding site of neighbouring LecA, preventing the binding site to be occupied. Such contacts occur only during crystallization and are generally not relevant\nfor analysing the affinity of LecA in solution, although some signs of aggregation were observed during titration of LecA\nby 8a.\nAnalysis of contacts established by compound 8c in the binding site reveals the classical contacts for galactose, including calcium coordination by oxygen O3 and O4, direct hydrogen bonds with the protein and water mediated\nhydrogen bonds for O6 (Figure 3B). The aglycone folds on the protein surface, creating hydrophobic contacts with CH2\nof His50 and Pro51 with the proximal and distal benzyl groups, respectively. The rings of His50 and of the ligand are\nalmost perpendicular, corresponding to an unusual type of hydrophobic interaction, described as T-shape and previously\nobserved with other aromatic aglycones for LecA ligands.[17] The extensive hydrophobic interactions between the\naglycone of 8c and LecA surface provides the structural basis of its excellent affinity (Kd = 3 \u03bcM).\nsphere, the galactoside as sticks, water molecules as red spheres, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts as blue and\nmagenta dotted lines, respectively. (A) Compound 8a in three different conformations observed in the binding site of chain A, B and D. Binding site of chain C is similar to chain A and is not represented. (B) Compound 8c in binding site A. (C) Superimposition of 8a (two conformations) and 8c in LecA protomer\nThe compound 8a, which displays the highest affinity for LecA (Kd = 1 \u03bcM) compared to the other monovalent ligands, adopts different conformations for its aglycone in the four binding sites, while the galactose always maintains the classical\nbinding mode described above. In protomers A and C, the conformations are very similar, with the two aryl rings adopting\nan overall shape similar to the one observed for compound 8c thus, creating same hydrophobic contacts with His50 and Pro51 (Figure 3A). In addition, the methoxy group on the proximal benzyl creates hydrophobic contact with Pro38 on the\nother wall of the binding site. Interestingly, the C=O group between the two benzyl rings establishes a direct hydrogen\nbond with the side chain of Gln53, that is already interacting with the O6 hydroxyl of the galactose residue. A water\nbridge is also observed between C=0 and this side chain. These additional hydrogen bonds are in agreement with the more\nfavourable enthalpy of binding measured for compound 8a. The value of \u0394H is 50% higher than for homolog 8b that differs only by C=C replacing C=O. The strong enthalpy is partially compensated by increase of entropy barrier but still\nresults in higher affinity. Compound 8a adopts a different conformation in the binding site of chain D and is partially\ndisordered in chain B, resulting in electron density visible only for proximal aryl group (SI, Figure S5 A and C). The\nresulting extended conformation of the aglycone moiety in chain D displays only limited contact with the protein surface,\nwith methoxy group of first benzyl contacting the CH2 of His50. This illustrates the flexibility of the thio-linkage that\nallows for different conformations, here, probably induced by the crystal packing.\nSince the origin for high affinity of compounds 8a is related to the creation of a hydrogen bond with Gln53, we searched for similar contacts in LecA complexes available in Unilectin3D, the database of crystal structures of lectins.[31]\nSynthetic compounds from Winssinger and Titz groups do present a C=O bond linker on the benzyl ring but in para\nposition compared to galactose that is therefore too far from Gln53 for creating a hydrogen bond.[14, 32] On the opposite,\nthe natural ligand, isoGb3 trisaccharide (\u03b1Gal1-3\u03b2Gal1-4Glc) demonstrates two hydrogen bonds between the \u03b2Gal\nresidue and Gln53.[12] Furthermore, compound 8a adopts a shape very similar to this trisaccharide in the binding site of LecA (Figure 4). The target of LecA in human is proposed to be Gb3, a sphingolipid present on human tissues, and\npresenting the \u03b1Gal1-4\u03b2Gal1-4Glc epitope. No crystal structure is available but a modelling study also proposed that O2\nand O3 of the second galactose interact with Gln53 side chain through hydrogen bonds.[12] Compound 8a appears therefore as an excellent mimic of the natural glycoconjugates targeted by P. aeruginosa on the surface of lung\nepithelia.[33]\ntrisaccharide \u03b1Gal1-3\u03b2Gal1-4Glc from PDB 2VXJ (stick colored in cyan).\nValues in parentheses correspond to high resolution shell \u2020 5 % of the reflections were set aside for a Rfree test before initiating any refinement\n2.3 In vitro cytotoxicity and antibiofilm activity\n2.3.a. Antibiofilm activity\nMicrobial biofilms are becoming increasingly difficult to treat in the medical setting due to their intrinsic\nresistance to antibiotics. In order to study the potential antibiofilm activity of the most active ligands 8a and 9a, their effect on the inhibition of the biofilm formation was evaluated in a P. aeruginosa assay (Figure 5). Solution with 3 %\nmethanol was considered for control. At first, the effect of monovalent galactoside 8a was investigated with concentrations of 0.08 to 5 mM. Compound 8a showed a dose-response effect on the bacterial biofilm formation with 100 % of inhibition at 5 mM (log reduction > 4) (Figure 5).\nThe antibiofilm activity with the divalent glycomimetic 9a was also examined. The concentration of 5 mM was fixed first to compare the effect of divalent 9a with the monovalent 8a which showed a strong effect (100 % biofilm inhibition) at this concentration. Surprisingly, at 5 mM, 9a showed a slightly lower reduction of biofilm formation with approximatively 90% inhibition (1 log reduction compared to the 3 % methanol control) (Figure 5). This result is not in\nagreement with the high affinity observed with 9a (Kd = 0.16 \u00b5M) against LecA and at this stage no any obvious correlation between the affinity toward the lectin LecA and the antibiofilm activity could be established. A possible\nexplanation of this result would be a potential aggregating effect displayed by the compound 9a. Several scenari can be envisage for lack of antibiofilm effect of cross-linking compounds, such as the formation of microbial microcolonies that\nwould be favourable for the bacteria.\nOf note, since the biofilm activity of 9a is less than 8a at 5 mM, the study of its effect at lesser concentrations are not warranted.\n2.3. b. In vitro cytotoxicity\nThe toxicity of ligands 8a and 9a against MRC-5 cell line (Human Fetal Lung Fibroblast Cells) was evaluated after a 24 h of contact (Figure 6). In such conditions, no significant loss of cell viability was observed for the higher\nmethanol concentration (3%) and 8a and 9a compounds for concentrations less than or equal to 1.25 mM or 2.5 mM respectively. At the higher concentration tested (5 mM) the cell viability versus control was 7.1% and 5.2% for\nrespectively compounds 8a and 9a. Then diluted 2 fold (2.5 mM) cell viability increased to 41.1% for 8a and 65.1% for 9a to be above 50% for both compounds at the concentration of 1.25mM (61.5% and 91.4% respectively). These results indicate that these two hit compounds display a cytotoxic effect at concentration higher than 1.25 mM. It can be noted\nthat at non-toxic concentration of 1.25 mM (Figure 5), the best compound identified 8a displays approximatively 40% of biofilm inhibition.\nFinally, to exclude any unwanted antibiotic effect on biofilm formation, the MICs (the concentration at which no bacterial\ngrowth was visible after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C) and MBCs (minimal bactericidal concentration; the concentration at\nwhich the number of CFU was reduced by 99.9%) of compounds 8a and 9a against P. aeruginosa PAO1 were recorded as previously described.[34] The MICs and MBCs were higher than 5 mM (the highest concentration tested) for both\ncompounds which demonstrated clearly the absence of classical antibacterial effect (on planktonic cells) for the tested\ncompounds.\nConclusion\nIn the context of the global threat of antimicrobial resistance, the development of strategies to support or complement\nantibiotics is crucial.[35] Strategies for developing compounds that would fight infection without or with limited risk\ninducing resistance include anti-adhesion and anti-biofilm therapy. Glycomimetics that are able to compete with\nattachment site on tissues and/or biofilm formation have been used to target pathogens.[10, 36-37] Different designs have\nbeen proposed, from large multivalent glycodendrimers[38] to non-carbohydrate glycomimetics[39], but the simpler\nmonosaccharide derivatives, as the ones described here, present the advantage of small size, fine specificity through the\nmonosaccharide moiety and reasonable pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, the use of thio-\nglycoside linkage insures the metabolic stability.\nIn summary, we synthetized a series of thio-galactosides compounds directed towards LecA from P. aeruginosa with the\naim of increasing the chemical diversity around the aglycone phenyl group, with substituents in meta and ortho positions\nthat were not explored previously. The affinities of a variety of mono-aryl and bi-aryl derivatives were analyzed by ITC\nas well as a divalent compound. This SAR investigation demonstrated that the bi-aryl derivative with a carbonyl linker\non position meta and methoxy on position ortho results in the affinity value that was not previously reached for\nmonovalent ligand of LecA. The crystal structure of the complex rationalized this observation by confirming the\nestablishment of new ligand-protein contacts. It also uncovered the strong similarity with the contact established with\nnatural oligosaccharides in LecA binding site, demonstrating that this hit compound is an excellent mimetic of the natural\nligand. This hit compound demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm formation, with no antibacterial effect on\nplanktonic cells at the efficient dose, and no toxicity on human cells. It is therefore a very promising hit-compound for\ntherapeutical development, for example as adjuvant to antibiotic actions.\n4. Experimental"

Crystals of the complex with compound 8c were obtained by cocrystallisation where lyophilized LecA was dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl to a concentration of 16.9 mg/mL and incubated for 3h at room temperature with 3.8 mM of compound (1 \u00b5L of 100 mM compound in 100% DMSO added to 25 \u00b5L of protein).

Rod like crystals were transferred in 30% PEG3350 for cryoprotection prior mounting in a cryoloop and flashed freezed in liquid nitrogen. For the complex with compound 8a, the dry soak method was used where 0.2 \u00b5L of 25mM compound dissolved in 100% DMSO were deposited on the coverslip prior drying at room temperature for a night. Then, 1 \u00b5L of lyophilised LecA dissolved in 20 mM Hepes 7.5 10\u00b5M CaCl2 to 9.8 mg/mL was added and 1 \u00b5L of reservoir solution containing 18% PEG3350, 100 mM KSCN and 100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5. Rod like crystals were obtained and a single rod was transferred in a solution were the PEG concentration was increased to 28% prior mounting and freezing. Data were collected at SOLEIL synchrotron, Saint Aubin, France on Proxima 1 beamline using an Eiger pixel detector (Dectris Ltd). The data were processed using XDS[45] and XDSME.[46] All further computing was performed using the CCP4 suite.[47] The structures were solved by molecular replacement using as search model the monomer A coordinates of LecA-Gal complex PDB1OKO in PHASER 2.8 with a search for 2 and 4 copies for LecA-8c and LecA-8a complexes, respectively.[48] The model was improved using Buccaneer 1.5 [49] and ARP/wARP 8.0 [50] for LecA-8c and LecA-8a complexes, respectively. Restrained maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC 5.8 [51] was iterated with manual rebuilding in Coot [52] to refine the structures. Five percent of the observations were set aside to perform cross- validation analysis. Hydrogen atoms were added in their riding positions and used for geometry and structure factor calculations. Ligand library were made using JLigand 2.6 (AceDRG mode) before modelling after inspection of the electron density maps and checked using Privateer.[53] Prior deposition in the Protein Data Bank, the models were validated using both the wwPDB Validation server (http://wwpdb-validation.wwpdb.org) and Molprobity.[54] Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited under PDB accession codes 7Z62 and 7Z62 for LecA in complex with compound 8c and 8a, respectively. Data quality and refinement statistics are described in Table 2. 4.5 Antibiofilm activity [29, 55-56] P. aeruginosa PAO1 (CIP 104116) was obtained from the Institute Pasteur collection (Paris, France). The strain was frozen and kept at \u201380\u00b0C. The inoculum used in each experiment came from a second subculture on Trypticase soy agar (BioM\u00e9rieux, Crapone, France) that was incubated under aerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Bacterial suspensions were freshly prepared in sterile distilled water before each experiment. A low-nutritive medium, named minimum biofilm broth (MBB) was used for the biofilm formation and the evaluation of the antibiofilm activity of extracts to create stressful conditions and subsequently promote biofilm formation and growth of adherent cells rather than planktonic growth. The MBB 10X medium is composed of FeSO4, 7 H2O (0.005 g/L), Na2HPO4 (12.5 g/L), KH2PO4 (5.0 g/L), (NH4)2SO4 (1.0 g/L), glucose (0.5 g/L) and MgSO4, 7 H2O (0.2 g/L) \u00a0 Biofilms were developed in 24-well plates (Falcon, TC-treated, polystyrene). The bacterial suspension prepared in MBB (2X) was initially adjusted to 108 CFU/mL followed by a serial dilution to 10\u22126 with the same medium. One milliliter of the 10\u22126 dilution (equivalent to 102 CFU/mL) was introduced into each well. In order to test its effect on the biofilm, 1.0 mL of test compound solution prepared at different concentrations in sterile distilled water was added to each well (final concentrations 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.31 and 0.08 mM). Wells containing 1.0 mL of SDW + 1.0 mL of un-inoculated MBB or 1.0 mL SDW + 1.0 mL inoculated MBB, were considered as sterility and biofilm growth controls, respectively. Plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 2, 4, 6, 20 and 24 h of incubation, the wells were rinsed twice with sterile distilled water and the medium (BBM \u00b1 tested product) was replaced. All assays were performed in triplicate.\nAfter incubation, wells were rinsed twice with 2.0 mL of SDW, and then the attached cells were scraped (for 1 min) with a sterile spatula into 1 mL of SDW. The recovered suspension was diluted by serial dilution (from 10\u22121 to 10\u22126) and each dilution was inoculated by inclusion in TSA agar plates. After 48 h of incubation at 37 \u02daC, the numbers of CFU were counted by considering only plates with 15 to 300 CFU. The adhered biomass was then calculated and subjected to logarithmic transformation by Formula (1). The logarithmic reduction and the percentage of biofilm inhibition with respect to the corresponding untreated control were also calculated using Formulas (2) and (3).\nlog of adhered biomass log CFU/mL log number of colonies CFUDilution factor x inoculated volume\nlog CFU ml\u2044 reduction log CFU ml\u2044 for control log CFU ml\u2044 for treated biofilm\nIP % Adhered cells CFU mL Adhered cells CFU mL\u2044\u2044Adhered cells CFU mL\u2044 100"

            "text": "Determination of the MICs and MBCs of evaluated compounds was performed in Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar, respectively, according to EUCAST/CA-SFM guidelines (2020). The range of tested concentrations was from 5,0 mM to 0,0098 mM. The highest used methanol concentration was also tested to confirm no inhibitory of growth nor bactericidal activity. 4.7 Cytotoxicity on mammalian cells (MRC-5)\n\u00a0 Evaluation of compounds cytotoxicity was performed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay based on published procedure[57]\u00a0 with some modifications. The potential cytotoxic activity of the ten most active compounds was assessed against MRC-5 cell lines (Human Fetal Lung Fibroblast Cells: ATCC\u00ae CCL-171) purchased from the ATCC\u00ae (Manassas, United-States) and cultivated in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM: (Dominique Dutsher, Plaisance-du-Touch, France) in flask. Solutions (2-fold serial dilutions) of selected compounds were prepared in RPMI medium. 96-wells microtiter plates were first filled with 100 \u00b5l of a cell suspension prepared in RPMI medium (2 x 104 cells/100 \u00b5L). After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5-6.5% CO2 incubator, 100 \u00b5L of each product dilution were added to achieve final concentrations ranging from 5,0 mM to 0,0098 mM (final volume 200 \u00b5L/well). Wells corresponding to the untreated control were supplemented with 100 \u00b5L of fresh medium. Phenol was used as positive control for cytotoxicity. The microplate was then incubated for 24h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5-6.5% CO2 incubator. The supernatant was then discarded followed by a rinsing with 100 \u00b5L of Dulbeccos\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS, Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Then 100 \u00b5l of a MTT solution prepared in D-PBS at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL were added in all wells. After 60 min of incubation at 37 \u00b0C and in order to solubilize the formed formazan, indicator of cell viability, 100 \u00b5L of DMSO were added. After agitation, the OD was measured at 570 nm and the viability percentage was calculated using the following formula. Assays were performed in duplicate with four technical replicates.\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56ability % \ud835\udc65 100\nCytotoxicity was defined for viability percentages below 50%.[33]"
