    "abstractText": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) in raw and processed grain poses significant risks to human and animal health. In this study, the feasibility of classifying DON levels in different genetic lines of barley kernels was evaluated using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) (382\u20131030 nm) in tandem with an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN). Machine learning methods including logistic regression, support vector machine, stochastic gradient descent, K nearest neighbors, random forest, and CNN were respectively used to develop the classification models. Spectral preprocessing methods including wavelet transform and max-min normalization helped to enhance the performance of different models. A simplified CNN model showed better performance than other machine learning models. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) in combination with successive projections algorithm (SPA) was applied to select the best set of characteristic wavelengths. Based on seven wavelengths selected, the optimized CARS-SPA-CNN model distinguished barley grains with low levels of DON (<5 mg/kg) from those with higher levels (5 mg/kg < DON \u2264 14 mg/kg) with an accuracy of 89.41%. The lower levels of DON class I (0.19 mg/kg \u2264 DON \u2264 1.25 mg/kg) and class II (1.25 mg/kg < DON \u2264 5 mg/kg) were successfully distinguished based on the optimized CNN model, yielding a precision of 89.81%. The results suggest that HSI in tandem with CNN has great potential for discrimination of DON levels of barley kernels.",

            "text": "Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), which is the fourth most grown cereal in the world [1], is an ancient and significant cereal grain crop [2]. While barley is suffering from many diseases due to global climate change. Among these diseases, Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by Fusarium, has rapidly become one of the devastating crop diseases worldwide [3]. The three main negative effects of FHB infection in cereals include impaired technical quality, loss of cereal yield and contamination with Fusarium toxins [4]. During infection, Fusarium spp. can produce a number of trichothecene toxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV) [5], zearalenone (ZEA) and moniliformin (MON) [6]. Of these trichothecene mycotoxins, DON is the most common one in barley, which can cause food refusal, vomiting, diarrhea and dermatitis [7]. DON content is routinely measured before the harvested grain for malt, food, and feed [8]. Regulatory guidelines for DON levels vary by country [9]. The US Food and Drug Administration has set a recommended limit of 1.00 mg/kg for DON in processed wheat products [10], while Brazil has established DON limits of 1.00 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg in whole wheat grain and other wheat derivates, respectively [11]. In addition, the maximum level of DON in unprocessed grains has been approved by the European Union at 1.25 mg/kg [12]. Therefore, cereals with DON levels higher than 1.25 mg/kg should not be used as food for humans. However, it can be mixed\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23052668 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 2 of 16\nwith clean cereals or other cereal batches low in DON to eventually produce cereal batches for feed specifications. Due to the devastating nature of FHB, it is vital for growers to devise strategies to mitigate losses caused from the disease [13]. These strategies include cultural practices, tolerant cultivars or planting resistant, biological control, chemical control, harvesting strategies, and use of forecasting systems. Agronomic practices and fungicides only partially reduce the risk of damage [14]. The best way to control FHB and reduce mycotoxin contamination is to create wheat genotypes carrying effective resistance genes [15]. Thousands of breeding lines are screened for DON levels annually to develop resistant cultivars. The resistance to DON accumulation in barley is inherited quantitatively [8]. Due to the health concerns, barley replaced wheat cultivated area, food or feed requires periodic detection of DON levels. And the barley kernels are harvested for DON assays. Nowadays, various techniques have been used to detect and quantify DON contamination in cereals. The typical chemical methods include gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although these techniques can determine the DON concentration, they are time consuming, costly, and destructive [16]. Consequently, farmers and the food industry need to seek alternative techniques for rapid and non-destructive detections of DON levels. Spectroscopic methods have been used to evaluate the mycotoxins in cereals widely [17]. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging, non-destructive and cost-effective method for capturing spectral data at a per-pixel location in a sample image. This method may become an alternative to time-consuming wet chemical methods for toxin assessment [18]. However, one of the challenges in HSI is how to handle large amounts of high-dimensional data. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been widely used in the field of spectral data analysis. Hamidisepehr and Sama [19] tested several commercial machine learning algorithms using spectral data collected from moisture-controlled silt loam and wheat straw residue samples. The stereoscopic support vector machine (SVM) and integrated bagged tree methods predicted 96% and 93% accuracy for the silt samples and 86% and 93% accuracy for the wheat straw residue samples respectively. Feng, et al. [20] used three different data fusion approaches (raw data fusion, feature fusion and decision fusion) to fuse three types of spectral features for the classification of rice diseases using machine learning methods such as SVM and logistic regression (LR) with the accuracy of over 93%. The performance of detection of models built by conventional algorithms may be limited by specially designed constraints and model parameters. Deep learning has been proven to be an advanced big data analysis technique applied in food quality inspection [21]. Yu, et al. [22] presented a novel method for the non-destructive identification of pesticide residues on the surface of cantaloupe using visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy (348 -1141 nm) in combination with deep feature fusion. The proposed one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model accurately distinguished the presence of pesticide residues with an identification accuracy of 99.17%. Later, Zhu, et al. [23] implemented a rapid in situ identification of pesticide residues in tea by combining surfaceenhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and 1D-CNN. In recent years, 1D-CNN has made some progress in the non-destructive detection of agricultural products by combining with spectral imaging techniques. Gao, et al. [24] used 1D-CNN to classify the presence of aflatoxin in peanuts and wheat with the highest test accuracy of 96.35%. A model based on HSI and 1D-CNN to differentiate soybean seed varieties achieved a classification accuracy of over 98% [25]. Another method based on Vis/NIR spectroscopy combined with 1D-CNN was proposed for the non-destructive detection of pesticide residues on the surface of cantaloupe with an accuracy of 95.83% [22]. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been conducted to assay the DON content in barley kernel samples combining hyperspectral techniques and 1D-CNN. Furthermore, feature variable selection allows the best combination of several discrete wavelengths to be determined from hundreds of spectral variables, which is a straightforward and effective way to reduce redundant data [26\u201329]. Wavelength selection approaches like competitive adaptive reweighted\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 3 of 16\nsampling (CARS), successive projections algorithm (SPA), first order derivative and mean centre iterative algorithm (FMCIA) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE) have been effectively employed to recognize information on characteristics related to chemical composition, texture, authenticity and fungal contamination of food products [30,31]. In this study, 1D-CNN algorithm was employed to analyze the obtained hyperspectral data to assay the DON content in barley kernels. The specific objectives were to: (1) evaluate the potential of HSI for DON level detection in barley grain; (2) construct a deep learning model on the basis of the 1D-CNN algorithm and to compare its capabilities with conventional machine learning models; (3) build a classification algorithm to distinguish samples with the low DON level (\u22641.25 mg/kg) from those with higher DON levels."

The grain spawning method proposed by Steffenson [32] was used for inoculation. The spikes of each strain were harvested at physiological maturity in August, desiccated to approximately 2% moisture in a forced air dryer at 12 \u25e6C for 35 days, threshed and cleaned. After the resulting cereal samples were used for hyperspectral scanning imaging, the DON content (mg/kg) of barley samples is assayed by triplicate analysis using the Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) reference method [33]. A total of 590 samples were evaluated (about 10 g per sample). Based on the DON levels determined by GC-MS, the samples in the calibration group were divided into 3 categories: 28 samples in class I (0.19 mg/kg \u2264 DON \u2264 1.25 mg/kg), 109 samples in class II (1.25 mg/kg < DON \u2264 5 mg/kg) and 453 samples in class III (5 mg/kg < DON \u2264 14 mg/kg). Before GC-MS analysis, hyperspectral images of the barley samples were obtained by a linear scan Vis/NIR HSI system (367\u20131048 nm). As shown in Figure 1, this hyperspectral system (PlantSpec 10, Middleton Spectral Vision, Middleton, WI, USA) consists of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) (MSV500, Middleton Research, Middleton, WI, USA), a two-line halogen light source (2 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 35 W, luminous flux: 840\u2013950) (MSV Series 13 illumination, Middleton Spectral Vision, Middleton Spectral Vision, Middleton, WI, USA), a spectrometer with optical resolution (V10E, Specim, Oulu, Finland) consisting of a 1.2 nm, a computer with data acquisition software for controlling the hyperspectral camera, scanner carrier table and image acquisition, and a conveyor system operated by stepper motors. Once all hyperspectral images were acquired, a developed coding algorithm was used to calculate the calibration of all spectral images. The average spectrum of each sample was then automated and extracted according to Matlab R2019a (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Data from the hyperspectral images were restricted to the interval 383\u20131030 nm (550 variables) due to the low signal-to-noise ratio on both sides of the obtained spectra. The number of the samples in this research is unbalanced with respect to the deep learning model. In order to avoid overshooting of CNN training and to obtain a superior deep learning model, a data augmentation Tian, et al. [34] proposed was used to increase the number of samples.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 4 of 16Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 16\nFigure 1.

It determines the range of data by setting the minus between the maximum and minimum amounts acting as the numerator. With regard to the numerator, each element of x can be represented as a value between 0 and 1 by deducting the minimum value of the x element from each factor of x. Wavelet transform (WT), a new mathematical technique, has been shown to have fast computational and fast fading properties [36]. WT theory was extensively developed in the 1980s.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is also referred to as stochastic approximation, describes the structure of certain simple iterations for solving random optimization and root searching problems [40]. The identifying features of SGD are very similar to those of gradient descent used for deterministic optimization. Each successive iteration in a recursion is identified by adding appropriately scaled gradient estimates to the previous iterations. Random forest (RF) is a supervised algorithm that uses an integrated learning method consisting of numerous decision trees, with the output being a consensus on the best answer to the problem [41]. K nearest neighbors (KNN) is a common algorithm used for supervised learning, which works by finding the K nearest training samples in the training set based on some distance given a test sample, and then predicting based on information from these K neighbors [42]. Decision tree [43] (DT) is a fundamental approach of classification and registration. A DT model is a dendritic structure that indicates the process of categorizing instances on the basis of features in a categorization issue. Naive bayes (NB) is a method of classification founded on Bayes\u2019 theorem and the conditional independence assumption of features [44]. The joint probability distribution from input to output is first learnt from a known set of training items, assuming that independence between feature terms as a prerequisite.

            "text": "The fundamental structure of a CNN is composed of a convolutional layer, an activation function layer, a pooling layer and a fully connected layer. The convolutional layer is primarily employed to select hidden features from the data. The feature map of the inputs data is available by means of a continuous sliding filter. In this study, two CNN architectures were proposed. The pool size was set to 2 \u00d7 1. As shown in Figure 2, the data is input into the original 1D-CNN when the number of features is 550. The original 1D-CNN includes one input layer, seven convolutional layers, three max pooling layers, one global average pooling layer, one dropout layer and one full connected layer. While the simplified 1D-CNN consists of one input layer, four convolutional layers, one max pooling layers, one global average pooling layer, one dropout layer and one full connected layer. The input layer is used for inputting spectral data and the output layer is used for prediction. In addition, a 2 \u00d7 1 max-pooling layer reduces the feature dimension by half, and the three maxpooling layers are used in the original model structure as shown in Figure 2. Such a structure can work normally when the input feature quantity is 550. When the number of features is less than a certain value, the maxpooling layer does not work and increases the calculation time. Therefore, a simplified model is proposed for training after feature band selection. In the simplified model, due to the reduction in the number of features, we have reduced the kernel size of the convolution layers and the number of maxpooling layers to adapt to the smaller number of features. Compared to the original model structure, a smaller kernel size means a smaller receptive field, so the original model structure has better feature extraction ability under 550 features. Therefore, it is chosen to retain both the original model and the simplified model for use in different feature quantity situations. It should be noted that the experiments before feature band selection in this paper are trained by the original model, and the subsequent experiments are completed by the simplified model.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 6 of 16Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 7 of 16"

            "text": "CARS is an efficient tactic for the selection of the best combined of key wavelengths in multicomponent spectral data according to the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d principle [45]. A subset of N variables is selected by N iterative ways through N number of sampled runs, with the final subset with the smallest root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) value being selected as the best subset. CARS performs four consecutive steps in each sampling run, including Monte Carlo model sampling, EDF forced wave reduction, ARS competitive wave reduction and RMSECV computation of each subset. CARS achieves the selection of the optimal subset of wavelengths to some extent. SPA [46] is a forward selection method that uses simple operations to minimize variable covariance in vector space, as a new variable selection strategy for multivariate calibration. SPA carries out a simple projected operation in vector space to get a useful subset of variables with minor covariances. Here is a summary of the main points. First, before selecting the starting vector in the n-dimensional space, set the maximum number of variables N to be selected (where n is an original number of variables). Afterwards, the vector of the higher projection is selected in the orthogonal subspace to become the starting new vector. At each iteration an orthogonal subspace is chosen so that only non-covariates are selected. The best initial variables and number of variables can be identified from the minimum root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) [47]."

So far as we know, this is the first time that deep learning has been applied to the online detection of wheat plague level grading In this study, the proposed 1D-CNN can be used to efficiently analyze spectral data. The convolutional layers in 1D-CNN are specially designed to extract concealed features in the spectrum more accurately and efficiently than traditional machine learning methods. The characteristic wavelength model can achieve prediction precision similar to that of the full band model. In the study, the 28 variables selected by CARS (390.905, 392.015, 393.126, 403.128, 407.581, 413.152, 415.382, 431.022, 433.261, 456.825, 460.2, 569.42, 571.72, 584.39 606.346, 607.504, 608.662, 724.598, 728.15, 810.477, 815.287, 823.714, 924.577, 970.104, 971.339, 1014.733, 1018.467, 1023.449 nm) lie in the visible and NIR spectral ranges within the visible and NIR spectra, suggesting that the cyan region of the spectra may not contain characteristic information relevant to the DON content. After removing 21 of the 28 wavelengths, the remaining seven feature wavelengths selected by CARS-SPA (403.128, 433.261, 460.2, 728.15, 815.287, 971.339, and 1023.449 nm) were used to develop a 1D-CNN model to predict DON content, yielding very similar accuracy as using 28 variables. This indicated the redundant information provided by the 21 variables that were removed. With the majority of the redundant information removed, the improved model still retained a high prediction precision and greatly facilitated the speedy determination of DON in barley kernel samples. However, the classification performance was insufficient. The errors in prediction may be due to the low DON concentration of the barley samples used in this study. After feature band extraction using CARS-SPA, the accuracy was reduced due to the removal of some of the bands containing valid spectral information. At the same time, however, the model was simplified and the efficiency was improved. More efficient methods are needed in the future to analyze hyperspectral data with high complexity. The processing of the initial data can also be further improved, and the replacement of wavelet transform filters and changes to filter parameters will be further attempted in the future to optimize the whole process in order to develop more efficient and accurate models. In addition to this,\nSensors 2023, 23, 2668 14 of 16\nlaboratory environment can also affect the accuracy of the model. For the best possible precision of the model, changes in the external environment, like temperature and humidity, should be avoided in the online detection of DON levels that affect the spectral acquisition.

The data were subjected to one-step and two-step pre-processing after the enhancements as the physicochemical values of DON were too small. In order to eliminate the collinearity variable in the original spectrum and simplify the model, the feature wavelength extraction was performed. CARS was used to search hundreds of variables for characteristic wavelengths that may be related to the DON levels in the particulate samples, and these identified wavelengths are then re-optimized by the SPA. The results showed that the optimized CARS-SPA-CNN model was successfully used to distinguish barley samples with low levels of DON fortification (\u22645 mg/kg) from those with high levels of DON fortification (>5 mg/kg) with a precision of 89.41%. Further, when classifying class I (DON: >0.19 mg/kg and \u22641.25 mg/kg) and class II (DON: >1.25 mg/kg and \u22645 mg/kg), the accuracy was 89.81%. Compared with other models, the proposed method showed the highest precision. However, the regression performance still has the potential to be improved, the processing of the initial data can be further improved and the laboratory environment can also affect the accuracy of the model. Based on this approach, future studies will validate the reliability of the technique using samples with a wide range of DON levels from different regions, seasons and experiments. It is certain that the optimized CARS-SPA-CNN model in this study will have a broad application in the spectral analysis of agricultural crops.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, W.-H.S.; methodology, B.-Y.L.; software, B.-Y.L.; validation, B.-Y.L.; formal analysis, K.-J.F.; investigation, B.-Y.L.; resources, W.-H.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, K.-J.F.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.-J.F., W.-H.S.; supervision, W.-H.S.; project administration, W.-H.S.; funding acquisition, W.-H.S.
