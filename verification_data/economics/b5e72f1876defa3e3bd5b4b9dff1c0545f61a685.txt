"**6. conclusion** China has announced a delayed retirement system, but the specific delayed retirement policy still needs to be formulated (8). As health is an essential factor affecting the employment of the older people (22), few studies in China have been conducted to explain whether the older population has sufficient health capacity to cooperate with implementing the delayed retirement policy from a health perspective. This study finds that older women in China still have some excess working capacity and room for delayed retirement based on womenâ€™s health perspective, which further enriches the measurement of retirement age and provides some theoretical support for the delayed retirement policy. As the health level of older women continues to improve, if the labor potential of older women can be further explored, it will help further mitigate the adverse effects of population aging and realize the positive aging strategy (52). However, the implications of delaying retirement age reform are broad and far-reaching."
