    "abstractText": "The work discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in medical image analysis and how the performance of these algorithms depends on the number of annotators and the quality of labels. To address the issue of subjectivity in labeling with a single annotator, we introduce a simple and effective approach that aggregates annotations from multiple annotators with varying levels of expertise. We then aim to improve the efficiency of predictive models in abnormal detection tasks by estimating hidden labels from multiple annotations and using a reweighted loss function to improve detection performance. Our method is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging dataset and outperforms relevant baselines that do not consider disagreements among annotators. This work1 has been accepted for publication by IEEE Access and its full form can be found in [7]. We also released the dataset and the code used in this study2.",

To address the issue of subjectivity in labeling with a single annotator, we introduce a simple and effective approach that aggregates annotations from multiple annotators with varying levels of expertise. We then aim to improve the efficiency of predictive models in abnormal detection tasks by estimating hidden labels from multiple annotations and using a reweighted loss function to improve detection performance. Our method is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging dataset and outperforms relevant baselines that do not consider disagreements among annotators. This work1 has been accepted for publication by IEEE Access and its full form can be found in [7]. We also released the dataset and the code used in this study2."

Unlike any approaches above, we aggregated annotations from multiple annotators and propose a re-weighted loss function that assigns more weights to more confident examples that determine by the consensus of multiple annotators. Figure 1 shows an overview of our method. Specifically, we first estimate the actual labels using WBF algorithm [28]. They are then used to train a typical object detector with a re-weighted loss function.\n1This is a short version submitted to the Midwest Machine Learning Symposium (MMLS 2023), Chicago, IL, USA.\n2https://vindr.ai/datasets/cxr.\nNote a general form of the loss function for those detectors can be written as\nL (p, p\u2217, t, t\u2217) = Lcls (p, p\u2217) + \u03b2I(t)Lloc (t, t\u2217)\nI(t) = { 1 if IoU {a, a\u2217} > \u03b7 0 otherwise.\n(1)\nwhere t and t\u2217 are the predicted and ground truth box coordinates, p and p\u2217 are the class category probabilities, respectively; IoU {a, a\u2217} denotes the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the anchor a and its ground truth a\u2217; \u03b7 is an IoU threshold for objectness, i.e. the confidence score of whether there is an object or not; \u03b2 is a constant for balancing two loss terms Lcls and Lloc [36]. We use fused boxes confidence scores cik obtained from WBF algorithm [28] to get a re-weighted loss function that emphasizes boxes with high annotators agreement. The new loss function can now be written as\nL (p, p\u2217, t, t\u2217) = cLcls (p, p\u2217) + c\u03b2I(t)Lloc (t, t\u2217) . (2)"

We compared the performance of the proposed method against (1) Baseline using all annotations as the ground truth; models trained on annotations provided by each annotator independently (Annotators #1, #2, #3) and (3) an ensemble of independent models trained on separate radiologists\u2019 annotation sets. Table 1 reports the experimental results in mAP@0.4 score. Our method outperforms the baselines, individual models, and even the ensemble of individual experts\u2019 models.

We empirically showed a notable improvement in terms of mAP scores by estimating the true labels and then integrating the implicit annotators\u2019 agreement into the loss function to emphasize the accurate bounding boxes over the imprecise ones. The idea is simple but effective, allowing the overall framework can be applied in training any machine learning-based detectors. However, the overall architecture is not end-to-end. It may not fully exploit the benefits of combining truth inference and training the desired image detector."
