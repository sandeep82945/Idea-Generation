1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effects of AITC, BITC, and PEITC on cell cycle progression and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.** This could be done by using techniques such as RNA sequencing and proteomics to identify the genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in response to treatment with these compounds.
2. **Evaluate the efficacy of AITC, BITC, and PEITC in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of bladder cancer.** This could be done in vitro using cell culture models and in vivo using animal models of bladder cancer.
3. **Investigate the potential of AITC, BITC, and PEITC to prevent the development of bladder cancer.** This could be done by administering these compounds to animals that are at high risk of developing bladder cancer and then monitoring the incidence of bladder cancer in these animals.
4. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AITC, BITC, and PEITC for the treatment of bladder cancer.** These trials could be designed to compare the efficacy of these compounds to standard chemotherapeutic agents or to placebo.
5. **Investigate the potential of AITC, BITC, and PEITC to improve the quality of life of bladder cancer patients.** This could be done by assessing the impact of these compounds on symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and depression.
