1. **Investigate the neuroprotective effects of picein in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases:** 
This could involve administering picein to animals with induced or naturally occurring neurodegenerative diseases and assessing its impact on disease progression, neuronal survival, and cognitive function.


2. **Explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of picein:** 
This could involve studying the effects of picein on various cellular pathways and signaling molecules known to be involved in neurodegeneration, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation.


3. **Evaluate the potential of picein to modulate neuroinflammation:** 
This could involve examining the effects of picein on the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the production of inflammatory mediators, and the expression of genes involved in inflammation.


4. **Investigate the effects of picein on the gut-brain axis in the context of neurodegenerative diseases:** 
This could involve studying the impact of picein on gut microbiota composition, intestinal permeability, and the production of metabolites that can influence brain function and neuroinflammation.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of picein in humans with neurodegenerative diseases:** 
This would involve administering picein to patients with neurodegenerative diseases and monitoring its effects on disease progression, cognitive function, and overall health.
