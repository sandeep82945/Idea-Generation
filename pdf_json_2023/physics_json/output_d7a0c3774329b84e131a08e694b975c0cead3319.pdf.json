    "abstractText": "22 23 Bispecific antibodies are a successful and expanding therapeutic class, bridging two cell-types 24 or engaging two different molecules on the same cell. Bispecifics unlock avenues towards 25 synergy, resistance evasion, and signaling bias. Standard approaches to generate bispecifics are 26 complicated by the need for disulfide reduction/oxidation or cloning of each binder molecule 27 in two different formats. Here we present a modular approach to bispecifics using 28 SpyTag/SpyCatcher spontaneous amidation, where all binders are cloned in the same format, 29 bearing a SpyTag. Two SpyTag-fused antigen-binding modules can be precisely conjugated 30 onto DoubleCatcher, a tandem SpyCatcher where the second Catcher is unreactive until 31 unveiling of reactivity using site-specific protease. Assembly on DoubleCatcher is efficient in 32 phosphate-buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C, with half-times less than 5 min for both SpyCatcher arms 33 and over 97% bispecific homogeneity. We engineer a panel of DoubleCatchers, locked through 34 disulfide bonds to direct binders to project in different directions from the hub. We establish a 35 generalized methodology for one-pot assembly and purification of bispecifics in 96-well plate 36 format. A panel of Fab, affibody or nanobody binders recognizing different sites on HER2 37 were coupled to DoubleCatcher, revealing unexpected combinations with anti-proliferative or 38 pro-proliferative activity on HER2-addicted cancer cells. Bispecific activity depended 39 sensitively on both the order of the binders within the assembly and the geometry of 40 DoubleCatcher scaffolds. These findings support the need for straightforward assembly in 41 different formats. SpyCombinator provides a simple and scalable tool to discover synergy in 42 bispecific activity, through modulating receptor organization and geometry. 43 44 45 Introduction 46",

Bispecifics unlock avenues towards 25 synergy, resistance evasion, and signaling bias. Standard approaches to generate bispecifics are 26 complicated by the need for disulfide reduction/oxidation or cloning of each binder molecule 27 in two different formats. Here we present a modular approach to bispecifics using 28 SpyTag/SpyCatcher spontaneous amidation, where all binders are cloned in the same format, 29 bearing a SpyTag. Two SpyTag-fused antigen-binding modules can be precisely conjugated 30 onto DoubleCatcher, a tandem SpyCatcher where the second Catcher is unreactive until 31 unveiling of reactivity using site-specific protease. Assembly on DoubleCatcher is efficient in 32 phosphate-buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C, with half-times less than 5 min for both SpyCatcher arms 33 and over 97% bispecific homogeneity. We engineer a panel of DoubleCatchers, locked through 34 disulfide bonds to direct binders to project in different directions from the hub. We establish a 35 generalized methodology for one-pot assembly and purification of bispecifics in 96-well plate 36 format. A panel of Fab, affibody or nanobody binders recognizing different sites on HER2 37 were coupled to DoubleCatcher, revealing unexpected combinations with anti-proliferative or 38 pro-proliferative activity on HER2-addicted cancer cells. Bispecific activity depended 39 sensitively on both the order of the binders within the assembly and the geometry of 40 DoubleCatcher scaffolds. These findings support the need for straightforward assembly in 41 different formats. SpyCombinator provides a simple and scalable tool to discover synergy in 42 bispecific activity, through modulating receptor organization and geometry. 43 44 45 Introduction 46 47 Bispecific antibodies are biological matchmakers, bringing together two different target 48 molecules or two different parts of the same target (Hofmann et al., 2020). Bispecifics have 49\nhad clinical success in cancer therapy by directing cytotoxic T cells to cancer-specific antigens 50 (Hofmann et al., 2020). There are also approved bispecific therapeutics that bridge proteins on 51 the surface of the same cell (Labrijn et al., 2019; Vijayaraghavan et al., 2020). Cell signaling 52 often naturally depends on co-localization of particular ligands at the cell-surface (Batada et 53 al., 2006). Synthetic control of such signaling has been successful using bifunctional small 54 molecules (Zheng et al., 2022), DNA nanostructures (Shaw et al., 2014), and non-antibody 55 protein-based binders (Mohan et al., 2019). The response of the cell is often exquisitely 56 sensitive to the timing and spatial orientation of this bridging between surface targets (Moraga 57 et al., 2015). Therefore, despite the numerous successes from bispecifics, there remains a huge 58 range of unexplored combinations of bispecifics that could illuminate the principles of cell 59 signaling and provide valuable therapeutic leads. It is an exciting challenge in protein 60 engineering to facilitate the screening of bispecific combinations. 61 The most common routes to generate bispecifics depend upon rearrangement of IgG 62 architecture, particularly through knob-into-hole generation of heterodimeric Fc domains 63 (Spiess et al., 2013), or disulfide bond shuffling in the Fabs (Dengl et al., 2020; Labrijn et al., 64 2013). Alternative bispecific pairing has been achieved by conjugating the two binders using 65 sortase (Andres et al., 2020), transglutaminase (Plagmann et al., 2009), click chemistry (Szijj 66 and Chudasama, 2021) or split inteins (Han et al., 2017). However, these routes require each 67 binder to be fused to the respective conjugation domain, such that each binder must be re-68 cloned, re-expressed, and re-purified in two formats to explore all possible bispecific 69 combinations. Such a requirement is a major problem as the field moves towards exploring 70 thousands of binders across the proteome (Cao et al., 2022; Colwill et al., 2011; D\u00fcbel et al., 71 2010). 72 Our group previously developed an efficient way to ligate genetically-encoded building blocks, 73 through spontaneous isopeptide bond formation between a peptide Tag and a complementary 74 Catcher protein (Keeble and Howarth, 2020; Keeble et al., 2022). SpyTag/SpyCatcher has 75 been widely used for modular assembly of binders, enzymes and vaccines (Keeble and 76 Howarth, 2020; Pardee et al., 2014). SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003 is a pair that we subsequently 77 developed for reaction at a rate close to the diffusion limit, which maintains compatibility with 78 all previous Spy versions (Keeble et al., 2019). SpyTag/SpyCatcher has been previously 79 employed for bispecific assembly but faces the above limitation of having to clone each binder 80 in two different formats, with one version fused to SpyTag and the other version fused to 81 SpyCatcher (Chen et al., 2022; Keeble et al., 2022; Sutherland et al., 2019). In this work we 82 establish a protease-activatable SpyCatcher003, to enable the generation of bispecific 83 combinations where each binder only needs to be cloned into one common format \u2013 the 84 SpyCombinator strategy. We show that binders can be assembled onto a panel of scaffolds, in 85 order for the binders to project in different directions and change the orientation of the target 86 receptor. We evaluate the SpyCombinator system against human epidermal growth factor 87 receptor 2 (HER2), which has a central role in breast, gastric, and ovarian cancers through 88 proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling (Scholl et al., 2001). Employing SpyCombinator on 89 a panel of 9 binders (affibody, nanobody or antibodies) allowed simple generation of 81 binder 90 pairs against HER2 (9 with bivalent and 72 with bispecific binding activity). In order to 91 demonstrate the mutability of our modular bispecific assembly approach, DoubleCatcher 92 scaffolds that vary in dimensional architecture and rigidity were designed by modifying the 93 linker separating Catcher domains, or by introducing an intramolecular disulfide bond. Again, 94 SpyCombinator was applied to dimerize a subset of 9 pairs of anti-HER2 binders using the 95 panel of 7 DoubleCatcher variants, to generate 63 bivalent binders spanning a diverse format 96 space. These pairs of binders show major differences in their effect on cell survival and 97 division, illustrating the potential of the SpyCombinator approach to accelerate combinatorial 98 discovery and fine-tune cellular responses to designed receptor modulators. 99\n100 Results 101 102 Masked SpyCatcher003 is a protease-activatable variant of SpyCatcher003 103 Our approach uses a tandem SpyCatcher003 for specific irreversible heterodimerization of any 104 two antigen-binding units fused to SpyTag or its variants (i.e. SpyTag002 or SpyTag003) (Fig. 105 1A). The N-terminal SpyCatcher003 is accessible for reaction. The C-terminal SpyCatcher003 106 is masked. The non-reactive SpyTag003 D117A (SpyTag003DA) mutant (Keeble et al., 2019) 107 is fused to the C-terminus of the second SpyCatcher003 via a flexible linker containing a 108 tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (ENLYFQ/G) (Fig. 1A). Before cleavage, 109 SpyTag003DA should bind tightly to SpyCatcher003, with Kd = 21 nM for the non-linked pair 110 (Keeble et al., 2019), thus masking the reactive Lys of SpyCatcher003. The intramolecular 111 SpyCatcher003/SpyTag003DA interaction should be entropically favored over a competing 112 intermolecular interaction with SpyTag003 in solution. Following cleavage at the TEV site, 113 the SpyTag003DA peptide will be free to dissociate, unmasking the reactive Lys of 114 SpyCatcher003 to enable reaction with a second supplied SpyTag-linked binder. We performed 115 all cleavages with superTEV protease, because of its efficient activity without the need for 116 reductant (Cabrita et al., 2007). 117 We piloted the SpyCombinator strategy on a single SpyCatcher003 moiety. Masked 118 SpyCatcher003 was cleaved with superTEV protease and incubated with a model fusion 119 protein of SpyTag003 linked to maltose-binding protein (MBP) (Fig. 1B). This reaction 120 proceeded efficiently to > 99% completion, with a half-life of reaction (t1/2) of 2.7 \u00b1 0.7 min 121 (Fig. 1B, C, D). To reduce the extent to which SpyTag003DA dissociation limits the rate of 122 reaction between TEV-cleaved Masked SpyCatcher003 with SpyTag003-MBP, the reaction 123 temperature was elevated to 37 \u00b0C and the molar excess of SpyTag003-MBP relative to Masked 124 SpyCatcher003 was increased to 5-fold. The muted reactivity of Masked SpyCatcher003 before 125 cleavage was probed by incubating equimolar amounts of the construct with SpyTag003-MBP 126 and monitoring the disappearance of Masked SpyCatcher003 over time by SDS-PAGE and 127 densitometry (Fig. 1D, E). Under these conditions, we observed 3.7% reaction of Masked 128 SpyCatcher003 with SpyTag003-MBP after 60 min, supporting effective silencing of 129 SpyCatcher003 reactivity. 130 131 Establishing DoubleCatcher as a tool for controlled combination of distinct proteins 132 To design a platform that facilitates the conjugation of two Tagged proteins, Masked 133 SpyCatcher003 was genetically fused to the C-terminus of a native SpyCatcher003 protein via 134 a flexible Gly/Ser linker, to give DoubleCatcher (Fig. 2A, with sequence shown in 135 Supplementary Fig. 1). The reactivity of each SpyCatcher003 moiety within the DoubleCatcher 136 construct was determined by monitoring the reaction of DoubleCatcher with SpyTag003-137 linked model proteins before and after cleavage by MBP-superTEV protease. First, 138 DoubleCatcher was incubated with 2-fold excess of SpyTag003 linked to the green fluorescent 139 protein mClover3 in the absence of TEV protease (Fig. 2A, B). 91% reactivity of the N-140 terminal SpyCatcher003 was observed after 1 h, with a t1/2 of 0.58 \u00b1 0.05 min (Fig. 2C). 141 Next we incubated DoubleCatcher with two-fold excess SpyTag003-MBP for 2 h to 142 saturate the N-terminal SpyCatcher003 moiety. Unreacted SpyTag003-MBP was removed 143 from the reaction mixture by overnight incubation with bead-immobilized SpyCatcher003. 144 Addition of superTEV protease to the crude mixture (4 h, 34 \u00b0C) induced cleavage of the 145 SpyTag003DA mask from the C-terminal SpyCatcher003 (Fig. 2D). 2 \u00b5M of the cleaved 146 construct was then reacted with a 5-fold molar excess of SpyTagged Small Ubiquitin-like 147 Modifier (SUMO-SpyTag003) and the reaction was monitored over time, by SDS-PAGE and 148 densitometry (Fig. 2E, F). Reaction to fill the second site of DoubleCatcher was rapid with t1/2 149\nof 3.6 \u00b1 0.7 min, showing that the cleaved SpyTag003DA can be efficiently replaced by a 150 reactive Tag. 151\nEstablishment of scalable heterodimerization of proteins using SpyCombinator 184 A universal bispecific assembly platform for high-throughput screening requires a simple and 185 scalable methodology. In particular, procedures involving multiple rounds of column 186 chromatography will provide a bottleneck to the combinatorial complexity of bispecifics that 187 can be interrogated. Therefore, we next sought to optimize a one-pot reaction in which any two 188 Tagged binders can be conjugated to DoubleCatcher (Fig. 3A), and the resulting bispecific 189 molecule can be purified (Fig. 3B). For optimization, model ligands were assembled onto 190 DoubleCatcher: these were a SpyTag construct linked to three tandemly-repeated affibodies 191 against HER2 (SpyTag-AfiiHER23, ligand A) and SpyTag003 linked to a high stability MBP 192 tandem fusion ((MBPX)2-SpyTag003, ligand B) (Veggiani et al., 2016). These ligands lack free 193 Cys (avoiding impurity from inter-ligand disulfides) and have a difference in mass that permits 194 unambiguous detection of reactant and product bands by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The intact 195 masses of these purified reactants in PBS pH 7.4 were validated by electrospray-ionization 196 mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 2). 197 In step 1 of our one-pot assembly route, DoubleCatcher reacts with a small molar excess 198 (1.25-fold) of SpyTag-AffiHER23, to ensure negligible unreacted DoubleCatcher in solution 199 (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE revealed 97% of the reaction contained the desired singly-occupied 200 DoubleCatcher:SpyTag-AffiHER23 species (Fig. 3C, lane DC + A). As observed for Masked 201 SpyCatcher003 reactivity tests (Fig. 1D), 3% contained DoubleCatcher conjugated to two 202 SpyTag-AffiHER23 molecules (Fig. 3C). To confirm where the homodimeric 203 DoubleCatcher:(SpyTag-AffiHER23)2 would run, we added superTEV protease (1/12th molar 204 equivalent) to the crude mixture; the homodimer in the reaction mixture increased to 30% (\u2018DC 205 + A + TEV\u2019 lane in Fig. 3C). The identity of this by-product was corroborated by the increase 206 in the density of the band corresponding to AffiHER23 homodimer in a control reaction 207 containing twice the concentration of SpyTag003-AffiHER23 (\u2018DC + A + TEV + A\u2019 lane in 208 Fig. 3C). 209 For subsequent unmasking and saturation of the C-terminal SpyCatcher003 moiety, 210 superTEV protease (1/12th molar equivalent) and (MBPX)2-SpyTag003 (5-fold molar excess, 211 \u2018B\u2019) were added simultaneously to the singly saturated DoubleCatcher (Step 2, Fig. 3A). Thus, 212 immediately upon cleavage of SpyTag003DA, the concentration of (MBPX)2-SpyTag003 in 213 solution should be 20 times that of unreacted SpyTag-AffiHER23 and so homodimer formation 214 is minimized. Indeed, AffiHER23 homodimer accounted for only 3% of the total species in the 215 reaction mixture (\u2018DC + A + TEV + B\u2019 in Fig. 3C). Trace (3%) formation of DoubleCatcher 216 conjugated to two (MBPX)2-SpyTag003 molecules (\u2018MBP homodimer\u2019) was observed by SDS-217 PAGE, validated by the formation of a band of equivalent mobility in a reaction with 218 DoubleCatcher, superTEV protease and (MBPX)2-SpyTag003 alone (\u2018DC + B + TEV + B\u2019 lane 219 in Fig. 3C). 220 For depletion of excess SpyTag- or SpyTag003-linked binder from the desired product, 221 the crude reaction mixture was incubated with bead-immobilized SpyCatcher003, by adding 222 beads in a 1:1 suspension with PBS directly to the reaction mixture (Step 3, Fig. 3A and Fig. 223 3B). The purity of DoubleCatcher:SpyTag-AffiHER23:(MBPX)2-SpyTag003 following 224 purification was assessed by SDS-PAGE densitometry as 95% (excluding superTEV protease) 225 (Purification lane in Fig. 3C). Based on SDS-PAGE, superTEV protease (70 kDa, Fig. 3D, E) 226 was the major contaminant. Since TEV protease has exceptional specificity for its target 227 sequence, which is not found in the human proteome, and has been expressed before without 228 effect on cells (Gray et al., 2010), we did not consider it necessary to remove. However, it 229 should also be possible to add amylose-agarose to the well, for depletion of the MBP-linked 230 superTEV protease, if considered helpful. 231 We also validated the bispecific assembly by mass photometry, allowing single 232 molecule-based assessment of each species in solution (Asor and Kukura, 2022). The peak 233\ncorresponding to DoubleCatcher:SpyTag-AffiHER23:(MBPX)2-SpyTag003 was observed with 234 a mass of 144 kDa, matching well to the 144.6 kDa predicted mass (Fig. 3D). The second peak 235 of 70 kDa, fitted well to MBP-superTEV protease (Fig. 3D), as validated by running MBP-236 superTEV protease on its own (Fig. 3E). 237\nAnti-HER2 bispecifics assembled by SpyCombinator induce various anti-proliferative or 249 proliferative effects in HER2-addicted cancer cells 250 The work presented above demonstrates the efficient assembly of bispecific ligands through 251 DoubleCatcher. We then aimed to complement the SpyCombinator platform with a screening 252 approach of equal throughput on binders against the important cell-surface target of HER2. 253 The relative activity of each signaling pathway and downstream physiological outcome has 254 been attributed to different ligands stabilizing receptor dimers in distinct conformations, 255 inducing distinct phosphorylation of the 17 sites in HER2\u2019s intracellular domain (Freed et al., 256 2017). Although the functional selectivity of native Receptor Tyrosine Kinase ligands has been 257 extensively studied, this bias is yet to be exploited for personalized cancer therapies. Thus, we 258 sought to assemble a large matrix of anti-HER2 bispecifics which differ in format and screen 259 for their ability to alter HER2 activity (Brack et al., 2014; St\u00fcber et al., 2021). Binders specific 260 to each subdomain of the HER2 extracellular region were identified (Fig. 4A, B), including 261 Fabs based on the clinically used Pertuzumab (\u2018Pert\u2019) and Trastuzumab (\u2018Tras\u2019, known 262 commercially as Herceptin). Tras is a Trastuzumab variant with a point mutation to enhance 263 binding stability (Jain et al., 2013). Each binder was expressed as a SpyTag003-fusion in 264 Expi293F cells, except the nanobody (nanoHER2) (Verheije et al., 2013) and affibody 265 (AffiHER2) (Feldwisch et al., 2010) which were expressed in E. coli. We confirmed the 266 identity of each binder using electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 267 3). Fusions to SpyTag are conventionally expressed with a spacer to favor high reactivity with 268 SpyCatcher and optimal activity of the fused domain (Keeble and Howarth, 2019). We 269 expressed a variant of Tras with no linker to SpyTag003, to test the importance of linker 270 flexibility on activity, termed Tras NoLink. The NoLink variant was confirmed to react to 97% 271 in 60 min in PBS pH 7.4 at 37 \u00b0C with DoubleCatcher, an efficiency comparable to the linker-272 containing parental construct (99% in 60 min under equivalent reaction conditions; 273 Supplementary Fig. 4), confirming that reactivity is not impaired by removing the linker 274 between the Fab and the reactive peptide. Each binder was dimerized with itself or another 275 binder using SpyCombinator methodology (Fig. 3A). We studied the effects of the resulting 276 matrix of anti-HER2 bispecifics and homodimers on metabolic activity in HER2-addicted 277 BT474 cells (a human ductal breast carcinoma cell-line) or SKBR3 cells (a human 278 adenocarcinoma cell-line), quantifying using the resazurin assay (St\u00fcber et al., 2021). 279 Following incubation of BT474 or SKBR3 cells with anti-HER2 bispecific assemblies 280 (100 nM) for 96 h, the change in metabolic activity was calculated relative to untreated cells 281 (Fig. 4C, D). We discovered that the different assemblies exhibited a range of antagonistic and 282 agonistic activities. We found that bispecific constructs displaying one or more arm binding to 283 domain II (39S, HFS2, or Pert) are consistently anti-proliferative. 284 Anti-HER2 bispecifics also showed different potencies in SKBR3 cells relative to 285 BT474 cells. Firstly, a higher number of bispecifics had significant proliferative activity in 286 BT474 (20 constructs) than in SKBR3 (10 constructs). Secondly, constructs with significant 287 anti-proliferative activity were more potent in BT474 (average metabolic activity of significant 288 antagonists = 58.4 \u00b1 20.4%) than in SKBR3 (average metabolic activity of significant 289 antagonists = 64.2 \u00b1 7.0%). In BT474 cells, the potent antagonist Tras NoLink-Tras (74.1 \u00b1 290 6% (BT474) metabolic activity after 96 h treatment) showed no activity when assembled in the 291 opposite orientation: Tras-Tras NoLink (103 \u00b1 1% for BT474 metabolic activity). Importantly, 292 the same orientation-dependence was observed in SKBR3 cells for the significantly active 293 bispecifics nanoHER2-HFS2, Tras-AffiHER2, nanoHER2-AffiHER2, MF3958-Tras NoLink, 294 Tras-39S, 39-Tras NoLink, Tras-MF3958; where assembly of these binders in the opposite 295 orientation removes their significant agonistic or antagonistic activity. 296 297\nExamining the effect of removing the linker between binder and SpyTag003, the average 313 difference between bispecifics with at least one Fab0.11 versus at least one Tras NoLink was 314 only 2%. The similarity between the activities of Tras and Tras NoLink supports the usage of 315 linker-free binder-SpyTag fusions in future screens, where it will be beneficial to maximize 316 rigidity in the bispecific molecule and impart control over target geometries. Together, these 317 results highlight the importance of screening epitope-diverse bispecific binders in multiple 318 formats and orientations. 319 320 DoubleCatcher architecture can be customized 321 As with most bispecific antibodies, the format of a bispecific binder built using SpyCombinator 322 may be influenced by the identity of the SpyTag003-linked binder, and by the order in which 323 the binders are coupled. However, the overall shape, size, and flexibility of the bispecific 324 molecule may also be determined by the DoubleCatcher module itself. To amplify the format 325 space to be screened, matrices of bispecific antibodies could therefore be developed in three 326 dimensions: varying two binder arms against the targets of interest and, in parallel, varying the 327 DoubleCatcher module. The highest-scoring AlphaFold2-predicted structure for 328 DoubleCatcher is displayed in Fig. 5A (left), with the position and orientation (N to C) of the 329 two SpyTag binding sites represented by cyan vectors. Modifications to the DoubleCatcher 330 architecture that change the relative spacing and orientation of the cyan vectors will reflect 331 changes in the structural relationship between the two target-binding arms in the final 332 bispecific. 333 Modifications to the architecture of DoubleCatcher may be achieved by varying the 334 linker connecting the two SpyCatcher003 moieties. The amenability of DoubleCatcher to 335 linker modification was tested by substituting the Gly/Ser linker with the central helix from the 336 Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal protein L9 (Kuhlman et al., 1997). The DoubleCatcher 337 variant with the helical linker is termed \u2018DoubleCatcher H-lock\u2019 (Fig. 5A, right, and sequence 338 in Supplementary Fig. 1). Size-exclusion chromatography analysis of Ni-NTA-purified 339 DoubleCatcher H-lock revealed its apparent molecular mass was 17 kDa larger than 340 DoubleCatcher (Fig. 5D, E), while the predicted increase in mass is only 3.5 kDa, as validated 341 by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 2). 342 One approach to increasing the rigidity of the DoubleCatcher module that overcomes 343 the flexibility of the SpyCatcher003 termini is to engineer a covalent linkage between the two 344 Catcher domains. A pair of residues (one residue from each SpyCatcher003) that reside in loop 345 regions and close proximity (1.2 nm) within each of the the five highest-confidence predicted 346 structures of DoubleCatcher was chosen as the site for cysteine substitution to engineer a 347 SpyCatcher003-SpyCatcher003 intramolecular disulfide bond. The AlphaFold2-predicted 348 structure of the double-cysteine variant designed from the top-predicted DoubleCatcher 349 structure is presented in Fig. 5B and is termed \u2018DoubleCatcher \u237a-lock\u2019. The substantially less 350 variable average distance between N\u03b5 of the reactive Lys residues of each SpyCatcher003 in 351 the top 5 AlphaFold2-predicted structures of DoubleCatcher \u237a-lock (4.7 \u00b1 0.04 nm) suggests 352 the two SpyCatcher003s may have low relative mobility. The DoubleCatcher double-cysteine 353 variants designed from the four remaining predicted structures of DoubleCatcher are presented 354 in Fig. 5C. Therefore, the combination of SpyTagged antigen binders using these 355 DoubleCatcher variants should provide conformationally distinct bispecific binders that bind 356 targets in different orientations. 357 Size-exclusion chromatography profiles of Ni-NTA-purified double-cysteine DoubleCatcher 358 variants reveal that the construct exists as two species: one main peak corresponding to 359 monomer and one minor peak that corresponds to covalent dimer (Fig. 5D). 360 361\nDoubleCatcher double-cysteine monomer was incubated with CuSO4 to drive disulfide bond 377 formation prior to downstream analyses. The identity and disulfide bond formation of each 378 DoubleCatcher was validated by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (Supplementary 379 Fig. 2). The DoubleCatcher variants were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 380 5F), with quantification shown in Fig. 5G. As expected, both the mean hydrodynamic radius 381 (Rh) and the mean s.d. of the double-cysteine mutants (3.5 \u00b1 1.0 nm, mean \u00b1 1 s.d., n = 10) 382 were less than those for the cysteine-free variants (4.5 \u00b1 1.7 nm, mean \u00b1 1 s.d., n = 10), 383 consistent with reduced flexibility within the architecture. 384 385 SpyCombinator-assembled anti-HER2 bispecific binders are sensitive to DoubleCatcher 386 architecture 387 To investigate the sensitivity of HER2 signaling to dimer geometry, a small-scale matrix of 388 anti-HER2 bispecific binders was assembled by using each of the 7 designed DoubleCatcher 389 variants to dimerize Tras NoLink, nanoHER2, and AffiHER2 in all 9 possible permutations. 390 The assembled bispecific binders were added to HER2-addicted SKBR3 cells (100 nM) for 96 391 h, after which the change in metabolic activity was calculated (Fig. 6A, B). For each pair of 392 binders, cells were treated with a mixture of the purified binders (100 nM) without 393 DoubleCatcher, to test for monovalent binder activity- \u2018No DC\u2019 matrix in Fig. 6A. 394 Simultaneously, purified DoubleCatcher variants (100 nM) were added to cells, to test for any 395 activity of scaffold alone (Fig. 6A). 396 In a similar way to the orientation-dependent activity of bispecifics assembled in Figure 397 4, we repeatedly found that the potency of specific combinations of binders were enhanced 398 when assembled onto a different DoubleCatcher variant. The most pronounced example of this 399 is for the pro-proliferative DoubleCatcher \u03b2-lock bispecifics containing nanoHER2: relative to 400 the DoubleCatcher-assembled bispecifics, those assembled with DoubleCatcher \u03b2-Lock 401 induced +25.6 % greater proliferation in SKBR3 cells. Similarly, the anti-proliferative activity 402 of Tras NL-Tras NL (84.8 \u00b1 6.8% metabolic activity for the DoubleCatcher-assembled 403 bispecific) was enhanced when dimerized with DoubleCatcher H-Lock (75.9 \u00b1 2.5%), 404 DoubleCatcher \u237a-Lock (79.5 \u00b1 3.9%), DoubleCatcher \u03b3-Lock (80.4 \u00b1 3.4%), DoubleCatcher 405 \ud835\udeff-Lock (73.6 \u00b1 4.9%), and DoubleCatcher \u03b5-Lock (72.5 \u00b1 4.3%). In addition to increased 406 potency, it was also observed that the ability of some pairs of binders to either agonize or 407 antagonize HER2 signaling was switched when assembled into a different architecture. 408 Specifically, the bispecific AffiHER2-Tras NoLink showed mild agonistic activity on the 409 DoubleCatcher scaffold (112.5 \u00b1 6.6% metabolic activity), yet the same bispecific assembled 410 using DoubleCatcher H-Lock exhibited strong antagonistic activity under the same conditions 411 (82.5 \u00b1 11.1%). The same switch in activity was even more marked for Tras NoLink-AffiHER2 412 assembled in DoubleCatcher \u03b3-Lock (78.6 \u00b1 3.1 %) relative to DoubleCatcher (127.7 \u00b1 4.1%), 413 accentuating the value of screening multiple formats in the assembly of bispecifics. 414 415 Discussion 416 Here we have demonstrated SpyCombinator assembly, allowing controlled and precise 417 construction of bispecific binders through sequential SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation. The 418 SpyCombinator platform offers a plug-and-play approach in which the antigen-binding 419 building blocks exist in a common format, fused to the commonly-employed SpyTag peptide 420 or its subsequent generations (Keeble and Howarth, 2020; Keeble et al., 2019). Unlike standard 421 approaches to bispecific assembly (Hofmann et al., 2020), SpyCombinator eliminates the need 422 to clone and express each pair of binding proteins into more than one format. Neither SpyTag 423 nor SpyCatcher require any cysteines and the overall assembly is ligated through amide bonds 424 (Keeble and Howarth, 2020), so SpyCombinator avoids the careful optimization and instability 425 that may arise from bispecific assembly relying on disulfide bond reduction and oxidation. 426\n439 Optimization of SpyCombinator conditions produced a generalized pipeline that generates 440 bispecifics with up to 97% purity relative to homodimeric by-products. The modularity of the 441 platform invites customization of each constituent, exemplified here through DoubleCatcher 442 variants with different linkers or intramolecular disulfide bonds. There is potential in future 443 work for substantial diversification of the DoubleCatcher module, to generate additional 444 bispecific architectures (Baker, 2019). 445 In this study, anti-HER2 binders varying in epitope and size were permuted into a 446 matrix of bispecifics. We identified anti-HER2 bispecifics with major differences in their pro- 447 or anti-proliferative activity. Interestingly, this proliferative activity depended not only on the 448 identity of the anti-HER2 monomers, but also on the order of coupling to DoubleCatcher, 449 affirming the importance of screening paratope orientation (Scheer et al., 2012; St\u00fcber et al., 450 2021). Furthermore, in assembling a small panel of anti-HER2 binders into bispecifics using 451 DoubleCatchers of varying geometries and flexibilities, we found that the activity or potency 452 of particular pairs of binders is dependent on their scaffold. Cellular effects of bispecific 453 bridging depend upon an intricate balance of allosteric interactions between intracellular kinase 454 domains (Zhang et al., 2006), altered heterodimer formation with other receptors (Gu et al., 455 2014), and receptor dynamics at the plasma membrane or endolysosomal compartments 456 (Scheer et al., 2012; St\u00fcber et al., 2021). Therefore, being able to screen large numbers of 457 bispecific combinations in multiple formats is crucial to the discovery of the most potent 458 effector activity. HER2 dimerization is facilitated predominantly by interactions between 459 domain II residues (Arkhipov et al., 2013), so these bispecifics are likely to block HER2 460 dimerization and activation. Conversely, bispecifics harboring the small, non-domain II 461 binders nanoHER2 (16 kDa) or AffiHER2 (15 kDa) display potent proliferative activity. 462 Indeed, the bispecific constructs with significant agonistic activity in both SKBR3 and BT474 463 cells all comprised at least one of nanoHER2 or AffiHER2. Where agonistic activity of 464 biparatopic anti-HER2 molecules has been observed, it has been suggested to result from 465 favouring HER2 homodimerization over heterodimerization, or from a shorter distance 466 between antigen-binding sites (Gu et al., 2014; Kast et al., 2021; Scheer et al., 2012). 467 Considering their small size, DoubleCatchers coupled to either nanoHER2 or AffiHER2 may 468 bridge HER2 molecules close enough for trans-phosphorylation by HER2 kinase domains. 469 This result may be explained by the differential total expression of HER2, as well as the 470 expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and HER3 relative to HER2. BT474 471 expresses HER2 to a greater extent (~2.8 \u00d7 106 copies per cell) (Kamashev et al., 2022) relative 472 to SKBR3 (~1.2 \u00d7 106 copies) (Hendriks et al., 2013). Both express HER3 to a similar level 473 (1-1.2 \u00d7 106 copies) but SKBR3 expresses ~3-fold more EGFR (2.2 \u00d7 105 copies) than BT474 474 (7 \u00d7 104 copies) (Brockhoff et al., 2001). HER2-HER3 dimerization mediates activation of 475 PI3K/Akt and proliferation axis (Junttila et al., 2009), while HER2-EGFR dimers favor 476 MAPK/ERK and pro-survival signaling (Kirouac et al., 2016). Therefore, for bispecifics 477 preventing HER2 homodimerization but not occluding domain II of HER2 (for example, 478 domain I-binding H2-18 or MF3958), heterodimerization may occurs more favorably. This 479 could result in a higher frequency of proliferative HER2-HER3 dimers in BT474 than SKBR3. 480 Differences in activities of anti-HER2 bispecifics have been attributed to the 481 architecture of the molecule, in addition to binder identity. Specifically, this includes the 482 binder\u2019s ability to oligomerize HER2 monomers, resulting in arrested receptor diffusion 483 compartmentalization into membrane nanodomains (St\u00fcber et al., 2021); the binder-defined 484 distance between cross-linked HER2 molecules (Kast et al., 2021); the distortion of HER2 485 extracellular domain upon binding, such that its ability to homo/hetero-dimerize is affected 486 (Gu et al., 2014); and the amenability of the binder\u2019s format to increased bispecific-HER2 487 complex stoichiometries (Brack et al., 2014). Our DoubleCatcher panel introduces variation in 488\nrelative paratope orientation, distance between paratopes, and scaffold rigidity. We 489 hypothesize that these parameters and their combinations each influence HER2 dynamics by 490 one or more of the mechanisms highlighted. However, further experiments are required to 491 decipher their biochemical behaviours, such as employing BRET to study homo- vs. hetero-492 dimer formation (Siddiqui et al., 2013), single-particle tracking analysis to quantify changes in 493 receptor diffusion kinetics (Freed et al., 2017), or nanoparticle-aided cryo-electron microscopy 494 to gain insight into the conformational homogeneity, and thus rigidity, of different 495 SpyCombinator-assembled bispecific molecules (Ki et al., 2021). 496 Control over Tag/Catcher activity has previously been achieved using pH (Vester et al., 497 2022), redox (Matsunaga et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2018), temperature (Cao et al., 2017), or light 498 (Hartzell et al., 2021; Ruskowitz et al., 2023). While these switches have an array of valuable 499 applications, the simple generation and large change in reactivity of the protease-uncaging 500 system is advantageous for bispecific assembly. In particular, redox changes on the Catcher 501 would be undesirable for assembling building blocks that themselves contain disulfides, 502 notably nanobodies and various peptide hormones. A potential limitation of SpyCombinator is 503 that SpyTag/SpyCatcher is derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, so immunogenicity may 504 affect the use of DoubleCatcher bispecifics as clinical candidates (Rahikainen et al., 2021). 505 Nonetheless, Catcher bispecifics can be important leads to inform the design of biologics and 506 identify novel targets/epitopes for next generation therapeutics. Also, many factors other than 507 being non-self contribute to the immunogenicity of therapeutics (Yachnin et al., 2021), e.g. 508 bacterially-derived non-immunoglobulin scaffolds such as affibodies have shown promising 509 results for sustained therapy in clinical trials (Klint et al., 2023). 510 A major effort is under way to generate recombinant binders to the entire human 511 proteome (Cao et al., 2022; Colwill et al., 2011; D\u00fcbel et al., 2010). The data here and 512 elsewhere clearly illustrate how one binder is not enough and multiple binders to different 513 regions of a target are valuable (Kast et al., 2021). Therefore, with an arsenal of tens of 514 thousands of binders, methods such as SpyCombinator to screen the bispecific possibilities will 515 accelerate the understanding and application of synergy for modulating cell signaling. 516 Increasing numbers of functional proteins have been SpyTagged (Hentrich et al., 2021; Keeble 517 and Howarth, 2019; Kellmann et al., 2023), allowing purification (Khairil Anuar et al., 2019; 518 Vester et al., 2022), immobilization (Wang et al., 2020), multimerization (Brune and Howarth, 519 2018) and networking to other molecular functionalities (Keeble and Howarth, 2020). Beyond 520 proteins, SpyTag/SpyCatcher has been functionalized with nucleic acids (Kr\u00f6ll et al., 2022), 521 oligosaccharides (Li et al., 2022) or small molecules (Geissinger et al., 2020), which will allow 522 modular assembly of bispecifics with more diverse activities. We anticipate applications of 523 SpyCombinator beyond cell signaling, such as enhancing the recruitment of stem cells for 524 tissue repair (Cousens et al., 2009) or optimizing enzyme networks for catalysis (Wei et al., 525 2020). 526 527 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 528 A.H.K. and M.H. were funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 529 (BBSRC BB/S007369/1).

KU296976) (Addgene 562 deposition in progress) (Veggiani et al., 2016) have been described. pET28a-SUMO-563 SpyTag003 (N-terminal His6 tag-SUMO protein-SpyTag003) was cloned previously by Irsyad 564 Khairil Anuar (University of Oxford) (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress). 565 pDEST14-SpyCatcher003-TEVs-SpyTag003DA (\u2018Masked SpyCatcher0003\u2019; N-terminal His6 566 tag-SpyCatcher003-TEV protease cleavage site-SpyTag003 D117A, GenBank and Addgene 567 deposition in progress) was derived from pDEST14-SpyCatcher003 (GenBank Accession no. 568 MN433887, Addgene plasmid ID 133447) by incorporating the TEV protease cleavage site 569 (ENLYFQ/G) and SpyTag003 D117A (RGVPHIVMVAAYKRYK) (Keeble et al., 2019) by 570 Gibson assembly. pDEST14-SpyCatcher003-(GSG)3-SpyCatcher003-TEVs-SpyTag003DA 571 (DoubleCatcher; N-terminal His6 tag-TEV protease cleavage site-two SpyCatcher003 moieties 572 connected by a (GSG)3 spacer-TEV protease cleavage site-SpyTag003 DA, GenBank and 573 Addgene deposition in progress) was synthesized as a gene fragment (Integrated DNA 574 Technologies) and inserted into pDEST14. The Gly/Ser spacer in this construct was then 575 replaced with an \u237a-helical spacer (sequence 576 PANLKALEAQKQKEQRQAAEELANAKKLKEQLEK) (Kuhlman et al., 1997), and this 577 construct was termed DoubleCatcher H-Lock (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress). 578 Double-cysteine substitution variants of DoubleCatcher were derived from pDEST14-579 SpyCatcher003-(GSG)3-SpyCatcher003-TEVs-SpyTag003DA by Gibson assembly: 580 DoubleCatcher \u03b1-Lock (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress), DoubleCatcher \u03b2-581 Lock (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress), DoubleCatcher \u03b3-Lock (GenBank and 582 Addgene deposition in progress), DoubleCatcher \u03b4-Lock (GenBank and Addgene deposition 583 in progress), and DoubleCatcher \u03b5-Lock (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress). 584 pET28a-MBPX-MBPX-SpyTag003 (His6-MBPX-SSSGGSGGGSG linker-MBPX-SpyTag003; 585 GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress), where MBPX is a variant of MBP with stronger 586 maltose binding (Veggiani et al., 2016), was cloned by Dr Henry Wood (University of Oxford). 587 pcDNA3.1-Tras heavy chain-GSG-SpyTag003 (\u2018Tras\u2019), pcDNA3.1-Tras heavy chain-588\nSpyTag003 (\u2018Tras NoLink\u2019) and pcDNA3.1-Tras light chain (GenBank and Addgene 589 deposition in progress) were cloned previously by Jamie Lam (University of Oxford) from 590 previous constructs in pOPIN, which have been described (Vester et al., 2022). 591 Sequences for the heavy and light chains of anti-HER2 Fabs were synthesized (Twist 592 Bioscience) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid: 39S (Oganesyan et al., 2018), MF3958 593 (Geuijen et al., 2018), H2-18 (Hu et al., 2015), HFS2 (Salimi et al., 2018) and Pert (Gennaro 594 et al., 2014). Each Fab heavy chain had the final assembly: N-terminal signal peptide-Heavy 595 variable domain-Human IgG1 CH1 domain-EPKSC IgG1 upper hinge region residues-596 SpyTag003-His6 tag, with the exception of HSF2 whose CH1 domain was of mouse origin, and 597 Pert for which the hinge region was omitted (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress). 598 Each Fab light chain had the final assembly: N-terminal signal peptide-Light variable domain-599 Human kappa light chain, with the exception of HSF2 whose kappa light chain was of mouse 600 origin. pET28a-nanoHER2-SpyTag003 (GenBank and Addgene deposition in progress), based 601 on the 11A4 nanobody against HER2 (Verheije et al., 2013), was cloned with a C-terminal His6 602 tag. 603 604 Bacterial Protein Expression 605 pDEST14 constructs were transformed into chemically competent E. coli C41 (DE3), a gift 606 from Anthony Watts (University of Oxford), except for the pDEST14-SpyCatcher003-607 SpyCatcher003-TEV site-SpyTag003DA disulfide-containing variants, which were 608 transformed into chemically competent E. coli T7SHuffle (NEB). pET28a and pETDuet 609 constructs were transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Agilent 610 Technologies), with the exception of pET28a-SnoopTag-AffiHER2-SpyTag, which was 611 transformed into chemically competent E. coli T7 Express (NEB). Colonies were picked into 612 10 mL LB containing either 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin (pDEST14/pETDuet) or 25-50 \u00b5g/mL 613 kanamycin (pET28a), and grown at 37 \u00b0C at 200 rpm for 4-16 h. Starter cultures were diluted 614 100-fold into either 1 L LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotic and 0.8% (w/v) glucose, 615 1 L LB supplemented with antibiotic alone (T7 Express only), or 2 \u00d7 TY supplemented with 616 antibiotic and 0.5% (v/v) glycerol (T7SHuffle only), and grown at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 200 617 rpm. At OD600 0.5-0.6, expression was induced with 0.42 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-618 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Fluorochem). pDEST14-transformed cultures were then 619 incubated for 4 h at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm, while all other cultures were incubated for 16 h at 18 620 \u00b0C and 200 rpm post-induction. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 15 min 621 at 4 \u00b0C and pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until purification. 622 623 Mammalian Protein Expression 624 Anti-HER2 Fabs were expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher), which were maintained 625 in Expi293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin and 626 50 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin and grown in a humidified Multitron Cell incubator (Infors HT) at 37 627 \u00b0C with 8% (v/v) CO2 and shaking at either 125 rpm (125 mL flasks; Corning) or 240 rpm (50 628 mL mini bioreactor tubes; Corning). After \u2265 3 passages, cells were diluted to 3 \u00d7 106 cells/mL 629 in antibiotic-free Expi293 Expression Medium and transfected using an ExpiFectamine 293 630 Transfection Kit (Thermo Scientific). ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Enhancers 1 and 2 were 631 added 20 h post transfection and cultures were incubated for 5 days post-transfection, when 632 cell viability fell below 50%. Cell supernatants were supplemented with cOmplete, Mini, 633 EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 g at 4 634 \u00b0C, followed by filtration through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter (Thermo Fisher). One tenth 635 supernatant volume of Ni-NTA wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM 636 imidazole) was added to filtered supernatant, which was then pH-adjusted to pH 7.6 using 1 M 637\nTris-HCl pH 8.0. Supernatants were stored at -80 \u00b0C until purification. The typical yield for 638 SpyTag003-fused Fabs ranged from 6 to 156 mg per L of culture. 639 640 Ni-NTA purification of His6-tagged proteins 641 After thawing, bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 1\u00d7 Ni-NTA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 642 pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl) supplemented with cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor 643 Cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and lysed by sonication 644 on ice. SpyCatcher003 S49C variants and DoubleCatcher double-cysteine variants were further 645 supplemented with 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to break disulfide bonds to other proteins. 646 Clarified cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and adjusted to pH 7.6 647 using 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, before purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) 648 as previously described (Fierer et al., 2014). Elution of all proteins was performed in the 649 absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. For anti-HER2 binding proteins to be heterodimerized by 650 DoubleCatcher for treatment of cells, the following washes were performed directly prior to 651 elution: 50 column volumes (CV) wash buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-114 (50 mM 652 Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 300 mM, 10 mM imidazole), followed by 10 CV wash buffer (50 mM Tris-653 HCl pH 7.8, 300 mM). Clarified mammalian supernatants were purified identically. Eluted 654 proteins were dialyzed three times against PBS pH 7.4 (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM 655 Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4) in 3.5 kDa molecular weight cut-off Spectra/Por tubing (Spectrum 656 Labs) at 4 \u00b0C. SpyCatcher003 S49C variants to be coupled to resin were instead dialyzed into 657 coupling buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 5 mM EDTA). Protein concentrations were 658 determined from A280 using their predicted extinction coefficient from ExPASy ProtParam. 659 Typical yield for SpyCatcher003-containing variants was 10-20 mg per L of culture. A typical 660 yield for affibody expression was ~3 mg per L of culture, and 30 mg per L for nanobody 661 expressions. Expression of SpyTag003-fused, non-antigen binding proteins yielded 5-15 mg 662 protein per L of culture. 663 Prior to assembly of bispecific molecules with DoubleCatcher for mammalian cell 664 treatment, endotoxin was removed from DoubleCatcher scaffolds by phase separation with 665 Triton X-114 (Aida and Pabst, 1990). Purified protein samples were transferred to 1.5 mL 666 endotoxin-free microcentrifuge tubes (StarLab, cat. E1415\u22121510), to which 1% (v/v) Triton 667 X-114 was added. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, until all Triton X-114 was 668 dissolved. Samples were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 669 g at 37 \u00b0C. The supernatant was pipetted off, and the entire procedure was repeated twice. 670 Endotoxin concentration of any bispecific constituent to be added to cells was determined using 671 the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (Thermo 672 Fisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, which confirmed the endotoxin level to 673 be below 1 endotoxin unit/mL. 674 675 SpySwitch purification of SpyTag003-tagged proteins 676 MBPX-MBPX-SpyTag003 cell pellets were lysed and clarified as outlined above, except 677 thawed pellets were resuspended in 1 \u00d7 SpySwitch buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM 678 NaCl). SpySwitch purification was performed at 4 \u00b0C, as described previously (Vester et al., 679 2022). Briefly, SpySwitch resin (0.75 mL per 1 L bacterial culture) was equilibrated with 2\u00d710 680 CV SpySwitch buffer, prior to incubation with clarified cell lysate on an end-over-end rotator 681 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, after which resin was washed with 4 \u00d7 10 CV SpySwitch buffer. pH-dependent 682 elution was performed by incubating the resin with 6 \u00d7 1.5 CV SpySwitch elution buffer (50 683 mM acetic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.0) for 5 min each, which was immediately neutralized by 684 mixing the flow-through with 6 \u00d7 0.3 CV of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Proteins were subsequently 685 dialyzed into PBS pH 7.4. 686 687\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 688 SDS-PAGE was performed using 8-16% polyacrylamide gels in an XCell SureLock system 689 (Thermo Scientific). SDS-PAGE was run at 200 V in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 192 mM 690 glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Gels were stained with Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained with 691 Milli-Q H2O prior to imaging on a ChemiDoc XRS+ imager. ImageLab 6.1.0 software (Bio-692 Rad) was used for densitometric quantification of bands. For imaging on an iBright FL1500 693 imaging system (Thermo Fisher), analysis was performed using iBright Analysis Software 694 Versions 5.0.1 and 5.2.0 (Thermo Fisher). 695 696 Size-Exclusion Chromatography 697 Ni-NTA- or SpySwitch-purified protein samples (SpyCatcher003-containing variants, 698 SpyTag003-linked non-antigen binding proteins) were injected onto a pre-equilibrated HiLoad 699 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare), or a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column 700 (SUMO-SpyTag003 and affibodies; GE Healthcare). Samples were run on an \u00c4KTA Pure 25 701 (GE Healthcare) fast protein liquid chromatography machine at 1 mL/min in PBS pH 7.4 at 4 702 \u00b0C. The absorbance profile of column elutions was recorded at 230 nm, 260 nm, and 280 nm. 703 Each column was calibrated using 660 kDa to 1.35 kDa molecular weight protein standards 704 (thyroglobulin, IgG, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12) (Bio-Rad). Following peak 705 analysis by SDS-PAGE, fractions containing purified protein at the expected molecular weight 706 were concentrated using Vivaspin 20 centrifugal filters (Cytiva) at 4 \u00b0C and then stored at -80 707 \u00b0C. 708 709 Resin coupling 710 SpyCatcher003 S49C was attached to SulfoLink Coupling Resin (Thermo Fisher) according to 711 the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with the following changes: SpyCatcher003 S49C in coupling 712 buffer was concentrated to 20 mg/mL using a Vivaspin 20 5 kDa molecular weight cut-off 713 centrifugal filter at 4 \u00b0C, reduced with 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) for 30 min 714 at 25 \u00b0C, and coupled to SulfoLink Coupling Resin at 20 mg reduced protein per mL of packed 715 resin. Following washes with 1 M NaCl, the coupled resin was washed with TP buffer (25 mM 716 orthophosphoric acid adjusted to pH 7.0 with Tris base) to remove SpyCatcher003 S49C that 717 had bound non-covalently to the resin. The coupled resin was stored in 20% (v/v) ethanol in 718 PBS pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C for \u2264 3 months. 719 720 Isopeptide bond reconstitution reactions 721 All reactions were carried out in triplicate in PBS pH 7.4. 2.5 \u00b5M SpyCatcher003 (at 25 \u00b0C), 722 Masked SpyCatcher003, or DoubleCatcher variants (each at 37 \u00b0C) was reacted with 5 \u00b5M 723 SpyTag003-linked protein. At each time-point or end-point indicated, reactions were quenched 724 by adding 6 \u00d7 SDS loading buffer [0.23 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 24% (v/v) glycerol, 120 \u00b5M 725 bromophenol blue, 0.23 M SDS], with subsequent heating at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min in a Bio-Rad 726 C1000 thermal cycler. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the depletion of 727 SpyCatcher003-derived reactant over time was quantified by densitometry. The extent of 728 reaction between binding partners at each time point is defined as 100 \u00d7 [1 - (SpyCatcher003-729 derived reactant)/(average density of SpyCatcher003-derived reactant in control lanes)]. 730 731 Assembly of dimeric molecules using DoubleCatcher 732 With the exception of reconstitution assays, the assembly of bispecific molecules from two 733 SpyTag(003)-linked proteins of interest, \u2018Protein A\u2019 and \u2018Protein B\u2019, was performed in 100 \u00b5L 734 total volume per well in 96-well cell culture plates (Thermo Scientific, cat. 167008): 1) 735 DoubleCatcher variant with concentration N (here, N = 1\u201375 \u00b5M) was first mixed with 1.25 \u00d7 736 N Protein A-SpyTag003 for 2 h at 25 \u00b0C with shaking at 550 rpm; 2) 5 \u00d7 N Protein B-737\nSpyTag003 and 1/12 \u00d7 N MBP-superTEV was added directly to the reaction mixture and 738 incubated for 4 h at 34 \u00b0C with shaking at 550 rpm; 3) reaction mixture was incubated with 739 SulfoLink resin-immobilized SpyCatcher003 S49C for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C with shaking at 550 rpm, 740 to remove excess unreacted SpyTag003-linked binders from solution. All coupling reactions 741 were carried out in PBS pH 7.4. 742 743 Dynamic Light Scattering 744 Size-exclusion chromatography-purified protein samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 16,900 745 g at 4 \u00b0C to remove any aggregates. Samples were filtered through 0.33 mm diameter sterile 746 syringe filters with a 0.22 \u00b5m hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane 747 (Sigma-Aldrich) and diluted to a final concentration of 25 \u00b5M for protein samples > 35 kDa, 748 or 75 \u00b5M for samples < 35 kDa into sterile filtered PBS pH 7.4. 20 \u00b5L diluted sample was 749 loaded into a reusable quartz cuvette and measurements (10 scans of 10 s each) were recorded 750 at 20 \u00b0C using an Omnisizer (Viscotek). Data were analyzed in duplicate using OmniSIZE 3.0. 751 For each sample, the radius of hydration (Rh) was plotted with error bars \u00b1 1 s.d. 752 753 Cell Culture 754 SKBR3 cells were from ATCC. BT474 cells were from Cancer Research UK, Lincoln\u2019s Inn 755 Fields. SKBR3 cells were grown in complete DMEM: Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium\u2013756 high glucose (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL 757 penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (1 \u00d7 pen/strep; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX 758 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% (v/v) CO2. BT474 cells were grown in complete 759 RPMI: RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin 760 and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (1 \u00d7 pen/strep; Sigma-Aldrich), and insulin (5 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma) at 761 37 \u00b0C and 5% (v/v) CO2. Cells were passaged at 70-80% confluency and were sub-cultured for 762 fewer than 3 months. Cell-lines were validated as mycoplasma-negative by PCR. 763 764 Metabolic Activity Assay 765 BT474 or SKBR3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1.25 \u00d7 104 cells per well and grown 766 in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX and 50 U/mL penicillin 767 and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (0.5 \u00d7 pen/strep) at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. 100 nM and subsequent serial 768 dilutions of anti-HER2 binders coupled to DoubleCatcher were prepared in 125 \u00b5L DMEM 769 with 0.1% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX and 0.5 \u00d7 pen/strep. Spent media was removed and 770 protein solutions were added to cells. DoubleCatcher or MBP-superTEV alone were applied to 771 cells at the same concentrations as the anti-HER2 binders as a negative control for cell killing. 772 Cells were treated for 96 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO2, after which 40 \u00b5L 0.15 mg/mL 773 Resazurin (Alamar Blue; Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in PBS pH 7.4 and dissolved in PBS and 774 sterile-filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m pore-sized membrane filter was added directly to each well, 775 and plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO2. Fluorescence (\u03bbex 544 nm, \u03bbem 776 590 nm) was measured using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). The 777 fluorescence intensity of media, without cells, containing Resazurin (\u2018background\u2019) was 778 subtracted from each measurement. The percent metabolic activity relative to untreated cells 779 was then defined as 100 \u00d7 (background-subtracted fluorescence of cells)/(background-780 subtracted fluorescence of untreated cells). Untreated cells are defined as cells grown in 781 DMEM + 1% (v/v) FBS, 0.5 \u00d7 pen/strep alone. 782 783 Mass Spectrometry 784 Intact protein mass spectrometry in positive ion mode was performed using a RapidFire 365 785 jet-stream electrospray ion source (Agilent) coupled to a 6550 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole 786 Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) (Agilent) mass spectrometer. 50 \u00b5L protein samples at 10 \u00b5M in PBS 787\npH 7.4 were prepared on a 384-well polypropylene plate (Greiner). Samples were acidified to 788 1% (v/v) formic acid, before aspiration under vacuum for 0.4 s and loading onto a C4 solid-789 phase extraction cartridge. Following washes with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (1.5 mL/min 790 flow rate for 5.5 s), samples were eluted to the Q-TOF detector with deionized water containing 791 85% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (1.25 mL/min flow rate for 5.5 s). Data were 792 analyzed using Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software B.07.00 (Agilent). Expected 793 molecular weights for full-length proteins were calculated using the ExPASy ProtParam tool, 794 with the N-terminal fMet (bacterial expression) or signal peptide sequence (mammalian 795 expression) removed. Signal peptide cleavage was predicted by SignalP 6.0 (Nielsen et al., 796 2019). -2 Da was calculated for each predicted disulfide bond. The small amount of +178 Da 797 peak relates to gluconoylation, a common spontaneous post-translational modification for 798 proteins overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (Geoghegan et al., 1999). 799 800 Mass Photometry 801 Microscope coverslips (24 \u00d7 50 mm, Menzel Gl\u00e4ser) were cleaned by sequential sonication in 802 50% (v/v) isopropanol and Milli-Q H2O (5 min each), dried under a clean nitrogen stream, and 803 assembled into flow chambers with isopropanol/Milli-Q H2O-rinsed and nitrogen-dried 804 silicone gaskets (6 mm \u00d7 1 mm, GBL103280, Grace Bio-Labs) as outlined (Young et al., 2018). 805 Data were acquired on a Refeyn TwoMP mass photometer. Immediately prior to mass 806 photometry, protein samples were diluted into freshly prepared and degassed MP sample buffer 807 [PBS pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM NaN3, sterile-filtered through a 0.22 808 \u00b5m pore-size syringe filter (Thermo Fisher)]. A dynamin protein mass standard (MS1000 20-809 40\u00d7), diluted into MP sample buffer, was used to calibrate the mass photometer each time a 810 new cover slip was used (Foley et al., 2021). The focal position of the microscope was found 811 in flow chambers containing 20 \u03bcL sample, after which 0.5-10 \u03bcL of MP sample buffer was 812 replaced with an equivalent volume protein sample, to a final working concentration of 2-50 813 nM, to account for differences in the dissociation characteristics of different proteins. After \u2264 814 10 s, images were acquired for 60 s at 331 Hz. Each sample was measured at least twice 815 independently. All data were processed using DiscoverMP v1.2.3 software (Refeyn Ltd) (Foley 816 et al., 2021). Masses were plotted as mass histogram (bin width = 2.5 kDa) and fitted to 817 Gaussian non-linear regression curves to identify the mean masses of each protein 818 subpopulation within the heterogeneous sample in GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software). 819 Expected molecular weights for protein constituents were calculated using the ExPASy 820 ProtParam tool, with the N-terminal fMet (bacterial expression) or signal peptide sequence 821 (mammalian expression) removed. 822 823 Data Analysis and Graphics Visualization 824 Data visualization and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad 825 Software) and MATLAB R2023a (Mathworks). Protein structures were visualized using 826 PyMOL 2.5.4 (Schr\u00f6dinger). The structure of HER2 was assembled in PyMOL from PDB IDs 827 1N8Z (Extracellular Domain) (Cho et al., 2003), 2KS1 (transmembrane domain) (Mineev et 828 al., 2010), and 3PP0 (kinase domain) (Aertgeerts et al., 2011) as previously (Goodsell, 2022). 829 Binder structures are based on the following: Tras by PDB ID 1N8Z (Cho et al., 2003); Pert 830 by PDB ID 1S78 (Franklin et al., 2004); 39S by PDB ID 6ATT (Oganesyan et al., 2018); 831 MF3958 by PDB ID 5O4G (Geuijen et al., 2018); H2-18 by PDB ID 3WLW (Hu et al., 2015); 832 and AffiHER2 by PDB ID 3MZW (Eigenbrot et al., 2010). Protein structures for 833 DoubleCatcher variants were predicted using ColabFold versions 1.3 and 1.5.2 (Mirdita et al., 834 2022), and structures for HER2 extracellular domain in complex with HFS2 or nanoHER2 835 were predicted using ColabFold version 1.4 (Mirdita et al., 2022). Structural predictions were 836 performed using the full-length protein sequence, except for HFS2 where the signal peptide 837\nwas removed. For all ColabFold-simulated structures, the structure predicted with the highest 838 confidence is presented. 839 To simulate vectors that reflect the directionality of SpyTag003, the PyMOL 840 modevectors tool was used to connect Ser57 to His53 and Ser179 to His175 by their carbonyl 841 main-chain oxygens (Law, 2020) (DoubleCatcher numbering, according to sequence listed in 842 Supplementary Fig. 1). The arrowhead represents the N-terminus of the SpyTag003 peptide, 843 such that a binder with a C-terminal SpyTag003 would project from the arrowhead of the vector 844 when it is coupled to DoubleCatcher. 845 846 Statistics and reproducibility 847 Statistical significance for metabolic activity assays were calculated by two-way analysis of 848 variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett\u2019s correction for multiple comparison. For representative 849 SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C, E; Fig. 2B, E; Supplementary Fig. 4A, B), observations were confirmed 850 at least once with similar or identical conditions. For Fig. 3 D, E, heterodimer assembly and 851 subsequent analyses by mass photometry and SDS-PAGE were repeated at least twice with 852 similar results. For Fig. 4C, D and Fig. 6D, the bispecific assemblies and subsequent metabolic 853 activity assays were repeated at least twice independently with similar results. No statistical 854 method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The 855 experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during 856 experiments and outcome assessment. 857 858 Data availability 859 Amino acid sequences of Masked SpyCatcher003-containing variants are available in 860 Supplementary Fig. 1. Sequences of other constructs are available in GenBank as described in 861 the section Plasmids and cloning. Plasmids encoding DoubleCatchers and related binders will 862 be deposited in the Addgene repository (https://www.addgene.org/Mark_Howarth/).
