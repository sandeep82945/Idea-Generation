1. **Investigate the use of other soft-sensor modeling techniques for inferential composition control.** 
The paper uses principal component regression (PCR) for soft-sensor modeling. Other techniques that could be explored include partial least squares regression (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs). These techniques may be able to provide more accurate and robust soft-sensor models, especially for nonlinear processes.


2. **Apply the proposed inferential ADRC control scheme to other distillation columns.** 
The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme on a simulated methanol-water separation column. It would be interesting to see how the scheme performs on other distillation columns, such as those used in the petroleum, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.


3. **Investigate the use of inferential ADRC control for other process control applications.** 
The paper focuses on the application of inferential ADRC control to product composition control in distillation columns. However, the scheme could also be applied to other process control applications, such as temperature control, pressure control, and flow control.


4. **Develop a systematic approach for designing inferential ADRC control systems.** 
The paper presents a general framework for designing inferential ADRC control systems. However, a more systematic approach could be developed to help engineers design and tune these systems more easily. This could involve developing guidelines for selecting soft-sensor modeling techniques, determining the appropriate number of principal components, and setting the parameters of the ADRC controller.


5. **Investigate the use of inferential ADRC control for batch distillation processes.** 
The paper focuses on the application of inferential ADRC control to continuous distillation processes. However, the scheme could also be applied to batch distillation processes. This would require developing soft-sensor models that can capture the dynamic behavior of batch distillation processes.
