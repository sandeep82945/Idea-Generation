1. **Investigate the use of nanomaterials for targeted drug delivery to specific cells or tissues in the wound bed.** This could improve the efficacy of wound healing treatments and reduce side effects.


2. **Develop nanomaterial-based wound dressings that can sense and respond to changes in the wound environment.** For example, a dressing that could release antibiotics in response to the presence of bacteria could help to prevent infection.


3. **Explore the use of nanomaterials to create bioactive wound dressings that promote tissue regeneration.** This could involve the use of nanomaterials to deliver growth factors or other bioactive molecules to the wound site.


4. **Investigate the use of nanomaterials to create wound dressings that can monitor the healing process.** This could involve the use of nanomaterials to create sensors that can measure wound size, temperature, or other parameters.


5. **Develop nanomaterial-based wound dressings that can be used in combination with other wound healing therapies.** This could involve the use of nanomaterials to deliver drugs or other therapeutic agents to the wound site in a controlled manner.
