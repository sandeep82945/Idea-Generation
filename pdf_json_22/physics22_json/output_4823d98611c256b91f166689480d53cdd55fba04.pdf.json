Wavefront shaping techniques are highly promising to overcome the effect of wave scattering as even opaque media feature open channels for which the incident light is fully transmitted [6, 7, 8, 9]. With this feature being restricted, however, to just a small subset of judiciously engineered states it remains out of reach to render an opaque sample translucent for any incident light field.

Recently also so-called \u201cscattering-invariant modes\u201d have been demonstrated whose transmitted output patterns are the same, irrespective of whether a scattering medium is placed in their way or not [10].\nThe fundamental and far-reaching question we address here is, whether an operational procedure can be found such that instead of only a single and specifically designed light field, the energy of all field patterns impinging on a disordered medium gets perfectly transmitted (irrespective of the spatial distribution of the transmitted field). Clearly, wavefront shaping at the input of a given medium will not suffice for this challenging goal, since only a fraction of transmission channels are open, with all others being closed or having intermediate transmission and reflection. Instead, the only option seems to be the engineering of the disordered medium itself. Indeed, several protocols have recently been put forward for the design of hyper-uniform and non-Hermitian media that feature perfect transmission even for certain disordered internal structures [11, 1, 13, 14]. While such strategies may be usable during the fabrication process of materials with desired properties, applying them to already existing disordered media in post-fabrication is extremely challenging, in particular as the internal structure of such media is typically not only unknown but also inaccessible.\nHere, we present a viable strategy for rendering an arbitrary and immutable disordered medium completely transmitting to all possible incoming wavefronts by putting a suitably engineered complementary medium right in front of it. Unlike matching layers that suppress impedance mismatch only in stratified media [4, 15, 16], this prepended \u201canti-reflection structure\u201d is a disordered medium itself, with the special property that it is perfectly matched to the given medium one aims to transmit across. Most importantly, the internal structure of the given medium does not need to be known. Instead, the relevant matching condition solely relies on the given medium\u2019s one-sided reflection matrix that is routinely measured experimentally. The remaining task to be solved is to engineer the complementary medium in front such that it has a desired one-sided reflection matrix itself to satisfy the matching condition involving both media.\nFull transmission through disorder Our concept is illustrated in Fig. 1: starting point is a given disordered medium of thickness L, for which the average transmission of a wavefront impinging from the left typically scales as \u3008T \u3009 \u223c `/L, where ` is the mean free path. Correspondingly, when placing a second disordered medium directly to the left of the first one, the transmission through both media would be further reduced as the total scattering region is now increased in length. Here, instead, we aim to achieve the opposite: by designing the medium on the left (L) to be complementary to the medium on the right (R), the total transmission through the composite structure should reach the maximum possible value as obtained for the case when both media were not even present\nand all incoming fields pass through the structure without back-reflection. To identify the proper condition for complementarity, consider first the frequency-dependent scattering matrix S(\u03bd) of the total system. In the absence of absorption, the scattering matrix is unitary as a consequence of flux conservation, S\u2020S = 1. This scattering matrix is composed of two reflection matrices r and r\u2032 for incoming flux from the left (unprimed) and right side (primed) of the sample, respectively, and of the corresponding transmission matrices t and t\u2032 = tT . Simple expressions now relate the total scattering matrix S of the composite structure to the scattering matrices SL and SR of the left and right medium, respectively (see Fig. 1c for an illustration):\nt = tR(1\u2212 r\u2032LrR)\u22121tL , (1) r = rL + t \u2032 LrR(1\u2212 r\u2032LrR)\u22121tL . (2)\nRemarkably, using the relations tLt \u2020 L + r \u2032 Lr \u2032 \u2020 L = 1 and rLt \u2020 L + t \u2032 Lr \u2032 \u2020 L = 0 following from the unitarity of SL, we deduce that if the reflection matrix of the complementary medium r\u2032L satisfies\nr\u2032 \u2020L = rR , (3)\nthe left reflection matrix of the full system r = rL + t\u2032Lr \u2032\u2020 Lt \u2020\u22121 L vanishes entirely, r = 0. At the same time, the right reflection matrix vanishes also, r\u2032 = 0, and transmission becomes perfect from both sides: t\u2020t = 1 and t\u2032\u2020t\u2032 = 1. We have therefore established a simple relation to realise a fully transmitting scattering system for which all incident wavefronts \u03c8in are fully transmitted, \u2016t \u03c8in\u20162 = 1. From a conceptual point of view, Eq. (3) constitutes a matrix generalisation of the condition for critical coupling, which is well-known from one-dimensional scattering problems [17]. We emphasise here that Eq. (3) relies on both the amplitude and phase-information of waves to ensure that they interfere appropriately. Most importantly, our approach does not require knowledge of the microstructure of the disorder in the right medium but only its left-sided (unprimed) reflection matrix rR is necessary to design a fully translucent scattering system.\nWe now demonstrate this concept in practice using a waveguide with internal disorder supporting N = 4 or N = 7 transverse modes and a single mode in its vertical dimension over the operating frequency ranges (6.6\u20137.4 GHz and 10.7-11.7 GHz). The propagation of waves through this system is modeled with a two-dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation [\u2206 + n2(r)k20]\u03c8(r) = 0. The initial disorder configuration of the given medium consists of a random arrangement of 17 Teflon cylinders and 3 metallic cylinders in a region of length 0.2 m. Its mean transmission T = \u03a3Nb,a=1|tba|2/N is equal to T = 0.64 at 7 GHz giving an estimated mean free path `tr \u2248 0.23 m. At 11.2 GHz we have T = 0.58 and `tr \u2248 0.18 m."

            "text": "The critical remaining task is to design a complementary medium with a desired reflection matrix at the design frequency (which we choose to be \u03bd0 = 7 GHz or \u03bd0 = 11.2 GHz). Equation (3) requires that the individual values of the average transmission through the complementary\nmedium and the fixed disorder are equal TL = TR, such that we start the inverse design with a complementary medium that features a combination of Teflon and metallic scatterers (randomly chosen) with a similar reflection to the fixed disorder. At this initial step, the matrix t\u2020t, featuring the global transmission t, is also random as shown in Fig. 2. The distribution of transmission eigenvalues \u03c4 of t\u2020t follows a bimodal law for random configurations [6, 18], P (\u03c4) \u221d 1/[\u03c4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03c4 ] as expected in scattering media (see Fig. 2c), with an average transmission \u3008\u03c4\u3009 = 0.40 averaged both over frequencies and configurations. In a next step, we gradually optimise the positions of the scatterers in the complementary medium to satisfy the desired matching condition. Since, however, the design space for finding an optimal solution for this inverse problem is enormous, it is insufficient to just work with a random search algorithm. Instead, we need an iterative procedure based on the gradient of the objective (the average transmission of the sample) with respect to the system parameters (the scatterers\u2019 positions) [5]. Procedures of this kind [19, 20] have been implemented in various computational techniques [21, 5, 22], such as for the design of compact and efficient devices in nanophotonics [23, 24], light confinement in strongly scattering disordered media [25], or for analog computing using metastructures [26]. Here we introduce a tailor-made approach to calculate this gradient based on the generalised Wigner-Smith (GWS) operator that has recently been exploited for optimal focusing, micro-manipulation and information retrieval in disordered systems [27, 28, 29, 30]. The constituting equation of the GWS operator, Qrn , reads\n\u3008u |Qrn |u\u3009 = \u2329 u \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212iS\u22121 dSdrn \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223u\u232a \u221d \u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n( cos\u03d5 sin\u03d5 ) |\u03c8u (rn) |2d\u03d5 , (4)\nwhere rn is the position of the nth scatterer, \u03c8u the wavefunction resulting from an injection described by a vector of modal amplitudes |u\u3009 and the integral traces out the boundary of the scatterer. Given now a certain scattering wavefunction in the near-field of each scatterer, \u03c8u(rn) , we can infer which shift of a particular scatterer moves the scattering matrix in the desired direction. The advantage of this approach for calculating the gradient is that the number of electromagnetic simulations we need to perform scales linearly with the number of modes and is independent of the number of system parameters. The scaling of each simulation, however, depends on the electromagnetic solver used. A more detailed look reveals that for each incoming mode two simulations are required, making our approach exactly as efficient as the state of the art adjoint derivative [5]."

            "text": "At the end of the optimisation, the transmission T is extremely close to unity (between Tsim = 0.995 and Tsim = 0.999 depending on the sample) such that the matrix t(\u03bd0)\u2020t(\u03bd0) practically is the identity matrix (see Fig. 2b, right panel). In this translucent scattering medium, all transmission eigenchannels are naturally open, \u03c4n = 1 \u2200n, as seen in Fig. 2c. For these samples, the length of the complementary medium is the same as the one of the fixed disorder. However,\nbecause only Eq. (3) needs to be satisfied, we can in principle optimise the complementary medium in a much smaller area. For the same scattering strength, we indeed achieve perfect transmission at 7 GHz using a length as small as a single wavelength. Finally, we repeat the same procedure for an initial sample with stronger disorder (20 Teflon cylinders and 6 metallic cylinders) giving `tr \u2248 0.095m at 7 GHz.\nThe spectra of T (\u03bd) shown in Fig. 3a-d all display a pronounced resonance at the design frequency \u03bd = \u03bd0. We emphasise that the optimised design of the complementary medium is indeed a rare event as the transmission does not exceed 0.75 in all of the 2500 random configurations we have sampled in our numerics. We also note that the geometry resulting from our optimisation is not a hyperuniform structure [1] nor does it rely on a special mirror symmetry [2] as in previous attempts at realising a fully transparent disorder or at enhancing transmission through a barrier; in this sense our approach is broadly applicable (see supplementary material for more information).\nIn the waveguide experiment, we implement the numerically obtained solution by placing the scatterers at the calculated positions (see Fig. 2a) and by measuring the transmission of microwaves using a set of antennas (see Supplementary Material). The experimental results obtained in this way nicely reproduce the simulation results with a maximum transmission Texp between 0.91 and 0.94 at 7 GHz and Texp = 0.9 at 11.2 GHz, see Fig. 3e-h. The reduction of Texp as compared to the numerical values is due to the impact of dissipative losses in the waveguide walls and in the scatterers, which increases with the dwell time of transmitted waves and hence with the disorder strength.\nTo demonstrate the flexibility of our inverse design procedure we use it not only to maximise, but also to minimise transmission and hence maximise reflection through the system with the same number of scatterers. The minimal transmission found numerically (experimentally) now varies between 0.001 and 0.03 (between 0.002 and 0.049) for the samples with N = 4 and is as small as Tsim = 0.03 (Texp = 0.1) with N = 7. Interestingly, we observe that the transmission in these opaque samples can be reduced over a broad frequency range. This observation is explained by considering that the incident waves penetrate here only weakly into the disordered sample (see Fig. 4) such that no sharply resonant states are excited whose limited bandwidth would make this a narrow-band effect [32]."

            "text": "A remarkable consequence of our medium design concerns the spatial distribution of the intensity W (x, y) within the medium (see Fig. 4a) and with it the dwell time \u03c4D \u221d \u222b dxdyW (x, y). As has been shown in previous works [33, 34, 8, 35], open transmission channels in generic disordered media are associated both with an enhanced penetration depth of incoming radiation and an increased dwell time in the disorder. Now that we have created a system that features only open transmission eigenchannels, the intriguing question arising is whether our design naturally also increases both of these quantities for all incoming radiation fields. To verify this\nexplicitly, we show in Fig. 4a the spatial distribution of the intensity and in Fig. 4b the energy density averaged over the cross-section of the waveguide, W (x) = \u3008W (x, y)\u3009y, for a translucent sample, for an unoptimised random disorder and for a fully reflecting sample. The peak of maximum energy density for a translucent medium shifts, on average, towards the middle of the sample, in agreement with the profile of open channels in random configurations [33, 34, 8, 36]. For samples with thickness L `, we can therefore estimate that the dwell time is on average increased by a factor \u03c0L/(12`) relative to its value in an unoptimised random configuration [33, 35], for which \u3008W (x)\u3009 is governed by the diffusion equation and decreases linearly with x. The dwell time in translucent samples indeed falls in the tail of the distribution P (\u03c4D) computed for many random configurations, see Fig. 4c. In contrast, for a highly reflecting sample, W (x) approaches the profile of closed channels and decays almost exponentially with x, corresponding to a dwell time shorter than \u3008\u03c4D\u3009."

            "text": "Our approach is general and can be broadly applied to other complex systems. In the supplemental material, we extend our inverse design of perfectly transmitting structures to a multichannel cavity coupling four incoming and four outgoing ports. By optimising the position of fifteen metallic scatterers within the cavity, we achieve an average transmission as large as 0.998 numerically and 0.9 experimentally at the selected frequency. Our results also provide an interesting new perspective for research on reflectionless scattering modes [37, 38] and coherent perfect absorption [17]. While these coherent wave effects have recently been realised also experimentally for disordered systems, all of these studies remained restricted to single specific wavefronts whose absence of reflection or perfect absorption were demonstrated [39, 40, 41]. Our results point the way how to conveniently extend these concepts to multiple incoming wavefronts in parallel. Practically speaking, for the case of a broadband absorber being placed behind a disordered medium, the anti-reflection coating we introduce here would have the interesting effect that the opaqueness of the disorder (appearing as white in the visible spectrum) would get a spectral dip (appearing as black) at the design frequency, at which any incoming wave front penetrates the disorder and gets absorbed perfectly.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that a disordered medium can be made fully transmitting to all incoming wavefronts by placing an optimised complementary medium in front of it. Since only the reflection matrix of this complementary medium must be engineered, we envision that thin metasurfaces could be used for this purpose, enabling the creation of tailor-made and potentially time-adaptive anti-reflection structures with fascinating properties for applications in the fields of wireless communications, filtering, energy harvesting and imaging. In the long term, we expect that advances both in computing power and in microfabrication will make our approach applicable to systems with an increasingly large number of modes."

We solve the Helmholtz equation using an open-source finite element-library (NGSolve) [42, 43]. This allows us also to numerically evaluate the objective function we maximize, which reads\nf = Tr t\u2020t/N = Tr ( 1\u2212 r\u2020r ) /N, with r = rL + t \u2032 LrR(1\u2212 r\u2032LrR)\u22121tL , (5)\nwhere t (r) is the transmission (reflection) matrix of the whole system for a wave injected from the left lead and N is the number of transverse electric modes. Using the unitarity of S we rewrite f in terms of r. This has the considerable advantage that we only need the measurable reflection matrix of the fixed disorder, rR, to compute the objective function. The gradient of this objective with respect to the position of the nth scatterer is given by,\n\u2207rnf = \u22122 Re Tr ( r\u2020\u2207rnr ) /N , with (6) \u2207rnr = \u2207rnrL +\u2207rnt\u2032LrRMtL + t\u2032LrRM [\u2207rnr\u2032LrRMtL +\u2207rntL] , (7)\nwhere M = (1 \u2212 r\u2032LrR)\u22121 encodes the multiple reflections between left and right disorder. r\u2032L is the reflection matrix for a state injected from the right. Following from the block structure of the S matrix the gradient of each block is given by,\n\u2207rnSL = ( \u2207rnrL \u2207rnt\u2032L \u2207rntL \u2207rnr\u2032L ) = i ( rL t \u2032 L tL r \u2032 L )( Q11rn Q 12 rn Q21rn Q 22 rn ) , (8)\nwhere the matrices Qijrn are the corresponding blocks of the GWS operator associated to the shift of the nth scatterer in direction rn. We note here that when we use Eq. (5) as our objective function we need to take into account evanescent coupling between left and right disorder such that the total transmission is faithfully computed. This can be either done by avoiding evanescent modes altogether (hence the gap between left and right disorder in some configurations) or by using a scattering matrix which includes evanescent channels [44]. Alternatively one can directly compute the transmission matrix of the whole system.\nThe GWS operator was originally introduced for optimal micro-manipulation since its eigenvalues are directly proportional to the force applied on the target scatterer [27, 28]. This has the interesting consequence that we can compute the GWS operator and therefore the gradient of f using the electric field (with which we calculate the force) at the scatterers without the need to move any single scatterer \u2013 a feature which makes the evaluation of the gradient independent of the number of system parameters. To be more precise, we only have to do 2N simulations,\nwhere N is the number of modes. We access the matrix elements of Qrn by 4 [Qrn ]ij = F ( |ui\u3009+ |uj\u3009 ) \u2212 F ( |ui\u3009 \u2212 |uj\u3009 ) + iF ( |ui\u3009 \u2212 i |uj\u3009 ) \u2212 iF ( |ui\u3009+ i |uj\u3009 ) ,\n(9)\nwhere the |ui\u3009 are a complete and orthonormal set of incoming scattering states (e.g., the different waveguide modes) and F ( |u\u3009 )\ndenotes the force transferred by the electric field onto the nth scatterer when we inject a wave in the state |u\u3009 into the system. This simple reformulation allows us to simulate the electric field inside the scattering region and then calculate Qrn for every single scatterer with which we can build the gradient of f without the need to move every single scattere, simulate the system and calculate the gradient. In the case of a dielectric target the force is calculated by,\nF ( |u\u3009 ) = Rk2(\u03b5\u2212 1)\n2\n\u222b 2\u03c0 0 ( cos\u03d5 sin\u03d5 ) |\u03c8u (\u03c1 = R) |2d\u03d5 , (10)\nand for a metallic one by,\nF ( |u\u3009 )\n= \u2212R 2 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 ( cos\u03d5 sin\u03d5 ) |\u2202\u03c1\u03c8u (\u03c1 = R)|2 d\u03d5 , (11)\nwhere \u03c8u is the electric field distribution inside the scattering region for a wave injected in the state |u\u3009.\nThe optimisation is constrained by the strict condition that no two scatterers can overlap. In order to enforce this at every step, we use the following algorithm: while f < 0.999 (i.e., the transmission is smaller than 99.9%), we compute Qrn for all scatterers and use it to calculate f(rn+\u2206rn) with S(rn+\u2206rn) = S(rn) exp(i|\u2206rn|Qrn) for all possible changes in the position of scatterers. We then pick the direction of largest increase in the total transmission, which does not result in an overlap of scatterers. If we cannot find such a change for the given step size, we reduce the step size by a factor of 1.5. Otherwise we check if f(rn + \u2206rn) \u2265 f(rn) + c|\u2206rn| (\u2207rnf)\n2, with c = 0.025 is fulfilled. If this is the case we update the geometry, if not we also reduce the step-size."

The results in dependence of the transmission of the fixed disorder are presented in Fig. S4a. We see that higher transmission of the fixed disorder leads to a higher probability that the design process converges for one random initial guess. Note that the statistics is not very precise at low transmission due to the low number of configurations.\nTo interpret this result, we note that the gradient descent optimisation used here deterministically follows the path of the steepest gradient until it reaches a local minimum.

Despite this steep angle of incidence the average transmission of this disorder is still T = 0.998, while the transmission of the last mode (with the steepest angle) is T = 0.999.\nTo further illustrate this result, we show in Fig. S5 the Poynting vector for an empty waveguide and an optimised disorder, when we either inject the highest order mode or a state u with a high angle of incidence. We construct this state by numerically optimising the ratio of u\u2020kyu and u\u2020kxu. Here kx and ky are the operators that give us for a particular incoming wavestate its k-components.

Here we show numerically and analytically that adding constant global absorption still results in zero reflection across all input channels, while the transmission deviates unavoidably from unity (see Fig. S6). To be more precise, we first investigate in Fig. S6a how the transmission and reflection change when we scan the absorption strength in the geometry featuring 49 scatterers designed at 11.2 GHz. We implement the absorption by adding an imaginary part between nI = 0 and nI = 10\u22123 to the refractive index everywhere. We find that while the transmission decreases from unity immediately the reflection remains zero for a much wider range of absorption strength. We corroborate this result in Fig. S6b, where we show a frequency scan of the transmission with and without absorption that features a pronounced dip in the reflection at 11.2 GHz. In this case we use an imaginary part nI = 1.2\u00d710\u22124 since it results in a transmission of TAbs \u2248 0.9, comparable to the one found in the experiment. Also the reflection at the target frequency (11.2 GHz) is RAbs = 0.0042, which is comparable to the one found without absorption (R = 0.0049).\nWe put this empirical observation on more solid grounds by considering the globally uniform imaginary part as a complex shift of the frequency to \u03c9 + i\u03b1/2, where \u03b1 = 2knI is the absorption rate [6]. Under the assumption of small dissipation we can then expand the scattering matrix into,\nSa(\u03c9 + i\u03b1/2) \u2248 S(\u03c9) [ 1\u2212 \u03b1\n2 Q(\u03c9)\n] , (S3)\nwhere Q is the Wigner-Smith time-delay operator and the subscript a denotes absorption (terms without it are evaluated at zero absorption).

The elements of t0(\u03bd) for an empty waveguide are presented in Fig. S7 at \u03bd = 7 GHz and \u03bd = 11.2 GHz. In both cases, the transmission matrix is diagonal as expected. This confirms that the coupling between our antennas is small and barely impacts our results. A strong coupling may indeed result in off-diagonal terms with high amplitude. The transmission of the last mode is seen to be slightly smaller than the transmission of the first modes. This results from losses within the waveguide as the last mode is associated with a larger time delay. Because our antennas are weakly coupled to the waveguide, the transmission coefficients found from the two-fold sine transformation are not flux-normalized. As shown in the Methods section of the main text, we therefore normalize the transmission for each waveguide mode n, Tn(\u03bd) = \u03a3m|tmn(\u03bd)|2, by its value for an empty waveguide, T 0n(\u03bd):\nT (\u03bd) = 1\nN N\u2211 n=1 Tn(\u03bd) T 0n(\u03bd) . (S6)\nThis is equivalent to normalizing the transmission matrix such as:\nt\u0303nm(\u03bd) = tnm(\u03bd)\u221a T 0n(\u03bd) , (S7)\nand calculating the average transmission of each mode with T (\u03bd) = [\u03a3Nn,m=1|t\u0303nm(\u03bd)|2]/N . To validate our experimental results, we first compute the distribution of transmission eigenvalues \u03c4 of t\u0303\u2020(\u03bd)t\u0303(\u03bd) for waveguides with random disorder. Here the distribution is found from 10 random realizations with randomly located scatterers and an averaging over the frequency range [6.6-7.4] GHz (N = 4). The distribution is presented in Fig. S8. As expected from diffusion theory, this distribution is bimodal with two peaks centered on closed channels with \u03c4 \u223c 0 and open channels with \u03c4 \u223c 1. The experimental result is in good agreement with the theoretical law:\nP0(\u03c4) \u221d 1\n\u03c4 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03c4 . (S8)\nHowever, in line with previous works on this subject [7], we observe the presence of transmission eigenvalues above unity. The bimodal distribution and more precisely the peak associated with open channels is indeed very sensitive to experimental noise. A nonunitarity of the scattering matrix due to experimental noise indeed leads to dramatic deviations from theory with transmission eigenvalues exhibiting coefficients larger than unity [7]. These open channels virtually violate the energy conservation due to the noise level. As a result of the spreading of\neigenvalues with large transmission, the amplitude of the corresponding peak also decreases. In our case, this noise level comes from the normalization of the elements of the transmission matrix using transmission through an empty sample. In particular, the last waveguide mode with a large angle between k and the longitudinal direction feature a large dwell time for the empty waveguide and is therefore very sensitive to global absorption. In the presence of weak disorder, the outgoing field is mixed in all modes leading to a possible smaller sensitivity to the absorption. As a result, the normalization can lead to transmission eigenvalues larger than unity.\nExperimentally, we implement anti-reflection structures by projecting on the waveguide an image of the scatterer positions found numerically using a video projector. The image is calibrated to minimize positioning errors. The cylinders are then placed manually. Small inaccuracies may result from this procedure but the overall agreement between numerical and experimental results is excellent as seen in Fig. 3 of the main text.\nTo further confirm our normalization procedure, we show in Fig. S9 the transmission associated to each incoming mode of the waveguide for a sample with complete transmission. The configuration corresponds to Fig. 3g of the main text. The transmission matrix |t\u0303ij|2 is seen to be random in Fig. S9a as a result of strong mode mixing. Nevertheless, each waveguide mode provides almost perfect transmission at \u03bd0 = 7 GHz (see Fig. S9b)."

A single vertically polarized mode can propagate within the cavity below f = 14.7 GHz. Two arrays of N = 4 coax antennas are connected on the left and right interfaces. We carry out measurements of the N \u00d7N transmission matrix t(\u03c9) between 7.8 and 9 GHz. Because coax-to-waveguides transitions are well-matched antennas between 7 and 12 GHz, the transmission coefficients are flux-normalized and no post-processing is needed. For an empty cavity, the average transmission T (\u03c9) fluctuates within the selected frequency range between 0.37 and 0.83 numerically and between 0.3 and 0.7 experimentally as a consequence of absorption within the cavity.\nWe then gradually optimise the positions of 15 metallic cylinders of radius r = 3 mm in numerical simulations to reach complete transmission at \u03bd0 = 8.4 GHz. Because this configuration does not enable to write the complete scattering matrix as a composite expression of the scattering matrix of the empty cavity, the cost function f = Trt\u2020t/N is directly estimated in terms of the transmission matrix of the full system. The maximum transmission at the end of the numerical optimisation reaches 0.998. We then implement experimentally the numerical solution. The transmission spectrum nicely reproduces the numerical result with a maximal transmission of 0.9 at \u03bd0.

Thus we add a uniform imaginary part of nI = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 to the refractive index distribution of the waveguide containing the optimised configuration and as shown in Fig. S6 this only lowers the transmission peak, but doesn\u2019t shift it noticeably.\nWe first consider uncertainties in the experimental placement of the scatterers, such as when the experimental scatterer positions are slightly different from the ones obtained from the numerical optimisation. We investigate the effect of a small global shift of only the optimised part of the scattering configuration in the negative/positive longitudinal direction which causes a shift of the transmission peak to lower/higher frequencies, where the peak is typically also lowered (orange dashed/dotted line in Fig. S11). Since the uncertainties in the scatterer placement might not be global but rather random, we also investigated the effect of small random displacements of the optimised scatterer positions which causes peak shifts, lowerings and broadenings depending on the magnitude of the displacements (green solid line in Fig. S11).\nBecause of possible fabrication uncertainties and the skin effect in the metallic waveguide walls, we also consider slightly different waveguide dimensions. Specifically, we study the effect of a slightly wider waveguide (with the scatterers kept transversally in the middle of the waveguide), which lowers the transmission peak and shifts it to lower frequencies (blue solid line in Fig. S11).\nMoreover, in the experiment not all scatterers may reach the waveguide\u2019s top plate perfectly. The resulting gap can then cause the waves to scatterer off the top edge of the cylindrical scatterers exciting evanescent modes, which might change the transmission spectrum due to coupling to the surrounding scatterers. To examine this effect, we perform 3D simulations in which we solve the vectorial Helmholtz equation\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7E(r)\u2212n2(r)k20E(r) = 0. We find that a small gap (especially for metallic scatterers) results in lowered transmission peak which is shifted to higher frequencies (red solid line in Fig. S11).\nIn the experiment, we most likely observe a combination of all these effects. Additionally, the experiment can suffer from spurious reflections at the non-perfect absorbers at the waveguide ends as well as from scattering off the antennas used to inject and measure the waves, which can further effect the transmission spectrum."

The top plate has been removed to see the interior of the cavity. Four transition-to-coax antennas are placed at the left and right side of the cavity. Measurement of the transmission matrix between these two arrays is carried out with a vector network analyzer. Fifteen metallic cylinders are placed at the positions determined numerically for perfect transmission. b, Total transmission Tn(\u03bd) = \u03a3m|tmn(\u03bd)|2 for the four incoming channels (dashed lines) and its average T (\u03bd) = (\u03a3nTn(\u03bd))/N over incoming channels (blue line). The placement of the cylinders correspond to positions optimised numerically for perfect transmission at \u03bd0 = 8.4 GHz. Deviations from the maximal transmission value 1 is primarily due to absorption in the cavity.\nFigure S11: Transmission spectrum of the optimised sample with 52 scatterers (black solid line), where the vertical dashed line marks the frequency at which the optimisation has been performed. Increasing the waveguide width by 1% of the initial width W (blue solid line) causes the peak to shift to lower frequencies, where a global shift \u2206(opt)x in the negative/positive longitudinal direction of half a scatterer radius r of only the optimised scatterers results in a shift to lower/higher frequencies (orange dashed/dotted line). In both cases, the peaks are also lowered due to the deviation from the optimised configuration. Applying small random displacements \u2206(i)x,y in the range [\u2212r/4, r/4] in x- and y-direction to every single scatterer also result in a reduction of the peak height and a shift (green solid line). Performing full vectorial 3D simulations, we also find that using cylindrical scatterers with a height hscat = 7.98 mm smaller than the waveguide height h = 8 mm also lowers and shifts the peak to higher frequencies (red solid line)."
