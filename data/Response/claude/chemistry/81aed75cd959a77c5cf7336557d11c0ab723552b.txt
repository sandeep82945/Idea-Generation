 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Test the immobilization of other proteins using OaAEP1 ligation. The paper demonstrated this with eGFP, but it would be interesting to try other proteins like antibodies or enzymes. 

2. Optimize the orientation and density of proteins on the nanoparticle surface. The current method attaches proteins randomly, but controlling orientation could improve activity. Lowering density could also help with steric issues.

3. Explore the use of different nanoparticle cores beyond iron oxide, such as gold, silica, or quantum dots. The properties of the core material will impact the overall behavior.

4. Evaluate how immobilization affects protein structure and function compared to free protein. Measure kinetics, stability, etc. This is important for downstream applications.

5. Develop applications utilizing the immobilized proteins, such as assays, sensors, or catalysis. The end goal is to take advantage of the immobilized state, so testing real-world uses is the next step.
