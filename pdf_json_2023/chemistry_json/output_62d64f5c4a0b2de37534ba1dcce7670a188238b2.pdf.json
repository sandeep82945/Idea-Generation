    "abstractText": "Recycling and revalorization of waste are currently essential for sustainable growth. Mill scale, a waste product from steel production industries, which contains high levels of iron and minimal impurities, is proposed in this study as the source to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) for an enhancement of a lactate biosensor range. The synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles were coated with polydopamine (PDA) to prevent aggregation and degradation, creating a stable platform for immobilizing lactate oxidase enzyme (LOx) on their surfaces. The characterization of the Fe3O4@PDA material was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and measurement of the polydispersity index (PdI). The Fe3O4@PDA-LOx material was then deposited on a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Prussian blue (SPCE-PB) for lactate detection. The biosensor exhibited a broad, dual linear concentration-response range, one from 0.1 to 4.62 mM with a limit of detection of 0.32 mM and sensitivity of 1.54 \u03bcAmM\u22121cm\u22122, and another one from 4.62 to 149.21 mM with a limit of detection of 6.31 mM and sensitivity of 0.08 \u03bcAmM\u22121cm\u22122. The dual-range concentration response of the biosensor makes it an ideal tool for lactate determination in various applications, including sports medicine, clinical diagnosis, and industrial bioprocessing.",

            "text": "Steel is an essential material in our society; however, the steel industry is among the three largest producers of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) held in Paris in December 2021 [1] reached a significant agreement to substantially reduce global greenhouse emissions. To address this issue, the European Union (EU) has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, under its broader 2030 climate and energy framework. This commitment is part of the EU\u2019s initial nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change and preserving the planet for future generations. While the steel industry is an important contributor to our economy, it is essential to reduce carbon footprints and promote sustainable practices. Therefore, steel-making companies cope with strong pressure to reduce CO2 emission from this process plus the amount of residues that they produce. In the steel-making process, due to high temperatures, the outer skin of products oxidizes to iron oxide. This skin that can be easily removed is called mill scale. Mill scale is one of the waste materials that is produced as a result of the hot rolling of steel in all steel companies. If not revalorized, this waste ends up in landfills, requiring an enormous cost due to transportation and the associated CO2 emission. The waste can also cause the leaching of some fractions of heavy\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 957. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13110957 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 957 2 of 14\nmetals, and present a continuous need to devote more land to landfills. Therefore, it is crucial for steel-making companies to find ways to reuse and recycle mill scale. This can include reprocessing it back into the steel-making process or using it as a raw material for other industries. Initially, steps have been taken to transform the waste into a valuable product, for instance, through a carbothermic reduction into pure iron [2], or as a valuable additive in cement mortars [3] or concrete [4\u20136]. Moreover, researchers have proposed using mill scale in other applications with more added value. Mill scale has a high content of iron and very low impurities. This makes it a good candidate for the production of iron oxide pigments. Pigments are used in a wide variety of applications such as coating and construction materials [7\u201312]. During the manufacturing process of pigments, the mill scale is resized to nanosized particles. These nanoparticles present valuable properties that are now considered to be of extreme interest due to their physicochemical properties. For instance, Shahid et al. [13,14] used a coprecipitation method to obtain magnetite (Fe3O4) from the mill scale. The obtained nanoparticles are valued as an Arsenic absorbent from water due to the high surface area, which contributes to a greater absorption power, and Predescu et al. [15] have recently introduced new methodologies to obtain superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The properties of iron oxide nanoparticles, not only obtained from mill scale, are valorized in many fields (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bio-separation, purification, and biosensors) [16\u201320] due to their superparamagnetic properties at the nanoscale. Besides magnetic characteristics, recently, Gao et al. [21] discovered that intrinsic enzymatic properties could be assigned to the iron oxide nanoparticles broadening the range of applications, especially in the biosensor\u2019s development [22\u201324] or in the enhancement of biogas production [25]. In the field of biosensors, the utilization of nanoparticles with their expansive surface areas has proven instrumental in elevating the overall performance of these critical analytical tools. This enhanced performance is achieved through a twofold approach. Firstly, by capitalizing on the large surface area of nanoparticles, researchers are able to effectively immobilize a great number of bioreceptors, such as antibodies or enzymes, on the sensor surface. This amplifies the sensor\u2019s sensitivity and ability to precisely detect even the most minuscule concentrations of target molecules, ultimately pushing the limits of detection to new heights [26,27]. Moreover, the utilization of nanoparticles extends the range of measurement capabilities, allowing biosensors to tackle a broader spectrum of analyte concentrations [28]. The ability of biosensors to provide accurate measurements across this wide concentration range has broadened their applications across diverse fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Recently, the COVID pandemic has emphasized the need to move to a more sustainable medicine, and the empowerment of the patient is now considered a fundamental element of the follow-up procedure in many illnesses. Therefore, the production of biosensors in a more sustainable way and noninvasive monitoring, for instance, sweat monitoring of different metabolites such as glucose [29,30], cortisol [31], ions [32,33], or lactate [34], has become increasingly important. Lactate is one of these metabolites in which the expected concentration in sweat compared to blood is extremely different and while the lactate sensors for blood are expected to have high sensitivity, in sweat the requirement is to extend the range. Researchers are focused on expanding the range of measurement while having a feasible wearable device. Garcia et al. [35] already proposed a wide-range lactate sweat sensor based on lactate dehydrogenase to measure lactate, which requires a higher potential for measurements but the system embedded a miniaturized fuel cell to generate the required power. Imani et al. [36] presented a wearable sensing device for lactate monitoring based on a working electrode functionalized with a biocompatible biocatalytic layer (lactate oxidase (LOx)-modified Prussian blue), which enables a range of measurement up to 25 mM. Poletti et al. [37] dropcasted a layer of Nafion on top of the functionalization of the sensor and a flux of sample is created on top of the electrode to enhance the range of lactate monitoring up to 50 mM. Pribil et al. [38] proposed a lactate biosensor based on Prussian blue that can continuously\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 957 3 of 14\ndetect lactate concentrations up to 70 mM. Xuan et al. [39] proposed a new strategy for monitoring sweat lactate while also preserving the biosensor response to changes in pH and temperature by incorporating an outer layer composed of polymer, plasticizer, and lipophilic salt onto the electrode surface. Even though these examples enhanced the range of measurement of the state-of-the-art blood-designed lactate biosensors, which is around 1 mM [40\u201342], none of them used green manufacturing processes and most of them used complex and non-environmentally friendly materials, such as carbon nanotubes [43], gold nanoparticles [44], or polymers [45]. In this article, we propose a method to valorize mill scale in a high-added-value application such as the level of lactate monitoring, which is a relevant parameter not only in medical analysis or physical condition monitoring but also in the food industry, since lactate level is correlated with the fermentation level and is an indication of freshness. This paper presents a strategy to obtain iron oxide nanoparticles, which reduces the environmental impact compared to conventional methods that use iron salts as precursors. Furthermore, the utilization of iron oxide NPs in biosensor development allows the sensor to work in an extended range, expanding the use of lactate sensors to new growing fields such as wearable sweat sensing. The sensor\u2019s sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) were characterized, and its performance was compared with and without nanoparticle incorporation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sensor that incorporates mill-scale-produced iron oxide nanoparticles to develop lactate oxidase-based biosensors and achieves a working range exceeding 100 mM of lactate."

The curve illustrates that the voltammetric response approached saturation as the lactate concentration exceeded 100 mM. The current issue is that the production of hydrogen peroxide by the oxidase has reached a point here it is inhibiting the enzymatic activity of LOx. Despite the reduced amount, the quantity obtained is still sufficient for continuous monitoring of lactate concentrations over an extended period, particularly in cases where lactate levels are high. To tune the linear range, improvements can be made in the fabrication of the lactate sensor. This could involve using different polymeric membranes and/or stabilizing agents to regulate the diffusion of the analyte through the biosensor, which can enhance the operational stability of the enzyme [51]. Freeman et al. [52] proposed the addition of cellulose acetate on the surface of the working electrode, creating a diffusion-limited layer. While this layer effectively slowed the diffusion and extended the sensor\u2019s linear range to higher concentrations, the sensor was only capable of detecting lactate concentrations up to 30 mM, and the resulting reduction in current density limited its overall sensitivity. Following an adjustment of the settings, the biosensing system\u2019s analytical response was analyzed through chronoamperometry, in which varying amounts of lactate were sequentially injected and continuously stirred into PBS (pH 7.4). An optimum applied potential of \u22120.15 V was chosen based on the onset potential for electro-oxidation of lactate by the fabricated biosensor, obtained during cyclic voltammetry studies to run the amperometry experiment since this potential produced a better change in the measured signal and, therefore, more sensitivity of response. Also, this low applied potential could reduce interfering signals from other electroactive species in the sample, increase sensitivity, and produce a longer electrode lifespan. The analytical performance of the prepared Fe3O4@PDA-LOx biosensor was assessed by evaluating its response to lactate concentrations varying from 0.1 to 149.21 mM (Figure 8A). It is observed that with increasing lactate concentration the current changed, indicating good activity with efficient mass transport and fast electron transfer properties. According to the corresponding calibration plot,\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 957 10 of 14\nsee Figure 8B, the sensor response displayed two linear concentration ranges: one from 0.1 to 4.62 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9962 and sensitivity of 1.54 \u00b5AmM\u22121cm\u22122, and another from 4.62 to 149.21 mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9971 and sensitivity of 0.08 \u00b5AmM\u22121cm\u22122. The presence of two linear ranges in the lactate response of the biosensor can be explained by the interaction between the increased analyte concentration and the limited amount of LOx present in the biosensor. When the lactate concentration is low, there are sufficient active enzyme sites available for rapid substrate conversion, leading to a strong and linear current response. However, as the lactate concentration increases, the enzyme becomes saturated and unable to keep up with the rate of substrate conversion, resulting in a decrease in the number of active enzyme sites. This leads to a decrease in the current response and slower reaction kinetics, which in turn results in a decrease in sensitivity towards higher lactate concentrations [53]. Shitanda et al. [54] developed a screen-printed sensor by employing grafted MgO-templated carbon (GMgOC) as the working electrode material to achieve stable immobilization of enzymes containing amino groups and mediators. Nonetheless, the outcomes of their study validated the correlation between lactate concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mM by applying a potential of +0.1 V.

The limit of detection of the SPCE-PB/Fe3O4@PDA-LOx electrode was calculated as 0.32 mM for lactate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 4.62 mM, and 6.31 mM for concentrations ranging from 4.62 to 149.21 mM, using the following equation: LOD 3 SD m (4) where SD is the standard deviation of the current value, and m is the slope of the calibration curve [55]. From an analytical standpoint, lactate concentration in sweat is approximately 10 times higher than in blood. During a progressive, incremental exercise test, blood lactate concentration typically ranges from 8 to 10 mM, while during intense exercise it can increase to 15\u201325 mM [56]. Contrarily, in sweat, the lactate concentration can increase from 10 mM to over 100 mM with increased exercise intensity [57]. The dual linear concentration-response ranges observed in the sensor make it highly versatile and suitable for lactate determination in a wide range of sample types, regardless of their lactate content. The lower concentration range, spanning from 0.1 to 4.62 mM, enables the detection of low levels of lactate, making it invaluable for samples with potentially low lactate concentrations, such as biological fluids: blood, sweat, urine, and cell cultures for lactate production monitoring. Conversely, the higher concentration range of 4.62 to 149.21 mM is advantageous for samples with high lactate content, such as those found in muscle tissue during intense exercise or in fermentation processes. This range ensures accurate and precise quantification of lactate concentration, even at high levels. The performance of the lactate biosensor proposed in this study was evaluated and compared with similar devices reported by the scientific literature (Table 2). However, due to the significant differences in the manufacturing processes, it is challenging to make a direct comparison between the biosensors. Nonetheless, the biosensor developed in this study demonstrated exceptional sensitivity across a broad linear range, utilizing a low potential value. The excellent performance of the biosensor can be attributed to the utilization of magnetite nanoparticles synthesized from raw mill scale. These nanoparticles exhibited unique physicochemical properties, which contributed to the sensitivity and specificity of the biosensor. The promising results obtained from this study suggest that synthesized magnetite nanoparticles are an excellent candidate for monitoring lactate levels in a wide range.

It runs at a very low applied potential (\u22120.15 V), which minimizes interfering signals from other electroactive species and increases sensitivity, leading to more reliable and efficient lactate sensing. The biosensor showed the ability to detect lactate in two distinct linear concentration ranges, one from 0.1 to 4.62 mM, with a limit of detection of 0.32 mM, and another one from 4.62 to 149.21 mM with a limit of detection of 6.31 mM, a range that expanded the current state-of-the-art electrochemical biosensors by 50% and enables the use of these sensors in such wearable applications for lactate monitoring in sweat. The proposed lactate oxidase-based biosensor exhibited good sensitivity in both concentration ranges, with a value of 1.54 \u00b5AmM\u22121cm\u22122 for the lower range, and 0.08 \u00b5AmM\u22121cm\u22122 for the higher range.
