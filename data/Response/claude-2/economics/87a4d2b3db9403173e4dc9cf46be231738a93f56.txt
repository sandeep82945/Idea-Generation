 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of adjusting for other environmental factors besides age on health system efficiency scores. The paper focused only on age, but factors like income, education, health behaviors could also be adjusted for. 

2. Test the proposed age-adjusted health expenditure model using panel data over time rather than cross-sectional data. This could provide insights into how the model performs when analyzing changes in efficiency over time.

3. Apply the age-adjusted model to specific healthcare sectors rather than the health system as a whole, like hospitals or primary care, to see if it improves efficiency analyses.

4. Collect data on health expenditures by age group for more countries to allow better age-adjustment rather than relying on the OECD subset. This could improve the accuracy of the model.

5. Compare the proposed age-adjustment model to other methods like directly adjusting for proximity to death rather than using age as a proxy. This could reveal which approach is optimal.
