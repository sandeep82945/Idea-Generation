            "text": "2 of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton (Sagan & Chyba 1990), Pluto (Telfer et al. 2018) and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (Thomas et al. 2015; Jia et al. 2017). Driven by fluid drag and gravity, most transported sand-sized and larger grains regularly interact with the bed surface as flow turbulence is too weak to suspend them. For denser fluids, such as water and most other liquids, this near-surface grain motion occurs in the form of rolling, sliding and small hops (bedload), whereas for lighter fluids, like most gases, grains move in more energetic hops (saltation). At equilibrium, the deposition of transported grains on the bed is exactly balanced by the entrainment of bed grains into the transport layer. The rate at which equilibrium aeolian transport takes place and the threshold wind speed below which it ceases constitute the two arguably most important statistical transport properties in the context of bedform formation and evolution in natural environments (Kok 2010a; Dur\u00e1n Vinent et al. 2019). In particular, in natural environments, topography inhomogeneities, strong turbulent fluctuations and a variety ofwind-unrelatedmechanisms to generate airborne grains, along with very long natural sediment fetches, can plausibly initiate transport and lead to equilibrium transport above the cessation threshold (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020, section 3.3.3.4). This may even be true in environments where the aeolian transport initiation threshold for an idealised flat sediment bed ismuch larger than the cessation threshold, like potentially onMars (Kok 2010a), Pluto (Telfer et al. 2018) and Saturn\u2019s moon Titan (Comola et al. 2022), as well as in Antarctica. In fact, although Antarctica\u2019s surface is covered by very cohesive (Pomeroy & Gray 1990) old snow and ice (cohesion increases the initiation threshold probably much more than the cessation threshold (Comola et al. 2019b, 2022; P\u00e4htz et al. 2021; Besnard et al. 2022)), aeolian snow and ice transport occurs there even at relatively low wind speeds that are likely much below the initiation threshold (Leonard et al. 2011). Since the highly random, collective motion of bed and transported grains eludes a rigorous analytical description, existing physical models of equilibrium aeolian transport have relied on drastically coarse-graining the particle phase of the aeolian transport layer above the bed surface (Ungar & Haff 1987; Andreotti 2004; Claudin & Andreotti 2006; Kok & Renno 2009; Kok 2010b; Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011; Berzi et al. 2016, 2017; L\u00e4mmel & Kroy 2017; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a, 2020; Andreotti et al. 2021; P\u00e4htz et al. 2021; Comola et al. 2022; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). The most common modelling approach is to represent the grain motion by a single or multiple saltation trajectories. Depending on the number and kind of considered trajectories and the assumed outcome of grain\u2013bed collisions, such models can yield fundamentally different scaling laws for the cessation threshold and/or equilibrium transport rate, with predictions varying by about an order of magnitude when applied to Martian-pressure atmospheric conditions (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). One reason for the strong variability of both existing cessation threshold and equilibrium transport rate predictions is a lack of consensus on the physical picture behind the cessation threshold. On the one hand, it has been modelled as an \u2018impact entrainment threshold\u2019 (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020), the smallest wind velocity at which random captures of saltating grains by the bed can be compensated by the splash of bed grains due to grain\u2013bed impacts (Andreotti 2004; Claudin & Andreotti 2006; Kok & Renno 2009; Kok 2010b; Andreotti et al. 2021; Comola et al. 2022). On the other hand, it has been modelled as a \u2018rebound threshold\u2019 (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020), the smallest wind velocity required to replenish the energy saltating grains lose when rebounding with the bed, independent of grain capture and splash (Berzi et al. 2017; P\u00e4htz et al. 2021; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). We previously proposed and supported the hypothesis that both these dynamic thresholds play a role in saltation dynamics: the former as the dynamic threshold of continuous and the latter as the dynamic threshold of intermittent saltation and therefore as the actual cessation threshold (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a; P\u00e4htz et al. 2020, 2021). If true, this could have the unintended consequence that measurements of one are mistaken for the other dynamic threshold. For example, P\u00e4htz et al. (2021) proposed that\n3 the recent dynamic-threshold measurements in a low-pressure wind tunnel by Andreotti et al. (2021) may constitute data of the continuous-transport threshold, and not of the cessation threshold as the experimenters claimed. This would be problematic as these data have been used to develop new cessation threshold models and compare their predictive capabilities with those of older ones (Andreotti et al. 2021; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). Here, we show that, under relatively mild assumptions, one can obtain insights into the physics of the cessation threshold without resorting to coarse-graining the particle phase of the aeolian transport layer above the bed surface. In detail, if the bed surface can be considered as a flat boundary, with scale-free boundary conditions describing the outcome of grain\u2013bed collisions, and the driving wind as a smooth inner turbulent boundary layer flow that interacts with grains via Stokes drag, then the threshold shear velocity, appropriately non-dimensionalised, is a function of only one dimensionless control parameter, rather than two expected from dimensional analysis (section 3). We confirm this prediction, and therefore its underlying assumptions, with numerical simulations using an existing discrete element method (DEM)-based numerical model (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2012, introduced in section 2) of equilibrium transport of cohesionless non-suspended sediments. The simulated transport conditions encompass almost seven orders of magnitude in the particle\u2013fluid density ratio \ud835\udc60, ranging from subaqueous transport (\ud835\udc60 = 2.65) to aeolian transport in the highly rarefied atmosphere of Pluto (\ud835\udc60 = 107), whereas previous DEM-based sediment transport studies did not exceed terrestrial aeolian conditions (\ud835\udc60 \u2248 2000). We also use the simulation data to semiempirically derive simple scaling laws for the cessation threshold and equilibrium transport rate, and to test existing models (section 3). The derived scaling laws are consistent with experimental data, except the dynamic-threshold measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021), in line with the aforementioned hypothesis that the latter constitute data of the continuoustransport threshold rather than the cessation threshold (discussed in more detail in section 4)."

Spherical grains (104\u2212105) with mild polydispersity are confined in a quasi-two-dimensional domain of length \u2248 103\ud835\udc51, with periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction, and interact via normal repulsion (restitution coefficient \ud835\udc52 = 0.9) and tangential friction (contact friction coefficient \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc50 = 0.5). The bottom-most grain layer is glued on a bottomwall, while the top of the simulation domain is reflective but so high that it is never reached by transported grains. The Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) equations are combined with a semi-empirical mixing length closure that accounts for the viscous sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer and ensures a smooth\n4 hydrodynamic transition from high to low particle concentration at the bed surface:\nd\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a d\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udf05\n[ 1 \u2212 exp ( \u2212 \u221a\ufe02 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a\n7\ud835\udf08\n)] , (2.2)\nwhere \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc67) is the height-dependent mixing length, \ud835\udf05 = 0.4 the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant and \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc67) the mean flow velocity field. This parametrisation quantitatively reproduces measurements of \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc67) in the absence of transport. Simulations with this numerical model are insensitive to \ud835\udc52 and, therefore, insensitive to viscous damping (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a,b). The simulations reproduce measurements of the rate and cessation threshold of terrestrial aeolian transport, and viscous and turbulent subaqueous transport (figures 1 and 3 of P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n (2018a) and figure 4 of P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n (2020)), height profiles of relevant equilibrium transport properties (figure 2 of P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n (2018a) and figure 6 of Dur\u00e1n et al. (2014a)) and aeolian ripple formation (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2014b).\n2.1. Average of simulated quantities We define two types of averages of a particle property \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d. Based on the spatial homogeneity of the simulations, the mass-weighted average of \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d over all particles within an infinitesimal vertical layer (\ud835\udc67, \ud835\udc67 + d\ud835\udc67) and all time steps (after reaching the steady state) is (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b)\n\u3008\ud835\udc34\u3009(\ud835\udc67) = \u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5d \u2208(\ud835\udc67,\ud835\udc67+d\ud835\udc67) \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d/ \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5d \u2208(\ud835\udc67,\ud835\udc67+d\ud835\udc67) \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d, (2.3)\nwhere\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5d are the particle mass and elevation, respectively. We also define the average of a vertical profile \u3008\ud835\udc34\u3009(\ud835\udc67) over the transport layer as (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a)\n\ud835\udc34 = \u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc34\u3009d\ud835\udc67/ \u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0cd\ud835\udc67, (2.4)\nwhere \ud835\udf0c is the local particle concentration. The bed surface elevation \ud835\udc67 = 0 is defined as the elevation at which \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc54d\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009/d\ud835\udc67 is maximal (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b), where \u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009 is the average grain velocity in the streamwise direction and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc54 (\ud835\udc67) = \u2212 \u222b \u221e \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc67\u3009d\ud835\udc67\u2032 the normalbed granular pressure, with \ud835\udc82 the acceleration of grains by non-contact forces.\n2.2. Calculation of transport rate and cessation threshold We calculate the sediment transport rate \ud835\udc44 as (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b)\n\ud835\udc44 = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67. (2.5)\nWhen \ud835\udc44 vanishes, the grain-borne shear stress at the bed surface \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc54 (0) also vanishes, with \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc54 (\ud835\udc67) = \u222b \u221e \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67\u2032 the grain-borne shear stress profile. We therefore extrapolate the cessation threshold value \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc61 of the fluid shear stress \ud835\udf0f at which \ud835\udc44 vanishes using the approximate relation (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b)\n\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc54 (0) = \ud835\udf0f \u2212 \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc61 , (2.6)\nwhere we treat \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc61 as a fit parameter.\n2.3. Dimensionless control parameters and rescaling of physical quantities The average properties of equilibrium sediment transport are mainly determined by a few grain and environmental parameters: the grain and fluid density (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 , respectively),\nFocus on Fluids articles must not exceed this page length\nmedian grain diameter (\ud835\udc51), kinematic fluid viscosity (\ud835\udf08), fluid shear velocity (\ud835\udc62\u2217 \u2261 \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udf0f/\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 ) and gravitational constant (\ud835\udc54) or its buoyancy-reduced value ?\u0303? \u2261 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 /\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc54 (for air, ?\u0303? ' \ud835\udc54). Physical quantities with a superscript \u2018+\u2019 are rescaled using units of \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d, ?\u0303? and \ud835\udf08. For example,\n\ud835\udc51+ = ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)2/3, (2.7) \ud835\udc62+\u2217 = \ud835\udc62\u2217/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)1/3, (2.8) \ud835\udc44+ = \ud835\udc44/(\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf08). (2.9)\nAswe show, this rescaling is well suited to describe the relevant physical processes underlying the cessation threshold scaling. A given environmental condition is fully determined by the values of three dimensionless numbers (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020):\n\ud835\udc60 \u2261 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d/\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 = 1/\ud835\udf0c+\ud835\udc53 , (2.10) \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e \u2261 \u221a\ufe03 \ud835\udc60?\u0303?\ud835\udc513/\ud835\udf08 = \u221a \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+3/2, (2.11)\n\u0398 \u2261 \ud835\udc622\u2217/(\ud835\udc60?\u0303?\ud835\udc51) = \ud835\udc62+2\u2217 /(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+). (2.12)\nNumerical simulations are carried out for various combinations of the particle\u2013fluid density ratio \ud835\udc60 and Galileo number \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e, exceeding previously simulated conditions by almost four orders of magnitude in \ud835\udc60 (table 1), and for Shields numbers \u0398 ranging from weak conditions near its cessation threshold value \u0398\ud835\udc61 to intense conditions far above \u0398\ud835\udc61 .\n6 10 -5\n10 -4\n10 -3\n10 -2\n10 -1\n10 0\n10 1\n10 2\n10 3\n10 -1\n10 0\n10 1\n10 2\n10 3\n2.4. Sediment transport regimes for near-threshold conditions Since the mixing length-based Reynolds-averaged description of hydrodynamics used in the numerical model neglects turbulent fluctuations around the mean turbulent flow, simulated sediment transport is always non-suspended. Near the cessation threshold (subscript \ud835\udc61), nonsuspended transport occurs as either bedload or saltation (see the introduction), which we distinguish through the criterion (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a)\nTransport regime = { bedload if \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? < \ud835\udc51 saltation if \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? > \ud835\udc51 . (2.13)\nThe quantity \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67/?\u0303? describes the contribution of hopping grains to the characteristic transport height of all transported grains \ud835\udc67, where the latter also include those that role and slide. In particular, for saltation near the cessation threshold, \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? ' \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 , whereas \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? is significantly smaller than \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc61 for bedload transport (figure 1). Henceforth, \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67/?\u0303? and \ud835\udc67 are termed hop height and transport layer thickness, respectively, for simplicity."

First, it shows the data and scaling laws of the cessation threshold and equilibrium transport rate obtained from the simulations for the saltation regime (section 3.1). Second, it presents semi-empirical physical justifications of these laws, including a first-principle-based proof of the statement that, under relatively mild assumptions, the rescaled cessation threshold \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 is a function of only one dimensionless control parameter (section 3.2). Third, it tests existing models from the literature against the numerical data (section 3.3). Fourth, it provides semi-empirical generalisations of the scaling laws that bridge between the saltation and bedload regimes (section 3.4) and shows how they\nIversen & White 1982; Greeley et al. 1984; Burr et al. 2015, 2020; Swann et al. 2020) and cessation threshold measurements for aeolian transport of quartz (Bagnold 1937; Martin & Kok 2018; Zhu et al. 2019), clay loam (Chepil 1945) and snow at sea level (Sugiura et al. 1998) and high altitude (Clifton et al. 2006, HA). The dynamic-threshold measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021) may constitute data of the continuous-transport threshold rather than the cessation threshold (discussed in section 4).

Simulation data and scaling laws for saltation 3.1.1. Cessation threshold Of the physical parameters affecting the shear velocity at the cessation threshold \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 , the surface air pressure \ud835\udc43 varies most strongly with the planetary environment. Furthermore, for a given planetary environment, the grain size \ud835\udc51 is the most strongly varying relevant physical parameter. To isolate the effect of \ud835\udc43 on \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 , we normalise \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 in terms of relevant parameters that do neither depend on \ud835\udc43 nor on \ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc48\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u2261 \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61/(\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d)1/3 (using that the dynamic viscosity \ud835\udf07 = \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udf08 does not depend on \ud835\udc43), and compare it with the density ratio \ud835\udc60, which incorporates the effect of \ud835\udc43 isolated from that of \ud835\udc51. For saltation, the simulations reveal a lower bound for \ud835\udc48\u2217\ud835\udc61 scaling as \ud835\udc601/3 (figure 2, filled circles). This is distinct from the classical scaling of the saltation initiation threshold with \ud835\udc601/2 (Greeley et al. 1976, 1980; Iversen &White 1982; Greeley et al. 1984; Burr et al. 2015, 2020; Swann et al. 2020) (figure 2, gray crosses), which follows from a balance between flow-induced and resisting forces or torques acting in bed surface grains (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020). Roughly the same \ud835\udc601/2-scaling was also found for the dynamic-threshold measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021) carried out in a low-pressure wind tunnel (figure 2, black crosses). As\n8 10 0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nmentioned in the introduction and discussed in more detail in section 4, these measurements may constitute data of the continuous-transport threshold rather than the cessation threshold. In addition to its \ud835\udc601/3-scaling, \ud835\udc48\u2217\ud835\udc61 varies with the normalised median grain diameter\n\ud835\udc37\u2217 \u2261 \u221a \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+ = \u221a \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51?\u0303?/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)2/3, described by the following relationship between the rescaled cessation threshold \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 (note that \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc48\u2217\ud835\udc61/(\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1)1/3) and \ud835\udc37\u2217:\n\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc62 +min \u2217\ud835\udc61 max\n[( \ud835\udc37\u2217\n\ud835\udc37min\u2217\n)\u22121/2 , ( \ud835\udc37\u2217\n\ud835\udc37min\u2217\n)1/2] . (3.1)\nIt contains the parameters \ud835\udc37min\u2217 and \ud835\udc62+min\u2217\ud835\udc61 , which denote the location and magnitude, respectively, of the minimum of the function \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc37\u2217), corresponding to the lower bound of\ud835\udc48\u2217\ud835\udc61 for saltation in figure 2. Equation (3.1) is consistent with the simulations (figure 3(a)) and experiments (figure 3(b)) for the saltation regime, though with slightly different parameter values: (\ud835\udc37min\u2217 , \ud835\udc62+min\u2217\ud835\udc61 ) = (16, 1.6) versus (\ud835\udc37min\u2217 , \ud835\udc62+min\u2217\ud835\udc61 ) = (18, 2.3), respectively. The associated relative change of \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 by 2.3/1.6 ' 1.4 is well within the typical systematic uncertainty of cessation threshold measurements. For example, Creyssels et al. (2009) reported \u0398\ud835\udc61 = 0.009 for their terrestrial wind tunnel experiments (\ud835\udc51 = 242 \ud835\udf07m), obtained from extrapolating transport rate measurements to vanishing transport using the transport rate model of Ungar & Haff (1987), whereas P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n (2020) reported \u0398\ud835\udc61 = 0.0035 for the very same data using a different transport rate model for the extrapolation, resulting in a relative change of \u221a\ufe01 0.009/0.0035 ' 1.6.\nlines correspond to (3.2).\n3.1.2. Equilibrium transport rate The simulations of saltation and experiments reasonably collapse on the master curve (figure 4)\n\ud835\udc44+/\ud835\udc51+3/2 = 1.7\ud835\udc601/3(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 ) + 12\ud835\udc601/3(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 )2 (3.2) if \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e \u221a \ud835\udc60 > 81. The vast majority of planetary transport occurring in nature and most of the\nsimulated saltation conditions satisfy this criterion. Note that \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e \u221a \ud835\udc60 can be interpreted as a Stokes-like number (Berzi et al. 2016), encoding the importance of grain inertia relative to viscous drag forcing, and controls the transition to viscous bedload (P\u00e4htz et al. 2021).\n3.2. Physical justifications of saltation scaling laws 3.2.1. First-principle-based proof that \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 is a function of only \ud835\udc37\u2217 In general, the shear velocity at the cessation threshold \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 is a function of the five control parameters \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc53 , \ud835\udf08, ?\u0303? and \ud835\udc51 (Claudin & Andreotti 2006). These parameters involve three units (mass, length and time). According to the \u03a0 theorem (Barenblatt 1996), the physical system, and therefore any dimensionless system property such as \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 , is then controlled by two dimensionless numbers, for example the density ratio \ud835\udc60 and the normalised median grain diameter \ud835\udc37\u2217: \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc37\u2217). (3.3) To determine the function \ud835\udc53 in (3.3), existing cessation threshold models have made various idealisations of the fluid-particle system (Claudin & Andreotti 2006; Kok 2010b; Berzi et al. 2016, 2017; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a; Andreotti et al. 2021; P\u00e4htz et al. 2021; Gunn\n10\n& Jerolmack 2022). In particular, they all drastically coarse-grain the particle phase of the aeolian transport layer above the bed surface, either by representing the entire grain motion by identical periodic saltation trajectories (Claudin & Andreotti 2006; Kok 2010b; Berzi et al. 2016, 2017; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a; Andreotti et al. 2021; P\u00e4htz et al. 2021; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022) or by an average motion behaviour (Kok 2010b; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a) that is mathematically equivalent to an identical periodic trajectory representation (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020). Here, in contrast to previous models, we do not resort to any such coarse-graining. Instead, we idealise the system in the following comparably mild manner. (i) We consider only buoyancy and Stokes drag as fluid\u2013grain interactions, neglecting form drag contributions. This would be justified if relatively fast saltating grains dominated the near-threshold grain dynamics, since comparably faster grains exhibit comparably lower fluid-particle velocity differences and, thus, comparably less form drag relative to Stokes drag. (ii) Due to the typically relatively small shear Reynolds numbers associated with planetary transport near the cessation threshold, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e \u221a \u0398\ud835\udc61 . 10, we consider a smooth inner turbulent boundary layer mean flow velocity profile \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc67), neglecting hydrodynamically rough contributions (and turbulent fluctuations, which are also neglected in the numerical simulations). (iii) Since vanishingly few grains are in motion sufficiently close to the cessation threshold, we neglect the feedback of the grain motion on the flow. (iv) Since saltation trajectories are typically much larger than the grain size, we consider an idealised flat bed and assume that the zero level of the flow velocity coincides with the grain elevation at grain\u2013bed impact (\ud835\udc67 = 0), neglecting the effect of the flow very near the bed surface to the overall grain motion. (v) While we do not specify the distribution of grain lift-off velocities \ud835\udc53\u2191 and grain impact velocities \ud835\udc53\u2193, we assume that the boundary conditions mapping \ud835\udc53\u2193 to \ud835\udc53\u2191 in the steady state are scale-free, as for grain\u2013bed rebounds (Beladjine et al. 2007), neglecting the potential effect of \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51 on grain\u2013bed collisions. Most grains ejected by the splash of a grain\nimpacting the bed with velocity \ud835\udc97\u2193 exhibit a velocity on the order of \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51 and only the few grains corresponding to the upper-tail end of the distribution exhibit an ejection velocity proportional to |\ud835\udc97\u2193 | (L\u00e4mmel et al. 2017). Hence, this assumption effectively means that grain\u2013bed rebounds and/or rare extreme ejection events dominate the saltation dynamics relevant for the cessation threshold scaling. Under the above assumptions, the equations of motion for a given grain are (P\u00e4htz et al. 2021)\n\u00a4\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc67 = \u22121 \u2212 \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 , (3.4) \u00a4\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc65 = (\ud835\udc62+\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc65)/\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 , (3.5) \ud835\udc62+\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc62 + \u2217 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc62+\u2217 \ud835\udc67+), (3.6)\nwhere \ud835\udc97+ is the rescaled grain velocity, \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 = 4\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+2/(3Re\ud835\udc50) the rescaled Stokes settling velocity (obtained from the high-viscosity limit of (2.1)), and \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc4b) denotes a function describing \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65/\ud835\udc62\u2217 for an undisturbed smooth inner turbulent boundary layer. It obeys \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc4b) = \ud835\udc4b within the viscous sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer (\ud835\udc4b . 5) and \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc4b) ' \ud835\udf05\u22121 ln(9\ud835\udc4b) within its log-layer (\ud835\udc4b & 30). Extrapolated into the transitional buffer layer in between, both profiles would intersect at about \ud835\udc4b = 11, which is why \ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08 = 11\ud835\udf08/\ud835\udc62\u2217 is termed viscous-sublayer thickness. Parametrised by \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc62+\u2217 , (3.4)-(3.6)map \ud835\udc53\u2191 to \ud835\udc53\u2193. Combinedwith the scale-free boundary conditions, mapping \ud835\udc53\u2193 back to \ud835\udc53\u2191, they imply that the grain motion is fully determined by\nRapids articles must not exceed this page length\n11\nand viscous-sublayer thickness \ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61 = 11\ud835\udf08/\ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 near the cessation threshold. (b) Rescaled transport layer-averaged fluid velocity \ud835\udc62+\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 versus (\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 ) 1/2 \ud835\udc61 near the cessation threshold. (c) Plot of \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63 +2 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 versus \ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udc60 . Symbols correspond to numerical simulations of saltation\n(see figure 1 for the definition) for various combinations of the density ratio \ud835\udc60 and Galileo number \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e (see table 1 and figure 1). The solid lines in (a), (c) and (b) correspond to\n(3.9), (3.10) and \ud835\udc62+\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 = 6(\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 ) 1/2 \ud835\udc61 , respectively.\n\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc62+\u2217 . For a given \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 , the cessation threshold \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 then corresponds to the smallest value of \ud835\udc62+\u2217 for which a solution of the combined system exists (P\u00e4htz et al. 2021). This implies that there is a function \ud835\udc53 mapping \ud835\udc37\u2217 = \u221a\ufe01 18\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 (valid for Re\ud835\udc50 = 24, the standard case of non-rarefied drag) to \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 : \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc37\u2217). (3.7) In summary, the above assumptions simplify the general two-parametric dependence of \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 in (3.3) to the one-parametric dependence in (3.7), in agreement with (3.1).\n3.2.2. Semi-empirical model of cessation threshold scaling While the above analysis explains why \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc37\u2217) in (3.1), it does not yield the function \ud835\udc53 itself. Here, we derive the expression for \ud835\udc53 in (3.1) guided by the simulations. The latter show that the minimum \ud835\udc62+min\u2217\ud835\udc61 for saltation occurs when the hop height \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? is about equal to the viscous-sublayer thickness \ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61 = 11\ud835\udf08/\ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 near the cessation threshold (figure 5(a)). This can be explained using the empirical, yet physically reasonable, simulation-supported proportionality between the average fluid velocity \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 and (\ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67)1/2\ud835\udc61 near the cessation threshold (figure 5(b)). In fact, averaging (3.6) over all grain trajectories and the transport layer, using the approximation \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc67+)\ud835\udc61 ' \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc67+\ud835\udc61 ), and using this proportionality approximately yields for saltation (\ud835\udc67+\ud835\udc61 ' \ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 , see figure 1):\n\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u221d  \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63 +2 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53 2\ud835\udc62 ( \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63 +2 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 )  1/3 . (3.8)\nWithin the viscous sublayer (\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 . 5), this relation simplifies to \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u221d (\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 )\u22121/3 and within the log-layer approximately to \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u221d (\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 )1/3, neglecting the logarithmic term. The crossover between the two power laws occurs about at \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 = 11, that is, when the\n12\nhop height exceeds the viscous-sublayer thickness (\ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61/?\u0303? = \ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61 ). Hence, the parabolic law\n\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc62 +min \u2217\ud835\udc61 max  ( \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 ?\u0303?\ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61 )\u22121/3 , ( \ud835\udc632\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 ?\u0303?\ud835\udeff\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc61 )1/3 (3.9) fits the saltation data reasonably well (solid line in figure 5(a)). Following from the analysis we have used to deduce (3.7), the grain kinematics near the\ncessation threshold, and thus \ud835\udc63+2\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 , should be controlled by \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 or \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 . Indeed, the simulations of saltation suggest the empirical relation (figure 5(c))\n\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc63 +2 \ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc61 = 1.5\ud835\udc63 +3/4 \ud835\udc60 , (3.10)\nwhich leads to (3.1) with \ud835\udc37min\u2217 = \u221a 18(11/1.5)2/3 ' 16.\nAccording to the above model, the grain size scaling of \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 in (3.1), despite being mathematically equivalent to the well-known cohesive (\ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u223c \ud835\udc51\u22121/2, left branch) and cohesionless (\ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 \u223c \ud835\udc511/2, right branch) limits of the saltation initiation threshold (Shao & Lu 2000), follows purely from hydrodynamics rather than the onset of cohesion at small grain sizes.\n3.2.3. Physics behind equilibrium transport rate scaling Analytical, physical models of the equilibrium transport rate\ud835\udc44 for aeolian saltation typically separate it into the mass of transported sediment per unit area of the bed \ud835\udc40 and its average streamwise velocity \ud835\udc49 through \ud835\udc44 = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc49 . In most models, it is reasoned that the scaling of \ud835\udc49 is in one way or another linked to grain\u2013bed collisions, and since the average outcome of grain\u2013bed collisions should be roughly independent of the wind speed at equilibrium, \ud835\udc49 is taken as equal to its near-threshold value\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 (Ungar &Haff 1987; Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011; Kok et al. 2012; Berzi et al. 2016). However, it has been shown that, for sufficiently intense saltation, midair collisions significantly disturb grain trajectories (Carneiro et al. 2013; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020; Ralaiarisoa et al. 2020), leading to an additional additive term increasing as \ud835\udc40+/\ud835\udc51+ (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020):\n\ud835\udc44+ = \ud835\udc40+\ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 (1 + \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40+/\ud835\udc51+), (3.11) where \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc40 is a constant parameter. It is not trivial to evaluate the scalings of \ud835\udc40+ and \ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 with the simulation data, since extracting \ud835\udc40 and \ud835\udc49 from DEM-based numerical transport simulations is ambiguous (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2012; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b). One possible way is to define \ud835\udc40 as the mass \ud835\udc400 of grains moving above the bed surface (\ud835\udc67 = 0) per unit bed area and \ud835\udc49 as their average streamwise velocity (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b):\n\ud835\udc40 \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0cd\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc400, (3.12)\n\ud835\udc49 \u2261 \u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67\u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0cd\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 . (3.13)\nThis definition uses that most (but not all) sediment transport occurs at elevations \ud835\udc67 > 0, especially for saltation and, therefore, \ud835\udc400\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 = \u222b \u221e 0 \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67 ' \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc44 (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018b). Alternatively, one can define \ud835\udc49 as the mass flux-weighted average \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5e of the streamwise velocity of all grains and \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5e , the associated value of \ud835\udc40 , as \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5e \u2261 \ud835\udc44/\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5e (Dur\u00e1n\n13\net al. 2012):\n\ud835\udc40 \u2261\n(\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67 )2\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63 2 \ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5e , (3.14)\n\ud835\udc49 \u2261 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63 2 \ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\u3009d\ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc5e , (3.15)\nwhere \u00b7\ud835\udc5e \u2261 1 \ud835\udc44 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udf0c\u3008\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u00b7\u3009d\ud835\udc67.\nFor the above two definitions of \ud835\udc40 and\ud835\udc49 , the simulations are roughly described by scaling laws in which a comparably small part of the \ud835\udc601/3-scaling factor in (3.2) goes into \ud835\udc40+/\ud835\udc51+ and a comparably large part into \ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 / \u221a \ud835\udc51+ (figure 6). However, the exact partitioning of \ud835\udc601/3 depends on the chosen definition (figures 6(a) and 6(b) versus figures 6(c) and 6(d)):\n\ud835\udc40+0 \u221d \ud835\udc60 1/12\ud835\udc51+(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 ), \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc601/4\n\u221a \ud835\udc51+, (3.16)\n\ud835\udc40+\ud835\udc5e \u221d \ud835\udc51+(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 ), \ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc601/3 \u221a \ud835\udc51+. (3.17)\nThe latter scaling is consistent with the prediction \ud835\udc40+ \u221d \ud835\udc51+(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 ) from physical models (Ungar & Haff 1987; Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011; Berzi et al. 2016; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020) and with (3.2) when combined with (3.11). However, it means that \ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc601/3 \u221a \ud835\udc51+, which is a highly\nunusual scaling, different from the existing models \ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 \u221d \u221a \ud835\udc51+ (Ungar & Haff 1987; Berzi et al. 2016) and \ud835\udc49+\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011; Kok et al. 2012; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020).\n3.3. Test of existing models against simulations of saltation 3.3.1. Test of cessation threshold models The most important assumption that led to the simulation-supported statement that the rescaled cessation threshold \ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 is solely controlled by the normalised median grain diameter \ud835\udc37\u2217 in section 3.2.1 is that of scale-free boundary conditions. The only existing cessation threshold model with scale-free boundary condition is that of P\u00e4htz et al. (2021), which we here compare with the most recent alternative, that of Gunn & Jerolmack (2022). The latter\u2019s most important feature is that it superimposes a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e-dependent damping on the scalefree laws describing grain\u2013bed rebounds, where the damping function is essentially fitted to agreement with experimental cessation threshold data. We find that, while the model of P\u00e4htz et al. (2021) captures the simulation data very well, the model of Gunn & Jerolmack (2022), with its drag and lift laws being modified to those employed in the simulations (i.e., (2.1) and no lift) for a fair comparison, is in very strong disagreement (figure 7). This is discussed in section 4.\n3.3.2. Test of equilibrium transport rate models The simulations of saltation are not or not well captured by the twomost widely used physical models of the equilibrium aeolian transport rate: the model of Ungar & Haff (1987) and others (e.g., Jenkins & Valance 2014; Berzi et al. 2016),\ud835\udc44+/\ud835\udc51+3/2 = \ud835\udc531(\u0398\u2212\u0398\ud835\udc61 ) (figure 8(a)) and the model of Dur\u00e1n et al. (2011) and others (Kok et al. 2012; P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020), \ud835\udc44+/(\ud835\udc51+\ud835\udc62+\u2217\ud835\udc61 ) = \ud835\udc532(\u0398 \u2212 \u0398\ud835\udc61 ) (figure 8(b)).\n3.4.

When compared with the simulations, these equations perform significantly better than the unified model of the cessation threshold and equilibrium transport rate of P\u00e4htz et al.

We corrected the raw laboratory data by Smart & Jaeggi (1983) and Capart & Fraccarollo (2011) for sidewall drag using the method described in section 2.3 of Guo (2015) and for steep bed slopes using \ud835\udc622\u2217 |corrected = \ud835\udc622\u2217/ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc, with \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc \u2261 1 \u2212 tan\ud835\udefc/0.63 (P\u00e4htz et al. 2021).

Effect of drag law and generalisation to drag in rarefied atmospheres The analysis in section 3.2.1 suggests that the normalised median grain diameter \ud835\udc37\u2217 \u2261 \u221a \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+ in (3.1) and (3.18) should be redefined as \ud835\udc37\u2217 \u2261 \u221a\ufe01 18\ud835\udc63+\ud835\udc60 = \u221a\ufe01 24\ud835\udc60/Re\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc51+ (from (2.1)), which\nis equal to \u221a \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51+ only in the case of non-rarefied drag (Re\ud835\udc50 = 24). To test this prediction as well as the effect of the form drag coefficient\ud835\udc36\u221e \ud835\udc51 , we carried out additional simulations using \ud835\udc36\u221e \ud835\udc51\n= 0 and Re\ud835\udc50 = [6, 24, 96] for a few saltation conditions. We find that these simulations, indeed, still satisfy (3.18) and therefore (3.1) when the redefined \ud835\udc37\u2217 is used (figure 12(a)). They also still satisfy (3.19) and therefore (3.2), which are not affected by the redefinition of \ud835\udc37\u2217 (figure 12(b)). In rarefied atmospheres, the mean free path \ud835\udf06 of the air molecules becomes comparable\nto the median grain diameter \ud835\udc51, or the Knudsen number \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b \u2261 \ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc51 = \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc58/2\ud835\udc60/(\ud835\udc50+\ud835\udc51+) (Crowe et al. 2012), with \ud835\udc50+ = \ud835\udc50/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)1/3 the rescaled speed of sound and \ud835\udc58 the adiabatic exponent, comparable to unity. This leads to a \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b-dependent correction \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b \u2261 1+\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b[2.49+ 0.84 exp(\u22121.74/\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b)] (Crowe et al. 2012) of Stokes drag via Re\ud835\udc50 = 24/ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b. Note that typically \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5b ' 1 for \ud835\udc60 . 106. Hence, the results in figure 12 support that the following\n18\nfigure 1 for the definition).

            "text": "4.1. Choice of dynamic-threshold measurements for evaluation of cessation threshold models Equilibrium saltation becomes intermittent below the continuous-transport threshold, characterised by alternating periods of equilibrium saltation and periods of rest (Martin & Kok 2018). The cessation threshold is therefore the wind strength at which equilibrium saltation would cease if extrapolated from the continuous-transport regime, that is, as the zero-point of equilibrium transport equations such as (2.6) or (3.2). It is also the threshold of intermittent saltation (Martin & Kok 2018). To evaluate the cessation threshold scaling law in (3.1), we have therefore chosen exclusively measurements that either extrapolate continuous saltation in some manner to vanishing transport (Clifton et al. 2006; Zhu et al. 2019) or directly measure the cessation of intermittent saltation (Bagnold 1937; Chepil 1945; Sugiura et al. 1998; Martin & Kok 2018; Zhu et al. 2019). Both methods require that equilibrium transport conditions can at least temporarily be established during the experiments (P\u00e4htz et al. 2020), usually by feeding sufficient sediment when the test section is too short for transport to reach equilibrium. This requirement was probably not satisfied in all of the above-cited measurements. The snow drift wind tunnel by Clifton et al. (2006), who did not feed snow at the tunnel entrance, was probably too short to establish equilibrium conditions for their beds of old and therefore cohesive snow, since cohesion can dramatically increase the fetch required to reach equilibrium (Comola et al. 2019a). For this reason, we have only compared with their data for freshly fallen snow. Unfortunately, many other studies have not employed the same criteria when choosing measurements to evaluate their cessation threshold models (Claudin & Andreotti 2006; Kok 2010b; Berzi et al. 2017; Andreotti et al. 2021; Gunn & Jerolmack 2022). This has largely been driven by the belief that there is only one dynamic threshold, implying that any kind of dynamic-threshold measurement is at least a proxy for the cessation threshold. However, we have presented evidence for the hypothesis that the continuous-transport threshold is a second kind of dynamic threshold with an underlying physics different from that of the cessation threshold (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a; P\u00e4htz et al. 2020, 2021). An important example for a potential misinterpretation of measured dynamic thresholds as cessation thresholds is the study by Andreotti et al. (2021) for the following reasons. (i) Andreotti et al. (2021), who carried out their measurements in a pressurised-wind tunnel, explicitly mentioned that they were only able to establish equilibrium transport for air pressures relatively close to ambient pressure (\ud835\udc43 & 30000 Pa) but not for the vast majority of studied pressure conditions (down to \ud835\udc43 \u2248 200 Pa): \u2018below 300 hPa [the erosional zone] encompasses the entire bed.\u2019 (ii) Andreotti et al. (2021) explicitly defined threshold conditions \u2018as the transition between saltation of groups of particles (bursts) to intermittent saltation of single particles (at high pressure) or no transport (at low pressure).\u2019 For high-pressure conditions, the so measured threshold is, by definition, larger than the cessation threshold (i.e., the threshold of intermittent saltation; Martin & Kok 2018). For low-pressure conditions, the measurements are difficult to interpret due to the lack of equilibrium transport. (iii) Andreotti et al. (2021) accompanied their direct threshold measurements with indirect measurements obtained from extrapolating to vanishing transport. However, since they\n20\nhave not established equilibrium (for most pressure conditions), this extrapolation does not necessarily yield the cessation threshold. (iv) P\u00e4htz et al. (2021) hypothesised that the continuous-transport threshold is the smallest wind shear stress at which an average grain ejected by an impacting grain can be accelerated into a steady trajectory. A modification of their trajectory-based model based on this hypothesis captured the measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021), suggesting that their employed experimental method yields a threshold akin to the continuous-transport threshold. The potential misinterpretation of the measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021) as cessation thresholdmeasurements is highly relevant, since it led Gunn& Jerolmack (2022) to introduce a Galileo number (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e)-dependent viscous damping of grain\u2013bed rebounds in their cessation thresholdmodel in an attempt to capture these data.However, this rebound damping is the very reason for the very strong disagreement between theirmodel and the here presented numerical data of the cessation threshold (section 3.3.1). Note that, from a physical perspective, rebound damping should not depend on \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e but on the Stokes number associated with the grain\u2019s impact velocity \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d |\ud835\udc97\u2193 |\ud835\udc51/\ud835\udf07 (Berzi et al. 2016, 2017; Andreotti et al. 2021), which is experimentally known to control the viscous damping of frontal grain collisions with a flat plate (Gondret et al. 2002). Since typical values of |\ud835\udc97\u2193 |/ \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51 for Martian saltation are at the very least comparable to, if not much larger than, those for terrestrial saltation (because of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc601/3 \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51, see section 3.2.3), and since \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc51 and \ud835\udf07 are of the same order of magnitude on Earth and Mars, typical values of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61 on Mars are many orders of magnitude too large for viscous damping to play a meaningful role. In addition, even if there was a strong damping of frontal grain\u2013plate collisions, this would not necessarily translate into a strong damping of grain\u2013bed collisions. In fact, we previously reported only slight differences between DEMRANS simulations of saltation for undamped (normal restitution coefficient \ud835\udc52 = 0.9) and nearly fully damped (\ud835\udc52 = 0.01) frontal grain\u2013grain collisions (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a). Even for \ud835\udc52 = 0.01, grains can saltate in large hops on the order of 100\ud835\udc51 high (Movie S3 of P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2018a).\n4.2. Recommendations for how to reliably measure the saltation cessation threshold for low-pressure atmospheric conditions\nAs described in the previous section, a reliable wind tunnel measurement of the cessation threshold for a given low-pressure atmospheric condition requires that equilibrium transport conditions can be established, at least temporarily. Since we are currently unable to predict with confidence the fetch distance saltation needs to reach equilibrium as a function of the atmospheric pressure, and since the required fetch could potentially be very large, it makes sense to design an experimental set-up that allows for adjustable sand feeding. However, this may be challenging given the closed-conduit nature of pressurised-wind tunnels. Once equilibrium transport is established in one way or another, we recommend to carry out measurements in the continuous-transport regime of the equilibrium transport rate \ud835\udc44 (or a proxy thereof) as a function of the shear velocity \ud835\udc62\u2217 and then extrapolate these measurements to vanishing transport using \ud835\udc44 = \ud835\udc501(\ud835\udc622\u2217 \u2212 \ud835\udc622\u2217\ud835\udc61 ) + \ud835\udc502(\ud835\udc622\u2217 \u2212 \ud835\udc622\u2217\ud835\udc61 )2 (consistent with (3.2)), where \ud835\udc501, \ud835\udc502 and \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 are treated as fit parameters. The resulting cessation threshold \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 should be substantially smaller than the dynamic-transport threshold. In fact, for the terrestrial wind tunnel measurements by Creyssels et al. (2009), this extrapolation method yields the value \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 ' 0.13 m/s (P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n 2020), which is nearly a factor of 2 smaller than the smallest wind shear velocity (\ud835\udc62\u2217 ' 0.24 m/s) for which Creyssels et al. (2009) reported continuous equilibrium transport.\n21"

For saltation transport, occurring in planetary aeolian environments, they are\n\ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 = 2.3(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)1/3max [ (\ud835\udc37\u2217/18)\u22121/2, (\ud835\udc37\u2217/18)1/2 ] , (5.1)\n\ud835\udc44 = 1.7\ud835\udc601/3\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d (\ud835\udc51/?\u0303?)1/2(\ud835\udc622\u2217 \u2212 \ud835\udc622\u2217\ud835\udc61 ) + 12\ud835\udc60\u22122/3\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d (?\u0303?3\ud835\udc51)\u22121/2(\ud835\udc622\u2217 \u2212 \ud835\udc622\u2217\ud835\udc61 )2, (5.2)\nwhere \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5d is the particle density, \ud835\udf08 the kinematic fluid viscosity, ?\u0303? \u2261 (1\u22121/\ud835\udc60)\ud835\udc54 the buoyancyreduced gravity, \ud835\udc51 the median grain diameter and \ud835\udc37\u2217 \u2261 \u221a \ud835\udc60?\u0303?\ud835\udc51/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)2/3 its normalised value. In highly rarefied atmospheres (\ud835\udc60 & 106), \ud835\udc37\u2217 is calculated by the more general (3.20), accounting for drag rarefaction effects. Put together, (5.1) and (5.2) constitute a simple means to make predictions of aeolian processes across a large range of planetary conditions. The derivation of (5.1) consists of a first-principle-based proof of the statement that \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61/(?\u0303?\ud835\udf08)1/3 is a function of only \ud835\udc37\u2217 (section 3.2.1). In contrast to existing cessation threshold models, this proof does not resort to coarse-graining the particle phase of the aeolian transport layer above the bed surface, but requires comparably much milder assumptions. Its arguably most critical underlying assumption is that scale-free boundary conditions describe the outcome of grain\u2013bed collisions. The validation of the above statement with our extensive simulation data set therefore indicates that the characteristic velocity scale \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51 of grains ejected by the splash of an impacting grain plays no important role for the physics behind the cessation threshold. Instead, grain\u2013bed rebounds and/or splash ejection events associatedwith the upper-tail end of the ejection velocity distribution are seemingly the physical processes that need to be considered. The left and right term of the right-hand side of (5.2) are consistent with the saltation limit and collisional limit, respectively, of the \ud835\udc44-scaling derived by P\u00e4htz & Dur\u00e1n (2020), with a threshold mean grain velocity scaling as \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc601/3 \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51. This scaling strongly deviates\nfrom the previous physical transport laws by Ungar & Haff (1987, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 \u221d \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51) and Dur\u00e1n et al. (2011, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 \u221d \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 ). For example, the law by Ungar & Haff (1987), which has been adjusted to Earth conditions, underestimates the sediment transport rate for the simulated Martian conditions by a factor of about 5. Only the recent model of P\u00e4htz et al. (2021) comes somewhat close to reproducing this scaling. It captures the \ud835\udc601/3-dependence of \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61 , but fails to capture its proportionality to \u221a\ufe01 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc51. This hints at a quite fundamental lack of understanding of the transport rate physics and calls for future studies on this issue. For Martian atmospheric conditions, the cessation threshold values predicted by the numerical simulations and (5.1) are much smaller than the recent dynamic-threshold measurements by Andreotti et al. (2021). This is particularly odd given that both the numerical simulations and (5.1) are in agreement with terrestrial experimental data. If the simulations were fundamentally wrong, one would expect them to fail for all conditions, not just for Martian conditions. In section 4, we have therefore presented arguments for why the experimental methods used by Andreotti et al. (2021) may have yielded a threshold different from \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 . This issue needs to be resolved in future studies, since knowing the \u2018true\u2019 value of \ud835\udc62\u2217\ud835\udc61 is crucial for understanding the time evolution of Martian landscapes.
