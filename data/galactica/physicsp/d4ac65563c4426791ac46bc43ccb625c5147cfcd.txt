conclusions In this study, we developed a framework based on NG to establish an upper bound on the dynamics of a specific subset of CRNs. The physical meaning of this bound relates to the concept of entropy production, which in turn is related to the speed of convergence of the chemical reaction. The nonlinearity commonly present in CRNs presents a challenge, which is addressed here. The optimization problem in the NG derivation was found to be related to entropy production, enriching the understanding of NG within a thermodynamic context. While the primary focus has been on CRNs, the methods and discussions are applicable to a wider range of hypergraph dynamics. acknowledgments H.M. was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 23H04489.

(2.34), with Eq. (2.36) is equivalent to the KL divergence, Eq. (2.37). Let us define the following potential for α ∈ R:
ϕ (α) KL(x) := NX∑ i=1 xi(lnxi − α) (A.1)
The Bregman divergence, Eq. (2.34), with Eq. (A.1) is computed as follows:
D ϕ (α) KL (x∥y) = ϕ(α)KL(x)− ϕ (α) KL(y)− ⟨(x− y),∇ϕ (α) KL(y)⟩
(A.2)
= NX∑ i=1 xi(lnxi − α)− NX∑ i=1 yi(ln yi − α)
− NX∑ i=1 (xi − yi)(ln yi − α+ 1) (A.3)
= NX∑ i=1 xi lnxi − NX∑ i=1 yi ln yi
− NX∑ i=1 (xi − yi) ln yi − NX∑ i=1 (xi − yi) (A.4)
= NX∑ i=1 xi ln xi yi − NX∑ i=1 (xi − yi) (A.5) = DKL(x∥y) (A.6)
Thus, the Bregman divergence, Eq. (2.34), with Eq. (A.1) is equivalent to the KL divergence, Eq. (2.37), independently from α. Furthermore, Eq. (2.36) is the special case of Eq. (A.1) with α = 0. appendix b: upper bound system with the l2 constraint In Sec. V, we have considered ϕKL(·), Eq. (2.36), as the potential of the Bregman divergence in the constraint term since the KL divergence is minimized in CRNs. However, we are not limited to this choice, and it is expected that a different potential in the constraint may give us a different bound. Another simple candidate for the potential of the Bregman divergence in the constraint is the L2 norm given by
ϕL2(x) := NX∑ i=1 |xi|2. (B.1)
In this case, DKL(xt + ∥ẋt∥Fet∆t∥xt) does not depend on et and the Hessian GϕL2 (xt) becomes the identity matrix: GϕL2 (xt) = 1. [1] U. Seifert, Stochastic thermodynamics, fluctuation theorems and molecular machines,
