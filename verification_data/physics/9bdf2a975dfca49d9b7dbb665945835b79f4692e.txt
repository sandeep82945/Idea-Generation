"The results presented in this study highlight the specificities of the plant ERV1–MIA40 pathway towards GSH and two IMS proteins, COX19 and CCMH. It is first interesting to note that the Arabidopsis ERV1–MIA40 couple is not able to oxidize CCMH well. This may explain why no reducing system has been identified in plants so far, unlike in bacteria such as E. coli, where reduction of the periplasmic ortholog is assisted by CcmG using electrons coming from the cytoplasm and transferred via the membrane CcdA protein [59]. One of the differences between these systems is the presence of high GSH concentrations in the IMS and, eventually, of glutaredoxins, although this remains to be established for plants. The second important conclusion is the observation that the in vitro requirement of MIA40 for COX19 oxidation is abolished when ERV1 and physiological concentrations of glutathione provided at a relevant redox potential are present. The capacity of AtERV1 to bypass the AtMIA40 function in vitro may actually explain why AtERV1 was able to complement a yeast mia40 mutant, restoring the amount of MIA40 substrates [40], and why the role of AtMIA40 is dispensable in A. thaliana, but not in opisthokonts."
