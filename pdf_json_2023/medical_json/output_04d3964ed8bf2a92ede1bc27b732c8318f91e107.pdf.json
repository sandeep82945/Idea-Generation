    "abstractText": "Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition that requires early recognition and timely management to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Administering antibiotics in the prehospital setting can be effective to reduce the time to antibiotic therapy, which may be crucial for sepsis patients. However, the impact of prehospital antibiotics on mortality in sepsis patients remains uncertain, and the current evidence to support this practice in middle-income countries is particularly limited. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective-prospective cohort study aimed at determining the impact of prehospital antibiotics on in-hospital mortality rates among adult patients with sepsis. The study included patients who received care from the advanced level of Emergency Medical Service between June 2020 and October 2022 and compared the mortality rates of patients who received prehospital antibiotics with those of their counterparts who did not. Results: In this study, 180 patients with a mean age of 71.6 \u00b1 15.7 years were included, of whom 68.9% experienced respiratory infections. The results demonstrated that the prehospital antibiotic group had a significantly lower in-hospital mortality rate (32.2%) than the non-prehospital antibiotic group (47.8%; p=0.034). After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio was 0.304 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.82; p=0.018), indicating a 69.6% lower incidence of in-hospital mortality in the prehospital antibiotic group. Furthermore, the prehospital antibiotic group received antibiotics significantly earlier (16.0 \u00b1 7.4 minutes) than the non-prehospital group (50.9 \u00b1 29.4 minutes; p<0.001). Conclusion: This study provides evidence to support the administration of antibiotics to sepsis patients in the prehospital setting, as this practice can reduce mortality rates. However, larger, multicenter studies are required to confirm these findings and to further investigate the potential benefits of prehospital antibiotics in improving patient outcomes.",

In 2017, there were 48.9 million cases and 11 million deaths globally from infections, accounting for 20% of all global deaths.2 In Thailand, sepsis is a major public health problem, and it is the leading cause of inhospital deaths, with approximately 175,000 cases and 45,000 deaths reported in 2021, accounting for 32% of all mortality. Even in Bangkok, a city with a diverse population and access to advanced healthcare facilities, sepsis mortality rates have been found to rise to as high as 54%.3 The development of more effective treatments for sepsis continues to pose a challenge in terms of improving patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of mortality.\nThe recent update of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2021 (SSC2021) recommended early antibiotic therapy, ideally within 1 to 3 hours of diagnosis of sepsis and within the first hour in cases of septic shock.4 According to evidence-based medicine, emergency medical services play a crucial role in the delivery of sepsis care bundles5\u201310 and reducing the time to antibiotic therapy;7,11,12 however,\nOpen Access Emergency Medicine 2023:15 199\u2013206 199 \u00a9 2023 Kotnarin et al.

            "text": "Study Design and Population This was a single-center, retrospective-prospective cohort study focused on sepsis patients treated by Narenthorn EMS center, which performs an average of approximately 1300 EMS operations annually. The research was conducted between June 2020 and October 2022, with the Narenthorn prehospital sepsis protocol being implemented on Dec 13, 2021.18 The prehospital sepsis protocol provides a screening checklist that uses the SIRS, NEWS, and MEWS criteria,4 which were the sepsis screening tools recommended by the SSC2021 guidelines, as well as an initial patient assessment checklist. On-scene treatment involved administering intravenous fluid and antibiotics (specifically ceftriaxone for community-acquired infections and ceftazidime for hospital-acquired infections), as well as screening for drug allergies. A blood draw was obtained for septic workup, including hemocultures and lactic acid analyses, which were then sent to the Rajavithi Hospital laboratory. Pre-arrival notification for sepsis alert was also included in the protocol. The study population consisted of all sepsis patients transported to the Emergency Department of Rajavithi Hospital, a tertiary care facility in Bangkok, Thailand, during the study period. In the retrospective group, sepsis patients were diagnosed individually by the on-scene EMS physician, while in the prospective group, the screening checklist based on the SIRS, NEWS, and MEWS criteria was used to assist in sepsis screening, and diagnosis was made based on individual judgement. The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older, while exclusion criteria were sepsis patients who required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were pregnant, had been involved in an accident, required emergency surgery, or had documented antibiotic allergies, which were determined based on on-site interviews with patients and their relatives.\nData Collection and Sample Size The sample size for this study was calculated using the ratio comparison formula.19 The estimated proportion of interest (P) was derived from data obtained in a previously published study.14 To achieve adequate statistical power, at least 76 participants were required for each of the two groups being compared. Data were collected using both Electronic EMS Medical records and emergency medical records. The variables of interest included patients\u2019 demographic characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), suspected origin of sepsis, prehospital vital signs (mean blood pressure, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, temperature, and Glasgow coma scale), severity scores (NEWS, MEWS), duration of prehospital care, prehospital treatments administered (antibiotic therapy type and dose, initial intravenous fluid type, time to antibiotic therapy), and laboratory parameters such as serum lactate and WBC. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality, while secondary outcomes included ICU admission, hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU LOS.\nEthical Considerations This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and it was approved by the Rajavithi Hospital Ethics Committee for Human Research (approval number 64269). For the prehospital antibiotic group, informed consent was obtained from patients or their direct relatives. For the\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/OAEM.S413791 DovePress Open Access Emergency Medicine 2023:15 200\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nnon-prehospital antibiotic group, the requirement for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee. Participants were allowed to drop out of the study at any time by informing the on-scene EMS physician, and withdrawal from the study did not affect their right to receive the usual treatment. To protect the privacy of the participants, their names were replaced with hospital numbers, and all data used in the study was de-identified.\nStatistic and Data Analysis Patient demographic data were presented as percentage for baseline data and mean for normally distributed qualitative data. Standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and interquartile ranges were also reported. Categorical data were compared using Chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests, while continuous data from two uncorrelated populations were compared using the Student\u2019s t-test for normally distributed data and the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed data.\nThe primary outcome of this study was evaluation of the proportion of in-hospital mortality, with secondary outcomes consisting of ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU LOS. The data were analyzed using logistic regression for the primary outcome, and median regression analysis was employed for hospital LOS and ICU LOS. Inferential results were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Overall, these statistical analyses provided a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between the variables and the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality."

The results of multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the prehospital antibiotic group had a significant reduction in mortality after adjusting for multiple variables that are potential confounding factors (including Age, Gender, Comorbidities, Operation Interval, Systolic Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate, Respiratory Rate, SpO2, Body Temperature, Glasgow Coma Score, POCT Glucose, White Blood Cell Count, Serum Lactate, and Positive Hemoculture in the model. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.304 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.82; p=0.018), meaning that the prehospital antibiotic group had 69.6% lower in-hospital mortality compared to the non-prehospital antibiotic group, after allowing for other potential confounding factors.\nThe prehospital antibiotic group had a median hospital length of stay of 9.5 days (IQR: 5.0\u201316.0) compared with the non-prehospital antibiotic group\u2019s 8.0 days (IQR: 3.0\u201322.0). The absolute difference between the two groups, estimated by median regression analysis, was not statistically significant (95% CI: \u221223.84, 7.84 p-value =0.357).\nIn terms of ICU admission, the prehospital antibiotic group had a rate of 7.80% compared with their non-prehospital antibiotic counterparts\u2019 6.70%, and there was no statistically significant difference between these rates in the two groups, with an odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.38, 3.66 p-value = 0.774). The ICU lengths of stay for the prehospital antibiotic and non-prehospital antibiotic groups were 7.0 days (IQR: 6.0\u201314.0) and 13.50 days (IQR: 6.0\u201314.0) respectively, and the absolute difference between the two groups, estimated by median regression analysis, was not statistically significant (95% CI: \u221223.84, 7.84 p-value =0.290).

            "text": "The present study provides evidence to support the use of prehospital antibiotics by EMS providers for patients with suspected sepsis. This retro-prospective observational study showed that prehospital antibiotic therapy was associated with significantly lower mortality rates than those of patients who did not receive antibiotics. This is consistent with most prior research,14 despite the fact that a recent randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of early prehospital antibiotic therapy administration in patients with suspected infection showed negative results in terms of reducing\nNote: Data are presented as n (%) unless indicated otherwise.

To further investigate these results and rule out the potential impact of COVID-19 infection, future studies should consider controlling the underlying conditions and external factors affecting sepsis outcomes.\nThe study\u2019s findings regarding ICU admission probability showed that the rate of admission and the number of hospital days in the two groups were not significantly different because of a high bed occupancy rate in the intensive care unit, which may have limited the admission to ICU of patients with suspected sepsis. The fact that the hospital\u2019s limited ICU capacity may have prevented the admission of eligible patients highlights the need to consider healthcare system capacity and resources when assessing the impact of interventions on patient outcomes. Transferring patients who are no longer in a critical phase to secondary hospitals because of limitations in ICU capacity could have affected ICU length of stay.\nThe implementation of a prehospital sepsis protocol, initiated in December 2021, was associated with a reduction in hospital mortality among EMS sepsis patients compared to that of a retrospective group of non-prehospital antibiotictreated patients. The prehospital sepsis protocol consisted of several key components, including a screening checklist that utilizes the SIRS, NEWS, and MEWS criteria,4 which are the sepsis screening tools recommended by the SSC2021 guidelines, an initial patient assessment checklist, on-scene treatment with intravenous fluid and antibiotics, a blood draw for septic workup and pre-arrival notification of sepsis alert to the Emergency department. These findings suggest that the prehospital sepsis bundle of care may be an effective strategy for reducing delays in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis in emergency departments, particularly in settings with high levels of crowding. Our study highlights the importance of initiating the sepsis bundle of care in the prehospital setting.\nHowever, it is essential to consider the limitations of single-center studies, which are conducted in one particular hospital and EMS center, meaning that the results may not be generalizable to other healthcare settings. Furthermore, these studies are more prone to bias and may be influenced by confounding factors that could affect the results. Therefore, the study\u2019s findings should be confirmed by larger, multi-center studies to determine their generalizability to diverse healthcare settings. Overall, the study provides important insights into the use of prehospital antibiotics for suspected sepsis and highlights the need for further research in this area.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/OAEM.S413791 DovePress Open Access Emergency Medicine 2023:15 204\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, it was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other healthcare settings. In order to test the external validity of the results, further research using multi-center studies is needed regarding the impact of prehospital antibiotics on patients with suspected sepsis in emergency medical systems.\nSecondly, the retrospective data collection was performed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this may have affected the in-hospital mortality rate. Although the data collection for the prospective study period was conducted when more treatments and vaccinations for COVID-19 were available, this may not have fully combated the impact of COVID-19 on the study results. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the effects of prehospital antibiotics on patients with suspected sepsis.\nFinally, the study was conducted in a hospital with high bed occupancy rates in the intensive care unit during a period of high levels of emergency unit crowding, and this may have limited the admission of patients with suspected sepsis to the ICU, potentially affecting the outcomes of the study, as some patients were treated in a general ward instead of receiving intensive care. To address this limitation, future studies should consider conducting research at hospitals with lower bed occupancy rates to ensure that all patients receive the appropriate level of care."

            "text": "Our study indicates that administering antibiotics in prehospital settings can potentially reduce in-hospital mortality and shorten the duration of antibiotic treatments for patients with suspected sepsis. These findings highlight the potential benefits of implementing prehospital antibiotic protocols in resource-limited settings, particularly in middle-income countries. However, given the limitations of our small sample size, further research with larger, multicenter samples is necessary to provide more evidence on the effectiveness of prehospital antibiotic protocols for sepsis treatment in prehospital settings. Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing such protocols to enhance sepsis care in these settings."
