    "abstractText": "A light mediator particle is often predicted in the dark sector scenario, which weakly interacts with the standard model (SM) particles. The weakness of the interaction is usually described by a small coupling; however, the small coupling does not always guarantee the weakness of the interaction. When the mass of the mediator particle lies in a threshold region, the so-called threshold singularity may emerge, and then the perturbative calculation fails. This singularity causes several effects, e.g., the mixing between the mediator particle and bound states, the Sommerfeld effect on the final state of the mediator particle decay, etc. Taking the minimal model of the vector mediator particle decaying mainly into the SM particles as an example, we develop a method to describe the singularity quantitatively. We also calculate some physical quantities using this method, such as the lifetime of the mediator particle and find that those could be significantly altered compared with the result of the perturbative calculation.",

            "text": "With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the LHC experiment [1, 2], the standard model (SM) of particle physics had completed not only from a theoretical but also from an experimental perspective. It has brilliantly explained the high-precision experimental results which have been carried out since then and has established a strong position as the most reliable theory we are at hand describing our world. However, while the SM describes many phenomena around us, it is far from the theory of everything. Many things that cannot be explained within this framework are known. One such problem, for example, is related to the free parameters of the SM [3\u20136]: dark energy, electroweak scale, gauge couplings, strong CP, etc. There are 20 parameters in the SM, and they cannot be determined from the theory itself and must be measured from various experiments. No one knows how to predict their values from the first principle. Another is about the initial\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nconditions of the universe [7, 8]: flatness and isotropic of the universe, baryon asymmetry of the universe, etc. How was the initial condition for the equations giving the evolution of the universe determined? The other is concerned with the experimental anomalies [9\u201311]: neutrino masses and mixings, dark matter, muon g\u22122, etc. The SM does not explain these experimental results, and some extension of the SM is required. Building a model beyond the SM is necessary to solve the above puzzles, and it is one of the most important aspects of modern particle physics. Attempts to find physics beyond the SM have already been started before the construction of the LHC. In that era, the mainstream idea was that the origin of solving the problems lies in a high-energy region that we have not yet reached. The best example is supersymmetry [12]. Supersymmetry predicts a new particle called superpartner for each SM particle, and its mass, from consistency with various experimental results, was expected to be around O(1)TeV. Therefore, it was thought that if supersymmetry exists, it would be sufficiently testable in the LHC experiment. However, the experimental data so far is not favorable for the existence of such a new particle [13, 14]. Under this circumstance, the so-called hidden sector scenario is attracting attention [15\u201335] (for an overview see [36]). In this scenario, we assume that, in addition to the SM sector, an unknown sector exists that contains the mechanism solving (some of) the above problems not in a high-energy region but, like the SM, around the electroweak scale or below. The two sectors must weakly contact each other to avoid severer constraints obtained by various collider experiments. Such a weak contact is guaranteed, e.g., by separating the two sectors by a large energy barrier; the two sectors are only connected through higher dimensional operators originating in some very heavy particles or rare tunneling effects induced by the instanton effect. Such a scenario is called the hidden valley scenario [37]. However, to go from the valley we live in, the SM sector, to the other valley, the hidden sector, we must climb this very high-energy mountain. Hence, accessing the other sector without high-energy experiments is usually challenging. In contrast, as a more phenomenological and bottom-up approach, the dark sector scenario with a light mediator is recently attracting more attention [38\u201343]. In this scenario, the SM and dark sectors are connected by a light particle called the mediator. The mediator particle is usually assumed to be weakly interacting with the SM particles. Such a dark sector scenario is motivated by various reasons. For instance, if we consider a thermal dark matter scenario assuming that the dark matter is a fermion in the dark sector, a light mediator particle is naturally introduced to make the theory renormalizable and to explain the dark matter density observed today via the freeze-out mechanism [16, 44\u201346]. Another example is that the light mediator particle itself plays the role of dark matter [47\u201350]. Moreover, a light mediator particle is sometimes required to explain experimental anomalies such as the muon g\u2212 2 [51\u201353]. In any case, unlike the hidden valley scenario, these light mediator particles are not difficult to produce in high-luminosity collider experiments and to be produced in the early universe. Hence, these particles are now important targets in ongoing and near-future collider experiments [54\u201357], and cosmological observations [58\u201361]. The lightness of the mass and, in particular, the weakness of the interaction of the mediator particle gives a unique implication for collider physics and cosmology: a weakly interacting particle could be long-lived, giving a distinct signature at collider experi-\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nments [62, 63, 63]. On the other hand, such a particle could be a light relic in the early universe, affecting the cosmological evolution of the universe via its late-time decay or as a light new degree of freedom changing the universe\u2019s expansion rate [64\u201366]. The weakness of the interaction is usually described by a small coupling. However, the small coupling does not always guarantee the weakness of the interaction. When the mass of the mediator particle lies in the threshold region, the so-called threshold singularity emerges [67\u201370]. Then, the perturbative calculation, which was implicitly assumed in the above implication, fails. This singularity causes several effects, e.g., the mixing between the mediator particle and various bound states, the Sommerfeld effect on the final state of the mediator decay, etc., and could drastically change the implication. In this paper, taking the minimal vector mediator model as an example, assuming it mainly decays into SM particles, we propose a method to describe the singularity quantitatively. Moreover, we evaluate how much influence it has on physical quantities, such as the total decay width of the mediator particle, and find that the prediction could be altered significantly compared with that of the perturbative calculation. Though there is only a narrow mass region for a vector mediator particle in which a threshold singularity emerges, it has several motivations. First, such a narrow mass region is attractive from the viewpoint of a light WIMP scenario. A light WIMP with a resonantly enhanced self-scattering process described by an s-channel mediator exchange, with annihilation also enhanced by the same resonance, may solve the so-called core-cusp problem [71, 72]. On the other hand, a light WIMP is known to be severely constraint by CMB observables; its annihilation cross-section at the recombination era, vDM 10\u22123 with vDM being the relative velocity between incident dark matter particles, must be significantly suppressed [73\u201375]. One of the ways to have such suppression is to use a forbidden annihilation [76\u201378] where the final state of the annihilation is not kinematically accessible at exactly vDM = 0. The combination of the s-channel resonance and the forbidden annihilation leads us to the threshold decay of the mediator particle. The other motivation comes for the sake of completeness in searching for the mediator particle. The mediator particle is now one of the important targets at collider experiments and astrophysical/cosmological observations, and many projects relevant to the search are ongoing and being planned. The threshold regions are currently left from these searches [79\u201381]. However, the regions would be a target in the future to complete the search for the mediator particle. The method developed in this paper will be helpful in analyzing the threshold regions. This paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the minimal model of the vector mediator particle in section 2, and calculate the decay width of the mediator particle perturbatively. Next, in section 3, taking the decay channels into a pair of muons and a pair of bottom quarks as examples, we consider the decay of the mediator particle at their threshold regions and, using the so-called potential non-relativistic method [82\u201385], describe threshold singularities emerged. Here, we see that the Sommerfeld effect on the final state of the decay is systematically incorporated utilizing the method while also seeing the \u201csign\u201d of the mixing between the mediator particle and bound states composed of final state particles. So, in the following section (section 4), we further develop the method to describe the effect of the mixing quantitatively. Then, we calculate a few physical quantities, e.g., the total decay width of the mediator particle. Finally, in section 5, we summarize our discussion.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5"

            "text": "We briefly summarize the decay channels and corresponding partial decay widths of the mediator particle A\u2032 within a perturbative calculation. As seen in the Lagrangian (2.1), the vector mediator particle interacts with the SM particles through the mixing with the hyper-charge gauge boson, so it decays mainly into a pair of the SM particles via the electromagnetic and the weak neutral currents. In particular, when the mediator is lighter enough than the electroweak scale, i.e., the Z boson mass, it dominantly decays via the electromagnetic current, for the decay via the neutral current is suppressed by a factor m2A\u2032/m 2 Z , as seen in eq. (2.4). When the mass of the mediator particle is less than twice the electron mass 2me, the mediator particle decays mainly into three photons via loop diagrams that an electron is propagating. The corresponding partial decay width is \u0393(A\u2032 \u2192 3\u03b3) ' 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 2\u03b14m9A\u2032/m8e [86], with \u03b1 being the fine structure constant. The mediator particle can also decay into a pair of neutrinos via the neutral weak current interaction, though its partial decay width is suppressed by a factor of m4A\u2032/m4Z . 10\u221220.2 On the other hand, when the mediator particle is heavier than twice the electron mass, it can decay into a pair of electrons, namely, an electron and a positron. The partial decay width of the mediator particle into a pair of the SM leptons, i.e., electron, muon, or tau lepton pairs, is generally\n2This decay channel dominates when the vector mediator model is constructed based on, e.g., U(1)B\u2212L.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nobtained as follows:\n\u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ) '\n2\u03b1mA\u2032\n3\n( 1 + 2\nm2`i m2A\u2032 )\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1\u2212 4m2`i m2A\u2032 . (2.5)\nWhen the mediator particle is heavier than twice the pion mass 2m\u03c0, it can also decay hadronically. A convenient way to evaluate the total hadronic decay width of the mediator particle is the use of the so-called R-ratio obtained by the result of collider experiments [87], i.e., R = \u03c3(e\u2212e+ \u2192 all hadrons;mA\u2032)/\u03c3(e\u2212e+ \u2192 \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+;mA\u2032) with \u03c3(e\u2212e+ \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;mA\u2032) being the annihilation cross-section between an electron and a positron with the center of mass energy of mA\u2032 . Then, the hadronic decay width is given by the following formula [43]:\n\u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 all hadrons) ' 2 \u03b1mA\u2032\n3\n( 1 + 2\nm2\u00b5 m2A\u2032\n)\u221a 1\u2212\n4m2\u00b5 m2A\u2032 R, (2.6)\nassuming that mA\u2032 is enough smaller than the electroweak scale. This formula works well to estimate the decay width for all hadrons except at threshold regions, which we mainly discuss in this paper. On the other hand, calculating the partial decay width for each hadronic state is not easy. We use a different method in a different mass region: when mA\u2032 \u2264 500MeV, the width is computed using the chiral Lagrangian [88]. WhenmA\u2032 \u2265 a few GeV, it is described and evaluated as the width into a pair of SM quarks or gluons, based on the perturbative QCD [89]. For instance, the partial decay width of the mediator particle into a pair of SM quarks is obtained as \u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 qiq\u0304i) ' 3Q(q)i \u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 ` \u2212 i ` + i )|m`i\u2192mqi with mqi being the quarks-mass. When the mediator particle mass is intermediate, i.e., 500MeV \u2264 mA\u2032 \u2264 a few GeV, the partial decay width is evaluated utilizing the measurement of the exclusive e\u2212e+ annihilation cross-section into a corresponding hadronic final state [89]. However, extracting data from the measurement often gives a sizeable systematic uncertainty [90, 91]."

Integrating out all the fields except those of the mediator particle A\u2032(x) and the non-relativistic part of the muon (\u03c8\u00b5)NR(x)3 from the Lagrangian (2.4), and expanding (\u03c8\u00b5)NR(x) in terms of its velocity as\n(\u03c8\u00b5)NR(x) = ( e\u2212im\u00b5x 0 \u03b7\u00b5(x) + ieim\u00b5x\n0 [~\u2207 \u00b7 ~\u03c3 \u03be\u00b5(x)]/(2m\u00b5) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 eim\u00b5x 0 \u03be\u00b5(x)\u2212 ie\u2212im\u00b5x 0 [~\u2207 \u00b7 ~\u03c3 \u03b7\u00b5(x)]/(2m\u00b5) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n) , (3.1)\nwith \u03c3 being the Pauli matrix, gives us the non-relativistic Lagrangian as follows:\nL(NR)V ' 1 2A \u2032 \u00b5\n[ ( +m2A\u2032) g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd ] A\u2032\u03bd + \u03b7\u2020\u00b5 ( i\u2202x0 + \u22072\n2m\u00b5 + i\u0393\u00b52\n) \u03b7\u00b5\n+ \u03be\u2020\u00b5 ( i\u2202x0 \u2212 \u22072\n2m\u00b5 \u2212 i\u0393\u00b52\n) \u03be\u00b5\n+ 12\n\u222b d4y\n\u03b1\u03b4(x0 \u2212 y0) |~x\u2212 ~y| [ \u03b7\u2020\u00b5(x)~\u03c3 \u03be\u00b5(y) ] \u00b7 [ \u03be\u2020\u00b5(y)~\u03c3 \u03b7\u00b5(x) ] + i \u03c0\u03b1 2\n3m2\u00b5\n[ \u03b7\u2020\u00b5 ~\u03c3 \u03be\u00b5 ] \u00b7 [ \u03be\u2020\u00b5 ~\u03c3 \u03b7\u00b5 ] + e ~A\u2032 \u00b7 [e2im\u00b5x0\u03b7\u2020\u00b5 ~\u03c3 \u03be\u00b5 + e\u22122im\u00b5x 0 \u03be\u2020\u00b5~\u03c3\u03b7\u00b5]. (3.2)\n\u03b7\u00b5 (\u03b7\u2020\u00b5) is the operator annihilating (creating) a non-relativistic muon \u00b5\u2212, while \u03be\u00b5 (\u03be\u2020\u00b5) creates (annihilates) its anti-particle \u00b5+. In the above Lagrangian, we drop several terms describing other states not directly coupled to the mediator field, such as \u03b7\u2020\u00b5(x)\u03be\u00b5(y). Moreover, \u0393\u00b5 is the decay width of the muon, which is obtained by integrating out the W boson and lighter SM fermions from the original Lagrangian in LV . It contributes to the decay width of the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ two-body state. On the other hand, the other imaginary term (the first term in the third line) in the above Lagrangian describes the annihilation between the muons \u00b5\u2212 and \u00b5+, and it also contributes to the decay width of the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ two-body state. After introducing the two-body fields describing the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ two-body system that directly couples to the vector mediator field A\u2032, and integrating the component fields \u03b7\u00b5 and \u03be\u00b5 in the above Lagrangian (3.2), we have the potential NR Lagrangian for the two-body system:\nL(pNR)V ' \u2212 1 2 ~A\u2032 ( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032 +\n\u222b d3r ~\u03a6\u2020(~r, x) ( i\u2202x0 +\n\u22072x 4m\u00b5 + \u2207 2 r m\u00b5 \u2212 V (~r)\n) ~\u03a6(~r, x)\n+ \u221a 2 e ~A\u2032 [ e2im\u00b5x 0~\u03a6\u2020(~0, x) + e\u22122im\u00b5x0~\u03a6(~0, x) ] , (3.3)\nwhere ~A\u2032 is the spatial components of the vector mediator field, while ~\u03a6(~r, x) and ~\u03a6\u2020(~r, x) are the fields (operators) annihilating and creating the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ two-body system with the total spin of one (the spin-triplet state), respectively. Here, ~r and x are the relative and centerof-mass coordinates of the two-body system. The potential V (~r) is given by the equation,\nV (~r) = \u2212\u03b1 r \u2212 i\u0393\u00b5 \u2212 i\n2\u03c0\u03b12 3m2\u00b5 \u03b4(~r), (3.4)\n3The non-relativistic part of the muon field is defined as (\u03c8\u00b5)NR(x) \u2261 \u222b\n[NR] d 4p/(2\u03c04) \u03c8\u0303\u00b5(p) e\u2212ipx, where\n\u03c8\u0303\u00b5(p) is the Fourier coefficient of (\u03c8\u00b5)(x), while [NR] is the domain of the integration that corresponds to the almost on-shell and non-relativistic muon, i.e., p0 = \u00b1m\u00b5 + \u03b4p0 with |p| m\u00b5, \u03b4p0 \u223c |p|2/m\u00b5 |p|.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nwhere the real part of the potential represents the Coulomb force acting between \u00b5\u2212 and \u00b5+, while the imaginary (absorption) part describes the so-called \u201cdecay width\u201d of the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ two-body system, which originates in the decay of the muons and the annihilation between them into a pair of electrons (an electron and a positron), as mentioned above. Note that the pNR Lagrangian method can be applied only at the threshold region. In other regions away from the threshold, the use of the method is not validated. On the other hand, non-perturbative effects, such as threshold singularities, are also suppressed in the regions, and hence the usual perturbative calculation can be used to compute the width. We give the derivation of the above pNR Lagrangian in appendix A in some detail and quantitatively discuss the range in which the use of the pNR Lagrangian method is valid. Now we calculate the decay width of the mediator particle at the threshold region of a muon pair. To make the calculation intuitive, we utilize the expansion of the two-body field \u03a6(~r, x) in terms of the solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, i.e., the equation of motion of the two-body field, that describes the relative motion between the muons. Treating the imaginary part of the potential perturbatively, we can expand the field as follows:\n~\u03a6(~r, x) = \u2211 n, `,m ~Bn`m(x)\u03c8 (B) n`m(~r) + \u222b dk 2\u03c0 \u2211 `,m ~Ck`m(x)\u03c8 (C) k`m(~r), (3.5)\nwhere \u03c8(B)n`m(~r) is the solution describing a bound state with n, `, andm being the principal, azimuthal, and magnetic quantum numbers, respectively, and the coefficient ~Bn`m(x) is the field (operator) annihilating the corresponding bound state. On the other hand, \u03c8(C)k`m(~r) is the solution describing a continuum state with the wave number k = (m\u00b5E)1/2, and the quantum numbers `,m, while the coefficient ~Ck`m(x) is the field annihilating the continuum state. The solutions \u03c8(B)n`m(~r) and \u03c8 (C) k`m(~r) are analytically obtained as\n\u03c8 (B) n`m(~r) = 2 n2\n\u221a (n\u2212`\u22121)!\n(n+`)!\n( \u03b1m\u00b5\n2 )3 \u00d7exp ( \u2212\u03b1m\u00b5r2n )( \u03b1m\u00b5r n )` L2`+1n\u2212`\u22121 ( \u03b1m\u00b5r n ) Y`m(\u03b8,\u03d5), (3.6)\n\u03c8 (C) k`m(~r) = \u0393(1+`+ i\u03b1m\u00b5/(2k)) (2`+1)!r exp\n( \u03c0\u03b1m\u00b5\n4k\n) M(i\u03b1m\u00b5/k,`+1/2,\u22122ikr)Y`m(\u03b8,\u03d5), (3.7)\nthanks to the Coulomb potential [92]. Here, Lmn (x), Y`m(\u03b8, \u03d5), and M(a, b, c) are the associated Laguerre polynomial, spherical harmonic, and Whittaker (of the first kind) functions, respectively, with \u0393(x) being the Gamma function.\nSubstituting those for eq.

(3.3). Moreover, we also dropped the imaginary parts of the kinetic terms, i.e., the decay widths, for the fields describing the continuum states, for as do not play an essential role in the following discussion.4\nWith the above Lagrangian (3.8), the \u201cdecay width\u201d of the vector mediator particle into a pair of muons is obtained using the self-energy of the mediator particle \u03a3 (q) as follows:\n\u0393 (A\u2032 \u2192 \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+) = \u2212 1 mA\u2032 Im [\u03a3 (mA\u2032)] , (3.9)\nwhere \u03a3 (q) is defined as \u222b d4x eiqx \u30080|T [Ai(x)Aj(0)]|0\u3009 \u2261 i\u03b4ij/[q2 \u2212m2A\u2032 \u2212\u03a3 (q)]. Both the bound and the continuum states contribute to \u03a3 (q), and the decay width is obtained as\n\u0393(A\u2032\u2192\u00b5\u2212\u00b5+)= \u2211 n 2\u03c0\u03b14m3\u00b5 n3mA\u2032 f(mA\u2032 ;M (\u00b5\u00b5)n ,\u0393(\u00b5\u00b5)n /2)+ 2\u03c0 2\u03b12m2\u00b5\u03b8(mA\u2032\u22122m\u00b5) mA\u2032 [ 1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03c0\u03b1/ \u221a mA\u2032/m\u00b5\u22122)\n] , (3.10)\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side is the contribution from the bound states, and the function f(x;x0, \u03b3) \u2261 (1/\u03c0)\u03b3/[(x \u2212 x0)2 + \u03b32] is the Breit-Wigner function with M (\u00b5\u00b5) n \u2261 2m\u00b5 \u2212 \u03b12m\u00b5/(4n2) and \u0393(\u00b5\u00b5)n \u2261 2\u0393\u00b5 + \u03b15m\u00b5/(6n3) being the mass and the width of the n-th excited bound state composed of \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ pair. On the other hand, the second term is the contribution from the continuum states of the pair. When the effect of the long-range force is weakened, i.e., \u03c0\u03b1/ \u221a mA\u2032/m\u00b5 \u2212 2 \u2192 0, the second term gives ( 2\u03b1mA\u2032/ \u221a 2) \u221a\n1\u2212 2m\u00b5/mA\u2032 , and it coincides with the partial decay width shown in eq. (2.5) with taking mA\u2032 \u2192 2m\u00b5. The \u201cdecay width\u201d in eq. (3.10) is shown by a solid green line in figure 1 as a function of x \u2261 mA\u2032/m\u00b5 \u2212 2.5 The width obtained by the perturbative calculation in eq. (2.5) is also shown by a dotted brown line for comparison purposes. As seen in the right panel of the figure, the effect of the long-range force becomes sizable when x \u2264 10\u22122. It is indeedO(10 %) level at x \u223c 10\u22122 and is more than O(100 %) level when x & 10\u22124. On the other hand, as seen in the left panel of the figure, several Breit-Wigner resonances can be found in the region of x \u2264 0. Since their widths are very narrow, their peak values become enormous. However, it does not mean that the decay width becomes very large when the mass of the mediator particle is in the vicinity of the resonances. It instead indicates a sign of the mixing between the vector mediator particle and (one of) the bound states composed of \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+. In the next section (section 4), we will discuss how the mixing is quantitatively taken into account.\n4On the other hand, the imaginary parts for the fields describing the bound states play a role, as seen in the following discussion. For the fields with a larger principal number n, there is an additional contribution to the imaginary part describing the deexcitation to lower bound states by emitting a photon(s). We do not include the contribution in the above Lagrangian, as it does not change an essential part of our discussion.\n5The decay width plotted in the x \u2265 0 region is not precisely the same as in eq. (3.10). The width involves higher partial wave contributions in addition to the s-wave contribution in eq. (3.10). See appendix B for more details.

            "heading": "3.2 Decay into a pair of bottom quarks at the threshold",
            "text": "Next, let us consider the decay of the mediator particle at the threshold region of a bottom quark pair, i.e., mA\u2032 ' 2mb ' 10GeV with mb being the bottom quark mass. In this case, not only the electromagnetic interaction but also the strong interaction causes a long-range force acting between the bottom quarks. Hence, it leads to a stronger threshold singularity on the partial decay width of the mediator particle. As in the case discussed in the previous subsection (i.e., A\u2032 \u2192 \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+), the effect of the long-range forces on the partial decay width can be considered using the method of the potential non-relativistic Lagrangian [82, 83]. Then, the effective Lagrangian, in this case, is eventually obtained as follows:\nL(pNR)V ' \u2212 1 2 ~A\u2032 ( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032 +\n\u222b d3r ~\u03c7\u2020(~r, x) ( i\u2202x0 +\n\u22072x 4mb + \u2207 2 r mb \u2212 V (~r)\n) ~\u03c7(~r, x)\n+ \u221a 2/3 e ~A\u2032 [ e2imbx 0 ~\u03c7\u2020(~0, x) + e\u22122imbx0~\u03c7(~0, x) ] , (3.11)\nwhere ~\u03c7(~r, x) and ~\u03c7\u2020(~r, x) are the fields (operators) annihilating and creating the two-body state of a bottom quark pair with the total spin of one (the spin-triplet state). The potential inside the kinetic term of the fields is given by V (~r) = \u22124\u03b1s/(3r)\u2212\u03b1/(9r)\u2212 i\u0393b\u221220i(\u03c02\u2212 9)\u03b13s\u03b4(~r)/(81m2b) at leading order, with gs = (4\u03c0\u03b1s)1/2 being the strong coupling constant. Here, the first and the second terms of the potential describe the long-range forces from the strong and the electromagnetic interactions, respectively. The third term is the imaginary (absorption) part originating in the decay of the bottom quarks, while the fourth term is the one originating in the annihilation between the bottom quarks into three gluons. On the other hand, the kinetic term of the two-body fields in the above Lagrangian, i.e., the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the two-body states, is substantially corrected by the strong interaction. The correction is more substantial when higher excited states are concerned, i.e., when mA\u2032 closer to the threshold is considered because their wave functions are more spread to a larger space and become more sensitive to the infrared QCD behavior. One of the typical consequences of the correction is the color-confinement; no continuum bb\u0304 states\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nappear due to the correction, unlike the \u00b5\u2212\u00b5+ system in section 3.1. One of the methods to take the correction into account is the use of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the potential that is improved theoretically by higher-order QCD corrections with the help of experimental data phenomenologically [93\u201395]. Another method is only the use of experimental data. Because the quantum numbers of the two-body states coupling to the vector mediator particle are the same as those of the final states in e\u2212e+ collision, the R-ratio and spectroscopic data of various mesons can be directly used to evaluate the wave functions of the two-body states. We will therefore adopt the latter method, as explained below in more detail.\nAssuming that the potential, including the QCD correction, is approximated to be spherically symmetric, the two-body fields can be expanded in the same manner as eq. (3.5),\n~\u03c7(~r, x) = \u2211 n, `,m ~Dn`m(x)\u03c8 (D) n`m(~r) = \u2211 n, `,m ~Dn`m(x)Rn`m(r)Y`m(\u03b8, \u03c6), (3.12)\nwith r, \u03b8, and \u03c6 being the spherical coordinates. The radial part of the wave function is denoted by Rn`m(r), while Y`m(\u03b8, \u03c6) is the spherical harmonic function. Substituting this expansion into the effective Lagrangian with the potential involving the correction gives\nL(pNR)V ' \u2212 1 2 ~A\u2032 ( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032 + \u2211 n ~D\u2020n00\n[ i\u22020 + \u22072\n4mb \u2212 E(bb)n +\ni 2\u0393 (bb) n\n] ~Dn00\n+ \u221a 2/3 e ~A\u2032 [ e2imbx\n0 \u2211 n Rn00(0)\u221a 4\u03c0 ~D\u2020n00 + e\u22122imbx 0Rn00(0)\u221a 4\u03c0 ~Dn00\n] , (3.13)\nwhere ~Dn00(x) and ~D\u2020n00(x) are the fields (operators) annihilating and creating the (n\u22121)th excited bb\u0304 bound state with the quantum number JPC = 1\u2212\u2212 (the total spin of one and the orbital angular momentum of zero), i.e., the \u03a5(nS) meson, respectively, with M (bb) n \u2261 2mb+E (bb) n and \u0393(bb)n being the mass and the total decay width of the bound state. Hence, those are directly obtained by the spectroscopic data of the meson [87]. On the other hand, the wave-function of the (n\u22121)-th excited state at the origin, i.e., Rn00(0), is obtained by various branching fractions of the meson decay.

The \u201cdecay width\u201d becomes enormous when the mass of the mediator particle is in the vicinity of the resonances. However, as addressed in section 3.1, it does not mean that the width behaves as shown in the figure, but it indicates the existence of the mixing between the mediator particle and the bound states. We will discuss it in detail in the next section.\n6The value of the bottom quark mass, mb ' 5.3GeV, is obtained by the comparison between the prediction in eqs.

            "text": "To evaluate the total decay width of the vector mediator particle at the threshold region of mA\u2032 \u223c 2mb, we need knowledge of how the vector mediator particle and the upsilon mesons usually decay around this mass region. As seen in the Lagrangian (4.15), the mediator particle decays into a pair of SM leptons and that of SM quarks (or hadrons composed of the quarks) at leading order through the interaction eQi ~A\u2032 \u00b7 f\u0304i~\u03b3fi. On the other hand, the upsilons have various decay channels at leading order: in addition to the decay channels into a pair of SM leptons and that of light SM quarks (u, d, s, c quarks) through the effective interaction,\ne2Qi~\u03d5n(x) \u00b7 \u222b d4y G(\u03b3)(x\u2212 y) \u221a 2mb 3\u03c0 Rn00(0) f\u0304i(y)~\u03b3fi(y) \u223c e2Qi\u221a 3\u03c0 Rn00(0) (2mb)3/2 ~\u03d5n \u00b7 f\u0304i~\u03b3fi,\ni.e., \u03d5n \u2192 ff\u0304 , other decay channels into three gauge bosons, such as \u03d5n \u2192 ggg and gg\u03b3, also contribute to the width significantly. Moreover, upsilons that are heavier than the lightest one decay into lighter upsilons through de-excitation transitions, \u03d5n \u2192 \u03d5m + X (n > m). Finally, the upsilon decays into a pair of B-mesons, i.e., \u03d5n \u2192 BB\u0304, when its mass is larger than 2mB, which dominates the decay width of the upsilon over the other channels. We estimate the decay widths of the vector mediator particle in the following strategy. First, the partial decay width of the mediator particle into a pair of leptons at leading order, i.e., \u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ), is already given in eq. (2.5). On the other hand, when mA\u2032 ' m\u03d5n , this decay width is modified due to the mixing effect. From the Lagrangian (4.18), it becomes\n\u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ) '\n\u03b1mA\u2032\n3\n[ cos\u03d1n +\ne\u221a 3\u03c0\n\u221a 2mbRn00(0)\nm2A\u2032\n( 1\u2212 163\u03c0\u03b1s )1/2 sin\u03d1n ]2 . (4.19)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nHere, we have involved the QCD correction in the above formula to reproduce the decay width (3.14), which is associated with the upsilon state (being now mixed with the mediator particle). The partial decay width into a pair of light (u, d, c, and s) quarks is also obtained in the same method, as mentioned in section 2.2. The decay width at leading order is\n\u03930(A\u2032 \u2192 qiq\u0304i) ' 2 \u03b1mA\u2032 3 \u00d7 3Q 2 i (1 + \u03b4QCD), (4.20)\nwhere Qi is the electric charge of the quark qi. We have included the QCD correction in the above formula, which is associated with the qiq\u0304i final state and estimated to be \u03b4QCD ' \u03b1s/\u03c0 at one-loop level [87]. As in the case of the decay into a lepton pair, the decay width in eq. (4.20) is modified when mA\u2032 ' m\u03d5n . Its partial decay width is then obtained as follows:\n\u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 qiq\u0304i) = 3Q2i (1 + \u03b4QCD) \u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ). (4.21)\nIn addition to the decay channels discussed above, when mA\u2032 ' m\u03d5n , the mediator particle also decays into three SM gauge bosons via the mixing with the upsilon mesons. Using the widths given in eqs. (3.15) and (3.16), the partial decay widths of these processes are\n\u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3gg) ' sin2 \u03d1n \u0393[\u03a5(nS)\u2192 \u03b3gg], (4.22) \u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 ggg) ' sin2 \u03d1n \u0393[\u03a5(nS)\u2192 3g], (4.23)\nwith \u03b3 and g being a photon and a gluon, respectively.11 Moreover, when mA\u2032 ' m\u03d5n with n \u2265 2, the mediator particle decays into a lighter bb\u0304 bound state via a de-excitation process of the upsilon \u03d5n by emitting light SM particles such as pion(s) and photon(s). Such processes significantly contribute to the total decay width of the mediator particle at mA\u2032 ' m\u03d52 and atmA\u2032 ' m\u03d53 , so we involve these contributions to evaluate the decay width. Since no decay channels that significantly contribute to the widths of \u03d52 and \u03d53 exist other than those discussed so far, the sum of the partial decay widths of the de-excitation processes can be estimated using the total decay width of \u03d5n presented in section 3.2 as follows:\n\u0393\u0303n[A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 (bb\u0304) +X] ' sin2 \u03d1n { \u0393(bb)n \u2212 \u2211 i \u0393 [\u03a5(nS)\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ]\u2212 \u2211 i \u0393 [\u03a5(nS)\u2192 qiq\u0304i]\n\u2212 \u0393[\u03a5(nS)\u2192 \u03b3gg]\u2212 \u0393[\u03a5(nS)\u2192 3g] } , (4.24)\nwith n being two or three. Here, (bb\u0304) represents a bound state composed of b and anti-b quarks, and \u0393(bb)n is the total decay width of the upsilon \u03d5n. Here, the partial decay width of \u03a5(nS) into a lepton pair, \u0393 [\u03a5(nS)\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ], is the same as that in eq. (3.14), while the decay width into a quark pair qiq\u0304i is given by \u0393 [\u03a5(nS)\u2192 qiq\u0304i] = 3Q2i (1+\u03b4QCD)\u0393 [\u03a5(nS)\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ], as deduced from the above discussion. Finally, when the mass of the upsilon becomes larger than twice the B meson mass, such as \u03d5n with n being more than three, i.e., the upsilons heavier than \u03a5(3S), it decays into a pair of the B mesons at almost 100% branching\n11The other decay channel into three gauge bosons is \u03d5n \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3. We do not include this decay channel in our analysis, as its contribution to the decay widths of the upsilons is negligibly smaller than other channels.\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nfraction. So, the sum of the partial decay widths of such processes can be approximated as\n\u0393\u0303n[A\u0303\u2032 \u2192 BB\u0304] ' sin2 \u03d1n \u0393(bb)n . (4.25)\nWith the above partial decay widths, the total decay width of the vector mediator particle in the vicinity of the threshold region of a bottom quark pair is obtained as follows:12\n\u0393A\u2032 ' \u2211\n`i=e,\u00b5,\u03c4\n{ \u03930(A\u2032\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i )+ \u2211 n [ \u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i )\u2212\u03930(A \u2032\u2192 `\u2212i ` + i ) ]}\n(4.26)\n+ \u2211\nqi=u,d,c,s\n{ \u03930(A\u2032\u2192 qiq\u0304i)+\n\u2211 n [ \u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032\u2192 qiq\u0304i)\u2212\u03930(A\u2032\u2192 qiq\u0304i)\n]}\n+ \u2211 n [ \u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032\u2192 \u03b3gg)+\u0393\u0303n(A\u0303\u2032\u2192 ggg) ] + \u2211 n=2,3 \u0393\u0303n[A\u0303\u2032\u2192 (bb\u0304)+X]+ \u2211 n\u22654 \u0393\u0303n[A\u0303\u2032\u2192BB\u0304].\nThe total decay width given in eq. (4.26) is depicted assuming the parameter to be 10\u22127 in figure 5 as a solid green line. The decay width obtained by the naive quark-parton model calculation is also shown by a dotted brown line. It is seen in the figure that the decay width is enhanced and suppressed compared to that of the naive quark-parton model calculation in narrow y regions where the mediator particle A\u2032 has a sizable mixing with lighter upsilons \u03d5n with n \u2264 3. On the other hand, the decay width is enhanced in wider y regions when A\u2032 is primarily mixed with heavier upsilons \u03d5n with n \u2265 4, as the heavier upsilons couple to the SM particles more strongly. The suppression comes from the negative interference between the contributions from original interactions of both the mediator and upsilon meson, e.g., the two terms given in eq. (4.19). Unlike mixing with the muonic atom, shown in figure 3, the mediator particle has several decay channels when mixing with the upsilon meson. Then, the cancellation between the contributions does not co-occur in all the channels, making the suppression of the decay width weaker than the enhancement, as seen in figure 5. Here, we quantitatively compare the decay width obtained in this section with that obtained by the R-ratio method. In the latter case, the width is evaluated at the threshold region by adding a Breit-Wigner resonance corresponding to the upsilon meson on top of the observed R-ratio [87]. The comparison between the decay width obtained by the pNR method (solid green line) and that from the R-ratio method (dashed magenta line) in the vicinity of the \u03a5(1S) mass is shown in figure 3. Because of the interference between contributions that the mediator particle originally gives and those from the upsilon mesons, the decay width (as a function of the mediator mass) deviates from the Breit-Wigner form."

The region that is influenced by the mixing is narrower when the mediator particle mixes with a bound state with a larger n, i.e., a heaver upsilon, as the corresponding value of the wave-function at origin, Rn00(0), is smaller for a larger n, as seen in section 3.2.13 In addition to the production of the vector mediator particle discussed above (and in section 4.1.2), those of the SM bound states (muonic atoms, upsilon mesons) and their decay widths are also affected when the bound states are degenerate in mass with the vector mediator particle. It seems possible to put a constraint on by measuring the effect on the bound states. However, it is not straightforward because we have two degenerate particles with the same quantum number when the vector mediator is near one of the bound states. In other words, if we produce the bound state for the measurement, the other particle is automatically produced. Both particles give the same signal, and we observe the sum of the contributions as the signal. When is small enough, it is almost the same as the SM prediction without the existence of the mediator particle.14 If the mass difference between the two particles is larger, it may be possible to separate the contributions from each other. However, it is not clear without a detailed analysis how efficiently we can make such a separation as a function of the mass difference. We leave such an analysis for future work."

            "text": "We have developed the formula to quantitatively estimate the effect of the threshold singularity that emerged in the dark sector scenario with a light mediator. We take the minimal model of the vector mediator particle with a mass around twice the muon mass and twice the bottom quark mass as concrete examples. Using the potential non-relativistic Lagrangian method, we derived the effective Lagrangian, which describes the interaction between the vector mediator particle and the two-body state composed of a muon/bottom quark pair at the threshold region. The interaction between a muon pair is from the Coulomb force, so, in this case, we have derived the formula by explicitly solving the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation. On the other hand, in the case of a bottom quark pair,\n13We have calculated the production cross-section using the narrow width approximation as seen in eq. (4.28), because the width of the mediator particle is still narrow even if it mixes significantly with upsilons. On the other hand, the effect of the finite width will slightly change the region influenced by the mixing in figure 7.\n14E.g., when mixing with a muonic atom, both the muonic atom and the vector mediator particle (or two particles described by their mixings) can be produced in an e\u2212e+ collider and both particles decay into a pair of an electron and a positron. The signal strength, the sum of the production cross-sections, is almost the same as that of the muonic atom in the SM framework, i.e., without the existence of the mediator particle.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\n1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 1.95 2.00 2.05 2.10 y = mA \u2032/mb\n101\n102\n[ (e\ne A \u2032 )/\n2 ]\n[s /1\n00 Ge\nV2 ](n\nb)\n= 10 4\nFigure 7.

The cross-section obtained by the perturbative calculation is also shown by a dotted brown line.\nthe interaction between the quarks is mainly from the strong force, and, unlike the QED case, the infrared QCD behavior complicates the description of the two-body state. So, we estimated the wave function describing the two-body state by utilizing the spectroscopic data of QCD bound states.\nUsing the effective Lagrangian, we have calculated some physical quantities, such as the total decay width of the mediator particle, assuming that it decays visibly, i.e., mainly into SM particles. We have found that the decay width is slightly enhanced because of the Sommerfeld effect when the mass of the mediator particle is just above the threshold of a muon pair, i.e., twice the muon mass. On the other hand, when the mediator mass is in the vicinity of those of muonic atoms below the threshold, the decay width is strongly enhanced because of the mixing effect. Moreover, when the mass is around the threshold of a bottom quark pair, the width is more strongly enhanced, for the vector mediator particle mixes with upsilon mesons more that are strongly interacting with various SM particles.\nSuch an enhancement is expected to give interesting implications to collider physics and cosmology. First, concerning collider physics, enhancing the total decay width is equivalent to shortening the lifetime of the mediator particle. Furthermore, it also means strengthening the interaction with incident colliding particles. So, collider signals of the mediator particle are significantly altered compared to those without taking the singularity effect into account. At the threshold regions, known to be those experimentally uncharted yet, the formula developed in this paper must be mandatory to evaluate the collider signals correctly. On the other hand, concerning cosmology, enhancing the total decay width means increasing the strength of the interaction between the mediator particle and SM particles composing the thermal medium in the early universe. So, it affects the cosmology of the mediator particle differently from that without such an enhancement. Moreover, even if the mass of the mediator particle does not lie very close to the threshold, the thermal correction to the masses of the bound states renders the singularity effect active in the evolution of the universe, so the cosmology is influenced by the effect in a wide mass region of the mediator particle. We leave a detailed discussion of the implications for future studies.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5"

            "text": "In this appendix, we give a derivation of the pNR Lagrangian, shown in eq. (3.3), in some detail and discuss the range in which the use of this pNR Lagrangian is valid. We start with the Lagrangian given in eq. (2.4), where the Lagrangian is also written in the form:\nLV ' 1 2A\u00b5 [ \u03b7 \u00b5\u03bd\u2212(1\u2212\u03be)\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd ]A\u03bd + 1 2A \u2032 \u00b5\n[ ( +m2A\u2032)\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd\u2212\u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd ] A\u2032\u03bd + \u03c8\u0304(i /D\u2212m)\u03c8+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n(A.1) assuming that the mediator particle mass is far enough below the electroweak scale. Here, we introduced the so-called Fermi term \u2212(\u2202\u00b5A\u00b5)2/2\u03be to fix the gauge of the photon field A\u00b5, with \u03be being the gauge parameter. Note that we dropped the subscript \u00b5 from the muon field, the muon mass, etc. to simplify the expression, i.e., we use the notation \u03c8 and m. Since we are discussing the threshold singularity at leading order, i.e., no photon emissions in the final state, we integrate out the photon field (and all other irrelevant fields in our discussion) from the above Lagrangian and obtain the effective action for \u03c8 and A\u2032 as\nS[\u03c8, \u03c8\u0304] ' \u222b d4x [ \u03c8\u0304(x)(i/\u2202\u00b5 \u2212 e /A \u2032 \u00b5 \u2212m)\u03c8(x) + i\n2\n\u222b d4y j\u00b5(x)G\u00b5\u03bd(x\u2212 y) j\u03bd(y) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] ,\nG\u00b5\u03bd(x\u2212 y) = \u2212i \u222b d4q\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03be)q\u00b5q\u03bd/q2 q2 + i0+ e \u2212iq(x\u2212y), (A.2)\nwhere G\u00b5\u03bd(x \u2212 y) is the photon propagater, and j\u00b5(x) = \u2212e\u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3\u00b5\u03c8(x). We adopt the Feynman gauge, \u03be = 1, in the following. Note that a bilinear term of \u03c8 with an imaginary coefficient is obtained by integrating the W boson, electron, and neutrino fields, corresponding to the muon decay width. We do not write the term explicitly and involve it in \u201c\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\u201d As mentioned in section 3.1, the almost on-shell and non-relativistic modes of muons play an essential role in the threshold region. So, we divide \u03c8\u00b5 into two parts as follows:\n\u03c8(x) = \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03c8\u0303(p)e \u2212ipx = (\u222b [NR] + \u222b [NR] ) d4p (2\u03c0)4 \u03c8\u0303(p)e \u2212ipx \u2261 \u03c8NR(x) + \u03c8NR(x),\n\u03c8\u0304(x) = \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 \u00af\u0303\u03c8(p)e+ipx = (\u222b [NR] + \u222b [NR] ) d4p (2\u03c0)4 \u00af\u0303\u03c8(p)e+ipx \u2261 \u03c8\u0304NR(x) + \u03c8\u0304NR(x), (A.3)\nwhere the domain [NR] is defined in section 3.1. Integrating out the non \u201cnon-relativistic\u201d part of the muon field, which is defined by the integral with the domain [NR], leads to\nSNR[\u03c8NR, \u03c8\u0304NR] = \u222b d4x\u03c8\u0304NR(x)(i/\u2202\u00b5 \u2212 e /A \u2032 \u00b5 \u2212m)\u03c8NR(x) (A.4)\n+ i ie 2\n2\n\u222b d4xd4y \u03c8\u0304NR(x)\u03b3\u00b5\u03c8NR(x)G\u00b5\u03bd(x\u2212 y) \u03c8\u0304NR(y)\u03b3\u03bd\u03c8NR(y) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nOne of the crucial terms obtained by integrating out the non \u201cnon-relativistic\u201d parts of the muon fields, \u03c8NR(x) and \u03c8\u0304NR(x), is a four Fermi interaction, which is composed of the non-relativistic parts of the muon fields, \u03c8NR(x) and \u03c8\u0304NR(x), with an imaginary coefficient, describing the annihilation between muon and anti-muon particles into an electron and a positron.15 To deal with the non-relativistic parts of the muon fields more conveniently, we expand the fields with respect to their velocities, as given in eq. (3.1). The expansions are derived so that the two-point function, \u30080|T{\u03c8NR(x)\u03c8\u0304NR(y)}|0\u3009, coincides with the propagator we originally have at the relativistic field theory, i \u222b [NR] d\n4q/(2\u03c0)4 (/q +m) eiqx/(q2 \u2212 m2 + i0+). Substituting the expansions in the effective action (A.4) and taking leading order terms with respect to their velocities gives the non-relativistic (NR) Lagrangian given in eq. (3.2).16\nWe next discuss the derivation of the potential NR effective Lagrangian given in eq. (3.3). The first step is to introduce auxiliary fields and to replace composite operators \u03b7\u2020(x)~\u03c3\u03be(y) and \u03be\u2020(x)~\u03c3\u03b7(y) in eq. (3.2) by a single operator \u03d5(t, ~x, ~y) and its conjugate \u03d5\u2020(t, ~x, ~y), respectively. This can be performed by inserting the following identities, which are the functional analog of a familiar identity \u222b dxdp eip(x\u2212y)/(2\u03c0) = 1, into the partition function:\n1 = \u222b Ds\u2020D\u03d5 exp { i\n2\n\u222b dt d3x d3y ~\u03d5 (t, ~x, ~y) \u00b7 [~s\u2020(t, ~x, ~y)\u2212 \u03b7\u2020(t, ~x)~\u03c3\u03be(t, ~y)] } ,\n1 = \u222b DsD\u03d5\u2020 exp { i\n2\n\u222b dt d3x d3y ~\u03d5\u2020(t, ~x, ~y) \u00b7 [~s(t, ~x, ~y)\u2212 \u03be\u2020(t, ~y)~\u03c3\u03b7(t, ~x)] } , (A.5)\nwhere ~s, ~\u03d5, ~s\u2020, and ~\u03d5\u2020 are the auxiliary fields. Then, the effective action for the fields ~\u03d5, ~\u03d5\u2020 and ~A\u2032, which is denoted by SII[~\u03d5, ~\u03d5\u2020, ~A], is obtained by the logarithm of the partition function of the NR Lagrangian (3.2) integrated over the fields s, s\u2020, \u03b7, \u03b7\u2020, \u03be, \u03be\u2020 as follows:\nSII[~\u03d5, ~\u03d5\u2020, ~A] =\u2212i ln \u222b DsDs\u2020D\u03b7D\u03b7\u2020D\u03beD\u03be\u2020\n\u00d7exp { i\n2\n\u222b dtd3xd3y ~\u03d5(t,~x,~y) \u00b7 [~s\u2020(t,~x,~y)\u2212\u03b7\u2020(t,~x)~\u03c3\u03be(t,~y)] } \u00d7exp { i\n2\n\u222b dtd3xd3y ~\u03d5\u2020(t,~x,~y) \u00b7 [~s(t,~x,~y)\u2212\u03be\u2020(t,~y)~\u03c3\u03b7(t,~x)] } \u00d7exp { i \u222b d4x [ \u221212 ~A\u2032 ( 2 +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032+\u03b7\u2020 ( i\u2202t+ \u22072 2m+ i \u0393 2 ) \u03b7+\u03be\u2020 ( i\u2202t\u2212 \u22072 2m\u2212 i \u0393 2 ) \u03be ]}\n\u00d7exp { i\n2\n\u222b dtd3xd3y~s\u2020(t,~x,~y) [ \u03b1\n|~x\u2212~y| + i2\u03c0\u03b1\n2 3m2 \u03b4(~x\u2212~y) ] ~s(t,~x,~y) }\n\u00d7exp { i \u222b d4x e ~A\u2032 \u00b7 [ e2imx 0 ~s\u2020(t,~x,~x)+e\u22122imx0 ~s(t,~x,~x) ]} . (A.6)\n15This term is not explicitly written in the above Lagrangian; instead, it is given explicitly in the NR Lagrangian (3.2) using a more convenient form. Refer to articles [84, 85] about the derivation of such terms.\n16We dropped A0 terms from the Lagrangian, as we are interested in the on-shell mediator particle.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nThe path-integration over the s and s\u2020 variables in eq.

(A.7)\nHere, ~\u0303A\u2032(P ) is the Fourier transform of ~A\u2032(x), and ~\u0303\u03d5(~r, P ) is the Fourier transform of ~\u03d5(~r,R), ~\u0303\u03d5(~r, P ) = \u222b d4R ~\u03d5(~r,R) eiPR, with R = (t, ~x/2 + ~y/2)T and ~r = ~x \u2212 ~y. On the other hand, the path-integration over the \u03b7, \u03b7\u2020, \u03be, \u03be\u2020 variables in eq.

To summarize, the two-body effective action, SII[~\u03d5, ~\u03d5\u2020, ~A], is obtained as\nSII[~\u03d5, ~\u03d5\u2020, ~A]= \u222b d4x [ \u221212 ~A\u2032( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032 ] + 12 \u222b d4P (2\u03c0)4 \u222b d3rd3r\u2032 ~\u0303\u03d5\u2020(~r,P )D(~r\u2212~r\u2032,E) ~\u0303\u03d5(~r\u2032,P )\n\u2212 12\n\u222b d4P (2\u03c0)4 \u222b d3r [ ~\u0303\u03d5\u2020(~r,P )+2 e ~\u0303A\u2032(P 0\u22122m, ~P )\u03b4(~r)] [ \u03b1 r +i2\u03c0\u03b1 2 3m2 \u03b4(~r) ]\u22121\n\u00d7[ ~\u0303\u03d5(~r,P )+2 e ~\u0303A\u2032(P 0\u22122m, ~P )\u03b4(~r)].

The equations are obtained from the effective action as follows:\n\u222b d3r\u2032D(~r \u2212 ~r\u2032, P 0) ~\u0303\u03d5(~r\u2032, P )\u2212 [ \u03b1\nr + i2\u03c0\u03b1\n2 3m2 \u03b4(~r) ]\u22121 [ ~\u0303\u03d5(~r, P ) + 2 e ~\u0303A\u2032(P 0 \u2212 2m, ~P ) \u03b4(~r)].\n(A.13) The equation for ~\u0303\u03d5\u2020 is also obtained similarly. Applying the differential operator (\u2212\u22072r/m\u2212 E\u2212i\u0393) to the both sides and using the field ~\u0303\u03a6(~r, P ) \u2261 [\u03b1/r+2\u03c0i\u03b12\u03b4(~r)/(3m2)]\u22121[ ~\u0303\u03d5(~r, P )+ 2 e ~\u0303A(P 0 \u2212 2m, ~P )\u03b4(~r)] instead of ~\u0303\u03d5(~r, P ), we obtain the following equation of motion:[\n\u22072r m + E + i\u0393 + \u03b1 r + i2\u03c0\u03b1 2 3m2 \u03b4(~r) ] ~\u0303\u03a6(~r, P )\u2212 2 e ~\u0303A(P 0 \u2212 2m) \u03b4(~r) = 0. (A.14)\nThe effective action for the ~\u0303\u03a6 and ~\u0303\u03a6\u2020 fields must reproduce the above equation of motion for ~\u0303\u03a6 and its conjugate equation (i.e., the equation of motion for ~\u0303\u03a6\u2020), so it is obtained as\n\u222b d4P (2\u03c0)4 \u222b d3r ~\u0303\u03a6\u2020(~r, P ) [ \u22072r m + P 0 \u2212 | ~P |2 4m + i\u0393 + \u03b1 r + i2\u03c0\u03b1 2 3m2 ] ~\u0303\u03a6(~r, P )\n\u2212 \u222b d4P\n(2\u03c0)4 (2 e) ~\u0303A\u2032(P 0 \u2212 2m, ~P ) \u00b7\n[ ~\u0303\u03a6\u2020(~0, P ) + ~\u0303\u03a6(~0, P ) ] . (A.15)\nUsing the Fourier transform of the ~\u0303\u03a6 field, i.e., ~\u03a6(~r, x) \u2261 \u222b d4P/(2\u03c0)4 ~\u0303\u03a6(~r, P )e\u2212iPx, and that of the ~\u0303\u03a6\u2020 field in the above lagrangian, the potential NR lagrangian is obtained as\nL(pNR)V [~\u03a6, ~\u03a6 \u2020, ~A\u2032] =\u221212\n~A\u2032 ( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032+Z {\u222b d3r ~\u03a6\u2020(~r,x) [ i\u2202x0 + \u22072x 4m+ \u22072r m \u2212V (~r) ] ~\u03a6(~r,x)\n\u22122 e ~A\u2032 \u00b7 [ e2imx 0~\u03a6\u2020(~0,x)+e\u22122imx0~\u03a6(~0,x) ]} , (A.16)\nwhere V (~r) = \u2212\u03b1/r\u2212 i\u0393\u00b5\u22122\u03c0i\u03b12/(3m2)\u03b4(~r), which is the same as the one in eq. (3.4). We introduced the normalization parameter Z in the above lagrangian because the relative size between the two terms, the kinetic term of ~A\u2032 and the effective lagrangian for ~\u03a6 and ~\u03a6\u2020,\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nare not determined in the above discussion. We scale the ~\u03a6 and ~\u03a6\u2020 fields as \u03a6\u2192 \u2212\u03a6/ \u221a Z and \u03a6\u2020 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6\u2020/ \u221a Z to make their kinetic term canonical, which gives us the lagrangian\nL(pNR)V [~\u03a6, ~\u03a6 \u2020, ~A\u2032] = \u221212\n~A\u2032 ( +m2A\u2032) ~A\u2032 + \u222b d3r ~\u03a6\u2020(~r, x) [ i\u2202x0 + \u22072x 4m + \u22072r m \u2212 V (~r) ] ~\u03a6(~r, x)\n+ 2\u221a Z e ~A\u2032 \u00b7\n[ e2imx 0~\u03a6\u2020(~0, x) + e\u22122imx0~\u03a6(~0, x) ] . (A.17)\nThe value of Z is obtained by requiring that the above potential NR lagrangian reproduces the perturbative result of a physical observable, such as the decay width of A\u2032 into a muon pair in eq. (2.5); it is found to be Z = 2, so the above lagrangian coincides with that in eq. (3.3). We consider the mass range of the mediator particle, mA\u2032 , where the use of the pNR lagrangian is validated. As shown in the above derivation, the pNR lagrangian is based on the non-relativistic expansion of the muon fields in eq. (A.3). So, the kinetic energy and the momentum of the muon, E and p, have the following hierarchy: O(|~p|) m and O(E) = O(|~p|2/2m).17 Since the muon is pair-produced from the decay of the mediator particle, O(E) = |mA\u2032/2 \u2212 m|. The NR condition and the on-shell relation mentioned above then give the mass range of the mediator particle as O(|~p|2/m2) = O(2E/m) = |mA\u2032/m\u2212 2| 1. In this article, we computed the decay width of the mediator particle within this mass range: above the threshold, i.e., mA\u2032 \u2265 2m, we saw the effect of the Sommerfeld effect on the width in figure 3 within the range of mA\u2032/m \u2212 2 < 10\u22121. On the other hand, below the threshold, i.e., mA\u2032 \u2264 2m, the muons from the decay of the mediator particle form bound states and affect the decay width through the mixing between the mediator particle and the bound states. So, the mass of the mediator particle relevant to the mixing concerns binding energies of the bound states, i.e., |mA\u2032/m\u2212 2| = En/m with En being the binding energy. Since the order of En is \u03b12m, it is within the mass range that the use of the pNR lagrangian is validated."

            "text": "As discussed in section 3.2, the \u201cpartial decay width\u201d of the vector mediator particle into a pair of bottom quarks at the threshold region, \u0393 (A\u2032 \u2192 bb\u0304), has the following form:\n\u0393Res(A\u2032 \u2192 bb\u0304) = \u2211 n 2 2\u03c0\u03b1 3mA\u2032 |Rn00(0)|2f(mA\u2032 ;M (bb)n ,\u0393(bb)n /2). (C.1)\nIt can be seen from the formula that only the bound states (discrete states) appear because of the effect of color confinement. As in the case of the decay into a muon pair, this \u201cdecay width\u201d is obtained using the imaginary part of the self-energy of the mediator particle,\n\u0393(A\u2032 \u2192 bb\u0304) = \u2212 1 mA\u2032 Im\u03a0(mA\u2032). (C.2)\nActually, there are two different contributions to (the imaginary part of) the above selfenergy. One is nothing but the one given in eq. (C.1), which is called the non-perturbative (resonance) contribution, \u03a0Res(q), induced by infinitely many exchanges of photons and gluons between the (non-relativistic) bottom quarks. Hence, it generates the resonances corresponding to the Upsilon mesons as discussed in section 3.2. The other contribution is the continuum (non-resonant) ones, \u03a0Per(q), which gives a non-zero imaginary part of the self-energy that appears in the region of q \u2265 2mB with mB being the mass of the B meson. This contribution can be computed within a perturbative QCD framework as follows:\nIm \u03a0Per(q) ' \u2212 2 \u03b1 9 q 2\n\u221a 1\u2212 4m 2 b\nq2\n( 1 + 2m 2 b\nq2\n) [1 + \u03b4QCD(q)],\n\u03b4QCD(q) ' 4\u2211\nn=1 cn\n( \u03b1s(q) \u03c0 ) , (C.3)\nwhere \u03b4QCD(q) is the QCD correction and is computed at 3-loop levels.18 See ref. [87] for the precise forms of the coefficients cns, as well as the QCD running coupling \u03b1s(q). We, therefore, use the partial decay width of the mediator particle into a bottom quark pair,\n\u0393(A\u2032 \u2192 bb\u0304) = \u0393Res(A\u2032 \u2192 bb\u0304)\u2212 1 mA\u2032 Im \u03a0Per(mA\u2032), (C.4)\ninstead of the width given in eq.

The detailed behavior of \u03a0Per(mA\u2032 ) at mA\u2032 ' 2mb is, however, hidden behind the \u03a5(4S) resonance.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 1 5\nOpen Access.
