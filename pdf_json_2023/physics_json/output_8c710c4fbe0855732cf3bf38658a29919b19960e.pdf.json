Considering its role as a prevalent natural product, as well as interest in potential XN-based therapeutics for treating inammation in the human gut17\u201319 in relation to inammation-induced pathologies, it is crucial to further investigate the interactions related to XN and IXN catabolism resulting in gut-permeable metabolites involved in host-gut microbiome resiliency.\nHost microbiome gut bacteria are capable of multiple biochemical transformations altering the activity or toxicity of xenobiotics.20,21 As a result, the gut microbiome community taxonomy and function may uctuate heavily under extended xenobiotic exposure. Chemical drug transformations can be altered by the microbiome, and in turn the microbiome can be altered by the drug.22,23 Gut microbes such as Eubacterium ramulus and Eubacterium limosum are capable of metabolizing XN into compounds of variable biological activity. Such activity includes decreased biological activity of the reduced chalcone (DXN), increased biological activity of a potent phytoestrogen (8- PN), and unknown biological activity of the demethylated XN (DMX).14 As such, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the microbial mechanisms of the proteins, pathways, and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncatalytic enzymes involved in the direct and/or indirect metabolic conversions of XN in the human host gut microbiome prior to engineering pharmaceutical interventions for XN-based therapeutics in diseases such as IBD.23,24\nHerein, to determine the scope and range of XN covalent and non-covalent protein interactions, we developed a suite of affinity- and activity-based probes (ABPs) based on the core chemical structures of XN and IXN (Fig. 2). These probes were designed to capture the diverse structural potential of XN conversions, and to improve and expand upon a prior XN-based probe alkylated only on the B ring,25 which was used only for labeling mammalian proteins through Michael-type addition. This suite of ABPs aims to prole the range of non-covalent and covalent xanthohumol\u2013protein interactions (Scheme 1).\nUltimately, to fully understand the role XN has with the human microbiome in IBD, both covalent and non-covalent protein target specicity must be determined. To reach beyond the protein interactions occurring at the Michaelacceptor of XN, we aimed to develop photoaffinity-enabled ABPs through insertion of the minimalist, UV-activatable diazirine moiety, allowing for labeling of non-covalent protein\u2013 substrate interactions.26 ABPs based on both the XN and IXN chemical scaffolds allowed us to examine the impact of alkylation site and the binding modes of protein recognition for labeling. We expected the protein labeling affinity for each of the ABPs to vary depending on where the core structure is alkylated through the alteration of hydrogen bond interactions within the binding site of a given protein. From our results, we gained insight into which elements are important for substrate recognition through comparisons of probe protein labeling."

XN contains an intrinsic, although selective, mechanism of covalent protein labeling by way of Michael-type addition at the a,b-unsaturated ketone. To develop ABPs that would prole the range of non-covalent protein targets, we appended a diazirine-alkyne linker to XN and IXN. By alkylating the native core of XN and IXN with either an alkyne linker, or a combination diazirine-alkyne linker, we synthesized a suite of eight ABPs with different protein labeling mechanisms (Fig. 2).\nWe used puried XN (Hopsteiner, Yakima, WA, GAZ:22223928 (https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GAZ_22223928)) extracts from spent hops in lieu of total synthesis. Of the three hydroxyls on XN, only the 4 and 4\u2032 are reactive towards alkylation, with little to no substitution observed on the 2\u2032 hydroxyl (Fig. 1). Alkyne linker 3 was readily synthesized in one step from 5-hexynol using a modied Finkelstein reaction. Diazirine-alkyne linker 4 was sourced commercially (Ambeed, Arlington Heights, IL). Using the linkers 3 and 4, XN probes substituted on the 4\u2032-hydroxyl could be synthesized via Williamson ether synthesis to generate ABPs XN-ABP-1 and XNABP-2 (Scheme 2). Complete chromatographic separation of the other products alkylated on the 4-OH phenol was not possible. Instead, selective protection of the A ring phenol of XN with methoxymethyl chloride (MOMCl) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) afforded 5, of which the B ring phenol was then selectively alkylated with 3 or 4 using K2CO3 and DMF to afford 6 and 7. Careful acidic deprotection with HCl in MeOH and water gave ABPs XN-ABP-3 and XN-ABP-4.\nThe general synthetic approach for the corresponding IXN ABPs was like those derived from XN (Scheme 2). Conversion of XN to IXN was achieved using a base-catalyzed Michael-type intramolecular cyclization of the inner ring in aqueous NaOH,\n29326 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29324\u201329331\nfollowed by precipitation of IXN with concentrated sulfuric acid. IXN was then alkylated on the A ring phenol with 3 or 4, again by way of Williamson ether synthesis conditions, to generate ABPs IXN-ABP-1 and IXN-ABP-2. Similarly, complete chromatographic separation of the other alkylation products was not possible. Instead, IXN was selectively protected usingMOMCl in DMF to afford 8. Subsequent alkylation of the protected IXN using similar Williamson ether synthesis conditions afforded compounds 9 and 10. Treatment of 9 and 10 with HCl in MeOH and water generated ABPs IXN-ABP-3 and IXN-ABP-4, respectively."

CHI is a avonoid degrading enzyme found in the anaerobic gut bacteria Eubacterium ramulus ATCC 29099 (Taxon: 1256908), catalyzing the reversible transformation of a chalcone (i.e. XN) to a avanone (i.e. IXN).27 As such, both XN and IXN are expected to be recognized as substrates for this enzyme. However, due to the anaerobic nature of E. ramulus and the relative low expression in the native microbe, puried chalcone isomerase N domaincontaining protein (HMPREF0373 00112 (https:// www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/U2Q8X2)) was cloned into E. coli BL21-AI.27 ABPs were applied to a bacterial lysate of E. coli BL21-AI over-expressing CHI with incubation at 37 \u00b0C, UVirradiation at 365 nm, click chemistry with the uorescent reporter picolyl rhodamine-azide, and visualization by uorescence imaging of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3).

As expected, minimal labeling is observed with the alkyne-only XN-ABP-2 via Michael addition.\nTo further demonstrate strong probe labeling of CHI, overexpressed CHI in E. coli BL21-AI was diluted into the same, but uninduced, strain. Aer labeling each sample with XN-ABP-1 or IXN-ABP-1, the samples were irradiated, then visualized with picolyl rhodamine azide using click-chemistry. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by uorescence visualization revealed labeled proteins (Fig. 4). Both XN-ABP-1 and IXN-ABP-1 showed strong labeling (Fig. 4) even as CHI was increasingly diluted into the background lysate of E. coli. Decreased uorescence was observed concomitant with increased enzyme dilution. Indiscriminate labeling is observed in the heat shock (\u201cHS\u201d, Fig. 4) samples, showing probe selectivity is lost when proteins are denatured demonstrating that enzyme function and/or structure is required for selectivity. Considering the promiscuity of typical diazirine probes, and the polyphenolic structure of XN/IXN, these probes demonstrate strong selectivity for chalcone isomerase when labeling at 5 mM."

Whole cell lysates from E. coli BL21-AI were individually incubated with each of the eight ABPs, irradiated with UV light for the photoaffinity ABPs, clicked using picolyl biotin-azide, and ABP labeled proteins enriched using streptavidin agarose beads, followed by trypsin digest, and analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The total ion abundances of peptide sequences and identied proteins associated with each ABP enriched sample were compiled and tabulated to generate a dataset (ESI Tables\u2020) detailing the degree to which each ABP and sample type enriched for a specic identied protein, and sorted by iBAQ (Intensity Based Absolute Quantication) score.\nThe photoaffinity probes XN-ABP-1 and IXN-ABP-1 effectively labeled CHI when compared to no probe control samples.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nInterestingly, none of the other six probes passed statistical lters. Thus, only modication of the A-ring of XN and IXN as ABPs is tolerated by CHI. The probes employing only an alkyne linker (XN-ABP-2, XN-ABP-4, IXN-ABP-2, and IXN-ABP-4) do not show any signicant enrichment of CHI. This is predictable, as the only conceivable covalent labeling mechanism of the alkyne-only probes would be a through a Michael-type addition by a free nucleophilic residue near the active site of CHI, of which none are known. Further molecular docking analysis supports that XN and IXN will only bind well to CHI if the B-ring phenol is unmodied.27,28\nDespite not all probes effectively labeling CHI, we believed it important to still analyze all ABP protein targets. It is not expected that all proteins that interact with xanthohumols bind through the same mechanism and/or conguration. Looking beyond CHI, a wide variety of protein targets were signicantly\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29324\u201329331 | 29327\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Relative quantication of protein targets labeled by the probe suite was calculated by iBAQ using MaxQuant quantication analysis soware (v.1.6.17.0).29 732 proteins were identied as having a p value of <0.05 with a 1.5 fold-change versus no probe control samples, and having $2 replicate observations across all datasets within each ABP group. Notably, only a single protein was identied as labeled by all eight ABPs, NAD(P)H nitroreductase. More proteins were identied among the photoaffinity ABP subset.\nOf the proteins identied by the suite of ABPs, there is a broad range of biological and molecular functions targeted. A signicant number of proteins with NAD activity and oxidoreductase activity (32 and 23, respectively) were labeled. Considering the well-established antioxidant activity of xanthohumol, it is unsurprising that numerous oxidoreductases were identied. For instance, prenylated phenols can weakly scavenge\nFig. 6 (A) Volcano plots comparing protein labelling between photoaffin on how each structural modification influences ABP performance.\u2212log2 at 1.5 FC. \u2212log10 p value is on the y-axis, a horizontal line indicating sig proteins demonstrating significant (p < 0.05) preference (FC > 1.5) for th peptide sequence coverage of the same sets of ABPs.\nFig. 5 Spider map illustrating the range of protein targets identified by the suite of ABPs.\n29328 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 29324\u201329331\nreactive oxygen species and may also function as antioxidants through anti-oxidative enzymes.12\nAdditionally, xanthohumols are known to exhibit a wide range of biological activities, partially due to their relatively small structure, allowing versatility as a potential substrate. Additionally, the Michael acceptor moiety provides an intrinsic protein cross-linking mechanism. As such, chemoproteomics revealed a wide range of targets in E. coli BL21-AI, including at least 39 proteins associated with transport mechanisms, 66 transferases, 44 lyases and ligases, and 11 hydrolases. In addition, some proteins were identied belonging to lipopolysaccharide synthesis, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and N-glycan biosynthesis (Fig. 5).\nTo further examine how structural diversity of the probe suite, comparisons were made between probe pairs with one variable isolated (i.e. core scaffold, alkylation site, or labeling mechanism). By calculating the differential iBAQ scores for each protein shared between each pair of ABPs, a relative measure of labeling performance could be determined. Across the board, XN-ABP-1 performs the best in terms of number of proteins identied, unique proteins, CHI labeling efficiency, and iBAQ score and peptide sequence coverage above similar probes. Conversely, XN-ABP-3 had the fewest number of proteins identied compared to the full set of photoaffinity probes, as well as the fewest uniquely identied proteins, suggesting that XN-ABP-3 could be conformationally distinct from the other 3 photoaffinity probes with regards to biological activity. Thus, this may lead to greater selectivity in identied proteins, and decreased labeling efficiency. When the same analysis is conducted using the peptide coverages, the results are similar (Fig. 6).

For the IXN probes, similarly, alkylation on the A ring is strongly preferred, with most shared proteins having greater iBAQ scores and peptide coverage with IXN-ABP-1 than IXN-ABP-3. When comparing probes with the same core structure (chalcone or avanone), it is evident that probes alkylated on the A ring tend to have greater biological activity, identifying a greater range of proteins, and have greater peptide coverage. All these factors point to a necessity for an unfunctionalized B ring hydroxyl for effective recognition by protein targets. This hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that avones and chalcones are most oen observed as the 7-O-glycoside, with conjugation of a sugar to the 7-OH of the A ring, leaving the B ring unfunctionalized.30\nFurthermore, it is believed that chalcones are typically the end product of plant biosynthesis pathways, and are more chemically reactive, and therefore, likely more biologically active.12 As such, it is unsurprising that the XN based probes would display stronger enrichment and a wider range of protein targets, both shared and unique.\nA similar analysis was applied to the set of proteins identied by the alkyne-only ABPs (Fig. 7). However, for each probepair comparison, the number of shared proteins was lower, likely because only a few proteins have a nucleophile within the binding site capable of performing the Michael addition. Minimal evidence in support of ubiquitous Michael-type labeling of reactive thiols was observed. iBAQ scores and peptide coverage did not strongly favor either scaffold, suggesting that perhaps most of the labeling in this set comes from only the strongest hydrophobic interactions. As such, those interactions likely will not be affected by the structural nuances between these probe pairs. In this bacterial model, it's apparent\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthat only a portion of the biological signicance might come from the alkene moiety of XN, yet the potential for other biology activities is high and should be investigated further."

            "text": "In summary, we have developed a structurally diverse suite of XN and IXN based ABPs, through attachment of alkyne or diazirine alkyne linkers to the native substrates. By utilizing multiple core scaffolds, alkylation sites, and labeling mechanisms, we were able to examine how each of these variables affects protein binding within a bacterial model. Initial tests with the known avonoid degrading enzyme CHI showed that the photoaffinity probes are close mimics for the native substrates. ABPP in E. coli BL21 identied a wide range of novel protein targets, and by comparing differential iBAQ scores and peptide coverages between specic probe pairs, we determined XN-ABP-1 and IXN-ABP-1 to be the highest performing ABPs. Despite the importance placed on the intrinsic reactivity of XN towards nucleophilic thiols, we observed minimal evidence in support of widespread protein labeling through a Michael-type addition in a bacterial system. Ongoing work in our group includes application of this rened ABP set to human fecal samples for identication of the molecular interactions of XN and its metabolites with the gut microbiome, and to elucidate how specic bacteria could inuence the use of XN as an oral therapeutic for IBD."
