1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of Myristica fragrans extract and other natural compounds on wound healing.** The study could explore the potential of combining Myristica fragrans extract with other natural compounds, such as curcumin, aloe vera, or honey, to enhance its wound healing properties. This could lead to the development of more effective natural wound healing treatments.


2. **Evaluate the long-term effects of Myristica fragrans extract on wound healing.** The current study only assessed the effects of Myristica fragrans extract on wound healing for 12 days. It would be beneficial to conduct a long-term study to investigate the sustained effects of the extract on wound healing and to determine if there are any potential adverse effects associated with prolonged use.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of Myristica fragrans extract in wound healing.** The study did not explore the mechanisms by which Myristica fragrans extract promotes wound healing. Future research could focus on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the extract's effects, such as its impact on inflammation, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. This knowledge could aid in the development of targeted therapies for wound healing.


4. **Develop a topical formulation of Myristica fragrans extract for clinical use.** The current study used a gel formulation of Myristica fragrans extract, but it would be necessary to develop a topical formulation that is suitable for clinical use. This could involve optimizing the concentration of the extract, selecting appropriate excipients, and conducting stability studies to ensure the formulation's safety and efficacy.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Myristica fragrans extract in wound healing.** The ultimate goal of this research would be to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Myristica fragrans extract in promoting wound healing in humans. This would involve enrolling patients with various types of wounds and comparing the effectiveness of the extract to standard wound care treatments. Positive results from clinical trials would provide strong evidence for the use of Myristica fragrans extract as a natural wound healing agent.
