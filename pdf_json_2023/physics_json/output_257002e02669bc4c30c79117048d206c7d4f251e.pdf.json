            "text": "Pentacoordinated organofluorosilicates ([R5\u2212nSiFn] \u2212; n = 1\u20134) are silicon-based compounds containing a combination of organic and fluoride substituents. They initially attracted great interest due to their excellent properties as fluoride ion donors.1,2 Their advantage is their improved solubility compared to readily available alkali metal fluorides and their increased stability compared to the widely used tetraalkylammonium fluorides.3 Notable examples are the [Me3SiF2]\n\u2212 and [Ph3SiF2]\n\u2212 anions which are an attractive choice for nucleophilic fluorination.2,4 Since the 1980s, when they were first structurally characterised, there have been numerous reports of unique pentacoordinated organofluorosilicate structures (Fig. 1).2,5\u201312\nOrganofluorosilicate structures adopt a trigonal-bipyramidal configuration with the fluorine generally in the axial position.2 Only in one case has fluorine been observed in equatorial position, when the sterically demanding nature of a bulky bidentate ligand forced the fluorine atom into the equatorial plane.10 These pentacoordinated compounds contain 1 to 4\nfluorine atoms, as shown in Fig. 1. The remaining positions are occupied by various organic substituents. Most of them are simple alkyl or aryl groups, although it has been shown that silicon can form heterocyclic structures with bidentate ligands.8\u201310,13 In certain cases, organofluorosilicates can even form the backbone of a coordination polymer.14 Due to the Lewis acidic properties of silanes, polydentate silicon-based ligand acceptors have been developed, leading to various hypervalent polysilicon species.9,15 In this way, the properties of fluorosilanes can be tuned to increase their efficiency in complexing fluoride anion, making them a useful fluoride sensor.12 Zwitterionic pentacoordinated organofluorosilicates are an example of neutral organofluorosilicates in which the\n\u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: NMR, Raman and HRMS spectra of isolated compounds, crystal structure data and computational results.

To our knowledge, there are only a few reports of structurally characterised organofluorogermanates [C23H17O][(CF3CF2)3GeF2] and [(CH3)4N][(CF3)3GeF2]. 16,17 Interestingly, all of them contain strongly electron-withdrawing groups. Like their silicon relatives, fluorogermanates prefer trigonal-bipyramidal configuration with fluorine atoms in the axial positions.\nIn 2016 the imidazolium-based fluorination reagent [IPrH][F] was developed in our research group.18 It has the ability to act as a free fluoride reagent and its reactivity has already been used for the synthesis of discrete [GeF5] \u2212, [SiF5] \u2212, [VOF4] \u2212, [NbF6] \u2212, [TaF6] \u2212, [Me3AlF] \u2212 and [(n-Bu)3AlF] \u2212 anions.19\u201322 The preparation and structural characterisation of these anions was also possible due to the stabilising ability of the [IPrH]+ cation. The steric bulkiness of the cation and its interactions with the anions allow the stabilisation of discrete anions, that would otherwise form polynuclear species, by hindering their interactions with neighbouring anions. A good example of this is the stabilisation of discrete [GeF5]\n\u2212 anions in the structure of [IPrH][GeF5], which tends to form octahedrally coordinated [GeF6]\n2\u2212 units in the presence of sterically less demanding counterions.19 So far, the reactivity of [IPrH][F] has been tested on inorganic compounds known for their strong Lewis acidity20,22 as well as on SiF4 and GeF4. 19\nIn this work, we were interested in reactivity of [IPrH][F] with even weaker Lewis acidic species. The formation and stability of organofluorosilicates depends strongly on the organic substituents attached to the silicon centre. Strong electron-withdrawing groups help in the formation of pentacoordinated anionic species. It is therefore not surprising that there is a distinct lack of organofluorosilicates with electron-donating groups. To this end, we have attempted to synthesise organofluorosilicates with electron donating ethyl groups. Due to the extremely small number of organofluorogermanate compounds, we also decided to test the reactivity towards an organofluorogermane."

The products were prepared according to the synthetic procedures shown in Schemes 1 and 2.\nIn the first step, we converted organochlorosilanes [R4\u2212nSiCln] (n = 1\u20133, R = Ph, Et) and triphenylchlorogermane [Ph3GeCl] to the corresponding organofluorosilanes [R4\u2212nSiFn] (n = 1\u20133, R = Ph, Et) and triphenylfluorogermane [Ph3GeF] by using excess amounts of at least 5 equivalents of KF per chlorine atom of the starting compound. Excess amounts were used\nto ensure complete exchange of the halides. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered through PTFE filters to remove KCl and the remaining KF. In the second step, the filtrate was added to the equimolar solution of [IPrH][F] and stirred overnight. The crystals of the products were isolated by slowly evaporating the solvent in a closed system under static vacuum, the driving force being a temperature difference between 2 parts of the vessel. The crystals of compounds [IPrH][Ph3SiF2] (1), [IPrH][Ph2SiF3] (3), [IPrH][Et2SiF3] (4), [IPrH][PhSiF4] (5), [IPrH][EtSiF4] (6) and [IPrH][Ph3GeF2] (7) were obtained in satisfactory quality and were used for characterisation and further analysis. The ethylfluorosilicates proved to be significantly less stable than their phenyl counterparts. Under reduced dynamic pressure, the ethylfluorosilicates decomposed back into the reactants and the volatile fluorosilane was removed from the reaction mixture. As a result, only [IPrH][F] remained in the vessel, which was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.\nIn the next sections, the structural properties of triorganodifluorosilicates, diorganotrifluorosilicates and organotetrafluorosilicates are going to be presented simultaneously for the ethyl and phenyl counterparts. The properties of the triphenyldifluorogermanate are presented separately."

By following the progress of the reaction between [Et3SiF] and [IPrH][F] in MeCN in an NMR tube, we found that the silane [Et3SiF] did not react and only the reactants were visible in the reaction mixture. Our results indicate that 2 cannot be prepared under these conditions (Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI\u2020). Compound 1 crystallises in the monoclinic space group P21/c and its asymmetric unit is shown in Fig. 2. It contains an imidazolium cation [IPrH]+ and a triphenyldifluorosilicate anion [Ph3SiF2]\n\u2212, which adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the fluorine atoms occupying the axial positions. The two Si\u2013F bond distances in the anion are very similar. The Si(1)\u2013F(1) has a bond distance of 1.743(1) \u00c5, while Si(1)\u2013F(2) has a distance of 1.746(1) \u00c5. This difference is quite small compared to other crystal structures of this anion where this difference in Si\u2013F bond length is more pronounced (1.734(1) and 1.721(1) \u00c5; 1.753(2) and 1.718(2) \u00c5; 1.732(1) and 1.726(1) \u00c5).5,23,24 This could be due to the packing or the similarly strong hydrogen bonds that both fluorine atoms form with imidazolium cations. The [Ph3SiF2]\n\u2212 anion interacts with two adjacent cations to form 2 hydrogen bonds, each with one fluorine atom. The first hydrogen bond forms between F(1) and the hydrogen atom at the C2 position C(22)\u2013H(22)\u22efF(1) with an H\u22efF distance of 2.0841(9) \u00c5, while the second hydrogen bond forms between F(2) and the hydrogen atom on the backbone of the symmetrically generated unit C(24)\u2013H(24)\u22efF(2) with an H\u22efF distance of 2.0383(9) \u00c5. All significant interactions between cations and anions of the structurally characterised compounds are described with bond lengths and bond angles and are listed in Table S4 in the ESI.\u2020 Significant interactions were defined according to the calculations for [IPrH][GeF5] and [IPrH][SiF5]. 19"

To ensure quantitative conversion of chlorosilane to fluorosilane, the reaction time for halide exchange was doubled compared to other silanes. Compound 5 crystallises in the triclinic space group P1\u0304, while 6 crystallises in the monoclinic space group I2a. The crystal structures of 5 and 6 are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, respect-\nively. The asymmetric units of the two compounds consist of two ion pairs. For clarity, only one of each is presented. The complete asymmetric units of 5 and 6 are shown in Fig. S25 and S27 in the ESI.\u2020 Both crystal structures feature a discrete [IPrH]+ cation and a discrete [PhSiF4] \u2212 or [EtSiF4] \u2212 anion, which have a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with 2 fluorine atoms in axial and 2 fluorine atoms in equatorial positions. In addition, the positions of the fluorine atoms in 5 are disordered. Two preferred orientations were modelled and refined, with domain A occupancy of 70% (anion 1) and 56% (anion 2) and domain B occupancy of 30% (anion 1) and 44% (anion 2). The disorder of the fluorine atoms is the result of two possible positions of the fluorine atoms in the anion due to the rotation of the fluorine atoms around the C(1A)\u2013Si(1A) axis. The atoms in domain B are rotated by 90\u00b0 compared to those in domain A. Due to high disorder in 5, the bond lengths and angles are not discussed further. However, they are given in Table S3 in the ESI.\u2020\nCompound 6 has longer Si\u2013F bonds at axial positions (anion 1: Si(1)\u2013F(1) 1.701(1) \u00c5 and Si(1)\u2013F(2) 1.672(1) \u00c5, anion 2: Si(2)\u2013F(5) 1.698(1) \u00c5, Si(2)\u2013F(6) 1.670(1) \u00c5) than in equatorial position (anion 1: Si(1)\u2013F(3) 1.618(1) \u00c5 and Si(1)\u2013F(4) 1.614(1), anion 2: Si(2)\u2013F(7) 1.621(1) \u00c5 and Si(2)\u2013F(8) 1.617(1) \u00c5). Similar behaviour was observed in the structures of 3 and 4 and is consistent with the literature data for [MeSiF4]\n\u2212.25 Moreover, the angles between the two axially positioned fluorine atoms (anion 1: F(1)\u2013Si(1)\u2013F(2) 174.87(7)\u00b0, anion 2: F(5)\u2013Si(2)\u2013F(6) 174.56(7)\u00b0) are smaller than the ideal angle of 180\u00b0. This distortion can be attributed to the influence of the organic substituent on the remaining fluorine atoms.\nIn 5 the [PhSiF4] \u2212 interacts with 3 imidazolium cations and forms several interactions.

All relevant interactions are provided in Table S4 in the ESI.\u2020 In the structure we have noticed the interactions between hydrogen atom at C2 position of the imidazolium ring and the closest axial and equatorial fluorine atoms.

            "text": "Pentacoordinated organofluorogermanates are an interesting rarity, as very few structurally characterised compounds of this type exist.16,17 After initial success in the synthesis of various organofluorosilicates with [IPrH][F], we wanted to test the reactivity of analogous germanium compounds. In this way, [IPrH][Ph3GeF2] (7) was prepared in quantitative yield under the same reaction conditions used for the synthesis of organofluorosilicates. The crystal structure of 7 is shown in Fig. 7. Interestingly, the same crystallisation procedure produced 3 different types of crystals. The crystal structure of 7 shown in Fig. 7 crystallises without any solvent molecules in the triclinic space group P1\u0304. The asymmetric unit consists of two ion pairs, but for clarity only one is shown in Fig. 7. In addition, we have structurally characterised 2 other structures of 7 in the form of solvates with MeCN 7a and 7b, each containing one molecule of MeCN. 7a crystallises in the triclinic space group P1\u0304, while the 7b crystallises in the orthorhombic space group P212121. Due to the similarity of the anions with 7, the structural features of 7a and 7b are not discussed further. The complete asymmetric units of 7, 7a and 7b are shown in Fig. S28\u2013S30 in the ESI.\u2020 The [Ph3GeF2]\n\u2212 anion in 7 retains the trigonal bipyramidal geometry typical of organofluorogermanates and organofluorosilicates with both fluorine atoms in axial position. Although it has the same geometry as the [Ph3SiF2] \u2212 anion, 1\nand 7 are not isostructural and crystallise in different space groups of P1\u0304 and P21/c, respectively. The average Ge\u2013F bond distance of the [Ph3GeF2]\n\u2212 anion of 1.920 \u00c5 is longer compared to other structurally characterised organofluorogermanate anions of [(C2F5)3GeF2] \u2212 and [(CF3)3GeF2] \u2212, which have average Ge\u2013F bond lengths of 1.834 \u00c5 and 1.810 \u00c5, respectively.16,17 The Ge\u2013F bond distances of the reported anions are probably shorter due to the strong electron-withdrawing groups attached to the germanium atom. Similarly to 1, [Ph3GeF2] \u2212 also interacts with 2 adjacent cations. One hydrogen bond is formed between the first fluorine atom and the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the symmetrically generated unit (anion 1: F(1)\u22efH(72) 1.982(2) \u00c5, anion 2: F(4)\u22efH(42) 1.921(2) \u00c5), while the other is formed between the second fluorine atom and the hydrogen atom on the imidazolium backbone (anion 1: F(2)\u22efH(45) 2.078(2) \u00c5, anion 2: F(3A)\u22efH(75) 1.93(1) \u00c5 and F(3B)\u22efH(75) 2.07(2) \u00c5). An additional interaction is formed between the fluorine atom F(2) and the hydrogen atom on the neighboring phenyl ring (F(2)\u22efH(79) 2.373(2) \u00c5)."

The signals that are more downfield belong to the fluorine atoms in axial positions, while the fluorine atoms in equatorial positions have signals shifted upfield. 19F\u201319F coupling between the axial and equatorial fluorine atoms was not observed. This is most likely due to the large peak widths of the signals, which measure about 100 Hz. Similar behaviour of this system was described previously.26 In 4, the signal for the fluorine atoms in the axial positions is significantly moved upfield, compared to its methyl equivalent.25 All other ethylfluorosilicates have similar values to their methyl-substituted relatives. In addition, the signal of 7 (\u2212143.73 ppm) agrees with the values reported for [(CH3)3N][(CF3)3GeF2] (\u2212137.6 ppm).16 Surprisingly, the two compounds have only slightly different signals, although the anions contain quite different substituents."

In 7, we attributed the Ge\u2013F vibration at 662 cm\u22121 to the symmetric stretching of GeF2 unit.

The data for the ethylfluorosilicate and germanate counterparts can be found in Fig. S31, S32 and Tables S5, S6 in the ESI.\u2020 Table 2 shows that the calculated Si\u2013C distances agree well with the experimental results, although they are slightly longer (1: calc. 1.92 \u00c5, exp. 1.907(2) \u00c5). On the other hand, the\ncalculated Si\u2013F values are significantly longer than the experimental values (1: calc. 1.85 \u00c5, exp. 1.746(1) \u00c5). The difference can be explained by the fact that the calculations were performed in the gas phase, where there is no effect of crystal packing. The [IPrH]+ cations tend to form strong hydrogen bonds and other electrostatic interactions with the silicate and germanate anions.19 Therefore, in the gas phase calculations, where no additional neighbouring cations and anions are present, the two ions arrange differently than in the crystal structure. We have also observed similar behaviour between the calculated and the structurally determined bond distances for organofluoroaluminate anions.22 Interestingly, according to DFT calculations the formation of interactions between the [IPrH]+ cation and the silicate or germanate anions result in the elongation of the Si\u2013F or Ge\u2013F bonds in axial position that are involved in the interactions.\nIn some cases, the calculations agree with experimentally observed results. For example, Table 2 shows that the Si\u2013F bonds involved in interactions with hydrogen atoms at C2 position are particularly long (3: calc. 1.81 \u00c5, exp. 1.711(1) \u00c5).

            "text": "In this work we present a comprehensive study on the reactivity of organofluorosilanes and an organofluorogermane with the imidazolium-based naked fluoride reagent [IPrH][F]. It possesses a sterically demanding cation that has been shown to be able to stabilise discrete anions. For this reason, [IPrH][F] seemed to be a good choice for the preparation of related organofluorosilicates and germanates.\nStarting from commercially available organochlorosilanes, triphenylchlorogermane and potassium fluoride, a series of organofluorosilanes and Ph3GeF were prepared, which were further reacted with [IPrH][F] to form a triphenyldifluorogermanate [IPrH][Ph3GeF2] (7) and organofluorosilicates [IPrH][R4\u2212nSiFn+1] (n = 1\u20133, R = Ph, Et) (1\u20136), with the exception of [IPrH][Et3SiF2] (2). The reactions described are simple and selective without the need for purification of the reaction mixtures. Where possible, the newly prepared compounds were characterised by X-ray structural analysis, NMR and Raman spectroscopy. Here we present the synthesis of ethyl-substituted organofluorosilicates (4, 6), which were previously unknown. Despite their weaker Lewis acidity, which is the result of its electron donating substituents, they were able to form stable organofluorosilicate salts. Unfortunately, compound 2 did not form, even in solution. An interesting discovery was also compound 7, which is an extremely rare example of an organofluorogermanate salt and the first structurally characterised one with aromatic substituents. In this work we have shown that [IPrH][F] is a suitable reagent for the formation of new organofluorogermanate and organofluorosili-\ncate species. The experimentally obtained results are in agreement with the DFT calculations. The results show that in the [IPrH][R4\u2212nSiFn] (n = 1\u20133, R = Ph, Et) series, the stability of the products increases with increasing number of fluorine atoms. Calculations for the germanium series have yielded similar results."
