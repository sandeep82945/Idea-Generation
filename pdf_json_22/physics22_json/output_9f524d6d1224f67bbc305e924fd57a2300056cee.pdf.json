    "abstractText": "Many physical phenomena in fields of studies such as optical fibre, solid-state physics, quantum field theory and so on are represented using nonlinear evolution equations with variable coefficients due to the fact that the majority of nonlinear conditions involve variable coefficients. In consequence, this article presents a complete Lie group analysis of a generalized variable coefficient damped wave equation in quantum field theory with time-dependent coefficients having dual powerlaw nonlinearities. Lie group classification of two distinct cases of the equation was performed to obtain its kernel algebra. Thereafter, symmetry reductions and invariant solutions of the equation were obtained. We also investigate various soliton solutions and their dynamical wave behaviours. Further, each class of general solutions found is invoked to construct conserved quantities for the equation with damping term via direct technique and homotopy formula. In addition, Noether\u2019s theorem is engaged to furnish more conserved currents of the equation under some classifications.",

The KdV equation is interconnected in diverse ways to physical problems that involve acoustic waves on a crystal lattice as well as ion-acoustic waves in a plasma, long internal waves in a density-stratified ocean along with shallow water waves with weakly non-linear restoring forces. Nonlinearity is a captivating and enthralling element of nature. Besides, it is a known fact that many physical phenomena are represented by NLEVEQ as well as its higher-order form with variable coefficients because the vast majority of genuine nonlinear physical conditions involve variable coefficients. Scientists in their numbers have deemed it fit to contemplate nonlinear science as the most significant frontier for the fundamental comprehension of nature. Some of these models include a generalized system of three dimensional variable-coefficient modified Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili\u2013Burgers-type equation in [2] was studied. The modified and generalized Zakharov\u2013Kuznetsov model, which recounts the\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 83. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14010083 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nion-acoustic drift solitary waves existing in a magnetoplasma with electron-positron-ion which are found in the primordial universe was investigated in [3,4]. This equation was used to model ion-acoustic, dust-magneto-acoustic, quantum-dust-ion-acoustic and/or dust-ion-acoustic waves in one of the cosmic or laboratory dusty plasmas. Moreover, in [5] the vector bright solitons, as well as their interaction characteristics of the coupled Fokas\u2013 Lenells system, which models the femtosecond optical pulses in a birefringent optical fibre, was examined. In addition, the Boussinesq\u2013Burgers-type system of equations which delineates shallow water waves appearing close to lakes or ocean beaches was studied in [6], to name a few, see more in [7\u201310]. Lie group theory was brought to light by a Norwegian mathematician whose name was Marius Sophus Lie (1842\u20131899). This occurred around the middle of the nineteenth century. Lie, in their research recognized that the seemingly dissimilar techniques for securing exact solutions of differential equations (DEQs) were, in fact, all special cases of a wide integration approach; the theory of transformation groups. Analogous to this theory is the Galois theory which has an enormous influence on mathematics and mathematical physics today. In fact to be precise, the origins of Lie group are to be found in Galois\u2019 simple, yet profound observation that the set of symmetries of a geometric object forms a group. Through a surprisingly tortuous route that began with a study of the integration of partial differential equations (PDEQs), Lie was led to introduce the continuous groups that now bear their name, an accomplishment that has had remarkable consequences for mathematics and physics. In addition, Lie often viewed their mission particularly as the extension of Galois theory to the study of differential equations [11]. Further, it is regarded to be one of the most pertinent and significant techniques for determining closed-form solutions of differential equations. Lie symmetry analysis [11\u201316] has been given some credits in light of the fact that it is one of the most efficient techniques engaged in the analysis of differential equations. The last few decades have witnessed a long overdue and widespread popularization of Lie\u2019s constructive, infinitesimal symmetry methods, applied to an incredible variety of mathematical, physical and other problems. Less well documented though, is the role symmetry groups play in the classification of differential equations and variational problems. Of particular importance is Lie\u2019s classification of all possible Lie groups of transformations acting on one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional manifolds. The symmetry groups that arise most often in the applications to geometry and differential equations are Lie groups of transformations acting on a finite-dimensional manifolds [11]. There are many studies in the literature dealing with the analysis of differential equations based on Lie symmetries, reductions and invariant solutions [3,4,17]. In addition to Lie symmetry analysis and inverse scattering transform [18] which was developed to find solutions to the KdV equation, many other essential approaches for achieving closed-form solution of NLEVEQ have been given. These comprise exp(\u2212\u03a6(\u03b7))-expansion technique [19,20], Painlev\u00e9 expansion [21], Cole\u2013Hopf transformation approach [22], Adomian decomposition approach [23], homotopy perturbation technique [24], mapping method and extended mapping method [25,26], B\u00e4cklund transformation [27], rational expansion method [28], F-expansion technique [29], tan-cot method [30], extended simplest equation method [31], Hirota technique [32], bifurcation technique [33] and so on. One of the ways by which physical systems are studied is the consideration of the generalized structure of the model representing these systems [3]. An example is the KdV equation with dual-power law nonlinearity presented as [34]\nut + punux + qu2nux + ruxxx = 0, (2)\nwith nonzero constant coefficients p, q and r. Equation (2) possesses various applications with regards to quantum field theory, plasma as well as solid-state physics [34]. For instance, the kink soliton can be utilized in calculating momentum, energy flow along with the topological charge in the quantum field. Particular cases n = 1 and n = 2 which we call KdV and modified KdV equations, respectively, have been studied by researchers.\nFor example, Dey and Coffey [35,36] investigated the kink-profile solitary wave solutions of (2). Generalized Equation (2) was investigated recently by the authors in [37] where they secured the general analytic travelling wave solutions of the equation as dark, bright as well as periodic soliton solutions. These general solutions were achieved for different values of parameter n.\nMathematical Analysis\nWe investigate Lie group classification of two different cases of the generalized variable coefficient KdV equation with dual power-law nonlinearities and linear damping dispersion ((1+1)D-gvcKdVDampe) in quantum field theory which is expressed as:\nut + Q(t)unux + S(t)u2mux + H(t)u + G(t)uxxx = 0 (3)\nwith time-variable coefficients Q(t), S(t), H(t) and G(t) together with positive integer exponents n and m. In Equation (3), ut which is the first term represents the evolution term while the second term is referred to as the power law nonlinearity with n called the index of power law. Besides, the third term is the dual power law nonlinearity where 2m is the index of dual power law while H(t)u depicts linear damping term and G(t)uxxx denotes the dispersion term. Equation (3) is a more generalized version of the KdV equation with power law nonlinearity with linear damping and dispersion which reads [38]:\nut + a(t)unux \u2212 l(t)ux \u2212 b(t)u + c(t)uxxx = 0 (4)\nwhere a(t), b(t), c(t) and l(t) are arbitrary smooth functions with regards to t. A special case of (4) with a(t) = 6, n = 1, b(t) = 0, c(t) = 1 and l(t) = \u22121/2t was examined in [38]. The authors implored Lie symmetry analysis to secure optimal system together with invariant solutions of the equation under the given case. In [39], the author via the ansatz technique, gained some exact solitary wave solutions of the equation with power law nonlinearity with time-dependent coefficients of the nonlinear alongside the dispersion terms. These solutions were secured with regards to tan-hyperbolic as well as cos-hyperbolic functions. Moreover Johnpillai et al. [40] investigated Lie point symmetries and exact solutions of the modified structure of (4) with time-dependent coefficients taking into consideration special cases a(t) = 1/t, c(t) = K/t2 as well as a(t) = K0, c(t) = K1 exp(\u22122K0t) where K, K0 and K1 are regarded as constants. In consequence, diverse bright soliton, dark soliton and singular soliton wave solutions were secured via ansatz approach. Further, the authors in [41] have studied Lie symmetry classification of the version of KdV equation.\nIn the literature, Vaneeva [42] studied the variable-coefficient Gardner equation\nut + A2(t)uux + A3(t)u2ux + A1(t)uxxx = 0, (5)\nwith A2(t) together with A3(t), smooth functions satisfying the condition that A1(t).A3(t) 6= 0. Moreover, Bruzon et al. [43] investigated generalized Gardner equation structured as:\nut + A2(t)unux + A3(t)u2nux + A1(t)uxxx + A4(t)u = 0, (6)\nwhere positive integer n is arbitrary. Besides, Lie point symmetries alongside conservation laws of the equation for n = 1 are further examined in [44]. A version of generalized variable-coefficient Gardner Equation (6) of the form [45]:\nut + A2(t)umux + A3(t)u2nux + A1(t)uxxx + A4(t)u = 0, (7)\nwith positive integer m was investigated. The authors obtained \u00b5-symmetries, \u00b5-invariant and \u00b5-conservation laws of the equation. It is to be observed that the generalized version of (4) contemplated in this study in a way resembles (7). However, techniques utilized are not exactly the same and as such completely different results are obtained.\nIn this research work, we catalogue our article in the structure given subsequently, that is, in Section 2, we carry out Lie group classification of (1+1)D-gvcKdVDampe (3) for cases H(t) 6= 0 and H(t) = 0 when n = m using the appropriate equivalence transformations. In addition, we obtained adequate extended Lie algebras under each classification, perform symmetry reductions and obtained invariant solutions. We further study various soliton solutions of the equation and their dynamical wave behaviours which are later analyzed. Section 3 investigates Lie group analysis of the underlying equation for n 6= m. Section 4 purveys various observations and discussion of the obtained results. Further, in Section 5, we give the various graphical depictions of the results obtained and discuss them. Section 6 purveys the conservation laws of the underlying equation with the use of the multiplier technique. Noether\u2019s theorem is also invoked to achieve more conserved currents of the equation. Later, we give the concluding remarks in Section 7."

Equivalence Transformations\nWe seek equivalence transformation of class (3) and in making a success of that we recollect that an equivalence transformation regarding a partial differential Equation (PDEQ) refers to an invertible transformation of both the independent as well as dependent variables mapping the PDEQ into another PDEQ possessing the same structure, where the structure assumed by the transformed functions can, in general, vary from the structure of the original function. In other words, an equivalence transformation of class (3) in this instance depicts a non-degenerating point transformation (t, x, u(t, x)) to (t\u0303, x\u0303, u\u0303(t\u0303, x\u0303)) that retains differential form but with different arbitrary functions Q\u0303(t\u0303), S\u0303(t\u0303), G\u0303(t\u0303) and H\u0303(t\u0303) from the original one. In consequence, we present equivalence transformations of (3) in the subsequent subsection.\n2.2. Case 1.

(12)\nOn solving the obtained system of equations given in (12) we achieve:\n\u03be1 = a(t),\n\u03be2 = A1x + A2,\n\u03b7 = b(t)u, \u21261 = ( A1 \u2212 a\u2032(t)\u2212 nb(t) ) Q, \u21262 = (A1 \u2212 a\u2032(t)\u2212 2nb(t))S, \u21263 = (3A1 \u2212 a\u2032(t))G, \u21264 = \u2212(b\u2032(t) + b(t)H),\nwhere A1 and A2 are constants as well as a(t) and b(t) arbitrary functions of t. As a result, the equivalence generators of class (3) are calculated as:\nQ1 = \u2202x, Q2 = x\u2202x + Q\u2202Q + S\u2202S + 3G\u2202G, Qa = a(t)\u2202t \u2212 a\u2032(t)Q\u2202Q \u2212 a\u2032(t)S\u2202S \u2212 a\u2032(t)G\u2202G, Qb = b(t)u\u2202u \u2212 nb(t)Q\u2202Q \u2212 2nb(t)S\u2202S \u2212 ( b\u2032(t) + b(t)H ) \u2202H .\nCorrespondingly, the equivalence group associated to each of the equivalence generators is presented as:\nQ1 : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = x + c1, u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Q, S\u0303 = S, G\u0303 = G, H\u0303 = H, Q2 : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = xec2 , u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Qec2 , S\u0303 = Sec2 , G\u0303 = Ge3c2 , H\u0303 = H, Qa : t\u0303 = a(t), x\u0303 = x, u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Q\na\u2032(t) , S\u0303 = S a\u2032(t) , G\u0303 = G a\u2032(t) , H\u0303 = H,\nQb : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = x, u\u0303 = ueb(t)c4 , Q\u0303 = Qe\u2212nb(t)c4 , S\u0303 = Se\u22122nb(t)c4 , G\u0303 = G,\nH\u0303 = He\u2212b(t)c4 \u2212 b\u2032(t)c4.\nMoreover, the composition of Q1, . . . ,Qb, when computed produces:\nt\u0303 = a(t), x\u0303 = (x + c1)ec2 , u\u0303 = ueb(t)c4 , Q\u0303 = Qec2\u2212nb(t)c4\na\u2032(t) ,\nS\u0303 = Sec2\u22122nb(t)c4\na\u2032(t) , G\u0303 =\nGe3c2 a\u2032(t) , H\u0303 = He\u2212b(t)c4 \u2212 b\u2032(t)c4. (13)\nFurther, since we are having two arbitrary functions a(t) alongside b(t) in (13), it is observed that one can rescale two of the arbitrary functions which are present in (3) [42,46]. Therefore, we set G\u0303 = H\u0303 = 1 and in consequence, we achieve:\na(t) = \u222b\nQe3c2 dt, b(t) = 1 c4\n{ ln ( c4 + c4 \u222b Hetc4 dt ) \u2212 tc4 } (14)\nand so we eventually have the equivalence transformation:\nt\u0303 = \u222b Ge3c2 dt, x\u0303 = (x + c1)ec2 , u\u0303 = uc4e\u2212tc4 \u222b Hetc4 dt, (15)\nwhich by extension transforms (3) into an equivalent equation expressed as:\nu\u0303t\u0303 + Q\u0303(t\u0303)u\u0303 n\u0303u\u0303x\u0303 + S\u0303(t\u0303)u\u03032n\u0303u\u0303x\u0303 + u\u0303 + u\u0303x\u0303x\u0303x\u0303 = 0,\nwhere\nQ\u0303 = Qe\u2212(nb(t)c4+2c2)\nG , S\u0303 =\nSe\u22122(nb(t)c4+c2)\nG .\nHence, without loss of generality, we can restrict our investigation to the equation\nut + Q(t)unux + S(t)u2nux + u + uxxx = 0. (16)\n2.3. Case 2. H(t) = 0\nIn this case, Equation (3) narrows down to a time variable-coefficient version of the well celebrated KdV equation, which implies\nut + Q(t)unux + S(t)u2nux + G(t)uxxx = 0. (17)\nOn invoking the appropriate steps in solving the related extended system to (17) as we have earlier demonstrated we secure the system of equations calculated as:\n\u03be1x = \u03be 1 u = 0, \u2126 1 x = \u2126 1 u = \u2126 2 x = \u2126 2 u = \u2126 3 x = \u2126 3 u = 0, \u03be2u = 0, \u03b7uu = 0, \u03be 2 xx \u2212 \u03b7xu = 0, \u21263 + (\u03be1t \u2212 3\u03be2x)G = 0,\n\u03b7t + \u03b7x ( Qun + Su2n ) + G\u03b7xxx = 0,\n\u21261un + \u21262u2n + nQun\u22121\u03b7 + 2nSu2n\u22121\u03b7 \u2212 \u03be2t \u2212 G\u03be2xxx + 3G\u03b7xxu + (\u03be1t \u2212 \u03be2x) ( Qun + Su2n ) = 0. (18)\nWe solve the gained system of equations given in (18) and thus achieve:\n\u03be1 = \u03d1(t),\n\u03be2 = k3x + k4,\n\u03b7 = k1u, \u21261 = ( k3 \u2212 nk1 \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t) ) Q, \u21262 = (k3 \u2212 2nk1 \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t))S, \u21263 = (3k3 \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t))G,\nwith constants k1, k2 and k3 as well as arbitrary function \u03d1(t) depending on t. Eventually, we secure the equivalence generators of class (17) in this regard as:\nQ1 = \u2202x, Q2 = u\u2202u \u2212 nQ\u2202Q \u2212 2nS\u2202S, Q3 = x\u2202x + Q\u2202Q + S\u2202S + 3G\u2202G, Q\u03d1 = \u03d1(t)\u2202t \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t)Q\u2202Q \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t)S\u2202S \u2212 \u03d1\u2032(t)G\u2202G.\nThe commutation relations between the generators are expressed in a tabular form in Table 1.\nWhich reveals a skew-symmetric characteristic with zero diagonal entries. Furthermore, the equivalence transformations associated with the operators Q1, . . . ,Q\u03d1 are then computed and presented as:\nQ1 : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = x + c1, u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Q, S\u0303 = S, G\u0303 = G, Q2 : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = x, u\u0303 = uec2 , Q\u0303 = Qe\u2212nc2 , S\u0303 = Se\u22122nc2 , G\u0303 = G, Q3 : t\u0303 = t, x\u0303 = xec3 , u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Qec3 , S\u0303 = Sec3 , G\u0303 = Ge3c3 , Q\u03d1 : t\u0303 = \u03d1(t), x\u0303 = x, u\u0303 = u, Q\u0303 = Q\n\u03d1\u2032(t) , S\u0303 = S \u03d1\u2032(t) , G\u0303 = G \u03d1\u2032(t) .\nHence, we have their compositions as:\nt\u0303 = \u03d1(t), x\u0303 = (x + c1)ec3 , u\u0303 = uec2 , Q\u0303 = Qec3\u2212nc2\n\u03d1\u2032(t) ,\nS\u0303 = Sec3\u22122nc2\n\u03d1\u2032(t) , G\u0303 =\nGe3c3 \u03d1\u2032(t) . (19)\nLetting G = 1, we further scale down the variable coefficients in (17) and so achieve equivalence transformation which we express as:\nt\u0303 = \u222b Ge3c3 dt, x\u0303 = (x + c1)ec3 , u\u0303 = uec2 , (20)\nwhich then transforms (3) into an equivalent equation\nu\u0303t\u0303 + Q\u0303(t\u0303)u\u0303 n\u0303u\u0303x\u0303 + S\u0303(t\u0303)u\u03032n\u0303u\u0303x\u0303 + u\u0303x\u0303x\u0303x\u0303 = 0,\nwith\nQ\u0303 = Qe\u2212(nc2+2c3)\nG , S\u0303 =\nSe\u22122(nc2+c3)\nG\nand so we confine our study to the resultant variable-coefficient equation\nut + Q(t)unux + S(t)u2nux + uxxx = 0. (21)\n2.4. Principal Lie Algebra and Classifying Relations\nWe secure the principal Lie algebra of Equations (16) and (21) in that order in this subsection.\n2.4.1. Principal Lie Algebra of (3) with H(t) 6= 0 We generate the symmetry group of (16) via the vector field structured as:\nX = \u03be1(t, x, u) \u2202\n\u2202t + \u03be2(t, x, u)\n\u2202\n\u2202x + \u03b7(t, x, u)\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (22)\non applying the third prolongation of X to Equation (16) and also splitting same on diverse derivatives of u produces the eight overdetermined system of linear PDEQs\n\u03be1u = 0, \u03be 2 u = 0, \u03b7uu = 0, \u03be 1 x = 0, 3\u03b7xu \u2212 3\u03be2xx = 0, 3\u03be2x \u2212 \u03be1t = 0, u\u03b7u \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7t \u2212Q(t)un\u03b7x \u2212 S(t)u2n\u03b7x \u2212 3u\u03be2x \u2212 \u03b7xxx = 0, unQt(t)\u03be1 + u2nSt(t)\u03be1 + nQ(t)un\u22121\u03b7 + 2nS(t)u2n\u22121\u03b7 + 2Q(t)un\u03be2x + 2S(t)u2n\u03be2x \u2212 \u03be2t + 3\u03b7xxu \u2212 \u03be2xxx = 0. (23)\nSolving the system of equations given in (23), one secures\n\u03be1 = a(t), \u03be2 = e(t) + 1 3\nxa\u2032(t), \u03b7 = g(t, x) + u ( h(t) + a\u2032(t)\n3\n) , (24a)\nQ(t)ungx + a\u2032(t)u + S(t)u2ngx + g + gt + gxxx + u (\nh\u2032 + 1 3\na\u2032\u2032 ) = 0, (24b)\nnQ(t)un\u22121g(t, x) + 2nS(t)u2n\u22121g(t, x)\u2212 e\u2032 \u2212 1 3 xa\u2032\u2032\n+ ( Q\u2032a(t) +\n1 3 nQ(t)a\u2032 + 2 3\nQ(t)a\u2032 + nh(t)Q(t) ) un\n+ ( S\u2032a(t) +\n2 3 nS(t)a\u2032 + 2 3\nS(t)a\u2032 + 2nh(t)S(t) ) u2n = 0, (24c)\nwith arbitrary functions a(t), g(t, x), h(t) and e(t) depending on their arguments. In a bid to achieve the principal Lie algebra admitted by any equation of class (16) we solve Equation (24) for arbitrary functions Q and S. The calculation results in \u03be1 = \u03b7 = 0 together with \u03be2 = constant. Consequently, the principal Lie algebra comprises one space translation symmetry, presented as:\nX1 = \u2202\n\u2202x . (25)\n2.4.2. Principal Lie Algebra of (3) with H(t) = 0\nWe utilize (22) denoted by V with the appropriate prolongation on (21) and by following the steps taken in Section 2.4.1, we gain the required system of equations in this case as:\n\u03be1 = \u03d1(t), \u03be2 = c(t) + 1 3\nx\u03d1\u2032(t), \u03b7 = e(t, x) + u ( p(t) + \u03d1\u2032(t)\n3\n) , (26a)\nQ(t)unex + S(t)u2nex + et + exxx + u (\np\u2032(t) + 1 3\n\u03d1\u2032\u2032(t) ) = 0, (26b)\nnQ(t)un\u22121e(t, x) + 2nS(t)u2n\u22121e(t, x)\u2212 c\u2032(t)\u2212 1 3 x\u03d1\u2032\u2032(t)\n+ ( Q\u2032(t)\u03d1(t) +\n1 3 nQ(t)\u03d1\u2032(t) + 2 3\nQ(t)\u03d1\u2032(t) + np(t)Q(t) ) un (26c)\n+ ( S\u2032(t)\u03d1(t) +\n2 3 nS(t)\u03d1\u2032(t) + 2 3\nS(t)\u03d1\u2032(t) + 2np(t)S(t) ) u2n = 0.\nwhere functions \u03d1(t), e(t, x), p(t) and c(t) are arbitrary, depending on their respective variables. Therefore, on taking Q(t) together with S(t) as arbitrary and solving system (26), we secure the values of \u03be1 = 0, \u03b7 = 0 and \u03be2 = A0, where A0 is an arbitrary constant. Consequently, the principal Lie algebra admitted by any equation of class (17) in this regard is obtained also as:\nV1 = \u2202\n\u2202x . (27)\n2.5. Proper Lie Group Classifications of Functions\nThis subsection furnishes the Lie group classification of Equations (16) as well as (21).\n2.5.1. Lie Group Classification of (3), H(t) 6= 0 We perform the analysis of (24b) and (24c) which gives six cases listed as follows: Case 1a Q(t) = A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)ent, S(t) = B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2nt where n 6= 0, 1 and A, B, \u03b1, \u03b2 are all constants.\nIn this case the principal Lie algebra of (3) is extended by one operator, viz.,\nX2 = 3(t + \u03b2) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202\n\u2202x \u2212 3u\n( t\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 1\n3\n) \u2202\n\u2202u . (28)\nCase 2a Q(t) = Ae\u2212\u03bbnt, S(t) = Be\u22122\u03bbnt, with A, B, \u03bb constants Here, the principal Lie algebra is extended by an operator calculated as:\nX2 = un \u2202\n\u2202t + \u03bbun+1\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (29)\nCase 3a Q(t) = 0, S(t) = 0 The principal Lie algebra extends by three Lie point symmetries, which are:\nX2 = \u2202\n\u2202t ,\nX3 = 3t \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202 \u2202x \u2212 3tu \u2202 \u2202u ,\nX4 = u \u2202\n\u2202u ,\nwith one infinite-dimensional subalgebra generated by:\nXg = g(t, x) \u2202\n\u2202u , (30)\nwhere g(t, x) satisfies g + gt + gxxx = 0. Thus, we give the commutator table associated with operators X1, . . . , X4 in Table 2.\nwith n = 1 and \u03b1 = \u03b2 6= \u22121/3, A, B, \u03b1, \u03b2, constants. We have the extension of the principal Lie algebra in this case given by:\nX2 = 3(t + \u03b2) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202 \u2202x \u2212 (3t\u2212 3\u03b1\u2212 1)u \u2202 \u2202u . (31)\n4.1a Q(t) = A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b2\u2212 2 3 et, S(t) = B(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 (3\u03b2+1)e2t The extension of principal Lie algebra occasioned by 4.1a leads to the operator\nX2 = 3(t + \u03b2) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202\n\u2202x + 3tu\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (32)\n4.2a Q(t) = A(t\u2212 13 ) \u2212\u03b1\u2212 23 et, S(t) = B(t\u2212 13 ) \u2212 23 (3\u03b1+1)e2t\nThe principal Lie algebra for subcase 4.2a extends by operators listed as:\nX2 = (1\u2212 3t) \u2202 \u2202t \u2212 x \u2202 \u2202x + 3tu \u2202 \u2202u , X3 = (1\u2212 3t) \u2202\n\u2202t \u2212 x \u2202 \u2202x + (1 + 3t)u \u2202 \u2202u ,\nX4 = (\n3t\u2212 1 3\u03b1 + 1\n) \u2202\n\u2202t +\n( x\n3\u03b1 + 1\n) \u2202 \u2202x \u2212 ( 3t\u2212 3\u03b1\u2212 1 3\u03b1 + 1 ) u \u2202 \u2202u .\nCase 5a Q(t) = Ae\u2212\u03b8t + 2B\u03c3\u03b8 e \u22122\u03b8t, S(t) = Be\u22122\u03b8t, with constants A, B, \u03c3, \u03b8. The principal Lie algebra in this case is extended by three operators given as:\nX2 = \u2202 \u2202t \u2212 u \u2202 \u2202u , X3 = \u2202\n\u2202t + \u03b8u\n\u2202\n\u2202u ,\nX4 = (2\u2212 6t) \u2202\n\u2202t + ( A2t B \u2212 2x ) \u2202 \u2202x + ( Ae\u2212t B + 6tu ) \u2202 \u2202u .\n5.1a Q(t) = A\u2212 2B\u03c3t, S(t) = B The principal Lie algebra extends by the time translation symmetry\nX2 = \u2202\n\u2202t .\nCase 6a Q(t) = A(t + \u03b2)\u2212\u03b2\u22122et, S(t) = B(t + \u03b2)\u2212 1 3 (6\u03b2+10)e2t,\nwith n = 1 alongside \u03b2 6= 0,\u22121,\u22124/3, A, B, \u03b2 constants. This case extends the principal Lie algebra of (3) by the operator\nX2 = 3(t + \u03b2) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202 \u2202x \u2212 (3t\u2212 4)u \u2202 \u2202u .

(38)\nCase 3b Q(t) = S(t) = 0 The principal Lie algebra is extended by four Lie point symmetries\nV2 = \u2202\n\u2202t ,\nV3 = 3t \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202\n\u2202x ,\nV4 = u \u2202\n\u2202u ,\nVe = e(t, x) \u2202\n\u2202u ,\nwhere function e(t, x) in Ve satisfies partial differential equation et + exxx = 0.

Symmetry Reductions and Group-Invariant Solutions\nWe seek symmetry reductions and by extension, the group-invariant solutions for two particular cases of Equation (16) as well as Equation (21) in this subsection. In a bid to achieve symmetry reductions along with group-invariant solutions of those cases, one has to solve the corresponding Lagrange system usually presented as:\ndt \u03be1(t, x, u) = dx \u03be2(t, x, u) = du \u03b7(t, x, u) .\nCase (ia) Q(t) = A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)ent, S(t) = B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2nt In this case Equation (16) becomes\nut + A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)entunux + B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2ntu2nux + u + uxxx = 0. (41)\nWe now seek group-invariant solution of this equation under symmetry given as:\nX2 = 3(t + \u03b2) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202\n\u2202x \u2212 3u\n( t\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 1\n3\n) \u2202\n\u2202u . (42)\nThus, two invariants are secured from the solutions of the related Lagrange system, which are given by:\nJ1 = x 3 \u221a \u03b2 + t , J2 = u(t + \u03b2)\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u22121/3et. (43)\nConsequently, the group-invariant solution obtained in this instance gives us\nu = e\u2212t(t + \u03b2)\u03b1+\u03b2+1/3U(z), z = x(t + \u03b2)\u22121/3,\nwhere function U(z) satisfies nonlinear ordinary differential Equation (NLODE)\n3BU\u2032(z)U2n(z)\u2212 zU\u2032(z) + 3AU\u2032(z)Un(z) + 3\u03b1U(z) + 3\u03b2U(z) + U(z) + 3U\u2032\u2032\u2032(z) = 0.\nCase (iia) Q(t) = Ae\u2212\u03bbnt, S(t) = Be\u22122\u03bbnt In this case Equation (16) now gives the form\nut + Ae\u2212\u03bbntunux + Be\u22122\u03bbntu2nux + u + uxxx = 0. (44)\nWe secure group-invariant solutions of this equation by engaging the operator\nX2 = un \u2202\n\u2202t + \u03bbun+1\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (45)\nThis operator X2 possess two invariants which are furnished as: J1 = x and J2 = ue\u2212\u03bbt and as a result, the group-invariant solution gives us expression of u as\nu = e\u03bbtU(x),\nThus, Equation (16) is transformed under the above solution to third-order NLODE\nAU\u2032(x)Un(x) + BU\u2032(x)U2n(x) + \u03bbU(x) + U(x) + U\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = 0.\nIn the same vein, we engage the obtained functions of Q(t) and S(t) to reduce (21). Case (ib) Q(t) = A(\u03c6 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b8n+n+2), S(t) = B(\u03c6 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b8n\u2212n\u22121) Invoking the expressions of Q(t) and S(t) in this regard makes (17) become\nut + A(\u03c6 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b8n+n+2)unux + B(\u03c6 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b8n\u2212n\u22121)u2nux + uxxx = 0. (46)\nWe utilize the symmetry of the equation to gain its group-invariant solution,viz:\nV2 = 3(t + \u03c6) \u2202\n\u2202t + x\n\u2202\n\u2202x + (3\u03b8 + 1)u\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (47)\nTherefore, solution to the related characteristic equations of V2 gives group-invariant\nI1 = x 3 \u221a \u03c6 + t , I2 = u(t + \u03c6)\u2212\u03b8\u22121/3. (48)\nHence, the group-invariant solution obtained in this regard gives us\nu = (t + \u03c6)\u03b8+1/3U(z), z = x(t + \u03c6)\u22121/3,\nwhere function U(z) is a solution of nonlinear differential equation obtained as:\n3BU\u2032(z)U2n(z)\u2212 zU\u2032(z) + 3AU\u2032(z)Un(z) + 3\u03b8U(z) + U(z) + 3U\u2032\u2032\u2032(z) = 0.\nCase (iib) Q(t) = Ae\u2212\u03c6nt, S(t) = Be\u22122\u03c6nt, In this final case, using Q(t) alongside S(t) Equation (21) eventually becomes\nut + Ae\u2212\u03c6ntunux + Be\u22122\u03c6ntu2nux + uxxx = 0. (49)\nWe look for the group-invariant solutions of this equation by employing the operator\nX2 = \u2202\n\u2202t + \u03c6u\n\u2202\n\u2202u . (50)\nThe obtained operator V2 reveals two invariants given as: I1 = x as well as I2 = ue\u2212\u03c6t and eventually the group-invariant solution is recovered as\nu = e\u03c6tU(x).\nOn utilizing the achieved solution in (21), we secure the NLODE\nAU\u2032(x)Un(x) + BU\u2032(x)U2n(x) + \u03c6U(x) + U\u2032\u2032\u2032(x) = 0.\n2.7. Exact Solutions of (21) Using F-Expansion Technique\nWe begin our quest of securing exact solutions of (21) by setting travelling wave transformation as:\nu(t, x) = \u03c6(z), z = k0x\u2212 \u03bdt (51)\nLetting Q(t) = \u03b1 and S(t) = \u03b2 and reckoning travelling wave (51), (21) becomes\n\u03b1k0\u03c6n(z)\u03c6\u2032(z) + \u03b2k0\u03c62n(z)\u03c6\u2032(z) + k30\u03c6 \u2032\u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u03bd\u03c6\u2032(z) = 0 (52)\nIntegration of (52) once and taking the constant of integration as zero, one gains\n\u03b1k0 n + 1 \u03c6n+1(z) + \u03b2k0 2n + 1 \u03c62n+1(z) + k30\u03c6 \u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u03bd\u03c6(z) = 0, (53)\nwhere n 6= \u22121,\u22121/2. Utilizing the transformation \u03c8(z) = \u03c6n(z), (53) reduces to\n\u03c8(z)\u03c8\u2032\u2032(z) + \u03b10\u03c8(z)2 + \u03b11\u03c83(z) + \u03b12\u03c84(z) + \u03b13\u03c8\u2032(z)2 = 0, (54)\nsee [3] where we have the representations\n\u03b10 = \u2212\u03bdn\nk30 , \u03b11 = \u03b1n k20(n + 1) , \u03b12 = \u03b2n k20(2n + 1) , \u03b13 = 1\u2212 n n ,\nwith forbidden values of n as 0, 1. The next step involves engaging the F-expansion technique [47]. Thus, using the standard procedure, we seek the solution in form of\n\u03c8(z) = N\n\u2211 k=0\nckQk(z), (55)\nwhere we have function Q(z) satisfying the auxiliary equation given as\ndQ dz\n= [ a0 + a1Q(z) + a2Q2(z) + a3Q3(z) + a4Q4(z) ]1/2 . (56)\nThe coefficients ci, aj (j = 0, 1 . . . , 4) are to be decided later. Integer N is obtained via the balancing procedure [3] and in consequence, N = 1, therefore (55) becomes\n\u03c8(z) = c0 + c1Q(z). (57)\nOn inserting (57) in conjunction with (56) into (54) and splitting on Q(z) gives\nc0c1a1 + 2\u03b10c20 + 2\u03b11c 3 0 + 2\u03b12c 4 0 + 2sc 2 1a0 = 0, 2c0c1a2 + c21a1 + 4\u03b10c0c1 + 6\u03b11c 2 0c1 + 8\u03b12c 3 0c1 + 2\u03b13c 2 1a1 = 0, 2c21a2 + 3c0c1a3 + 2\u03b10c 2 1 + 6\u03b11c0c 2 1 + 12\u03b12c 2 0c 2 1 + 2\u03b13c 2 1a2 = 0, (58) 4c0c1a4 + 3c21a3 + 2\u03b11c 3 1 + 8\u03b12c0c 3 1 + 2\u03b13c 2 1a3 = 0, 2c21a4 + \u03b12c 4 1 + \u03b13c 2 1a4 = 0.\nOn solving the system of five algebraic equations, we secure the values given as:\n\u03b10 = \u2212 1 c21\n( 6\u03b13c20a4 \u2212 3\u03b13c0c1a3 + \u03b13c21a2 + 6c20a4 \u2212 3c0c1a3 + c21a2 ) ,\n\u03b11 = 1\n2c21 (8\u03b13c0a4 \u2212 2\u03b13c1a3 + 12c0a4 \u2212 3c1a3), a0 = c20 c41\n( 3c20a4 \u2212 2c0c1a3 + c21a2 ) ,\na1 = c0 c31\n( 4c20a4 \u2212 3c0c1a3 + 2c21a2 ) , \u03b12 = \u2212\na4 c21 (\u03b13 + 2), (59)\nTherefore we achieve some solutions of (21) with regards to hyperbolic and elementary trigonometry functions with some criteria, see [47,48], as we have them in the succeeding part of the study. Triangular periodic solutions Case 1. When a0 = 0, a2 < 0, a1 = a3 = 0, a4 > 0, we have two triangular periodic solutions satisfying Equation (21). The solutions are:\nun,1(t, x) =\n{ k20(n + 1)(n + 2)\n\u03b1n\n( 1 + \u221a \u2212 a2 na4 sec [\u221a \u2212a2(k0x\u2212 \u03bdt) ])} 1n , (60)\nun,2(t, x) =\n{ k20(n + 1)(n + 2)\n\u03b1n\n( 1 + \u221a \u2212 a2 na4 csc [\u221a \u2212a2(k0x\u2212 \u03bdt) ])} 1n . (61)\nCase 2. When a0 = a22/4a4, a2 > 0, a1 = a3 = 0, a4 > 0, we have periodic solution\nun,3(t, x) =\n{ k20(n + 1)(n + 2)\n2\u03b1n\n( 2 + \u221a 2a2 na4 tan [\u221a a2 2 (k0x\u2212 \u03bdt) ])} 1n .

When a0 = 0, a2 > 0, a1 = a3 = 0, a4 > 0, we have a singular soliton\nun,5(t, x) =\n{ k20(n + 1)(n + 2)\n\u03b1n\n(\u221a a2\nna4 csch [\n\u221a a2(k0x\u2212 \u03bdt)] + 1 )} 1n (64)\nCase 5. When a0 = a22/4a4, a2 < 0, a1 = a3 = 0, a4 > 0, (16) has a kink soliton\nun,6(t, x) =\n{ k20(n + 1)(n + 2)\n2\u03b1n\n(\u221a \u2212 2a2\nna4 tanh\n[\u221a \u2212a2(k0x\u2212 \u03bdt)\u221a\n2\n] + 2 )} 1 n . (65)\nFurther, we group the solution of system (58) when a0 = a1 = 0 and a1 = a3 = 0 into two families.

We generate its Lie point symmetries with special cases of the variable coefficients after which reductions is done using the symmetries.

            "text": "Group classification, to a great extent, simplifies the problem which is associated with the determination of all invariant solutions. For a given PDEQ, two invariant solutions are said to be equivalent if one can possibly be mapped to the other through a point symmetry of the PDEQ [49]. It is only pertinent to secure one (general) invariant solution from each class; consequently, the entire class can then be constructed via the application of the symmetries. The equivalence relation expressed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are involving symmetry generators, rather than solutions of any particular DEQ. Once the generators have been classified for a particular Lie algebra, then the classification applies to every\nDEQ with that Lie algebra, irrespective of the type of DEQ, whether it is a PDEQ or an ordinary differential Equation (ODEQ). Further, if every possible Lie algebra is known as the case may be, one could then possibly solve the classification problem irrevocably. The problem(s) related to the identification of all possible Lie algebras has/have been solved for scalar ODEQs, but not for PDEQs or systems of ODEQs [14,49]. In consequence, using the equivalence relations expounded in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 with nonlinear higher-order prolongation, group classifications of Equation (3) were copiously examined leading to the space x-translation symmetry as the kernel algebra in each case. Thus, further extensions of the achieved Lie algebra produce as it were, exponential, logarithmic, power along with linear functions of the resulting equations. This occasions the performance of symmetry reductions for some specific cases of the found result from which invariant solutions are obtained. The reduction process (inclusive of the use of travelling waves) also results in various NLODEs with the cases where n = m and n 6= m. Moreover, in order to achieve robust and more self-consistent presentations, we include the commutation relations of the given Lie algebras. These commutator relations revealed a skew-symmetric property as exhibited in Tables 1\u20133."

Numerical simulation of these solutions occasioned the depiction of triangular periodic solutions (60)\u2013(62) in Figures 1\u20133, respectively.

The parametric values used in plotting the Figures are, respectively, a2 = 1, a3 = 1, a4 = \u22121, n = 1, c1 = 5, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 and \u22123 \u2264 t, x \u2264 3 with a2 = 1, a3 = 7, a4 = \u22121, n = 1, c1 = 5, k0 = 4, \u03bd = 1 alongside \u22123 \u2264 t, x \u2264 3. We depict merged soliton solution (68) with anti-bell shaped wave in Figure 10 via 3D, density and 2D plots using constant values a2 = 6, a3 = 8, a4 = 1, n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 with variables t and x in the interval \u22124 \u2264 t, x \u2264 4. The bell-shaped wave structure in Figure 11 reveals the dynamical character of combined soliton solution of (21) in (69) where we implore the\nvalues a2 = 6, a3 = 8, a4 = 1, n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 and\u22124 \u2264 t, x \u2264 4. Furthermore, 3D plot, 2D plot and density plot in Figure 12 shows the influence of (70) by engaging constant values a2 = 1, a3 = 3, a4 = 1, n = 1, c1 = 1, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 alongside variables \u22121 \u2264 t, x \u2264 1. The dynamical wave behaviour of soliton solution (71) is exhibited.\nin Figure 13 with parameters a2 = 1, a3 = 4, a4 = 1, n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 where t and x exist in interval \u22122 \u2264 t, x \u2264 2. We notice that (70) and (71) both reveal singularities in the domain 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2. Now, we depict the Jacobi elliptic solutions obtained for Equation (21) using Figures in two and three dimensions alongside density plots. Elliptic solutions (74) and (75) are depicted in Figures 14 and 15 accordingly using parametric values n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 0.6, \u03bd = 7 with \u22123 \u2264 t, x \u2264 3 as well as n = 2, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 0.5, \u03bd = 4 with \u22122.5 \u2264 t, x \u2264 2.5. We also reveal the motions behaviour of (82) with Figures 16 and 17 where we invoke, respectively, n = 2, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 1 whereas \u22123 \u2264 t, x \u2264 3 and n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 2, \u03bd = 3 along with t and x in the same interval. It is observed that when n = 1, we have a sinusoidal wave structure with the wave travelling with uniform frequency and amplitude whereas at n = 2 the solution gives a combined dark and bright soliton wave structure behaving in similar manner. In addition to that, Figures 15 and 17 reveal W-shaped soliton wave structures through the 2D plots. Moreover, periodic soliton solution (84) reveals a constant amplitude and frequency in its wave propagation as depicted in Figure 18 using parametric values n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1.1, \u03bd = 1.1 and variables \u22128 \u2264 t, x \u2264 8. Finally, we exhibit the character of elliptic solution (89) in Figure 19 with constant values n = 1, \u03b2 = \u22121, k0 = 1, \u03bd = 3 where we have \u22127 \u2264 t, x \u2264 7. The three-dimensional plot shows a multi-soliton wave structure of the solution.\nObservations We specifically noticed that the wave profiles in Figures 4 and 7 give a pulse-compacton\nand a kink-compacton wave structures, respectively, while profiles in Figures 8 and 9 exhibit partial pulse-compactons. Compacton is defined as a robust and strictly localized nonlinear wave which unlike soliton (a solitary wave that asymptotically retains its shape together with velocity upon collision with another solitary wave) is characterized by the absence of infinitesimal wings extending to infinity [50]. It also has a profile or spatial width that is independent of its velocity. A crucial building block for the existence of compactons is nonlinear dispersion. These can as well be generated in a continuum system dependent on the interplay between dispersive and nonlinear phenomena. On the other hand, wave profiles in Figures 5, 10 and 11 reveal pulse-soliton wave structures.\nSolitons and Classical Solutions in Quantum Field Theory\nSoliton theory is an essential branch of applied mathematics as well as mathematical physics. It is a highly active and productive field of research and also has important applications in diverse fields of science, such as fluid mechanics, nonlinear optics, classical and quantum fields theories. Solitons are solutions of classical field equations which possess particle-like attributes. In addition to that, they are localized in space and have finite energy. They are also stable against decay into radiation. They further give rise to new particle states in the underlying quantum field theory, after quantization, which is not seen in perturbation theory. The stability property possessed by solitons usually has a topological explanation. Given a classical field theory, in a bid to \u201cquantize\u201d it, the vacuum of the theory will be found and then perturbation theory around this vacuum are done. Suppose there are multiple vacua, then an arbitrary vacuum is picked and expansion is done around it. However, these fields theories possessing multiple vacua often contain soliton solutions. In addition, these solutions are localized smooth solutions of classical field equations which connect multiple vacuums. This process in the case of kink soliton solution is known as\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. Of course, by virtue of symmetry, one obtains the same quantum theory regardless of which vacuum one expands around where the kink stability comes from the topology. In order to quantize these solitons solutions, one fixes such a soliton and thereafter utilizes it as the \u201cbackground\u201d. In consequence, one then invokes perturbation theory around these solutions, although this is quite tricky to do. Hence, in a lot of courses, physicists just examine the classical part of the theory. It is to recall that when quantizing field theories in perturbation theory, one obtains particles in the sense of quantum theory, despite the classical theory being completely about fields. It turns out that solitons also act just like particles which are a new type of particles. These are referred to as non-perturbative phenomenon. If one actually wants to do the quantum field theory properly, then the inclusion of these solitons in the quantum field theory is needed. Therefore, in diverse cases, one discovers that classical field equations possess solutions that suggest a particle interpretation. They are localized with the concentration of their energy density within a fairly well-defined region of space. Outside this region, the involved fields quickly approach their vacuum values. These solutions are found out to be stable and sustain their structure as time goes on. Moreover, they can be enhanced to yield linearly moving solutions. These are seen to carry linear momentum and also display the proper relationship between energy, mass as well as momentum. The existent of soliton called objects depends essentially on the nonlinear manner of the field equations. This in turn is revealed in their non-analytic character as the coupling constants of the theory approach zero. Precisely, the soliton mass typically diverges in this limit, thus acting as an inverse of a coupling constant. Second class solutions called the nontopological solitons are in the same vein stabilized by a conserved charge carried by the soliton. Nonetheless, in this regard, the charge is of the same kind as that carried by the elementary particles of the theory. In order to make stable soliton exist, one must ensure that mass to charge ratio must be small enough to restrain decay by emission of these elementary charged particles. Thus, for the afore-discussed solutions, the quantum interpretation is a straightforward extension of the classical meaning [51]. Another important area of study is the application of solitons to describe nonperturbative phenomena in quantum field theory. In the case of the effect of multi-solitons in quantum field theory, It has been revealed that one would not ordinarily expect to get static solutions that delineate spatially separated solitons, due to the fact that, at any finite distance there would be nonzero inter-soliton forces. A static multisoliton solution would need a remarkable cancellation existent between the attractive as well as the repulsive forces that are prevalent. Nevertheless, the exact proportionality between energy alongside the topological charge of Bogomolny-type first-order differential Equation (BPS) solutions suggests that just such a cancellation might take place. In fact, we have seen that in the BPS monopole the Higgs field has a certain tail that corresponds to a long-range attractive force which possesses the potential to exactly nullify the magnetic repulsion [52]. We are aware that the solutions constructed comprises, elliptic wave solutions (whose special limits yield hyperbolic and elementary trigonometric functions), periodic, hyperbolic as well as trigonometric functions with various applications in theoretical physics. The benefit of such functions is that the wave\u2019s physical behaviour can be effortlessly commented on, irrespective of the graph\u2019s range which the resulting solution function owns. Mathematical functions such as trigonometric, as well as hyperbolic, arise in physical sciences. Example of this is the case of hyperbolic cosine functions that possesses the shape of a catenary which by extension is applied in delineating satellite rings\u2019 formed around planets. Furthermore, they are also applicable in the theory of special relativity. Besides, in quantum physics, tan-hyperbolic functions emerge in calculating the rapidity of special relativity and magnetic moment. In the laminar jet\u2019s profile, secant hyperbolic functions appear. Moreover, in Langevin function for polarization of magnets, cotangent hyperbolic functions come to fore [53]. Furthermore, a classical solution is a function that solves a given partial differential equation in the usual sense. For instance, for unidirectional wave equation given as\nut + ux = 0, any function of the structure u(t, x) = f (t\u2212 x) where f is twice differentiable is a classical solution of the wave equation. Consequently, classical solutions such as are secured in this study play an important role in quantum field theory, high energy physics and cosmology. Real-time soliton solutions give rise to the emergence of particles which include magnetic monopoles as well as extended structures, such as domain walls and cosmic strings. These in turn have implications for early universe cosmology. Besides, imaginary-time Euclidean instantons are responsible for important nonperturbative effects whereas Euclidean bounce solutions govern transitions between metastable states."

            "text": "In this section, we compute the conservation laws of Equation (3) for various cases including when function H(t) 6= 0 and when H(t) = 0, using both the direct approach and Noether\u2019s theorem where applicable.\n6.1. Conserved Currents of Equation (3) When n = m\nWe seek the multipliers of (3) here with a view to using them to construct the conserved currents of the equation when n = m.\n6.1.1. Application of Direct Technique\nWe construct the conserved currents of (16) first for two cases of Q(t) and S(t) using the direct approach [54].\nCase 1A Q(t) = A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)ent, S(t) = B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2nt. In this case, we insert the expressions for Q(t) and S(t) in (16) and then we have:\nut + A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)entunux + B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2ntu2nux\n+ u + uxxx = 0. (95)\nWe commence the application of the technique by using the zeroth order multiplier \u039b = \u039b(t, x, u) in the required equation expressed in this regard simply as:{\n\u2202\n\u2202u \u2212 Dt\n\u2202\n\u2202ut \u2212 Dx\n\u2202\n\u2202ux \u2212 Dt\n\u2202\n\u2202ut \u2212 D3x\n\u2202\n\u2202uxxx\n}[ \u039b ( ut + A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)\n\u00d7 entunux + B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)e2ntu2nux + u + uxxx )] = 0. (96)\nFurther expansion of (96), splitting the outcome on diverse included derivatives of u and further simplifying the obtained equations yields the system of equations\n\u039bux = 0, \u039buu = 0, (t + \u03b2)2\u03b1n+2\u03b2n+2/3u\u039bu + (t + \u03b2)2\u03b1n+2\u03b2n+2/3\u039b \u2212 (t + \u03b2)2\u03b1n+2\u03b2n+2/3\u039bt \u2212 A(t + \u03b2)\u03b1n+2\u03b2n\u2212n/3+2/3unent\u039bx \u2212 B(t + \u03b2)\u22122n/3u2ne2nt\u039bx \u2212 (t + \u03b2)2\u03b1n+2\u03b2n+2/3\u039bxxx = 0. (97)\nSolving the three system of equations gives the value of \u039b(t, x, u) as:\n\u039b(t, x, u) = C1e2tu + C2et, (98)\nwhere C1 and C2 are constants. Next, to gain the conserved currents of Equation (95), we have to engage the divergence relation which we present in this regard as:\nDtT + DxX = [ ut + A(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 1 3 (3\u03b1n+3\u03b2n+n+2)entunux + B(\u03b2 + t) 2 3 (\u22123\u03b1n\u22123\u03b2n\u2212n\u22121)\n\u00d7 e2ntu2nux + u + uxxx ] \u039b(t, x, u), (99)\nwhere the conserved currents (Ti, Xi), i = 1, 2 are computed. Thus, from (99), a quite lengthy calculations would give the general case for the conserved currents as:\nT = 1 2\nuet ( C1etu + 2C2 ) ,\nX = 1\n2(n + 1)(n + 2)(2n + 1)\n{ 4e2tn3uuxxC1 \u2212 2e2tn3u2xC1 + 14e2tn2uuxxC1\n+ 4Aet(n+2)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 un+2n2C1 + 2Be2t(n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3\n\u00d7 u2n+2n2C1 \u2212 7e2tn2u2xC1 + 14e2tnuuxxC1 + 4etn3uxxC2 + 6Aet(n+2) \u00d7 (\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 un+2nC1 + 5Be2t(n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3 u2n+2nC1 \u2212 7e2tnu2xC1 + 4C1e2tuuxx + 14etn2uxxC2 + 2Aet(n+2)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 \u00d7 C1un+2 + 4Aet(n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 un+1n2C2 + 2Be2t(n+1) \u00d7 (\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3 C1u2n+2 + 2Bet(2n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3 u2n+1 \u00d7 n2C2 \u2212 2C1e2tu2x + 14etnuxxC2 + 10Aet(n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 un+1nC2 \u00d7+6Bet(2n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3 u2n+1nC2 + 4etuxxC2 + 4Aet(n+1)\n\u00d7 (\u03b2 + t)\u2212\u03b1n\u2212\u03b2n\u2212 1 3 n\u2212 2 3 C2un+1 + 4Bet(2n+1)(\u03b2 + t)\u2212 2 3 n\u22122\u03b1n\u22122\u03b2n\u2212 2 3 C2u2n+1 } , (100)\nwhere n 6= \u22122,\u22121,\u22121/2.

(106)\nNow, following the procedure taken in Equations (103)\u2013(105), we gain two multipliers \u039b1 = u and \u039b2 = 1, thus, we consequently gain vectors presented as:\nT1 = 1 2 u2, X1 = 1\n2(2n + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 2Bn2u2n+2 + 5Bnu2n+2 + 2Aun+2e\u03c6nt \u2212 2n3u2xe2\u03c6nt\n\u2212 7n2u2xe2\u03c6nt \u2212 7nu2xe2\u03c6nt + 4uuxxe2\u03c6nt + 2Bu2n+2 \u2212 2e2\u03c6ntu2x + 14e2\u03c6ntnuuxx + 4e2\u03c6ntn3uuxx + 14n2e2\u03c6ntuuxx + 6Ae\u03c6ntnun+2 + 4Ae\u03c6ntn2un+2 } ;\nT2 = u,\nX2 = 1\n(2n + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 2e2\u03c6ntn3uxx + 2Ae\u03c6ntn2un+1 + 7n2e2\u03c6ntuxx + 2uxx\n+ 5Ae\u03c6ntnun+1 + Bn2u2n+1 + 7e2\u03c6ntnuxx + 2Ae\u03c6ntun+1 + 3Bnu2n+1 + 2Be\u22122\u03c6ntu2n+1 } .\nMoreover, we state here that remark (3) also applies in the case of (T2, X2).\n6.2. Conserved Currents of Equation (3) When n 6= m Conserved Currents of (3) via Homotopy Formula\nThis subsubsection seeks to derive the conserved currents of Equations (16) and (21) when n 6= m via their various multipliers using the homotopy formula. On adopting the procedure outlined in Section 6.1, we secure the zeroth-order multiplier for Equations (16) and (21) for Q(t) = S(t) = 1, respectively, as:\n\u039b1(t, x, u) = A1u + A2, (107) \u039b2(t, x, u) = A1e2tu + A2et, (108)\nwhere A1 and A2 are constants. Therefore, we have multipliers \u039b1 and \u039b2 constituting the conservation laws. Thus, we have the proposition and succeeding theorems to this effect.\nProposition 1. All low-order multipliers (107) admitted by the underlying Equation (1+1)DgvcKdVDampe (17) with functions Q(t) = S(t) = H(t) = G(t) 6= 0 give rise to conservation\nlaws. The underlying multipliers are given by: (i) multipliers of (16) where arbitrary Q(t) = 1 = S(t) and n 6= m\n\u039b1a = u, (109)\n\u039b1b = 1. (110)\n(ii) multipliers of (21) with arbitrary Q(t) = S(t) = 1 and n 6= m:\n\u039b2a = e2tu, (111) \u039b2b = et. (112)\nTheorem 1. The conserved current admitted by Equation (1+1)D-gvcKdVDampe (3) for low-order multiplier \u039b1 with integer exponent n 6= m are presented as:\nCase 1a: n 6= \u22121,\u22122, m 6= \u22121/2,\u22121\nTt1a = 1 2 u2, Xx1a = 1\n2(2m + 1)(m + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 2u2m+2 \u2212 3mn2u2x + 8m2uuxx + 2n2uuxx\n+ 12muuxx + 6nuuxx \u2212 2m2n2u2x \u2212 6m2nu2x + 6mn2uuxx \u2212 9mnu2x \u2212 4m2u2x \u2212 n2u2x \u2212 6mu2x \u2212 3nu2x + 18nmuuxx + 4m2n2uuxx + 12m2nuuxx + 2un+2 \u2212 2u2x + 3nu2m+2 + 4mu2m+2 + 4uuxx + 2nun+2 + n2u2m+2 + 6mun+2\n+ 4m2un+2 + 2mn2u2m+2 + 6mnu2m+2 + 4m2nun+2 + 6mnun+2 } ;\nCase 1b: n 6= \u22121,\u22122, m 6= \u22121/2,\u22121\nTt1b = u, Xx1b = 1\n(2m + 1)(m + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 2u2m+1 + 2un+1 + 2uxx + nun+1 + 6mun+1\n+ 4m2uxx + n2uxx + 9mnuxx + mn2u2m+1 + 3mnu2m+1 + 2m2nun+1 + 3mnun+1 + 6muxx + 3nuxx + 2mu2m+1 + 3nu2m+1 + n2u2m+1 + 4m2un+1\n+ 2m2n2uxx + 6m2nuxx + 3mn2uxx } .\nMoreover, the corresponding conservation laws of (21) obtained via \u039b2 are: Case 2a: n 6= \u22121,\u22122, m 6= \u22121/2,\u22121\nTt2a = 1 2 e2tu2, Xx2a = e2t\n2(2m + 1)(m + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 8m2uuxx \u2212 2m2n2u2x \u2212 6m2nu2x\n\u2212 3mn2u2x + 2nun+2 \u2212 9mnu2x + 2n2uuxx + 12muuxx + 6nuuxx + 4m2nun+2 + 2mn2u2m+2 + 6mnun+2 + 6mnu2m+2 + 2u2m+2\n+ 4uuxx + 2un+2 \u2212 6mu2x \u2212 3nu2x + 4m2un+2 + n2u2m+2 + 3nu2m+2 \u2212 4m2u2x \u2212 n2u2x + 4mu2m+2 + 6mun+2 + 12m2nuuxx + 6mn2uuxx\n+ 18mnuuxx \u2212 2u2x + 4m2n2uuxx }\nCase 2b: n 6= \u22121,\u22122, m 6= \u22121/2,\u22121\nTt2b = e tu,\nXx2b = et\n(2m + 1)(m + 1)(n + 1)(n + 2)\n{ 2m2n2uxx + 2m2nun+1 + mn2u2m+1\n+ 6m2nuxx + 3mn2uxx + 4m2un+1 + 3mnun+1 + 3mnu2m+1 + n2u2m+1 + 4m2uxx + 9mnuxx + n2uxx + 6mun+1 + nun+1 + 2mu2m+1 + 3nu2m+1\n+ 6muxx + 3nuxx + 2un+1 + 2u2m+1 + 2uxx } .\nIt is noteworthy to state that remark (3) applies in the case of \u039b1b in (110).\nRemark 4. Having observed the conserved vectors achieved here, we notice interesting conservation laws with the existence of mass density as well as elastic energy density. Moreover, going by the multipliers obtained, momentum conservation law and conservation law of energy were also constructed.\n6.3. Application of Noether\u2019s Theorem\nThis subsection is dedicated to achieve the conserved currents of (3) for both cases of n = m and n 6= m when H(t) = 0 by utilizing the novel Noether\u2019s theorem [55].\n6.3.1. Noether Conserved Currents of (3) When n = m, H(t) = 0\nWe apply the classical Noether\u2019s theorem [55,56] to gain various nonlocal and local conserved vectors of (17). Equation (3) with or without the variable-coefficient has no Lagrangian. However, taking H(t) = 0, we recover a Lagrangian for the equation. We commence with the transformation u = vx with G(t) = 1, which makes (21) become a variable-coefficient partial differential equation in vs. as:\nvtx + Q(t)vnxvxx + S(t)v 2n x vxx + vxxxx = 0, (113)\nwith arbitrary Q(t) and S(t). We present a low-order differential Lagrangian of (113) in the Lemma given subsequently:\nLemma 1. The variable-coefficient (1+1)D-gKdVDampe (21) forms the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation with the functional\nJ(v) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 L(t, x, vt, vx, vxx)dtdx (114)\nwith conforming function of Lagrange L structured in a minimum differential order\nL = \u22121 2 vtvx \u2212 Q(t)vn+2x (n + 1)(n + 2) \u2212 S(t)v 2n+2 x (2n + 1)(2n + 2) + 1 2 v2xx. (115)\nThe proof of Lemma (1) is straightforward. We implore the invariant criteria\npr3W(L) + LDt\u03be1 + Dx\u03be2 = DtB1 + DxB2, (116)\nwith Dt, Dx as in (11) and the third prolongation of R attainable through relation\npr3W = W + \u03b6t \u2202\n\u2202vt + \u03b6x\n\u2202\n\u2202vx + \u03b6xx\n\u2202\n\u2202vxx . (117)\nIn addition, we define variational symmetries W as W = \u03be1\u2202/\u2202t + \u03be2\u2202/\u2202x + \u03b7\u2202/\u2202vs.. Observe that functions \u03be1, \u03be2, \u03b7, B1 as well as B2 in (116) are dependent on t, x and vs..\nPerforming Lie symmetry analysis procedure on invariance criteria (116) gives the system of linear partial differential equations (LPDEs) calculated as:\n\u03be1x = 0, \u03be 1 u = 0, \u03be 2 t = 0, \u03b7x = 0, B 2 x = 0, \u03be 2 u = 0, \u03b7t + 2B 2 u = 0, \u03be1u + B 1 u = 0, \u03b7uu = 0, 2\u03b7ux \u2212 \u03be2xx = 0, 2\u03b7u \u2212 3\u03be2x \u2212 \u03be1t \u2212 B1t = 0, n\u03be1u + \u03be 1 u + B 1 u = 0, 2n\u03be 1 u + \u03be 1 u + B 1 u = 0, B 1 t \u2212 2\u03b7u = 0, n\u03b7u + 2\u03b7u \u2212 n\u03be2x + \u03be1t \u2212 \u03be2x \u2212 B1t = 0, 2n\u03b7u + 2\u03b7u \u2212 2n\u03be2x + \u03be1t \u2212 \u03be2x \u2212 B1t = 0.\nSolving the system gives solutions for four cases of arbitrary Q(t) and S(t),viz: Case a. Q(t) = 0, S(t) 6= 0 In this case, the solution of the coefficient functions of the variational symmetry is\n\u03be1(t, x, v) = A1t + A2, \u03be2(t, x, v) = 1 3 A1x + A3, \u03b7(t, x, v) = n\u2212 1 3n A1vs. + f1(t), B1(t, x, v) = 2(n\u2212 1)\n3n A1t + f2(x), B2(t, x, v) = \u2212 1 2 f \u20321(t)vs. + f3(t),\nwith arbitrary constants A1, A2, A3 and functions f1(t) and f2(x) as well as f3(t), In consequence, we generate four Noether symmetries from the solution. They are:\nW1 = \u2202\n\u2202t , B1 = 0, B2 = 0,\nW2 = \u2202\n\u2202x , B1 = 0, B2 = 0,\nW3 = t \u2202\n\u2202t + 1 3 \u2202 \u2202x + n\u2212 1 3n vs. \u2202 \u2202v , B1 = 2(n\u2212 1) 3n t, B2 = 0,\nW4 = f1(t) \u2202 \u2202v , B1 = 0, B2 = \u22121 2 f \u20321(t)v.\nOn utilizing the Noether\u2019s theorem [55] in conjunction with (115) and the relation in [57], we gain the conserved current related to each of the Noether symmetries as:\nTt1 = 1 2 u2x \u2212 S(t) (2n + 1)(2n + 2) u2n+2,\nTx1 = 1 2\n(\u222b utdx )2 +\nS(t) 2n + 1\nu2n+1 \u222b utdx + uxx \u222b utdx\u2212 utux;\nTt2 = 1 2 u2 Tx2 = S(t)\n2n + 2 u2n+2 \u2212 1 2 u2x + uuxx,\nTt3 = 1 2 tu2x \u2212 S(t) (2n + 1)(2n + 2) tu2n+2 \u2212 (n\u2212 1) 6n u \u222b udx + 1 6 xu2 \u2212 2(n\u2212 1) 3n t,\nTx3 = S(t) 3(2n + 2) xu2n+2 \u2212 1 6 xu2x \u2212 (n\u2212 1) 6n\n\u222b udx \u222b utdx +\n1 2\nt (\u222b utdx )2\n+ S(t)\n2n + 1 tu2n+1\n\u222b utdx\u2212\n(n\u2212 1)S(t) 3n(2n + 1)\nu2n+1 \u222b\nudx\u2212 1 3n uux\n\u2212 (n\u2212 1) 3n\nuxx \u222b\nudx + 1 3\nxuuxx \u2212 tutux + tuxx \u222b utdx;\nTt4 = \u2212 1 2 u f (t), Tx4 = 1 2 f \u20321(t) \u222b udx\u2212 1 2 f1(t) \u222b utdx\u2212 S(t) 2n + 1 u2n+1 f (t)\u2212 uxx f (t).\nCase b. Q(t) 6= 0, S(t) = 0 This case furnishes the solution of \u03be1, \u03be2, \u03b7, B1 and B2 as\n\u03be1(t, x, v) = A1t + A2, \u03be2(t, x, v) = 1 3 A1x + A3, \u03b7(t, x, v) = n\u2212 2 3n A1vs. + f1(t), B1(t, x, v) = 2(n\u2212 2)\n3n A1t + f2(x), B2(t, x, v) = \u2212 1 2 f \u20321(t)vs. + f3(t).\nHence, we obtain four Noether symmetries from the solution.

            "text": "In this article, we investigated the generalized variable coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation with linear damping term in quantum field theory. Lie group classification of the equation was performed for two different cases. We achieved this by first determining the appropriate equivalence transformations for the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In addition, the transformations were then utilized in rescaling some arbitrary functions in the equation for further simplifications and studies. It was discovered that the resulting equation possesses its kernel algebra in space variable x. Extending the obtained Lie algebra, we gain logarithmic, power, exponential as well as linear functions. Moreover, we performed symmetry reductions for some cases of the obtained results and then found invariant solutions in each case. We examined various soliton solutions of a case of the underlying equation as well as their dynamical wave behaviours which were further analyzed. In the end, we constructed conserved quantities of the equation under consideration via the general multiplier technique using the direct and homotopy formula. Besides, Noether\u2019s theorem was engaged in securing more conserved currents containing both local and nonlocal conserved vectors with the first integral. Further to that, conservation laws of note are achieved as established in Remarks 3 and 4 where from study, we noticed that some of the conservation laws include mass, energy and momentum with some involving density of elastic energy and mass density. These conserved quantities are highly applicable in physical sciences.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.M.K. and O.D.A.; Methodology, C.M.K. and O.D.A.; Software, O.D.A.; Validation, C.M.K.; Writing\u2014Original Draft, O.D.A.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing, C.M.K.
