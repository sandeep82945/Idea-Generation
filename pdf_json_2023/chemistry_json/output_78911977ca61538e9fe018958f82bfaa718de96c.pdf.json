    "abstractText": "There is an urgent need to realize precise clinical ultrasound with ultrasound contrast agents that provide high echo intensity and mechanical index tolerance. Graphene derivatives possess exceptional characteristics, exhibiting great potential in fabricating ideal ultrasound contrast agents. Herein, we reported a facile and green approach to synthesizing reduced graphene oxide with ellagic acid (rGO-EA). To investigate the application of a graphene derivative in ultrasound contrast agents, rGO-EA was dispersed in saline solution and mixed with SonoVue (SV) to fabricate SV@rGO-EA microbubbles. To determine the properties of the product, analyses were performed, including ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and zeta potential analysis. Additionally, cell viability measurements and a hemolysis assay were conducted for a biosafety evaluation. SV@rGO-EA microbubbles were scanned at various mechanical index values to obtain the B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) mode images in vitro. SV@rGO-EA microbubbles were administered to SD rats, and their livers and kidneys were imaged in CEUS and B-mode. The absorption of rGO-EA resulted in an enhanced echo intensity and mechanical index tolerance of SV@rGO-EA, surpassing the performance of SV microbubbles both in vitro and in vivo. This work exhibited the application potential of graphene derivatives in the field of ultrasound precision medicine.",

            "text": "The past decades have witnessed enormous advancements in graphene research since the initial isolation of this two-dimensional miracle material. As an allotrope of carbon containing sp2-bonded atoms, graphene has impressive features, such as exceptional mechanical, electrical, optical and thermal characteristics. The ever-increasing interest in graphene-based materials has been focused on biomedical science in recent years. Additionally, inspirational research on graphene derivatives has been focused on wearable electronics, diagnostic tools, drug-delivery carriers and regenerative medicine materials [1\u20134]. However, ultrasound medical science gains little attention in graphene research.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7646. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227646 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nIn the ultrasound medical area, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an important imaging technique, specialized for acquiring sensitive blood flow and tissue perfusion information. Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs), the coated microbubbles that are stable in vivo, can be used to induce cavitation for diagnostic and therapeutic applications with suitably moderate ultrasound energy. This contributes to the development of accurate and subtle CEUS imaging. For decades, further contributions to enhanced cavitation effects and therapeutic delivery have witnessed the significance of UCA in molecular imaging and precise treatment [5,6]. The application of UCAs epitomizes real-time, highly safe and clearly visible merits in CEUS [7]. SonoVue (SV) is a UCA approved by the Food and Drug Administration for liver ultrasound (US) imaging [8]. SV microbubbles (MBs) with a lipid shell and a gas core provide the accurate dynamic detection of microcirculation, demonstrating the ability to transform a thermal process into a safer mechanical process by using microbubbles as actuators of acoustic forces [9]. Wang et al. fabricated cellulose nanocrystalline-modified SonoVue MBs, which improved the ultrasound imaging quality with a biologically renewable nanomaterial [10]. At a low mechanical index, steady-state cavitation mostly occurs in MBs, resulting in lasting enhancement. When a higher mechanical index is applied, the ultrasonic energy is sufficient to rupture smaller-sized MBs, leading to shorter acoustic enhancement [11]. Thus, there is still an urgent need for ideal UCAs that provide higher echo intensity and mechanical index (MI) tolerance. Green reducing agents, such as edible sunflower oil, lemon grass extracts and green tea extracts, can be employed for the eco-friendly synthesis of rGO [12\u201314]. Ellagic acid (EA), a non-toxic dietary polyphenol present in various fruits and nuts, possesses inherent abilities including antibacterial, anticancer, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [15\u201318]. In addition, EA may potentially serve as a green reducing agent. Phenolic hydroxyl groups in EA will be transformed to corresponding quinone forms during the reduction [19]. Meanwhile, non-covalent bond functionalization between rGO and EA is achieved through interactions such as hydrogen bonds and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 bonds. The green reducing compound works to stabilize and cap agents for the formation and stabilization of rGO [20]. In this work, we have explored the utilization of ellagic acid to develop a one-step, facile and eco-friendly approach for the preparation of rGO, avoiding expensive equipment, the need for a rigorous environment and the presence of toxic constituents inherent in conventional chemical synthesis [21]. Carbon nanomaterials are attracting great attraction in extensive fields [22]. With conditions of a rich stock in nature and considering the excellent inherent abilities of EA, the potential of the nano-scaled rGO-EA is promising. Moreover, the biosafety of the product has been evaluated through the cell viability assay and hemolysis assay. To our knowledge, few studies have explored the application of graphene in enhancing ultrasound diagnosis. This study aims to bridge the literature gap summarized above. We researched the combination of green-synthesized rGO-EA and SV for better contrast-enhancing effects and MI tolerance, and CEUS imaging quality was evaluated by acquiring and analyzing US imaging. Furthermore, rGO-EA-modified microbubbles can provide fundamental knowledge for the applications of graphene derivatives in ultrasonic diagnostic systems."

            "text": "As a natural polyphenol, ellagic acid exhibits reduction properties. The GO solution with EA underwent sonication and exhibited an initial brown coloration. Upon completion of the reaction, the solution turned a deep, dark hue. A series of characterizations was conducted to confirm the properties of the product. The reduction was monitored by measuring the position of the UV\u2013vis absorption peak (Figure 1a). The UV\u2013vis spectrum of GO exhibited a characteristic peak at 230 nm, corresponding to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition of aromatic C=C bonds in the aromatic ring [23]. Additionally, a shoulder peak at ~300 nm was observed, which could be attributed to\nn\u2192 \u03c0* transitions of C=O and C\u2013O groups present on graphene sheets [24]. As for rGO-EA, the absorption peak of primordial GO at 230 nm was eliminated, and the peak of graphene carbon skeleton red shifted to 276 nm, indicating the restoration of electronic bonding within the graphene sheets [25]. The reduction and the functionalization of rGO-EA were also investigated using FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 1b). The FTIR spectrum of GO exhibited a characteristic peak, 1728 cm\u22121, corresponding to the C=O stretching of carboxylic and/or carbonyl moiety functional groups, along with a peak at 1202 cm\u22121 associated with C\u2013O stretching vibrations. Additionally, the presence of unoxidized graphitic domains was evidenced by the peak observed at 1555 cm\u22121 due to the skeletal vibrations [25,26]. The FTIR curve confirmed the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups in GO. After the reduction of GO using ellagic acid, distinct IR peaks of rGO-EA were observed at 1364 and 553 cm\u22121, which were associated with the characteristic peaks of EA, suggesting that EA was successfully conjugated [26]. To confirm the structural changes, Raman spectroscopy was employed with the as-received GO and the composite rGO-EA. The Raman spectra of GO and rGO-EA in the spectral region of 1000\u20132000 cm\u22121 are presented in Figure 1c. Two fundamental vibrations were observed for the G band at 1584 cm\u22121 and the D band at 1348 cm\u22121, indicating the presence of amorphous carbon [22]. The D band corresponded to the A1g mode of k-point photons, and the G band in E2g mode was associated with the ordered sp2-bonded carbon atoms in rGO [27]. The intensity of the G band was found to be higher than that of the D band, and the ID/IG value for GO was determined to be 0.83. In contrast, rGO-EA exhibited distinct bands at 1336 and 1600 cm\u22121, corresponding to the D and G bands. The calculated ID/IG value for rGO-EA was 0.96, surpassing that of GO, indicating the functionalization of rGO [26]. The crystalline nature of GO and rGO-EA was confirmed using XRD, and their spectra are shown in Figure 1d. GO exhibited a characteristic carbon peak (001) at ~11.78\u25e6 [28]. As GO underwent reduction with EA, the peak at around 11.78\u25e6 decreased, indicating the successful removal of most oxygen functional groups and the effective reduction of GO [29]. A new peak emerged at approximately 20.09\u25e6. The typical diffraction peak of rGO nanosheets was observed at around 26.57\u25e6 for rGO-EA [30]. This result confirmed the restoration of the original graphite structure through reduction [29]. In addition, rGO-EA showed a distinct peak (002) at ~24.14\u25e6, which was in excellent agreement with the reported values for rGO [31].\nThe TGA method demonstrated high precision in examining the composition and thermal stability changes in composites. The TGA thermograms illustrating the characteristics of GO, EA and rGO-EA are presented in Figure 2a. The percentage of mass loss below 100 \u25e6C could be attributed to H2O evaporation, and the TGA measurement was employed to analyze the mass of adsorbed EA. Since EA was adsorbed due to the \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction between EA and rGO, the significant mass loss percentage shown in the TGA thermogram between 40 \u25e6C and 800 \u25e6C corresponded to the decomposition of EA. The mass losses for the GO were less than that for the rGO-EA, confirming that the EA was loaded onto the surface of GO. Zeta potential values of the aqueous dispersions of GO and rGO-EA are shown in Figure 2b. It was found that the zeta potential of the GO and rGO-EA was negative. For GO, the initial zeta potential was approximately \u221211.3 mV. The zeta potential value of rGO-EA ascended to about \u221218.4 mV, indicating that the reduction process removed the oxygen-containing groups from the rGO-EA [32].

We took the results of the biosafety assay and ultrasound imaging in vitro into consideration, and the rGO-EA concentration in SV@rGO-EA MBs was set at 0.10 mg/mL, which provided impressive echo intensity and CEUS imaging in vitro. The equivalent SV concentration was 5 mg/mL in every group. The CEUS and B-mode imaging effect on rat livers and kidneys is presented in Figure 9, following intraperitoneal injection at 5 s, 10 s and 30 s. The bright imaging effect on rat liver after the intraperitoneal injection of SV in CEUS is demonstrated in Figure 9a, and it exhibited a significant enhancement in liver parenchyma. In comparison, Figure 9b illustrates that SV@rGO-EA MBs provided a much superior enhancement effect in CEUS under ultrasonic irradiation within the liver parenchyma, which remained exceptionally pronounced even at 30 s. As for the kidneys, Figure 9c,d exhibits distinct boundaries of the kidneys in both CEUS and B-mode, and an evident enhancement in CEUS mode was observed. By contrast, SV@rGO-EA MBs demonstrated superior performance in renal CEUS imaging, according to Figure 9d. The renal echo exhibited a more pronounced contrastenhancing effect than hepatic echo following early injection at 5 s, as depicted in Figure 9b,d. However, it was also evident that the enhancing signal of the kidneys dissipated at a faster rate compared to the liver. In summary, better hepatic and renal signals in CEUS were observed after injecting SV@rGO-EA, compared to the SV injection state. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 10\nA quantitative analysis of the mean echo intensity of livers and kidneys in the drawn ROIs in Figure 10 was carried out. The contrast enhancement performance of the MBs in the livers of rats was evaluated by analyzing the acoustic signal intensity within the ROIs located in the liver parenchyma with uniform vascular distribution. Figure 10a reveals that after the injection at 10 s, the echo intensity values of the livers with SV and SV@rGOEA MBs were 14.8 \u00b1 3.3 dB and 25.5 \u00b1 1.2 dB, respectively. The echo intensity of SV@rGOEA exhibited a zooming increase in 10 s and stabilized over 40 s, demonstrating almost twice the echo intensity value over SV. The ROIs within the renal cortex of rats were selected to analyze the contrast-enhancing ability in the kidneys. Regarding the echo intensity values of SD rat kidneys in Figure 10b, SV and SV@rGO-EA MBs were 15.0 \u00b1 3.6 dB and 25.4 \u00b1 1.7 dB after the early injection (at 5 s). To sum up, the echo intensity of SV@rGOEA was significantly stronger than SV in livers and kidneys.\nFigure 9. CE S and B- ode S i ages of SV Bs in the liver (a) and kidney (c).

The in vivo imaging experiments were conducted using a PHILIPS EPIQ 7 ultrasound diagnostic system (PHILIPS, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a L12-5 linear array transducer (5\u201312 MHz). In response to the results of ultrasound imaging in vitro, a MI of 0.08 was selected for the contrast-enhanced imaging of MBs in SD rat livers and kidneys.

Additionally, the absorption of rGO-EA onto the spherical surface of SV MBs was successfully achieved. The biosafety of the product was confirmed through a cell viability assay and hemolysis assay. The results produced a good biomedical material, enhancing echo intensity and MI tolerance and surpassing the performance of SV MBs both in vitro and in vivo.
