 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Improve the approximation factor for IP-stable clustering. The paper gives an O(1)-approximation algorithm. An open question is whether a o(1)-approximation is possible.

2. Design efficient algorithms for 1-IP stable clustering for specific metrics like Euclidean space. The paper shows the problem is NP-hard in general metrics but leaves open the complexity for restricted metrics.

3. Study other clustering objectives like k-means, k-median, etc. under the constraint that the solution must be IP-stable. The paper suggests IP-stability is more meaningful when combined with standard objectives.

4. Extend the notions of f-IP stability to other functions f beyond min, max, and average distance. Are there other natural stability formulations that lead to tractable algorithms? 

5. Improve the running time of the O(1)-IP stable clustering algorithm by exploiting properties of common metric spaces like Euclidean. The paper runs in quadratic time in general but mentions possible speedups.
