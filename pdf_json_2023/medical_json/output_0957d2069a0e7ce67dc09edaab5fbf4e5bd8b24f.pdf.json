A case in point is that participants were reported to read pleasant sentences faster than the unpleasant controls when their muscles responsible for smiling were activated. However, little research has examined whether the feeling of amusement derived from humor processing like pun comprehension can exert a backward influence on ongoing cognitive tasks. In the present study, the participants\u2019 eye movements were tracked while they rated the comprehensibility of humorous sentences (homophone puns) and two types of unfunny control sentences (congruent and incongruent). Fixation measures showed an advantage in the critical homophone region for the congruent controls relative to the homophone puns; however, this pattern was reversed in terms of total sentence reading time. In addition, the humor rating scores acquired after the eye-tracking experiment were found negatively correlated to the overall sentence reading time, suggesting that the greater amusement the participant experienced the faster they would finish the rating task. Taken together, the current results indicate that the positive affect derived from humor can in turn provide immediate feedback to the cognitive system, which enhances text comprehension. As a result, the current finding provides more empirical evidence for the exploration of the interaction between the body and cognition.",

Although nearly all of us can easily detect humor when we\u00a0experience it, we\u00a0may still find it quite challenging to give a precise definition of humor. Indeed, the notion of humor is quite general and can vary from person to person. In this paper, we\u00a0adopt the definition given by Martin and Ford (2018) that humor is a comprehensive term consisting of a verbal or non-verbal stimulus that people perceive as funny, the mental processes of generating or perceiving such an amusing stimulus, and as well as the emotional response of mirth. In particular, we\u00a0focus on verbal humor, namely, humor expressed through language, rather than non-verbal ones such as comedy performances.\nPrevious research has shown that the positive emotion associated with humor can lead to cognitive benefits, especially in creativity and memory. Indeed, researchers have long noted the positive correlation between humor and creativity (Koestler, 1964), and have postulated at least two hypotheses on why humor may be\u00a0beneficial for creativity. The Flexible Thought Hypothesis argues that the flexible cognitive processes involved in understanding humor can boost the divergent\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 27 January 2023 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1127275"

The Positive Emotion Hypothesis emphasizes that the positive emotion we\u00a0experience in humor can reduce tension and anxiety, which in turn can promote our thinking and enhance our ability to integrate divergent materials (Isen et\u00a0al., 1987). In addition, convincing evidence has also accumulated from empirical studies supporting the idea that humor can enhance memory. Specifically, researchers have found that humorous materials are recalled better when presented in educational settings (Ziv, 1988), advertising settings (Krishnan and Chakravarti, 2003), or research settings (Chambers and Payne, 2014).\nDespite such cognitive benefits from a relatively long-term point of view, recent humor theories, especially cognitive-perceptual ones, predict a processing disadvantage for online humor comprehension. The Incongruity-Resolution Model, for example, argues that understanding a humorous text involves two separate stages (Suls, 1972; Attardo and Raskin, 1991). When reading humorous texts, such as a joke, the reader actively forms a discourse representation based on the input from the set-up sentences. However, this mental representation is then disconfirmed by the punchline, resulting in the detection of incongruity (the first stage). To get the joke, the reader has to search for the other plausible but less likely interpretation hinted by the punchline and resolve the semantic dilemma (the second stage). Take the following joke, for example.\nSon: Daddy, what is an alcoholic? Father: Do you\u00a0 see those four trees, son? An alcoholic would see eight trees. Son: Um, Dad, there are only two trees.\nBefore reading the last sentence of the dialog, one is likely to assume that it is a regular conversation about a sober father teaching his son something. However, the disparity between the number of trees reported by the father and son (four vs. two) leads to the incongruity, which triggers the reader to work out another interpretation to incorporate the new information. Once the reader realizes that it is not a sober but drunken father who is talking to his son, then the incongruity is resolved and the humor occurs. According to this theory, the incongruityresolution process in a joke costs more cognitive resources than a straight ending (e.g., Son: \u201cUm, Dad, I\u00a0 understand it now.\u201d), hence prolonged reading times for the punchline (See also the standard pragmatic view, Grice, 1975).\nThe Space Structuring Model also predicts a disadvantage for the processing of humorous materials (Coulson et\u00a0al., 2006). Adopting the framework of cognitive linguistic theories, such as Mental Space Theory, Conceptual Blending, and Frame Semantics, this theory claims that background and contextual information plays an active and vital role in the meaning-construction process rather than just helping to disambiguate the meaning of ambiguous words. In the case of humor comprehension, the Space Structuring Model proposes \u201cframe shifting\u201d as the central process for getting the humor, in which a new frame is retrieved from the long-term memory when the incoming information is inconsistent with the currently-activated frame (Coulson, 2015). Due to this extra cognitive process, it also predicts extra processing efforts for reading humorous materials.\nThe predicted disadvantage of processing humorous materials has been demonstrated in several empirical studies. Coulson and Kutas (1998) employed the self-paced reading paradigm to investigate the processes of joke comprehension. In their experiment, the authors used one-line jokes and manipulated the relationship between preceding\ncontexts and the sentence-final words so that the final words either trigger a frame-shifting process or remain consistent with the currentlyactivated frame (e.g., I asked the woman at the party if she remembered me from last year and she said she never forgets a dress/face). It was shown that the participants spent longer reading times on the final words in the humorous condition (e.g., dress) than in the non-funny control condition (e.g., face). Since the final words in both conditions were matched in cloze probability, these results were interpreted as reflecting the additional cognitive cost for the frame-shifting process. Coulson et\u00a0 al. (2006) replicated this processing disadvantage for jokes in an eye-tracking experiment using the same materials. In addition to longer reading times, the participants were also found to regress more into the previous context from the sentence-terminal position, indicating the readers needed to re-evaluate the relationship between the punchline and the discourse representation built upon the sentential context. In a recent ERP study, Mayerhofer and Schacht (2015) also reported increased reading times for the final words in the so-called garden-path jokes compared to those in sentences with coherent endings. Take one of their jokes for example. Mummy, I\u00a0just turned 14. May I\u00a0please, finally, be\u00a0allowed to wear a bra and makeup? \u2013No, you\u00a0are not. Eat up your soup, my son! In this joke, the initial interpretation is disconfirmed by my son and readers have to reanalyze the speakers\u2019 relationship in order to form a new coherent representation. Additionally, joke endings also elicited enhanced N400 amplitudes, indicating greater integration difficulties (Kutas and Federmeier, 2011).\nIn contrast to the above-mentioned findings, results from other studies have suggested that humor facilitates online cognitive processing. Mitchell et\u00a0al. (2010), for example, reported a humor facilitation effect when the participants were reading humorous jokes relative to non-humorous controls which differed only in the last sentence. It was found that jokes were not only rated as more humorous, recalled better, and more importantly read faster in the last sentence (the punchline). Since the participants were required to rate the funniness of the materials during the experiment, these authors attributed the longer reading times to the re-examination of possible humorous contents that may have been missed during the initial reading. Such a facilitative effect was also supported by Ferstl et\u00a0 al.\u2019s (2017) eye-tracking study. To disentangle the cognitive and affective process involved in joke comprehension, Ferstl and colleagues compared jokes with texts involving revision of the situation model without being funny. According to their results, jokes were not only read faster than the revision texts but also induced fewer regressions back to the previous context. Therefore, these authors attributed these advantages to the positive affect elicited by jokes.\nBesides the facilitative effect reported in jokes, Zheng and Wang (2022) also observed a similar effect using another important type of verbal humor, homophone puns. In this study, the participants were required to rate the funniness of three types of sentences: homophone puns (e.g., \u9648\u6c0f\u7537\u79d1\u533b\u9662, \u60a8\u7684\u7537\u9898\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u51b3\u3002Chen\u2019s Andrology Hospital, your male problems we\u00a0solve); unfunny congruent controls (e.g., \u9648\u6c0f\u7537\u79d1\u533b\u9662, \u60a8\u7684\u96be\u9898\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u51b3\u3002Chen\u2019s Andrology Hospital, your difficult problems we\u00a0solve) and unfunny incongruent controls (e.g., \u9648\u6c0f\u7259\u79d1\u533b\u9662, \u60a8\u7684\u7537\u9898\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u3002Chen\u2019s Dental Hospital, your male problems we\u00a0solve). As they expected, these authors observed longer fixation times on the homophones in the pun condition (e.g., \u7537\u9898, male problem) than in the congruent controls (e.g., \u96be\u9898, difficult problem). However, since the homophones used in the congruent controls were more salient than those in the pun condition, it was difficult to decide whether the difficulty had arisen from the salience difference or from\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nthe extra effort needed for extra cognitive processes (e.g., frame shifting). Nevertheless, a reverse pattern was found regarding sentence reading times. Specifically, the authors found that the participants read the homophone puns faster than the two control conditions before moving on to the funniness rating task. Zheng and Wang (2022) argued that this finding could reflect a humor facilitation effect where the readers felt more confident to move on after they had gotten the pun.\nTaken together, disputes still exist in the literature concerning whether humor comprehension can exert a facilitative effect on online cognitive processes. This inconsistency, firstly, could be\u00a0partially due to the different materials used in the experiments. For example, the experimental materials used by Coulson et\u00a0al. (2006) consisted of only one sentence, the final word of which could either turn the sentence into a joke or unfunny control (e.g., She read so much about the bad effects of smoking; she decided to give up the reading/habit.). While the jokes used by Mitchell et\u00a0al. (2010) and Ferstl et\u00a0al. (2017) were composed of several sentences. More importantly, the prolonged reading times for jokes reported by Coulson et\u00a0 al. (2006) were only reading times of these sentence-final words. In contrast, evidence supporting the humor facilitation effect was mainly based on reading times at the sentence level, usually those of the punchlines. Indeed, Zheng and Wang (2022) found prolonged reading times for the homophones in homophone puns, partly supporting the humor processing disadvantage predicted by the Space Structuring Model (Coulson et\u00a0al., 2006); however, total reading times of the pun sentences were significantly shorter than their congruent controls differing only in the homophones, suggesting a humor facilitative effect could have occurred at a later stage. In addition, experimental tasks could have contributed to the above-mentioned discrepancies as well. So far, evidence supporting the humor facilitation effect is mainly from studies using funniness rating tasks (e.g., Mitchell et\u00a0al., 2010; Zheng and Wang, 2022). As a result, more empirical data are needed to distinguish whether the facilitative effect is resulted from the positive feedback from humor per se or due to some specific strategies that readers formed during the funniness rating task, or both.\nAnswers to these questions may not only shed more light on the cognitive processing of humor but also provide new insights into the interaction between bodily status and cognition. Previous research on embodied cognition has demonstrated that certain bodily postures or status could influence how people perceive verbal humor (Strack et\u00a0al., 1988; Kaspar et\u00a0al., 2016). In a recent study exploring the humor-body association, Xu et\u00a0al. (2022) abstracted the most frequent metaphors concerning humor and laughter based on a large-scale corpus investigation. They then primed the participants with some of these metaphors by asking them to perform related actions (e.g., \u201cholding one\u2019s belly while bending forward and backward repeatedly,\u201d corresponding to the Chinese idiom \u201c\u6367\u8179\u5927\u7b11\u201d) before they rated the materials containing jokes. Their results showed that the participants who were primed with these embodied humor metaphors reported higher funniness scores than the participants in the control group who were primed with non-metaphor actions. This finding provides more evidence that bodily posture or status can exert a feed-forward influence on how we\u00a0 perceive humor. However, it is still unclear whether particular bodily experiences (e.g., the feeling of amusement) can provide immediate feedback that can modulate cognition. As a result, this unanswered question has also motivated the present investigation.\nTo sum up, the present study attempts to answer the following research question: whether the facilitative effect in reading humorous texts reported in previous studies is due to positive feedback from the affect system or merely derived from task-related strategies? Since most\nof the studies that reported such a facilitative effect have employed a funniness rating task, it was possible that the task requirements rather than enhanced cognitive efforts have led participants to spend more time reading the unfunny text in case they would miss some potential funny contents, hence the shorter reading times for their humorous counterparts (e.g., Mitchell et\u00a0al., 2010). To better compare with some of the previous research, the participants read one-line sentences adopted from Zheng and Wang\u2019s (2022) study while their eye movements were recorded. They needed to rate the comprehensibility of each sentence, which could be\u00a0a homophone pun, an unfunny congruent control, or an unfunny incongruent control. If the participants would still exhibit a facilitative effect in reading the homophone puns, it would be\u00a0more reasonable to claim that such an advantage may result from the humor experience itself rather than from task-based strategies. Besides, the participants were also asked to rate the same set of sentences after the eye-tracking experiment. If the facilitation effect for cognition was valid, it could be\u00a0predicted that there should be\u00a0a positive correlation between the facilitation and the amusement that readers received from humor."

Gaze duration (GD, also called first-pass time) is the total duration of all fixations from entering a region until existing either to the right or to the left. Total duration (TD, also called dwell time) is the summed duration of all fixations in the region. Regression Path Duration (RPD) is the total duration of all fixations that occur from the first fixation on a region until the target region is exited to the right. Regression-In proportion (Reg_In) and Regression-Out proportion (Reg_Out) is defined as the probability that readers regress into or out of a certain region, respectively.\nAmong the fixation-based measures, GD is sensitive to early lexical processing, and TD can reflect both the early lexical processing and the semantic integration processes (Rayner et\u00a0al., 2004). The regressionbased measures, RPD, Reg_In, and Reg_Out, can index extra cognitive effort that readers have to make, especially when they experience difficulty in integrating the current input and have to search for more clues in previous regions.\nMean fixation times and the standard error for the eye movement measures are shown in Table\u00a03. Eye movement measures were defined as dependent variables and subjected to a series of linear mixed-effect models using the homophone pun condition as the baseline for comparisons.\nThe critical context noun region (ROI1) For ROI1, early measures revealed no significant difference between the congruent control and the pun sentences in GD (\u03b2 =\u00a00.01, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.01, t =\u00a01.01), which was as expected since the same critical context word was used. However, the critical context words were read significantly slower in the congruent controls than in the homophone puns in TD (\u03b2 =\u00a00.04, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.01, t =\u00a02.77). Regression-In data showed that the participants were more likely to regress to the context noun region in the congruent control condition (\u03b2 =\u00a00.38, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.13, z = 2.83, p < 0.01).\nGaze-duration analyses revealed no significant difference between the pun sentences and the incongruent controls in ROI1 (\u03b2 =\u00a0 0.01, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.01, t =\u00a00.98), indicating that the lexical properties of the critical context nouns were well-matched. As in the congruent control condition, the participants also spent longer times in ROI1 in the incongruent control condition in terms of TD (\u03b2 =\u00a0 0.07, SE\u00a0=\u00a0 0.01, t =\u00a0 4.93) and were more likely to regress into this region (\u03b2 =\u00a0 0.33, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.13, z = 2.46, p < 0.05)."

            "text": "The current eye-tracking study has investigated whether humor experience (i.e., the feeling of amusement or mirth) can give immediate feedback to the brain and facilitate ongoing cognitive tasks. In the experiment, the participants read homophone-pun sentences and two comparison controls (congruous and incongruous). It is found that though the salient homophones in the congruent control sentences were read significantly faster than their less salient homophone mates in the homophone puns, this lexical-level advantage was overridden when regression-based measures were examined. Specifically, the participants were more likely to make regressions from both the homophone region and the following sentential-final region in the congruous control condition. In addition, sentence-level analyses have exhibited a negative correlation between sentence reading time and the funniness rating score. Since the participants were required to rate the comprehensibility instead of the funniness of the sentences during the eye-tracking experiment, it was unlikely that the participants had strategically regressed more in the unfunny control conditions to double-check for potential humorous contents. Instead, we\u00a0argue that the positive feeling of mirth when getting the pun facilitated the cognitive processes of the readability rating task, hence the fewer regressions and faster sentence reading times.\nFacilitative effect in reading humorous texts\nThe facilitative effect in reading puns observed in the present study is consistent with previous research reporting a similar effect in reading jokes (Mitchell et\u00a0al., 2010; Ferstl et\u00a0al., 2017). However, unlike previous studies where the participants were usually required to rate the funniness of the materials, we\u00a0required the participants to rate the readability of the sentences. Compared with a funniness rating task, this task can lead the participants to focus more on the cognitive aspects of the reading materials instead of the affective ones. Indeed, Mitchell et\u00a0al. (2010) contributed the facilitative effect of jokes, at least partly, to the funniness rating task, which could have led the participants to regress more to recheck humorous contents that could have been missed. As a result, it is more conclusive for the current study to claim that reading humorous materials can facilitate online cognitive processing.\nThe shorter reading times for pun sentences than both the congruent and incongruent controls lend further support to Ferstl et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2017) explanation. According to these authors, such a facilitative effect in reading humorous materials (e.g., jokes) could be\u00a0 attributed to the\ninstantaneous feedback about the correctness of the interpretation. Although homophone puns are used in the current study instead of jokes, puns are also an important type of verbal humor, which has been widely used in the research of humor (e.g., Goel and Dolan, 2001). As a result, we\u00a0 believe that it is the same mechanism that underlies the facilitative effects in both studies. In addition to reading times, Ferstl et\u00a0al. (2017) also found that the regression rate from the punchline to the context region was negatively correlated with the funniness rating score in the jokes. And in the current study, we\u00a0have found a negative correlation between the sentence reading time and the funniness rating score. Although the funniness rating scores were acquired after the participants finished the eye-tracking experiment, this general trend can also support this cognitive feedback account.\nThe faster sentence reading time for humorous materials (i.e., homophone puns), however, does not contrast with the study of Coulson et\u00a0al. (2006). Ferstl et\u00a0al. (2017) also compared their results with this earlier study and attributed the differences to task requirements and experimental materials. Specifically, their joke materials were dialogs consisting of several sentences, and the participants were required to finish either a funniness rating task or revision judgment, while in Coulson et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2006) study the participants only read one-line jokes and answered comprehension questions. Of course, these differences could account for some of the variations in the reading times. However, the total reading times reported in Coulson et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2006) study were the total reading times of the sentence-final words, which should not be\u00a0compared directly with the sentence reading times reported in Ferstl et\u00a0al.\u2019s (2017) study. Comparatively speaking, the materials and tasks used in the current study are more comparable to those of Coulson et\u00a0al. (2006). In the present study, we\u00a0also used one-line sentences which can either turn into a homophone pun or a non-humorous control by the critical homophone. And the readability rating task was also supposed to focus the participants\u2019 attention on the cognitive aspects of the text.\nIndeed, the longer fixations (GD and TD) at the critical homophone regions for the homophone puns compared with the congruent controls are consistent with the findings of Coulson et\u00a0al. (2006), supportive of their Space Structure Model. According to this theory, understanding homophone puns involves a frame-shifting process (retrieving a new frame from the long-term memory), which is cognitively more effortful and increases the reading times for words that trigger this process (namely, the less salient homophones). Of course, the difference in GD can at least partially be\u00a0 resulted from the lexical properties of the homophones since less salient homophones are used in the homophone pun condition. However, the differences in TD indicate more difficulty in integrating the less salient homophones into the context, presumably indicating the extra effort involved in the process of frame-shifting. In addition, this difficulty seemed quite local and we\u00a0did not observe a significant spill-over effect in the following region. It is worth noting that this local (lexical) processing difficulty in reading homophone puns is\nTABLE\u00a03 Fixation data of different regions of interest (ROIs) in the three experimental conditions.\nROI1 (critical context noun) ROI2 (homophone) ROI3 (spill-over region)\nCC HP IC CC HP IC CC HP IC\nGD (ms) 271(6) 260(6) 272(6) 324(8) 390(9) 397(9) 373(11) 382(11) 408(13)\nTD (ms) 431(12) 392(11) 480(14) 545(14) 633(14) 753(18) 642(23) 643(20) 724(23)\nRPD (ms) 726(30) 729(28) 709(26) 1,136(55) 1,124(55) 1,428(62) 1,672(56) 1,630(50) 1991(60)\nReg_In (%) 36.9(2) 29.5(2) 36.0(2) 27.1(2) 32.7(2) 35.5(2) NA NA NA\nReg_Out (%) 21.3(2) 20.5(2) 20.4(2) 27.3(2) 22.8(2) 25.6(2) 82.8(2) 77.3(2) 84.4(2)\nCC, congruent control; HP, homophone pun; IC, incongruent control.

On the contrary, this reverse pattern highlighted the positive feedback of humor was derived after the participants had gotten the pun.\nIn addition, the significantly longer fixations for both the ROI2 and ROI3 in the incongruent condition relative to the pun condition indicate that the incongruity caused by the less salient homophone was detected. Note that the incongruent condition was created from the homophone pun condition by replacing the critical context noun with an unrelated noun. Although this manipulation made the less salient homophone difficult to process, the participants could still make some sense out of the sentence with the meaning of the unpresented salient homophones, as in the homophone pun condition. According to the IncongruityResolution Model, the resolution of incongruity should elicit the feeling of amusement in humorous texts (Suls, 1972). However, funniness rating scores for the incongruous condition (M = 3.08) indicate more uncertainty rather than amusement. As a result, this discrepancy indicates the other important prerequisite of humor experience, namely a nonserious playful mindset (Wyer and Collins, 1992). In the homophone pun condition, the participants were more likely to treat the less salient homophones as \u201ca play on words\u201d in the pun condition while as \u201cspelling mistakes\u201d in the incongruent condition. In fact, some of the participants did express their doubt about potential misspellings in the incongruent condition after finishing the experiment.\nInteraction between the body and cognition\nThe current findings can shed new light on the embodied cognition approach to humor studies. One of the central claims of the embodied cognition theories is that our knowledge or cognition is derived from our interaction with the outside world through our bodied experience, and therefore is fundamentally anchored in multiple bodily ways such as simulations, situated actions, and bodily states (Barsalou, 2008). An increasing literature has accumulated supporting this embodied view of language (See Barsalou, 2010 for a review). One of the most extensively used paradigms in this line of research is to prime participants with certain sensorimotor experiences that are associated with abstract concepts and then evaluate the influence they may have on the ensuing processing of the corresponding concepts. For example, Kaspar et\u00a0al. (2016) asked some of their participants to pull a manikin leg or yank a chain before they added captions for cartoons. According to the funniness ratings of independent judges, these participants generated funnier captions than the control group who received no such action primes, suggesting that these bodied actions (connected with metaphorical expressions, i.e., pulling one\u2019s leg and yank one\u2019s chain) may have a \u201cfeed-forward\u201d impact on the ongoing language tasks. In contrast, the participants in the current study were faster in finishing rating the more humorous homophone-pun sentences without any bodily prime before the task, indicating the bodily state of feeling mirth can also exert a \u201cfeed-backward\u201d influence on ongoing cognitive tasks. As a result, the current study lends more support to the embodied cognition view of language processing.\nThe interaction between cognition and affect observed in the current study can be\u00a0better explained by models that implicitly distinguish the cognitive and affective aspects of verbal humor. Chan et\u00a0al. (2013), for example, proposed a three-staged model of verbal humor processing based on their fMRI study, including incongruity detection, incongruity resolution, and humor elaboration (See also Wyer and Collins, 1992). According to their findings, these three stages have their specific neural signatures in the brain: the incongruity-detection stage is characterized\nby greater activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and right medial frontal gyrus, the incongruity-resolution stage is associated with greater activation in the left superior frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule, and the feeling of mirth activates rewarding areas such as the subcortical bilateral amygdalae and bilateral parahippocampal gyri. These findings have provided convincing evidence that the cognitive and affective aspects associated with humor are underpinned by discrete neural networks. As a result, this cognitive-affective model can delineate a more complete picture of humor processing than the classic cognitiveperceptual models, such as the incongruity-resolution model (Suls, 1972).\nOne limitation of the current study needs to be\u00a0noted. Namely, the funniness rating scores obtained in this study could be\u00a0affected by the experimental procedures. Since our first concern is to disentangle the positive feedback triggered by the humor experience from the potential strategic influence formed by the funniness rating task, the funniness rating scores were collected after the eye-tracking experiment. Although the general patterns in the ratings of the three sentence types were consistent with that of Zheng and Wang\u2019s (2022) study, some of these scores could suffer from the fatigue or practice effect."
