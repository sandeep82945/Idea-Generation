"Several limitations of the present study need to be noted. Regarding the selection of participants, most of the participants were female college students. Therefore, it was unknown whether the unbalanced gender ratio affected the task performance of implicit learning based on social feedback. Considering the large number of female teachers in primary and secondary schools [27] and the objective limitations of the image database (male East Asian faces were not abundant), the division of in-group and out-group facial feedback was only based on female racial faces."
