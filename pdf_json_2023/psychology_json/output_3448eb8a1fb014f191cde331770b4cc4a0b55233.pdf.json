    "abstractText": "Background Endophytic Aspergillus species produce countless valuable bioactive secondary metabolites. In the cur\u2010 rent study, Aspergillus flavus an endophyte from the soft coral Sarcophyton ehrenbergi was chemically explored and the extracted phytoconstituents were subsequently evaluated for antimicrobial activity. This is accomplished by employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computational techniques. Additionally, An in vitro anticancer analysis of A. flavus total extract against breast cancer cells (MCF\u20107) was investigated. Result Six compounds were separated from the crude alcohol extract of the endophytic Aspergillus flavus out of which anhydro\u2010mevalonolactone was reported for the first time. The anti\u2010fungal and anti\u2010Helicobacter pylori properties of two distinct compounds (Scopularides A and B) were assessed. Additionally, computational research was done to identify the binding mechanisms for all compounds. Both the compounds were found to be active against H. pylori with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 7.81 to 15.63 \u03bcg/ mL as com\u2010 pared with clarithromycin 1.95 \u03bcg/ mL. Scopularides A was potent against both Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger with MIC values ranging from 3.9 to 31.25 \u03bcg/ mL, while scopularides B only inhibits Candida albicans with MIC value of 15.63 \u03bcg/ mL and weak inhibitory activity against A. niger (MIC = 125 \u03bcg/ mL). Furthermore, cytotoxic activity showed a significant effect (IC50: 30.46 mg/mL) against MCF\u20107 cells. Conclusion Our findings report that cytotoxic activity and molecular docking support the antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus flavus, which could be a promising alternative source as a potential antimicrobial agent.",

The anti\u2011fungal and anti\u2011Helicobacter pylori properties of two distinct compounds (Scopularides A and B) were assessed. Additionally, computational research was done to identify the binding mechanisms for all compounds. Both the compounds were found to be active against H. pylori with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 7.81 to 15.63 \u00b5g/ mL as com\u2011 pared with clarithromycin 1.95 \u00b5g/ mL. Scopularides A was potent against both Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger with MIC values ranging from 3.9 to 31.25 \u00b5g/ mL, while scopularides B only inhibits Candida albicans with MIC value of 15.63 \u00b5g/ mL and weak inhibitory activity against A. niger (MIC = 125 \u00b5g/ mL). Furthermore, cytotoxic activity showed a significant effect (IC50: 30.46 mg/mL) against MCF\u20117 cells.\nConclusion Our findings report that cytotoxic activity and molecular docking support the antimicrobial activity of Aspergillus flavus, which could be a promising alternative source as a potential antimicrobial agent.\nKeywords In silico profile, Antimicrobial, Anticancer, Endophyte, Dynamic simulation, NMR spectroscopy, Sarcophyton ehrenbergi\n*Correspondence: Abdel Nasser B.

            "text": "In the twenty-first century, severe infections caused by bacteria, resistant to frequently used antibiotics have become a major global healthcare concern [1]. Antimicrobial resistance has also required more time and effort to treat, making the issue both more serious and time-consuming [2]. Microbial resistance to antibiotics is linked to changes in antibiotic permeability, target molecules, enzymatic degradation of medications, and intrinsic antimicrobial efflux from the cytosol. These strategic tactics are used by bacteria and other microbes to prevent antibiotic toxicity [3]. The production of new antibiotics has dramatically decreased in recent years. Instead, existing drugs are being reviewed more often, and efforts are being made to develop novel antibiotics [3]. Traditional medicinal herbs, used from ancient times [4] are expected to be the natural source of more potential antibiotics in the future. Several ways have been tried to discover novel antimicrobial chemicals or to increase the activity of current antibacterial medications which are scarcely derived from endophytic fungi of medicinal plants [5]. The quest for new bioactive metabolites from marine resources and their isolated endophytes is rising today because of their unique metabolites [6\u20138]. Helicobacter ppylori is the most common cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. It continues to be a serious infectious disease that affects adults in underdeveloped nations. Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains during the past few years, existing control efforts have mostly been limited. This has shifted dramatically the focus of the scientific community towards harnessing natural resources, particularly plants and fungi to develop safer and more valuable drugs [9].\nFungal infections can be hazardous for patients, particularly for those using anticancer or immunosuppressive medications. The patient is more vulnerable to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections due to immunosuppression imposed on illnesses or other disorders. Due to the damage caused by fungal infections while using immunosuppressive medications, such as anticancer medications, safer antifungal medications have been developed with minimal negative clinical effects. Since many of the present medications had adverse effects, losing their effectiveness against new fungal strains, or the intended fungi had grown resistant to them, the demand for the next-generation antifungal agents has expanded. Therefore, it is crucial to develop antifungal medications with a broad spectrum of biocidal activity, low toxicity, and a novel mode of action. Most of the anti-infective medications in the industry were produced from the vast diversity of bioresources, which can act as an inexhaustible reservoir of naturally occurring bioactive secondary chemicals [10, 11].\nNatural products offer effective alternatives and promising sources for many bioactivities [12, 13].\nInfections triggered by drug-resistant microorganisms are becoming more common all over the world. Furthermore, many adverse effects linked to the consistent use of antifungal medicines have been recorded. Systemic fungal infections have been treated using amphotericin B, which is produced from Streptomyces nodosus. However, it was well known to have dangerous, perhaps fatal adverse effects like high temperature and trembling chills after a few hours of infusion. Azole antifungal medications are commonly used in treating a wide range of fungal illnesses. Their antifungal strategies include decreasing the formation of membrane ergosterol, which inhibits fungal growth via CYP450 suppression. However, these medicines have e potential to adhere to human membranes and cause kidney injury [14]. As a result, new medications must be discovered from a variety of sources. Many isolated natural chemical compounds and extracts have been reported for their potential biological activities [15\u201317]. Natural sources such as terrestrial and marine endophytes and their bioactive metabolites are being investigated for their antimicrobial activity and due to their distinctiveness, the search for novel bioactive metabolites from marine natural resources and their derived endophytes is continuously increasing [6\u20138]. Fungistatic and fungicidal properties can be found in many natural products or components. These pharmaceutically valuable agents of natural origins have significantly lesser side effects than synthetic ones [9].\nMolecular docking is a simulation technique which determines the optimal fit between ligands and the active sites of certain targets. This process entails assembling a 3D coordinate space on the target\u2019s binding site, calculating the binding affinity of the generated complex, and elaborating the molecule\u2019s subsequent orientation on the ligand\u2019s binding site [18]. The biggest negative number represents the sensitivity of binding affinity, which is a representation of the best shape or created complex [19, 20].\nSince endophytes, abundant in tissues of almost all marine and terrestrial plants so far, have been acknowledged as a valuable source of bioactive secondary metabolites, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of cyclodepsipeptides against Helicobacter pylori, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. According to previously reported data, polyketides and cyclodepsipeptide showed antimicrobial activity [21], which prompted us to comprehensively evaluate the antimicrobial activities of isolated metabolites, together with a prediction of the antimicrobial activity of the isolated compounds by using molecular docking."

            "text": "Identification of\u00a0fungal crude extract separated compounds To investigate the active metabolites, present in the identified fungus, the purification of crude extracts was performed, and this yielded six main compounds, namely, phomaligol A (1), Ergosterol (2), anhydro-mevalonolactone (3), Ditryptophenaline (4), and scopularide A (5) and B (6) (Fig.\u00a0 1) The separated compounds were identified based on their spectral data (1H-, 13C-NMR), and were compared with the compounds already reported in the literature.\nPhomaligol A was separated as a colorless oil, and NMR data (CDCl3, 25\u00a0\u00baC) were in agreement with those reported for phomaligol A (Additional file\u00a01: Figs. S1, S2) [22]. Ergosterol was separated as colorless crystals, which was confirmed by reported data on ergosterol (Additional file\u00a01: Figs. S3, S4) [23, 24].\nAnhydro-mevalonolactone was separated as a paleyellow oil. The 1H-NMR [(DMSO, 25\u00a0\u00baC)] spectral analysis showed the presence of two protons at \u03b4H 2.39 (t, 2H, H-4) and 4.40 (t, 1H, H-3), methyl protons as a singlet at \u03b4H 1.96 (3H, H-7) and a methine proton at \u03b4H 5.74 (m, 1H, H-6). The structural assignment of compound 3 was further substantiated by the attached proton test (APT) experiment. It presents six-member lactone ring with a carboxylic carbon at \u03b4C 164.39 (C-1), ethylene carbon at 115.94 (C-6) and three aliphatic carbons at \u03b4C 66.1 (C-3), \u03b4C 29.09 (C-4) and \u03b4C 22.9 (C-7) ppm, and one\nquaternary carbon at \u03b4C 160.64 (C-5). For compound elucidation using HMBC, the carbon at 160.64 (C-5) linked with the methyl group at \u03b4H 1.96 (H-7) showed a long range coupling with \u03b4H 2.38 (H-4) and \u03b4H 4.40 (H-3). The carbonyl carbon showed long-range coupling with (H-3). Moreover, C-4 showed a relation with a methyl group at \u03b4H 1.96 ppm (H-7) and another coupling with methylene proton at \u03b4H 4.40 (H-3) ppm. The 1H-1H COSY of compound 3, showed a correlation between H-3 at \u03b4H 4.40 (t, J = 6.3 Hz) and H-4 at \u03b4H 2.38 (t, J = 6.4 Hz). This contribution represents the first report on the isolation and identification of this compound from A. flavus. The NMR data were in accordance with those reported for the fungal metabolite anhydro-mevalonolactone in the literature (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S5\u2013S8) [25]. Ditryptophenaline is a white solid and the NMR data (CDCl3, 25\u00a0 \u00baC) were in accordance with those reported for the fungal metabolite ditryptophenaline (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S9\u2013S12) [26, 27]. Scopularide A and B (NMR data recore in CDCl3, 25\u00a0\u00baC) were isolated as previously reported in [19] (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S13\u2013S19)."

Five conformations were obtained for each compound th a mean total energy for the production phase in kcal/ mol against time in Ps as shown in Fig.\u00a06. Results revealed that for DHFR, the ligand stability increased overtime with a range of energy (14.5\u201315.5) kcal/mol while Scopularide A increased overtime with better stability of lower energy in the range of (\u2212\u00a067.5- \u2212\u00a070.25) kcal/mol.

New four hydrogen bonds were created between the reference ligand and DHFR, two between N1 and H30, H31 and two between N5 and H32, H33. As for Scopularide A, five hydrogen bonds have been recreated; N8\u2013H73, N9\u2013H77, N10\u2013H78, N11\u2013H79 and N12\u2013H88, while Scopularide B displayed four hydrogen bonds; N8\u2013H67, N9\u2013H71, N10\u2013H81, N12\u2013H83 Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2.\nAdditionally, results of dynamic simulation studies with Phytase enzyme revealed that the ligand interaction stability increased overtime but decreased gradually\nafter 22 Ps as shown in Fig.\u00a06, while Scopularide A and B increased overtime with better total energy in ranges of (\u2212\u00a0 56.25 to \u2212\u00a0 58.25) and (\u2212\u00a0 83.00-\u2212\u00a0 84.25) kcal/ mol respectively kcal/mol.

Detailed analysis of the generated hypotheses revealed a fixed cost of value: 32.0695 and a Null cost of value: 227.633, the best pharmacophore model selected based on total cost obtained to be near to fixed cost and far from null cost value and possessing the nearest correlation to 1. The first generated model was the most successful displaying total cost of value: 39.8973 and correlation factor = 0.995259. The obtained pharmacophore model as shown in Fig.\u00a07 showed five essential structural features and eight different binding sites: two hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), one hydrophobic pocket and four ring aromatic sites. This model showed estimated IC50 values of the training set of five compounds close enough to the reported ones as shown in Table\u00a02 with acceptable fit value. Validation of the model was applied via the test set of two compounds which showed estimated IC50 comparable to those of actual ones with good fit value near 7. The phytocompounds were then screened using the selected pharmacophore model and showed expected IC50 in the range of (22.544\u201433.049) \u00b5M. Scopularide A and B displayed a mean of IC50 value of 24.7\u00a0\u00b5M. From these results, we can conclude that the phytocompounds could possess successful interaction against the DHFR of C. albicans with promising IC50 values."

Wattanachaisaereekul et\u00a0 al. reported that AMVL has several applications in the biotechnological and medical industries and has been employed as a precursor in the manufacture of insect pest control chemicals [37]. Phomaligol A had previously been linked to the blackleg fungus Leptosphaeria maculans and marine-derived Aspergillus flavus, showing antibacterial action against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus [38]. Moreover, phomaligol A and ergosterol showed moderate anti-trypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei. Furthermore, ergosterol exhibited a strong inhibitory effect towards HepG2, B16, LLC, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cell lines [39]. Cyclodepsipeptides are comprised of a vast family that constitutes widely diverse peptide-related natural products that are mostly made of hydroxy and amino acids linked by amide and ester linkage. This class of natural products have a wide distribution in macroorganisms as well as microorganisms. On the other hand, cyclodepsipeptides have been associated to an array of diverse biological activities. Various activities were reported related to natural bioresources, and these diverse bioactivities were due to the presence of \u03b1-hydroxy acids which were like \u03b1-amino acids that occur readily in natural peptides. Moreover, due to frequent N-methylation of amino acid residues, which inhibits the action of enzymes and interferes with their bioavailability, they may also be able to withstand the action of certain hydrolyzing enzymes. Both cyclodepsipeptides, scopularide A and B isolated from A. flavus crude extract were subjected to various biological activities. In contrast to some reports [40], which documented that scopularide A and B exhibited no activity against Gram negative bacteria and moderate against gram positive bacteria, our results revealed that both Scopularide A and B possess significant broad-spectrum anti-H. pylori activity. Contrary to, Scopularide B revealed significant activity only against Candida albicans, while scopularide A showed significant antifungal activity against both Candida albicans and A. niger. As mentioned before, Aspergillus\u00a0species are an important source of new bioactive metabolites with therapeutic values [41]. In this study, the crude extract of A. flavus, has been revealed to possess anticancer properties against human breast cancer cells."

Amphotericin B was used as the standard antifungal. After incubation, 100\u00a0 \u00b5l of freshly prepared XTT (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, and incubated again for 1 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Calorimetric variation in the XTT assay was measured using a microtiter plate reader (BioTECK, USA) at 492\u00a0nm. The inhibition percentage was calculated using the formula:\nAb (f+ s) is of wells containing fungi with extracts, Abss is of wells containing extracts alone, Absf is of wells containing fungi alone, and Absb is of wells containing media alone [58]. The MIC was specified as the extract concentration that produced a 100 % decrease in optical density compared with the control growth results."
