Recent works show that quantum computers can efficiently construct a model of a classifier by engineering the quantum interference effect to carry out the kernel evaluation in parallel. For practical applications of these quantum machine learning methods, an important issue is to minimize the size of quantum circuits. We present the simplest quantum circuit for constructing a kernel-based binary classifier. This is achieved by generalizing the interference circuit to encode data labels in the relative phases of the quantum state and by introducing compact amplitude encoding, which encodes two training data vectors into one quantum register. When compared to the simplest known quantum binary classifier, the number of qubits is reduced by two and the number of steps is reduced linearly with respect to the number of training data. The two-qubit measurement with post-selection required in the previous method is simplified to single-qubit measurement. Furthermore, the final quantum state has a smaller amount of entanglement than that of the previous method, which advocates the cost-effectiveness of our method. Our design also provides a straightforward way to handle an imbalanced data set, which is often encountered in many machine learning problems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs the quest for fault-tolerant quantum computers continues, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to be available in the near future [1], supported by the recent technological advances in quantum computing [2\u20139]. Although the size of quantum circuits that NISQ devices can execute reliably is limited, the size of the quantum state space efficiently manipulated by them is much beyond what classical computers can handle. As such an interesting era is within reach, an important task in the quantum computing community is finding commercially relevant applications of the NISQ technology for which quantum advantage can be demonstrated in the near future.\nMachine learning has been considered as a promising domain for which quantum computing can shine [10\u201315]. Quantum advantages in machine learning are expected, since quantum computers can in principle store and manipulate the amount of classical information that scales exponentially with the number of qubits [16\u201318]. Moreover, quantum computers can reduce the computational cost exponentially for solving certain basic linear algebra problems [19, 20] that often appear as basic subroutines in machine learning tasks, such as in support vector machine [21] and principal component analysis [22]. However, the size of quantum circuits required for imple-\n\u2217 dkd.park@yonsei.ac.kr\nmenting basic linear algebra subroutines on a quantum computer is too large for near-term quantum devices.\nSeveral quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed to perform the kernel-based classification by exploiting the ability of quantum computers to efficiently evaluate inner products in an exponentially-large Hilbert space [15], and without relying on expensive subroutines [21, 23\u201327]. In particular, Refs. [25, 26] proposed the most simple quantum circuit for utilizing the quantum interference effect now known as the Hadamardtest classifier (HTC) and show that it can be used as a simple model of a kernel-based classifier for real-valued data. If an efficient state preparation routine is known, the algorithm achieves the logarithmic scaling in the dimension and number of the input data with a simple setup. Namely, given a quantum state that encodes the classical data in a specific form, the algorithm only uses a Hadamard gate and the expectation measurement of a two-qubit observable to complete the labeling task. Furthermore, the algorithm is agnostic to the quantum data encoding method, such as amplitude encoding [12] and quantum feature mapping [24].\nIn this work, we present a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that is even simpler than HTC by introducing compact amplitude encoding (CAE) of real-valued data, which reduces the number of training steps linearly and the number of qubits by two. In CAE, training data belonging to one class is encoded as the real part of the probability amplitudes, while the remaining training data is encoded as the imaginary part. In order to utilize\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n02 15\n1v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 5\nJu l 2\n02 2\n2 CAE, we show that the single-qubit interfering circuit of the HTC can be generalized to take the imaginary part of the quantum state into account. In this way, the label information encoding is not explicitly executed on a quantum circuit and two sets of data are encoded in a single quantum register, thereby eliminating the state preparation subroutine for preparing the label registers and reducing the number of index qubits. Furthermore, our classifier provides a simple method for assigning arbitrary weights to two training data sets with different labels, which broadens the application of our method to imbalanced data sets in which the number of training data points in two classes are unequal. The CAE also localizes data so that the entanglement is reduced compared to the HTC. Although this finding is only on a numerical basis, we suspect that this is a general feature. This could lead to better performance of the classifier in the NISQ era since less entanglement implies reduced circuit complexity [28\u201331].\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides theoretical backgrounds and reviews for this study, such as the description of the classification problem and the existing kernel-based quantum classifier that has been known to be simplest. Section III explains the main classification algorithm proposed in this work. In Sec. IV, we carry out the entanglement analysis with numerical simulations of classification on Iris and Wine data sets as examples. The simulation results show that the classifier proposed in this work is more compact than the HTC with respect to the amount of entanglement the circuit produces. Section V concludes and discusses future research directions."

Among many machine learning approaches, a kernel method provides a straightforward interpretation of the classification process. It is based on choosing a feature space for the data set such that the classification score is defined as a linear function of the similarity (i.e. kernel) between each training data and the test data. This principle naturally connects quantum computing to kernel-based classification since the quantum Hilbert space can be used as the data feature space with a proper definition of the similarity [15, 24].\nIn this work, we focus on real-valued data as is common in practical machine learning tasks. Moreover, we focus\non binary classification (i.e. L = 2) since a multi-class classification can be constructed with binary classifiers by one versus all or one versus one scheme [32].

In the original paper [25], the weights were chosen uniform, i.e. aj = 1/M \u2200j, while it has been shown [27]\n3 that it can be used as a variable to be optimized, similar to the treatment in support vector machines. Principally, the HTC applies a Hadamard-test as measurement scheme: this applies a Hadamard gate to the ancillary qubit in order to interfere training and test data states. This is finalized by measuring an expectation value of a two-qubit observable \u03c3 (a) z \u03c3 (l) z on the ancillary and label qubit, leading up to\n\u3008\u03c8|H(a)\u03c3(a)z \u03c3(l)z H(a)|\u03c8\u3009 = M\u22121\u2211\nj=0\najyj \u3008x\u0303|xj\u3009 .

[34] as a means to show that the Hadamard gate is the optimal choice for minimizing the number of sampling. In this work, we take a step further and utilize the generalized interference circuit to reduce the quantum circuit cost of the HTC.\nThe generalized interference circuit for the HTC uses Rz(\u03c6)Ry(\u03b80) in place of the first Hadamard gate, and uses Ry(\u03b81) in place of the last Hadamard gate, where Rz(\u03c6) = cos(\u03c6/2)I \u2212 i sin(\u03c6/2)\u03c3z and Ry(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8/2)I \u2212 i sin(\u03b8/2)\u03c3y are the single-qubit rotation gates.

(7) have the same sign, then the real and imaginary parts of the state overlap contributes with opposite sign. Thus by encoding the training data with label +1 (\u22121) to real (imaginary) part of the probability amplitudes of the quantum state, the binary classification can be done without explicitly preparing the label register. This leads to reducing the number of qubits by one. Note that when the number of training data vectors in two classes is the same, cos(\u03c6) = sin(\u03c6) = 1/ \u221a 2. In Sec. III C, we discuss how to control \u03c6 for imbalanced data set. With this background, the compact amplitude encoding (CAE) is introduced to utilize the imaginary part as follows. In CAE, two N -dimensional real vectors x+k = (x + 0k, . . . , x + (N\u22121)k) T and x\u2212k = (x \u2212 0k, . . . , x \u2212 (N\u22121)k) T with the corresponding labels indicated by the superscript (\u00b1) are loaded in a quantum state in the following form,\n|xk\u3009c := N\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n(x+jk + ix \u2212 jk) |j\u3009 , (8)\nwhere \u2016x+k \u20162 + \u2016x\u2212k \u20162 = 1 to satisfy the normalization condition. Note that various scaling methods can be employed to satisfy this condition, and one of the natural ways is to scale each vector so that \u2016x\u00b1k \u2016 = 1/ \u221a 2. We implicitly assume this way of normalizing vectors unless stated otherwise. The above equation shows that two N -dimensional vectors are encoded in dlog2(N)e qubits. The subscript c in Eq. (8) distinguishes the quantum state from amplitude encoding, and indicates that the classical vector is encoded via CAE. It is important to note that |\u00b7\u3009c means two data points are encoded in the state vector, whereas the ordinary ket vector without the subscript c means one data point is encoded. In addition, we define two more states as\n|x\u00b1k \u3009 := 1\n\u2016x\u00b1k \u2016\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nx\u00b1jk |j\u3009 .

It is important to note that \u2211M/2 j=1 bj = 1, and hence the set of weights is different from that of the Hadamard-test classifier which satisfies \u2211M\u22121 j=0 aj = 1. For example, for a set of uniform weights, bj = 2/M and aj = 1/M .

Moreover, since two training data are encoded in one quantum register, the number of terms in the summation is decreased by a factor of 2, meaning that the dimension of the index register is also decreased by a factor of 2.

(16)\nSince the state overlap for the training data in class +1 (\u22121) always have the positive (negative) sign, the above equation can be written in its final form as\n\u3008\u03c3(a)z \u3009 = 1\n2\nM\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nb\u2032jyj\u3008x\u0303|xj\u3009, (17)\nwhere b\u2032m = b \u2032 m+M/2 = bm for m = 0, . . . ,M/2 \u2212 1 and \u2211M\u22121 j=0 b \u2032 j = 2. This outcome is very similar to the classification score in the Hadamard classifier obtained by the two-qubit measurement. The constant factor of 1/2 is attributed to the different normalization conditions between the set of weights bj and aj as described below Eq. (11). We refer to this classifier as compact Hadamard classifier (CHC). The CHC is obtained with a single-qubit measurement implying that one can bypass the standardization of the training data set required in HTC for increasing the post-selection probability. The comparison of quantum circuits for implementing HTC and CHC is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe reduction of quantum circuit sizes, which is of critical importance in practice, achieved with CHC is as follows. By introducing a controllable relative phase between two computational basis states of the ancilla qubit and using compact amplitude encoding, the number of qubits is reduced by two, one for the label register and another in the index register. Then the quantum operations for encoding the training data set is reduced from M gates controlled by log2(M) index qubits to M/2 gates controlled by log2(M)\u22121 index qubits. Having one fewer controlled qubit can further reduce the quantum circuit depth by a factor of two [37]. Therefore, the number of operations for encoding the training data set xj is reduced by a factor of four. The number of operations in CHC is also reduced due to the removal of operations for explicitly encoding the label information in a separate register.

But the number of operation increases linearly with the difference in the number of data with different labels. For example, if \u03b1M and \u03b2M data belong to class +1 and \u22121, respectively, where \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 1, then the number of operations necessary to encode label information grows as |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2|M . Therefore, in total, our compact classifier can reduce the number of operations at least by a factor of four, while the reduction can be larger depending on the label distribution of the given training data set. Furthermore, the two-qubit measurement scheme used in HTC is reduced to single-qubit measurement.\nAs elucidated above, the number of training data vectors in two classes may be different. In this case, the real or imaginary part of the quantum state is simply zero for the missing data. The difference in the number of training data vectors in two classes can later be compensated by controlling the weights between the real and imaginary parts of the state overlap by finding \u03c6 that satisfies\nsin(\u03c6) cos(\u03c6) = M\u2212 M+ ,\nwhere M\u00b1 is the number of training data points in \u00b11 classes.\nTable I presents the classification accuracy of proof-ofconcept experiments. We divided Iris and Wine datasets into training and test sets with a ratio of 80/20 and two classes and used the second and third features of the Iris dataset and the two principal components of the Wine dataset. We performed a search among 40 combinations of four training patterns (two from each class) and selected the combination with the best training accuracy.\nWe used these four selected training points to evaluate the test accuracy. The use of two features and four training points allowed us to perform experiments in a smallscale quantum device. The accuracies and standard deviations in Table I are obtained from 30 repetitions of the random division into training and test sets. The experimental results are from ibmq manila, a quantum computer with five superconducting qubits available on the IBM quantum cloud service."

In principle, this can be done with the state preparation\n\u2223\u2223\u03a6(x\u00b1k ) \u232a c =\n\u2223\u2223\u03a6(x+k ) \u232a + i \u2223\u2223\u03a6(x\u2212k ) \u232a \u221a\n2 , (19)\nwith a feature map U\u03a6(x) |0\u3009\u2297L = |\u03a6(x)\u3009 that maps N - dimensional data to L = O(N) qubits. Of course, the above state must satisfy \u3008\u03a6(x+k )|\u03a6(x\u2212k )\u3009 = 0.

            "text": "Understanding the fundamental source of the quantum advantage is of critical importance for establishing the\nground for further developments of new ideas. The quantum resource we considered in this Section is the entanglement of the system. Besides the fundamental perspective, entanglement is also deeply connected to the quantum circuit complexity. More specifically, it has been reported that lower amount of entanglement required in a quantum algorithm implies reduction in the number of entangling gates during state preparation [28\u201331].\nThe measure of entanglement we use in this work is the Meyer-Wallach [38] measure, which calculates a value linearly related to the mean single-qubit purity of the state [39],\nQ(m)(|\u03c8\u3009) = 2 (\n1\u2212 1 n\nn\u2211\nk=1\nTr[\u03c12k]\n) (20)\nwhere \u03c1k is the single-qubit density matrix obtained by partitioning |\u03c8\u3009 into one qubit and n \u2212 1 qubits. The Meyer-Wallach measure is also occupied in quantifying the entangling capability of a variational quantum circuit due to its scalability and ease of computation [40]. Additionally, we also apply the geometric measure of entanglement [41\u201343] with\nQ(g)(|\u03c8\u3009) = min |\u03c6\u3009 \u2016 |\u03c8\u3009 \u2212 |\u03c6\u3009 \u2016 (21)\nwhere the minimization is over all states |\u03c6\u3009 that are product states, i.e., |\u03c6\u3009 = \u2297nl=1 \u2223\u2223\u03c6l \u232a with each \u2223\u2223\u03c6l \u232a\nbeing a local state. This can be efficiently approximated by Tucker decomposition [44].\nTo compare the Meyer-Wallach and geometric entanglement of the final states of the CHC and HTC, we use the Iris and Wine data sets [45]. We are interested in the value\n\u2206(e) = Q (e) HTC(|\u03c8f \u3009)\u2212Q (e) CHC(|\u03c8f \u3009), e = m, g. (22)\nThe final state of each classifier is created and the measure for entanglement is calculated. The data sets used were primarily chosen for reproducibility and the different feature sizes: Iris has four features (N = 4) and Wine has thirteen (N = 13), for which we pad with zeros excess features due to the qubit nature. Encoding the final state, we use a number of samples of each class M = 2m (for m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) from a test vs. train split of 2/3 train and 1/3 test chosen at random. As both data sets are not binary, we limit data to the first two classes, after all, we are not interested in the actual classification, but in the entanglement structure. The numerical survey shows that the both Meyer-Wallach colorredand geometrical entanglement in the CHC is always lower than that of the HTC for all sample size 2m+1 and each data set. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table II. In particular, the minimum \u2206 of each set shows that the value is always positive, hence the CHC is more resource saving in terms of entanglement. Note that there are several, non-equivalent, measures of entanglement, and a complete survey over all possible measures is beyond the\nscope of this work. Nevertheless, the trend we observed from evaluating two entanglement monotones advocates the compactness of the CHC.\nThe analysis with Iris and Wine data sets asserts that the classifier presented in this work is compact in the sense that it requires less entanglement for binary classification. The observed reduced entanglement has useful consequences. As mentioned in the beginning of this section, the lower entanglement allows for the reduction in the number of entangling gates by exploiting the consequential low Schmidt-rank of bi-partitions [30, 31]. Furthermore, if entanglement is lower, then an approximation with even less entangling operations can be found. We suspect that this can be a useful trait for machine learning protocols, because approximation errors in the state preparation will likely only affect near-decision boundary classifications. Even though the methods de-\nscribed in Refs. [30, 31] are computationally expensive subroutines like singular value decomposition, the reduction in the state preparation complexity can be beneficial in the NISQ era, if the classification error due to the approximation is less than that due to the hardware imperfections and decoherence."

            "text": "This work proposes a compact quantum binary classifier whose quantum circuit size is smaller than that of the Hadamard-test classifier, which was previously considered to be the simplest kernel-based quantum classifier. Thus, our method is placed above existing kernel-based quantum classifiers as the potential application of NISQ computing. The compact quantum classifier is enabled\nHTC(|\u03c8f \u3009)\u2212Q\n(m)\nCQBC(|\u03c8f \u3009). Each value is for a data type and\na number of training data that are indicated in the first row as (data type, number of data). It can be seen that the minimum is always greater than zero. The Iris data set has 4 features, while the Wine data has 13 features. The table exhibits a trend that the entanglement difference decreases as the number of data register qubit increases. The table shows the statistical description using the mean, standard deviation, the minimum and maximum and finally the 25, 50, 75 percentiles.\nby compact amplitude encoding we introduced in this work. This technique encodes one training data point from each class as the real and the imaginary part of the probability amplitude of a computational basis state. Since the label information of training data is implicitly encoded, there is no need to use a separate quantum register to explicitly encode the label information as required in previous methods. The removal of the label register naturally further reduces the two-qubit measurement scheme required in previous methods to the single-qubit measurement. Furthermore, the ease with which unbalanced data can be encoded and the applicability of feature maps is highlighted as good traits for applications. Using binary classification tasks with Iris and Wine data sets, we show that the quantum classifier proposed in this work is compact also in the sense that it requires less entanglement than the Hadamard-test classifier.\nState preparation is responsible for the main cost of CHC, HTC, and many machine learning algorithms. With a reduction in entanglement, one can attempt to create state preparation algorithms that are more efficient than the available alternatives. Reducing the circuit depth of CHC based on this intuition and the number of repetitions to generate a quantum advantage over classical algorithms for big data classification remains an important future work. Another interesting future research direction is to examine the possibility to create compact versions of other machine learning data initialization methods. For instance, some kernel methods as qubit encoding requires one qubit for each data feature. One could investigate how to reduce the required number of qubits without a reduction in the accuracy of a classifier. In addition, understanding the reason behind the reduced amount of entanglement created in the CHC algorithm compared to HTC remains an interesting open question. Answering this question could also help in de-\nsigning a compact version of existing quantum machine learning algorithms. This could also lead to the discovery of quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, analytical analysis of the entanglement difference (\u2206) for the given size of the samples (M) and the features (N) remains to be done. Another interesting question is the condition on the unitary when using quantum feature maps to encode data, both in terms of expressibility and complexity. Since the HTC and CHC construct a binary classifier based on the quantum interference effect, one can speculate that quantum coherence plays a critical role. Quantum coherence can be regarded as a resource, and it has been rigorously studied within the framework of resource theory in Refs. [46\u201348]. Connection between quantum coherence and non-classical correlation has also been studied in Refs. [49, 50]. Performing quantum resource theoretic analysis on the HTC and CHC is also remains as a potential future work.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe source code and data used in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
