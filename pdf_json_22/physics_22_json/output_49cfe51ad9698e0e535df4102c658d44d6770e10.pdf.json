    "abstractText": "As an open system, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) inevitably receives radio frequency interference (RFI) generated by electromagnetic equipment in the same band. The existence of RFI seriously affects SAR signal processing and image interpretation. In recent years, many algorithms and models related to RFI mitigation have been proposed. However, most of that focus on effectively mitigating the RFI is insufficient to protect the useful signals. This article proposes a mitigation method of RFI with a signal-protected capability. (1) The kurtosis coefficient is used to detect RFI pulseby-pulse, and the echoes containing RFI are stored in matrix form. (2) The preliminary extraction of RFI is complete by low-rank sparse decomposition of the echo matrix containing RFI. (3) For the secondary separation of RFI, the accurate position of RFI in the preliminary extraction results is located by the fuzzy C-means clustering; then, we separate the RFI and the remaining useful signals again and reconstruct the useful signals to complete the mitigation work. The proposed method can further protect useful signals while effectively removing interference through the secondary separation of RFI. Experimental results based on simulated and measured data verify the performance and potential of the proposed method.",

            "text": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as an active microwave sensor, can obtain a highresolution and a continuous coverage of ground targets all-day/night and all-weather through the combination of wideband signals in range and a synthetic aperture in azimuth. These characteristics make SAR widely used in military reconnaissance, resource exploration, terrain mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster warning and assessment, and other related fields [1\u20134]. However, SAR is susceptible to various and complex electromagnetic interferences in the operating frequency band as an open broadband system. In general, the signals emitted by other radiation sources in the same frequency band are called radio frequency interference (RFI) to SAR [5\u20138], which can be divided into narrowband interference (NBI) and wideband interference (WBI) according to the bandwidth of RFI. The existence of RFI will seriously restrict the effect of SAR high-resolution imaging and further affect\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143278 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 2 of 22\nthe subsequent application of SAR data, such as crop monitoring and natural disaster assessment [9]. It has become a significant research trend to uncover how SAR can survive in this complex electromagnetic environment while maintaining its excellent performance as much as possible [10,11]. With the development of global radio communications, the electromagnetic environment is becoming more and more complex, and RFI cases in SAR systems are becoming more and more common. Domestic and foreign scholars have proposed various RFI mitigation algorithms and models in recent years [12\u201314]. Among them, the low-rank-sparse model separates interference and useful signals based on RFI\u2019s low-rank-sparse characteristics in the transform domain and has a high RFI mitigation accuracy. However, due to the variety of RFI types, the model will inevitably cause the loss of some useful signals while removing RFI, resulting in the loss of details in the SAR image after RFI removal. Therefore, researching mitigation methods of RFI that can consider both the mitigation accuracy of RFI and the adequate protection of useful signals has significant practical application requirements."

            "heading": "1.2. Previous Work",
            "text": "Effectively mitigating RFI in SAR data has always been an important research topic in the SAR field. Since the 1990s, various RFI mitigation methods have been proposed [15], which can be summed up as parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric methods [16].\n1.2.1. Parametric Methods\nThe parametric methods complete the RFI mitigation work by establishing the mathematical model of RFI and adjusting the model\u2019s parameters. In [17], aiming at the NBI existing in airborne SAR data, the maximum likelihood estimation method was used to mitigate NBI in SAR data by establishing a sine wave model. In [18,19], the NBI model was established based on the narrow-band property of the RFI signal, and a series of RELAX and its improved methods were used to estimate the model parameters, which achieved a satisfactory RFI mitigation effect. In [20], an RFI mitigation method based on the iterative adaptive approach (IAA) and orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) was proposed, which can estimate the RFI power spectrum adaptively and iteratively without a parameter search and model order estimation. The form of WBI is more complex and diverse than NBI, so it is difficult to establish an accurate parametric model. In [21], IAA was successfully applied to WBI mitigation by improving instantaneous frequency (IF) resolution in short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and filtering WBI based on the OSP method. In [22], a WBI mitigation method combining IF estimation and regularized time\u2013frequency filtering was proposed, which completes the extraction and mitigation of sinusoidally frequency-modulated WBI. Since it is challenging to establish parametric models of RFI in practical applications, and the mitigation performance of such methods relies on the estimation of model parameters, the application of parametric methods is not sufficiently extensive.\n1.2.2. Non-Parametric Methods\nThe non-parametric method is based on RFI features in the time domain or transform domain for mitigation without establishing a parametric model. In [23], the frequency domain notch filtering (FNF) was simple to implement and had a strong robustness. However, the FNF will lose the useful signal while eliminating the RFI. In order to solve the above problems, a two-step notch method based on a linear prediction model to compensate for the missing spectrum was proposed [24]. In addition, a time domain notch method by constructing a notch filter in the time domain and using the IAA to recover missing signals was proposed [25], which improved the accuracy of interference mitigation and reduced the loss of useful signals.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 3 of 22\nThe adaptive filtering method separates useful signals from interference by constructing an adaptive filter. In [26], an adaptive spectrum line enhancer was proposed, which can improve the mitigation of time varying NBI. An adaptive Wiener filter was proposed in [27], which achieved better performance than the LMS adaptive filter. The matrix decomposition-based methods, such as eigen-subspace projection (ESP) [28], independent component analysis [29], complex empirical mode decomposition [30], and independent subspace analysis [31], decompose the echo data into useful signal components and RFI components, thereby realizing the mitigation of RFI. The matrix decomposition-based methods can effectively mitigate the NBI and WBI, but these methods are ineffective in the case of weak RFI. Different from the above methods that are mainly applied to SAR level-0 products (raw data), the sub-band spectrum cancellation (SSC) method [32] and the block subspace filtering (BSF) method [33] are non-parametric methods for level-1 products (single look complex data). The SSC method is based on the assumption that the distance spectrum is strictly symmetric. Otherwise, the RFI mitigation performance would drop significantly. BSF is based on the assumption that the RFI-free SAR image conforms to the Gaussian distribution, and the intensity of RFI is higher than the useful signal to ensure mitigation accuracy. In [34], a mitigation method of RFI for SAR images with joint change detection and sub-band spectrum cancellation was proposed, effectively preserving target information while mitigating interference.\n1.2.3. Semi-Parametric Methods\nWith the development of the low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD) algorithm, robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been used in SAR signals for various applications, such as clutter suppression and moving target detection by separating moving and stationary targets in SAR images [35\u201339]. In recent years, the theory of LRSD has been successfully applied to mitigate RFI in SAR data. This method converts complex signal separation problems into hyperparameter optimization problems and forms a semi-parametric mitigation method of RFI. In [40], the concept of semi-parametric interference mitigation was proposed, which completed the mitigation of NBI by solving the sparse reconstruction optimization problem. In [41], the sparse reconstruction algorithm was extended to WBI, providing a new idea for the extended application of these methods. In [42\u201344], a series of low-rank-sparse decomposition models were proposed, further improving the related theories. In [45] a dictionary-based SAR RFI-suppression method under the framework of RPCA was proposed. In [46], a two-dimensional RFI mitigation method was proposed and applied to simulated and measured data successfully. In [47], a graph Laplacian clustering algorithm was proposed to mitigate RFI. In [48], a mitigation algorithm of RFI that combines low-rank and double-sparse features was proposed based on RFI\u2019s low-rank and sparse features. In general, the semi-parametric approaches utilize optimized models to constrain and separate the RFI. However, due to the various RFI types, these models will inevitably cause the loss of some useful signals while removing RFI, resulting in the loss of details in the SAR image. Moreover, with the development of deep learning methods, intelligent learning methods have become an emerging trend in signal processing. Methods based on neural networks, especially combined with RPCA and applied to RFI mitigation in SAR data, have shown superior performance and potential. In [49], a method to mitigate RFI using a special type of convolutional neural network, the U-Net, was proposed. In [50], a mitigation algorithm of NBI and WBI based on the deep residual network (ResNet) was proposed. In [51], a hybrid model-constrained deep learning approach for RFI extraction and mitigation by fusing the classical model-based and advanced data-driven method was proposed. However, these methods are inherently black box, lacking a certain degree of interpretability, and since their performance relies on access to large amounts of data and computational resources, this limits their applicability to scenarios with limited samples.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 4 of 22"

            "text": "Given the above problems, this study makes full use of the low-rank characteristics of RFI in the range frequency domain and proposes a mitigation method of RFI with a signal-protected capability. First, the kurtosis coefficient method is used to detect RFI pulseby-pulse in the range frequency domain, and the echoes containing RFI are stored in the form of a matrix. Second, the RFI is preliminary extracted, which is completed by the LRSD of the echo matrix containing RFI; after decomposition, the low-rank matrix representing RFIs can be preliminary separated. Lastly, for the secondary separation of RFI, we use the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to pinpoint the RFI in the preliminary extraction results, then, we separate the RFI from the remaining useful signal in the low-rank matrix again and reconstruct the useful signal to complete the mitigation. The proposal can further protect useful signals while removing interference through the secondary separation of RFI effectively. Experimental results based on simulated and measured data verify the performance and potential of the proposed method.\nThe main contributions of this article are summarized as follows:\n1. An idea of implementing secondary separation for RFI is proposed, which can solve the insufficient protection of useful signals in traditional mitigation methods of RFI. By separating the extraction results of RFI again, the loss of useful signals can be effectively reduced. In particular, this idea of secondary separation can be extended to other mitigation methods of RFI, which provides a new perspective of RFI mitigation in SAR data; 2. This study proposes a mitigation approach for RFI with a signal protection capability based on the low-rank property of RFI in the range frequency domain. Specifically, the method includes three steps: the detection, extraction, and secondary separation of RFI. Compared with traditional methods, this proposal pays more attention to the preservation of SAR image details while effectively detecting and mitigating RFI, avoiding the situation that the interpretation of SAR images is more difficult due to excessive loss of useful signals after RFI mitigation.\nTheoretical discussions are validated through extensive experiments. Specifically, in experiments with simulated data, the mitigation effect and useful signal protection capability of the proposed method under different bandwidths of RFI and different SINRs are discussed. Experiments with the measured data verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

Signal Model of RFI When the SAR system is working, the raw signal is usually superimposed into the azimuth (i.e., slow time) and the range (i.e., fast time) domain. Since the RFI signal is independent of the SAR echo signal, in each azimuth echo [25], the SAR echo containing RFI can be expressed as \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) = \ud835\udc4b(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) + \ud835\udc3c(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) + \ud835\udc41(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) (1) where \ud835\udc4b(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02), \ud835\udc3c(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02), and \ud835\udc41(\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) represent the useful signal, RFI, and system noise, respectively. \ud835\udf0f and \ud835\udf02 represent the range fast time and the azimuth slow time, respectively. Although there are many different forms of RFI, in general, RFI is considered to be a linear combination of multiple single frequencies caused by radiating sources. According to its bandwidth, it can be divided into two categories: NBI and WBI. As mentioned in [15], NBI can be regarded as the superposition of a series of sinusoidal signals, and its model can be expressed as \ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf02) = \ud835\udc34 (\ud835\udf02) \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d(2\ud835\udc57\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udf0f + \ud835\udf11 ) (2) where \ud835\udc41 represents the number of interference signals. \ud835\udc34 (\ud835\udf02), \ud835\udc53 , and \ud835\udf11 represent the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the \ud835\udc5bth interference signal, respectively. NBI generally does not have a complex frequency modulation, and often appears in the form of bright lines in the image. In contrast, WBI has a larger bandwidth and a more complex frequency modulation, occupying more frequency cells in the range frequency domain. Typically, WBI can be modeled as linear frequency modulation (LFM) and sinusoidal frequency modulation (SFM) [25].

On the Performance of RFI Mitigation for Different SINR Cases\nSimulated experiments based on different SINRs are used to verify the RFI mitigation performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, by comparing the proposal with ESP [28], RPCA [8], and complex tensor RPCA (CT-RPCA) [44] methods, the potential of the proposed method for useful signal protection is further verified. Table 1 summarizes the main system parameters of the simulation. The experimental results of the proposed method compared with ESP, RPCA, and CTRPCA are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen from the first row that the RFI under different SINRs has different degrees of contamination to the SAR image. At the SINR of \u201330, the artifacts caused by RFI significantly suppress scene information. The following four rows are the RFI mitigation results after using ESP, RPCA, CT-RPCA, and the proposed method. As can be seen from Figure 6, all four methods can effectively mitigate RFI under different SINR conditions but have different performances in the protection of useful signals. The magnified region marked with a red box in Figure 6 is the region of interest (ROI), as shown in Figure 7. It can be seen from Figure 7a\u2013d that there are abnormal sidelobe effects on the point targets of the image after RFI suppression using the ESP method, which is due to the loss of useful signals caused by the method over-penalizing the eigenvalues when reconstructing the RFI. Figure 7e\u2013l show the corresponding ROIs after using the RPCA and\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 12 of 22\nCT-RPCA methods. Since these two methods do not further separate the remaining useful signals after the low-rank and sparse decomposition of the SAR signal, the high sidelobe phenomenon still exists to varying degrees. Figure 7m\u2013p show the corresponding ROIs after the proposed method mitigates RFI, and it can be seen that the high sidelobe effect of the point target is no longer present. This indicates that this method can further protect the useful signal while effectively removing RFI.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the performance of the interference mitigation method, the RMSE was selected as the evaluation index to evaluate the mitigation results in the experiment. RMSE is defined as\nRMSE(X, S) = \u2016S\u2212 X\u2016F \u2016S\u2016F\n(25)\nRMSE describes the normalized difference between the original and recovered SAR data. The smaller the RMSE, the better the mitigation performance. Table 2 summarizes the RMSE comparison results of ESP, RPCA, CT-RPCA, and the proposed method under different SINR conditions. The results show that the RMSE of the proposed method is lower under different SINR conditions, which means that the proposed method has a more prominent signal protection performance while mitigating RFI.\nThe best results in each metric are highlighted in bold.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 13 of 22Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 24\nFigure 6.

On the Performance of Mitigation for Different Bandwidths of RFI\nSimulation experiments were used to explore the proposed method\u2019s mitigation performance under different RFI bandwidths and compared with ESP, RPCA, and CT-RPCA methods. The experimental results are shown in Figure 8. From the first row, it can be seen that RFI with different bandwidths has different degrees of influence on the SAR image. When the bandwidth of RFI is 2 MHz, the four methods can effectively mitigate RFI. While the details in the SAR images using the proposed method are clearer, indicating that it is more effective in protecting useful signals, which is verified by subsequent quantitative analysis. When the bandwidth is increased to 4 MHz, the high sidelobe effect caused by the ESP and RPCA methods is more obvious in the SAR images, and the proposed method\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 15 of 22\nstill shows excellent performance. When the bandwidth is increased to 6 MHz, the RFI mitigation performance of the proposed method degrades. The magnified view of the ROI marked by the red box in Figure 8 is shown in Figure 9. It is evident from Figure 9a\u2013c that the loss of useful signal caused by ESP methods becomes more severe as the RFI bandwidth increases. Figure 9d\u2013i show the corresponding ROIs for the RPCA and CT-RPCA method, and it can be found that when the RFI bandwidth is increased from 2 M to 6 M, the high sidelobe effect caused by the loss of useful signal still exists since these two methods only rely on LRSD to extract the RFI. Figure 9j\u2013l shows the corresponding ROI of the proposed method. It can be seen that when the bandwidth of the RFI exceeds 4 M, although the interference mitigation effect of the method begins to decline, the useful signal can still be effectively protected. Table 3 summarizes the RMSE comparison results of ESP, RPCA, CT-RPCA, and the proposed method under different RFI bandwidths."

The performance of different methods for RFI mitigation was evaluated by calculating the gray level entropy and average gradient of SAR images after RFI mitigation.\n4.2.1. Experimental Data Description Figure 10 shows a pseudo color image of the measured Sentinel-1 level-0 raw data. The data were acquired on 12 February 2020. As shown in Figure 10a, the SAR image is heavily contaminated by RFI due to multiple potential sources of interference in the illuminated area. The RFI-corrupted burst is shown in Figure 10b. It can be observed that the artifacts generated by RFI are all over the image.\nFigure 10. RFI-conta inated image of the measured Sentinel-1 level-0 raw data: (a) The pseudo color image of the measured Sentinel-1 level-0 raw data; (b) The RFI-corrupted burst.\nFurther, the mitigation performance of the proposed method was analyzed using gray level entropy and average gradients. The entropy of the image can represent the distribution characteristics of the gray level in the image, indicating the texture complexity, which is defined as\nE = \u2212 L\n\u2211 k=1 Pklog2(Pk) (26)\nwhere E represents the image entropy, L is the total gray level of the image, and Pk represents the probability of the occurrence of a pixel with a gray value of k. The average gradient is defined as\nAG = \u2211Nr\u03c4=1 \u2211 Na \u03b7=1 1 4\n\u221a( \u2202S(\u03c4,\u03b7)\n\u2202\u03c4\n)2 + (\n\u2202S(\u03c4,\u03b7) \u2202\u03b7 )2 (Nr \u2212 1)(Na \u2212 1)\n(27)\nwhere S(\u03c4, \u03b7) represents the position of the pixel in the SAR image, and \u2202S(\u03c4, \u03b7)/\u2202\u03c4 and \u2202S(\u03c4, \u03b7)/\u2202\u03b7 represent the grayscale gradient of the image in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. The above experimental results show that all four methods can mitigate RFI with different performances. The ESP and RPCA methods are prone to abnormal side lobe effects when effectively removing RFI. The CT-RPCA method adds constraints when performing LRSD and can extract and mitigate RFI more effectively. However, it only decomposes the RFI in SAR signals once and has a limited ability to protect useful signals. Compared with the above three methods, the method proposed in this study has a better signal protection ability while effectively removing RFI, consistent with the previous results in this section. Table 4 shows the evaluation metrics for the four methods. It can be seen that the gray\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3278 19 of 22\nlevel entropy and the average gradient of the proposed method are higher than ESP, RPCA, and CT-RPCA, which indicates that the proposed method can more effectively protect the useful signal while mitigating RFI.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 24"

            "text": "The existence of RFI seriously hinders SAR signal processing and image interpretation. However, most existing methods focused on the effective mitigation of RFI, but the protection of the useful signal was insufficient. To solve this problem, this article analyzed the characteristics of RFI in the frequency domain in detail. A mitigation method of RFI with a signal protection capability was proposed, including three steps, i.e., RFI detection, RFI extraction, and RFI secondary separation. In the proposed method, the kurtosis coefficient was used to detect the RFI pulseby-pulse in the range frequency domain. The preliminary RFI extraction was realized by performing LRSD on the echo matrix containing RFI. Then, a binary masking matrix was generated based on the extraction result of RFI, and the RFI and remaining useful signal in the low-rank matrix were separated again. The useful signal was reconstructed to complete the interference mitigation work. Compared with the traditional RFI mitigation method, the proposal considered both the RFI mitigation effect and the protection of useful signals simultaneously. The experimental results based on simulated and measured SAR data showed that this method can protect the useful signal more effectively than the ESP, RPCA, and CT-RPCA methods while mitigating RFI. It is worth noting that protecting useful signals during the mitigation process is as necessary as the RFI mitigation effect. Otherwise, the loss of useful signals will reduce the resolution of SAR images. The proposed method can effectively reduce the loss of useful signals by secondary separation of the RFI extraction results and has great potential in RFI mitigation and useful signal protection. The authors hope that the proposed method can become a valuable tool to solve the RFI problem.\nAuthor Contributions: Formal analysis, H.Z.; methodology, H.Z., J.C. and N.L.; validation, H.Z., L.M., J.L. and J.C.; resources, H.Z., Z.G. and N.L.; writing-original draft, H.Z. and L.M.; writingreview and editing, L.M., J.L., J.C., Z.G. and N.L.; funding acquisition, N.L.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871175; in part by the Foundation of Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Ministry of Education, under Grant RIMP2020003; and in part by the Graduate Education Innovation and Quality Improvement Program of Henan University under Grant SYL20060144.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to all anonymous reviewers and editors for their comments and suggestions, making this article\u2019s content more rigorous and meaningful.
