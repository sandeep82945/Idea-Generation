 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the given paper:

1. Compare pentafecta outcomes between different surgical techniques for prostate cancer (e.g. open vs robotic surgery) to see if one technique results in better pentafecta scores. 

2. Evaluate if preoperative patient education about potential side effects and pentafecta outcomes affects their quality of life assessments after surgery.

3. Develop and validate a patient-reported outcome measure specific to prostate cancer surgery that better captures patients' priorities and perspectives. 

4. Conduct longitudinal studies following patients for 5+ years after surgery to assess long-term pentafecta outcomes and quality of life.

5. Identify preoperative factors (e.g. age, comorbidities, tumor characteristics) that predict pentafecta outcomes to guide surgical decision-making and patient expectations.
