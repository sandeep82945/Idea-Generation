    "abstractText": "Organohydrides are an important class of organic compounds that can provide hydride anions for chemical and biochemical reactions, as demonstrated by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide serving as an important natural redox cofactor. The coupling of hydride transfer from the organohydride to the substrate and subsequent regeneration of the organohydride from its oxidized form can realize organohydride-catalyzed reduction reactions. Depending on the structure of the organohydride, its hydridicity and ease of regeneration vary. Benzimidazoline (BIH) is one of the strongest synthetic C\u2013H hydride donors; however, its reductive regeneration requires highly reducing conditions. In this study, we synthesized various oxidized and reduced forms of BIH derivatives with aryl groups at the 2-position and investigated their photophysical and electrochemical properties. 4-(Dimethylamino)phenylsubstituted BIH exhibited salient red-shifted absorption compared to other synthesized BIH derivatives, and visible-light-driven regeneration without using an external photosensitizer was achieved. This knowledge has significant implications for the future development of solarenergy-based catalytic photoreduction technologies that utilize organohydride regeneration strategies. Transition metal (TM) hydrides are crucial chemical species in organic synthesis and can provide either hydride ions (consisting of two electrons and a proton) or hydrogen atoms (consisting of one electron and a proton) for the reduction of substrates. The transient and repeated generation of TM hydrides occurs in a reduction reaction system, and TMs are often utilized as catalysts. However, the scarcity of TMs has led to the development of metal-free hydrides (organohydrides) exhibiting reactivities similar to those of TM hydrides. In the H\u2013 A bond, the hydrogen atom displays a hydride character when A is more electropositive than hydrogen, as demonstrated by the borohydride species ([R3B\u2013H]), which is one of the most commonly used organohydrides. Although the hydrogen atom in a C\u2013H bond is typically partially positively charged and exhibits limited hydride character owing to the higher",

            "text": "Organohydrides are an important class of organic compounds that can provide hydride anions for chemical and biochemical reactions, as demonstrated by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide serving as an important natural redox cofactor. The coupling of hydride transfer from the organohydride to the substrate and subsequent regeneration of the organohydride from its oxidized form can realize organohydride-catalyzed reduction reactions. Depending on the structure of the organohydride, its hydridicity and ease of regeneration vary. Benzimidazoline (BIH) is one of the strongest synthetic C\u2013H hydride donors; however, its reductive regeneration requires highly reducing conditions. In this study, we synthesized various oxidized and reduced forms of BIH derivatives with aryl groups at the 2-position and investigated their photophysical and electrochemical properties. 4-(Dimethylamino)phenylsubstituted BIH exhibited salient red-shifted absorption compared to other synthesized BIH derivatives, and visible-light-driven regeneration without using an external photosensitizer was achieved. This knowledge has significant implications for the future development of solarenergy-based catalytic photoreduction technologies that utilize organohydride regeneration strategies.\nTransition metal (TM) hydrides are crucial chemical species in organic synthesis and can provide either hydride ions (consisting of two electrons and a proton) or hydrogen atoms (consisting of one electron and a proton) for the reduction of substrates.1-3 The transient and repeated generation of TM hydrides occurs in a reduction reaction system, and TMs are often utilized as catalysts. However, the scarcity of TMs4 has led to the development of metal-free hydrides (organohydrides)5-6 exhibiting reactivities similar to those of TM hydrides. In the H\u2013 A bond, the hydrogen atom displays a hydride character when A is more electropositive than hydrogen, as demonstrated by the borohydride species ([R3B\u2013H]\u2013), which is one of the most commonly used organohydrides. Although the hydrogen atom in a C\u2013H bond is typically partially positively charged and exhibits limited hydride character owing to the higher\nelectronegativity of carbon compared to that of hydrogen (Pauling electronegativity: C 2.6, H 2.2), certain cyclic compounds can serve as hydride donors by acquiring aromatic stabilization upon release of the hydride from the C\u2013H bond.5-6 In nature, the concept of hydride transfer via cyclic compounds is utilized by the enzymatic cofactor reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which serves as a crucial carrier of electrons in biological systems. Living organisms have a mechanism to reduce NADP+, the oxidized form of NADPH, after a reduction reaction, and utilize NADPH as a catalyst. Researchers have taken inspiration from the functions of NADPH to develop reduction reactions using synthetic NADPH analogs, such as the Hantzsch ester.7-10 Additionally, the catalytic use of hydride donors has been achieved by in situ regeneration using reductants.11-14\nBenzimidazoline (BIH) is one of the strongest isolable synthetic C\u2013H hydride donors. Chikashita et al. used a BIH derivative to reduce carbon\u2013halogen bonds at the -position of carbonyl groups and ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.15-16 Lim and Musgrave et al. reported the reduction of CO2 to formate using a BIH molecule.17 The BIH molecule has also been utilized as a potent electron donor in photochemical reactions18-19 since its first use by Hasegawa et al.20 While the BIH molecule was used as a stoichiometric reducing agent in these reactions, its utilization as a catalyst is an attractive research goal. However, the hydridicity of an organohydride is generally inversely proportional to the ease of regeneration from its oxidized form. While BIH has a strong reducing capability, its oxidized form, the benzimidazolium cation (BI+), has a low reduction potential. Therefore, reductive regeneration of BIH requires highly reducing conditions. Lim and Musgrave et al. demonstrated the electrochemical reduction of BI+-Me to BIH-Me in a separate vessel from CO2 reduction (Figure 1b).17 Hasegawa et al. reported photochemical hydrodesulfonylation using a catalytic amount of BI+-1Nap-O- in the presence of stoichiometric NaBH4 (Figure 1c).21 Recently, Glusac22 and our group 23-24 independently reported the photochemical regeneration of BIH (Figure 1d,e). Using photochemical regeneration, metal-free CO2 reduction to formate was achieved (Figure 1e),24 in which the excited state of the carbazole photosensitizer PS2 with high reducing capability25-27 performed the first one-electron transfer in the two-electron reduction process of BI+-Me to BIH-Me.\nIn this study, we aimed to develop a stand-alone hydridic BIH that can be regenerated from BI+ using visible light without the use of an external photosensitizer. We synthesized various oxidized and reduced forms of BIH derivatives with aryl groups at the 2-position, anticipating that the aryl group could exhibit extended -electron conjugation with the benzimidazolium moiety, causing a bathochromic shift in absorption. Herein, we report the synthesis, optoelectronic properties, and photochemical behaviors of these BIH molecules.\nResults and Discussion Synthesis of BI+-Ar and BIH-Ar molecules\nAll BI+-Ar and BIH-Ar molecules were successfully synthesized according to the literature (Figure 2), and the details are described in the experimental section. BI+-Ar molecules, except BI+-Ph-CH2 and BI+-1Nap-O\u2013, were prepared from the corresponding benzimidazoles 1, which were readily synthesized from o-phenylenediamine (Figure 2a). Depending on the identity of the 2-aryl group, a one-step (method a) or two-step (method b) procedure was applied. The counter anion of BI+-Ar was iodide in all cases. BIH-Ar molecules were synthesized from BI+-Ar by reduction with NaBH4. The six BIH-Ar molecules synthesized were sufficiently stable to be characterized under ambient conditions. BI+-Ph-CH2, in which the benzimidazolium moiety and the 2-aryl group are connected through a fused 6-membered ring, was synthesized from 3 and 4 in two steps (Figure 2b). Although the corresponding reduced form BIH-Ph-CH2 was detected by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis in the reduction reaction of BI+-Ph-CH2 using NaBH4, the isolation and characterization of BIH-Ph-CH2 were difficult because of its instability in air. The reason for the instability of this compound will be discussed later in the study. BIH-1Nap-OH and BI+-1Nap-O\u2013 were developed by Hasegawa et al28 as hydrogen atom and/or electron donors and photosensitizers. They were synthesized according to a previously reported method (Figure 2c).\nPhotophysical and electrochemical properties\nThe absorption spectra of the synthesized BI+-Ar molecules in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in Figure 3a. BI+-Ph exhibited the lowest-energy absorption band, with a peak maximum at 280 nm and a peak edge at approximately 320 nm (Figure 3c). The absorption spectra of BI+-Ph-OMe, BI+-Ph-CN, BI+-Ph-1Nap, and BI+-Ph-2Nap were similar to that of BI+-Ph, with peak maxima at approximately 280\u2013300 nm and peak edges at approximately 330\u2013350 nm. The slightly red-shifted absorption compared to BI+-Ph is attributed to the expanded -conjugation on the 2-aryl substituents.\nBI+-Ph-CH2 exhibited further red-shifted and resolved absorption with a maximum peak at 315 nm, which can be attributed to the better -conjugation of BI+-Ph-CH2 compared to that of BI+-Ph, owing to the restricted rotation of the C\u2013C bond between the BI+ backbone and the 2-phenyl substituent. This assumption does not contradict the density functional theory (DFT)-calculated dihedral angles between the BI+ and 2-phenyl -planes of 59 and\n20 for BI+-Ph and BI+-Ph-CH2, respectively. However, the absorption of BI+-Ph-CH2 ceased at 350 nm.\nBI+-Ph-NMe2 exhibited a further red-shifted and broad absorption band with a peak maximum at 345 nm and a peak edge at approximately 400 nm, suggesting that BI+-Ph-NMe2 can absorb visible light (see Figure 3c for comparison with BI+-Ph). The DFT-optimized (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) ground-state structure and the lowest-energy vertical excitation based on the ground-state structure obtained by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31G++(d,p)) for BI+-Ph and BI+-Ph-NMe2 are shown in Figure 4. The calculated values of the longest absorption (274 and 365 nm for BI+-Ph and BI+-Ph-NMe2, respectively) and oscillator strength matched well with the experimental results, giving validity to the following discussion based on this quantum calculation. The dihedral angles between the BI+ and 2-phenyl -planes were 59 and 48 for BI+-Ph and BI+-Ph-NMe2, respectively, suggesting that the -orbitals of the BI+ and 2-phenyl moieties were partially conjugated for both compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of BI+-Ph-NMe2 revealed the dihedral angle between BI+ and the 2-phenyl -plane to be 54, which is close to the value obtained from DFT calculations (48). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of BI+-Ph extended over the conjugated - electron region. The observed lowest-energy absorption of BI+-Ph was ascribed to the -* locally excited (LE) transition because the calculated lowest-energy vertical excitation of BI+Ph was the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of BI+-Ph-NMe2 were relatively localized over the 2-aryl and BI+ moieties, respectively. The calculated lowestenergy vertical excitation of BI+-Ph-NMe2 was the HOMO\u2192LUMO transition; therefore, the observed lowest-energy absorption of BI+-Ph-NMe2 was ascribed to charge-transferred (CT) transition. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap decreased and the absorption wavelength increased because the strong electron-donating property of the NMe2 group affected the HOMO more than the LUMO.\nBI+-1Nap-O\u2013 demonstrated significantly red-shifted absorption reaching approximately 460 nm, reproducing the results of Hasegawa.29 This absorption was ascribed to LE excitation in the 1-naphtholate anion because this long-wavelength absorption was also observed for BIH-1Nap-O\u2013 but not for BI+-1Nap-OH21.\nIn contrast to BI+-Ar, the BIH-Ar series exhibited similar absorption spectra, with the lowest energy peak maximum at approximately 310 nm (Figure 3b). Therefore, with the exception of the redox pairs BI+-Ph-NMe2/BIH-Ph-NMe2 and BI+-1Nap-O\u2013/BIH-1Nap-OH, BI+-Ar exhibited shorter wavelength absorption than BIH-Ar (Figure 3c). This result is counterintuitive because BI+-Ar exhibited a higher degree of unsaturation and aromatization than BIH-Ar. In contrast to BI+-Ph, BIH-Ph demonstrated a perfectly orthogonal relationship\nbetween BIH and 2-aryl planes (Figure 4). The vertical excitation of BIH-Ph is a HOMO\u2192LUMO+2 transition. The HOMO is localized on the BIH plane, while the LUMO+2 corresponds to the mixed * orbitals of the hydridic C\u2013H bond of BIH and the ortho C\u2013H bond of the 2-phenyl substituent. The electronic transitions involving the lowestenergy excitation are thus distinct between BI+-Ar and BIH-Ar, which causes the counterintuitive absorption spectra.\nThe partially conjugated geometry between the BI+ and 2-aryl planes in BI+-Ph and the orthogonal geometry in BIH-Ph (Figure 4) were accounted for by considering the balance between electronic and structural effects. The bulkiness of the 2-phenyl group drives the molecules to adopt an orthogonal geometry to avoid steric repulsion between the 2-phenyl group and the two N\u2013Me groups of the BI+/BIH backbone. Therefore, BIH-Ph had an orthogonal geometry. For BI+-Ph, as the dihedral angle approaches zero, the complex experiences more electronic stabilization through conjugation between the BI+ and 2-phenyl -orbitals, and BI+-Ph adopts a partially conjugated geometry that balances the electronic and structural effects. BIH-Ph-CH2, a reduced hydride form of BI+-Ph-CH2, cannot adopt an orthogonal geometry because of the restricted rotation between BIH and the 2-phenyl rings, making BIH-Ph-CH2 unstable and difficult to isolate (vide supra).\nMost of the synthesized BI+-Ar molecules exhibited structureless broad fluorescence (Figure 5). Only BI+-Ph-CH2, with a rigid structure owing to restricted bond rotation, showed a resolved shoulder peak. The singlet state energies (1ES) of the BI+-Ar molecules were estimated (Table 1) from the fluorescence wavelengths and ranged from 3.40 to 3.94 eV.\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to investigate the electrochemical properties of the synthesized BI+-Ar molecules. The corresponding voltammograms are shown in Figure S2, and the reduction potentials (Ered) are listed in Table 1. Using the Rehm-Weller equation,30 the reduction potential of each molecule in the singlet excited state (1Ered*), which represents the capability of the molecule to accept an electron in its singlet excited state, was calculated. The Ered* values ranged from 1.37 to 2.29 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE).\nBI+-2Nap 3.54 \u20131.56 1.98 BI+-1Nap-O\u2013 3.67 \u20132.30 1.37 BI+-Ph-NMe2 3.40 \u20131.84 1.56\n1ES: Singlet state energies approximated as the high-energy onset of fluorescence (in MeOH at 298 K), where the emission intensity is 10% that obtained at the maximum emission wavelength.31-32 Ered: Reduction potential of ground\u2013state molecules obtained from CV analysis. 1Ered*: Reduction potential of molecules in the singlet excited state calculated using the Rehm\u2013Weller equation.30\nWith the knowledge that BI+-Ar molecules have sufficient oxidizing ability in their excited state (Table 1) and that some of them absorb visible light (Figure 3a), we next investigated the visible-light-mediated generation of the organohydride BIH-Ar from BI+-Ar without using an external photosensitizer (Table 2). LED lamps with max = 400 nm and a light intensity of 270\u2013360 mW cm\u20131 were employed as light sources. Ascorbic acid was initially used as a terminal reductant, with K2CO3 as a base to deprotonate and activate ascorbic acid as a reductant. The reaction mixture was cooled with a fan such that the reaction temperature was below 45 \u2103. First, various BI+-Ar substrates were subjected to photochemical reduction reactions (entries 1\u20139). BI+-1Nap-O\u2013 and BI+-Ph-NMe2, both of which absorbs visible light (Figure 3), afforded BIH-1Nap-OH and BIH-Ph-NMe2, respectively, in moderate yields (entries 8 and 9), while the reactions using the other BI+-Ar molecules barely proceeded (entries 1\u20137) due to the poor absorption of visible light. The mass balances (sum of the yields of BI+-Ar and recovered BIH-Ar) were 67% and 100% for BIH-1Nap-OH and BIH-Ph-NMe2, respectively, indicating that BI+-Ph-NMe2/BIH-Ph-NMe2 can constitute a robust organohydride-recycling photocatalytic system. As suggested in a previous study,24 the observed moderate yield (54%) of BIH-Ph-NMe2 in the photochemical regeneration of organohydrides is not problematic for future application as a catalyst. Control experiments suggested that light irradiation, a base, and ascorbic acid were indispensable for this reaction (entries 10\u201312). Other reducing agents (Et3N, triethanolamine, and Na2SO3) did not provide BIH-Ph-NMe2 (entries 13\u201315), resulting in the complete recovery of BI+-Ph-NMe2.\nTable 2.

The recovered BI+-R yields are shown in parentheses. c In the dark. At 38 \u2103. d No K2CO3\nBased on the experimental results and knowledge obtained from the literature,24 a reaction mechanism is proposed (Figure 6). BI+-Ph-NMe2 is excited with visible light to obtain BI+Ph-NMe2*. Ascorbic acid (H2A) is deprotonated, and the stronger electron donor HA\u2013 is generated. According to the redox potentials E(BI+-Ph-NMe2*/BI\u2022-Ph-NMe2) of 1.56 V (Table 1) and E(HA\u2022/HA\u2013) of 0.47 V,33 the single electron transfer from HA\u2013 to BI+-Ph-NMe2* is sufficiently exergonic and should proceed. According to our previous results,24 the next step is hydrogen atom transfer from HA\u2022 or HA\u2013 to BI\u2022-Ph-NMe2. The calculated driving forces are G0 = \u201314.6 (from HA\u2022) and \u201314.0 kcal mol\u20131 (from HA\u2013), and the activation barrier is G\u2021 =\n15.2 kcal mol\u20131 (from HA\u2013),34 suggesting that the proposed hydrogen atom transfer events to generate BIH-Ph-NMe2 are plausible.\nIn summary, we investigated the visible light-driven regeneration of BIH, a metal-free and powerful hydride donor, without the addition of an external photosensitizer. BI+-Ph-NMe2 was found to be suitable for this purpose, displaying CT absorption up to 400 nm owing to the electron donor and acceptor properties of the NMe2-substituted phenyl and cationic benzimidazolium moieties, respectively, and it was transformed into its reduced form, BIHPh-NMe2, with visible light. Our results demonstrate that strategic structural design allows for the development of organohydrides that can self-regenerate using visible-light energy without the assistance of external photosensitizers. This knowledge is crucial for the future\ndevelopment of catalytic photoreduction technologies that utilize solar energy based on organohydride regeneration strategies.\nExperimental Section Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were conducted in well cleaned glasswares with magnetic stirring. All starting materials were purchased from commercial sources. Melting points were measured on a Yanaco MP-500D and are not corrected. 1H, 13C{1H} NMR spectra (400 and 101 MHz, respectively) were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 400. Residual solvent peak(s) for 1H NMR analysis (CDCl3 (7.26 ppm), MeOD (3.31 ppm), DMSO-d6 (2.50 ppm)) and deuterated solvent peak(s) for 13C{1H} NMR analysis (CDCl3 (77.2 ppm), MeOD (49.0 ppm), DMSO-d6 (39.5 ppm), Acetone-d6 (29.8 ppm)) were used as internal references. The following abbreviations are used in connection with NMR; s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m = multiplet, br = broad. Mass spectra were measured using LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Brehmen, Germany) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). Preparative column chromatography was performed using Kanto Chemical silica gel 60 N (spherical, neutral). Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck 25 TLC silica gel 60 F254 aluminium sheets. The photocatalytic regenerations of BIH-Ar with visible light were performed under self-manufactured LED lamp sets (max = 400 nm).\nSpectroscopy\nUltra visible near-infrared absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature using dilute (13\u201323 M) solutions in spectroscopic grade solvents on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrometer with a 1 cm  1 cm quartz absorption cuvette (light path: 1 cm). Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using dilute (10\u201318 M) solutions in spectroscopic grade solvents on a spectrofluorometer (JASCO FP-6500) with a 1 cm  1 cm quartz absorption cuvette (light path: 1 cm).\nRedox property\nCyclic voltammetric measurements were performed at 298 K on an ALS CHI606S electrochemical analyzer, using 1 mM solutions of analytes in MeCN deaerated by argon bubbling for 30\u201360 min before each measurement. The supporting electrolyte was 0.10 M TBAClO4. A conventional three-electrode cell with a platinum working electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode was employed. The cyclic voltammograms were\nrecorded with respect to the Ag/AgNO3 (10 mM) reference electrode at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s. The reduction potentials (Ered) were corrected to the SCE scale based on the measurement of the Fc/Fc+ couple redox potential as the standard (0.38 V vs SCE).35 For the determination of Ered of the ground state of molecules, when reversible cyclic voltammograms were obtained, standard reduction potentials (E0) were calculated by averaging the forward and reverse peak potentials. When irreversible cyclic voltammograms were obtained, halfpeak potentials (Ep/2), corresponding to the potential at half the maximum current of the cyclic voltammogram, were used as an estimate of E0.36 IR compensation has not been conducted since, using the same setup as employed in the measurements of the analytes, the standard Fc/Fc+ couple current waves appeared with the difference between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials of 70\u201373 mV, indicating that the effect of the ohmic drop on the conclusion of this study should be marginal.\nDFT calculations All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package.37 Geometry optimization for the ground and transition states of molecules was performed by the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) or B3LYP/6-31G(d) DFT method with or without the polarizable continuum solvation model (PCM, acetonitrile) (the applied method for each compound is indicated in the figure captions). The transition state was optimized with Berny algorithm38 and verified by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation.39 Frequency analyses were also carried out to identify the stationary points (no imaginary frequency for the ground state and one imaginary frequency for the transition state were confirmed) and to estimate thermodynamic properties at 298.15 K and 1 atm and Gibbs free energies. The vertical excitation was calculated by the time-dependent (TD)-DFT method using B3LYP functional with 6-31++G(d,p) basis set based on the ground-state geometries optimized by the DFT method.\nX-ray diffraction analysis Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses were conducted using Bruker Apex-II diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector using monochromatic Mo-K radiation (0.71069 \u00c5). All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms were treated as riding atoms, using isotropic displacement parameters. Single crystals of BI+-Ph-NMe2 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained by recrystallization from Et2O/MeOH by vapor diffusion.\nSynthesis and characterization\n2-Phenyl-1H-benzimidazole40-41 In a flame-dried Schlenk tube under an argon atmosphere, o-\nphenylenediamine (2.0401 g, 18.87 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and benzoic acid (3.3862 g, 27.73 mmol, 1.5 eq.) were added.
