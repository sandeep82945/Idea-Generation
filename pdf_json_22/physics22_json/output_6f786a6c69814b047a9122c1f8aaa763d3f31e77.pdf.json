    "abstractText": "M\u00f6bius-ring resonators stem from a well-studied and fascinating geometrical structure which features a one-sided topology, the M\u00f6bius strip, and have been shown to exhibit fermion rotational symmetry with respect to a ring resonator with no twist (which exhibits boson rotational symmetry) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 247701 (2008)]. Here, we present a new type of resonator through the formation of twisted hollow structures using equilateral triangular cross sections, which leads to the realization of a cavity with anyon rotational symmetry. Unlike all previous cavity resonators, the anyon resonator permits the existence of bulk resonant modes that exhibit nonzero electromagnetic helicity in vacuo, with nonzero overlap of the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, R Ep \u00b7 Bpd\u03c4, integrated over the cavity volume. In the upconversion limit, we show that these nonzero helical modes couple naturally to ultralight dark matter axions within the bandwidth of the resonator by adding amplitude modulated sidebands through the axionphoton chiral anomaly. Thus, we show a sensitive ultralight dark matter experiment may be realized by implementing such a resonator in an ultrastable oscillator configuration and searching for signals in the Fourier spectrum of amplitude fluctuations. This removes the typical requirement for an external magnetic field and therefore permits the use of superconducting materials to reduce surface losses and enhance sensitivity to axions.",

Goryachev, and M. E. Tobar Quantum Technologies and Dark Matter Labs, Department of Physics, University of Western Australia,\n35 Stirling Highway, 6009 Crawley, Western Australia\n(Received 28 August 2022; revised 19 May 2023; accepted 11 September 2023; published 29 September 2023)\nM\u00f6bius-ring resonators stem from a well-studied and fascinating geometrical structure which features a one-sided topology, the M\u00f6bius strip, and have been shown to exhibit fermion rotational symmetry with respect to a ring resonator with no twist (which exhibits boson rotational symmetry) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 247701 (2008)]. Here, we present a new type of resonator through the formation of twisted hollow structures using equilateral triangular cross sections, which leads to the realization of a cavity with anyon rotational symmetry. Unlike all previous cavity resonators, the anyon resonator permits the existence of bulk resonant modes that exhibit nonzero electromagnetic helicity in vacuo, with nonzero overlap of the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, R Ep \u00b7 Bpd\u03c4, integrated over the cavity volume. In the upconversion limit, we show that these nonzero helical modes couple naturally to ultralight dark matter axions within the bandwidth of the resonator by adding amplitude modulated sidebands through the axionphoton chiral anomaly. Thus, we show a sensitive ultralight dark matter experiment may be realized by implementing such a resonator in an ultrastable oscillator configuration and searching for signals in the Fourier spectrum of amplitude fluctuations. This removes the typical requirement for an external magnetic field and therefore permits the use of superconducting materials to reduce surface losses and enhance sensitivity to axions.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.108.052014\nI. INTRODUCTION\nChirality is a fundamental property present in many physical systems, which exhibit asymmetry, ranging from particle physics [1\u20133], topological and quantum systems [4\u201310], complex molecules, and chiroptical phenomena [11\u201316]. Many of these occur as surface states, at high energy or frequency, or due to complex metastructures [17\u201319] or plasmonic systems [20,21], which inevitably add loss. Here, we realise a new class of electromagnetic resonator, which we call the \u201canyon cavity resonator,\u201d based on twisted waveguide and \u201cM\u00f6bius-like\u201d structures [22], of twist angle \u03d5, which exhibit monochromatic bulk chiral modes at microwave frequencies with nonzero helicity through a photonic magneto-electric coupling in vacuo. We show the modes couple to axion dark matter as amplitude modulations, without the need for a background field, with near unity form factors and in the ultra-light mass range from 10\u221222 to 10\u221214 eV [23\u201326].\nThis not only significantly reduces the complexity but also allows the possibility of utilizing low-loss superconducting resonators [27\u201330] to search for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) axions. ULDM axions have been shown to solve the standard model strong charge-parity problem [31\u201334], could account for the entire dark matter of the universe [35\u201338], and are usually searched for using putative axion interactions with gluons and neutrons [39\u201342]. These experiments must be maintained for multiple years to search for ULDM, for example a particle mass of 10\u221222 eV corresponds to a frequency of 24.2 nHz with a period of 1.3 years. Upconversion techniques, which utilise two real photon modes with nonzero overlap integral, R En \u00b7Bmd\u03c4 can work in a similar way to the ULDM frequency comparison experiments if they are made near degenerate [43\u201350]. However, feedthrough, mode coupling, nonlinear effects, and injection locking are likely to limit the minimum frequency detuning between two modes, so they are not configurable for ultralight axions.

The normalized helicity in (1) can range between 1 and is tied to the conservation of Zilch [59], or photonic chirality [15] and is usually considered when photons interact with chiral molecules or materials [12,14,15]. Analogously, the axion is calculated to couple to photons through a chiral anomaly, whether in condensed matter physics [6,8] or in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [31,33,34,60] and the introduction of the axion as a modification to Maxwell\u2019s equations in fact introduces a nonzero Zilch to the equations of motion."

            "text": "We investigate two twisted triangular cavity configurations as depicted in Fig. 1: (a) a linear twisted resonator with electrically conducting boundary conditions at the ends, which allows arbitrary twist angle, \u03d5, and (b) a twisted ring resonator similar to a M\u00f6bius strip, with only discrete allowed \u03d5 values (\u03d5 \u00bc Z\u03c0=3). It has been previously demonstrated that a M\u00f6bius ring resonator with rectangular cross section and \u03c0 twist angle exhibits fermion rotational symmetry with respect to the boson rotational symmetry of a ring resonator with no twist angle [22]. This can be understood by considering some 2D function confined to the resonator\u2019s cross section; in the ring resonator, the function is invariant under one full cycle of the cavity circumference, while in the M\u00f6bius configuration it requires two full cycles. In the triangular ring system depicted in Fig. 1(b) we observe that such a 2D\nfunction confined to the cavity cross section (the arrow head) is invariant after three rotations. Furthermore, considering the linear case of Fig. 1(a), we are free to set the twist angle \u03d5 to any value, and therefore some 2D function will be invariant after 2\u03c0=\u03d5 cycles of the cavity (3 lengths are required for invariance in the depicted case). Thus we can state that such systems exhibit anyon rotational symmetry."

            "text": "In the linear resonator of Fig. 1(a), by introducing the twist angle \u03d5 the resonator\u2019s mirror symmetry is broken and the resulting geometry is chiral; right handed for \u03d5 > 0 and left handed for \u03d5 < 0. This geometry dictates the boundary conditions which are used to solve Maxwell\u2019s equations for the resonant electromagnetic modes within this volume. The introduced mirror asymmetry of the boundary conditions results in a magnetoelectric coupling [61], which acts to couple the degenerate TE and TM modes of the untwisted cavity together into a new orthogonality basis. This can be alternatively interpreted as a dual transformation [57] of the no-longer orthogonal E and B fields into a new orthogonality basis E0 and B0 which are some combination of the original fields. The result is that as a function of twist angle, the new eigenmodes of the cavity have some nonzero E \u00b7 B product and henceH p, and are asymmetrically detuned in opposite directions from their untwisted frequencies. The origin of this mode tuning can be thought of as a normal mode splitting between two coupled harmonic oscillators and the sign of the resulting helicity reflects the phase with which they are coupling. When considering the emergent helicity of the modes when twisted, there are two impacting factors of the cavity cross section\u2014the polygon order and the symmetry. In regards to the former, the equilateral triangle is the lowest order polygon of the dihedral group of regular polygons [see Fig. 1(c)] and as such, least approximates a circle. One can imagine the two resonators depicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) with a circular cross section; they would not appear any different from a cylinder or torus cavity, respectively. Therefore it reasons that the greatest impact of the twisting angle \u03d5 will be generated by the lowest order regular polygon. This is further demonstrated in Fig. 2(a) as the greatest magnitude helicity modes in cavities with D3 to D5 polygon cross-sections are shown as a function of twist angle. The two D3 modes (one that tunes up and one that tunes down in frequency) approach near unity helicity, while higher order cross-sections result in smaller values. The symmetry of the cross section also plays an important role, as a perfectly symmetric cross section (i.e., equilateral triangle, square etc.) results in TE and TM modes being tuned coincident in frequency with one another. Just like any coupled mode system, hybridization\n052014-2\nof the two individual systems is greatest when their frequencies are made degenerate. This is true for the helicity of the hybrid mode here, as demonstrated by Fig. 2(b), in which one of the vertex lengths is multiplied by some factor \u03b1, and we observe that helicity is maximized for the equilateral case. To confirm the expected frequency splitting in the linear resonator as \u03d5 is varied, we 3D printed three aluminium prototypes with right handed twist (\u00feve\u03d5) using selective laser melting, using a similar method to previously reported superconducting cylindrical cavity resonators [27]. These resonators have a length of 150 mm and their cross section has a vertex length of 20 mm. The experimentally obtained transmission spectra are measured at room temperature through coaxial probes placed at the cavity end faces and are plotted in the z-axis of Fig. 3, which sit above the spectra obtained from finite element modeling (FEM). We note exceptional agreement between the frequency locations of the resonant modes and the predicted tuning from the simulations. The lowest order mode with high helicity has a bandwidth of \u03ba \u2248 4.1 MHz, invariant of \u03d5, consistent with a surface resistance of Rs \u223c 470 m\u03a9 at room temperature."

            "text": "Next we consider the case of bending the two end faces of the resonator around and forming a ring as shown in Fig. 1(b); removing two metallic boundaries from the resonator and therefore allowing modes with lower loss. In addition to the resonant frequencies, the electromagnetic helicity and geometry factor [62], Gp \u00bc Q0pRs, whereQ0p is the unloaded quality factor of the modes, can be obtained from the FEM. The results are presented in Table I for the greatest negative and positive helicity modes, and demonstrate a factor of 3 improvement in Q-factors for the ring resonator compared to the linear version. However, our attempts to 3D print a ring resonator require two separate parts to be made, which require a knife edge for optimum electrical connectivity, which will need to be considered carefully to attain the predicted Q-factors. For comparison, the TE011 mode in a cylindrical resonator has a G-factor of the order 700 and the TM010 mode is of order 300 [27], so Q-factors in the anyon cavity resonator, if limited by material surface resistance will have approximately an order of magnitude larger Q-factors.\nTABLE I.

The 3D printed aluminium has previously achieved an Rs of 0.2 m\u03a9 at 10 GHz at mK temperatures [27], which would mean a Q-factor of 107 is initially possible. For axion detection, a lower frequency obtainable with increased area of cross section and volume, and a lower Rs will enhance the sensitivity. A comparison of the helicities of the resonant modes in the linear and ring cases are presented in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the greatest jH pj \u223c 1 modes occur at the same frequency for both resonators, which is the cutoff frequency for the TE11 and TM11 mode families [63,64]. The key difference between the two resonators is seen for this mode branch: it is only the first few modes in the linear case which have large jH pj, while there are numerous high helicity mode candidates in the ring case. This is a result of the lack of end-face boundary conditions permitting both sin and cos azimuthal field dependences in the ring case, one of which is forbidden in the linear case. In the latter, as the number of axial nodes increases, the field overlap between the sin (TE) and cos (TM) modes is largest for the first few modes and then drops, while in the ring, the field overlap integral can be maintained as both sin and cos solutions are permitted for both original polarizations. In both forms of the resonator, the lower frequency modes with cutoff frequency \u223c10 GHz\nhave no TM counterpart and therefore do not achieve unity jH pj."

            "text": "The previously studied dual-mode upconversion experiment excites two modes in one cavity, with a pump mode and a readout mode [50], where the pump mode acts as a background field, which interacts with the putative axion dark mater background to generate photons or frequency perturbations at the readout mode frequency. This experiment is similar, except only the implementation of a single mode is necessary because the mode acts as its own background field and thus in the upconversion limit is sensitive to ultra light dark matter axions. The best way to configure such upconversion experiments is as a frequency stabilized oscillator locked tightly to the axion sensitive cavity as shown in Fig. 6, here we propose two possible configurations similar to what was experimentally considered in [50], except without the complication of the extra pump mode. A variety of phase detection techniques are possible for both configurations, including the use of\n052014-7\ninterferometric [73\u201376] and Pound modulated systems [77] to significantly reduce the oscillator phase noise. To calculate the phase noise in oscillators commonly one considers the Lesson effect, which degrades the close to the carrier phase noise. However, it has been shown that the equivalent Leeson effect is much smaller for amplitude noise [78]. Thus, this experiment gains at low Fourier frequencies as the amplitude noise fluctuations are much smaller in this regime, with better than Sam \u00bc \u2212160 dBc=Hz possible at low Fourier frequency offsets. Usually one can lock the oscillator to one in parts of 107 of the line width. For such oscillators there will be essentially no measurable frequency-to-amplitude noise conversions. To optimize the sensitivity to axions, ways to reduce the oscillator amplitude noise must be implemented, which are compatible with the frequency stabilization techniques. The estimates of possible sensitivities are detailed in Fig. 7. These sensitivities are attained by solving equation (25) for ga\u03b3\u03b3 as a function of axion frequency fa \u00bc \u03c9a=2\u03c0, setting SNR \u00bc 1, assuming critical mode coupling \u03b2p \u00bc 1, jH pj \u00bc 1, \u03c9p=2\u03c0 \u00bc 1 GHz, the cold dark matter density \u03c1a \u00bc 8 \u00d7 10\u221222 kg=m3 (i.e., 0.45 GeV=cm3), c the speed of light and the spectral density of the oscillator amplitude fluctuations is assumed to be \u2212160 dBc=Hz [78]. Sensitivities for different values of cavityQ-factorQp are shown over the range discussed in the text. In actual fact, if we consider the full quantum electromagnetodynamic modifications to electrodynamics [69,70], the\nexperiment will put a limit on ga\u03b3\u03b3 \u00fe gaMM [71,72], which we show in Fig. 7. This calculation does not include systematics, which with careful design of the oscillator should be able to be eliminated, the experimental research program will include identifying these effects, such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and magnetic sensitivities. This approach has been undertaken previously using oscillators for other tests of fundamental physics, such as tests for Lorentz invariance violation, Local position invariance and tests on fundamental constants, with continuous oscillator measurements over multiple years [79\u201381]. Thus with careful design and measurement we believe there is high probability of attaining these fundamental limits, which will mainly depend on the achievable value of cavity Q-factor. Other ways to experimentally increase the signal to noise ratio are possible, including constructing multiple arrays of oscillators and the use of cross-correlation techniques [82], in general, resonant frequencies should be close, but would not need to be tuned to the same frequencies when using modern noise measurement systems."

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that an electromagnetic field with nonzero helicity, H p will be sensitive to ULDM axions. This unique property in an electromagnetic resonator is achievable using hollow, twisted triangular devices in either a linear or ring configuration. FEM has demonstrated that the eigenmodes of such systems do indeed produce jH pj \u223c 1 for particular modes, and that these modes in fact tune in frequency as a function of twist angle \u03d5. Three discrete \u03d5 valued linear resonators are 3D printed and demonstrate excellent agreement with predicted mode frequencies. If theoretically achievable Q-factors are attained, an ultrastable oscillator based off one of these anyon cavity devices would permit the world\u2019s most sensitive search for axion dark matter in the ultralight mass range."
