    "abstractText": "Despite curcumin (CUR) inhibiting cell proliferation in vitro by activating apoptotic cell death, its use in pharmacological therapy is hampered by poor solubility, low stability in biological fluids, and rapid removal from the body. Therefore, CUR-derivatives with better biological and chemical\u2013physical characteristics are needed. The bis-ketone moiety of CUR strongly influences its stability in slightly alkaline solutions such as plasma. Here, we considered its replacement with isoxazole, beta-enamine, or oxime groups to obtain more stable derivatives. The evaluation of the chemical\u2013physical characteristics showed that only of the isoxazole derivatives 2 and 22 had better potential than CUR in terms of bioavailability. The UV\u2013visible spectrum analysis showed that derivatives 2 and 22 had better stability than CUR in solutions mimicking the biological fluids. When tested on a panel of cell lines, derivatives 2 and 22 had marked cytotoxicity (IC50 = 0.5 \u03bcM) compared with CUR only (IC50 = 17 \u03bcM) in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived K562 cell line. The derivative 22 was the more selective for CML cells. When administered at the average concentration found for CUR in the blood of patients, derivatives 2 and 22 had potent effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis initiation, while CUR was ineffective. The apoptotic effect of derivatives 2 and 22 was associated with low necrosis. In addition, derivative 22 was able to reverse drug resistance in K562 cells resistant to imatinib (IM), the reference drug used in CML therapy. The cytotoxicity of derivative 22 on IM-sensitive and resistant cells was associated with upregulation of FOXN3 and CDKN1A expression, G2/M arrest, and triggering of apoptosis. In conclusion, derivative 22 has chemical\u2013physical characteristics and biological effects superior to CUR, which allow us to hypothesize its future use in the therapy of CML and CML forms resistant to IM, either alone or in combination with this drug.",

            "text": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease caused by a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (called Philadelphia chromosome) resulting in the fusion of two genes, ABL1 (Ch9) and BCR (Ch22). The chimeric product of this fusion (BCR-ABL oncogene) is a protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity leading to uncontrolled proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and promotion of invasion. Although the development of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib (IM), dasatinib, and nilotinib has led to significant progress in CML therapy, resistance occurs in patients with advanced disease [1]. IM is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2356. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032356 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2356 2 of 17\nprotein tyrosine kinase approved for the treatment of CML. In pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and CML patients, IM reached plasma concentrations between 0.4 and 2 \u00b5M. However, these values were not always sufficient to exceed the in vitro tyrosine kinase inhibitory concentration (1 \u00b5M) and to normalize the hematologic parameters in the patients [2]. Curcumin (CUR), a natural compound present in turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), is a promising therapeutic agent currently being tested in several human clinical trials [3]. Many studies have shown its anti-proliferative and anti-carcinogenic activities on animal and human cell lines [4,5]. Although it was very promising in terms of anti-cancer potential [6], the molecule had limited intestinal absorption, was poorly soluble in aqueous solutions [7], and unstable due to the breaking of the bonds between C4 and C5 [8]. Indeed, in biological fluids, the molecule undergoes structural modifications, such as the shift of the keto-enol tautomer towards the enol form [9,10], and the conversion into ferulic acid and feruloyl methane and then into vanillin and acetone [8,11], with renal elimination of by-products [12]. Furthermore, CUR undergoes glucuronidation on the hydroxyls present in the aromatic ring by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, whereby it is excreted from the body [13,14]. Due to these limitations, the blood levels observed in human clinical studies ranged from 0.4 to 3.6 \u00b5M [15]. Since CUR showed antiproliferative activity in the concentration range between 5-80 \u00b5M in in vitro assays [3], the hematic level of CUR did not appear sufficient to obtain a therapeutic result. Therefore, CUR-derived analogues and delivery systems have been proposed in an attempt to improve its bioavailability [16\u201319]. One of the aspects to take into consideration in improving the bioavailability of CUR is its stability in biological weakly basic pH solutions. The instability of the molecule was due to the bis-ketone moiety [9], wherein C4 becomes deprotonated at slightly alkaline pH, causing the bond between C4 and C5 to break and the by-products to form [8,20,21]. Therefore, the replacement of the bis-ketone moiety with groups capable of decreasing the acidity of the hydrogen in C4 could be useful to confer ameliorated stability to the CUR-derivatives. In this study, to obtain more stable derivatives, bis-ketone substitutions with isoxazole ring, \u03b2-enamine ketones and oximes in the CUR molecule were considered. The stability of the CUR-derivatives in biological fluids and the drug-like characteristics were studied. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis-triggering effects of the derivatives were also studied in CMLderived K562 cell lines sensitive or resistant to IM."

Moreover, in our previous studies, the transformation of the bis-ketone of CUR to an isoxazole ring led to derivatives with improved stability toward nucleophilic reactions [22]. Therefore, the molecules shown in Figure 1 were studied. The isoxazole, \u03b2-enamine ketone and oxime derivatives were produced using a synthetic procedure similar to that described in [23]. In derivatives 2, 22, and 24, the bis-ketone was replaced by an isoxazole. In derivative 24, the introduction of three methoxy groups at the 3, 4, and 5 position of each benzene ring resulted in the removal of the 4-hydroxyl group. This modification should preserve the derivative from glucuronidation, lengthening its permanence in the bloodstream [14]. In derivatives 40, 41, and 42, the bis-ketone has been replaced by a \u03b2-enamine ketone, and in derivative 128, by an oxime. All molecules were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nInt. J.

For this aim, the modifications of the UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum at different incubation times were evalua ed. The optical density values relating to the peak of greatest absorption of each derivative were studied to compare the stability of the derivatives. The values in each time point were expressed as a percentage with respect to the value observed at the initial time (Figure 2). The correlation betw the stability of th molecule and its structure h s given better knowledge of whi h molecular ubstitutions confer greater stability to the derivatives. This information could be useful for the design of stable second-generation molecules with increased cytotoxicity. Derivatives 24, 40, 42, 128 were stable molec les even in the absence of albumin, while almost all other derivatives, with the exception of 41, were more stable than CUR in the presence of albumin. This feature suggested their possible stability in biological fluids such as plasma. Substitution of the bis-ketone moiety with isoxazole rings, \u03b2-enamine ketones or oximes were present in these molecules. Therefore, all substitutions increased the stability of the derivative and could serve for the future design of stable second-generation molecules with improved cytotoxicity. In addition, the simultaneous modification of groups linked to the aromatic rings or the opening of the isoxazole ring reduced their stability. For example, among the derivatives with \u03b2-enamine ketone (40, 41 and 42), only the derivative with a small functional group bonded to N (41, isopropyl) was unstable, while the others with a bulkier group (40, toluene; 42, ethylbenzene) were stable even in the absence of albumin. Consequently, the introduction of a large N-linked group appears to be a prerequisite for obtaining future stable \u03b2-enamine ketones.\nInt. J. Mol.

In this work, we additionally tested the cytotoxicity of CUR and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2356 5 of 17\nits derivatives indicated above on a larger panel of cancer cell lines, including K562 (CML), TE85 (osteosarcoma), MG63 (osteosarcoma), TT (thyroid carcinoma), Colo38 (melanoma), SK-ChA-1 (cholangiocarcinoma), and Mz-ChA-1 (cholangiocarcinoma). Furthermore, the additional derivatives 22, 24, and 128, which have not yet been studied elsewhere, were tested. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of each derivative, and the IC50 concentration was determined after 72 h (Table 1).\nCUR and its derivatives had a cytotoxic effect on the panel of tumor cell lines tested and it was possible to obtain the IC50 value from the dose-dependent growth curves. From the comparison of the IC50, all derivatives were more active than CUR on the CML-derived K562 cell line, while on the other tumor cell lines tested, they showed cytotoxicity that was comparable, slightly higher, or even worse than CUR. Therefore, the modifications introduced seemed to give the derivative selectivity towards the K562 cell line. On these cells, derivatives 2 and 22 had identical cytotoxicity (IC50 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M), about 34 times more than CUR (IC50 = 17 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M). The derivatives 40, 41, 42, and 128 had slightly higher IC50 values, between 1.2 and 1.9 times more than CUR. The derivative 2 was more active with respect to CUR also in the TT and MG63 cell lines by about 3-fold. Similar behaviour was previously seen in HA22T/VGH and MCF7 cancer cell lines but with higher IC50 values (CUR vs derivative 2: 17.4 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 12.8 \u00b1 1.5 on HA22T/VGH; 29.3 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 13.1 \u00b1 1.6 on MCF7) [23]. In contrast, derivative 22 had cytotoxicity comparable to CUR in the TT and MG63 cell lines. Therefore, while derivative 2 showed a broad spectrum of action, the strong cytotoxic effect of derivative 22 was restricted to the CML-derived K562 cell line. With regards to the structure\u2013function relationship, the cytotoxicity of the derivatives on the K562 cell line improved by replacing the bis-ketone with an isoxazole (in 2 and 22, but not in 24), an \u03b2-enamine ketone (in 40, 41, and 42) or an oxime (in 128). Among the isoxazole derivatives, the 3-methoxy group in the aromatic rings did not affect the cytotoxicity in CML cells, since its removal in derivative 22 gave rise to a molecule as potent as derivative 2. Conversely, the presence of the 4-hydroxyl group could be determinant. In fact, in derivative 24, which lacks this group, the modifications introduced made the molecule very stable, and probably resistant to glucuronidation, but worsened the cytotoxicity. Therefore, the presence of a 4-hydroxyl group has to be considered in designing future isoxazole derivatives. As for derivatives containing a \u03b2-enamine ketone (40, 41, and 42) or oxime (128), they were always less active than isoxazole derivatives on CML-derived cells. Taken together, these results indicated that the molecules with the greatest cytotoxicity in CML cells were derivatives 2 and 22, with the latter being particularly cytotoxic to CML cells. Interestingly, in clinical studies, CUR has reached blood levels between 0.4 and 3.6 \u00b5M [15]. Therefore, if derivatives 2 and 22 were able to reach levels of bioavailability even only comparable to that of CUR, they should also reach the cytotoxic concentration in vivo.\nInt. J. Mol.

To this end, K562 cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 2 \u00b5M CUR or derivatives 2 and 22. This concentration was chosen as it represented an intermediate blood value of CUR found in clinical studies. As a reference, 0.15 \u00b5M IM (IC50 value) or DMSO was used. The cells were divided into two aliquots. The first was stained with PI and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3). The results indicated that derivatives 2 and 22, at a 2 \u00b5M concentration, had marked cytotoxicity associated with a catastrophic effect on the cell cycle. A very pronounced increase in the sub-diploid peak indicated cycle exit and cell death, as occurred in cells that had undergone IM treatment. In contrast, CUR at this concentration did not produce significant differences compared to control cells treated with DMSO alone. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether the derivatives were able to trigger apoptosis. For this purpose, the cells from the second aliquot were stained with AnnexinV and processed by flow cytometry (Figure 4). The derivatives 2 and 22 triggered significantly elevated levels of apoptosis (sum of early and late apoptosis) compared with cells treated with DMSO alone as well as the control sample treated with IM. Treatment with CUR also showed a significant difference in apoptotic cells, mainly due to the increase in the number of still viable cells in the early stage of apoptosis. For derivatives 2 and 22, the level of necrotic cells was comparable to that present in the DMSO-treated control sample. From a speculative point of view, these results suggested that if the derivatives were to have bioavailability values even comparable to the CUR, they should exert a more important pharmacological effect than the latter.\nInt.

In subsequent experiments, 0.5 \u00b5M IM was always added to the medium of K562(R) cells. To verify whether t e resistance of K562(R) was due to the increased expulsion f the drug, the expr ssion of the genes ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP) which are ommonly implicated in drug resistance was evalu ted by RT-PCR. After 30 cycl s of amplification, the products were visualized by agaros gel electr phor sis. Only ABCC1 was appreciably expressed in these cells. Subsequently, by Real Time RT-qPCR analysis, the expression levels of this gene were compared in K562(S) before and after treatment with 0.5 \u00b5M IM and in K562(R) cultured in the presence of 0.5 \u00b5M IM. The expression level of ABCC1 in K562(S) cells was comparable to that present in K562(R) cells and did not undergo changes in levels following IM treatment. Therefore, the IM-resistance acquired by K562(R) cells did not appear to be associated with increased drug excretion, but rather was attributable to other mechanisms. The cytotoxicity of CUR and its derivative 22 on K562(R) and K562(S) cells was studied in a way similar to that described for IM (Figure 6). From the results, it emerged that CUR and derivative 22 were cytotoxic in both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant cells. Although the cytotoxic concentrations of CUR and derivative 22 were different at >32 \u00b5M and >1 \u00b5M, respectively, each of the two molecules was equally active in both IM-sensitive and IM-resistant cell lines. Therefore, both CUR and derivative 22 were capable of reversing IM-resistance in CML cells.

Dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) gene expression was associated with drug resistance [31\u201333]. FOXN3 (forkhead box N3; check point suppressor 1) belongs to the forkhead box (FOX) protein family. FOXN3 is involved in cell cycle regulation and its expression decreased in many types of cancers [34]. FOXN3 expression facilitated DNA damage repair and G2/M-phase arrest [35]. In K562(S) cells, the treatment produced a small but significant increase in CDKN1A expression, whereas in IM-resistant cells its level decreased even in the presence of IM. The reduction of CDKN1A expression in IM-resistant CML cells was compatible with a drug-resistance mechanism supporting cell proliferation. Therefore, the reversing effect of derivative 22 on IM-resistance that determined the accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase was consistently associated with a significant increase in CDKN1A expression (Figure 8). In K562(S), IM in cytotoxic concentrations produced a marked increase in FOXN3 expression, associated with the reduction of cell proliferation. Furthermore, in K562(R), which were insensitive to the same cytotoxic concentration of IM at which they normally proliferated, the increase in FOXN3 level was quite small and associated with the resumption of proliferation. In resistant cells, cytotoxic concentrations of derivative 22 increased FOXN3 expression in association with G2/M-phase cell cycle blockade (Figure 8). Therefore, the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects of derivative 22 could be due to the increased transcription of the FOXN3 and CDKN1A genes, through a yet unclear mechanism."

            "text": "Curcumin (CUR) is a natural molecule suggested for the treatment of many human pathologies [3]. Many studies have shown that it has anti-proliferative and anti-carcinogenic activities in animal and human cell lines [4,5]. However, CUR does not reach sufficient blood levels to have an effective pharmacological effect [36]. The inability of the molecule\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2356 11 of 17\nto reach effective doses limits its therapeutic application in spite of its multiple molecular targets and enormous anti-tumor potential [6]. From the analysis of clinical trials carried out on solid and blood tumors [36], it emerged that CUR blood concentration in humans oscillates between 0.4\u20133.6 \u00b5M [15], while the biological effects produced in vitro, such as the triggering of apoptosis, require much higher concentrations (5\u201380 \u00b5M) [3]. Our results also confirmed the need for CUR concentrations above 34 \u00b5M to obtain an effect on cell proliferation in CML cells. The modest blood values observed in the clinical trials were due to low intestinal absorption, reduced solubility/stability in biological fluids, and accelerated metabolism. With regards to the latter, CUR is removed from the bloodstream through the glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyl group of the aromatic ring mediated by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and the consequent biliary excretion [13,14] but also following its degradation and elimination of by-products through the kidney [12]. In this respect, the derivative 24 containing the substitution of the hydroxyl group with a methyl group in the aromatic rings should lengthen its permanence in the circulation. However, the substitution significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of the derivative compared to CUR, underlining the importance of the 4-hydroxyl group on the intrinsic cytotoxicity of the molecule. In addition, increasing the stability of the CUR could represent a way to increase its blood level. In fact, at slight alkaline physiological pH, CUR was unstable due to the presence of the bis-ketone group [7,20,37,38]. Therefore, we explored the improvements obtained after replacing the bis-ketone moiety with isoxazole, \u03b2-enamine ketone, and oxime. All substitutions stabilized the molecule in physiological pH albumin solution and, at the same time, improved the cytotoxicity of the derivatives on the K562 cell line. These features suggested their possible improved stability and cytotoxicity in biological fluids such as plasma. In particular, for the isoxazole derivatives, which were all stable, the presence of the 4-hydroxyl group, but not of the 3-methoxy group, was decisive for the cytotoxicity of the molecule in CML cells. The derivatives 2 and 22 were particularly cytotoxic to CML cells with IC50 values of 0.5 \u00b5M, which suggest they could possibly also reach cytotoxic concentrations in vivo. From a speculative point of view, if these derivatives had a bioavailability even comparable to CUR, which in clinical studies reached blood levels between 0.4 and 3.6 \u00b5M [15], the 2 \u00b5M concentration at which derivatives 2 and 22 exerted their cytotoxic, cell cycle inhibitory, and pro-apoptotic effects in vitro, could also be easily achieved in vivo. Furthermore, these derivatives showed better predicted bioavailability than CUR and were more stable, so they could reach even higher blood concentrations. The therapy for CML improved dramatically with the advent of IM, which is now the first-line therapy drug, inducing long-term survival rates above 90%. However, about a quarter of patients develop resistance at some point during therapy [39]. Drug-resistance phenomena are accompanied by therapy failure even when large doses of the drug are administered [40]. Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are the most frequent mechanisms of acquired resistance development [41]. A derivative of CUR, C817, which acts on drug-resistant CML cells, has been recently described. This molecule inhibited the activity of Bcr-Abl and was active in patients who carried mutations in the imatinib binding domain [42]. However, other IM-evasion mechanisms can cause drug resistance. One of them is the resistance due to the reduced intracellular drug accumulation by increasing its expulsion, as occurs in CML cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (ABCC1), and the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) [43]. Another mechanism of IM resistance is target-independent resistance, in which the survival and proliferation of resistant cells is independent from the Bcr-Abl kinase activity [44]. The complexity of the drug resistance phenomenon requires further studies aimed at identifying new molecules capable of blocking the different evasion mechanisms. CUR is a very interesting molecule for the development of new drugs to be used in IM-resistant patients, since it is not very toxic and is well-tolerated by the human body, and because it has a broad spectrum of action, which allows it to modulate numerous biological pathways. However, as mentioned earlier, it is\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 2356 12 of 17\nvery unstable and reaches only low levels in the blood. Since derivative 22 was shown to induce apoptosis in IM-responsive CML cells, we evaluated whether it could be also active in IM-resistant CML cells. The derivative 22, sensitized IM-resistant cells similar to CUR but at sub-micromolar concentrations, showing comparable cytotoxicity in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant cells. This cytotoxicity was due to G2/M-phase cell cycle blockade and activation of apoptosis. K562(R) cells, selected by us through the progressive culture in increasing IM concentrations, did not show increased expression of the transporter genes ABCC1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 compared with sensitive cells, so the IM-resistance mechanism was not associated with reduced intracellular drug accumulation by increasing its expulsion. In contrast, IM resistance in K562(R) was associated with dysregulated expression of the CDKN1A and FOX3N genes, which are implicated in cell survival and cell proliferation [45\u201347]. The CDKN1A gene encoded for the p21 (CIP1/WAF1) protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is capable of inhibiting all cyclin/CDK complexes and needed for G2/M transition [45]. Deregulated CDKN1A expression was associated with cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [31], and with paclitaxel resistance in melanoma [32]. In IM-sensitive K562 cells, the treatment also produced a small significant increase in CDKN1A expression, whereas in IM-resistant cells its level was decreased even in the presence of IM. The reduction of its expression in IM-resistant cells was compatible with a drug-resistance mechanism supporting cell proliferation. In IM-resistant cells, treatment with derivative 22 significantly increased CDKN1A expression, reversing the suppression that occurs during resistance acquisition. In a similar manner, in NSCLC, cisplatin-pemetrexed combined treatment upregulated CDKN1A expression [33]. Since the treatment with 22 was associated with G2/M arrest and triggering of apoptotis, we believe it likely that the derivative exerted its cytotoxic effect through upregulation of CDKN1A. The FOXN3 gene belongs to the forkhead box (FOX) protein family. FOXN3 is involved in cell cycle regulation and facilitates G2/M-phase arrest [35]. Its expression is reduced in many types of cancers and its upregulation decreased protein synthesis and cell proliferation in tumor cell lines, while reduced levels increased tumor cell proliferation [34,47]. Accordingly, in K562(S), IM cytotoxic concentrations produced a marked increase in FOXN3 expression which was associated with reduced cell proliferation. In K562(R), which were insensitive to the same cytotoxic concentration of IM, the increase in FOXN3 level was quite small and associated with the recovery of proliferation. Therefore, the downregulation of this gene was part of the mechanism leading to IM resistance. In resistant cells, the treatment with derivative 22 upregulated FOXN3 expression, an event associated with G2/M-phase cell cycle accumulation, thus reverting the IM resistance."

Osteosarcoma cell lines were isolated from a 14-year-old patient (MG63) and a 13-year-old patient (TE85) [51]. The Colo38 cell line was isolated from a 67-year-old female patient affected by melanoma [52]. The K562 cell line was grown in RPMI, while the other cell lines were grown in DMEM. Cell culture media were completed with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), streptomycin 100 \u00b5g/mL, and penicillin 100 U/mL.
