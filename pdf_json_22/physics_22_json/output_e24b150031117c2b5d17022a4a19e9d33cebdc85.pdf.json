    "abstractText": "The evaporation of Primordial Black Hole (PBH) via Hawking radiation influences the evolution of Inter Galactic Medium by heating up the latter and consequently affects the 21cm signal originated from the neutral Hydrogen atoms. In this work, we have considered EDGES observational data of 21cm line corresponding to cosmic dawn era to constrain the mass and the abundance of PBHs. In this context, two different PBH mass distributions namely, power law and lognormal mass distributions are considered to estimate the effects of PBH evaporation on the 21cm brightness temperature T21. In addition to these two mass distributions, different monochromatic masses are also considered. The impacts of Dark Matter baryon interactions on T21 are also considered in this work along with the influences of PBH evaporation. Furthermore, adopting different monochromatic masses for PBHs, an attempt has been made to formulate a distribution for PBH masses by associating a probability weightage of the T21 values (at z \u223c 17.2), within the range given by EDGES experiment, with the calculated T21 values for each of the PBH mass values. The distribution best suited for the present purpose is found to be a combination of an error function and Owen function. Allowed contours in the parameter space of (initial PBH mass-dark matter mass) are obtained.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe 21cm hydrogen spectrum is obtained due to the transition between two hyperfine spin states (s = 0 and 1) of neutral hydrogen atoms. Since hydrogen occupies about 75% of the baryonic mass of the Universe, the 21cm hydrogen spectrum could be an important probe to Cosmos in general and cosmic processes of the dark age and reionization epoch in particular. The observational results of 21cm line is generally expressed in terms of the brightness temperature T21 of 21cm line which is dependent on the background radio temperature (in this work the background temperature is CMB temperature T\u03b3), spin temperature of the hydrogen gas Ts (Ts is the excitation temperature of the hydrogen gas) and optical depth \u03c4 of the gas and it is defined as,\nT21 = Ts \u2212 T\u03b3 1 + z (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) . (1)\nTherefore, 21cm spectrum show absorption or emission signal if Ts < T\u03b3 and Ts > T\u03b3 respectively. Observational outcomes of EDGES\u2019s (Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature) has become a remarkable probe in exploration of several unknown cosmic phenomena of the cosmic dark age. EDGES experiment reported excess absorption trough in T21 signal corresponding to cosmic dawn epoch around z \u2248 17. According to the standard cosmological scenario, the brightness temperature at z \u2248 17 is obtained about \u2212200 mK but EDGES experiment observed that 21cm brightness temperature during cosmic dawn is T21 = \u2212500+200\u2212500 mK at z \u2248 17. Consequently, in order to explain the observational outcomes of EDGES, a certain amount of additional cooling is required, which essentially appears in the form of baryon-DM scattering [1]. However, other heating/cooling effects such as PBH evaporation [2\u20135], annihilation [6\u20139] and decay of Dark Matter candidates [4, 10, 11] etc. may perturb the global\n\u2217 upala.mukhopadhyay@saha.ac.in \u2020 debasish.majumdar@saha.ac.in \u2021 ashadul.halder@gmail.com\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n13 00\n8v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n1 N\nov 2\n02 2\n2 21-signal remarkably. In spite of its popularity, the EDGES results are suffered from controversies [12\u201314]. Recently, SARAS 3 has challenged the EDGES results with 95.3% confidence level [15]. Despite of this recent controversy, in this work we use EDGES result to represent any global 21cm excess absorption signal [16].\nOn the other hand, Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) has been the centre of interest for decades in several aspects of astrophysics and cosmology. PBHs are believed to be generated as an outcome of the collapse of the over density regions in the early epochs of the Universe [17\u201320]. However, besides the standard scenarios, there are few alternative conjectures for addressing the formation of PBHs, namely, collapse of domain walls and cosmic strings [21\u201323], fragmentation of scalar condensation [24\u201326], confinement of quark pairs (which are first pushed apart by inflation and then confined after re-entering the horizon) [27] etc. PBHs may be substantially smaller in mass in comparison to the stellar-mass black holes [3, 4, 16, 28]. As a result, the Hawking radiation [29] from such black holes (BHs) are significantly prominent. Therefore, the phenomenon of PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation may be a promising tool in the exploration of several aspects of this hypothetical candidate of the black hole. The emitted particles in the form of Hawking radiation heat up the baryonic medium and thus could influence the global 21cm signature.\nIn the present analysis, we attempt to study the mass distribution of PBHs in the context of the global 21cm signal. As it is suggested from recent studies that extended mass distribution of PBH could be favourable, we essentially focus on two special types of distribution function namely, power-law mass distribution [30, 31] and lognormal mass distribution [30, 31] and find constraints on the distribution parameters using the observed limit of EDGES experiment( \u2212500+200\u2212500 mK ) .\nIt should be mentioned here that in this work the effects of Dark Matter - baryon (DM - baryon) scattering on the 21cm spectrum are also taken into account. The cooling effect due to baryon - DM interaction essentially governed by the baryon - DM scattering cross-section, given by \u03c3\u0304 = \u03c30(v/c)\nn, where v is the velocity and c denotes the velocity of light in space. The index n in the above expression depends on different physical processes. In the case of DM candidates having magnetic dipole moment, the index n is considered as n = +2,\u22122 and n = 2, 1, 0,\u22121 while the scattering in presence of Yukawa potential [32] is considered. On the other hand, for millicharged DM candidate [33, 34], n = \u22124 is chosen. The variation of baryon-DM cross-section is addressed in Ref. [35] for a wide mass range of DM. Similar studies have also been carried out in Ref. [36\u201338]. In the present analysis, cross-section \u03c3\u0304 is parameterized as \u03c3\u0304 = \u03c30(v/c)\n\u22124 [1, 39, 40] where the term \u03c30 is the absolute scattering cross-section of DM - baryon scattering. Several recent phenomenological studies on the global 21cm signal also suggest the similar velocity dependence (n = \u22124) of the baryon-DM cross-section [1, 37, 38, 40, 41]. However in this work we consider \u03c30 \u223c 10\u221241cm2.\nAlong with constraining the parameters of two possible mass distributions of PBHs (power law and lognormal) with EDGES like results, we also propose a distribution of PBH mass based on the EDGES observation. In this particular case, we evaluate the weight factor at every PBH mass by computing the brightness temperature of 21cm hydrogen line and comparing that with the EDGES result.\nWe discuss the imprints of PBH on 21cm line in section II while in section III the impacts of DM - baryon scattering on the spectrum are discussed and temperature evolutions are briefly described in section IV. The calculations and results are furnished in section V and finally in section VI summary and discussions are given.\nII. IMPRINTS OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES ON THE 21CM LINE\nIn this section, we give a brief account of the energy injection of PBHs due to Hawking radiation on IGM. This can affect the evolution of IGM and thus the 21cm brightness signal."

These particles, emitted from relatively low mass PBHs (MBH < 10\n15 g), can interact with IGM and thus consequently modify the 21cm brightness temperature [3\u20135, 42].\nThe rate of mass loss of a PBH having mass MBH due to Hawking radiation is given by [4, 29],\ndMBH dt \u2248 \u22125.34\u00d7 1025 \u2211 i \u03c6i ( MBH g )\u22122 g sec\u22121 , (2)\nwhere the coefficient \u03c6i denotes the evaporation fraction of the i-th particle. The total evaporation fraction is calculated as [43],\n3 \u2211 i \u03c6i =1.569 + 0.569exp ( \u22120.0234 TPBH ) + 3.414exp ( \u22120.066 TPBH ) + 1.707exp ( \u2212 0.11 TPBH\n) +0.569exp\n( \u22120.394 TPBH ) + 1.707exp ( \u22120.413 TPBH ) + 1.707exp ( \u2212 1.17 TPBH ) +1.707exp\n( \u2212 22 TPBH ) + 0.963exp ( \u2212 0.1 TPBH ) . (3)\nTherefore, the total evaporation rate is dependent on the temperature of PBH (TPBH) which is defined as TPBH \u2248 1.06\u00d7 ( 1013g MBH ) GeV [29].\nThe energy injection rate per unit volume due to the evaporation of PBH is computed as [43],\ndE\ndV dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 PBH = \u2212dMBH dt nPBH(z) , (4)\nwhere nPBH(z) is the number density of PBHs at redshift z and defined by [3],\nnPBH(z) \u2248 1.46\u00d7 10\u22124\u03b2BH(1 + z)3 ( MBH,i\ng\n)\u22123/2 cm\u22123 .

            "text": "In order to compute the energy injection of PBHs by using the above Eq. 4, it is considered that PBHs would have monochromatic mass distribution i.e., all the PBHs would be of identical masses, but some recent studies suggest that extended mass distributions would rather be favourable [30]. For such extended mass functions of PBHs the energy injection rate per unit volume is calculated as,\ndE\ndV dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 total = \u222bMmax Mmin dMBH g(MBH) dE dV dt \u2223\u2223 PBH\u222bMmax\nMmin dMBH g(MBH)\n, (6)\nwith g(MBH) being the mass distribution function of PBHs. In the above expression Mmin and Mmax are the minimum and maximum value of the chosen mass spectrum of PBHs. Hence, in this work we have considered two theoretically motivated mass distribution functions of PBHs namely, power law mass distribution [30] and lognormal mass distribution [30].\nIn order to simplify our calculation, we break the entire mass distribution into 500 bins in logarithmic scale within the chosen mass range. The masses of the midpoints of each bins are MBH,i, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 500. So now Eq. 6 takes the form,\ndE\ndV dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 total = \u2211500 i=1 g(MBH,i)\u2206Mi dE dV dt \u2223\u2223 PBH, forMBH,i\u2211500 i=1 g(MBH,i)\u2206Mi , (7)\nwhere \u2206Mi is the bin width of the i th bin. Note that Eq. 7 is in fact mass evolution equation of PBH (given in Eq. 2) but to be evaluated for 500 different PBH masses and then to be summed over. Power law mass distribution of PBHs arises from the scale invariant density fluctuations or from the cosmic string collapse [30] and this mass distribution function is expressed as [30, 31, 44],\ng(MBH) = \u03b3 M\u03b3max \u2212M\u03b3min M\u03b3\u22121BH , (8)\nwhere \u03b3 represents the power law index and Mmax and Mmin denote maximum mass limit and minimum mass limit of PBHs respectively. The power law index (\u03b3) is related to the equation of state (\u03c9) at the time of PBH formation with\n4 the relation \u03b3 = \u2212 2\u03c91+\u03c9 [45]. Since PBH formations are assumed to take place at post inflationary time, the values of power index \u03b3 would be \u03b3 \u2208 {\u22121, 1}.\nOn the other hand, lognormal mass distribution of PBHs is considered when PBHs are formed from a smooth symmetric peak in the inflationary power spectrum [46]. The lognormal mass function is defined by [30, 31, 44],\ng(MBH) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3MBH exp\n( \u2212 ln 2(MBH/\u00b5)\n2\u03c32\n) , (9)\nwhile \u00b5 and \u03c3 are respectively the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution. Such mass function of PBHs is first observed in Ref. [47] to address a mechanism of PBH formation for a model of baryogenesis. Later some authors have discussed this type of PBH mass distribution both theoretically and numerically [48].\nIII. IMPACTS OF DARK MATTER - BARYON INTERACTION ON THE 21CM LINE\nIn this work we have also considered the impacts of the interaction between Dark Matter (DM) and baryonic matter on the 21cm signal. In literature it is discussed that due to DM - baryon interaction, baryon can transfer heat to the colder DM fluid and hence influence the evolution of 21cm brightness temperature [40, 49]. Moreover, the relative velocity (V\u03c7b) between DM and baryon fluid would also affect the 21cm line [1] as the tendency to damp their relative velocity will heat up both of the fluids. Hence, in this work we have considered both of the above mentioned effects of DM - baryon interaction on the 21cm line. The heating rate of baryon can be evaluated from Ref. [1] as,\ndQb dt = 2mb\u03c1\u03c7\u03c30e \u2212r2/2(T\u03c7 \u2212 Tb) (m\u03c7 +mb)2 \u221a 2\u03c0u3th + \u03c1\u03c7 \u03c1m m\u03c7mb m\u03c7 +mb V\u03c7bD(V\u03c7b) , (10)\nHere, \u03c1\u03c7, \u03c1m are energy densities of DM and total matter respectively while T\u03c7 and Tb denote DM temperature and baryon temperature respectively. The masses of DM and baryon are represented by m\u03c7 and mb. In the above equation, the first term on the r.h.s arises from the temperature difference of DM and baryon (T\u03c7\u2212Tb) and the second term originates due to the velocity difference (V\u03c7b) between them. The drag term D(V\u03c7b) is calculated as [1],\nD(V\u03c7b) \u2261 \u2212 dV\u03c7b dt = \u03c1m\u03c30\nmb +m\u03c7\n1\nV 2\u03c7b F (r) , (11)\nwhere r \u2261 V\u03c7b/uth, u2th \u2261 Tb mb + T\u03c7 m\u03c7 and F (r) \u2261 erf ( r\u221a 2 ) \u2212 \u221a 2 \u03c0 e \u2212r2/2r. The parametrization \u03c3\u0304 = \u03c30v \u22124 for interaction cross section of DM and baryon fluid is considered for this calculation. The heating rate of DM ( dQ\u03c7 dt ) can be obtained by interchanging \u03c7\u2194 b in Eq. 10."

The fractional abundance of He is denoted by fHe while the free electron abundance is xe = ne/nH (me and c is the electron mass and the speed of light). The third term on the r. h. s of Eq. 13 includes the effect of energy injection from PBHs due to Hawking radiation where KPBH is expressed as [4, 42, 51\u201353],\nKPBH = \u03c7hf(z) 1\nnb\ndE\ndV dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 total , (14)\n5 with \u03c7h = (1 + 2xe)/3 being the fraction of the emitted energy contributes to the heating of IGM and the parameter f(z), stands for the ratio of the total amount of deposited energy to the energy injected to the medium due to PBH evaporation [54\u201358].\nTo compute the evolution of baryon temperature, the evolution of free electron fraction xe is needed to be calculated simultaneously.

(17)\nSince Eqs. 12, 13, 15, 17 and 7 are all coupled, we need to solve these five equations simultaneously with proper initial conditions to compute the evolutions of baryon temperature Tb and thus to obtain the 21cm brightness temperature. Now, the spin temperature Ts, defined by the ratio of the number densities of Hydrogen atoms in spin triplet and spin singlet states (n1/n0 = g1/g0 exp(\u2212h\u03bd/kTs)), is calculated from the expression [62],\nT\u22121s = T\u22121\u03b3 + ycT \u22121 b + y\u03b1T \u22121 \u03b1\n1 + yc + y\u03b1 .

            "heading": "A. Lognormal Mass Distribution of Primordial Black Hole",
            "text": "Lognormal distribution of PBH masses is considered in this section to study the effects of PBH energy injections and DM - baryon interactions on 21cm brightness temperature. In Fig. 1(a) evolutions of Tb (solid lines in the plot)\nand corresponding spin temperature Ts (dashed lines in the plot) with redshift z are plotted for different values of DM mass (m\u03c7= 0.5 GeV, 1 GeV) and different mean values of the distribution (\u00b5= 5\u00d71014 g and 1.5\u00d71014 g). It can be noted from Fig. 1(a) that a smaller gas temperature Tb (and Ts) is obtained at the reionization epoch when a larger value of \u00b5 (\u00b5= 5.0\u00d71014 g) is considered for a fixed value of m\u03c7 (m\u03c7 = 0.5 GeV). It indicates the fact that the energy injection rates of PBHs with smaller masses are higher than the same with larger masses. Hence, PBH mass distribution with a lower mean value can inject larger amount of energy in the IGM compared to the distribution with a higher \u00b5. From Fig. 1(a) it can also be observed that IGM temperature decreases with the decrease of m\u03c7. This is however expected from Eq. 10 since the cooling rate of the baryon is inversely proportional to DM mass [39].\nSimilar comments can be made from Fig. 1(b) where the variations of 21cm brightness temperature T21 with z are shown for different mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c3 values. Here also it can be observed that more negative values of T21 can be obtained for larger values of \u00b5 as energy injection rates are smaller for heavier PBHs. It can also be observed from Fig. 1(b) that larger T21 is obtained when \u03c3 = 0.3 is considered (indigo line in the Fig. 1(b)) when compared with the same with \u03c3 = 0.6 (green line in Fig. 1(b)) where the mean value is fixed at \u00b5 = 2\u00d7 1014 g. It can be mentioned here that we have repeated the calculation by fixing \u00b5 = 1015 g and have found that smaller T21 is obtained for \u03c3 = 0.3 than when \u03c3 = 0.6 is considered. This indicates that PBHs with smaller masses . 1014 g evaporate before z \u223c 17.2 and thus contributions for lighter PBHs are not significant. But for \u00b5 = 1015 g, the distribution with larger variance \u03c3 = 0.6 includes larger range of PBH masses with significant contributions from the smaller masses. It may be mentioned here that black hole evaporation calculations include correction terms before full evaporation.\nOne of our main focuses of the current work is to provide bounds on the parameters of PBH mass distributions and on the initial mass fraction of PBH \u03b2BH. In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 the allowed regions of \u03b2BH\u2212\u00b5 plane and \u03b2BH\u2212\u03c3 plane are shown for different values of m\u03c7 ((a) m\u03c7 = 0.1 GeV, (b) m\u03c7 = 0.3 GeV, (c) m\u03c7 = 0.5 GeV and (d) m\u03c7 = 1.0 GeV) by considering EDGES observational results. Upper bounds and lower bounds of \u03b2BH, \u00b5 and \u03c3 are estimated by using the EDGES limit on brightness temperature of 21cm line of reionization epoch i.e., at z ' 17.2 value of T21 is T21 = \u2212500+200\u2212500 mK. We compare our calculated values of T21 at z ' 17.2 with EDGES limit ( T21 = \u2212500+200\u2212500 mK\n) to compute the constraints on the parameters and hence show the calculated T21 at z ' 17.2 with a different notation T z=17.221 with colour bars in Figs. 2, 3. It is clear from Fig. 2 that larger initial mass fractions of PBH can be probed for mass distributions with higher mean values. It is expected as energy injection rate of PBH is inversely proportional to their mass value and hence larger abundance of heavier PBHs are still compatible with the EDGES results. It can also be noted from the figure that \u03b2BH decreases with the decrement of \u00b5 up to a certain value \u00b5 \u223c 2 \u00d7 1014 g and then it starts to slightly increase. This is showing that PBHs with mass less than \u223c 2\u00d7 1014 g evaporate before z / 20 and thus their contributions in IGM heating at z / 20 are comparatively lower. From Fig. 2 it is also noted that for lower values of m\u03c7 the allowed region (the coloured region showing the allowed range between the upper limits and lower limits of the parameters) in \u03b2BH \u2212 \u00b5 is very narrow but the lower limit increases significantly with the increment of DM mass while the upper limit varies very slightly with m\u03c7. Similar constraints on \u03b2BH \u2212MBH plane are observed for monochromatic mass distribution of PBH in Ref. [67]. For smaller m\u03c7 (m\u03c7 = 0.1 GeV, 0.3\nGeV) the effects of DM - baryon interaction on T21 are very high and hence T21 fall beyond the EDGES\u2019s lower limit (less than -1000 mK) and consequently the lower limits of \u03b2BH \u2212 \u00b5 plane become stringent. As larger DM - baryon interaction rate can be acquired for smaller m\u03c7, larger PBH abundance can be probed in these cases and hence the upper limit slightly decreases when m\u03c7 increases. Similar conclusion can be drawn from Fig. 3 that allowed regions in \u03b2BH \u2212 \u03c3 plane increase with mass of DM m\u03c7. In Fig. 3 it can be noted that larger values of \u03b2BH are allowed at smaller values of \u03c3. This is expected because larger variance (\u03c3) indicates the inclusion of larger mass range of PBHs with lower mass values and higher evaporation rate. It can be mentioned that DM - baryon interaction cross section \u03c341 (in the unit of 10\n\u221241 cm2) is kept at \u03c341 = 1 for the plots in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. While in Fig. 2 the value of \u03c3 is fixed at \u03c3 = 0.5, in Fig. 3 the value of \u00b5 is fixed at \u00b5 = 5 \u00d7 1014 g. The same computations are repeated for other values of \u03c341 (say for \u03c341 = 5) and extended allowed ranges of the parameters are obtained for larger \u03c341 values."

The calculated value of T21 at redshift z ' 17.2 is denoted by T z=17.221 and is represented by the colour bars in the plots. The allowed zones of the \u03b2BH \u2212 \u03b3 parameter space are estimated for different chosen values of DM masses (Fig. 4(a) m\u03c7 = 0.1 GeV, Fig. 4(b) m\u03c7 = 0.3 GeV, Fig. 4(c) m\u03c7 = 0.5 GeV and Fig. 4(d) m\u03c7 = 1.0 GeV). It can be observed that for m\u03c7 = 0.1 GeV, the narrowest allowed region of \u03b2BH \u2212 \u03b3 is obtained among the four cases and the lower limits of the allowed region drop significantly with the increment of DM mass values. This can have similar explanation as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Moreover, it can be observed from Fig. 4 that \u03b2BH slightly decreases as the power index \u03b3 increases and hence \u03b2BH depends on the formation time of the PBH. The value of \u03b3 is varied from \u2212 12 to 1 2 in\nFig. 4 which corresponds to the variation of the equation of state \u03c9, or the formation epoch of PBHs, from 13 to \u2212 1 5 . It can be noted from Fig. 4 that maximum value of \u03b2BH is obtained for \u03b3 = \u2212 12 or \u03c9 = 1 3 which corresponds to the equation of state of the radiation dominated epoch. Therefore, the Fig. 4 estimates that a larger initial mass fraction of PBH (thus larger initial abundance of PBH) is obtained if the formation time of PBH is radiation dominated epoch and the abundance decreases slightly if the PBHs formation take place at later epochs (\u03b3 > \u2212 12 )."

V A and V B respectively), which are widely used in literature.\n10\nIn this section considering different PBH masses MBH and their monochromatic distributions, we attempted to construct a probability distribution function of PBH masses by utilizing the weightages of different values of 21cm temperature within the extent of T z=17.221 values furnished by EDGES experiment at z = 17.2.\nDifferent probability distribution functions for different MBH for fixed values of \u03b2BH can be constructed by utilizing the EDGES 21cm result at reionization epoch. The EDGES result indicates 21cm brightness temperature T21 = \u2212500+200\u2212500mK. One can construct a distribution probability weightage (G21) of the T z=17.221 in the range \u2212200 \u2264 T z=17.221 \u2264 \u22121000mK obtained from EDGES experiment, where this probability distribution fixed at T z=17.221 = \u2212500mK. The temperature T z=17.221 that a PBH with a particular monochromatic mass MBH and a given of \u03b2BH would result a 21cm brightness temperature T z=17.221 on evaporation. From the probability weightage (G21) plot of T z=17.221 , the probability weightage for the value of T z=17.2 21 calculated for a fixed MBH \u2212 \u03b2BH pair can be obtained. Thus an analytical map of weightage probability of T z=17.221 on the distribution of MBH\u2212\u03b2BH pair can be constructed. Therefore for a fixed value of \u03b2BH, a mapped distribution of MBH (infact MBH vs G21) is obtained from MBH - \u03b2BH - G21 constructed using the procedure described here.\nThe EDGES result for T21 and its allowed extent are used to obtain the final form of such a proposed distribution. The distribution and analysis described in Sect. II - IV are utilized to propose and explore this analytical distribution by PBHs. As has been discussed earlier, the EDGES observation has reported the brightness temperature at the redshift z \u223c 17.2 is T21 = \u2212500+200\u2212500 mK with 99% confidence level. Consequently, the probabilities of different brightness temperature within the range \u22121000 mK \u2264 T21 \u2264 \u2212300 mK can be computed at that epoch.\nFirstly, a basic skew normal distribution for T z=17.221 (see Eq. 20) is fitted in such a way that, the peak of the distribution lie at \u2212500 mK and 99% of this distribution lies within the range \u22121000 mK \u2264 T z=17.221 \u2264 \u2212300 mK while the individual probabilities at T21 = \u2212300 mK and at \u22121000 mK are equal.\nThe fitted skew normal distribution (SND) function given by,\nG21 =\n( 1 + erf ( \u03b11(T z=17.2 21 \u2212 \u00b51)\u221a\n2\u03c31\n)) exp ( \u2212 (T z=17.2 21 \u2212 \u00b51)2\n2\u03c321\n) , (20)\nwhere the fitted parameters are \u00b51 = \u2212405.708, \u03c31 = 223.35 and \u03b11 = \u22123.90017 (in the above equation T z=17.221 is T21 at redshift \u223c 17.2). It is to be mentioned that, the above expression (Eq. 20) describes only the probabilities of brightness temperature T z=17.221 (i.e., T21 at z ' 17.2). The relation between PBH mass and T z=17.221 is to be calculated numerically for different chosen DM mass (m\u03c7) and PBH initial mass fractions (\u03b2BH). Eq. 20 is graphically described in Fig. 5. In this plot the 99% C.L. region of the probability distribution function G21 for T z=17.2 21 in the range -1000 mK 6 T z=17.221 6 -300 mK are shown by the green region. It is to be noted that G21 at both the boundaries (i.e. \u2212300 mK and \u22121000 mK) are kept equal.\nIn order to obtain analytical form of the probability distribution of PBH masses, the values of T z=17.221 are numerically calculated for different PBH masses (MBH) by solving coupled equations (Eqs. 2, 12, 13, 15 and 17) for each possible combinations of PBH parameters by considering monochromatic distribution of PBHs. In this case we adopt the\n11\nprocedure and corresponding equations as introduced in Ref. [67]. In the entire calculation we choose the DM mass m\u03c7 = 0.5 GeV and \u03c341 = 1 as benchmark values.\nIn Fig. 6 the variations of T z=17.221 and correspondingG21 for different massesMBH of PBHs are graphically described. Fig. 6(a) addresses the variation of T z=17.221 vs PBH mass MBH for different initial mass fractions of primordial black holes \u03b2BH. Different values of \u03b2BH are represented by the lines of different colours, where the corresponding values of \u03b2BH are shown by the colour bar, given at the right of top panel of Fig. 6. The corresponding G21 vs MBH plots are furnished in Fig. 6(b). Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) are similar except that in Fig. 6(b) the variaitons of G21 with MBH are shown. The plots if Fig. 6(b) are generated by identifying T z=17.221 value corresponding to G21 value (from Fig. 5 or Eq. 20) and then following the same procedure to obtain Fig. 6(a). Similar representations of T z=17.221 vs \u03b2BH and corresponding G21 vs \u03b2BH for different chosen values of MBH are shown in 6(c) and 6(d) respectively. From Fig. 6(a) (and also from Fig. 6(b)), it can be noticed that, for lower values of \u03b2BHs all the T z=17.2 21 vs MBH graphs suffer certain discontinuities near MBH u 1.7\u00d7 1014 g. Such nature arises as the PBHs of mass MBH u 1.7\u00d7 1014 g had completely evaporated at z \u223c 17. Similar features are also obtained from Fig. 6(c) and 6(d) for lower values of \u03b2BH.\nIn the present analysis our attempt is to find an approximately fitted analytical form of G21 (for MBH ' 2\u00d7 1014 g) as a function of PBH mass MBH and initial PBH mass fraction \u03b2BH. In this regard we first propose a form for T z=17.221 as,\nT z=17.221 (MBH, \u03b2BH) = (a1 + a2)\u00d7 CDFSQN(MBH, \u03b2BH, \u03c3f , \u03b1f )\u2212 a2, (21)\nwhere a1, a2, \u00b5f , \u03c3f , \u03b1f are parameters obtained by fitting this equation with the results obtained in Fig. 6. The\n12\ncumulative distribution CDFSQN (in Eq. 21) is given by\nCDFSQN(MBH, \u03b2BH, \u03c3f , \u03b1f ) = 1\n2 erfc\n( \u00b5f (MBH)\u2212 log10 \u03b2BH\u221a\n2\u03b1f\n) \u2212 2 OwenT ( log10 \u03b2BH \u2212 \u00b5f (MBH)\n\u03c3f , \u03b1f\n) . (22)\nIn the above expression, erfc(x) and OwenT (i, j) are the complementary error function and the Owen function [68] respectively, given by\nerfc(x) = 1\u2212 erf(x) (23)\nOwenT(x, a) = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b a 0 exp ( \u2212x2(1 + t2)/2 1 + t2 ) dt . (24)\nThe parameters are obtained as a1 = 32.83, a2 = 968.576 and \u03b1f = \u22121.5 We also note that values of \u03c3f and \u00b5f vary with the PBH mass MBH while the other parameter \u03b1f remains almost unchanged. The variations of \u03c3f and \u00b5f with MBH are found to be approximated as,\n\u03c3f (MBH) u 1.66\u2212 0.026 loge(MBH/g), (25) \u00b5f (MBH) u 13.0584\u2212 1100.38 (MBH/g)\u22120.1 . (26)\nIt should be mentioned here that, the form of the fitted function in Eq. 21 is obtained by trial and \u03c72-fitting. It can now be seen that, replacing T z=17.221 in Eq. 20 with the expression of T z=17.2 21 obtained in Eq. 21, a form for a distribution of PBH masses follows (i.e. G21(MBH, \u03b2BH) = f(MBH, \u03b2BH)). But it is to be noted here that numerical values of the parameters of this distribution function would change for different chosen DM mass m\u03c7 In figure 7(a,b), we compare the results obtained from the analytical form for G21 and T z=17.2 21 (eqs 5.1-5.6; proposed in this work) with those obtained from the simulations. Since the evolution of the spin temperature and consequently the brightness temperature of 21 cm line also depend on DM mass m\u03c7, we repeat the entire calculation with different chosen values of Dark Matter mass m\u03c7 (in the previous case we use fixed value of Dark Matter particle m\u03c7 = 0.5 GeV). However, the values of fitted parameters a1, a2, \u00b5f , \u03c3f and \u03b1f may be modified with different choices of m\u03c7 but the functional form of G21 remains same. Instead of showing the variation of those parameters with m\u03c7, in Fig. 8 the allowed region in the \u03b2BH - m\u03c7 parameter space is plotted. Fig. 8 is plotted in the following way. In the discussion above, it is clear that for a particular value of \u03b2BH a probability weightage distribution function is obtained. Now using this \u03b2BH value and the corresponding probability distribution function (G21) of MBH, the value of T z=17.2 21 is computed (solving the coupled equations given in sections II-IV) for different values of dark matter mass m\u03c7 within a chosen range of m\u03c7 (0.1 GeV\u223c 2 GeV). The values of \u03b2BH and m\u03c7 which yield T z=17.2 21 within the allowed range of EDGES result are then plotted. This process is repeated for different values of \u03b2BH and the corresponding distribution function for MBH. The result is then plotted in Fig. 8 and the allowed region is furnished as shown. Note that, in generating Fig. 8 the mass distribution of PBH masses is\n13\n( \u2212500+200\u2212500 ) (EDGES\nconsidered as mentioned in Eq. 20-26 with PBH mass range (distribution function) 6 \u00d7 1013 g \u2264 MBH \u2264 1015 g for different fixed values of \u03b2BH.\nWe also compare the allowed region obtained in Fig. 8 with similar allowed region obtained for other analytical mass distribution functions of PBHs namely lognormal distribution and power law distribution. In case of lognormal distribution of PBH masses the parameters are \u00b5 and \u03c3 (mean and standard deviation). As discussed earlier the value of \u03c3 is fixed at a \u03c3 = 0.5 lognormal distribution in this work. The coupled differential equations (formalism described in Sect. II - IV) are then solved with lognormal distribution of PBHs for several values of \u03b2BH and m\u03c7, after adopting a suitable fixed value of \u00b5 and the 21cm brightness temperature T z=17.221 is obtained. Then line in the \u03b2BH-m\u03c7 plane that denotes the upper bound of T z=17.2 21 value (\u2212300 mK) is drown in Fig. 9(a) for a particular value of \u00b5 and in the same way line that denotes the lower limit of T z=17.221 temperature (\u22121000 mK) is also shown in the same figure (Fig. 9(a)). The region between these two lines (for a fixed \u00b5 value) is then a allowed region in \u03b2BH-m\u03c7 plane that satisfy EDGES result (in case of lognormal distribution with a given \u00b5 and \u03c3 value). This process is carried out for three fixed \u00b5 values namely \u00b5 = 2\u00d7 1014 g, 5\u00d7 1014 g and 1\u00d7 1015 g and three allowed regions are obtained which are shown in Fig. 9(a). These regions (bounded by a pair of lines has discussed above) are superimposed in Fig. 9(a) over the region obtained in Fig. 8, for comparison. Similar plots are drawn and superimposed on the allowed region obtained from Fig. 8 for the case of power law distribution of PBHs and these are shown in Fig. 9(b). Similar procedures for the computations of T z=17.221 are repeated for power law distribution and the upper and lower limits in \u03b2BH-m\u03c7 plane that satisfy EDGES results are shown in Fig. 9(b) and these are superimposed on the allowed region obtained in Fig. 8 for comparison. Note that, for power law distribution there is only one parameter namely the power law index \u03b3. In Fig. 9(b), the allowed bounded regions (the region between the upper and lower limits of T z=17.221 (\u2212300 mK and \u22121000 mK respectively) given by the EDGES experiment) are shown for three fixed value of \u03b3 namely \u03b3 = \u22120.5, 0.0001 and 0.5 with Mmin = 6\u00d7 1013 g and Mmax = 1015 g. It is observed from Fig. 9(b) that when \u03b3 \u2265 0, the allowed regions appear to coincide.\nFrom Fig. 9(a) and its comparison with Fig. 8 one can see that, at higher values of m\u03c7 (m\u03c7 & 0.5 GeV), the allowed region for lognormal mass distributions of PBHs with the chosen distribution parameters (\u00b5, \u03c3) are within the similar allowed region for the case of probability distribution of PBH masses obtained in this work. However, at lower masses of dark matter particles (m\u03c7 . 0.5 GeV) a significant amount of baryon heating is required in order to make the corresponding allowed zone coincide or overlap with the same obtained in Fig. 8. It is observed from Fig. 9(a) that, for m\u03c7 . 0.5 GeV, the allowed region in Fig. 9(a) for lognormal distribution, only the values of \u00b5 . 5\u00d7 1014 g agrees with the allowed region for the probability distribution of PBH masses as described in this subsection (Eq. 20-26). For the case of power law distribution of PBH masses (Fig. 9(b)), the allowed regions for all possible chosen values of distribution parameter \u03b3 lie within the permissible region corresponds to the probability distribution of PBH masses described in this subsection (Eq. 20-26).\n14"

            "text": "In this work, we use the EDGES 21cm results as a representative of a global 21cm excess trough line to constrain different possible mass distributions of PBHs in the Universe. To this end, in this work we consider types of PBH mass distribution (discussed in the literature). These are lognormal mass distribution and power law mass distribution. Also considered are specific fixed masses (monochromatic) for PBHs with each of these cases for PBH mass, a set of coupled equations are solved where we have included the terms related to baryon and dark matter interaction and the effects of PBH evaporation. These coupled differential equations are then solved simultaneously for the evolution of spin temperature Ts, the evolution of baryon temperature Tb, DM temperature T\u03c7 and other quantities required to calculate the brightness temperature of 21cm line, T21. Thus the contributions of dark matter - baryon interaction, PBH evaporation are also taken into consideration for the computation of temperature evolutions of T21. From these analyses the PBH mass distribution parameters are constrained using the EDGES 21cm results considered in this work. The effects of DM of different masses also play a major role for constraining the parameter space of PBHs. In this regard, the allowed regions of the PBH parameter spaces such as \u03b2BH\u2212\u00b5, \u03b2BH\u2212\u03c3 and \u03b2BH\u2212\u03b3 are computed for different fixed values of DM mass. Here, \u03b2BH represents initial mass fraction of PBHs, \u00b5 and \u03c3 are mean and variance respectively for lognormal mass distribution and \u03b3 denotes the power law index for power law mass distribution of PBHs.\nWith the EDGES like 21cm results considered here, an attempt has been made in this work to construct an expression for the probability distribution of the PBH masses. For this purpose, the range of the T21 results around its measured central value (at reionization epoch) is first considered and the weights of each T z=17.221 value (i.e., value of T21 at z \u223c 17.2) within this experimentally obtained range (\u2212300mK \u2264 T z=17.221 \u2264 \u22121000mK) are estimated and thus a weightage distribution of the T z=17.221 values within this range is constructed. It appears that a skew normal distribution (G21) best represents these probabilities. Now for different values of MBH (and a particular value of \u03b2BH), T z=17.221 is computed as described in section II - IV. The weight factor for the calculated values of T z=17.2 21 (from the distribution G21) are then assigned to the corresponding values of MBH. A resulting variation of T z=17.2 21 with MBH is thus constructed for a particular \u03b2BH and the process is then repeated to yield different such distributions for different fixed values of \u03b2BH. The results are then fitted to assumed form of a bi-variate distribution of T z=17.2 21 (MBH, \u03b2BH). Thus an analytical map between the spin temperature and the PBH mass distribution is obtained. This map is then utilized to obtain a probability distribution for the PBH masses MBH. Such form contains certain parameters, the numerical values of which are found out by suitable \u03c72-fitting. The bi-variate distribution of T z=17.221 is found to be a combination of an error function and Owen function (Eq. 24). Using this distribution the allowed region of variation of \u03b2BH and DM mass m\u03c7 is obtained. We then consider two analytical mass distribution MBH namely lognormal distribution and power law distribution with mass distribution function Eq. 9 and Eq. 8 respectively. Note that, for lognormal distribution, the distribution parameters are the mean \u00b5 and the variant \u03c3, which ate kept at a certain\n15\nfixed value. For power law distribution however, there is only one parameter, \u03b3- the power law index, which is to be kept fixed. The brightness temperatures T z=17.221 are computed using Eqs. 12 to 19 of sect. IV for different values of \u03b2BH and m\u03c7 and the upper and lower limits of T z=17.2 21 are obtained in the \u03b2BH \u2212m\u03c7 plane for different fixed values of \u00b5 (for the case of lognaomal distribution. Note that kept fixed at \u03c3 = 0.5). Similar upper and lower limits are also obtained in the \u03b2BH\u2212m\u03c7 plane for the case of power law distribution for different chosen values of \u03b3. These are then compared with the allowed region obtained for the probability distribution of mBH (using G21) as proposed in this work."
