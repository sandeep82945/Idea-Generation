 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop more advanced methods to obtain probabilities of mixed scenarios covering both load/renewable uncertainties and contingencies. The paper assumes they are independent, but exploring possible dependencies could improve scenario generation.

2. Investigate market participation models for renewable generators to provide reserves. The paper acknowledges this is still an open question, so researching how to best integrate renewables into reserve markets is an important next step. 

3. Merge different reserve products like regulating reserve and spinning reserve into one product while ensuring their distinct control schemes are properly handled. The paper merges them but notes control schemes must also be addressed.

4. Guarantee revenue adequacy for the ISO under the proposed rolling-window market design. The paper mentions this is an open challenge for rolling-window approaches. New techniques could be developed.

5. Extend the pricing and incentive analysis to allow for generator outages and their heterogeneity. The paper ignores outages for simplicity, but incorporating them could reveal new insights into pricing heterogeneous resources.
