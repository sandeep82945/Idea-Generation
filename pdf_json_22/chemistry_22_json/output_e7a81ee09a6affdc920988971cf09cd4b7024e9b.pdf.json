    "abstractText": "In this study, an efficient hierarchical Co\u2013Pi cluster/Fe2O3 nanorod/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) micropillar three-dimensional (3D) branched photoanode was designed for enhanced photoelectrochemical performance. A periodic array of FTO micropillars, which acts as a highly conductive \u201chost\u201d framework for uniform light scattering and provides an extremely enlarged active area, was fabricated by direct printing and mist-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Fe2O3 nanorods that act as light absorber \u201cguest\u201d materials and Co\u2013Pi clusters that give rise to random light scattering were synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction and photoassisted electrodeposition, respectively. The hierarchical 3D branched photoanode exhibited enhanced light absorption efficiency because of multiple light scattering, which was a combination of uniform light scattering from the periodic FTO micropillars and random light scattering from the Fe2O3 nanorods. Additionally, the large surface area of the 3D FTO micropillar, together with the surface area provided by the one-dimensional Fe2O3 nanorods, contributed to a remarkable increase in the specific area of the photoanode. Because of these enhancements and further improvements facilitated by decoration with a Co\u2013Pi catalyst that enhanced water oxidation, the 3D branched Fe2O3 photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of 1.51 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 VRHE, which was 5.2 times higher than that generated by the non-decorated flat Fe2O3 photoanode.",

            "text": "With the increased focus on replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has gained significant attention for the conversion of solar energy into clean chemical energy (H2) [1\u20133]. For efficient solar energy conversion, a PEC cell must absorb visible light, transport and separate the charge carriers, and transfer the separated charge carriers to the semiconductor/electrolyte surface [4\u20136]. However, dense photoelectrode films are limited by their low PEC efficiencies due to their small surface area and high reflectivity. To solve this problem and obtain increased PEC efficiency, many studies using micro-nanostructured photoelectrodes have been conducted [7,8]. It was shown that micro-nanostructured photoanodes can successfully decrease the carrier diffusion path, induce a light-scattering effect, and increase the surface area, thereby favoring a higher PEC efficiency. To fabricate such structured photoanodes, hierarchical guest/host structures are commonly constructed [9,10]. Hierarchical guest/host type photoelectrodes can maximize the PEC efficiency by combining the effects of 1D, 2D, and 3D micro-nanostructures on light\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3664. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12203664 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3664 2 of 10\nabsorption and scattering, and by providing an extremely large specific surface area. In these hierarchical structures, the guest material must have a narrow bandgap and adequate band edge alignments to act as a photoactive layer that absorbs visible light and efficiently creates photogenerated charges for PEC reactions [11,12]. Metal oxides such as Fe2O3, BiVO4, and TiO2 are good photoactive guest materials, and they have often been investigated in studies on micro-nanostructured photoelectrodes. Since the host material serves as a growth scaffold for the guest material, host materials must exhibit high electrical conductivity and chemical resistance [13,14]. Because of its chemical stability, high optical transmittance, and low electrical resistance, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is deemed the most effective candidate for the host material. Many studies have employed guest-host-structured photoanodes using FTO as the host, such as FTO inverse opal/CdS nanorods [15], FTO inverse opal/TiO2 [16], and nanocone arrays of FTO/\u03b1-Fe2O3 [17] photoanodes. However, the processes used for the fabrication of the FTO framework in the above studies were complicated and could not easily fabricate uniform FTO over a large area. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new methods for the scalable fabrication of FTO-based micro-nanostructured photoanodes that are suitable for large-scale production and use. In this study, a hierarchical Co\u2013Pi cluster/Fe2O3 nanorod/FTO micropillar 3D branched photoanode was fabricated. Periodic FTO micropillars were constructed by performing direct printing and mist-chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which enable simple, lowcost, and large-area fabrication. Thereafter, 1D Fe2O3 nanorods were hydrothermally synthesized on the surface of the periodic FTO micropillars. The periodic FTO micropillars, which acted as a conductive framework, collected electrons to facilitate uniform light scattering and provide a large surface area for Fe2O3 nanorods to grow. Moreover, the Fe2O3 nanorods enabled random light scattering and increased the surface area further. Thus, the hierarchical Fe2O3 nanorod/FTO micropillar structure induced multiple light scattering mechanisms for enhanced light-harvesting efficiency. Thereafter, the Fe2O3 nanorods were supplemented with Co\u2013Pi clusters to increase the surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and PEC performance of the entire photoanode. In terms of the photocurrent density (1.51 mA cm\u22122 at 1.23 VRHE), the hierarchical Co\u2013Pi cluster/Fe2O3 nanorod/FTO micropillar 3D branched photoanode exhibited significant improvement compared to that of Fe2O3 nanorod/flat FTO."

Periodic FTO micropillars, labeled FTO-M, were fabricated using a process reported in earlier studies [18,19]. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was prepared using Sylgard 184A and Sylgard 184B (10:1 volume ratio). Thereafter, PDMS was applied to the photolithographyfabricated micropillar-array Si wafer. The PDMS mold was hardened (80 \u25e6C, 3 h) and then peeled from the micropillar-array Si wafer, producing a PDMS mold with a reverse micropillar structure. A hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) solution was diluted in isobutyl methyl ketone (IBMK) and spread onto the PDMS mold (3000 rpm, 30 s), using the spincoating method. Thereafter, an Eagle XG glass substrate (Corning) showing excellent acidity, alkalinity, and heat resistance, was applied to the PDMS mold at a pressure of 200 kPa for 1 min. After the detachment of the PDMS mold, an HSQ micropillar array was formed, labeled HSQ-M. The substrates were heat-treated (500 \u25e6C, 2 h) to harden the micropillar pattern further.

Rhombohedral \u03b1-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 33-0664) and tetragonal SnO2 (JCPDS No. 46-1088) are detected from the main peaks in the XRD patterns.

On the other hand, the O1s peak at 531.4 eV is attributed to the surface -OH groups. The spectrum presented in Figure 2e shows a binding energy of 133.0 eV, corresponding to a single peak of P 2p that is attributed to the phosphate in the electrodeposited Co\u2013Pi clusters. Furthermore, the binding energies at 797.3 and 781.6 eV correspond to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, in the Co 2p region (Figure 2f). The binding energies of the two shakeup satellite peaks (Sat.) at 785.7 and 803.1 eV are assigned to the oxidized Co in the +2 oxidation state (Co2+). An increase in the Co2+/Co3+ ratio of the sample is observed when the peak shifts to a higher binding energy [25,26]. The oxidation number of the cobalt ions is assumed to change cyclically (Co2+/3+ \u2192 Co3+ \u2192 Co2+/3+) during the oxidation of water [27,28]. Therefore, the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ directly after deposition does not have a significant effect on the overall catalytic ability compared to either the nucleation density or the total number of Co\u2013Pi clusters, thereby verifying the formation of Co\u2013Pi on the Fe2O3 sample [29].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3664 5 of 10\n3.2.

This increased PEC efficiency is attributed to the expanded specific area resulting from the hierarchical structure and multiple light scattering from the micropillar FTO and Fe2O3 nanorods.

These Co species can oxidize water more effectively than bare Fe2O3 surfaces [34].

This\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3664 8 of 10\nresult indicates that the micropillar structure and Co\u2013Pi catalyst have a remarkable influence on the charge kinetics at the surface and on PEC efficiency. Further, in Figure S8, the electrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) show the decrease of interface resistance between the electrolyte and the photoanode, which is R2 of the circuit. The decrease of R2 could be interpreted as due to the enlarged surface area and the enhanced surface oxidation reaction by Co\u2013Pi catalyst. The PEC efficiency of the photoanodes was quantitatively analyzed using the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE). The maximum photoconversion efficiency of FTO-M/Fe2O3/Co\u2013Pi was 0.101% at 1.07 VRHE, whereas that of FTO-F/Fe2O3 was only 0.0302% at 1.00 VRHE (Figure 5c). The effect of surface structuring and Co\u2013Pi cluster decoration was further investigated by adding 0.5 M of an H2O2 solution to 1 M of NaOH (Figure 5d). The H2O2 solution acted as a hole scavenger and suppressed surface recombination; hence, it was used to measure the maximum PEC properties without an injection barrier, by assuming charge transfer efficiency (\u03b7transfer) to be 100% [32,35]. The obtained photocurrent densities were 1.05, 1.62, 2.24, and 3.39 mA cm\u22122 for FTO-F/Fe2O3, FTO-F/Fe2O3/Co\u2013Pi, FTO-M/Fe2O3, and FTO-M/Fe2O3/Co\u2013Pi, respectively.

(6)\nThe Jmax of Fe2O3 was 12.2 mA cm\u22122 (300\u2013587 nm). The calculated \u03b7abs \u00d7 \u03b7separation values were 8.68, 20.2, 26.7, and 41.0% for FTO-F/Fe2O3, FTO-F/Fe2O3/Co\u2013Pi, FTOM/Fe2O3, and FTO-M/Fe2O3/Co\u2013Pi, respectively. These results confirm that \u03b7separation increases because the 1D nanorods on the 3D micropillar-patterned FTO significantly increase the active area to produce multiple light-scattering effects, whereas Co\u2013Pi alleviates surface charge recombination and acts as a passivation layer."

            "text": "In this study, we employed a simple, low-cost, and large-area-fabrication approach for FTO photoanodes. We thus fabricated 3D branched Fe2O3 nanorods on a micropillar FTO with an effective PEC water splitting performance with the electrodeposition of Co\u2013Pi clusters and direct printing. The \u03b7abs of FTO-F/Fe2O3 increased by 9.2% compared to that of FTO-M/Fe2O3 because of the uniform and random light scattering induced by the periodic micropillar FTO and Fe2O3 nanorods, respectively. In addition, the surface area and separation efficiency were greatly enhanced because of the unique structure of the 1D Fe2O3 nanorods that grew on the 3D micropillar array. The additional decoration of a Co\u2013Pi catalyst oxidized water more effectively than the bare Fe2O3 surface and yielded a photocurrent density of 1.51 mA cm\u22122. This study illustrates the critical role of micro-nanoscale structural engineering and surface oxidation catalysts in enhancing the PEC performance of hematite, thereby paving the way for low-cost solar-powered water splitting applications.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano12203664/s1.
