            "text": "Water is considered as one of the most vital natural resources for the sustainability of life. Growing population and industrial development have led to a decline in clean water sources and an increase in wastewater generation (Riffat & Husnain 2022). The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) report on \u2018Composite Water Management Index (2018)\u2019, mentioned a total of 600 million Indian population encountering high water crisis. The country with 70% of contaminated water is placed 120th among 122 countries in the water quality index (WQI) (NITI Aayog 2018). Contaminated water is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic components, microbes and chemicals, which impart adverse effects on both aquatic and terrestrial environments (Riffat & Husnain 2022). Recalcitrant compounds are resistant to degradation and form toxic intermediate products under conventional treatment methods (Mohamad Said et al. 2021). Phenolic compounds are recalcitrant organics categorised as pollutants of priority concern by the European Union and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (Anku et al. 2017). Industrial sources of phenol include petrochemicals, pulp and paper industries, pharmaceuticals, textiles and many more (Saputera et al. 2021). Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) use highly reactive oxygen species, which helps in the complete mineralisation of pollutants to CO2, H2O and mineral acids (in presence of halogens) (Andreozzi et al. 1999; Joseph et al. 2009). Hydroxyl radical with an oxidation potential of 2.8 V is the most reactive oxidising species used in water and wastewater treatment (Ameta & Ameta 2018). AOPs were found to be efficient in the removal of emerging and recalcitrant pollutants with low biodegradability. In comparison, AOPs were found to be comparable in cost with that of conventional treatment methods (Andreozzi et al. 1999; Bracamontes-Ruelas et al. 2022). Photocatalysis, an AOP involves semiconductor activation by means of irradiation to completely mineralise several organic\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.306/1320450/wst2023306.pdf by guest on 12 January 2024\npollutants. TiO2 is the most preferred semiconductor due to its high chemical stability, non-toxicity and low cost (Ameta & Ameta 2016). The coupling of photocatalysis with biological treatment methods was reported to be efficient in the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) in a study conducted by Lin et al. (2020).\nPhotocatalytic reactor designs should consider factors such as working regime, photocatalyst, irradiation, as well as the volume of liquid treated. A well-designed reactor speeds up the treatment process with a reduced power consumption hence making the treatment technology more economical. Scaling up of photocatalytic reactors is one of the major challenges in this research area (Enesca 2021). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), a computer simulation technique is widely used in fluid flow, heat transfer and chemical reaction analysis. CFD programmes due to their adaptability are effective tools that can be used for industrial and non-industrial purposes. The technique offers several advantages over experimental methods including reduction in time and cost and improved accuracy of results (Versteeg & Malalasekera 2007). The choice of a CFD solver depends on factors such as domain type, mesh type, flow type, flow compressibility, type of reference frame, customisation capabilities and so more (Liu & Zhang 2019). ANSYS Fluent is one such user-friendly commercial CFD package used to simulate fluid flow, heat transfer and fluid\u2013catalyst interactions with accuracy, using the finite volume method approach (Jeong & Seong 2013). Modern user interfaces in commercial CFD software help streamline different problem configurations and results analysis. User-defined functions in ANSYS Fluent can be coded externally as a supplementary function and can used to attain accurate solutions (Barraza-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2019). A study by Vezzoli et al. (2011) used ANSYS Fluent solver to design a flat plate photocatalytic reactor for phenol degradation over titanium dioxide photocatalyst. The investigation was focused on the impact of different operational parameters on the reaction kinetics. These standard CFD programs are equipped with data visualisation tools such as 2D and 3D plots, coloured graphical representations and animations. The availability of features such as different perspective views, vector plots, and grid displays has simplified the analysis processes (Barraza-Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2019; Mann 2008; Ruiz-Soto et al. 2020). Duran et al. (2010) conducted a performance prediction study of annular photocatalytic reactors under different hydrodynamic models over a wide range of flow rates and intrinsic reaction rates. In a study by Devia-Orjuela et al. (2019) a baffled flat plate photocatalytic reactor under UV light was used for the degradation study to understand the effect of baffles on degradation efficiency. In this particular research, it was observed that the baffles helped in fluid mixing, which in turn enhanced the degradation efficiency. Ahmed et al. (2022) modelled a flat plate photocatalytic reactor using ANSYS Fluent solver for phenol degradation. The analysis reported that the degradation increased with an increase in radiation and a decrease in phenol concentration and flow rate. Ruiz-Soto et al. (2020) demonstrated hydrodynamic analysis on a photocatalytic reactor using ANSYS Fluent. A study by Gao et al. (2023) was focused on the optimisation of geometric structure and reaction conditions to enhance photocatalytic performance leading to the development of a honeycomb reactor as the optimum design. The current study focuses on the design and comparison of immobilised photocatalytic reactors in the modelling of hydrodynamics, species transport and chemical reaction kinetics using ANSYS Fluent. Phenol degradation was the simulated reaction in the study, reaction conditions of the same were validated from previous works of Ahmed et al. (2022) and Vezzoli et al. (2011)."

Problem definition is the initial phase of study wherein suitable assumptions and simplifications are fed into the model in regard to problem domain, initial and boundary conditions. The pre-processing stage inputs the problem onto CFD through user-friendly interface. Steps included in this stage are domain definition, grid generation, selection of physical and chemical phenomenon to be modelled and definition of material properties and boundary conditions (Versteeg & Malalasekera 2007). Grid generation is an important step in pre-processing, as the accuracy of the simulation results depends on the quality of meshin (Ferziger et al. 2020). The solving stage deals with solving fluid flow (conservation of mass, momentum, energy, species transport) equations using numerical solution techniques. Most of the CFD codes utilised the finite volume method as the numerical technique (Versteeg & Malalasekera 2007). The post-processing stage analyses and visualises the results in the form of vector plots, contour plots, X\u2013Y plots, streamlines, animations, and particle tracking and can be exported as reports (Liu & Zhang 2019).\nANSYS Fluent 2022 R1 software package is the CFD solver used in the present study.

Geometry was subdivided into four named sections including inlet (fluid flow entry at left top), outlet (fluid exit at the right bottom), bottom wall (reaction surface at rear side) and all other sections were named as walls.

In comparison to the reference study by Ahmed et al. (2022), the model introduced changes in the reactor geometry. To increase the contact time between catalyst and pollutant, a serpentine flow path was introduced. The serpentine flow path has more path length at the same overall dimensions compared to that of a simple reactor. The serpentine nature of fluid flow is also reported to enhance residence time, thereby fluid absorption on the catalyst increases and hence increases the degradation rates (Vengadesan et al. 2022). Additionally, curved baffles were introduced to prevent the flow channelisation, which would affect pollutant and radiation distribution under experimental conditions. Baffles were reported to improve uniformity of flow and prolong the residence time, thus improving the degradation rate (Deng et al. 2023). The addition of baffles to the model would aid in analysing the enhancement in flow homogeneity and pollutant degradation."

As the flow progressed through the reactor, a secondary flow transverse to the primary was created, which led to the formation of vortices, as shown in Figure 9. These zones resulted in enhanced vertical mixing of fluids (Jarandehei & De Visscher 2009). However, the channelised flow path resulted in an uneven distribution of pollutants and radiation across the fluid volume.

Vertical and slanting baffles occupied a certain surface area in the bottom wall, which reduced catalystcoated area and phenol degradation efficiency. Effect of number of baffles are shown in Figure 10(b). Efficiency was highest when three number of baffles were arranged in the flow path. However, the effect of an increase in the number of baffles is minimal as there was only a small change of 0.27% increase when the baffle count was increased from one to three. The increase may be due to the fact that as baffle count increases, fluid turbulence increases, which causes enhanced mixing thereby increasing phenol degradation (Chung et al. 2006).\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.306/1320450/wst2023306.pdf by guest on 12 January 2024\nInvestigation on the effect of baffle size on degradation efficiency exhibited no significant improvement when baffle size was increased from 10 to 20 mm. However when baffle length was varied from 40 to 60 mm, as shown in Figure 11, 60 mm baffles exhibited the highest efficiency of 43.1%.

            "text": "Based on the above-mentioned results, optimum reactor geometry for maximum removal efficiency was obtained. The horizontal baffled serpentine flow reactor, with baffles of 20 mm diameter, 60 mm length and three number of baffles in a stretch was considered as the final reactor design. As already mentioned in Section 2.3.3, named sections were allotted to the\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.306/1320450/wst2023306.pdf by guest on 12 January 2024\ngeometry. Grid independence study was conducted on the reactor geometry for three different mesh sizes 2.5, 3 and 3.5 mm. Of which 3 mm mesh size interval was considered as the optimum mesh size, with average quality parameters of the mesh within range. Hence 3 mm mesh was considered as the mesh size for further study. Velocity contours and vectors at a plane near (0.002 m) to the bottom wall are shown in Figure 12(a) and 12(b), respectively.\nFrom Figure 12(b), it can be observed that in the velocity field, minor recirculation zones were present only near the inlet region. However, the recirculation zones in the reactive zones were eliminated along with the removal of flow channelisation present in the serpentine flow path reactor. Thus the addition of baffles has improved the flow homogeneity along with enhanced mixing of fluid.\nSpecies contours for phenol and carbon dioxide are shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively. From Figure 13(a), the degradation of phenol along the length of the reactor, at a plane located at 0.002 m from the bottom wall is shown. Average values of phenol concentration decreases from 7.78 10 7 kmol/m3 at inlet to 4.43 10 7 kmol/m3 at outlet, thereby exhibiting a removal efficiency of 43.1% for a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 18.44 s. It can also be observed from Figure 13(b) that even though the reaction occurs at the lower surface (bottom wall with catalyst coating), as the flow progresses, phenol from\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.306/1320450/wst2023306.pdf by guest on 12 January 2024\nthe top layers will also come in contact with the reaction surface, ensuring reduction in phenol concentration throughout the reactor cross-section. From Figure 14, it can be inferred that the production of carbon dioxide occurs when the phenol gets oxidised. CO2 production increases from 0 at inlet to 2.32 10 6 at outlet as shown in Figure 14(a), at the plane located at 0.002 m from the bottom wall. From Figures 13(a) and 14(a), it can clearly be observed that as the reaction progresses, phenol gets converted to carbon dioxide across the reactor. Figure 14(b) shows the distribution of carbon dioxide across the entire reactor.\nBased on the results from these models, it can be inferred that the introduction of baffles within the serpentine flow field had a very significant effect on the hydrodynamics as well as the performance of the reactor, mainly because of the mixing of flow at each bend. The serpentine type of geometry has exhibited significant channelisation, but these effects are negated to some extent by the use of transverse baffles across the flow path, this can be due to the disturbance created by the baffles, which are placed across the flow direction. The transverse baffles with horizontal orientation were found to provide better performance compared to vertical and slanting ones. The efficiency also tends to increase with the baffle number and length. At a flow velocity of 0.5 m/s and inlet molar concentration of 7.78 10 7, the horizontal baffled reactor exhibited an efficiency of 43.1% for a residence time of 18.44 s in phenol degradation."

The investigation compared different reactor configurations for the degradation of phenol in an immobilised reactor. A simple cuboidal reactor exhibited a removal efficiency of 27%. To improve the residence time and contact time between the catalyst and pollutant, a serpentine flow path was introduced in the cuboidal reactor, which improved the phenol degradation efficiency to 42%. However, the serpentine flow path presented flow channelisation, which resulted in a non-uniform flow pattern, which may affect pollutant and radiation distribution within the reactor. To cater to this issue, baffles were introduced in the serpentine flow path, which improved the flow homogeneity. The effect of baffle type, number and dimensions on phenol degradation efficiency were also compared. Of which horizontal baffles of curved shape, with 20 mm diameter and 60 mm length were found to have the highest removal efficiency. The optimum number of baffles was found to be three in a stretch. The final reactor model considered was the serpentine flow path horizontal baffled reactor with the optimum baffle conditions, which exhibited an efficiency of 43.1% under a flow rate of 0.3 L/s."
