            "text": "Four experiments investigated the extent to which abstract quantitative information can be conveyed by basic visual features. This was done by asking observers to estimate and discriminate Pearson correlation in graphical representations where the first data dimension of each element was encoded by its horizontal position, and the second by the value of one of its visual features; perceiving correlation then requires combining the information in the two encodings via a common abstract representation. Four visual features were examined: luminance, color, orientation, and size. All were able to support the perception of correlation. Indeed, despite the strikingly different appearances of the associated stimuli, all gave rise to performance that was much the same: just noticeable difference was a linear function of distance from complete correlation, and estimated correlation a logarithmic function of this distance. Performance differed only in regards to the level of noise in the feature, with these values compatible with estimates of channel capacity encountered in classic experiments on absolute perceptual magnitudes. These results suggest that quantitative information can be conveyed by visual features that are abstracted at relatively low levels of visual processing, with little representation of the original sensory property. It is proposed that this is achieved via an abstract parameter space in which the values in each perceptual dimension are normalized to have the same means and variances, with perceived correlation based on the shape of the joint probability density function of the resultant elements."

            "text": "The area of information visualization concerns itself with the effective display of information in graphical form (e.g., Spence, 2014; Ware, 2012). Here, physical properties such as color and orientation\u2014often referred to as visual variables (Bertin, 1967/2011)\u2014are used for four purposes: (i) forming spatial groups, (ii) creating items that are visually distinct, (iii) facilitating attentional selection of sets of items, and (iv) encoding quantitative information (Card, Mackinlay, & Shneiderman, 1999; Roth, 2017).1 The perceptual correlates of these variables are usually referred to in vision science as visual features\u2014simple, rapidly-determined properties that support operations such as grouping texture perception, and attentional selection (Wolfe & Horowitz, 2004; Wolfe & Utochkin, 2019).\nBut whereas vision science has extensively studied the first three uses of visual variables, it has given relatively little attention to the fourth, viz., the use of visual features to convey quantitative information. Perceived orientation, say, can facilitate such things as grouping and attentional selection, and various models have been proposed as to how this might be carried out (see Wolfe et al., 2002). But how is orientation able to explicitly convey abstract numerical information, as is often done in visualization dashboards and other displays (e.g., Harris, 1999)? What might be the mechanisms involved?\nThe perception of quantity has, of course, long been studied in the context of perceived sensory magnitude. Starting with the work of Fechner in the 19th century (see e.g., Ross, 1997), this\n1 Technically, there is a fifth: conveying order in a series. For most purposes, however, order can be considered a\ncoarse version of quantity: ordinal values can always be conveyed whenever numerical values can be (Roth, 2017).\neventually developed into the study of sensory scaling (e.g., Billock & Tsou, 2011; Stevens, 1966). A related approach, based on information-theoretic considerations, examined the number of distinct levels or categories of perceived magnitude, yielding the capacity\u2014essentially the signalto-noise ratio\u2014for the perceptual channels corresponding to various properties (Miller, 1956; Nizami, 2010). But while valuable, such investigations generally focused on the perception of a single sensory property; the quantities involved were usually taken as linked with their sensory qualities in some way (as suggested by conscious experience), with abstraction into pure number occurring at a higher, cognitive level.2 It has been found that abstract quantity\u2014viz., the number of items in a set\u2014can be perceived within half a second (Burr & Ross, 2008; Cheyette & Piantadosi, 2020). But the relevant quantity here is an integer rather than a continuous number. Moreover, the quantities investigated are the outputs of processes rather than inputs, so that little can be said about the extent to which abstract information might already be available to low-level processes operating in parallel across space.\nThe goal of this paper, then, is to investigate the extent to which continuous (or at least, non-integer) quantitative information can be carried by visual features, and in particular, the extent to which it can be represented in an abstract form, one not tied to any sensory quality. Towards this end, it is useful to consider perception not within perceptual dimensions, but between them\u2014in particular, to consider the perception of the Pearson correlation r between information conveyed by two different properties. If quantitative information can be combined to support the perception of correlation, it would imply a common form in which the representation of this information has\n2 Similarly, ensemble processes that rapidly estimate the mean value of some property of set of items (Alvarez, 2011;\nWhitney & Leib, 2018) are also generally examined using j one property at a time.\nbeen separated from the representation of the original sensory properties, allowing it to be combined in the dense fashion typical of low levels of visual processing,"

            "heading": "Approach",
            "text": "To see how an approach of this kind might be implemented, consider first the scatterplot, a graphical representation where each ordered pair of a dataset is mapped to a dot, with the value of the first data dimension encoded by its horizontal position, and the second its vertical position (Figure 1a). In such a representation, Pearson correlation r can be assessed by combining information about the horizontal and vertical position of each dot. Both properties used in this representation are the same (viz., position), and so the information they carry can be combined in a straightforward way.\nConsider now a bivariate stripplot of the type shown in Figure 1b. Here, the first dimension of each data element is again represented by horizontal position, but the second is now represented\nby the value of some other property of the corresponding graphical element (in this case, the luminance of the line segment). To perceive correlation, it is necessary to use the joint values carried by the two features, which must then require a common amodal substrate in which the information from different dimensions can be combined on an item-by-item basis. The issue of whether quantitative information carried by luminance can be combined with that carried by position then takes the form of whether correlation can be perceived in such a stripplot, and if so, whether performance matches\u2014despite the differences in appearance\u2014that for scatterplots."

            "text": "For scatterplots, the estimation of correlation\u2014at least when done casually\u2014is largely perceptual, being relatively rapid and much the same for most observers, regardless of their level of statistical training (Doherty, Anderson, Angott, & Klopfer, 2007; Lane, Anderson, & Kellam, 1985; Meyer & Shinar, 1992). Discrimination of perceived correlation\u2014characterized by just noticeable difference (JND)\u2014can be described by (Rensink & Baldridge, 2010; Rensink, 2017)\nJND(r) = k (1/ bdisc \u2013 r) (1)\nwhere variability k and discrimination bias bdisc are such that 0 < k, bdisc < 1. Multiplying both\nsides by bdisc and setting u = 1\u2013 bdiscr, this becomes JND(u) = ku, an instance of Weber\u2019s Law (see\nRoss, 1997). Meanwhile, the magnitude of perceived correlation g(r) can be described by\ng(r) = ln(1 \u2013 best r) / ln(1 \u2013 best) (2)\nwhere estimation bias best is such that 0 < best < 1; again setting u = 1 \u2013 best r, this becomes g(u) =\nln(u) / (ln(1 \u2013 best)), an instance of Fechner\u2019s Law. For a scatterplot, the values of bdisc and best do\nnot reliably differ from each other, indicating a bias b common to both equations (Figure 2).\nIn the situation where bdisc = best = b, the derivative of (eq. 2) can take the form\ndg/dr = -[1/(ln(1-b)] / [1/b-r].\nApproximating dr and dg by their finite equivalents Dr and Dg, and rearranging terms,\nDr = -Dg ln(1-b) [1/b \u2013 r]. (3)\nAssuming that Dg is some threshold constant TC > 0 for each Dr = JND (i.e., the Fechner assumption), and matching eq. (3) to eq. (1), it follows that eq. (1) is connected to eq. (2), with\nk = -TC ln (1-b). (4)\nAlthough the physical correlation r of a scatterplot is defined via the values of individual horizontal and vertical positions, perceived correlation is not based on the multiplication of these quantities. Instead, it appears to be based on a perceptual proxy: the shape of the probability density function f (x,y) that describes the number of elements likely to be encountered at each two-dimensional location in the image; in essence, multiplication is replaced by colocation. More precisely, entropy theory (Rensink, 2017) asserts that perceived correlation g(r) is proportional to the entropy of the density function f (x,y), where entropy is a measure of disorder (or dispersion) that is proportional to average Shannon information (Ben-Naim, 2008; Stone, 2015). As shown in Appendix A, the entropy for a gaussian distribution is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the width of an isofraction ellipse, the set of points at a fixed fraction of the height of f (Figure 3). Given the\ncharacterization of g(r) as entropy, the Fechner assumption of a constant Dg for each Dr takes the\nform of a constant number of bits for each JND.\nIn what follows, the ability of visual features to convey abstract quantitative information is explored by determining the extent to which the perception of correlation in bivariate stripplots\nfollows eqs. (1) and (2), and whether the Fechner assumption still applies. To the extent that such behavior holds, the feature involved can be considered an information carrier\u2014a property able to convey quantitative information in the same way as perceived position, with this information abstracted in a common space in which the information from both perceptual dimensions can be combined. This possibility is investigated for four commonly-used features: luminance, color, orientation, and size."

Observers were told that accuracy was important, but that they could take as much time as needed. To familiarize each observer with the discrimination task, practice trials (with feedback) were given beforehand, starting with r = 0.0 and 1.0, and continuing until the observer reached 75% accuracy, or 32 trials had been run.

JND is a measure of percept\nvariability: the greater the JND, the greater the separation needed to see that two plots have different correlations, indicating a greater variability of perceptual estimates; JND is essentially a measure of the \u201cresolution\u201d of the perceptual representation involved.\nThe procedure to measure JND was that of Rensink (2017). A set of base correlations was selected, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9, in steps of 0.1. For each, JND was measured using a series (or run) of trials. In each trial, observers were shown two stripplots: one with the base correlation, and the other a test correlation either above or below it (Figure 4). Observers were asked to select the plot that appeared more correlated. If the answer was correct, absolute difference in correlation was decreased by 0.01, making the task more difficult; if incorrect, it was increased by 0.03. (Since 3 steps for each correct answer matched a single step for each incorrect answer, steady-state\nperformance was approximately 75% correct.) Feedback was provided after each response. New instances were generated every time a response was made, with the relative position of the base and test plots again randomly assigned each time. Performance was assessed via a moving window of 24 consecutive trials, divided into 3 sub-windows of 8 trials each. After 24 trials, average variance within the sub-windows was continually compared to the variance of the sub-window averages (somewhat akin to an F-test). Testing halted when this value became sufficiently low (\u2264 0.25), or 52 trials had been run; the average of the sub-windows was then taken as the JND.3 This procedure proved fairly effective, converging for 62% of the runs, and yielding results within 34.9 trials on average.\nOrder of testing was determined via a latin square design (Kirk, 1995) that counterbalanced base correlations and direction of JND (above vs. below) across the observers; the location of the base correlation stripplot (top vs. bottom) was randomly selected in each trial. To minimize boundary effects (Kay & Heer, 2015), no tests from below were run for base correlations of r = 0.2 or less."

Intensity is a property often used in information visualization (Roth, 2017); it is also considered a basic visual feature (Turatto & Galfano, 2000). To examine whether intensity (and its perceptual counterpart luminance) supports behavior similar to that for scatterplots, and to examine the extent to which correlation perception is sensitive to the particular mapping used, numerical value v was mapped to intensity\n5 Values for an observer were dropped if the difference between the high and low estimates for the first round of bisections was greater than 0.75 (taken to indicate that the observer did not understand or could not carry out the task). This resulted in 14.5% of observers being dropped, comparable to what was found in studies of scatterplots (e.g., Cleveland, Diaconis, & McGill, 1982; Rensink, 2017).\nvia I = vg for several different values of g; these were chosen to be similar to the values used in\nmost video systems (Figure 5).

            "text": "The experiments here show that visual features can support the perception of correlation, and that despite the strikingly different appearances of the stimuli involved, behavior for all features is largely the same (and the same as for scatterplots). In particular, discrimination follows the Weberlike law described by eq (1), while perceived magnitude follows the Fechner-like law described by eq. (2). (The Weber-like law for discrimination also seems to hold for several other visualization designs (Harrison, Yang, Franconeri, & Chang, 2014).) And for the case of single visual features, the two equations are connected via the Fechner assumption, with no significant difference found\nbetween discrimination bias bdisc and estimation bias best, which can then be taken to describe a common bias b. It therefore appears that the features of luminance, color, orientation, and size are all carriers, able to convey abstract quantitative information and combine it across different perceptual dimensions in much the same way as spatial position, with performance differing only in the values of parameters k and b (Figure 13). More complex properties also appear to give rise to similar behavior, except that the Fechner assumption no longer holds.\n0.3\n2\n4\nTheoretical Implications\nTo develop the implications of these results, consider first how a visualization system is able to convey quantitative information from a dataset to an observer. This involves a series of stages that essentially form a transmission pipeline, mapping information from a numerical space in the dataset to a perceptual space in the observer (Figure 14). Three perspectives are relevant :\ni. the signal\u2014the quantitative information conveyed to the observer, viz., the numerical\nvalue(s) attached to each item. Ideally, this information remains uncorrupted across all stages of the visualization process, with little noise or distortion introduced during transmission from dataset to perceiver.\nii. the carrier\u2014the property that encodes the signal. It has two aspects: the physical\nproperty that encodes information (e.g., the intensity of a line segment), and the corresponding perceptual property in the observer (e.g., its luminance). Note that the encoding conveys quantitative information implicitly\u2014it uses the representation of the carrier property itself (e.g., its intensity).\niii. the substrate\u2014the structure that contains the carrier. In the case of a stripplot, for\nexample, this could be a line element, with properties such as luminance, orientation, and position. Again, two aspects can be distinguished: the physical structure (e.g., the line segment in the image), and the corresponding perceptual representation of that segment.\nIn a scatterplot, for example, the two values of each data element (initially abstract quantities) are encoded by the horizontal and vertical co-ordinates of the corresponding dot on the computer screen; when viewed, the resulting graphical representation yields a low-level perceptual map\u2014 e.g., a primal sketch (Marr, 1982)\u2014in which the values in each element are now represented by the two-dimensional location of its corresponding perceptual substrate (i.e., the representation of the corresponding dot). The finding that information from different perceptual dimensions can be combined in a carrier-indifferent form implies that the contents of this perceptual space can be transformed back into abstract form via a decoding process of some kind, resulting in a twodimensional numerical space with no direct linkage to the properties of the carriers used.\nIdeally, the mapping between the numerical spaces in the dataset and in the observer should be isometric: equal distances in the original numerical space should map to equal distances in the\nnumerical space of the observer (Figure 14). To the extent that the decoding process can compensate for the various optical and perceptual effects encountered along the way, distortion will be minimal, and accuracy highest.\nWhat might such a process involve? Among other things, it would likely retain information about the center of mass of each perceptual element (the substrate) along with the value of the relevant carrier (its luminance, say), with all other information likely being discarded. (This might, for example, explain why the variation in length of the segments in the position-orientation stripplots of Experiment 3 had no reliable effect\u2014such information was simply not represented.) And to enable correlation to be perceived, this information must be integrated via an element-by-element binding similar to that of individual horizontal and vertical co-ordinates in a scatterplot. The existence of a dense binding of this form across space suggests that the processes involved are likely carried out at relatively low levels of visual processing, which typically involve a considerable degree of parallel processing (see e.g., Marr, 1982)."

            "heading": "Parameter Space Theory",
            "text": "One way to implement abstraction and binding of the kind described above is via parameter space, a low-level map in which the representation of sensory qualities is entirely abstract.7 For a positionluminance stripplot of the type shown in Figure 1, for example, parameter space would be a twodimensional subspace spanned by the dimensions of horizontal position and luminance value (Figure 15).\n7 Parameter space itself does have a spatial structure in terms of the distances between its elements (hence its name). But the values represented this way are abstract, in that they are not linked to any representation of geometric space or any other sensory quality. Geometric space may be represented directly via a map of some kind, but if so, it is the only such property.\nTwo considerations are particularly important in regards to this mapping. The first is the considerable invariance of performance found for variations in most mappings (e.g., different\nvalues of g), which suggests a normalization process of some kind. A simple form of this would\nbe a linear rescaling of carrier values to a particular mean and variance; to deal with distortions such as those created by the power functions typical of perceived physical quantities (Ross, 1997), a more sophisticated mapping might be used\u2014e.g., assume a gaussian distribution and take the most common carrier value to be the mean, with other values assigned accordingly. (The increase\nin JNDs for g = 4 and for the rainbow map may reflect the limits of this process.) Such\nnormalization would allow the information carried by sensory magnitude or position to be replaced by dimensionless quantities that are expressed in terms of standard deviations (akin to, say, z-scores in statistics). Also important is the relative size of the quantities in different dimensions; if the standard deviations in both dimensions are set to be the same, the resulting equalization would\ncreate a common scale between different carriers.8 The net result of such normalization and equalization would be a data-to-perception mapping that is largely isometric, providing good\u2014and possibly maximal\u2014sensitivity to the statistical structure present (cf. Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001).\nLimited\u2014but interesting\u2014evidence exists for a space of this type. To begin with, representations at early levels of visual processing can describe shape in a manner indifferent to the medium used (e.g., Cavanagh, Arguin, & von Gr\u00fcnau, 1989; Kasai, Morita, & Kumada, 2007), in accord with an abstract representation of the type posited here. In addition, variance appears to be estimated at relatively low levels of vision (Norman, Heywood, & Kentridge, 2015), with variance in one feature dimension influencing the perception of variance in others (Maule & Franklin, 2020), again supporting the possible existence of a representation indifferent to carrier.\nAs to the nature of parameter-space dimensions, all could in principle be entirely abstract, and treated the same way. Position, however, appears to have a special status in visual perception, its coding being involuntary and central to many representations (Cave & Pashler, 1995; Chen, 2009). As such, spatial positions may be anchored in a geometric map, with normalization limited to linear rescaling; if so, distortions of space could affect performance more severely than distortions of other carriers.\n8 Alternatively, this might be done by equalizing the ranges of the values. Since the ratio between standard deviation and range was always set to the same value (viz., 0.2) in all the stimuli here, this issue cannot be investigated using the data in this study."

Given that similar representations are involved, the mechanisms involved may also be similar to each other, and similar to those used for determining correlation in scatterplots. A natural step is then to consider adapting the entropy theory originally developed for scatterplots to parameter space. Entropy theory asserts that perceived correlation is proportional to the entropy of the probability density function that describes the likelihood of an element at any two-dimensional location in space (Appendix A). This can be extended in a straightforward way to the entropy of the density function describing the likelihood of an element with a particular (one-dimensional) location and carrier value; entropy could then be determined in the same way as for scatterplots. Given the normalization and equalization processes posited here, the situation would be much the same as for scatterplots of equal horizontal and vertical extent.

However, I(x,y) is a more derived quantity, generally being defined in terms of H(x,y) and not the other way around; it is difficult to see how it could be computed without recourse to the mechanisms of the kind described here.

The rainbow map and the mapping to circles, however, involve multiple dimensions; interestingly, the results for these generated the only effects that the proposal here does not entirely account for\u2014viz., reliable differences between bdisc and best. Although a framework for multiple dimensions is beyond the scope of the current work, a few tentative observations might still be made about some of the issues involved.\nTo begin with, the efficiency h of a rainbow map (based on discrimination) is greater than for a\ncolor axis (Table 6). This points to a relatively low level of residual noise, suggesting that for this mapping, the red-green and blue-yellow signals are components of a compound signal of some\nkind. In line with this, the ratio of h for the rainbow map to that of a color axis is 0.64 / 0.31 \u2248 2,\nsuggesting that the information in these components is added in some way. The greater signal-tonoise ratio for the rainbow map may account for the finding that it\u2014and more generally, color mappings involving multiple dimensions\u2014is more effective at conveying quantity than mappings that involve a single color dimensions; this may account for its popularity in visualization despite several problems in its use (Borland & Taylor, 2007; Reda &Szafir, 2021). In any event, the finding that bdisc \u2260 best for the rainbow map (contrary to what is found for features like luminance and orientation) shows that not all perceptual continua give rise to exactly the same behavior. In this regard, it may be worth defining a simple carrier as one which follows eqs. (1) and (2) and for which bdisc = best; a complex carrier in contrast would be one which obeys eqs. (1) and (2), but for which the biases are not equal. The findings here would then indicate that single color dimensions are simple carriers, whereas rainbow maps, containing two such dimensions, are complex.\nThe results in regards to the circles (condition 4B) are consistent with this view, in that the carrier may be composed of separate width and height measures (Morgan, 2005; Raidvee et al., 2020).\nThe efficiency h for circles in regards to estimation is greater than for line segments, consistent\nwith the idea that the information in its constituent dimensions has been combined in some way. Interestingly, the difference between bdisc and best for circles goes in the opposite direction as for the rainbow map. This may be due to the dimensions involved with circles being co-ordinated, something that does not occur for the rainbow map. Alternatively, it might reflect the feature being separable or integral (i.e., its component features can or cannot be individually selected): color is a well-known integral property, whereas width and height can be separated for at least some tasks (Pramod & Arun, 2014). If the latter case, the size of the difference between bdisc and best may indicate the degree to which integrality or separability exists. More work on this is needed."

Indeed, the relatively good match with the latter suggests that parameter-space representation may be directly involved in the perception of sensory magnitude.\nA slightly different formula for m can be obtained via the Shannon-Hartley theorem of information\ntheory, which states that m = -1 + \ud835\udc46/\ud835\udc41 , where S is the average signal energy, and N the energy\nof inherent noise (Pierce, 1980).

In the case of luminance, for example, the estimate of about 4 levels is in line with recommendations made in the information visualization literature, where luminance is regarded a relatively poor visual variable for conveying quantitative information, useful mainly for conveying ordinal values (e.g., Bertin, 1967/2011; Cleveland & McGill, 1987; Roth, 2017).\nThe estimate of about 3 distinct levels for a color axis is the lowest of the carriers examined here. This is consistent with opinion in information visualization that color\u2014at least, along these axes\u2014 should not be used to convey quantitative information, instead being confined to ordinal or even just nominal data (Roth, 2017). It is also worth noting that the estimates for both color axes are much the same, and are also not far from that for luminance. (Results consistent with this were also found by Ware, 1988). It has been suggested that color is recoded from its three-color RGB representation in the retina into three orthogonal channels of equal capacity, so as to enable efficient\ntransmission of information (Buchsbaum & Gottschalk, 1983); the results here support this to an extent, indicating that all three channels convey roughly similar amounts of information. In regards to the rainbow map, the finding of about 6 distinct colors falls within the range of 5\u20137 colors estimated from studies on isoluminant target identification (Healey, 1996); this suggests that the results for the rainbow map may be representative of mappings to various two-dimensional color (hue) spaces (cf. Reda &Szafir, 2021). Note that while the higher signal-to-noise ratio for the rainbow map does enable more quantitative levels to be discerned, it also corresponds to a greater bias, making the rainbow stripplot less suitable for accurately representing correlation.\nMeanwhile, the estimate of about 10 levels for orientation is compatible with the belief in information visualization that orientation is well suited for conveying quantitative information; indeed, the results here suggest that for at least some visualization tasks, orientation may be just as useful as position. The number of estimated levels is consistent with work on visual discrimination suggesting that orientation detectors have on average a full bandwidth of 18-24\u00b0 (Gheiratmand & Mullen, 2014), corresponding to about 8-10 levels. It is also compatible with work on visual search indicating that items should have a separation of about 20\u00b0 on average\u2014corresponding to 9 levels\u2014if they are to be perceived as distinct (Wolfe, Friedman-Hill, Stewart, & O'Connell, 1992).\nFinally, the estimate for size is also consistent with recommendations in information visualization, where this property is considered reasonably good for conveying detailed quantitative information (Table 6). It may be worth noting that the estimate here of about 5 levels is similar to the 4-6 size channels posited by several models of spatial vision (e.g., Wilson, McFarlane, & Phillips, 1983). It would be interesting to see if this number also manifests in other aspects of visual perception, such as texture perception or visual search."

            "text": "The data from the experiments here show that perceived correlation is described by a logarithmic function\u2014essentially Fechner\u2019s Law\u2014at least as well as by any power function (Appendix C); this differs from the situation for simple sensory properties, where power functions are typically the best descriptors of perceived magnitude (Ross, 1997). In addition, as mentioned earlier, each JND appears to correspond to a constant number of (abstract) bits, with the value of TC being largely indifferent to carrier (Table 5). Both these findings support the proposal that perceived correlation is not a simple sensory property, but a more abstract quantity no longer linked to the original sensory representation.\nThe validity of Fechner\u2019s Law for correlation perception may stem from the absence of a sensory component in the associated quantity (cf. Billock & Tsou, 2011). If so, other abstract quantities and relationships\u2014which, incidentally, are commonly displayed in visualization\u2014may express similar behavior. It is also worth noting that the Weber fraction for perceived number is 0.2 - 0.25 (Burr & Ross, 2008; Cheyette & Piantadosi, 2020); this value is considerably higher than those for sensory properties (Ross, 1997), but similar to the values found here for k, which is essentially a Weber fraction. This hints that an elevated Weber fraction may be another signature of an abstract\u2014although still relatively low-level\u2014perceptual quantity.\nOther connections are also possible. For example, it has been proposed that the sense of number in high-level reasoning is based on a more basic and automatic sense of continuous magnitude that is amodal and able to integrate the outputs of different perceptual streams (Mix, Levine, & Newcombe, 2016). The origins of such a representation may lie in the parameter space proposed here. More generally, the existence of parameter space itself could provide an interesting perspective on the relationship between perception and cognition: its representations are abstract (i.e., devoid of linkages to physical properties) and thus conceptual, while the processes involved have a density typical of low-level operations that are perceptual (cf. Tacca, 2011). If a sharp divide exists between perception and cognition, on which side would parameter space fall?"

            "heading": "Low-level Perception",
            "text": "The developments here may also connect with several aspects of low-level visual perception. For example, most theories of visual search posit a set of basic visual features rapidly picked up at low levels using little or no attention, with items containing a unique feature able to \u201cpop out\u201d to an observer (see e.g., Wolfe & Utochkin, 2019). All such features examined here\u2014as well as position\u2014appear to be carriers, differing only in their level of residual noise. The question then is the extent to which this holds: are all features carriers? A related issue is the converse: are all carriers features? An interesting possibility is that the set of basic visual features corresponds exactly to the set of carriers; if so, this would provide an independent way of determining whether a given visual property is a basic feature.\nThe proposal of a tight binding of information from different dimensions (via colocation) differs from the views of early theories of search (and related work), which asserted that features are separated at low levels of visual perception (see Treisman, 1996). However, later findings did\npoint to such binding\u2014e.g., search based on features stemming from components that must be bound together correctly (e.g., Duncan, 1984; Enns & Rensink, 1991; Rensink & Enns, 1995). An interesting possibility in this regard is that such bindings exist at low levels and are used for constructive purposes (e.g., to form structures such as parameter space), but are lost in the representations used in the higher-level, conscious control of low-level processing (Rensink, 2015).\nAnother potential connection is with the space in which visual features are located. Most theories of search posit a geometric space (map) at early levels that collates the featural information at each location (Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, Cave, & Franzel, 1989). The elements of parameter space are also located in a such a manifold. And given that average display times in the experiments here are on the order of a second, parameter-space descriptions may well be formed rapidly at early levels, with little or no attention. However, although (normalized) geometric dimensions are part of parameter space, the other dimensions only involve abstract values. Interestingly, the lack of direct linkage with sensory properties may explain a phenomenon that cannot be accounted for by current theories of search: why attention cannot select subsets of different colors when perceiving correlation in scatterplots (Elliott & Rensink, 2019, 2020). In the view of parameter space theory, the information that attention could use to select items in this situation\u2014viz., a representation of the sensory color itself\u2014is simply not there.\nA related connection may also be to ensemble perception, where various statistical properties of sets of items can be rapidly determined with relatively little attention (Alvarez, 2011; Ariely, 2001; Whitney & Leib, 2018; Utochkin, 2015). In particular, the density functions posited for correlation perception may be related to the distributions thought to underlie ensemble coding: both kinds of representation are probabilistic, involve features, and can be carried out relatively rapidly (Rensink,\n2014, 2017). But note that entropy theory involves the widths of density functions rather than their first or second moments. In addition, parameter-space theory asserts that these functions describe a multi-dimensional space anchored in the image, whereas ensembles generally have no such anchoring, effectively having no direct referent in space.\nHowever, parameter space could serve as a basis for the representations thought to underlie both ensemble perception and visual search (and perhaps texture perception). In the case of search, the underlying representations could be viewed as density functions that have been summed over the abstract dimensions, allowing direct reference by position although not by value (Figure 18a). Conversely, ensembles could be viewed as marginal probability densities that have been summed over a given geometric space, able to be referenced by value but not position (Figure 18b). As such, parameter space could be viewed as a space that can\u2014at least conceptually\u2014link the representations underlying visual search and ensemble perception.\nOpen Issues\nAlthough investigation here has touched upon several aspects of visual perception, its results are more a beginning than an end. Various issues remain in regards to better understanding the nature of the phenomena encountered, as well as how they relate to perception in general. These include: 1. Timecourse. How quickly are correlation estimates formed? Although the results here suggest\nthat low levels of processing are involved, it is not clear that the relevant processes are also early\u2014i.e., low-level and rapid, occurring within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing. If such is the case, it would strengthen the connection of carriers to visual features, which are believed to be determined within a similar amount of time. Studying the effect of exposure time on performance would be useful here. A \u201cbasic\u201d stage of correlation perception in scatterplots appears to be complete within c. 400 ms (Rensink, 2014); it would be interesting to see if this limit can be tightened, and whether the same limit applies to other carriers. 2. Spatial interference. The stripplot elements used here are relatively close to each other\u2014\ntypically a fraction of a degree of viewing angle. This makes them susceptible to low-level phenomena such as crowding, which pools information from nearby locations (see Keshvari & Rosenholtz, 2016). There may also be effects\u2014at least for orientation and circles\u2014due to the overlap of adjacent elements (cf. the relatively high JNDs for orientation). Such effects could be explored by varying the number of items and their spacing. For scatterplots, JNDs are higher when 24 or fewer dots are present (Rensink, 2014), while performance is largely unaffected for 48-200 dots. It would be interesting to know if this pattern also holds for stripplots. 3. Attentional selection. When perceiving correlation in a designated set of dots among a second\n(distractor) set, interference always exists, even when the distractor dots differ in color (Elliott & Rensink, 2019, 2020). This indicates a failure to attentionally select items on the basis of\ncolor, Curiously, selection on the basis of color can be easily done when estimating mean values or the numerosity of similar stimuli (Chong & Treisman, 2005), suggesting that the failure may be specific to the perception of correlation. This phenomenon needs further exploration; Does attentional selection also fail for other visual features and other substrates\u2014 e.g., when perceiving correlation in a position-orientation stripplot, could a subset of lines fail to be selected on the basis of color? And what do such failures say about the attentional mechanisms involved? 4. Nature of carriers. The results here point to the existence of complex carriers containing two\nperceptual dimensions. But could carriers contain three dimensions, or even more? Could some involve scene-based properties, such as the three-dimensional orientation encountered in visual search (Enns & Rensink, 1991)11, or the physical (rather than retinal) size found in ensemble perception (Haberman & Suresh, 2020)? Could some kinds of textures be carriers? More generally, could any perceptual continuum be a carrier? And could the amount of residual noise\u2014related to bias b (eqs. (8) and (9))\u2014of a carrier be related to the visual strength of the features involved (Huang, 2015)? 5. Other quantitative functions. The carriers examined here can enable a reasonably accurate\nperception of correlation. But what other quantitative functions might they enable? Could a scatterplot, say, allow accurate detection of nonlinear trends? If so, how well for what kinds of nonlinearities? Would other carriers yield similar performance? Such behavior may provide an additional source of insight into the processes involved. 6. Other aspects of visual perception. Given that the features capable of guiding visual attention\nmay be not the same as the properties that affect grouping, texture perception, or visual\n11 Work in information visualization suggests that quantitative information can be conveyed by three-dimensional\nvolume (Mackinlay, 1986).\ndistinctiveness, or the properties used in visual memory (Cheal & Lyon, 1994; Huang, 2015; Wolfe & Utochkin, 2019), an interesting issue is to determine which\u2014if any\u2014set is identical to the set of carriers. Given that carriers are those channels capable of conveying quantitative information in the manner described here, what other subsets might be identified, and on what functional grounds? How many different aspects might there be, and how might they be related to each other? As well as casting additional light on the nature of low-level visual perception, investigation into this issue would also help clarify why different visual properties appear to be best for different tasks in information visualization (Garlandini & Fabrikant, 2009; Mackinlay, 1986; McColeman, Yang, Brady, & Franconeri, 2021)? 7. Role of abstraction. Another issue to consider is why abstract quantities are represented in the\nfirst place: why not simply use sensory properties for grouping and attentional selection, say, and leave it at that? It is suggested here that abstraction enables information from different carriers to be combined. But is this the only reason? A related issue: where does the decoding into purely abstract quantity occur? Is this during the formation of parameter-space representations? Or might it perhaps occur earlier? An important challenge is to determine the extent to which abstract (vs. sensory-linked) quantities are involved in various kinds of perceptual processing, and why this might be."

            "text": "This study has shown that the features of luminance, color, orientation, and size all support the perception of correlation between values represented by their sensory magnitude and values represented by their spatial position. This suggests that the information in these features can exist in an abstract form\u2014one with no linkage to the original sensory properties (other than the level of\ninherent noise)\u2014which enables information from different perceptual dimensions to be combined. And given that correlation can be perceived when viewing stripplots containing a large number of elements, the information from these dimensions is likely bound in a dense fashion, at relatively low levels of vision.\nAnother finding is that perception is much the same for various kinds of stripplot, as well as for scatterplots, suggesting that the features tested are all carriers\u2014properties capable of conveying quantitative information in the same way as spatial position. This can be accounted for via parameter space theory, which posits a common abstract manifold in which the information about individual elements can be represented via their location in this space. The specific form of these laws can be accounted for by extending the entropy theory developed for scatterplots to this space, via the proposal of a probability density function describing the joint distribution of the values involved. Performance is consistent with perception being that of the entropy (disorder) of this function; the particular behavior for each carrier appears largely due to the amount of residual noise it contains. The estimates of these noise levels are broadly compatible with those found in classic work on absolute perceptual judgment (Miller, 1956).\nThese results provide a new perspective on the nature of visual perception, particularly in regards to the low-level processing believed to underlie tasks such as ensemble perception and visual search, as well as the representation of abstract quantities. It remains to be seen how far this perspective can take us. Meanwhile, the results here make a case for the productive interaction of the areas of vision science and information visualization, using phenomena encountered in visualization as inspiration for research in vision science. Not only can this kind of research enable important aspects of information visualization be put on firmer foundations, but the results can also\ngive us interesting new insights into the nature of the visual intelligence that helps us makes sense of our world (Rensink, 2017, 2021b)."

The general approach of this program is to consider the graphical representations in visualization systems as stimuli in their own right, and investigate accordingly. Such work can potentially uncover new aspects of perception (such as the entropy theory mentioned here), as well as provide a theoretical grounding for several aspects of information visualization itself (see Rensink, 2021b).\nTheir initial focus of this program has been on the perception of correlation, a quantity used in real-world analysis that is relatively easy to isolate. Initial work examined the perception of correlation in scatterplots, a real-world design that can be manipulated in many ways. This study continues that approach, extending it to properties beyond position. The results here would seem to justify investigations of this kind. Several possible avenues to explore in the near future are discussed in the Open Issues section; these include investigations of the nature of carriers, as well as the effects of timing and the number of elements. Further in the future, investigation might focus on other issues related to visualization, such as the perception of outliers and the perception of clusters, two other tasks for which scatterplots are commonly used. More generally yet, it may also be worth considering yet other kinds of visualization designs, which could enable us to uncover even more aspects of our visual intelligence."

            "text": "This appendix briefly outlines the main aspects of entropy theory as it applies to the perception of correlation in scatterplots. For details, see Rensink (2017).\nThe probability density function f (x,y)DxDy of a scatterplot dot cloud specifies the probability of\nencountering a dot in the area DxDy (Figure 3); for a scatterplot with n dots, the number of dots in\nDxDy would be n f (x,y)DxDy. The scatterplots in Rensink (2017) mostly had bivariate gaussian\ndistributions. Such distributions, centered at the origin with standard deviation s and correlation\nr, have a probability density function\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) = !!\"($,&)\n#$ %(('()())/( (A1)\nwhere\n\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66) = +((#)+,- ,(\n#%(('()() . (A2)\nThe set of points at a constant fraction of the height of f (x,y) can be expressed as \ud835\udc52#,#, where K is a positive constant. The locations of these points form an isofraction ellipse q(x,y) = \ud835\udc3e! (Figure 3). The width w of this ellipse (twice its radius) is\n\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc5f) = 2 \u221a2\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udf0e\u221a1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f . (A3)\nInformation entropy (in the Shannon sense) H is a statistical quantity that reflects the number of possible configurations for a given probability density; it is essentially a measure of dispersion or disorder of the distribution (see, e.g., Ben-Naim, 2008). For a scatterplot of n dots with a gaussian distribution of correlation r,\n\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b (2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0e!\u221a1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f!) + B, (A4)\nwhere A and B are constants. This can be approximated fairly well by H\u2019(r)=A\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b (2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0e!\u221a1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) + B\u2019, where A and B\u2019 are constants. If H\u2019 is proportional to perceived correlation g(r), application of eq. (A3) results in\ng(r) = C ln(w(r)) + D\nfor constants C and D. Rreplacing w(r) via eq. (A3) then yields\ng(r) = C ln(1-br) + D\u2019 (A5)\nfor constants b, C, and D\u2019. The term 0 < b < 1 is introduced to account for the residual noise \ud835\udc64()* caused by perceptual noise and blurring. This prevents divergence of the logarithm as r approaches 1 and the width of the isofraction ellipse approaches zero (Figure 16); it essentially sets the upper limit of entropy for a given carrier. It can be expressed (Rensink, 2017) as\n, (A6)\nwhere\n\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc64()* 2\u221a2\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udf0e.\u2044 (A7)\nThe other two constraints are those of calibration, viz., setting g(0) = 0 and g(1) = 1. Applying these to eq. (A5) results in the form used in the main body of the text, viz., eq. (2).\nThe fractional height \ud835\udc52#,# can be determined by noting that the scatterplots in Rensink (2017) had\na range of 5s in each dimension, yielding \ud835\udc5a = 5\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc64()*\u2044 + 1 distinct positions. Eliminating \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc64()*\u2044 in this formula via eq. (A7) and rearranging terms, it follows that\n\ud835\udc3e = 5 / (2\u221a2 \ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc5a \u2212 1)). (A8)\nFor position, m = 9.5 and b = 0.90 (c = 0.33), yielding \ud835\udc3e = 0.63, and the fraction 0.67. For r = 0,\nf(x,y) is a symmetric gaussian with isofraction circle of radius \u221a2 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udf0e \u2248 0.9 s; for r > 0, the circle\nbecomes an ellipse with half-width \u221a2 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udf0e\u221a1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f (Rensink, 2017, eq. (8)).\n\u20ac\nb = 1 c 2 +1\nThe estimate of this radius is close to s, where the density function f is steepest, and so most\nsensitive to changes in width (and thus, r). This is also true of the ellipse: given that f is a linearly compressed version of a circularly symmetric function, the location of the steepest slope in any cross-section is not affected. This suggests a rationale for the location of the isofraction ellipse: what might be called a principle of maximal sensitivity. Such a principle would imply that the ellipse is defined by \u2207!\ud835\udc53 = 0, where \u2207! operates over parameter space. (The same formula may also define luminance edges in images \u2014 see e.g., Marr, 1982). If this principle holds, estimates of m for all carriers follow without recourse to relative measures; estimates based on this (eq. (A8),\nwith \u221a2 \ud835\udc3e = 1) are shown in Table A1. Most results are slightly higher than the measures based on eqs. (10) and (11). But the average difference between the measures is only 15%, suggesting that the maximum-sensitivity principle may indeed hold to at least some extent, with isofraction ellipses corresponding to much the same fraction for all carriers.\nCarrier Levels (MS) Levels (noise) Levels (S-H) Levels (obs.)\nLuminance 4.9 [4.4, 5.5] 4.3 [3.8, 4.9] 3.8 [3.2, 4.4] 2.7 \u2013 4.8 Color (axis) 4.3 [3.6, 5.0] 3.7 [3.1, 4.3] 3.1 [2.6, 3.8] \u2014 Color (rainbow) 6.9 [5.5, 8.7] 6.5 [4.9, 9.5] 6.2 [4.4, 9.5] 3.1 \u2013 9.6 Orientation 9.1 [7.9, 10.5] 10.4 [8.0, 16.5] 10.5 [7.8, 17.2] 6.3 \u2013 9.4 Size (length) 5.8 [4.8, 7.2] 5.2 [4.1, 6.8] 4.8 [3.6, 6.5] 2.1 \u2013 7.4\nTable A1: Number of distinct levels in individual carriers, based on a possible maximum sensitivity principle.

As is evident, the logarithmic model (Fechner\u2019s Law) provides a better fit to the data than any other law with one parameter, including the power law of the form typical of sensory magnitude perception (eq. 1; Ross, 1997). If two parameters are allowed, fits for the more complex models 5 and 7 are about 25% better.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1A 0.0158 0.0228 0.0522 0.0345 0.0191 0.0143 0.0183 0.0154 1B 0.0188 0.0229 0.0593 0.0361 0.0218 0.0161 0.0237 0.0148 1C 0.0171 0.0246 0.0608 0.0295 0.0228 0.0156 0.0230 0.0147 1D 0.0164 0.0261 0.0506 0.0376 0.0233 0.0120 0.0240 0.0120 2A 0.0413 0.0328 0.0953 0.0543 0.0218 0.0328 0.0382 0.0138 2B 0.0318 0.0240 0.0827 0.0468 0.0200 0.0233 0.0318 0.0138 2C 0.0160 0.0212 0.0637 0.0314 0.0205 0.0118 0.0234 0.0107 3A 0.0287 0.0416 0.0379 0.0535 0.0385 0.0115 0.0377 0.0171 3B 0.0189 0.0425 0.0254 0.0399 0.0320 0.0255 0.0213 0.0211 3C 0.0123 0.0458 0.0161 0.0368 0.0281 0.0177 0.0177 0.0236 4A 0.0105 0.0229 0.0532 0.0283 0.0179 0.0115 0.0172 0.0128 4B 0.0310 0.0300 0.0362 0.0560 0.0264 0.0127 0.0274 0.0261\nAvg. 0.0215 0.0298 0.0528 0.0404 0.0244 0.0171 0.0253 0.0163 Table B1: RMSE values for the best fits for each model to the data. RSS (Residual sum of squares) values are the square of these times 7.\nTo account for the number of degrees of freedom, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used (Burnham & Anderson, 2002); AIC = 2\ud835\udc3e + \ud835\udc5b ln ((2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46/\ud835\udc5b) + 1), where K is the number of parameters, and n the number of data points fit in the model. The lower the value of AIC, the better the fit. Results are shown in Table B2. As is evident, the logarithmic model still has an AIC value greater than those for power functions 5 and 7, but the difference is relatively small.12\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n1A -36.19 -31.07 -19.47 -25.26 -31.54 -35.56 -32.12 -34.55 1B -33.76 -30.98 -17.68 -24.63 -29.72 -33.98 -28.52 -35.08 1C -35.09 -29.99 -17.35 -27.47 -29.06 -34.39 -28.93 -35.17 1D -35.71 -29.20 -19.91 -24.07 -28.74 -38.02 -28.36 -38.10 2A -22.75 -25.96 -11.05 -18.92 -29.71 -23.97 -21.85 -36.11 2B -26.39 -30.36 -13.03 -20.99 -30.88 -28.76 -24.40 -36.06 2C -35.99 -32.06 -16.70 -26.59 -30.52 -38.33 -28.69 -39.64 3A -27.86 -22.66 -23.94 -19.13 -21.75 -38.61 -22.03 -33.08 3B -33.72 -22.35 -29.54 -23.23 -24.34 -27.51 -30.01 -30.17 3C -39.70 -21.32 -35.97 -24.37 -26.13 -32.65 -32.60 -28.60 4A -41.98 -30.99 -19.22 -28.05 -32.43 -38.64 -33.03 -37.14 4B -26.78 -27.21 -24.61 -18.50 -27.00 -37.30 -26.51 -27.16 Avg. -32.99 -27.85 -20.71 -23.43 -28.48 -33.98 -28.09 -34.24 Table B2: AIC values for the best fits of each model to the data.\nFor a univariate function fit by a small number of points (as is the case here), a more accurate form is AICc = AIC + penalty(K), where penalty(K) is a positive term that discourages overfitting. Although penalty(K) differs for different models, it increases with the number of degrees of freedom K. As such, estimates for two-parameter models (such as models 5 and 7) would be raised more than for one-parameter models. This would reduce the difference even further, if not reverse it outright. As such, the fit of Fechner\u2019s Law to the data here would seem at least comparable to that for any reasonable variant of a power law.\n12 Assuming that the conditions tested here are representative, the AIC values for the three functions have confidence\nintervals which overlap substantially: [-29.57, -36.41], [-31.10, -36.86], and [-31.99, -36.49], respectively."
