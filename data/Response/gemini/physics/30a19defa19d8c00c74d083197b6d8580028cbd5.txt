1. **Investigate the effect of different polymer backbones on the performance of PIL-based membranes.** The current study focused on polystyrene as the polymer backbone, but other polymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinylidene fluoride), and poly(ether sulfone), could also be used. These polymers have different properties, such as glass transition temperature, hydrophilicity, and free volume, which could affect the performance of the resulting membranes.


2. **Explore the use of different ionic liquids as counterions in PILs.** In this study, three different anions were investigated: hexafluorophosphate, tetrafluoroborate, and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. Other anions, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, could also be used. These anions have different properties, such as size, shape, and polarity, which could affect the performance of the resulting membranes.


3. **Investigate the effect of PIL composition on membrane performance.** The current study focused on PILs with a single type of cation and anion. However, it is also possible to prepare PILs with multiple types of cations and anions. This could allow for the fine-tuning of membrane properties, such as permeability, selectivity, and mechanical strength.


4. **Study the long-term stability of PIL-based membranes.** The current study did not investigate the long-term stability of the PIL-based membranes. However, this is an important consideration for practical applications. PILs can be susceptible to degradation over time, which could lead to a decrease in membrane performance.


5. **Explore the use of PIL-based membranes for other gas separation applications.** The current study focused on the separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4. However, PIL-based membranes could also be used for other gas separation applications, such as the separation of hydrogen from nitrogen, the separation of oxygen from nitrogen, and the separation of volatile organic compounds from air.
