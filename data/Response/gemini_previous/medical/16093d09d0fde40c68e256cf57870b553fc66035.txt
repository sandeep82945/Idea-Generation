1. **Investigate the role of dendritic cells in the activation of the immune response to PPRV vaccination.** 
Dendritic cells are responsible for recognizing PPRV over toll-like receptor 2, which results in the proliferation and differentiation of T cells and the production of cytokines. By understanding the role of dendritic cells in the immune response to PPRV vaccination, we can develop strategies to improve the efficacy of vaccines.


2. **Compare the immune response to PPRV vaccination in different goat breeds.** 
The results of this study suggest that the immune response to PPRV vaccination may vary across goat breeds. By comparing the immune response in different breeds, we can identify breeds that are more resistant to PPRV infection and develop vaccines that are more effective in these breeds.


3. **Investigate the duration of immunity following PPRV vaccination.** 
The results of this study suggest that the immune response to PPRV vaccination may wane over time. By investigating the duration of immunity following vaccination, we can determine how often goats need to be vaccinated to maintain protection against PPRV infection.


4. **Evaluate the efficacy of PPRV vaccines against field strains of the virus.** 
The results of this study suggest that the commercially available live-attenuated PPRV vaccine strain Nigeria 75/1 is effective against the PPRV strain used in the study. However, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine against other field strains of the virus to ensure that it is effective against all strains of PPRV.


5. **Develop new PPRV vaccines that are more effective and safer.** 
The results of this study suggest that there is a need for new PPRV vaccines that are more effective and safer. By developing new vaccines, we can improve the control and eradication of PPRV.
