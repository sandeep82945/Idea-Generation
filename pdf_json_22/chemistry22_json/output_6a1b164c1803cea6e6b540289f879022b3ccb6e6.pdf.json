            "text": "Wastewater effluents from textile production are considered as one of the largest contributors to water pollution. These effluents have several unique characteristics, such as (1) heavy colour issues due to the presence of various dyes, (2) high chemical oxygen demand leading to high pollution issues, (3) high salinity and heavy metal concentration etc., which make them not readily biodegradable.1 There are many combinations of conventional wastewater treatment technologies that employ physical, chemical and biological treatment techniques to treat this textile wastewater.2 It has been found that approaches such as activated carbon,3 coagulation/occulation,4 and membrane technologies5 could separate the dye contaminants from the aqueous phase to the solid phase, but without completely eliminating them. Therefore, the disadvantages of current techniques are obvious due to their high cost, low treatment efficiency and associated secondary pollution issues for further disposal. To some extent, the resultant sludges are toxic byproducts and large carbon footprints are inevitably involved for their further disposal,6 thus accentuating the need for developing \u2018cleaner\u2019 alternative approaches.7 With the growing emphasis on sustainability and advancement in technology, the\nering, Nanyang Technological University,\n@ntu.edu.sg version, Institute of Urban Environment, 1, China\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nuse of TiO2 photocatalysts has begun to receive increasing attention.8\u201310 The employment of nanostructured TiO2 with renewable solar energy as the energy input for photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) decontamination offers an efficient and costeffective method for the treatment of this industrial wastewater.11\nThere are several developed approaches used for the synthesis of TiO2 photocatalyst such as hydrothermal methods,12 electrochemical anodization13 and electrochemical deposition,14,15 of which the one step electrospinning has shown considerable potential as an innovative and \u2018green\u2019 alternative technology,16 especially in the eld of fabricating one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials with large length-to diameter ratio and excellent properties for pollutants adsorption, degradation and removal. In general, 1D TiO2 nanobers obtained through electrospinning exhibit signicant benets such as high surface-tovolume ratio, open porous structure and unique material properties allowing it to be easily recycled thus permitting it to be employed in various industries.16 However, there are two key limitations of TiO2 which limits its potential. Firstly, the generation of the photo-excited holes and electrons can only be achieved by UV irradiation (l < 380 nm) which renders the use of solar irradiation inefficient due to wide band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV anatase).10,17 Secondly, the life time of the photo-excited electrons and holes have limited mobility arising from the recombination of electron\u2013hole pair.17,18\nTherefore, in order to narrow the band gap and improve its photocatalytic performance, materials chemists and\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25449\u201325456 | 25449\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Herein, Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanobers were unprecedentedly designed and prepared by an effective onestep electrospinning approach to study their PCO decontamination efficiency for treating textile wastewaters. A key benet to the heterostructured BTO and TiO2 from the one-step electrospinning lies in the fact that the uniform mixing of BTO and TiO2 precursor at molecular level will facilitate the close contact between Bi and TiO2 in the formed materials, which will greatly improve the electrons transfer allowing for better photocatalytic activity.17,28"

The diffraction patterns of the nanober calcined at various temperatures revealed the successful formation of a heterostructure nanostructure with both Bi2Ti4O11 and TiO2 crystalline structures. As observed, the Bi2Ti4O11 diffraction were not prominent due to the low concentration of bismuth precursor and convolution of the diffraction patterns of TiO2 anatase phase and Bi2Ti4O11\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nphase.17 Moreover, from the increased peak intensity of the Bi2Ti4O11 species at higher temperatures, it can be suggested that a higher degree of crystallisation is required to enhance the detection of the Bi2Ti4O11 species. The TiO2 crystallinity and crystallite size also increased as the calcination temperature increased. It was observed that the strength of the anatase diffraction peaks had been intensied at higher calcination temperature. The progressive narrowing of the width of the anatase peaks was attributed to the growth of the TiO2 crystal as the calcination temperature increased.36 This is further corroborated by the calculation of crystallite sizes using the Scherrer equation of the anatase (101) plane diffraction peak (cf. Table 1). In addition, from the nature of the XRD patterns, it shows that the presence of the Bi2Ti4O11 did not affect the phase transformation of the TiO2, thus implying that the Bi precursor did not substitute Ti to enter the TiO2 lattice but was formed through a heterojunction which assimilates the Bi2Ti4O11 crystal phase and TiO2 crystal phase.37\n3.1.2 Elemental composition. The XRD analysis as illustrated in Fig. 3 further substantiates the stability of the anatase phase. No phase transformation occurred when the temperatures rising from 450 C to 750 C. EDX analysis was conducted to determine the possible elements in the heterostructure nanobers. As illustrated in the elemental mapping (Fig. 4(a)), the Bi species was highly dispersed within the heterostructure nanobers, thus implying the homogeneous nature of the electrospinning gel. EDX spectrum as shown in Fig. 4(b) indicates the presence of the 3 elements: Ti, Bi and O. A highly dispersed elemental dispersion helps to optimise the contact between the TiO2 and Bi2Ti4O1 heterojunction, allowing for an efficient electron transfer between the conduction band (CB) phases and resulting in improved photocatalysis.19\nMoreover, the EDX analysis also revealed that the weight ratio of the bismuth component was 3.34 wt%, which corresponds to the amount of bismuth precursor added to the gel as described in previous Section 2.1.1. This nding supports the fact of weak diffraction peaks for the Bi2Ti4O11 species as a consequence of the low concentration and well dispersed nature of the Bi precursor.35\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25449\u201325456 | 25451\nTable 1 Physiochemical characteristics of synthesised Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanofiber\nSamples BET specic surface area (m2 g 1)\nEstimated pore diameter (nm) estimated with BJH\nFull width at half maximum (deg)\nAnatase TiO2 crystallite size (nm)\nBi-450C 57.56 3.63 0.67 12.64 Bi-550C 34.96 3.64 0.55 15.57 Bi-650C 12.29 3.03 0.38 22.19 Bi-750C 6.39 2.66 0.34 24.94 TiO2 NF (550C) (anatase phase) 27.582 3.63 0.56 15.18\nFig. 4 (a) Elemental mapping for the selected area of Ti, Bi and O elements, (b) EDX spectrum of electron image shown in (a).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The FESEM image in Fig. 5(a) shows the representative morphology of the synthesised heterostructure nanober calcined at 550 C. Evidently, the heterostructure nanober have diameters ranging from 70 to 100 nm with an aspect ratio from 25 to 55. The humidity control using N2 gas prior to the electrospinning ensured the formation of the highly uniform structure. Fig. 5(b) shows the heterostructure nanober under higher magnication aer calcination at 550 C. It revealed that the nanober possessed a rough and porous surface structure, thus indicating the potential of the heterostructure to provide more active sites for improvement in photocatalytic activity. This change in surface characteristics provides additional sites for adsorption as well as enhances photocatalysis through the provision of more trapping sites, thus extending the life time of charge carriers. The formation of the porous surface structure is a result from the calcination process, which led to the oxidation of organic materials. The polymer binder used in the precursor resulted in the change from a smooth to a porous surface structure as well as the decrease in nanober diameter.23 Most importantly, it allowed the crystallisation of the TiO2 and Bi2Ti4O11 phases which is essential in inducing its photocatalytic properties through the phase transformation arising from the thermal treatment.\n25452 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25449\u201325456\nThe TEM image in Fig. 5(c) exemplies the detailed porous microstructure, which was also observed in Fig. 5(b). The porous structure is conducive for photocatalysis as it provides channels for the reactants to adsorb onto the surface of the nanobers. In addition, the TEM image shows the nanober comprises of granular nanocrystals denoting good crystallinity which is essential to facilitate charge transfer to achieve efficient photocatalytic activity. As presented in Fig. 5(d), the high magnication HRTEM image clearly reveals the distinguished interface contact and continuity between the lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.325 nm and 0.295 nm. These two distinctive lattice fringes correspond to the (101) plane of anatase TiO238 and the (171) plane of Bi2Ti4O11, respectively,39 which substantiates the fact that the nanober is formed of a heterostructure consisting of anatase TiO2 and the Bi2Ti4O11 crystalline phase.\n3.1.4 Porous properties and specic surface area. In order to study porosity of the prepared heterostructure nanobers, BET nitrogen sorption measurements were carried out. When calcination temperature increased from 450 C to 750 C, the surface area of samples decreased from 57.56 m2 g 1 to 6.39 m2 g 1 (Table 1). Evidently, the decrease in BET specic surface area was consistent with the growth of the anatase TiO2\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Moreover, from the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms (Fig. 6), the heterostructure nanober comprise of mesopores (Table 1).40 Through the analysis, it was observed that, Bi-450C, Bi-550C, Bi-650C demonstrated a greater adsorbate\u2013adsorbent and adsorbate\u2013 adsorbate interactions41,42 thus implying the occurrence of capillary condensation within mesopores. Meanwhile, the isotherms of Bi-750C showed weak interactions of the adsorbate\u2013adsorbent arising from the enhanced crystal growth at higher calcination temperature.\nAdditionally, from the BET analysis, it can be noted that the formation of the heterojunction between the Bi2Ti4O11 and TiO2 phases enlarged the surface area of the nanobers. The heterostructure nanober showed a 25% increase in the surface area as compared to the pure TiO2 nanober. This increase in BET specic surface area was due to the presence of the well dispersed bismuth elements in the electrospinning precursor, which allowed for the formation of additional active sites comprising of the Bi2Ti4O11 crystal phase aer thermal treatment. This conrms that the formation of the heterostructure structure through the heterojunction has increased the amounts of available reactions sites for the access of reactants for photocatalysis. Furthermore, the observed increase in BET specic surface area also promotes the adsorption and mass transfer of the pollutants. Hence, considering these advantages it is plausible that the heterojunction formed in the Bi2Ti4O11/ TiO2 heterostructure nanober would improve the photocatalytic performance as compared to pure TiO2 nanobers."

The photocatalytic activity of the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanober was evaluated based on the degradation of a model dye, AO7, under visible-light irradiation. There are more than 100 000 kinds of dyes in the industry and AO7 is a water-soluble dye which is considered as a pervasive pollutant due to its potential to form cocontaminants for nitrates. To model the photocatalytic degradation, Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood kinetics was applied.43 As\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As the concentration of AO7 was low, it can be readily presumed that KC was 1. Hence, the reaction kinetics can be further simplied as indicated in eqn (2):\nr \u00bc dC dt \u00bc kKC \u00bc kC (2)\nwhere k refers to the corresponding reaction rate kinetic constant. Assuming that the decolourisation of AO7 follows a reaction pathway of a pseudo rst-order reaction rate, the reaction kinetics can be further simplied in eqn (3).\nln Ct C0 \u00bc kt (3)\nwhere Ct (mg L 1) is the concentration of AO7 at the reaction time of t (min), Co is the initial AO7 concentration measured aer 120 min of dark adsorption and t is the reaction time. Using the pseudo rst-order kinetics described in eqn (3), the degradation trend of AO7 is presented in Fig. 6. The logarithms of normalised AO7 concentration were plotted against the irradiation time. The corresponding k constants (gradient) (Table 2) provide a good measure of the overall photodegradation rate since it is apparent from the plot that the degradation trend follows the derived rst order kinetics.44\n3.2.2 Efficiency comparison. The photocatalytic degradation tests (Fig. 7) showed that the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanober calcined at 550 C (Bi-550C) had the highest photocatalytic efficiency in the degradation of AO7 under visible light irradiation. The degradation rate of the Bi-550C heterostructure nanober was approximately 2 times more efficient than heterostructure nanober calcined at 750 C (Bi-750C, 1.71 10 2 min 1), suggesting that the physiochemical changes arising from the increase in calcination temperature had a signicant impact on the visible light driven photocatalysis.36\nThe heterostructure nanober calcined at 750 C (Bi-750C) has a BET specic surface area of 6.39 m2 g 1, much lower than that of the nanober calcined at 550 C (Bi-550C, 34.96 m2 g 1). This indicates that the increase in calcination temperature might have led to the collapse of the microporous structure (which exists at lower temperatures),45,46 thus resulting in an inferior mass transport between the model pollutant and the heterostructure nanober. The less porousness makes more difficult for the pollutant to enter the pore channel of the heterostructure nanober.42,47 Consequently, this resulted in a lower photocatalytic efficiency due to the decrease in the active sites available for reactions (arising from the smaller BET specic surface area).\n3.2.3 Simulation of degradation kinetics. Comparing the photocatalytic efficiencies (Table 2) of the Bi-450C, Bi-550C and Bi-650C, the Bi-550C had a photocatalytic efficiency of 1.21 times greater than the Bi-450C and 1.12 times of the Bi-650C,\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25449\u201325456 | 25453\nTable 2 Modelled degradation kinetics of Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 nanofiber in the degradation of Acid Orange 7\nSample ID Degradation rate, k (min 1) Standard deviation R2\nEstimate band gap, Eg (eV)\nPhotolysis 1.04 10 2 7.58 10 5 0.9639 \u2014 Bi-450C 2.80 10 2 2.17 10 3 0.9594 3.08 Bi-550C 3.38 10 2 2.44 10 3 0.9645 3.08 Bi-650C 3.01 10 2 2.48 10 3 0.9543 3.12 Bi-750C 1.71 10 2 1.28 10 3 0.9622 3.11 TiO2 NF 550C 1.28 10 2 1.06 10 3 0.9538 3.32\nFig. 7 (a) Normalised concentration curves showing the timedependent degradation of AO7 by various photocatalysts under visible light irradiation.

This indicates that the higher crystallinity of both Bi2Ti4O11 and anatase TiO2 phase of the heterostructure nanober calcined at 550 C allowed for better charge transport and effective suppression of electrons and hole.36,42 Despite having a lower surface area than Bi-450C, the Bi-550C has also provided the balance between the bismuth titanate phase and titanium dioxide phases as well as the mesoporous characteristics of the heterostructure nanober, favouring photocatalysis.\nThe Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanobers showed a greater photocatalytic efficiency in degrading AO7 under visible light irradiation. As reected in Table 2, the photo\n25454 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 25449\u201325456\ndegradation rate of AO7 by Bi-550C was 2.64 times greater than that of pure TiO2 nanober. This is possibly attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption arising from the heterojunction formed between the Bi2Ti4O11 and the TiO2 anatase phase (cf. Fig. 5(d)). The formation of this heterojunction coupled with the optimised geometry from the microporous structure of the nanober allowed for the travel of electron\u2013hole pairs to a shorter diffused pathway to reach the active surface sites of the photocatalyst, therefore ensuring a more effective suppression of the electron\u2013hole recombination.33,48 Moreover, the diffuse reectance analysis revealed that the heterostructure nanobers possessed a lower estimated optical band gap (ranging from 3.08 to 3.11 eV) than that of the pure TiO2 nanober (3.32 eV) (Table 2). The lower band gap (due to the presence of the Bi2Ti4O11) can be interpreted as an improved light absorption capacity in the visible-light region.49"

The selected samples were repeatedly used aer separation via vacuum ltration, and the results are presented in Fig. 8. As shown, there were no signicant changes in the photocatalytic activity of Bi-550C aer ve cycles as the degradation efficiencies of AO7 remained virtually unchanged. This indicates that Bi-550C has good structural stability under visible light irradiation for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants. Therefore, it is viable to employ these photocatalysts for practical applications as the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanobers have long lifespan for reuse."

The efficient photocatalytic performance of the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanobers can be attributed to the combination of the following factors: (i) the enhanced mesoporosity and surface area as discussed can engender more reaction sites for reactant adsorption andmass transfer. (ii) The structural properties of the long nanobers as well as the anatase TiO2 phase allow for efficient inhibition of the recombination of photogenerated electrons. To explain the probable electron transfer process between the phases in the Bi2Ti4O11/ TiO2 heterostructure nanobers, a schematic diagram shown in\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The transfer of electrons from the excited valence band of the Bi2Ti4O11 under visible light was promoted due to the up shi of the valence band. Consequently, the photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of the anatase phase is easily utilised for the photocatalytic degradation of AO7 under visible light irradiation. It is proposed that the Bi2Ti4O11 phase (3.08 eV) lies above that of the anatase TiO2 (3.32 eV). Moreover, the formation of the heterojunction between the Bi2Ti4O11 phase and the anatase TiO2 phase allowed for a favourable separation of electrons and holes due to the effect of the inner electric eld.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, upon harvesting the of photon energy from the simulated solar irradiation, it leads to the excitation of electrons which travels from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) leaving holes in the VB of the Bi2Ti4O11 phase. Here due to the heterojunction formed between the phases, the electrons from the CB of the Bi2Ti4O11 could transfer to the CB of the anatase TiO2.17,28 As these photoexcited electrons and holes separate and migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst, it reacts with the aqueous phase generating\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The holes would react with adsorbed hydroxyl groups in the aqueous phase or on the surface of the photocatalyst forming oxidation species such as (OHc).17 Meanwhile, the electrons would react with adsorbed O2 to produce O2\nand further degrade AO7. Consequently, through this effective transfer of electrons it would reduce the recombination of the electrons and hole due to the formation of the heterojunction formed between the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2. Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation for the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 can be ascribed to: (1) the enhanced visible light absorption, (2) the good adsorption of model pollutants and (3) the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.50"

            "text": "This study demonstrated a successful and facile method to synthesize an enhanced visible light driven nanober photocatalysts with a heterojunction formed between the Bi2Ti4O11 (171 phase) and anatase TiO2 (101 phase). Experimental results revealed that the Bi2Ti4O11/TiO2 heterostructure nanober showed superior photocatalytic performance than compared to pure TiO2 in the degradation of the model textile dye AO7 under visible light irradiation. First, the Bi phase was evenly distributed through the heterostructure nanober, indicating that the uniform mixing occurring at the molecular level allowed for the formation of heterojunction between the highly crystalline Bi2Ti4O11 phase and the anatase TiO2 phase. Second, owing to the formation of this heterojunction, it shied the absorption edge to a longer wavelength. Third, the presence of the Bi2Ti4O11 titanate phase coupled with the morphological characteristics of the nanobers allowed for amore effective transfer of electrons through the reduced recombination of electrons and holes. Fourth, the heterostructure nanobers have demonstrated excellent photo-stability aer undergoing multiple reuses, signifying the robust nature of the heterostructure photocatalyst for practical engineering applications with the use of sustainable visible light or solar utilisation. In view for practical engineering application in treating wastewater through fully exploiting the abundant solar light in sustainable manner, it is believed that the developed Bi2Ti4O11/ TiO2 heterojunction nanobers may not only be limited for the employment of textile wastewater degradation but also can be used for other photocatalytic application in environmental remediation.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
