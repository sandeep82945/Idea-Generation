    "abstractText": "We establish how the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is realized on tilings of two-dimensional Euclidean Anti\u2013de Sitter space. For the continuum, the BF bound states that on Anti\u2013de Sitter spaces, fluctuation modes remain stable for small negative mass squared m. This follows from a real and positive total energy of the gravitational system. For finite cutoff \u03b5, we solve the Klein-Gordon equation numerically on regular hyperbolic tilings. When \u03b5 \u2192 0, we find that the continuum BF bound is approached in a manner independent of the tiling. We confirm these results via simulations of a hyperbolic electric circuit. Moreover, we propose a novel circuit including active elements that allows us to further scan values of m above the BF bound.",

For the continuum, the BF bound states that on Anti\u2013de Sitter spaces, fluctuation modes remain stable for small negative mass squared m2. This follows from a real and positive total energy of the gravitational system. For finite cutoff \u03b5, we solve the Klein-Gordon equation numerically on regular hyperbolic tilings. When \u03b5 \u2192 0, we find that the continuum BF bound is approached in a manner independent of the tiling. We confirm these results via simulations of a hyperbolic electric circuit. Moreover, we propose a novel circuit including active elements that allows us to further scan values of m2\nabove the BF bound.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.091604\nIntroduction.\u2014The AdS=CFT correspondence [1\u20133], also known as holography, maps gravitational theories in (d\u00fe 1)-dimensional hyperbolic Anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes to strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) without gravity in d dimensions, defined on the AdS boundary. The AdS=CFT duality provides a precise map between CFT operators and AdS gravity fields, which is of great significance both for fundamental aspects of quantum gravity [4] and for applications to strongly correlated condensed matter systems [5]. Motivated by the goal to provide a new example of holographic duality, as well as possible realizations in tabletop experiments, in this Letter we report novel insights in this direction for discretized systems. A prime candidate is a scalar field defined on discretizations of AdS space via regular hyperbolic tilings (see Fig. 1) [6,7], which have been recently investigated using methods from lattice gauge theory in Refs. [8\u201311]. These works consider discretization schemes for the scalar action, the Laplace operator, and lattice bulk propagators, finding good agreement of the scaling behavior of correlation functions with analytic continuum results. The physics of hyperbolic tilings has recently been studied in the context of condensed matter physics [12], circuit quantum electrodynamics [13\u201315], and topolectric circuits [16\u201318]. These works focus on the spectrum of tight-binding Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices and their\nrealization based on coupled waveguide resonators [12,14,15] or classical nondissipative linear electric circuits (topolectric circuits). Time-resolved measurements of wave propagation in hyperbolic space have been achieved in such architectures [17]. It remains an open question, though, how to establish a duality in the sense of a map between bulk and boundary theories for hyperbolic tessellations. Steps in this direction were taken in Refs. [19,20] using modular discretizations and in Ref. [21] via tensor networks on hyperbolic buildings. In this Letter, we focus on hyperbolic tilings as a discretization scheme instead. The starting point is one of the key results of the continuum AdS=CFT correspondence, namely the relation between the mass m of a scalar field in the bulk and the scaling dimension \u0394 of its dual\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

This is determined by the asymptotic boundary behavior of the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in AdS space. Conformally transforming AdS space into flat space, the scalar field experiences a shift of its mass squared to m2l2 \u00fe d2=4. Thus, there is a stable potential minimum for the field ifm2l2 > \u2212d2=4, i.e., even for small negative mass squared. This is the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound [22\u201324]. In this Letter, we determine how the BF bound is realized\nin discrete holographic setups and how it manifests itself on finite-sized architectures accessible through simulation and experiment. We establish the BF bound for hyperbolic tessellations by first analyzing the properties of the continuum analytical solutions in the presence of a finite cutoff. This cutoff can be chosen arbitrarily and is required because only finite tilings, which do not cover the entirety of hyperbolic space, can be experimentally and numerically realized. In particular, this cutoff is independent of the Schl\u00e4fli parameter fp; qg characterizing a regular hyperbolic tiling with q regular p-gons meeting at each vertex. Defining a scalar field on the vertices, we numerically solve the associated equations of motion on several tilings, finding excellent agreement with results from continuum holography. We find that the stability bound of a scalar field defined on large enough fp; qg hyperbolic tilings coincides with the continuum BF bound, independently of p and q. Our analysis extends previous investigations [13,15,17] of the eigenvalue problem of the discrete Laplacian on these tilings. In particular, we use insights from holography, such as the presence of non-normalizable modes, to provide solutions for masses squared above the BF bound, thus beyond the standard spectrum of the Laplacian. Moreover, we propose a novel electric circuit, in the spirit of topolectric circuits [26,27], to access these new mass-squared values in experiment. Equations of motion on EAdS2.\u2014In order to investigate the physics of the BF bound for hyperbolic tilings, we consider one of the simplest continuum systems admitting a holographic duality, a free massive scalar field Euclidean AdS2 (EAdS2), with the induced metric\nds2 \u00bc g\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bcdx\u03bd \u00bc l2\ncos2\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00f0d\u03b8 2 \u00fe sin2\u00f0\u03b8\u00ded\u03d52\u00de: \u00f01\u00de\nHere, l is the curvature radius of EAdS2, and \u03b8 \u2208 \u00bd0; \u00f0\u03c0=2\u00de\u00de, \u03d5 \u2208 \u00bd0; 2\u03c0\u00de. The asymptotic boundary of EAdS2 is at \u03b8 \u00bc \u03c0=2, corresponding to an infinite geodesic distance from the origin \u03b8 \u00bc 0.

The second equality in Eq. (4) holds for a purely \u03b8-dependent field configuration \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8\u00de with no angular dependence. Equation (4) admits analytic solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions Eq. (S.2) in the Supplemental Material [29], parametrized by two integration constants, which can be related by the regularity boundary condition \u03a60\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0. Asymptotically near the boundary at \u03b8 \u00bc \u03c0=2, the two fundamental solutions behave as\n\u03a6\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u2243 A\u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de1\u2212\u0394 \u00fe B\u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de\u0394; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u0394 \u00bc 1 2 \u00fe ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 4 \u00fem2l2 q is the scaling dimension of the boundary operator O holographically dual to \u03a6. In AdS=CFT, the terms in Eq. (5) are denoted as nonnormalizable and normalizable modes, respectively. Imposing suitable boundary conditions at \u03b8 \u00bc \u00f0\u03c0=2\u00de [37], the coefficient B of the normalizable mode is identified with the vacuum expectation value of the dual operator O, while the coefficient A of the non-normalizable mode determines its source J. In spatial dimension d \u00bc 1 and for masses of the scalar field\nm2l2 < \u2212 1\n4 ; \u00f06\u00de\nthe scaling dimension \u0394 of the dual operator becomes complex. In the CFT, this indicates a breakdown of unitarity. In the AdS bulk, it implies that the energy of the scalar field,\nE \u00bc Z d\u03b8 cos\u00f0\u03b8\u00de2\u0394\u00f0\u00f0\u2202\u03b8\u03a6\u0303\u00de2 \u00fe \u03942\u03a6\u03032\u00de; \u00f07\u00de\nceases to be a real and positive quantity [29]. Here, we have used the ansatz \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc \u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de\u0394\u03a6\u0303\u00f0\u03b8\u00de [22,23,38]. After quantization, this denotes an instability of the system toward a new, true ground state [39]. The reality condition on \u0394 implies m2l2 \u2265 \u2212 1\n4 . This is the Breitenlohner-\nFreedman stability bound [22,23] and is a key element of AdS=CFT. We now analyze the implications of a finite cutoff for the analytical solutions. Regularity at the origin is imposed through von Neumann boundary conditions at \u03b8 \u00bc 0. Introducing a finite radial cutoff \u03b5 \u226a 1, such that Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at \u03b8c \u00bc \u03c0=2 \u2212 \u03b5 via \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8c\u00de \u00bc 1, leads to a rescaling of the solutions. We\n091604-2\nsolve Eq. (4) subject to these boundary conditions and find that, above the BF bound, solutions have no zeros in the regime \u03b8 \u2208 \u00bd0; \u00f0\u03c0=2\u00de\u00de. Below the BF bound, however, solutions develop an infinite set of zeros [29]. At specific values of the mass squaredm2l2 and cutoff \u03b5, we observe a singular behavior of the solutions, characterized by discontinuous jumps of the field amplitude, as presented in Fig. 2. These only appear below the BF bound and are a result of the cutoff coinciding with a zero of the solution associated to the given value ofm2l2, thus making the rescaling factor diverge. We denote these pairs \u00f0m2l2; \u03b5\u00de as Umklapp points. The position of the first Umklapp point below m2l2 \u00bc \u2212 1\n4 , corresponding to the\nzero which is furthest into the bulk, can be used as an indicator for the unstable regime. More precisely, when the cutoff is removed, the value of the mass squared for which this zero first appears corresponds to the BF stability bound. The analytical derivation of the solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation (4) at a finite cutoff \u03b5 provided in Ref. [29] allows for an exact tracking of this first Umklapp point for different cutoffs. This provides a reference behavior, shown in black in Fig. 3, to which we compare our numerical findings. Regular hyperbolic tilings of D2.\u2014EAdS2 is isomorphic to the Poincare\u0301 disk model of hyperbolic space D2, which can be naturally discretized by regular hyperbolic tilings [6,7]. These preserve a large subgroup, known as a Fuchsian group of the first kind, of the isometry group PSL\u00f02;R\u00de of EAdS2 [40,41], making them promising candidates for setting up a discrete holographic duality. Hyperbolic tilings are characterized by their Schl\u00e4fli symbol fp; qg, with \u00f0p \u2212 2\u00de\u00f0q \u2212 2\u00de > 4, denoting a tiling with q regular p-gons meeting at each vertex. The f7; 3g hyperbolic tiling and its dual f3; 7g tiling are shown in Fig. 1 as an example. Since hyperbolic space introduces a length scale through its radius of curvature l, the edge\nlengths of hyperbolic polygons are fixed quantities, depending only on the Schl\u00e4fli parameters p and q [42]. Their geodesic length \u03b8\u00f0p;q\u00de in units of l can be computed via the Poincare\u0301 metric [Eq. (1)] and can be interpreted as a fixed lattice spacing that cannot be tuned. We compute \u03b8\u00f0p;q\u00de for several p and q in Ref. [29]. In general, this makes a continuum limit of fp; qg tilings in the usual way impossible. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that regular hyperbolic tilings indeed preserve some properties of the continuum scalar field theory, indicating that they are a good approximation of continuum EAdS2. While the entire EAdS2 space can be filled with an infinite fp; qg tiling, numerical simulations and experimental setups can only be finite sized. The truncation of the tiling to a finite number of layers is equivalent to the introduction of a finite cutoff as mentioned earlier. Given the jagged structure of the tiling\u2019s boundary at any finite layer, an effective uniform radial cutoff needs to be drawn. This allows for a direct comparison of the Umklapp points observed in numerical simulations on the truncated tilings with the analytical solutions derived in Ref. [29]. Numerical methods.\u2014The central ingredient for our numerical analysis of the Klein-Gordon equation on fp; qg hyperbolic tilings is a suitable discretization, denoted by \u25a1\u0303, of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Its action on a scalar function \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8;\u03d5\u00de, represented on the tiling by discrete values \u03a6j \u00bc \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8j\u00de, can be written as\n\u00f0\u25a1\u0303\u03a6\u00dej \u00bc X kjj wjkl\u22122\u00f0\u03a6k \u2212\u03a6j\u00de; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere kjj denotes the summation over the q neighboring sites k of site j. In order to determine the weight factors wjk,\nand converge toward the continuum BF bound (dotted line). FIG. 3. First Umklapp point for various hyperbolic tilings and\nradial cutoffs \u03b8c.

Inset: corresponding results from our hyperbolic electric circuit simulations.\n091604-3\nwe implement the following method devised from the established approximation of lattice operators by finite difference quotients. Given that all cells in a hyperbolic tiling are isometric, it is clear that all weights in the stencil have to be equal, i.e., wj;k \u2261 w (cf. right panel of Fig. 1), which allows us to write the lattice operator formally as a matrix\n\u25a1\u0303 \u2212m2 \u2261 wl\u22122\u00f0A \u2212G\u00de \u00feM; \u00f09\u00de acting on a vector of function values \u03a6 \u00bc \u00f0\u03a60;\u03a61;\u2026\u00de. Here, A and G denote the adjacency and degree matrix of the tiling graph and M \u00bc diag\u00f0\u2212m2\u00de. In order to calculate the weight w, recall the approximation of a 1D second derivative by finite differences \u2202\u03032x\u03c7\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc w\u00bd\u03c7\u00f0x \u2212 h\u00de \u2212 2\u03c7\u00f0x\u00de\u00fe \u03c7\u00f0x\u00fe h\u00de . First, we determine a test function \u03c7\u00f0x\u00de such that \u2202 2 x\u03c7\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1, in this case \u03c7\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 12 x2. Applying the discretized derivative to this function yields \u2202\u03032x\u03c7\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc h2w; hence w \u00bc h\u22122. Note that unlike this case of a Cartesian hypercubic lattice, the hyperbolic lattice spacing h is fixed, as discussed above. We now apply this procedure to the stencil on the hyperbolic lattice. First, we determine a radially symmetric test function \u03c7\u00f0\u03b8\u00de such that\n\u25a1\u03c7\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc 1 l2 \u00f0cos2\u03b8 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03b8 \u00fe cos2\u03b8\u22022\u03b8\u00de\u03c7\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc 1: \u00f010\u00de\nA possible solution is\n\u03c7\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc l2 ln 1\u00fe 1\ncos \u03b8\n: \u00f011\u00de\nApplying \u25a1\u0303 to this function on the central site of the tiling (cf. right panel of Fig. 1) yields\n\u25a1\u0303\u03c7\u00f00\u00de \u00bc pw\u00f0\u03c7\u00f0\u03b8\u00f0p;q\u00de\u00de \u2212 \u03c7\u00f00\u00de\u00de \u00bc 1: \u00f012\u00de\nSolving for w, the weight factors can be obtained for every fp; qg and are listed in Ref. [29]. Numerical results.\u2014Given the lattice Laplacian, the continuum Klein-Gordon equation on a constant time slice can be expressed on the finite hyperbolic tiling as\n\u25a1\u0303\u03a6 \u2212m2\u03a6 \u00bc 0 for \u03b8 < \u03b8c; \u03a6\u00f0\u03b8\u00de \u00bc \u03a6c for \u03b8 \u00bc \u03b8c \u00f013\u00de\nwhere the boundary condition is implemented by assigning constant values to sites outside the radial cutoff \u03b8c. Solving the discretized boundary value problem [Eq. (13)] requires iterative matrix methods [43,44] already for medium system sizes. It has to be taken into account that for negative m2 exceeding a certain threshold, most standard solvers tend to be unstable due to the lattice\noperator \u25a1\u0303 \u2212m2 becoming indefinite in this parameter regime [45]. A class of algorithms which can handle indefinite, sparse linear systems are so-called Krylow subspace methods [46]. In particular, we use both the GMRES (generalized minimum residual) [47] and BiCGSTAB (biconjugate gradient stabilized) gradient stabilized [48] methods to solve Eq. (13) and extract the positions of the Umklapp points. The results from both algorithms are fully compatible and presented in Fig. 3 for various hyperbolic tilings [49] and values of the cutoff. We find that all curves nicely converge toward m2l2 \u00bc \u22121=4 for \u03b5 \u2192 0, thus yielding the correct infinite volume limit and marking the main result of this Letter. We expect that the universal behavior for all p and q\ndisplayed in Fig. 3 originates from a group-theoretic argument as follows. For Fuchsian groups of the first kind, which describe the isometries of fp; qg tilings, it is known that the boundary limit set is the circle S1 [21,40]. For infinite tilings, this implies conformal invariance of the boundary theory. The BF bound is the mass-squared threshold at which the scaling dimension \u0394 of the CFT operator dual to the bulk scalar field becomes complex, as can be seen from the definition of \u0394 below [Eq. (5)]. Thus, the asymptotic value of the first Umklapp point must be the same for all p and q as \u03b5 \u2192 0. In addition, our numerical results of Fig. 3 indicate that even for finite cutoff, where the Fuchsian symmetry is broken, the universality of the \u03b5 \u2192 0 behavior is preserved for all p and q. Hyperbolic electric circuits.\u2014We further propose an\nexperimental realization of the BF bound in a suitable electric circuit. We are motivated by topolectric circuits [16], which are a platform based on circuits of capacitors and inductors which are engineered to realize a plethora of models exhibiting topological states of matter [26,27,50]. Specifically, let us consider a circuit on a hyperbolic tiling as shown in Fig. 4. On the vertices of the tiling we attach grounded capacitors C and connect them via identical inductors L along the polygon edges. Note that our\n091604-4\nconstruction differs from that in Ref. [17] in that we exchange capacitors and inductors. This is necessary because only then the site voltage Uj represents the scalar field \u03d5j. In this network, the voltageUj at site j is related to the capacitor current by Ij \u00bc C _Uj while the voltage differences between neighboring sites k of j are related to the induced current by \u00f0Uk \u2212Uj\u00de \u00bc L_Ijk. According to Kirchhoff\u2019s laws, the time evolution of the voltage at site j is given by\nU\u0308j \u00bc 1\nLC X kjj \u00f0Uk \u2212 Uj\u00de: \u00f014\u00de\nThe oscillatory eigenmodes Uj\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ujei\u03c9t are determined by the system of equations\n\u2212\u03c92Uj \u00bc 1\nLC X kjj \u00f0Uk \u2212Uj\u00de \u00bc w\u00f0p;q\u00de LC \u25a1\u0303Uj; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere in our case, the weights are constant wjk \u00bc w\u00f0p;q\u00de as discussed above. By identifying\n\u2212m2l2 \u00bc \u03c92 LC w\u00f0p;q\u00de ; \u00f016\u00de\nthe electric circuit provides a realization of the discretized Klein-Gordon equation for m2l2 < 0 [51]. The first Umklapp point corresponds to the lowest eigenfrequency of the circuit, which represents the finite gap in the negative-definite eigenspectrum of the hyperbolic Laplacian [15]. Since the circuits described above contain only passive elements, they can only realize the regime of negative mass squared. This is however precisely the regime where according to Eq. (7), solutions to Eq. (4) are unstable within the AdS=CFT correspondence. For electric circuits to access the regime of m2 above the BF bound, thus realizing non-normalizable solutions [Eq. (5)] essential for holography, the implementation of active electrical elements is required. Such elements were introduced in Ref. [52] in the context of topolectric circuits. We propose to use negative impedance converters to achieve negative values of L or C on the rhs of Eq. (16). In order to systematically locate the eigenmodes of the passive circuit, we apply a driving alternating current at the central node and integrate the system of Eq. (15) over time using an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Details of our numerical analysis are presented in Ref. [29]. Once the fundamental mode of the system is found, the corresponding negative mass squared can be extracted according to Eq. (16). These resonances (eigenfrequencies of the circuit) are a physical manifestation of the Umklapp points introduced above. Performing this analysis for several different hyperbolic tilings [49] and finite cutoff radii, we are able to locate the positions of the lowest eigenfrequency. Similarly to our analysis of the Umklapp points, we are able to find the instability threshold on the tiling by\ntracking the position of the first resonance frequency of the circuit as the cutoff is removed. Again, we find an excellent agreement with the continuum prediction, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. Our analysis thus shows how the BF bound can be experimentally realized on hyperbolic electric circuits. Conclusions.\u2014For the first time, we have identified the implications of the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for discrete regular tilings of hyperbolic space. Notably, we find universal behavior of the instabilities for all fp; qg discretizations, even for finite cutoff. In particular, we find excellent agreement between the positions of the Umklapp points as obtained via numerical simulations of the scalar field on several different fp; qg tilings with the analytical solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation on EAdS2. Moreover, for a specific hyperbolic electric circuit we show how the resonance frequencies are a manifestation of the Umklapp points. Simulations of the circuit dynamics also show excellent agreement with the analytical data by yielding the same dependence of the resonances on the cutoff size. Both these results confirm the universal behavior. Furthermore, we suggest how to adapt the electrical circuits in order to realize mass-squared values above the BF bound. Such circuit realizations will make regular hyperbolic tilings excellent candidates for bringing aspects of AdS=CFT to the laboratory. The EAdS2 manifold considered here describes a constant time slice of the larger AdS2\u00fe1 spacetime. It would be interesting to generalize our analysis to a Lorentzian setting involving time, for instance by adding a temporal leg to the vertices of the tilings and equipping them with radiusdependent weights (see also Ref. [11] for a first attempt in this direction). In practice, this can be implemented by locally modifying L and C on the hyperbolic electric circuit. We leave this for future work.\nWe are grateful to R. Thomale, R. N. Das, and G. Di Giulio for fruitful discussions. Moreover, we thank F.
