Traditionally, the stability of a particular solution of dynamical systems is analyzed, most often the origin, for example if we study the global error dynamics in the state trajectory tracking problem [9], [12]. Stability analysis in the global sense could also have its benefits in the study of the convergence to zero of all solution in the cases, when the origin is not a solution of perturbed system, for example, in the situation when\nEmail address: robert.vrabel@stuba.sk (Robert Vrabel)\nPreprint submitted to the scientific journal June 28, 2022\nthe origin is a stable equilibrium of nominal (unperturbed) system and we are interested in the effect of an external disturbance on the behavior of the systems as a part of the robustness analysis. Some new results in this field are direct consequences of the second part of Theorem 1 and demonstrated in Example 1."

In other words, we focus here on the systems whose trajectories converge to one another and, in general, without being attracted toward some equilibrium position. The underlying idea is obvious: If we have proved the asymptotic stability of all solutions at once, we do not have to deal with the stability properties of a particular solution, especially if finding it itself is a difficult task [13].\nTwo similar, but not entirely equivalent [14] stability notions were settled - one is the long established notion of convergent systems [5], [13], the other is the younger notion of incremental stability [2].\nDefinition 1 (cf. [14]). System (1) is incrementally asymptotically stable in a positively invariant set X \u2282 Rn if there exists a function \u03b2 \u2208 KL [10] such that for any two solution x(t) and x\u2217(t) with x(t0), x\n\u2217(t0) \u2208 X and t \u2265 t0,\n|x(t)\u2212 x\u2217(t)| \u2264 \u03b2 ( |x(t0)\u2212 x\u2217(t0)|, t\u2212 t0 ) .\nIn the case X = Rn we say that system (1) is globally incrementally stable (GIS).\nThe aim of this paper is to provide an alternative approach for assessment of GIS based on the logarithmic norm and the variation of constant formula applied to auxiliary linear time-varying systems. We obtain more general results as those achieved by using (quadratic) Lyapunov-like function which until now has been practically the only applicable method, see, e. g. [13],\n[14] and the references therein. Moreover, the proposed approach turns out to be a bit simpler than through finding some implicit motion integral as in Lyapunov theory.\nAs a completely new result seems to be the establishing of conditions for the convergence of all solutions of the system (1) to 0 as t \u2192 \u221e if even x = 0 is not the equilibrium position of the nominal system x\u0307 = f(x, t), in Theorem 1; the context and novelty are explained in Remarks 1 and 2. From another point of view, if f(0, t) = 0 for all t \u2265 t0, Theorem 1 gives a sufficient conditions for robustness of global asymptotic stability to external perturbation \u03b4(t) of the equilibrium point x = 0, and we came to the surprising conclusion that the origin may remain \u201cattractive\u201d even for unbounded (and possibly unknown) perturbations \u03b4(t), as is demonstrated in Example 1. This example shows at the same time that the conditions imposed on the system in Theorem 1 cannot be weakened too much.\nThus the results achieved in this paper contradict the opinion formulated in the classic monograph on dynamical systems [10, Chapter 9, p. 346], where it is written:\n\u201cThe origin x = 0 may not be an equilibrium point of the perturbed system. We can no longer study stability of the origin as an equilibrium point, nor should we expect the solution of the perturbed system to approach the origin as t \u2192 \u221e. The best we can hope for is that x(t) will be ultimately bounded by a small bound, if the perturbation term is small in some sense.\u201d"

First we prove that the inequality (4) holds. Let us denote by z the difference z(t) = x(t)\u2212 x\u2217(t), t \u2265 t0.

A great Russian mathematician and one of the pioneers in the area of stability of dynamical systems, B.P. Demidovich showed, see e. g. [13] or the original source in Russian [5], that if, for some positive definite matrix P = P T > 0, the matrix\nJ(x, t) = 1\n2\n[\nPJxF (x, t) + J T x F (x, t)P\n]\n(7)\nis negative definite uniformly in (x, t) \u2208 Rn \u00d7 R then for any two solutions x(t) and x\u2217(t) of the dynamical system x\u0307 = F (x, t) is\n|x(t)\u2212 x\u2217(t)|I \u2264 Ke\u2212\u03b1(t\u2212t0)|x(t0)\u2212 x\u2217(t0)|I for all t \u2265 t0 and some independent on x and x\u2217 constants K,\u03b1 > 0. However, this condition is not very-well suited for reasoning about the convergence of all solutions to 0 as t \u2192 \u221e if\n(F (0, t) =) f(0, t) + \u03b4(t) 6= 0\nbecause we cannot set x\u2217(t) \u2261 0. In the context of logarithmic norm, Demidovich condition (7) is equivalent to the existence of positive definite symmetric matrix P such that \u00b5P [JxF (x, t)] \u2264 \u2212\u03b1 < 0.\nIn fact, as follows from [4] and [8],\n\u00b5P [A] = max x 6=0 (Ax, x)P |x|2P = max x 6=0\nxT (PA+ ATP )x\n2|x|2P , A = JxF (x, t).\nBut, taking into account that not every norm comes from an inner product, our result strengthens the Demidovich results.\nRemark 2. The condition in Assumption A1 might be relaxed to\n\u2200(x, t) \u2208 Rn \u00d7 [t0,\u221e) : \u00b5[Jxf(x, t)] \u2264 \u2212\u03b1(t), \u221e \u222b\nt0\n\u03b1(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = \u221e\nto obtain only asymptotic stability of solutions (not uniform and not exponential, in general),\n|x(t)\u2212 x\u2217(t)| \u2264 e \u2212\nt\u222b\nt0\n\u03b1(\u03c4)d\u03c4\n|x(t0)\u2212 x\u2217(t0)|, t \u2265 t0.\nRecall that proof by L\u2019Hospital rule requires \u03b1(t) > 0 in some left neighborhood of t = \u221e.\nNotice also that, albeit under these circumstances the system may not satisfy the conditions for GIS from Definition 1, still all solutions converge to one another as t \u2192 \u221e. Thus we have extended the results presented in [11] to more general type of convergence and also to potentially unbounded perturbation \u03b4(t) of the nominal system x\u0307 = f(x, t)."

            "text": "Example 1. As an academic example, let us consider the planar nonlinear system x\u0307 = f(x, t) + \u03b4(t), t \u2265 t0 with\nf(x, t) = ( \u03c6(t)x1 + sin (x1) , bx1 + [2 + \u03c6(t)]x2 + sin (x2) )T , (8)\nwhere \u03c6(t) is an arbitrary scalar continuous function on [t0,\u221e) and b is a real constant. By (3) and with the help of MATLAB code, we have\n\u00b5I [ Jxf(x, t) ] = \u03c6(t) + 1\n2\n[ cos (x1) + cos (x2) + \u221a \u03d1 ] + 1,\nwhere\n\u03d1 = b2 + [cos (x1)\u2212 cos (x2)]2 \u2212 4 cos (x1) + 4 cos (x2) + 4\n= b2 + [cos (x1)\u2212 cos (x2)\u2212 2]2 \u2265 0.\nFor example, if we choose b = 5 and \u03c6(t) = \u22126 \u2212 t3, the Assumptions A1 and A2 of Theorem 1 hold for \u03b1(t) = 0.5 + t3, t \u2265 0(= t0) and so the vanishing of all solutions as t \u2192 \u221e is ensured for perturbations satisfying |\u03b4(t)|I = o(t3) in Landau\u2019s little-o notation. It means, that the system is GIS in the sense of Definition 1 and, in addition, all solutions converge to 0 as long as the perturbing term \u03b4(t) (its | \u00b7 |I\u2212norm, to be more precise) is of the order less than t3 as t \u2192 \u221e, demonstrating the global robust stability of the equilibrium point x = 0 of the nominal system (\u03b4 = 0) even for unbounded perturbations \u03b4. The results of simulation experiments are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, where for the simulation purpose we selected one representative from the class of admissible perturbations (Fig. 1) and the borderline case for the second simulation experiment. The dynamics of the system on Fig. 2 indicates that Assumption A2, ensuring the convergence to zero of all solutions as t \u2192 \u221e, cannot be weakened too much.\nThe limiting value (0, 4)T can be in this particular example calculated explicitly thinking as follows: Separately analyzing the first equation by using Theorem 1 for \u03b4 = (\u03b41, \u03b42)\nT = (5 sin2 (t) , 4t3)T and \u03c6(t) = \u22126\u2212t3, we obtain that x1(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. In the second equation, transforming the second component of state vector by x2 = x\u03032 +4 and identifying (bx1(t)\u2212 16) as an inhomogeneous term \u03b4\u03032(t), we get the scalar differential equation\n\u02d9\u0303x2 = f\u03032(x\u03032, t) + \u03b4\u03032(t),\nwhere\nf\u03032(x\u03032, t) , f2(x1, x\u03032 + 4, t)\u2212 bx1 + \u03b42(t) = \u2212(4 + t3)x\u03032 + sin(x\u03032 + 4).\nThen Theorem 1 implies that x\u03032(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e because\n|f\u03032(0, t) + \u03b4\u03032(t)| \u03b1\u0303(t) = | sin(4) + bx1(t)\u2212 16| 3 + t3 \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e,\nwhich is what we have to prove.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, the new result for assessment of the global incremental stability of the nonlinear systems x\u0307 = f(x, t) + \u03b4(t) is derived. Roughly speaking, we have established here the sufficient condition for convergence of any two solutions of a system to each other and another condition for convergence of all solutions to the origin x = 0, which may or may not be the equilibrium position for the nominal system x\u0307 = f(x, t).\nThe fundamental advantage of the used approach based on the logarithmic norm is the fact that to estimate the norm of transition matrix for auxiliary linear time-varying system associated to the original nonlinear one, we do not need to know the fundamental matrix solution and all necessary estimates are based purely on the linear system\u2019s matrix entries.\nAppendix.\nFor completeness, we provide the proof of Lemma 1.\nProof of Lemma 1. We prove Part I only, in the proof of second statement we proceed analogously. Let fi, i = 1, . . . , n denote the components of f(x, t) and define: gi : [0, 1] \u2192 R by gi(\u03be) = fi(\u03bex, t). Then we have\nfi(x, t)\u2212 fi(0, t) = gi(1)\u2212 gi(0) = 1 \u222b\n0\ng\u2032i(\u03be)d\u03be\n=\n1 \u222b\n0\n( n \u2211\nj=1\n\u2202fi \u2202xj (\u03bex, t)xj\n)\nd\u03be =\nn \u2211\nj=1\n( 1 \u222b\n0\n\u2202fi \u2202xj (\u03bex, t)d\u03be\n)\nxj , i = 1, . . . , n.\nNow the statement of lemma follows immediately."
