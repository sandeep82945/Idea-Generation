Comparative Analysis of Different Plant-Based Proteins on Oil Stability: Extending the research to other plant-based proteins, such as pea, hemp, and rice proteins, to compare their effectiveness in improving oil oxidative stability during frying cycles. This could provide a broader understanding of the potential of plant-based proteins in enhancing the nutritional and safety profiles of fried foods.

Mechanism of Action at Molecular Level: Delving deeper into the molecular mechanisms behind the antioxidant activities of different hydrolysates. This could involve investigating the interaction between specific peptide sequences and oxidative compounds within the oil, using computational modeling and in vitro experiments to elucidate the pathways for their antioxidant actions.

Impact of Hydrolysate Concentration and Frying Duration: Exploring the effect of varying concentrations of the most effective hydrolysates (e.g., from pepsin digestion) over extended frying cycles beyond 12, to determine the optimal concentration for maximum oxidative stability without affecting the sensory qualities of the oil and the fried product.

Application in Industrial Frying Processes: Conducting pilot-scale studies in industrial settings to assess the feasibility and economic viability of incorporating hydrolysates into commercial frying oils. This research could include the development of guidelines for the use of hydrolysates in different types of frying operations and their impact on the quality and shelf-life of fried foods.

Development of Natural Antioxidant Blends: Formulating blends of hydrolysates with other natural antioxidants (e.g., extracts from spices, herbs, or other food by-products rich in phenolic compounds) to synergistically enhance the oxidative stability of frying oils. This research could also investigate the sensory impact of these blends on fried products and consumer acceptance.
