Long-term Impact Assessment of IRWH and Intercropping Systems: Conduct a multi-year study to assess the long-term sustainability and impacts of in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) and intercropping systems on crop yield, soil health, and water efficiency in semi-arid regions. This would include examining the cumulative effects on soil organic matter, biodiversity, and the long-term viability of these practices for smallholder farmers.

Comparison of Different Water Harvesting Techniques: Investigate and compare the effectiveness of various water harvesting techniques, including IRWH, alongside other traditional and innovative methods. This could involve comparing their efficiency in water conservation, impact on crop yield, and suitability under different environmental conditions and soil types.

Crop Diversification within IRWH and Intercropping Systems: Explore the potential for diversifying crops within IRWH and intercropping systems beyond maize and beans. This research would assess the compatibility, yield advantage, and water use efficiency of different crop combinations, focusing on enhancing nutrition, food security, and resilience to climate variability.

Socio-economic Impacts of Adopting IRWH and Intercropping Systems: Study the socio-economic impacts of adopting IRWH and intercropping systems on smallholder farmers, including changes in labor requirements, income levels, food security status, and access to markets. This research would provide insights into the barriers and incentives for adoption and the overall viability of these practices for improving livelihoods in rural communities.

Technological and Methodological Innovations in IRWH: Develop and test innovative technological solutions and methodological approaches to enhance the efficiency and ease of implementing IRWH systems. This could include the development of low-cost, easy-to-install rainwater harvesting infrastructure, advanced soil moisture monitoring tools, and decision support systems to optimize water use and crop management practices.
