1. **Investigate the relationship between efficiency scores and other environmental determinants beyond age and education.** This could include factors such as income, behavioral risks, and political stability.


2. **Compare the results of efficiency analyses using different standard populations for input and output adjustment.** This would help to determine the sensitivity of the results to the choice of standard population.


3. **Develop and test new methods for adjusting health expenditure for age structure.** This could include methods that take into account the health status and longevity of the population.


4. **Conduct a longitudinal study to examine the impact of changes in age structure on health system efficiency over time.** This would help to determine the long-term effects of population aging on health system performance.


5. **Use the proposed age-adjusted health expenditure model to compare the efficiency of health systems in different countries.** This would help to identify countries that are performing well and those that are struggling, and could inform policy decisions aimed at improving health system efficiency.
