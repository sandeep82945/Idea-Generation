Here, we endeavored to examine patterns in the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of species with C4 photosynthetic pathways across the broad spatial extent of China and relate those to climatic gradients. We built a database of all plants with the C4 photosynthetic pathway in China. We analyzed the geographic distributions, taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic structure of all C4 species, as well as the three families with the most C4 species (Poaceae, Amaranthaceae and Cyperaceae), and compared their values along temperature and precipitation gradients at two scales\u2014the level of the province and at the 100 x 100 km grid cell. We found 644 C4 plants (belonging to 23 families 165 genera) in China, with Poaceae (57%), Amaranthaceae (17%), Cyperaceae (13%) accounting for the majority of species. Standardized effect size values of phylogenetic distances were negative overall, indicating that C4 species showed a phylogenetic clustering pattern. Southern China had the highest species richness and the highest degree of phylogenetic clustering. C4 tended to bemore phylogenetically over-dispersed in regions with colder and/or drier climates, but more clustered in warmer and/or wetter climates. Patterns within individual families were more nuanced. The distribution of C4 species and its phylogenetic structure across China was constrained by temperature and precipitation. C4 species showed a phylogenetic clustering pattern across China, while different families showed more nuanced responses to climate variation, suggesting a role for evolutionary history.\nKEYWORDS\nclustering, niche conservatism, phylogenetic distance, phylogenetic diversity, Poaceae, standardized effect size\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Although they represent a small percentage of vascular plant species on the earth (~0.005%) (Sieben et al., 2010), C4 plants have highly efficient photosynthesis and can play an important role in many ecosystems, such as during succession and recovery of degraded ecosystems (Wang, 2002a; Wang, 2002b). Moreover, the occurrences of C4 plants are good indicators of ecosystem variation because they tend to be more tolerant of stressful environments than C3 plants (Wang and Ma, 2016; Pardo and VanBuren, 2021; Zhang and Xie, 2021). Plants with C4 photosynthesis not only differ biochemically from species with other photosynthetic systems, but also in their evolutionary history and ecological interactions (Osborne et al., 2015; Sage, 2017). Therefore, exploring the patterns in the distribution of C4 plants and their phylogenetic relationships across large spatial scales provides basic biogeographic understanding of this important plant trait both ecologically and evolutionarily.\nThe geographic distribution of C4 plants also tends to be associated with different environmental conditions (Munson and Long, 2017). For example, C4 plants tend to be more prevalent and diverse in warmer tropical areas and are notably absent from cooler regions (Osborne et al., 2015). However, to date, most studies on the distribution and diversity of C4 plants have tended to focus only on relatively small geographic areas (Taylor et al., 2010), or have examined it only within a subset of the angiosperm phylogeny (e.g., in grasses) (Edwards and Still, 2008; Visser et al., 2012; Sonawane et al., 2021), while an exploration of patterns of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic structure could provide insights into the interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes influencing the distribution and diversity of these species (Liu et al., 2012; Munroe et al., 2022).\nBy examining patterns of species richness of C4 plants, together with patterns of phylogenetic diversity (which incorporates evolutionary relationships) and patterns of phylogenetic structure (i.e., clustering of co-occurring species within the phylogeny), we can make progress in understanding the patterns, and potential processes influencing those patterns. For example, because C4 plants tend to have evolved in warmer, more tropical regions (Osborne et al., 2015), the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis (i.e., freezing-tolerance hypothesis) (Latham and Ricklefs, 1993; Wiens and Donoghue, 2004) may help to describe patterns of species richness if there is a strong latitudinal gradient in C4 species. Likewise, the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages, such as how clustered co-occurring species are within the phylogeny, can reflect their evolutionary history of adaptation and tolerance to environments (Qian et al., 2019). For example, the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis predicts that closely related species have more similar niches and thus should share similar environmental conditions and geographic distributions (Pyron et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2022).\nHere, we endeavored to more deeply understand the diversity, structure and distribution of species of species with C4 photosynthesis across broad geographic areas and among the entire angiosperm phylogeny, as well as within specific groups\nFrontiers in Plant Science 02\nwithin angiosperms that had large numbers of C4 species. To do so, we took advantage of an extensive database of C4 species and their distributions from across China. China provides an important venue in which to examine patterns of diversity and structure within C4 species, because it is a geographically and climatically diverse country, ranging from cold temperate to tropical ecosystems, and from extremely wet rainforests to deserts, with a well-characterized flora. Using these data, we could examine patterns of the taxonomic (species) richness of C4 taxa and its relation to climatic variables. In addition, by combining species distribution and composition data with information on species phylogenies, we could examine patterns of phylogenetic diversity of species, as well as the phylogenetic structure (e.g., clustering) of co-occurring species within the phylogeny. Overall, we found that the distribution of C4 species richness, phylogenetic diversity phylogenetic structure across China was constrained by temperature and precipitation; C4 species showed a phylogenetic clustering pattern across China, while different families showed more nuanced responses to climate variation, suggesting a role for evolutionary history."

            "text": "We compiled a database of C4 plants in China from a number of published references (Supporting Information, Table S1). Specifically, we classified C4 species as such when their photosynthetic pathway was identified by stable carbon isotope ratios (10\u2030-15\u2030, Sage and Monson, 1999) and/or anatomy (Kranz anatomy, Osborne et al., 2015). When a species photosynthetic pathway was not known from stable carbon isotopes or anatomical type, we classified these unknown species as C4 species if we could find such information in other databases, and by assuming that all species within a genus should share the same photosynthetic pathway (Osborne et al., 2015) (though we recognize that this is a coarse approach and might misclassify some species). We standardized species names from published references according to the Flora of China (http://foc.iplant.cn/) and the World Flora Online (www.world.flora.online.org). We classified species into family based on the latest Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification (The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2016).\nWe obtained species distribution data within regions from the Flora of China (Table S1). Furthermore, we obtained occurrence records with coordinates (latitude and longitude) from multiple sources, including the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (https:// www.cvh.ac.cn/), National Specimen Information Infrastructure (http://www.nsii.org.cn/2017/home.php) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (https://www.gbif.org/). We then integrated these species distribution data so that we could estimate patterns of diversity and co-occurrence of species at two scales\u2014the province level and at the level of 100 km x 100 km grid cells. For the province level, we divided China into 29 provinces, by combing Beijing and Tianjin within the Hebei Province, Hong Kong and\nfrontiersin.org\nMacau within the Guangdong province, and Shanghai within the Jiangsu Province.\nIn order to compare patterns of C4 diversity and phylogenetic structure with climate variables, we extracted climate data from the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.com/version2). Specifically, we extracted annual mean temperature (hereafter temperature) and annual mean precipitation (hereafter precipitation), which are known to be the most important bioclimatic variables driving plant species distributions in China (Qian et al., 2022). We used ArcGIS 10.8 to extract the variables from each province and grid cell."

            "text": "For each index of diversity or structure, we calculated the value for the entire group of C4 species, as well as separately for C4 species in the three families that accounted for 87% of all C4 species\u2014 Poaceae, Amaranthaceae and Cyperaceae (Figure S1). We calculated species richness as the total number of species that cooccur within a given province or grid cell. In order to calculate patterns of phylogenetic diversity and structure, we first built a phylogenetic tree of all C4 species in our database, using the R package \u2018V.PhyloMaker2\u2019 (Jin and Qian, 2022). With this phylogeny in hand, we calculated three indices of phylogenetic structure. First, we calculated Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity (PD), which calculates the sum of total phylogenetic branch lengths of species in an assemblage (Faith, 1992). Second, we calculated the mean pairwise phylogenetic distances (MPD) between all possible pairs of species in an assemblage, which quantifies overall clustering of taxa on a tree (Webb et al., 2002). Third, we calculated the mean phylogenetic distance to the nearest taxon (MNTD) for each taxon in an assemblage, which quantifies the extent of terminal clustering, independent of deep level clustering (Webb et al., 2002; Qian et al., 2019). For each phylogenetic index, we calculated its standardized effect size (SES) to quantify the degree to which phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic relatedness between species differed from what would have been expected if species were randomly distributed across the geographical extent. The SES was calculated as X = (Xobserved-meanXrandomized)/(sdXrandomized), where Xobserved represents the observed PD, MPD and MNTD values in a species assemblage, while meanXrandomized and sdXrandomized represent the expected mean and standard deviation of the species from the randomized assemblages (Webb et al., 2002). We ran each null randomization 999 times with a fixed species richness. Higher values of the standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity (SES.PD) indicate a higher phylogenetic diversity (Qian et al., 2019). For the standardized effect size of the mean phylogenetic distance (SES.MPD), negative values indicate that the observed MPD values were lower than randomized ones and that species are more closely related than expected from the entire species pool (i.e., species are phylogenetically clustered). Conversely, positive SES.MPD values indicate that species are phylogenetically overdispersed. Likewise, negative values of the standardized effect size of the mean phylogenetic distance to the nearest taxon (SES.MNTD)\nFrontiers in Plant Science 03\nindicate clustering within the terminal part of the phylogenetic tree, while positive values indicate overdispersion. All phylogenetic indices and their SES were calculated using the R package \u2018picante\u2019 (Kembel et al., 2010)."

More specifically, we found that C4 species accounted for about 2% of all angiosperms in China (644 C4 species out of 29716-30260 total angiosperm species, Wang et al., 2015; Qian et al., 2022). Furthermore, the C4 photosynthetic pathway was most prevalent among species in the Poaceae. About half of all Poaceae species are C4 (Osborne et al., 2015), and our study, like others (Sage and Monson, 1999), found that Poaceae with C4 photosynthesis accounted for about half of all C4 species.\nOur main result was that C4 species had higher species richness in regions with warmer and/or wetter climates. This pattern also holds when we examined patterns of the C4 species within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae. This is consistent with ideas related to the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis (Wiens and Donoghue, 2004) and is also mirrored by patterns in the distribution of woody and seed plants in China (Wang et al., 2011; Qian et al., 2019). C4 species in the Amaranthaceae, however, had a higher species richness in northwestern China in regions with drier climates (see also Wang and Ma, 2016; Rudov et al., 2020; Munroe et al., 2022). This suggests that the evolutionary history of C4 species within the Amaranthaceae likely differs from the other families with C4 photosynthesis.\nWhile we found that C4 species in the Cyperaceae were more phylogenetically clustered in regions with colder and/or drier climates, consistent with previous studies in China (Lu et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2019) and North America (Qian and Sandel, 2017), this pattern did not hold for the other groups. Instead, we\nA B\nFIGURE 2 Variation in the standardized effect size values of phylogenetic structure indices at the province level (left column) and grid level (right colum). Values of significant differences from zero are shown by three asterisks (P < 0.001), two asterisks (0.001< P < 0.01), one asterisk (0.01< P < 0.05) and NS (P > 0.05).\nfrontiersin.org\nfound that all C4 species (as well as those within the Poaceae and Amaranthaceae) tended to be more phylogenetically over-dispersed in regions with colder and/or drier climates, but more clustered in warmer and/or wetter climates.\nThese results are also consistent with the phylogenetic niche conservatism hypothesis (Qian et al., 2019), where all C4 species in the warmer and wetter climates of southern China had the highest species richness, but relatively lower phylogenetic diversity and the higher phylogenetic clustering, suggesting that species here were highly closely related. However, patterns differed for the C4 species in the Amaranthaceae, where drier climates of the northwestern parts of China had the highest species richness and phylogenetic diversity, as well as low phylogenetic clustering, suggesting these species were relatively distantly related. On the other hand, C4 species in the Cyperaceae had lower species richness, highest phylogenetic diversity and high phylogenetic overdispersion in the colder climates of the northwest, indicating these species were relatively distantly related. Overall, this suggests that C4 species in different families respond different to geographic gradients, likely as\nFrontiers in Plant Science 06\na result of their different evolutionary histories (Munroe et al., 2022).\nWe should emphasize, however, that while ours is the most comprehensive analysis of the distribution and diversity of C4 species in China, there are still some improvements that can be made. For example, in our database, there are 273 species whose stable carbon isotope value or anatomical type were not given, but rather inferred based on other databases and the assumption that all species within one genus should share the same photosynthetic pathway (Osborne et al., 2015). However, it is possible that taxonomic changes could influence this assumption. For instance, species in the Potamogeton genus were identified with C4 photosynthetic pathway, except for Potamogeton pectinatus (Table S1), which was identified as a synonym of Stuckenia pectinata. Likewise, several genera within the Amaranthaceae family were formerly classified in the Chenopodiaceae (Alternanthera, Atriplex, Axyris, Bassia, Suaeda and Salsola) (Table S1), which could have influenced their classification. This suggests that there remains work to be done on the taxonomy of Amaranthaceae. There are\nfrontiersin.org\nalso some genera in other families, such as Cyperus and Panicum, whose taxonomy is controversial (Table S1) and do not share the same photosynthetic pathway. Indeed, the photosynthetic pathway might be a good tool to explore species evolutionary history and taxonomy.\nIn all, our study, by identifying key patterns in the diversity and phylogenetic structure of C4 species across regions in China, provides an important advance in our understanding of their distributions. This provides basic information on consistent (across all taxa) and nuanced (different patterns within some families) patterns of diversity and phylogenetic clustering patterns in response to major climate gradients. Furthermore, understanding these patterns of distribution can provide an important foundation for the use of C4 species in restoration practices in degraded ecosystems."
