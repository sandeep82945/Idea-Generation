            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nAveraging techniques have been widely used in the construction and the stability analysis of solutions to time varying differential equations [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The rigorous application of the method of averaging begins by writing the system on the form:\nd\u03b6 d\u03c4 = f0(\u03b6, \u03c4) + \u03b5 f1(\u03b6, \u03c4, \u03b5) (1)\npossibly via coordinate changes and time scaling, where the vector field f1 is periodic in \u03c4 and \u03b5 is a small parameter. When f0 = 0, the system is said to be on the averaging canonical form and the averaging theorem can be directly applied [2, Chapter 2]. If f0 6= 0, the Variation of Constants (VOC) formula may be used to force the system on the averaging canonical form [2, Section 1.6],[7, Section 9.1]. However, even when the vector field f0 is linear and time invariant, i.e. f0(\u03b6, \u03c4) = A\u03b6 for some matrix A, the VOC formula is practically useful only when the eigenvalues of the matrix A are purely imaginary. This is due to the fact that the pullback of the vector field f1 under the flow of f0 will contain exponentially growing terms (see the discussion in [2, Section 1.7]).\nIn this manuscript, we analyze a class of singularly perturbed high-frequency, high-amplitude oscillatory systems described by equation (2) which naturally arises in extremum seeking applications [8], [9], and can be put on the form (1). Yet, the VOC formula is not useful in analyzing this class of systems for the reasons outlined in the previous paragraph. Moreover, recent results in the literature such as the singularly perturbed Lie Bracket Approximation framework [10], [11] do not capture the stability properties as we illustrate below.\nThis work was supported by NSF Grant CMMI-1846308 M. Abdelgalil and A. Eldesoukey are with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92617, USA maabdelg@uci.edu, aeldesou@uci.edu\nH. Taha is with the Faculty of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA 92617, USA hetaha@uci.edu\nTo analyze the behavior of this class of systems, we combine the higher order averaging theorem [2] with singular perturbation techniques [12] in a way that accounts for the interaction between the fast periodic time scale and the singularly perturbed part of the system. Furthermore, we propose a novel 3D source seeking algorithm for rigid bodies with a non-collocated sensor. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the chemotactic strategy of sea urchins sperm cells for seeking the egg in 3D [13], [14], and it utilizes the special structure of the matrix group SO(3). We prove the practical stability of the proposed algorithm using the singularly perturbed averaging results we state here."

Remark 1: We restrict our treatment here to the periodic case for simplicity. The extension to the case when the vector fields are quasi-periodic is straightforward but the computations are more involved. Next, consider the reduced order system:\n\u02d9\u0303x = \u221a \u03c9 f\u03031(x\u0303, \u03c9t) + f\u03032(x\u0303, \u03c9t), y\u0303 = \u03d50(x\u0303) (3)\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n16 80\n8v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nO C\n] 3\n1 M\nar 2\n02 2\nwhere the time-varying vector fields f\u0303i are defined by:\nf\u03031(x, \u03c4) = f1(x,\u03d50(x), \u03c4) (4) f\u03032(x, \u03c4) = f2(x,\u03d50(x), \u03c4) + C(x,\u03d50(x), \u03c4)\u03d51(x, \u03c4) (5)\nC(x, y, \u03c4) = \u2202wf1(x,w, \u03c4)|w=y (6) \u03d51(x, \u03c4) = ( Id\u2212 eTA )\u22121 \u222b T 0\ne(T\u2212s)A b1(x, s+ \u03c4)ds (7) b1(x, \u03c4) = g1(x,\u03d50(x), \u03c4)\u2212 \u2202x\u03d50(x) f1(x,\u03d50(x), \u03c4) (8)\nand Id is the identity matrix. In a companion paper [15], see also [16], we showed that the higher order averaging theorem may be applied to the reduced order system (3) to obtain the reduced order averaged system:\n\u02d9\u0304x = f\u0304(x\u0304), y\u0304 = \u03d50(x) (9)\nwhere the vector field f\u0304(\u00b7) is given by:\nf\u0304(x) = 1\nT \u222b T 0 ( f\u03032(x, \u03c41) + 1 2 [ \u222b \u03c41 0 f\u03031(x, \u03c42)d\u03c42,\nf\u03031(x, \u03c41) ]) d\u03c41 (10)\nUnder Assumption 2.1, we have the following theorem concerning the relation between the stability of the system (2) and the reduced order averaged system (9):\nTheorem 2.1: Let Assumption 2.1 be satisfied, and suppose that a compact subset S \u2282 Rn is globally uniformly asymptotically stable for the reduced order averaged system (9). Then, S is singularly semi-globally practically uniformly asymptotically stable for the original system (2).\nRemark 2: We note that our definition of singular semiglobal practical uniform asymptotic stability, which can be found in the appendix A, is slightly different from that in [10]. The proof of Theorem 2.1 proceeds by establishing each part of Definition A.1 similar to [17], [10], relying on Proposition B.1 which we can be found along with a proof sketch in the appendix B. We omit the proof of the theorem from this manuscript to be included in the extended version.\nIII. 3D SOURCE SEEKING\nSource seeking is the problem of locating a target that emits a scalar measurable signal, typically without global positioning information [18], [19]. Interestingly, microorganisms are routinely faced with the source seeking problem. In particular, sea urchin sperm cells seek the egg by swimming up the gradient of the concentration field of a chemical secreted by the egg [14], [13]. The sperm cells do so by swimming in helical paths that dynamically align with the gradient. In this section, we propose a bio-inspired 3D source seeking algorithm for rigid bodies with a non-collocated signal strength sensor that partially mimics the strategy of sperm cells for seeking the egg.\nThe kinematics of a rigid body in 3D space are given by:\np\u0307 = Rv, R\u0307 = R\u2126\u0302 (11)\nwhere p denotes the position of a designated point on the body with respect to a fixed frame of reference, R relates the body frame to the fixed frame, and v and \u2126 are the linear\nand angular velocities in body coordinates, respectively. The map \u2022\u0302 : R3 \u2192 R3\u00d73 takes a vector \u2126 = [\u21261,\u21262,\u21263]\u1d40 \u2208 R3 to the corresponding skew symmetric matrix.\nWe assume a vehicle model in which the linear and angular velocity vectors are given in body coordinates by:\nv = ve1, \u2126 = \u2126\u2016e1 + \u2126\u22a5e3 (12)\nwhere ei for i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} are the standard unit vectors. Remark 3: This model is a natural extension of the unicycle model to the 3D setting. It is well known that this system is controllable using depth one Lie brackets [20].\nLet c : R3 \u2192 R be the signal strength field emitted by the source, and consider the case of a non-collocated signal strength sensor that is mounted at ps, where:\nps = p + rRe2 (13)\nAssumption 3.1: Suppose that the signal strength field c \u2208 C3(R3;R) is radially unbounded, \u2203!p\u2217 \u2208 R3 such that \u2207c(p) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 p = p\u2217, and it satisfies c(p\u2217)\u2212 c(p) \u2264 \u03ba\u2016\u2207c(p)\u20162, \u2200p \u2208 Rn and \u03ba > 0.\nNow, consider the following control law:\nv = \u221a\n4\u03c9 cos(2\u03c9t\u2212 c(ps)) (14) y\u0307 = \u03c9A y + \u03c9 B c(ps) (15) \u2126\u22a5 = \u221a \u03c9C y, \u2126\u2016 = \u03c9 (16)\nwhere y \u2208 R2, and A,B,C are given by: A = [ \u22121 1 0 \u22121 ] , B = [ 0 1 ] , C = [ \u22121 1 ] (17)\nThe static part of this controller, i.e. equation (14) is a 1D extremum seeking control law [21]. Note that other choices of this control law are possible [22]. The dynamic part of this controller, i.e. the equations (15)-(16), is a narrow band-pass filter centered around the frequency \u03c9. The motivation to consider this setup is that in the presence of noise, a narrow band-pass filter centered around the dither frequency \u03c9 optimally extracts the gradient information in the measured output while attenuating noise. In addition, assume that the distance r specifying the offset of the sensor from the center of the frame is such that r = 1/ \u221a \u03c9. This assumption may seem artificial at first glance, though its implication is clear; we require that as the frequency of oscillation \u03c9 tends to \u221e, the distance r from the center of the vehicle is small enough so as not to amplify unwanted nonlinearities in the signal strength field. Alternatively, one may consider this assumption as a \u201cdistinguished limit\u201d [23] for the perturbation calculation in the presence of the two parameters \u03c9 and r. Under these assumptions, we have the following proposition:\nProposition 3.1: Let Assumption 3.1 be satisfied, and let r = 1/ \u221a \u03c9. Then, the compact subset S = {p\u2217} \u00d7 SO(3) is singularly semi-globally practically uniformly asymptotically stable for the system defined by equations (11)-(17).\nProof: Let R0 = exp (\u03c9t e\u03021) , Q = RR\u1d400 , and compute:\nQ\u0307 = R\u0307R\u1d400 + RR\u0307 \u1d40 0 = \u2126\u22a5Re\u03023R \u1d40 0 (18)\n= \u2126\u22a5QR0e\u03023R\u1d400 = \u2126\u22a5QR\u03020e3 (19)\nLet \u039b(y, \u03c9t) = C y R0e3 and observe that:\np\u0307 = Rv = RR\u1d400R0v = vQR0e1 = vQe1 (20)\nQ\u0307 = \u221a \u03c9Q\u039b\u0302(y, \u03c9t) (21)\nTo simplify the presentation, we embed SO(3) into R9 by partitioning the matrix Q = [q1, q2, q3], and defining the state vector q = [q\u1d401 , q \u1d40 2 , q \u1d40 3 ]\n\u1d40. Restrict the initial conditions for q to lie on the compact submanifold M ={\nqi \u2208 R3 : q \u1d40 i qj = \u03b4ij , qi \u00d7 qj = ijkqk } , where \u03b4ij is the Kronecker symbol and ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol. On R3 \u00d7M\u00d7 R2, the system is governed by:\np\u0307 = \u221a\n4\u03c9 cos(2\u03c9t\u2212 c(ps)) q1 (22)\nq\u0307i = \u221a \u03c9 3\u2211 j,k=1 \u039bj(y, \u03c9t) ijkqk (23)\ny\u0307 = \u03c9 (A y + B c(ps)) (24)\nFor more details on this embedding, see the companion paper [15]. The signal strength field can be expanded as a series in 1/ \u221a \u03c9 using Taylor\u2019s theorem:\nc(ps) = c(p) + 1\u221a \u03c9 \u2207c(p)\u1d40(cos(\u03c9t)q2 + sin(\u03c9t)q3)\n+ 1\n2\u03c9 \u22072c(p)[(cos(\u03c9t)q2 + sin(\u03c9t)q3)]\n+ 1\n\u03c9 \u221a \u03c9 \u03c1(p,ps, \u03c9t, 1/\n\u221a \u03c9)\nwhere the remainder \u03c1 is Lipschitz continuous in all of its arguments, and \u22072c(p)[w] = w\u1d40\u22072c(p)w. Now, observe that the system governed by the equations (22)- (24) belongs to the class of systems described by (2). Hence, we may employ Theorem 2.1 in analyzing the stability of the system. In order to proceed, the reduced order averaged system needs to be computed. Due to space constraints, we leave the computations as an exercise for the interested reader in the light of equations (4)-(8), and we provide only the end result of the computation:\n\u02d9\u0304p = q\u03041q\u0304 \u1d40 1\u2207c(p\u0304)\n\u02d9\u0304q2 = \u2212 1\n4 q\u03041q\u0304 \u1d40 3\u2207c(p\u0304),\n\u02d9\u0304q1 = 1\n4 (q\u03042q\u0304 \u1d40 2 + q\u03043q\u0304 \u1d40 3)\u2207c(p\u0304)\n\u02d9\u0304q3 = \u2212 1\n4 q\u03041q\u0304 \u1d40 2\u2207c(p\u0304)\nEquivalently, this system can be written as:\n\u02d9\u0304p = Q\u0304e1e\u1d401Q\u0304 \u1d40\u2207c(p\u0304) (25)\n\u02d9\u0304Q = Q\u0304 \u0302\u0304\u039b(p,Q) (26) where the average angular velocity vector \u039b\u0304 is given by:\n\u039b\u0304(p,Q) = 1\n4 Q\u1d40\u2207c(p)\u00d7 e1 (27)\nWe claim that the compact subset S is globally uniformly asymptotically stable for the reduced order averaged system\n(25)-(26). To prove this claim, we use the negative of the signal strength field as a Lyapunov function Vc(p) = c(p\u2217)\u2212 c(p). Observe that the system (25)-(26) is autonomous, and so the function Vc is indeed a Lyapunov function for the compact subset S due to Assumption 3.1 [12]. We proceed to compute the derivative of Vc:\nV\u0307c = \u2212\u2207c(p\u0304)\u1d40Q\u0304e1e\u1d401Q\u0304 \u1d40\u2207c(p\u0304) \u2264 0 (28)\nNow, consider the subset N = {(p,Q) \u2208 R3\u00d7SO(3) : V\u0307c = 0}, and observe that S \u2282 N , and that S is an invariant subset of the reduced order averaged system (25)-(26). Suppose that a trajectory (p\u0304(t), Q\u0304(t)) of the system (25)-(26) exists such that (p\u0304(t), Q\u0304(t)) \u2208 N\\S, \u2200t \u2208 I , where I is the maximal interval of existence and uniqueness of the trajectory. Such a trajectory must satisfy:\n\u2207c(p\u0304(t))\u1d40Q\u0304(t)e1 = 0, \u2200t \u2208 I (29)\nThe differentiability of the trajectories allows us to compute the derivative of this identity and obtain that:\nd\ndt\n( \u2207c(p\u0304(t))\u1d40Q\u0304(t)e1 ) = 0, \u2200t \u2208 I (30)\nwhich simplifies to:\n\u2207c(p\u0304(t))\u1d40Q\u0304(t)(\u039b\u0304(p\u0304(t), Q\u0304(t))\u00d7 e1) = 0 (31)\nRecalling equation (27), we see that:\n\u039b\u0304(p\u0304(t), Q\u0304(t))\u00d7 e1 = 1\n4 (Id\u2212 e1e\u1d401)Q\u0304(t)\u1d40\u2207c(p\u0304(t)) (32)\n= 1\n4 Q\u0304(t)\u1d40\u2207c(p\u0304(t)) (33)\nHence, the equation (31) necessitates that:\n\u2016\u2207c(p\u0304(t))\u20162= 0, \u2200t \u2208 I (34)\nwhich is clearly in contradiction with Assumption 3.1. Accordingly, it follows from LaSalle\u2019s Invariance principle [12, Corollary 4.2 to Theorem 4.4] that the compact subset S is globally uniformly asymptotically stable for the system (25)- (26). Hence, we conclude by Theorem 2.1 that the subset S is singularly semi-globally practically uniformly asymptotically stable for the original system defined by (11)-(17).\nRemark 4: If we attempt to apply the framework of singularly pertubed Lie Bracket Approximation introduced in [10] to the system (22)-(24), then the quasi-steady state of the system will be y = [c(ps), c(ps)]\u1d40. Hence, according to [10], the reduced order system is:\np\u0307 = \u221a\n4\u03c9 cos(2\u03c9t\u2212 c(ps)) q1, q\u0307i = 0 (35)\nwhich yields the Lie Bracket system:\n\u02d9\u0304p = Q\u0304e1e\u1d401Q\u0304 \u1d40\u2207c(p\u0304), \u02d9\u0304Q = 0 (36)\nIt is clear that the compact subset S is not asymptotically stable for the Lie Bracket system, and so the framework in [10] does not capture the stability of this system."

Then, there exist constants \u03bb > 0 and \u03b3 > 0 such that for every bounded subset Bx\u00d7Bz \u2282 Rn\u00d7Rm, \u2200tf \u2208 (0,\u221e), and \u2200D \u2208 (0,\u221e), there exists \u03b5\u2217 \u2208 (0, \u03b50) such that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b5\u2217), \u2200(x0, z0) \u2208 Bx\u00d7Bz, and \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, tf/\u03b52], unique trajectories of the system (40) exist and satisfy:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016< D (51) \u2016z(\u03c4)\u2016< \u03b3\u2016z0\u2016 e\u2212\u03bb \u03c4 +D (52)\nProof: The full proof of this Lemma is rather long. So we include it here for review purposes, but it will be replaced by a sketch in the final manuscript to conform with the page limit. The full proof will appear in a journal version of the current manuscript. The proof combines ideas from [10, Lemma 1] and [2, Lemma 2.8.2].\nFix an arbitrary bounded subset Bx \u00d7 Bz \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rm, an arbitrary D \u2208 (0,\u221e), and an arbitrary tf \u2208 (0,\u221e). Due to Assumption 2.1, we know that \u2200(x0, y0) \u2208 Bx \u00d7 Bz, and \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b50], unique trajectories of the system (40) exist. Let [0, \u03c4e) with \u03c4e \u2208 (0,\u221e) be the maximal interval of existence and uniqueness of a given solution (x(\u03c4), z(\u03c4)), where the dependence of the solution on the initial condition is suppressed for brevity. By assumption, we know that the compact subset S is globally uniformly asymptotically stable for the reduced order averaged system (9). Hence, according to [15], [9], we know that the compact subset S is semi-globally practically uniformly asymptotically stable for the reduced order system (3). That is, we know that \u2203\u03b51 \u2208 (0, \u03b50) and a compact subset Nx \u2282 Rn such that\n\u2200x0 \u2208 Bx, and \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b51), solutions x\u0303(\u03c4) to system (3) exist on the interval [0,\u221e), and x\u0303(\u03c4) \u2208 Nx, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0,\u221e). Define an open tubular neighborhood Ox(\u03c4) around x\u0303(\u03c4) by Ox(\u03c4) = {x \u2208 Rn : \u2016x \u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016< D}, and observe that the x-component of the solution to (40) is initially inside Ox(0), i.e. x(0) = x0 \u2208 Ox(0). Moreover, define the compact subset Mx = {x \u2208 Rn : infx\u2032\u2208Nx\u2016x\u2212 x\u2032\u2016< D}, where the overline indicates the closure of a set. The continuity of the solutions (x(\u03c4), z(\u03c4)) implies that one of the following cases holds: C1) \u2203\u03c4D \u2208 (0, \u03c4e) s.t. x(\u03c4) \u2208 Ox(\u03c4), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4D), and \u2016x(\u03c4D) \u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4D)\u2016= D, or C2) x(\u03c4) \u2208 Ox(\u03c4), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4e). Suppose that case C1) holds and observe that x\u0303(\u03c4) \u2208 Mx, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4D]. From Assumption 2.1, we know that the matrix A is Hurwitz, which implies [12] that there exists a function V \u2208 C1(Rm;R), and positive constants \u03b1i, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4} such that:\n\u03b11\u2016z\u20162\u2264 V (z) \u2264 \u03b12\u2016z\u20162 (53) \u2202zV (z)A z \u2264 \u2212\u03b13\u2016z\u20162, \u2016\u2202zV (z)\u2016 \u2264 \u03b14\u2016z\u2016 (54)\nLet c \u2208 (0,\u221e) be such that the compact subset Nz = {z \u2208 Rm : \u2016z\u2016\u2264 \u221a c/\u03b12} contains the bounded set Bz, and\ndefine the compact subsetMz = {z \u2208 Rm : \u2016z\u2016\u2264 \u221a c/\u03b11}. Furthermore, define the compact subset K =Mx\u00d7Mz, and compute the derivative of V along the trajectories of (40):\ndV d\u03c4 = \u2202zV (z)A z + 2\u2211 i=1 \u03b5i\u2202zV (z)hi(x, z, \u03c4) +O(\u03b53) (55)\n\u2264 \u2212 ( \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14\n2\u2211 i=1 \u03b5iLhi,K ) \u2016z\u20162+Bh3,K \u03b53 (56)\nwhere we used the fact that the O(\u03b53) terms are uniformly bounded on the compact subset K, and the vector fields h1 and h2 have an equilibrium point at z = 0 and are Lipschitz continuous. Let \u03b52 = min{\u03b51, 1, \u03b13/(2\u03b14(Lh1,K+Lh2,K))}, and observe that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b52), \u2200(x, z) \u2208 K, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 R, we have:\ndV (z) d\u03c4 \u2264 \u2212\u03b13 2 \u2016z\u20162+Bh3,K \u03b53 (57)\nLet \u03b53 = min{\u03b52, \u221a \u03b13c/(4\u03b12Bh3,K)}, then observe that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b53), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 R, and \u2200(x, z) \u2208 Mx \u00d7 Mz\\Nz, we have that V\u0307 \u2264 0, and so the solution (x(\u03c4), z(\u03c4)) stays inside Mx\u00d7Mz, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4D]. In addition, similar to [12, Theorem 4.18], we have that there exists constants \u03b3, \u03bb, \u03b1 > 0 such that the estimate \u2016z(\u03c4)\u2016< \u03b3 \u2016z0\u2016e\u2212\u03bb\u03c4 + \u03b1 \u03b5 3 2 , holds on the time interval \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4D], \u2200(x0, z0) \u2208 Bx \u00d7 Bz, \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b53). We emphasize that the constants \u03b3, \u03bb, \u03b1 depend on the constants \u03b1j , Lhi,K, Bhi,K, but do not depend on the choice of \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b53). Similar arguments can be used to establish that in C2), we have that (x(\u03c4), z(\u03c4)) \u2208Mx\u00d7Mz, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4e), which implies that [0,\u221e) \u2282 [0, \u03c4e). Now observe that we may choose \u03b5 < (D/\u03b1) 2 3 in to ensure that the result of the lemma holds in case C2) (see also the proof of Lemma 1 in [10]).\nNext, we define an \u03b5-dependent time \u03c4\u03b5 by requiring that the following inequality is satisfied:\n\u03b3 \u2016z0\u2016e\u2212\u03bb \u03c4 < \u03b1\u03b5 3 2 , \u2200z0 \u2208Mz, \u2200\u03c4 > \u03c4\u03b5 (58)\nand observe that this is always possible for \u03b5 > 0. In fact, it can be shown that \u03c4\u03b5 = max{(3/(2\u03bb)) log((\u03b3 \u221a c/\u03b12)/(\u03b1 \u03b5)), 0} satisfies the inequality (58). Now, we show that \u2203\u03b54 \u2208 (0, \u03b53) such that \u03c4\u03b5 < \u03c4D, \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54). To obtain a contradiction, suppose that there exists a bounded subset Bx \u00d7 Bz \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rm, and a D \u2208 (0,\u221e), such that \u2200\u03b54 \u2208 (0, \u03b53), \u2203\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54) such that \u03c4\u03b5 \u2265 \u03c4D. We estimate the difference \u2016x(\u03c4D) \u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4D)\u2016= \u2016 \u222b \u03c4D 0 (\u22112 i=1 \u03b5\ni(vi(x(\u03c4), z(\u03c4), \u03c4)) \u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(\u03c4), \u03c4) + O(\u03b53) ) d\u03c4\u2016\u2264 \u03b5 \u222b \u03c4D 0\nBv+f,Kd\u03c4 \u2264 Bv+f,K\u03c4D\u03b5 \u2264 Bv+f,K\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5, where Bv+f,K is a uniform upper bound on the norm of the integrand inside the compact subset K whose existence is guaranteed by Assumption 2.1. Now, observe that lim\u03b5\u21920 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5 = 0, and so \u2200D \u2208 (0,\u221e), \u2203\u03b54 \u2208 (0, \u03b53) such that Bv+f,K\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b5 \u2264 D/2, \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54). Hence, we have that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54), \u2016x(\u03c4D)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4D)\u2016\u2264 D/2 which contradicts the definition of \u03c4D. Accordingly, we have that for all bounded subsets Bx \u00d7 Bz \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rm, \u2200D \u2208 (0,\u221e), \u2203\u03b54 \u2208 (0, \u03b53), such that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54), \u2200(x0, z0) \u2208 Bx \u00d7 Bz, we have that \u03c4\u03b5 < \u03c4D.\nNext, we show that \u2203\u03b55 \u2208 (0, \u03b54) such that tf/\u03b52 < \u03c4D \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b55). To obtain a contradiction, suppose that there exists a bounded subset Bx \u00d7 Bz \u2282 Rn \u00d7 Rm, a tf \u2208 (0,\u221e), and a D \u2208 (0,\u221e), such that \u2200\u03b55 \u2208 (0, \u03b54), \u2203\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b55) such that tf/\u03b52 \u2265 \u03c4D. Once again, we estimate the difference \u2016x(\u03c4) \u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016 on the interval [0, \u03c4D]. First, for \u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4\u03b5, observe that \u2016x(\u03c4) \u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016= \u2016 \u222b \u03c4 0 (\u22112 i=1 \u03b5\ni(vi(x(s), z(s), s) \u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(s), s)) + O(\u03b53) ) ds\u2016\u2264 Bv+f,K\u03c4\u03b5\u03b5 for some constant Bv+f,K. Since lim\u03b5\u21920 \u03c4\u03b5\u03b5 = 0, we conclude that when \u03c4 < \u03c4\u03b5, the difference \u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing \u03b5 small enough. Second, for \u03c4 > t\u03b5, we have that: \u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016= \u2016 \u222b \u03c4 0 (\u22112 i=1 \u03b5\ni(vi(x(s), z(s), s)\u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(s), s))+O(\u03b53) ) ds\u2016\u2264 \u2016 \u222b \u03c4\u03b5 0 (\u22112 i=1 \u03b5\ni(vi(x(s), z(s), s)\u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(s), s)) ) ds\u2016+\u2016 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (\u22112 i=1 \u03b5\ni(vi(x(s), z(s), s) \u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(s), s)) ) ds\u2016 +Bv+f,K\u03c4D\u03b53, which leads to the estimate:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016\u2264 Bv+f,K(\u03c4\u03b5 + \u03c4D\u03b52)\u03b5+ \u2016I1\u2016 (59) I1 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 2\u2211 i=1 \u03b5i(vi(x(s), z(s), s))\u2212 f\u0303i(x\u0303(s), s))ds (60)\non the interval [0, \u03c4D]. We proceed to estimate \u2016I1\u2016 as follows:\n\u2016I1\u2016 \u2264 \u03b5(\u2016I2\u2016+\u2016I3\u2016) + \u03b52(\u2016I4\u2016+\u2016I5\u2016) (61)\nwhere Ii for i \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5} are given by: I2 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (v1(x(s), z(s), s))\u2212 v1(x(s), 0, s))ds (62)\nI3 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (v1(x(s), 0, s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s))ds (63)\nI4 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (v2(x(s), z(s), s))\u2212 v2(x(s), 0, s))ds (64)\nI5 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (v2(x(s), 0, s)\u2212 f\u03032(x\u0303(s), s))ds (65)\nObserve that vi(x, 0, s) = f\u0303i(x, s), and so we have that: I3 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (\u0303f1(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s))ds (66)\nI5 = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (\u0303f2(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03032(x\u0303(s), s))ds (67)\nWe estimate each of the integrals above, starting by I2, I4 and I5, which can be estimated as:\n\u2016I2\u2016 \u2264 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 Lv1,K\u2016z(s)\u2016d\u03c4 (68)\n\u2016I4\u2016 \u2264 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 Lv2,K\u2016z(s)\u2016ds (69)\n\u2016I5\u2016 \u2264 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 Lf2,K\u2016x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s)\u2016ds (70)\nwhere Lv1,K, Lv2,K, Lf2,K > 0 are Lipschitz constants. Next, we estimate \u2016I3\u2016. We proceed by dividing the interval I = [\u03c4\u03b5, \u03c4 ] into sub-intervals of length T and a left over piece:\nI = k(\u03b5)\u22c3 i=1 [Ti\u22121, Ti] \u22c3 [k(\u03b5)T, \u03c4 ], where Ti = \u03c4\u03b5 + i T , and k(\u03b5) is the unique integer such that k(\u03b5)T \u2264 \u03c4 < k(\u03b5)T + T . Then, we split I3 into a sum of sub-integrals:\nI3 = k(\u03b5)\u2211 i=1 I3,i + \u222b \u03c4 k(\u03b5)T ( f\u03031(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s) ) ds (71)\nI3,i = \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 ( f\u03031(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s) ) ds (72)\nThe part of the integral on the leftover piece can be bounded independently from \u03b5 as follows:\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u222b \u03c4 k(\u03b5)T ( f\u03031(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s) ) ds \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 2Bf1,KT (73) Next, we employ Hadamard\u2019s lemma to obtain:\nI3,i = \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 F1(x(s), x\u0303(s), s)(x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s))ds (74)\nwhere the matrix valued map F1 is given by: F1(x, x\u0303, s) = \u222b 1 0 \u2202w f\u03031(w, s)|w=x\u0303+\u03bb(x\u2212x\u0303)d\u03bb (75)\nThrough adding and subtracting a term, we may write: I3,i = \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 F1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), s) (x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s))ds\n+ \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 \u2206i [ F1 ] (s) (x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s))ds\n(76)\nwhere the term \u2206i[F1] is given by: \u2206i [ F1 ] (s) = F1(x(s), x\u0303(s), s)\u2212 F1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), s)\nNext, since the matrix-valued map F1 is periodic with zero average over its third argument when the other arguments are fixed, we have that\u222b Ti\nTi\u22121\nF1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), s) w ds = 0 (77)\nfor any fixed w. Thus, we may write: I3,i = \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 \u2206i [ F1 ] (x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s))ds\n+ \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 F1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), s)\u2206i[x\u2212 x\u0303]ds (78)\nwhere \u2206i[x\u2212 x\u0303] = (x(s)\u2212x(Ti\u22121))\u2212 (x\u0303(s)\u2212 x\u0303(Ti\u22121)). The fundamental theorem of calculus yields:\n(x(s)\u2212 x(Ti\u22121))\u2212 (x\u0303(s)\u2212 x\u0303(Ti\u22121)) (79)\n=\u03b5 \u222b s Ti\u22121 (v1(x(\u03bd), z(\u03bd), \u03bd)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(\u03bd), \u03bd))d\u03bd +O(\u03b52) (80)\n=\u03b5 \u222b s Ti\u22121 (v1(x(\u03bd), z(\u03bd), \u03bd)\u2212 v1(x(\u03bd), 0, \u03bd))d\u03bd (81)\n+\u03b5 \u222b s Ti\u22121 (\u0303f1(x(\u03bd), \u03bd)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(\u03bd), \u03bd))d\u03bd +O(\u03b52) (82)\nThrough integration by parts, we obtain:\u222b Ti Ti\u22121 F1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), s)\u2206i[x\u2212 x\u0303]ds\n=IF,i(s) \u2206i[x\u2212 x\u0303] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223s=Ti s=Ti\u22121 \u2212 \u03b5 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 IF,i(s) \u2206[\u0303f1]ds\n\u2212\u03b5 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 IF,i(s) \u2206[v1]ds+O(\u03b52)\n(83)\nwhere we have that:\n\u2206[v1] = v1(x(s), z(s), s)\u2212 v1(x(s), 0, s) (84) \u2206[\u0303f1] = f\u03031(x(s), s)\u2212 f\u03031(x\u0303(s), s) (85)\nIF,i(s) = \u222b s Ti\u22121 F1(x(Ti\u22121), x\u0303(Ti\u22121), \u03bd)d\u03bd (86)\nThe boundary term coming out of the integration by parts vanishes because the right factor vanishes at s = Ti\u22121 and the left factor vanishes at s = Ti, leaving only the integral terms. Using Lipschitz continuity and boundedness on compact subsets, it is not hard to see that:\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 IF,i(s) \u2206[v1]ds \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121\nMIF,v1,K \u2016z(s)\u2016ds (87)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 IF,i(s) \u2206[\u0303f1]ds \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121\nMIF,f1,K \u2016\u2206[x]\u2016ds (88)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 \u2206i [ F1 ] \u2206[x]ds \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 \u03b5 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 LF1,K \u2016\u2206[x]\u2016ds (89)\nwhere \u2206[x] = x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s). By utilizing the above estimates, the integral on the sub-intervals can be shown to satisfy the\nbound: \u2016I3,i\u2016 \u2264 LK \u03b5 \u222b Ti Ti\u22121 (\u2016\u2206[x]\u2016+\u2016z(s)\u2016) ds (90)\nfor some Lipschitz constant LK and consequently the integral term I3 satisfies the bound:\n\u2016I3\u2016 \u2264 LK \u03b5 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 (\u2016\u2206[x]\u2016+\u2016z(s)\u2016) ds+ 2Bf1,KT (91)\nCombining (59), (61), (68), (70), (69), and (91), in addition to the fact that \u03c4\u03b5 < \u03c4D, \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b54), we can show that the following estimate holds:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016\u2264 (MK,1 +MK,2\u03c4\u03b5 +MK,3\u03c4D\u03b52)\u03b5\n+MK,4\u03b5 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5 \u2016z(s)\u2016ds+MK,5\u03b52 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u03b5\n\u2016x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s)\u2016ds (92)\nUsing the fact that \u2016z(\u03c4)\u2016< 2\u03b1 \u03b5 32 , \u2200\u03c4 > \u03c4\u03b5 by definition, we obtain that:\u222b \u03c4\n\u03c4\u03b5\n\u2016z(s)\u2016ds \u2264 \u03b1 \u03c4 \u03b5 32 \u2264 \u03b1 \u03c4D \u03b5 3 2 (93)\nNow, remember that in order to obtain a contradiction we assumed that \u03c4D \u2264 tf/\u03b52, and so we will have:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016\u2264 \u03b4(\u03b5) + \u222b \u03c4 0 MK,5\u03b5 2\u2016x(s)\u2212 x\u0303(s)\u2016ds (94)\nwhere the function \u03b4(\u03b5) is given by:\n\u03b4(\u03b5) = MK,1\u03b5+MK,2\u03c4\u03b5\u03b5+MK,3tf\u03b5+MK,4tf\u03b5 1 2 (95)\nAn application of Gro\u0308nwall\u2019s inequality yields:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016\u2264 \u03b4(\u03b5)eMK,5\u03b5 2\u03c4 \u2264 \u03b4(\u03b5)eMK,5\u03b5 2\u03c4D (96)\non the interval \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4D]. Once again, recall that we assumed that \u03c4D \u2264 tf/\u03b52, and so we have:\n\u2016x(\u03c4)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4)\u2016\u2264 \u03b4(\u03b5)eMK,5tf (97)\nNow, observe that lim\u03b5\u21920 \u03b4(\u03b5) = 0, and so we are guaranteed the existence of an \u03b55 \u2208 (0, \u03b54) such that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b55) we will have:\n\u2016x(\u03c4D)\u2212 x\u0303(\u03c4D)\u2016\u2264 D/2 (98)\nwhich contradicts the definition of \u03c4D. Hence, the assumption that \u03c4D \u2264 tf/\u03b52 is wrong, and we have that for all bounded subsets Bx\u00d7Bz \u2282 Rn\u00d7Rm, \u2200D \u2208 (0,\u221e), and \u2200tf \u2208 (0,\u221e), \u2203\u03b55 \u2208 (0, \u03b54), such that \u2200\u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b55), \u2200(x0, z0) \u2208 Bx \u00d7 Bz, we have that tf/\u03b52 < \u03c4D, which shows that the lemma also holds in case C1).\nProposition B.1 follows from this lemma, after reversing the time scaling \u03c4 = \u03c9(t \u2212 t0) and the near identity part of the coordinate shift (39), coupled with [15, Theorem 2.1] and the fact that for x \u2208 K where K is any compact subset, the maps \u03d5i for i \u2208 {1, 2} are uniformly bounded in time due to continuity and periodicity."
