    "abstractText": "Enteroviruses are one of the most abundant groups of viruses infecting humans, and yet there are no approved antivirals against them. To find effective antiviral compounds against enterovirus B group viruses, an in-house chemical library was screened. The most effective compounds against Coxsackieviruses B3 (CVB3) and A9 (CVA9) were CL212 and CL213, two N-phenyl benzamides. Both compounds were more effective against CVA9 and CL213 gave a better EC50 value of 1 \u03bcM with high a specificity index of 140. Both drugs were most effective when incubated directly with viruses suggesting that they mainly bound to the virions. A real-time uncoating assay showed that the compounds stabilized the virions and radioactive sucrose gradient as well as TEM confirmed that the viruses stayed intact. A docking assay, taking into account larger areas around the 2-and 3-fold axes of CVA9 and CVB3, suggested that the hydrophobic pocket gives the strongest binding to CVA9 but revealed another binding site around the 3-fold axis which could contribute to the binding of the compounds. Together, our data support a direct antiviral mechanism against the virus capsid and suggest that the compounds bind to the hydrophobic pocket and 3-fold axis area resulting in the stabilization of the virion.",

            "text": "Enteroviruses belong to the family of picornaviruses, which includes 15 species of viruses in total (enteroviruses A\u2013L, rhinoviruses A\u2013C), but only 7 species can infect humans. They are around 30 nm in diameter and have a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7500 base pairs. The symptoms caused by enterovirus infections are usually mild, but they have also been associated with more serious diseases like type 1 diabetes, heart attack and acute stroke [1\u20133]. Coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) serotypes both belong to the enterovirus B species. Although both viruses often cause mild diseases, CVA9 has also been shown to cause meningitis as well as hepatitis [4,5], while CVB3 is more associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis as well as meningitis [6]. Enteroviruses enter through the fecal-oral route and their primary infection site is the gastrointestinal epithelium. In addition, rhinoviruses and enterovirus D68 can spread through respiratory secretions and replicate in the respiratory tract [7]. After the initial replication, the viruses can spread to secondary tissues such as the skin, heart, or pancreas [8].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1028. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15031028 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nAntivirals are needed as an alternative way to combat enterovirus infections besides vaccines. The most promising results in the search for effective antivirals have thus far been obtained only with pleconaril and vapendavir, both are capsid-binding inhibitors, which faced severe drawbacks such as interference with metabolic pathways of other drugs and drug resistance [9]. Therefore, further efforts are needed to develop novel antivirals. In this context, we have screened an in-house chemical library of 200 compounds of diverse chemical scaffolds, previously synthesized in our lab, against CVA9 and CVB3. The structural classes represented have a history of antimicrobial, antimycobacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities and fall into different categories: pyrroles, pyrazoles, imidazoles, N-phenyl benzamides, toluidines, phenyl cinnamamides, methanimines, triazoles, F-anilines, phenyl hydrazides, and furane (details and chemical structures of the molecules are presented in supporting information, Figure S1, Table S1). Among the screened compounds two N-phenyl benzamides showed outstanding activity against CVA9. In this paper, we describe the antiviral screening and, for those molecules showing potential, the study of their inhibition mechanism and efficacy."

For these molecules, a wider concentration series against CVA9 and CVB3 was performed to further assess their effectivity and cytotoxicity (Figure 1). Remarkably, both compounds showed no apparent cytotoxicity even at the highest tested concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Both drugs worked efficiently against CVA9 infection reaching high cell viability (70 and 80% for CL212 and CL213, respectively) already at 10 \u00b5M concentration.

            "text": "To find out at which point of the virus life cycle the inhibitors show antiviral effect, time-of-addition assays were performed with both CVA9 and CVB3. In the assay, it was tested if the molecules are effective directly on the virions, effective when added after virus entry to the cells, or when being present all the time (see Materials and Methods for details). The CPE-based assay demonstrated that CL212 (100 \u00b5M) inhibited CVA9 and CVB3 infections most efficiently when it was present the whole infection time, while with CL213 (10 \u00b5M), the best efficacy was obtained with the pre-incubation (Figure 4A). qPCR-based assay measuring of the infection during the first 5.5 h further confirmed that for both viruses and compounds, the pre-treatment showed the best protection against virus infection (Figure 4B). Confocal microscopy further showed that the pre-treatment of CVA9 with CL213 was the most efficient as the infection percentage was only 4.2% (n = 259) while in control infection and post-treatment, 25% (n = 259) and 23% (n = 221) of cells were infected, respectively. Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed that pre-treatment allowed entry of CVA9, but the virus was blocked in endosomes (Figure 4C).\nAltogether, the results showed that both compounds were able to inactivate the tested enteroviruses already after pre-incubation, but molecules had a contributing effect later in the infection as well.\n3.4. CL212 and CL213 Stabilize the Virus Capsid 3.4.1. Uncoating\nTo reveal if CL212 and CL213 affect the uncoating of the enteroviruses, the in-house developed real-time uncoating assay was performed. The uncoating of the virus would be seen in the assay as an increased fluorescence as the virus genome is released and, on the contrary, low fluorescence would signify the virus staying intact [18]. As a control, we performed an uncoating assay of both viruses in a stabilizing storage buffer or in an opening buffer which has earlier been shown to enhance the uncoating of CVA9 [18] and which here increased the fluorescence 8-times or 2-times higher with CVA9 and CVB3, respectively (Figure 5A).\nBoth molecules incubated with CVA9 resulted in lower fluorescence than without the molecule throughout the whole 60 min measured at 15-min intervals (Figure 5B). These results thus indicate that both compounds kept CVA9 intact and prevented even the minor expansion of the virions seen for the control virus. Similarly, CVB3 treated with CL213 resulted in lower fluorescence values than control values, suggesting that CL213 stabilized also CVB3. Although CL212 did not similarly lower the fluorescence when added to CVB3, it did not, however, cause further opening of the virus as the fluorescence was not higher than the control values. In conclusion, neither of the molecules induced the opening of the virus but rather stabilized the capsid and prevented RNA release.\n3.4.2. Virus Stays Intact Detected by Sucrose Gradient Fractionation\nAs both CL212 and CL213 showed great efficacy on CVA9, we next used radioactive gradient separation which demonstrates the status of the virus in more detail: the intact/full (160 S), partially opened (135 S), and RNA-free, uncoated virus capsid (80 S). After incubating the radioactive CVA9 with the molecules for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C, the samples were subjected to a 5\u201320% sucrose gradient and fractionated from the top (Figure 6). As for the control, untreated virus showed the highest peak around the fractions 16\u201318 as expected, and no apparent peak around 8\u201310 fractions, suggesting no empty viruses in the control preparation. After treatment with both molecules, the peak of CVA9 was detected amongst the same fractions as with the control and no virions around 8\u201310 fractions, suggesting that the virus remained intact during the treatments without any signs of expansion or opening.\n3.4.3. Virus Stays Intact Detected by Electron Microscopy\nIn order to get more direct information on the CVA9 virions after treatments with CL212 and CL213, we performed negative staining in TEM (Figure 7). In all samples, the majority of viruses showed a white appearance against dark background with no signs of expansion or opening [18]. In addition, virions were evenly spread on the grid and neither of the compounds caused aggregation or clustering of the viruses."

While most of the CL212 and CL213 poses occupied the hydrophobic pocket found within the 2-fold axis of the symmetry grid box, they favored the larger hydrophobic pocket of CVA9 more, over the collapsed pocket of the CVB3 Nancy strain. CL212 poses mainly occupied the hydrophobic pocket: 55% (22/40) in CVA9 and 82.5% (33/40) in CVB3.\nThe 3-fold axis pore accommodated some CL212 poses: 35% (14/40) in CVA9 but less with CVB3, 7.5% (3/40). CL213 poses were also mostly distributed between the hydrophobic pocket (30%, 6/20) and 3-fold axis pore (35%, 7/20) in the case of CVA9, but in contrast, all the CL213 poses were located in the hydrophobic pocket of CVB3 (39/39). Lower binding energies of both compounds (Figure 10) within the hydrophobic pocket of CVA9 indicate their higher affinity for this pocket compared to that of CVB3. Additionally, the generally lower binding energies of CL213 compared to CL212, suggest that CL213 binds more strongly to the capsid."

            "text": "Although much effort has been put into anti-enteroviral research over the years, none of the studied compounds have passed clinical trials [19]. As enteroviruses are still one of the most abundant viruses infecting humans, more antiviral strategies and new molecules need to be explored. In this study, we screened an in-house library of 200 synthetic molecules and found two potential compounds, CL212 and CL213 that prevented the infection of CVA9 with low micromolar concentrations. In addition, the molecules showed very low cytotoxicity against the studied A549 cells. To get an idea of the antiviral mechanism, a time of additional study was conducted. Interestingly, both CL212 and CL213 showed efficacy against CVA9 either when incubated before infection yet CL212 also had a small effect when added 1 h p.i. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that the molecules did not hinder receptor binding and internalization but allowed entry and blocked infection in endosomes. Further in vitro studies also suggested that CL212 and CL213 acted as capsid binders as the uncoating of the virus was prevented in the presence of the compounds and according to TEM imaging, the particles were intact. We have shown earlier that the uncoating of CVA9 starts after 30 min but takes place mostly between 1\u20132 h p.i. [20]. Thus, it is likely that the addition of stabilizing molecules even after 1 h p.i. was able to prevent the uncoating of the virus and thus infection. All in all, the studies thus showed that the antiviral effect could be achieved with a pre-incubation only, indicating that the molecules acted as capsid binders. However, other contributing effects later in infection cannot be ruled out. Docking studies suggest that the majority of the CL212 and CL213 docking poses localize into the hydrophobic pocket of both viruses. For many years the best-identified area in the enterovirus capsid occupying antiviral molecules has been the hydrophobic pocket [21\u201326]. However, recently also another pocket was found by groups of Sarah Butcher and Johan Neyts to bind antiviral molecules against enteroviruses and rhinoviruses [27]. In addition, our earlier in-silico docking studies have suggested that an antiviral polyphenol resveratrol, could occupy the 3-fold axis pore of CVA9 [16]. It is not a surprise that the most potential binding site for both CL212 and CL213 was the hydrophobic pocket. Interestingly, the other experimentally proven binding site, namely the Butcher-Neyts pocket, did not occupy any of the poses, but instead, the 3-fold axis pore seemed to be a potential binding site with low binding energies. Although the 3-fold axis pore has not been proven experimentally to be a binding site, in the light of our earlier results with resveratrol, it cannot be ignored and should be studied further. Although the most potential binding site in both viruses was the hydrophobic pocket, both molecules fitted better in the pocket of CVA9. In addition to the visual inspection, also the higher binding energies suggested that the molecules did not fit well into the pocket of CVB3. As the Nancy strain of CVB3 has been shown to be resistant to pleconaril, another capsid binder, due to an amino acid substitution in the VP1 inside the pocket [21,28,29], poorer binding and lower antiviral effect with CL212 and CL213 was not unexpected.\nTherefore, the results with the Nancy strain of CVB3 act as indirect proof of the hydrophobic pocket being the target of the molecules. When new antiviral molecules are developed, important initial parameters that are studied in vitro include the EC50 and CC50 values of the molecules as well as the ratio of the efficacy versus cytotoxicity, namely SI. Although a rather high dose of the molecules is suggested by our study (1\u20132 \u00b5M), low cytotoxicity makes these, especially CL213 a great molecule to develop further. Physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic properties, and the drug-likeness of both CL212 and CL213, calculated using SwissADME and given in the supporting information, show that both compounds are endowed with good drug-likeness properties. Both compounds show zero violation of the Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge rules, moreover, compounds can be promising agents that can very easily be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, we showed that two N-phenyl benzamides, CL212 and CL213, efficiently inhibited the infection of CVA9 with low micromolar concentration. We further demonstrated that the compounds acted as capsid binders with suggested localization into the hydrophobic pocket and 3-fold axis area.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15031028/s1.
