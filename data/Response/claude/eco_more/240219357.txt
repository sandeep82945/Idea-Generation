 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Test other viscoelastic liquids to see if the critical stress behavior is universal across materials. The paper hypothesizes this may be true, but more experimental data is needed.

2. Develop constitutive models that can capture the MAOStress behavior exhibited by PVA-Borax, including the frequency dependence of the material functions. The current SSTNM model was not derived for stress-controlled flows. 

3. Explore the connections between critical stress amplitude and wall slip/instabilities in complex fluids. The paper mentions a link to prior work on critical stress for wall slip. This could be an interesting area to study further.

4. Optimize experimental protocols and rheometer control for stress-controlled MAOS measurements. The paper mentions some challenges in resolving material functions at high frequencies in stress control. Improved methods could expand the technique.

5. Apply the frequency-sweep MAOS technique using the insights on critical stress amplitude to enable faster characterization of viscoelastic liquids. The near constant critical stress may simplify application of this method.
