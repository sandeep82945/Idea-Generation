 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the quality of prenatal care among Latina mothers during the Trump era. The paper found no major changes in inadequate prenatal care utilization, but quality of care may have declined. Research could look at metrics like wait times, provider discrimination, and satisfaction with care. 

2. Investigate the effects of Trump-era immigration policies on birth outcomes in border communities. The paper found the worst impacts among Mexican immigrants, so research could focus on areas like Texas, Arizona, and California that may have unique immigration enforcement effects.

3. Study the intergenerational effects of Trump-era stress on Latina mothers. The paper shows increases in adverse birth outcomes which may impact long-term health of offspring. Research could follow cohorts of affected children and assess outcomes. 

4. Analyze the mental health effects of Trump-era stress among pregnant Latina women. The paper hypothesizes stress pathways but does not directly measure stress. Research could survey Latina mothers about anxiety, depression, and discrimination experienced.

5. Examine the role of resilience factors in mitigating Trump-era stress. The paper shows heterogeneous effects among Latinas, suggesting some groups may have more resilience. Research could identify protective factors like social support that buffer impacts of discrimination.
