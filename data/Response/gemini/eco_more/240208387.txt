1. **Parametrise consumption and the value function in terms of the shadow fraction of wealth.** This would simplify many of the arguments and facilitate an easy comparison to the individual cases. It would also highlight that all other quantities can be expressed in a simple fashion in terms of this single variable.
2. **Investigate analytically the comparative statics with respect to the risk aversion parameter R and the elasticity of intertemporal complementarity S.** One of the advances of this paper is that we do not (only) consider the additive case, and therefore it is possible for the first time to disentangle the impact of risk aversion and the intertemporal substitution. We find that in many circumstances (for example, if R < 1 or R ≥ 2) the boundaries of the no-transaction region are monotonic in the risk aversion parameter in the sense that the agent with higher risk aversion buys and sells the risky asset when the fraction of wealth in the risky asset is at a lower threshold than an agent with lower risk aversion investing and consuming in the same market. However, this is not universal and for R ∈ (1, 2) this monotonic relationship can fail. The dependence of the no transaction wedge on S is less clear cut, and whether the no-transaction region moves towards or away from a cash portfolio depends on a crucial combination of parameters, see Section 8.
3. **Show how risk aversion R mainly governs the optimal investment strategy and the notransaction region (the co-efficient of elasticity of inter-temporal complimentarity S does not appear directly in any of the first three terms of the expansion in small transaction costs for the boundaries of the no-trade interval) and S mainly governs the rate of consumption.** Further, (following on from Janeček and Shreve in the additive case R = S and Melnyk et al for EZ-SDU) we show that consumption may increase or decrease with the introduction of small transaction costs, and we give an explanation which shows that the introduction of transaction costs will increase the instantaneous consumption rate if S is small and decrease it if S is large.
4. **Investigate the case when the Merton line lies outside the no-transaction region.** This can only happen when qM /∈ . For example, in the case qM > 1, if γ ↓ > qMqM−1 then the Merton line does not even lie in the solvency region Sγ↑,γ↓ . Further, if qM > 1 then there are cases when p ∗ = p∗(γ↑, γ↓) is a non-monotonic function of transaction costs. The fact that it is initially increasing will follow from the small transaction cost results and especially Corollary 7.3; the fact that it must subsequently decrease will follow from the fact that the no-transaction region must lie inside the solvency region.
5. **Maximising the long run rate of portfolio growth under transaction costs.** This problem is related to the investment-consumption problem, but the objective is different. The problem is to find a trading strategy which maximises the long run rate of portfolio growth, and the optimal strategy is to keep a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset. The problem is well-posed if and only if the Merton ratio is greater than one. The optimal strategy is to keep a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset, and the optimal fraction is given by the Merton ratio. The problem is well-posed if and only if the Merton ratio is greater than one.
