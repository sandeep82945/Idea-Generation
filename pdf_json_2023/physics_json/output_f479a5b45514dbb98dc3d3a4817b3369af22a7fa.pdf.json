    "abstractText": "Protein methyl groups can participate in multiple motional modes on different time scales. Sub-nanosecond to nano-second time scale motions of methyl axes are particularly challenging to detect for small proteins in solutions. In this work we employ NMR relaxation interference between the methyl H-H/H-C dipole-dipole interactions to characterize methyl axes motions as a function of temperature in a small model protein villin headpiece subdomain (HP36), in which all non-exchangeable protons are deuterated with the exception of methyl groups of leucine and valine residues. The data points to the existence of slow motional modes of methyl axes on sub-nanosecond to nanosecond time scales. Further, at high temperatures for which the overall tumbling of the protein is on the order of 2 ns, we observe a coupling between the slow internal motion and the overall molecular tumbling, based on the anomalous order parameters and their temperature-dependent trends. The addition of 28% (w/w) glycerol-d8 increases the viscosity of the solvent and separates the timescales of internal and overall tumbling, thus permitting for another view of the necessity of the coupling assumption for these sites at high temperatures.",

A suite of NMR relaxation measurements focused on 13C, 2H, and 1H nuclei have been developed, each of them requiring a different labeling pattern and different extent of protein perdeuteration [2\u20135]. These measurements yield amplitude and often rate constants for the motions of methyl axis. Among those, the experiments based on deuterium probes are often most precise due to employment of multiple relaxation rates simultaneously in the fitting procedures [6]. Sub-nanosecond time scales of methyl axes are especially difficult to detect for small proteins in solution, for which the overall molecular tumbling times are below about 10 ns. Sun and Tugarinov [7] suggested a technique that is particularly suited for smaller-size proteins with the molecular tumbling times approaching 5 ns. It is focused on relaxation interference between the Hi-Hj and Hi-C dipole-dipole interactions and differentiates the rates of the fast-relaxing proton single-quantum transitions. depending on the state of 13C spins.

Further, in order to separate the time scales of the overall and internal motions, we also perform the measurements in the presence of glycerol, which increases the viscosity of solution to slow down the overall tumbling."

For the \u03b7HH/CH measurements, an in-phase and an anti-phase spectrum (with respect to 13C), both selecting the L1 transitions [7,21], were recorded by setting the \u03d56 phase of the 90\u25e6 pulse on 13C prior to acquisition to 45\u25e6 and 225\u25e6, respectively, for each relaxation delay T. 350 and 1024 points complex data points were recorded in the indirect 13C and the direct 1H dimensions, the spectral widths were 1429 Hz (13C) and 6510 Hz (1H), and the number of scans was 64. The interscan delay was 1.5\u20132.0 s. The FIDs were processed with the NmrPipe/NmrDraw/NlinLS package [22]. Each dimension was apodized by a 90\u25e6 phase-shifted squared sine-bell window function and zero-filled once. Finally, the in-phase and anti-phase spectra were added and subtracted to separate the two 13C-doublet components into two spectra. We used multiples of 1/(1JHC) = 8 ms for the relaxation delays such as 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40 ms. For data at 4.5 \u25e6C and 28 \u25e6C four relaxation delays were collected. The rate \u03b7HH/CH was obtained from exponential fits of the ratio of intensities of the two components. The molecular tumbling times, \u03c4c, were determined from 15N R1 and R1\u03c1 relaxation experiments [23] at the same temperature range as the cross-correlated relaxation measurements were conducted using the 15N labeled perdeuterated sample. DOSY measurements [24] were performed focusing on the intensities of the residual protons in deuterated glycerol, using a stimulated echo sequence with bipolar gradients [25,26]. In particular, the standard Bruker pulse sequence \u201cstebpgp1s19\u201d was used, which utilizes water-gate water suppression [27]. The full stimulated echo time was 0.1 s, the total gradient time 1.6 to 2.2 ms, and the delay between the bipolar gradients was 0.4 ms. The temperature was calibrated using perdeuterated methanol [28]. Each temperature point was equilibrated for 20\u201330 min before the start of the experiment, The temperature was controlled within at least 0.2 \u25e6C precision with the BSVT Variable Temperature controler and BCU-1 pre-colling accessory. Each spectrum in the relaxation or diffusion series measurements utilized 16 to 32 dummy scans and the orders of the relaxation delays and diffusion times were randomized."

The experiment is designed to measure the differences between the two 13C spinstate associated relaxation rates of fast-relaxing 1H single-quantum transitions. In macromolecules, the relaxation rates of all 1H single-quantum transitions in isolated methyl groups are mono-exponential and adopt only one of two possible values. Here, we focus on the faster relaxing components, which span the spin-3/2 manifold. The corresponding relaxation rate, R2,F, is further modified by the presence of the 13C atom [21]. Depending on the specific 1H transitions, the \u03b1 or the \u03b2 spin state of 13C increases the rates by the cross-correlated relaxation rate \u03b7HH/CH (R2,Ff), while the other one decreases the rate by \u03b7HH/CH (R2,Fs). \u03b7HH/CH can be extracted as (R2,Ff \u2212 R2,Fs)/2. The pulse sequence is based on a 2D [13C,1H]-HMQC experiment [7]. In the indirect evolution period, the slow-relaxing [13C,1H] multiple-quantum coherences are evolved. Part of these coherences are converted into the fast-relaxing single-quantum coherences, which are selected and relaxed during a relaxation period T. Finally, we detect on 1H the L1-1H transition, which can be either in \u03b1 or \u03b2 state with respect to 13C and relax with R2,Ff and R2,Fs, respectively. The two doublet components of L1 are sequestered into two spectra by Inphase-Antiphase (IPAP) selection [7]. The tumbling times have to be determined independently, which we acquired through 15N R1 and R1\u03c1 relaxation experiments [23]. The cross-correlated relaxation rates \u03b7HH/CH are obtained from the exponential fits of the ratios of intensities of the two components of the two 13C-doublets. This experiment is more tolerant to proteins with low tumbling times in comparison to techniques based on the difference of the auto-relaxation relaxation rates of the two 13C-doublet components individually [29]. The \u201ctolerance\u201d was judged from the correlation of methyl axis order parameters derived from the 2H methods [3,6] versus the proton-based cross-correlated relaxation techniques. The agreement was more difficult to achieve for ubiquitin at high temperatures at which tC values fell below 3.6 ns."

            "text": "The general expression for the cross-relaxation \u03b7HH/CH rate is given by [7]:\n\u03b7HH/CH = 6 ( \u00b50\n4\u03c0 )2 \u03b33H\u03b3C}2 r3HHr 3 CH ( J(0) + 3 2 J(\u03c9H) )\n(1)\nwhere \u00b50 is the permeability of free space, \u03b3X is the gyromagnetic ratio of spin X, h\u0304 is Planck\u2019s constant divided by 2\u03c0, rHH and rCH are known interatomic distances [21], and \u03c4C is the overall tumbling time of the molecule, considered isotropic in this case. J(\u03c9H) is the spectral density of the Hi-Hj and Hk-C interactions at the Larmor frequency of the proton, which includes the terms where i = k or j = k as well as when all 3 indices i, j, k are different and include contributions from all protons belonging to the same methyl group as well as minor contributions from external protons. The latter were estimated to be on the order of 2% or less [7]. The expression also assumes negligible contributions from the slow-relaxing 1H transitions into the \u03b7HH/CH rate. Taking into account three types of motions: the overall molecular tumbling, methyl rotations, and the motions of the methyl axis, the expression for J(\u03c9) under the assumption of the model-free is [15,30]:\nJ(\u03c9) = 15 ( P2(cos \u03b8axis, HH)P2(cos \u03b8axis, CH) S2axis\u03c4C 1+(\u03c9\u03c4C) 2 + [< P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) >\u2212\nP2(cos \u03b8axis, HH)P2(cos \u03b8axis, CH)S2axis ] \u03c4e\n1+(\u03c9\u03c4e) 2 ) (2) where 1\u03c4e = 1 \u03c4f + 1\u03c4C , \u03b8axis, HH is the angle between the methyl three-fold axis and a vector that connects a pair of methyl 1H nuclei, and \u03b8axis, CH is the angle between the methyl three-fold axis and a vector that connects 13C and 1H nuclei. Assuming the ideal tetrahedral\nMagnetochemistry 2023, 9, 33 5 of 15\ngeometry, P2(cos \u03b8axis, HH) = \u22121/2 and P2(cos \u03b8axis, CH) = \u22121/3. S2axis is the order parameter for motions of the methyl three-fold axis. The value of < P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) > depends on the relative time scales of motions of the methyl three-fold axis and the methyl rotations. If the two time scales are similar, as reflected in the single value of \u03c4f , then the magnitude of the H-H and C-H interactions are not averaged by the methyl jumps and therefore < P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) > reflects the instantaneous angle between H-H and C-H bonds. The H-H/C-H interactions without a shared proton within the same methyl group do not contribute to J(0). Thus, < P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) > = 1/2. However, averaging over the cases of shared and non-shared protons within the same methyl group must be carried out to calculate the average contribution to J(\u03c9H). After the averaging, < P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) > = 1/6. Thus, in this case we have\nJ(\u03c9H) = 130\n( S2axis\u03c4C\n1+(\u03c9H\u03c4C) 2 +\n[ 1 \u2212 S2axis ] \u03c4e 1+(\u03c9H\u03c4e) 2 ) J(0) = 130 ( S2axis\u03c4C + [ 3 \u2212 S2axis ] \u03c4e ) (3)\nIn the case when methyl rotations are much faster than the methyl axis motions, we assume that the only effect of methyl rotations is the averaging of the interactions, while \u03c4f reflects only the time scale of the methyl axis motions. In this case < P2(cos \u03b8CH, HH) > = P2(cos \u03b8axis, HH)P2(cos \u03b8axis, CH) = 1/6. The spectral density expressions are then simplified to:\nJ(\u03c9H) = 130\n( S2axis\u03c4C\n1+(\u03c9H\u03c4C) 2 +\n[ 1 \u2212 S2axis ] \u03c4e 1+(\u03c9H\u03c4e) 2 ) J(0) = 130 ( S2axis\u03c4C + [ 1 \u2212 S2axis ] \u03c4e ) (4)\nWhile in both Equations (3) and (4) the main contributions are due to J(0) terms and thus are field-independent, their dependence of J(\u03c9H) on proton Larmor frequency suggests a potential value of analyzing field-dependence of the experimental data. Under the assumption of the macromolecular limit, the expression for \u03b7HH/CH is given by:\n\u03b7HH/CH = 1 5 ( \u00b50 4\u03c0 )2 S2axis\u03b33H\u03b3C}2\u03c4C r3HHr 3 CH\n(5)\nFor small-sized proteins, the deviations from the macromolecular limit can be significant and will be elaborated below. When the time scales of methyl axes motions and overall tumbling approach each other, i.e., the condition \u03c4C & 5\u03c4f no longer holds, the assumption of the model-free model for the decoupling approximation between the internal and global motions of the macromolecule can break down. One of the ways to account for the effect of coupling between the overall and internal motion is to rewrite the model-free correlation function without the assumption of the direct decoupling, assuming that the interaction vector first reaches a quasi-equilibrium orientation with respect to the local environment and the molecular tumbling has an indirect effect through the orienting potential for the local director axis [18]. This is in concept similar to the slowly relaxing local structure formalism [16,17]. In this scenario the order parameters are overestimated if treated within the decoupled model-free formalism. The corresponding spectral density function describes synchronous variations in the average orientation of the bond vector and the molecular orientation induced through the geometrical constraints imposed by a rigid bond environment. The spectral density in this model is obtained from the corresponding model-free expressions by the following substitutions: replace \u03c4e with \u03c4f , replace S2axis with S\u0303 2 axis=S 2 axis \u03c4C \u03c4C\u2212\u03c4f . With the assumption of separation of time scales of methyl rotations and methyl axes motions (i.e., same assumption as in Equation (4)) the spectral density function is given by:\nJ(\u03c9) = 1\n30  S\u03032axis\u03c4C 1 + (\u03c9\u03c4C) 2 + [ 1 \u2212 S\u03032axis ] \u03c4e 1 + ( \u03c9\u03c4f )2  (6)\nMagnetochemistry 2023, 9, 33 6 of 15\nFor smaller-sized proteins with \u03c4C values under about 5 ns the assumption of the macromolecular limit may not be adequate, especially for cases when methyl axes motions become relatively slow. The comparison is given in Figure 2, in which the y-axis represents the relative error in the order parameter for calculations in the macromolecular limit (given by S2app) versus either the full formula of Equation (4) or only its J(0) contribution. S2axis represent the input order parameter used in calculations of Equation (4). When the spectral density function of Equation (6) is used, which explicitly takes into account the coupling between the overall and internal motions, the corrections are amplified. The relative correction, as expected, is larger for small values of \u03c4C and small values of the methyl axis order parameters. For example, for \u03c4C = 2 ns and S2axis = 0.5, the relative correction using the model-free formula of Equation (4) with the full spectral density is 35%. Note, that if the macromolecular limit and the model-free assumptions are employed in situations when they are not applicable, it is possible to obtain the apparent order parameter exceeding 1.\nMagnetochemistry 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 The spectral density in this model is obtained from the corresponding model-free expressions by the following substitutions: replace \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc52 with \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc53 , replace \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 2 with\n?\u0303?\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 2 =\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\n2 \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc36\u2212\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc53 .

When the spectral density function of Equation (6) is used, which explicitly takes into account the\ncoupling between the overall and internal motions, the corrections are amplified. The rel-\native correction, as expected, is larger for small values of \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc36 and small values of the methyl axis order parameters. For example, for \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc36 = 2 ns and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 2 = 0.5, the relative correction using the model-free formula of Equation (4) with the full spectral density is 35%.\nNote, that if the macromolecular limit and the model-free assumptions are employed in\nsituations when they are not applicable, it is possible to obtain the apparent order param-\neter exceeding 1.\n2 and the macromolecular\nlimit of Equation (5), given by \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d 2 , versus the correlation time for methyl axes motions \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc53.

Overall Tumbling Times and the Effect of Glycerol\nThe overall diffusion tensor for HP36 was previously found to be isotropic in the\nentire temperature range of 2\u201332 \u00b0C for the protonated protein [32]. The tumbling times\nfor the perdeuterated 15N-labeled protein have been obtained at 2, 7, 15, 22 and 32 \u00b0C from\nthe residue-averaged 15N R1\u03c1/R1 ratios (Table S2) [23]. These tumbling times scale linearly\nwith viscosity/temperature \u014b/T, (Figure 6, black circles), in similarity to what has been\nobserved for the protonated protein, which has been shown to have an isotropic diffusion\ntensor across the entire temperature range. [32] In the presence of glycerol, as expected,\nmarked changes in the viscosity are observed causing tumbling times to increase (Figure\n6, blue line). However, the linear dependence of \u03c4c on \u014b/T strongly suggests that the sym-\nmetry of the diffusion tensor remains unchanged with temperature. The viscosities in the\npresence of glycerol were calculated using the approach of Cheng [33] with modifications\nby Volk and K\u00e4hler [34]. At 32 \u00b0C we have also conducted measurements of \u03c4c for different\nglycerol content to further confirm the linearly with \u014b/T (Figure S3). Further, the transla-\ntional diffusion coefficients obtained using DOSY for the 15N-labeled protein with the 28%\nglycerol content scale linearly with the inverse of the tumbling times (Figure S4). The\nDOSY are focused on the residual proton signal of 99% deuterated glycerol, as explained\nabove.\nWe are thus in a good position to apply the isotropic limit for all cases. It is of note\nthat simulations of diffusion tensors for various glycerol content has been previously per-\nformed for ribonuclease barnase and corresponded well to those determined from 15N\nR2/R1 ratios [35].\nFigure 5.

The irregularities noted in the temperature dependence imply the possibility of slower motions of methyl axes that need to be taken into account outside of the macromolecular limit approximation. As the cross-correlated relaxation rate is a single measurement, the fitting procedure cannot accommodate unambiguously more than one fitting parameter and we need to make assumptions regarding the values of the correlation times \u03c4f . According to the calculations of Figure 2 for the typical value of \u03c4C in the 2 to 5 ns range for HP36 protein, the deviation from the macromolecular limit becomes significant when the correlation time of the methyl axis motions is above 300\u2013500 ps, with the use of the model-free spectral density of Equation (4). We, thus, first make the simplest assumption of \u03c4f = 500 ps for all sites at all temperatures. While this is clearly an approximation and \u03c4f values will in reality depend on temperature, this allows us to move to a different timescale regime qualitatively, within the precision of the data. With this assumption the resulting S2axis values are shown in black in Figure 8. For most sites, the temperature dependence trends are improved, apart from the two V50 sites and L61 sites. Further, V50 sites still display order parameters larger than 1 at the highest temperature.\nMagnetochemistry 2023, 9, 33 11 of 15Magnetochemistry 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15\nFigure 8.

Both methyl groups\nin each residue are analyzed within the same model for consistency. We perform the fits with the internal correlation times fixed at either 500 ps or 1 ns (Figure S5), and arrive at the conclusion that the 1 ns choice is needed to bring the order parameters below 1 for V50 sites, as well as obtain the expected order parameter trend with temperature for both residues, i.e., no increase in S2axis with temperature. These values of S 2 axis are shown in magenta in Figure 8. As glycerol increases the viscosity of the solution and thus the overall tumbling times, measurements in the presence of glycerol in principle can help increase the timescale separation of internal and overall motions and thus extend the range of validity of Equation (4) at high temperatures. Indeed, when the \u03b7HH/CH rates are measured in the presence of 28% w/w glycerol (Table 2) and the fits to Equations (1) and (4) are performed with \u03c4f = 500 ps, there are no sites that display S2axis > 1 at 32\n\u25e6C (Figure 9). Further, in general there is an agreement between the values of the order parameters obtained with and without glycerol\n(Figures 9 and S6), with the exception f residues that had the potential coupling betwee\nthe ove all and internal motions, as desc ibed in the section above. Thus, the experimental\nresults the presence of glycerol support the choice of spectral density of Equation (6) for\nV50 and L61 sites. It is of note that coalescence of overall and internal motions was also observed for carbonyl backbone sites in HP36 at high temperatures [36]. The resulting values of the slopes of dS2axis/dT are shown in Figure 10 for either the macromolecular limit or the final choice of the models with the inclusion of slow motions. The solid lines show their corresponding weighted averages. In the macromolecular limit the temperature dependence is mostly flat, and is contrasted with the one obtained on the basis of prior 2H relaxation data for the 65% deuterated HP36 [14].

The 2H relaxation data was fitted without the slow time scale motions of methyl axis, with all sites indicating \u03c4f values at or below 60 ps. The reason for the different ranges of \u03c4f presented by the two experiments is not entirely clear.

The smaller-sized flexible domains can have functional methyl groups dynamics defining regulatory or interfacial properties. The above analysis highlights the need for a careful choice of spectral densities when analyzing functionable methyl axes motions in smaller-sized proteins and domains."

            "text": "From a methodological perspective, we found that the method based on the interference of H-H/H-C dipolar interactions can be useful for detecting and evaluating methyl axes motions in cases with relatively similar timescales of overall tumbling and internal methyl axes fluctuations. We have applied the technique to the HP36 protein, for which correlation times range between 2 to 5 ns in the temperature range of 2 to 32 \u25e6C, in which the protein is at least 99% folded. When the fit using the macromolecular limit was attempted, the temperature dependence of methyl axes order parameters was either mostly flat or displayed increased S2axis values at high temperatures, with the extreme case of V50 showing S 2 axis above the value of 1. This prompted us to step away from the macromolecular limit and employ the use of slow time scales in the 0.5\u20131 ns range. Further, for V50 and L61 methyl groups we have found that the spectral density model that explicitly takes into account the coupling between the overall molecular tumbling and internal motions is needed at least for high temperatures. Changing solvent viscosity with glycerol has proved to be a useful tool for separating the timescales of the two motional modes and validating the approach.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/magnetochemistry9010033/s1, Figure S1: Sample DOSY decay curves.
