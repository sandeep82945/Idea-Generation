 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate lower cost cultivation techniques for Haematococcus lacustris to reduce the production costs of natural astaxanthin. This could include optimizing growth in wastewater sources, developing more efficient photobioreactors, or testing alternative cheap materials like plastic bubble wraps. 

2. Study the genes and pathways involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis and accumulation in Haematococcus lacustris using transcriptomics. Identify key genes that could be targeted to increase astaxanthin yields.

3. Develop more efficient and cost-effective downstream processing methods for extracting astaxanthin from Haematococcus cells, such as using mechanical cell disruption, nanoparticles, or nanoscalpels. The goal would be to extract astaxanthin without expensive cell lysis.

4. Test different encapsulation techniques to improve the bioavailability of astaxanthin supplements, such as using biopolymers, nanoemulsions, or extracellular vesicles. Compare bioavailability of free versus encapsulated astaxanthin.

5. Conduct clinical trials on astaxanthin's effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic in humans. Research its potential to modulate immune function and cytokine levels in infectious diseases or chronic inflammation.
