    "abstractText": "Alkaline-earth metal oxides, in particular MgO and CaO dominate Earth\u2019s lower mantle, therefore, exploring high pressure behavior of this class of compounds is of significant geophysical research interest. Among the alkaline-earth metal oxides, BaO exhibits rich polymorphism in the pressure range of 0-1.5 Mbar. Static enthalpy calculations revealed that BaO undergoes a pressure induced structural phase transition from NaCl-type (B1) \u2192 NiAs-type (B8) \u2192 distorted CsCl-type (d-B2) \u2192 CsCl-type (B2) at 5.1, 19.5, 120 GPa respectively. B1 \u2192 B8 & B8 \u2192 d-B2 transitions are found to be first order in nature whereas d-B2\u2192 B2 is a second order or weak first order phase transition with displacive nature. Interestingly, d-B2 phase shows stability over a wide pressure range of \u223c19.5-113 GPa. Mechanical and dynamical stabilities of ambient and high pressure phases are demonstrated through the computed second order elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves, respectively. Under high pressure, significant phonon softening and soft phonon mode along M-direction are observed for B8, d-B2 and B2 phases, respectively. Pressure dependent Raman spectra suggests a phase transition from d-B2 to Raman inactive phase under high pressure. Overall, the present study provides a comprehensive understanding of lattice dynamics and underlying mechanisms behind pressure induced structural phase transitions in BaO.",

B1 \u2192 B8 & B8 \u2192 d-B2 transitions are found to be first order in nature whereas d-B2\u2192 B2 is a second order or weak first order phase transition with displacive nature. Interestingly, d-B2 phase shows stability over a wide pressure range of \u223c19.5-113 GPa. Mechanical and dynamical stabilities of ambient and high pressure phases are demonstrated through the computed second order elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves, respectively. Under high pressure, significant phonon softening and soft phonon mode along M-direction are observed for B8, d-B2 and B2 phases, respectively. Pressure dependent Raman spectra suggests a phase transition from d-B2 to Raman inactive phase under high pressure. Overall, the present study provides a comprehensive understanding of lattice dynamics and underlying mechanisms behind pressure induced structural phase transitions in BaO.\nKeywords:- High pressure, Phase transitions, Elastic constants, Lattice dynamics,\nPhonon softening, Lattice instability, Anharmonicity, Earth\u2019s interior"

            "text": "Alkaline-earth metal oxides, MO (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) have gained a considerable attention due to their technological applications in diverse fields,1\u20135 ranging from catalysis6\u20138 to electrode coating9 and interfaces.10 These metal oxides are suitable candidates for CO2 sorbent applications due to their high absorption capacity at moderate temperatures.3 Moreover, these mono-oxides are prime candidates for the Earth\u2019s interior, especially light metal oxides\n2\nsuch as MgO and CaO are abundant in the Earth\u2019s lower mantle, in which the pressure varies from 24 to 136 GPa from top of the upper mantle to the lower mantle.11\u201315 Therefore, exploring high pressure and/or temperature behavior of these metal oxides provides an insight on the deep interior of the Earth. These metal oxides crystallize in the rocksalt NaCl-type (B1) structure with space group Fm3\u0304m at ambient conditions. Upon compression, these metal oxides usually undergo a body centred cubic CsCl-type (B2) structure and it is well established for MgO, CaO and SrO. Amongst all these compounds, BaO has interesting structural properties and it exhibits a rich polymorphism in the pressure range of 0-1.5 Mbar over the remaining alkaline earth oxides, CaO,16\u201324 SrO.16\u201319,25\u201329 Therefore, understanding the high pressure structural and lattice dynamical behavior of BaO is crucial as this can be a possible candidate of the Earth\u2019s mantle.12 Several high pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements23,29\u201335 and theoretical studies using first principles calculations were focused on exploring the structural phase transitions,18,21,25,27,36\u201339 metallization,20,40\u201346 elastic properties,47\u201350 thermodynamic stability25,51,52 of MO (M =Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds under high pressure. Similarly, efforts have been put forward by the researchers to explore the phase diagram of BaO under high pressure from both experimental and theoretical perspective. A HP-XRD study30 revealed that BaO undergoes a structural transition from B1 to distorted B2 (d-B2) at 9.2 GPa and remains in the same structure till 29 GPa. Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction study31 disclosed that BaO transforms from B1 to an intermediate hexagonal NiAs-type (B8) structure at around 10 GPa, later to a tetragonal PH4I-type (d-B2) structure with pseudo 8-fold coordination at around 15 GPa and this phase approaches to B2 structure with increasing pressure above 1 Mbar. First principles studies17,53,54 reported that BaO transforms from B1 to B8 phase at 11.3 GPa,53 5 GPa,17 4.3 GPa54 then to d-B2 from B8 at 21.5 GPa,53 13 GPa,17 23.2 GPa,54 upon further compression, the d-B2 phase transforms to B2 phase at 62 GPa,53 50 GPa,17 108 GPa.54 Pandey et al49 and Jog et al55 suggested a direct B1 to B2 phase transition at 100 and 86 GPa, respectively without any intermediate high pressure phases.\n3\nOn the other hand, lattice dynamics of B1 phase is well studied at ambient as well as at high pressure using first principles calculations16,51,56,57 and inelastic neutron scattering technique.58 However, very limited studies52 are available exploring lattice dynamics of high pressure phases, underlying mechanisms behind the observed structural phase transitions and spectroscopic properties under high pressure in BaO. Therefore, in the present study, we have systematically investigated the structural phase transitions, lattice dynamics of different polymorphs and Raman spectra of B8 and d-B2 phases of BaO under high pressure."

            "text": "Crystal structure and pressure-induced structural phase transitions\nAs shown in Figure 1a, BaO crystallizes in the face centred cubic (SG: Fm3\u0304m) rocksalt NaCl-type (B1) structure with 6-fold coordination and having Z = 4 formula units (f.u.) per unit cell at ambient conditions.31 High pressure X-ray diffraction measurements30,31,64 revealed that BaO exhibits rich polymorphism under high pressure. BaO undergoes to a high pressure NiAs-type (B8) structure (SG: P63/mmc) from B1 phase at 9.2 GPa without changing the coordination number (CN) by having Z = 2 f.u. per primitive cell. The crystal structure of B8 phase is an hexagonal analog of the B1 structure. Later, the B8 phase transforms to PH4-type distorted CsCl-type (d-B2) at 14.0 GPa, 30 18 GPa30 with pseudo 8-fold coordination (SG: P4/nmm) with Z = 2 f.u. per primitive cell, and then to a 8-fold coordinated CsCl-type (B2) structure (SG: Pm3\u0304m) with Z = 1 f.u. per primitive cell upon further compression i.e., above 1 Mbar pressure (see Figure 1 and Table 1).30,31,64 The crystal structure of d-B2 phase is analogous to PbO-type structure without a lone-pair at Ba atom having two in-equivalent bond lengths as shown in Figure 1c. To get further insights on the observed structural phase transitions and their sequence, as a first step, we have tested with various DFT functionals such as LDA, PBE, PW91 and SCAN to reproduce the B1 to B8 transition pressure (see Figure S1). The transition pressure obtained using PBE, PW91 and SCAN functionals are consistent with each other while LDA poorly describe the phase stability between B1 and B8 phases. Later, we carried out static enthalpy calculations with PBE functional for the polymorphic phases of BaO and plotted enthalpy difference with respect to B2 phase as a function of pressure as shown in Figure 2a. The obtained phase transition sequence is B1 \u2192 B8 \u2192 d-B2 \u2192 B2 and the corresponding transition pressures 5.1, 19.5, 120 GPa are in good agreement with the HP-XRD measurements30,31 as well as with previous first principles calculations.52,53 Moreover, TlI-type (B33) phase is found to be meta-stable for CaO65 and we also have included this B33 phase in the phase diagram\n5\nof BaO to verify it\u2019s relative phase stability w.r.t high pressure phases of BaO and then we found that the B33 phase is also meta-stable for BaO over the maximum studied pressure range (see Figure 2a). As presented in Figure 2b, the enthalphy difference between d-B2 and B2 phases is continuously decreasing with increasing pressure and they become iso-enthalpic at around 120 GPa. As shown in Figure 2c, the calculated lattice constants for the ambient and high pressure phases are monotonically decreasing with pressure. The lattice constant \u2019c\u2019 of d-B2 phase becomes lattice constant \u2019a\u2019 for B2 phase (cd\u2212B2 = aB2). The detailed transition mechanism for d-B2 to B2 transition is explained through elastic constants in the following section. As shown in Figure 2d, the calculated volume decreases monotonically with pressure. We observe a volume collapse during the phase transition from B1 \u2192 B8 is \u223c 3.65 % at 5.1 GPa and it is \u223c 6.4 % at 19.5 GPa for the transition B8 \u2192 d-B2. The obtained volume reduction is consistent with high pressure X-diffraction measurements and previous first principles calculations as presented in Table 2. This clearly demonstrates that B1 to B8 & B8 to d-B2 transitions are first order in nature, while d-B2 to B2 transition is a second order or weak first order in nature due to continuous change in volume during the phase transition (see Figure 2d). We then calculated the equilibrium bulk modulus (B0) and its pressure derivative (B0\u2019) by fitting the obtained pressure-volume (P-V) data to 3 rd order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state,66 B0 measures the ability of a material to resist changes in volume under hydrostatic expansion or compression. The calculated B0 value is found to be 71.4 GPa for the ambient B1 phase, which is in good agreement with previous first principles calculations.67 The obtained relatively low B0 values 68.8 GPa for B8 and 51.8 for d-B2 intermediate phases suggest the soft nature of these phases over ambient B1 (71.4 GPa) and a high B0 value 92.4 GPa for high pressure B2 phase disclose that B2 phase is harder than B1 phase (see Table 3).\nIn addition, the calculated in-equivalent bond lengths are plotted as a function of pressure and the same are presented in Figure 2e. The in-equivalent bond lengths of d-B2 phase are found to converge to became a single bond length for B2 phase above 120 GPa. In addition,\n6\nin the d-B2 phase, the Ba atoms are located at (0.5, 0.0, 0.5+\u2206) and (0.0, 0.5, 0.5-\u2206), where \u2206 is the atomic position parameter, \u2206 in combination axial ratio (c/a) provides a useful information on d-B2 \u2192 B2 transition. If \u2206 = 0 & c/a = 1/ \u221a 2 = 0.7071, then the structure is of undistorted B2 phase.31 To confirm this, we have calculated c/a ratio and \u2206 as a function of pressure for d-B2 phase. As shown in Figure 2f, both c/a ratio and \u2206 are decreasing with pressure and then approaches to \u2206 = 0 & c/a = 0.7071 around 120 GPa. The continuous volume change at the transition pressure, variation in the fractional coordinate of Ba atom along c-direction (see Figure S2), c/a = 0.7071 and \u2206 = 0 values clearly demonstrate that d-B2 to B2 transition to be a displacive transition under pressure. Displacive nature of zBa with pressure suggests phonon softening in d-B2 phase as function of pressure. Further to explore the microscopic origin of the continuous phase transition in BaO, pressure dependent elastic constants, lattice dynamics and Raman spectra are calculated and analyzed them in detail in the following sections.\nElastic constants under high pressure\nTo get deeper insight on the structural phase transition(s) and verify mechanical stability of the BaO polymorphs, we have calculated second order elastic constants (Cij) as a function of pressure for all the four B1, B8, d-B2 and B2 phases. The cubic (Fm3\u0304m, Pm3\u0304m), hexagonal (P63/mmc) and tetragonal (P4/nmm) crystal symmetries possess 3, 5 and 6 independent elastic constants.\nWhen a finite hydrostatic pressure is applied to a crystal system, the Born stability criteria68 at ambient conditions must be revised with modified elastic constants at a given hydrostatic pressure conditions. According to Sinko and Smirnov the modified elastic constants at a given pressure (P) are C\u0303ii = Cii - P, (for i = 1-6) and C\u03031j = C1j + P (for j = 2-3) for cubic and hexagonal/tetragonal systems. Therefore, the modified Born stability criteria under hydrostatic pressure for cubic (equation 1) and hexagonal/tetragonal (equation 2) are\n7\ngiven as follows:\nC11 \u2212 C12 \u2212 2P > 0, C11 + 2C12 + P > 0, C44 \u2212 P > 0 (1)\nC11 \u2212 C12 \u2212 2P > 0,\nP 2 + P (C11 + C12 + 4C13) + 2C 2 13 \u2212 C33(C11 + C12) > 0,\nC44 \u2212 P > 0, C66 \u2212 P > 0\n(2)\nThe calculated pressure dependent Cij for B1, B8, d-B2 and B2 phases satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for the revised Born stability criteria under hydrostatic pressure indicating that the polymoprhs are mechanically stable at the corresponding pressures. We shed more light on understanding lattice transformation from d-B2 to B2 phase through the computed pressure dependent elastic constants of d-B2 and B2 phases. The relationships between lattice constants of d-B2 and B2 phases at the phase transition are given as follows: (a=b)d\u2212B2 = \u221a 2cd\u2212B2 and cd\u2212B2 = aB2 (see Figure 3a), thus, results in merging of the following elastic constants of d-B2 to B2 phase under pressure are as depicted in Figure 3 as given below: Cd\u2212B233 \u2192 CB211 , Cd\u2212B244 \u2192 CB244 and Cd\u2212B213 \u2192 CB212 , which corroborates with pressure dependent structural and bond parameters at the d-B2 \u2192 B2 transition.\nLattice dynamics and Raman spectra under high pres-\nsure\nTo compliment the structural stability obtained from total energy calculations and verify dynamical stability of the ambient and high pressure phases of BaO, we calculated phonon dispersion curves including LO-TO splitting at 0 and 9 GPa for B1 phase (see Figure 4a & b) at 9 GPa and 20 GPa for B8 phase (see Figure 4c & d), at 30, 60, 90 and 120 GPa for d-B2 phase (see Figure 5) and finally at 100, 110, 120 and 140 GPa for B2 phase (see Figure 6). As shown in Figure 4a & b, B1 and B8 phases are dynamically stable at 0, 9 GPa and 9, 20 GPa\n8\nrespectively. The phonon dispersion curves of B1 phase show large LO-TO splitting (\u223c 312.3 cm\u22121) along \u0393-direction with two degenerate TO and one LO modes and this large LO-TO splitting causes a fall of low lying optical (LLO) phonon modes into acoustic mode region, which can increase overlap between acoustic and LLO phonon modes there by enhancing the scattering phase space and eventually this leads to lower the lattice thermal conductivity in B1 phase at ambient conditions.69 However, the LO-TO splitting decreases under pressure (see Figure 4a & b) for B1 phase. Moreover, the optical phonon modes are hardening with pressure while phonon softening is observed for acoustic phonon modes along X-direction in B1 phase and along M and K-\u0393 directions in B8 phase. Phonon softening is observed along X-direction for B1 phase previously,52 which actually drives the transition from B1 \u2192 B8 phase in BaO under pressure. In addition, the B1 and B8 phases are dynamically stable above the transition pressures, which are in consistent with the first order nature of the structural phase transitions, B1 \u2192 B8 & B8 \u2192 d-B2. The d-B2 phase is found to be dynamically stable over a wide pressure range of \u223c 20-120 GPa (see Figure 5) for BaO in contrast to the light alkaline-earth metal oxides, MgO, CaO and SrO. The calculated phonon dispersion curves show a significant phonon softening at 120 GPa along Z-\u0393 and \u2019A\u2019 high symmetry directions as depicted in Figure 5d. On the other hand, the calculated phonon dispersion curves for B2 phase at 100 and 110 GPa show soft phonon mode along M high symmetry point, which clearly indicates that B2 is unstable below 110 GPa pressure. In addition, we could also observe a significant phonon softening of TO and LO modes of B2 phase at 140 GPa (see Figure 6d) compared to 120 GPa (see Figure 6b), which indicates that B2 phase becomes dynamically unstable and it may undergo a structural phase transition upon further compression above 150 GPa.\nThe cubic ambient B1 and high pressure B2 phases of BaO are Raman inactive, and they have only one IR active (T1u) mode. However, the intermediate high pressure B8 and d-B2 phases are Raman active, and are thoroughly analyzed (see Figure 7). This result is in very good agreement with the Raman spectroscopic measurements,70 which show that BaO\n9\nis Raman inactive until 10 GPa (B1 phase) and above 11 GPa it becomes Raman active (B8), where one Raman active E2g mode is observed and this Raman mode shows blue-shift with increasing pressure. Later, significant changes are observed in the Raman spectra at around 14 GPa and it indicates a transition from B8 to to d-B2 phase. The similar trends are observed in the present work with deviations in the transition pressures which might be due to Raman measurements were carried out at 300 K, while the calculations are performed at 0 K. Since, B8 and d-B2 phases crystallize in P63/mmc and P4/nmm space groups, respectively and they consist of four atoms per primitive cell, the symmetry decomposition of group theory predicts 12 vibrational modes along \u0393 for both of these phases, which are given as follows:\n\u0393B812 = 2E2g \u2295 B2g \u2295 4E1u \u2295 2E2u \u2295 2A2u \u2295 B1u\nAmong the 12 vibrational modes of B8 phase, only E2g is Raman active mode which is consistent with high pressure Raman measurements,70 E1u, E2u, A2u and B1u are IR active modes but B2g is neither Raman nor IR active (silent) mode; where E1u, E2u and E2g are doubly degenerate modes. Variation of E2g mode as a function of pressure is shown in Figure 7a, which is mainly due to in-plane vibrational motion of Ba atom and its intensity decreases with pressure.\n\u0393d\u2212B212 = 4Eg \u2295 B2g \u2295 A1g \u2295 4Eu \u2295 2A2u\nOn the other hand, for Litharge PbO-type d-B2 phase, the zone-center Raman active modes B2g, A1g and Eg are polarized along c- and a/b-axis, respectively. Eu and A2u are IR active modes; where Eu and Eg modes are doubly degenerate. Pressure dependence of vibrational frequency modes are presented in Figure 7d. For each vibrational mode, frequency increases with pressure except for A1g mode. When the pressure is applied, the interatomic distance becomes smaller and hence interaction between neighboring atoms becomes stronger. Therefore, usually, the vibrational modes increase with pressure as shown in Figure 7b & d except for A1g mode. As Eg mode is in plane vibrational mode, the vibrational fre-\n10\nquency/wavenumber increases as the interaction of atoms becomes stronger. As shown in Figure 2f; c/a ratio decreases with increasing pressure. Due to the out-of-plane vibrations of heavier Ba atoms in A1g mode (Figure 7c), the decrease in the wavenumber of Raman-shift is observed with pressure. The red-shift of the A1g mode with pressure shows a negative pressure coefficient and it might be responsible for introducing dynamical instability at higher pressure in the d-B2 phase. In contrast, this mode was tentatively assigned as Eg mode due to in-plane vibration of Ba atoms in the HP-Raman study.70 However, we thoroughly analyzed and assigned it as A1g mode rather than Eg mode, which actually shows phonon softening with pressure which is associated with displacive nature of Ba atoms along c-axis. The Intensity of four Raman active modes (Eg, B2g and A1g) are gradually diminishing with pressure (Figure 7b) for d-B2 phase, this strongly suggests that high pressure phase might be Raman inactive. Finally, the high pressure B2 phase can be stabilized above 113 GPa (see Figure 7e) which is consistent with the observations from the HP-XRD measurements.31\nAs shown in Figure S3 & 6, the calculated room temperature phonon dispersion curves in combination with AIMD and TDEP disclose that B2 phase is dynamically unstable at 80 GPa and 300 K whereas it becomes dynamically stable at 100 GPa and 300 K, while harmonic lattice dynamical calculations show that B2 phase is dynamically unstable below \u223c 113 GPa. This clearly shows the importance of anharmonicity to determine the stability of B2 phase above 85 GPa and this is in good accord with the HP-XRD diffraction measurements.31"

Mechanical stability has been established for ambient and high pressure phases of BaO through computed elastic constants. The pressure dependent elastic constants provide an insight on lattice transformation from d-B2 to B2 phase. The calculated phonon dispersion curves indicate the dynamical stability of BaO polymorphs and a significant phonon softening is observed for B8 and d-B2 phases at high pressures and also a soft phonon mode (along M-direction) in B2 phase explained its dynamical instability below 110 GPa. Finally, gradual diminishing of Raman active modes of d-B2 phase under pressure suggests that high pressure phase could be a Raman inactive. Overall, the present study provides an in depth understanding of structural phase transitions in BaO under high pressure and further exploration of high pressure behavior of light alkaline-earth oxides (MgO, CaO and SrO) have important implications on composition of the Earth\u2019s lower mantle."
