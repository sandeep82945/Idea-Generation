The WALK\u2010Copenhagen project (WALK\u2010Cph) is aimed at promoting a 24\u2010h mobility among older medical patients during hospitalization. The WALK\u2010Cph interven\u2010 tion was co\u2010designed by researchers and stakeholders to tailor the intervention to the clinical context. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and implementation fidelity of the WALK\u2010Cph intervention before evaluating clinical effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03825497). Methods: The WALK\u2010Cph intervention consisted of six components: a welcome folder explaining the importance of in\u2010hospital activity, a WALK\u2010plan prescribing up to three daily walking sessions during and after hospitalization, a WALK\u2010path in the hallway that patients were motivated to use daily, exercise posters in the hallways and bedrooms, self\u2010service on beverages and clothes, and discharge with a WALK\u2010plan. The present study reports on phase 2 of WALK\u2010Cph and consists of a feasibility and a fidelity component. The study was conducted at the two WALK\u2010Cph intervention departments after the initiation of the WALK\u2010Cph intervention. A cohort of older medical patients (+65) was recruited for the feasibility study to assess recruitment and data collection procedures and the method for assess\u2010 ment of activity. Simultaneously, implementation fidelity was assessed by observing clinical practice and intervention delivery at the intervention departments. Results: A feasibility cohort of 48 patients was included. Inclusion was considered feasible with recruitment rates between 62% and 70% of all eligible patients. Also, data collection was conducted without obstacles, and all patients accepted to wear activity monitors. The fidelity observations showed that three of the six intervention components were partially implemented as planned whereas three components were not implemented as planned. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2022) 8:80 Key messages regarding feasibility and fidelity \u2022 We evaluated uncertainties in recruitment, data collection procedures, and the method for assessment of activity (i.e., activPAL accelerometers) as well as the implementation fidelity of the intervention. \u2022 The key feasibility and fidelity findings of the study are that data collection procedures were conducted without obstacles for all included patients, and all patients accepted to wear the activPAL accelerometers. Regarding implementation fidelity, half of the intervention components, including the core components, were satisfactorily implemented. \u2022 Based on the findings, it was decided to test the intervention in a large-scale trial. Background Older adults who are hospitalized for medical illness often spend most of their time in bed being physically inactive [1\u20134]. This inactivity is associated with loss of independence, functional decline [2, 5\u20137], re-hospitalization, and death [2]. It appears that walking more than 900 steps per day during hospitalization is critical for the preservation of functioning [8]. Despite years of research, however, hospital-associated functional decline and mobility limitations remain a common challenge [9, 10]. Walking during hospitalization has proven effective in promoting mobility, reducing the length of stay and assuring discharge to own home [11]. Also, interventions promoting mobility among older adults during hospitalization [12\u201314], and exercise-based interventions initiated during hospitalization and continued after discharge [15], have shown promising results in preventing hospital-associated functional decline and in promoting functional ability [12, 13, 15], as well as in maintaining prehospitalization mobility [14]. However, perceived complexity (e.g., by health care professionals) of interventions and barriers in the local clinical context can complicate or hinder the implementation of such interventions [16, 17]. Several barriers to physical activity during hospitalization have been identified [16, 18\u201322]. These include lack of staff to assist with or encourage mobility [18, 19, 22], illness symptoms [18], fear of falls [18, 19], and a discouraging hospital environment [21]. To circumvent barriers to the implementation of mobility-promoting interventions, it has been suggested to engage stakeholders in the design of interventions [23] and to tailor the interventions to stakeholder perspectives and to the local clinical context [24, 25]. However, only a few studies have accounted for these recommendations [26\u201328] by adapting mobility interventions to the local context and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions. While studies of intervention efficacy in controlled settings may be useful for establishing the potential effectiveness of an intervention, fidelity of implementing such interventions in clinical settings can be challenged by external factors in hectic settings such as hospital wards [29]. Therefore, before undertaking large-scale evaluations of a co-designed complex intervention, it is recommended to investigate both the feasibility of the intervention (e.g., of the recruitment and assessment procedures) and the fidelity with which this intervention is implemented (i.e., if the intervention is delivered as intended) [29\u201331]. Investigating feasibility and implementation fidelity of an intervention can yield crucial insights into why a given intervention fails or works and how it may be improved [30]. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the feasibility and implementation fidelity of a mobility intervention in older medical inpatients before testing the effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and implementation fidelity of the WALK-Cph intervention before initiating a large-scale trial to investigate clinical effectiveness [32]. The WALK-Cph intervention was tailored to the local clinical context [25] and developed in a co-design process that involved stakeholders (i.e., health care professionals, patients and relatives) to facilitate implementation [33]. Methods As stated by Abbott JH [34], \u201ca feasibility study is a preliminary study conducted specifically for the purpose of establishing whether or not a full trial will be feasible to conduct.\u201d In this study, feasibility is based on the feasibility of recruitment and assessment procedures. Implementation fidelity is defined as \u201cthe degree to which Conclusion: The WALK\u2010Cph intervention was found feasible, and although the intervention was not implemented with fidelity, the level of fidelity was considered sufficient to continue with further testing of the WALK\u2010Cph interven\u2010 tion in a large\u2010scale trial.

The present study reports on phase 2 of WALK\u2011Cph and consists of a feasibility and a fidelity component. The study was conducted at the two WALK\u2011Cph intervention departments after the initiation of the WALK\u2011Cph intervention. A cohort of older medical patients (+65) was recruited for the feasibility study to assess recruitment and data collection procedures and the method for assess\u2011 ment of activity. Simultaneously, implementation fidelity was assessed by observing clinical practice and intervention delivery at the intervention departments.\nResults: A feasibility cohort of 48 patients was included. Inclusion was considered feasible with recruitment rates between 62% and 70% of all eligible patients. Also, data collection was conducted without obstacles, and all patients accepted to wear activity monitors. The fidelity observations showed that three of the six intervention components were partially implemented as planned whereas three components were not implemented as planned.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Older adults who are hospitalized for medical illness often spend most of their time in bed being physically inactive [1\u20134]. This inactivity is associated with loss of independence, functional decline [2, 5\u20137], re-hospitalization, and death [2]. It appears that walking more than 900 steps per day during hospitalization is critical for the preservation of functioning [8]. Despite years of research, however, hospital-associated functional decline and mobility limitations remain a common challenge [9, 10].\nWalking during hospitalization has proven effective in promoting mobility, reducing the length of stay and assuring discharge to own home [11]. Also, interventions promoting mobility among older adults during hospitalization [12\u201314], and exercise-based interventions initiated during hospitalization and continued after discharge [15], have shown promising results in preventing hospital-associated functional decline and in promoting functional ability [12, 13, 15], as well as in maintaining prehospitalization mobility [14]. However, perceived complexity (e.g., by health care professionals) of interventions and barriers in the local clinical context can complicate or hinder the implementation of such interventions [16, 17]. Several barriers to physical activity during hospitalization have been identified [16, 18\u201322]. These include lack of staff to assist with or encourage mobility [18, 19,\n22], illness symptoms [18], fear of falls [18, 19], and a discouraging hospital environment [21].\nTo circumvent barriers to the implementation of mobility-promoting interventions, it has been suggested to engage stakeholders in the design of interventions [23] and to tailor the interventions to stakeholder perspectives and to the local clinical context [24, 25]. However, only a few studies have accounted for these recommendations [26\u201328] by adapting mobility interventions to the local context and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions. While studies of intervention efficacy in controlled settings may be useful for establishing the potential effectiveness of an intervention, fidelity of implementing such interventions in clinical settings can be challenged by external factors in hectic settings such as hospital wards [29]. Therefore, before undertaking large-scale evaluations of a co-designed complex intervention, it is recommended to investigate both the feasibility of the intervention (e.g., of the recruitment and assessment procedures) and the fidelity with which this intervention is implemented (i.e., if the intervention is delivered as intended) [29\u201331]. Investigating feasibility and implementation fidelity of an intervention can yield crucial insights into why a given intervention fails or works and how it may be improved [30].\nTo our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the feasibility and implementation fidelity of a mobility intervention in older medical inpatients before testing the effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and implementation fidelity of the WALK-Cph intervention before initiating a large-scale trial to investigate clinical effectiveness [32]. The WALK-Cph intervention was tailored to the local clinical context [25] and developed in a co-design process that involved stakeholders (i.e., health care professionals, patients and relatives) to facilitate implementation [33]."

The project is inspired by a hybrid 2 design [37, 38] with parallel testing of an intervention to promote 24-h mobility and a plan for implementation of\nthe intervention. It is organized in four phases combining quantitative and qualitative methods (Table\u00a01).\nThe design of the WALK-Cph project has been described by Kirk et\u00a0al. in the study protocol [36]. Briefly, to provide some context, in phase 1, four medical departments at hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark were included in WALK-Cph and block-randomized to two intervention and two control departments. A baseline cohort study was performed to collect data on daily mobility among older medical patients hospitalized at the four departments, and a baseline field study was performed to investigate the social context and practice related to patients\u2019 mobility in the four departments [16]. Hereafter, at co-design workshops, stakeholders (health care professionals, patients, relatives, and researchers) from the two intervention departments (Departments X and Y) collaborated on designing the WALK-Cph intervention and the WALK-Cph implementation plan. Subsequently, implementation of the WALK-Cph intervention was initiated in Departments X and Y and the feasibility and implementation fidelity of the intervention were evaluated simultaneously (Table\u00a0 1, phase 2). The present study reports on data from both components of this phase concerning trial procedure feasibility [34, 39, 40] and implementation fidelity of the WALK-Cph intervention in the two intervention departments, to decide on the suitability of the intervention for effectiveness testing (phase 3). Also, data from the baseline studies will be presented for comparison. The two components, which constitute the present study, will be referred to as \u201cthe feasibility study\u201d and \u201cthe fidelity study\u201d throughout.

The study was performed from September 2018 to March 2019 (Table\u00a01).\nParticipants and recruitment We included older medical patients (+65) admitted from their home to one of the two intervention departments. Patients were excluded on the following criteria: inability to walk independently with or without walking aids, inability to speak and understand Danish, inability to cooperate, transferal to another department or another hospital, terminal illness, ongoing cancer treatment, isolation room-stay, or referral to nursery home. During all three feasibility periods, patients were recruited on all weekdays. Recruitment of patients was performed by two investigators from the research team (BSP and MMP) and two research assistants (BJ and RB), who also undertook inclusion during phase 3. Through a daily review of medical records, eligible patients were identified and hereafter contacted by one of the investigators. Patients who gave oral and written informed consent underwent an interview and mobility assessments.\nOutcomes The assessed outcomes were feasibility of recruitment procedure (percentage of eligible patients willing to participate), the feasibility of assessment procedures (percentage able to participate in assessments), the feasibility of the method for assessment of primary outcome for randomized controlled trial (percentage of included patients willing to wear activPAL3TM accelerometers), and level and variability in 24-h mobility. Based on a previous feasibility study in our hospital [41], we applied the following criteria for feasibility: (1) 50% of all eligible patients should participate and (2) all included patients except a maximum of 2 patients should participate in the assessments and wear the accelerometers.\nData collection At inclusion, all included patients underwent a structured interview to collect information on place of residence, marital status, level of education, pain, use of municipal help, walking aids, number of falls within the past 12 months, level of physical activity (PA), mobility status, activities of daily living (ADL), and cognitive status. Also, daily mobility, the primary outcome for the following randomized controlled trial (phase 3), was assessed. The \u201cSaltin-Grimby Physical Activity level Scale\u201d [42\u201344] was used to assess the level of physical activity, the De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) [45, 46] and The Life-Space Assessment (LSA) [47\u201349] to measure mobility status, the Barthel Index 20 [50] to quantify ADL, and the Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration test (OMC) [51] to assess cognitive status. The activPAL3TM accelerometer was used to assess mobility\nthrough the following outcomes: uptime (i.e., time spent walking and standing), time spent lying, and number of steps. All assessments were performed on admission and the activPAL3TM activity monitor was worn for the following 48 h during hospitalization. The activPAL3TM is valid and reliable in measuring postures in mobilityimpaired older people [52, 53] and in measuring walking at gait speeds between 0.67 m/s and 1.56 m/s [54, 55].\nSample size No formal sample size estimation was made since this was a feasibility study where no effectiveness testing was planned and performed [34, 39]. Approaches to sample size justification for pilot and feasibility trials vary. We aimed for a target sample size of 16 patients for each feasibility period (taking a dropout rate of 25% into account), based on Julious [56], who recommends 12 participants per group as a rule of thumb for pilot studies.\nData analysis Recruitment rates (i.e., percentage of eligible patients willing to participate), patient characteristics, and results on 24-h mobility are presented as descriptive data given as medians with interquartile ranges, means with standard deviations or percentages depending on variable types. Recruitment rates, patient characteristics, and results on 24-h mobility are presented separately for each department and feasibility period. SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses, and all analyses were performed by BSP and MMP. The reporting of this study follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for pilot and feasibility trials with simple adaptations as recommended by Lancaster and Thabane [57]."

            "heading": "The fidelity study",
            "text": "Procedures To examine the implementation fidelity of the WALK-Cph intervention, a fidelity study performed as an ethnographic study [58] was carried out at the two intervention departments at the same time as the feasibility study, from September 2018 to March 2019 (Table\u00a01). The study was carried out as participant observations of daily practice at the two intervention departments [59]. The observations focused on gathering information about the daily practice concerning the WALK-Cph intervention components that were related to hospitalization (Additional file\u00a0 1). No observational data were collected on WALK-Cph intervention components to be performed after discharge (i.e., WALK-plan after discharge). Information on this component was collected through patient records.\nData collection Data were collected through observations conducted at the two intervention departments during the feasibility periods using a focused observation strategy [60]. The observations followed an observation guide (Table\u00a02) inspired by Hasson\u2019s [61, 62] modification of Carroll\u2019s Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity [63] and was based on the components of the WALK-Cph intervention. All observers were instructed to follow the observation guide and be especially observant towards components of the framework that could be evaluated through observations: adherence (content, frequency, dose), quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and context [61\u201363]. Adherence was defined as \u201chow far those responsible for delivering an intervention actually adhere to the intervention as it is outlined by its designers\u201d [63] and related to the delivery of the intended content and dose of the intervention [62, 63]. According to Carroll, adherence is the essential component of implementation fidelity. Obtainment of full adherence can be moderated by factors such as the quality of delivery, participants\u2019 responsiveness [62, 63], and context [61]. The quality of delivery \u201cconcerns whether an intervention is delivered in a way appropriate to achieving what was intended\u201d [63] and relates to the quality in delivering the intervention components [62]. Participant responsiveness refers to the engagement of those responsible for delivering the intervention and how they perceive the relevance of the intervention [62, 63]. Context refers to \u201cfactors at political, economical, organizational, and workgroup levels that affect the implementation\u201d [62]. The observers could note observations that were not related to the components in the guide if something was deemed interesting or relevant. Observations were carried out as participant observations of the work\npractices in the departments. Thus, all involved staff and hospitalized patients could be observed as well as their mutual interaction, as this was expected to affect the delivery of the intervention. For example, such an interaction was observed when a health care assistant told a physician, \u201cwe need to give a WALK-plan to patient X.\u201d The observer noted how staff and patients acted in relation to the different intervention components. Observations were carried out on weekdays and covered both day and evening shifts in a randomized order. Each session lasted 2\u20134 h and consisted of the following staff around the department, following physicians around the department, observing in the hallway, and observing in the staff office. All observers were instructed to ask for permission before following a given health care professional and to leave a room or situation if staying felt disturbing or unethical. During the three periods, observations were performed by BSP, JWK, BMG, NTS, RB, MMP, and three research assistants (5 physiotherapists, 2 nurses, 1 medical student, and 1 anthropologist). We chose to use observers with different professional backgrounds to add multidisciplinary breadth to the observations [64]. We used several observers because focused observation can be exhausting and requires full concentration. Field notes were written during and immediately after the observations.\nData analysis Field notes from the fidelity study consisted of 222 pages from the three fidelity periods. The fidelity analysis was performed by BSP, JWK, and BMG. The field notes were read, re-read, and coded in a deductive process structured after Hasson\u2019s [62] modified version of The Conceptual Framework for Implementation Fidelity [63]. All field notes were read individually by all three authors, and the text was coded according to the fidelity components (i.e., adherence, quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and context). Hereafter, the codes were discussed between the authors until agreement on coding was obtained. For example, when WALK-plans and level of WALK-plans were discussed between different members of the staff, this was coded as \u201cadherence.\u201d After ended coding, five authors (BSP, JWK, RB, NTS, and MMP) carried out consensus discussions to determine an estimated level of fidelity for each of the intervention components. This level of fidelity was based on the five authors\u2019 estimation of the degree of delivery based on the adherence component [63] (content, frequency, dose) throughout all observations: (1) \u201cnot delivered as planned,\u201d if the three authors agreed that the overall delivery of the component was considered at the <30% level of the intended delivery (e.g., if two observations show patients collecting clothes and 8 observations show staff collecting clothes); (2) \u201cpartly delivered\nas planned,\u201d if the three authors agreed that the overall delivery of the component was considered at the 30\u201360% level of the intended delivery; (3) \u201cdelivered as planned,\u201d if the three authors agreed that the overall delivery of the component was considered at the >60% level of the intended delivery.\nAs part of co-designing the WALK-Cph intervention, the research team scored the feasibility of all possible intervention components [36] informed by the Delphi method [65] and rated each component on its ability to enhance the likelihood of mobility on a 1 (yes) to 5 (no) scale. The WALK-plan and the WALK-path were rated as highly able to enhance mobility (score of 1), the welcome folder as moderately able to enhance mobility (score of 2) and the posters, and the self-service and discharge with a WALK-plan as neutral (score of 3). Based on these ratings, the WALK-plan and the WALK-path were considered core components. Therefore, it was decided that these two components needed to be at least partly delivered as planned during phase 2 for the intervention to be sufficiently implemented to be carried forward. This was a pragmatic choice based on an awareness that full implementation cannot be obtained within a month, but likely requires 6 to 12 months [66] and that fidelity of complex interventions is not straightforward and may change over time [30]."

With regard to feasibility, the recruitment procedures, assessment procedures, and the method for assessment of 24-h mobility were all found to be feasible. Concerning fidelity, we observed that three of the five WALK-Cph intervention components were only partly implemented as planned during the fidelity periods (the WALK-plans, the WALK-path, and self-service\non beverages) and none of the components was implemented as planned.\nThe inclusion of patients from the two intervention departments was successful. During the three 4-week feasibility periods, two thirds of the eligible patients were willing to participate. This level of recruitment is similar to previous cohort studies of older medical patients conducted in our research unit [1, 41]. All included patients completed the assessments and accepted to wear the activPAL3TM activity monitors. Therefore, based on the feasibility results, it was concluded that further evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial could be carried out.\nThe activity assessment showed that the patients were inactive for approximately 22 h per day despite being able to walk without help. Similar inactivity levels have been found in previous studies in older hospitalized patients across countries and health care systems [1, 3, 4]. This finding underlines the relevance of supporting the full implementation of projects like WALK-Cph [36] to achieve increased mobility among older medical patients.\nRecently, recommendations for physical activity and sedentary behavior for older adults during hospitalization for an acute medical illness were published based on a DELPHI study [67]. The recommendations stressed the importance of acting with respect for individual patient capabilities, incorporating physical activity throughout daily care, sharing the responsibility, and involving patients and stakeholders to facilitate implementation. This view is supported by others in a recent scoping review [68] and meta-synthesis [69], both of which state that promotion of mobility in hospitalized older adults is a team effort and requires clarity around interprofessional responsibilities, as well as applying a systems approach that aligns patients\u2019 mobility expectations with those of caregivers [68, 69]. Also, according to Bowen et\u00a0 al. [40], it is important to understand\nTable 4 A 24\u2011h mobility assessed over 48 h in feasibility cohorts"

This also includes hospital management and backup support who are vital for successful implementation [70]. Despite the WALK-Cph intervention being co-designed, our observations confirmed that the intervention still lacked clarity with regard to interprofessional responsibilities and the responsibility for ensuring patient mobility [22].\nDuring the initial phase of implementing the WALKCph intervention, two of the five WALK-Cph intervention components to promote in-hospital mobility were not implemented as planned. Not all health care professionals assumed responsibility for promoting mobility. However, there were smaller groups of health care professionals at the two intervention departments who prescribed WALK-plans and motivated patients to be active and to use the WALK-path and self-service during hospitalization. These health care professionals may be viewed as innovators and early adopters as described in Rogers\u2019 diffusion of innovation theory [71\u201373], which suggests that such individuals adopt new ideas before they spread within a social system (e.g., a hospital department) and are adopted by the majority [71\u201373]. At this point, however, it is unknown whether the WALK-Cph intervention components will be adopted by all health care professionals at the two intervention departments [73]. Nevertheless, since three components were at least partly implemented as planned, and, specifically, the two core components were implemented partly as planned, it was decided to proceed with further investigation of the effectiveness and the implementation of the WALK-Cph intervention.\nAccording to Carroll [63] and Hasson [62], interventions described in detail are more likely to be implemented with high fidelity than interventions with vague descriptions. Detailed descriptions include more facilitation strategies to support the intervention deliverers (e.g., manuals, guidelines, training, and feedback), which may enhance, i.e., quality of delivery [62]. The WALKCph components were described in detail regarding the amount of physical activity. In some cases, responsibility for delivery of the components was described in more general terms, i.e., at professional levels without indicating main responsibilities (i.e., that all health care professionals are to motivate the patients to use the WALK-path). However, while the intervention was designed to be simple, it may have been perceived as complex by the health care professionals due to interacting components, different behaviors required by those delivering the intervention, and the interdisciplinary teamwork required [32, 74]. Perceived complexity is one of the attributes in Rogers\u2019 diffusion of innovation theory,\nwhich posits that innovations, e.g., new interventions, that have low perceived complexity are more likely to succeed [71]. Complex interventions have more possibility for variation in delivery, and thus, more risk of not being implemented as intended [62]. It is important to note that Rogers\u2019 attributes relate to subjective perceptions of various aspects of innovations. This means that some people may find a new intervention basic and simple, whereas others may consider the same intervention complex and challenging.\nThe WALK-Cph intervention was developed in a codesign process to engage stakeholders and to adapt the intervention to the local context. We hoped that this approach would increase the likelihood of successful implementation [75, 76]. However, we found limited implementation fidelity of the intervention because some components were not implemented. According to Boyd [77], the involvement and active participation of health care professionals is fundamental in co-design work. For various reasons, not all health care professionals in the departments participated in the co-design process. It seems likely that those who participated in the workshops were amongst the early adopters [71] and that the remaining health care professionals might need more time to recognize the utility and advantages of the intervention to fully endorse it. Implementing change, such as introducing a new intervention in a clinical setting, can generate different responses from the health care professionals who are expected to use or carry out the intervention [78]. Even though the WALK-Cph intervention was developed in a co-design process, the perception of the intervention differed between health care professionals, which is consistent with Rogers\u2019 perceptions of innovation attributes. It is the individuals\u2019 perceptions of the attributes of an innovation that affect its adoption, not the attributes classified \u201cobjectively\u201d by experts or researchers [71].\nOnly one physician participated in the workshops, which might imply a resistance toward the intervention. To investigate if this was the case, we carried out barrier screening interviews with physicians from the two intervention departments [22] and found that the physicians were reluctant to promote mobility, which included both patient-, context,- and professional factors. The physicians were aware of the necessity and relevance of focusing on in-hospital mobility but believed that nurses should be responsible for mobility. The physicians\u2019 involvement was brought into focus during the co-design workshops, as all groups of stakeholders emphasized the importance of physicians prescribing WALK-plans. The relevance of physicians\u2019 advice on physical activity in older adults is supported by studies reporting that older adults find physician advice important [79\u201381] and trust\nphysicians the most to deliver health information [82]. However, in our study, it was the physiotherapists and nurses who handed out WALK-plans to the patients and the prescription task. It was planned to be the physicians\u2019 responsibility but was changed to be carried out by other health care professionals. Historically, the roles of nurses and physicians differ, with nurses focusing on patient health and wellbeing and physicians being responsible for diagnoses and medical conditions [83]. These wellestablished professional roles may in some cases hinder cross-professional collaboration [84], making it difficult to successfully implement interventions such as the WALK-Cph intervention.\nWe carried out observations of the daily clinical practice based on the assumption that ethnography is inherently contextual, which emphasizes the importance of context in understanding events and meanings [58]. Ethnography describes what people say and do, and their relationship with others, and has proven useful for understanding collective and non-rational dimensions of organizations. Thus, observations provide a picture of the interplay between an intervention and the setting in which it is implemented [58]. We evaluated both the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial in the setting of interest [34] and the fidelity of the intervention over 4 weeks to ensure sufficient time to evaluate if delivery of the intervention adhered to the described intervention and, thus, provided a basis for the intervention to be effective [29]. Since the observations showed that the core components were implemented partly as planned, it was deemed relevant to carry on with efficacy testing of the intervention."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The study has some limitations to consider when interpreting the findings. Firstly, different implementation strategies can be used to support implementation such as guidelines, training, and feedback [62]. After designing the intervention, the departments had the sole responsibility for the implementation of the intervention and, thus, for strategies to enhance implementation. Secondly, during our observations and interviews with physicians from the two departments [22], it was clear that the departments were characterized by a busy schedule and it is therefore likely that putting aside resources to support the implementation of the intervention was not prioritized. Also, lack of time and resources may have overshadowed the observability of the benefits of the intervention, a factor believed to ease the adoption of an intervention [85]. Thirdly, we were not present continuously for 4 weeks and were therefore not able to get a complete picture of adherence and thus of implementation fidelity. However, it is rarely feasible to assess\nall features of implementation fidelity why a selection based on practical circumstances can be necessary [29]. Fourthly, feasibility was only assessed during hospitalization even though the following randomized controlled trial was designed for assessments on admission and 4 weeks after discharge. Therefore, we cannot conclude on the feasibility of conducting assessments in the patients\u2019 homes after discharge. In previous feasibility and randomized controlled trials, however, we have conducted athome assessments without major obstacles [41, 86], and we therefore considered the hospital setting most important for the present study."

The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (AHH\u20112016\u2011080, I\u2011Suite no.: 05078) and fol\u2011 lowed the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration (Code N, 1949). Partici\u2011 pants in the feasibility study were informed that participation was voluntary and that withdrawal was possible at any time without loss of their right to treatment. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients included in the feasibility study after provision of both oral and written information. Full anonymity was ascertained by allocating an ID number to each participant instead of using their names. In the fidelity study field notes, observed health care professionals were assigned a code instead of using their full names. Before conducting the observations, all staff were informed about the aim of the study and were assured that participation was voluntary. Since our pres\u2011 ence as observers of the daily practice was approved by the head and ward managers, written informed consent was not obtained from each health care professional before the study. However, each health care professional had the possibility of declining to be followed in their daily work or to answer clarify\u2011 ing questions. However, none of the staff chose to do so. During observation, we tried to take situational ethics into account by considering the context\u2019s specific circumstances, e.g., ensuring that we respected the patients\u2019 privacy and the health care professionals\u2019 need for room for actions [87].\nConsent for publication Not applicable.\nCompeting interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthor details 1 Department of Clinical Research, Copenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Ketteg\u00e5rd Alle 30, Hvidovre, 2650 Copenhagen, Denmark. 2 Department of Endocrinology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark. 3 National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark. 4 Department of Medical and Health Sci\u2011 ences, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. 5 The Emergency Department, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark. 6 Depart\u2011 ment of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. 7 Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark. 8 Department of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Research \u2011 Copenhagen (PMR\u2011C), Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre, Denmark.\nReceived: 22 March 2021 Accepted: 17 March 2022\nReferences 1.
