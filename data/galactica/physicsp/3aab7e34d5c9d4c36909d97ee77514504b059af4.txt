Tridepsides, as fully oxidized polyketides, have been known to exist in lichens for more than a century. Recent studies have showed that these possible defensive lichenochemicals possess various biological activities. Also, a candidate biosynthetic gene cluster was recently reported for gyrophoric acid (GA), an important tridepside. The present study focused on biosynthesis, natural sources, biological activities, and bioanalytical methods of tridepside molecules. Our survey shows that, so far, lichenic tridepsides have been reported from 37 families, 111 genera, and 526 species of lichen. Because many of their species contain tridepsides, the families Parmeliaceae, Lobariaceae, and Peltigeraceae can be considered critical lichenic sources of tridepsides. Furthermore, several species of Hypotrachyna in Parmeliaceae family showed lichenic tridepsides, suggesting that this genus is a viable source of tridepsides. This research also explored tridepsides from non-lichenic sources, such as non-lichenized fungi, lichenicolous fungi, endophytes, parasites, and liverworts, which offer substantial potential as biotechnological sources to produce tridepsides, which are produced in small amounts in lichen thalli. Two lichenic tridepsides have also been detected in non-lichenic sources: GA and tenuiorin (TE). Additionally, no significant correlation was found between tridepside biosynthesis and geographical distribution patterns for several potentially tridepside-producing lichens. We further showed that GA is the most studied tridepside with various reported biological activities, including anticancer, wound healing, photoprotection, anti-aging, antioxidant, cardiovascular effect, DNA interaction, anti-diabetes, anti-Alzheimer’s, anti-bacterial, and antifungal. Last but not least, this study provides an overview of some bioanalytical methods used to analyze tridepsides over the past few years. KEYWORDS

frontiersin.org01 1 conclusions and future perspectives Although lichens have been largely explored in respect of their chemical compounds in the past, many of these compounds have not yet been evaluated for their probable biological activities. Thus, in light of the increasing need for new pharmaceutical substances, researchers could comprehensively evaluate the biological activities of lichen secondary metabolites. Among the probable defensive products of lichen’s resistance mechanism are tridepsides. Several tridepsides, including lichenic and nonlichenic, have been reported to be biologically active. As the most thoroughly studied lichenic tridepside, GA exhibits antiproliferative activity and wound healing, photoprotection, antioxidant activity, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular, and DNA binding properties. Due to its efficacy at higher doses, it is not a potent antiproliferative and antioxidant compound. It has been demonstrated that TE has a possible anti-Alzheimer’s activity and that UA also has strong antioxidant properties. However, a better integration of genome mining and analytical chemistry is needed to remove the ambiguities discussed in this paper. This may entail a transition from traditional analytical techniques to more modern ones, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments. We showed that lichenic sources of tridepsides are not limited to a specific region or biome. Therefore, we did not find an association between species distribution and tridepside biosynthesis.

Furthermore, GA showed the highest distribution among a substantial number of lichen species (467 out of 526). Parmeliaceae, Lobariaceae, and Peltigeraceae proved to be important lichen families regarding lichenic sources. These families indicated the highest tridepside variation. Hypotrachyna was suggested as a potential source of tridepsides in addition to families since many species in this genus might contain different tridepsides. As a result of recent bioanalytical advances, some tridepsides have now been isolated from sources other than lichen, including pathogenic fungi, non-lichenized fungi, lichenicolous fungi, endophytic fungi, and liverworts, all of which might be considered biotechnologically valuable. There are also reports of GA and TE from sources other than lichens. Such findings call for further research regarding the distribution of lichenic substances because they are not consistent with the long-held view that most lichenic substances are exclusively produced by lichens. author contributions HN collected, analyzed, and interpreted the data, generated the figures and tables, and wrote the manuscript.
