This is made possible by projecting separate particles onto a maximally entangled basis. We investigate more general communication tasks, in both theory and experiment, and show that simpler measurements enable strong and sometimes even optimal entanglement-assisted qubit communication protocols. Using only partial Bell state analysers for two qubits, we demonstrate quantum correlations that cannot be simulated with two bits of classical communication. Then, we show that there exists an established and operationally meaningful task for which product measurements are sufficient for the strongest possible quantum predictions based on a maximally entangled two-qubit state. Our results reveal that there are scenarios in which the power of entanglement in enhancing quantum communication can be harvested in simple and scalable optical experiments.\nEntanglement and quantum communication are both paradigmatic resources for quantum information science and crucial for understanding the nonclassical nature of quantum theory. The former has been studied for decades in Bell-type experiments1\u20134, where communication between the parties is not allowed. The latter has, in more recent years, been extensively studied in prepare-and-measure experiments, where shared entanglement is absent5\u20137. It is therefore natural to investigate the most general scenario, featuring both entanglement and quantum communication.\nDense coding is a striking illustration of the power of entanglement-assisted quantum communication8 (Fig. 1a). By sharing an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair, dense coding allows one to transmit two bits of classical information while sending only one qubit8. In contrast, a qubit alone can never carry more than one bit of information9. No entanglement-assisted protocol based on sending a qubit can transmitmore than twobits10. Crucially, in addition to having an EPR pair, dense coding also requires the ability to jointly measure both shares in a basis of four maximally entangled two-qubit states; a so-called Bell basis measurement. For such a task, separable\nmeasurements do not offer any quantitative advantage over standard classical communication, regardless of the type of shared entangled state11.\nHowever, in contrast to some other platforms for dense coding12,13, optical systems do not allow a straightforward implementation of a Bell basis measurement on separate photonic carriers. While optics is a particularly natural platform for quantum communication, such an implementation is impossible with linear optics14,15 unless one employs auxiliary degrees of freedom16. Nevertheless, twoqubit optical demonstrations of dense coding have been performed, for example by implementing deterministic partial Bell basis measurements that can in principle harvest at most log23 bits\n17, or by encoding in continuous variables18,19, or by means of hyperentanglement which introduces additional photonic qubits20\u201323. Going beyond qubit systems, partial Bell basis measurements have recently been implemented on entanglement-assisted systems of dimension four to beat the two bit communication limit24. Nevertheless, deterministic implementations of sophisticated entangled measurements, in particular without auxiliary qubits, is difficult unless they are considerably\nReceived: 20 May 2022\nAccepted: 7 October 2022\nCheck for updates\n1Department of Physics, StockholmUniversity, S-10691 Stockholm,Sweden. 2Laboratoire d\u2019InformationQuantique,CP 225,Universit\u00e9 libredeBruxelles (ULB), Av.

Moreover, scaling a Bell basismeasurement beyond the few lowest dimensions is an outstanding challenge.\nHere we go beyond the dense coding task and consider more general communication tasks25,26 implemented with quantum messages assisted by entanglement. In such scenarios, when both entanglement and quantum communication are available, little is known about the predictions of quantum theory27,28. Here, we focus on the most elementary resources for such settings, namely a qubit message and a shared EPR state. We find that there exists correlation scenarios in which simple measurements can give rise to quantum correlations that cannot be simulatedwith twobits of classical communication, i.e., they cannot be reproduced with an ideal dense coding protocol. To this end, we first introduce a correlation task for which a standard partial Bell state analyser29,30 creates quantumcorrelations, that cannot be simulated with two bits of communication. Then, we go further and consider a well-established communication task, known as a Random Access Code, and show that product measurements are sufficient not only to elude classical models based on two bits of communication, but even to achieve the strongest predictions allowed by quantum theory for a two-qubit system. Thus, there exists natural communication tasks that can be implemented optimally by means of a quantum channel assisted by entanglement without the need for interference between the two photonic carriers in the measurement apparatus."

            "text": "Consider a generic communication task in which the sender selects a classical input x and encodes it into a message that is sent to the receiver. The receiver selects a question, labelled y, to which he produces an answer labelled b (Fig. 1b). After many runs, they obtain probabilities p(b\u2223x, y). The parties pre-share the state\n\u2223\u03d5+ = 1ffiffi\n2 p \u222300i + \u222311i\u00bd and themessage consists of a single qubit, which\nis encoded via a local unitary Ux on the sender\u2019s share. Once the receiver holds both shares, he performs the measurement {Eb\u2223y}. The probabilities are given by the Born rule,\np\u00f0b\u2223x,y\u00de= tr Eb\u2223y\u00f0Ux 1\u00de\u03d5+ \u00f0Uyx 1\u00de : \u00f01\u00de\nVia dense coding, any p(b\u2223x, y), where x takes at most four values, can be generated in the experiment, regardless of the number of questions the receiver asks. Therefore, to find correlations that go beyond dense coding, one needs at least five values of x. We use the ability to beat classical communication models based on two bits as a basic benchmark for quantum protocols.\nStochastic dense coding with Bell basis measurements First, we show that there exists a natural information-theoretic task whoseperformance canbe enhancedbeyondwhat is possiblewith two bits. Consider a Random Access Code (RAC)26: the sender holds x = x1x2\u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}2, and the receiver privately and uniformly selects y\u2208 {1, 2} with the aimof recovering xy. This is a stochastic dense coding task, with average success rate\nR= 1 32 X x,y p\u00f0b= xy\u2223x,y\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nVia dense coding, the receiver can, e.g., always recover x1 but is then forced to guess the value of x2, yieldingR= 58. In fact, no better two-bit strategy is possible (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Nevertheless, this bound can be exceededusing the samequantum resources. Let the receivermeasure the bases\n\u2223Eb\u22231 =1 \u03c3b1X \u03c3 b2 Z \u2223\u03d5 + \u00f03\u00de\n\u2223Eb\u22232 =1 R\u2223Eb\u22231 , \u00f04\u00de\nwhere R= 1 i 2 ffiffi 2 p 1+ 1+ i 2 ffiffi 2\np \u00f0\u03c3X + \u03c3Y + \u03c3Z \u00de and b = b1b2\u2208 {0, 1}2. Given these measurements, the success rate is bounded by\nR\u2264 1 32 X x max f\u2223\u03c8xig h\u03c8x \u2223Ex1 \u22231 + Ex2 \u22232\u2223\u03c8xi\n= 1 32 X x \u03bbmax\u00f0Ex1 \u22231 + Ex2 \u22232\u00de= 3 4 ,\n\u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u03bbmax is the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude. This bound is reachable in our scenario because the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bbmax for each x (the optimal two-qubit state) is maximally entangled, and hence realisable via a local unitary on \u2223\u03d5+ . No better quantum protocol exists because the best protocol based on sending an unassisted four-dimensional quanta is known to achieveR= 34\n31, which must strictly bound the protocols of our interest from above. We refer to Supplementary Note 1 for amoredetailed discussion of the Random Access Code, including the relation between its success probability and the classical capacity of (entanglement-assisted) communication channels.\nHowever, the above advantage is based on performing a pair of (rotated) Bell basis measurements, i.e., measurements similar to that used in dense coding. These lack both simple implementation and scalability in dimension. Moreover, even though essential for dense coding, it may not be that such sophisticated measurements are necessary for more general entanglement-assisted quantum communications. We, therefore, proceed to investigate the usefulness of considerably more elementary measurements.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7878 2\nBeyond two-bits models with a partial Bell state analyser Consider a communication task with the minimal number of preparations needed to possibly beat two-bit protocols: the sender holds data x\u2208 {1,\u2026, 5} and the receiver selects questions y\u2208 {1,\u2026, 6}, each with a binary answer b\u2208 {+1, \u22121}. Clearly, each question can only yield partial knowledge about x. We consider a simple figure of merit, S, in which each question either has precisely one correct answer or no correct answer. We can rephrase this in terms of the answer \u201cb = +1\u201d either being awarded one point (if correct), being penalised by one point (if incorrect) or being ignored. Our figure of merit is\nS X5 x = 1 X6 y= 1 cxyp\u00f0b= + 1\u2223x,y\u00de, \u00f06\u00de\nwhere the points awarded for each question are given by\nc=\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 BBBBBB@\n1 CCCCCCA : \u00f07\u00de\nThis figure of merit comes with favourable properties, but may be viewed as a proof-of-principle construction.\nUsing two bits of communication, the optimal score is S2bits = 5 (see \u201cMethods\u201d). To saturate it, the two bits can be encoded as {x = 1, x = 2\u2228 3, x = 4, x = 5}. Indeed, dense coding substantially improves on the best standard classical protocol, based on one bit of communication, (at best Sbit = 3). It also improves on the best protocol when one bit of communication is assisted by any amount of shared entanglement, specifically Sent +bit \u2248 3:799 (see \u201cMethods\u201d).\nHowever,we canbeat the two-bit limit: this timeusing only simple entangled measurements that only discriminate one of the four Bell states. Let the sender perform the following unitaries on her share of \u2223\u03d5+ ,\nUS1 =1, U S 2 =\n\u03c3Z ffiffi 3 p \u03c3X\n2 , U S 3 =\n\u03c3X ffiffi 3 p \u03c3Z\n2 ,\nUS4 = 1 i\u03c3Y\nffiffi 3\np 2 , U S 5 =\n1+ i\u03c3Y ffiffi 3\np 2 :\n\u00f08\u00de\nThese are rotations in the XZ-plane of the Bloch sphere. Once the qubit is relayed, the receiver holds the state USx 1\u2223\u03d5+ . The receiver per-\nforms a binary-outcome measurement f\u2223Ey E Ey D \u2223,1 \u2223Ey E Ey D\n\u2223g, where the outcome b = +1 corresponds to a projection onto the state \u2223Ey E =URy 1\u2223\u03d5+ for some unitary URy . Such a measurement may be viewed as a locally rotated partial Bell state analyser; it attempts to discriminate the maximally entangled state \u2223Ey E from its orthogonal complement. We choose the unitaries of the receiver as\nUR1 =1, U R 2 = \u03bd + 1+ i\u03bd \u03c3Y 2 ffiffi 2 p , UR3 = \u03bd + 1 i\u03bd \u03c3Y 2 ffiffi 2 p ,\nUR4 =U S 2, U R 5 =U S 3, U R 6 = 1 i\u03c3Yffiffi 2 p : \u00f09\u00de\nwhere \u03bd \u00b1 = ffiffiffi 3 p \u00b1 1. Once again, these are rotations in the XZ-plane. The figure of merit becomes\nS = X x,y cxy\u2223hEy\u2223USx 1\u2223\u03d5+ i\u22232\n= 1 2 tr URy y USx = 3+\n3 ffiffiffi 3 p\n2 \u2248 5:598,\n\u00f010\u00de\nwhich considerably exceeds the two-bit limit. We note that the value (10) can be somewhat further increased. Using a numerical search, we find a protocol achieving S\u22485:641. However, this protocol is of lesser\ninterest since it requires more complicated measurements. Our above protocol is also robust to unavoidable implementational imperfections. For instance, if the EPR pair is exposed to isotropic noise, so that the state becomes v\u2223\u03d5+ \u03d5+\n\u2223+ 1 v4 1, for some visibility v\u2208 [0, 1], the advantage over dense coding is maintained whenever v > 16\n12 + 3 ffiffi 3\np \u224893%. Thanks to the simplicity of the measurements, the correlation advantage can be demonstrated using standard linear optics for polarisation qubits. Using a spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process, we prepare two-photon polarisation entangled state \u2223\u03a8i= 1ffiffi\n2 p \u00f0\u2223HHi+ \u2223VV i\u00de. The single-qubit unitaries are implemented\nusing combinations of wave-plates and phase shifters while the partial Bell statemeasurement is implemented by interfering the twophotons via a polarising beam splitter. The setup is illustrated in Fig. 2 and the specific settings are given inSupplementaryNote 2. This leads us to the experimentally measured value of S = 5:379 \u00b10:009, which outperforms the dense coding limit by approximately 40 standard deviations (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Due to the sizeable violation and the large number of collected events, the p-value associated to our falsification of a two-bit model is vanishingly small (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The result and its relation to the various theoretical limits is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nHowever, even though partial Bell state measurements offer sizeable advantages over two-bit protocols in relatively simple photonic experiments, they do not offer a clear path to scalability in terms of dimension or particle number. Also, from a conceptual standpoint, it is not self-evident that entanglement in the measurement must, in general, be indispensable for correlation advantages. To address both the practical and conceptual question, we investigate the possibility of using even the most elementary class of joint measurements, namely product measurements, for entanglement-assisted communication beyond two-bit protocols.\nOptimal Quantum Random Access Code with product measurements Unfortunately, the previously discussed RAC seems to offer no advantage over two-bit classical models when the receiver is restricted to product measurements However, a variation of it, featuring a different number of inputs and settings, does reveal a distinct advantage. Let the sender hold data x = x1x2x3\u2208 {0, 1}3 and the receiver uniformly\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7878 3\nselect y\u2208 {1, 2, 3} with the aim of recovering xy. The average success rate is\nT = 1 24 X x,y p\u00f0b= xy\u2223x,y\u00de: \u00f011\u00de\nA two-bit protocol achieves at best T 2bit = 56 which can be shown considering all vertices of the classical polytope (see \u201cMethods\u201d). It is saturated by the sender relaying both themajority bit in x and the x3 to the receiver. Now consider that the sender performs the unitaries\nUx = \u00f0 1\u00dex1 \u03b1x1\u03bcx2x3 \u00f0 1\u00de x2 + x3\u03b1 x1\u03bcx2x3 \u00f0 1\u00dex2 + x3 ffiffiffi 2 p \u03b1 x1 ffiffiffi 2 p \u03b1x1 ,\n! \u00f012\u00de\nwhere \u03bcx2x3 = \u00f0 1\u00de x2 + i\u00f0 1\u00dex3 , \u03b1s = 12\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 + \u00f0 1\u00des ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2=3 pq and the bar-sign\ndenotes bit-flip. The receiver measures three product observables\nE1 = \u03c3Z \u03c3Z \u00f013\u00de\nE2 = 1 2 \u03c3Y\nffiffiffi 3 p \u03c3Y + \u03c3Z\n\u00f014\u00de\nE3 = 1 2 \u03c3X\nffiffiffi 3 p \u03c3Y \u03c3Z , \u00f015\u00de\nwhere Ey \u2261 E1\u2223y \u2212 E2\u2223y. This leads to T = 12 + 1ffiffi6p > T 2bit. In fact, this outperforms even protocols based on sending five classical symbols. Interestingly, no better quantum protocol is possible, even if based on general entangled measurements. This follows from the fact that the best protocol based on four-dimensional quanta is also known to achieve T = 12 + 1ffiffi6p 32. Adapting the optical setup (see Fig. 2), we have demonstrated also this correlation advantage using the same source and the same measuring time as in the previous experiment. The specific settings are given in Supplementary Note 4. We observe T =0:8987\u00b10:003,whichbeats the two-bit limitwithover 20 standard deviations (see \u201cMethods\u201d). The results are illustrated in Fig. 3."

Conceptually, it motivates a research effort into\ngeneral entanglement-assisted correlations27,28 based on product measurements for the receiver. A natural question is to determine when and why product measurements are useful for entanglementassisted quantum communication. It is paired with crucial practical advantages since such protocols circumvents the need for implementing highly demanding entangled measurements in favour of quantum devices that require only single-system measurements. This maymakepossiblebothmulti-particle andhigh-dimensional protocols for entanglement-assisted quantum communication that are realistically implementable. It may also offer a viable practical path to otherwise demanding foundational experiments based on these natural quantum resources."

Consequently, the optimal performance of any linear figure of merit, e.g., that in Eq. (6), is necessarily attained at a vertex of this polytope. One can thus check the value of the figure of merit at all vertices and select the largest value. However, when (potentially unbounded) entanglement is added, this picture breaks down. Instead, upper bounds on S and T can be determined using the hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations developed in ref. 27, which uses the concept of informationally-restricted quantum correlations33,34. Using this method, andmatching it with an explicit entanglement-based strategy with classical communication, we find Sent +bit \u2248 3:799 and T ent +bit \u2248 0:789.\nThe optimality of our protocols for the two RACs, corresponding toR and T , respectively, can be shown as follows. For both results, we use that the set of correlations attainable with an EPR pair and a qubit message is a subset of the set of correlations attainable in scenarios in which the sender and receiver only share classical randomness and communicate a four-dimensional quantum system. In these standard scenarios, it is known that R\u2264 34\n31 and that T \u2264 12 + 1ffiffi6p 32 for general protocols. As our protocols saturate these bounds, optimality follows."
