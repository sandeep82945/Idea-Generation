Integration of Demand Response and Energy Storage: Investigate the role and optimization of demand response and energy storage systems within the proposed energy-reserve co-optimization model. This could explore how flexible demand and storage can provide additional reserve and ramping capabilities, potentially reducing system costs and improving reliability under high renewable penetration scenarios.

Advanced Forecasting Techniques: Develop and incorporate advanced forecasting techniques for renewable energy generation and load demand into the rolling-window dispatch framework. This could involve machine learning models that predict renewable output and load more accurately, thereby reducing the uncertainty and improving the efficiency of the dispatch process.

Market Mechanism Design for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): Explore market mechanisms that allow distributed energy resources, including small-scale renewable generators, battery storage, and demand response, to participate in the energy and reserve markets. This research could focus on how to integrate DERs into the current market framework without compromising system stability and reliability.

Robust and Adjustable Optimization Under Uncertainty: Extend the model to include robust and adjustable optimization techniques that can handle deeper levels of uncertainty in renewable generation and load forecasts. This research could compare the performance of robust, stochastic, and adjustable optimization approaches within the proposed co-optimization framework to find the most effective method for dealing with uncertainty.

Impact of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on Energy and Reserve Markets: Study the impact of large-scale electric vehicle adoption on the energy and reserve markets. This could involve modeling the additional load and potential storage capacity provided by EVs, assessing how EVs could be managed to support grid stability, and exploring policies for encouraging EV participation in energy and reserve markets.
