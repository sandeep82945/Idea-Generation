Lithium-ion batteries are typically the favourite electrochemical power source to provide high power and long service life [2]. An accurate model of the current and voltage characteristics is critical to optimize in the energy that can be delivered by the battery. This paper investigates the performance of a popular, commercially available cell utilizing the equivalent circuit model [3] and computational fluid dynamics MSMD battery model to identify the dynamic parameters and examine the thermal behaviour of the battery.\nNumerous studies have been conducted and developed to establish a better understanding of the nonlinear response behaviour of an electrochemical cell [4-5]. A common technique of characterizing a battery cell is the Electrochemical Impendence Spectrum (EIS), which is employed by applying a small sinusoidal excitation current to the cell at a frequency range of 1 mHz to 10 kHz and measuring its voltage response. The dynamics of the battery is then characterized through Randles equivalent circuit model through the Nyquist and bode plots to identify the internal resistances of the battery [6]. Though valuable insights can be concluded from this technique, however, it cannot predict battery run time and evaluates the dynamic behaviour at a fixed state of charge.\nIt is highly critical to portray the battery\u2019s nonlinear dynamics throughout the entire discharge period; therefore, this study utilizes the hybrid power pulsing characterization (HPPC) test to identify instantaneous and transient parameters of a Lithium-ion battery for the entire state of charge range. An equivalent circuit is then modelled on MATLAB Simulink to describe the battery terminal voltage-current dynamics by utilizing passive electrical circuit components such as capacitors and resistors. To ensure good fitment and accurate representation of the dynamic performance of the battery, the parameter estimation tool is used to fit the simulation results to the voltage response measured experimentally. The parameters obtained from the equivalent circuit model are then employed in the MSMD battery model in ANSYS Fluent to examine the thermal behaviour of the battery.\n155-2\nThe next section is a detailing of the battery study conducted and the experimental test setup. Then, the details of the equivalent circuit model are presented and shown to agree with experimental voltage-current data. Next, a CFD model is presented with the thermal performance of the battery. Finally, the paper is concluded with some closing remarks.\n2. Battery Details and Experimental Quantification In this study a non-rechargeable Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA battery is considered. The parameters for the\nbattery are displayed in Table 1 [7].\nbatteries and the voltage response to step pulses of current at a constant rate. This method has been widely utilized as a technique to identify the required parameters for battery simulations to characterize the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of an electrochemical battery cell [8]. To preform this test, the experimental setup shown in Fig. 1 is employed. This single loop circuit is constructed from a DC power supply (Keysight E36312A) as a source of constant voltage and constant current, a Relay to control the voltage and current signals supplied to the battery in the circuit, a Waveform Generator (Keysight 3360A) to produce square waves triggering the Relay at a set frequency. To measure the voltage and current response of the battery, two Digit Multi-meters (Keysight 34465A 6 1/2) were used, one connected in series with the battery to measure the current and the other connected in parallel across the battery to measure the voltage.\nThe battery was discharged at a C/2 rate; therefore, the cell was pulsed at 1.5A supplied by the DC power supply. To\nproduce the square waves profile of the current, the waveform generator triggered the relay at a constant frequency of 2.8 mHz with 50% duty cycle. Furthermore, the sampling rate of the Multi-meters were set to 0.4 Sa/s and live data acquisition readings were observed via the BenchVue desktop app. The data recorded was then exported to a MATLAB data file (.mat) for analysis.\n155-3\nDisplayed in Fig. 2 are the current and voltage responses of the battery measurements obtained from the experiment.\nThe battery is fully discharged as the full range of usable voltage specified by the manufacturer is observed, therefore, the equivalent circuit parameters can be tuned and identified over the fully range of state of charge (SOC)."

The voltage source in the circuit represents the open-circuit voltage (VOCV), which describes the voltage cross the battery terminals when the cell is unloaded and in complete equilibrium. The resistor in series (Rs) is the Ohmic resistance, which\n155-4\naccounts for the power dissipated by the battery as heat energy [9]. The two resistor-capacitor sub circuits (R1, C1, R2 and C2) represent the time constants in the circuit which account for the diffusion dynamics of the battery. The Voltage V(t) is the measured voltage drop across the passive components of the circuit subtracted from the open-circuit voltage to obtain the losses of the battery. The input to this circuit is the current measurements obtained experimentally and is denoted by I(t).\nThe state of charge (SOC) of the battery was solved utilizing Eq. (1). Where is the columbic efficiency or the charge efficiency and is a unitless constant which has a value of 1 when the battery is discharging [9]. Q is the nominal capacity of the battery described in Table 1. Furthermore, the voltage-current relationship was obtained by solving Eqs. (2)-(4).\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nTo solve the equations described above, the block diagram shown in Fig. 4 was employed utilizing MATLAB\nSimulink. The VOCV was identified from the peaks of the voltage response during the relaxation period and the passive circuitry components were modelled as 1-D lookup tables with 20 different values that correspond to the state of charge at different time intervals. The parameter estimator toolbox in Simulink was utilized to reduce the error between the simulation and experimental voltage measurements, therefore, the capacitor and the resistor values in the lookup tables were tuned to fit the simulation voltage to the experimental voltage.\n155-5\nThe results obtained from the Simulink simulation for the state of charge degradation over time, the open-circuit\nvoltage as a function of the State of Charge and the measured and simulated voltage after utilizing the parameter estimation toolbox are displayed in Fig. 5.\n(a) (b)\nAs illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the battery is fully discharged through the continuous constant pulses.
