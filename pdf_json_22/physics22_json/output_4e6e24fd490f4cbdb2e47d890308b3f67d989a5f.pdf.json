    "abstractText": "We investigate the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) built with M species of massless free Dirac fermions coupled at one boundary point via a conformal junction/interface. Each CFT represents a wire of finite length L. We develop a systematic strategy to compute the R\u00e9nyi entropies for a generic bipartition between the wires and the entanglement negativity between two non-complementary sets of wires. Both these entanglement measures turn out to grow logarithmically with L with an exactly calculated universal prefactor depending on the details of the junction and of the bipartition. These analytic predictions are tested numerically for junctions of free Fermi gases, finding perfect agreement.",

The most successful way to quantify the many-body entanglement is via the R\u00e9nyi entropies: given a system in a pure state |\u03a6\u3009 and a bipartition A \u222a B, the subsystem A is described by the reduced density matrix \u03c1A = TrB|\u03a6\u3009\u3008\u03a6|, and the R\u00e9nyi entropies are\nSn(A) = 1\n1\u2212 n log Tr (\u03c1 n A) . (1.1)\nFor n \u2192 1 this definition gives the von Neumann entropy S(A) = \u2212Tr (\u03c1A log \u03c1A), often called just entanglement entropy. One of the most important use of the R\u00e9nyi entropies has been the characterisation of critical one-dimensional systems: the distinctive feature is the logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy with the (sub)system size and\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nconformal field theory (CFT) provides universal predictions for the prefactor of such logarithm. For example, the vacuum R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy of an interval A of length ` embedded in an infinite system is given by [10\u201312]\nSn(A) = c\n6\n( 1 + 1\nn\n) log `\n\u03b5 + . . . , (1.2)\nwhere c is the central charge and \u03b5 is a ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. This remarkable scaling behaviour is altered at leading order by the presence of a boundaries [11]. For conformally invariant boundary conditions (bc\u2019s), the entanglement entropy can be studied via boundary CFT [13\u201315], a framework that already found a large number of applications in condensed matter and particle physics, such as quantum impurity problems [16], the multichannel Kondo problem [17], D-brane physics [18] etc. For a finite size CFT of length 2L with conformal invariant bc\u2019s at the two edges, the R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy between the half-chain A = [0, L] and the other half is [11, 12]\nSn(A) = c\n12\n( 1 + 1\nn\n) log L\n\u03b5 + . . . , (1.3)\nup to finite terms that depend on the bc\u2019s. At leading order in L/\u03b5\u2192\u221e, eqs. (1.2) and (1.3) differ by a factor 2. This is heuristically understood because the two geometries differ by the number of entangling points and, in general, one expects the entanglement entropy to be proportional to the size of the boundary of the subsystem. In both geometries mentioned above the origin of the entanglement relies on the presence of completely transmissive entangling points, resulting in some degree of quantum coherence among the subsystem and its complement. Conversely, when the entangling points are completely reflective because of some additional boundary conditions, the subsystems decouple, and the entanglement entropy between them vanishes. A natural generalisation of the above scenarios regards the intermediate setting in which the entangling points are partially transmitting and reflecting [19]. In the literature, such special situations are known as permeable interfaces, defects, or impurities (and indeed we will refer to them using all these equivalent names). A crucial result is that for free massless theories the defect is marginal [20] and so can alter the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy. Conversely, interactions make the defect either relevant or irrelevant [20] ending up asymptotically in a completely reflective or transmitting situation, respectively, as shown also by the scaling of the entanglement entropy itself [21, 22]. For free theories in the presence of a conformal interface (i.e., scale invariant) Sakai and Satoh exploited boundary CFT to show that the scaling of the entanglement entropy, (1.3) for n = 1, is modified as [23]\nS(A) = ceff( \u221a T )\n6 log L \u03b5 + . . . , (1.4)\nwhere T is a parameter which represents the transmission probability and ceff( \u221a T ), dubbed as effective central charge, is a monotonic function of its argument satisfying\nceff(0) = 0, ceff(1) = c. (1.5)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nFigure 1. The conformal junction: M wires are joined together at x = 0 by a conformally invariant scattering matrix S. We consider a tripartition in three sets A,B,C with MA,MB ,MC wires each. The entanglement between A and B is given by the negativity (1.6). A bipartite configuration is simply obtained by letting MC = 0.\nref. [23] focuses on the free massless boson, but eq. (1.4) with a different ceff( \u221a T ) has\nbeen subsequently derived also for free massless fermions both by means of CFT [24\u201326], and explicitly solving microscopic models [27\u201331] in the same universality class. While the scaling in eq. (1.4) is expected to be a generic feature of conformal invariant (1+1)- dimensional systems, the explicit functional form of the effective central charge depends both on the theory and the details of the interface, eventually encoded in a interface operator (or, equivalently, in a boundary state as explained in [24]). We mention that a class of completely transmissive interfaces, dubbed topological interfaces, has been also considered in the literature [32\u201338]. While their effective central charge is always c, and they could be erroneously considered trivial, the O(1) terms shrugged off in eq. (1.4) still contains important information about the boundary conditions, strictly related to the boundary entropy of Affleck-Ludwig [39].\nThe permeable interface between two CFTs can be generalised to a junction ofM wires. The resulting geometry is depicted in figure 1 in which the junction is fully characterised by a scattering matrix S between the wires. Imposing that this matrix S preserves conformal invariance, one finds consistency conditions that have been studied and solved for a large number of physical configurations [40\u201348]. The bipartite entanglement in these conformal (or star) junctions has been studied in refs. [29, 49\u201351] but focusing on the entanglement between a single wire and the remaining M \u2212 1 ones. A unifying framework to compute the entanglement of a generic bipartition among the wires of the junctions is still missing.\nThe conformal junction is also a very obvious setup for the study of multipartite entanglement because it is made of several wires and it is very natural to wonder about\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nthe entanglement between a subset of them, not only two complementary subsystems. In this respect, the first configuration that comes to mind is the tripartition in A,B,C with MA,MB,MC wires each, as depicted in figure 1. To study the entanglement of this tripartition, one can integrate out the MC wires in C, to get the reduced density matrix \u03c1A\u222aB. Then the entanglement between A and B with the mixed density matrix \u03c1A\u222aB is measured by the negativity [52, 53]\nE = log ||\u03c1TBA\u222aB||, (1.6)\nwhere TB denotes the partial transposition with respect to the degrees of freedom in B and || \u00b7 || stands for the trace norm. The negativity in the presence of a defect has been computed for a bipartite geometry with M = 2 [54], exploiting its relation with the 1/2- R\u00e9nyi entropy for the bipartition of a pure state, but for a genuinely tripartite geometry at a junction there are no results yet.\nThe main goal of this manuscript is to provide a general framework to deal with the entanglement through permeable junctions of M (1 + 1)-dimensional free-fermion CFT. Following refs. [19, 23], the strategy is to constrain the form of the general boundary state in a folded theory. Then, being the theory free, we can reduce the problem to the computation of a charged partition function in the presence of this boundary state. This approach also allows us to compute the negativity in a tripartite geometry by properly implementing a partial transpose operation for free fermions.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we review the folding trick which turns the problem of constructing conformal interfaces into the one of building boundary states. We review the construction of fermionic boundary states and we compute the partition functions in the junction geometry. Using this result and the replica trick, we obtain the entanglement entropy analytically for a generic bipartition between wires. In section 3, we combine the previous formalism with the replica trick for the fermionic negativity. This allows us to obtain an analytic prediction that we benchmark against numerical computations in section 4. In the same section, we also describe an alternative technique for the computation of the entanglement of a fermion gas on a star graph modelling the junction of interest. We draw our conclusions in section 5 and we relegate some technical material about our computations in the appendix A."

            "text": "In this section we present the CFT approach for the evaluation of the entanglement in permeable junctions of (1+1)-dimensional free-fermion CFTs, following closely refs. [19, 23, 24]. As a first application, we employ this method to compute the R\u00e9nyi entropies between an arbitrary number of wires at the junction.\nLet us consider M wires of length L, each of them described by a CFT denoted by\nCFTj , j = 1, . . . ,M. (2.1)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nFigure 2. The folding procedure. The junction in Euclidean spacetime is the booklet with the CFTs bound in x = 0 (left panel). The folding consists in merging together the M CFTs in a worldsheet being a single infinite strip with an appropriate boundary state |S\u3009 at x = 0 (middle panel). To compute the entanglement, we cut the system for |w| < \u03b5 and w > |L| (dashed lines) and map the M-CFT onto a rectangle of size log L\u03b5 \u00d7 \u03c0 (right) with Re(z) \u2208 [log \u03b5, logL] and Im(z) \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2].\nIn Euclidean space-time, the junction looks like a booklet (with each page corresponding to one CFT) bound along the imaginary axis at x = 0, see the left panel of figure 2. As custom in this kind of systems, we are going to work in the folded picture in which the system is represented as a single CFT M-CFT = CFT1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 CFTM , (2.2)\ni.e. the world-sheet is a single infinite strip of width L (we are dealing with a finite size quantum system at zero temperature, so the space-time coordinate w satisfies Re(w) \u2208 [0, L]) whereM copies of the CFT live. See the middle panel of figure 2 for a pictorial representation. The joining between the distinct wires is specified by the boundary conditions along the lines\nRe(w) = 0, Re(w) = L. (2.3)\nWe require that the boundary condition at Re(w) = L decouples the replicas, and can be thus described by a boundary state |B\u3009 factorised as\n|B\u3009 = |B1\u3009 \u2297 . . . |BM \u3009 , (2.4)\nwith |Bj\u3009 being a boundary state of CFTj . Instead, we assume that the boundary conditions at Re(w) = 0 (describing the defect/junction), in general couple explicitly distinct wires. We denote by |S\u3009 the associated boundary state in M-CFT. In the remainder of the manuscript, the precise details of the boundary state |B\u3009 appearing at Re(w) = L would not matter and so we do not specify more about it. The physical motivation is that, as long as it decouples the wires, we do not expect that its features affect (at least at leading order) the correlation properties among distinct wires. In contrast, this is not the case for the boundary state |S\u3009, and for this reason we have to be very careful about its characterisation.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nIn order to have under control ultraviolet and infrared divergences in the entanglement entropy, a standard trick [10, 55\u201358] consists in cutting the theory for |w| < \u03b5 and |w| > L (see figure 2, middle panel). The cut strip can then be mapped into a rectangle by the conformal transformation\nz = logw. (2.5)\nThe semicircles |w| = \u03b5 and |w| = L are mapped respectively onto the segments\nz \u2208 log \u03b5+ i[\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2], z \u2208 logL+ i[\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]. (2.6)\nThe defect line at Re(w) = 0 is split into the two lines Im(z) = \u00b1\u03c0/2. This mapping is shown in the right panel of figure 2. The partition function in this geometry can be written as\nZ = \u3008S| exp (\u2212\u03c0H) |S\u3009 , (2.7)\nwhere \u03c0 is the height of the rectangle (see figure 2), while the hamiltonian is (up to the Casimir energy which does not play any role in our discussion)\nH = 2\u03c0 log L\u03b5\n( L0 + L\u03040 ) , (2.8)\nwith L0, L\u03040 being generators of the Virasoro algebra of CFT1 \u2297 . . .CFTM . So far, everything is general and no assumption on the bulk theory or the boundary state |S\u3009 has been made yet. However, the knowledge of |S\u3009 is required to evaluate the partition function (and, by replicas, the entanglement). From now on, we thus restrict the analysis to massless free fermions for which we can provide a precise characterisation for the boundary state |S\u3009."

            "text": "In this section, we first review the construction of boundary states for a theory of many species of massless Majorana fermions [19, 51]. Then we discuss the straightforward generalisation to Dirac fermions, obtained through a doubling of the degrees of freedom [59]. We consider M species of Majorana fermions. This CFT has central charge c = M/2 and it is described in terms of the left/right chiral fermionic fields\n\u03c8j , \u03c8\u0304j , j = 1, . . . ,M. (2.9)\nIn radial quantisation [59], restricting the analysis to the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector, one can decompose the fermionic fields in their Laurent modes\n\u03c8j(z) = \u2211\nk\u2208Z+1/2\n\u03c8jk zk+1/2\n, \u03c8\u0304j(z\u0304) = \u2211\nk\u2208Z+1/2\n\u03c8\u0304jk z\u0304k+1/2 . (2.10)\n(In the Ramond sector, k would be integer and the discussion would be slightly more involved due to the presence of a zero mode for k = 0.) Within this convention, the creation/annihilation operators of a fermion of the j-th species in the mode k (k > 0) are\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\n\u03c8j\u2213k. The number k is (proportional to) the momentum of the particle. More precisely, one can show that the commutation relations between the fermionic fields and the Virasoro operators L0, L\u03040 are\n[L0, \u03c8j\u2212k] = k\u03c8 j \u2212k, [L\u03040, \u03c8\u0304 j \u2212k] = k\u03c8\u0304 j \u2212k. (2.11)\nThe effect of the scattering matrix S at the junction (as in figure 1) is nothing but a consistency condition for the state boundary state |S\u3009 reading(\n\u03c8jk + iSjj\u2032\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 \u2212k\n) |S\u3009 = 0, (2.12)\nwhere, hereafter, repeated indices are summed over. It has been shown [25, 60], that in order to preserve conformal invariance at the boundary, S must be orthogonal\nS \u2208 O(M). (2.13)\nIn particular the possible k-dependence of the scattering matrix is ruled out by scale invariance. The solution for |S\u3009 of eq. (2.12) is simply\n|S\u3009 = \u220f\nk\u2208N\u22121/2 exp\n( iSjj\u2032\u03c8 j \u2212k\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 \u2212k ) |0\u3009 , (2.14)\nwith |0\u3009 being the vacuum of the theory. Notice that the different values of k are decoupled, a fact that will simplify the forthcoming computations. Nevertheless, in general, different species of particles are coupled, due to the possible occurrence of non-diagonal terms in the matrix S. Those terms represent physically the amplitudes of transmission between different wires and cause the entanglement among them. We now consider a theory of M free Dirac fermions (having central charge c = M), for which the associated fields are\n\u03a8j , \u03a8\u2020j , \u03a8j , \u03a8\u2020 j , j = 1, . . . ,M, (2.15)\nwhere \u03a8 and \u03a8\u2020 represent the particles/antiparticles respectively. This theory is equivalent to a theory with 2M Majorana fermions, and so the previous derivation is valid also in this case. The number of degrees of freedom is doubled and one should take an orthogonal real 2M \u00d7 2M scattering matrix S \u2208 O(2M). However, if we further impose that the global U(1) symmetry\n\u03a8\u2192 ei\u03b8\u03a8, \u03a8\u2020 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8\u03a8\u2020 (2.16)\nis preserved by the boundary conditions, there are additional constraints on the scattering matrix. This requirement corresponds to the property that a left/right particle can be produced from the vacuum (through the boundary state) together with its right/left antiparticle only. Requiring that this symmetry is preserved by the boundary conditions, we end up into a complex unitary scattering matrix\nS \u2208 U(M), (2.17)\nthat constrains the boundary state |S\u3009 as( \u03a8\u2020jk + iSjj\u2032\u03a8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) |S\u3009 = 0, ( \u03a8jk + iSjj\u2032\u03a8 \u2020j\u2032 \u2212k ) |S\u3009 = 0, (2.18)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwith S\u0304 being the matrix complex conjugated to S.

(2.19)\nA property of the state |S\u3009 in eq. (2.19) is that it contains two decoupled contributions, depending on the right and left moving particles. We will use this property to simplify the computations in the following sections."

            "text": "We describe how to compute the n-th R\u00e9nyi entropy of a subset made up of MA \u2264M wires via the replica trick. Given a subsystem A of a generic QFT, the R\u00e9nyi entropies (1.1) of integer order n can be obtained in a replicated theory with n copies of the QFT, i.e. in QFT\u2297n, which are cyclically joined along A by a branch-cut connecting the i-th and the (i + 1)-th replica [11]. The moments of the reduced density matrices can be then written in terms of a ratio of partition functions as [11, 12]\nTr (\u03c1nA) = Zn Zn1 , (2.20)\nwhere Zn is the partition function of the replicated theory while Zn1 is just the partition function of a single replica raised to the n-th power. In the case of the bulk free Dirac fermion, the partition function Zn can be further factorised using the replica diagonalisation as, e.g., shown in [61]. Within this method, the replicated partition function Zn becomes the product of n single-replica U(1) charged partition functions with flux \u03b1p = 2\u03c0pn (p = \u2212 n\u22121 2 , . . . , n\u22121 2 ), each of them denoted by Z1(\u03b1p). The flux ei\u03b1p is inserted along the branch-cut of Zn that can be rewritten as\nZn = n\u22121 2\u220f p=\u2212n\u221212 Z1 ( \u03b1p = 2\u03c0p n ) . (2.21)\nIn ref. [61] this factorisation is derived by writing Zn as a 2n-dimensional Gaussian integral, whose diagonalisation leads to the product of n two-dimensional Gaussian integrals. Plugging eq. (2.21) for Zn into eq. (2.20) one has Tr (\u03c1nA) = \u220f p (Z1(\u03b1p)/Z1) in which the ratio Z1(\u03b1p)/Z1 can be expressed as the vacuum expectation value of the operator associated to the action of the U(1) symmetry restricted to A, namely\nZ1(\u03b1) = \u30080|ei\u03b1QA |0\u3009. (2.22)\nHere QA is the charge operator which counts the difference between particles and antiparticles in the subsystem A, while |0\u3009 is the vacuum of the theory. Notice that these charged partition sums are the same appearing in the calculation of the symmetry resolved entanglement [62\u201365]. While ref. [61] and most of the subsequent literature focus on the ground state of the system in the absence of boundaries, the same considerations apply more generically\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nand in particular to the case of interest here. The reason is that the boundary state of interest (2.19) is Gaussian (it is an exponential of a bilinear of fermions) and thus the functional measure is Gaussian too: in other words, the theory is free both in the bulk and at the boundary (we stress that this property cannot be assumed a priori for a quadratic bulk theory, because there are interactions at the boundary that spoil the Gaussianity of the state, see for example [66]). Hence, in our specific case, we start from the theory M-CFT = CFT1\u2297 . . .CFTM and we replicate it n times, ending up with M-CFT\u2297n. Then, to compute Zn we perform a diagonalisation in replica space and end up with the product of n charged partition functions which are given by eq.

(2.32)\nUsing the unitarity of S, SS\u2020 = S\u2020S = 1, one can show that (see eq.

Putting all the pieces together and taking into account the contribution coming from exchanging \u03a8 \u2194 \u03a8\u2020, we find the analytic expression of the U(1) charged partition function in eq. (2.25)\nZ1(\u03b1) \u221d \u220f\nk\u2208N\u22121/2 det\n( 1 + 2(S\u2020AASAA + (1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos\u03b1)q 2k + q4k )2 . (2.34)\nAccording to eq. (2.21), the n-sheeted partition function Zn can be written finally as\nZn = n\u22121 2\u220f p=\u2212n\u221212 Z1(\u03b1 = 2\u03c0p/n)\n\u221d n\u22121 2\u220f p=\u2212n\u221212 \u220f k\u2208N\u22121/2 det ( 1 + 2(S\u2020AASAA + (1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos(2\u03c0p/n))q 2k + q4k )2 , (2.35)\nwhich is the main result of this section, although not yet written in a very transparent form.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nFrom eq. (2.35) it is clear that in the presence of several wires belonging to A,MA \u2265 1, there are MA factorised contributions depending on the eigenvalues of 1 \u2212 S\u2020AASAA and coming from the presence of the determinant of a MA \u00d7MA matrix. In other words, if we define\nZn,Ta = n\u22121 2\u220f p=\u2212n\u221212 \u220f k\u2208N\u22121/2 ( 1 + 2((1\u2212 Ta) + Ta cos(2\u03c0p/n))q2k + q4k )2 , (2.36)\nas the contribution coming from the generic eigenvalue Ta \u2208 Spec(1\u2212 S\u2020AASAA), one has\nZn = MA\u220f a=1 Zn,Ta , (2.37)\nwhere Ta can be interpreted as generalised effective transmission probabilities. Plugging this relation in the definition of the R\u00e9nyi entropy in eq. (1.1), one gets\nSn(A) = MA\u2211 a=1 Sn,Ta , (2.38)\nwith Sn,Ta =\n1 1\u2212 n log Zn,Ta Zn1,Ta\n(2.39)\nbeing the R\u00e9nyi entropy associated to each Ta. For the sake of completeness, we provide the explicit result for the partition functions and for the entanglement entropies in the relevant limit L\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e. Since the total entropy is just given by the sum of MA independent contributions with effective transmission Ta it is sufficient to write only one term. For convenience, we also define a parameter \u03b1\u2032, being a function of \u03b1 and the effective transmission Ta, satisfying\n2 cos\u03b1\u2032 = 2(1\u2212 Ta + Ta cos\u03b1). (2.40)\nThe infinite product appearing in eq. (2.34) which gives the U(1) partition function is explicitly evaluated in appendix (A.3), obtaining\nZ1(\u03b1) Z1(0)\n= ( \u03b83 ( \u03b1\u2032 2\u03c0 , q )\n\u03b83(0, q)\n)2 . (2.41)\nIn the limit q \u2192 1, the leading term of the partition function gives\nlog Z1(\u03b1) Z1(0) ' 1log q ( Li2(\u2212ei\u03b1 \u2032) + Li2(\u2212e\u2212i\u03b1 \u2032)\u2212 2Li2(\u22121) ) = \u2212 ( \u03b1\u2032 2\u03c0 )2 log L \u03b5 , (2.42)\nwith \u03b1\u2032 given by (2.40). Summing over the n values of the flux \u03b1, one gets straightforwardly the n-th R\u00e9nyi entropy plugging eq. (2.42) into eq. (2.21). After some long but simple algebra, the final result is\nSn,Ta =  2 \u03c02(n\u2212 1) bn/2c\u2211 p=1 arcsin2 (\u221a Ta cos (2p\u2212 1)\u03c0 2n ) log L \u03b5 , (2.43)\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwhich matches the one in ref. [29] where also the analytic analytical continuation to n\u2192 1 can be found and it is not repeated here. We stress that the major advance in this section compared to the existing literature [29, 51] has been to understand how the elements of SAA combine (via the eigenvalues of (1 \u2212 S\u2020AASAA)) to give the entanglement entropy of more than one wire, while previous studies focused on a single one. This result is also preparatory to the calculation of the negativity reported in the following section."

Given the presence of multiple wires, we do not simply divide them into two sets, say A and B, which is the usual setup in which the von Neumann entropy captures the entanglement between A and its complement, but we take a tripartition and we ask what is the entanglement between two non-complementary parts. In particular, we consider here the partial time-reversal negativity (often just called fermionic negativity), which is a more suitable entanglement measure for fermionic systems in mixed states (see [67\u201375]). We will proceed via the evaluation of the R\u00e9nyi negativity for even n = ne and then we will study the replica limit ne \u2192 1."

            "text": "We consider the conformal junction of figure 1 with the subsystems A,B, and C formed by three sets of wires. We are interested in the negativity between A and B. The definition in eq. (1.6) is not well-suited to study the entanglement properties in the context of fermionic systems (see [67\u201369]). To circumvent this issue, the partial time-reversal transformation of the reduced density matrix has been introduced [67] and here we use the same symbols \u03c1TBAB and E , as for the standard partial transpose operation, having in mind that we refer always and only to the fermionic negativity. The replica approach to the negativity [76, 77] starts from the computation of the moments of the partial transpose reduced density matrix that can be written in terms of a ratio of partition functions as\nTr(\u03c1TBAB) n = Z\u0302n Z\u0302n1 . (3.1)\nThis path integral representation of the moments is similar to the one of the reduced density matrix in eq. (2.20), but here Zn is replaced by Z\u0302n. The latter is the partition function in the n-sheeted Riemann surface built in such a way to implement the partial time reversal transposition in the subsystem B (see refs. [76, 77] for more details on the partial transpose and [67, 68] for the fermion case). The negativity is finally obtained as [76, 77]\nE = lim ne\u21921 Tr(\u03c1TBAB) ne , (3.2)\ni.e. by taking the analytic continuation from the even sequence of replicas, n = ne. Z\u0302n can be further factorised using the replica diagonalisation, such that it becomes the product of n single-replica U(1) charged partition functions, similarly to what has been done for Zn in\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nthe previous section, but with some differences. Let us focus on even n = ne, which is the only necessary object to compute the negativity (instead for the negativity spectrum, i.e. the spectrum of \u03c1TBAB also odd values of n matters [68, 78], as well as for other entanglement witnesses [79, 80]). The needed charged partition Z\u03021(\u03b1) has twisting phases equal to ei\u03b1 in A and ei(\u03c0\u2212\u03b1) in B, i.e. it reads [67, 72]\nZ\u03021(\u03b1) = \u30080|ei\u03b1QAe\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QB |0\u3009 . (3.3)\nThe operator ei\u03b1QA implements the U(1) symmetry restricted to A, while e\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QB inverts the flux (\u03b1\u2192 \u2212\u03b1) and it introduces an additional phases \u22121 alongB, which is the combined net effect of the partial transpose operation (or, equivalently, partial time reversal) on fermionic systems. The final result of this approach is that the ne-th R\u00e9nyi negativity can be computed as\nEne \u2261 logTr ( |\u03c1TBAB| ne ) = logTr ( (\u03c1TBAB) ne ) = ne\u22121 2\u2211 p=\u2212ne\u221212 log Z\u03021(\u03b1 = 2\u03c0p/ne) Z\u03021(0) .

(3.4) with (3.5) holds for a generic tripartite fermionic system with no assumption. To proceed for the calculation of the wire junction we restrict to the following specific situation:\n\u2022 MA,MB,MC = 1, so that the total number of wires is M = 3.\n\u2022 S is not only unitary but also Hermitian, which means that S2 = 1 and its eigenvalues can be just \u00b11. For some physical systems (including the Schrodinger junction in the next section), the hermiticity of the S matrix is a necessary condition for physical consistency. Hence this is not at all a very restrictive assumption.\nWith these working assumptions it is possible to obtain nice analytic results in a rather compact form. More general expressions (e.g. for more wires) can also be obtained, but at the price of more cumbersome computations and less intelligible final results without any major physical insight.\nIt is clear from eq. (3.5) that for M = 3 the key object to be evaluated is\n\u30080| exp ( \u2212iSjj\u2032\u03a8 j k\u03a8\u2020 j\u2032 k ) qL0+L\u03040ei\u03b1QA\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QB exp ( iSjj\u2032\u03a8\u2020 j \u2212k\u03a8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) |0\u3009\n= det 1 + q2kS  SAA \u2212e \u2212i2\u03b1SAB e \u2212i\u03b1SAC\n\u2212ei2\u03b1SBA SBB \u2212ei\u03b1SBC ei\u03b1SCA \u2212e\u2212i\u03b1SCB SCC\n  , (3.6)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwhere we used the commutation relations between qL0+L\u03040ei\u03b1QA\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QB and the fields (see eq. (2.30)), and the formula (A.10), which provides the vacuum expectation value. The determinant of the 3\u00d7 3 matrix appearing in (3.6) can be evaluated directly, but it is useful to discuss first the constraints due to the unitarity of S. We define the matrix O as\nO = S  SAA \u2212e \u2212i2\u03b1SAB e\n\u2212i\u03b1SAC \u2212ei2\u03b1SBA SBB \u2212ei\u03b1SBC ei\u03b1SCA \u2212e\u2212i\u03b1SCB SCC  , (3.7) and we verify the following properties:\n\u2022 O is unitary (OO\u2020 = 1) and its eigenvalues are phases;\n\u2022 det(O) = 1 and the product of the eigenvalues is 1;\n\u2022 O = SO\u2020S and the spectrum of O is thus invariant under complex conjugation, a feature that relies on our hermiticity assumption S = S\u2020.\nThese properties imply that the spectrum of O has to take this form\nSpec (O) = {1, ei\u03b1\u0302\u2032 , e\u2212i\u03b1\u0302\u2032}, (3.8)\nwith \u03b1\u0302\u2032 a real parameter depending on S and \u03b1, defined by the following property\n2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032 + 1 = Tr(O), (3.9)\nwhich is a consequence of eq. (3.8). The determinant det(1 + q2kO) can be thus computed taking the product over the eigenvalues of O as follows\ndet ( 1+q2kO ) = (1 + q2k)(1 + q2kei\u03b1\u0302\u2032)(1 + q2ke\u2212i\u03b1\u0302\u2032) = (1 + q2k)(1 + q2k(Tr(O)\u2212 1) + q4k). (3.10) Evaluating Tr(O) and using again the unitarity of S, we can rewrite eq. (3.10) as\ndet ( 1 + q2kO ) = (1 + q2k)(1 + 2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032q2k + q4k), (3.11)\nand the explicit expression of \u03b1\u0302\u2032 as a function of the S matrix is\n2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032 = \u22121+S2AA+S2BB +S2CC +(\u22121\u2212S2CC +S2BB +S2AA) cos(2\u03b1)+2(S2BB\u2212S2AA) cos\u03b1. (3.12) Notice that \u03b1\u0302\u2032 does only depend on the diagonal entries of the matrix S and on the flux \u03b1. Putting all the pieces together, we express the partition function Z\u03021(\u03b1) as\nZ\u03021(\u03b1) = \u220f\nk\u2208N\u22121/2 (1 + q2k)2(1 + 2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032q2k + q4k)2. (3.13)\nWe find the same formal structure of the partition function which appeared for the R\u00e9nyi entropies in eq. (2.34), up to the replacement \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 \u03b1\u0302\u2032. Analogously to eq. (2.42), for L/ 1, we have\nlog Z\u03021(\u03b1) Z\u03021(0)\n' \u2212 ( \u03b1\u0302\u2032\n2\u03c0\n)2 log L\n\u03b5 , (3.14)\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwith \u03b1\u0302\u2032 given by eq. (3.12), which is the main result of this section. Indeed, by plugging this result into eq. (3.4), we obtain the R\u00e9nyi negativities\nEne = \u2212 (\n1 4\u03c02 (ne\u22121)/2\u2211 p=\u2212(ne\u22121)/2 arccos2 ( S2CC + (\u22121\u2212 S2CC + S2BB + S2AA) cos(2\u03c0p/ne)2\n+(S2BB \u2212 S2AA) cos(2\u03c0p/ne) ))\nlog L \u03b5 . (3.15)\nWe conclude this subsection by providing few simple consistency checks for \u03b1\u0302\u2032 in some limits. If the wire C is decoupled from the other two, then S2CC = 1 and the transmission probability between A and B is 1\u2212 S2AA = 1\u2212 S2BB. In that case\n2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032 = 2S2AA \u2212 2(1\u2212 S2AA) cos(2\u03b1). (3.16)\nThis value of \u03b1\u0302\u2032 is the same one would obtain for \u03b1\u2032 in the U(1) partition function of A and B in the presence of a flux \u2212ei2\u03b1 inserted along A. The reason is that in this limit the system becomes invariant under the U(1) symmetry generated by QA +QB and, thanks to\nei\u03b1QA\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QB = e\u2212i(\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)(QB+QA)ei(2\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QA , (3.17)\none recognises an equivalence with the insertion of ei(2\u03b1\u2212\u03c0)QA . Finally, we consider \u03b1 = \u03c0/2 because it corresponds to the evaluation of the 2-R\u00e9nyi negativity (indeed, from eq. (3.4), E2 = log(Z\u03021(\u03c0/2)Z\u03021(\u2212\u03c0/2)/Z\u030221 (0)) = 2 log Z\u03021(\u03c0/2)/Z\u03021(0)). In this case\n2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032 = 2S2CC , (3.18)\nand there is no explicit dependence on SAA, SBB. Now this parameter is the same \u03b1\u2032 one would get in the presence of a flux ei\u03c0/2 along C only. In this way, we reproduced the general identity [76]\nTr (( \u03c1TBAB )2) = Tr((\u03c1AB)2), (3.19) which is the well known relation between the 2-R\u00e9nyi negativity and the 2-R\u00e9nyi entropy."

Through some simple trigonometric identities, this leads to an analytic continuation of the integrand.\n\u2022 The final result is an integral, which represents our analytic continuation.\nAs aforementioned, using the trigonometric identities studied in the appendix A.4, we find\n(1 + 2 cos \u03b1\u0302\u2032t+ t2) = (\ncos(\u03b1) + b\u2212 \u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2c\n)( c cos(\u03b1) + b+\n\u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2\n) , (3.21)\nwith a, b, c being the following functions of the S matrix and t\na = 1 + 2S2CCt+ t2, b = 2(S2BB \u2212 S2AA)t, c = 2(S2AA + S2BB \u2212 S2CC \u2212 1)t. (3.22)\nUsing the integral representation for the product over the k modes in the limit q \u2192 1 reported in A.3, we get\nEne = ne\u22121 2\u2211 p=\u2212ne\u221212 log Z\u03021(\u03b1) Z\u03021(0) = log(L/\u03b5)2\u03c02 \u222b 1 0 dt t\n\u00d7 ne\u22121 2\u2211 p=\u2212ne\u221212\n[ log ( cos(2\u03c0p/ne) + b\u2212 \u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2c )\n\u00d7 ( c cos(2\u03c0p/ne) + b+ \u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2 ) \u2212 2 log(1 + t) ]\n= log(L/\u03b5) \u03c02 \u222b 1 0 dt t\n\u00d7 log ((x1 \u2212\n\u221a \u2212c2 + x21)ne/2 + (x1 + \u221a \u2212c2 + x21)ne/2)((x2 \u2212 \u221a \u22121 + x22)ne/2 + (x2 + \u221a \u22121 + x22)ne/2)\n2ne(1 + t)ne (3.23)\nwhere x1 = b+ \u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2 , x2 = b\u2212 \u221a b2 \u2212 4ac 2c .

At this point, the negativity is simply obtained by taking ne \u2192 1:\nE = log(L/\u03b5) \u03c02 \u222b 1 0 dt t\n\u00d7 log ((x1 \u2212\n\u221a \u2212c2 + x21)1/2 + (x1 + \u221a \u2212c2 + x21)1/2)((x2 \u2212 \u221a \u22121 + x22)1/2 + (x2 + \u221a \u22121 + x22)1/2)\n2(1 + t) .\n(3.25)\nLet us conclude this section by providing some useful cross-checks of our result. In the limit in which S2CC = 1, the wire C decouples and one recovers the result for two wires,\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwhich is given by the R\u00e9nyi entropy with n = 1/2 (A and B now form a pure state) [54]. In this case, eq. (3.23) simplifies as\nE = 1 \u03c02 \u222b 1 0 dt t log ( 1 + 2 \u221a t \u221a 1\u2212 S2AA 1 + t ) = 1 \u03c02 arcsin (\u221a 1\u2212 S2AA )( \u03c0 \u2212 arcsin \u221a 1\u2212 S2AA ) . (3.26) Performing the change of variables t = e\u22122x, one can recover the result (in the integral form) for the R\u00e9nyi 1/2 obtained in [29] or, by solving the integral, the result for the negativity between two CFTs in [54], with s = \u221a 1\u2212 S2AA."

The M wires are decoupled everywhere but in the vertex of the graph and their mixing is described by a non-trivial scattering matrix. We consider the ground state of such system with N particles. The same system has been studied in ref. [29] by the overlap matrix approach [49, 82] which is the starting point of our analysis. Each point of the junction is parametrised by a pair\n(x, j), x \u2208 [0, L], j = 1, . . . ,M, (4.1)\nwhere j is the index identifying the wire and x > 0 the spatial coordinate along the wire.

To fully specify the problem, we also need to impose boundary conditions at the external edges of each wire that generically take the form\n(\u2202x\u03a8i)(L) = \u00b5i\u03a8i(L), (4.6)\nwhere \u00b5i are again real parameters with the dimension of mass. In order to simplify the treatment, it is possible to diagonalise S via a unitary transformation U and its eigenvalues are just \u00b11. It is custom [43, 44] to introduce a set of unphysical fields {\u03d5j(x)}\n\u03a8i(x) = M\u2211 j=1 Uij\u03d5j(x), (4.7)\nso that in terms of these \u03d5j(x), the boundary conditions decouple as\n\u2202x\u03d5i(0) = \u03b7i\u03d5i(0), \u2202x\u03d5i(L) = \u00b5\u2032i\u03d5i(L),\n(4.8)\nwhere the \u00b5\u2032i\u2019s are linear function of the \u00b5i\u2019s whose form is irrelevant. For the junction to be scale-invariant, we require each of the dimensionful parameters \u03b7i and \u00b5i to be either 0 or \u221e. The choice corresponds to either Neumann (\u2202x\u03d5i = 0) or Dirichlet (\u03d5i = 0) boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L. We impose Dirichlet boundary conditions (\u00b5i = \u221e) at x = L for all wires. Conversely, the values of \u03b7i being 0 or\u221e depends on the diagonalisation of the S matrix, see [29, 43, 44]. Hence, the unphysical fields \u03d5j(x) have Dirichlet bc\u2019s at x = L and either (Neumann or Dirichlet) at x = 0, so that it is natural to use the short-hand notation\nND Neumann-Dirichlet, DD Dirichlet-Dirichlet, (4.9)\nto refer to the two possibbilities.

[83, 84]), it is more convenient to work with a finite-dimensional representation of such correlation. In this subsection we derive a representation which is particularly useful for numerical applications and it is equivalent to the overlap matrix approach [49]. The main result can be read in eq. (4.28). Hereafter, we set L = 1 without loss of generality. We start noticing that Cij(x, y) can be thought as an operator acting on the Hilbert space CM\u2297L2([0, 1]), with CM representing the space of the wires and L2([0, 1]) being the one of wave-functions on [0, 1]. Although L2([0, 1]) is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, both CND and CDD are projectors acting non-trivially only in a finite-dimension subspace H0. We can choose the following basis for H0\nen \u2261 \u03c6DD(n, x), 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N\u03c6ND(n\u2212N, x), 1 +N \u2264 n \u2264 2N, (4.15) which is not orthonormal.

            "text": "A useful auxiliary quantity for the computation of the entanglement entropy and negativity is the matrix \u0393 = 1 \u2212 2C (sometimes referred to as covariance matrix). Using eq. (4.13) and the finite-dimensional representation of the correlation matrix in the previous section, we can express it as\n1\u2212 \u03932 = 4C(1\u2212 C) = (1\u2212 S2)\u2297 (CND \u2212 CDD)2. (4.29)\nWhen \u0393 refers to the entire system, given that S2 = 1, it is zero in the \u201cwire space\u201d. However, eq. (4.29) has a very convenient form for the restriction of \u0393 to a subsystem A made of MA wires because of the tensor product structure in internal and spatial coordinates. It is in fact enough to replace S \u2192 SAA, i.e. the projected S-matrix to obtain \u0393AA, the covariance matrix restricted to the subsystem of interest:\n1\u2212 \u03932AA = (1\u2212 S2AA)\u2297 (CND \u2212 CDD)2, (4.30)\nwith SAA being a MA \u00d7MA matrix. In general 1 \u2212 S2AA \u2265 0, and so 1 \u2212 \u03932AA is positive semidefinite. We recall that the matrix representation for (CND \u2212 CDD)2 is\n(CND \u2212 CDD)2 = (\n1\u2212QQ\u2020 0 0 1\u2212Q\u2020Q\n) . (4.31)\nSince 1 \u2212 QQ\u2020 and 1 \u2212 Q\u2020Q have the same spectrum, the spectrum of (CND \u2212 CDD)2 is obtained by two copies of the spectrum of 1\u2212QQ\u2020. To start, let us recover the results [29] for the case when A is a single wire. First, taking M = 2 and the completely transmissive S-matrix\nS = (\n0 1 1 0\n) , (4.32)\nthe correlation function of a single wire A satisfies\n1\u2212 \u03932AA = (CND \u2212 CDD)2. (4.33)\nThe spectral properties of 1\u2212 \u03932AA are then the one of a gas on the line [\u2212L,L] bipartite as A = [0, L] and B = [\u2212L, 0]. For a generic S-matrix of two wires [19, 43]\nS = (\u221a\n1\u2212 |s|2 sei\u03c6 s\u0304e\u2212i\u03c6 \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 |s|2\n) , (4.34)\n\u0393AA is 1\u2212 \u03932AA = |s|2(CND \u2212 CDD)2, (4.35)\nand so the eigenvalues of 1\u2212\u03932AA are just rescaled by a factor |s|2, in agreement with what known [29] from the overlap matrix. In the case of A being one of theM wires in a junction, in the above equation is enough to replace s with the transmission coefficient of A.\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nOnce the covariance matrix \u0393AA is known, the entanglement R\u00e9nyi entropy is [85]\nSn(A) = 1 1\u2212 nTr log ((1 + \u0393AA 2 )n + (1\u2212 \u0393AA 2 )n) = \u2211 Ta Sn,Ta , (4.36)\nUsing the basic property about the spectrum of a tensor product\nSpec(X \u2297 Y ) = {xiyj}ij , xi \u2208 Spec(X), yj \u2208 Spec(Y ), (4.37)\nwe get that the R\u00e9nyi entropy between A and the complementary wires B is\nSn(A) = \u2211 Ta Sn,Ta , (4.38)\nwhere the Ta\u2019s are the eigenvalues of 1\u2212 S2AA, which play the role of a transmission probability, and Sn,Ta is the R\u00e9nyi entropy of a single wire with transmission probability Ta. This analytic results for the microscopic model perfectly match eq. (2.43) in CFT. We also notice that the relation Sn(A) = Sn(B) comes from the fact that 1 \u2212 S2AA and 1 \u2212 S2BB have the same non-zero spectrum (i.e., the same eigenvalues up to the vanishing ones). To conclude this subsection, we present a numerical test for the validity of the CFT result for the logarithmic scaling of the R\u00e9nyi entropy. Since the case of A consisting of a single wire has been discussed and tested in ref. [29], we focus here on a four-wire junction and the subsystem A consisting of two wires. The S matrix is chosen of the form\nS = U  \u2212 \u221a 1\u2212 s2 \u2212s 0 0 \u2212s \u221a 1\u2212 s2 0 0\n0 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0 1\nU\u22121, U = \n1 0 0 0 0 \u2212 cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 sin2 \u03b8 0 sin \u03b8 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 0 0 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8  . (4.39)\nHere \u03b8 is a parameter which controls the mixing between the two pairs of wires. The numerical results are reported in figure 3 finding a perfect agreement with CFT."

The covariance matrix \u0393A\u222aB has the natural block form\n\u0393A\u222aB = (\n\u0393AA \u0393AB \u0393BA \u0393BB\n) , (4.43)\nfrom which we construct the matrix [67, 69]\n\u0393\u00d7A\u222aB \u2261 2\n1 + \u03932A\u222aB\n( \u2212\u0393AA 0\n0 \u0393BB\n) . (4.44)\nThe latter matrix \u0393\u00d7A\u222aB is the crucial object to write the R\u00e9nyi negativities Ene which indeed are [67]\nEne \u2261 logTr (|\u03c1A\u222aB|ne)\n= Tr log (1 + \u0393\u00d7A\u222aB 2 )ne/2 + ( 1\u2212 \u0393\u00d7A\u222aB 2 )ne/2 + ne2 Tr log ((1 + \u0393A\u222aB 2 )2 + (1\u2212 \u0393A\u222aB 2 )2) , (4.45)\nThe above equation is valid for arbitrary real ne (i.e. also for a non-even integer) and so the negativity E is obtained just by taking ne = 1. Eq. (4.45) gives the R\u00e9nyi negativities in terms of the correlation matrices that, once numerically evaluated, provides a test of the CFT results for the coefficient of the logarithm obtained in section 3. For the numerical evaluation, we focus on a three-wire junction and\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\nFigure 4. The coefficient of the logarithmic term of the negativity between two wires (A and B) as a function of \u03b8, with fixed s = 0.75. The solid line corresponds to eq.

(4.46) We select as subsystems A and B the first two wires and compute numerically the R\u00e9nyi negativity for several values of s, \u03b8, and N . In figure 4 we reported the coefficient of the logarithm obtained as follows. We fixed s = 0.75 and we selected some values of \u03b8; for each value of (s, \u03b8), we calculated numerically the negativity, for several values of N up to 200. We fitted the obtained numerical results with a logN+b0 +b1N\u22121. Figure 4 finally reports the best fit of a as a function of theta and compares it to the corresponding analytic result in eq. (3.23), finding perfect agreement. We comment that under the parametrisation of the scattering matrix in eq. (4.46), the angle \u03b8 mixes the first two wires with the last one. Therefore, the behaviour as a function of \u03b8 reported in figure 4 can be understood as follows: for \u03b8 = 0 the third wire is decoupled, as can be deduced from eq. (4.46), hence \u03c1A\u222aB is a pure state and the negativity gives precisely the n-th R\u00e9nyi entropy with n = 1/2 [69]. This confirms what we already found in eq. (3.26). The other extremal value is \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, when the second wire is decoupled and the negativity vanishes identically since there is no entanglement between A and B. To conclude, in figure 5 we report the N dependence of the R\u00e9nyi negativity and we benchmark the prefactor of the logarithmic term in eq. (3.23) for different pairs (s, \u03b8) and different replica indices ne."

(3.23).\nMA = MB = 1) to evaluate the R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropies for arbitrary MA. In terms of the wire length L, the resulting R\u00e9nyi entropy is\nSn(A) = Cn(SAA) log L\n\u03b5 +O(1), (5.1)\nwhere Cn(SAA) has been explicitly calculated and turns out to depend only on the scattering matrix reduced to the subsystem A, denoted by SAA. One interesting aspect of our result is that the Sn(A) is the sum of MA independent contributions which have the form of R\u00e9nyi entropies of a single wire with a transmission probability given by the eigenvalues of 1\u2212 |SAA|2 (see eq. (2.39)). We obtained the same result also for a microscopical model of a free Fermi gas on a star junction. To do so, we generalised the approach of ref. [29] for MA = 1 to the case of a subsystem A made of more wires. Such generalisation also provided numerical tests for the correctness of the CFT prediction. We then moved to the study of the entanglement between two edges embedded in a multi-terminal junction, considering the fermionic negativity E of ref. [67]. To this aim, we adapted the CFT formalism above to the computation of the R\u00e9nyi negativities between two wires of a tripartite geometry. As for the entanglement entropies, we found that the negativity grows logarithmically with the system size L, with a prefactor that depends on the details of the junction. Also the negativity has been explicitly constructed and analysed for a free Fermi gas on a star junction, finding results fully compatible with the CFT. We stress that our results apply to some different physical situations, too. For example, our predictions are expected to hold also for lattice models of free fermions, in particular for M tight binding chains of length L joined at a single common vertex (as, e.g., done in [30] for M = 2). Furthermore, the logarithmic prefactors we obtained for entropy and negativity should appear also in the study of a star junction of M infinite CFT, but when the subsystems consist of segments of length ` starting from the interface. We conclude the manuscript discussing few outlooks. The main focus of this work has been the free-fermion CFT, but our formalism can be easily adapted to free complex boson too, to study, e.g., the entanglement entropy and negativity across junctions of harmonic\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nchains. The same formalism can be further applied to the study of some out-of-equilibrium protocols for free CFTs in the presence of defects (see, e.g., [22, 31, 54, 86]). Another interesting open problem is the generalisation to other CFTs such as the compact boson, WZW models (see [35] for the interfaces of WZW), or minimal models. In all those cases we do not expect any kind of replica diagonalisation, due to the lack of Gaussian measures, but still one could employ the replica construction to investigate the negativity, as well as other entanglement measures."

(A.1)\nHere \u03c8j\u2213k is the creation/annihilation operator of a Majorana fermion in the k-th left mode of the j-th species (among the M ones), while \u03c8\u0304j\u2213k is the corresponding right mover. Ojj\u2032 and O\u2032jj\u2032 are M \u00d7M matrices and the sum over j, j\u2032 is implicit. Before proving eq. (A.1) in the most general case, we highlight simple cases in which it holds. Let us suppose there is just one species of fermions, so that we can suppress the indices j, j\u2032 and the matrices O and O\u2032 become numbers. Using that the annihilation operators annihilate the vacuum, that the fermionic operators square to zero, and applying Wick theorem, one gets\n\u30080| exp ( O\u2032\u03c8k\u03c8\u0304k ) exp ( O\u03c8\u0304\u2212k\u03c8\u2212k ) |0\u3009 = \u30080| ( 1 +O\u2032\u03c8k\u03c8\u0304k ) ( 1 +O\u03c8\u0304\u2212k\u03c8\u2212k ) |0\u3009\n= \u30080| 1 +O\u2032O\u03c8k\u03c8\u0304k\u03c8\u0304\u2212k\u03c8\u2212k |0\u3009 = 1 +O\u2032O. (A.2)\nSimilarly, when O and O\u2032 commute, one can diagonalise them simultaneously and apply the previous consideration to show eq. (A.1). We provide a general proof of eq. (A.1) using Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables (whose basic properties can be found on [87]). We start by representing the Gaussian operators as integrals over Grassmann variables. In particular, for each j-th Dirac fermionic field we associate a pair of Grassmann variables \u03b7j , \u03b7\u0304j , and we express the Gaussian operator exp ( Ojj\u2032\u03c8\u0304j\u2212k\u03c8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) as follows\nexp ( Ojj\u2032\u03c8\u0304j\u2212k\u03c8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) = \u222b d\u03b7d\u03b7\u0304 exp ( \u2212\u03b7j \u03b7\u0304j + \u03b7jOjj\u2032\u03c8j \u2032 \u2212k + \u03c8\u0304 j \u2212k\u03b7\u0304j ) , (A.3)\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwhere the sums over j and j\u2032 are implicit. Similarly, we introduce a pair of Grassmann variables \u03b8j , \u03b8\u0304j to each species j and we express exp ( O\u2032jj\u2032\u03c8 j k\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 k ) as\nexp ( O\u2032jj\u2032\u03c8 j k\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 k ) = \u222b d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304 exp ( \u2212\u03b8\u0304j\u03b8j + \u03c8jkO \u2032 jj\u2032\u03b8j\u2032 + \u03b8\u0304j\u03c8\u0304 j k ) . (A.4)\nUsing the relations (A.3) and (A.4) we write the product of the two Gaussian operators as follows\n\u30080| exp ( O\u2032jj\u2032\u03c8 j k\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 k ) exp ( Ojj\u2032\u03c8\u0304j\u2212k\u03c8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) |0\u3009\n= \u222b d\u03b7d\u03b7\u0304d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304 exp ( \u2212\u03b7j \u03b7\u0304j \u2212 \u03b8\u0304j\u03b8j ) \u30080| exp ( \u03b8\u0304j\u03c8\u0304 j k ) exp ( \u03c8\u0304j\u2212k\u03b7\u0304j ) |0\u3009 \u30080| exp ( \u03c8jkO \u2032 jj\u2032\u03b8j\u2032 ) exp ( \u03b7jOjj\u2032\u03c8j \u2032 \u2212k ) |0\u3009\n= \u222b d\u03b7d\u03b7\u0304d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304 exp ( \u2212\u03b7j \u03b7\u0304j \u2212 \u03b8\u0304j\u03b8j + \u03b8\u0304j \u03b7\u0304j \u2212 \u03b7j(OO\u2032)jj\u2032\u03b8j\u2032 ) .\n(A.5)\nThe last step is the evaluation of the Gaussian integral over the 4M Grassmann variables \u03b7j , \u03b7\u0304j , \u03b8j , \u03b8\u0304j . We introduce a 4M -dimensional vector \u0398 of Grassmann variables as follows\n\u0398 =  \u03b7 \u03b8\u0304 \u03b7\u0304\n\u03b8  , (A.6) and the Gaussian integral in (A.5) as\n\u30080| exp ( O\u2032jj\u2032\u03c8 j k\u03c8\u0304 j\u2032 k ) exp ( Ojj\u2032\u03c8\u0304j\u2212k\u03c8 j\u2032 \u2212k ) |0\u3009 = \u222b d\u0398 exp ( \u221212\u0398 T O\u0303\u0398 ) , (A.7)\nwith O\u0303 being the following 4M \u00d7 4M matrix\nO\u0303 =  0 0 1 OO\u2032 0 0 \u22121 1 \u22121 1 0 0\n\u2212(OO\u2032)T \u22121 0 0  . (A.8) The integral over \u0398 in eq. (A.7) gives the Pfaffian of the matrix O\u0303 [87], which we write as\nPf ( O\u0303 ) = det1/2 ( O\u0303 ) = det (\n1 OO\u2032 \u22121 1\n) = det(1 +O\u2032O). (A.9)\nThis completes the proof of eq. (A.1), which is the main result of this section.\nA.2 A useful determinant\nIn this section we show that for a complex unitary M \u00d7M matrix S having the block structure (2.26) the following relation holds\ndet ((\n1 0 0 1\n) + q2k ( S\u2020AA S \u2020 BA\nS\u2020AB S \u2020 BB\n)( SAA e\n\u2212i\u03b1SAB ei\u03b1SBA SBB )) = det ( 1 + 2(S\u2020AASAA + (1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos\u03b1)q 2k + q4k ) (1 + q2k)M\u22122MA . (A.10)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nBefore proceeding with the proof, we notice that the \u03b1 dependence in the r.h.s. above is related only to the non-zero eigenvalues of 1 \u2212 S\u2020AASAA. Despite the explicit dependence of 1\u2212 S\u2020AASAA on A, this fact does not lead to any asymmetry between A and B. Indeed, the unitarity of S, SS\u2020 = S\u2020S = 1, implies\nSBBS \u2020 BB + SBAS \u2020 BA = 1, S \u2020 AASAA + S \u2020 BASBA = 1. (A.11)\nHence 1 \u2212 SBBS\u2020BB = SBAS \u2020 BA and 1 \u2212 S \u2020 AASAA = S \u2020 BASBA have the same spectrum, up to zero eigenvalues, which means that (A.10) is symmetric by exchanging A\u2194 B. In order to prove eq. (A.10), we introduce a M \u00d7M matrix O as follows\nO = ( S\u2020AA S \u2020 BA\nS\u2020AB S \u2020 BB\n)( SAA e\n\u2212i\u03b1SAB ei\u03b1SBA SBB\n) , (A.12)\nso that eq. (A.10) requires the evaluation of det ( 1 + q2kO ) . Since, as a consequence of the unitarity of S, O is unitary and it has the same spectrum of O\u2020, we can write\ndet ( 1 + q2kO ) = \u221a det (1 + q2kO) det (1 + q2kO\u2020) = \u221a det (1 + q2k(O +O\u2020) + q4k).\n(A.13) Exploiting the unitarity of S, O +O\u2020 has a block diagonal structure given by\nO+O\u2020 = ( 2S\u2020AASAA + 2(1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos\u03b1 0\n0 2S\u2020BBSBB + 2(1\u2212 S \u2020 BBSBB) cos\u03b1\n) . (A.14)\nSince we have already shown that 1\u2212 S\u2020AASAA, 1\u2212 S \u2020 BBSBB have the same non-zero spectrum, we get\ndet ( 1 + q2kO ) \u221d det ( 1 + q2k(2S\u2020AASAA + 2(1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos\u03b1) + q 4k ) , (A.15)\nThe \u03b1-independent proportionality constant has to be a power of (1 + q2k), which comes form the possible presence of zero eigenvalues of 1\u2212S\u2020AASAA (or 1\u2212S \u2020 BBSBB). We match\nthis constant by power counting. More precisely, since det ( 1 + q2kO ) is a polynomial in q2k of order M and\ndet ( 1 + q2k(2S\u2020AASAA + 2(1\u2212 S \u2020 AASAA) cos\u03b1) + q 4k )\n(A.16)\nis a polynomial in q2k of order 2MA, the right power of (1 + q2k) which matches the proportionality constant has to be (1+ q2k)M\u22122MA . This concludes the proof of eq. (A.10).\nA.3 Jacobi Theta functions and dilogarithm\nHere we review some properties of the Jacobi Theta functions and the dilogarithm, useful for the evaluation of the partition functions. We consider the following infinite product representation for the Jacobi theta function \u03b83(z, q) [81]\n\u03b83(z, q) = \u221e\u220f m=1 ( 1\u2212 q2m ) ( 1 + 2 cos(2\u03c0z)q2m\u22121 + q4m\u22122 ) . (A.17)\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nWe want to evaluate \u03b83(z, q)/\u03b83(0, q) in the limit q \u2192 1\u2212. To do so, we first take its logarithm, which turns the infinite product representation into a sum, i.e.\nlog \u03b83(z, q) \u03b83(0, q) = \u221e\u2211 m=1 [ log(1 + ei2\u03c0zq2m\u22121) + log(1 + e\u2212i2\u03c0zq2m\u22121)\u2212 2 log(1 + q2m\u22121) ] .\n(A.18) For q ' 1, qm goes to zero slowly as m grows and the sum can be approximated (') by an integral\nlog \u03b83(z, q) \u03b83(0, q)\n' \u222b \u221e\n0 dx [log(1 + ei2\u03c0zq1+2x) + log(1 + e\u2212i2\u03c0zq1+2x)\u2212 2 log(1 + q1+2x)]\n= \u2212 12 log q \u222b 1 0 dt t [log(1 + ei2\u03c0zt) + log(1 + e\u2212i2\u03c0zt)\u2212 2 log(1 + t)]\n= 12 log q ( Li2(\u2212ei2\u03c0z) + Li2(\u2212e\u2212i2\u03c0z)\u2212 2Li2(\u22121) ) = (2\u03c0z) 2 4 log q . (A.19)\nIn the previous computation, the integral representation of the dilogarithm function [81]\nLi2(z) = \u2212 \u222b 1\n0\ndt\nt log(1\u2212 zt) (A.20)\nhas been employed, together with the property\nLi2(\u2212ei2\u03c0z) + Li2(\u2212e\u2212i2\u03c0z) = \u2212 \u03c02 6 + (2\u03c0z)2 2 , (A.21)\nvalid for z \u2208 [\u22121/2, 1/2].\nA.4 Trigonometric identities\nWe consider some useful algebraic identities which will be applied for the analytical continuation of the R\u00e9nyi negativity. The first identity, which holds for any n \u2208 N is\nn\u22121 2\u220f\np=\u2212n\u221212\n(x+ ei2\u03c0p/ny) = xn + yn, (A.22)\nwhich can be proved through an explicit factorisation of the polynomial xn + yn in the variable x. From the previous identity one easily deduces (see also [81])\nn\u22121 2\u220f\np=\u2212n\u221212\n( x2 + 2 cos 2\u03c0p\nn xy + y2\n) = n\u22121 2\u220f\np=\u2212n\u221212\n(x+ ei2\u03c0p/ny) n\u22121 2\u220f p=\u2212n\u221212 (x+ e\u2212i2\u03c0p/ny)\n= (xn + yn)2. (A.23)\nThe last non-trivial identity we need is ne\u22121\n2\u220f p=\u2212ne\u221212 ( x+ cos 2\u03c0p ne y ) = (x+\u221ax2 \u2212 y2 2 )ne/2 + ( x\u2212 \u221a x2 \u2212 y2 2 )ne/22 , (A.24)\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 7 1\nwhich holds for even ne.

(A.26) The solution to the previous system is (up to x1 \u2194 y1) x21 = x+ \u221a x2 \u2212 y2 2 ,\ny21 = x\u2212 \u221a x2 \u2212 y2 2 .\n(A.27)\nIf ne is even, we can write xne1 = ( x21 )ne/2, replace x1 as a function of x, y (similarly for y1), employ eq. (A.23), obtaining (A.24). We conclude this appendix with a straightforward consequence of (A.24), which is the evaluation of the product ne\u22121\n2\u220f p=\u2212ne\u221212 ( x+ cos 2\u03c0p ne y + cos2 2\u03c0p ne z ) . (A.28)\nSince the term in the parenthesis is a second order polynomial in cos 2\u03c0pne , it can be factorised in the two roots and eq. (A.24) can be used for the computation of each of the two products in which it splits.\nOpen Access.
