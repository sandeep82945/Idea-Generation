            "text": "The transition from fossil fuel to green fuel depends on the ability to bridge the gap of renewable energy intermittency through sustainable energy storage systems. Mg\u2013S batteries are an attractive option due to their low cost, environmental sustainability, and abundant magnesium and sulfur in the Earth's crust. In addition, Mg\u2013S batteries offer competitive theoretical energy density (1684 W h kg\u22121 and 3286 W h L\u22121) and safety (dendrite less) over their Li counterparts. However, there are technical challenges like the poor cyclability, the shuttle effect of polysuldes, and the highly resistive passive anode/electrolyte interface that must be overcome before the practical transition from the lab to the market.1 BaTiO3 possesses a piezoelectric property, generating electrostatic charges on the surface under electrochemical stress. This property gives BaTiO3 the ability to immobilize the polar polysulde molecules via chemical adsorption, reducing polysulde shuttling and improving the cycle life of Mg\u2013S cells.2,3,4 The electrolyte controls the electrochemical activity, safety stability, and thermodynamics of the batteries. Therefore, designing an efficient magnesium electrolyte compatible with sulfur's electrophilic nature will be essential to achieving a practical Mg\u2013S\nenha University, 13518, Benha, Egypt.\neijing, P. R. China\n89\nbattery. In this regard, non-nucleophilic electrolytes were designed, including hexamethyldisilazide-Br,5 non-nucleophilic Mg(TFSI)2\u2013MgCl2\u20131,2-dimethoxyethane/tetrahydrofuran,6 magnesium tetrakis(hexauoroisopropyloxy)borate,7 magnesium peruorinated tert-butoxide (Mg(pb)2),8 Mg[B(Ohp)4]2.9 Nevertheless, the common factors of the most weakly coordinating Mg salts are the low stability, high cost, and complex synthesis process, that impede their practical applications. In our previous research,10 we reported a simple halogen-free electrolyte (HFE) 0.69 M Mg(NO3)2$6H2O in ACN : G4 (\u223c2 : 1) with ionic conductivity of \u223c10\u22124 S cm\u22121 at 313 K, dendrite-free, and translucent Mg deposits. However, much work need to be dedicated to lowering the Mg2+ desolvation energy and reducing the Mg stripping/plating overpotential. Ethylene carbonate (EC) organic cosolvent is commonly used to tailor the interfacial kinetics and the transport properties of the electrolyte and played a vital role in the commercialization of lithium-ion batteries. The high dielectric constant of EC grants it the ability to dissociate metal salt and engineer the solid anode/ electrolyte interphase.11,12 Herein, we study for the rst time the benecial effects of the interplay between HFE and EC additive and how it affects the Mg2+ desolvation energy. The study was revealed by UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Galvanostatic cycling was conducted on the Mg/Mg symmetric battery with the HFE_EC electrolyte to test the change of the overpotential with introduction of EC.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The study conrms the impact of EC additive to regulate the electrochemical performance of the HFE via modulating Mg2+ desolvation barrier but it results in undesirable SEI which causes high Mg stripping/plating overpotential."

Fig. 1d\u2013f shows the UV-visible absorption spectrum of HFE_xEC electrolytes in the 200\u2013 1100 nm range. The band gap energy Eg was estimated using Tauc's relation:16 ahn = b[hn \u2212 Eg]n, Fig. 1d displays the direct electronic transition prole of hn versus (ahn)0.5 for HFE_xEC electrolytes. The Eg estimated from the extrapolation of the linear region of the plot on the x-axis (ahn= 0) gives the value of the optical bandgap, Eg. The bandgap was found to be around 3.43 eV of the HFE_xEC electrolytes; hence HFE_xEC shows the difficulty in losing electrons (non-nucleophilic), which makes it a compatible electrolyte with the electrophilic nature of the S8. Fig. 1e displays the extinction coefficient K \u00bc al\n4p\nversus the\nwavelength (l) of HFE_xEC electrolytes. The value of k shows a high dispersion with increasing wavelength in the UV period (200\u2013340 nm) and is followed by a little increase in the visible region. Also, it can be noticed that the value of k relatively increases with increasing EC content. The refractive index (n) is an optical property that measures the change in the velocity of light inside the electrolyte, which can be calculated using the\nequation:17,18 n \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe R\u00de\u00f01 R\u00de \u00fe ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4R \u00f01 R\u00de2 K 2 s , where R = [1\u2212(A +\nT)], A and T are the absorption and transmission coefficient, respectively.

The prole shows increasing the ability of the HFE_xEC mediums to bend the path of the electromagnetic waves with the transition from UV to the visible regions and increasing EC content. This indicates EC's role in changing the optical density and electronic structures of HFE. Fig. 2a shows the Nyquist plots of symmetric stainless steal (SS)//electrolyte//SS coin cell at 303 K. The spectra show an incomplete semicircle at the high-frequency region representing the bulk resistance Rb (due to migration of ions) and bulk capacitance (due to immobile species), whereas the lowfrequency spike is due to the interfacial polarization effect.19 The bulk conductivity was calculated by tting the semicircle curves using ZView soware and substituting in the following eqn: s \u00bc 1 Rb L A , where L and A are the thickness and crosssectional area of separator, respectively.

Relaxation time s was calculated using the relation sumax = 1, where umax is the angular frequency of the maximum 3\n\u2032\u2032. Fig. 2d shows that the relaxation time decreases exponentially with the temperature increase for all concentrations of EC due to the drop in the viscosity. Fig. 2e and f shows the combination of potentiostatic polarization and Cole\u2013Cole plot of symmetrical Mg/HFE/Mg and Mg/HFE_X4/Mg cells. The values of the Mg 2+ transference number tMg2+ was calculated using Bruce\u2013Vincent\u2013 Evans equation: tMg2\u00fe \u00bc Is\u00f0DV R0I0\u00de I0\u00f0DV RsIs\u00de , where Is and I0 are steady and initial state current, respectively, and DV is the applied voltage (0.01 V). The Mg-ion transference tMg2+ values were recorded to be \u223c0.77 and 0.866 for HFE, HFE_X4 electrolytes, respectively. The existence of the slope in the polarization curves is based on the reduction of the electrolyte with the high charge density electrode (Mg metal). Future work is in progress to protect the surface of the Mg anode from direct contact with the electrolyte solution or use functional additives to inhibit this reduction. The oxidative stability (\u22121\u20134.5 V (vs. Mg/Mg2+)) of the HFE and HFE_X4 electrolytes were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in stainless-steel/HFE/Mg and stainless-steel/HFE_X4/Mg cells, Fig. 2g. A small oxidation peak at 3 V emerged in the plasticized electrolyte while the main oxidation potential onset of the plasticized electrolyte shis to higher values >4 V compared with the pristine HFE, which suggests the role of EC in perturbing the bonding scheme of the pristine\nFig. 3 Nyquist plots of a symmetric Mg//electrolytes//Mg cell (303 K) a symmetric Mg//electrolytes//Mg cell before and after SP; (d) stripping/\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Fig. 3a and b show the Nyquist plots of Mg/HFE/Mg and Mg/HFE_X4/Mg cells with different rest time at open circuit voltage. The diameter of the semicircle decreases with an increase in the rest time, then decreases with a further increasing the rest time, and eventually stays at a stable value implying a stable interface between the electrolyte and the Mg-metal electrode. Fig. 3c shows Nyquist plots of symmetric Mg/HFE/Mg andMg/HFE_X4/Mg cells before and aer cycling. The plots were tted using ZView soware with the equivalent circuit shown as inset Fig. 3 and the obtained impedance parameters are listed in Table 1. EIS spectrum before/aer cycling revealed a semicircle with an interface resistance (RSEI) of 34/78 U and a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 10 089/8949 U in the pristine state. However, the cell with modied electrolyte (HFE_X4) possessed clear semicircles before discharge and open semicircle aer discharge and signicantly lower resistances before discharge and higher resistance aer discharge compared with the cell with the pristine electrolyte which conrms that the modied electrolyte decomposed to a resistive SEI.20,21 Fig. 3d shows the plating/ stripping voltage proles of symmetrical Mg/Mg cells using the HFE and HFE_X4 at 0.2 mA cm\n\u22122. Mg/HFE/Mg shows a stable voltage prole with low overpotential compared with symmetric Mg/HFE_X4/Mg cells, which show higher overpotential overgrowing with cycling.

The surface of Mg_HFE_X4 shows high-density thick stick morphology compared with that of Mg/HFE. EDS analysis of bare Mg, Mg_HFE, and Mg/HFE_X4, as shown in Fig. 4c, shows that the spectral line intensity of Mg decreases from high in the bare Mg to 54.7 wt% in the Mg_HFE and further reduces to 24.87 wt% in the Mg/HFE_X4. The results conrm that the nature of the anode/electrolyte interface differs in the presence of EC, which reacts with Mg anode during cycling producing a passive byproduct as mentioned before.

The CV response shows that the cell with HFE_X4 has an observable anodic peak at \u223c2 V and a higher cathodic/anodic current compared with the cell with HFE. However, this behavior conrms that electrolytes decomposed to an unstable SEI. EIS is regarded as one of the most powerful tools to analyze the cathode kinetic performance. The Nyquist plots of Mg/HFE/S and Mg/HFE_X4/S cells before and aer short cycling in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 1 MHz are shown in Fig. 5b.

Thus, we can conclude that the two cells' major discharge/ charge capacity value is due to the electrolyte decomposition. Aiming to improve the cycle life of the developed electrolyte in the Mg\u2013S cells, galvanostatic cycling was considered as a conditioning process to scavenge the active contaminants and partially remove the passivation from the surface of the anode.

XRD pattern of S0 (pristine cathode) shows the main peak locations at 23\u00b0, 25.74\u00b0, 28.58\u00b0, which matches the 222, 026, and 313 reection signals of S8 with orthorhombic S lattice (DB Card No.: 9011362, Fddd: 2), conrming that sulfur is the main constituent of the cathode.24 Aer discharge, all peaks showed intense broadening indicating the formation of an amorphous electrolyte/cathode interface and the reaction of sulfur atoms with Mg2+. Fig. 6b shows the zoomed-in 2q = 23\u00b0 in the pristine state. The peak shied to a low angle aer discharge while it showed further\nFig. 6 (a) The XRD pattern of the pristine sample cathode, after discharge and recharge; (b) zoom in 2q = 22.5\u201323.5\u00b0; (c) the W\u2013H analysis (d) EDS (elemental ratios); SEM micrographs and element mapping analysis spectra of (e) pristine cathode, (f) after Mg2+ insertion (g) after Mg2+ extraction.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The Williamson\u2013Hall (W\u2013H) model was applied to estimate the uniform stress deformation and the S cathode's average crystallite size (D) at different electrochemical states. The formula for W\u2013H model is expressed as: bcosq \u00bc kl D\n\u00fe 43sinq; where b is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), q is the Bragg's angle, k is the shape factor (0.94), and l is the X-ray wavelength. Fig. 6c reveals Williamson\u2013Hall diagram: b cos(q) versus 4 sin(q) of S0, S1, and S2, the slope of the line and the y-intercept represent the strain and crystallite size, respectively.25 The lattice strain values and crystallite size are listed in Table 3. The microstrain/crystallite size increases/\ndecreases in the discharge state while returns to the original values upon aer recharge state, which conrms that S cathode is under high volumetric expansion/contraction during the insertion/extraction of Mg2+ within the sulfur skeleton. SEM images and EDS results of the S0, S1, and S2 composite are shown in Fig. 6d\u2013g. The pristine S0 electrode shows an inhomogeneous distribution of sulfur deposits on the GNPs network surface. Aer magnesiation (S1), it can be noticed that the Mg 2+ ions interact with S atoms and show stick sediment distribution. The stick sediments disappeared in de-magnesiation state (S2), and the surface showed smooth morphology. Fig. 6d and insets of Fig. 6e\u2013g show EDS and elemental mapping results for S0, S1, and S2, respectively. By following the evolution of Mg 2+ ratio that increased from zero in the pristine state to 16.32 wt% upon discharge and decreased to 11.48 wt% upon recharge state, the results support the partially reversible conversion reaction of the S8 to polysulde molecules and vice versa. Furthermore, the evolution of the sulfur ratio from 18 wt% in S2 aer discharging to 6 wt% upon subsequent charge process conrms the shuttling of polysulde, which is presumably responsible for the capacity fading.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The FT-IR spectra conrm that EC additive changed the Mg2+ solvation structure via supporting weak solvent\u2013cation interaction, promoting the rapid desolvation of Mg2+ ions. Furthermore, the addition of EC enhanced the ionic conductivity and Mg2+ ion transference number of the electrolyte, which can be understood from the role of EC in disassociating the magnesium salt and forming SEI. However, the introduction of EC results in the formation of a resistive SEI, causing high Mg stripping/plating overpotential. The Mg\u2013S full cell using modied HFE (HFE_EC) delivers an initial specic capacity of 900 mA g\u22121 with a cycle life of up to 10 cycles in case of activating the cell with electrochemical conditioning. Much work must be dedicated to optimizing the EC-based halogenfree electrolytes to realize practical Mg\u2013S batteries."
