            "text": "2\nIn the past decade, intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly 22 explored as a new treatment for reducing the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder 23 (ASD). The efficacy of continual oxytocin treatment in school-aged children with ASD is, 24 however, not well established. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel 25 design, the current trial explored the effects of four weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment 26 (12 IU, twice daily) on social functioning in pre-pubertal school-aged children (aged 8-12 27 years, 61 boys, 16 girls). The double-blind phase was followed by a four-week single-blind 28 extension phase during which all participants received intranasal oxytocin. In the double-29 blind phase, no treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing 30 social functioning (parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale), as well as on secondary 31 outcomes assessing repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and attachment. Exploratory moderator 32 analyses revealed that children who received the oxytocin treatment in combination with 33 concomitant psychosocial treatment displayed a greater benefit than those who received 34 psychosocial treatment or oxytocin alone. A modulating effect of parents\u2019 beliefs about 35 allocated treatment was also identified, indicating that parents who believed their child 36 assigned to the active treatment reported greater benefit than those who believed their child 37 received placebo, particularly in the actual oxytocin group. Finally, participants who were 38 allocated to receive the placebo treatment during the double-blind phase of the trial and later 39 crossed-over to receive the active treatment during the single-blind extension phase, 40 displayed a significant within-group improvement in social responsiveness, over and above 41 the placebo-induced improvements noted in the first phase. While no overall treatment-42 specific improvements were identified, our results provide important indications that clinical 43 efficacy can be augmented when oxytocin administration is paired with targeted psychosocial 44 interventions that similarly stimulate socio-communicative behaviors. Future trials are urged 45 to further elucidate the potential of embedding oxytocin treatment within a socially stimulating 46 context. 47\n3\nIntroduction 48\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by 49 impairments in social communication and interaction, combined with restricted and repetitive 50 behaviors and interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Thus far, the means of 51 treatment of ASD\u2019s core symptoms are primarily based on behavioral interventions (e.g., 52 stimulation of social communication, lessening the impairment due to restricted and repetitive 53 behaviors), since biomedical or pharmacological therapies targeting social impairment or 54 repetitive behaviors are largely unproven. 55\nIn the past decade, intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been 56 increasingly explored as a new treatment option for reducing ASD\u2019s social symptoms 57 (recently summarized in Huang et al., 2021). OT is an endogenous neuropeptide that is 58 mainly produced in paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. In the brain, OT acts as an 59 important neuromodulator for a broad range of affiliative and prosocial behaviors, including 60 interpersonal bonding, social attunement and attachment (Bakermans-Kranenburg & van 61 IJzendoorn, 2013; Bartz et al., 2011; Jurek & Neumann, 2018), presumably mediated 62 through its postulated top-down enhancing effect on \u2018social salience\u2019 and bottom-up effect on 63 regulating (social) stress and anxiety (Guastella & Hickie, 2016; Shamay-Tsoory & Abu-Akel, 64 2016). 65\nFollowing a myriad of single-dose proof-of-principle studies (Alvares et al., 2017; Huang et 66 al., 2021), an initial multiple-dose pilot study assessed the safety and efficacy of six weeks of 67 chronic intranasal OT treatment on core autism symptoms in 19 adults with ASD (10 68 receiving OT, 9 receiving placebo), and showed improved emotion recognition and quality of 69 life, and tentative improvements in repetitive behaviors after OT treatment (Anagnostou et 70 al., 2012). Later, Kosaka et al. (2016) showed significant improvements on the Clinical 71 Global Impression-Improvement scale after twelve weeks of OT treatment in adult men with 72 ASD, albeit only in the subgroup of participants receiving the high-dose treatment (32 IU/day; 73 n = 13), and not in the low-dose (16 IU; n = 15) or placebo groups (n = 16). In an exploratory 74 cross-over study by Watanabe et al. (2015), the effects of six weeks of daily intranasal OT 75 administration on core autism characteristics were studied in 20 adult men with ASD, and 76 significant improvements in social reciprocity and social functioning (social-judgement task) 77 were identified. Yamasue et al. (2020) conducted a confirmatory trial with an identical 78 protocol as Watanabe et al. (2015) in 106 adult men with ASD (53 OT / 53 placebo). While 79 these authors identified significant improvements in terms of repetitive behaviors, the effects 80 on social reciprocity and social functioning could not be replicated. Bernaerts et al. (2020) 81 extended these observations in an exploratory sample of 40 young adult men with ASD (22 82\n.

To date, a handful of trials explored 89 the effects of multiple-dose OT administration in children with ASD. Two initial trials reported 90 a consistent pattern of results, indicating improvements in the social domain (parent-reported 91 social responsiveness) after five weeks of intranasal OT treatment in 3-to-6-year-old children 92 (n = 31; cross-over; Yatawara et al., 2016) and after four weeks of treatment in 6-to-12-year-93 old children with ASD (14 OT / 18 placebo; Parker et al., 2017). No significant improvements 94 on core autism symptoms were demonstrated, however, after an eight-week OT treatment in 95 adolescent boys with ASD (26 OT / 24 placebo; 12-18 years; Guastella et al., 2015) or in a 96 preliminary 12-week administration trial encompassing a broad age range of 5-to-17-year-old 97 children (8 OT / 10 placebo) with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (characterized by ASD 98 symptoms; Fastman et al., 2021). Also, in a recent confirmatory trial including 3-to-17-year-99 old children with ASD (139 OT / 138 placebo) and an age-adjusted dosing scheme ranging 100 from 8-80 IU, no improvements on outcomes of social functioning were evident after 24 101 weeks of OT treatment (Sikich et al., 2021). 102\nSeveral factors have been put forward to understand these inconsistent results, ranging from 103 heterogeneity in trial design (e.g., parallel versus cross-over design, adopted outcomes, 104 dosing schema) to variation in participant characteristics. For instance, the well-powered 105 confirmatory trial by Sikich et al. (2021) covered a broad age range (3-17 years), 106 encompassing a critical period of pubertal development, which could have rendered 107 heterogeneity due to differential physiologic effects of OT during different developmental 108 stages (Geschwind, 2021). 109\nHere, results are presented from a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-110 controlled clinical trial (RCT with parallel design), testing efficacy on improvement in social 111 functioning and safety of multiple-dose OT treatment (four weeks of twice daily intranasal 112 administration of 12 IU) in a representative sample of 8-to-12-year-old children with ASD (40 113 OT / 40 placebo). Accordingly, this is the largest trial to date, examining OT treatment effects 114 in a relatively strict age range of pre-pubertal, school-aged children, aged 8 to 12 years, 115 thereby allowing to overcome some of the raised issues regarding sample heterogeneity. 116 Further, following prior observations of long-lasting retention effects of OT treatment in adults 117\n.

General study design 122\nA single-center, two-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study was 123 performed at the Leuven University Hospital (Leuven, Belgium) to assess effects of four 124 weeks of twice daily intranasal administration of OT on core autism characteristics, social 125 anxiety, and experience of attachment in school-aged children with ASD. The double-blind 126 phase (phase I) was followed by a four-week single-blind extension phase (phase II) during 127 which all participants received intranasal OT. In both phases, treatment effects were 128 assessed immediately after the four-week treatment (post) and at a follow-up session, four 129 weeks after cessation of the daily administrations (follow-up). See Figure 1, CONSORT Flow 130 diagram for number of participants randomized and analyzed. 131\nWritten informed consent from the parents and assent from the child were obtained prior to 132 the study. Consent forms and study design were approved by the local Ethics Committee for 133 Biomedical Research at the University of Leuven, KU Leuven (S61358) in accordance with 134 The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). The trial was 135 registered at the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2018-000769-35) and the Belgian 136 Federal Agency for Medicines and Health products. 137\n2.2. Participants 138\nChildren with a formal diagnosis of ASD were recruited through the Autism Expertise Centre 139 at the Leuven University Hospital between July 2019 and January 2021. The diagnosis was 140 established by a multidisciplinary neuropediatric team based on the strict criteria of the DSM-141 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; American Psychiatric Association, 142 2013). Prior to randomization, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2; Lord 143 et al., 2012) and estimates of intelligence (four subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale 144 for Children, Fifth Edition, Dutch version; Wechsler, 2018) were acquired (Table 1). Principal 145 inclusion criteria comprised a clinical diagnosis of ASD, age (8-12 years old), intelligence 146 quotient (IQ) above 70, native Dutch speaker, a stable background treatment for at least four 147 weeks prior to the screening and no anticipated changes during the trial. Only premenstrual 148 girls were included. Principal criteria for exclusion comprised any neurological (e.g., stroke, 149 epilepsy, concussion) or significant physical disorder (liver, renal, cardiac pathology) or prior 150\n.

The presence of comorbid psychiatric 151 disorders, current psychoactive medication use, and concomitant participation in 152 psychosocial therapies were screened for and logged (see Table 1 and Supplementary 153 Table 2). 154\nA sample size of 40 participants in each treatment group was determined to be able to detect 155 a medium effect size (d = 0.60) with \u03b1 = 0.05 and 80% power, corresponding to effect sizes 156 previously reported in the four-week oxytocin trial with school-aged children by Parker et al., 157 2017. 158\n2.3. Intervention 159\nStudy medication. Participants were randomized to receive OT (Syntocinon\u00ae, Sigma-tau) 160 or placebo nasal sprays, administered in identical blinded amber 10 ml glass bottles with 161 metered pump. The placebo spray consisted of all the ingredients used in the active solution 162 except the OT compound. Nasal spray preparation, packaging, blinding and randomization 163 (permuted-block randomization, RITA software; Pahlke et al., 2004) was performed by the 164 pharmacy of Heidelberg University Hospital (Germany). Participants were randomly assigned 165 in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to gender. During the initial double-blind phase 166 (phase I), all research staff conducting the trial, participants and their parents were blinded to 167 treatment allocation. During the subsequent single-blind extension phase (phase II), 168 experimenters were aware that all participants received intranasal OT, but participants and 169 parents were still fully blinded regarding treatment allocation. 170\nDosing. Children (assisted by their parents) were asked to self-administer a daily dose of 2 x 171 12 IU nasal spray or placebo equivalent (3 puffs of 2 IU in each nostril), 12 IU in the morning 172 and 12 IU in the afternoon, during 28 consecutive days during the initial double-blind phase 173 (phase I), and for another 28 days during the single-blind extension phase (phase II). 174 Participants received clear instructions about use of the nasal sprays (based on Guastella et 175 al., 2013) through a demonstration together with the experimenter. 176\nCompliance monitoring. Compliance was assured using a daily medication diary that 177 recorded date and time of administration (phase I percentage compliance; OT: 96.75 \u00b1 178 5.26%; placebo: 96.11 \u00b1 5.29 %; t(74) = .52, p = .603; phase II percentage compliance; OT-179 first: 94.55 \u00b1 11.69%; placebo-first: 92.98 \u00b1 13.92 %; t(74) = .53, p = .597). The total amount 180 of administered fluid was also monitored (phase I: OT: 14.86 \u00b1 2.37 ml; PL: 13.79 \u00b1 2.35 ml; 181 t(75) = 2.00, p = .050; phase II: OT-first: 13.72 \u00b1 3.47 ml; placebo-first: 12.83 \u00b1 3.52 ml; t(74) 182 = 1.10, p = .275). 183\n.

Overall, reports of side effects were minimal and not treatment-specific (see 186 Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). 187\nParent reported treatment beliefs. At the end of each trial phase (I and II), parents reported 188 beliefs about treatment allocation (see Results and Figure 3). In the double-blind phase 189 (phase I), the proportion of parents that believed their child had received the OT treatment 190 was similar in both treatment arms: 39.5% in the OT group, 35.9% in the placebo group (p = 191 .75). In the OT group 18.4% of parents indicated to \u2018have no explicit belief\u2019 about treatment 192 allocation versus 10.3% in the placebo group. In the single blind phase (phase II), during 193 which all participants received the actual OT treatment, 51.9% of the parents believed their 194 child received the OT treatment, 35.1% believed their child received the placebo treatment 195 and 13.0% indicated to \u2018have no explicit belief\u2019. 196\n2.4. Outcome Measures 197\nThe primary outcome measure was change from baseline in parent-rated social 198 responsiveness on the Social Responsiveness Scale-Children, second edition (SRS-2; 199 Constantino & Gruber, 2012; Roeyers et al., 2015). which comprises four subscales 200 examining social communication, social awareness, social motivation, and 201 rigidity/repetitiveness, using a four-point Likert-scale (65 items). Higher scores indicate 202 greater deficit. 203\nSecondary outcome measures included changes from baseline in parent-rated repetitive 204 behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish et al., 2000), self and parent-205 rated presence of anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders 206 (SCARED-NL: Muris et al., 2007), and changes from baseline in constructs of self-rated 207 attachment towards their mother (Attachment Questionnaire child-report; Bosmans et al., 208 2014) and peers (Attachment Style Classification Questionnaire child-report; Finzi et al., 209 2000) (see also Supplementary Table 5). 210\nAll outcomes were assessed five times: (i) at baseline, (ii) immediately after the four-week 211 double-blind treatment (phase I - post); (iii) at a follow-up session, four weeks after cessation 212 of the double-blind treatment (phase I - follow-up); (iv) immediately after the four-week 213 single-blind treatment (phase II - post); and (v) at a follow-up session four weeks after 214 cessation of the single-blind treatment (phase II - follow-up). Post sessions were scheduled 215 approximately 24h after the last administration, follow-up sessions within 28 \u00b1 7 days. 216\n.

Data Analysis 217\nAnalyses were performed using a modified intention-to-treat approach that included all 218 randomized participants who completed the baseline session and at least one post or follow-219 up session (see Figure 1, CONSORT flow-chart). All statistics were executed with Statistica 220 14 (Tibco Software Inc.). 221\nFirst, as outlined in Table 1, possible baseline differences between treatment groups on the 222 primary or secondary outcomes were assessed using independent sample t-tests, but no 223 statistically significant differences were identified. Next, between-group differences in 224 treatment responses of phase I (double-blind) on the primary and secondary outcome 225 measures were assessed, by subjecting change from baseline scores of the post and follow-226 up session to independent sample t-tests. Additionally, single-sample t-tests were adopted to 227 assess within-group changes (compared to baseline) in the OT and placebo group 228 separately. 229\nSubsequent exploratory analyses of the primary outcome were performed to investigate the 230 potential influence of possible moderator variables on phase I treatment outcome. To do so, 231 change from baseline scores of the primary outcome (SRS-2) were subjected to general 232 linear models with the within-subject factor \u2018assessment session\u2019 (post, follow-up) and the 233 between-subject factors \u2018treatment\u2019 (OT, placebo) and specific moderator variables. Separate 234 models were constructed to assess the modulating effect of concomitant psychosocial 235 treatments (present, not present); medication use (present, not present; as listed in Table 1); 236 and parent reported beliefs (OT, placebo). 237\nTo evaluate the effect of phase, within-subject changes from phase I (double-blind) to phase 238 II (single-blind extension) were assessed, across groups and separately within the OT-first 239 and placebo-first groups. To do so, change from baseline scores of the primary outcome 240 (SRS-2) were subjected to general linear models with the within-subject factors \u2018assessment 241 session\u2019 (post, follow-up) and \u2018phase\u2019 (phase I, phase II). 242\nFinally, to assess whether the magnitude of the observed change from baseline scores at the 243 last session of the trial were reliable for individual participants (more than can be expected by 244 measurement error), the Reliable Change Index (RCI) as proposed by Jacobson et al. (1999) 245 was calculated, based on the test-retest reliability of the adopted Dutch parent-reported SRS 246 scale (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = .94; Roeyers et al., 2015). Change scores higher than the RCI-247 value (14.8) were considered reliable. 248\n.

A similar pattern of 257 non-treatment-specific improvements was evident for the secondary outcomes (Table 2). 258\nInterestingly, exploratory moderator analyses showed a significant interaction between 259 treatment and the presence of concomitant psychosocial treatment (F(1,72) = 6.87; p = 260 .011; Figure 2), indicating that, across assessment sessions (post, follow-up), participants 261 who received the OT treatment combined with psychosocial treatment displayed greater 262 benefits compared to children receiving only psychosocial treatment (combined with placebo) 263 (t(26) = 2.40; p = .012, one-tailed) or only the OT treatment (t(36) = 1.90; p = .033, one-264 tailed). In children without psychosocial treatment, OT treatment responses were not 265 significantly different from those in the placebo group (t(46) = 1.40; p = .084, one-tailed). 266 None of the other main or interaction effects (e.g., with assessment session) were significant 267 (all, p > .05). 268\nIn terms of modulating effects of parent reported beliefs, a trend-level interaction with 269 \u2018assessment session\u2019 was evident (F(1,61) = 3.22; p = .077), indicating that the parents\u2019 own 270 belief about allocated treatment differentially modulated treatment responses at the post and 271 follow-up assessment session (Figure 3). Direct exploration of this effect, separately for each 272 treatment group, showed that for participants receiving the actual OT treatment, parents\u2019 own 273 belief moderated treatment immediately post-treatment (t(29) = -3.18; p = .001, one-tailed), 274 but no longer at the follow-up session (t(29) = -1.02; p = .158, one-tailed). Specifically, 275 parents who believed their child had received OT, reported significantly greater 276 improvements in social responsiveness immediately post-treatment, compared to those who 277 believed their child had received placebo. In the placebo group, no significant modulations of 278 treatment responses were evident either immediately post-treatment (t(32) = -.32; p = .374, 279 one-tailed) or at the follow-up session (t(32) = .37; p =.358, one-tailed). None of the other 280 main or interaction effects were significant (all, p > .05). Further, for concomitant 281 medication use, no significant modulating effects were evident (all, p > .148). 282\n.

The main 287 effects of treatment and assessment session were not significant (p > .05). 288\nWhen examined separately for each treatment group, the effect of phase was particularly 289 strong in the placebo-first group (F(1,35) = 14.54; p < .001), indicating that for children who 290 crossed over from placebo (in phase I) to OT treatment (in phase II), improvements in social 291 responsiveness were significantly more pronounced in phase II, during which the child 292 received the actual OT treatment (Figure 4, right panel). 293\nWithin the OT-first group, only non-significant within-subject changes from phase I to phase II 294 were noted (F(1,35) = 1.99; p = .17), indicating that OT treatment effects of phase I were not 295 significantly augmented by receiving the additional four-week OT treatment of phase II. 296 Analysis of the OT-first group did reveal a significant effect of \u2018session\u2019, indicating that 297 irrespective of phase, treatment-related improvements were more pronounced at the follow-298 up session, compared to the post session (F(1,35) = 6.11; p = .018), with maximal treatment 299 responses at the last assessment session of the trial (four-week follow-up of phase II; Figure 300 4, left panel). 301\nAccordingly, at the last session of the trial, both the OT-first (receiving a total of eight weeks 302 of OT treatment) and the placebo-first group (receiving a total of four weeks of OT treatment) 303 displayed significant pre-to-post improvements in social responsiveness (OT-first; pre-post 304 change: -9.61 \u00b1 12.18; t(35)= -4.74; p < .001; (placebo-first; pre-post change: -9.81 \u00b1 14.83; 305 t(35)= -3.97; p < .001). In the OT-first group, 27 (out of 36: 75%) participants displayed a pre-306 to-post improvement, and this change was identified to be reliable for 12 participants (higher 307 than the Reliable Change Index: >14.8). Similarly, also in the PL-first group, 27 (out of 36: 308 75%) participants displayed a pre-to-post improvement at the last session of the trial, which 309 was reliable for 11 participants. 310\n.

Both the OT and the placebo group displayed similar improvements, both 316 immediately after the multiple-dose treatment and at the four-week follow-up session. 317 Notably, exploratory analyses showed that children who received the OT treatment in 318 combination with concomitant psychosocial treatment displayed a greater improvement in 319 social responsiveness than those who received psychosocial treatment or OT alone. A 320 modulating effect of parents\u2019 belief about allocated treatment was also identified, indicating 321 that parents who believed their child had been assigned the active treatment reported greater 322 benefit than those who believed their child received placebo, particularly in the experimental 323 group receiving actual OT. Finally, participants who were allocated to receive the placebo 324 treatment during the first double-blind phase of the trial and later crossed-over to receive the 325 active treatment during the second (single-blind) phase, displayed a significant improvement 326 in social responsiveness, over and above the \u2018placebo-induced\u2019 improvement noted in the 327 first phase. The next sections will address these observations in more detail. 328\nThe results of earlier continual OT trials in children with ASD have been equivocal: some with 329 beneficial outcomes (Parker et al., 2017; Yatawara et al., 2016), while others without 330 significant effect (Fastman et al., 2021; Guastella et al., 2015; Sikich et al., 2021). While it is 331 difficult to pinpoint the different factors contributing to variability in study results, several key 332 differences in adopted dosing schema, trial design, and participant demographics have been 333 put forward as important moderators. Furthermore, the particular context in which the OT 334 treatment is administered is also increasingly put forward as a vital factor for understanding 335 variability in treatment responses within and across studies. Initial single-dose administration 336 studies already noted that acute effects of OT can be modulated by contextual factors, 337 indicating for instance that OT-induced facilitation of cooperation and trust is most 338 pronounced towards in-group members, but is diminished, absent or even reversed towards 339 out-group members, particularly within threat-emanating contexts (de Dreu et al., 2010; 340 Mikolajczak et al., 2010). Also, in an early study by Heinrichs et al (2003), stress-reducing 341 effects of OT were significantly augmented when accompanied by a supportive context (i.e., 342 social support from a friend). 343\nAgainst this background, it has been theorized that OT may indeed open a \u2018window of 344 opportunity\u2019 to enhance prosocial behavior, but its potential can only be fully realized when 345\n.

In line with this notion, exploratory assessments within 348 our current trial revealed a significant synergetic modulation of treatment response related to 349 the presence of concomitant psychosocial treatment during the course of the OT trial 350 (screened through parent report, see Table 1), indicating maximal treatment effects in 351 children receiving the OT treatment in combination with ongoing psychosocial treatment. 352 Administration of OT as an adjunct to other therapeutic approaches has been explored 353 before. For example, in a study with schizophrenic patients, a six-week (12 session) social 354 cognition training was combined with OT administration (shortly before the start of each 355 session), and a significant improvement in empathic accuracy was observed (Davis et al., 356 2014). Also, in patients with social anxiety disorders, OT treatment administered as an 357 adjunct to 4 sessions of public speaking-exposure therapy induced significant improvements 358 in mental representations of the self (Guastella et al., 2009). While preliminary, a pilot 6-week 359 OT administration study in which parents were stimulated to systematically engage with their 360 child in a positive social interaction or play session in the first hour after spray administration, 361 yielded unanimously positive treatment outcomes in 3-to-8-year-old children with ASD (n = 362 46), both in terms of social improvements and repetitive behaviors (Le et al., 2022). 363 Together, these and our study highlight the relevance of context and urge future clinical trials 364 to further elucidate whether clinical efficacy can be augmented when OT administration is 365 paired with targeted behavioral interventions that support similar states and (social) 366 behaviors. 367\nAnother notable observation was the identification that the parent\u2019s belief about allocated 368 treatment constituted a potentially important moderator of treatment response, indicating 369 that \u2013 within the OT group - parents who believed their child had been assigned the active 370 treatment reported greater benefit than those who believed their child received placebo. 371 Notably, the modulation was only significant in the group receiving the actual OT treatment, 372 not in the placebo group, and only for the immediate post-treatment outcome assessment, 373 not for the four-week follow-up assessment. These results therefore only partly concur with a 374 prior negative OT trial in which moderator effects by parent belief were evident, both in the 375 actual OT group, as well as in the placebo group (Guastella et al., 2015). One the one hand, 376 the modulation by parents\u2019 belief may reflect an expectancy bias, as noted in many prior 377 studies, especially in pediatric trials (King et al., 2009). Particularly in relation to OT 378 intervention research, increased biases can be expected, considering the large media 379 coverage and hype about purported prosocial benefits of the OT \u201clove hormone\u201d that may 380 eventually impact parents\u2019 expectancies (Guastella et al., 2015). However, a sole effect of 381\n. CC-BY 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)\nThe copyright holder for this preprintthis version posted April 21, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.22274106doi: medRxiv preprint\n13\nexpectancy bias may be unlikely, since in that case, one would expect response modulations 382 to be present both in the OT and placebo groups. Since the modulating effect was specific to 383 the OT group, the possibility cannot be ruled out that parents may have actually correctly 384 identified real treatment responders, yielding maximal treatment responses in a particular 385 subgroup of children that displayed actual beneficial effects. Further, in line with the notion 386 that context may constitute an important moderator of treatment, one could also envisage 387 that parents who believed their child to receive the active treatment, may have provided their 388 children with more active socio-interactive family contexts during the four-week treatment 389 period, i.e., prompting them to increasingly engage in social experiences and learning, 390 thereby effectively boosting treatment responses. 391\nAnother important result relates to the observation that children who crossed over from 392 placebo (in phase I) to the actual OT treatment (in phase II), showed a significant further 393 improvement in social responsiveness over and above the substantial placebo-induced 394 improvement noted in phase I. Trial designs in which a phase of blinded placebo intervention 395 is administered before actual treatment allocation have been put forward before as an 396 efficient method to control for placebo effects and to improve detection of \u2018real\u2019 therapeutic 397 responses (Yatawara et al., 2016). The current observation of a significant further 398 improvement from a blinded placebo phase (double-blinded) to the active treatment (single-399 blinded) provides support to this notion. While not explicitly addressed in the current study, it 400 is also noteworthy to stipulate that the oxytocinergic system itself has been suggested to 401 form a key mediator for facilitating placebo-induced improvements. Indeed, as postulated in 402 the recent oxytocin-placebo account of Itskovich et al. (2022); OT is suggested to mediate 403 social facilitation of placebo effects, an effect that is thought to be facilitated by increased 404 social connectedness between patient and clinician during trial participation. In line with this 405 notion, a prior OT administration trial showed that placebo-induced improvements in social 406 functioning coincided with endogenous increases in oxytocin secretion (Parker et al., 2017) 407\nFurther, in our trial, children who received the actual OT treatment in the first phase and 408 crossed over to a second phase of active treatment, showed only non-significant within-409 subject improvements from phase I to phase II, particularly at the four-week follow-up 410 session of phase II - supporting prior observations of a retention of OT\u2019s beneficial effects, 411 also after cessation of the daily nasal spray administrations (Alaerts et al., 2020; Bernaerts et 412 al., 2020). It is noted indeed, that at the last follow-up session of the trial, the majority of 413 children of both the OT-first group and the placebo-first group displayed (reliable) beneficial 414 effects in social responsiveness, indicating that both an eight-week (with a four-week break 415 in the middle) or a continual four-week OT treatment were similarly able to induce a 416 significant beneficial outcome on a core ASD symptom domain. This observation adds to the 417\n. CC-BY 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In multiple-418 dose OT trials with individuals with ASD, daily dosing ranged from 8-80 IU and durations 419 from 4 continual days to 24 weeks, but strong empirical support for favoring one dosing 420 scheme over another is currently lacking. Some earlier single-dose trials suggested dose-421 response curves to exhibit U-shaped forms (Lieberz et al., 2020; Spengler et al., 2017), a 422 notion that is supported by a recent chronic four-week OT administration trial in ASD, 423 identifying a daily total dose of 6 IU of TTA-121 (a new formulation of intranasal OT spray 424 with an enhanced bioavailability) to be the most efficacious one, compared to a lower (3 IU) 425 or higher (10 IU) daily dose (Yamasue et al., 2022). Furthermore, in terms of dosing scheme, 426 recent work showed that intermittent (every other day) administration may be therapeutically 427 more efficient than continual administration to obtain anxiolytic effects and reduce amygdala 428 reactivity (Kou et al., 2020). These observations were attributed to reflect a desensitization of 429 the endogenous oxytocinergic system upon too high concentrations and/or too high 430 frequencies of exogenous OT administration. The current observation that a single four-week 431 course can yield the same beneficial effects as a twice four-week course therefore reinforces 432 the notion that longer treatment durations do not necessarily facilitate higher treatment 433 responses. Similarly, in a recent large-scale trial administering OT over a 24-week period, it 434 was noted that the long duration might have attenuated initial early responses to OT (Sikich 435 et al., 2021). In light of these observations, future trials should be directed at identifying the 436 optimal dosing, administration length, and intervals of intranasal OT administration. 437\nTo conclude, while the current study showed no overall treatment-specific improvements, 438 important moderator effects were identified, providing initial indications that clinical efficacy 439 can be augmented when OT administration is paired with targeted behavioral interventions 440 that support similar states and (social) behaviors. Future trials are urged to further elucidate 441 the potential of embedding OT treatment within a (socially) stimulating context. Also, the role 442 of parental belief in modulating OT treatment responses needs further attention in 443 subsequent clinical trials. Finally, the observation that (reliable) improvements were 444 established in a large subset of children at the last session of the trial, either after a single 445 four-week course or after two four-week courses, should stimulate future trials to further 446 identify optimal dosing schemas, not only in terms of (daily) concentration, but also in terms 447 of administration length and the possibility of intermittent dosing. 448\n.
