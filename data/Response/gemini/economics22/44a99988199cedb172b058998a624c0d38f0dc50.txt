1. **Investigate the long-term financial impact of physical disability and dementia on older adults.** This could be done by following a cohort of older adults over time to track their out-of-pocket costs and economic well-being. This information could be used to inform policy decisions about how to best support older adults with these conditions.


2. **Explore the relationship between physical disability, dementia, and poverty.** This could be done by examining the prevalence of poverty among older adults with these conditions and by identifying the factors that contribute to poverty in this population. This information could be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce poverty among older adults with physical disability and dementia.


3. **Examine the gender disparities in the financial impact of physical disability and dementia.** This could be done by comparing the out-of-pocket costs and economic well-being of older men and women with these conditions. This information could be used to identify the factors that contribute to these disparities and to develop policies and programs to address them.


4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the financial burden of physical disability and dementia on older adults.** This could be done by conducting randomized controlled trials of interventions such as financial assistance programs, case management services, and caregiver support. This information could be used to inform policy decisions about how to best support older adults with these conditions.


5. **Develop new models of care for older adults with physical disability and dementia that are designed to reduce the financial burden on these individuals and their families.** This could involve exploring innovative approaches to service delivery, such as home-based care and telemedicine, and developing new partnerships between healthcare providers, social service agencies, and community organizations.
