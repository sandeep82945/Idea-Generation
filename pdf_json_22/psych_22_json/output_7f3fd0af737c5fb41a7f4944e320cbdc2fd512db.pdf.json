    "abstractText": "Background: Diagnostic labels may influence treatment intentions. We examined the effect of labelling low back pain (LBP) on beliefs about imaging, second opinion, surgery, seriousness, recovery, work, and physical activities. Methods: Six-arm online randomised experiment with blinded participants with and without LBP. Participants received one of six labels: \u201cdisc bulge\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d, \u201carthritis\u201d, \u201clumbar sprain\u201d, \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d, \u201cepisode of back pain\u201d. The primary outcome was belief about need for imaging. Results: 1375 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.7 years [18.4 years]; 748 women [54.4%]) were included. Need for imaging was rated lower with the labels \u201cepisode of back pain\u201d (4.2 [2.9]), \u201clumbar sprain\u201d (4.2 [2.9]), and \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d (4.4 [3.0]) compared to the labels \u201carthritis\u201d (6.0 [2.9]), \u201cdegeneration\u201d (5.7 [3.2]), and \u201cdisc bulge\u201d (5.7 [3.1]). The same labels led to higher recovery expectations and lower ratings of need for a second opinion, surgery, and perceived seriousness compared to \u201cdisc bulge\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d, and \u201carthritis\u201d. Differences were larger among participants with current LBP who had a history of seeking care. No differences were found in beliefs about physical activity and work between the six labels. Conclusions: \u201cEpisode of back pain\u201d, \u201clumbar sprain\u201d and \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d reduced need for imaging, surgery and second opinion compared to \u201carthritis\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d and \u201cdisc bulge\u201d among public and patients with LBP as well as reducing the perceived seriousness of LBP and enhancing recovery expectations. The impact of labels appears most relevant among those at risk of poor outcome (participants with current LBP who had a history of seeking care).",

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. (Vos et al., 2015) It is the second most common symptom-related reason for seeking care from a primary care provider. (Deyo & Weinstein, 2001) In 2016, in the United States, an estimated $134.5 billion was spent on health services for patients with low back and neck pain (ranked first among 154 health conditions), and this spending is rapidly increasing each year.(Dieleman et al., 2020) Non-specific LBP is the guideline-recommended label for the vast majority (90-95% (Deyo & Weinstein, 2001)) of LBP. This refers to LBP where it is currently not possible to identify a specific structural cause (e.g. radiculopathy, fracture, malignancy). (Bardin et al., 2017; Maher et al., 2017)\nThe view that we cannot identify the cause of most LBP is an unpopular one; (Bishop et al., 2015; Bogduk, 2000; Kent & Keating, 2004) and so the non-specific LBP label receives heavy criticism. Opponents of the non-specific label claim it is cumbersome to use with patients, conveys that the clinician does not know what is wrong with the patient; provides no pathoanatomical basis for LBP, and is a barrier to the provision of individualised care. (Bishop et al., 2015; Bogduk, 2000; Kent & Keating, 2004) In fact, The North Amercian Spine Society (the largest medical spine society in the United States), in their 2020 clinical guideline for the diagnosis and assessment of LBP, appeared to reject the non-specific LBP label; \u201cThe term \u2018non specific LBP\u2019 provides no biologic basis for LBP nor assistance in\nclinical decision-making\u201d and \u201cfurther studies of non-specific LBP are unwarranted\u201d. (North American Spine Society, 2020)\nClinicians commonly use other labels to describe LBP not linked to a specific structural cause. For example, a survey study of 1,093 primary-contact clinicians found that 74% think it is possible to identify the source in all cases of LBP and that clinicians treat differently based on patterns of signs and symptoms of presumed structural sources of LBP, including intervertebral discs, facet joints, lumbar ligaments, and lumbar muscles. (Kent & Keating, 2004) Diagnostic labels signifying pathology relating to these structures are used in clinical practice. These include \u2018disc bulge\u2019, \u2018degeneration\u2019, \u2018arthritis\u2019, and \u2018lumbar sprain\u2019. All feature prominently in disease classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases. Like non-specific LBP, use of these specific structural labels is considered problematic for three reasons: 1) The clinical tests used to identify potential structural sources of LBP (e.g. disc degeneration) have low validity; (Hancock et al., 2007) 2) The actual clinical importance of these structural findings is debatable. For example, a systematic review (33 studies, 3310 asymptomatic individuals) concluded that the prevalence of disc bulge was 30% in 20 year olds, 60% in 50 year olds, and increased to 84% in 80 year olds among asymptomatic individuals, while the prevalence of disc degeneration among asymptomatic individuals increased from 37% in 20 year olds to 90% in 80 year olds;(Brinjikji et al., 2015) and 3) Some structural labels may carry negative connotations, and influence recovery expectations and beliefs about work and physical activity. For example, the label \u2018degeneration\u2019 may convey to a patient that their back is fragile. (Bogduk, 2000)\nDiagnostic labels may be important as patients want an explanation for their LBP. (Bogduk, 2000; Jenkins et al., 2016) However, concerns have been expressed that clinicians may lack an adequate vocabulary for explaining LBP not linked to a specific structural cause. (Bogduk, 2000) It is unclear whether current labels used for this form of LBP reassure patients that their LBP is not dangerous, or improve expectation of a positive outcome. Certain labels could trigger \u201ctherapeutic misadventure\u201d. (Bogduk, 2000) For example, some labels (e.g. disc degeneration) may have potential to influence patients\u2019 desire to get unnecessary lumbar imaging. In fact, clinicians often report that patient desire is a key driver of imaging behaviour. (Slade et al., 2015; Slade et al., 2016) Unnecessary imaging can cause harm. Misinterpretation of imaging results by clinicians could result in unhelpful advice (e.g. staying off work) and a cascade of medical interventions. (Lemmers et al., 2019; Webster et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2014) For example, asymptomatic disc degeneration is common and so unnecessary imaging could trigger overdiagnosis and the overuse of ineffective and costly treatments (e.g. lumbar fusion surgery).\nPotential negative impacts of some labels (e.g. disc degeneration) for LBP have been suggested in some qualitative and retrospective cohort studies. (Abenhaim et al., 1995; Darlow et al., 2015; Darlow et al., 2013; Sloan & Walsh, 2010) However, the impact of different diagnostic labels used for LBP on patients has not been explored through rigorous experimental studies. Consequently, there is no robust evidence to guide clinicians\u2019 use of different labels. We therefore investigated the effects of diagnostic labels for LBP on patients\u2019 perceived need for imaging. Secondary aims were to evaluate the effects of labelling on willingness to undergo surgery, beliefs about the need for a second opinion, perceived seriousness of LBP, recovery expectations, and beliefs about the ability to engage with work and physical activities."

Qualtrics uses existing, nationally representative panels of individuals who have previously agreed to participate in research. We recruited three groups of participants: 1. Adults who have LBP and have received formal treatment for LBP at any time in their life (e.g. treatment from a doctor, physical therapist, chiropractor, surgeon, or any other healthcare provider); 2. Adults who have LBP and have never received formal treatment for LBP; and 3. Adults who have never experienced LBP in their lifetime. We stopped recruitment within each group when it reached the target number of participants. We defined an episode of LBP as pain lasting for at least 24 hours. We assessed LBP in the past week using the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale. (Jensen et al., 1999) Included participants were 18 years or older, able to read and write English, and be living in Australia, Canada, or Ireland. We picked these three countries due to having similar\nhealthcare models. There were no other restrictions to participation. All participants completed an online consent form after reading the participant information sheet."

            "text": "All participants were provided the same scenario (Box 1) of attending a primary care clinician about LBP. The scenario described the location of the pain, possible triggering event, and functional limitations. Participants were then randomised to receive one of six diagnostic labels with explanations: \u201cyou have a disc bulge\u201d; \u201cyou have degeneration of the spine\u201d; \u201cyou have arthritis of the spine\u201d; you have a lumbar sprain\u201d; \u201cyou have non-specific low back pain\u201d; or \u201cyou have an episode of back pain\u201d, using the web-based, block randomisation allocation system provided by Qualtrics.\nAll six groups then received the same reassurance from the primary care clinician: \u201cI\u2019m not worried that there is anything serious going on here. I think overall your outlook is good. Movement will help. The sooner we can get you back to your normal activity and work, the more likely your back pain is to get better.\u201d\nWe chose to test disc bulge, degeneration, and arthritis as they are common imaging findings in asymptomatic individuals and may be of doubtful clinical significance. They are also mentioned in the qualitative literature as carrying potentially negative connotations, and they are included in medical disease classification systems. We chose lumbar sprain as it is included in medical disease classification systems, it is commonly used by clinicians for LBP with no specific structural cause, (Darlow et al., 2014) and that patients perceive this\ndiagnosis as an injury. (Darlow et al., 2013) We chose non-specific LBP as it is the guidelinerecommended term for most LBP, but seems unpopular among many clinicians. We chose episode of back pain to describe the symptom of LBP without attaching any structural descriptor."

For willingness to undergo surgery, we adjusted for previous surgery for LBP\n(yes/no) measured at baseline. The remainder of outcomes were left unadjusted. We performed a subgroup analysis on all outcomes to examine if the effect of labelling varied across the three groups of participants (no history of LBP, current LBP ([history of seeking care], current LBP [no history of seeking care]).

We experienced difficulty recruiting participants with no history of LBP and we continued to assess people for eligibility to join this group after recruitment had concluded for the other two participant groups. A large number of individuals (n = 8860) were not eligible to join our no history of LBP group.\nBaseline characteristics (e.g. age, sex, back beliefs, depression, anxiety, healthcare utilisation for LBP, etc) were similar between the six randomised groups. Participants were on average 41.7 years old and 54.4% were female. Participants with current LBP had a mean pain intensity of 5.1/10 (SD 2.3) and a mean disability of 17.6/100 (SD 13.6). Most participants with current LBP (37.9%) had LBP for greater than 12 weeks. A similar proportion of participants with current LBP had previously received a diagnostic label for LBP (27.9%) and had a history of imaging (24.7%). A smaller proportion of participants with current LBP had received surgery for LBP (3.6%) (Table 1)."

Assignment of the same labels (lumbar sprain, non-specific LBP, and episode of back pain) also reduced the perceived seriousness of LBP and increased recovery expectations. Importantly, the impact of labels appears most relevant among those at risk of poor outcome (participants with current LBP who had a history of seeking care), suggesting that what may be a benign label (e.g. disc bulge) among\nmany might be dangerous/risky among the vulnerable. Interestingly, no difference was found in beliefs about physical activity and work being harmful between the six labels. This experiment suggests that certain diagnostic labels (arthritis, degeneration, and disc bulge) have the effect of encouraging tests (e.g. lumbar imaging) and treatments (e.g. surgery)."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first randomised study to examine the effect of diagnostic labels on beliefs and management preferences in the area of LBP. Our findings align with randomised trial evidence from other health areas (e.g. shoulder pain, cancer, conjunctivitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, gastroesophageal symptoms) that labels which medicalise a health condition or symptom increase intentions for more aggressive treatment options. (Copp et al., 2017; McCaffery et al., 2015; Nickel et al, 2017; Scherer et al., 2016; Scherer, et al., 2013; Zadro et al., 2021) More broadly, our findings support findings from qualitative research in the area of LBP that patients perceive labels such as disc bulge and degeneration as threatening and associated with poorer outcome. (Darlow et al., 2015; Darlow et al., 2013; Sloan & Walsh, 2010)\nStrengths and weaknesses of this study\nStrengths of this study are the use of sound methods to reduce bias including randomisation, concealed allocation, a sample size calculation and 99.67% confidence intervals to account for multiple analyses. To include a diversity of viewpoints, we included people with and without LBP with varying demographics (e.g. age, sex, work status) and experiences of\nhealthcare utilisation (e.g. previous imaging and lumbar surgery) for LBP. This is in contrast to many studies examining the effect of labelling on health intentions that include healthy people without the health condition of interest. (Copp et al., 2017; McCaffery et al., 2015; Nickel et al., 2017; Scherer et al., 2016; Scherer et al., 2013) In addition, a consumer with experience of persistent non-specific LBP helped co-design the study and is a co-author. We also recruited a large sample of participants to examine a variety of popular diagnostic labels for LBP and provided these labels along with guideline recommended reassurance and positive expectations of recovery.\nLimitations of this study are that it was based on a scenario and results may differ in real world situations. However, pain intensity levels were similar to clinical populations. Online recruitment may select participants who are more technologically inclined; however, we recruited participants of varying ages and educational attainment. Outcome measurement was only at a single time point immediately after the labels were given; management preferences may change as participants reflect over time. Exclusion of missing outcome data may introduce bias. However, the missing proportion was low (< 10%) and bias would be negligible. We did not prospectively register this study. We made this decision as it did not fit the WHO criteria for a clinical trial. However, we had a formal protocol, and the reporting of outcomes was in accordance with those plans."

            "text": "Reducing the use of ineffective medical tests and treatments for non-specific LBP is a research policy priority. (Buchbinder et al., 2018; Foster et al., 2018) Diagnostic imaging (e.g. x-ray and MRI) does not have a routine role in the management of non-specific LBP\n(90-95% (Deyo & Weinstein, 2001) of all LBP). (Maher et al., 2017) Yet about 25% of all patients who present to primary care with LBP are referred for imaging. (Downie et al., 2019) Since clinician perceived patient expectations may have a large influence on clinician referral decisions, using labels that increase patients\u2019 perceived need for imaging could increase the actual amount of imaging received. Lumbar fusion surgery, a surgery commonly performed for a diagnosis of degeneration, provides no benefit over safer and less costly approaches such as exercise (Mannion et al., 2016) yet the US spends more money on spinal fusion each year than any other surgery (US$12.8 billion per annum) and it is the fourth amongst the surgeries generating the greatest cost in Australia (AUD650M per annum). (Maher et al., 2019) Clinical guidelines recommend advice and reassurance to help reduce or avoid unnecessary tests and treatments for non-specific LBP. Consistent recommendations include educating people about the nature of LBP, reassurance that it is not a serious disease and will improve, and encouragement to avoid bed rest, stay active, and return to usual activities. Our study found that providing reassurance does not remove the negative effects of the labels arthritis, degeneration, and disc bulge. Overall, this study suggests that clinicians could consider avoiding labels like arthritis, degeneration and disc bulge. Instead clinicians could consider using labels like an episode of back pain, lumbar sprain, or non-specific LBP when communicating with patients with LBP, where any specific structural cause needing further exploration has been reasonably excluded. Removing labels like degeneration from low-risk LBP presentations (i.e. non-specific LBP) may help shift patients\u2019 perspectives and enable them to feel more comfortable with accepting a non-medical treatment option for LBP.\nGiven the observed impact of labels on management intentions, we think clinicians should check patients\u2019 understanding of labels and their perceptions of what the labels mean for their individual prognosis and management. For example, patients labelled with degeneration may\nneed reassurance that they do not have a serious condition to reduce any psychological distress or uncertainty. Similarly, patients labelled with a disc bulge may need reassurance that bulges rarely require intervention and are common in asymptomatic people.\nGiven the labels episode of back pain, lumbar sprain, and non-specific LBP describe the same clinical presentation and should receive the same management, clinicians can choose which label will be of most value to a patient based on their context and concerns. Findings from this study can inform clinicians\u2019 label selection through improved knowledge of the relative risks and benefits. There is a view among clinicians that non-specific LBP is an illegitimate diagnosis, that it is unacceptable to patients, that it indicates inadequate clinician expertise to diagnose their problem, and that it may result in seeking further tests and medical opinions. ((Bishop et al., 2015; Kent & Keating, 2004) Although there are isolated examples of studies that have reported an ability to diagnose the specific structural cause of most LBP, a systematic review of 41 diagnostic studies found that the prevalence of diagnosable structural causes (e.g. disc, facet joint, SIJ) in people with LBP varied widely and could not be reliably identified using current clinical tests. (Hancock et al, 2007) Despite a slight increase in perceived need for second opinion compared to lumbar sprain, non-specific LBP resulted in the lowest perceived seriousness or need for surgery and episode of back pain resulted in the lowest perceived need for imaging. Given there did not appear to be strong differences between the labels non-specific LBP and episode of back pain, it could be reasonable \u2013 in light of common criticisms of the non-specific label \u2013 to use the latter term. However, the word \u2018episode\u2019 denotes something short-term/acute. While this could encourage positive recovery expectations in people with new back pain, the label \u2018episode of back pain\u2019 may potentially be less acceptable to those who have not recovered \u2013 i.e. individuals living with persistent LBP. In our experiment, the label non-specific LBP was\naccompanied by the words \u201ctension, soreness, stiffness\u201d. These words may help clinicians provide more meaningful/relatable explanations to patients - instead of providing the \u2018nonspecific\u2019 label in isolation. Lumbar sprain resulted in the most optimistic views of recovery, but may be less relevant for the one third of LBP patients who cannot recall an incident that triggered the episode of LBP (Parreira et al., 2015) and would seem more suited to acute than persistent cases of LBP."

            "text": "Diagnostic labels are used for many purposes within health systems and broader society. Impacts on these systems and how these support recovery from LBP would need to be considered before any significant re-labelling was embarked on. In particular, research is required to explore broader system (e.g. insurance companies, workplaces, compensation systems) acceptability of the labels found to be associated with better recovery and reduced need for medical interventions in this study. Individuals with LBP are often (unhelpfully) required to get a structural diagnosis \u2013 often through use of imaging \u2013 for their pain to be validated and legitimised. (Bartys et al., 2017; Buchbinder et al., 2011) Further, people with LBP are frequently stigmatised and excluded by others, especially when there is no easily communicated underlying medical pathology.(Karos et al., 2018) This could present a obstacle to the uptake of the labels episode of back pain and non-specific LBP that do not provide a structural diagnosis for an individual\u2019s LBP. Several studies suggest that patients want a specific diagnosis that explains their LBP. (Lim et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2020; Verbeek et al., 2004) More research will be required to explore how clinicians can best communicate a symptom in a way that is devoid as possible of words reflecting structural disruption, while also meeting patient needs. Broader civic, consumer and clinician\ninvolvement in research will be required to examine desire for updating diagnostic labels and how labels associated with good recovery can be communicated across various contexts."

We examined the effect of labelling low back pain (LBP) on beliefs about imaging, second opinion, surgery, seriousness, recovery, work, and physical activities.\nMethods: Six-arm online randomised experiment with blinded participants with and without LBP. Participants received one of six labels: \u201cdisc bulge\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d, \u201carthritis\u201d, \u201clumbar sprain\u201d, \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d, \u201cepisode of back pain\u201d. The primary outcome was belief about need for imaging.\nResults: 1375 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.7 years [18.4 years]; 748 women [54.4%]) were included. Need for imaging was rated lower with the labels \u201cepisode of back pain\u201d (4.2 [2.9]), \u201clumbar sprain\u201d (4.2 [2.9]), and \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d (4.4 [3.0]) compared to the labels \u201carthritis\u201d (6.0 [2.9]), \u201cdegeneration\u201d (5.7 [3.2]), and \u201cdisc bulge\u201d (5.7 [3.1]). The same labels led to higher recovery expectations and lower ratings of need for a second opinion, surgery, and perceived seriousness compared to \u201cdisc bulge\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d, and \u201carthritis\u201d. Differences were larger among participants with current LBP who had a history of seeking care. No differences were found in beliefs about physical activity and work between the six labels.\nConclusions: \u201cEpisode of back pain\u201d, \u201clumbar sprain\u201d and \u201cnon-specific LBP\u201d reduced need for imaging, surgery and second opinion compared to \u201carthritis\u201d, \u201cdegeneration\u201d and \u201cdisc bulge\u201d among public and patients with LBP as well as reducing the perceived seriousness of LBP and enhancing recovery expectations. The impact of labels appears most relevant among those at risk of poor outcome (participants with current LBP who had a history of seeking care).\nEJP_1981_Figure 1.png\nEJP_1981_Figure 2.png\nEJP_1981_Figure 3.png"
