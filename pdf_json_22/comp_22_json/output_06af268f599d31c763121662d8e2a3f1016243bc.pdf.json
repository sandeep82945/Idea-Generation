    "abstractText": "With the significant increase in users on social media platforms, a new means of political campaigning has appeared. Twitter and Facebook are now notable campaigning tools during elections. Indeed, the candidates and their parties now take to the internet to interact and spread their ideas. In this paper, we aim to identify political communities formed on Twitter during the 2022 French presidential election and analyze each respective community. We create a large-scale Twitter dataset containing 1.2 million users and 62.6 million tweets that mention keywords relevant to the election. We perform community detection on a retweet graph of users and propose an in-depth analysis of the stance of each community. Finally, we attempt to detect offensive tweets and automatic bots, comparing across communities in order to gain insight into each candidate\u2019s supporter demographics and online campaign strategy.",

            "text": "Social media has created a forum for everyone to express themselves, bringing disputes to a wide audience and playing an increasingly crucial part in today\u2019s information economy. With the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a relatively new paradigm was observed, where a large part of the political campaign was held on either Facebook or Twitter. The extensive outreach of these platforms has been shown to bring multiple benefits to politicians, such as increases in donations (Petrova et al., 2021), or an amplified impact on the politically inattentive youth (Utz, 2009). The tremendous amount of data provided by social media platforms gives us insight into the inner workings of the online political horizon. This paper aims to present an in-depth study on the Twitter landscape of the 2022 French elections. We start by creating a Twitter dataset containing more than 60 million tweets from more than a million users. The tweets are extracted based on keywords related to the election. We use this dataset to build a retweet graph among the users and run a graph-based algorithm for community detection. By analyzing the top hashtags and word clouds of tweets posted by users of each community, we are able to interpret which candidate they each support. We go on to visualize the geographical distribution of each candidate\u2019s online supporters across different regions, making comparisons between communities. Eventually, we perform offensiveness detection and bot detection in all the communities. The detection of offensive tweets reveals that supporters of certain candidates are more likely to post offensive contents. The results of bot detection also indicates that there are higher levels of bot activities in certain on-\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\nline communities than in others. However, we would like to emphasize that the results of both offensiveness detection and bot detection are produced by automatic classification models reflecting patterns of the datasets they were trained on. Such models are subject to various limitations and by no means reflect our personal opinions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the related work. Section 3 describes our the dataset we use and how we collected it. Section 4 supplies a detailed description of the graphbased communities. Section 5 detects offensive tweets in each community while section 6 studies the use of automated bot accounts. Finally, section 7 summarizes our research and presents potential future work."

            "text": "Early work on Twitter analysis of political elections dates back to when Twitter was founded. An example is a study on the 2008 U.S. presidential election (Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010) where the debate performance of presidential candidates is characterized by aggregated Twitter sentiment. This initiated a branch of research centered around monitoring online public reactions during election periods. Relevant studies have been carried out on a wide range of elections in different countries, including the 2012 South Korea presidential election (Bae et al., 2013), the 2013 German parliamentary election (Rill et al., 2014), and the 2017 UK general election (Yaqub et al., 2020). Another popular branch of research aims at forecasting election results based on Twitter data. For example, a study on the 2009 German federal election (Tumasjan et al., 2010) claims that the respective shares of Twitter volume can accurately reflect the distribution of electoral votes for the six main parties. However, another ar X iv :2\n20 4.\n07 43\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n1 5\nA pr\n2 02\n2\nstudy on the 2011 Singapore presidential election using Twitter sentiment succeeded in picking out the top two candidates but failed to predict the final ranking (Choy et al., 2011). It is generally agreed upon that Twitter analysis for election outcome prediction cannot substitute traditional polling approaches (Bermingham and Smeaton, 2011), and that explainable models should accompany the predictive results (Gayo-Avello et al., 2011). More recently, attention has been drawn to the diffusion of misinformation and toxicity during online campaigns. Relevant topics include the detection of fake news (Cinelli et al., 2020), social bots (Pastor-Galindo et al., 2020), political trolls (Badawy et al., 2018) as well as hate speech (Siegel et al., 2021) and offensive language (Grimminger and Klinger, 2021). Our work is closely related to this field of study while also drawing upon graph-based analysis of Twitter network structures (Radicioni et al., 2021)."

We extract tweets in the French language containing the keywords mentioned above through Twitter\u2019s public streaming API.

            "text": "With our set of extracted tweets, their authors, and the users who retweet these tweets, we create a directed weighted graph G = (V,E) where n = |V | denotes the number of nodes. Specifically, each node represents a user on Twitter, and a weighted edge connects two nodes if one user retweets the other. For instance, the weight Au,v of the edge (u, v) from vertex v to vertex u notes the number of times that the user u retweeted the user v. We believe that a normal retweet indicates approval of the tweet\u2019s content, unlike the quote retweets\nand the replies. Therefore, the graph does not model the textual similarity of the tweets but only the relation between users. Note that the obtained graph G might contain self-loops that correspond to self-retweets. The obtained graph contains 1.2M nodes and 12.4M edges. To avoid small, non-dense clusters formed from few numbers of users with few retweets, we decided to work on a dense subset of the graph that we obtained using the k-core decomposition algorithm instead of working on a full graph. The k-core decomposition algorithm (Seidman, 1983) aims to find subsets of a graph G. The subsets are called k-cores of G and are obtained by a recursive pruning strategy. Each node inside a k-core is connected to at least k other nodes inside this subset. The hyperparameter k is chosen so that we do not get a cluster with less than ten users. The final used k-core graph has 47,578 nodes and 8.2M edges. Seven communities are found in our dataset through applying this approach."

            "text": "In graph mining, community detection helps to reveal the hidden relations among the nodes in a graph. Hence, to discern opinion groups inside the k-core graph, we apply the Louvain community detection method (Blondel et al., 2008) on an undirected version of our graph without self-loops. The Louvain method is chosen as it has reasonable computation costs while maximizing modularity. Moreover, it does not require fine-tuning of hyperparameters. It is therefore the only applicable method for finding communities in large graphs. Seven communities were found after applying this approach to the user-based k-core graph. To get a general overview of the communities, we compute the frequencies of hashtags used by the users inside each community. We define the frequency of a hashtag as the number of users using this hashtag inside a community. We notice that first six out of these seven communities have remarkable hashtags with high frequencies that relate each community to a candidate in the election. For example, in one community with 16,190 users, the top three hashtags are #melenchonvagagner, #melenchonsecondtour and #jevotemelenchon with respectively 16,073, 14,378 and 10,127 users. In contrast, no other hashtags supporting other candidates appear in this community\u2019s 50 most frequent hashtags. Thus, we label this community with \u201dMe\u0301lenchon\u201d. Finally, the seventh and last community only holds keywords against the current President of France in the top 50 hashtags. We thus label it as the \u201dAnti-Macron\u201d community. In table 1 we detail the labels, the number of users, as well as the most biased and frequent hashtags for each community."

The resulting word clouds assemble the set of the most frequent unigrams and bigrams (after removing stop words) in each group of tweets, with their sizes proportional to their frequencies. Our analysis shows that except for the community with the \u201dAntiMacron\u201d theme, all the other communities are distinctively composed of users who support one of the candidates among Emmanuel Macron, Vale\u0301rie Pe\u0301cresse, E\u0301ric Zemmour, Jean-Luc Me\u0301lenchon, Marine Le Pen and Yannick Jadot. The word clouds for each of these communities are shown in Figure 1. In addition to identifying which candidate each community of users supports, we can also use the word clouds to obtain a general idea of each candidate\u2019s campaign program. For example, the word cloud for Jadot\u2019s community contains words such as \u201djustice social (social justice)\u201d and \u201de\u0301cologiste (ecologist)\u201d with significant weights, and these concepts precisely lie at the center of his campaign program."

We select users with geolocation information and feed the declared locations into the geolocator from geopy* to obtain the region each area belongs to. We only consider users who are located within Metropolitan France. Although this limits our analysis to a subset of users from the dataset, the distribution can still reflect the overall situation. Given that users are remarkably concentrated in the I\u0302le de France region for all the communities, we plot the choropleth map with the number of users scaled by logarithm to visualize the variations for the other areas more clearly. The choropleth map is shown in Figure 2. Through observing these maps, we can gain insights into each candidate\u2019s respective heartland. For instance, Le Pen has a much higher proportion of supporters in Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Co\u0302te d\u2019Azur and Hauts-de-France than all the other candidates. We also find that the supporters of Macron, Pe\u0301cresse and Me\u0301lenchon are more evenly distributed among different regions outside of I\u0302le de France than the other three candidates. Zemmour and Le Pen both lack Twitter supporters in the middle and northwestern areas, while Jadot lacks supporters in the whole northern half of France except the region Hauts-de-France. Our study was carried out right before the first turn of the election. We later did a follow-up of the actual results and found that the choropleth map of votes* bear a striking resemblance to our choropleth maps of communities.\n*https://github.com/geopy/geopy *https://tinyurl.com/ycxya5dx"

Under such circumstances, automatic detection of offensive language has received much research attention (Risch et al., 2020). With presidential elections being such a controversial topic, relevant tweets are bound to contain offensive language. It is expected that online supporters of a given candidate would make offensive comments towards other candidates and their supporters. However, supporters of the more extreme candidates might also be more inclined to use offensive language. The targets of offensive tweets might include other public groups in addition to opposing candidates and their supporters. We build an automatic classification model to detect offensive tweets in each political community and eventually compare the results across communities."

This choice is made because we aim to detect the origination of offensive language rather than to analyze its propagation pattern. The detection results are shown in Table 2. A key observation is that users from the Anti-Macron and Zemmour communities are the most likely to post offensive tweets, reaching respective proportions of 0.307 and 0.305. This is in line with our expectations: the AntiMacron community is naturally supposed to be more offensive as the main goal is to oppose and defy; as for Zemmour, he is a far-right candidate who has been personally fined e10,000 for hate speech by a Paris court *. We also observe that the communities of right-wing candidates tend to have more offensive content in general, with the only exception being Pe\u0301cresse\u2019s who is\n*https://www.bbc.com/news/ world-europe-60022996\na more moderate candidate.

However, due to the large amount of data we have to process, we need to use a scalable and generalizable models. This study is therefore going to rely on statistical features available in the user metadata object given by the Twitter API.

Therefore, we conjecture that there has not been any large-scale operation to influence the election with bots from any side. Another insight we can get from Table 3 is the campaigning approach of each community. We do not deduplicate tweets to remove retweets, considering the importance of retweeting in automated accounts. For example, the cluster supporting Zemmour, while being smaller than some of the others, has significantly more tweets, including retweets per person, showing the particular engagement Zemmour supporters seem to offer online. Similarly, we can see that it is the only large cluster with the most considerable bot activity, albeit by a small margin. On the other side, we can see that the Pe\u0301cresse cluster, smaller in scale, has heavy activities from bots. This difference in bot activity for the three smallest communities may come from factors such as some very dynamic automated news pages."

While a lot of bots can be found, a nuance is to be made, as bots in a cluster are not necessarily promoting the candidate. Some of the more basic bots that promote cryptocurrency or fishing sites usually simply post the same messages repeatedly, along with all the popular hashtag at a time t. Such a behavior artificially inflates the number of bots we find in the community of candidates that are naturally more active on twitter. The same goes for \u201dautomatized behavior\u201d, as we see in figure 3 and in our feature importance section. While algorithms are accurate, their most discriminative features are the number of statuses, followers, and the age of the user. The situation can be more complicated in the case of politics, as there are actual people who are willing to tweet with the hashtag #Me\u0301lenchonPre\u0301sident one hundred times a day simply because they are extremely passionate about the campaign."

French elections are based on a two-turn system, with the first turn aiming at narrowing down the the list of candidates and only keeping the two largest ones. The continued gathering of data and community detection could show us which communities turn to which candidate during the period between the two turns and how their language habits evolve."
