 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the role of M2 monocytes and their inflammatory response in psoriasis patients, especially the higher IL-6 levels. More research on how this impacts cardiovascular risk is needed. 

2. Examine if blocking IL-6 specifically in M2 monocytes can reduce cardiovascular risk markers like ADAMTS7 in psoriasis patients. This could lead to new targeted therapies.

3. Analyze if modulating the CXCR3-CXCL10 pathway in monocytes can impact their trafficking and recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques. This pathway seems important for plaque development. 

4. Study if mTORC1 inhibition can reduce inflammatory monocyte activation and cardiovascular risk in psoriasis patients. mTORC1 was activated in psoriasis so it's a potential therapeutic target.

5. Further explore if clinical psoriasis severity correlates with the immunological changes identified. If not, better biomarkers are needed to predict cardiovascular risk.
