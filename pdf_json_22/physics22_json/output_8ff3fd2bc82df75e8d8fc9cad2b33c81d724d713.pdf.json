INTRODUCTION\nThe relativistic dynamical inversion technique (or RDI for short), first proposed in Ref. [1], was designed to solve the following problem: Given an arbitrary (desired) spinorial space-time wave packet \u03c8 , find an electromagnetic vector potential A\u03bc such that the Dirac equation is satisfied. Several examples demonstrating the ability of RDI to find novel nontrivial analytical solutions to the Dirac equation were discussed in Refs. [1\u20133]. The most appealing feature of RDI is the clear geometrical meaning bestowed upon the spinor by the Hestenes formalism on which it is based, whose main advantage is that a clear classical interpretation can be given to the elements of the theory; this in turn provides an intuition into how the electron in the quasiclassical approximation is expected to move in the desired field configuration for which the solutions to the Dirac equation are sought, with the information about such \u201cmotion\u201d being encapsulated in the geometrical interpretation of \u03c8 . However, in its current form, RDI is formulated in Cartesian coordinates, which severely hinders the feasibility of the technique to tackle problems possessing certain symmetries, for instance, spherical or\n*agontijo@mpi-hd.mpg.de \u2020fabbri@dime.unige.it\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

A general way to address this issue is to rewrite the equations of RDI in manifestly covariant form. Another advantage in making RDI explicitly covariant is that only then can gravity also be included.\nBefore proceeding, it is noteworthy that Hestenes (see Ref. [4] and references therein) already put forward a covariant version of his technique, which should be equivalent to the one developed here. However, while Hestenes\u2019 formulation relies heavily on his so-called geometric algebra, with a plethora of new symbols and calculation rules, the formalism developed here relies only on basic matrix algebra and tensor calculus and consequently is accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, Hestenes focused mainly on gravitational effects, which might mislead the reader into thinking that these are all his formalism is about; in contrast, our main focus is on the covariance of the formulation, which applies not only to curved space-time, but also to curvilinear coordinates and noninertial frames in flat space-time. In addition, our technique can also deal with space-times endowed with torsion.\nIn this paper we put forward the manifestly covariant relativistic dynamical inversion (CRDI) technique, a formalism which is the offspring of the marriage between the Hestenes formulation and the formalism of polar spinors (see, for instance, Refs. [5,6]). In order to illustrate the usefulness of CRDI, we start with a general form of the spinorial space-time wave packet \u03c8 constituting a general solution to the Dirac equation in Cartesian coordinates and show that a particular case of such a solution is the ground state of the hydrogen atom. Then we make a change from Cartesian to spherical\n2643-1564/2022/4(2)/023140(14) 023140-1 Published by the American Physical Society\ncoordinates and demonstrate a feature of CRDI\u2014the ease of performing a nontrivial change of reference frames\u2014that can potentially be a powerful tool in the quest for novel analytical solutions to the Dirac equation. In addition, we construct a whole family of normalizable analytic solutions to the Dirac equation. More specifically, we find exact solutions for the case of a Dirac electron in the presence of a magnetic field as well as a solution consisting of the combination of a spherically symmetric electric field and magnetic fields. These solutions give some clues as to the relationship between magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the geometrical properties of the Dirac spinor.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II an overview of the steps needed to write the Dirac equation in explicitly covariant form is given. In Sec. III we summarize both the Hestenes formalism and the RDI technique. Then we present a step-by-step derivation of CRDI in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we first show how the chosen general \u03c8 reproduces the solutions presented in Ref. [3] and then proceed to describe two families of analytical solutions of the Dirac equation constructed with the help of the technique developed in this paper. In Sec. VI we analyze these solutions in light of the geometrical interpretation of CRDI. Finally, in Sec. VII we draw some conclusions and highlight some of the potential applications of CRDI."

            "text": "In this section we describe the steps needed to write the Dirac equation in manifestly covariant form. This discussion is based on the procedure introduced in Ref. [7].\nHereinafter, Greek indices label the space-time manifold, while Latin indices label the tangent space to the manifold. Since in Secs. III A and III C there is no distinction between Greek and Latin indices (everything is written in Cartesian coordinates), we use Greek indices throughout both sections.\nThe general procedure to write the Dirac equation in explicitly covariant form is as follows: Choose a single point on a curved manifold. There the manifold is exactly equal to the tangent space at the chosen point. Since we are considering the Lorentzian curved metric tensor, the tangent space at every point will be Minkowski space. One can then define a field at each point that transforms as a scalar under coordinate transformations in the curved manifold, and as a spinor under the Lorentz group in the tangent space. Given that at the chosen point the curved manifold and the tangent space are identical, one has just constructed a Lorentz spinor at one point on a curved manifold. One may then construct such an object at every other point.\nEach point on the curved manifold has its own independent tangent space in which it can transform under an arbitrary Lorentz transformation. Thus, to simultaneously define a Lorentz spinor at all points on a curved manifold, one must let it transform under local Lorentz transformation in each independent tangent space at each point. Therefore the first step to write the Dirac equation in covariant form is to construct the complexification of the SO(1, 3) gauge theory for spinors.\nTo identify the space of SO(1, 3) gauge transformations with the space tangent to the manifold at each point, one must do the following: First, as stated at the beginning of this\nsection, one must identify the SO(1, 3) indices (Latin indices) with the tangent space Lorentz indices. Second, one must find a way to define an independent set of gamma matrices at each point on the curved manifold which act at the tangent space at that point. Third, one must find a way to relate the spin connection to the geometry of the curved manifold such that a tangent space Lorentz transformation under which the theory must be invariant simply translates to a SO(1, 3) gauge transformation on the spinor field.\nThe first task can be straightforwardly taken care of by simply identifying the Latin indices with flat Lorentz indices. The other two are more involved. It turns out that the first step towards simultaneously tackling both of them is to introduce a new field that relates the curved metric to the tangent space metric. It is called the tetrads, commonly denoted in the literature by the symbols e\u03bca and e a \u03bc, obeying the following relations:\n\u03b7abe a \u03bce b \u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd, (1)\nwhere \u03b7ab is the Minkowski metric on the flat tangent space while g\u03bc\u03bd is the curved metric tensor on the manifold. The geometrical meaning of the tetrads is that they constitute a set of four orthonormal vectors (in terms of the Minkowski metric) at each point on the tangent space to the manifold. The definition of the gamma matrices as matrix-valued functions of the coordinates on the manifold is done by imposing that they must obey the following curved Clifford algebra:\n{\u03b3 \u03bc, \u03b3 \u03bd} = 2g\u03bc\u03bd1, (2) where 1 is the 4 \u00d7 4 identity matrix and {\u00b7, \u00b7} is the anticommutator. The tetrad is relevant here because the solution to the above anticommutation relation can simply be written in terms of the standard flat gamma matrices using the tetrad, that is,\nea\u03bd\u03b3a = \u03b3\u03bd. (3) Finally, the third and final task is to write the spin connection in terms of the geometry of the curved manifold so that tangent space Lorentz transformations under which the theory must be invariant simply translate to SO(1, 3) gauge transformation, under which the theory is already invariant. This can be done, it turns out, by using the so-called \u201cmetronilic\u201d property, \u2207\u03bc\u03b3\u03bd = 0. This task is more involved and will be addressed in Sec. IV A."

By definition the scalar product of these vectors is just the components \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd of the metric tensor\n1 2 (\u03b3\u03bc\u03b3\u03bd + \u03b3\u03bd\u03b3\u03bc) = \u03b3\u03bc \u00b7 \u03b3\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd (4)\n023140-2\ngenerating an associative algebra over the real numbers, which has been called the space-time algebra by Hestenes. It provides a direct and complete algebraic characterization of the geometric properties of Minkowski space-time in Cartesian coordinates. In the standard representation the Dirac equation for an electron with charge e and mass m in an external electromagnetic field A\u03bc reads\n\u03b3 \u03bc(ih\u0304\u2202\u03bc \u2212 eA\u03bc)\u03c8 = mc\u03c8. (5) The Dirac spinor \u03c8 \u2208 C4 obeying (5) is a column vector with four complex components,\n\u03c8 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u03c81 \u03c82\n\u03c83\n\u03c84\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nr0 \u2212 ir3 r2 \u2212 ir1 s3 + is0 s1 + is2\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0, (6)\nwhere the s\u03bc and r\u03bc are real functions of space-time. The representation (6) in terms of the components \u03c81, \u03c82, \u03c83, \u03c84 presumes a specific representation of the Dirac matrices, the standard (Dirac) representation,\n\u03b30 = ( I 0 0 \u2212I ) , \u03b3k = ( 0 \u2212\u03c3k \u03c3k 0 ) , (7)\nsubject to \u03b3 0(\u03b3 \u03bc)\u2020\u03b3 0 = \u03b3 \u03bc as well as \u03b3 2(\u03b3 \u03bc)\u2217\u03b3 2 = \u03b3 \u03bc, where I is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity and \u03c3k are the Pauli matrices.\nThe matrices \u03b1k = \u03b3k\u03b30 are to be interpreted as unit quaternions. The \u03b1k generates an algebra over the real numbers which is isomorphic to the Pauli algebra. This fact is emphasized by writing\n\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13 = \u03b30\u03b31\u03b32\u03b33 = i, i2 = \u22121. (8) Thus i plays a role similar to that played by i = \u221a\u22121 in the Pauli algebra. In quaternion theory, it is an additional operator which commutes with the \u03b1k and squares to \u22121. From the standard representation (7) it follows that\n\u03b1k = (\n0 \u03c3k \u03c3k 0\n) , i = ( 0 iI\niI 0\n) ,\ni\u03b1k = ( i\u03c3k 0\n0 i\u03c3k\n) , \u03b3 5 = i\u03b3 0\u03b3 1\u03b3 2\u03b3 3 = ( 0 I\nI 0\n) . (9)\nBy introducing the canonical basis in the spinor space\nu1 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 1 0 0\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0, u2 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 0 1 0\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0, u3 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 0 0 1\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0, u4 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 0 0 0\n1\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0,\n(10)\n\u03b30u1 = u1, i\u03b13u1 = \u03b32\u03b31u1 = iu1, (11)\nu2 = \u2212i\u03b12u1, u3 = \u03b13u1, u4 = \u03b11u1, (12) we have that the Dirac spinor \u03c8 given in (6) in this representation can be written as\n\u03c8 = \u03c81u1 + \u03c82u2 + \u03c83u3 + \u03c84u4 = [r01 + (s1\u03b11 + s2\u03b12 + s3\u03b13)\n\u2212 i(r1\u03b11 + r2\u03b12 + r3\u03b13) + is0]u1, (13)\nwhere relations (11) and (12) have been used. Thus any Dirac spinor \u03c8 can be written as\n\u03c8 = u1, (14) where can be written down directly from the column matrix form (6) by using\n= r01 + (s1\u03b11 + s2\u03b12 + s3\u03b13) \u2212 i(r1\u03b11 + r2\u03b12 + r3\u03b13) + is0\n= \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u03c81 \u2212\u03c8\u22172 \u03c83 \u03c8\u22174 \u03c82 \u03c8 \u2217 1 \u03c84 \u2212\u03c8\u22173 \u03c83 \u03c8 \u2217 4 \u03c81 \u2212\u03c8\u22172\n\u03c84 \u2212\u03c8\u22173 \u03c82 \u03c8\u22171\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0. (15)\nThe matrix spinor is then a general complex quaternion. The most general form of the spinor can be translated into the polar form = \u221a\u03c1 exp (i\u03b2/2)R, (16) where R = BU [10]. The matrices U and B are unitary and Hermitian, respectively, with U encoding the rotations and B performing the boosts. From Eq. (16) we have, noting that U\u03b30 = \u03b30U ,\n\u03b30\u0303 = \u03c1v/ = \u03c1B\u03b30B\u22121 = \u03c1B2\u03b30 (17) since B\u22121 = B\u0303 = \u03b30B\u2020\u03b30 = \u03b30B\u03b30. Then\n\u03b33\u0303 = \u03c1s/ = \u03c1BU\u03b33U \u2020B\u22121 = \u03c1BU\u03b13U \u2020B\u03b30 (18) for the spin. Before proceeding, we would like to address the issue of why the vector spin density in (18) is calculated with \u03b33 and does not involve \u03b35. The reason is that it is a feature of the Hestenes formalism; in such a formalism the \u03b35 is somewhat hidden in the definition of the matrix spinor, while the \u03b33 appears because the spin is aligned along the third axis. However, these are only \u201cincidents\u201d of the choice of formalism. Of course, when written in the usual formalism, the \u03b33 leaves its place to the \u03b35\u03b33, and all the usual definitions are recovered. Finally, we would like to call attention to the following definitions:\n\u22121 = \u0303 \u0303 , \u0303 = \u03b30 \u2020\u03b30, \u0303 = \u03c1ei\u03b2, R\u22121 = R\u0303. (19)\nThe general matrix spinor (16) satisfies the Hestenes-Dirac equation\n(h\u0304c\u2202/ \u03b32\u03b31 \u2212 cqA/ ) = mc2 \u03b30, (20) where A/ = A\u03bc\u03b3\u03bc and \u2202/ = \u03b3 \u03bc\u2202\u03bc. The factorization (16) implies\n\u2202/ = 12 (\u2202/ ln \u03c1 + \u2202/\u03b2i \u2212 2\u03b3 \u03bcR\u2202\u03bcR\u22121) . (21) Substituting (21) into (20) leads to\nh\u0304(\u2202/ ln \u221a \u03c1 + \u2202/\u03b2i 2\n\u2212 \u03b3 \u03bcR\u2202\u03bcR\u22121) \u03b32\u03b31 \u2212 qA/ = mc \u03b30. (22)\n023140-3"

III A; this equivalence was previously discussed by G\u00fcrsey in Ref. [9].\nIn the Baylis formalism the state \u03c8 can be represented by the following matrix :\n\u03c8 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u03c81 \u03c82 \u03c83\n\u03c84\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 \u21d0\u21d2 = ( \u03c81 + \u03c83 \u2212\u03c8\u22172 + \u03c8\u22174 \u03c82 + \u03c84 \u03c8\u22171 \u2212 \u03c8\u22173 ) .

One should notice the following: U U \u2020 = , (31)\nshowing that the complete 4 \u00d7 4 Baylis form is just the Hestenes matrix form up to a unitary transformation. The specific unitary transformation is nothing else but the transformation that performs the passage to the chiral (Weyl) representation, that is, U = 1\u221a\n2 (1 + \u03b3 5\u03b30).\nThe matrix spinor (31) can be written in the following general form:\n= ( Q 0\n0 \u03c32(Q\u2020)T \u03c32\n) ,\nQ = r0 \u2212 is0 \u2212 i(rk \u2212 isk )\u03c3k .

We need these conditions to ensure that is invertible, as needed for the CRDI procedure.\nCalling Q = SV , with S = \u221ar\u03bcr\u03bc \u2212 s\u03bcs\u03bc \u2212 2ir\u03bcs\u03bc and Det [V ] = 1, we have that the function S can also be expressed as S = \u221a\u03c1ei\u03b2/2, where\n\u221a \u03c1 = [(r\u03bcr\u03bc \u2212 s\u03bcs\u03bc)2 + 4(r\u03bcs\u03bc)2]1/2, (34)\n\u03b2 = \u00b1 arctan (\n2r\u03bcs\u03bc r\u03bcr\u03bc \u2212 s\u03bcs\u03bc\n) . (35)\nThe minus (plus) sign is for Q [\u03c32(Q\u2020)T \u03c32]. Finally, we have\n= \u221a\u03c1 ( e\u2212i\u03b2/2V 0\n0 ei\u03b2/2\u03c32(V \u2020)T \u03c32\n) . (36)\nBy construction, V is a unimodular 2 \u00d7 2 complex matrix forming the group SL(2,C), which is the complex three-dimensional manifold having six degrees of freedom associated with the parameters of boosts and rotations.\n023140-4\nIt is instructive to check how this unitary transformation affects Eq. (14):\nU\u03c8 = u1, Uu1 = 1\u221a 2 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 1 0 1\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0. (37)\nGiven that U is the unitary transformation connecting the standard representation to the chiral representation, is the 4 \u00d7 4 double cover of the Lorentz group. It then follows that the matrix spinor is writable as\n= \u221a\u03c1 exp (i\u03b2/2)R, (38)\nR = U \u2020 ( V 0\n0 \u03c32(V \u2020)T \u03c32\n) U, (39)\nwith R being a unimodular 4 \u00d7 4 complex matrix corresponding to the general Lorentz transformations. It is noteworthy that the scalar function \u03b2 (known as Yvon-Takabayashi (YT) angle [13,14]) is believed to be directly related to antiparticles (see, for instance, Ref. [15]): Specifically, its being zero corresponds to a pure particle state, and its being \u03c0 corresponds to a pure antiparticle state, with any value in between corresponding to mixed states [5]. The mathematical meaning of \u03b2 is, however, very straightforward. It simply describes the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the electron, for instance, the spin-orbit coupling. This point will become clear in the examples presented below."

            "text": "In the previous two sections, we have introduced the Hestenes formalism in standard representation and showed that in the chiral representation it is equivalent to the Baylis formalism; chiral representations are important because they keep the irreducible parts separated. Nevertheless, at least in four dimensions, all representations are unitarily equivalent. The same could be said for all possible systems of coordinates used to write the Dirac spinor and the Dirac equation. Just the same, it would be important to have a formalism that is covariant in a manifest way for two reasons: The first is that the passage from Cartesian to any other system of coordinates can be done straightforwardly; the second, and most important, is that only in a clearly covariant form can gravity be included. In the following we are then going to consider only the generally covariant form of the Dirac spinor field theory, employing it with the Hestenes formalism so as to keep the advantages of RDI.\nIn the most general form, complex Lorentz transformations are given in terms of Clifford matrices \u03b3a such that (2) holds.\nThen we can define\n1 4 [\u03b3a,\u03b3b] = \u03c3ab, (40)\nwhere \u03c3ab also verify\n2i\u03c3ab = \u03b5abcd\u03b3 5\u03c3 cd (41) implicitly defining the \u03b3 5 matrix in terms of the completely antisymmetric pseudotensor.

This last relationship, in particular, tells us that the \u03c3ab matrices are the generators of the Lorentz algebra, so that with parameters \u03b8i j = \u2212\u03b8 ji we can write\n= e 12 \u03b8ab\u03c3 ab (47) as Lorentz transformations. To make them explicit, we define the following quantities:\na = \u2212 18\u03b8i j\u03b8 i j, (48)\nb = 116\u03b8i j\u03b8ab\u03b5i jab (49) and then\n2x2 = a + \u221a a2 + b2, (50)\n2y2 = \u2212a + \u221a\na2 + b2 (51) so as to introduce the parameters\ncos y cosh x = X, (52)\nsin y sinh x = Y, (53)( x sinh x cos y + y sin y cosh x\nx2 + y2 ) \u03b8ab\n+ (\nx cosh x sin y \u2212 y cos y sinh x x2 + y2\n) 1\n2 \u03b8i j\u03b5\ni jab = Zab, (54)\nwhich verify\nX 2 \u2212 Y 2 + 18 ZabZab = 1, (55)\n2XY \u2212 116 Zi jZab\u03b5i jab = 0 (56) in general. Using (45), one can prove that\n= X1 + Yi\u03b3 5 + 12 Zab\u03c3ab (57) in the most compact way. One might also be convinced of this result by considering single rotations or boosts and verify by\n023140-5\ndirect inspection that (57) reduces to the known forms. The inverse is\n\u22121 = e\u2212 12 \u03b8ab\u03c3 ab, (58) written explicitly as\n\u22121 = X1 + Yi\u03b3 5 \u2212 12 Zab\u03c3ab, (59) as is clear after using relations (55) and (56) given above. With this transformation we can define spinor fields as what transforms according to\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 (60) in the most general case. Notice that we have\n( )ab \u03b3 b \u22121 = \u03b3 a, (61)\nwhere ( )ab such that ( ) a k ( ) b j\u03b7 k j = \u03b7ab is a transformation that belongs to the SO(1, 3) group and that is the real representation of the Lorentz transformation. For future convenience, let us introduce\n(\u2202\u03bcXZ ab \u2212 X\u2202\u03bcZab) + 12 (\u2202\u03bcY Zi j \u2212 Y \u2202\u03bcZi j )\u03b5i jab\n+\u2202\u03bcZakZbk = \u2212\u2202\u03bc\u03b6 ab, (62) in terms of which we can write\n\u22121\u2202\u03bc = 12\u2202\u03bc\u03b6ab\u03c3 ab (63) with (55) and (56) used throughout the computations.\nGiven that the Lorentz transformations can have parameters that are local, we must expect some form of gauge potential and a spinor covariant derivative. By defining the gauge potential as the spinorial connection \u03bc transforming as\n\u03bc \u2192 ( \u03bc \u2212 \u22121\u2202\u03bc ) \u22121, (64) it is easy to prove that the object\n\u2207\u03bc\u03c8 = \u2202\u03bc\u03c8 + \u03bc\u03c8 (65) transforms as a covariant derivative of the spinor. Hence the conditions \u2207\u03bc\u03b3\u03bd = 0 can be expanded into\n\u03bc = 12 i j\u03bc\u03c3 i j, (66) where\nij\u03bc = e\u03bdj ei\u03c3 ( \u03c3\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 e\u03c3a \u2202\u03bcea\u03bd ) ,\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd = g\u03c3\u03c1\n2 (\u2202\u03b1g\u03c1\u03bd + \u2202\u03bdg\u03b1\u03c1 \u2212 \u2202\u03c1g\u03b1\u03bd ),\nas the most general (non-conformally-invariant) decomposition of the spinor connection. With this the final task described in Sec. II is taken care of. The above discussion is a general introduction to spinor fields and their covariant derivatives. We will now try to see how Hestenes matrix spinors fit into this scheme.\nTo begin our analysis, let us consider the Hestenes matrix spinor given in (15). The first column is of course the spinor \u03c8 itself. The third column is \u03b3 5\u03c8 in the standard representation (9). As for the second and fourth columns, their meaning may look more cumbersome, but in fact they are merely \u03b3 5i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 and i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 still in the standard representation. That is, any\ncolumn is obtained from the first after applying the discrete transformations\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5\u03c8, (67)\n\u03c8 \u2192 i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 (68) or combinations thereof. There is a straightforward physical meaning for this: Starting from the first column describing a matter state of defined eigenspin, the third column is just the corresponding antimatter state of same eigenspin. The second and fourth columns are then the matter and antimatter states of inverted eigen-spin. It is rather important to notice two things: First, despite having deduced everything from the Hestenes formalism given in standard representation, if we were to write the spinor (15) in the form (note that each entrance separated by a \u201c|\u201d corresponds to a column matrix)\n= (\u03c8 | \u03b3 5i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 | \u03b3 5\u03c8 | i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217), (69) this way of writing the spinor would be representation independent. Second, because we have \u03b3 2(\u03b3 \u03bc)\u2217\u03b3 2 = \u03b3 \u03bc and [\u03b3 5, \u03c3i j] = 0, it is easy to prove the following:\n\u03b3 5\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5\u03c8, (70)\ni\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 \u2192 i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217, (71) from which one can conclude that\n\u2192 (72) in general. In polar form (16), because \u03c1 and \u03b2 are real scalars, the transformation law is inherited entirely by R in the form R \u2192 R showing that this is just what we have for Lorentz transformations. Therefore the covariant derivative of is the same as \u03c8 and\n\u2207\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + \u03bc (73) in the most general situation. From the polar form we have\n\u2207\u03bc = [ 1 2 (\u2202\u03bc ln \u03c1 + i\u2202\u03bc\u03b2 ) + ( \u03bc \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121) ] , (74)\nwhere the first set of parentheses contains the covariant derivatives of the two real scalars and we have an additional expression in parentheses whose meaning is still not obvious. However, we can prove that it is perfectly covariant. To see this, consider that as mentioned above, R \u2192 R, and combine it with (64); putting things together yields\n\u03bc\u2212R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 \u2192 ( \u03bc \u2212 \u22121\u2202\u03bc ) \u22121 \u2212 R\u2202\u03bc(R\u22121 \u22121) = \u03bc \u22121 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u22121 \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 \u22121\n\u2212 RR\u22121\u2202\u03bc \u22121 = \u03bc \u22121 \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 \u22121 = ( \u03bc \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121) \u22121 (75)\nas the transformation law of the \u03bc \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 object, therefore demonstrating its manifest covariance. Hence we may define\n\u03bc \u2212 R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 = \u2212R\u03bc, (76) in terms of which\n\u2207\u03bc = [ 1 2 (\u2207\u03bc ln \u03c1 + i\u2207\u03bc\u03b2 ) \u2212 R\u03bc ] , (77)\nnow clearly manifestly covariant in each term separately.\n023140-6\nAs a further step, we will see how R\u03bc decomposes in terms of simpler expressions. Because in general we have\nR\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 = 12\u2202\u03bc\u03be ab\u03c3ab (78) for some \u03be ab, and given (66), we can define\n\u2202\u03bc\u03bei j \u2212 i j\u03bc \u2261Ri j\u03bc (79) so that\nR\u03bc = 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j (80) with Ri j\u03bc real tensorial quantities. In fact, as\n1 2 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j \u2192 ( 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j) \u22121, (81) the linear independence of the sigmas and (61) give\nRab\u03bc \u2192 Ri j\u03bc( \u22121)ia( \u22121) jb, (82) showing that Ri j\u03bc has the transformation law of a real tensor. Moreover, the velocity and spin vectors, (17) and (18), satisfy the following geometrical identities:\n\u2207\u03bcvi = Ri j\u03bcv j, \u2207\u03bcsi = Ri j\u03bcs j . (83) The spinorial covariant derivative is then\n\u2207\u03bc = (\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 + i\u03b3 5\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2 \u2212 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j) (84)\nin the most general circumstance. In fact, (84) is valid in any coordinate system, including curved space-times.\nB. Introduction of torsion\nBecause we are dealing with generic space-times in which gravity can be present, it may be instructive, for the sake of completeness, to also allow torsion. The Dirac matter field equations in this case are [16]\ni\u03b3 \u03bc\u2207\u03bc\u03c8 \u2212 XW\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc\u03b3 5\u03c8 \u2212 m\u03c8 = 0 (85) with W\u03bc being the torsion and X being the torsion-spin coupling constant. These equations can be written in the Hestenes formalism by employing the polar form and keeping track of the transformation of the spinor under \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2192 i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217; eventually, it is easy to verify that\ni\u03b3 \u03bc(\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 + i\u03b3 5\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2) \u2212 i 2 Ri j\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc\u03c3 i j\n\u2212 XW\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc\u03b3 5 \u2212 m \u03b3 3\u03b3 5 = 0 (86) as the Dirac equation for the Hestenes spinor. Equation (86) is manifestly covariant as is straightforward to see."

            "text": "Having written the Dirac equation in curvilinear coordinates for curved space-times in the presence of torsion, the only missing interaction for single-particle systems is electrodynamics. In order to add it, we will employ the concept of gauge covariance. When gauge covariance is present, it simply means that complex objects transform according to an additional phase eiq\u03be . One may then wonder, What is the effect of such a phase shift on the Hestenes spinor? In order\nto answer this question, we have to consider that the discrete transformations \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3 5\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2192 i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 lead to\n\u03b3 5\u03c8 \u2192 eiq\u03be \u03b3 5\u03c8, (87)\ni\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217 \u2192 e\u2212iq\u03be i\u03b3 2\u03c8\u2217, (88) where now the phase is no longer the same for the second and fourth columns. As a consequence, the full transformation for the gauge phase would be\n\u2192 exp (\u2212q\u03be\u03b3 1\u03b3 2), (89) which can be easily checked. We notice that the phase ultimately acts as if it were a rotation around the third axis.\nThe covariant derivatives have to be updated with the gauge potential, which transforms as\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc\u03be, (90) ensuring that\n\u2207\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 qA\u03bc \u03b3 1\u03b3 2 (91) is the gauge covariant derivative of the matrix spinor. Thence the matrix spinor in polar form now reads = \u221a\u03c1 exp (i\u03b2/2)R exp (q\u03be\u03b3 1\u03b3 2), (92) so that upon introduction of the object\nq(\u2202\u03bc\u03be \u2212 A\u03bc)\u2261P\u03bc (93) proven to be a real vector, one can write\n\u2207\u03bc = (\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 + i\u03b3 5\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2 \u2212 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j) + P\u03bc \u03b3 1\u03b3 2\n(94)\nas can be easily checked. Finally, the Dirac equations are\ni\u03b3 \u03bc(\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 + i\u03b3 5\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2) \u2212 i 2 Ri j\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc\u03c3 i j\n+ iP\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 1\u03b3 2 \u2212 XW\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc\u03b3 5 \u2212 m \u03b3 3\u03b3 5 = 0, (95) which are the most general equations, despite the explicit appearance of \u03b3a in them, which are determined only within a proper Lorentz transformation. So it cannot be overemphasized that the vectors \u03b3a need not be associated a priori with any coordinate systems, but are simply a set of arbitrarily chosen orthonormal vectors, much in the same way in which \u03b32 is used to define the procedure of charge conjugation without implying any dependence on the second axis of the coordinate system.\nThe advantage of writing (95) is straightforward: Because the spinor is in the form of an invertible matrix, it is immediate to invert the Dirac equation with respect to the electrodynamic potential. Then, solutions of the Maxwell equations can be obtained very easily. Before describing the inversion, let us massage a bit (95), so that one can more easily compare it with (22), by multiplying it to the right with \u03b3 2\u03b3 1. Hence, after collecting all the terms, we end up with\n\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 \u2212 i(\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2 + XW\u03bc) \u2212 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j ) \u03b3 2\u03b3 1\n+ P\u03bc\u03b3 \u03bc \u2212 m \u03b3 0 = 0. (96)\n023140-7\nThe inversion is then[ \u03b3 \u03bc (\u2207\u03bc ln \u221a\u03c1 \u2212 i(\u2207\u03bc\u03b2/2 + XW\u03bc) \u2212 12 Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j ) \u03b3 2\u03b3 1\n\u2212 m \u03b3 0] \u22121 = \u2212\u03b3 \u03bcP\u03bc, (97) showing that it is possible to write P\u03bc in terms of something that does not contain P\u03bc itself. Because P\u03bc is the only instance containing A\u03bc, the electrodynamics is inverted. Since we will not be considering torsion in this paper, hereinafter we choose X = 0 in (95) and (97).\nBy following the procedure of [17] one can see that\nP\u03b7 = mc cos \u03b2v\u03b7 + h\u0304 2 [(\u2202\u03bc\u03b2 + B\u03bc)v\u03bcs\u03b7\n\u2212 (\u2202\u03bc\u03b2 + B\u03bc)s\u03bcv\u03b7 \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc ln \u03c1 + R\u03bc)s\u03b1v\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7], (98) where R\u03bc = R a\u03bca and B\u03bc = 12\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7R\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7. It is noteworthy that in order to calculate the vector potential from (98), one needs to get the functions \u03b2, s\u03bc, v\u03bc, B\u03bc, and R\u03bc using the matrix spinor . We notice that according to (98), P\u03b7 is a real function, so taking (93) written as A\u03bc \u2261\u2202\u03bc\u03be \u2212 P\u03bc/q shows that A\u03b7 is also real, and therefore A\u03b7 describes a real electrodynamic potential, as expected. This seems to indicate that P\u03b7 is the momentum of the particle. This can definitively be accepted by considering that in the case of plane waves (94) reduces to\n\u2207\u03bc = P\u03bc \u03b3 1\u03b3 2, (99) which is equivalent to\n\u2207\u03bc\u03c8 = \u2212iP\u03bc\u03c8 (100) as can be seen in Ref. [18]. This is precisely the definition of the quantum mechanical momentum. A final confirmation comes from its macroscopic limit, taken when the spin is approximated to zero. This implies that s\u03b7 and \u03b2 vanish [5]. In this case, P\u03b7 \u2192 mcv\u03b7, which is precisely the kinematic momentum. This also shows that the full momentum is given by the simplest kinematic momentum with two corrections. One is the multiplication by cos \u03b2, and it accounts for the internal dynamics [5]; the other is the addition of a term that is linear in h\u0304 and as such accounts for quantum mechanical corrections. In fact, it can be proven that these corrections are precisely the quantum potential of the de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory extended to the relativistic case with spin [19].\nAlso, from the Dirac equation we extract the following constraints on the velocity \u03c1v/ and spin \u03c1s/ vector densities:\n\u2207\u03bc(\u03c1v\u03bc) = 0, (101)\n\u2207\u03bc(\u03c1s\u03bc) = \u22122mc h\u0304 \u03c1 sin \u03b2. (102)\nEquations (98), (101), and (102) correspond to the covariant generalization of (26), (27), and (25). Note that, based on the discussion of Sec. III, an important feature of CRDI is that it can be straightforwardly connected with the quaternion formalism of G\u00fcrsey (see also Ref. [20]).\nIn what follows we will apply (98), (101), and (102) to construct a family of analytical solutions to the Dirac equation in spherical coordinates in order to illustrate the power of CRDI.\nV. ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE METHOD\nIn this section, we start with the Dirac representation of the gamma matrices in Cartesian coordinates and will transform them to spherical coordinates using tetrads. Moreover, in addition to presenting an example for the method, we will also choose the example to be representing a specific physical situation that we find extremely intriguing, namely, the one in which the YT angle is taken to generate a spin-orbit coupling."

The other degrees of freedom are the real constant , the rotation U , and the boost B. In analogy to the classical Kepler problem, we consider an electron moving in a circular orbit on the x-y plane; such a feature is described by the boost. Since the electron is in an accelerated frame, there is also a precession of the spin vector, which is given by U . The specific form of the rotation matrix is a consequence of the conservation of total angular momentum due to its dependence on the rapidity tanh( w2 ), which follows from the spin-orbit coupling. Thus the physically relevant potentials derived from the matrix spinor (103) are the ones for which the total angular momentum is conserved."

Moreover, let us make the following choice of density:\n\u221a \u03c1 = \u03ba e\n\u2212G/2\nr (X 2 + | cos \u03b8 |2)1/4, (108)\nfor some function G = G(r) and where \u03ba is a normalization constant.\nSubstituting this into (103) gives\n= \u221a\u03c1ei \u03b22 BUe\u2212\u03b32\u03b31( t/h\u0304\u2212\u03c6/2), (109)\nB = e(\u2212 sin \u03c6\u03b31\u03b30+cos \u03c6\u03b32\u03b30 ) arctanh( f )2 , (110)\nU = e\u2212\u03b32\u03b31\u03c6/2e\u2212\u03b33\u03b31 /2, (111)\n= arccos ( |sin \u03b8 |2X + |cos \u03b8 |2\u221aX 2 + 1\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ) , (112)\nfrom which we extract the spinor\n\u03c8 = \u03bae \u2212 i th\u0304 \u2212 G2\u221a\n2r \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u221a X + \u221a1 + X 2 0 i cos \u03b8\u221a X+\u221a1+X 2\ni e i\u03c6 sin \u03b8\u221a\nX+\u221a1+X 2\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(113)\nthat solves the Dirac equation for the vector potential A0 = \u2212V (r) and A = 0 calculated from (26) and (27), as long as the constraints\ndX dr = \u22122\n\u221a X 2 + 1\nr\n( r [\nh\u0304c + V h\u0304\n]\u221a 1 + X 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 mc\nh\u0304 rX\n) ,\n(114)\ndG dr = 2\n( mc\nh\u0304\n\u221a 1 + X 2 \u2212 X\n[\nh\u0304c + V h\u0304\n]) (115)\nare imposed on X and G. The constraints imposed on X and G are needed so that the second equation in (25) is satisfied while the first equation is obeyed regardless. Before proceeding, let us analyze the definition (108). Such a form of density is not arbitrary; it is given by (34). There is another way of getting the density that relies solely on the matrix part of (109). Consider a general function \u221a \u03c1. By looking at the matrix ei \u03b2 2 BUe\u03b32\u03b31\u03c6/2 one notes that all of its columns are\nmultiplied by the term (X 2 + | cos \u03b8 |2)\u22121/4. Given that the potential has spherical symmetry, the components of \u03c8 (i.e., the first column of ) must be written as the product of a radialonly function and an angular-only function [e.g., \u03b6 (r)\u03b7(\u03b8, \u03c6)]. Since the only term that cannot be written in such a way is the overall multiplying function (X 2 + | cos \u03b8 |2)\u22121/4, one must choose \u221a \u03c1 = \u03b6 (r)(X 2 + | cos \u03b8 |2)1/4 for some real function \u03b6 (r) which must obey the constraint limr\u2192\u221e \u03b6 (r) = 0. The specific form of \u03b6 (r) chosen here is inspired by the spinor in the ground state of the hydrogen atom.\nThe equation for X can be cast into the form of a Riccati differential equation. For instance, upon making the substitution X = \u2212csch(2arctanh[Z (r)]), we get\ndZ dr = Z (r) 2(c2m \u2212 cV \u2212 ) ch\u0304 \u2212 c 2m + cV + ch\u0304 + 2Z (r) r ,\n(116)\ndG dr = Z (r)(c 2m \u2212 cV \u2212 ) ch\u0304 + c 2m + cV + ch\u0304Z (r) . (117)\nHence a solution of the equation for Z (r) that is guaranteed to exist should be substituted into the equation for G, which is then integrated.\nWe next move from Cartesian to spherical coordinates. To do that, we first notice that (108) and (113) retain their current form in spherical coordinates since the spinors transform as scalars under a change of coordinates. To build the tetrads, we start by considering the metric tensor\ngtt = 1, grr = \u22121, g\u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212r2, g\u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212r2|sin \u03b8 |2, (118)\ngiving connections\n\u03b8\u03b8r = \u03c6\u03c6r = 1\nr , (119)\nr\u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212r, (120)\nr\u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212r|sin \u03b8 |2, (121)\n\u03c6 \u03c6\u03b8 = cot \u03b8, (122)\n\u03b8\u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 (123) that are used in the calculation of the components of the spin connection \u03bc. Next we use the unitary operator U = e\u2212\u03b32\u03b31\u03c6/2e\u2212\u03b31\u03b33\u03b8/2 in order to construct the gamma matrices on the manifold \u03b3\u03bd (note that \u03b3t = \u03b30 in this case),\n\u03b3r = U\u03b33U\u2020, \u03b3\u03b8 = rU\u03b31U\u2020, \u03b3\u03c6 = r| sin \u03b8 |U\u03b32U\u2020, (124)\n\u03b3 r = U\u03b3 3U\u2020, \u03b3 \u03b8 = 1 r U\u03b3 1U\u2020, \u03b3 \u03c6 = 1\nr| sin \u03b8 |U\u03b3 2U\u2020, (125)\nas can be easily checked. From ea\u03bd\u03b3a = \u03b3\u03bd we extract the tetrads\ne0t = 1, (126)\ne1r = cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, e2r = sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, (127)\n023140-9\ne3r = cos \u03b8, (128)\ne1\u03b8 = r cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, e2\u03b8 = r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, (129)\ne3\u03b8 = \u2212r sin \u03b8, (130)\ne1\u03c6 = \u2212r sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, e2\u03c6 = r cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, (131) with dual\net0 = 1, (132)\ner1 = cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, er2 = sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, (133)\ner3 = cos \u03b8, (134)\ne\u03b81 = 1\nr cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, e\u03b82 =\n1 r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, (135)\ne\u03b83 = \u2212 1\nr sin \u03b8, (136)\ne\u03c61 = \u2212 sin \u03c6 1\nr sin \u03b8 , e\u03c62 = cos \u03c6\n1\nr sin \u03b8 . (137)\nIt turns out that the above tetrads give a zero spin connection. Also, with the matrix spinor (103) we calculate the following normalized components of the spin (18) and velocity (17):\ns1 = (\u2212X + \u221a\nX 2 + 1) sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (138)\ns2 = (\u2212X + \u221a\nX 2 + 1) sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (139)\ns3 = | sin \u03b8 | 2X + | cos \u03b8 |2\u221aX 2 + 1\u221a\n| cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (140)\nv0 = \u221a\nX 2 + 1\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , v1 = \u2212 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (141)\nv2 = sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (142)\nwhere we recall that X = X (r) everywhere. Let us pause now and consider for a moment the components of the spin vector. By making the definition\nV = (\u2212X + \u221a\nX 2 + 1) sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ,\nwith range 0 V ( \u221a X 2 + 1 \u2212 X )/\u221a2 + 4X 2, the spin components (138), (139), and (140) then take the simple form\ns1 = V cos \u03c6, s2 = V sin \u03c6, s3 = \u221a\n1 \u2212 V2, (143) which, for the case of the H atom (i.e., if X is constant), is just the parametrization of the upper hemisphere of a sphere of radius ( \u221a X 2 + 1 \u2212 X )/\u221a2 + 4X 2; the geometrical interpretation of this result is straightforward: Considering (143) as a parametric equation with parameters \u03c6 and \u03b8 , it can be interpreted that the spin vector precesses, with its tip constrained to move on the upper hemisphere of a sphere whose radius is a function of X . Hence the chosen matrix spinor (103) successfully describes the motion of an electron whose velocity lies\non the x-y plane and whose spin vector wobbles on a surface in which the polar angle lies in the region 0 \u03b8 \u03c0/4 (this is because V attains its maximal value for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4). In the general case with X = X (r), the aforementioned geometrical picture does not strictly hold (meaning that while the spin vector still precesses, its wobbling will lie on a more general surface). It is noteworthy that the above interpretation is based on the idea that the spinor is a quantum field, which can be seen as some sort of fluid, the streamlines of which are the electron trajectories in the given electromagnetic field. Hence it is in this context that the idea of motion is applied, given that everything is time independent.\nWith the tetrads one can make the transition from the tangent space to the manifold with s\u03bc = sae\u03bca and v\u03bc = vae\u03bca , giving the following nonzero components:\nsr = cos \u03b8 \u221a\nX 2 + 1\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , s\u03b8 = \u2212 sin \u03b8X r \u221a | cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (144)\nvt = \u221a\nX 2 + 1\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , v\u03c6 = 1 r \u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 . (145)\nThe Ri j\u03bc tensor is calculated as the solution to the equation\n2R\u2202\u03bcR\u22121 \u2212 i j\u03bc\u03c3 i j = Ri j\u03bc\u03c3 i j (146) with R = BU above.\nLet us illustrate here a very powerful property of the proposed method, which is the possibility of easily writing the solution to the Dirac equation in any frame of reference. First, one should remember that the solutions to the Dirac equation are written in a frame of reference at rest located at the origin of any chosen coordinate system. For instance, in the case of the hydrogen atom, this is the frame of the proton (to be precise, it should be the rest frame of the center of mass of the proton-electron system, but because the proton is much more massive than the electron, the center of mass and the proton are approximately the same). The electron is seen by the observer as undergoing a motion composed of translations and rotations that can easily be inferred from the matrix spinor (103). Here, we show how to change from the aforementioned frame of reference to the rest frame of the electron. The rest frame of the electron is the one for which the spinor takes a form such that the spatial part of the velocity operator is zero. The attentive reader might complain that the change of these two systems might be meaningless because in this transfer we move from one inertial frame to a noninertial frame. Such a reader would in principle be right, as in fact there would have to be difficulties in treating noninertial frames with the standard methods. However, our method here instead is fully covariant, and as such it is naturally equipped to treat noninertial as well as inertial frames with equal ease, the information about the acceleration of the frame being contained in the spin connection.\nIn order to change reference frames we first have to calculate the new tetrads. The tetrads are calculated with the following simple formulas:\neta = 14 Tr (R\u22121\u03b3 0R\u03b3a), e\u03b8a = 14 Tr (R\u22121\u03b3 \u03b8R\u03b3a), (147)\ne\u03c6a = 14 Tr (R\u22121\u03b3 \u03c6R\u03b3a), era = 14 Tr (R\u22121\u03b3 rR\u03b3a), (148)\n023140-10\nwhose components are\net0 = \u221a\nX 2 + 1\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , et2 = sin \u03b8\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ,\ner1 = sin \u03b8X\u221a\n|cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , er3 = cos \u03b8\n\u221a X 2 + 1\u221a\n|cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ,\ne\u03b81 = cos \u03b8\nr\n\u221a X 2 + 1\u221a\n|cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , e\u03b83 = \u2212\nsin \u03b8X r \u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ,\ne\u03c60 = 1 r \u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , e\u03c62 = 1 r sin \u03b8\n\u221a X 2 + 1\u221a\n|cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 ,\nas can be straightforwardly seen. The electron rest frame is the one for which the spinortetrad system gives the velocity va = (1, 0, 0, 0) (this can always be done so long as the spinor is nonsingular, that is, if the matrix spinor has a determinant not equal to zero identically in general). In this frame we are also going to pick the spin aligned along the third axis (which can always be done). In this case then, the matrix spinor is simply\nRF = \u221a\u03c1ei \u03b2 2 1e\u2212\u03b32\u03b31( t/h\u0304\u2212\u03c6/2), (149)\nwhich is just the matrix spinor (103) in which the replacement R \u2192 1 is made. Moreover, the components of the spin connection describing the acceleration of the frame are\n02r = \u2212 sin \u03b8XX \u2032\n\u221a X 2 + 1(| cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2) , (150)\n13r = sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8X \u2032\n\u221a X 2 + 1(| cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2) , (151)\n02\u03b8 = cos \u03b8 \u221a\nX 2 + 1 |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (152)\n13\u03b8 = X \u221a\nX 2 + 1 |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 \u2212 1, (153)\n01\u03c6 = \u2212 sin \u03b8 (|sin \u03b8 |2X + |cos \u03b8 |2\u221aX 2 + 1) |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (154)\n03\u03c6 = |sin \u03b8 |2 cos \u03b8(X \u2212 \u221aX 2 + 1)\n| cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (155)\n12\u03c6 = |sin \u03b8 | 2X \u221a X 2 + 1 + |cos \u03b8 |2(X 2 + 1) |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 , (156)\n23\u03c6 = sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n( X (\u221a X 2 + 1 \u2212 X ) \u2212 1) |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 . (157)\nTherefore the Dirac spinor in the rest frame\n\u03c8RF = RF \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d 1 0 0\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 = \u03bae \u2212 G2 \u2212 it h\u0304 + i\u03c62\u221a 2r \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u221a\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 + X 0\u221a\u221a |cos \u03b8 |2 + X 2 \u2212 X\n0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0,\n(158)\nalong with the tetrads and the spin connection and the vector potential At = \u2212V (r), obeys the Dirac equation\nih\u0304e\u03bca \u03b3 a ( \u2202\u03bc + 12 i j\u03bc\u03c3 i j ) \u03c8RF \u2212 q eta\u03b3 aAt\u03c8RF\n\u2212 mc\u03c8RF = 0 (159)\nas long as conditions (114) and (115) are satisfied. It is noteworthy that with the choice of functions (107), if one fixes \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (i.e., a projection onto the x-y plane), the matrix spinor (103) takes the same form as (106).\nThe solution (158) was first presented in Refs. [21,22]. The most intriguing property of this spinor is that it is not separable, even though the potential has spherical symmetry. In Ref. [21] it was not explicitly shown, but instead speculated that the nonseparability of the Dirac spinor was a consequence of the frame in which the solution was written. In this paper we were able to prove the connection between nonseparability and the reference frame. In fact, if we compare (158) with the spinor (113), which is the solution to the Dirac equation for the same potential albeit in another frame of reference, we note that variable separability is restored. Hence we can conclude that the symmetries of equations are not always inherited by their solutions. In fact, here we just proved that such symmetries, and, in particular, the property of variable separability for the Dirac equation, are frame dependent.\nThe cases just discussed represent physical situations involving the presence of the YT chiral angle and the fact that it is strictly connected to spin-orbit coupling effects. We will investigate the inverse statement, that is, that the absence of spin-orbit coupling should only be possible when the YT chiral angle is zero."

            "text": "A zero YT angle implies, from (35), that r\u03bcs\u03bc = 0. With this constraint in mind, let us choose the matrix spinor in the form\n= \u221a\u03c1BUe\u2212\u03b32\u03b31 th\u0304 , (160)\nB = e(\u2212 sin \u03c6\u03b31\u03b30+cos \u03c6\u03b32\u03b30 ) arctanh f2 , (161)\nU = e\u2212\u03b32\u03b31\u03c6/2e\u2212\u03b33\u03b31\u03b8/2e\u2212\u03b33\u03b31\u03c0/4. (162)\nIn comparing the matrix spinor (103) against (160) we note that, apart from \u221a \u03c1 and the fact that \u03b2 is gone, the only change is in the rotation matrix U . As an illustration, let us choose f = \u2212\u221a1 \u2212 a2, with a > 0 and a < 1 being constant. Moreover, let us make the following choice of density:\n\u221a \u03c1 = \u03ba (1 \u2212 a 2)1/4e\u2212G/2\u221a 2a r \u221a sin \u03b8 , (163)\n023140-11\nwhere \u03ba is a normalization constant. Given these choices, from (160) we extract the Dirac spinor\n\u03c8 = \u221a\u03c1e\u2212 i th\u0304 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d (1+a)1/2e\u2212 i\u03c62 (cos \u03b82 \u2212sin \u03b82 ) 2 (1+a)1/2e i\u03c62 (sin \u03b82 +cos \u03b82 ) 2 i(1\u2212a)1/2e\u2212 i\u03c62 (sin \u03b82 +cos \u03b82 ) 2\n\u2212 i(1\u2212a)1/2e i\u03c6 2 (cos \u03b82 \u2212sin \u03b82 )\n2\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(164)\nas is easy to see. The most remarkable thing about this spinor is that, from (26) and (27) (RDI is used here because we are still in Cartesian coordinates) we extract the vector potential\nA0 = \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2h\u0304G\u2032(r) + 2a c \u2212 2cm 2a , (165)\nA1 = sin \u03c6( \u2212 2 \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2cm + h\u0304G\u2032(r)) 2a , (166)\nA2 = \u2212cos \u03c6( \u2212 2 \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2cm + h\u0304G\u2032(r)) 2a , (167)\nA3 = 0, (168) where r = \u221a x2 + y2 + z2, thus implying that in order to remove the spin precession, it was necessary to add a magnetic field. Moreover, with the matrix spinor (160) we calculate the normalized components of the velocity (17) and spin (18), which are given by\ns0 = 0, s1 = \u2212 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, (169)\ns2 = \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, s3 = sin \u03b8, (170)\nv0 = 1 a , v1 = \u2212\n\u221a 1 \u2212 a2\na sin \u03c6, (171)\nv2 = \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2 a\ncos \u03c6, v3 = 0. (172) Note that the matrix spinor (160), the Dirac spinor (164), and the vector potential above satisfy the Dirac equation in Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the spin vector no longer precesses, instead always pointing in the \u2212\u03b8\u0302 direction. Hence, by making the YT angle equal to zero, the spin-orbit coupling causing the precession of the spin vector also vanishes.\nWe next change to spherical coordinates. The form of the spinor (164) remains the same, while both \u03b3a and Aa are transformed via the tetrads as usual. Given that all the components of the spin connection i j\u03bc with the above tetrads and connection coefficients are zero, the calculation of the components of the Ri j\u03bc tensors is straightforward, and the nonzero components are\nR13\u03b8 = cos \u03c6, R23\u03b8 = sin \u03c6, (173)\nR12\u03c6 = \u22121. (174) We can transform the above tensors to the spacetime manifold as\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = ei\u03bce j\u03bdRi j\u03c1,\nwhose components are\nRr\u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212r, (175)\nRr\u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212r| sin \u03b8 |2, R\u03b8\u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212r2 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8, (176) as can be easily checked. Finally, the components of the velocity and spin vectors in spherical coordinates are\ns\u03b8 = \u2212r, (177)\nvt = 1 a , v\u03c6 =\n\u221a 1 \u2212 a2\na r sin \u03b8, (178)\nwith vector potential\nAt = h\u0304 \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2G\u2032(r) 2a \u2212 cm a + c , (179)\nA\u03c6 = r sin \u03b8 ( \u2212 2 \u221a\n1 \u2212 a2cm + h\u0304G\u2032(r)) 2a , (180)\nand as is easy to see, the density (163) is a solution to the Dirac equation in polar form.\nLet us next check some particular solutions. We first consider the limit a \u2192 1. In doing so, (164) and (178)\u2013(180) become\n\u03c8 = \u221a\u03c1e\u2212 imc 2t h\u0304 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d e\u2212 i\u03c6 2 (cos \u03b82 \u2212sin \u03b82 )\u221a 2 e i\u03c6 2 (sin \u03b82 +cos \u03b82 )\u221a 2\n0 0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(181)\nand\nvt = 1, v\u03c6 = 0, (182)\nAt = 0, A\u03c6 = r sin \u03b8 h\u0304G \u2032(r)\n2 , (183)\nwhere we also assumed = mc2 for simplicity. In the same limit the density (163) would go to zero, but the density is defined only up to a normalization constant. In our case, to avoid the degeneracy of this limit, we will choose the density\n\u221a \u03c1 = \u03bae\n\u2212G/2\nr \u221a 2 sin \u03b8 , (184)\nthus preserving the fact that we still have a solution of the Dirac equations. This special solution for the magneticsolenoid field is quite interesting. For a discussion of solutions to the Dirac equation in similar fields, see Ref. [23] and references therein.\nAs another particular solution, let us consider again (164) but now take the function G to be\nG = \u2212 2a\u03b1\u221a 1 \u2212 a2 ln (cmr h\u0304 ) + 2 \u221a 1 \u2212 a2cmr h\u0304 + ai\u03bc0r 2Rh\u0304 .\n(185)\nThis particular form of the function G leads to the following components of the vector potential:\nAt = \u2212\u03b1h\u0304 r , A\u03c6 = 1 4 sin \u03b8\n( i\u03bc0r\nR \u2212 4\u03b1h\u0304\u221a 1 \u2212 a2 ) . (186)\n023140-12\nThus such a choice leads to the analytical solution for the ground state of the hydrogen atom along with a magnetic field having components\nBr = i\u03bc0 cos \u03b8 2R \u2212 2\u03b1h\u0304 cos \u03b8\u221a 1 \u2212 a2r ,\nB\u03b8 = \u03b1h\u0304 sin \u03b8\u221a 1 \u2212 a2r \u2212 i\u03bc0 sin \u03b8 2R (187)\ncorresponding to a superposition of a magnetic-solenoid field such as the one at the center of a circular loop of radius R carrying a current i and a magnetic field generated by the current density J having only the following component in the azimuthal direction:\nJ\u03c6 = \u2212 2\u03b1h\u0304 sin \u03b8\u221a 1 \u2212 a2r2 . (188)\nIncidentally, by making the substitution\nG = i\u03bc0 2Rh\u0304 r\ninto the Dirac spinor (181) and the vector potential (183) we arrive at the analytical solution for the case with only the constant and homogeneous magnetic field, i.e., the field one gets by putting \u03b1 = 0 in (187). It is noteworthy that this solution corresponds to the three-dimensional generalization of the inhomogeneous magnetic field solution given in Ref. [3] as can be easily seen if one writes the correspondingly magnetic field in Cartesian coordinates and chooses \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 (i.e., z = 0)."

            "text": "In a comparison between the matrix spinors (109) and (160), the most noteworthy features of these solutions to the Dirac equation are the effects the removal of the YT angle has on the physics of the problem. The first notable effect is the change from a purely spherically symmetric electric field in (109) to a combination of a spherically symmetric electric field with magnetic fields in (160). The second, even more remarkable, effect is that the removal of the YT angle leads to the absence of spin-orbit coupling. That the latter is the case can be clearly inferred from the structure of the matrix spinor as discussed below.\nRegarding the first effect, one can note the following. For all localized solutions found using RDI, a matrix spinor with zero YT angle always led to a solution of the Dirac equation for an electron interacting with a magnetic field. It is well known that for the case of a magnetostatic field there exists a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in closed form that exactly diagonalizes the Dirac Hamiltonian [24], thus allowing a full separation into states of positive and negative energy (or charge). This is consistent with the interpretation that a nonzero YT angle corresponds to a mixture of positive and negative energy states, even more so in the hydrogenlike atom case in which the YT angle depends on \u03b8 . The form of the matrix spinor (109) and the observation that for stationary electric fields no closed-form Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation exists (yet) which exactly diagonalizes the Dirac Hamiltonian led us to speculate that, in such cases, a nonzero YT angle in the matrix spinor is necessary. However,\nthe matrix spinor (160) proves that one can still have an inhomogeneous static electric field for a matrix spinor having zero YT angle with the expense of also adding a magnetic field. These findings suggest a deep connection between positive and negative energy states\u2019 separability, magnetic fields, and the YT angle.\nFinally, in the case of the second effect, it seems to be connected with the geometric features of the matrix spinors (109) and (160). It was previously mentioned that the function f is the magnitude of the electron\u2019s velocity. In the case of the matrix spinor (109) for constant X (i.e., the spinor corresponding to the ground state of a hydrogenlike atom) the spatial components of the velocity four-vector v/ live on the circles of latitude of a sphere of radius Z\u03b1 as can be inferred from their dependence on sin \u03b8 . In contrast, for the matrix spinor (160) the electron\u2019s velocity is everywhere constant and has its direction opposite to the hydrogenlike atom case. Moreover, from the definition of the spin vector (18) we see that the considerable change in the rotation matrix U from (109) to (160) will greatly influence the form of s/. This implies that one effect of the YT angle is to tilt the spin vector as can be seen by the appearance of the term tan(\u03b2/2) in the rotation matrix (105), making it dependent on the boost matrix in the hydrogenlike case, in contrast to the electric-plus-magneticfield case, where the rotation matrix (162) is such that U\u03b33U \u2020 end up commuting with B in (18); such a feature can easily be inferred from (138), (139), (140), (169), and (170). It is this commutativity between the boost matrix and the rotation matrix that led us to conclude that there is a connection between a nonzero YT angle and the spin-orbit coupling. The fact that the aforementioned features are so straightforwardly identifiable in the matrix spinor, while being hidden in the standard Dirac spinor, highlights the advantages of the CRDI technique in the geometrical interpretation of solutions to the Dirac equation."

            "text": "We have written RDI in explicitly covariant form, thus putting forward the more general CRDI technique, which is the main result of this work. We then showed how it can be used to perform a nontrivial change of reference frames with respect to which a given matrix spinor is given that can potentially be a powerful tool in the quest for novel solutions to the Dirac equation. In addition, a whole family of normalizable analytic solutions to the Dirac equation is presented. More specifically, we find exact solutions for the case of a Dirac electron in the presence of a magnetic field as well as a solution consisting of a combination of a spherically symmetric electric field with magnetic fields. Giving the connection of the YT angle \u03b2 with quantum states having particle and antiparticle admixtures as well as with the dynamics of the spinor\u2019s internal degrees of freedom (also known as spin), its role in the solutions to the Dirac equation is yet to be fully elucidated. Hence an important feature of the solutions presented here is that they offer some hints of a possibly deep connection between \u03b2, magnetic fields, and spin-orbit coupling for normalizable Dirac spinors. In fact, we propose the following conjecture: The only localized (normalizable) solutions to the Dirac equation having no spin-orbit coupling\n023140-13\nare those having zero YT angle. Therefore proving (or disproving) this conjecture would be an important contribution in better understanding the geometrical role of \u03b2 in the Dirac spinor.\nAnother application of CRDI would be the construction of solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of both electromagnetic and gravitational fields. For instance, such solutions could be used to study the so-called traversable\nwormholes, i.e., stable wormholes that do not require exotic matter [25\u201327]. The recently proposed solution describing a macroscopic (that is, allowing for humans to travel through it) traversable wormhole [28] is noteworthy. Also, solutions to the Dirac equation in the presence of gravitational fields could be used in order to test the prediction that matter interacting with a quantized gravitational field should lead to an entangling interaction between massive objects [29].\n[1] A.
