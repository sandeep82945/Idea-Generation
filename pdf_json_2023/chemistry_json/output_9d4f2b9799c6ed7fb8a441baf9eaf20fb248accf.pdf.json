    "abstractText": "Geosmin and 2\u2010methylisoborneol (2\u2010MIB) are amongst the most common earthy and musty taste and odour (T&O) compounds found in drinking water. With low odour threshold detection limits below 10 ng L\u22121, and the complexity of raw water matrices, these two compounds provide a significant challenge for water companies globally. In this research, for the first time, a novel and fully automated micro\u2010solid phase\u2010extraction (\u03bcSPE) method coupled with gas chromatography (GC)\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed for the detection of geosmin and 2\u2010MIB for drinking water analysis. The new automated method described herein is environmentally friendly requiring low raw water sample volumes, of 25 mL, and only 50 \u03bcL of elution solvent. Our \u03bcSPE\u2010GC\u2013MS method exhibits excellent linearity for both compounds (R2 > 0.999) and low limits of detection of 2.0 ng L\u22121 and 4.3 ng L\u22121 for geosmin and 2\u2010MIB, respectively. The method showed excellent recovery rates (95.1\u2013100.1%) and good precision (RSD < 7%) in raw sample matrices. Our approach is fully automated onto a robotic workstation which can be readily integrated into a laboratory workflow for routine water analysis. Furthermore, the method has excellent potential to be incorporated within a portable system for onsite analysis.",

            "text": "Geosmin and 2\u2011methylisoborneol (2\u2011MIB) are amongst the most common earthy and musty taste and odour (T&O) compounds found in drinking water. With low odour threshold detection limits below 10 ng L\u22121, and the complexity of raw water matrices, these two compounds provide a significant challenge for water companies globally. In this research, for the first time, a novel and fully automated micro\u2011solid phase\u2011extraction (\u03bcSPE) method coupled with gas chromatography (GC)\u2013mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed for the detection of geosmin and 2\u2011MIB for drinking water analysis. The new automated method described herein is environmentally friendly requiring low raw water sample volumes, of 25 mL, and only 50 \u03bcL of elution solvent. Our \u03bcSPE\u2011GC\u2013MS method exhibits excellent linearity for both compounds (R2 > 0.999) and low limits of detection of 2.0 ng L\u22121 and 4.3 ng L\u22121 for geosmin and 2\u2011MIB, respectively. The method showed excellent recovery rates (95.1\u2013100.1%) and good precision (RSD < 7%) in raw sample matrices. Our approach is fully automated onto a robotic workstation which can be readily integrated into a laboratory workflow for routine water analysis. Furthermore, the method has excellent potential to be incorporated within a portable system for onsite analysis.\nTaste and odour (T&O) compounds provide a major challenge for water companies globally. Earthy and musty T&O compounds, primarily geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), are perceived by customers as an indication of poor drinking water quality. The presence of geosmin and 2-MIB, at low nanogram per litre concentrations, often leads to consumer complaints. Therefore, it is necessary that these unpleasant compounds be regularly monitored, and treated where needed, before reaching the consumer. However, the extremely low detection threshold limits for geosmin and 2-MIB, typically below 10ng L\u22121, coupled with the complex raw sample matrices, provides a significant challenge for the water industry1\u20135. Additionally, there is a growing desire for the global water industry to move towards \u2018greener\u2019 and more efficient methods that are automated, low-cost with minimal environmental impact.\nAt present, several different methods exist for the detection of T&O compounds in drinking water. Most methods reported in the literature usually require some form of pre-conditioning step followed by gas chromatography\u2014mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS)6,7. There are several pre-conditioning steps available, including: closed-loop stripping analysis (CLSA)8\u201310, solid phase microextraction (SPME)11\u201313, stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE)14,15,\nOPEN\n1Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. 2Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. 3Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. 4United Utilities, Lingley Mere Business Park, Warrington, UK. *email: s.maher@ liverpool.ac.uk\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1768 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28543-x\npurge and trap (P&T)16,17, liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE)18,19 and liquid\u2013liquid microextraction (LLME)20,21. However, most of these methods are highly labour intensive, complex, time consuming, expensive, difficult to automate and/or require high solvent volumes6,7. One of the most widely used pre-conditioning methods for T & O analysis is solid-phase extraction (SPE)22,23.\nSPE has successfully been used to extract and pre-concentrate T&O compounds from drinking water, as a pre-conditioning step prior to GC\u2013MS analysis/quantification. Table\u00a01 gives a summary of the methods, and key results, found within the literature for geosmin and 2-MIB detection for drinking water analysis using SPE. Low nanogram per litre detection limits are achievable, ranging from 0.1 to 5.5 ng L\u22121. However, most of the SPE methods described in Table\u00a01 require large sample volumes, of around 100\u20131000\u00a0mL, to achieve the necessary sensitivity. These large sample volumes are usually loaded over open-ended SPE cartridges, resulting in long sample loading times. Additionally, many of the methods require extensive conditioning and washing of cartridges before and after runs. Likewise, many require additional post-extraction stages, such as Wright, et\u00a0al.24 centrifuging their extractant at 1000\u00a0rpm and Ikai, et\u00a0al.25 using a headspace extraction at 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min prior to GC\u2013MS detection. Wright, et\u00a0al.24 and Kim, et\u00a0al.26 also require SPE cartridge drying times at various stages in their methods to remove any residual sample or wash solvent.\nGeosmin (GSM), 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB). As a consequence of running these high sample volumes, often with complex and time-consuming method steps, it invariably results in long extraction times for geosmin and 2-MIB detection. Routine water industry laboratories often require large numbers of samples to be analysed daily. Therefore, using one of the aforementioned SPE methods would be highly time-consuming and very labour intensive for commercial analysis, where rapid turnaround times are highly desirable.\nThe evolution of SPE to miniaturised micro-solid phase extraction (\u00b5SPE) systems, with sorbent masses decreasing from grams (g) to micro-grams (\u00b5g) and elution volumes from milli-litres (mL) to micro-litres (\u00b5L), has developed over the last 50\u00a0 years29. \u03bcSPE techniques have successfully been used for the detection of several different analytes from a variety of liquids, including: blood30, urine31,32 and water33,34. This has significantly reduced the sample and elution volumes required. Furthermore, \u03bcSPE has increased the scientific scope for semiautomated or fully automated methodologies, reducing the need for large scale laboratory setups or full-time technical staffing, as well as eliminating operator errors. Thus, improving the quality of data whilst decreasing overall costs and turnaround times for results. Additionally, the \u03bcSPE cartridges have a significantly reduced particle diameter of around 2\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm, compared to conventional SPE cartridges at around 40\u201360\u00a0\u03bcm, significantly increasing the surface area to volume ratio and thus the overall extraction efficiency.\nSimilar \u03bcSPE devices to those used in this study using a one-way loading valve (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d, section \u201c\u03bcSPE cartridges and robotic workstation\u201d) can be found in the literature, such as the work by Alexandrou, et\u00a0al.33 and Porto-Figueira, et\u00a0al.35. Porto-Figueira, et\u00a0al.35 investigated the extraction of phenolic compounds, particularly catechins and quercetin derivatives, from teas comparing five different sorbent bed materials against five elution solvents. They were able to obtain comparable limits of detection (LODs), 3.5\u201316.9 \u03bcg L\u22121, to that obtained from conventional SPE cartridges, and demonstrated excellent recoveries of 83.0\u2013100% for all phenolic compounds. Sample volumes were kept extremely low at 200 \u03bcL and elution volumes at 50 \u03bcL. Similarly, Alexandrou, et\u00a0al.33 showed excellent performance using \u03bcSPE design for the extraction of trihalomethanes (THMs) from water. THMS are produced as disinfectant by-products from water treatment and are classed as emerging contaminants of concern for the industry. They demonstrated a significant enhancement in the recoveries of THMs from a small 200 \u03bcL water sample in under 2\u00a0min, with only 50 \u03bcL of elution solvent. Conventional SPE extraction methods, to provide a comparable extraction efficiency for THMs in water, typically require upwards of 120\u00a0min to condition 100\u00a0mL of sample and 1\u201310\u00a0mL of elution solvent.\nIn this present investigation, we hypothesised that an analytical method incorporating a one-way \u03bcSPE can significantly advance the analysis of geosmin and 2-MIB for drinking water analysis, to allow a greener and more efficient methodology, with reduced costs and increased throughput. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted using \u03bcSPE for geosmin and 2-MIB extraction/analysis from water. Herein we have developed, optimised, and evaluated a new \u03bcSPE-GC\u2013MS method, including testing with raw water samples."

These stages ensure that the sorbent beds are fully activated and that any bound analytes, from previous samples, are removed. Additionally, the type 1 water wash will remove any remaining elution solvent from the sorbent bed to increase analyte binding. Samples were extracted through successive syringe loading cycles, culminating in a total sample volume of 25\u00a0mL, to ensure sufficient sensitivity for geosmin and 2-MIB detection requirements.

The performance of six different \u03bcSPE cartridges, in combination with four elution solvents, were compared for both geosmin and 2-MIB extraction from Type 1 water. The \u03bcSPE cartridge types were: C4 (3\u00a0\u00b5m/120\u00a0\u00c5), C8 (3\u00a0\u00b5m/120\u00a0\u00c5), C18 (3\u00a0\u00b5m/120\u00a0\u00c5), hydrophilic C18 (3\u00a0\u00b5m/120\u00a0\u00c5), PS/DVB (polystyrene/divinylbenzene) (3\u00a0\u00b5m/300\u00a0\u00c5) and silica (3\u00a0\u00b5m/120\u00a0\u00c5). The four elution solvents used were methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and n-hexane. The comparative performance for these different cartridge and solvent combinations can be seen in Figs.\u00a02 and 3. Samples (n = 3) were produced from spiking methanol stock solutions of geosmin and 2-MIB into Type 1 water samples. For each case final concentrations of 100 \u03bcg L\u22121 and sample volumes of 8\u00a0mL were used to ensure sufficient analyte levels could be seen for all cartridge/solvent combinations for a visible comparison of the extraction performance during optimisation. Elution volumes were set to 200 \u03bcL to ensure complete elution of all analytes and to ensure consistency across all solvent types.\nThe C4, C8, C18, hydrophilic C18 and PS/DVB cartridges are all considered surface modified silica cartridges, with either a carbon-based or porous polymer coating material. These cartridges are essentially functioning as miniature reverse phase (RP) chromatography columns. Adsorption of the analytes onto the sorbent matrix occurs due to Van Der Waal interactions between the carbon-hydrogen bonds of geosmin and 2-MIB and\nOne-way valve Sorbent bed\nSyringe needle\nFigure\u00a01.

Whereas the silica cartridge contains an active hydrophilic surface, coated with acidic silanol functional groups, which provides a more polar stationary phase somewhat similar to that of a normal phase (NP) chromatography column. Therefore, we anticipated the more polar solvents (methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol) to be most compatible with the five surface modified silica cartridges and the non-polar n-hexane to elute better with the silica cartridge, as would be expected with conventional RP and NP chromatography, respectively.\nBoth geosmin and 2-MIB showed a similar extraction performance pattern across each cartridge/solvent combination. Overall, 2-propanol provided the highest elution efficiency for all cartridge types, except for the silica (see Figs.\u00a02 and 3). Both the C18 and hydrophilic C18 cartridges, in combination with 2-propanol elution, provided the best extraction efficiency for geosmin and 2-MIB. However, the hydrophilic cartridge marginally produced a higher extraction efficiency with reduced variation. The hydrophilic C18 \u03bcSPE cartridges contain proprietary trimethylsilyl endcapping groups which shield the C18 bonding chains. These modifications avoid the matting-down effect of the C18 chains, whereby the C18 side chains can collapse when using larger aqueous volumes in the mobile phase. Therefore, the hydrophilic C18 cartridges produced a more stable extraction efficiency for both compounds over the conventional C18 cartridges. As a result, for all future method development, the hydrophilic C18 cartridge, with 2-propanol elution solvent, was used.\nSample loading runs. Table\u00a03 shows repeated sample loading for spiked Type 1 water samples (n = 3). Samples, of 8\u00a0mL, were loaded through the hydrophilic C18 cartridge over three consecutive cycles to measure the recoveries of both geosmin and 2-MIB over repeated runs. After running a water sample through the cartridge once, 95.4% and 96.2% of the geosmin and 2-MIB, respectively, was extracted. This shows how highly efficient the cartridges are at binding geosmin and 2-MIB to the hydrophilic C18 surface area. Running a sample through a second and third time recovered only 4.1% and 0.5% of geosmin and 3.6% and 0.2% of 2-MIIB from the water sample, respectively. Therefore, for all future experiments the samples were only loaded once through the cartridges and discarded afterwards.\nElution profile. Table\u00a04 shows the elution profile for geosmin, 2-MIB and the internal standard (cis-decahydro-1-napthol), using the hydrophilic C18 cartridge and 2-propanol solvent, from spiked type 1 water samples (n = 3). The elution profile was measured across the first 200 \u03bcL, at 50 \u03bcL intervals, to identify where the three aforementioned compounds were eluting. By identifying the elution profile for each compound, we could discern the most concentrated part of the eluant to provide the maximum enrichment factor possible. For all compounds the first 50 \u03bcL of solvent eluted contained 97.9% and 99.2% of geosmin and 2-MIB, respectively, that was bound to the hydrophilic C18 cartridge. Similarly, the internal standard, cis-decahydro-1-napthol, produced a\n0.E+00\n2.E+05\n4.E+05\n6.E+05\n8.E+05\n1.E+06\n1.E+06\n1.E+06\n2.E+06\n2.E+06\nC4 C8 C18 H-C18 PS-DVB Silica\naerA kaePcihpargota morhC\nCartridge Type\nMethanol\nEthanol\n2-propanol\nn-hexane\nFigure\u00a02.

            "text": "Calibration curves. The hydrophilic C18 \u03bcSPE cartridge was used for all performance analysis with 50 \u03bcL of 2-propanol elution solvent as optimised in the previous sections. Water samples (n = 3) were spiked with geosmin and 2-MIB to produce final concentrations at 0, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 ng L\u22121 for calibration curves (shown in Figs.\u00a0S3 and S4 in the supporting information). Sample volumes were increased from the 8\u00a0mL used in the previous work to 25\u00a0mL to achieve sufficient signal levels for both analytes, with odour threshold limits requiring sub 10 ng L\u22121 sensitivity. The 25\u00a0mL spiked water samples were finally eluted from the \u03bcSPE into 2-propanol following the aforementioned method. Both compounds showed excellent linearity with geosmin at 0.9998 and 2-MIB at 0.9994. Limits of detections (LODs) were calculated using regression analysis based on a 95% confidence interval. LODs were calculated using the formula LOD = 3.3\u00d7 \u03c3\ns where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of\nthe response and s is the slope. The LODs were 2.0 ng L\u22121 and 4.3 ng L\u22121 for geosmin and 2-MIB, respectively. These LODs are comparable to that achieved with traditional SPE pre-conditioning methods seen in Table\u00a01 for geosmin and 2-MIB extraction. Additionally, both analytes are below the 10 ng L\u22121 odour threshold detection levels found within the literature and required for this analysis.\nCartridge life longevity. The \u03bcSPE cartridges used are designed for repeated usage. In a previous study by Alexandrou, et\u00a0al.33 C18 \u03bcSPE cartridges were successfully used for 12 successive wastewater samples for THM analysis and showed no change in recovery rates. However, they did note that there was a visible black line that appeared across the top of the sorbent bed. Similarly, Porto-Figueira, et\u00a0al.35 used the PS/DVB \u03bcSPE cartridges for more than 40 consecutive extractions of phenolic compounds from teas without losing any performance. However, both Alexandrou, et\u00a0al.33 and Porto-Figueira, et\u00a0al.35 used significantly lower sample volumes (100 \u03bcL and 200 \u03bcL, respectively) than the 25\u00a0mL as required in this study. The performance and longevity of the cartridges were tested by examining repeated sample runs. Water samples were spiked with geosmin and 2-MIB and the extraction efficiency was monitored for 20 repeated 25\u00a0mL sample loadings; for both compounds no recovery losses were observed.\nRecoveries and relative standard deviation from raw samples. Raw samples (n = 3) were collected from United Utilities, the water and wastewater providers for the North West of England, for analysis. Specifically, samples were collected from the River Dee at Huntington and Pen-Y-gwely reservoir at Oswestry. The samples were spiked with geosmin and 2-MIB at 10, 50, 100 and 200 ng L\u22121. The extraction procedure described previously was used, with a hydrophilic C18 cartridge, using a 25\u00a0mL sample and 50 \u03bcL of 2-propanol elution solvent. The recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD) can be seen in Table\u00a05 below. Relative recoveries were calculated using peak area measured/peak area expected \u00d7 100. RSDs were calculated using the formula: RSD = 100\u00d7 \u03c3\nx where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of the response and x\u0304 is the sample mean.\nTable\u00a05 shows excellent recoveries for both analytes from Oswestry reservoir and Huntington River samples. Geosmin recoveries ranged from 96.9 to 100.0% and 2-MIB from 95.1 to 98.2% across all samples and concentrations. RSDs ranged from 1.8 to 4.4% for geosmin and 1.2% to 7% for 2-MIB. These recoveries and RSDs are comparable, and in some instances better, than reports using conventional SPE (Table\u00a01)\u2014yet only a fraction of sample and elution solvents are required, and the process is simple and automated.\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1768 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28543-x"

            "text": "This paper describes a simple, fully automated pre-conditioning step for geosmin and 2-MIB extraction for drinking water analysis using \u03bcSPE-GC\u2013MS. The method uses significantly less sample and elution volumes than conventional SPE methods found within the literature, making it more environmentally friendly. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the time-consuming and labour-intensive pre-conditioning steps usually found within the literature and provides a viable method for routine commercial analysis for these two taste and odour compounds. An additional benefit of \u03bcSPE is that it is amiable for on-site sampling36, enabling rapid screening. If for example a particular water intake was deemed at risk of having high T & O levels, then a suitable portable system would be ideal to make a fast and informed decision regarding resource management. Another scenario of interest is to perform \u03bcSPE extraction in-transit. For any water company a single water sampler will often collect dozens of samples per day and deliver them to the lab for subsequent analysis. With a simple and automated pre-conditioning step as described herein, it is possible to complete this process prior to arriving at the lab whilst in-transit\u2014thus allowing the extracted samples (bound within their respective \u03bcSPE cartridges) to be simply loaded on to an autosampler for detection (e.g., GC\u2013MS) upon arrival. Such an approach would allow rapid turnaround of results on the same day routinely. This is the subject of future work. The \u03bcSPE method demonstrated in this work has potential to be used in any field where classic SPE is required for sample analysis, providing a wide scope for their use in water and, more generally, environmental analysis."
