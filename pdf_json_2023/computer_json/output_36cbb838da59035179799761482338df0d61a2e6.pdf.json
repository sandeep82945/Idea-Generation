    "abstractText": "This paper introduces a double-stator synchronous reluctance motor (DS-SynRM) as a solution for reducing the torque ripple of single-stator synchronous reluctance motors (SS-SynRMs). To speed up the design and performance parameter prediction of the DS-SynRM, a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed. To ensure accurate performance prediction of the motor designs using the MEC, a saturation factor is considered in the proposed MEC based on finite element analysis (FEA) results. The accuracy of the developed MEC is validated using 2-D FEA results. A design algorithm based on the proposed MEC in the dq reference frame is introduced. The study investigates four different DS-SynRM designs with similar volume based on the proposed design algorithm. The performance parameters of the proposed designs are compared with a conventional SS-SynRM and two previously introduced single-stator SynRMs constructed by expensive materials (i.e., dual phase materials). The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the DS-SynRM in production of a similar torque compared to the SS-SynRM. It is shown that the proper adjustment of the second stator location produces a lower torque ripple using the DSSynRM topology.

To speed up the design and performance parameter prediction of the DS-SynRM, a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed. To ensure accurate performance prediction of the motor designs using the MEC, a saturation factor is considered in the proposed MEC based on finite element analysis (FEA) results. The accuracy of the developed MEC is validated using 2-D FEA results. A design algorithm based on the proposed MEC in the dq reference frame is introduced. The study investigates four different DS-SynRM designs with similar volume based on the proposed design algorithm. The performance parameters of the proposed designs are compared with a conventional SS-SynRM and two previously introduced single-stator SynRMs constructed by expensive materials (i.e., dual phase materials). The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the DS-SynRM in production of a similar torque compared to the SS-SynRM. It is shown that the proper adjustment of the second stator location produces a lower torque ripple using the DSSynRM topology.\nINDEX TERMS double-stator SynRM, high-power density, high-torque density, magnetic equivalent circuit, synchronous-reluctance motor\nI. INTRODUCTION Permanent magnet (PM) motors are currently one of the most common type of motors for high-torque applications such as electric vehicles and conveyors [1, 2]. However, they suffer from two main drawbacks: high price and possibility of demagnetization [3]. Synchronous-reluctance motors (SynRMs) are proposed as an alternative for PM machines in industrial applications [4, 5]. Although SynRMs are low-cost and robust, they generally suffer from a relatively low power density (0.1-0.2 kW/kg), high torque ripple (30%-70%), and low power factor (0.5- 0.7) [6]. The most promising way of increasing the torque density in SynRMs is the placement of PMs into the rotor flux-barriers, which results in a PM-assisted SynRM [7]. The use of PM in SynRMs compensates the low power factor of SynRMs but for rare-earth magnets this significantly increases the cost. The low power factor of\nSynRMs increases the power rating of the required inverter [8]. Compared to the NdFeB magnets that are usually used in permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSM), ferrite PMs have a lower cost which results in a cheaper synchronous machine [9]. However, these PMs are prone to demagnetization under the strong magnetic fields associated with short-circuit or overload conditions which may occur in real-life operation [10]. Reddy et al. introduced the idea of using dual-phase (DP) materials in the structure of SynRMs [11]. DP materials allow the magnetic permeability of the lamination material to be changed from acting as a ferromagnetic material to a diamagnetic material at different locations in a single lamination. This feature allows the rotor ribs to benefit from diamagnetic characteristics which leads to a better performance in the constant-torque region (about 7% higher torque in this region) as well as a significant performance\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Disadvantages of this material are the high cost and the necessity of a special manufacturing process. In [12], the authors proposed a SynRM using high-quality cold-rolled grain-oriented electrical steel to reduce the magnetic permeability of the rotor ribs while the torque ripple of the machine is reduced by a special rotor slot pitch angle design. Although reducing the rib flux leads to higher torque density, it offers only limited torque improvements. The ribs tend to saturate and therefore their adverse effect on the performance of the machine is marginal. Although using a two-stator structure is a well-studied concept for PM motors [13], switched reluctance motors (SRMs) [14], and axial-flux motors [15], it has not been reported for SynRMs. In the double-stator structure, the torque-producing surface of the machine (i.e., the airgap) is increased to enhance the torque density. Such a structure may result in a larger torque ripple in comparison to a single-stator SRM [16]. However, a recent comparative study [17] shows that the torque ripple of a double-stator PM-assisted SynRM machine can be lower than the singlestator design. Although some types of double-stator machines have been studied previously in [13-17], the detailed construction information and design formulas were not reported. This paper introduces a double-stator design for the SynRM which has not been previously studied in the literature. Figure 1 shows the 2-D view of the cross section of the proposed double-stator motor. In the proposed double-stator structure, the inner stator is surrounded by the rotor. The proposed double-stator synchronous reluctance motor (DSSynRM) has a comparable power density (about 2.5kW/liter) with published single-stator SynRM motors ([11] and [12]) while using lower cost materials. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is accurate but is not a computationally-efficient technique for the optimal design of electric machines. A magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model with an acceptable accuracy can be a suitable substitute for FEA when an optimization study is needed [18]. Despite previous work on a magnetic equivalent circuit-based (MEC-based) design procedure for the singlestator SynRM (SS-SynRM) [19], there is no published work for the double-stator SynRM using MEC. This paper develops a MEC-based design for the DS-SynRM using the design strategy for SS-SynRM in [19]. The accuracy of the proposed MEC-based model is improved by the consideration of a saturation factor for the proposed model. The proposed DS-SynRM structure uses the available space between the shaft and airgap of the SS-SynRM to accommodate the second stator. Therefore, the material cost of the DS-SynRM and SS-SynRM is similar. The DSSynRM manufacturing cost is higher than the SS-SynRMs however the double stator topology allows reducing the\ntorque ripple in SynRMs via appropriate alignment of the stators. The proposed design method is largely based on the estimation of d- and q-axes inductances of the machine using the MEC. This method not only considers the effect of the number of barriers and their shape, but also investigates different parameters such as flux leakage and iron saturation. In this study, finite-element analysis (FEA) is utilized to improve the accuracy of the MEC simulations. A comprehensive study is conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the DS-SynRM against the SSSynRMs. Various designs of the DS-SynRMs are studied to show the accuracy of the proposed approach in the estimation of the machine performance parameters. The proposed design offers a comparable torque density and power factor with the SS-SynRMs. Considering the low torque ripple of DS-SynRMs, they are promising for application in transport electrification."

The proposed MEC model uses the MEC equations of the SS-SynRM available in [19]. MEC methods allow more rapid analysis of the electric machines than finite element analysis (FEA) and are generally better suited to optimization studies. Figure 2 shows 2-D and exploded views of a conventional SS-SynRM and the proposed DS-SynRM. The design parameters of Figure 2(a) determine the MEC model and are used to estimate the reluctance and MEC parameters of the proposed DS-SynRM of Figure 2(c). Figures 2(b) and (d) illustrate the exploded views of a single- and doublestator SynRM structures, respectively. Figure 3 shows the developed MEC of the double-stator SynRM. The highlighted sections illustrate the MEC of a conventional SS-SynRM. The second stator MEC is added to the d-q axes MEC of the SS-SynRM. The second stator increases the stator\u2019s specific electric loading, which leads to higher electromagnetic torque in comparison to a single-stator SynRM with the same volume [20].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The MEC is faster than the FEA which leads to an increase of the design speed. Therefore, the d-q axis reluctances are required to complete the magnetic equivalent circuit of the double-stator SynRM. In the proposed MEC, a number of reluctances are considered to increase the model accuracy. As shown in Figure 2, the barrier reluctances are along the q-axis and the available airgap between the rotor near the inner and outer stators are the only reluctances of the machine along with d-axis. \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5care the airgap reluctances in front of each segment while \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c are the barrier reluctances in the proposed double-stator MEC.

Using a constant stack length enables per unitizing the permeances by this value. Thus, per-unit permeances are defined where the barrier lengths are used in the denominator instead of the surface area. The numbered indices in the MEC in Figure 3, indicate the segments and barriers from the largest to the smallest where i and o indices indicate the inner and outer stators. Using the MEC help simplify the model analysis and allows finding the d-q axes mmfs using the staircase function [19]. The staircase function uses the machine geometry to find the average mmf of each segment when the current is along the q-axis (\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58). If the rated magnetic flux density of Bfe is imposed on the motor iron, the magnetic loading factor is calculated as below: \ud835\udc4f = \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc51/\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc52 (3) where Bd is the peak of the fundamental of the airgap flux density. Note that 1.5T is assumed for Bfe in this paper because this is the start of the saturation region for most of commercial lamination materials. The ratio of the magnetic flux densities defined by (3) is the per-unit value for flux density which is required for calculation of the d-axis current and flux linkage. It is reasonable to assume a sinusoidal flux density in the airgap for a well-designed machine."

The windings of the inner and outer stators are connected in series with each other. Thus, the obtained inductances from the MEC for each stator are summed. To find the main dimensions of the double-stator SynRM design, the following assumptions are made:\n\u2022 The number of inner and outer stator slots are equal. \u2022 The average magnetic flux densities of the inner and outer airgaps are equal.

One of the important factors in the design of the SynRM is the ratio of the rotor\u2019s air and iron (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56). The role of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 is the determination of the amount of rotor\u2019s air as written in (8).\n2\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60\u210e + 2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 + 2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5c + \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56(1 + \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56) + \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5c(1 + \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56)\n+ 2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56 + 2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c = 2\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60 (8)\nTable I lists the design equations of the proposed DSSynRM. As shown in Figure 3, these equations are similar to the SS-SynRM from the MEC point of view. So, it is only required to use the inner stator relevant dimensions to find the inductances from the MEC. To simplify the rotor design, it is assumed that the reluctance of the barriers is constant. This leads to choosing the thickness of each barrier proportional to its width while an equal thickness of iron segments is considered. In the SS-SynRM design, the ratio of rotor and stator radii (xSS), which is called the rotor/stator split ratio, is used as a variable to achieve different torques and power factors.\nTo compare the performance of the double-stator machine with the single-stator SynRM, equation (10) is used to calculate its rotor/stator split ratio. Note that the variation of the rotor air to iron ratio (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56) results in different values of ri, ro, lto, and lyo and hence xDS.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

In these equations, P is the number of pole pairs. The stator tooth thickness (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61) is calculated using a similar method in which \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 is the ratio between magnetic flux densities of the tooth and yoke, and Nslot represents the number of slots of the machine (11). According to (12), the stack length (lstk), pole pitch (\u03c4p), flux density in the airgaps (Bag), and winding factor (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc64) are other important parameters to obtain the stator inner and outer number of turns (Nsi and Nso); where the arithmetic average of the flux density coefficient for a sinusoidal flux density (\u03b1i) is calculated by (12) [21]. The inner and outer windings are connected in series and the number of turns in the inner stator is chosen to give a similar current density to the outer stator. In summary, the dimensions of the machine are obtained as follows: a constant value is chosen for Nslot. In this paper, the Nslot is selected base on a reference design [22]. The stator tooth flux density is assumed to be the same as the stator yoke flux density, and hence the ratio \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61 is set equal to one. The regular staircase function introduced in [23] is used to find the average and fundamental harmonic magnitude of the airgap flux density. The values are used to find the \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5c, and \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c using (3), (9), and (11), respectively. This information enables calculation of the inner stator dimensions based on (4) to (8). Equations (25) to (35) from [24] are then utilized to find the dimensions of the rotor ribs. To predict the performance of SynRMs, it is necessary to calculate the motor d- and q-axis inductances. These inductances are found by (13). The portion of the inductances which closes its path through the rotor is shown using the m index; \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5e is a portion of the q-axis inductance which represents the flux circulating across each segment; \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5e is the portion representing the flux passing between the segments through barriers. The required \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5e and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5e are found using (14) and (15). Amp\u00e8re's circuital law is used to calculate the magnetizing inductance by (14). To calculate the \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51, it is assumed that the airgap flux density is sinusoidal. Thus, the Carter factor (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc50) [25] is used to find \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 . Since the d-axis magnetizing inductance is prone to significant saturation, a saturation factor of \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 is introduced and calculated using FEA to increase the accuracy of the modeling. This factor is less than or equal to one and is the ratio of the d-axis inductance computed using FEA during operation at rated current over the calculated value by (16) when \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc60 = 1. If the saturation effect is ignored, an error of up to 50% may be observed in the analytical calculation of the inductance and torque. The saturation factor determination affects the accuracy of the prediction of the torque and power factor. Figure 4 shows the significance of the saturation factor in prediction of the d- and q- axes flux linkages. As shown in (14) and\n(15), both the d- and q-axis inductances are functions of saturation factor (as they are both functions of \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51 (14) [19]). The saturation factor helps to determine the q-axis flux required for performance prediction of the machine. The d-axis inductance does not change with the variation of the size of barriers. Thus, a set of 2-D FEA analyses with ten different d-axis flux paths is executed and for each daxis flux path, the d-axis inductance is recorded when the maximum flux density in the d-axis path is 2.2 T. The selected steel type (i.e., 35JN300) is fully saturated at this flux density. The calculated d-axis inductance is calculated by (14) for four different magnetic loadings (\ud835\udc4f) in ten different values of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46. The corresponding d-axis inductance for considered pair of \ud835\udc4f and \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc46 is obtained from 2-D FEA and divided by each analytically calculated inductance. The average of the highest saturation levels (minimum obtained ratio) in each magnetic loading is defined as the saturation factor. This process is executed one time for any geometry as long as the rotor radius, airgap length, and stator slot number are constant. The calculated average mmf of each segment using the staircase function (fk) is equal to the q-axis mmfs of each branch in per-unit, which is shown in the MEC (Figure 3(a)). Therefore, the flux passing through each branch can be calculated based on the mmf loop. The calculated flux of each branch is used to obtain the q-axis inductance by (15) [19]. In (15), \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58 is the electrical angle of the middle point of each barrier from the rotor d-axis. Consideration of (15) results in the following formulas for calculation of the daxis inductances of the inner and outer stators:\n(\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5c)\u2044 = (4 \ud835\udf0b\u2044 )(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc54 2\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\u2044 )\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c \u2211 \u2206\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58 2 \ud835\udc58 (17)\n(\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2044 ) = (4 \ud835\udf0b\u2044 )(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc54 2\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\u2044 )\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 \u2211 \u2206\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58 2 \ud835\udc58 (18)\nwhere Pso and Psi are two constant values which depend on the stator slot dimensions as described in [19].

According to the design flowchart presented in Figure 5, the magnetic loading and ratio of the rotor\u2019s air and iron as well as the saturation factor are defined for the given geometry. Determination of these values allows finding the machine barrier sizes and number of turns. The open-source design software Syre is used to estimate the mmfs [23]. The stair-case function introduced in Syre calculates the average mmf of each segment (\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58) for the calculated d-axis current by (13). The mmf estimations enable calculation of the d- and q-axes inductances by (13) and (15). Finally, the q-axis current is found by (18) and used to estimate the torque and power factor using (20) and (21)."

To analyse the accuracy of the proposed MEC, four designs with significantly different performance parameters are selected in the optimization search space and the performance parameters of each design is compared with the 2-D FEA results. Finally, the performance parameters of the optimized DS-SynRM and SS-SynRM are compared with each other. The optimization and sensitivity analysis are conducted for the geometry and specifications tabulated in Table II which is based on the Toyota Prius\u2019 motor geometry, electric loading, and magnetic loading [22]. A single-layer distributed winding is assumed for the design and analysis. It should be noted that the choice of 10A/mm2 current density necessitates a forced water-cooling system for this machine which is not covered in this paper. According to the explained design procedure, the lamination material, slot fill factor, and the permitted loss per outer stack are the other design requirements as shown in Table II. Because the reference Toyota Prius design is an eight-pole machine, this number of poles is selected for analysis and investigation of SynRMs in this paper. It should be noted that the SynRM power factor could be improved by reducing the number of poles because of the increase of the magnetizing inductance."

In a non-saturated SynRM, the d- and q-axis currents are equal (i.e., current angle of 45\u00b0) to obtain the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA). The current angle is increased in presence of the iron saturation. Hence, a constant value of 55\u00b0 is selected as the current angle in the optimization. In the optimal design of the DS-SynRM, the magnetic loading (b) and xDS, limits for the optimization are 0.4 to 0.6 and 0.3 to 0.45, respectively. The considered ranges of the magnetic loading for the SS-SynRM and DS-SynRM are equal. The range of the variation of the xSS for the SSSynRM design is 0.5 to 0.7, which is larger as there is more space on the rotor side.

As presented in Figure 7a, the rotor/stator split and magnetic loading have a significant role in the variation of the torque and power factor of DS-SynRM. On the other hand, the torque variation in the SS-SynRM has less dependency on the rotor/stator split. Also, the power factor of the SS-SynRM is less affected by variations of the magnetic loading compared to the DS-SynRM. To assess the accuracy of the developed MEC results, four designs with significantly different values of torque and power factor were selected from Figure 7a (i.e., A, B, C, and D points). In addition, point E is a SS-SynRM design with a high-power factor and torque, and was selected for validation of the SS-SynRM model introduced in [23].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

            "text": "To accurately study the selected designs and validate the analytically calculated features, these designs are simulated using the 2-D Ansys Electromagnetics software package where about 8,000 elements were considered to simulate one pole. A transient FEA is executed to calculate the designed machine\u2019s performance parameters. The windings are excited using current sources at the operating speed. The flux density distribution of the considered designs is presented in Figure 8. The effects of b and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 variations on the stator cross sections, size of the slots, and shape of the rotor barriers are observed in this figure. All designs have a relatively high magnetic loading, which shows they are working at their maximum performance. Design D has thinner barriers compared to B and design A has less stator winding area compared to design C. To compare the performance of the proposed designs with the conventional single-stator SynRM, Syre software [23] is used to design a SS-SynRM (design E) in the same volume as the DS-SynRMs (see Figure 8). According to these figures the SS-SynRM offers higher torque and efficiency compared to the proposed double stator designs. It is mainly because of the larger slot area which enables injecting larger current with the same current density as the DS-SynRMs. Figure 9 shows the rated current, output power, copper loss and core loss corresponding to each design. The comparison shows the SS-SynRM benefits from a larger rated current which leads to the increase of its rated torque and power. The ohmic loss in Design E is also less than the DS-SynRMs which brings about its higher efficiency. As expected, based on Figure 8, Design D has the highest power and torque among the DS-SynRM designs. Its torque density is 26% higher than the other DS-SynRMs. Due to the smaller airgap volume for the inner stator and smaller slot area of the winding which limits the current, the DS-SynRMs have not offered higher torque compared to the SS-SynRM. The SS-SynRM higher torque density results from its larger rated current (see Figure 9).\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The electromagnetic torque of the inner stator is lower than the outer stator. However, in designs C and D this accounts for about 27% of the total torque. Figure 10 compares the MTPA points for different current levels calculated by MEC and FEA. The 2-D FEA and proposed MEC results are similar near the rated operating points, as expected since the inductances of the rated point are considered in the saturation model. The copper loss is proportional to the square of current. As shown in (21), before saturation, the torque also increases with the square of current, however after saturation this relationship is roughly linear (see Figure 10). Based on this, in Figure 11(a) which shows torque versus copper loss, before saturation the torque is proportional to the square root of copper loss, and at larger currents, linearly proportional to copper loss. Figure 11(b), designs C and D have lower torque ripple in comparison to the other doublestator designs at higher torque values. Design D can generate 30 Nm electromagnetic torque more than design C at a current of 50A at the expense of larger torque ripple. Table IV compares the performance parameters of the proposed DS-SynRM machine with the SS-SynRM and two other SynRMs from the literature. It demonstrates the comparable torque and power density of the developed DSSynRM designs compared to the SynRM designs from the literature, despite one of these having twice the rated speed."

            "heading": "C. Torque ripple reduction",
            "text": "The literature shows the torque ripple of the SynRMs, is normally in the range of 25% to 60% [5], [9], [31]. Therefore, the studied machines in this paper are within a reasonable range of torque ripple. Skewing can be used to reduce this torque ripple at the cost of some reduction in average torque. The double-stator design can also be used to reduce the torque ripple of the machine by slight modification to the position of the inner stator compared to the outer stator. This can reduce the main harmonic of the torque ripple. A phase shift which is obtained by rotation of the inner stator is used to decrease the torque ripple.\nThe torque ripple changes sinusoidally by rotating the second stator under a pole. This effect for the considered case studied is shown in Figure 12a. According to this figure, the torque ripple of the designs C and D can be less than the single stator design with optimum positioning of the second stator. Figure 12b shows the inner, outer, and total wave form torque of the design D and the modified stator version with the minimum torque ripple. This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of the rotation of the second stator to reduce the torque ripple from 35% to 22%. It should be highlighted that the design process used did not include the optimization of the torque ripple due to the limitations of the proposed MEC for accurate prediction of the torque ripple."

            "text": "A double-stator structure of the SS-SynRM was introduced in this paper to investigate its possible advantages. A magnetic equivalent circuit considering the saturation effect was proposed. An accurate estimation of the saturation factor plays an important role in the prediction of the d-axis flux using the proposed analytical design approach. In the considered geometry, ten d-axis flux paths were considered, and their corresponding d-axis inductance were obtained using 2-D FEA analysis. The comparison of the analytically calculated d-axis inductances with the 2-D FEA results showed 0.6 is a proper saturation factor in the given geometry. In the proposed design approach, the performance parameters of the double-stator SynRM was estimated based on the proposed magnetic equivalent circuit. The proposed design approach was validated by finite-element analysis of four different designs. The double-stator machine showed lower torque density and power factor compared to the conventional SS-SynRMs. The torque ripple analysis was executed to see the effect of the use of double-stator topology on the variation of torque ripple. The initial result showed the DS-SynRMs have 10% to 30% larger torque ripple compared to the SS-SynRM. However, a method was introduced to reduce the torque ripple in presence of the second stator. The result of the analysis showed the torque ripple using the rotation of the second stator can lead to the reduction of torque ripple by 15%. This approach showed it is possible to reach lower torque ripple using the double-stator topology compared to the single-stator design. Future work to improve the proposed machine\u2019s power factor includes improving its saliency ratio, e.g., by optimising the shapes of the rotor flux barriers, and by possibly including non-rare earth magnets in the flux barriers. Other possible subjects for future work are: inclusion of torque ripple in the objective function for optimization, the thermal and structural analysis of the double-stator design and prototyping of the machine."
