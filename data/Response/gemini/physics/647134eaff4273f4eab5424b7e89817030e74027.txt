1. **Investigate the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins in living cells.** This could be achieved by using cell-penetrating peptides or other delivery methods to introduce the activated peptide precursors into cells. Once inside the cell, the peptides could then react with the target protein to form a covalent bond. This approach could be used to study protein-protein interactions, to modify the activity of proteins, or to deliver therapeutic agents to specific proteins.


2. **Develop new peptide adapter domains that are compatible with the Bind&Bite method.** This could be done by screening libraries of peptides for those that form stable heterodimers with the original peptide adapters. Alternatively, new peptide adapters could be designed using computational methods. By expanding the range of available peptide adapters, the Bind&Bite method could be used to modify a wider variety of proteins.


3. **Explore the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins in complex mixtures.** This could be achieved by using a combination of affinity chromatography and the Bind&Bite reaction. First, the target protein would be captured from the mixture using an affinity tag. Then, the activated peptide precursors would be added to the mixture, and the reaction would be allowed to proceed. Finally, the modified protein would be eluted from the affinity column. This approach could be used to purify and modify proteins from complex mixtures, such as cell lysates or blood serum.


4. **Investigate the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins on surfaces.** This could be achieved by immobilizing the activated peptide precursors on a surface, such as a glass slide or a microfluidic chip. Then, the target protein would be flowed over the surface, and the reaction would be allowed to proceed. Finally, the modified protein would be washed away, leaving only the covalently modified protein on the surface. This approach could be used to create protein arrays, to study protein-protein interactions, or to develop new biosensors.


5. **Develop new applications for the Bind&Bite method in biotechnology and medicine.** The Bind&Bite method could be used to create new biomaterials, to develop new drugs, or to improve the delivery of therapeutic agents. For example, the Bind&Bite method could be used to create self-assembling protein nanostructures, to modify the surface of cells to make them more resistant to infection, or to deliver drugs to specific cells in the body.
