1. **Investigate the role of the S5 F557 residue in E-4031 and E-4031-17 inhibition of hERG.** The S5 F557 residue has been shown to be a determinant of high-affinity channel block by E-4031 and E-4031-17. Future studies could investigate the role of this residue in more detail, such as by mutating it to different amino acids and examining the effects on drug binding and inhibition.
2. **Examine the use-dependent inhibition of IhERG by E-4031-17.** E-4031-17 appears to dissociate from the hERG channel more readily than E-4031, suggesting that it may exhibit altered use-/rate-dependence of action. Future studies could investigate this possibility by examining the effects of E-4031-17 on IhERG during different pacing protocols.
3. **Compare the effects of E-4031 and E-4031-17 on other ion channels.** E-4031 and E-4031-17 are both potent inhibitors of hERG, but it is not known whether they have similar effects on other ion channels. Future studies could compare the effects of these compounds on a variety of ion channels, such as the Kv11.1 channel, which is also a target for antiarrhythmic drugs.
4. **Investigate the structural basis for the differences between E-4031 and E-4031-17.** The structural basis for the differences between E-4031 and E-4031-17 is not fully understood. Future studies could use molecular docking and other computational methods to investigate the binding of these compounds to the hERG channel and to identify the structural features that are responsible for their different effects.
5. **Develop new hERG inhibitors based on the structure of E-4031-17.** E-4031-17 is a potent inhibitor of hERG, but it has a number of limitations, such as its lack of selectivity and its potential for causing side effects. Future studies could use the structure of E-4031-17 to design new hERG inhibitors that are more selective and have fewer side effects.
