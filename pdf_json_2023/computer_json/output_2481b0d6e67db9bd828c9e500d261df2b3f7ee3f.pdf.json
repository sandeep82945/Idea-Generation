The correlation shows a very good magnitude. Similarities are also found in the work of Maje (2020) in his research whose objective was: To develop and implement an Information System for Academic Management and Monitoring, to automate manual processes and provide complete, organized and reliable information to the ESFM - Warisata.29,30 Where he concludes with the implementation of the Academic Follow-up and Management Information System, he was able to improve the processes of academic procedures of the ESFM - Warisata, regarding the elaboration of academic records and semester grades and grade centralizers per semester and per subject, in addition to having reports and statistics per semester of the graduates, among others.31\u201333 \"In the specific hypothesis 1 it is evident that there is a link between the web information system and the profile of the graduate of the Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Superior Tecnol\u00f3gico Publico Huarmey, during 2020. The correlation shows a very good magnitude. In in the research of Guevara et al. (2019) 34 whose objective was to postulate a data system for the management of graduate control processes that makes it possible to optimize quality. Methodology: A survey of the entity's graduates was implemented, thus showing that the entity communicates with them, however, it is deficient in the sources used since they are not combined, which corresponds to the need to have a system that includes all the data that makes it possible to make educational decisions.35 Results: The proposed system includes two aspects of relevant information, that of the graduates and that of the entity. Conclusion: Studies on graduate retention and labor market insertion are of enormous relevance for universities and Higher Technological Institutes (IES).36 Through them, these IES are able to have data on the adaptation of their graduates in the labor market.37\u201339 Specific hypothesis 2 proves that there is a link between the web data system and the employment situation of the graduate of the Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Superior Tecnol\u00f3gico Publico Huarmey, during 2022. The correlation shows a good magnitude. Similarly in in his research Mendoza (2019) 40 entitled: \"Transactional information system (SITE) to improve the follow-up of the graduate of the faculty of industrial engineering and systems of the Universidad Nacional Hermilio Valdizan de Hu\u00e1nuco\". The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of the transactional information system in the control of graduates. Methodology: an applied and correlational study of quasi-experimental type was carried out, 19 professors of the profession of Industrial Engineering were related to the study, which in different ways are included in the control of the graduate of the profession, the data collection was carried out after the implementation of the data system for 15 days as a pilot"

Results: 73.7% of the sample mentioned that they would use the information system, while 26.3% indicated that they would not use it. On the other hand, 68.4% of those sampled stated that this system makes it possible to know the professional growth of the graduate. In this sense, taking into account the results of the variables examined, it is worth mentioning that 68.4% say that they would use the transactional system because it makes it possible to include outgoing graduates in the labor market. Conclusion: Universities are undergoing different transformations in the way they provide education, due to the fact that globalization has widely influenced every educational design and data entry.41,42 Specific hypothesis 3 shows that there is a linkage in the web information system and the satisfaction of the graduates with the Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Superior Tecnol\u00f3gico P\u00fablico Huarmey, during 2022. The correlation shows a good magnitude. The same in Condori (2017) 43 in his research whose objective was: to determine whether the systematized information cooperates in the management of graduates. Methodology: The Extreme Programming methodology is used, which turns out to be the one that has the greatest distinction of the skillful processes in software development, with a Quasi-Experimental structure, where the possible proposal was statistically used. Results: The answers corresponding to \"CA\" (Totally agree) are 44.98 percent, the answers corresponding to \"A\" (Agree) are 40.82 percent, those corresponding to NAD (Sometimes agree sometimes disagree) are 14.29 percent, and those corresponding to \"D\" (Disagree) are 0.00 Conclusion: The information system cooperates with the management of the outgoing of the Professional School of Systems Engineering of the Universidad Nacional del Altiplano."
