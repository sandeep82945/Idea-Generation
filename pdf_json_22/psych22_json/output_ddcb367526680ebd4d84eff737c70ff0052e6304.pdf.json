It becomes obvious that chess expertise is a multidimensional phenomenon related predominantly to experience. Under consideration of chess expertise categorization, we conducted two priming experiments expanding existing designs by gradually increasing the target and task complexity. The main aim was the evaluation of potential visuocognitive limitations. The results reveal experts\u2019 perceptual superiority manifested by their faster reaction times in settings with increased stimulus and task complexity. Further, experts\u2019 priming e ects seem to be a ected by the target content and/ or priming duration. For short prime duration, experts show priming e ects only for less complex prime-target content. Interestingly, for longer prime duration andmore complex prime-target content, all participants reveal priming e ects. In summary, we argue that experts\u2019 visuocognitive processing (i.e., detecting or anticipating potential threats to the king) is rooted in amore e cient visuocognition due to stored chunks of checking andmating constellations.We suggest that visuocognitive limitations are related also to the prime-target complexity as well as to the task. Further investigations must be conducted in order to elucidate the factors with an increased impact on chess players\u2019 performance.\nKEYWORDS\npriming, perceptual processing, chunking, prime-target complexity, decision making\nIntroduction\nThe term \u201cexpertise\u201d is used in various domains and is also part of everyday language. The definition of expertise is mainly related to indicators such as social reputation and completed education. However, in a specific domain expertise is highly correlated with performance perfection and dedicated exercise (Janelle and Hillman, 2003). Specifically, high expertise is attributed with more than 10 years of experience, which primarily refers to mental tasks in a specific domain (Chi et al., 1988; Klein and Hoffman, 1992). Experts should show reproducible predominant performance on representative tasks within their domain as well as in the context of laboratory and standardized tests (Ericsson and Smith, 1991). Under this point of view, cognitive skills such as perception superiority\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nand/ or information processing are indicated to play a crucial role for high-level expertise (Chase and Simon, 1973b; Gobet and Simon, 1996; Charness et al., 2001). Concerning the question of how high performance can be achieved, numerous research studies indicate that in any domain intense practice and varied training is required (Galton, 1979; Ericsson, 1996; Ericsson and Lehmann, 1996). Ackerman and Cianciolo (2000) argue that dedicated practice enables practitioners to improve their cognitive perceptual skills and Schack et al. link those skills with the demonstrated performance (Schack et al., 2014). To summarize the required skills for reaching expertise (i.e., perception, information processing, decision-making, problem solving, etc.) the term of visuocognition is established in the literature (e.g., Warren, 1993).\nIn the last decades, chess has become an outstanding object of research not only in strategic (decision-making) research, but also in the fields of visual searching and analysis. Chess is mentioned as the \u201cDrosophila of Artificial Intelligence\u201d (Simon and Chase, 1973; McCarthy, 1990). Moreover, Simon and Chase (1973) recommend chess as a prototype for many expertise domains because of its extremely high state-space complexity. The amount of 1047 legal game positions are reachable from the starting position, and this impedes the decision-making processes and strategy adaption during the game (Shannon, 1950; Gobet and Charness, 2006). Moreover, the fact that two chess matches are never exactly the same, and players never handle the exact same constellations during a chess match, underlines the complexity chess players have to deal with."

            "text": "If the body is the hardware, neurocognitive processing can be seen as the software, which makes the \u201csystem\u201d work faster. The performance of this software is higher the more chunks it uses, considering that chunks are clearly arranged small units of significant domain-specific information (Miller, 1956). To understand chess players\u2019 visuocognitive processing, the working memory became one of the central concepts. The study of De Groot (1966) represents the origin of research to capture the essence of chess memory skills. Specifically, De Groot (1966) employed recall tasks and think aloud protocols in decisionmaking during problem solving. In fact, the results show performance difference (correctness of decision) between grand masters and candidate masters in detecting the most efficient move in given chess positions. The think aloud protocols\u2019 analysis revealed that both participating groups reported a similar number of moves (e.g., problem solving) but grand masters as the highest skilled players found on the one hand more efficient solutions \u2013 chess moves \u2013 and at the same time they achieved results more quickly. De Groot\u2019s study is criticized due to the small sample size, the statistical analysis, and finally the participants\u2019 selection. Nevertheless, it remains a milestone\nof chess research. In line with de Groot\u2019s studies, Chase and Simon (1973a,b) were able to show that chess experts have significantly higher performance than less skilled players when memorizing meaningful chess constellations. Chase and Simon argue that those results can been explained by the chunking theory. At the same time, Simon and Gilmartin (1973) conclude that chunks are composed of five to eight meaningfully related pieces, and they estimate that there are approximately 50,000 chunks stored in the memory of a chess grand master. This calculation was based on the reproduction\u2019s analysis of chess game constellations through the participating grand masters. As a conclusion, it becomes obvious that chunks enhance the visuocognitive processing allowing chess experts to anticipate consequences of potential moves during a game and to select the best ones.\nReingold et al. (2001) in a reaction time experiment presented check constellations on a computer screen, whereas one of two pieces was checking the king. One of them was cued depending on the manipulation (attacking or not). The participants should decide as fast as possible if the cued piece checked the king. During the test, the experts showed difficulties inhibiting irrelevant information (e.g., not cued piece) and they only showed an interference effect compared to novices. In contrast, experts showed a faster reaction time when the attacker was cued. This indicates task-specific automaticity and perceptual encoding advantages of chess experts in check detection tasks (static chess situations).\nAdditionally, Kiesel et al. (2009) conducted a two-settings experiment using subliminal presentations of checking and nonchecking constellations in the first setting and simpler but uncommon chess configurations for the second, whereas a single piece was allocated on a black or white square. In the first setting two groups of experts and novices should perform a two-choice response, with respect to target stimuli (check or no-check for the first setting, and black or white for the second) under time pressure. Each target stimulus was preceded by a so-called prime. Those were congruent or incongruent to the target. The authors found out that the experts benefit from the congruent priming, which triggers the task-relevant response (congruent primes preactivate the required response to the target) whereas incongruent primes preactivate the contrary (Dehaene et al., 1998; Eimer and Schlaghecken, 2002). No congruency effects were found for the group of novices in the first setting. In the second setting with the simplified condition, only the experts participated, and they showed no effects. The authors esteem that the priming effects by experts should be related to the chunks. However, it is not clear why they investigated only chess experts and novices ignoring the level of intermediates, which could permit them to provide more detailed results.\nSupplementary to the above-mentioned studies, Postal (2012) assessed experts, intermediates, and novices by the replication and extension of the Reingold et al. (2001) design. First, the three groups had to perform a detection task with\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\ncued attackers and second a memory task involving attentional priming. In general, the results are in line with those of Reingold et al. (2001). However, the implementation of the intermediates in the design, allows a more differentiated analysis as well as more insights regarding the taxonomy and meaning of the different expertise levels. Interestingly, in the memory task only intermediates benefit from attentional priming, which seems to facilitate the selection of relevant information.\nFrom this point of view, visuocognition can be considered as the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of chess-performance. As an additional method for the analysis of visual strategies, Sheridan and Reingold (2014) employed eye-tracking when participants had to identify the most efficient move in given chess constellations. Their results indicate that highly skilled chess players use more effective visual search strategies (e.g., analysis implying the amount and duration of the fixation as well as points of interest) when they distinguish between task-relevant and taskirrelevant regions of a chessboard. Additionally, not only dealing with static chess situations but also task-planning experiments (dynamic chess situations) assume that perceptual skill is a key aspect of chess expertise. For instance, Sheridan and Reingold (2017) designed a screen-based gaze selection task in which participants had to plan the complex movements of the knight. Participants would decide in which of four presented chess constellations the knight could reach a target square within three moves. Following the same analysis procedure as Sheridan and Reingold (2014) the authors underline that experts show a high visuocognitive efficiency regarding their visual searching strategies, which facilitates their decision-making processing, compared to novices. Interestingly, the middle performance stage of the intermediates was also disregarded here.\nRecent research on virtual chess players benefits from the given opportunities to analyze the multidimensional visuocognitive processing of several players and to program real players\u2019 computer simulators (Dhou, 2018) based on those data. For the programming, the crucial information regards players\u2019 personality, their strategical thinking, fortitude, and weaknesses independent from the opponent\u2019s skills. However, the consideration of visuocognitive limitations seems to be also important in terms of virtual chess players\u2019 perfection/ personalization but also in order to explicitly train visuospatial skills of real human opponents (i.e., through emulation of specific chess constellations during a virtual game)."

            "text": "The main goal of the present study was to identify visuocognitive performance limits, under special consideration of a) the expertise level and b) the task/target complexity. In order to enable a more detailed analysis, we extend the experimental setting of Kiesel et al. (2009) employing check and mate detection tasks in static as well as in planning the\nnext move settings. Further, we manipulate the complexity expanding the size of the presented stimuli as well as the number of involved pieces. Finally, we consider in our design intermediates aiming to bridge the gap between the different expertise levels providing a more detailed analysis. This potentially contributes to expertise research, e.g., to identify incremental changes between intermediates and experts. In order to reach the determined goals, two experiments were conducted.\nExperiment 1: Subliminal priming\nKiesel et al. (2009) could show in a priming paradigm experiment, that only experts (in contrast to novices) are able to respond significantly faster in the case of congruency between the prime and target stimulus (i.e., both showing either check or no check). This means that features of pieces\u2019 identities and locations are linked. However, Kiesel et al. (2009) also found evidence for limitations of chess experts\u2019 perceptual superiority. The question arising here is to what extent the diversity of expertise affects the results of the study? From this point of view, further investigations should be conducted in order to analyze perceptual differences between more similar groups regarding their expertise and also with a circumstantial differentiation of the provided stimuli."

A larger number of pieces requires a larger stimulus, [e.g., 4 \u00d7 4 chessboards instead of 3 \u00d7 3 chessboards such as employed in Kiesel et al.

            "heading": "Stimuli and procedure",
            "text": "Both settings employ visual chess stimuli on a computer screen conducted as a priming paradigm (Kiesel et al., 2009). All stimuli do not only contain a king and an attacking piece (a queen or a rook) but also in addition a pawn of the same color as the attacker.\nFor the check detection setting, we designed stimuli in which the position of queen, rook, and pawn were never repeated. As revealed by Pohl (2011), a repetition of pieces\u2019 positions in unconsciously presented stimuli might cause unintentional location priming effects. For instance, if in one stimulus a queen would check the king and if in the subsequently shown stimulus a rook was on the same square as the queen in the previous stimulus but without check, the form location priming could suggest the rook checks the king.\nAccordingly, in themate detection setting the pawn is needed to assist the queen in mating. In order to generate an equal complexity of stimuli in both settings, they both likewise employ a white pawn in each stimulus although the pawn has no influence on checking or non-checking. Moreover, queen and rook have a significantly different form, so the effect of formpriming is excluded (Pohl, 2011). Hence, two pieces with similar form and size (e.g., a bishop and a queen) could cause a priming effect, since they are not clearly distinguishable when they are presented unconsciously. Hence, the situations to be judged are more complex than in Kiesel et al. (2009) namely to distinguish a mere check from a mate. The white queen is either mating or merely checking the king. Since a rook cannot mate the king with the sole assistance of a pawn, rooks are not used in themate detection setting.\nFinally, we assumed that the higher complexity of our stimuli would require more intense information processing. Therefore, we use a longer prime presentation time of 100ms compared to Kiesel et al. (2009) yet staying under the threshold of conscious perception (Elgendi et al., 2018).\nAll 16 stimuli were 4 \u00d7 4 chessboards extending to a 60mm square. The black king was always located in the upper left corner following the example of Kiesel et al. (2009). According to the two different experimental conditions, the stimuli were subdivided into two categories.\nIn the check detection setting (Figure 1A), four checking and four non-checking positions were used: Two of each kind as targets, respectively as primes. Each contained a white pawn that does not contribute to either checking or non-checking. The attackers were a queen (four stimuli) or a rook (four stimuli) and never occupied the same position. Congruent prime-target pairs had the conditions check/check (c/c) or no check/no check (nc/nc), incongruent prime-target pairs the conditions check/no check (c/nc) and no check/check (nc/c), respectively.\nIn the mate detection setting, eight other stimuli were employed showing the white queen assisted by a white pawn. In half of the cases, they were mating the king, in the other half only checking the king. In addition to the check detection setting, four stimuli were used as targets (two showing a mate and two showing a check only) and the other four as prime stimuli. The stimuli conditions were referred to as mate (m) and check (c). Prime-target pairs\u2019 conditions were denoted by \u201cm/m\u201d or \u201cc/c\u201d (congruency) and \u201cm/c\u201d or \u201cc/m\u201d (incongruity).\nEach setting contained 80 trials \u2013 every prime-target combination was presented five times in random order. For both settings (e.g., first setting: c/c - nc/c; nc/nc - c/nc; and second setting: m/m - c/m; c/c - m/c), each trial (Figure 1F) starts with a fixation cross in the center of the screen, presented for 400ms followed by prime target (duration 100ms) then a blank screen (100ms) and finally the target (max. 5,000ms). Participants received no information about the structure of the prime stimuli."

In order to achieve this, we measured the correctness of the responses and RT among three groups of\ndifferent proficiency (i.e., experts, intermediates and novices) under special consideration of the priming congruency. For both settings, we hypothesized that experts and intermediates would show significantly more correct responses than novices. No differences were found concerning the amount of the correct responses among all groups in setting 1. However, in setting 2 experts responded significantly more accurately compared to intermediates and novices. Further, intermediates provided a better performance of correctness than novices.\nAccording to the existing findings, we assumed that experts would show a significantly shorter RT than the other, less skilled groups. Finally, we expected to reveal a congruency-priming-effect for experts. The results confirm existing findings of Kiesel et al. (2009) and partly our assumption that expertise is consistent to the information processing rate but limited through the prime-target complexity. Regarding the between-group differences for RT, we were able to show that experts responded significantly faster than intermediates and novices in both settings (complexity manipulation in a static constellation). These performance differences were also measured for both conditions (congruent/incongruent). Hence, experts provide a superior visuocognitive performance.\nThe analysis of the priming effects revealed a congruency effect only in setting 1 for the experts. In setting 2 we revealed no congruency effects at all. We assume that these results can be explained on the one hand with the chunking model (Chase and Simon, 1973a,b) and on the other hand through the higher prime-target complexity. In order to examine the referred limitations, the conduction of a further experiment appears essential, whereas the reasoning as well as the reaction planning require a more comprehensive visuocognitive performance.\nExperiment 2: Subliminal priming and planning the next move\nIn the second experiment we also followed up on the question of whether the differences between the participants\u2019 expertise affects the results of the studies of Kiesel et al. (2009) and Sheridan and Reingold (2017). Therefore, we compared experts, intermediates, and novices with respect to their visuocognitive performance in a more complex reaction time task than in Experiment 1. In order to realize thementioned complexity, we combined the approaches of Kiesel et al. (2009) and Sheridan and Reingold (2017). As in Experiment 1 visual chess stimuli were presented on a computer screen. In contrast to Experiment 1, there was only one setting, and the task was to plan the next move (mating or checking the king) (Figure 1D) while the prime stimuli (Figure 1C) showed a static situation (king is already mated or checked).\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org"

Instead, each stimulus contained a black king, two black pawns and a white attacker (in half of the stimuli a queen and in the other half a rook). Both queen and rook have linear movement patterns in contrast to the knight. Unlike the Sheridan and Reingold (2017) design, only one prime-target stimulus was presented per trial (e.g., Experiment 1). The scenario for each target stimulus was: \u201cWhite has to move - can the black king be mated within one move?\u201d. In this sense, the response targets require future planning similar to Sheridan and Reingold (2017). An impending mate must be identified. Therefore, the results of the movements in our stimuli were more complex and included a discrimination task (\u201cIs there a mate or check impending?\u201d).\nWe introduced prime stimuli preceding the target stimuli similar to the experimental course in Experiment 1. Each prime stimulus can be either congruent or incongruent with the result of the move in the subsequent target stimulus. Hereby, congruency was defined analogously to Experiment 1. Prime and target stimulus showed the same condition (e.g., prime stimulus with a mate and target stimulus with an impending mate).\nWe hypothesized that experts would perform significantly better regarding the number of the correct responses and the RT and would show congruency effects compared to intermediates. Following up, we assumed that intermediates would have a shorter RT than novices. We expected no congruency effects at all for the two last groups."

As in Experiment 1, the black king is always located in the upper left corner. Twelve chess constellations were used as targets and the other 12 as primes. Six targets showed an impending mate (analogously to the notation in Experiment 1 denoted by \u201cm\u201d). The constellation implied a queen (three stimuli) or a rook (three stimuli) attacking the king. In contrast, the other six targets presented an impending check (denoted by \u201cc\u201d), including a queen (three stimuli) or a rook (three stimuli). Six of the prime stimuli presented the king already mated (no move to be planned). The other six prime stimuli contained a mere check. Due to the lack of combinatorial possibilities for a rook checkmating the king on a 4 \u00d7 4 chessboard, only two of them employ a rook. In the six constellations showing a mere check both queen and rook were employed three times.\nEach trial included a fixation cross (400ms), a blank sequence (70ms), the prime stimulus (300ms), another blank screen (70ms), and finally the target. We took into account that the complexity of our stimuli again has been increased and this requires more intense information processing than in Experiment 1. Therefore, we used a longer prime presentation time of 300ms. Again, this is under the threshold of 500ms which is generally considered to imply conscious perception (Elgendi et al., 2018). Five seconds were allowed as the maximum response time. Two blank screens were introduced to diminish the awareness of the primes. Participants were instructed analogously to Experiment 1 and were asked to give their decision via the button box. The experiment consisted of two blocks, each of them containing 144 prime-targetpairs, i.e., 12 (primes) times 12 (targets), presented in a random order. In line to the first experiment and in contrast to Kiesel et al. (2009), participants received no information about the structure of the prime stimuli.

This means that our hypothesis that the planning task would limit visuocognitive performance (e.g., priming effects) of the participants can be rejected. However, the observed reversed priming effects (Eimer and Schlaghecken, 2002) are of considerable interest. For example, Kahan (2000) and Goodhew et al. (2011) associate reversed priming effects as no priming with incorrect prime identification. Therefore, the high-threat detection task (a mate, which means the end of the game) in the prime stimuli in combination with the conscious target analysis can not only cause but also explain these effects."

            "text": "In the present study, we have investigated chess players\u2019 visuocognitive performance as a function of expertise and degree of complexity in decision-making tasks. Herein, we have manipulated the prime-target complexity with respect to the chessboard size, the chess threat level and by either judging static situations or planning the next move. In summary, we have hypothesized that expertise has a significant impact on the correctness of response as well as on the RT. Finally, we expected priming effects only for the experts (Kiesel et al., 2009) and that these effects vanish with increasing prime-target complexity starting with a static chess situation switching to a dynamic task which implies the planning of the next move. Our results confirm most of our hypotheses.\nIn Experiment 1, we have shown that highly-skilled chess players benefit from superior visuocognition and reveal a faster response by decision making which supports past findings (Charness et al., 2001; Reingold et al., 2001; Sheridan and Reingold, 2014). In the check detection setting experts reacted faster but not more accurately as the other groups. The response priming effects which were observed only for the experts indicate that they are able to take advantage of acquired perceptual chunks (Chase and Simon, 1973a) which is also in line with the results of Kiesel et al. (2009). Similar results were found in the second setting with regard to the response accuracy. Experts performed not only faster but also gave significantly more correct answers. Furthermore, the lack of priming effects in the mate detection setting\ncontributes additional insights regarding the findings of Kiesel et al. (2009) and especially concerning limitations of experts\u2019 advantages for acquired perceptual chunks. Addressing the nonsignificant priming effect in the second setting, we argue that the detection of a mate is more complex than the one of a check and requires conscious comparisons processing and exhaustive search.\nIn Experiment 2, we have confirmed that expertise is advantageous regarding the accuracy and the reaction time of planning the next move (detection of mate in one). Experts and intermediates showed a significantly higher processing efficiency than novices reacting significantly more accurately. Additionally, experts were significantly faster in all experimental conditions compared to the other groups. This is in line with results of Charness et al. (2001), Kiesel et al. (2009) and Sheridan and Reingold (2014) and Sheridan and Reingold (2017). Finally, not only experts but also all groups showed a congruency effect. That is, here we could not find any evidence about limitations of visuocognitive performance, which are related to a high prime-target complexity.\nThese results can be explained by the longer presentation of the complex prime stimulus, which includes a mate identification task, triggers the reversed priming effect, and probably in our case was increased through the searching of the higher threat for the king (mate)."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "We are aware that our study has several limitations. First, accordingly to the fact that we use only two fixed prime durations, it is possible that the results do not reveal all fine differences according to the visuocognitive performance among the three different expertise groups. Second, we have increased the complexity of the stimuli and task quite coarsely (i.e., from a mere check identification task in static positions in Experiment 1, setting 1 to a mate identification task in Experiment 1, setting 2 and furthermore up to planning the next move in Experiment 2). We propose that a finer grading of complexity concerning stimuli and task combinations could lead to a more detailed mapping of the visuocognitive performance of chess players with different levels of expertise.\nResearch must invest more effort using a multimodal approach (visual strategies \u2013 eye tracking, sensor technologies, and usage of real chess boards for a realistic 3D chess scenario) in order to clarify the insights about the processes behind the visuocognitive performance of chess players. Such an approach will allow detailed insights into players\u2019 visuocognition and will deliver an amount of additional information, which can extend and specify the research as well as for instance the application of virtual chess players.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Altogether, our results indicate that high processing efficiency and a superior visuocognitive performance (correctness of answers, RT) requires a high level of expertise. Nevertheless, visuocognitive performance regarding priming effects is not only affected by the manipulation of the primetarget complexity but probably also by the prime duration. We assume that the potential of threat (mate or check) presented in the target also affects the priming effects (i.e., in a check situation participants have to perform more than one comparison before they make their decision and correctly rule out a mate). In this sense of reasoning, our findings facilitate deeper insights into congruency effects and give impulses for future research concerning interrelations between congruency effects and planning of the next move in given chess constellations."
