ABSTRACT Objective This study aimed to determine the factors associated with minimum dietary diversity (MDD) and estimate the socioeconomic inequalities in MDD among children from five South Asian countries. Design Crosssectional. Setting The study used the most recent round of secondary databases of Demographic Health Survey data of Bangladesh (2017\u20132018), India (2019\u20132021), Maldives (2016\u20132017), Nepal (2018) and Pakistan (2017\u20132018). Participants This study used information on MDD and other explanatory variables from a total of 136 980 (weighted) children aged 6\u201323 months. Methods Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify the factors associated with MDD and concentration index (CIX) and Lorenz curve were used to measure the socioeconomic inequalities in MDD. Results The overall weighted prevalence of MDD in South Asia was 23.37%. The highest prevalence of MDD was found among children from Maldives (70.7%), while the lowest was in Pakistan (14.2%). Living in affluent versus poor households, having a mother who is employed versus a mother who is unemployed, exposure to various forms of media (newspapers and magazines), seeking antenatal care (ANC) more than four times compared with those who sought ANC less than four times and having children older than 4 years old are the most common significant factors associated with MDD deficiency. This study found the value of the CIX for MDD (MDD: CI=0.0352; p<0.001) among children with a higher socioeconomic status, suggesting inequality in MDD in favour of the more among welloff households. Conclusion Inequality in the prevalence of MDD favours the affluent. Health policy and intervention design should prioritise minimising socioeconomic inequalities concerning the MDD. In addition, policymakers should prioritise the associated factors of MDD such as education, wealth status, employment, media exposure while designing intervention or policies.",

Because only one out of every six children aged6\u201323 months receives a minimum acceptable diet, which includes both the minimal number of meals and the diversity of the diet, putting children at risk of irreversible cognitive development and outrageously increasing the risk of stunting, wasting and underweight.3 Nearly one- fourth of young children do not get the balanced nutrition they need to grow properly, especially in the first 1000 days, in a number of different nations.4 5 In the early years of life, in particular, optimal IYCF practices help to assure growth and raise children\u2019s survival rates by lowering the risk of various chronic diseases and lifestyle- related illnesses.6 7\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 Several variables, such as ethnicity, health expenditure, household food security linked to minimum dietary diversity (MDD), were not possible to include due to missing variables and missing information in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset. \u21d2 The study used a cross- sectional design, which restricts the causative direction of the identified components. \u21d2 The use of 24- hour recall data for MDD might be a recall bias problem. \u21d2 We have used five nationally representative latest cross- sectional DHS datasets from five South Asian countries, which is our greatest strength. \u21d2 The inclusion of variables, such as media exposure, health services us in the multivariable analysis, increases the validity of the findings.\n(IIT P atna).

BMJ Open 2023;13:e072775. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072775\nOpen access\nAccording to the WHO and UNICEF, a child needs to eat from at least five of the eight food categories in order to get the ideal amount of nutrition required for their overall growth.8 The key to assessing nutritional adequacy in young children and newborns is to increase dietary diversity since it ensures enough intake of critical nutrients and a high- quality diet.9 Therefore, a diet made up of a variety of food categories is crucial to ensuring enough nutrition, preventing malnutrition, and promoting healthy growth and development from infancy to adolescence.10 11 Minimum dietary diversity (MDD) is an issue that both underdeveloped and wealthy countries are concerned about. Globally, less than one- third of infants and young children are receiving the recommended diversified diet, while South Asia and sub- Saharan African countries are in a dire situation here; only one out of every four children aged 6\u201323 months consumes a minimally diversified diet.12 Data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) (2017\u20132018) show that only 12% of under- 5 children in Pakistan received the recommended minimum acceptable diet in 2018, where 21% met at least the MDD requirement and 38% met the minimum food frequency requirement.13 In Nepal, only 36% of children met MDD14; and in India, it is 32.6%.15 Bangladesh has a low level of dietary diversity, with only 41.9% of the population eating a variety of foods.16 Achieving this minimum nutritional requirement is difficult, especially in lowincome and middle- income countries where financial and food scarcities are common.\nFurthermore, income inequality has demonstrated a persistent correlation with reduced achievement in MDD across the countries under consideration.11 17 18 Among these nations, India exhibits the highest level of inequality, as evidenced by its Gini coefficient value of 35.7%. In contrast, the Maldives boasts the lowest inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 29.3%.19 Notably, other countries included in this analysis, namely Bangladesh, India and Nepal, also grapple with substantial levels of income inequality within their respective borders. The significance of diverse food consumption in mitigating malnutrition is well acknowledged. However, comprehensive research is scarce in this realm. Notably, Harvey et al pointed out the absence of cross- national or subregional analyses on the variables impacting dietary diversity among young children.18 Similarly, Belay et al emphasised the dearth of evidence concerning determinants of minimum dietary intake in South Asian nations.20 Solomon et al highlighted a prevailing focus on community and rural contexts, leaving a gap in understanding how these factors influence minimum dietary intake across diverse countries within South Asia.21\nIn order to comprehensively enhance child health and nutritional well- being through comprehensive interventions, a nuanced understanding of the variations and underlying factors influencing MDD is essential. South Asian countries, such as Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Maldives, have similar socioeconomic contexts and cultural differences, but high rates of inadequate\nMDD in infants and young children. This makes it interesting and possible to compare the findings from these countries and develop similar policy recommendations. This study aims to determine the prevalence of socioeconomic inequalities in MDD and its potential determinants in these five countries. By addressing this research gap, the study hopes to provide valuable insights for designing targeted strategies and programmes to improve dietary diversity and the overall nutritional well- being of infants and young children in these countries.\nMETHODS Data source and sampling The study used the most recent round of secondary databases of Demographic Health Survey data of Bangladesh (2017\u20132018), India (2019\u20132021), Maldives (2016\u20132017), Nepal (2018) and Pakistan (2017\u20132018).22\u201326 The survey was carried out in accordance with national regulations. The Demographic and Household Surveys are nationally representative household surveys that use a multistage, stratified sampling strategy to attain comprehensive information in terms of nutrition and health data on children, their parents and households. The first stage comprises the division of each country in geographical regions.27 Urban or rural areas make up different strata of the people within these subnational regions. These main sample units, or clusters, are chosen with a probability proportionate to the population contribution of each cluster to the total population. All of the cluster\u2019s households are listed during the second sampling step, and an average of 25 of them are then randomly chosen for interviews using a systematic sampling method with equal probabilities.28 The DHS report for the particular country has more details about the sampling process. The ever- married women who had children were questioned about their children\u2019s nutritional status."

After this, during the second stage of data processing, any responses that were either incomplete or not reported for the variables required to compute dietary variety were omitted. This iterative process yielded a dataset comprising information from 136 980 children (unweighted).\nTo ensure the statistical robustness of our analyses on a national scale and when pooling data, we integrated sample weights, clustering and stratification characteristics sourced from DHS programme guidelines. Addressing the inherent interdependence among data points within clusters and households, we organised the data into clusters based on the primary sampling unit. In pooled analyses, we also considered latent country- level factors by adjusting observations based on population size and incorporating country- fixed effects. Our method involved creating two sets of binary logistic regression models for pooled analysis of the outcome. Initially, we employed separate single- adjusted models for each influencing factor. Subsequently, we constructed a mutually adjusted\nmodel, denoted as the fully adjusted model, where all significant factors were simultaneously considered.\nThe characteristics of the data and the distribution of dietary diversity among the explanatory variables are tabulated using simple descriptive statistics. Lorenz curve was constructed to determine whether there is an MDD inequality based on household wealth status. Plotting the cumulative proportion of respondents who reported having a minimum level of food diversity versus the cumulative proportion of respondents who reported having a minimum level of wealth status reveals the inequality in at least MDD. Any deviation from the line, which is marked by a 45\u00b0 line, denotes the presence of inequality. Suppose the concentration curve is below the line of equality. In that case, it means that respondents with higher wealth status are more likely to have better than minimal dietary diversity. If the concentration curve is above the equality line, respondents with lower wealth status are more likely to have better than minimal dietary diversity.\nThe CIX was calculated to quantify the level of concentration. The formula developed by Kakwani,29 Jenkins30 and Kakwani et al31 was used to calculate the CI, known as the convenient covariance approach. The formula is as follows:\nCIX = 2 \u00b5 cov\n( h, r ) ;\nHere, \u03bc is the weighted mean of the MDD, h is the MDD variable and r is the fractional rank of the individual in the distribution of household wealth status, cov(h, r) denotes the covariance between h and r. The user- written STATA commands Lorenz32 and conindex33 were used to produce the Lorenz curve and measure CIX, respectively. CIX takes values within the closed interval of \u22121 and+1. The closer the value of CIX to +1, the higher the concentration in the upper quantile of the variable by which concentration is calculated, and the closer the value of CIX to \u22121, the higher the concentration in the lower quantile of the variable by which concentration is calculated."

In India, fathers\u2019 involvement in agriculture (AOR: 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.40; p<0.008) was found to increase the chance of MDD, whereas in the Maldives it decreased the probability of greater than minimal dietary diversity. Bangladesh, India and Nepal were shown to have statistically significant associations with affluent households, whereas Maldives and Pakistan exhibited no association. The practice\nof reading newspapers and magazines was found to be significant in increasing the likeliness of MDD for both Bangladesh (AOR: 1.60 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.40; p<0.025) and India (AOR: 1.44 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.63; p<0.001).

This observation underscores a clear correlation between income inequality and the ability to achieve MDD. The nexus between income and dietary diversity is further elucidated by the fact that individuals with limited financial resources, prevalent among lower- income populations, often face challenges in accessing a variety of nutrient- rich foods.11 The higher cost of fresh produce and lean proteins creates a financial barrier, compelling individuals with lower incomes to opt for more affordable yet less nutritious alternatives. This economic divide contributes to disparities in dietary choices and nutritional outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing income inequality to improve overall nutritional well- being.17\nThe increased inequality in these regions can be attributed to constrained access to quality education and human capital development, challenges in land ownership and agrarian structures. Varying degrees of industrialisation and urbanisation, coupled with potential labour exploitation, also play a role.39 These underlying factors may exert an indirect impact on MDD, as evidenced in our study by the observed lower attainment rate.34 35\nChildren with older mothers were more likely to have MDD than children with younger- aged mothers, and this finding is in line with the previous study\n(IIT P atna).

Previous studies also identified that more maternal ANC visits and PNC check- ups are associated with higher MDD in children.16 49 50 Using health facilities during delivery was also an associated factor in an earlier study in Tanzania.51 Healthcare providers provide information about maternal health and child health, consulting and discussing the importance of dietary diversity for children during ANC visits, PNC visits or during institutional delivery, which might help increase parents\u2019 understanding towards child MDD.43 52\nResults demonstrate that parental education is significantly associated with MDD among South Asian countries\u2019 children and showed a positive trend as the parents\u2019 education leads to an increase in MDD of their children compared with the children with no educated parents. Several studies in countries such as Myanmar, Indonesia and South- East Asia illustrate the relationship between parental education and MDD and point out a positive association.16 53 54 Parental education is the primary element that possibly improves the guidance to enhance the knowledge about maternal health, child health and child nutrition, increasing the MDD among the children.18 53 Moreover, education gives opportunity to parents to engage in paid job which is conducive to buy enough foods for the family and children.21 55 Our study showed a positive association between working mothers and a higher rate of MDD, which is in line with the previous literature51 This might be because mothers who are involved in an income- earning job are able to purchase a different kind of food, ensuring an MDD for their children. Furthermore, earning mothers tend to be autonomous in decision- making for their household, which leads to an improved quality diet for their family and their children.56 57\nSimilarly, children from the wealthiest quintile had a higher likelihood of receiving MDD compared with children from the poorest quintile. This difference could be attributed to household members in the poorest quintile consuming food with less diversity and struggling to maintain MDD due to financial constraints.43 58 In the face of a financial crisis, children from the poorest quintile face barriers to nutritious food as their parents may struggle to provide diverse diets compared with parents in the most affluent quintile. Furthermore, the findings from this study suggest that access to MDD decreases as inequality within the country, with Pakistan scoring the lowest in the attainment of MDD among children aged 6\u201323 months. This aligns with similar findings in several studies, confirming that the richest wealth quintile has higher access to MDD.35 43 58 59 This relationship between\nwealth quintiles and MDD access may be attributed to the domino effect of inequality within a country, affecting various sectors, including education, health services and government services. Moreover, governmental efforts towards international and national nutrition programmes and addressing cultural barriers may also play a role in MDD.60\nHowever, due to limitations in available secondary data, we excluded variables such as ethnicity, health expenditure and household food security in our analysis, variables such as ethnicity, health expenditure, household food security linked to MDD was not possible to include due to missing variables and missing information in the original DHS dataset. In addition, due to the cross- sectional nature the causative direction of the identified components, and the use of 24- hour recall data for MDD are some of its significant limitations. The strengths of this study are the inclusion of variables such as media exposure, health services use in the multivariable analysis, which increases the validity of the findings. Furthermore, we have used five nationally representative latest crosssectional DHS datasets from five South Asian countries, which is our greatest strength.\nPast studies61 found these variables significant for predicting MDD.61\u201363 Ethnicity may have varied national and country- specific effects on MDD.63 Similarly, health and food expenditure within households62 could be influential. Although our analysis could not quantify their contributions, future research should include these variables for a more comprehensive understanding of MDD determinants.\nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS Despite impressive success in eliminating maternal and child mortality and malnutrition in this region, many children still do not have a good variety of foods in their diets. This study revealed a glaring imbalance between countries with low dietary diversification. In response, stakeholders must establish tailored initiatives, programmes and policies. Leveraging mass media for health education and advocating for mandatory female education can effectively promote dietary diversity, as indicated by this study\u2019s findings. Furthermore, the implementation of a targeted cash transfer programme, specifically designed to provide direct financial assistance to families living in poverty, particularly those within the lowest income quintiles, can play a pivotal role in addressing the issue. Urgent attention is needed to implement cross- sectoral measures that enhance dietary variety services across all nations in the region."

The findings suggest that these can be possible targets of future interventions to improve MDD among children in South Asia, particularly among those who belong to economically poor households. The findings of this study also suggest that while developing health policy, it is important to consider both the level of socioeconomic disparity in MDD and its associated factors. Researching successful strategies from other countries can provide valuable insights for refining action plans in similar contexts, offering potential solutions to improve dietary diversity and nutritional outcomes. Moreover, implementing longitudinal studies incorporating diverse indicators such as ethnicity, health expenditure and maternal body mass index, child birth weight along with a decomposition approach to the CIX regarding explanatory variables, would aid in identifying contributing factors to inequalities in MDD. This approach enables a more precise prediction of specific factors behind these inequalities and their impact on MDD attainment. Our research adds to the body of data from subnational levels in five South Asian nations demonstrating the urgent need for coordinated action on subnational level awareness and successful strategic initiatives in South Asian nations to curb the socioeconomic inequalities in MDD among children.\nContributors MAR contributed to literature search, data analysis and interpretation, figures and tables, and writing the manuscript draft and contributed to the revision.
