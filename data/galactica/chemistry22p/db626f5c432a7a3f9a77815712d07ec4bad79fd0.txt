Point-of-Care (POC) testing for biomarker detection demands techniques that are easy to use, readily available, low-cost, and with rapid response times. This paper describes the development of a fully open-source, modular, wireless, battery-powered, smartphone-controlled, low-cost potentiostat capable of conducting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the electrochemical detection of the S100B protein captured in an ANTI-S100B functionalized thin-film gold interdigitated electrode platform to support traumatic brain injury diagnosis and treatment. EIS results from the developed potentiostat were validated with a commercial benchtop potentiostat by comparing impedance magnitude and phase values along the EIS frequency range. In addition, an experimental design was performed for detecting S100B in spiked human plasma samples with S100B concentrations of clinical utility, and a calibration curve was found for quantifying S100B detection. No statistically significant differences were found between EIS results from the developed potentiostat and the commercial potentiostat. Statistically significant differences in the changes in charge transfer resistance signal between each tested S100B concentration (p < 0.05) were found, with a limit of detection of 35.73 pg/mL. The modularity of the proposed potentiostat allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others, when compared to state-of-the-art opensource EIS potentiostats. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, high-level filtering, accurate ADC, Fast Fourier Transform with low spectral leakage, wireless communication, and the simple user interface provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis and developing new affordable instrumentation for POC biosensors integrated systems.

The TBISTAT occupies 216 cm3, weighs 120 g, and has an approximate manufacturing cost of 80 USD. Its design is built upon the potentiostats made by Jenkins et al. [22] and Ainla et al. [24], improving accuracy in phase and magnitude measurements and reducing discontinuities in the overall impedance calculations along the 1-10KHz frequency excitation range and between 100O and 35KO. Source code for MCU firmware and Android application, Gerber files, schematics, and device operation video of TBISTAT have been made freely available for download to promote its use, enhancement, and employment in applications in either medical, animal, food or agroindustry. Furthermore, the modularity of the design allows easier component changes according to the application demands in power, frequency excitation ranges, wireless communication protocol, signal amplification and transduction, precision, and sampling frequency of ADC, among others. In addition, the use of minimal, easy acquirable open-source hardware and software, together with high-level filtering, low-cost, accurate ADC, wireless communication, and the simple user interface, provides a framework for facilitating EIS analysis for similar POC applications such as the one presented in this work and for developing affordable diagnostics and POC biosensors integrated systems.
