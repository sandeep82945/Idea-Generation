1. **Investigate the role of pharmacogenomics in predicting treatment response and adverse events in AUD patients.** This could lead to the development of personalized medicine approaches that tailor treatment to the individual patient's genetic profile.


2. **Develop new objective measures of alcohol consumption to improve the accuracy and reliability of clinical trials and research studies.** This could involve the use of biosensors, mobile devices, or other technologies to track alcohol intake in real time.


3. **Explore the use of novel drug targets and mechanisms of action for the treatment of AUD.** This could involve targeting specific neurofunctional domains implicated in AUD, such as incentive salience, negative emotionality, and executive function.


4. **Investigate the long-term efficacy of pharmacological interventions for AUD, including their ability to prevent relapse and improve comorbid psychiatric disorders.** This could involve conducting long-term follow-up studies of patients who have received treatment for AUD.


5. **Develop integrated care models that address the multiple medical and psychiatric comorbidities associated with AUD.** This could involve collaboration between addiction specialists, primary care physicians, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care to patients with AUD.
