    "abstractText": "Convergence rates for L2 approximation in a Hilbert space H are a central theme in numerical analysis. The present work is inspired by Schaback (Math. Comp., 1999), who showed, in the context of best pointwise approximation for radial basis function interpolation, that the convergence rate for sufficiently smooth functions can be doubled, compared to the general rate for functions in the \u201cnative space\u201d H . Motivated by this, we obtain a general result for H-orthogonal projection onto a finite dimensional subspace of H : namely, that any known L2 convergence rate for all functions in H translates into a doubled L2 convergence rate for functions in a smoother normed space B, along with a similarly improved error bound in the H-norm, provided that L2, H and B are suitably related. As a special case we improve the known L2 and Hnorm convergence rates for kernel interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, with particular attention to a recent study (Kaarnioja, Kazashi, Kuo, Nobile, Sloan, Numer. Math., 2022) of periodic kernel-based interpolation at lattice points applied to parametric partial differential equations. A second application is to radial basis function interpolation for general conditionally positive definite basis functions, where again the L2 convergence rate is doubled, and the convergence rate in the native space norm is similarly improved, for all functions in a smoother normed space B.",

            "text": "A common situation in computational mathematics and approximation theory is that one seeks to approximate a real-valued function f defined on a domain D, and belonging to some Hilbert space H continuously embedded in L2(D), by the H-orthogonal projection Pf of f onto a finite-dimensional subspace V \u2282 H. Many error bounds holding for all functions f \u2208 H are known. Our aim in this paper is to provide improved error bounds for functions g lying in a \u201csmoother\u201d normed space B continuously embedded in H: we prove, under an appropriate relation between the spaces L2, H and B (see (2) below), a doubled rate of convergence of \u2016g \u2212 Pg\u2016L2 for g \u2208 B, and an analogous improved rate of convergence for the error in the H norm, \u2016g \u2212 Pg\u2016H .\nThe finite-dimensional spaces we have in mind are varied: for example, V might be a linear space of polynomials or splines; or radial basis functions of given shape and a fixed set of nodes on Rd; or a space of wavelets or kernels. The domain might be Rd or an open subset of Rd, or a manifold such as Sd\u22121 := {x \u2208 Rd : \u2016x\u2016\u21132 = 1}.\n\u2217School of Mathematics and Statistics, UNSW Sydney, Sydney NSW 2052, Australia.

Email: vesa.kaarnioja@fu-berlin.de\nFor very many Hilbert spaces H and subspaces V error bounds of the following form are known for \u2016f \u2212 Pf\u2016L2 :\n\u2016f \u2212 Pf\u2016L2 \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016f\u2016H for all f \u2208 H, (1)\nwhere n := dim(V ), \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H denotes the norm in H, and \u03ba > 0 is a known constant. Results of this kind lie at the heart of computational mathematics. If \u03ba is the supremum of all such constants then the result is one of best approximation.\nThe main aim of this paper is to show that if H and V are such that (1) holds, and if B is an appropriate subspace of H (see (2) below), then an L2 error bound with a doubled convergence rate holds for all functions in B: specifically, we will prove\n\u2016g \u2212 Pg\u2016L2 \u2264 c 2n\u22122\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B for all g \u2208 B.\nMoreover, under the same condition the error bound in the H norm will be shown to have the same bound as in (1), specifically\n\u2016g \u2212 Pg\u2016H \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B for all g \u2208 B.\nThe relation between the linear spaces L2, H and B needed in this work, in addition to the embedding of H in L2 and of B in H, is\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g\u2016B for all f \u2208 H, g \u2208 B. (2)\nA relation of this kind, while not universal, often holds (especially after utilising the freedom that exists in the choice of B), for example it may hold if \u3008f, g\u3009H has a Fourier series definition, or if the inner product in H is the L2 inner product of gradients. Simple examples are given in the next section.\nThe first result with the doubled-rate flavor appears to have been obtained by Schaback in [9], in the special context of best pointwise approximation by radial basis function interpolation; see also [11]. The paper [9] is the inspiration for the present doubled-rate result. An earlier progenitor is the Aubin\u2013Nitsche lemma [2, 8].\nA recent paper by Hangelbroek and Rieger [5], again in the context of radial basis function interpolation, asked a different question, namely whether improved convergence rates can be seen in norms other than L2. That paper encouraged us to seek the above error bound in the H norm.\nThe results above are proved in a general Hilbert space context in Section 3, see Theorem 1.\nA potentially important area of application of the doubling results in this paper is to kernel interpolation. If K(x,y) for x,y \u2208 D is a given kernel, a kernel approximation of a function f defined on D is an expression of the form\nfn =\nn\u2211\nk=1\nakK(tk, \u00b7),\nwhere t1, . . . , tn is a prescribed set of points in D, and a1, . . . , an \u2208 R. The kernel approximation is a kernel interpolant if fn is required to satisfy\nfn(tj) = f(tj), j = 1, . . . , n.\nWhile many kernels are used in practical applications (Gaussian kernels being perhaps the most popular), of special interest to us is the case in which K(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the reproducing kernel of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H, because in that case, as shown in Section 4, kernel\ninterpolation is equivalent to orthogonal projection with respect to the H norm onto the finite-dimensional subspace defined by\nV := Vt := span{K(t1, \u00b7), . . . ,K(tn, \u00b7)}.\nA theorem for the doubling phenomenon in a general reproducing kernel Hilbert space H is stated and proved in Section 4, see Theorem 2. In Subsection 4.1 we apply the results to recent high-dimensional computations based on kernel interpolation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H [6,7], in an application to parametric partial differential equations. In this application the target function is known to be smooth, and hence lies naturally in a smoother normed space B. It was in fact the observation of faster-than-expected convergence in this application that gave birth to the present project.\nIn Section 5 we obtain equivalent results for general radial basis function interpolation. While some radial basis functions are positive definite, and hence in principle covered already by Section 4, we here consider general conditionally positive definite basis functions. In this case H is the so-called \u201cnative space\u201d, and B is a space of smoother functions introduced by Schaback [9]. Improved convergence results for radial basis function interpolation in the L2 and native space norms are given in Theorem 7. The proof again rests on the fact that radial basis function interpolation is expressible as orthogonal projection in the space H onto a finite-dimensional subspace.\n2 Examples of suitable spaces H,B\nExample 1. Take H to be the space of real, continuous functions on [0, 1] that have squareintegrable first order derivatives. This is a well known Sobolev space, with standard inner product\n\u3008f, g\u3009H :=\n\u222b 1\n0 f(x)g(x) dx+\n\u222b 1\n0 f \u2032(x)g\u2032(x) dx.\nClearly H is continuously embedded in L2(0, 1), since for f \u2208 H we have\n\u2016f\u20162L2 =\n\u222b 1\n0 |f(x)|2 dx \u2264\n\u222b 1\n0 (|f(x)|2 + |f \u2032(x)|2) dx = \u2016f\u20162H .\nNow define B to be a subspace of H for which also the second derivatives are squareintegrable. On integrating by parts, for f \u2208 H and g \u2208 B we obtain\n\u3008f, g\u3009H :=\n\u222b 1\n0 f(x)g(x) dx+ f(1)g\u2032(1)\u2212 f(0)g\u2032(0)\u2212\n\u222b 1\n0 f(x)g\u2032\u2032(x) dx,\nwhich with the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality implies\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g\u2016L2 + |f(1)||g \u2032(1)| + |f(0)||g\u2032(0)| + \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g \u2032\u2032\u2016L2 .\nFor (2) to be satisfied the two central terms must vanish, since f(0) and f(1) are not bounded functionals in L2(0, 1), thus we must define B to be the subspace of the Sobolev space of order 2 for which g\u2032(1) = g\u2032(0) = 0. We then have\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2 ( \u2016g\u2016L2 + \u2016g \u2032\u2032\u2016L2 ) \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2 ( 2(\u2016g\u20162L2 + \u2016g \u2032\u2032\u20162L2) )1/2 ,\nthus (2) is satisfied if the norm in B is defined by\n\u2016g\u20162B := 2 ( \u2016g\u20162L2 + \u2016g \u2032\u20162L2 + \u2016g \u2032\u2032\u20162L2 ) .\nClearly B is continuously embedded in H, since\n\u2016g\u20162H = \u2016g\u2016 2 L2 + \u2016g \u2032\u20162L2 \u2264 1 2\u2016g\u2016 2 B for all g \u2208 B.\nExample 2. The next example shows that some care may be required in defining the subspace B. We take H to be the same space as in the first example. Then another possible inner product is\n\u3008f, g\u3009H := f(0)g(0) +\n\u222b 1\n0 f \u2032(x)g\u2032(x) dx. (3)\nAssuming that g has square-integrable derivatives, we may integrate by parts to obtain\n\u3008f, g\u3009H := f(0)g(0) + f(1)g \u2032(1)\u2212 f(0)g\u2032(0) \u2212\n\u222b 1\n0 f(x)g\u2032\u2032(x) dx.\nEquation (2) is then clearly satisfied if we define B \u2282 H by\nB = {g \u2208 H : g\u2032\u2032 \u2208 L2(0, 1) and g(0) = g \u2032(0) = g\u2032(1) = 0}, (4)\nand take \u2016g\u2016B := \u2016g \u2032\u2032\u2016L2 , which again is easily seen to be a norm in B.\nWe demonstrate in Section 4 that H is continuously embedded in L2(0, 1) and likewise that B is continuously embedded in H.\nExample 3. Take H to be the space of real, continuous functions on [0, 1] which have square-integrable first order derivatives and which are periodic in the sense that f(0) = f(1) for f \u2208 H. This is a Hilbert space with inner product\n\u3008f, g\u3009H :=\n(\u222b 1\n0 f(x) dx\n)(\u222b 1\n0 g(x) dx\n) + \u222b 1\n0 f \u2032(x)g\u2032(x) dx.\nBy the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Wirtinger inequality [3, Chapter 5.8.1], there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225f \u2212 \u222b 1\n0 f(x) dx\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\nL2\n\u2264 C21\u2016f \u2032\u20162L2 for all f \u2208 H,\nwhich yields that \u2016f\u20162L2 \u2264 ( \u222b 1 0 f(x) dx )2 + C21\u2016f \u2032\u20162L2 \u2264 max(1, C1)\n2\u2016f\u20162H for all f \u2208 H. Therefore H is continuously embedded in L2(0, 1).\nNow define B to be a subspace of H, one in which the second derivatives are squareintegrable, and for which the first derivatives at 0 and 1 are equal. On integrating by parts, and using the periodicity, we obtain\n\u3008f, g\u3009H :=\n(\u222b 1\n0 f(x) dx\n)(\u222b 1\n0 g(x) dx\n) \u2212 \u222b 1\n0 f(x)g\u2032\u2032(x) dx\n=\n\u222b 1\n0 f(x)\n(\u222b 1\n0 g(y) dy \u2212 g\u2032\u2032(x)\n) dx,\nimplying with the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\n(\u222b 1\n0\n(\u222b 1\n0 g(y) dy \u2212 g\u2032\u2032(x)\n)2 dx\n)1/2\n= \u2016f\u2016L2\n((\u222b 1\n0 g(y) dy\n)2 + \u222b 1\n0 |g\u2032\u2032(x)|2 dx\n)1/2 ,\nwhere in the last step we used the fact that \u222b 1 0 g\n\u2032\u2032(x) dx = g\u2032(1) \u2212 g\u2032(0) = 0. The last equation conforms with (2) if the last factor is used to define the norm \u2016g\u2016B :=(( \u222b 1\n0 g(x) dx )2 + \u222b 1 0 |g \u2032\u2032(x)|2 dx )1/2\nin B. To see that B is continuously embedded in H, a second application of the Poincar\u00e9\u2013\nWirtinger inequality leads us to deduce that there exists a constant C2 > 0 such that\n\u2016g\u2032\u20162L2 = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225g \u2032 \u2212 \u222b 1\n0 g\u2032(x) dx\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\nL2\n\u2264 C22\u2016g \u2032\u2032\u20162L2 for all g \u2208 B,\nsince \u222b 1 0 g\n\u2032(x) dx = g(1)\u2212 g(0) = 0. This immediately yields that \u2016g\u2016H \u2264 max(1, C2)\u2016g\u2016B for all g \u2208 B, as desired.\nExample 4. Let D \u2282 Rd, d \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, be a nonempty, bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. We check the relation (2) for the Sobolev spaces H = H10 (D) and B = H\n2(D)\u2229 H10 (D), which are natural Hilbert spaces to analyse variational solutions to elliptic partial differential equations of the form\n{ \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (a(x)\u2207u(x)) = z(x) for x \u2208 D,\nu|\u2202D = 0,\nwhere the functions a, z : D \u2192 R are called the diffusion coefficient and source term, respectively. Standard elliptic regularity theory states that if the domain D is convex, the diffusion coefficient a is Lipschitz continuous, and the source term z \u2208 L2(D), then the solution u belongs to B.\nWe can define \u3008f, g\u3009H := \u3008f, g\u3009L2(D) + \u3008\u2207f,\u2207g\u3009L2(D) for f, g \u2208 H so that\n\u2016f\u2016L2(D) \u2264 \u2016f\u2016H for all f \u2208 H,\nwhich implies the continuous embedding of H in L2(D).

We note that this is not a Hilbert space norm, serving as a reminder that the requirement on B is that it be a normed vector space continuously embedded in H, not necessarily a Hilbert space.\nIt follows from the Poincar\u00e9 inequality that there exists a constant C > 0 depending on the domain D such that\n\u2016f\u2016L2(D) \u2264 C\u2016\u2207f\u2016L2(D) for all f \u2208 H.\nLetting g \u2208 B, we obtain by Green\u2019s first identity that\n\u2016\u2207g\u20162L2(D) = \u2212\n\u222b\nD g(x)\u2206g(x) dx\n\u2264 \u2016g\u2016L2(D)\u2016\u2206g\u2016L2(D)\n\u2264 C\u2016\u2207g\u2016L2(D)\u2016\u2206g\u2016L2(D).\nThis yields \u2016\u2207g\u2016L2(D) \u2264 C\u2016\u2206g\u2016L2(D) and thus \u2016g\u2016H \u2264 (1 + C 2)1/2\u2016g\u2016B for all g \u2208 B.

            "text": "In this section we take H to be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of real-valued functions defined on a domain D. We show that the general theorem, Theorem 1, has direct application to interpolation with respect to a finite set of reproducing kernels.\nA reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a Hilbert space in which point evaluation is bounded. By the Riesz representation theorem, for every RKHS there exists a kernel K(\u00b7, \u00b7), with the properties\nK(y, \u00b7) \u2208 H for all y \u2208 D, (8)\nand \u3008K(y, \u00b7), f\u3009H = f(y) for all f \u2208 H and y \u2208 D, (9)\nthe latter being the reproducing property. It is easily seen, using\nK(y,x) = \u3008K(y, \u00b7),K(x, \u00b7)\u3009H ,\nthat the reproducing kernel is symmetric,\nK(y,x) = K(x,y) for all y,x \u2208 D.\nThe kernel is unique (but not necessarily known). The reproducing kernel is positive definite, in the sense that\nN\u2211\nj=1\nN\u2211\nk=1\nbjK(tj , tk)bk \u2265 0 (10)\nfor all N \u2208 N, all choices of points tj and all real bj, j = 1, . . . , N , with equality if and only if all bj vanish. The reverse is also true, that to every positive definite kernel there is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H. For further information about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, see [1] or the more recent source [11, Chapter 10].\nExample 2 continued. Recall that H is the space of continuous real-valued functions f defined on [0, 1] whose first derivatives are square-integrable, and that the inner product in H is given by (3). It can easily be seen using that inner product that the kernel\nK(x, y) := 1 + min(x, y)\nsatisfies both (8) and (9) for all f \u2208 H, and that K(x, y) is therefore the reproducing kernel of H.\nWe can now show that H is continuously embedded in L2(0, 1) and that B defined by (4) is continuously embedded in H. By using the reproducing property f(x) = \u3008f,K(\u00b7, x)\u3009H for all f \u2208 H and x \u2208 [0, 1], we obtain\n\u2016f\u20162L2 =\n\u222b 1\n0 |f(x)|2 dx =\n\u222b 1\n0 \u3008f,K(\u00b7, x)\u30092H dx \u2264\n\u222b 1\n0 \u2016f\u20162H\u2016K(x, \u00b7)\u2016 2 H dx\n= \u2016f\u20162H\n\u222b 1\n0 K(x, x) dx \u2264\n3 2 \u2016f\u20162H for all f \u2208 H, (11)\nwhich means that H is continuously embedded in L2(0, 1). Let g \u2208 B. To show the continuous embedding of B in H, we integrate by parts and use (4) to obtain\n\u2016g\u20162H = g(0) 2 +\n\u222b 1\n0 |g\u2032(x)|2 dx\n= g(1)g\u2032(1)\u2212 g(0)g\u2032(0)\u2212\n\u222b 1\n0 g(x)g\u2032\u2032(x) dx\n\u2264 \u2016g\u2016L2\u2016g \u2032\u2032\u2016L2 \u2264\n\u221a 3\n2 \u2016g\u2016H\u2016g\u2016B ,\nwhere the final step follows from (11). Therefore \u2016g\u2016H \u2264 \u221a 3 2\u2016g\u2016B , showing the continuous embedding of B in H. For the general case, a kernel interpolant of a function f \u2208 H is an approximation of the form\nfn(y) := n\u2211\nk=1\nakK(tk,y), (12)\nwhere t1, . . . , tn are distinct points in D, and the coefficients ak are determined by the interpolation condition\nfn(tk) = f(tk), k = 1, . . . , n. (13)\nThe linear system necessarily has a unique solution (ak) n k=1, because of the positive definite property (10) of the reproducing kernel. Kernel methods have a long history, tracing back to Grace Wahba\u2019s seminal work on splines [10]. They have an important role in radial basis functions see [11], and have recently been used in high dimensional approximation, see for example [4, 6, 7, 12, 13].\nThe kernel interpolant fits the scenario of the Introduction and Theorem 1 as long as there exists a suitable subspace B \u2282 H such that (2) is satisfied. The first step is to define\nV := span{K(t1, \u00b7),K(t2, \u00b7), . . . ,K(tn, \u00b7)},\nwhich by property (8) is a finite-dimensional subspace of H. The crucial point is the observation that, for H a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the kernel interpolant fn is the H-orthogonal projection of f on V \u2282 H. This is an immediate consequence of the reproducing property (9) together with the interpolation condition (13), because for all f \u2208 H we have\n\u3008f \u2212 fn,K(tk, \u00b7)\u3009H = f(tk)\u2212 fn(tk) = 0,\nfrom which it follows that f \u2212 fn is H-orthogonal to every element of V . The following proposition thus is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.\nTheorem 2. Let H be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space continuously embedded in L2(D) and with kernel K, and let B be a normed space continuously embedded in H such that (2) holds. For t1, . . . , tn a set of distinct points in D, let fn be the kernel interpolant defined by (12) and (13) . Assume that for some c > 0 and some \u03ba > 0 we have\n\u2016f \u2212 fn\u2016L2(D) \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016f\u2016H for all f \u2208 H.\nThen for all g in B \u2282 H, with kernel interpolant gn using the same points t1, . . . , tn, we have\n\u2016g \u2212 gn\u2016L2(D) \u2264 c 2n\u22122\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B ,\nand\n\u2016g \u2212 gn\u2016H \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B ."

            "text": "In recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of kernel interpolation in challenging large-scale computations. In particular, in the papers [6,7] kernel interpolation was used for the solution of a parametric partial differential equation with a very large number of parameters \u2013 in the first paper detailed calculations were carried out with 10 and 100 independent parameters, while in the second paper the number of parameters was extended to 1,000.\nOur purpose in this subsection is not to review the substance of those papers, but rather to present the high-dimensional setting encountered there, and to identify (in the notation of the present paper) the function spaces H and B, along with the reproducing kernel K of H. We will be then be able to see that Theorem 2 applies directly to the computations in those papers, and hence be able to explain the higher than expected rates of convergence reported there.\nIn the papers [6, 7] the space D in which the parameters lie is [0, 1]d, with d typically large. The function space H is a Sobolev space of dominating mixed smoothness \u03b1 \u2208 N.\nIt is a space of periodic functions (that is, each function in H is 1-periodic with respect to each component of the argument), which is a natural high-dimensional generalisation of Example 3 in Section 2. However, it proves to be simpler to use a Fourier representation to describe the space and its norm.\nSpecifically, for arbitrary \u03b1 > 1/2 we define f to be in the space H := H\u03b1,\u03b3 if\n\u2016f\u20162\u03b1,\u03b3 := \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\nr\u03b1,\u03b3(h)|f\u0302(h)| 2 < \u221e, (14)\nwhere\nf\u0302(h) :=\n\u222b\n[0,1]d f(y)e\u22122\u03c0ih\u00b7y dy,\nand where for h \u2208 Zd\nr\u03b1,\u03b3(h) := 1\n\u03b3supp(h)\n\u220f\nj\u2208supp(h)\n|hj | 2\u03b1, (15)\nwith supp(h) := {j \u2208 {1, . . . , d} : hj 6= 0}. The inner product in H is\n\u3008f, g\u3009\u03b1,\u03b3 := \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\nr\u03b1,\u03b3(h)f\u0302(h)g\u0302(h) < \u221e. (16)\n(To avoid confusion we note that the present definition of the parameter \u03b1 follows [7], not [6]. The two definitions differ by a factor of 2.)\nThe above definition of the norm in H incorporates \u201cweights\u201d \u03b3u, which are prescribed positive numbers, one for each subset u \u2286 {1, . . . , d}. It is by now well known that if the weights are omitted (that is, by setting each \u03b3u equal to 1), then most problems become \u201cintractable\u201d as d \u2192 \u221e. In the paper [6] much effort is devoted to choosing weights that ensure that the interpolation error is bounded as d \u2192 \u221e, but that topic is outside the scope of this paper. For the present purposes we can assume that the weights are all given.\nIt is easily seen (by verifying the properties (8) and (9)) that H is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with reproducing kernel\nK(y,x) = \u2211\nu\u2286{1,...,d}\n\u03b3u \u220f\nk\u2208u\n\u03b7\u03b1(yk, xk) = \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\ne2\u03c0ih\u00b7(y\u2212x)\nr\u03b1,\u03b3(h) ,\nwhere\n\u03b7\u03b1(y, x) := \u2211\nh 6=0\ne2\u03c0ih(y\u2212x)\n|h|2\u03b1 ,\nwhich can be expressed explicitly as a multiple of B2\u03b1({y \u2212 x}), where B\u03c4 denotes the Bernoulli polynomial of degree \u03c4 , and the braces indicate taking the fractional part of the argument.\nTo apply Theorem 2 it remains to identify a suitable embedded subset B \u2282 H. The following proposition tells us that we may take B := H2\u03b1,\u03b32 which is a weighted Hilbert space of dominating mixed smoothness of order 2\u03b1, so having twice the smoothness parameter of H, and with each weight \u03b3u replaced by its square.\nProposition 3. With H\u03b1,\u03b3 defined as above, there holds\n|\u3008f, g\u3009\u03b1,\u03b3 | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g\u20162\u03b1,\u03b32 for all f \u2208 H\u03b1,\u03b3 , g \u2208 H2\u03b1,\u03b32 ,\nwhere the inner product and norm are defined by (16) and (14), and \u03b32 := (\u03b32 u ) u\u2286{1,...,d}.\nProof. From (16) and the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality we have\n|\u3008f, g\u3009\u03b1,\u03b3 | = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\nf\u0302(h)g\u0302(h) r\u03b1,\u03b3(h) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264\n \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\n|f\u0302(h)|2\n  1/2 \u2211\nh\u2208Zd\n|g\u0302(h)|2r\u03b1,\u03b3(h) 2\n  1/2\n= ||f ||L2 ||g||2\u03b1,\u03b32 ,\nwhere we used r\u03b1,\u03b3(h) 2 = r2\u03b1,\u03b32(h), which follows immediately from (15).\nThe following corollary now follows from the proposition above and Theorem 2 with H replaced by H\u03b1,\u03b3 and B replaced by H2\u03b1,\u03b32 . It is stated in a form that shows directly the doubling of the convergence rate.\nCorollary 4. For given \u03b1 > 0, let H\u03b1,\u03b3 be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space constructed as above. With K\u03b1,\u03b3 denoting the corresponding reproducing kernel, let f\u03b1,\u03b3,n be the kernel interpolant for this kernel that satisfies (12) and (13). Assume that for some c > 0 and some \u03ba > 0 we have\n\u2016f \u2212 f\u03b1,\u03b3,n\u2016L2 \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016f\u2016\u03b1,\u03b3 for all f \u2208 H\u03b1,\u03b3 . (17)\nThen for all g \u2208 H2\u03b1,\u03b32 \u2282 H\u03b1,\u03b3 we have\n\u2016g \u2212 g\u03b1,\u03b3,n\u2016L2 \u2264 c 2n\u22122\u03ba\u2016g\u20162\u03b1,\u03b32 ,\nand\n\u2016g \u2212 g\u03b1,\u03b3,n\u2016\u03b1,\u03b3 \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016g\u20162\u03b1,\u03b32 .\nA final comment is that in the papers [6, 7] the hypothesis (17) was established with \u03ba = 12\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 for arbitrary \u03b4 > 0, a result known (because of the restricted nature of the interpolation points used there) to be not improvable for general f \u2208 H\u03b1,\u03b3 . Since the target function f in those papers is known to be infinitely differentiable, and hence lying in H2\u03b1,\u03b32 , the results in those papers can now be supplemented by the conclusions of this corollary. In particular, the asymptotic rate of convergence in the L2 norm is now proven to be (at least) n\u2212\u03b1 rather than merely n\u2212\u03b1/2, while the asymptotic convergence rate in the H\u03b1,\u03b3 norm (for which no previous estimate was available) is now known to be n\n\u2212\u03b1/2. We note that Corollary 4 also gives values for the \u201cconstants\u201d in the new bounds. Those constants may be very large, and in the context of [6, 7] may also depend strongly on d through the appearance of the H2\u03b1,\u03b32 norm."

            "text": "Radial basis functions provide an important and well studied method for approximating a continuous function given its values at scattered data points, see [11]. Our aim here is not to provide a guide to radial basis functions, but rather to demonstrate how the general Theorem 1 can be extended to radial basis function interpolation. In general we follow the conventions of the monograph [11].\nDefinition 5. A real, even, continuous function \u03a6 : Rd \u2192 R is said to be conditionally semi-positive definite of order m \u2265 0 if for all n \u2208 N and all choices of points t1, . . . , tn \u2208 R d we have n\u2211\nk=1\nn\u2211\nj=1\nak\u03a6(tk \u2212 tj)aj \u2265 0 (18)\nfor all a = (a1, . . . , an) \u2208 R n that satisfy\nn\u2211\nk=1\nakp(tk) = 0 for all polynomials p of degree less than m. (19)\nIt is said to be conditionally positive definite of order m if equality in (18) holds only for a = 0. We note that the condition (19) becomes increasingly restrictive on the coefficients ak as m increases.\nWe will assume that the order m in the definition takes its smallest possible value.\nExample 5. The thin-plate spline \u03a6(y) := \u2016y\u20162\u21132 log \u2016y\u2016\u21132 is conditionally positive definite of order 2.\nIn the special case m = 0 the condition (19) is vacuous, and a conditionally positive definite function \u03a6 yields a kernel \u03a6(y,x) := \u03a6(y\u2212x) that is positive definite in the sense of (10). Some important radial basis functions are known to be the conditionally positive definite of order m = 0. These include Gaussians, inverse multiquadrics and Wendland\u2019s compactly supported radial basis functions [11]. Here, however, we shall concentrate on the general case of order m \u2265 0.\nWhile all of the basis functions used in practice are radial, in the sense of depending, like the thin plate spline, on the \u21132 norm of the argument, we shall not make any such assumption in this section, though in line with convention we shall continue to speak of radial basis functions, or RBFs.\nWe now suppose that a continuous function f is defined on a bounded domain \u2126 \u2282 R d with Lipschitz boundary. We assume that f has known values at n distinct points t1, . . . , tn \u2208 \u2126, which we wish to interpolate using the conditional positive definite \u03a6 of order m \u2265 0.\nThere is an essential condition on the interpolation point set, namely that it be \u03a0m\u22121 unisolvent. Here \u03a0m\u22121 denotes the set of polynomials on R\nd of degree less than or equal to m\u2212 1, and \u03a0m\u22121 unisolvency means that the only polynomial of degree less than m that vanishes at all the points t1, . . . , tn is the zero function. If m = 0 the set \u03a0m\u22121 is empty, and the unisolvency condition is not needed.\nThe radial basis function interpolant of f using the point set t has the form\nsf,t(y) = ft(y) + pt(y), (20)\nwhere, with the notation \u03a6(x,y) := \u03a6(x\u2212 y),\nft(y) = n\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk,y), (21)\nwith a = (a1, . . . , an) \u2208 R n constrained by (19), and pt \u2208 \u03a0m\u22121. The function sf,t, and its components ft and pt, are then uniquely determined by the interpolation condition\nsf,t(tk) = f(tk) for k = 1, . . . , n,\nwith the uniqueness following from the fact that\nn\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, \u00b7) + pt(\u00b7) = 0 (22)\nimplies n\u2211\nj=1\nn\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, tj)aj + n\u2211\nj=1\najpt(tj) = 0,\nin which the last term vanishes by (19), and hence\nn\u2211\nj=1\nn\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, tj)aj = 0,\nwhich in turn implies a1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = an = 0, after which (22) yields pt = 0 and hence sf,t = 0. With that foundation, we now turn to defining H and B for RBF interpolation. We first define the linear space generated by all functions of the form (21),\nF\u03a6 :=\n{ n\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, \u00b7) : t1, . . . , tn \u2208 \u2126, a \u2208 R n satisfying (19), and n \u2208 N } .\nAn inner product on F\u03a6 can be defined by\n\u3008ft, gu\u3009F\u03a6 := n\u2211\nk=1\n\u2113\u2211\nj=1\nak\u03a6(tk,uj)bj , (23)\nwhere n, \u2113 \u2208 Z,\nft =\nn\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, \u00b7), gu = \u2113\u2211\nj=1\nbj\u03a6(uj, \u00b7), t1, . . . , tn,u1, . . . ,u\u2113 \u2208 \u2126,\nwith both a and b satisfying (19). That this is an inner product follows from the conditional positive definiteness of order m of the function \u03a6. To accommodate our polynomial interpolant sf,t, the space F\u03a6 clearly needs to be augmented by the polynomial space \u03a0m\u22121. To facilitate working with polynomials, following [11, Chapter 10], letting Q := dim\u03a0m\u22121 be the dimension of \u03a0m\u22121 , we now choose a fixed \u03a0m\u22121-unisolvent point set \u03be1, . . . , \u03beQ \u2208 \u2126. With respect to this point set let {p1, . . . , pQ} be the Lagrange basis for \u03a0m\u22121, so that pi(\u03bej) = \u03b4i,j , allowing every polynomial in \u03a0m\u22121 to be written uniquely as\np =\nQ\u2211\ni=1\np(\u03bei)pi.\nAn inner product in the space F\u03a6 +\u03a0m\u22121 is\n\u3008f, g\u3009F\u03a6+\u03a0m\u22121 = \u3008ft + p, gu + q\u3009F\u03a6+\u03a0m\u22121\n:=\nn\u2211\nk=1\n\u2113\u2211\nj=1\nakK\u03a6(tk,uj)bj + 1\nQ\nQ\u2211\ni=1\nf(\u03bei)g(\u03bei), (24)\nwhere p, q \u2208 \u03a0m\u22121 and\nK\u03a6(x,y) := \u03a6(x,y)\u2212\nQ\u2211\ni=1\npi(x)\u03a6(\u03bei,y)\u2212\nQ\u2211\ni\u2032=1\npi\u2032(y)\u03a6(x, \u03bei\u2032)\n+\nQ\u2211\ni=1\nQ\u2211\ni\u2032=1\npi(x)pi\u2032(y)\u03a6(\u03bei, \u03bei\u2032).\nTo prove the positivity of this bilinear form, note that \u2016f\u20162F\u03a6+\u03a0m\u22121 = 0 implies both f(\u03bei) = 0, i = 1, . . . , Q, and\nn\u2211\nk=1\nn\u2211\nj=1\nakaj ( \u03a6(tk, tj)\u2212 Q\u2211\ni=1\npi(tk)\u03a6(\u03bei, tj)\u2212\nQ\u2211\ni\u2032=1\npi\u2032(tj)\u03a6(tk, \u03bei\u2032)\n+\nQ\u2211\ni=1\nQ\u2211\ni\u2032=1\npi(tk)pi\u2032(tj)\u03a6(\u03bei, \u03bei\u2032)\n) = 0.\nOn changing the order of summation and using (19), all terms except the first vanish, allowing us to conclude from the conditional positive definiteness of \u03a6 that a1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = an = 0, and hence f = p. Since p now vanishes at all points \u03be1, . . . , \u03beQ, we have finally f = 0, so proving positivity.\nWe now denote by F\u03a6 the closure of F\u03a6 with respect to the inner product (23), and N\u03c6 the closure of F\u03c6 +\u03a0m\u22121 with respect to (24), so that\nN\u03a6 = F\u03a6 +\u03a0m\u22121.\nThe space N\u03a6 is called the \u201cnative space\u201d associated with the conditionally positive definite basis function \u03a6. The native space N\u03a6 will be our Hilbert space H in the sense of Theorem 1.\nIt is known (see [11, Theorem 10.24]) that N\u03a6 is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with reproducing kernel\nK(x,y) := K\u03a6(x,y) +\nQ\u2211\nk=1\nf(\u03bek)g(\u03bek).\nIt is easy to verify that K(x, \u00b7) belongs to the finite dimensional space F\u03a6 + \u03a0m\u22121, and then that the reproducing property (9) holds for functions in that space, after which it extends to the native space by taking a limit.\nMoreover, it is readily seen that the kernel interpolant fn for the kernel K satisfies exactly the defining properties (19), (20) and (21) assumed for the RBF interpolant sf,t. Since the interpolant is unique, it follows that sf,t = fn is the kernel interpolant in the sense of Section 4.\nWe now define a finite dimensional subspace of N\u03a6 in which the RBF interpolant sf,t lies,\nVt :=\n{ n\u2211\nk=1\nak\u03a6(tk, \u00b7) + p : p \u2208 \u03a0m\u22121, a \u2208 R n and satisfying (19) , n \u2208 N } . (25)\nFrom the reproducing property (9) we have\n\u3008f \u2212 sf,t,K(tk, \u00b7)\u3009N\u03a6 = f(tk)\u2212 sf,t(tk) = 0. (26)\nSince {K(t1, \u00b7), . . . ,K(tn, \u00b7)} is a basis for Vt, this proves that sf,t is the N\u03a6 orthogonal projection of f \u2208 N\u03a6 on Vt.\nWendland [11, Theorems 10.20 and 10.21] shows that the inner product in N\u03a6 can be written explicitly (under conditions satisfied by all the usual basis functions \u03a6) as\n\u3008f, g\u3009N\u03a6 := (2\u03c0) \u2212d/2\n\u222b\nRd\nf\u0302(\u03c9)g\u0302(\u03c9)\n\u03a6\u0302(\u03c9) d\u03c9 +\n1\nQ\nQ\u2211\nk=1\nf(\u03bek)g(\u03bek), (27)\nwhere \u0302 denotes the so-called generalized Fourier transform of order m, see [11, pg. 103]. A crucial fact, generalizing Bochner\u2019s characterisation of positive semidefinite functions as\nthose with non-negative Fourier transforms, is that \u03a6\u0302 is non-negative and non-vanishing for \u03a6 a slowly increasing continuous and even, positive definite function of order m \u2265 0, see [11, Theorem 8.12].\nA useful fact is that the generalized Fourier transform of order m of a polynomial in \u03a0m\u22121 vanishes, see [11, Proposition 8.10], thus f and g in the first term of (27) may without change have arbitrary polynomials in \u03a0m\u22121 added.\nThere are two subtleties in the definition (27). The first is that the appearance of (generalized) Fourier transform of f implicitly requires that f be defined on the whole of Rd. Functions in F\u03a6 have an obvious extension from \u2126 to R\nd, and therefore so do functions in N\u03a6. The subtle point is that the target function f must also be assumed to have a suitably smooth extension from \u2126 to the whole of Rd, which may not be a reasonable assumption in practice.\nA second subtlety is that the space N\u03a6 with inner product (27) is not embedded in L2(\u2126) because f(\u03bei) (like any point evaluation) is not a bounded functional in L2(\u2126). To overcome this technical difficulty we will where necessary below replace the usual L2 norm by the larger norm\n\u2016f\u2016L2(\u2126) :=\n(\u222b\n\u2126 |f(x)|2 dx+\n1\nQ\nQ\u2211\ni=1\n|f(\u03bei)| 2\n)1/2 . (28)\nWe now take H = N\u03a6, which we may safely assume satisfies \u2016f\u2016L2(\u2126) \u2264 \u2016f\u2016H . Finally, we come to define B: we take B = N\u03a6\u2217\u03a6 to be the Hilbert space for which\n\u2016f\u20162N\u03a6\u2217\u03a6 := (2\u03c0) \u2212d/2\n\u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9\n+ (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2\n\u03a6\u0302(\u03c9)2 d\u03c9 +\nQ\u2211\nk=1\n|f(\u03bek)| 2 < \u221e. (29)\nWe note that the semi-norm in the second term of (29) with its squared denominator seems to have appeared first in Schaback\u2019s rate doubling argument [9]. We follow here his notation.\nThat B = N\u03a6\u2217\u03a6 is embedded in H = N\u03a6 follows from\n(2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2\n\u03a6\u0302(\u03c9) d\u03c9\n\u2264 ( (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9 )1/2( (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2\n\u03a6\u0302(\u03c9)2 d\u03c9\n)1/2\n\u2264 \u2016f\u2016B\u2016f\u2016B = \u2016f\u2016 2 B .\nThe following proposition will allow us to apply results analogous to Theorem 1 to radial basis function interpolation.\nProposition 6. Let \u03a6 be a real, even, continuous and conditionally positive definite function of order m \u2265 0 defined on Rd. With H = N\u03a6 and B defined as above we have\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g\u2016B for all f \u2208 H, g \u2208 B.\nProof. From (27) and repeated Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequalities we obtain\n|\u3008f, g\u3009H | := \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223(2\u03c0) \u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\nf\u0302(\u03c9)g\u0302(\u03c9)\n\u03a6\u0302(\u03c9) d\u03c9 +\n1\nQ\nQ\u2211\ni=1\nf(\u03bei)g(\u03bei) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264 ( (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|f\u0302(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9 )1/2( (2\u03c0)\u2212d/2 \u222b\nRd\n|g\u0302(\u03c9)|2 \u03a6\u0302(\u03c9) 2 d\u03c9\n)1/2\n+\n( 1\nQ\nQ\u2211\ni=1\n|f(\u03bei)| 2\n)1/2( 1\nQ\nQ\u2211\ni=1\n|g(\u03bei)| 2 )1/2 \u2264 \u2016f\u2016L2\u2016g\u2016H .\nNow we can state the following extension of Theorem 1.\nTheorem 7. Let \u03a6 be a real, even, continuous and conditionally positive definite function of order m defined on Rd and let \u2126 be a bounded domain in Rd with Lipschitz boundary. Let t := {t1, . . . , tn} be a \u03a0m\u22121-unisolvent and distinct set of points in \u2126, and let \u03be := {\u03be1, . . . , \u03beQ} be a \u03a0m\u22121-unisolvent subset of t. Let H be the native space N\u03a6 with inner product (27), and let B be the subspace of H with norm (29). Finally, let sf,t \u2208 H be the radial basis function interpolant of f defined by (20), (21) and (19). Assume that for some c > 0 and some \u03ba > 0 we have\n\u2016f \u2212 sf,t\u2016L2 \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016f\u2016H for all f \u2208 H. (30)\nThen for all g \u2208 B \u2282 H we have\n\u2016g \u2212 sg,t\u2016L2 \u2264 c 2n\u22122\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B ,\nand\n\u2016g \u2212 sg,t\u2016H \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016g\u2016B .\nProof. Because f\u2212sf,t vanishes on the point set \u03be (remembering that \u03be = (\u03be1, . . . , \u03beQ) is a subset of the interpolation point set t), the hypothesis (30) in the theorem can be replaced by\n\u2016f \u2212 sf,t\u2016L2(\u2126) \u2264 cn \u2212\u03ba\u2016f\u2016H for all f \u2208 H,\nwhere the L2 norm is defined by (28). Now we use the analogue of Theorem 1 with L2 replaced by L2. That theorem is directly applicable here because, as shown in (26), sf,t is the N\u03a6-orthogonal projection onto the finite dimensional subspace Vt defined by (25). Thus the conclusion of that theorem hold with the L2 norm replaced by the L2 norm. But since g \u2212 sg,t also vanishes on the point set \u03be, the results hold with L2 norms, as stated.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge support from the Australian Research Council through grant DP21010083.
