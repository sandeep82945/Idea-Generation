    "abstractText": "Background and Objectives: Extremely hot temperature affects psychological well-being negatively, especially for older adults with lower socioeconomic status (SES). The objectives of this study are to examine: (a) the impact of hot instantaneous temperature on older adults\u2019 emotional well-being and (b) whether meaningful engagement could reduce the above impact, particularly for those of lower SES. Research Design and Methods: We conducted a quantitative time-sampling study during hot-weather months (May\u2013September) in 2021 and 2022. The sample comprises 344 participants aged 60 years or older (Mage = 67.15, SDage = 5.26) living in urban areas of Hong Kong, where hot days (daily maximum temperature \u226533\u00b0C) accounted for 23% of the study days. Participants reported positive and negative affect, and engagement in meaningful activities, three times a day over a 10-day period, and wore sensors that tracked the instantaneous temperature of their immediate environment. Multilevel modeling was employed to examine the impacts on affect from temperature, SES, and meaningful activity engagement. Results: Hotter instantaneous temperature predicted greater momentary negative affect and less positive affect immediately afterwards. Meaningful engagement significantly buffered against the affective impacts of hotter temperature, and this buffering effect was more salient among older adults of lower SES. Discussion and implications: This study highlights the role of meaningful engagement in reducing the impact of hotter instantaneous temperature on older adults\u2019 emotional well-being, particularly for those of lower SES. Meaningful activity engagement may be capitalized on, as a strategy, to reduce climate-related social inequality. Translational Significance: Hot temperatures have been shown to harm older adults\u2019 well-being, particularly those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). We found in Hong Kong\u2014one of the hottest cities with the highest income inequality in the world\u2014that meaningful activity engagement could buffer against the negative impact of hot instantaneous temperature on older adults\u2019 emotional well-being. This buffer worked even better for those with lower SES. Findings suggest that personal agency should not be ignored in fighting hot weather. As meaningful engagement is less resource-dependent, it can complement existing macrolevel strategies (e.g., urban design) to help older adults cope with global warming.",

Increasing occurrences of extremely hot temperatures boost heat-related morbidity and mortality (Desch\u00eanes & Greenstone, 2011; Gasparrini et al., 2015), adversely affecting people\u2019s physical and psychological well-being (Pailler & Tsaneva, 2018). An important contributor to psychological health and life functioning is emotional well-being, characterized by experiencing more positive affect and less negative affect. People with better\nemotional well-being have lower risk of mental and behavioral illnesses (Hansen et al., 2009). For older adults, specifically, better emotional well-being is associated with fewer distress and depressive symptoms, and better physical and mental health (Hu & Gruber, 2008). However, hotter weather is associated with decreased emotional well-being. Evidence was found that people living in hotter regions of the world have lower levels of happiness (Rehdanz & Maddison, 2005), and people show worse daily moods (Denissen et al., 2008) and\nReceived: January 30 2023; Editorial Decision Date: May 26 2023. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

Older adults living in hot and densely populated areas are especially vulnerable to the impacts of extremely hot weather. Tropical and sub-tropical regions experience more heatwaves than the rest of the world (Guo et al., 2018). Urban areas, especially high-density cities, suffer from greater impacts of heat waves because the urban heat island effect aggregates more heat (Li & Bou-Zeid, 2013). In view of these, this study examined the impact of hot instantaneous temperature on the emotional well-being of older adults and what can be done to reduce the impact, in Hong Kong\u2014a high-density urban city in the tropical region that has the world\u2019s highest intracity income inequalities and one of the world\u2019s highest average increases in urban ambient temperature during the past century (United Nations Development Programme, 2022).\nDue to declining physical health and thermoregulatory function, older adults are more susceptible to heat-related symptoms versus younger adults (e.g., heat syncope, heat cramps; Teyton et al., 2022). Research found that increased ambient temperature in Hong Kong from 2000 to 2016 was associated with higher risk of acute psychiatric disorder episodes in adults aged 65 years and older (Qiu et al., 2022). Moreover, temperature can affect older adults\u2019 emotional well-being indirectly by restricting mobility. One study showed that mobility and social engagement were more negatively affected by extreme weather among older than younger adults (Clarke et al., 2015), and this can result in loneliness and diminished emotional well-being in older age. Older adults of lower socioeconomic status (SES) may be even more affected by the temperature changes in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2006 (Chan et al., 2012) as they usually have poor living conditions. Larger family sizes and congested indoor living spaces make it harder to ventilate during hot days (Williams et al., 2019). Due to resource constraints, it is more challenging for lower-SES families to maintain a comfortable household temperature (Bagley et al., 2015). Though evidence was found on a long-term level that older adults, particularly those of lower SES, are at increased risk of negative emotional well-being impacts from extremely hot weather, whether hot instantaneous temperature of their immediate environment will affect their day-to-day well-being is under-researched.\nGiven the well-being risks of hot temperature, investigation of coping methods against hot weather, especially those that are accessible for individuals with age-related and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, is urgently needed. Interventions suggested by previous studies, such as those related to urban construction and building design, have mainly been on the macrolevel (Gronlund et al., 2018). Given that macrolevel interventions take time to be implemented on a large scale, adaptive methods on the personal level are needed to inform what vulnerable people (e.g., older adults of lower SES) can do immediately to maintain high levels of well-being in hot temperature."

            "text": "Benefits We propose that meaningful engagement, or engagement in personally meaningful activities, can buffer against the negative impacts of hot temperature on older adults\u2019 emotional well-being. People who engage in personally meaningful activities have a greater sense of well-being and meaning in life (Eakman et al., 2010; Hooker et al., 2020). For older\nadults, meaningful engagement is a critical component for successful aging as it helps them to maintain or improve their physical, social, and psychological functioning (Carlson et al., 2015; Fried et al., 2004).\nWhy is engaging in meaningful activities so important and beneficial to older adults? The theoretical foundations can be rooted in flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), and socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen et al., 2003). Research on flow theory provides evidence of the beneficial effects of engagement. With intense concentration and full engagement in an activity, one experiences flow. Several studies have shown that a sense of flow positively correlates with psychological resilience (Zubair & Kamal, 2015), psychological well-being (Bryce & Haworth, 2002), and life satisfaction (Peterson et al., 2005).\nMeaning is another crucial factor that determines whether an activity is salutary to personal well-being. SDT suggests that people tend to find meaning in activities that satisfy the basic psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence (Deci & Ryan, 2000). When basic needs are satisfied, people achieve their optimal state of functioning and, therefore, their well-being (Steger et al., 2008). Meaningful activities could be especially important for older adults\u2019 emotional well-being. According to socioemotional selectivity theory , with limited future time, older adults have an increased tendency to pursue emotionally meaningful goals (Carstensen et al., 2003). Research has found that meaningful activities such as productive and prosocial activities are positively associated with older adults\u2019 well-being through fulfilling emotionally meaningful goals (Okun et al., 2013; Vozikaki et al., 2017). In addition, any activity that is personally valued can contribute to a person\u2019s subjective sense of vitality and life satisfaction (Eakman et al., 2010; Hooker et al., 2020).\nVital engagement theory, as an extension of flow theory, emphasizes on the interplay between meaningfulness and engagement (Nakamura & Csikzentmihalyi, 2003). If the process is not enjoyable, the perceived significance of an activity is insufficient to maximize the benefits that it can provide to an individual. Likewise, merely engaging in an activity but not finding it meaningful is insufficient in providing long-term benefit to emotional well-being. Empirical studies have confirmed that for older adults, engaging in any activity is better than nothing (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010), but activities that are personally meaningful are more strongly associated with self-rated health and life satisfaction (Eakman et al., 2010)."

An explanation for this buffering effect could be mental distraction (Hutchinson et al., 2003): When engaging in meaningful activities, individuals focus on what they are doing but not on stressful circumstances, such as difficult weather conditions. Moreover, consistent meaningful engagement contributes to a healthier\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /innovateage/article/7/6/igad057/7202060 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nlifestyle that correlates with higher health-related quality of life among older adults (Eakman et al., 2010), which may in turn equip them with greater resilience to the adverse impacts of hot temperature on emotional well-being.\nWe expect the proposed buffering effect of engaging in meaningful activities on the emotional well-being impact of hot temperature will be stronger in older adults with lower SES. Given the vulnerability of people with lower (vs higher) SES to the adverse effects of extreme weather (Chan et al., 2012), they should have higher coping needs and may hence derive more benefits from coping strategies. Although no previous research identified differing buffering effects of meaningful engagement across different SES contexts, other psychological variables, such as social connections, have shown such differences (Levine, 2017). People with higher SES benefit less from social connections because they are more likely to have enough resources to solve their own problems (Kraus et al., 2012). Similarly, people with higher SES have more resources to deal with hot temperatures, and to maintain their immediate temperature within a comfortable range (e.g., air conditioning). People with lower SES, in contrast, have greater exposure to heat because air conditioning is less affordable for them (Graff Zivin & Neidell, 2014). Hence, the buffering effect of meaningful engagement on the adverse emotional well-being consequences of hot temperature may be more helpful to lower-SES individuals."

At the baseline phase (Day 0), we did an in-home interview asking about participants\u2019 demographic information and introduced the procedure for the subsequent 10-day time-sampling study. From Day 1 to Day 10, participants completed short questionnaires on their current affect, the activities they were engaged in, and their meaningful engagement in these activities three times a day. They were signaled by a smartphone app at random times in the morning, afternoon, and evening, with at least 4\u00a0hr between successive questionnaires. Reminders would signal every 15\u00a0min until the end of the one-hour interval if the participant had not completed a questionnaire. During the 10-day sampling period, participants carried a button sensor with them to detect the instantaneous temperature in their immediate environment. During the exit phase (Day 11), we visited the participants again to retrieve the devices and debrief the participants.\nWith this time-sampling design, we obtained repeated assessments of individuals\u2019 affect over time when they were exposed to various instantaneous temperatures as they carried out their everyday activities during the 10-day period. This enabled us to examine whether the instantaneous temperature of individuals\u2019 immediate environment was associated with their moment-by-moment emotional well-being and whether their momentary meaningful engagement might moderate this association (within-person analysis). We also examined whether these effects were different across different individuals (between-person analysis)."

The main effects of all key variables were statistically significant. Consistent with H1, hotter instantaneous temperature was associated with less positive affect and more negative affect. Consistent with H2, higher meaningful engagement at both levels was associated with more positive affect and less negative affect. This indicates that meaningful engagement was beneficial for momentary emotional well-being, and people with higher levels of meaningful engagement on average tended to have better overall emotional well-being.\nModel 2 tested the 2 two-way interactions between instantaneous temperature and each level of meaningful engagement. For positive affect, both interactions were nonsignificant. For negative affect, there was a significant interaction between between-person meaningful engagement and instantaneous temperature. The effect of instantaneous temperature was nonsignificant among people with higher between-person meaningful engagement (b = 0.01, 95% CI [\u22120.03, 0.07], p = .48), but was significant and positive among people with lower between-person meaningful engagement (b = 0.07, 95% CI [0.03, 0.11], p < .001).

            "text": "This study examined the impacts of hot instantaneous temperature on older adults\u2019 emotional well-being and the buffering effect of meaningful activity engagement in daily life. As expected, hotter instantaneous temperature during the summer months of a densely populated city with a tropical climate was negatively associated with older adults\u2019 emotional well-being (H1). Meaningful engagement at the between-person and within-person levels both contributed to better emotional well-being (H2), but only the former buffered against the adverse impacts of hotter instantaneous temperature (H3). For older adults with low meaningful engagement, hotter instantaneous temperature positively predicted their negative affect. For older adults with high meaningful engagement, the effect of hotter temperature was nonsignificant. We can infer from these results that momentary meaningful activity engagement may be sufficient to boost older adults\u2019 affect at that moment; but in order to foster psychological resilience to hot weather, longer-term meaningful engagement is necessary. As suggested by vital engagement theory, when people engage in something meaningful at the moment, they feel absorbed and intrinsically rewarded, and thus experience increased pleasantness. This may explain why meaningful engagement at both the between-person and within-person levels of our study predicted better emotional well-being. Yet, the theory also postulates that the continuous participation in meaningful and engaging activities is likely to enable individuals to develop interests, expertise, a sense of mastery, and purpose, and, in turn, foster long-term well-being (Nakamura, 2001). It may be this mechanism that allows older adults with higher between-person meaningful engagement in our study to show greater resilience against hot temperature. Our findings echo previous arguments that continued active engagement in life is one crucial criterion for positive aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1997). They are also consistent with previous findings that prolonged engagement in flow-eliciting activities is associated with enhancement of functioning and well-being (e.g., life satisfaction; Landh\u00e4u\u00dfer & Keller, 2012). Our study advances the positive aging literature by highlighting the important role of meaningful activity engagement in enhancing psychological resilience to hot temperatures.\nFurthermore, we found that the buffering effect of meaningful engagement was more prominent among older adults with lower SES (H4).

This indicates that compared to older adults with lower SES, those with higher SES are more able to keep their instantaneous temperature at a lower level during hot days. Given that older adults with higher SES are better able to physically control their instantaneous temperature, or to be in a cooler environment, engaging in meaningful activity as psychological buffer may be less essential to them. Conversely, people with lower SES have fewer resources and options to cool down their instantaneous temperature. Hence, the buffering effect of meaningful engagement may be more salient to them. Additionally, we found that objective SES showed no association with between-person meaningful engagement (r = 0.086, p = .112). This suggests that lower SES is not a barrier to meaningful engagement. This finding contributes to the vital engagement literature by suggesting that meaningful engagement is not the privilege of rich and successful people. Regardless of SES, anyone can find personally meaningful activities to engage in, which could help them cope with the uncomfortable feelings brought by hot temperature. Hence,\nmeaningful engagement may help narrow the gap between older adults with different SES backgrounds in their psychological vulnerability to extremely hot weather.\nHealth is an important contributor to both older adults\u2019 emotional well-being and meaningful engagement (Tierney & Beattie, 2020). Even after controlling for health, the protective effect of between-person meaningful engagement was still significant. Moreover, health did not moderate the negative effects of hot temperature on emotional well-being (see Supplementary Table 3). This indicates that the buffering effect of meaningful engagement is not simply due to people with higher levels of meaningful engagement having better health. Future research should investigate how meaningful engagement provides distinct benefits beyond those of health status, and the mechanisms through which meaningful engagement boosts older people\u2019s psychological well-being. Potential mechanisms, based on socioemotional selectivity theory and self-determination theory, include fostering meaning in life (Eakman, 2013) and meeting basic psychological needs (Kowal & Fortier, 1999).

            "text": "First, this time-sampling study has high ecological validity. By linking momentary psychological responses with real-time objective instantaneous temperature, we were able to detect fluctuations in older adults\u2019 daily affect with temperature and identify older adults with higher resilience or vulnerability to hot temperature. Moreover, this design enabled us to disentangle between- and within-person effects of meaningful engagement. However, we should be cautious when drawing causal conclusions from this design. Although there was a time lag between meaningful engagement and current affect reports (i.e., participants\u2019 meaningful engagement happened before they reported their current affect), there was no experimental control or manipulations. Future studies can manipulate activity meaningfulness to examine potential causal relationships between meaningful engagement and psychological well-being.\nSecond, this study examined the impact of hot weather from a microenvironmental perspective. Previous research examined the relationship between weather and well-being from a macroperspective using population data and district-level weather data (K\u00f6\u00f6ts et al., 2011). However, even for people in the same area (district) sharing the same outdoor temperature, the extent to which they are exposed varies greatly, as people differ in their ability to adjust their environments. On a given day with high outdoor temperature, some people may stay in an air-conditioned room, whereas others may work in a non\u2013air-conditioned environment. People also move around. Hence, in contrast to district temperature, our participants\u2019 instantaneous temperature reflects their microenvironments, which affect their well-being more directly. Hence, this study filled a knowledge gap in this field. Future studies can combine district temperature and participants\u2019 instantaneous temperature to further investigate how people differentially cope with hot temperature.\nThird, this study establishes the negative impacts of hot instantaneous temperature on emotional well-being and the buffering effect of meaningful engagement. Hong Kong suffers from some of the most severe economic inequality and extremely hot temperatures (United Nations Development Programme, 2022). Older adults, especially those with lower SES, are the most vulnerable; hence, it is very important to find feasible psychological strategies for them to deal with hot weather. The present study is the first to find that meaningful engagement, which has previously been shown to contribute to older adults\u2019 well-being (Eakman et al., 2010), is also an effective buffer against the psychological effects of hot temperature. Meaningful engagement is a simple and cost-effective strategy that may help individuals with fewer resources cope with extreme temperatures that are outside their control.\nA limitation of this study is that we only examined buffering effects of meaningful engagement on emotional well-being; whether it could also protect one\u2019s physical well-being from extreme weather remains unknown. Additional analyses found that meaningful engagement was positively associated with self-reported physical health (see Supplementary Table 4). Yet, causal direction cannot be determined. Future studies should adopt physical health-related indicators such as heart\nrate variability to examine whether meaningful engagement may have a tangible impact on physical health.\nTo further investigate the effects of meaningful engagement on psychological well-being, two questions are worth exploring. First, which activities are meaningful and engaging for older adults? Our additional analyses showed that social, physical, and volunteering activities were the three most meaningful and engaging activities reported by older adults (see Supplementary Table 5). Future research can further explore the reasons why these activities are more meaningful than others and whether the perceived meaningfulness of a given activity varies between individuals. A dispositional-situational approach can be used to create personalized meaningful activity inventories tailored to individuals\u2019 dispositions."

Meaningful engagement, over the long term, appears to be a viable strategy for dealing with these extreme temperatures. This strategy is available, and in fact is more effective, for people with fewer resources. Moreover, it can be tailored to suit individuals\u2019 unique ideas of what sorts of activities are personally meaningful. Hence, meaningful engagement can become a practical, cost-effective, flexible, and readily available means of reducing social inequality in well-being amid climate changes."
