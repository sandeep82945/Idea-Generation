Using an accelerating boundary in flat spacetime (moving mirror), we investigate the production of thermal energy flux despite nonequilibrium accelerations, the evolution between equilibrium states, and the \u201cinterference\u201d between horizons. In particular, this allows us to give a complete solution to the particle spectrum of the accelerated boundary correspondence with Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime.\nPACS numbers: 04.70.Dy (Quantum aspects of black holes, evaporation, thermodynamics) Keywords: moving mirrors, black hole evaporation, acceleration radiation, horizons\nI. INTRODUCTION\nParticle creation is a striking phenomenon manifested by quantum field theory in conjunction with gravitation, acceleration, or spacetime horizons. Of particular interest is a thermal spectrum of produced particles, like that associated with Hawking radiation [1], or the DaviesFulling-Unruh effect [2\u20134]. Generally, a thermal particle distribution is expected to be accompanied by a constant energy flux [5]. This characteristic is usually associated with equilibrium, but this is not the full story. For example, constant acceleration produces no energy flux [6\u20138].\nWe analyze several situations within the context of the dynamical Casimir effect. An example of interest is the so-called accelerated boundary correspondence (ABC), where an analogy is established between a curved spacetime and an accelerating boundary (moving mirror). The ABC has been explored for several known solutions, including Schwarzschild [9], Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m [10], and Kerr [11], reducing the complexity of particle creation in higher dimensional curved spacetimes to a simple flat (1+1)-dimensional spacetime (e.g. see the remarkable simplicity afforded in the non-relativistic regime [12]) of an accelerating mirror slicing through the vacuum, even in the case of unitary evolution [13], see also e.g. the Schwarzschild-Planck trajectory [14\u201316]. This approach allows analytic, or numerical, calculation of the energy flux and particle spectrum detected by a distant observer, and under what dynamical conditions the energy flux appears constant.\nThe classic case of an eternally thermal energy flux is the Carlitz-Willey mirror [5, 17], but we investigate how\n\u2217 dfsilvestre@ubu.es \u2020 michael.good@nu.edu.kz \u2021 evlinder@lbl.gov\nthe energy flux and particle spectrum approaches a thermal distribution, especially using a transition between two dynamical states \u2013 whether two asymptotically constant accelerations, two accelerations associated with different temperatures, or a dynamical Casimir effect from motion between two bounding horizons.\nSection II derives how to form a transition from asymptotically constant acceleration to nevertheless produce non-zero energy flux at a constant level. In Section III we solve for the particle spectrum between two thermal states corresponding to different temperatures. Section IV generalizes this to two horizons, i.e. boundaries in the spacetime, and demonstrates the analysis specifically for the ABC with Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, i.e. a black hole embedded in an expanding universe with positive cosmological constant. Analysis of hybrid cases is considered in Section V for connecting null-self-dual (Davies-Fulling) double horizons as well as in Appendix A for connecting thermal states between constant and Carlitz-Willey accelerations. We emphasize the physical implications and insights, and conclude, in Section VI."

First, we see that if w\u0308 = \u03b1\u0307 = 0, then the energy flux is zero. That is, a uniform constant acceleration gives no energy flux.\nThermal particle creation gives a constant energy flux, requiring w\u0308 \u223c w\u22123. Suppose w \u223c tn. Then, the condition for thermal flux F\u0307 (t) = 0 requires either n = 1/2 or n = 1. The n = 1/2 case corresponds to the well known Carlitz-Willey [5] eternal thermal flux, where \u03b1 \u223c t\u22121/2, more familiar in null coordinate v = t + z (as we will\nsee in the next subsection) as \u03b1(v) = \u2212(1/\u03ba) \u221a \u22121/(\u03bav). Since this does not have asymptotically constant acceleration, we postpone this to Section III and turn to n = 1, i.e. w \u223c t hence \u03b1 \u223c const (in agreement with Eq. (5)).\nHowever, \u03b1 = const cannot be all the story, otherwise \u03b1\u0307 = 0 and the energy flux is zero. We must have an approach to constant acceleration, in a particular way, to obtain constant flux produced. From Eq. (5) we see that\n\u03b1\u0307(t) = w\u0308 \u223c w\u22123 \u223c t\u22123 , (6)\nfor n = 1, hence thermal flux is only produced when the acceleration asymptotically approaches constant as\n\u03b1(t) = \u03ba+O ( t\u22122 ) . (7)\nThus, if one wants to connect two constant acceleration asymptotic regimes, and yet obtain non-zero flux plateaus, one must ensure that Eq. (7) is satisfied by the asymptotes.\nRecall that Eq. (5) holds for z\u0307 \u2192 1. What if we change the direction of motion such that z\u0307 \u2192 \u22121? This flips all signs in Eq. (2), and we obtain\n\u2212 12\u03c0F (t) \u2248 \u2212 w\u0308 4w\n(z\u0307 \u2192 \u22121) . (8)\nThe only solution is w \u223c tn with n = 1, and so w\u0308 \u223c t, implying \u03b1 = \u03ba + O(t2). This violates our assumption of asymptotically constant acceleration for asymptotic states t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e (even for t \u2192 0 this implies the celerity w \u2192 0, invalidating the expansion in Eq. (2)).\nThus, a mirror with velocity asymptotically approaching the speed of light, and with acceleration approaching asymptotically constant as 1/t2, can produce a constant flux plateau."

            "text": "If we already have an acceleration that by itself would give eternal thermal flux with temperature T1 = \u03ba1/(2\u03c0), i.e. the Carlitz-Willey (CW) mirror [5], we can also consider a transition that connects it to a thermal flux with a different temperature T2 = \u03ba2/(2\u03c0). This is a warm up (pun intended) for a transition connecting two horizons, in the next section, that differ in their thermal states.\nFor the CW mirror\n\u03b1(v) = \u22121 2 \u221a \u2212\u03ba v . (16)\nIn the time coordinate this gives asymptotic exponential acceleration, \u03b1(t \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) = \u2212(\u03ba/2)e\u00b1\u03bat, but we will remain in the advanced null coordinate v since Eq. (16) holds for all v. The label function f(v) is\nf(v) = \u2212 1 \u03ba ln(\u2212\u03bav) , (17)\nwhich will have a horizon at v = 0. Interestingly, despite the eternal thermal flux there is no past horizon. This ties back to the analysis of the previous section, in that for z\u0307 \u2192 \u22121 the condition w\u0308/w = const of Eq. (8) says the precise form \u03b1 \u223c v\u22121/2 gives constant flux, alternately for z\u0307 \u2192 +1 the condition w3w\u0308 = const of Eq. (5) gives the same form.\nThe explicit form for f(v) in Eq. (17) is quite interesting. It can interpreted as\nf(v) \u223c 1 r ln ([\u2212\u03bav]r) \u223c 1 r\n[ln(\u2212\u03bav) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ ln(\u2212\u03bav)] , (18)\nwhere there are r copies in total. As we will see, we can then displace each copy, as ln[\u2212\u03bai(v\u2212 vi)], to obtain transitions between each thermal plateau.\nThus, to get a transition between two equilibrium temperatures, we can write (as one simple choice)\nf(v) = a1 ln(\u2212\u03ba1v) + a2 ln[\u03ba2(d\u2212 v)] , (19)\nwhere d is some positive constant. We will find that d does not affect the asymptotic temperatures, as the mirror never reaches v = d due to the horizon at v = 0.\nOne could instead shift both coordinates, i.e. use \u2212\u03ba1(v\u2212d1) and \u03ba2(d2\u2212v) to end up with two horizons at v = d1, d2 < 0, with the mirror traversing between the horizons. This will be similar to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case \u2013 we return to this in the next section. Finally, we can string together further copies, e.g. v, d3\u2212v, d4\u2212v, etc. but this will have a limited scope, shifting the coefficients but not the asymptotic thermal states. (This generalizes significantly the setup in [19].)\nReturning to Eq. (19), we find that\nf(v) = \u2212 1 \u03ba2 ln(\u2212\u03ba1v) + \u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03ba1\u03ba2 ln [\u03ba2(d\u2212 v)] . (20)\nThis gives an asymptotic spectrum equivalent to a CW mirror with \u03ba1 as v \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and one with \u03ba2 as v \u2192 0. Of course, for \u03ba1 = \u03ba2 we simply have the standard CW case. This results in the particle spectrum,\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = \u03c9\u2032d2\n2\u03c0\u03ba2\ne \u03c0\u03c9 \u03ba2\ne 2\u03c0\u03c9 \u03ba2 \u2212 1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223U (1\u2212 i\u03c9\u03ba2 , 2\u2212 i\u03c9\u03ba1 , id\u03c9\u2032 )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 ,\n(21) which demonstrates an explicit Planck distribution indicative of the radiative horizon times the modulus of a confluent hypergeometric function. That is, at high frequencies (those seen by a distant observer) \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9, the particle spectrum is Planckian to leading order,\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = 1 2\u03c0\u03ba2\u03c9\u2032 1 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba2 \u2212 1 . (22)\nWe find at low frequencies, \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9, an expected Planck spectrum,\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = 1 2\u03c0\u03ba1\u03c9\u2032 1 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba1 \u2212 1 . (23)\nAs we shall see, the non-equilibrium transition between thermal states is full of new information, as highlighted by the confluent hypergeometric function in Eq. (21). Likewise, spectral variations on the characteristic transition between thermal states will also be present between horizons, as illustrated in the following section.\n4"

(24)\nThis has horizons at v = d1, d2 (where d1 will be related to the past horizon, and d2 to the future horizon) so the mirror motion is restricted to v \u2208 [d1, d2], with dj>2 lying outside this range.\nWhy include these extra factors in the summation? Our solution without them is acceptable, and we get acceleration of the thermal form as we approach each horizon:\n\u03b1(v \u2192 d+1 )\u2192 \u2212 1\n2\n\u221a 1\na1(v \u2212 d1) (25)\n\u03b1(v \u2192 d\u22122 )\u2192 \u2212 1\n2\n\u221a 1\na2(d2 \u2212 v) , (26)\nwhere we take a1 = 1/\u03ba1, a2 = 1/\u03ba2 to get the usual temperature behavior. But, if we consider the accelerated boundary correspondences with general spherically symmetric static spacetimes with metric functions given by\nf(r) = 1 + n\u2211 k=m ckr k , (27)\nthen the horizons of these spacetimes (and hence the horizons of the mirror trajectory) are determined by a degree N = max[n \u2212m,n] polynomial. (This is easily generalized to non-integer powers by redefining variables.)\nThe simplest two-horizon situation is the de Sitter case,\nf(r) = 1\u2212 \u039b 3 r2 , (28)\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant. Then, we have one term, with m = n = 2, and the horizons are determined by an order N = 2 polynomial. This particular case is detailed in [20].\nAn interesting situation is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case,\nf(r) = 1\u2212 2M r \u2212 \u039b 3 r2 , (29)\nwhere M is the black hole mass. Then, we have two terms, with m = \u22121 and n = 2, and the horizons are determined by an order N = 3 polynomial. The third solution will lead to a j = 3 term in Eq. (24). If we had N = 4, we would have j = 3 and j = 4 terms in Eq. (24) and so on.\nHowever , the trajectory is trapped within the two horizons (generally taken here to be at d1 and d2), and the asymptotic behaviors are independent of the other terms that cannot be accessed, but also corresponding to \u201chorizons\u201d. What these terms in f(v) will do is affect the details of how the non-thermal transition between the asymptotic thermal states occurs, and hence the non-asymptotic spectrum. This apparently suggests that the characteristics of the radiation can probe \u201csuperhorizon\u201d conditions (beyond the least negative v horizon or beyond the most negative v horizon). In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, the future horizon corresponds to the (Schwarzschild) black hole horizon, and the past horizon corresponds to the (de Sitter) cosmological horizon, meaning effects apparently come from inside the Schwarzschild horizon and outside the de Sitter horizon). Really though, the form of f(v) within the horizons is being determined by the unrealized metric polynomial solutions that give rise to the inaccessible \u201cghost horizons\u201d.\nThe particle spectrum in transition between the two thermal states will be described by a confluent hypergeometric function of N \u2212 1 variables, since ei\u03c9f(v) simply factorizes into N\u22121 terms of the form (v\u2212dj)i\u03c9aj . In the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case, the extra term in Eq. (24) imposes a confluent hypergeometric function of two variables, \u03a61, also known as the Humbert function or the Humbert series, in the Bogoliubov coefficient. One of the variables involves the distance between the horizons and the mode frequency, as if there were no third term in f(v). The other variable also involves the distance between the horizons, and d3 from the mixing term.\nFinally, we can extend the solution of accelerated boundary correspondence with Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime as given in [21] (which approximates by neglecting the third term) to include the full solution with all three terms present. The approximated Bogoliubov coefficient considering only two terms involves the confluent hypergeometric function of one variable. The asymptotic behaviour of 1F1(a, b;x) as x\u2192\u221e is\n1F1(a, b;x) \u2248 ( xa\u2212bex\n\u0393(a) \u2212 (\u2212x)\n\u2212a\n\u0393(b\u2212 a)\n) \u0393(b) , (30)\nwhich corresponds to the high frequency limit, as seen by an inertial observer at infinity.\nLet us now write the function that parameterizes the analog Schwarzschild-de Sitter mirror trajectory as [21]\nf(v) =\u2212 1 \u03baB ln [\u03ba\u0304B(vB \u2212 v)] + 1 \u03baC ln [\u03ba\u0304C(v \u2212 vC)]\n\u2212 1 \u03ba0 ln [\u03ba\u03040(v + v0)] ,\n(31)\nwhere v0 = vB + vC and \u03ba \u22121 0 = \u03ba \u22121 C \u2212 \u03ba \u22121 B . All the parameters of the trajectory have a one-to-one correspondence with the parameters of the Schwarzschildde Sitter spacetime. As far as the mirror is concern, vi (i = B,C) describe the acceleration horizons of the\n5 trajectory, \u03bai (i = B,C) describe the acceleration parameters of the trajecory, and \u03ba\u0304i (i = B,C, 0) are, to this extent, irrelevant constants. See [21] for details. A Penrose diagram of Minkowski spacetime with superposition of a mirror trajectory of this type can also be found there. The exact Bogoliubov coefficient considering the three terms involves the confluent hypergeometric function of two variables.

Note that in this limit the asymptotic behaviour of 1F1(a, b;x) and \u03a61(a, p, b; q, x) look very similar. As expected, both expressions match when the second variable vanishes, i.e. q = 0 implies no third term in f(v).\nThe particle spectrum splits in the \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9 regime as\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = NB +NC +NBC , (36)\nwhere\nNB = 1 2\u03c0\u03baB\u03c9\u2032 1 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03baB \u2212 1 , (37)\nNC = 1 2\u03c0\u03baC\u03c9\u2032 1 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03baC \u2212 1 , (38)\nand\nNBC =\u2212 1 4\u03c02\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 (1\u2212 \u03b4)\u2212 i\u03c9 \u03ba0\n( \u03c9\u2032\n\u03ba\u2032\n)\u2212 i\u03c9\u03ba e\u2212 \u03c0\u03c9 2\u03ba \u2212 i\u03c9\u2032 \u03ba\u2032\n\u00b7 \u0393 ( 1 + i\u03c9\n\u03baB\n) \u0393 ( 1 + i\u03c9\n\u03baC\n) + c.c. ,\n(39)\n1 One can see that in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0 (with vB 6= vC), \u03ba\u03040 \u2192 0, and\n\u03b4\n\u03ba\u03040 \u2192\n1 \u03ba\u2032 .\nTaking this into account one can recover Eq. (32) in [21] from our Eq. (32).\nwith \u03ba\u22121 = \u03ba\u22121B + \u03ba \u22121 C . This term indicates the particle creation by the accelerated boundary correspondence with Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime at intermediate times. It demonstrates a non-thermal particle distribution between the early-time and late-time thermal equilibria. It shows the effect of the acceleration horizons and the interaction behaviour between them resulting in the non-thermal spectrum. The particle production is rather non-trivial at the intermediate times of the trajectory, and this constitutes a new aspect in the radiation results when several physical horizons are present, demonstrating two Planck distribution \u2018intercommunication\u2019 to end up with an overall out-of-equilibrium spectrum. In this case, this complicated cross term indicates the exact form of this interplay between the analog black hole and cosmological horizons of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. We can recast the cross term NBC in the following form using of the properties of the Gamma function \u0393(x), which reveals an interesting mixing modulated by an oscillation:\nNBC = \u22122 \u221a NBNC\n\u00b7 cos [ \u03c9\u2032\n\u03ba\u2032 + \u03c9 \u03ba ln\n( \u03c9\u2032\n\u03ba\u2032\n) + \u03c9\n\u03ba0 ln (1\u2212 \u03b4)\u2212 (\u03b8B + \u03b8C)\n] ,\n(40)\nwhere we have defined\n\u03b8i \u2261 \u2212 \u03c9\n\u03bai \u03b3E + \u221e\u2211 n=1 [ \u03c9 n\u03bai \u2212 tan\u22121 ( \u03c9 n\u03bai )] (i = B,C) ,\n(41) with \u03b3E the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The infinite series in \u03b8i as it stands is not convergent. As an approximation, we can expand the function tan\u22121(x) to see that, at leading order,\n\u221e\u2211 n=1 [ \u03c9 n\u03bai \u2212 tan\u22121 ( \u03c9 n\u03bai )] \u223c O(\u03c93) , (42)\nso, in the \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9 regime (with \u03c9 \u2192 0), we can neglect this term and write\n\u03b8i \u2248 \u2212 \u03c9\n\u03bai \u03b3E . (43)\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2, showing that the mixing term has a significant effect on the particle spectrum, with an explicit oscillation modulating the separate Planck spectra sum. Since NB , NC , and NBC all have prefactors of 1/\u03c9\u2032, we plot \u03c9\u2032(NB + NC) and \u03c9\u2032(NB +NC +NBC) to present results for two different values of \u03c9\u2032 on the same scale. Note that, as expected, higher \u03c9\u2032 increases the oscillation frequency. Thus the \u201cinterference\u201d between the horizons yields a physically significant effect.\nAs expected, we see that when \u03baC = 0 (which is the analog of the Schwarzschild limit), the particle spectrum is the usual thermal spectrum, NB , since NC and NBC vanish.\n6 \u03c9'(NB+NC )\u03c9'(NB+NC+NBC) [\u03c9'=104]\u03c9'(NB+NC+NBC) [\u03c9'=108]\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\u03c9\n\u03c9'N \u03c9 \u03c9'\nFIG. 2: The particle spectrum N\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 for the analog Schwarzschild-de Sitter mirror, normalized by \u03c9\u2032, is plotted as a function of \u03c9.

            "text": "As an another example connecting horizons, let us now consider the unusual transition between the two horizons of the \u2018null-self-dual\u2019 or \u2018Davies-Fulling\u2019 trajectory,\nf(v) = \u2212 1 \u03ba ln(2\u2212 e\u03bav) , (44)\nwhich is the light-speed case [22] of the drifting counterpart in [23], first suggested by Davies-Fulling [7] and then investigated at late-times [8]. Solving for the overall particle spectrum we find an interesting form,\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = 1\n2\u03c0\u03ba(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2032)\n( 1\ne2\u03c0\u03c9\u2032/\u03ba \u2212 1 \u2212 1 e2\u03c0\u03c9/\u03ba \u2212 1\n) .\n(45) This is a sum of Planck factors with no apparent mixing between the horizons, presumably due to the self-dual nature. That is, the characteristic dynamical trait of the Davies-Fulling null-self-dual trajectory is time-reversal symmetry on the trajectory motion, z(t) = z(\u2212t). The exponential proper acceleration in space (as the independent variable) or inverse linear dependence on proper time results in a side-symmetric spectrum and dual energy flux which is the same on both sides of the mirror, hence the reasonably apt name, \u2018self-dual\u2019. Eq. (45) is correct even in the null limit of the drifting case in [23]. Compare this no-mix behavior to the CW-CW transition spectrum in Sec. III which also has an explicit Planck spectra, but includes a mixing effect due to the confluent hypergeometric function modulus squared.\nIn the high frequency limit, \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9, the radiation reduces to the expected and explicit Planck distribution, i.e. Eq. (22), in full agreement with Davies-Fulling latetime results. Symmetrically, in what we may call the \u2018low frequency\u2019 limit, \u03c9\u2032 \u03c9, the radiation simplifies to\nN\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 = 1\n2\u03c0\u03ba\u03c9\n1\ne2\u03c0\u03c9\u2032/\u03ba \u2212 1 , (46)\ndemonstrating a temperature T = \u03ba/(2\u03c0) as well. Notice the difference in prime location compared with Eq. (23).\nThe energy flux straightforwardly gives a plateau at late retarded times using p(u) = (1/\u03ba) ln(2\u2212e\u2212\u03bau), which corroborates the high frequency result. However, at early times, no such plateau exists. Where then is the thermal flux indicative of the Planck spectrum in Eq. (46)? The early-time missing plateau exists, but on the left side of the mirror, as can be found by symmetry, replacing the form of f(v)\u2194 p(u) and investigating early retarded time emission in \u221224\u03c0F (u) = p\u2032\u2032\u2032/p\u2032 \u2212 (3/2)(p\u2032\u2032/p\u2032)2."

            "text": "The non-equilibrium evolution between horizons and thermal states is a rich subject, associated with nonintuitive but fundamental dynamics and radiative symmetries with fascinating consequences, like curvature correspondences [24], negative-energy particles [25] or information loss [26\u201330]. One benefit to deriving the radiation emitted by thermal horizons is the consistency check afforded by the appearance of a Planck spectrum in the appropriate frequency regime, absent in other contexts like the inertial horizon [31], eternal constant acceleration [18], or extremal horizons [32].\nIn the investigation of such asymptotic equilibria we have found four novel solutions corresponding to transitions between horizons from time-dependent accelerated motions:\n\u2022 CW-CW transition spectrum; Eq. (21); Sec. III.\n\u2022 S-dS transition spectrum; Eq. (36); Sec. IV.\n\u2022 D-F transition spectrum; Eq. (45); Sec. V.\n\u2022 CW-CA transition spectrum; Eq. (A3); App. A.\n(In addition we have studied asymptotic thermal flux and particle spectrum from transitions between constant acceleration horizons, Sec. II, Eq. (11).)\nThere are important physical insights gleaned from each of the major solutions: The CW-CW spectrum in Sec. III unravels the fact of having physical evolution from an asymptotic thermal flux with no horizon, to a separate asymptotic thermal flux with a higher or lower temperature. This not only demonstrates the necessarily detached relation between the existence of a horizon and thermality, but the freedom to step-up (or down) in temperature within a trajectory defined globally. (And has some interesting asides on \u201csuperhorizon\u201d structure.)\n7 The most important advancement in Sec. IV, and a distinctive highlight of this paper, is the solution for accelerated boundary correspondence with Schwarzschildde Sitter spacetime. We have been able to analytically derive the radiation emitted by the analog black hole and cosmological horizons, which is a particularly challenging transition particle spectrum that was previously considered intractable [21]. The results are in agreement with what was qualitatively expected, but the exact and precise result quantitatively incorporates an oscillation that characterizes the mixing of asymptotic thermal states. An important and interesting aspect to address in future investigations concerns the detectability of this horizon \u201cinterference\u201d by an observer. A first approach may be to reanalyze how Unruh-DeWitt detectors respond in these scenarios where different physical horizons are present. It is also worth mentioning that alternative configurations of the dynamical Casimir effect exhibit an interference phenomenon [33], which might be more accessible experimentally. However, in these cases the cause is different from having an accelerated boundary with two horizons.\nA direct comparison to Sec. V leads to the remarkable understanding of the salient physical simplicity of essentially no mixing from the transition if the acceleration is that of the Davies-Fulling trajectory. There the particle spectrum from the transition between horizons is just a straight sum of Planck factors for each of the horizons. What\u2019s more, the hidden plateau on the leftside of the mirror has implications in 1+3 dimensions [34\u201336], where both sides of the mirror are needed for generalization [37, 38].\nAn interesting result is treated in Appendix A. This is the analytic spectral tractability of a transition connecting constant acceleration to CW that in the end reveals the Planck factor associated with the thermal plateau in energy flux. Perhaps the most interesting physical implication is not that energy flux can be independent of branch cuts that result in multiple horizons within a trajectory defined globally, but that there exist negative energy flux thermal plateaus (e.g. [39\u201343]) characterized by Planck factors.\nAlready established gravitational analogue models like the accelerated moving mirror, as well as the new ones, continue to deliver theoretical [44, 45] and experimental insights [46, 47] into the nature of acceleration radiation, horizons, and thermality. Understanding how higher dimensions may play a role with respect to transitions, and providing an in-depth analysis of the physical implications in curved spacetimes for the trajectories studied would be an interesting subject for investigation.\nIn the context of Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime specifically, further investigation is needed to recover and reinterpret the results of the analog mirror but now in the curved spacetime system. In the case of Schwarzschild spacetime this was achieved in [9], but in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case this is more complicated. Note that the accelerated boundary system is asymptotically flat, as is the Schwarzschild spacetime, but the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is not. There the correspondence with the curved spacetime is not as straightforward. We defer the details of such an investigation to a future work."

This can be realized with the mirror trajectory\nf(v) = 1\n\u03ba sinh\u22121 ( \u2212 1 \u03bav ) , (A1)\nwhere there are two branches, either the left-hand side, v \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, 0] or the right-hand side, v \u2208 [0,\u221e].\nRegardless of branch, the energy flux F (v) from this mirror, using Eq.

The unusual \u22122 factor arises because of the particular transition we chose between constant acceleration and CW. Recall that Eq. (11) gives an energy flux approaching thermal with F (v) \u2192 [\u03ba2/(48\u03c0)] \u00b7 12c, and the expansion of sinh\u22121(x) in Eq. (A1) gives c = \u22121/6. The two branches and energy fluxes are shown in Fig. 3.\nFig. 4 demonstrates each of the two regions of asymptotic thermality possessed individually by each branch (here shown for the left-hand side branch), shown in\n8 two different coordinates since the plateau near u = 0 (v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e) is hard to see when plotted in u (just as the one near v = 0 (u\u2192 \u00b1\u221e) is hard to see when plotted in v). Indeed the energy flux is constant for |\u03bav| 1 and |\u03bau| 1 (v \u2192 0).\nWe can further check thermality by considering the particle spectrum.
