    "abstractText": "By employing the spin-boson model in a dense limit of environmental modes, quantum entanglement and correlation of sub-Ohmic and Ohmic baths for dissipative quantum phase transitions are numerically investigated based on the variational principle. With several measures borrowed from quantum information theory, three different types of singularities are found for the first-order, second-order, and Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions, respectively, and the values of transition points and critical exponents are accurately determined. Besides, the scaling form of the quantum discord in the Ohmic case is identified, quite different from that in the sub-Ohmic regime. In two-spin model, two distinct behaviors of the quantum discord are uncovered: one is related to the quantum entanglement between two spins, and the other is decided by the correlation function in the position space rather than the entanglement.",

With several measures borrowed from quantum information theory, three different types of singularities are found for the first-order, second-order, and Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions, respectively, and the values of transition points and critical exponents are accurately determined. Besides, the scaling form of the quantum discord in the Ohmic case is identified, quite different from that in the sub-Ohmic regime. In two-spin model, two distinct behaviors of the quantum discord are uncovered: one is related to the quantum entanglement between two spins, and the other is decided by the correlation function in the position space rather than the entanglement.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs a new developed interdisciplinary field in recent decades, quantum information science mainly based on the principles of quantum mechanics has attracted much attention and developed quickly in both theoretical and experimental researches [1\u20133]. At the core of the quantum information, quantum entanglement [4, 5] which is an important resource in the processes of realizing quantum computation and quantum information tasks, has been extensively studied, leading to powerful applications. Examples are coupled electronic and vibrational motions in molecules [6, 7], quantum teleportation [8], quantum key distribution [9], quantum dense coding [10], telecloning [11], one-way quantum computing [12], and quantum estimation [13]. However, it is very fragile and easily destroyed by the decoherence effect from the surrounding environment [5, 14]. Hence, a full understanding of the influences of environmental noise on the quantum entanglement is very important, though it is a long standing challenge in the study of open quantum systems. A wide variety of characterizations for quantumness have been proposed for the investigation of quantum phase transitions describing sudden changes of the manybody ground state as a nonthermal control parameter moves through the critical value at zero temperature [15\u2013 21]. These quantum information oriented methods have a common advantage in that they can study phase transitions without any knowledge of order parameters and symmetries in priority. Quantum entanglement is one of the most famous indicators [22], and quantum discord which reflects the quantum correlation between two components of the system, complements the entanglement in certain situations to detect phase transitions [14]. Spin-boson model (SBM) is a well-known dissipative model describing the interaction between a qubit (spin or\n\u2217 Corresponding author: zhounengji@hznu.edu.cn \u2020 Corresponding author: sunzhe@hznu.edu.cn\ntwo-level system) and an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators (bosonic bath) [23\u201325]. In spite of apparent simplicity, it has been widely used to study dephasing and dissipative effects from the environment [26\u201330]. Recent studies show that there exists a localized-delocalized quantum phase transition, as long as the coupling between the system and environment is characterized by a continuous spectral function J(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9s [24, 31]. A rich phase diagram has been found for different values of the spectral exponent s [32\u201337]. More specifically, the phase transition is of second order in the sub-Ohmic regime (s < 1), and of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type in the Ohmic case(s = 1). In the super-Ohmic regime, however, there is no phase transition. Very recently, the transition has been inferred to be of first order even in the Ohmic case, for the two-spin SBM with a strong antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling [38]. It is in contrast to that in the absence of spin-spin coupling where the transition still belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. However, previous studies principally focused on the spin-related observations, such as the spontaneous spin magnetization and the spin coherence as well as the von Neumann entropy characterizing the systemenvironment entanglement [35, 36, 39\u201343]. Bath-related observables which can provide a direct measurement of the quantum criticality intrinsic to the environment were less considered [38, 44, 45].\nBesides, SBM quantum simulation schemes have been realized in recent experiments of superconducting quantum circuits [46\u201348] and trapped atomic ion crystals [49, 50]. It will become feasible in the near future to experimentally measure quantum entanglement and correlation of sub-Ohmic and Ohmic baths. As a result, it crucially requires a deepened knowledge of the critical behaviors nearby the phase transition, but up to now the progress is limited. Although much effort has been devoted to the study of the quantum entanglement in discrete variable systems [4, 22, 51, 52], whether the scaling law still holds for continuous variables remains an open issue. Being one of the simplest prototypes of continuous variable bipartite systems, two-mode Gaussian\n2 state defined as the set of states with Gaussian characteristic functions and quasi-probability distributions has aroused great interest [53\u201355]. Using covariance matrices and symplectic analysis, numerical investigations are carried out on the quantum entanglement and correlation within the bosonic bath. This paper aims at a comprehensive study of quantum entanglement and correlation of sub-Ohmic and Ohmic baths for different types of quantum phase transitions, such as first-order, second-order and KosterlitzThouless transitions, taking the single-spin and two-spin SBM as examples. To obtain an accurate description of the ground state for both the spin system and its environment, numerical variational method (NVM) [36, 44] based on systematic coherent-state decomposition is employed here, which has been proved to be valid in tackling ground-state phase transitions and quantum dynamics [56\u201360]. Moreover, the quantum entanglement and correlation between two spins are also measured in the twospin model, and critical behaviors of them are carefully analyzed, in comparison with those within the bosonic bath. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, the models and variational approach are described. In section III, numerical results of quantum entanglement and correlation as well as the derivative of the ground-state energy are presented for quantum phase transitions in dissipative systems involving the singlespin and two-spin SBM in the sub-Ohmic/Ohmic regime. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section IV."

The subscripts of \u03c3xi and \u03c3zi (i = 1, 2) in Eq. (2) correspond to the 1th and 2th spins, respectively, and K represents the Ising-type spin-spin interaction. Here we state the notation \u03b5 only for completeness, and the focus of the paper lies on the case \u03b5 = 0. The parameters \u03bbk and \u03c9k are obtained from the spectral density function J(\u03c9) = 2\u03b1\u03c91\u2212sc \u03c9 s = \u2211 k \u03bb 2 k\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212\n\u03c9k) [31, 36, 44, 61, 62],\n\u03bb2k =\n\u222b \u039bk+1\u03c9c\n\u039bk\u03c9c\ndtJ(t), \u03c9k = \u03bb \u22122 k\n\u222b \u039bk+1\u03c9c\n\u039bk\u03c9c\ndtJ(t)t, (3)\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the dimensionless coupling strength, \u03c9c represents the high-frequency cutoff, and \u039bk = \u039b k\u2212M is set with the factor \u039b in the logarithmic discretization procedure [24, 32, 41, 63]. In this work, the continuum limit \u039b \u2192 1 is required in order to obtain an accurate description of the ground state for the SBM with a high dense spectrum. To simplify notations, hereafter we fix the maximum frequency \u03c9c = 1. Other model parameters which are in unit of \u03c9c, i.e., \u03b5,\u2206, and K, are then set to be dimensionless. The trial ansatz composed of a systematic coherentstate expansion, termed as the \u201cDavydov multi-D1 ansatz\u201d [36, 56, 59], is used in variational calculations,\n|\u03a81\u3009 = |+\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nAn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( fn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b\n+ |\u2212\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nDn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( gn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b, (4)\nfor the single-spin SBM, and\n|\u03a82\u3009 = |++\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nAn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( fn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b\n+ |+\u2212\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nBn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( gn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b\n+ | \u2212+\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nCn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( hn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b(5)\n+ | \u2212 \u2212\u3009 N\u2211\nn=1\nDn exp\n[ M\u2211\nk=1\n( pn,kb \u2020 k \u2212H.c. )] |0\u3009b,\nfor the two-spin SBM, respectively. In Eqs. (4) and (5), H.c. denotes Hermitian conjugate, + (\u2212) stands for the spin up (down) state, and |0\u3009b is the vacuum state of the bosonic bath. The variational parameters fn,k, gn,k, hn,k, and pn,k represent the displacements of the coherent states correlated to the spin configurations, and An, Bn, Cn, and Dn are weights of the coherent states. The subscripts n and k correspond to the ranks of the coherent superposition state and effective bath mode, respectively. In fact, these trial wavefunctions above are generalized Silbey-Harris Ansatz based on the work of Luther and Emery in the 1970s, and of Silbey and Harris at 1984 [64, 65]. The ground state |\u03a8g\u3009 is determined by minimizing the energy expressed as E = H/N using the Hamiltonian expectation H = \u3008\u03a81,2|H\u0302 |\u03a81,2\u3009 and the norm of the wave function N = \u3008\u03a81,2|\u03a81,2\u3009. The variational procedure entails a set of self-consistency equations which can be numerical solved with the relaxation iteration technique and global optimization algorithm. For each set of\n3 the model parameters (\u03b1,\u2206,\u039b,K), more than one hundred random initial states are taken to reduce statistical noise. Since time evolutions of variational parameters in the iteration are dependent on the initial states, the relaxation dynamics is considered to be not universal. With the ground-state wavefunction at hand, two phase-space variables are given by xk = \u3008\u03a8g|x\u0302k|\u03a8g\u3009 and pk = \u3008\u03a8g|p\u0302k|\u03a8g\u3009 as the expectation values of the position and momentum for the k-th bath mode, respectively, where x\u0302k and p\u0302k are\nx\u0302k = ( bk + b \u2020 k ) / \u221a 2, p\u0302k = i ( b\u2020k \u2212 bk ) / \u221a 2. (6)\nThe variances of phase-space variables and correlation functions are then measured,\n\u2206Xb = \u3008\u03a8g|(x\u0302k)2|\u03a8g\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a8g|x\u0302k|\u03a8g\u30092, \u2206Pb = \u3008\u03a8g|(p\u0302k)2|\u03a8g\u3009, CorX = \u3008\u03a8g|x\u0302kx\u0302l|\u03a8g\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a8g|x\u0302k|\u03a8g\u3009\u3008\u03a8g|x\u0302l|\u03a8g\u3009, CorP = \u3008\u03a8g|p\u0302kp\u0302l|\u03a8g\u3009, (7)\nwhere the subscripts k and l correspond to the k-th and l-th bath modes, respectively, and \u3008\u03a8g|p\u0302k|\u03a8g\u3009 \u2261 0 is expected for the ground state. Since the number of coherent-superposition N in Eqs. (4) and (5) is small, the ground-state state of each bath mode can be approximated to a Gaussian state. By that means, it can be characterized by first and second statistical moments, denoted by the vector\u2212\u2192r = (xk, pk, xl, pl) and its covariance matrix \u03c3ij = \u3008\u03a8g|r\u0302ir\u0302j |\u03a8g\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03a8gr\u0302i|\u03a8g\u3009\u3008\u03a8g|r\u0302j |\u03a8g\u3009, respectively. In terms of the variances of phase-space variables, the latter can also be written as\n  \u2206Xk 0 CorX 0 0 \u2206Pk 0 CorP\nCorX 0 \u2206Xl 0 0 \u2206CorP 0 \u2206Pl\n  = ( A C CT B ) , (8)\nwhere A,B and C are three 2\u00d7 2 matrices, and CT represents the transpose of the matrix C. For an arbitrary two-mode Gaussian state \u03c3, the vonNeumann entropy Sb is measured firstly,\nSb = f (n\u2212) + f (n+) , (9)\nwhere n\u00b1 is given by\nn2\u00b1 = \u2206\u00b1 \u221a \u22062 \u2212 4det\u03c3 2 , (10)\nwith the invariant \u2206 = detA + detB + 2detC under the action of the symplectic transformation, and the form of the function f(x) is given by\nf (x) = ( x+ 1\n2\n) ln ( x+ 1\n2\n) \u2212 ( x\u2212 1\n2\n) ln ( x\u2212 1\n2\n) .\n(11)\nThe determinant of the covariance matrix \u03c3 and its submatrix A,B, and C are calculated as\ndetA = \u2206Xk\u2206Pk,\ndetB = \u2206Xl\u2206Pl,\ndetC = CorxCorp, (12)\ndet\u03c3 = \u2206Xk\u2206Pk\u2206Xl\u2206Pl +CorxCorxCorpCorp\n\u2212 \u2206Xk\u2206XlCorpCorp \u2212\u2206Pk\u2206PlCorxCorx.\nAnother measurement referred to as the linear entropy, SL,b, is also carried out,\nSL,b = 1\u2212 \u00b5b = 1\u2212 Tr [ \u03c12 ] = 1\u2212 1/ ( 4 \u221a det\u03c3 ) , (13)\nwhere \u00b5b denotes the purity ranging from 1 for pure states to the limiting value 0 for completely mixed states, since no finite lower bound to the 2-norm of \u03c1 exists due to the infinite dimension of the Hilbert space [66]. Besides, the mutual information is also investigated,\nIb = Sb (\u03c31) + Sb (\u03c32)\u2212 Sb (\u03c3) = f (a) + f (b)\u2212 f (n\u2212)\u2212 f (n+) , (14)\nwhere \u03c31,2 denotes the reduced state of the subsystem 1\nor 2, and the parameters a and b represent \u221a detA and\u221a\ndetB, respectively. In order to quantify the degree of entanglement, the logarithmic negativity EN,b = max{0,\u2212 log2 2\u03bd\u0303\u2212} is introduced , where \u03bd\u0303\u2212 is the symplectic eigenvalues of the partial transpose \u03c3\u0303 of the two-mode covariance matrix\n\u03bd\u03032\u00b1 = \u2206\u0303\u00b1 \u221a \u2206\u03032 \u2212 4det\u03c3 2 , (15)\nwhere \u2206\u0303 = detA + detB\u2212 2detC is another symplectic invariant. Finally, quantum discord Db = Ib \u2212 Cb is considered as a measure of all nonclassical correlations in a bipartite state, including but not restricted to entanglement. For pure entangled states, quantum discord coincides with the entropy of entanglement. It also can be nonvanishing for some mixed separable state wherein the correlation depicted by the positive discord is an indicator of quantumness. States with zero discord represent essentially a classical probability distribution embedded in a quantum system. The classical correlation Cb is measured by maximizing over all possible measurements, taking the form\nCb (\u03c3) = Sb (\u03c31)\u2212 inf{\u220f i }{Sb ( \u03c31|2 ) }\n= Sb (\u03c31)\u2212 inf{\u220f i }\n\u2211\ni\npiSb (\u03c11i) , (16)\nwhere pi is the measurement probability for the i-th local projector, and \u03c11i denotes the reduced state of subsystem 1 after local measurements. As reported in previous work [53, 55], the quantum discord of a general two-mode Gaussian state is given by\n4 Db (\u03c3) = f (b)+ f (e)\u2212 f (n\u2212)\u2212 f (n+), where b, n\u2212, n+, and f (x) are already mentioned before, and the value of e = \u221a det\u01eb is estimated by\ndet\u01eb =\n \n\n2\u03b32+(\u03b2\u22121)(\u03b4\u2212\u03b1)+2|\u03b3| \u221a \u03b32+(\u03b2\u22121)(\u03b4\u2212\u03b1)\n4(\u03b2\u22121)2 if\u0393 \u2265 0,\n\u03b1\u03b2\u2212\u03b32+\u03b4\u2212 \u221a \u03b34+(\u03b4\u2212\u03b1\u03b2)2\u22122\u03b32(\u03b1\u03b2+\u03b4)\n8\u03b2 if\u0393 < 0,\n(17)\nwith \u0393 = (1 + \u03b2) \u03b32 (\u03b1+ \u03b4)\u2212(\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2)2 , \u03b1 = 4detA, \u03b2 = 4detB, \u03b3 = 4detC, and \u03b4 = 16det\u03c3. Since the quantum entanglement and correlation defined in Eqs.(9)-(17) can be investigated for arbitrary two bath modes, without losing any generality we fix one frequency \u03c9l = \u03c9c = 1 in the following. Taking their summations over the other frequency \u03c9k, efficient indicators\u2211\nCorX, \u2211 Sb, \u2211 Ib, \u2211 SL,b, \u2211 EN,b, and \u2211\nDb are thus obtained for quantum phase transitions."

To investigate the discretization effect, one employs different values of the discretization factors \u039b = 1.05 \u223c 8 with the same lowest frequency \u03c9min \u2248 10\u221210. All curves decrease with the coupling \u03b1, and have sharp kinks, indicating a high-order singularity expected at the transition point. It confirms that the phase transition is of second order.\nMoreover, the transition boundary marked by the dashdotted line displays a linear dependence of \u2202Eg/\u2202\u03b1 on the critical coupling \u03b1c. The convergence is reached at \u039b = 1.05, corresponding to the number of effective bath modes M = 430. It is about the same order of magnitude as that in the Davydov work on the quantum dynamics of the SBM [67]. Taking the asymptotic value \u03b1c,\u039b\u21921 = 0.01802 as input, the shift of the transition point \u2206\u03b1c = \u03b1c(\u039b) \u2212 \u03b1c,\u039b\u21921 is plotted in Fig. 1(b) as a function of the logarithm of the discretization factor ln\u039b on a log-log scale. A power-law increase of \u2206\u03b1c is found to provide a good fitting to the numerical data, and the value of the slope yields d\u2212 1/\u03bd = 1.79(2) from the scaling arguments and the relation ln\u039b = \u2212(ln\u03c9min)/M \u223c 1/M where M is equivalent to the length of the Wilson chain. By that we mean the Hamiltonian of SBM can be exactly mapped to the one describing a bosonic chain, i.e., Wilson chain, with nearest-neighbour interactions via a canonical transformation [36, 68]. In addition, quantum phase transition for the system with short-range interactions in d spatial dimensions is generally believed to be equivalent to the classical transition in d + 1 dimensions under the quantum-classical mapping. Thus taking effective spatial dimension deff = 1+ 1 by assumption, one calculates the correlation length exponent 1/\u03bd = 0.21(2), in agreement with the mean-field prediction 1/\u03bdMF = s = 0.2. On the other hand, the dependence of the critical coupling \u03b1c on the lowest frequency \u03c9min is also investigated, and the results are shown in the inset where the discretization factor \u039b = 2.0 is set. Note the correlation length is given by an inverse energy scale \u03be = 1/\u03c9\u2217 where \u03c9\u2217 is the frequency above which the quantum critical behavior is established. Therefore, a power-law relation \u2206\u03b1c \u221d L\u22121/\u03bd = \u03c91/\u03bdmin can be derived from the finitesize scaling analysis in frequency space. The exponent 1/\u03bd = 0.22(1) is estimated from the slope of the curve in the inset, well consistent with the earlier one 0.21(2)."

Obviously, they reach a sharp peak right at the phase transition, pointing to a cusp-like singularity. By normalizing the peak value to unity, all the curves have similar shapes, suggesting they obey the same scaling law in the subOhmic regime. The transition point \u03b1c = 0.01803(1) is determined by the peak position which is indicated by the vertical dash-dotted line. It is in good agreement with the extrapolation result \u03b1c,\u039b\u21921 = 0.01802 in Fig. 1, showing \u039b = 1.05 is sufficient small for the convergence in the continuum limit. Besides, the accuracy of the variational result on the critical coupling is significantly\n5 improved, in comparison with previous ones 0.0168 [32] and 0.02014 [69]. Moreover, it agrees well with numerical results 0.0185(4), 0.0175(2), and 0.0179(5) obtained from the numerical renormalization group (NRG) [63], quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) [70], and variational matrix product [41], respectively, thereby lending further support to the validity of variational calculations in this work. Using the summation of the quantum discord \u2211 Db over the frequency \u03c9k as a representative indicator, one investigates the influence of the discretization factor \u039b in Fig. 3(a). Similar with that in Fig. 1(a), the critical coupling \u03b1c determined by the peak position of \u2211 Db is shifted left with the decreasing discretization factor \u039b. While the slopes 1.00(2) and 2.37(3) in two sides are almost unchanged, showing that critical exponents are robust. Noting ln\u039b \u223c 1/M , one concludes that the peak value of \u2211 Db increases slightly with the environmental sizeM , confirming the general assumption that the quantum correlation has a singularity at the transition point. Moreover, the dependence on the low-energy cutoff \u03c9min is also demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). Interestingly, all the curves of \u2211 Db for different \u03c9min \u2248 10\u22129 \u223c 10\u22123 almost overlap with each other in the delocalized phase, indicating quantum discord Db in the low-frequency regime is negligible. In the localized phase, however, the decay exponent is changed slightly from 3.3(1) to 2.37(4) with the decreasing \u03c9min, different from that in Fig. 3(a). It indicates the critical behavior of \u2211 Db is dependent on \u03c9min rather than \u039b. The slope approaches the asymptotic value 2.37 at \u03c9min \u2248 10\u22129, confirming that the value of the parameter \u03c9min used in this work is already sufficiently small."

In order to demonstrate the validity of our scaling analysis and NVM in such non-mean-filed regime, additional simulations with the spectral exponent s = 0.7 are performed for different values of \u039b and \u03c9min. Taking \u039b = 1.05 as an example, the first derivative of the ground-state energy, \u2202Eg/\u2202\u03b1, is plotted versus the coupling \u03b1 in Fig. 4(a). Similar to that in Fig. 1, high-order singularity is obtained at the transition point \u03b1c = 0.2276(1), though the slope difference between two phases (1.5 \u2212 0.75 = 0.75) becomes far less, inferring that the transition is weakened in the shallow sub-Ohmic regime. In addition, the first derivative of the spin coherence, \u2202\u3008\u03c3x\u3009/\u2202\u03b1, is also presented with stars, and a\ntiny discontinuity is detected at the critical point, again supporting the transition is of second order. In Fig. 4(b), the asymptotic behavior of \u2206\u03b1c is carefully examined. By taking into account the mass flow corrections, the transition point \u03b1c = 0.2430 is estimated in the inset at \u039b = 2, in agreement with QMC result 0.241(2) [70]. The asymptotic value of \u03b1c is then refined to be 0.22731 in the continuum limit \u039b \u2192 1, corresponding to a high dense sub-Ohmic bath. Moreover, the exponent value 1/\u03bd = 0.43(3) is determined, well consistent with the QMC result 0.45(5), but far away from the predictions 1/\u03bd = s = 0.7 and \u221a\n2(1\u2212 s) \u2248 0.775. Quantum-to-classical correspondence gives that the SBM quantum transition is in the same universality class as the classical Ising chain with long-range interactions decaying as 1/r1+s [31]. Interestingly, our result agrees well with 1/\u03bd = 1/2 + 1/3\u01eb \u2212 2.628\u01eb2 + O(\u01eb3) \u2248 0.461 with \u01eb = s \u2212 0.5 which can be read off from the hyperscaling relation \u03b3 = (2\u2212\u03b7)\u03bd and two-loop renormalization-group results on the exponents \u03b3 and \u03b7 in the Ising chain [72]."

Considering the constraint available computational resources, the tunneling amplitude \u2206 = 0.01 and discretization factor \u039b = 1.01 are set as a demonstration. Convergence check shows that the numbers of coherent-superposition states N = 6 and of effective bath modes M = 1000, are sufficiently large for Ohmic phase transitions.

            "text": "In Fig.6(a), the summations of the correlation function CorX, logarithmic negativity EN,b, von-Neumann entropy Sb, mutual information Ib, linear entropy SL,b, and quantum discord Db are plotted on a log-log scale for the quantum entanglement and correlation within the Ohmic bath. Different from the cusp-like singularity in Fig. 2,\n6 the discontinuities analogous to the universal jump of the superfluid density in the XY model are found in all curves, again pointing to the emergence of KosterlitzThouless phase transition. The critical value of the coupling \u03b1c = 1.01(1) is then estimated for \u2206 = 0.01, in good agreement with the prediction \u03b1c = 1 + O(\u2206/\u03c9c) [24]. Furthermore, the asymptotic value \u03b1c = 1.0053 is measured by the extrapolation \u03c9min \u2192 0, and the linear coefficient (\u03b1c \u2212 1)\u03c9c/\u2206 = 5.3 is excellent consistent with that in Ref. [73]. It points out that our variational method is as powerful and efficient as QMC and variational Feynman in providing an accurate description of the physical features of SBM.\nIn the delocalized phase \u03b1 < \u03b1c, the summations of the von-Neumann entropy Sb and its linear term SL,b increase with the coupling \u03b1 as a power-law form with the slope close to 1, pointing to the linear dependence. A good coincidence is found for the curves of the correlation function CorX, mutual information Ib, and quantum discord Db, indicating the bath embodies pure quantum effect. They behave similarly to the entropy, though the slope 1.25(2) is slightly larger than 1. In contrast, the summation of the logarithmic negativity EN,b exhibits a power-law decay with a larger exponent 6.04(8), suggesting the average bipartite entanglement is rapidly erased by the decoherence effect from the environment. The opposite trend and vanishing value of \u2211 EN,b show that the ground state of the Ohmic bath in the delocalized phase is separable mixed, rather than pure entangled.\nSubsequently, the frequency dependence is examined, typified by the quantum discordDb. In Fig. 6(b), Db(\u03c9k) is displayed for different couplings \u03b1 = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0 on a log-log scale. It increases monotonously with the frequency \u03c9k, and quickly stabilizes at a constant which is coupling dependent. As the coupling \u03b1 increases, the growth curve flattens out gradually, and tends to be \u03c9k-independent at the transition point. For comparison, the quantum discord Db(\u03c9k) in the sub-Ohmic regime s = 0.2 is also given in the inset. Different from the Ohmic case, all the curves of Db(\u03c9k) exhibit sharp peaks in the high-frequency region. It is worth noting that the peak value reaches a maximum at the transition \u03b1c = 0.018, while the position of the peak remains practically unchanged. Therefore, two distinct scaling behaviors of the bosonic bath can be found for the Ohmic and subOhmic transitions, lending further support to the claim that they belong to different universality classes.\nFor better understanding the nature of ground states in the sub-Ohmic and Ohmic cases, the structure of the environmental wave function characterized by average displacement coefficients defined as fk = \u3008\u03a81|(bk + b\u2020k)(1 + \u03c3z)|\u03a81\u3009/2 and gk = \u3008\u03a81|(bk + b \u2020 k)(1\u2212 \u03c3z)|\u03a81\u3009/2, is demonstrated in Fig. 7. For the sub-Ohmic SBM at s = 0.2, a perfect antisymmetry relation fk = \u2212gk is found over the whole range of \u03c9k in the upper panel of the subfigure (a), supporting the usual assumption concerning the delocalized phase [34, 65]. A huge jump appears in the low-frequency value of the displacement co-\nefficient when the coupling is changed from \u03b1 = 0.01803 to 0.01804, showing a sharp transition. In the middle panel, power-law decays of both fk and gk are observed with the slope 0.4 for \u03b1 > \u03b1c at low frequencies, confirming that they follow the same classical displacement \u03bbk/(2\u03c9k) \u223c \u03c9\u2212(1\u2212s)/2k = \u03c9\u22120.4k , and thereby the antisymmetry is broken in the localized phase. For the Ohmic SBM at s = 1, the antisymmetry relation as well as the antipolaron which was proposed as an important concept in Ref. [34] is confirmed in our numerical work, indicating that the picture of the variational parameters in the delocalized phase is almost the same. Spontaneous breakdown of the antisymmetry is also found at the quantum phase transition, as shown in Fig. 7(b). While the deep Kondo regime where \u03b1 \u2192 1 and the localized phase were untouched in that work [34]. Further analysis points out that the amount of the jump for the average displacement coefficient at \u03c9min is four orders of magnitude smaller than the sub-Ohmic one. That is because the value of fk or gk is independent of \u03c9k in the localized phase, for the classical displacement \u03bbk/(2\u03c9k) = constant. Hence, it can be inferred that the bath modes with low and high frequencies may follow the same critical scaling in the Ohmic case, but behave differently in the sub-Ohmic regime. Quantum fluctuations mainly caused by the effect of the antipolarons are investigated in the lower panels of Fig. 7, which can be measured by the departure from the single-coherent state, \u2206Xb \u2212 1/2. In the sub-Ohmic regime, as expected, quantum fluctuations at low frequencies vanish in both the localized and delocalized phases. In contrast, the curve develops a plateau in the high-frequency region for any coupling \u03b1, and the plateau value reaches the maximum at the transition point \u03b1c = 0.018, similar with that in the inset of Fig. 6(b). It suggests that the emergences of kinks in Figs. 2 and 3 are only related to the high-frequency bath modes. In the Ohmic case, the quantum fluctuation \u2206Xb \u2212 1/2 for \u03b1 = 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 grows with the frequency \u03c9k, and approaches a \u03b1-dependent constant value. For a larger coupling, e.g., \u03b1 = 1.1, however, it vanishes \u2206Xb \u2212 1/2 = 0 over the whole frequency range, confirming that bath modes are independent of each other, and behave as a single-coherent state in the localized phase. The picture is quite different from that in the sub-Ohmic regime."

Similar to those in Fig.6(a), they follow power-law behaviors in the delocalized phase, though the values of the growth exponents are slightly larger. The transition point \u03b1c = 0.191(2) is then determined by sudden drops of the curves, much lower than\n7 earlier variational results \u03b1c = 0.5 [74] and 0.31 [38]. It is because that the value of critical coupling can be well refined with the help of the high dense spectrum and broad frequency range \u03c9c/\u03c9min > 10\n5 [45].

General scaling arguments for the continuous phase transition lead to the scaling form of the quantum discord,\nDb(\u03c9k, \u03b1) = \u03b1 \u03bbD\u0303b(\u03c9k/\u03c9s), (18)\nwhere \u03b1\u03bb indicates the scaling dimension, D\u0303b(r = \u03c9k/\u03c9s) represents the scale invariance of the quantum discord in the Ohmic bath, and \u03c9s = 1/\u03be denotes the inverse of the correlation length.\nThe scaling function of the quantum discord D\u0303b(r) = Db\u03b1\n\u2212\u03bb defined in Eq.

With the exponent \u03bb = 1 and energy scale \u03c9s(\u03b1) as inputs, all data of different coupling \u03b1 nicely collapse to a single curve, fully confirming the scaling form of the quantum discord Db. Clearly, D\u0303b(r) \u2192 const when r \u2192 \u221e, and D\u0303b(r) \u223c r1.60 when r \u2192 0, suggesting it is a non-analytic function. In the inset, the energy scale \u03c9s extracted from the data collapse decays exponentially with the coupling \u03b1. Solid line provides a good fit to the numerical data with a power-law correction to scaling, yielding the exponent value 52.7(4). It is perfectly consistent with the result 52.1(5) measured from the magnetization \u3008\u03c3z\u3009 under a tiny bias 10\u22125, and almost twice as large as that from the renormalized tunneling \u2206r [38]. Therefore, it is concluded that exponentially divergent correlation length 1/\u03c9s plays an essential role in critical behaviors of two-spin SBM."

            "text": "For comparison, the correlation, entanglement, and entropy of two spins are also investigated in this work. Firstly, the von Neumann entropy Sv\u2212N that characterizes the entanglement between the spin system and its surrounding bath is introduced, Sv\u2212N = \u2212Tr[\u03c1slog2\u03c1s], where \u03c1s = Trb[\u03c1sb] is a reduced system density matrix given by tracing the total (system + bath) density operator \u03c1sb over the bosonic bath. The linear entropy of the system is then calculated as SL = 1\u2212Tr[\u03c1s\u03c1s]. With the reduced density matrix \u03c1s at hand, the quantum entanglement between two spins can be measured by the concurrence,\nC(\u03c1s) = max{\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4, 0}, (19)\nwhere \u03bbi (i = 1, 2, 3, or 4) represents a square root of the eigenvalues of the matrix \u03c1s\u03c1\u0303s arranged in a descending\norder, and \u03c1\u0303s = (\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y)\u03c1\u2217s(\u03c3y \u2297 \u03c3y). The entanglement of the formation is then calculated,\nSE(C) = h\n( 1 + \u221a 1\u2212 C2 2 ) , (20)\nwith the function h(x) = \u2212x log2 x\u2212 (1\u2212 x) log2(1\u2212 x). In addition, the spin-spin correlation function Cor = \u3008\u03c3z1\u03c3z2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03c3z1\u3009\u3008\u03c3z2\u3009 and mutual information I = Sv\u2212N(\u03c1s1) + Sv\u2212N(\u03c1s2) \u2212 Sv\u2212N(\u03c1s) are investigated for the correlation in the spin system, where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the ranks of the spins. The negativity is a measure of quantum entanglement derived from the PPT criterion for separability, which is an entanglement monotone. The negativity of a subsystem can be defined as N(\u03c1s) = (||\u03c1Ts ||1 \u2212 1)/2, where \u03c1Ts is the partial transpose of the reduced system density \u03c1s with respect\nto the spin 1, and ||X\u0302 ||1 = Tr|X\u0302 | = Tr \u221a X\u0302\u2020X\u0302 is the trace norm or the sum of the singular values of the operator X\u0302 . The logarithmic negativity is then calculated as EN = log2(2N + 1). It is believed to be an easily computable entanglement measurement and an upper bound to the distillable entanglement [5]. Finally, the quantum discord reflecting the nonclassical part of the total correlation is calculated as D(\u03c1s2|1) = I(\u03c1s)\u2212C(\u03c1s2 : \u03c1s1) where I denotes mutual information between two spins 1 and 2, and C represents the classical correlation,\nC (\u03c1s2 : \u03c1s1) \u2261 sup {\u03a0j1} I (\u03c1s| {\u03a0j1}) (21)\n= sup {\u03a0j1}\n Sv\u2212N (\u03c1s2)\u2212 \u2211\nj\npjSv\u2212N (\u03c1j2)\n\n ,\ngiven by a certain projection measurement {\u03a0j1} on the spin 1 with\npj = Tr (\u03a0j1\u03c1s\u03a0j1) , \u03c1j2 = \u03a0j1\u03c1s\u03a0j1\npj . (22)\nThus, the quantum discord can be written as D ( \u03c1s2|1 ) = Sv\u2212N (\u03c1s1)\u2212Sv\u2212N (\u03c1s)+ inf\n{\u03a0j1}\n\u2211\nj\npjSv\u2212N (\u03c1j2) ,\n(23) with the element of the projective measurement \u03a0j1(j = 1, 2) and density matrix in the Bloch representation \u03c1\u2032s defined as\n\u03a0j1 = 1\n2 (l+ ~nj \u00b7 ~\u03c31) ,\n\u03c1\u2032s = 1\n4\n( 1\u2297 1+ ~a \u00b7 ~\u03c31 \u2297 1+ 1\u2297~b \u00b7 ~\u03c32\n+ 3\u2211\ni,j=1\nTij\u03c3i1 \u2297 \u03c3j2\n\n .

By scanning all possible measurements with parameters (\u03b8, \u03c6), the quantum discord D is obtained by means of the minimization procedure.\nThe spin-related observables defined in Eqs. (19)-(23) are displayed in Fig. 9, whose behaviors are quite different from those of bath-related ones in Fig. 8(a). In particular, the von Neumann entropy Sv\u2212N increases monotonically due to the suppression of the renormalized tunneling amplitude, and reaches a plateau at \u03b1t \u2248 0.1 with the maximal system-bath entanglement. It indicates that coherence is lost already before the system becomes localized, and the spin dynamics is incoherent in the plateau. This coherent-to-incoherent crossover in the two-spin model occurs at the Toulouse point \u03b1t = \u03b1c/2, the same as that in the single-spin model. Moreover, the entanglement between the quantum system and bath can also be measured by the linear entropy SL which behaves similarly to the von Neumann entropy Sv\u2212N, although the value of SL is slightly lower when \u03b1 < \u03b1t.\nBesides the entropy, the spin-spin correlation function Cor and quantum mutual information I are also plotted in Fig. 9(a). Since the mutual information measures the total amount of the correlations in the spin system, the relation Cor < I in the coupling regime \u03b1 < \u03b1t indicates that the correlation function Cor = \u3008\u03c3z1\u03c3z2\u3009\u2212 \u3008\u03c3z1\u3009\u3008\u03c3z2\u3009 is an incomplete measure of the correlation. Further analysis points out that Cor has a similar behavior to C (\u03c1s2 : \u03c1s1) = I \u2212 D, suggesting it belongs to the degree of the classical correlation. Besides, it reaches its maximum Cor = I = 1 at \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b1t, the same as the system-bath entanglement Sv\u2212N. Therefore, one can conjecture that the spin-spin correlation Cor may come from the effect of the bath-induced ferromagnetic interaction Kr = (\u22124\u03b1\u03c9c/s) [38]. In Fig. 9(b), the entanglement between two spins is depicted by the concurrence C, entanglement of formation SE, and logarithmic negativity EN. Exponential decays of them are found in the delocalized phase with large slopes, i.e., 42 for EN and C, and 78 for SE, respectively. It indicates that the entanglement diminishes rapidly with the environmental coupling \u03b1. Besides, the quantum discord D reflecting the nonclassical correlation is also plotted in this subfigure. In contrast to the mutual information I and spin-spin correlation function Cor, quantum discord D exhibits a monotonic smooth decrease in the delocalized phase. Abrupt drops of the curves are found at the transition point \u03b1c = 0.191, analogous to the universal jump of the superfluid density in the XY model, again supporting that the quantum phase transition belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class.\nNote that the behaviors of the correlation, entanglement, and entropy between two spins significantly differ from those between two bath modes. For example,\nthe classical correlation in the former Cor \u223c I \u2212 D increases with the coupling \u03b1, and reaches its plateau with the maximal correlation. While the one in the latter\u2211\n(Ib \u2212 Db) vanishes in the delocalized phase, showing the pure quantumness which can be identified as a signature of the bosonic bath. Furthermore, the logarithmic negativity EN,b decreases with the coupling, displaying the opposite trend of the quantum discord Db. It indicates that the nonclassical correlation in the Ohmic bath is irrelevant to the entanglement, in contrast to that in quantum spin system where the discord is strongly restricted by the entanglement as shown in Fig. 9(b). Further analysis suggests that this nonclassical correlation is essentially determined by the quantum correlation in the position space CorX, as given in Fig. 8(b). Although the average entanglement in the bath \u2211 EN,b/(M \u2212 1) is negligibly small as compared to that EN between two spins, both of them decay with the coupling \u03b1 in the delocalized phase. At the transition point, however, there exist an abnormal increase of \u2211 EN,b and an abrupt drop of EN, suggesting different singularities of quantum entanglements."

In Fig. 10, the discontinuity in the first derivative of the ground-state energy, \u2202Eg/\u2202\u03b1, is obtained at \u03b1c = 0.751(2), pointing to a first-order phase transition. The spin-related quantum discord D and summation of the quantum discord \u2211 Db are then plotted as representatives to illustrate quantum correlations in the spin system and bosonic bath, respectively. In the whole delocalized phase, the quantum discord D remains unchanged, quite different from that in the case with K = 0 as shown in Fig. 9(b). An abrupt jump from D = 1 to 0 is found at the transition point \u03b1c, yielding a singularity in the quantum discord. Further studies give the coincidence between the quantum discord and entropy of entanglement, indicating a pure entangled state of the spin system. Moreover, the relation \u3008\u03c3z1\u03c3z2\u3009 = \u22121 leads to an antiparallel spin configuration. Therefore, the ground state of the spin system in the delocalized phase can be approximated as one Bell basis of maximally entangled states, \u221a 2/2(| + \u2212\u3009 + | \u2212 +\u3009).

In addition, this deltafunction singularity is also found for the summations of\n9 the correlation function CorX, von-Neumann entropy Sb, mutual information Ib, and linear entropy SL,b, thereby one concludes that arbitrary two bath modes are always independent except at the transition point. Interestingly, the system-bath entanglement represented by the von Neumann entropy Sv\u2212N behaves the same as \u2211 Db, indicating that the sharp drop of the entanglement between two spins EN is triggered by the emergence of such singularity in the Ohmic bath."

Since phase diagrams are rich, four different cases are considered, which are the single-spin one in sub-Ohmic regime, Ohmic ones in single-spin and two-spin models, and two-spin one with a strong antiferromagnetic coupling. By comparing and analyzing several measures borrowed from quantum information theory, delta-function, cusp-like, and discontinuous singularities have been obtained, corresponding to quantum phase transitions of first-order, second-order, and Kosterlitz-Thouless types, respectively. Besides, the values of transition points and critical exponents have been accurately determined, which are much better than previous variational results, and in good agreement with analytical predictions and results from other numerical approaches. Offering the bath-related quantum discord as a representative example, the frequency dependence has\nbeen carefully examined. Scaling form of the discord Db(\u03c9k, \u03b1) has been confirmed by the data collapse technique for the Ohmic case, yielding an exponentially divergent correlation length. It is in contrast to that in the sub-Ohmic case where all curves of Db(\u03c9k, \u03b1) for different couplings exhibit sharp peaks at almost the same frequency. It indicates that they belong to different universality classes. In the two-spin model, the investigation of the correlation, entanglement, and entropy between two spins have also been carried out for comparison. The behaviors of them show a great difference, compared to those between two bath modes. Specifically speaking, the classical correlation in the former increases with the coupling, and reaches its plateau at the Toulouse point, while the latter vanishes over the whole \u03b1 range, showing pure quantumness of the bosonic bath. In addition, the quantum discord between two spins is related to the quantum entanglement, and the bath-related one is decided by the correlation function in the position space rather than the entanglement. Finally, quantum entanglements behave quite differently in the spin system and bosonic bath, though they both diminish rapidly with environmental couplings. For discontinuous transitions, two spins are maximally entangled in the delocalized phase, and independent in the localized phase. In contrast, bath modes are independent on both two sides except at the transition point, pointing to a delta-function singularity. Further studies indicate that the sharp drop of the entanglement between two spins may be triggered by the emergence of such singularity from the bosonic bath.\nAcknowledgements: This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 11875120, 11775065, and 12175052.\n[1] D.
