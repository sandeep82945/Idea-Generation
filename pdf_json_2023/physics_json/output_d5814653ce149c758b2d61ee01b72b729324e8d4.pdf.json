    "abstractText": "In this study, vinasse shell biochar (VS) was easily modified with phosphogypsum to produce a low-cost and novel adsorbent (MVS) with excellent fluoride adsorption performance. The physicochemical features of the fabricated materials were studied in detail using SEM, EDS, BET, XRD, FTIR, and XPS techniques. The adsorption experiments demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of fluoride by MVS was greatly enhanced compared with VS, and the adsorption capacity increased with the pyrolysis temperature, dosage, and contact time. In comparison to chloride and nitrate ions, sulfate ions significantly affected adsorption capacity. The fluoride adsorption capacity increased first and then decreased with increasing pH in the range of 3\u201312. The fluoride adsorption could be perfectly fitted to the pseudo-second-order model. Adsorption isotherms matched Freundlich and Sips isotherm models well, giving 290.9 mg/g as the maximum adsorption capacity. Additionally, a thermodynamic analysis was indicative of spontaneous and endothermic processes. Based on characterization and experiment results, the plausible mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto MVS was proposed, mainly including electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, precipitation, and hydrogen bonds. This study showed that MVS could be used for the highly efficient removal of fluoride and was compatible with practical applications.",

            "text": "The effect of fluoride in water on human health is related to its concentration. The normal growth of bones and teeth requires a certain concentration of fluoride intake (0.4 to 1.5 mg/L) [1]. However, drinking water with high levels of fluoride (above 1.5 mg/L) can cause many health problems, such as teeth mottling, skeletal fluorosis, and even changes in DNA structure [2,3]. According to the WHO, the permissible limit for fluoride in drinking water is under 1.5 mg/L [4]. In China, India, Mexico, and some African countries such as Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya, there are high levels of fluoride in the groundwater and surface water [5]. The recorded fluoride concentration in Lake Nakuru (Kenya) reached an alarming 2800 mg/L [6]. More than 260 million people around the world consume fluoridated water, and over 200 million people suffer from diseases associated with drinking highly fluoride-rich water, according to reports [7\u20139]. High concentrations of fluoride in water may be due to natural causes, such as the decomposition and dissolution of fluoridecontaining minerals. However, the most important source is anthropogenic discharges, such as wastewater from the semiconductor industry, metallurgy, cement production, and textile dyeing [10,11]. Therefore, the removal of excess amounts of fluoride from water is an increasingly urgent issue and causes great concern. In recent years, several defluorination methods have been explored, like adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation, the electrochemical method, and chemical precipitation. Each of these techniques displays strengths and limitations. Ion exchange has a\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227617 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617 2 of 22\nfavorable regeneration capacity but slow treatment efficiency [12]. Membrane separation technology is highly efficient but costly [13]. The electrochemical method offers automation and reduced sludge but must tolerate rapid electrode loss [14]. Chemical precipitation has high removal efficiency but large consumption of chemical additives [15,16]. Among these treatment techniques, adsorption is widely considered by researchers and engineers for the advantages of high efficiency, extensive selectivity, and easy operation [17,18]. A mass of adsorbents has been developed for fluoride removals, such as alumina [19], activated carbon [20], fly ash [21], and various composites [22]. Among these materials, biochar is an excellent choice because of its low cost and wide range of raw materials. Nevertheless, biochar has a low adsorption capacity for anions. For this reason, it is necessary to modify biochar to enhance the performance of fluoride removal. Modification can provide significant active sites because of the changes in the surface structure of biochar and the increase of the surface functional groups [23]. Recently, several tailored biochar materials have been put forward for fluoride adsorption. The modification methods can be divided into physical and chemical modifications such as steam activation [24], impregnation [25], alkaline modification [26], and chemical reduction [27]. These explorations have presented a promising way to enhance fluoride adsorption. Vinasse shell is the solid waste from the use of grains in the production of Chinese liquor. It is mainly used as supplementary feed for livestock and organic fertilizer. Due to the low added value, 40 million tons of vinasse shells were wasted in China in 2017 [28]. There is, therefore, a need to develop a sustainable solution to make full use of this waste. Phosphogypsum is a by-product of the phosphorus chemical industry, which cannot be easily stored and is prone to serious pollution [29,30]. Moreover, the reuse of phosphogypsum is inadequate [31]. Previous reports have shown that phosphogypsum-modified biochar can alter the surface chemistry of biochar, thereby enhancing the ability to adsorb some pollutants (phosphates, heavy metals, antibiotics, etc.) [32\u201334]. Most of these reports used co-pyrolysis of biomass and phosphogypsum to prepare adsorbent materials. They also revealed the adsorption mechanism through some physicochemical characterization and adsorption experiments. However, these studies lacked strong evidence to prove the adsorption mechanism. In this study, phosphogypsum was used to modify vinasse shell biochar (VS), and the efficiencies of vs. and MVS in removing F\u2212 from the water were compared. The specific objectives were to (1) understand the physical and chemical characteristics of the biochars using SEM, EDS, BET, XRD, FTIR, and XPS studies; (2) investigate how pyrolysis temperature, dosage, pH, and co-existing anions affect adsorption capacity; and (3) propose a mechanism for the removal of F\u2212 via MVS in conjunction with experimental data and characterization analysis."

Zeta Potential\nA possible adsorption mechanism could be inferred from the determination of the pHpzc. When pHsolution < pHpzc, the functional groups of the material were protonated, giving it a positively charged surface. On the contrary, the surface groups of the material would be deprotonated as pHsolution > pHpzc, so that its surface was negatively charged. As shown in Figure 5, the zeta potential of VS600, phosphogypsum, and MVS600 was determined as a function of pH. It presented that the zeta potentials of all three materials decreased with increasing solution pH. The zero charge points of VS600 and phosphogypsum were at pH 3.18 and 6.24, respectively. Compared with VS600, MVS600 had a higher zeta potential under different pH conditions. The lowest zeta potential of MVS600 was \u221217.70 mV, which was much higher than that of VS600 (\u221230.81 mV). This might be due to the strong positive charge of phosphogypsum. Therefore, electrostatic interactions might contribute to the adsorption of F\u2212 anion onto MVS600.

Similar findings were also obtained for fluoride adsorption by PAA@C-CS and modified chitosan [57,58]. This was due to the constant initial concentration of fluoride. Meanwhile, particle agglomeration was more likely to occur when more adsorbent was added to a given volume of solution, reducing the adsorption active sites per unit mass. However, the removal efficiency (RF = (1 \u2212 Ce/C0) \u00d7 100%) gradually increased from 16 to 67% with the increase of dosage from 0.01 g to 0.2 g.

            "text": "Isotherms study was usually used to investigate the way in which the adsorbate adhered to the surface of the adsorbent [66]. In this work, four widely-used isotherm models were adopted to explain what happened in the adsorption of F\u2212 on MVS600, including Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Sips models. The Temkin isotherm reflects the distribution of the binding energies during the adsorption process. The Sips model is a hybrid model that incorporates characteristics of both the Langmuir and Freundlich models [67]. According to the non-linear equations, the isothermal fitting plots at 25 \u25e6C, 35 \u25e6C, and 45 \u25e6C have been drawn in Figure 12. Table 3 lists the corresponding parameters. A maximum adsorption capacity of 111.8 mg/g was obtained at 45 \u25e6C and C0 = 100 mg/L. It clearly demonstrated that the equilibrium adsorption capacity raised with increasing initial concentration at a certain temperature. This phenomenon might be due to the fact that at a low concentration, lots of active sites on the surface of MVS600 were not yet occupied, thus providing an opportunity for more F\u2212 to be adsorbed by MVS600. Simultaneously, the high concentration enhanced the mass transfer driving force at the solid\u2013liquid interface, which also contributed to the increase in adsorption capacity. It was also noticed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity increased as the solution temperature rose, suggesting that the adsorption was an endothermic process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617 12 of 22\nOn the basis of the correlation coefficient R2, it was observed that all four isotherm models were in very good agreement with the adsorption results. However, at all three temperatures, the Freundlich and Sips isotherm models fitted the experimental data better than the Langmuir and Temkin models due to higher R2 (>0.99) and lower standard deviation (SD). The values of the Freundlich constant 1/n and the Sips constant ms offered a sign of the ease of adsorption. It was widely accepted that values of 1/n and ms in the range of 0\u20131 indicated favorable adsorption features [68,69]. Table 3 shows that the constant 1/n at different temperatures was 0.6844\u20130.7829, which mainly represented that the chemisorption happened at the time of the adsorption of F\u2212 onto MVS600 [70]. This inference was in accordance with the results of the kinetics analysis. From the Sips isotherm\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617 13 of 22\nmodel, it could be deduced that the F\u2212 adsorption onto MVS600 might be multi-layer adsorption on a heterogeneous interface, which was involved in diversiform mechanisms.

It ould be seen from the zeta potential analysis under low\npH conditions th t the C\u2013O groups on the surface of MVS600 were protonated to C\u2013OH+ and carried a large number of positive charges. Negatively charged fluorine ions were remov d by electrostatic interaction with them, as shown in Equation (3). The formation of weakly ionized HF under strongly acidic conditions and deprotonation of surface functional groups under alkaline conditions reduced the degree of F adsorption. Under near-neutral conditions, F\u2212 adsorption could be described using other equations;\n(4) Hydrogen bonding. Due to the high electronegativity of O and F, the shared electron pair of \u2013OH groups on the surface of MVS600 was biased toward O, so H easily interacted with F and formed an \u2013OH\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 F hydrogen bond, as shown in Equation (4). This might be responsible for the change in O\u2013H binding energy before and after adsorption in the XPS spectra.\nMVS600\u2212Surface\u2212OH + F\u2212 \u2192MVS600\u2212Surface\u2212F + OH\u2212 (1)\nMVS600\u2212Surface\u2212Ca2+ + F\u2212 \u2192MVS600\u2212Surface\u2212CaF2 Ksp = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 (2)\nMVS600\u2212Surface\u2212O + H3O+ + F\u2212 \u2192MVS600\u2212Surface\u2212OH+\u2212F\u2212 + H2O (3)\nMVS600\u2212Surface\u2212O\u2212H\u2192MVS600\u2212Surface\u2212O\u2212H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 F\u2212 (4)"

A certain mass of VSx or MVSx was added to the F\u2212 solution containing a fixed initial concentration (C0, mg/L) and oscillated at 200 r/min in a thermotank at 25 \u25e6C for 300 min. Using a 0.45-\u00b5m PES filter, the suspension was filtered after sampling. The effect of pyrolysis temperature (300, 400, 500, and 600 \u25e6C), dosage (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 g), and solution pH (3\u201312) on the adsorption performance of F\u2212 was examined. Detailed experimental conditions were described in the illustrations. To evaluate the impact of anions on fluoride adsorption, NaCl, NaNO3, and Na2SO4 were, respectively, added to the solution at pH = 6.0, and the concentrations of the anions were set to 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mmol/L. Each group of experiments was repeated thrice to get the average adsorption capacity. The following equations were used to obtain the F\u2212 adsorption capacities.\nqe = (C0 \u2212 Ce)\u00d7V\nW (5)\nqt = (C0 \u2212 Ct)\u00d7V\nW (6)\nwhere qe (mg/g) was the equilibrium adsorption capacity, qt (mg/g) was the F\u2212 adsorption capacity at time t, V (L) represented the volume of the suspension, W (g) represented the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617 17 of 22\ndosage of the material, Ct (mg/L) represented the concentration at time t, and Ce (mg/L) referred to the F\u2212 concentration at equilibrium.

The solution temperatures were set at 25, 35, and 45 \u25e6C to study the thermodynamics. The most commonly used models were utilized to fit the adsorption results.\n3.4.1. Adsorption Kinetics Modeling\nAdsorption kinetics modeling was helpful for further studying the rate-limiting steps and adsorption rates. The pseudo-first-order (PFO) model, pseudo-second-order (PSO) model, intraparticle diffusion model, and Elovich model were employed to model the experiment data, which could be described by Equations (7)\u2013(10), respectively.\nqt = qe ( 1\u2212 e\u2212k1t )\n(7)\nqt = k2q2et\n1 + k2qet (8)\nqt = k3t0.5 + Ci (9)\nqt = 1 \u03b2 ln \u03b1\u03b2 + 1 \u03b2 lnt (10)\nwhere k1 (1/min), k2 (g/(mg\u00b7min)), k3 (mg/(g\u00b7min0.5)), and \u03b1 (mg/(g\u00b7min)) denoted the rate constants of the corresponding models; Ci (mg/g) and \u03b2 (g/mg) referred to the model constants.\n3.4.2. Adsorption Isotherm Modeling\nAdsorption isotherm results were modeled by the non-linear equations, that is the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model, the Temkin model, and the Sips model. The formulas could be given by the equations below, respectively [88].\nqe = qmKLCe\n1 + KLCe (11)\nqe = KFC1/ne (12)\nqe = ATln(BT Ce) (13)\nqe = qm(KSCe)\nmS\n1 + (KSCe) mS (14)\nwhere qm (mg/g) represented the maximum adsorption capacity; KL (L/mg) and KF ((mg/g) \u00d7 (L/mg)1/n) were the Langmuir and Freundlich constants, respectively; n denoted the Freundlich constant related to adsorption intensity; AT and BT (L/mg) denoted Temkin constants; Ks was related to the adsorption energy, and ms denoted the Sips model exponent index related to adsorption heterogeneity.\n3.4.3.

The related parameters, namely Gibb\u2019s free energy \u2206G0, enthalpy \u2206H0, and entropy \u2206S0, could be estimated based on Equations (15) and (16).\n\u2206G0 = \u2212RTlnKd (15)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7617 18 of 22\nlnKd = \u2212 \u2206H0 R 1 T + \u2206S0 R (16)\nHere, R denoted the ideal gas constant, T (K) denoted the reaction temperature, and Kd denoted the thermodynamic distribution coefficient.

            "text": "Phosphogypsum was used to modify vinasse shell biochar for the removal of fluoride from aqueous solutions. The modified material (MVS600) gave excellent fluoride adsorption performance with an adsorption capacity of 290.9 mg/g according to adsorption isotherms experiments. Kinetics investigations showed that the fluoride adsorbed onto MVS600 followed the PSO model. Spontaneous and endothermic adsorption was shown by thermodynamic data. Mechanistically, the removal of fluoride by MVS600 could be attributed to electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, precipitation, and hydrogen bonds. Because of its low cost and superior capacity, MVS600 was a good candidate for dealing with high levels of fluorine contamination or for long-term use. The outcomes of this research were beneficial to the treatment of fluoride-polluted water as well as the resourceful use of vinasse shells and phosphogypsum.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.L.; methodology, Z.L.; validation, J.Z. and R.M.; data curation, J.Z. and R.M.; writing\u2014original draft, Z.L.; supervision, Z.L.
