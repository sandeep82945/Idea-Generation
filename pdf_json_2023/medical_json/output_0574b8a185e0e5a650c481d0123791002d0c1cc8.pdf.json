    "abstractText": "The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition T-staging system for distal cholangiocarcinoma (DCC) proposes classification according to the depth of invasion (DOI); nevertheless, DOI measurement is complex and irreproducible. This study focused on the fibromuscular layer and evaluated whether the presence or absence of penetrating fibromuscular invasion of DCC contributes to recurrence and prognosis. In total, 55 patients pathologically diagnosed with DCC who underwent surgical resection from 2002 to 2022 were clinicopathologically examined. Subserosal layer and/or pancreatic (SS/Panc) invasion, defined as penetration of the fibromuscular layer and invasion of the subserosal layer or pancreas by the cancer, was assessed with other clinicopathological prognostic factors to investigate recurrence and prognostic factors. According to the AJCC 8th edition, there were 11 T1, 28 T2, and 16 T3 cases, with 44 (80%) cases of SS/Panc invasion. The DOI was not significantly different for both recurrence and prognostic factors. In the multivariate analysis, only SS/Panc was identified as an independent factor for prognosis (hazard ratio: 16.1; 95% confidence interval: 2.1\u2013118.8, p = 0.006). In conclusion, while the determination of DOI in DCC does not accurately reflect recurrence and prognosis, the presence of SS/Panc invasion may contribute to the T-staging system.",

On the one hand, the DCC region mainly extends from the confluence of the three bile ducts to the papillary bile duct region surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi, which passes through the pancreatic head region and penetrates the duodenal wall [2,3]. On the other hand, the histology of the bile duct wall is characterized by a three-layered structure that lacks the mucosal tendon plates and submucosa and tends to be thinner than the five-layered structure of the stomach and colon. Additionally, the area corresponding to the muscularis propria (i.e., the fibromuscular layer) is rich in fibrous connective tissues. The upstream and downstream areas also exhibit histological differences; in particular, the distal bile ducts upstream comprise loose muscle fibers (referred to as \u201cscattered muscle fibers\u201d), whereas the downstream areas possess thick fibromuscular layers and abundant bile duct accessory glands (mucous glands) in continuity with the bile duct epithelium [4].\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 3406. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13223406 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 3406 2 of 13\nThe current T-classification system by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition adopts a format based on the distance of invasion of all cancers in the extrahepatic bile duct region [1,5\u20137]. Specifically, the depth of invasion (DOI), defined as the distance from the subepithelial basal lamina of the bile duct to the leading edge of invasion, has been reported to reflect prognosis [6]. Nevertheless, problems with the DOI measurement method, which is based on the importance of anatomic landmarks that classify staging according to the DOI (T1 < 5 mm; T2 5\u201312 mm; T3 > 12 mm), have been pointed out by pathologists. With the DOI measurement method, DCCs are subclassified into four categories according to the growth pattern of tumors, which is further complicated by the addition of cholangitis modification [6]. For instance, upstream of the distal bile duct, invasion into the subserosal layer is observed even in areas where the invasion distance is less than 5 mm because of thinning compared with that on the downstream side (Figure 1a). Furthermore, in DCC cases with a large tumor size, cancer cells have been often observed to have already spread to the outer serosa (black arrow in Figure 1b), which seems to be directly associated with the serosal surface involvement of cancer cells rather than the DOI (red arrow in Figure 1b) in terms of prognosis.\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14\nareas also exhibit histological differences; in particular, the distal bile ducts upstream comprise loose muscle fibers (referred to as \u201cscattered muscle fibers\u201d), whereas the downstream areas possess thick fibromuscular layers and abundant bile duct accessory glands (mucous glands) in continuity with the bile duct epithelium [4].

Patients who were pathologically diagnosed with intramucosal carcinoma (Tis) and died within 30 days after surgery were excluded from analysis. Pancreaticoduodenectomy and extrahepatic bile duct resection were performed in patients with surgically resectable DCC. Clinical data, including age, sex, tumor marker (carcinoembryonic antigen/carbohydrate antigen 19-9), adjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical procedures (surgical technique, blood loss, and operative time), were collected. In this study, the primary endpoints were (i) overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of surgery to the date of death, and (ii) survival, defined as the time from the date of surgery to the 5-year follow-up. Death (including death from other causes) was determined from the date of surgery to the date of death; however, death within 1 month after surgery was excluded. As a subanalysis, relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence on clinical images without local recurrence, distant metastasis, or secondary cancer. Followup evaluation was performed every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months for 3\u20135 years using tumor markers and computed tomography images. The 5-year RFS and 5-year OS, as well as their respective medians and tracking rates, were calculated for all patients with DCC, and the prognosis of surgically resected DCC was evaluated. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles embodied in the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013, and was approved by the Tokai University Ethics Committee (approval number: 23R078; date of approval: 17 August 2023).The requirement for informed consent from patients was waived owing to the retrospective nature of this study."

            "text": "The present study investigated the measurement of infiltration distance in DCC based on the AJCC 8th edition and identified four problems. First, a uniform measurement of the DOI is difficult even with an accurate DOI measurement method because patients present with large tumor sizes and mixed growth patterns (papillary/nodular/invasive) [6,8]. Second, compared with the intrapancreatic bile duct region, the extrapancreatic bile duct region is not so thick in terms of bile duct wall thickness, not taking the anatomical differences in the distal bile duct into account. In our study, we also encountered a case of DCC in the extrapancreatic bile duct region with T1 invasion up to SS, with a poor prognosis (5-year RFS: 31%, 5-year OS: 34%), which does not reflect the stratification by T-factors in the AJCC 8th edition. Third, the AJCC T-staging system for DCC was created based on studies conducted by Hong et al. [4,6], which included all extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (including perihilar cholangiocarcinomas and DCCs treated by hepatic resection and pancreatoduodenectomy) and set the cutoff values for the DOI; hence, it is not a T-staging system specific to DCC [6,7]. In other words, the T-factors for DCC in the AJCC 8th edition do not sufficiently reflect recurrence and prognosis, and our opinion is similar to that of other case reports in the literature [9\u201313]. Fourth, clinical evaluation of the extent of cancer progression is difficult using preoperative imaging based on the 8th edition of the AJCC T-classification, and determining whether a patient should undergo upfront resection or chemotherapy is also challenging [8,12,13]. Lymph node metastasis, lymph node ratio, and residual tumor have been reported as factors influencing the prognosis of DCC [10,14\u201316]. In our study, no significant difference was noted in both RFS and OS for residual tumors. A certain consensus has not yet been reached because some reports in the literature have suggested that residual tumors have no effect on recurrence and prognosis, whereas other studies have shown that they contribute to prognosis [9,16\u201318]. As for lymph node metastasis, the relatively small number of cases is assumed to be a problem, given that lymph node metastasis significantly increases with the depth of T-factors. The present study did not reflect recurrence and prognosis; nevertheless, the univariate analysis of RFS showed a trend toward recurrence (p = 0.051). The bile duct wall has a three-layered structure; however, the mucosal layer is often compromised due to conditions such as cholangitis or the presence of bile duct tubes, making detailed depth classification unreproducible. In our study, we encountered difficulties when trying to assess the AJCC T-class DOI, as cholangitis and preoperative biliary stenting drainage caused by cancer obstruction often resulted in mucosal injury or mucosal papillary proliferation. In contrast, it is usually easy for regular pathologists to evaluate the presence or absence of SS/Panc invasion in deeper layers with less inflammation. Additionally, in distal bile ducts, a two-group classification with the fibromuscular layer as the border may have prognostic relevance. In other words, in DCC, SS in the extrapancreatic bile duct region penetrating the fibromuscular layer may contribute to prognosis because of the presence of medium-to-large arteriovenous vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves distributed\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 3406 11 of 13\nin the liver. Parenchymal pancreatic invasion by the intrapancreatic bile duct region that extends beyond the fibromuscular layer is also associated with the risk of pancreatitis. Pancreatic invasion is considered an invasion of other organs and increases the incidence of hematogenous metastasis; in fact, reported cases of prognostic factors have been confirmed in the literature [19\u201322]. Therefore, we defined SS/Panc as the penetration of cancer cells through the fibromuscular layer, regardless of whether it involves the internal and external pancreatic bile ducts. This parameter holds potential significance as a prognostic factor. The results indicated that the 5-year OS for DCC without SS/Panc invasion was 89%, whereas the 5-year OS for DCC with SS/Panc invasion beyond the fibromuscular layer was 29%, with a median of 23.8 months, which reflects an extremely poor prognosis. Notably, 28 of the 55 cases (50.9%) among the AJCC T1/2 patients exhibited SS/Panc invasion. Similarly, 100% of 5-year OS cases have been reported for gallbladder carcinoma in continuity with the bile ducts that do not extend beyond the muscularis propria/muscle layer, which corresponds to the fibromuscular layer. The invasion of the SS beyond the muscle layer is a similar poor prognostic factor, supporting our hypothesis in adjacent organs [17,23]. However, our study has some limitations, particularly its small sample size, potential for selection bias, and the inability to generalize the findings to different populations. Furthermore, this study has all the limitations and risks of bias inherent to cross-sectional studies. Generally, the 5-year OS after surgical resection of DCC is reported to be 20\u201354% [24,25]. The 5-year OS in this study was 42% with a median of 39.5 months, which is almost comparable to that reported in the literature. No cases of T4 surgical resection were observed at our institution. The 5-year OS of DCC with concomitant portal vein resection is 0\u201315%, with a very poor prognosis [9,26\u201328]. There have also been few reports on arterial complications of resection in DCC, and the association with prognosis remains unclear [29]. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider T4 as an unresectable factor. While neoadjuvant chemotherapy is currently not established for cholangiocarcinoma, it is likely that preoperative chemotherapy will be used for cholangiocarcinoma in the future, just as it is for pancreatic cancer. A randomized phase III trial (JCOG1920) with gemcitabine and cisplatin plus S-1 therapy is currently underway in Japan. Preoperative evaluation is not possible under the current T-factor convention for DCC, making it difficult to determine neoadjuvant chemotherapy [30,31]. However, if the depth of SS/Panc invasion is determined by considering the laminar structure, including the fibromuscular layer (i.e., SS/Panc invasion beyond the fibromuscular layer), preoperative diagnosis by intraductal ultrasonography/ultrasonic endoscopy/peroral cholangioscopy ultrasound or endoscopy may be possible [32\u201334]. In the future, biomarkers that may contribute to the further prognosis of SS/Panc invasion should be taken into account. Additionally, prospective randomized controlled trials on more aggressive neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with preoperative molecularly targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors should be conducted to improve the prognosis of patients at a high risk for recurrence (poor prognosis group), in whom SS/Panc invasion is expected on imaging. In conclusion, the presence or absence of SS/Panc invasion, which is a penetrating fibromuscular invasion, plays an important role as a recurrence and prognostic factor for DCC and may contribute to the T-staging system for DCC in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.S. and M.M.; Methodology, H.Y.; Software, H.I.; Validation, T.T.; Formal Analysis, T.S., M.M. and T.T.; Investigation, H.Y.; Resources, M.K. and C.I.; Data Curation, R.F.; Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation, H.Y.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing, H.Y.; Visualization, T.S.; Supervision, T.T.; Project Administration, T.N.; Funding Acquisition, E.N.
