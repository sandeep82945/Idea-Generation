    "abstractText": "Radiative cooling offers a new strategy to address building cooling problems in an environmentally friendly way, compared with traditional cooling methods that require high-power consumption. The goal of radiative cooling is to maximize absorption at the mid-infrared (MIR) spectrum (8\u201313\u03bcm). Thus, it is important to characterize the dispersive relationship of the radiative cooling materials (TiO2, Si3N4, SiC, SiO2) in the MIR regime. In this work, we use the multi-pole Lorentz dispersion equation to model frequency-dependent dielectric constants of radiative coolingmaterials, which requires particle swarm optimization to solve multidimension optimization problems. This modeling can be directly applicable to the auxiliary differential equation (ADE)-based finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for simulating emissivity of radiative cooling materials. Further, we limit the number of Lorentz poles to five, which minimizes the computational burden in ADE\u2013FDTD. Then, we validate our FDTD results against an analytic prediction calculated by the transfer matrix method. Finally, we demonstrate a highly efficient radiative cooling structure based on a simple SiO2 grating. The proposed material modeling can accelerate the nano/microstructural design of the radiative cooling strategies.

INTRODUCTION Radiative cooling offers a new strategy to address photovoltaic and building cooling problems in an environmentally friendly way. Traditional cooling methods require power consumption with external devices, which occupy a large portion of energy consumption in everyday life. On the other hand, passive cooling methods are broadly classified as bio-inspired cooling strategies [1]\u2013[4] and artificial structurebased strategies [5], [6], both reflecting the solar spectrum while maximizing absorption in themid-infrared (MIR) spectrum (8\u201313\u00b5m).\nIn this MIR spectrum, strong selective thermal emission reaches the unlimited cold heat sink of space (\u223c 3K), utilizing a transparency window of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere where the radiation absorption is insignificant. A recent advance of nano-fabrication has been applied to daytime\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Guido Lombardi .\nradiative cooling applications such as metamaterials [7]\u2013[9], polymers [7], [10], [11], and photonic structures [12]\u2013[14]. In order to further improve radiative cooling performance, it is essential to precisely engineer radiative cooling materials with advanced nano/microstructures [12], [15]. This brings challenges to numerical simulations of the radiative cooling materials. For example, rigorous-coupled-wave analysis (RCWA)) [16], [17], discrete dipole approximation (DDA) [18], and the transfer matrix method (TMM) [19], [20] can be used to solve photonic structures relatively fast. However, they are not preferable for studying complicated (or enormous) structures due to assumptions on their methods [21], [22]. On the other hand, solving full-wave Maxwell\u2019s equations provides accurate solutions, wherein the most representative examples of full-wave Maxwell solvers are the finite element method (FEM) [23], [24] or FDTD [11], [25]. The former utilizes unstructured mesh with steady-state analysis, which makes it powerful for analyzing accurate solutions for complex 3D geometries in discrete frequencies.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The latter solves the differential form of Maxwell equations over time and space. It employs a staircase mesh, which is known as Yee\u2019s grid. This offers potential for efficient parallelization in multicore computing. Also, the time-domain response obtained by a single simulation in FDTD can be easily converted to a broadband frequency response by Fourier transformation [22], [26]\u2013[28] as shown in Fig. 1(b) (orange area). The main hurdle on using FDTD for a radiative cooling study is modeling dispersive materials for the MIR regime. The FDTD method requires converting frequency-dependent material parameters to an auxiliary time-domain differential equation for simulating dispersive materials [22].\nIn this work, we use the Lorentz dispersion model to fit the frequency-dependent dielectric constants of the radiative cooling materials via particle swarm optimization (PSO) [29]\u2013[31]. The Lorentz dispersion equation, also known as the Drude\u2013Lorentz oscillator model, involves modeling electrons as a damped harmonic oscillator. By superposing multiple Lorentz equations, we can efficiently model arbitrary frequency-dependent permittivities of the radiative cooling materials for FDTD simulations. A single Lorentz equation has plasma frequency, resonance frequency, and damping coefficient as its parameters, which can be fitted using the least-squaresmethod [32] or others [33]\u2013[37], while fitting parameters for multipole Lorentz equations is more challenging. Therefore, finding a fewer pole dispersionmodel that can fit the experimental complex permittivity data is significant, guaranteeing faster and memory-efficient FDTD simulations. We apply a new figure of merit to the PSO method to discover the Lorentz parameters in this work. Then, we compare our method against a conventional PSO method and genetic algorithm. Additionally, we compare\ndispersive FDTD simulations against analytic calculations based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) [19], [38] for broad angles and broadband to validate our result. This study may facilitate a realization of novel radiative cooling design by enabling faster and accurate simulations of the radiative cooling materials.\nII. MULTI-POLE LORENTZ MODEL OF RADIATIVE"

            "text": "The ADE approach can be applied to simulate Lorentz dispersion materials [39], [40] and many others [41]\u2013[43] in FDTD [22]. The Lorentz model is written as\n\u03b5r(\u03c9) = \u03b5\u221e + \u2211 n\n1\u03b5n \u00b7 \u03c9 2 n\n\u03c92n \u2212 \u03c9 2 + j\u03c9\u03b3n\n, (1)\nwhere \u03b5r is relative permittivity, \u03b5\u221e is a constant offset for the real part of the dielectric function, n is the number of pole, 1\u03b5n is a relative value of the plasma frequency compared to the resonance frequency, \u03b3n is damping coefficient, and \u03c9n is the resonance frequency of the oscillator. The second term denotes Lorentz oscillator model with nth poles. Then, frequency-domain Maxwell\u2019s equations can be written as\n\u2207 \u00d7 H = j\u03c9\u03b50\u03b5r(\u03c9)E (2)\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212j\u03c9\u00b50\u00b5rB. (3)\nAfter inserting Lorentz model (Eq. 1) into Eq. 2, the Maxwell\u2019s equations become\n\u2207 \u00d7 H = j\u03c9\u03b50 ( \u03b5\u221e +\n\u2211 n\n1\u03b5n \u00b7 \u03c9 2 n\n\u03c92n \u2212 \u03c9 2 + j\u03c9\u03b3n\n) E . (4)\nIt can be simplified to(\u2211 n 1\u03b5n \u00b7 \u03c9 2 n \u03c92n \u2212 \u03c9 2 + j\u03c9\u03b3n ) E = PL, (5)\n40844 VOLUME 10, 2022\nVOLUME 10, 2022 40845\nwhere PL is a polarization vector for Lorentz dispersion materials. After putting Eq. 5 into Eq. 4 we get\n\u2207 \u00d7 H = \u03b50\u03b5\u221e \u2202E \u2202t + \u03b50\u2202PL \u2202t . (6)\nThe ADE approach is applied to Eq. 6 to simulate dispersive materials in time-domain forms [39], [50]. Now, we apply PSO to search for proper Lorentz parameters defining frequency-dependent dielectric constants of radiative cooling materials. We choose four representative radiative coolingmaterials (TiO2 [44], Si3N4 [44], SiC [45], SiO2 [46], [47]) in this work, although the proposed method can be applied to other dispersive materials.\nThe PSO is an evolutionary optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of nature, such as ants and bees [29]. It iteratively finds a potential solution with moving particles that have social and cognitive factors. The number of dimensions of the PSO algorithm is the number of poles multiplied by three (\u03c9n, \u03b3n, and 1\u03b5n). The velocity of the particles is determined by\nvi+1n = \u03c9 \u00b7 v i n + C1 \u00b7 rand() \u00b7 (pBest i n \u2212 x i n)\n+C2 \u00b7 rand() \u00b7 (gBestin \u2212 x i n), (7)\nwhere vi+1n is a subsequent velocity of each particle in nth dimension, which determines the next position of each particle in nth dimension (x in). \u03c9 is an inertia constant, and C1 and C2 are the cognitive and social constant, respectively, where both the cognitive and social constants are set to 2. rand() is a random number generation function, and pBest and gBest are a particle best position and a global best position found in\nthe previous iterations. To evaluate the fitness of the particles, we define the figure of merit function (F) as follow:\n\u03b6< = \u2211 \u03c9 <[\u03b5Dat.(\u03c9)\u2212 \u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)] <[\u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)+ \u03be ]\n(8)\n\u03b6= = \u2211 \u03c9 =[\u03b5Dat.(\u03c9)\u2212 \u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)] =[\u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)+ \u03be ]\n(9)\nF = \u03b6< + \u03b6=, (10)\nwhere \u03b6 is a summation of error between frequency-dependent dielectric constants of the experimental data and Lorentz equation, and <, = indicate the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constants, respectively. Constant \u03be is an additional parameter to prevent divergence of the figure-of-merit function when the permittivity of the data crosses zero. It has zero value for Si3N4 and SiC, while we gradually increase \u03be for other materials until the fitting error is minimized. The PSO algorithm tries to minimize F by adjusting particles\u2019 velocities based on Eq. 7.\nThe number of Lorentz poles is first set to one; then, we gradually increase the number of the poles until the error (F) satisfies a terminate condition. Increasing the number of Lorentz poles adds a computational burden [43] in the ADE-FDTD method [51] and escalates the complexity of the fitting problem. Therefore, we present our dielectric fitting results within five Lorentz poles, even though 10 to 15 poles demonstrate better accuracy. Table 1 shows\n40846 VOLUME 10, 2022\noptimized Lorentz parameters for each material with four to five Lorentz poles. Figure 2 shows dispersion complex curve fitting [52] of radiative cooling materials, optimized by the PSO algorithm. The optimized Lorentz curves show minimal errors for TiO2, Si3N4, and SiC while SiO2 shows slight error on 9 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m in its real part. This can be improved further by employing 10 to 15 Lorentz poles; however, we limit our fitting up to five poles tomake a consistent computational load. Plus, other experimental permittivity data for SiO2 [44], [53], [54] demonstrate slightly different dielectric constants on 9 \u00b5m\u201310 \u00b5m; therefore, it might be unnecessary to overfitting one specific experimental data. We also compare the quality of our fitting against the most widely used evolutionary algorithms (Conventional Genetic Algorithm, Conventional Particle Swarm Optimization) as shown in Tab 2.We assume that the conventional PSO and the conventional GA algorithms have a figure of merit (F) given by F = \u2211 \u03c9 [\u03b5Dat.(\u03c9)\u2212\u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)] [\u03b5Lorentz(\u03c9)] ."

            "text": "This section presents numerical examples to validate our dispersion curve fitting of the radiative cooling materials.\nWe implement Lorentz parameters to MEEP [48], opensource FDTD solver, and simulate with a finite thickness of the dielectric slab. The FDTD time step is assigned by 1t = Cn1s/c0 where Cn is a courant number with values between 0 to 1,1S is a spatial step size, which is often called a grid spacing, and c0 is a speed of light. We use 1s = \u03bbmin/50 and Cn = 0.5. 5-\u00b5m and 2-\u00b5m-thick of the dielectric slabs are simulated with the FDTD method as shown in Fig. 3. Transmission of the incidence wave is calculated by accumulating the Fourier-transformed electric andmagnetic fields for all points in the flux plane through the summation up to nth discrete time step:\nf\u0303 (\u03c9) = 1 \u221a 2\u03c0 \u2211 n ej\u03c9n1t f (n1t)1t\n\u2248 1 \u221a 2\u03c0\n\u222b ej\u03c9t f (t) dt, (11)\nwhere f\u0303 (\u03c9) is a Fourier transformed field, 1t is the FDTD time step, and f (t) is a time-domain field. At the end of the simulation, these Fourier-transformed fields are used to\nVOLUME 10, 2022 40847\n40848 VOLUME 10, 2022\ncompute the integral of the Poynting vectors to produce frequency-dependent transmission.\nThe red dots indicate Fourier-transformed FDTD simulation results, while the black curves indicate theoretical calculation based on TMM [19]. Analytic transmission through TMM can be calculated by\nT = 1 S11 = E+ E+0 , (12)\nwhere\nS =\n[ S11 S12\nS21 S22\n] , (13)\nin Eq. 12, E+0 is the global electric field, and E+ is the transmitted electric field. In Eq. 13, S is the global scattering matrix. Note that there is a slight error on the transmission of the TiO2 dielectric slab shown in Fig. 3(a). This error can be improved with 10 Lorentz poles.\nTo understand emissivity of radiative cooling materials, one may need to calculate angle-dependent absorptivity of the materials. Then, we can apply Kirchhoff\u2019s law, which states that, for a body in equilibrium, the emissivity is equal to the absorptivity at each frequency and polarization [55]\u2013[57]. Alternative methods utilize uncorrelated white-noise sources [55], [58] or trace formulation [59] to Maxwell\u2019s equation. In this work, we employ Kirchhoff\u2019s reciprocity to calculate the emissivity of the radiative cooling materials. The incidence planewave is excited at the top of the dielectric slabs, while transmission and reflection monitors are placed on both sides. Then, the absorptivity can be calculated via A = 1 \u2212 T \u2212 R. Kirchhoff\u2019s law states that absorptivity for an incidence planewave with a specific angle equals the emissivity to that angle. Now, to analyze angle-dependent emissivity over the MIR regime, we excite a Bloch boundary planewave with different wavenumbers\n(k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb) where k =\n\u221a\nk2x + k2y in two dimensions. The Bloch boundary only supports a single wavenumber for each dimension (e.g., kx , ky); thus, a single FDTD simulation with the specific Bloch boundary condition corresponds to different incidence angles at different frequencies.\nAngle(\u03b8)-dependent emissivity is shown in Fig. 4. We use TMM for an angle-dependent analytic calculation of the emissivity, as shown in Fig. 4(b,d,f,h). The simulated emissivity is calculated via oblique incident Bloch boundary planewaves (total 81 simulations) and then interpolated to generate surface plots shown in Fig. 4(a,c,e,g). The simulated angle-dependent emissivity matches the analytic calculations with less than 1% root mean square error. Note that the gray area shown in the simulated emissivity plots is not calculated because it requires a high-angle and a greater wavenumber, where both of them increase a required kx , which can exceed the wavenumber (k), meaning the nonpropagatingmode. This can be simulated by adjusting the center wavelength of the planewave source.\nA dielectric slab of SiO2 shows low emissivity in the 8.0 to 9.5\u00b5m wavelength range due to high reflectivity and the low absorption coefficient. To further improve the emission characteristic of SiO2, we design a 2D grating structure, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The grating or texturing structure improves the light coupling of thermal emission [33], decreasing reflection while redistributing the angular emission profile. Figure 5(a) shows a simulation structure, which includes 2-\u00b5msize SiO2 based grating. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the simulated broadband angle-dependent emission shows that 8.0 to 9.5\u00b5m wavelength emissivity is greatly improved compared with a planar SiO2 structure shown in Fig. 4(g). The angle-dependent emissivity shown in this work provides a pathway to accurately model and engineer novel micro/nanostructures for radiative cooling studies. Thus, we believe that this result can be applied to developing advanced radiative cooling strategies. For a realization of\nVOLUME 10, 2022 40849\nthis structure, one can use a holographic technique with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser [60] or utilize a commercially available SiO2 grating product.\nIV. CONCLUSION We have modeled dispersive media used in radiative cooling applications for FDTD simulations. The PSO method is used to determine multipole Lorentz parameters for TiO2, Si3N4, SiC, SiO2 materials. Four to five Lorentz poles are used for modeling radiative cooling materials. Then, the modeling results are validated against theoretical calculations based on the transfer matrixmethod. Then, multiple FDTD simulations predict the angle-dependent broadband response of the radiative cooling materials. Finally, we simulate the SiO2 grating structure to improve a planar SiO2 emissivity. The proposed dispersion model may provide a path to efficiently discover an advanced radiative cooling structure.\nREFERENCES [1] W. Wu, S. Lin, M. Wei, J. Huang, H. Xu, Y. Lu, and W.
