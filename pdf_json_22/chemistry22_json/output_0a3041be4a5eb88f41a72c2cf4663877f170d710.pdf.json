    "abstractText": "Translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) substrates through the ribosome during protein synthesis, an exemplar of directional molecular movement in biology, entails a complex interplay of conformational, compositional, and chemical changes. The molecular determinants of early translocation steps have been investigated rigorously. However, the elements enabling the ribosome to complete translocation and reset for subsequent protein synthesis reactions remain poorly understood. Here, we have combined molecular simulations with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging to gain insights into the rate-limiting events of the translocation mechanism. We find that diffusive motions of the ribosomal small subunit head domain to hyper-swivelled positions, governed by universally conserved rRNA, can maneuver the mRNA and tRNAs to their fully translocated positions. Subsequent engagement of peptidyl-tRNA and disengagement of deacyl-tRNA from mRNA, within their respective small subunit binding sites, facilitate the ribosome resetting mechanism after translocation has occurred to enable protein synthesis to resume.

The molecular determinants of early translocation steps have been investigated rigorously. However, the elements enabling the ribosome to complete translocation and reset for subsequent protein synthesis reactions remain poorly understood. Here, we have combined molecular simulations with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging to gain insights into the rate-limiting events of the translocation mechanism. We find that diffusive motions of the ribosomal small subunit head domain to hyper-swivelled positions, governed by universally conserved rRNA, can maneuver the mRNA and tRNAs to their fully translocated positions. Subsequent engagement of peptidyl-tRNA and disengagement of deacyl-tRNA from mRNA, within their respective small subunit binding sites, facilitate the ribosome resetting mechanism after translocation has occurred to enable protein synthesis to resume."

Protein production in the cell requires repetitive elongation cycles in which deacylated transfer RNA (deacyl-tRNA) and peptidyl-tRNA cargo, paired with messenger RNA (mRNA) (the tRNA2-mRNA module), move directionally through the aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P) and exit (E) binding sites of the ribosome (70S in prokaryotes; 80S in eukaryotes). These tRNA binding sites, which are comprised of both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins, form by the union of the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits (30S and 50S in prokaryotes; 40S and 60S in eukaryotes). Deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA reside within the P and A sites of the pre-translocation ribosome complex (PRE) and move to E and P sites,\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Accurate and rapid movement of the tRNA2mRNA module is critical to both translation fidelity and cell growth, a fact underscored by the multitude of smallmolecule antibiotics that target the translocation process (1,2).\nThe translocation mechanism, while an intrinsic property of the PRE complex, is dramatically accelerated (\u223c1,000\u2013 50,000-fold) by the essential G protein, elongation factor G (EF-G) in bacteria (eEF2 in eukaryotes) (3,4). EF-G hydrolyses GTP during translocation and coordinates the large-scale intramolecular rearrangements that enable the precise movement of the tRNA2-mRNA module by a single mRNA codon. In so doing, EF-G helps maintain the correct reading frame between the genome and proteome (4\u201334).\nTranslocation intermediates, as well as fully translocated (POST) ribosome complexes, have been structurally resolved over a range of spatial resolutions using a variety of biochemical systems and techniques (5\u201314). Nomenclature used to describe EF-G-bound ribosome conformations and intermediates of translocation is correspondingly complex (i.e. PRE 1\u20135, TIPRE, TIPOST, chimeric (CHI) states, INT 1\u20133 etc.) (5,8,11,12,15,34\u201340). Such translocation intermediates\u2013\u2013defined here as the states adopted after peptide bond formation and up to the fully translocated (POST) ribosome complexes after EF-G release \u2013 can be interpreted as conformations adopted on a translocation energy landscape (Figure 1A) (32). The principal degrees of freedom on this rugged, EF-G-directed landscape include changes in the positioning of all three SSU domains (body, head, and platform) with respect to the LSU. These include SSU head domain swivel (SSU head domain movement in the direction of translocation relative to the SSU body domain) and a variety of altered tRNA positions both with respect to each other, as well as the SSU and LSU domains. Such states include the PRE-classical (PRE-C) conformation (in which the SSU is unrotated (non-rotated) with respect to the LSU), deacyl-/PRE-hybrid 1 (PRE-H1)/PREhybrid 2 (PRE-H2)/(PRE1-5) basin, the INT1/TIPRE basin, the INT2/chimeric (CHI1-3)/TIPOST basin, INT3, and the post translocation (CHI4/CHI5/POST) basin. For clarity, we will refer to these as PRE, INT1, INT2, INT3 and POST, based on the configuration of the SSU arrangement.\nA structurally and kinetically integrated translocation framework, derived from single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and high-resolution (\u223c2.7 A\u030a) cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) investigations, postulates that INT1 represents a rapidly-transited EF-G bound ribosome conformation defined by complete and partial translocation of deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA with respect to the LSU, respectively, a \u2018fully\u2019 clockwise rotated (\u223c10\u25e6) SSU relative to the LSU, and a partially swivelled SSU head domain (6,8,15). The more slowly transited INT2 conformational basin exhibits partially reversed SSU body rotation, a translocation-promoting swivel of the SSU head domain relative to the SSU body, and fully translocated positions of both tRNAs with respect to the LSU (8,15). The anticodon stem loop domains (ASLs)\nof deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA within the tRNA2-mRNA module make their largest movement relative to the SSU body in the INT1 to INT2 transition, achieving positions that are translocated by approximately two-thirds of a single mRNA codon. Rate-limiting passage from the INT2 basin to POST occurs via the highly transient INT3 intermediate that brings the tRNA ASLs to their final translocated positions with respect to the SSU body (15,41). The completion of translocation returns the SSU body and head domains to their fully unrotated and unswivelled positions, respectively. This transition includes events that promote EF-G(GDP) dissociation from the POST complex. These final translocation steps reset the ribosome to continue subsequent translation elongation reactions.\nAn important feature of this structural and kinetic framework of translocation is that the rate-limiting transition from INT2 to POST entails reversible INT3 sampling from the relatively stable INT2 basin within the EF-G(GDP) bound ribosome complex (15). INT2 to INT3 transitions are hypothesized to be diffusive, spontaneous events involving \u2018exaggerated\u2019 or \u2018hyper\u2019 swivel motions of the SSU head domain that facilitate positioning of the peptidyltRNA and mRNA pair into the SSU P site (8,15). By contrast, others have hypothesized that tilting motions of the SSU head away from the SSU body domain resolve the transitions from INT2 to the POST state along an axis perpendicular to head swivel (15,42). The nature of these late translocation events remains to be elucidated. In the present investigations, we utilize molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore whether one or both conformational processes are required for the penultimate step of translocation.\nMD simulations have previously been successful at describing ribosome motions and associated free energies (43\u2013 45). Coupling insights from MD and smFRET has proven particularly powerful for delineating atomistic descriptions of transition paths between metastable states and the physical underpinnings of rate-limiting transition states (46\u2013 52). Using all non-hydrogen atom MD simulations, we show here that the experimentally observed INT2-to-INT3 and INT3-to-POST transitions can be parsimoniously explained by hyper-swivel motions of the SSU head domain within the EF-G-bound ribosome complex. Hyper-swivel of the SSU head domain extends the predominant axis of motion, evidenced in early translocation steps. Hyperswivel is made sterically feasible by narrowly constrained corridors composed of both rRNA and ribosomal proteins that are highly conserved. The scissor-like intramolecular conformational change between the SSU head and body domains enables deacyl-tRNA to disengage mRNA in the E site and ensures proper positioning and engagement of peptidyl-tRNA in the P site. In addition to its likely underpinning of the rate-limiting translocation step observed by smFRET (15), these findings suggest that diffusive SSU head domain motions play a key role in the proposed Brownian ratchet mechanism. More specifically, our findings suggest that diffusive SSU head domain motions enable INT3 passage within the EF-G(GDP) bound ribosome complex to facilitate ribosome resetting to the POST state and continued protein synthesis.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 1.

Nucleotide and protein sequences were mutated in visual molecular dynamics (VMD) to match E. coli (53) or homology modeled as previously described (54,55). All corresponding models contained the E. coli sequence for rRNA and proteins without nucleotide modifications. The deacyl-tRNA in all models was unmodified tRNAMet and the tRNA in the position of the peptidyl-tRNA was unmodified tRNAPhe. The encoding mRNA maintained the sequence 5\u2032-GGUAAAAAUGUUUAAAAAA-3\u2032. Clashes between the LSU and EF-G were resolved with simulated annealing performed in NAMD 2.12 by incrementally increasing the temperature of the region local to the clashes by 10 K for 40 steps until 1000 K was achieved (56). The structure was then relaxed through the steepest descent energy minimizations using NAMD 2.12 with CHARMM C36 force fields for 500 steps (56,57).\nINT3 structures were modeled by restraining the coordinates of the SSU body and rotating the head domain beyond the INT2 position, along the same rotational axis as the INT1-to-INT2 head swivel rotation. Under these conditions, RMSD restraints were imposed on the SSU body, LSU, L1, tRNA, EF-G and mRNA, treating each as rigid bodies (for the initial starting structure for fully flexible bodies in molecular dynamics simulations) to produce the hyper-swivelled state (Supplementary Table S1). Each RMSD restraint was applied to the P and C5\u2032 atoms for RNA and C atoms for proteins. Distance restraints for H-bonds were applied considering stereochemistry (donoracceptor atoms and hydrogen atoms) and a 3.5 A\u030a cutoff distance, where H-bond angles were not restricted. Restraint weights were assigned to reflect the relative rigidity of the molecule. For example, intramolecular interactions within ribosomal subunits are more stable than the intramolecular interactions within tRNA. Iterative refinement of the restraints was performed to achieve the hyper-swivelled state. To define the axis of rotation between the domains, we considered only residues of the core of the body and head to rotate the head of the SSU relative to the body, described previously (42) (Supplementary Table S2). To obtain the hyper-swivel of the INT3 model, we used NAMD 2.12(56) with CHARMM C36 force fields (57) to perform minimization (1200 steps), equilibration (40 000 steps), and targeted MD simulations (100 000 steps) and using restraints with PLUMED2(58), listed in Supplementary Table S1. In these simulations a timestep and cut-off distances of 2 fs and 12.0 A\u030a, respectively, were used. Temperature was maintained at 300 K and Generalized Born Implicit Solvent model (GBIS) (59) was used. These parameters were implemented in targeted MD simulations, maintaining restraints outlined in Supplementary Table S1 to produce MD simulations consistent with smFRET studies. Using targeted MD simulations and restraints, we created five models with different head swivel angles ranging from 16 to 24\u25e6 differing by 2\u25e6.\nPreparation of FRET dyes for simulations\nTo simulate the smFRET experiment as described in Wasserman et al. (15), we modeled 5 FRET dyes (Cy3, Cy5 and LD550, LD650, LD750) using Avogadro 1.2.0 (60). Parameters for each dye were constructed correspond-\ning to the SMOG-v2 protocol (61), the peptide backbone, fluorophore linker and fluorophore were treated as single molecules. These treatments of fluorophores were previously used to recapitulate smFRET data (48) and provide a highly dynamic molecule. Cy3 and Cy5 were attached to the tRNAs at s4U8 by maleimide-thiol chemistry, or acp3U47 by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester crosslinker. LD550, LD650 and LD750 were anchored to S13(N-Sfp), L1(T202C) or L5(N-Acp), EF-G (C-Sfp), respectively as described in Wasserman et al. (15).\nAll non-hydrogen atom structure-based simulations\nOur structure-based MD simulations used an adapted structural based model from Whitford et al. (62). Coordinate and topology files for simulations were generated from PDBs using the SMOG2.0 source code (61). The force field is defined based on the model structure and the structure is assured to be a global potential minimum. The simulation we performed using the potential defined by:\nV = \u2211 bonds \u03b5r 2 (ri \u2212 ri,o)2 + \u2211 angles \u03b5\u03b8 2 (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i,o)2\n+ \u2211 impropers \u03b5\u03c7 i 2 (\u03c7i \u2212 \u03c7i,o)2 + \u2211 planar \u03b5\u03c7p 2 (\u03c7i \u2212 \u03c7i,o)2\n+ \u2211 backbone \u03b5BB FD (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6i,o) + \u2211 sidechains \u03b5SC FD (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6i,o) + \u2211 contacts C [( \u03c3i j ri j )12 \u2212 2 ( \u03c3i j ri j )6] + \u2211 non\u2212contacts \u03b5NC ( \u03c3NC ri j )12\nwhere,\n\u03b5FD (\u03c6) = \u03b5 (1 \u2212 cos\u03c6) + \u03b52 (1 \u2212 cos 3\u03c6) where \u03b5r = 50 \u03b50, \u03b5\u03b8 = 40 \u03b50, \u03b5\u03c7 i = 10 \u03b50, \u03b5\u03c7p = 40 \u03b50, \u03b5NC = 0.1 \u03b50, \u03c3NC = 2.5 A\u030a and \u03b50 = 1. To simulate the flexible characteristics of dyes, the non-contact terms and first term of dihedral angle for linker and dye interaction were eliminated in the structural based model (corresponding \u03b5BB, \u03b5SC, \u03b5C in the equation are set as 0). We removed the dye involving non-contacts interactions from ones generated with Shadow Algorithm (63).\nAll simulations were performed using Gromacs v2018.1 (64,65) as the MD engine and PLUMED2 (58) for restraints and the structure-based model for the force field (66). The temperature was maintained at 0.5 in reduced units using Langevin dynamics as performed previously to maintain RMSF values consistent with explicit solvent simulations performed at 300 K (48,50,67)."

Similarly, residues A977, U1298 and A1374 of the SSU head were used to define a plane to measure the head swivel and head tilt angles. The angles were calculated using VMD v1.9.3 as previously described (42,53). All distance measurements for the MD simulations, or from the PDB data set, were performed using the GROMACS v2018.1 g dist package (64).

            "text": "Hyper-swivel motions involved in the structural transitions for translocation resetting\nPre-steady state smFRET measurements of EF-G catalysed translocation have led to the hypotheses (i) that movement of peptidyl-tRNA into the P site is the rate-limiting feature\nof the translocation mechanism and (ii) that barrier crossing to the fully translocated POST state likely requires an exaggerated, hyper-swivel motion of the SSU head domain (15). The fluorophores employed for these investigations were positioned on the N-termini of ribosomal proteins uS13 and uL5 via short peptide tags (Figure 1B\u2013D) (15). As this labelling strategy adds uncertainties to the precise FRETdistance relationship, it was previously not possible to unambiguously discern whether the observed change in FRET was due to hyper-swivel or a tilting motion (42) of the SSU head domain away from the LSU (Supplementary Figure S1).\nHyper-swivel of the SSU head domain was, however, previously proposed as the most parsimonious model to explain the INT3 intermediate observed by smFRET, as such motion would represent a continuation of the headswivel trajectory in the INT1-to-INT2 transition accompanying movement of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module during early translocation. In this view, return of the head domain to the unswivelled position would only require disengagement from the deacyl-tRNA and reverse swivel motions rather than an orthogonal tilting of the head away from its prior trajectory of motion and the LSU. While relatively small extents of SSU head domain tilting (<4\u25e6) away from the LSU have been documented in prokaryotic systems (Supplementary Figure S2), SSU head domain tilt requires a switch in the dominant axis of motion and as shown below, would require a head tilt motion (\u223c12\u25e6). SSU head domain tilt would also be insufficient to contribute to required directional movements of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module without additional action from other features of the EFG bound ribosome complex.\nWe considered published, experimentally determined structures with similar head-swivel, intersubunit rotations, and mRNA positioning as PRE-like, INT1-like, INT2-like or POST-like for this analysis (Supplementary Table S3 and Methods). To examine the feasibility of the hyperswivel model, we extended the swivel-like motions inferred from the INT1-like and INT2-like structural models. In the INT1-like ribosome structure, the SSU is highly rotated, the A/P configuration of peptidyl-tRNA retains codonanticodon interactions in the A site of the SSU, as is expected at the time of initial EF-G(GTP) engagement. The 3\u2032-CCA end was modeled as having canonical interactions with the P loop of the LSU 23S rRNA (Methods). tRNA positions have been successfully modeled before high-resolution structures were available (69,70) and have become progressively more accurate (71,72). During preparation of this work, a high-resolution INT1-like structure captured by the antibiotic spectinomycin was reported (PBD-ID: 7N2V) (8). Comparison between our model and this experimentally derived cryo-EM model indicate high similarity, with an RMSD of 0.83 A\u030a. The major deviations between the two reflect an observed shift of peptidyltRNA 3\u20136 A\u030a closer to the E site that arises from EF-G\u2019s displacement of its ASL from the SSU decoding center. Highresolution cryo-EM maps of the INT2 state have also been made available recently (PBD-IDs: 7N2C (8), 7SSW, 7SSD, 7SS9 (14) and 7PJY (13)), which have an RMSD of 1.0\u20131.8 A\u030a to our model. We therefore posit that the computationally developed models serve as robust starting points for equili-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nbration and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations to define the rotational axes for SSU head domain swivel and SSU body rotation (Figure 1E and Methods).\nTo model the INT3 state, we extended the amplitudes of both head domain swivel and body rotation motions from the trajectory derived for the INT1-to-INT2 transition (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure S3 and Methods). We simulated the INT3 transition using all nonhydrogen atom structure-based simulations. During these simulations, we maintained observed interactions between the mRNA codon and tRNA anticodon and between the 3\u2032-CCA ends of tRNAs and the LSU (Supplementary Table S1) (73). Simulations of this kind consider the steric feasibility of achieving a hyper-swivel state, while maintaining parameters such as dihedral angles in addition to bond distances and angles. Atomistic models of the donor (LD550) and acceptor (LD650) fluorophores were attached according to their specific chemistries and peptide tags to the N-termini of proteins uS13 and uL5, respectively (Figure 1B\u2013D) (15). Simulating the precise points of attachment within the system allowed us to examine how well their positions recapitulate previous smFRET experiments, including whether hyper-swivel INT3-like trajectories yield time-averaged, inter-fluorophore distances consistent with the experimentally evidenced FRET values (15).\nMeasurements of SSU rotation typically assume a fixed LSU. However, in this reference frame, it is difficult to distinguish between rotation of the SSU body from swivel motions of the SSU head (intramolecular head swivel). To clearly isolate head swivel from intersubunit rotation, we employed a coordinate system wherein the SSU body is fixed. This treatment results in an alternative coordinate system where the LSU rotates counter-clockwise relative to the SSU during transitions from classical PRE-to-INT1, and clockwise relative to the SSU during transitions from INT1-to-INT2. As simulations using this alternative coordinate system were initiated from the INT1 model, we considered the intersubunit rotation and head-swivel angles of this state as the reference (Supplementary Table S3). Using a previously described approach (42,74), we determined ribosome rotation angles based on a reference plane defined by three atoms of the INT1 state and then by mapping the same plane onto the structure of interest (Materials and Methods). An analogous approach also allowed determination of the head-tilt axis, the results of which yielded identical values to Euler\u2013Rodrigues calculations (40,42). Comparing available ribosome structures to INT1 and with the fixed SSU body coordinate system, we observed that the fully rotated (0\u25e6 in our coordinate system) INT1 model transitioned to the INT2 state through a two-thirds return (\u223c8\u25e6) of the LSU towards the non-rotated state (Supplemental\nTable 3). At the same time, the SSU head swivelled \u223c14\u25e6 in the direction of translocation (Figure 1E).\nExperimental data are closely recapitulated by hyper-swivel motions of the SSU head domain\nWe examined the hyper-swivel model of the INT2-to-INT3 transition by creating eight ribosome models with SSU head domain swivel angles increasing in 2\u25e6 increments over a range of 14\u201326\u25e6 (Supplementary Figure S3). We performed\nequilibrium simulations at each angle increment. This study revealed that a head hyper-swivel angle between 20\u25e6 and 22\u25e6 yielded an LD550(uS13)\u2013LD650(uL5) inter-dye distance of 61.8 \u00b1 17.5 and 68.5 \u00b1 16.1 A\u030a, respectively. A separation of this magnitude is consistent with smFRET data (Table 1, Supplementary Table S4), suggesting that the INT2-to-INT3 transition may be explained by a hyperswivel model where the SSU head domain swivels by an additional 6\u20138\u25e6 beyond that which is observed in the modeled INT2-like state. During preparation of this manuscript late-translocation intermediates were resolved by cryo-EM with and without EF-G (PDB IDs: 7SS9, 7SSW), where the tRNA ASLs have been translocated further than their INT2-like conformations (14). Using the alternative fixed SSU reference, this ribosome conformation had a headswivel of 15.4\u201316.1\u25e6 and intersubunit rotation of 11.0\u25e6, indicating it is likely a conformation on route to the hyper-swivel head-swivel of 20\u201322\u25e6 (Supplementary Table S3). This is further supported by the deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA being translocated \u223c8 and \u223c2 A\u030a, respectively, further through the ribosome in the INT3 model in comparison to this late translocation intermediate, further validating our hyperswivel INT3 model.\nTo validate that the simulated models are representative of the smFRET data, we performed restraint-free equilibrium simulations of ribosome complexes in the INT1, INT2, INT3 (20\u201322\u25e6 head-swivel), and POST states conjugated to FRET dyes to exhaustively sample the FRET dye configurations (Figure 1B\u2013D). In each case, the measured distances between the centers of mass for LD550 and LD650 were found to be in good agreement with the interdye distances measured in the smFRET experiments (Table 1, Supplementary Table S4). This recapitulation of the smFRET data was lost when considering only the C \u2013C distances between the sites of dye attachment (Supplementary Table S4) (7.7\u201324 A\u030a differences compared to smFRET measurements), emphasizing that it is important to include linkers and dyes to match experimentally measured smFRET data, as we have done in this study. This difference is likely explained by the extended flexible peptide linkers between the fluorophores and their sites of attachment on the ribosome (Figure 1D).\nTo compare the SSU hyper-swivel and head tilting models for INT3, we performed equilibrated simulations of the ribosome with different head swivel and tilt angles. As described above, the hyper-swivelled INT3 conformation was defined as an extension of the SSU head domain swivel motion observed in the INT1-to-INT2 transition (Supplementary Figure S4, top). The previously hypothesized SSU head tilting (42) requires an additional degree of freedom in head motion away from the LSU (Supplementary Figures S1, S4, bottom). In the INT2 structures, deacyl-tRNA is positioned to sterically block reverse swivel of the head domain via interactions between the anticodon arm of the tRNA and the PE loop (G1338\u2013U1341) of the 16S rRNA of the SSU head domain. A significant tilting motion of the SSU head domain would thus allow the head to traverse over a statically positioned deacyl-tRNA to allow reverse head-swivel (42). We observed that a tilt angle of \u223c12\u25e6 was required for the PE loop within the SSU head domain to navigate past deacyl-tRNA (Supplementary Figure S5), in\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nline with previous findings (42). At the apex of tilting motion, we estimated the inter-dye distance to be \u223c48.0 \u00b1 11.4 A\u030a (Table 1), substantially smaller in amplitude than the inter-fluorophore distance (61.0 \u00b1 3.6 A\u030a) estimated by smFRET and by simulated hyper-swivel motion (61.8 \u00b1 17.5 A\u030a). SSU rolling, observed in stalled prokaryotic (75,76) or eukaryotic ribosomes (77), could also contribute to interfluorophore distance changes. However, SSU rolling would result in a closure of the E site and thus a reduction in the inter-fluorophore distance at their sites of attachment. Correspondingly, changes in SSU head domain swivel or tilt angles are required to explain the observed smFRET data and we find that hyper-swivel motions produce distances significantly more consistent with smFRET compared to distance estimates based on head tilt motion.\nHyper-swivel is sterically constrained by ribosomal elements to a maximum of \u223c22\u25e6 We next analysed the steric hindrances associated with the 20\u201322\u25e6 hyper-swivel angle needed to recapitulate the smFRET data and to elucidate physical limitations of the hyper-swivel motion (Supplementary Table S5). The most obvious steric barriers to SSU head domain motions arose at extreme swivel angles (>22\u25e6), where ribosomal proteins uS2 and uS5 in the SSU body and head domain, respectively, came into physical contact (Figure 2A, B). At SSU head domain swivel angles >22\u25e6, we also observed steric clashes at intersubunit bridges B5 and B2a/d (Figure 2C), as well as within the 16S rRNA between the loops of SSU helix (h) 1 in the body domain and h36 in the head domain (Figure 2D, E). Hence, energetically unfavourable remodelling events and conformational deviations in these regions would be required to overcome such clashes. These steric interactions represent a natural \u2018stopper\u2019 to head swivel motion, preventing large overshoots. We note in this context that head-swivel angles up to 20\u201322\u25e6 correlated with additional SSU body back rotation in the simulations beyond that observed in the INT1-INT2 transition (Figure 2F). This finding is consistent with an observed correlation between the ratio of intersubunit rotation angle to head-swivel angle (\u223c0.53) in all known intermediate states of translocation (Figure 2F). We therefore conclude that steric clashes within the ribosome provide physical barriers to head domain swivel angles significantly beyond 22\u25e6. Notably, swivel angles of 20\u201322\u25e6 were accompanied by the formation of interactions between the deacyl-tRNA and the E loop (h23, nucleotides G691\u2013A695) of the SSU body, a region of interest for development of novel peptide nucleic acid therapeutics (Figure 2G, H) (78). Such interactions, described in\nmore detail below, were previously considered characteristic features of the POST state. As such, the E loop provides an additional steric constraint to the head-swivel angle as it limits head domain-guided movements of the tRNA2\u2013 mRNA module.\nCorrect positioning of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module on the SSU body is completed by hyper-swivel\nPrecise translocation is a key factor in maintaining the translation reading frame and thus the fidelity of protein synthesis. The INT3 state has been hypothesized to be instrumental in correctly positioning the peptidyl-tRNA anticodon in the ribosomal P site to complete translocation (41). To investigate the contributions of hyperswivel to translocation and to further understand the physical alterations in the ribosome accompanying the simulated INT3 conformation, we further assessed the tRNA2\u2013 mRNA module positioning during the INT2-to-INT3 transition.\nTo determine the extent of translocation in published structures of prokaryotic or eukaryotic ribosomes (5\u20139,11\u2013 14,20,34,75,79\u201392), we measured the distance between the middle nucleotide of the A-site codon to the entrance of the E site (gate produced between the center of mass of nucleotides U789 and A1503 of the 16S rRNA) (Figure 3A, B). INT1 states and other translocation intermediates in this analysis were supplemented with ribosome conformations with similar intersubunit and head-domain swivel rotations (Supplementary Table S3) (5,6,8,20,75,80,88\u201391). Using this measure, we observed the expected 3-nucleotide translocation of the mRNA between PRE and POST (Figure 3B). By the same metric, translocation of the mRNA at the A site was decomposed into a 2.4-nucleotide movement (INT1-to-INT2) and a 0.6-nucleotide movement (INT2-toPOST) (Figure 3B). This decomposition was maintained regardless of where translocation was measured from with respect to the ribosome (Figure 3B). In this analysis, we observed a clear correlation between the mRNA position and the head swivel angle (Figure 3C), where the tRNA2\u2013 mRNA module transited the final 0.6-nucleotide distance in continuous contact with, and in the same direction as, the SSU head domain.\nTo understand how hyper-swivel SSU head domain motions facilitate the final 0.6-nucleotide movement necessary to complete translocation, we investigated the interactions between the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module and the ribosome. During hyper-swivel, interactions between the SSU head and deacyl-tRNA are maintained, as evidenced by stacking of the ASL with the SSU head residue m2G966\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 2.

(H) Measured distances between the closest nucleotide pairs between the E loop and deacyl-tRNA. When in the closed position, G693 of the E loop and the adjacent nucleotide to the anticodon in deacyl-tRNA interact.\n(Figure 3D\u2013G). As the INT3 conformation is achieved, deacyl-tRNA comes into direct contact with the nearly universally conserved G693 nucleotide at the tip of the E loop through \u2013 stacking interactions (Figure 3H, I, Table 2, Supplementary Figure S6). This finding is consistent with the SSU E loop providing a physical barrier to further head-swivel rotations (above). Additionally, the 3\u2032- nucleotide of the P-site mRNA codon formed \u2013 stacking interactions with the highly conserved C1400 residue (Figure 3H, Table 2), consistent with POST-like positioning of the peptidyl-tRNA anticodon relative to the SSU body domain in the simulated INT3 model. These points of contact specifically formed after reaching the INT3 conformation and were maintained through the POST state (Figure 3H). Correspondingly, we conclude that INT3 formation, resulting from a continuation of both SSU head domain swivel and SSU body domain reverse rotation, would be sufficient to complete translocation of the tRNA2-\nmRNA module to canonical E/E and P/P positions (Video 1).\nConserved rRNA elements serve as steric checkpoints for reverse head-swivel\nIn view of these findings, we conclude that interactions governing the SSU head-domain swivel process are expected to contribute to the barrier between the INT3 and POST states. This consideration brings to attention three 16S rRNA elements of the SSU head domain that are positioned to guide the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module during translocation: the AP helix (h30, nucleotides C1227\u2013C1230 of the 16S rRNA), the AP loop (h30/31 nucleotides G954\u2013U957 of the 16S rRNA) and the PE loop. The AP and PE loops are positioned to lead the peptidyl- and deacyl-tRNA, respectively, while the AP-helix is situated to guide movement of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA substrate through its interactions with\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n/nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nTable 2.

In published INT2 structures and our simulated INT2 and INT3 models, the universally conserved G1338 and A1339 nucleotides of the PE loop maintained specific, non-canonical base pairing interactions with the minor groove of the deacyl-tRNA ASL (Figure 4A) (5,11,12,34). During SSU head domain swivel from 14\u25e6 to 22\u25e6, the AP helix and the AP loop \u2013 which both contain nucleotides that are universally conserved in all domains of life apart from mitochondria \u2013 also stayed in close contact with deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA, respectively (Figure 4A). When SSU head domain hyper-swivel angles of 20\u201322\u25e6 are achieved, the distance between the AP loop and deacyl-tRNA shortened, while the AP helix/PE loops maintained their contacts with tRNAs (Figure 4A\u2013D). Return of the SSU head domain to its unswivelled POST-like position requires that the PE and AP loops traverse the deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA, respectively (Figure 4A). During reverse SSU head-swivel and prior to EF-G(GDP) release, the AP loop interacts with domain IV of EF-G while the AP helix and PE loop engage peptidyl-tRNA (Figure 4A; Supplementary Figure S7). Hence, each of these conserved elements of the SSU head domain necessarily contribute to both forward movement of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module as well as the ribosome resetting mechanism compulsory for complete translocation.\nDeacyl-tRNA initiates disengagement at INT3 but can remain in the E-site cavity\nTo further examine how barriers imposed by the AP and PE loops may be overcome during the rate-limiting steps in the translocation process, we investigated how the positions of deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNA were altered in the INT3 state. During early translocation steps, the distance between the deacyl-tRNA anticodon and the E-site mRNA codon was approximately constant. By contrast, in INT3 hyper-swivel of the SSU head domain positioned deacyl-\ntRNA such that its codon-anticodon interactions were no longer fully formed (Figure 5A). To understand the relationship between E-site tRNA position and SSU head domain hyper-swivel, we examined a collection of published POST structures to find that the Watson-Crick base pairs between deacyl-tRNA and the mRNA codon within the E site were broken in all cases (Figure 5A). In each case, the 3\u2032-nucleotide in the deacyl-tRNA anticodon was unpaired from the 5\u2032-nucleotide in the mRNA codon.\nWe categorized the experimentally observed POST state E-site codon-anticodon interactions into four distinct configurations: long, flip, stack, and float (Figure 5A). We quantified the extent to which the deacyl-tRNA anticodonmRNA codon interaction was \u2018disengaged\u2019 versus \u2018dissociated\u2019 by measuring the distance between the tRNA center of mass and the E-site mRNA codon in experimentally observed structures at different stages of the translocation reaction coordinate and in our simulated INT3 structure (Figure 5B, C). We found that the distance between deacyl-tRNA and the E-site mRNA codon gradually increased during the transition from INT2-to-INT3 (Figure 5B), consistent with the 3\u2032- mRNA nucleotide disengaging from the tRNA ASL (Figure 5C). Deacyl-tRNA disengagement from mRNA further increased during the INT3-toPOST transition (Figure 5D). Hence, while deacyl-tRNA physically occupied the E site, formation of the INT3 state appeared to promote dislodging of deacyl-tRNA from the SSU E site, potentially initiating its ultimate dissociation from the ribosome.\nDeacyl-tRNA disengages through a hand-off between the L1 stalk and the E loop\nThe observed repositioning of deacyl-tRNA prompted us to investigate if and how such altered interactions impact deacyl-tRNA repositioning within the E site.

Interactions between the ribosome and the deacyl- and peptidyl-tRNAs limit reverse head-swivel. (A) The AP loop (954\u2013957), AP helix (1228\u2013 1230), and PE loop (1338\u20131341) in the SSU head domain all interaction with tRNA during different head swivel positions. The positions of the AP loop, AP helix, and PE loop with respect to the deacyl-tRNA (red) and peptidyl-tRNA (yellow) are shown at different swivel angles. Bases of the PE-loop (G1338, A1339) are flipped out to interact with translocating tRNA preventing reverse head-swivel, while AP loop-tRNA and AP helix-tRNA interactions are mainly backbone contacts. In the POST state, EF-G (green) is in close proximity to the AP loop. Nucleotide conservation is considered for three domains of life and chloroplasts, excluding mitochondria.

The deacyl-tRNA and PE loop maintain closer distances than the peptidyl-tRNA and AP loop.\ntRNA: (i) Helix 68 (H68) interactions with the 3\u2032-CCA end, (ii) PE loop interactions with the anticodon stem, (iii) L1 stalk interactions with the elbow domain, (iv) E loop interactions and (v) uS9 interactions with the anticodonmRNA codon pair (Figure 6A, B). From INT2-to-POST, the interactions of the 3\u2032-CCA end with H68 and the PE loop with the deacyl-tRNA anticodon stem remained similar (Figure 6A) (93). By contrast, contacts between the L1 stalk and deacyl-tRNA, which are critical to coordinating deacyl-tRNA movement, adjusted as translocation progressed (Figure 6D\u2013G) (93\u201398). During the PRE-C-to-PRE hybrid transition (tRNA moves from A/A P/P to A/P P/E positions), the L1 stalk moves into a closed position to contact the deacyl-tRNA elbow (89,93). In the INT2 state, the L1 stalk laterally shifts its position to a semi-closed position, maintaining its interactions with deacyl-tRNA as both shift away from the P site. In INT3, the L1 stalk continues to maintain contact with deacyl-tRNA by moving into a semi-open position, reflecting a midpoint between semiclosed INT2 and open POST positions (Figure 6D, H) (93). However, the nature of the L1 stalk interaction with deacyltRNA is altered (Figure 6C).\nIn light of prior cryo-EM investigations (99\u2013102), this finding suggests that the L1 stalk opens to compensate for reductions in distance between the E loop and deacyltRNA (Figure 6I, J). We therefore speculate that the observed changes in L1 stalk position, which nonetheless maintain direct contact with the elbow domain of deacyltRNA throughout translocation, are consistently adjusted\nand likely contribute to deacyl-tRNA disengagement from the E-site mRNA codon as translocation proceeds. Importantly, the consequent shifts in deacyl-tRNA position resulting from E-site mRNA disengagement and remodelling of the L1 stalk interactions with deacyl-tRNA enable the PE loop and SSU head domain to traverse deacyl-tRNA en route to its POST position without the need for SSU head domain tilting (Figure 4A). These findings are consistent with hyper-swivel motion of the SSU head domain repositioning deacyl-tRNA in the E site to facilitate reverse head swivel and ribosome resetting.\nINT3 positions peptidyl-tRNA to allow reverse head swivel\nThe AP loop proximity to the peptidyl-tRNA suggests that these interactions are a barrier to reverse head swivel, particularly in the INT2 complex. However, the simulated position of peptidyl-tRNA within the INT3 complex allowed the AP loop to narrowly pass the peptidyl-tRNA ASL during reverse head swivel, analogous to what we observed for the PE loop and disengaged deacyl-tRNA (Figure 4A, B). These analyses argue that deacyl-tRNA repositioning and disengagement from the E-site mRNA codon, as well as peptidyl-tRNA positioning within the P site, are critical components of the resetting mechanism. Perturbations of either would be expected to block progression along the translocation reaction coordinate to return to the system to the relatively stable INT2 basin (Supplementary Figure S8). In this context, we note that experimentally observed, re-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 5.

(D) Model of tRNA disengagement. Step1: Simultaneously, the mRNA and deacyl-tRNA are translocated together to the E site. Step2: Near a swivel angle of 18\u02da, G693 of the E loop loosely interacts with the nucleotide 5\u2032 of the anticodon in the tRNA. Step3: At the hyper-swivel 30S head angle, the E loop is engaged with the E-site tRNA and the 3\u2032-nucleotide of the codon is disengaged with the anticodon. Step4: The codon-anticodon interactions are completely disengaged but interactions between the E-site tRNA and ribosome are maintained.\nversible interconversions between the INT2 and INT3 states have been hypothesized to represent attempts at deacyland peptidyl-tRNA repositioning to enable ribosome resetting (15,41). Such an interpretation may explain how nearcognate interactions in the SSU P site stall translocation at late steps associated with INT3-barrier crossing and how elongation factor P (EF-P) binding alleviates this inhibition (41).\nImportantly, the barriers to translocation have been reported to be independent of deacyl-tRNA\u2019s presence on the ribosome (15,41). Hence, steric considerations alone, related to PE loop interactions with deacyl-tRNA, may be insufficient to explain the barrier between the INT3 and POST states. Ribosome resetting may also be limited by proper peptidyl-tRNA positioning within the SSU P site. By extension, peptidyl-tRNA recognition within the SSU P site during INT3 formation may represent a rate-limiting step required for reverse SSU head domain swivel and ribosome resetting (15,41). Taken together, our data is consistent with a framework where the ribosome limits hyperswivel movements of the head domain to properly position peptidyl-tRNA in the SSU P site as a fidelity checkpoint for translocation completion.\nRibosome components implicated in hyper-swivel are conserved\nThe significance of the hyper-swivelled INT3 state can be gleaned through the conservation of nucleotides involved in its adoption. Two thirds of the nucleotides associated with the hyper-swivel and ribosome resetting reaction coordinate are universally conserved (excluding mitochondria); only 3 nucleotides are not conserved (<90%) in the 3 domains of life and chloroplasts (Figure 7A, B, Supplementary Figure S9, Table 2). All nucleotides of the PE loop are universally conserved (Figure 7C, D, Table 2) (103,104), while mutations at position A1339 appear to be lethal to E. coli (105). Within the E loop, U692 is universally conserved across all domains of life, while G691/A695, G693 and A694 are >98%, 94% and 90% conserved, respectively (Figure 5C, D, Table 2). The base identity at position 693, which makes direct contact with the fully translocated deacyl-tRNA, has been shown to influence the rate of translation (106). Further, disruption of G693\u2032s interaction with mRNA by the antibiotics edeine and pactamycin inhibits translation initiation and translocation (107\u2013109). These findings reflect the importance of the identity of the nucleotide at the apex of the 690 loop to the translation mechanism.

Continuation along the reaction coordinates of SSU head domain swivel and reverse body rotation established during early steps in the translocation mechanism are sufficient to enable this movement (Supplementary Figure S10) (15). The present findings further suggest that ribosome resetting to an unrotated, unswivelled conformation in the POST state requires only modest adjustments in the position of deacyl-tRNA within the E site and recognition of peptidyl-tRNA in the P site. These considerations alleviate the need for energetically unfavorable and orthogonal SSU head domain motion, such as its tilting away from the LSU (42), during ribosome resetting. In the titling model, rescaling of the contacts between the head and body domains of the SSU may have artificially weakened the interactions between these domains to promote the tilting mechanism. In contrast, the hyper-swivel model positions the tRNAs to their final translocated position in a congruent motion that allows for reverse head swiveling and resetting of translocation. Such findings are consistent with smFRET data evidencing that the rate-limiting features of the translocation mechanism persist even after deacyl-tRNA has dissociated from the E site (15,41).\nA critical insight from our findings is that diffusive SSU head domain motions to hyper-swiveled positions con-\ntribute to the Brownian ratchet mechanism of translocation. In this view, thermally driven hyper-swivel head domain positions represent barrier crossing attempts at forward progression of tRNA2-mRNA module and peptidyltRNA engagement at the SSU P site. The E and AP loops serve as structural guides in this context to ensure fidelity during the final stages of tRNA2\u2013mRNA module movement. The E loop recognizes complete translocation of the tRNA2\u2013mRNA module and likely provides a physical barrier to motion that facilitates deacyl-tRNA disengagement from mRNA and its ultimate dissociation. The AP loop restricts ribosome resetting and the return of the SSU head domain to its unswivelled position until proper positioning of the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site after translocation.\nInterpreting the ribosome as a Brownian ratchet, the mRNA, which undergoes unidirectional motion through the ribosome, is analogous to the wheel of the ratchet, while the tRNAs act as the \u2018teeth\u2019 on the ratchet wheel. A unique feature of the ribosome ratchet system is that the teeth are detachable. That is, during protein synthesis, tRNA molecules\u2013\u2013deacylated by peptide bond formation\u2013\u2013ultimately detach from the mRNA and dissociate. In addition to the conformational changes in EF-G subsequent to inorganic phosphate release that facilitate the process of peptidyl-tRNA recognition in the P site, appropriate timing of deacyl-tRNA release from the E site of the ribosome after peptide bond formation must also be considered as a source of unidirectionality in translo-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nFigure 8.

In the INT2 state, the deacyl-tRNA is positioned in the P site on the 30S head and in between the P and E sites on the body. The deacyl-tRNA is guided forward in translocation by the A/P helix on the 30S head (APH, rRNA h30 positions 1228\u20131230). The deacyl-tRNA is positioned to sterically impede reverse head swivel through significant steric hinderance from the PE loop on the 30S head (PEL, rRNA positions 1338\u20131341, located in the junction between h29 and h42). In the INT3 state (\u2018hyper-swivel\u2019), the deacyl-tRNA resides in the SSU body E site and SSU head P site. Either dislodging of the deacyl-tRNA from its ribosomal contacts (at the anticodon and CCA end) or dissociation resolves the steric hinderance (denoted by salmon color), allowing for reverse head swivel. In the POST state, the peptidyl-tRNA reaches its final translocation position and the deacyl-tRNA can dissociate.\ncation and an essential part of the ratchet. The effective pawl (i.e. components that inhibit backwards motion in a Brownian ratchet mechanism) is highly complex. We infer from our findings that pawl contributions arise from a combination of the PE loop and A/P loop, in conjunction with peptidyl-tRNA recognition and deacyl-tRNA dissociation, facilitating a net-forward movement of the tRNA2mRNA module. Here, the interaction between the tRNA and the aforementioned components of the SSU head domain are analogous to the physical interactions between the wheel tooth and the pawl. The hinge region between the SSU head and body (neck) is analogous to the spring connected to the pawl, which may provide a restoring force when mRNA movement is complete. Together with steric \u2018stopper\u2019 restrictions (uS2, uS5, B5, B2a/d, h1 and h36), this contributes to the rising shape of the sawtooth in the ratchet wheel. The binding energies associated with peptidyl-tRNA recognition within the SSU P site upon complete translocation of mRNA, and the unidirectionality provided by deacyl-tRNA dissociation, represent the barrier imposed by the opposite side of the sawtooth that prevents backwards motion. The hyper-swivel model of translocation proposed provides a framework that is consistent with the ribosome as a Brownian ratchet (5,11,20,114,115).\nThe hyper-swivel model is also consistent with evidence of miscoding-induced stalling of peptidyl-tRNA translocation, which persists long after deacyl-tRNA dissociation and characterized by repetitive INT2-to-INT3 transitions to achieve complete translocation (41). In our MD simulations of cognate codon-anticodon interactions, the AP loop can narrowly traverse past peptidyl-tRNA during re-\nverse head-swivel. We therefore infer that slight perturbations to the position of the peptidyl-tRNA cargo, such as those expected to arise from miscoding (116), may lead to higher probability of steric hinderance via clashes between the peptidyl-tRNA and the AP loop. The need for reverse head-swivel to traverse both tRNAs may help explain why tRNA identity can influence elongation rates (117).\nFrameshifting, a core feature of the translational regulation of viruses such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, occurs when the ribosome encounters slippery mRNA sequences (a sequence where a tRNA can decode the \u20131, 0 or + 1 reading frame) (118,119). Bacterial ribosomes deficient in uL31, which provides a physical link between the LSU central protuberance and head of the SSU, have been found to undergo more frameshifting (120,121). We speculate that the loss of uL31 would likely increase the extent and range of diffusive SSU head domain motions that accompany late-translocation steps, potentially including the INT2-toINT3 transitions preceding POST state formation (Supplementary Figure S11). This would provide an important connection between head swivel regulation and frameshifting. Specific mutations in EF-G have also been found to promote frameshifting (122,123), likely by altering the nature and rate of reversible conformational changes within the protein and the ribosome that govern transitions between the INT2 and INT3 states. The observation that ribosomal protein uS7 influences both +1 and \u20131 frameshifting (124) suggests that its interactions with nucleotides upstream of the E-site mRNA codon further contribute to the SSU head domain hyper-swivel reaction coordinate. Such considerations, alongside reports of specific mRNA structures influ-\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/50/14/8302/6634877 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nencing translocation rates (125), warrant further examination of the complete repertoire of molecular determinants associated with the rate-limiting steps of translocation and their specific impacts on the motions of the SSU head domain in particular."
