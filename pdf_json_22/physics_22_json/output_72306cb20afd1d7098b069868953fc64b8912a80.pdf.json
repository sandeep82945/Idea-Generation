Since groundbreaking NMR experiments revealed recently that the pairs are of dominant spin-singlet character, attention has focused on time-reversal symmetry breaking linear combinations of s-, d-, and g-wave one-dimensional (1D) irreducible representations. However, a state of the form dxz + idyz corresponding to the two-dimensional representation Eg has also been proposed based on some experiments. We present a systematic study of the stability of various superconducting candidate states, assuming that pairing is driven by the fluctuation exchange mechanism, including a realistic three-dimensional Fermi surface, full treatment of both local and nonlocal spin-orbit couplings, and a wide range of Hubbard-Kanamori interaction parameters U, J,U \u2032, J \u2032. The leading superconducting instabilities are found to exhibit nodal even-parity A1g(s\u2032) or B1g(dx2\u2212y2 ) symmetries, similar to the findings in two-dimensional models without longer-range Coulomb interaction which tends to favor dxy over dx2\u2212y2 . Within the so-called Hund\u2019s coupling mean-field pairing scenario, the Eg(dxz/dyz ) solution can be stabilized for large J and specific forms of the spin-orbit coupling, but for all cases studied here the eigenvalues of other superconducting solutions are significantly larger when the full fluctuation exchange vertex is included in the pairing kernel. Additionally, we compute the spin susceptibility in relevant superconducting candidate phases and compare to recent neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift measurements. It is found that dxz + idyz order supports a neutron resonance in its superconducting phase, in contrast to a recent experiment [K. Jenni et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 104511 (2021)], whereas s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 does not. Furthermore, comparison of the Knight shift reveals that s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 exhibits a larger low-temperature shift than dxz + idyz.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033011\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved, and after nearly three decades of study the current lack of consensus on the nature of the superconducting ground state highlights the need for better quantitative theoretical descriptions of unconventional superconductivity [1]. There is consensus on some qualitative aspects: for example, recent ultrasound experiments impose important constraints on the possibilities of superconducting orders in Sr2RuO4, suggesting composite pairing solutions where the product of two distinct superconducting components transforms as B2g (dxy) [2,3]. In two-dimensional (2D) models, this leaves open the possibility of nearly degenerate superconducting instabilities belonging to different irreducible representations forming solutions of the form dx2\u2212y2 + ig(x2\u2212y2 )xy [4,5] or s\u2032 + idxy [6,7]. [We denote by s\u2032 (s) order parameters with nodal (node-\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

However, as pointed out recently, when considering the third spatial dimension there exists another 2D irreducible representation of the D4h point group which could potentially encompass the observations from NMR, ultrasound experiments, and muon spin resonance (\u03bcSR), namely the even-parity solution Eg : dxz/dyz [2,8,11\u201313]. This state, however, exhibits a controversial nodal structure with (horizontal) line nodes at kz = 0 [14], and relies on interlayer Cooper pairing despite the pronounced 2D electronic structure of Sr2RuO4.\nMost previous theoretical works addressing the gap structure of Sr2RuO4 were restricted to the two spatial dimensions of the RuO2 planes. This approximation appears natural based on the pronounced 2D structure of the system as observed by, e.g., the resistivity anisotropy ratio [15], de Haas-van Alphen oscillations [16], and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [17\u201319]. However, the fact that the orbital content at the Fermi surface varies along kz as a result of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [20] makes this state more plausible. Recently, the importance of the third dimension on the nature of the superconducting state was explored in Refs. [6,21\u201325]. In particular, local pairing originating\n2643-1564/2022/4(3)/033011(10) 033011-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nfrom large Hund\u2019s couplings treated within mean-field theory can stabilize spin-triplet, orbital-singlet superconductivity [26,27], which despite the spin-triplet structure can be compatible with a Knight shift reduction [21,22,28,29].\nWhen onsite attractive interactions arise from large Hund\u2019s coupling, the superconducting gap structure is inherited from the normal state band structure. This gives rise to an interorbital spin-triplet pairing gap if onsite SOC dominates [26,30]. However, other solutions can materialize in the presence of sizable momentum-dependent spin-orbit couplings (k-SOC). For example, the Eg solution can be stabilized when the kSOC terms exhibit sin kx sin kz or sin ky sin kz structure, as was demonstrated recently in the case of Sr2RuO4[6,22,38]. In contrast to the \u201cHund\u2019s coupling pairing scenario\u201d based on constant attractive interactions, spin-fluctuation mediated pairing provides a route to superconductivity irrespective of the strength of SOC and Hund\u2019s coupling. In this mechanism, attractive channels are promoted by nesting features of the Fermi surface pockets, enabling a number of near-degenerate superconducting instabilities. These solutions belong to different irreducible representations of the D4h point group and have highlighted the concept of accidental degeneracies in the case of Sr2RuO4[7,31\u201336].\nThe above developments call for a closer comparison of the Hund\u2019s coupling versus spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanisms for realistic 3D models for Sr2RuO4. In Ref. [37] we performed a direct comparison between these two mechanisms for different generic 2D band structures. Here, for Sr2RuO4, we are concerned with the question of how the leading gap solutions compare in terms of their momentum structure and pairing strength. In addition, in the Hund\u2019s\ncoupling pairing scenario, k-SOC terms are important for the resulting gap structure [22,38], but how do such k-SOC terms alter the spin-fluctuation generated gaps? In fact, the close competition between different pairing symmetries in Sr2RuO4 [7,32,35,39] makes it important to determine if such rather small changes in the underlying electronic structure can rearrange the hierarchy of superconducting solutions. Therefore, regardless of the smallness of additional interplanar hybridization and k-SOC terms that are allowed in 3D models, such terms might affect the superconducting gap symmetry.\nIn this paper, we determine the leading superconducting instabilities from a 3D realistic band structure relevant for Sr2RuO4. Our calculations reveal the effect of Hund\u2019s coupling on the leading gap structures in a broad parameter range and thereby connect the pairing outcomes from the spinfluctuation mediated mechanism with the regime where onsite Hund\u2019s coupling enables superconducting pairing, which is J/U > 13 at the mean-field level. Figure 1 provides an overview of the resulting evolution of the dominant instabilities as a function of J/U . The two different mechanisms agree on the overall symmetry of the gap solutions, favoring A1g(s\u2032) and B1g(dx2\u2212y2 ) superconductivity. However, as seen from Fig. 1, the nodal structures of the superconducting gaps are very different, with additional nesting-enforced vertical line nodes present when superconductivity is generated by spin fluctuations; see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Furthermore, a comparison of the leading eigenvalues of the two different mechanisms displayed in Fig. 1(c) highlights the fact that the eigenvalues, and hence generally also the critical temperature Tc, for the Hund\u2019s pairing mechanism are much smaller compared to the spin-fluctuation mechanism. This appears to\n033011-2\nindicate that this version of Hund\u2019s coupling pairing may not be directly applicable to a correlated material like Sr2RuO4, which exhibits significant momentum structure in its magnetic susceptibility. Finally, we remark that longer-range Coulomb repulsion promote dxy pairing, as shown recently within 2D models [7]. Therefore, due to the relatively weak 3D effects in Sr2RuO4, we expect that many of the results shown below remain valid when including longer-range Coulomb repulsion except dx2\u2212y2 gets replaced by dxy, but we have not further explored such effects in the present paper.\nAdditionally, we compute the dynamical spin susceptibility in relevant superconducting states for 3D Sr2RuO4. It is found that only dx2\u2212y2 and dxz/dyz superconductivity support neutron resonances, whereas for example s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 does not. Lastly, a calculation of the uniform susceptibility shows that both s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 and dxz + idyz exhibit pronounced Knight shifts, even though the former structure appears more compatible with recent bounds on the residual susceptibility at the lowest temperatures [10]. We discuss these findings in light of known experimental measurements of these quantities."

Additional momentum-dependent SOC is given by the off-diagonal contributions to the normal state Hamiltonian\nH3DSOC (k) = \u239b \u239d 0 \u03b7\nx k \u2212 i\u03b7yk \u2212i\u03b3 yk\u2212\u03b7xk + i\u03b7yk 0 \u2212i\u03b3 xk\u2212i\u03b3 yk \u2212i\u03b3 xk 0\n\u239e \u23a0, (6)\nwith\n\u03b7xk = 8t12z fx(k), \u03b7yk = \u22128t12z fy(k), (7)\n\u03b3 xk = 8t56z fx(k), \u03b3 yk = \u22128t56z fy(k), (8) and form factors given by\nfx(k) = cos(kx/2) sin(ky/2) sin(kz/2), (9)\nfy(k) = sin(kx/2) cos(ky/2) sin(kz/2). (10) The \u03b7-terms are spin-flip processes between the xz and yz orbitals, while the \u03b3 terms represent spin-preserving transitions between the xz/yz and xy orbitals [6,22]. It was previously shown that the \u03b3 terms can give rise to an Eg gap solution in the presence of local attractions arising from large Hund\u2019s couplings, as discussed in Refs. [6,22]. In addition, the \u03b1k terms of Eq. (4) can promote an s + idxy solution [6]. Since one of the goals of this study is to determine the viability of the Eg state, we will focus on the Eg-favorable k-SOC terms with momentum structure as detailed in Eqs. (9) and (10), i.e., finite values of t12z and t56z, and set tdxy = td = 0.\nFinally, in a 3D model, interplanar hybridizations between the xz/yz and xy orbitals are also allowed and enter the offdiagonal parts of Eq. (1). These additional terms are given by\nHhyb(k) = \u239b \u239d 0 0 Txz,xy(k)0 0 Tyz,xy(k)\nTxz,xy(k) Tyz,xy(k) 0\n\u239e \u23a0, (11)\nwith\nTxz,xy(k) = \u22128tint fx(k), Tyz,xy(k) = \u22128tint fy(k). (12) With the above expressions for hybridization and k-SOC, we work in a Brillouin zone (BZ) given by [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ] \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ] \u00d7 [\u22122\u03c0, 2\u03c0 ]. We have introduced out-of-plane hybridization terms t \u2032\u2032 and tint of similar amplitude as in Ref. [22], renormalized to the effective hopping parameters presented in Table I. We fix the onsite SOC to \u03bbso = 35 meV ( 0.4t1)[35] giving rise to a splitting of the bands along the zone diagonals in agreement with ARPES experiments [19].

Also, we include finite values of hybridizations (see Table I) as well as k-SOC parametrized by t12z = 5 meV and t56z = 3, 4 meV. The interplanar k-SOC terms are chosen to be the maximum allowed values that provide a Fermi surface compatible with ARPES and introduce a significant three-dimensional spin structure (see Fig. 3).

As usual, intra- and interorbital Coulomb scattering as well as Hund\u2019s coupling and pairhopping terms are included, and U \u2032 = U \u2212 2J , J \u2032 = J . [41] We rewrite the interaction Hamiltonian in the compact form\nH\u0302int = 1 2 \u2211 k,k\u2032{\u03bc\u0303} [V (k, k\u2032)]\u03bc\u03031,\u03bc\u03032\u03bc\u03033,\u03bc\u03034 d \u2020 k\u03bc\u03031 d\u2020\u2212k\u03bc\u03033 d\u2212k\u2032\u03bc\u03032 dk\u2032\u03bc\u03034 , (14)\nwith \u03bc\u0303 = (\u03bc, \u03c3 ) introduced as a joint index of orbital and electronic spin.

Within the mean-field Hund\u2019s coupling pairing scheme, where onsite interactions mediate superconductivity, the effective interaction of Eq. (14) is given simply by the onsite interaction elements of Eq. (15). The attractive channel obtained for J > U \u2032 generates spin-triplet, orbital-singlet superconducting order. In order to obtain a superconducting instability, however, a sizable SOC is required, since this will mix the off-Fermi level gap of spin-triplet orbital-singlet form with an intraband spin-singlet gap at the Fermi surface [26,27,30,37,42]. Below, when we refer to \u201cHund\u2019s pairing\u201d it implies that the superconducting gap structures were generated by onsite bare interactions only.\nIn the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism, the effective interaction is derived from random phase approximation (RPA) diagrams in the normal state including onsite as well as momentum-dependent SOC. The complete pairing obtained in this framework is given by an expression resembling a multiorbital RPA susceptibility in which the bare interactions have the multiorbital matrix structure detailed in Eq.

Below, when we refer to \u201cspin-fluctuation pairing\u201d it means that the gap structures were generated from Eq. (16). Thus, in the regime where J > U \u2032, the spin-fluctuation kernel also includes explicit onsite attraction similar to Hund\u2019s pairing, but with additional contributions from the fluctuation exchange susceptibility terms.\nWe parametrize the Fermi surface by roughly 3000 k points and calculate the superconducting instabilities at the Fermi surface from the linearized gap equation\n\u2212 1 (2\u03c0 )3 \u222b FS dk\u2032f 1 v(k\u2032f ) l,l \u2032 (k f , k\u2032f ) l \u2032 (k \u2032 f ) = \u03bb l (k f ),\n(19)\nwhere l,l \u2032 (k f , k\u2032f ) denotes the pairing kernel projected to band- and pseudospin-space [35], and k f denote the wave vectors on the Fermi surface. The Fermi speed is given by v(k f ). The leading superconducting instability is given by the gap function l (k f ) with the largest eigenvalue \u03bb. The pseudospin classification is encoded in the subscripts l, l \u2032 = 0, x, y, z, which refer to the components of the d(k)-vector in pseudospin space [45]. Even parity solutions appear in the l = 0, pseudospin singlet channel. In this work l,l \u2032 (k f , k\u2032f ) is evaluated with susceptibilities obtained at kT = 2 meV. We have verified explicitly that the temperature dependence of\n033011-4\nitself is not important for the main conclusions of this paper regarding \u03bb or Tc.\nBelow, we explore a broad range of Hund\u2019s couplings J/U = 0.1 \u2212 0.5, noting, however, that in the case of Sr2RuO4 the estimated value from constrained random phase approximation (RPA) calculations is J/U 0.1\u20130.2 [46\u201348]."

            "text": "As seen from Fig. 1, the leading and subleading instabilities appear in the s\u2032 and dx2\u2212y2 channels. This result is very robust to parameter variations. In the present case, it is obtained for the band parametrization stated in Table I, setting \u03bbso = 35 meV, t12z = 5 meV, and t56z = 3 meV. The susceptibility entering the pairing kernel in Eq. (16) is calculated at kBT = 2 meV. The same two leading gap symmetries arise both in the case when pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations, Eq.(16), and when it is generated directly from onsite attractions [i.e., in the Hund\u2019s paring case including only the first, momentum-independent part of Eq. (16)] in the case U \u2032 \u2212 J < 0. The latter Hund\u2019s coupling mechanism requires additionally finite SOC [26,27,42]. Note, however, since U \u2032 = U \u2212 2J it makes little sense to go beyond J/U = 0.5 in the present situation. The detailed structure of the gaps at the Fermi surface is shown in Figs. 1(a), 1(b) and Figs. 1(d), 1(e) for both pairing mechanisms. Note the qualitatively distinct nodal structures supported by the two approaches. First, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the solutions of the spin-fluctuation mechanism as formulated in Eq. (16). The leading s\u2032 solution from Fig. 1(a) features no symmetry-protected nodes, but displays a robust nodal structure which persists for the whole range of explored values of Hund\u2019s coupling. The nodal structure on the inner (\u03b2) pocket coincides with the accidental nodes of the subleading dx2\u2212y2 solution; see Fig. 1(b). This ensures a near-nodal structure on the inner (\u03b2) pocket of a composite order parameter of the form A1g + ei\u03c6 B1g (and A1g + ei\u03c6 B2g), as discussed previously within 2D models for Sr2RuO4[7,35]. Second, as opposed to the involved nodal structure supported by the spin fluctuations, which is rooted in the changing orbital content at the Fermi surface [7], the Hund\u2019s pairing gap structures display only symmetry-dictated nodes. Thus, the leading A1g solution is entirely nodeless as seen from Fig. 1(d), but does exhibit a non-trivial relative sign change between the inner (\u03b2) and two outer (\u03b1, \u03b3 ) Fermi pockets [26]. Likewise, the B1g solution features only its symmetry-dictated nodal structure, but also has an additional internal phase structure with a sign change of the simple dx2\u2212y2 form between the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 pockets. As discussed previously, these Hund\u2019s pair states correspond to dominant interorbital singlet, spin-triplet pairs [26,38]. The qualitatively distinct gap structures between the two mechanisms arise from significant contributions from the last two terms in Eq. (16). The bare interactions, first term in Eq. (16), contain the attractive Hund\u2019s pair hopping term, also within spinfluctuation mechanism when J/U > 1/3, but for the present Sr2RuO4 band structure this direct attractive channel is simply overwhelmed by the higher-order processes, even at J/U = 0.4\u20130.5. Clearly, this result depends on the combined signifi-\ncance of interactions and the spin susceptibility supported by the underlying band structure. The competition/cooperation between spin-fluctuation generated solutions versus Hund\u2019s pairing superconductivity is further explored in Ref. [37].\nAs evident from Fig. 1(c), the two-component Eg solution is suppressed in the spin-fluctuation pairing scenario with several additional 1D even-parity solutions preceding in the hierarchy of superconducting instabilities (not shown in Fig. 1) [23]. In the Hund\u2019s coupling pairing scheme on the other hand, it is the third leading instability, appearing right below the s and dx2\u2212y2 solutions. The Hund\u2019s pairing scenario can support a leading Eg solution, as discussed further below, but only in the unusual case where the onsite SOC is smaller or comparable to the k-SOC [22]. For the current band parametrization with an onsite SOC of \u03bbso = 35 meV and kSOC terms of magnitude t12z = 5 meV and t56z = 3 meV, the gap structure of one of the two components of the Eg solution is shown in the inset in the bottom of Fig. 1(c). That gap structure is surprisingly similar within both pairing scenarios, i.e., the Eg solutions arising from spin fluctuations do not exhibit additional orbitally driven accidental nodes.\nTo further compare the two different pairing scenarios, we show in Fig. 1(c) the evolution of pairing eigenvalues as the Hund\u2019s coupling J/U increases. In the regime J/U < 1/3, the local (mean-field) Hund\u2019s pairing does not support superconductivity, since no attractive channels are activated. By contrast, spin-fluctuation mediated pairing generates attractive channels for all values of Hund\u2019s coupling. We find an increase of the eigenvalues with increasing J/U , but no crossover between the different symmetry channels. Note that, for all Hund\u2019s exchange values J/U in Fig. 1(c), the eigenvalues of the spin-fluctuation pairing significantly dominate over the eigenvalues from the Hund\u2019s pairing scenario. In all regimes, we find that odd-parity, pseudospin triplet solutions are strongly suppressed. Lastly, we note that within spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing the strength of the pairing depends on the proximity to the associated magnetic instability at Uc, i.e., U compared to the critical interaction strength, which in the current case is Uc 160 meV for J/U = 0.2. Therefore, larger values of Coulomb repulsion cause a rapid increase in the eigenvalue. This property is only relevant very close to the instability, however, which is not the generic parameter range explored in this paper.\nThe gap structures that we find for the spin-fluctuation pairing, Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), are reminiscent of the s\u2032 and dx2\u2212y2 gap structures reported previously in purely 2D calculations [7,35,49]. Compared to the 2D case, there are small differences in the gap structure resulting from the additional interplanar hybridization and k-SOC terms: the gap changes sign on the \u03b1 pocket and a shift of the accidental node position towards the zone axes is present in the 3D gap structure. However, the detailed gap structure of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) still exhibits a sign change of the gap for segments of the Fermi surface connected by the prominent nesting vector of the xz/yz orbitals, namely Q1 (2\u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, qz ).\nThe gap structures presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) are robust to changes in onsite Coulomb repulsion U and Hund\u2019s couplings. This leads to the conclusion that, despite the nontrivial 3D structure of the spin susceptibility entering the pairing kernel, the dominant and leading subdominant\n033011-5\nsuperconducting instabilities remain s\u2032 and dx2\u2212y2 , with a similar gap structure as the ones obtained in the 2D case [7,35]. Due to the demanding numerical procedure, we have not included longer-range interactions in the pairing kernel in the 3D calculations. However, based on the robustness of the s\u2032 and dx2\u2212y2 solutions when expanding the model from 2D to 3D, we expect a similar conclusion to hold when introducing longer-range interactions, in which case spin fluctuations will most likely lead to a near degeneracy of s\u2032 and dxy pairing states [7].\nThe ratio between onsite SOC and k-SOC is decisive for the appearance of a leading Eg solution within the Hund\u2019s pairing mechanism, as explored in Ref. [22]. In particular, in the regime where \u03bbso and t56z are comparable, the Eg solution is favored when U \u2032 \u2212 J < 0. In order to investigate the spinfluctuation mechanism in the same regime of \u03bbso t56z, we show in Fig. 2 the leading solutions of the two mechanisms for the case of \u03bbso = 5 meV and t56z = 4 meV. As expected, the Eg solution is found to be leading within Hund\u2019s pairing, in this case for J/U = 0.5 [Fig. 2(b)]. On the other hand, spin fluctuations favor an s\u2032 solution for the same set of parameters, i.e., in the strong Hund\u2019s coupling regime setting U = 100 meV despite the large value of J/U = 0.5. The subleading solution is dx2\u2212y2 and this continues to be the case also for smaller values of Hund\u2019s coupling J/U = 0.25 (not shown). Notably, the spin fluctuations yield an eigenvalue which is a factor of 3 larger than in the Hund\u2019s pairing mechanism. Again this value depends on U compared to Uc, but it remains a fact that \u03bb is significantly larger within the spin-fluctuation approach for a wide range of interaction strengths [37]. Thus, even in the case where parameters are such that Eg is leading within Hund\u2019s pairing, the momentum-dependent parts of the pairing kernel Eq. (16) overwhelm the gap structure arising purely from the onsite terms. In addition, we have explored the band structure of Ref. [22] in the specific case of \u03bbso = 20 meV and t56z = 15 meV and found that while pure onsite interactions in the regime J/U = 0.5 supports the Eg : dxz/dyz solution, spin fluctuations give a dx2\u2212y2 and s\u2032 near degeneracy also for this band parametrization with largely enhanced eigenvalues compared to Hund\u2019s pairing."

            "text": "We turn now to a discussion of the properties of the spin susceptibility in the leading superconducting candidate states that currently appear relevant for Sr2RuO4. We focus on the question of a neutron resonance and the temperature T dependence of the NMR Knight shift.\nThe low-energy magnetic excitation spectrum at the incommensurate vector Q1 (2\u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, qz ) has been probed in a number of recent neutron scattering studies [50\u201352]. Naively it is expected that, whatever its (unconventional) superconducting ground state, Sr2RuO4 should exhibit a neutron spin resonance, i.e., an enhancement of spectral weight below the superconducting gap edge 2 at momenta that correspond to peaks in the spin susceptibility and which connect regions on the Fermi surface on which the superconducting gap changes sign. Such a feature has been observed in inelastic neutron scattering on the cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and heavy-fermion systems, among others [53]. Indeed, in Ref. [52] a weak resonancelike feature at finite out-of-plane momentum qz = 0.5 r.l.u. was reported. However, this finding remains controversial as it has not been reproduced; see, e.g., Ref. [51], where scattering wave vectors near Q1 were carefully probed. Additionally, none of the neutron scattering studies find strong evidence for a pronounced opening of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum. We believe that this is a key experimental touchstone that may help to identify the structure of the superconducting gap in Sr2RuO4.\nIn order to address these recent inelastic neutron measurements, we investigate the energy dependence of the spin susceptibility at Q1 for two different qz vectors, qz = 0 and 2\u03c0 (note that we have chosen the BZ [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ] \u00d7 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0 ] \u00d7 [\u22122\u03c0, 2\u03c0 ] and therefore qz = 2\u03c0 corresponds to an experimental value of qz = 0.5 r.l.u.). The calculated static \u03c9 = 0 spin susceptibility in the normal state is shown in Fig. 3, where the effect of SOC is visible in the difference between in-plane and out-of-plane spin components. For earlier theoretical works on the normal state spin susceptibility, we refer to Refs. [35,39,54\u201360]. In the corresponding 2D model, we\n033011-6\nfind a larger out-of-plane spin component at the dominant peak structure at Q1 [7,35]. Notably, as a result of the new k-SOC couplings, this anisotropy feature is now small and inverted at qz = 0, but very pronounced at qz = 2\u03c0 .\nWe address the possible gap structures proposed by spinfluctuation mediated pairing, i.e., s\u2032, dx2\u2212y2 [see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] and the combination s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 as well as the Hund\u2019s pairing proposed dxz + idyz gap structure, of which one component is shown in Fig. 2(b). We approximate the RPA results for the different gap structures in terms of crystal harmonics. For example, for the s\u2032 gap we use\n(k) = a + b(cos kx + cos ky) + c(cos kx cos ky), (20) with band-dependent values for the coefficients a, b, and c. Similarly, the dx2\u2212y2 gap is parametrized in terms of cos kx \u2212 cos ky and cos 2kx \u2212 cos 2ky. For these two gap structures, we neglect the kz dependence, which we find to be negligible in our RPA results. The Eg gap is parametrized in terms of sin kx, sin ky, sin 2kx, sin 2ky, sin kx cos ky, and sin ky cos kx crystal harmonics with an overall sin kz/2 form factor. We then include an additional Gaussian envelope of the form exp[\u2212 \u03bd (k)/ 0] where \u03bd (k) is the eigenenergy of band \u03bd such that it cuts off the gap for momenta away from the Fermi surface, and 0 = 10 eV. For all the parametrizations, we use coefficients that lead to a maximum gap size of approximately max = 10 meV. Numerical limitations prevent us from reducing the gap size further. This should not be a significant limitation, however, as the normal state density of states in our band structure is featureless over significantly larger energy scales.\nThe calculated low-energy spin susceptibility is shown in Fig. 4 for the different gap structures. As seen in the depiction in Figs. 1 and 2, the gap magnitudes vary considerably over the Fermi surface sheets. Due to this strong gap anisotropy,\nthere is no clear opening of a well-defined spin gap 2 , although there is a suppression of spectral weight at energies below 2 . At the same time, there is no clear spin resonance at Q1 for an interaction strength U = 120 meV (J/U = 0.25); see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). Nevertheless, for larger interactions (U = 140 meV) shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), the spectral weight enhancement for the dx2\u2212y2 gap moves down to lower frequencies below 2 and gets significantly stronger for both qz = 0 and qz = 2\u03c0 , indicating that this is indeed a resonancelike feature. Also, the two-component dxz + idyz solution displays a broad resonance feature for larger U , but exclusively in the case of qz = 2\u03c0 ; see Fig. 4(d). This is expected since for scattering at Q1, the gap only changes sign for 2\u03c0 < qz < 4\u03c0 ; see Fig. 2(b). As mentioned above, in the recent study by Iida et al., a neutron resonancelike feature was found at this qz position [52]. This appears to be in line with our theoretical findings for dxz + idyz superconductivity. We stress, however, that the resonance found at Q1 for qz = 0.5 r.l.u. in Ref. [52] has not been confirmed by another detailed study of the out-of-plane momentum dependence of the spin fluctuations; see Ref. [51]. Finally, as seen from Fig. 4, neither the s\u2032 nor the s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 solutions exhibit resonance features at any interaction strength or qz values.\nLastly, we turn to a discussion of the Knight shift which is calculated as the real part of the spin susceptibility at zero momentum, \u03c7 (q = 0, \u03c9 = 0), as a function of T normalized to the normal state value \u03c7NS(q = 0, \u03c9 = 0). We consider two candidate superconducting gap structures, namely the dxz + idyz state stabilized within Hund\u2019s pairing and the s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 phase favored by spin-fluctuation mediated pairing. Both orders break time-reversal symmetry. The T dependence of the gap is introduced explicitly by the BCS form (T ) = 0 tanh(1.76 \u221a Tc T \u2212 1), with 0 = 1 meV at the position of maximum gap magnitude and Tc = 0.5 meV. Both gap structures display a considerable suppression of the uniform spin susceptibility at the lowest T , as shown in Fig. 5. There is only a small difference between in-plane and out-of-plane\n033011-7\nsusceptibility components. As seen from Fig. 5, the decrease is only partial, with the ratio \u03bd = \u03c7 (T Tc)/\u03c7 (T > Tc) 0.4 for the s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 gap, and \u03bd 0.6 for the dxz + idyz gap. Importantly, the recent NMR experiment by Chronister et al. [10] proposes an upper bound of the condensate response to be less than 10% of the normal state value. As seen from Fig. 5 both time-reversal symmetry broken states violate the \u201cChronister bound.\u201d We have not further explored quantitative match with this here. However, as discussed in Ref. [7] for the case of s\u2032 + idxy superconductivity, the magnitude of \u03bd depends rather sensitively on the amplitude of SOC and interaction parameters U and J . Based on these calculations, it appears hard to reconcile a sizable SOC with \u03bd < 10%."

            "text": "Even though the Eu : px/py spin-triplet order appears ruled out by recent Knight shift measurements [8,9], several other experiments require certain combinations of two superconducting components [2,3,61,62]. By contrast, specific heat data under uniaxial pressure appear difficult to reconcile with a two-component homogeneous order parameter scenario [5,63,64]. Here, we have determined the microscopic nature of superconductivity from spin-fluctuations and Hund\u2019s pairing within 3D models for Sr2RuO4. We find that s\u2032- and d-wave even-parity solutions are robust leading superconducting states, similar to the findings from 2D models for this material. This points to the nodal s\u2032 + id phase as a prominent candidate for reconciling many experiments. The Eg : dxz/dyz even-parity order is not favored from spin fluctuations, even inside the Hund\u2019s pairing regime at large J/U . In addition, we note that the d + ig state suggested on phenomenological grounds [4] also does not appear to be competitive within the current framework.\nHund\u2019s pairing as defined in this paper can be viewed as an approximation to spin-fluctuation pairing in the sense that the Hund\u2019s pairing kernel is simply the spin-fluctuation kernel without the momentum-dependent terms; see Eq. (16). From this perspective, the present finding is that even for J > U \u2032 the momentum-dependent terms dominate for an electronic band structure and interaction strengths relevant for\nSr2RuO4, i.e., they produce significantly larger Tc and can lead to qualitatively different gap structures. Of course both spin-fluctuation pairing and (mean-field) Hund\u2019s pairing are approximate methods to solve the full many-body pairing problem, and it remains to be seen how the superconducting states generated by these respective mechanisms compare to other methods relevant for modeling the superconducting gap structure of Sr2RuO4. For recent work along these lines, see, e.g., Refs. [65\u201367]. These works take a large-scale numerical approach to calculation of the post-RPA pairing vertex, predicting different leading even- and odd-frequency pairing states. Thus far they are restricted to high energies, and it is presently unclear how they are related to the low-energy Hamiltonian relevant for a 1 K superconductor.\nFinally, we computed the spin susceptibility in the superconducting state of leading candidates for Sr2RuO4. In contrast to the s\u2032 and s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 states, it is found that dx2\u2212y2 and dxz + idyz orders support a sub \u2212 2 neutron resonance, which appears to be in contradiction to the most comprehensive currently available neutron scattering data [51]. In terms of the uniform susceptibility, both time-reversal symmetry broken states, s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 and dxz + idyz, exhibit significant Knight shifts at the lowest T , with the former appearing more compatible with recent bounds on the SOC-generated spin-triplet component [10]. Thus, in summary, the mystery of superconducting pairing in Sr2RuO4 remains a challenge, but from the perspective of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing the accidental s\u2032 + idx2\u2212y2 (or s\u2032 + idxy when including longer-range Coulomb interactions) state currently remains the favored superconducting order, and seems compatible with most experiments."
