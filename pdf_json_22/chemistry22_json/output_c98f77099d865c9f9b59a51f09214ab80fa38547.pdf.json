Tomlinson1,\u2020, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gibou2, Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz2, Fernando Temprano-Coleto3, Oliver E. Jensen1 and Julien R.

This question is addressed for soluble surfactant in a three-dimensional laminar channel flow, with periodic SHSs made of long finite-length longitudinal grooves located on both walls. We assume that bulk diffusion is sufficiently strong for cross-channel concentration gradients to be small. Exploiting long-wave theory and accounting for the difference between the rapid transverse and slower longitudinal Marangoni flows, we derive a one-dimensional model for surfactant transport from the full three-dimensional transport equations. Our one-dimensional model allows us to predict the drag reduction and surfactant distribution across the parameter space. The system exhibits multiple regimes, involving competition between Marangoni effects, bulk and interfacial diffusion, bulk and interfacial advection, shear dispersion and surfactant exchange between the bulk and the interface. We map out asymptotic regions in the high-dimensional parameter space, and derive explicit closed-form approximations of the drag reduction, without any fitting or empirical parameters. The physics underpinning the drag reduction effect and the negative effect of surfactant is discussed through analysis of the velocity field and surfactant concentrations, which show both uniform and non-uniform stress distributions. Our theoretical predictions of the drag reduction compare well with results from the literature solving numerically the full three-dimensional transport problem. Our atlas of maps provides a comprehensive analytical guide for designing surfactant-contaminated channels with SHSs, to maximise the drag reduction in applications.\nKey words: Marangoni convection, drag reduction, microfluidics\n\u2020 Email address for correspondence: samuel.tomlinson@manchester.ac.uk\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2023.

            "text": "When a fluid flows over a superhydrophobic surface (SHS), surface chemistry and microscopic roughness combine to entrap an array of microscopic gas pockets at the SHS. In the non-wetted or Cassie\u2013Baxter state (see, e.g., the reviews of Rothstein 2010; Lee, Choi & Kim 2016; Park, Choi & Kim 2021), the reduced liquid\u2013solid contact area at the SHS reduces viscous drag at the surface when compared with a solid wall, which leads to an overall decrease in drag. Owing to these drag-reducing capabilities, SHSs have been considered in a number of applications, such as low-Reynolds-number laminar flows (e.g. Ou & Rothstein 2005; Sbragaglia & Prosperetti 2007; Rothstein 2010; Sch\u00f6necker, Baier & Hardt 2014; Lee et al. 2016; Landel et al. 2020), high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows (e.g. Park, Sun & Kim 2014; T\u00fcrk et al. 2014; Golovin et al. 2016; Seo & Mani 2018; Rastegari & Akhavan 2019; Park et al. 2021) and the thermal management of microelectronics (e.g. Baier, Steffes & Hardt 2010; Cheng, Xu & Sui 2015; Lam, Hodes & Enright 2015; Kirk et al. 2020).\nAlthough the physical mechanism behind laminar drag reduction is well understood, SHSs seldom achieve the high drag-reduction performance predicted by theory (Lee et al. 2016; Park et al. 2021). A number of practical difficulties can explain the lower performance measured experimentally, such as displacement of the liquid\u2013gas interfaces (Biben & Joly 2008; Ng & Wang 2009), contact-angle effects (Sbragaglia & Prosperetti 2007; Teo & Khoo 2010), viscous drag from the gas phase (Sch\u00f6necker et al. 2014; Game et al. 2017), as well as surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses (Peaudecerf et al. 2017; Landel et al. 2020). In this study, we investigate in detail the effect of soluble surfactant on the drag reduction of SHSs in laminar channel flows. Surfactants can be transported by a liquid, adsorb at liquid\u2013gas interfaces and lower the surface tension of these interfaces (Manikantan & Squires 2020). Transported by the flow along the liquid\u2013gas interface, surfactants can accumulate at stagnation points (liquid\u2013gas\u2013solid contact lines), inducing an adverse Marangoni stress at the interface which increases the drag, thereby negating the drag-reducing effect of the nominally shear-free interface.\nThe effect of surfactants on SHS drag reduction was suggested by experimental studies in the last decade, which reported only a modest drag reduction when compared with solid walls. For example, Kim & Hidrovo (2012) used microscopy to analyse the location of the liquid\u2013gas interface in a channel flow over transverse ridges. Combined with flow-rate measurements, they found that the frictional properties of the channel were insensitive to the degree of microtexture wetting, and hence closely resembled solid walls. Likewise, using fluorescence microscopy and passive tracers, Bolognesi, Cottin-Bizonne & Pirat (2014) studied the flow field and shape of the liquid\u2013gas interfaces for a channel flow over longitudinal ridges. They found non-zero shear stresses at the interfaces, whereas most theoretical and numerical studies normally employ shear-free conditions to model SHSs (Rothstein 2010).\nFollowing these observations, several studies have explored the effects of surfactants on SHS drag reduction. Sch\u00e4ffel et al. (2016) combined fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with numerical simulations to examine the effective slip length in a channel flow with cylindrical pillars. They found that the effective slip length reduced when compared with simulations of a surfactant-free channel. Peaudecerf et al. (2017) performed experiments and numerical simulations in a channel with longitudinal ridges, demonstrating that low levels of surfactant could yield large changes in interfacial conditions. They showed that liquid\u2013gas interfaces could be rendered no-slip at surfactant concentrations well below typical environmental values. They used channel-flow experiments where the imposed pressure gradient was removed abruptly to show that the observed reverse flow was\n963 A10-2\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nonly possible due to adverse out-of-equilibrium surfactant gradients. Song et al. (2018) performed experiments for finite longitudinal ridges and effectively infinite concentric, annular ridges. For finite longitudinal ridges, surface tension gradients arose due to the presence of downstream transverse contact lines, increasing the drag when compared with infinite concentric ridges, where there were no stagnation points.\nThe experiments of Peaudecerf et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2018) were conducted in nominally \u2018clean\u2019 channels without added surfactant. Sch\u00e4ffel et al. (2016) also performed experiments with added surfactant, finding barely measurable increases in drag relative to their nominally \u2018clean\u2019 experiments. As noted by Peaudecerf et al. (2017), the counterintuitive result reported by Sch\u00e4ffel et al. (2016) was most likely due to the fact that traces of surfactants were already present in their experiment. Surfactant traces are inherently present in most engineered systems, due to general manufacturing conditions, materials, and the high surface-to-volume ratio of the SHS textures. For instance, microfluidic experimental devices are often made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is known to lead to surfactant effects (Hourlier-Fargette et al. 2018). In nature, surfactant traces have been measured in sea water (Pereira et al. 2018), rivers, estuaries and fog (Lewis 1991; Facchini et al. 2000).\nDue to the potentially strong adverse effect of surfactants on the drag reduction performance of SHSs, it is crucial to model their effect. Theoretical models can explain experimental observations, and also provide predictions for the design of SHSs where surfactant effects are mitigated. However, as discussed by Landel et al. (2020), the theoretical modelling of flows inclusive of surfactant over SHSs is complex. To make progress, Landel et al. (2020) assumed that the surfactant concentration is small. This assumption is consistent with normal environmental conditions where surfactants are found in trace amounts (Peaudecerf et al. 2017). Landel et al. (2020) constructed a scaling theory to model the slip and drag in steady two-dimensional (2D) pressure-driven channel flows bounded by SHSs, made of long transverse gratings, in the low-Reynolds-number flow regime. They also performed finite-element 2D numerical simulations to compute the constants in the scaling theory, and validated their scaling predictions. Their results showed that the slip length and drag reduction are affected by surfactants across a broad range of the parameter space. They focused on parameter combinations associated with microfluidic applications; it remains of interest to perform a comprehensive asymptotic analysis of the parameter space. Moreover, their theory did not consider non-uniform interfacial surfactant distributions associated with the \u2018stagnant cap\u2019 regime, where the upstream region of the interface has a weak surfactant gradient and is almost shear-free, whereas the downstream region of the interface has a strong surfactant gradient and is effectively no-slip (see, e.g., Bond & Newton 1928; Frumkin & Levich 1947; Levich 1962; He, Maldarelli & Dagan 1991, which describe similar behaviour for air bubbles rising in surfactant-contaminated water). In this regime, the advection of surfactant at the interface dominates relative to surface diffusion and bulk\u2013surface exchange.\nThe scaling theory of Landel et al. (2020) was extended to three-dimensional (3D) low-Reynolds-number channel flows with long but finite longitudinal gratings by Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023). They used a long-wave limit and assumed low surfactant concentrations to show that the slip velocity and the slip length scale in a similar fashion to 2D flows. In the limit of large Damk\u00f6hler numbers, as found for common surfactants, and sufficiently small bulk P\u00e9clet numbers, they predicted that significant slip can be achieved provided that the grating length is longer than both a modified depletion length and a mobilisation length. The modified depletion length depends on surfactant properties and the height of the channel, and is generally small, of the order of 1 mm, for small-scale applications. The mobilisation length depends on the normalised surfactant concentration,\n963 A10-3\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nMarangoni number, Damk\u00f6hler number and Biot number. As the mobilisation length can be much longer for typical small-scale applications, they concluded that the mobilisation length alone controls the slip in most small-scale applications. If the grating length is smaller than the mobilisation length, they showed that the slip velocity increases with the square of the grating length, which is in agreement with their numerical simulations and experiments, as well as with the experimental results from Peaudecerf et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2018).\nThe contamination of SHS channels with surfactant may be simplified if one considers only the effect of insoluble surfactant at the liquid\u2013gas interface, neglecting the exchange with bulk surfactant which remains at some background concentration. Baier & Hardt (2021) found analytical expressions for the velocity field and interfacial surfactant distribution in a 2D channel flow over transverse grooves in an advection-dominated regime (i.e. large interfacial P\u00e9clet numbers), under the assumption that the surface tension depends linearly on the surface concentration. Under the assumption of insoluble surfactant, drag is not reduced by increasing streamwise groove length, in contrast to findings from experiments and soluble-surfactant models, where slip increases with the square of the groove length (Peaudecerf et al. 2017; Landel et al. 2020; Temprano-Coleto et al. 2023). For periodic transverse grooves, Baier & Hardt (2021) determined the effective slip length, which is strongly dependent on the Marangoni number for large gas fractions, decreasing rapidly as the Marangoni number increases from zero. Mayer & Crowdy (2022) also considered surface immobilisation due to insoluble surfactant in a shear flow over periodic transverse SHSs; however, unlike Baier & Hardt (2021), the authors varied the surfactant load, interfacial P\u00e9clet and Marangoni number, using a nonlinear equation of state. They combined asymptotic theory with numerical solutions to identify two distinct mechanisms behind surface immobilisation. The first is the previously discussed stagnant cap mechanism. The second immobilisation mechanism emerges when there is a region of near-maximal surfactant concentration close to the downstream stagnation point. In contrast to the stagnant cap mechanism, surfactant gradients need not be large for appreciable Marangoni stresses to develop. The near-maximal surfactant concentration mechanism is captured using a nonlinear equation of state and thus can appear outside of the advection-dominated region, i.e. for small P\u00e9clet and Marangoni numbers, provided there is sufficient surfactant present at the interface.\nLiquid-infused surfaces (LISs) offer an alternative to SHSs where the SHS pockets are filled with a lubricating immiscible fluid instead of gas (Wong et al. 2011; Wexler, Jacobi & Stone 2015). They can self-repair and are more robust than SHSs if designed properly. However, the drag reduction of LISs decreases as the viscosity ratio between internal and external fluids increases (Sch\u00f6necker et al. 2014). Furthermore, recent numerical simulations by Sundin & Bagheri (2022) have indicated that LISs may be more susceptible to surfactant effects than SHSs. Sundin & Bagheri (2022) extended the theory introduced in Landel et al. (2020) to account for surfactants in a 2D shear flow, predicting the critical surfactant concentration for the slip to be reduced appreciably: C\u0302c = 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol m\u22123 for water\u2013air SHSs and C\u0302c = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol m\u22123 for water\u2013dodecane LISs. For low applied shear stresses, Sundin & Bagheri (2022) found that the distribution of surfactant at the interface is approximately uniform and a scaling theory was used to derive an expression for the slip length. For high applied shear stresses, surfactant accumulates at the downstream stagnation point and forms a stagnant cap. Sundin & Bagheri (2022) employed numerical simulations to find that the stagnant cap regime only exists below a particular bulk concentration (above which the scaling theory once again becomes valid). Considering a typical surfactant, e.g. sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the critical bulk concentration is shown to be proportional to the inverse Marangoni number. 963 A10-4\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nIn this paper, we show that a one-dimensional (1D) asymptotic theory, derived as coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the full 3D transport problem, can capture the impact of surfactant in 3D channels bounded by periodic SHSs made of long finite-length longitudinal grooves. The main assumption behind our theory is that bulk diffusion is strong enough to suppress cross-channel concentration gradients. We thereby sidestep the need for introducing empirical or fitting coefficients associated with scaling analyses, as done in previous studies (Landel et al. 2020; Sundin, Zaleski & Bagheri 2021; Temprano-Coleto et al. 2023). This allows us to address non-uniform shear stresses at the liquid\u2013gas interface. By mapping the drag reduction across a large part of the high-dimensional parameter space, we identify a multitude of asymptotic regions and their boundaries, unexplored by previous studies. Explicit closed-form asymptotic solutions predict the drag reduction in all the regions of the parameter space studied, offering analytical predictions for practical use where numerical simulation of the fluid and surfactant equations are computationally expensive. By addressing the role of shear dispersion, the theory developed here constitutes also a stepping stone towards a wider class of laminar flows with weaker cross-channel diffusion, where the bulk concentration field varies in three dimensions and must be resolved numerically.\nThe paper is arranged as follows. In \u00a7 2, the full 3D transport problem is formulated in terms of nine dimensionless parameters. In \u00a7 3, an asymptotic model is derived for the flow and surfactant transport; cross-channel integration reduces the number of independent dimensionless parameters to six. In \u00a7 4, key results are presented for the drag reduction using 2D maps that illustrate the structure of the parameter space; the underlying physics is described using the surfactant distribution and the 3D velocity field of the channel flow. In \u00a7 5, the implications and extensions of this study are discussed; a table of five dimensionless groups that control drag and the negative effect of surfactant is presented, expressing these dimensionless groups in terms of the dimensional parameters of the problem.\n2. Formulation\n2.1. Governing equations Consider a steady 3D laminar channel flow contaminated with a soluble surfactant and bounded between two SHSs that are separated by a distance 2H\u0302, as illustrated in figure 1. Hats indicate dimensional quantities. The x\u0302-, y\u0302- and z\u0302-coordinates are oriented in the streamwise, wall-normal and transverse directions, with x\u0302 = (x\u0302, y\u0302, z\u0302). The liquid is assumed to be incompressible and Newtonian with dynamic viscosity \u03bc\u0302, velocity u\u0302 = (u\u0302(x\u0302), v\u0302(x\u0302), w\u0302(x\u0302)), pressure p\u0302(x\u0302), bulk surfactant distribution c\u0302(x\u0302) and interfacial surfactant distribution \u0393\u0302 (x\u0302, z\u0302). Owing to the periodicity of the geometry, we restrict attention to a single periodic cell with streamwise (transverse) period length 2P\u0302x (2P\u0302z), liquid\u2013gas interface length (width) 2\u03c6xP\u0302x (2\u03c6zP\u0302z) and gas fraction \u03c6x (\u03c6z). Liquid\u2013gas interfaces, or plastrons, are assumed to be flat. The domain is partitioned into two subdomains per period, that are bounded by the plastron and solid ridge, namely\nD\u03021 = {x\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c6xP\u0302x, \u03c6xP\u0302x]} \u00d7 {y\u0302 \u2208 [0, 2H\u0302]} \u00d7 {z\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212P\u0302z, P\u0302z]}, (2.1a) D\u03022 = {x\u0302 \u2208 [\u03c6xP\u0302x, (2 \u2212 \u03c6x)P\u0302x]} \u00d7 {y\u0302 \u2208 [0, 2H\u0302]} \u00d7 {z\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212P\u0302z, P\u0302z]}, (2.1b)\n963 A10-5\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nas outlined in figure 1(b). At the SHSs, y\u0302 = 0 and y\u0302 = 2H\u0302, we define the liquid\u2013gas interfaces, the ridge surfaces and the solid surfaces, respectively, as\nI\u0302 = {x\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c6xP\u0302x, \u03c6xP\u0302x]} \u00d7 {y\u0302 \u2208 {0, 2H\u0302}} \u00d7 {z\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c6zP\u0302z, \u03c6zP\u0302z]}, (2.2a) R\u0302 = {x\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c6xP\u0302x, \u03c6xP\u0302x]} \u00d7 {y\u0302 \u2208 {0, 2H\u0302}} \u00d7 {z\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212P\u0302z, \u2212\u03c6zP\u0302z] \u222a [\u03c6zP\u0302z, P\u0302z]}, (2.2b)\nS\u0302 = {x\u0302 \u2208 [\u03c6xP\u0302x, (2 \u2212 \u03c6x)P\u0302x]} \u00d7 {y\u0302 \u2208 {0, 2H\u0302}} \u00d7 {z\u0302 \u2208 [\u2212P\u0302z, P\u0302z]}, (2.2c) as outlined in figure 1(a). Note that placing the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the domain (common practice in the literature for flows over SHSs) would increase the number of matching conditions between subdomains from two to three.\nTo model the fluid we use the steady Stokes equations, neglecting inertia and any body forces. The bulk surfactant is coupled to the flow field by a steady advection\u2013diffusion equation. In D\u03021 and D\u03022, we therefore have\n\u2207\u0302 \u00b7 u\u0302 = 0, \u03bc\u0302\u2207\u03022u\u0302 \u2212 \u2207\u0302p\u0302 = 0, D\u0302\u2207\u03022c\u0302 \u2212 u\u0302 \u00b7 \u2207\u0302c\u0302 = 0, (2.3a\u2013c) where D\u0302 is the surfactant bulk diffusivity. The interfacial surfactant is coupled to the flow by a steady advection\u2013diffusion equation and an equation of state. The bulk concentration is coupled to the interfacial surfactant by continuity of flux, where exchange at the interface is modelled using a source\u2013sink term consistent with the Henry isotherm (Chang & Franses 1995). The equation of state and adsorption\u2013desorption kinetics are linearised, which is valid for small deviations in the concentration of surfactant away from some reference value (Manikantan & Squires 2020). On I\u0302, we balance the tangential components of the stress, T\u0302 \u00b7 n where T\u0302 = \u2212p\u0302I + \u03bc\u0302(\u2207\u0302u\u0302 + (\u2207\u0302u\u0302)T) and n is the unit 963 A10-6\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nnormal to I\u0302 (pointing into the channel), with tangential gradients of surface tension \u03c3\u0302 .

(2.13)\nIntegrating (2.9) plus twice (2.10) with respect to x\u0302 recovers (2.12). A key quantity of interest in the present study is drag reduction. The flow is driven in the streamwise x\u0302-direction by a cross-channel-averaged pressure drop per period given by\n\u0394p\u0302 \u2261 \u3008p\u0302\u3009(\u2212\u03c6xP\u0302x) \u2212 \u3008p\u0302\u3009((2 \u2212 \u03c6x)P\u0302x) > 0, where \u3008\u00b7\u3009 \u2261 \u222b P\u0302z z\u0302=\u2212P\u0302z \u222b 2H\u0302\ny\u0302=0 \u00b7dy\u0302 dz\u0302/(4P\u0302zH\u0302) is the cross-channel average. In the limit when I\u0302 is immobilised (yielding an effective no-slip boundary condition for the velocity), we have \u0394p\u0302 = \u0394p\u0302R, say, and in the uncontaminated (or surfactant-free) limit \u0394p\u0302 = \u0394p\u0302U (when I\u0302 is a shear-free surface). We define the normalised drag reduction as\nDR = \u0394p\u0302R \u2212 \u0394p\u0302 \u0394p\u0302R \u2212 \u0394p\u0302U , (2.14)\nwhich varies from DR = 0 to 1 in the cases of minimum and maximum drag reduction, depending on the surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses. Equation (2.14) differs from other definitions of the drag reduction which compare the flow over a SHS with a solid wall, such as 1 \u2212 \u0394p\u0302/\u0394p\u0302R (e.g. Lee et al. 2016).\n2.2. Non-dimensionalisation Non-dimensionalising the governing equations (2.1)\u2013(2.14) using U\u0302 = Q\u0302/(H\u03022) for the velocity scale, with = H\u0302/P\u0302x for the slenderness parameter, P\u0302 = \u03bc\u0302U\u0302/H\u0302 for the pressure scale, C\u0302 = K\u0302/Q\u0302 for the bulk concentration scale and G\u0302 = K\u0302aC\u0302/K\u0302d for the interface concentration scale, we write\nx = x\u0302 P\u0302x , x\u22a5 = x\u0302\u22a5 P\u0302x , u = u\u0302 U\u0302 , u\u22a5 = u\u0302\u22a5 U\u0302 , p = p\u0302 P\u0302 , c = c\u0302 C\u0302 , \u0393 = \u0393\u0302 G\u0302 ,\n(2.15a\u2013g)\nwhere x\u0302\u22a5 \u2261 (y\u0302, z\u0302) and u\u0302\u22a5 \u2261 (v\u0302, w\u0302). Assuming that 1, this normalisation yields a long-wave theory for steady flow in the streamwise direction and introduces a velocity scaling which captures the rapid cross-channel transport that acts to eliminate cross-channel gradients of surfactant. The transverse flow decays exponentially quickly (Mcnair, Jensen & Landel 2022), but should formally be retained to develop consistent expansions. Here we only consider channels with an order-one aspect ratio (such that H\u0302 \u223c P\u0302z); other asymptotic scalings are left for future work.

Within the inner regions, the flow and surfactant field are governed by the coupled 3D Stokes and surfactant transport equations. In the present long-wave theory it is sufficient to impose continuity of c0 between D1 and D2, such that\nc0(\u03c6\u2212x , y, z) = c0(\u03c6+x , y, z), c0(\u2212\u03c6x, y, z) = c0(2 \u2212 \u03c6x, y, z), (3.8a,b)\nand continuity of volume and surfactant flux between D1 and D2, such that \u222b Pz\nz=\u2212Pz \u222b 2 y=0\nu0 dy dz = 1, (3.9) \u222b Pz\nz=\u2212Pz \u222b 2 y=0 ( u0c0 \u2212 c0xPe ) dy dz + 2Da BiPe \u222b \u03c6zPz z=\u2212\u03c6zPz, y=0 , ( u0\u03930 \u2212 \u03930xPeI ) dz = 1, (3.10)\nfor all \u2212\u03c6x \u2264 x \u2264 2 \u2212 \u03c6x.

(3.13)\nFrom (3.5a\u2013c)\u2013(3.12a\u2013d), the leading-order solution simplifies to \u03930 = \u03930(x), c0 = c0(x) where c0 = \u03930, p0 = p0(x) and v0 = w0 = 0. The leading-order velocities in the cross-section, v0 and w0, vanish due to transverse surfactant gradients decaying exponentially fast in a time-dependent setting, as discussed by Mcnair et al. (2022). Therefore, in our steady problem, the concentration field does not vary in the transverse direction and there are no concentration gradients to generate velocities in the cross-plane. The streamwise flow is driven by p0x, from (3.5b), and \u03930x, from (3.6a). Using linear superposition, we can write\nu0 = U\u0303p0x + MaU\u0304\u03930x in D1 and u0 = U\u0306p0x in D2, (3.14a,b)\nwhere U\u0303( y, z) and U\u0304( y, z) are velocity contributions related to the bulk pressure and surfactant gradient, respectively, in D1, and U\u0306( y) is the velocity contribution related to the bulk pressure gradient in D2.

(3.24a\u2013c) Solvability conditions imposed on (3.20a\u2013c)\u2013(3.24a\u2013c) constrain u0, c0 and \u03930 at O(1). The forcing on the right-hand sides of (3.20a\u2013c), (3.21a\u2013d) must be orthogonal to each vector in the null space of the linear operator that is adjoint to the left-hand sides of (3.20a\u2013c) and (3.21a\u2013d). Conveniently, these conditions are provided by the conservation arguments that result in the leading-order velocity and surfactant flux conditions (3.9), (3.10). Substituting the leading-order streamwise velocity (3.14a,b) into the leading-order velocity flux condition (3.9), we obtain\nQ\u0303p0x + MaQ\u0304\u03930x = 1, q = q\u0303p0x + Maq\u0304\u03930x in D1, Q\u0306p0x = 1 in D2. (3.25a\u2013c) Substituting (3.25a\u2013c) into the leading-order surfactant flux condition (3.10) and remembering that c0(x) = \u03930(x), we obtain the strong cross-channel diffusion problem\n(\u03b2 + 1) c0 \u2212 \u03b3 c0c0x \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u03b4) c0x = 1 in D1, (3.26a) c0 \u2212 \u03b1c0x = 1 in D2, (3.26b)\n963 A10-14\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nsubject to continuity of bulk surfactant (3.3a,b).

(3.27d)\nThe bulk diffusion coefficient \u03b1 > 0 is a rescaled (by 4P\u0302z/H\u0302) inverse P\u00e9clet number 1/Pe = D\u0302/(H\u0302U\u0302), nominally assumed O(1). The coefficient \u03b1 characterises the ratio of streamwise diffusion to streamwise advection in the bulk for a given normalised channel width, assumed O(1). The partition coefficient \u03b2 > 0 is the rescaled (by 2q\u0303/Q\u0303) normalised surfactant depletion depth Ld = K\u0302a/(H\u0302K\u0302d). The coefficient \u03b2 in (3.26a) determines the portion of the surfactant flux transported by the pressure-driven flow along the interface in comparison with the surfactant flux transported by the pressure-driven flow in the bulk. For \u03b2 1 (\u03b2 1), the surfactant advection flux is strongest at the interface (bulk). The surfactant strength coefficient \u03b3 > 0 is the rescaled (by 2(q\u0303Q\u0304/Q\u0303 \u2212 q\u0304)) product of Ld and the Marangoni number Ma = A\u0302G\u0302/(\u03bc\u0302U\u0302), the ratio of surface tension changes due to interfacial surfactant to viscous forces. The coefficient \u03b3 characterises the nonlinear effect of streamwise surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses on the streamwise surfactant flux at the interface and in the bulk. The surface diffusion parameter \u03b4 > 0 is a rescaled (by 4\u03c6zPz) product of Ld and the inverse surface P\u00e9clet number 1/PeI = D\u0302I/(H\u0302U\u0302), nominally assumed O(1). The coefficient \u03b4 measures the ratio of interfacial streamwise surface diffusion to streamwise advection for a given normalised interface width.\nIn summary, the leading-order problem (3.5a\u2013c)\u2013(3.12a\u2013d) has been reduced to the five-parameter problem (3.26) subject to (3.3a,b), a special case (where \u03bd/ 2 O(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4)) of the six-parameter problem (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d), requiring the solution of a first-order ODE to determine c0 and DR0 (explained in \u00a7 3.4). Then, the leading-order streamwise velocity (3.14a,b) and first-order problem (3.20a\u2013c)\u2013(3.24a\u2013c) can be used to construct the 3D flow field.\n3.2.2. Moderate cross-channel diffusion In general, when cross-channel diffusion is weak and cross-channel gradients in the concentration field are comparable to the cross-channel average, a numerical technique must be employed to evaluate c. We call this the \u2018generalised limit\u2019. In Appendix B.1, we identify the regions of parameter space where cross-channel gradients first emerge by perturbing around the cross-channel-averaged concentration. Writing c0 = \u3008c0\u3009(x) + c\u20320(x, y, z), we assume that \u2016c\u20320\u2016 \u2261 \u221a \u3008c\u203220 \u3009 \u3008c0\u3009 for all x, seeking to characterise the leading-order effects of shear dispersion in this problem (Taylor 1953). We expect shear-dispersion effects to arise in surfactant-contaminated SHS channels because the pressure-driven flow advects surfactant at different speeds across the channel. The advected surfactant is then mixed by cross-channel diffusion, which, in turn, results\n963 A10-15\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nin longitudinal dispersion of the surfactant distribution.

The validity of this assumption is evaluated a posteriori in Appendix B.2.\nTo develop this limit, we assume that 1/Pe = 1/PeI = Bi = O( 2) and Da = Ma = O(1) for 1, substituting the asymptotic expansion (3.4) into the governing equations (2.18a\u2013c)\u2013(2.27) (as in \u00a7 3.2.1).

Here, (U\u0303, U\u0304) are given by (3.15a\u2013g), (3.16a\u2013g), (Q\u0303, Q\u0304) by (3.18a,b), and (q\u0303, q\u0304) by (3.19a\u2013c). The coefficients s1 > 0, s2 and s3 are plotted for different \u03c6z, for Pz = 1 and as a function of Da in figure 11 (Appendix B.1).

Incorporation of shear dispersion effects in (3.30), through perturbation of the cross-channel-averaged concentration (c0 = \u3008c0\u3009(x) + c\u20320(x, y, z)), enables the strong-exchange model to explore regimes where cross-channel concentration gradients first become significant (\u2016c\u20320\u2016 = O(\u3008c0\u3009) for some x), enabling us to estimate approximately the boundary of validity of the 1D model (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d) (Appendix B.2). When bulk diffusion is strong enough for shear dispersion to become negligible, (3.30) reduces to (3.26), or (3.2) with c0 = \u03930.\n3.3. Moderate exchange In \u00a7 3.2, we assumed that Da = O(1) in order to have strong exchange at the interface, such that bulk and interfacial surfactants were in equilibrium at leading order, i.e. c0 = \u03930. To study the case where c0 and \u03930 are not in equilibrium, we rescale Bi = 2B and Da = 2D with B = D = O(1), whilst retaining Pe = PeI = Ma = O(1). Substituting the expansion (3.4) into the governing equations (2.18a\u2013c)\u2013(2.27), then the leading-order strong cross-channel diffusion equations (3.5a\u2013c), (3.6a\u2013c), (3.7)\u2013(3.9) and (3.11a\u2013d)\u2013(3.12a\u2013d) are recovered.

(3.31a,b) The total flux of surfactant (2.25) is given by\u222b Pz\nz=\u2212Pz \u222b 2 y=0 ( u0c0 \u2212 c0xPe ) dy dz + 2D BPe \u222b \u03c6zPz z=\u2212\u03c6zPz,y=0 ( u0\u03930 \u2212 \u03930xPeI ) dz = 1. (3.32)\nThe bulk and surface fluxes (2.27) are related to adsorption\u2013desorption fluxes at the interface via\nd dx (\u222b Pz z=\u2212Pz \u222b 2 y=0 ( u0c0 \u2212 c0xPe ) dy dz ) = 2D Pe \u222b \u03c6zPz z=\u2212\u03c6zPz,y=0 (\u03930 \u2212 c0) dz, (3.33a)\nd dx (\u222b \u03c6zPz z=\u2212\u03c6zPz,y=0 ( u0\u03930 \u2212 \u03930xPeI ) dz ) = \u2212B \u222b \u03c6zPz z=\u2212\u03c6zPz,y=0 (\u03930 \u2212 c0) dz. (3.33b)\nThe cross-channel velocity field again decays rapidly in time to v0 = w0 = 0. However, the bulk concentration c0 = c0(x) and surface concentration \u03930 = \u03930(x) are no longer equal at leading-order. The streamwise velocity field is given by u0 = U\u0303p0x + MaU\u0304\u03930x in D1 and u0 = U\u0306p0x in D2, where U\u0303, U\u0304 and U\u0306 are given by (3.15a\u2013g)\u2013(3.17a\u2013c).\nAt O( 2), the first-order strong cross-channel diffusion equations (3.20a\u2013c), (3.21a,b) and (3.22)\u2013(3.24a\u2013c) are recovered. On I,\nc1y = D(c0 \u2212 \u03930), Pe\u22121I \u03931zz \u2212 \u03930w1z = \u2212Pe\u22121I \u03930xx + (u0\u03930)x \u2212 B(c0 \u2212 \u03930). (3.34a,b)\nThis system is required to evaluate the first-order cross-channel flow, (v1, w1), driven by streamwise gradients of u0, c0 and \u03930, and to close the leading-order problem.\nSubstituting the streamwise velocity (3.14a,b) into the velocity flux condition (3.9), we recover Q\u0303p0x + MaQ\u0304\u03930x = 1 in D1 and Q\u0306p0x = 1 in D2, where Q\u0303 is given by (3.18a), Q\u0304 is given by (3.18b) and Q\u0306 = \u22124Pz/3. Substituting the streamwise velocity (3.14a,b) into (3.33) we derive the steady leading-order surfactant transport equations (3.1). Substituting (3.14a,b) into the surfactant transport equations (3.32) (or adding (3.1a) and (3.1b) and\n963 A10-17\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nintegrating) we recover integral constraints on the surfactant transport equations (3.1), which are given by surfactant flux constraints (3.2). The coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4 are defined in (3.27) and\n\u03bd = 4\u03c6zPzDa Pe = 4K\u0302a\u03c6zP\u0302z H\u0302U\u0302 (surface exchange). (3.35)\nThe surface exchange coefficient \u03bd is a rescaled (by 4\u03c6zP\u0302z) product of the inverse bulk P\u00e9clet and Damk\u00f6hler numbers, comparing the rate of adsorption of surfactant contained in the layer of fluid H\u0302 with the rate of advection. At the domain boundaries, we impose continuity of bulk surfactant (3.3a,b), continuity of bulk surfactant flux between D1 and D2 (3.3c) and no flux of interfacial surfactant (3.3d). For \u03bd/ 2 O(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), then c0 = \u03930 at leading order, recovering the transport equations (3.26) in the strong cross-channel diffusion and strong exchange limit. The numerical method used to solve the 1D surfactant transport equations (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d) is outlined in Appendix A.1.\n3.4. Drag reduction As mentioned in \u00a7 2, we study the transition from an immobilised interface where DR0 = 0, to a shear-free interface where DR0 = 1. When the interface is shear-free, Q\u0303p0x = 1 in D1 and Q\u0306p0x = 1 in D2, such that integrating \u2212p0x across the period gives\n\u0394pU = \u2212 \u222b \u03c6x\nx=\u2212\u03c6x p0x dx \u2212 \u222b 2\u2212\u03c6x x=\u03c6x p0x dx = \u22122\u03c6x Q\u0303 \u2212 2(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) Q\u0306 . (3.36)\nIn the limit where the interface is immobilised, Q\u0306p0x = 1 in D1 and D2, giving \u0394pR = \u22122/Q\u0306. Note that when q = 0, the surface velocity flux condition (3.25b) implies that q\u0303p0x + Maq\u0304\u03930x = 0. We can substitute this into the bulk velocity flux condition (3.25a), to find p0x(Q\u0303q\u0304 \u2212 Q\u0304q\u0303) = q\u0304 in D1. However, we also have p0x = 1/Q\u0306 in D1 for q = 0. Combining these two expressions for p0x in D1, gives Q\u0303q\u0304 \u2212 Q\u0304q\u0303 = q\u0304Q\u0306 and q\u0304(Q\u0303 \u2212 Q\u0306) = Q\u0304q\u0303. It follows that Q\u0306Q\u0304q\u0303/((q\u0303Q\u0304 \u2212 q\u0304Q\u0303)(Q\u0306 \u2212 Q\u0303)) = 1, which is valid for any q. Between these no-slip and shear-free limits, Q\u0303p0x + MaQ\u0304\u03930x = 1 in D1 and Q\u0306p0x = 1 in D2, such that integrating \u2212p0x across the period gives\n\u0394p0 = \u2212 \u222b \u03c6x\nx=\u2212\u03c6x p0x dx \u2212 \u222b 2\u2212\u03c6x x=\u03c6x p0x dx = \u22122\u03c6x Q\u0303 \u2212 2(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) Q\u0306 + MaQ\u0304\u0394\u03930 Q\u0303 , (3.37)\nwhere we have defined \u0394\u03930 = \u03930(\u03c6x) \u2212 \u03930(\u2212\u03c6x) > 0 (\u0394\u03930 = \u0394c0 in the strong exchange limit). Using the definition of (\u03b2, \u03b3 ) in (3.27b), (3.27c) and substituting \u0394pU , \u0394pR and \u0394p0 into the leading-order drag reduction (3.13), we have\nDR0 = 1 \u2212 \u03b3\u0394\u039302\u03c6x\u03b2 . (3.38)\nIn (3.38), the first term gives the drag reduction when the interface is shear-free and the second term measures the effect of surfactant. In order to derive the expression in (3.38), we used the fact that Q\u0306Q\u0304q\u0303/((q\u0303Q\u0304 \u2212 q\u0304Q\u0303)(Q\u0306 \u2212 Q\u0303)) = 1.\nDrag reduction is one possible measure of the performance of surfactant-contaminated SHSs. An alternative measure, commonly used for laminar flows over SHSs, is the effective slip length \u03bbe (Landel et al. 2020; Temprano-Coleto et al. 2023), defined as the uniform slip length applied to the top and bottom boundaries of an equivalent channel of\n963 A10-18\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nthe same height as the SHS channel and which has the same flow rate as the SHS channel under the same pressure gradient (Lauga & Stone 2003). To evaluate \u03bbe, we integrate the leading-order streamwise momentum equation (3.5b) for an equivalent channel with the mixed boundary conditions (3.6a\u2013e) and (3.11a\u2013d) replaced by \u03bbeu0y \u2212 u0 = 0 on I, R and S . We obtain u0 = U\u030c\u0394p0x where U\u030c = y( y \u2212 2)/2 \u2212 \u03bbe and p0x is the same pressure gradient as in the SHS channel. The flux is Q\u030c = \u222b Pzz=\u2212Pz \u222b 2y=0 U\u030cp0x dy dz = (Q\u0306 \u2212 2Pz\u03bbe)p0x, or by integrating over one period Q\u030c = (Q\u0306 \u2212 2Pz\u03bbe)\u0394p0/2. Equating the flux of the equivalent channel with the flux of the SHS channel, Q\u0303p0x + MaQ\u0304\u03930x = 1, we find\n\u03bbe = DR0(\u0394pR \u2212 \u0394pU)Pz\u0394pR(\u0394pUDR0 + \u0394pR(1 \u2212 DR0)) , (3.39)\nwhich can be used to convert results from DR0 to \u03bbe."

In \u00a7 4.2, we address the moderate-exchange problem, (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d), by varying \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 , \u03b4 and the exchange strength (\u03bd). In both strong- and moderate-exchange problems, we identify three primary areas of the parameter space. The Marangoni-dominated (M) region, where the interfacial surfactant gradient is sufficient to immobilise the liquid\u2013gas interface (low drag reduction); the advection-dominated region (A), where interfacial surfactant has been swept to the downstream stagnation point and the liquid\u2013gas interface is mostly shear free (high drag reduction); and the diffusion-dominated (D) region, where the interfacial surfactant gradient has been attenuated by diffusion and the liquid\u2013gas interface is mostly shear free (high drag reduction). Throughout \u00a7 4, the gas fraction and transverse period width are maintained at \u03c6x = \u03c6z = 0.5 and Pz = 1 for simplicity. However, general asymptotic solutions are derived for any \u03c6x, \u03c6z and Pz.\n4.1. Strong exchange\n4.1.1. Drag reduction Figure 4(a) shows how DR0 varies with the bulk diffusion (\u03b1) and surfactant strength (\u03b3 ), for \u03b2 = 1. In \u00a7 4.1, we set \u03b1 = \u03b4 for simplicity. However, general asymptotic solutions are derived for any \u03b4. The governing equations simplify in different regions of the parameter space, where subsets of the terms in (3.30) are dominant. These distinct physical balances are reflected by limits or transitions of DR0, as well as variations in the concentration profiles. The three primary areas of the parameter space, regions M, D and A, are separated by black lines in figure 4(a). They are analysed asymptotically in Appendix C. Another more general region (G) exists where cross-channel gradients in concentration can be comparable to the cross-channel average (shaded in figure 4a). As region G lies beyond the model predictions, its boundaries delimit the domain of validity of the model (Appendix B.2). To contextualise the changes in DR0, we examine how c0 and \u03930 vary across one period in figure 4(b\u2013e). Recall that D1 and D2 represent the subdomains over the plastron and solid ridge, respectively (D1 and D2 are separated by the vertical dotted line at x = \u03c6x = 0.5), and c0 = \u03930 in D1.\n963 A10-19\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nTo start our journey around the parameter space in figure 4(a), we address region M, in which Marangoni effects are sufficiently strong to render the interface almost immobile.

As shown in Appendix C.1, DR0 is close to zero in region M and takes the value\nDR0 \u2248 1 \u03b3\n( \u03b1 + \u03b4 +\n2s \u03b1 + \u03c6x(E + 1) (E \u2212 1)\n) for \u03b3 max ( 1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, 2\n\u03b1\n) , (4.1)\nwhere E \u2261 exp(2\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03c6x)/(\u03b12 + 2s4)) and s \u2261 s1 + s2 + s3 (note that s > 0 for all \u03c6z, Pz and Da examined in Appendix B.1). The leading-order drag reduction can be simplified within two sub-regions: MD, in which Marangoni effects start to compete with bulk diffusion, and MG, in which Marangoni effects start to compete with shear dispersion. In the MD case, (4.1) reduces to DR0 \u2248 \u03b1/(\u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03c6x)) + \u03b4/\u03b3 for \u03b3 (\u03b1, \u03b4) max(1, \u03b2, 2/\u03b1), demonstrating how bulk diffusion (noting that \u03b1/\u03b3 \u221d \u03bc\u0302D\u0302P\u0302z/(A\u0302G\u0302H\u0302L\u0302d)) and surface diffusion (noting that \u03b4/\u03b3 \u221d \u03bc\u0302D\u0302I\u03c6zP\u0302z/(A\u0302G\u0302H\u03022)) weaken the immobilising effects of surfactant. In the MG case, (4.1) reduces to DR0 \u2248 2(s4\u03c6x + s(1 \u2212 \u03c6x))/(\u03b3 \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03c6x)) for \u03b3 2/\u03b1 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), demonstrating how shear dispersion starts to mobilise the interface (noting that 2/(\u03b1\u03b3 ) \u221d \u03bc\u0302U\u03022H\u03025/(D\u0302A\u0302G\u0302L\u0302dP\u0302zP\u03022x) shows a quadratic dependence on the bulk flow speed).\nRepresentative concentration profiles in region M are shown in figure 4(b,d,e). Here, the leading-order concentration solution in D1 (Appendix C.1) is linear with a shallow gradient,\nc0 \u2248 1 + \u03b2 \u03b3\n( x \u2212 \u03c6x(E + 1) E \u2212 1 ) for \u03b3 max ( 1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, 2 \u03b1 ) . (4.2)\nThe gradient of c0 is controlled by both advection and Marangoni effects (noting that \u03b2/\u03b3 \u221d 1/Ma = \u03bc\u0302U\u0302/(A\u0302G\u0302), which shows that an advective flow is needed to set up a Marangoni gradient), providing a surface shear stress sufficient to immobilise the liquid\u2013gas interface. From (4.2), the magnitude of the concentration in D1 is weakly regulated by fluxes driven by bulk diffusion or shear dispersion in domain D2, via the factor \u03b1 + s4 2/\u03b1 in E that appears due to continuity of concentration across D1 and D2.\nThe M region transitions into the G region across the GM boundary, where the concentration field starts to develop appreciable cross-channel gradients. In Appendix B.2, we show that a 3D perturbation (c\u20320) to the cross-channel-averaged surfactant field (\u3008c0\u3009) becomes comparable to \u3008c0\u3009 when Marangoni effects compete with shear dispersion, with \u03b3 = O( 2/\u03b1) for \u03b2 = O(1). Similar to streamwise diffusion, shear dispersion increases drag reduction when approaching the GM boundary, as shown in figure 4(a). We conjecture that at 50 % drag reduction, shear dispersion becomes large enough to induce an appreciable cross-channel gradient, defining a possible boundary between regions M and G. However, 3D numerical simulations would be required to test this hypothesis and determine precisely the GM boundary, beyond which our asymptotic results (4.1) and (4.2) in region M are no longer valid. Therefore, our asymptotic approximation below to determine the GM boundary based on estimating DR0 = 0.5 should be used qualitatively rather than quantitatively. At the GM boundary, we find (Appendix C.2)\nDR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = 2(2s1(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) + s4\u03c6x(2 + \u03b2))\n2\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03c6x) for \u03b1 1, (4.3)\nwhich gives the leftmost dashed magenta line in figure 4(a). This approximation agrees with the numerical solution of the 1D strong-exchange problem in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0. As the immobilising effect of surfactant decreases across the GM boundary, larger streamwise\n963 A10-21\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nvelocities in the cross-plane imply that c0 decreases from c0 \u2248 1 to smaller values along the channel (see figure 4d). This is due to the velocity and surfactant flux being fixed.\nThe M region transitions into the D region through the DM boundary for \u03b3 = O(\u03b1) or \u03b3 = O(\u03b4), which can be defined (see Appendix C.3) by\nDR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = \u03b4 + \u03b1(2 + \u03b2\u03c6x)2(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) 1, (4.4)\nwhich gives the rightmost dashed magenta line in figure 4(a). The asymptotic approximation (4.4) agrees with the numerical solution of (3.30) (thick black line in figure 4a) for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) 1. Similar to the GM transition, the immobilising effect of surfactant decreases as we move from M to D by increasing the strength of bulk diffusion. By increasing the strength of bulk diffusion, bulk and interfacial surfactant gradients are attenuated because bulk\u2013surface exchange is strong; this allows the streamwise velocity and drag reduction to increase. As the velocity and surfactant flux are fixed, the increase in velocity leads to a decrease in c0, as shown in figure 4(e).\nIn summary, the factors promoting drag reduction from a state of interfacial immobilisation (in region M) are bulk diffusion (moving into region D), shear dispersion (moving into region G) or reduced surfactant strength (moving into region G, D or A, of which more details are given below). As we move into region D (or G), the surfactant in the bulk of the channel spreads out via diffusion (or shear dispersion), transporting surfactant from areas of high concentration to low concentration. Then, because exchange between the bulk and interfacial surfactant is strong, the concentration fields rapidly equilibrate; the interfacial surfactant gradient is also attenuated by these diffusive processes and the drag reduction DR0 increases.\nWe next turn our attention to region D, where diffusion is sufficiently strong for surfactant to be distributed almost uniformly along the bulk and interface. This implies that there are almost no Marangoni stresses to increase the drag and the liquid\u2013gas interface is almost shear-free. As shown in Appendix C.4, DR0 is close to unity in region D and is given by\nDR0 \u2248 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6x)\u03b3 (1 + \u03c6x\u03b2)\u03b1 + (1 \u2212 \u03c6x)\u03b4 for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) max(1, \u03b3 ), (4.5)\nfor \u03b2 = O(1). Equation (4.5) shows how drag-promoting Marangoni effects are weakened by strong diffusion in the bulk (\u03b1) or at the interface (\u03b4). Figure 4(c,e) shows the surfactant profiles in region D in the limit of strong diffusion, where \u03b1 or \u03b4 are large compared with bulk advection and Marangoni effects. The leading-order solution in D1 is uniform along x, such that\nc0 \u2248 \u03b1 + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) \u03b1(\u03b2\u03c6x + 1) + \u03b4(1 \u2212 \u03c6x) for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) max(1, \u03b3 ), (4.6)\ndemonstrating how diffusion eliminates gradients of c0 throughout D1 and D2 (the weak gradients contributing to DR0 in (4.5) appear at higher order and are detailed in Appendix C.4). Therefore, drag reduction in region D is impeded by decreasing the bulk and surface diffusion (if \u03b3 1) or increasing the surfactant strength (i.e. moving into region M).\nWe finally consider region A, in which surfactants can adsorb onto the interface but generate weak Marangoni stresses, allowing the streamwise flow to advect the interfacial surfactant towards the downstream stagnation point. In this advection-dominated region,\n963 A10-22\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nwe show in Appendix C.5 that DR0 is once again close to the shear-free value\nDR0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03b32\u03c6x (\u03b2 + 1) for 2 \u03b1 1, \u03b3 min(1, \u03b2). (4.7)\nRegion A can also be divided into two sub-regions: AG which balances advection and shear dispersion, and AD which balances advection and diffusion; these balances give the same DR0 as in (4.7). The corresponding concentration profiles in region A are shown in figure 4(b\u2013d). The leading-order solution in D1 exhibits a surfactant gradient that increases monotonically towards the downstream end of the plastron\nc0 \u2248 1 \u03b2 + 1 +\n\u03b2 (\u03b2 + 1) exp ( (1 + \u03b2)(x \u2212 \u03c6x) \u03b1 + \u03b4 + 2s1/\u03b1 ) for 2 \u03b1 1, \u03b3 min(1, \u03b2).\n(4.8)\nThe downstream boundary layer in (4.8) can be short compared with the plastron length, such that the surface shear stress is negligible almost everywhere on the interface and the bulk flow experiences a largely shear-free boundary.\nRegion A transitions into region D across the AD boundary, where advection and diffusion balance. The concentration and drag reduction at the AD boundary can be obtained in closed form following the method shown in Appendix C.5. However, in figure 4(a), we see that crossing the AD boundary (shown by the vertical black line at \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b3 1) does not affect DR0 to leading order. When \u03b3 min(1, \u03b2) and the surfactant strength is weak, either the streamwise velocity at the surface is large enough to advect most of the interfacial surfactant to the downstream stagnation point (\u03b1 1) or diffusion is strong enough to attenuate any interfacial surfactant gradient that forms (\u03b1 1). As the interface is mostly shear-free in both A and D, we do not pursue this limit. Bulk diffusion dominates over bulk advection for \u03b1 O(1), so we employ \u03b1 = 1 to illustrate the AD boundary in figure 4(a) (via the thick vertical black line on the right of the A region). When bulk diffusion is weak, shear dispersion dominates over bulk advection for 2/\u03b1 1 (Appendix B.2), so we use \u03b1 = 2 to illustrate the AG boundary (the thick vertical black line on the left of the A region in figure 4a). Region A transitions into region M across the AM boundary, such that Marangoni effects dominate advection for \u03b3 max(1, \u03b2).\nWe next investigate the dependence of the drag reduction on the partition coefficient (\u03b2) by evaluating DR0 for \u03b2 = 10 in figure 5(a) and \u03b2 = 100 in figure 5(b). As \u03b2 grows, the advective flux of surfactant at the liquid\u2013gas interface increases, sweeping more of the interfacial surfactant towards the downstream stagnation point. This means that a larger portion of the upstream part of the interface is shear-free, however, the surfactant concentration remains unchanging at the downstream end of the interface. Overall, the net (nonlinear) effect with increasing \u03b2 is a reduction in drag. The limit \u03b2 1 also corresponds to the near-insoluble surfactant limit, with nearly all surfactant being transported along the interface in region D1. A number of the asymptotic approximations given in (4.1)\u2013(4.8) simplify for \u03b2 1: (4.3) reduces to DR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = 2s4\u03b2\u03c6x/(2\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03c6x)) for \u03b1 1 \u03b2, such that shear dispersion in D2 determines DR0; (4.4) reduces to DR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b2\u03c6x/(2(1 \u2212 \u03c6x)) for \u03b1 \u03b2 1 and \u03b1 = O(\u03b4), with bulk diffusion determining DR0.\nAnother feature that emerges from figure 5(a,b) is the flattening of the central contours of DR0 at the AM boundary as \u03b2 increases for \u03b2 1, due to advection at the interface becoming stronger. To extract this feature asymptotically, in Appendix C.6 we assume \u03b2 1 max(\u03b1, \u03b4, 2/\u03b1) and \u03b3 = O(\u03b2) at the AM boundary, showing that\n963 A10-23\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nDR0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03b3 /(2\u03b2\u03c6x) for \u03b3 /\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c6x and 2 \u03b1 1 (the case where \u03b3 /\u03b2 > 2\u03c6x is also considered in Appendix C.6 and gives DR0 \u2248 \u2212(1/\u03b2 + \u03b3 ln(1 \u2212 2\u03b2\u03c6x/\u03b3 )/(2\u03c6x\u03b22)) provided 1 \u2212 2\u03c6x\u03b2/\u03b3 exp (\u2212\u03b2)). This demonstrates how a large surface advective flux weakens the immobilising effects of surfactant (noting that \u03b3 /\u03b2 \u221d A\u0302G\u0302/\u03bc\u0302U\u0302). Using this expression for DR0 at the AM boundary, we predict that\nDR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = \u03c6x\u03b2 for \u03b2 1 max ( \u03b1, \u03b4, 2\n\u03b1\n) , (4.9)\n963 A10-24\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nwhich gives the central dashed magenta lines in figure 5(a,b) (agreement with the 1D numerical solution of the strong-exchange problem improves for increasing \u03b2). At the AM boundary, the surfactant concentration at the interface exhibits a stagnant cap (He et al. 1991), or a piecewise-linear distribution, if \u03b3 /\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c6x, where the upstream interface is almost shear-free and the downstream interface is effectively no-slip. In Appendix C.6, we show that\nc0 \u2248 \u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 0 for \u2212 \u03c6x \u2264 x \u2264 x0, \u03b2\n\u03b3 (x \u2212 \u03c6x) + 1 for x0 \u2264 x \u2264 \u03c6x,\nfor min(\u03b2, \u03b3 ) 1 max ( \u03b1, \u03b4, 2\n\u03b1\n) ,\n(4.10)\nwhere x0 = \u03c6x \u2212 \u03b3 /\u03b2 (see, e.g., the red curve for \u03b3 = 100 in figure 5d). If \u03b3 /\u03b2 > 2\u03c6x, then the interfacial concentration distribution at the AM boundary is linear, c0 \u2248 \u03b2/\u03b3 (x \u2212 \u03c6x) + 1 at leading order. When the surface advection overcomes Marangoni effects, for \u03b2 \u03b3 , surfactants can accumulate at the downstream stagnation point. The blue curve for \u03b3 = 10 in figure 5(d) demonstrates that c0 \u2248 0 throughout most of D1: the large surfactant advective flux at the interface contracts the downstream boundary layer, making the interface almost shear-free. In summary, stronger nonlinearity in the form of stagnant cap profiles in the interfacial concentration can appear with increasing \u03b2 near the transition from region A to M. This results in a sharp decline in DR0 towards zero, which can be seen as the AM transition becomes less smooth, i.e. the vertical distance between DR0 = 0.5 and DR0 = 0.05 contours decreases from figure 5(a) to (b) as the surface advection increases from \u03b2 = 10 to \u03b2 = 100. However, we note that the location of the transition is captured by the simple expression (4.9) when \u03b3 /\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03c6x.\n4.1.2. Flow field Whenever there is partial drag reduction, 0 \u2264 DR0 < 1, the surfactant has a non-uniform concentration in D1, reducing the streamwise velocity at the plastron and generating a secondary flow in the bulk. To illustrate, videos of the leading-order streamwise velocity u0, wall-normal velocity v1, transverse velocity w1 and the streamwise gradient of the surfactant distribution c0x are given in supplementary movie 1 available at https://doi. org/10.1017/jfm.2023.264, evaluated at a point in the parameter space where DR0 \u2248 0.5, shown by the star in figure 4(a). The corresponding flow field is shown in figure 6. Figure 6(a) shows u0 at the centre of domain D1, where x = 0. The streamwise velocity, built from the components shown in figure 2, attains a maximum value at the channel centre, decaying towards either SHS (y = 0, 2) to satisfy no-slip at the solid wall (\u2212Pz \u2264 z \u2264 \u03c6z and \u03c6z \u2264 z \u2264 Pz), whilst allowing for slip over the plastron (\u2212\u03c6z \u2264 z \u2264 \u03c6z). The slip velocity at I reduces as one progresses through D1, in accordance with the rise in c0x for increasing x; see figure 6(c) and supplementary movie 1. The associated secondary cross-channel velocity field (v1, w1) shown in figure 6(b) (recall that the leading-order components are (v0, w0) = (0, 0)) advects particles from I towards the centre of the channel (y = 1 and z = \u00b1Pz). The absolute maximum of v1 occurs above the centre of the plastron (z = 0), whereas the absolute maximum of w1 occurs above the transverse contact lines (z = \u00b1\u03c6z). Supplementary movie 1 and figure 6(d) show how v1 and w1 grow in magnitude as one progresses through D1 along the positive x-direction as the interface is immobilised. As mentioned in \u00a7 3.2.1, the present long-wave model does not capture rapid adjustments of the flow field near the contact lines at x = \u00b1\u03c6x, where domains D1 and D2 meet.\n963 A10-25\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n4.2. Moderate exchange We now turn our attention to the moderate-exchange problem (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d), in which the bulk and interfacial concentration fields decouple for \u03bd/ 2 \u223c O(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4). At the plastron, surfactant adsorbs onto the interface at the upstream end (c0 > \u03930) and desorbs at the downstream end (\u03930 > c0), as regulated by the bulk\u2013surface exchange parameter \u03bd in (3.35). The moderate-exchange model does not take into account shear-dispersion effects, however, we ensure that the bulk diffusion strength is larger than the threshold identified in the strong-exchange problem (\u00a7 4.1.1), \u03b1 2, where cross-channel concentration gradients first become significant.\n4.2.1. Drag reduction Figure 7(a) shows how DR0 varies with surface exchange strength (\u03bd) and surfactant strength (\u03b3 ), for \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b4 = 1. Similar to the strong-exchange problem in \u00a7 4.1.1, the moderate-exchange governing equations (3.1)\u2013(3.2) simplify in different regions of the parameter space, representing distinct physical balances. The analysis in the moderate-exchange problem is simplified by the fact that for \u03bd/ 2 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4) the moderate-exchange problem transitions to the strong-exchange problem, which is discussed in detail in \u00a7 4.1.1. In the strong-exchange limit, \u03bd/ 2 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), we reach the AD boundary and region M identified in figure 4(a). Accordingly, the regimes\n963 A10-26\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nAD and M are also identified in figure 7(a) where bulk\u2013surface exchange is strong. New regimes ME and ADE appear for weak exchange, \u03bd/ 2 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), and are analysed asymptotically in Appendix D. The four primary areas of the parameter space, namely ME, ADE, M and AD, are separated by black lines in figure 7(a). Corresponding surface concentration distributions \u03930(x) (where, unlike the strong-exchange problem, c0 /=\u03930\n963 A10-27\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nin D1) are illustrated in figure 7(b\u2013e). The primary feature of figure 7(a) is that the drag-reduction transition from large DR0 to small DR0 shifts only modestly, despite the exchange strength \u03bd varying across many orders of magnitude, for reasons that we explain in the following paragraph.\nWe begin our exploration of the parameter space in the moderate-exchange problem (figure 7) with region ME, where Marangoni effects are strong and surfactant exchange between the bulk and interface is weak. In Appendix D.1 we show that DR0 remains close to the immobilised value\nDR0 \u2248 \u03b4 \u03b3 for \u03b3 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), \u03bd 2\nmin(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4). (4.11a,b)\nHere, the immobilising effects of surfactant are weakened by strong interfacial diffusion (\u03b4/\u03b3 \u221d \u03bc\u0302D\u0302I\u03c6zP\u0302z/(A\u0302G\u0302H\u03022)). The corresponding concentration fields c0 and \u03930 are shown in figure 7(d,e). The leading-order solution on I in ME is given by\n\u03930 \u2248 1 + \u03b2x \u03b3 for \u03b3 max(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), \u03bd 2\nmin(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4). (4.12a,b)\nThe gradient of \u03930 in region ME is controlled by the relative strength of surface advection and Marangoni effects, \u03b2/\u03b3 , which is sufficiently small to immobilise the liquid\u2013gas interface. Furthermore, there is very little adsorption and desorption at the interface and the bulk and interfacial surfactant concentrations are close to their background values at leading order (i.e. c0 \u2248 1 and \u03930 \u2248 1). In contrast to (4.2) in M and the strong-exchange problem of \u00a7 4.1.1, where c0 = \u03930 and \u03930 < 1 for all x, in ME and the weak-exchange problem, c0 \u2248 1 and \u03930 > 1 for x > 0 (see, e.g., the dashed and blue curves in figure 7e), in order to satisfy the net flux condition (2.26) at leading order. Furthermore, c0 has turning points for \u2212\u03c6x < x < \u03c6x where the adsorption\u2013desorption fluxes attain a local maximum and then decrease towards the contact lines, as shown by the green and orange curves in the inset in figure 7(d).\nRegion ME gives way to region M as the exchange strength increases. It is notable that DR0 \u2248 \u03b4/\u03b3 (see (4.11a,b)) is regulated mainly by surface diffusion in region ME, whereas both bulk and surface diffusion control DR0 in region M, where DR0 \u2248 \u03b1/(\u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03c6x)) + \u03b4/\u03b3 (see \u00a7 4.1.1). This is due to the absence of the strong coupling between \u03930 and c0 in region ME, which imposed \u03930 = c0 in region M. In figure 7(a), we find that \u03bd = 10 2 best captures the centre of this transition (this can also be tested by varying ). As exchange weakens and the bulk and interfacial surfactant move out of equilibrium, variations in \u03930 increase, thus making the interface more susceptible to Marangoni effects that increase the drag.\nDepending on the strength of diffusion (via the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b4, which vary orthogonally to the (\u03bd, \u03b3 )-plane in figure 7a), the lower half of the (\u03bd, \u03b3 )-plane is composed of either a sub-region of A, D, or the transition region AD between A and D. In figure 7(a), because \u03b1 = \u03b4 = 1, this corresponds to the transition region AD. In contrast, in figure 8(a) we plot DR0 for \u03b1 = \u03b4 = 0.1 and \u03b1 = \u03b4 = 10 in figure 8(b). The ME region transitions into the diffusion-exchange-dominated (DE) region across the MEDE boundary for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) O(1) (figure 8b), whereas the ME region transitions into the advection-exchange-dominated (AE) region across the MEAE boundary for max(\u03b1, \u03b4) O(1) (figure 8a). At the MEDE boundary, the asymptotic analysis in Appendix D.2 shows that\nDR0 \u2248 0.5 when \u03b3 = \u03b4 for min(\u03b1, \u03b4) 1, \u03bd 2\n1, (4.13) 963 A10-28\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nwhich gives the leftmost dashed line in figure 8(b).

This asymptote approximates the numerical solution presented in figure 8(a) where \u03b4 = 0.1 as \u03bd \u2192 0. Agreement improves for smaller \u03b4. It is notable that the threshold (4.14) differs from the strong-exchange limit (4.9) by a factor of four.\nWe next analyse the drag reduction in both the AE and DE regions, where advection or diffusion induce a near-uniform distribution of surfactant at the interface. In Appendix D.5 we show that DR0 in regions AE and DE is close to the shear-free value\nDR0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b4 for \u03b3 min(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), \u03bd 2\nmin(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4). (4.15)\nEquation (4.15) shows how drag-promoting Marangoni effects are weakened by strong diffusion at the interface, when surfactant exchange between the bulk and interface is weak. Figure 8(c,d) shows the surfactant profiles in AE and DE, the leading-order solution on I being given by\n\u03930 \u2248 2\u03c6x\u03b2 exp\n( \u03b2 (\u03c6x + x)\n\u03b4\n)\n\u03b4 ( exp ( 2\u03b2\u03c6x\n\u03b4\n) \u2212 1 ) for \u03b3 min(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), \u03bd 2\nmin(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4).\n(4.16)\nFrom (4.16), weak surface diffusion, \u03b4 O(1), decreases (increases) \u03930 at the upstream (downstream) end of the interface. A downstream boundary layer forms to satisfy the mass balance condition (2.26), condensing the Marangoni effect to a small region near x = \u03c6x. The streamwise velocity flows over a almost shear-free boundary at the upstream end of the interface. When surface diffusion is strong, \u03b4 O(1), (4.16) reduces to\n\u03930 = 1 + \u03b2x \u03b4 for \u03b3 min(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4), \u03bd 2\nmin(1, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4). (4.17)\nNoting that \u03b2/\u03b4 \u221d H\u03022U\u0302/(D\u0302I\u03c6zP\u0302z), (4.17) demonstrates how the gradient of \u03930 is controlled by the ratio of advection to diffusion at the interface, which allows surface diffusion to regulate DR0 in (4.15). In figure 8(a,b), the horizontal boundary of the ME region (shown with a black solid line) moves downwards when surface diffusion decreases (\u03b4 = 0.1 in figure 8a) and upwards when it increases (\u03b4 = 10 in figure 8b). Figure 8(c,d) demonstrates how increasing surface diffusion attenuates gradients of surfactant at the interface, increasing the drag reduction from sub-region AE to DE in figure 8(a,b).\n4.2.2. Flow field Videos of u0, v1, w1 and \u03930x are given in supplementary movie 2. Again, we choose an example in figure 9 for which DR0 = 0.5, shown with a star in figure 8(a). Figure 9(a) shows that u0 has a similar structure to the strong-exchange problem at x = 0 (see figure 6a). However, when comparing figure 9(c) with figure 6(c), u0 exhibits different behaviour along I. The streamwise velocity decreases slowly at the upstream end of I, \u03930x and \u03930xx increase slowly with x, and there is a uniform distribution of surfactant at the interface which is almost shear-free. The streamwise velocity decreases rapidly at the\n963 A10-30\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ncentre of I, where there is a sudden change of surfactant gradient at the interface. The streamwise velocity then decreases at the downstream end of I, where there is a more linear distribution of surfactant at the interface which is almost no-slip. The cross-channel flow in figure 9(b) closely resembles that observed in figure 6(b). In supplementary movie 2 and figure 9(d), the magnitudes of both v1 and w1 increase until they attain a maximum at the start of the low-slip region, after which, they decrease towards x = \u03c6x. The streamwise location of the maximum of v1 and w1 is approximately the same as the streamwise location of the maximum of \u03930xx on I, the \u2018corner\u2019 in the surfactant field.\n4.3. Comparison with numerical simulations Finally, we compare our model predictions with the numerical simulations detailed in tables SI and SII and figures S1 and S2 in Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023), which were designed to be representative of microchannel applications. They used finite-element simulations to solve the steady 3D Stokes equations, which were coupled to advection\u2013diffusion equations for bulk and interfacial surfactant. The equation of state and adsorption\u2013desorption kinetics, which link the velocity field to the bulk and interfacial concentrations, were derived from the nonlinear Frumkin isotherm (Chang & Franses 1995). The authors considered a channel with only one SHS at the bottom wall (y = 0), so our theory in \u00a7 3 is adjusted accordingly for a solid surface at the top wall (y = 2).\n963 A10-31\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nThis amounts to reevaluating U\u0303, U\u0304 and U\u0306, as well as modifying the surface surfactant flux term in (3.10) to account for the contribution of a single interface at y = 0. Parameters are detailed in table SI in Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023).\nIn figure 10(a,b) we compare our model to a representative example from numerical simulations performed in Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023), with parameters H\u0302 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22125, P\u0302z = 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 m and \u03c6z = 2/3, from which we can evaluate Pz, Q\u0303, Q\u0304, q\u0303 and q\u0304 using (3.18a,b), (3.19a\u2013c). Using (3.27) (appropriately adjusted for a single SHS), we can calculate the transport coefficients: \u03b1 = 0.4, \u03b2 = 38.6, \u03b3 = 1.2 \u00d7 104, \u03b4 = 1, = 0.02, \u03bd = 0.2 and \u03c6x = 0.99; with Pe = PeI = 20.6, Da = 30.1, Ma = 1.2 \u00d7 104 and Bi = 0.2, as in Temprano-Coleto et al.

Figure 10(a) shows that the example lies within the Marangoni-dominated region M, where DR0 is close to zero and the liquid\u2013gas interface is immobilised. Using this information, in figure 10(b), we compare the numerically simulated bulk surfactant concentration\n963 A10-32\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nc0(x, 0, 0) from Temprano-Coleto et al.

The gradient of c0 at the centre of the plastron computed using our theory (dc0/dx(0) \u2248 0.19) and the numerical simulation (dc/dx(0, 0, 0) \u2248 0.16) of Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023) are similar, noting that our theoretical prediction does not require any fitting parameters. However, the numerical simulation reveals thin boundary layers close to the upstream and downstream contact lines. These boundary layers are not captured by our long-wave theory. Within these inner regions, the 3D Stokes and surfactant transport equations govern the flow and surfactant field near the no-flux stagnation points at the upstream and downstream ends of the interface. This comparison suggests that the inner layers at the upstream and downstream ends are not needed to estimate the leading-order drag reduction in region M, but capturing the inner layers may be necessary for more accurate predictions.\nIn figure 10(c), we compare the drag reduction results from all the 3D numerical simulations of Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023) with the leading-order drag reduction predictions from our 1D model. These simulations span the whole parameter space characteristic of realistic microchannel applications. In order to approximate the drag reduction from the streamwise slip length results provided by Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023), we integrate the streamwise velocity field when \u03c6z = 0 for the solid-walled and SHS flows. For the flow over a single SHS, we replace the mixed boundary conditions at y = 0 with \u03bbeu0y \u2212 u0 = 0, to find u0 as a function of y and \u03bbe. We then use DR0 = (\u0394pR \u2212 \u0394p0)/(\u0394pR \u2212 \u0394pU) to relate the leading-order drag reduction and streamwise slip length, DR0 = 1 \u2212 1/(2\u03bbe + 1), in a similar manner to Landel et al. (2020). There is no obvious correlation between the scatter and the size of (shown in colour), which varies up to \u2248 0.5 as highlighted by the colourbar in figure 10(c). The scatter could be due to unresolved cross-channel concentration gradients or streamwise boundary layers at the ends of the plastron; both hypotheses require further testing against targeted numerical simulations. Nonetheless, our theory compares well with simulations for DR0 > 0.1 in figure 10(d); the root-mean-squared error between the simulated data from Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023) and our theory is 0.07. The majority of the data points have DR0 < 0.5 and lie in region M. Those that have DR0 > 0.5 are classified as belonging to region A when \u03b1 < 1 or D when \u03b1 > 1, as highlighted by the colourbar in figure 10(d). None of the simulations with high drag reduction (DR > 0.5) had a bulk diffusion strength small enough to lie on the boundary of region G (\u03b1 = O( 2)), where cross-channel concentration gradients become important and shear dispersion decreases the drag. Hence, the effect of shear dispersion we have described cannot be investigated from the simulations of Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023)."

In this paper, we have derived an asymptotic theory for 3D laminar flow, in a plane-periodic channel with SHSs made of an array of long but finite-length longitudinal grooves along both walls, which has been contaminated with soluble surfactant. The mass, momentum and surfactant equations are solved in the Stokes flow limit, where the adsorption\u2013desorption kinetics and equation of state are linearised. We have investigated regimes where cross-channel concentration gradients are small, developing a long-wave theory that accounts for a rapidly equilibrating surfactant-driven transverse flow. This results in a 1D model (3.1)\u2013(3.3a\u2013d) for surfactant transport, which incorporates advection, diffusion, Marangoni effects and exchange between the bulk and\n963 A10-33\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nthe interface. No parameter fitting is required, in contrast to the 3D theory outlined in Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023) and the 2D theory in Landel et al. (2020). Using this theory, we gain access to parts of the parameter space that are unavailable using models that assume uniform shear stress at the interface (Landel et al. 2020), and we make asymptotic predictions for the drag reduction and surfactant concentration distribution that complement expensive numerical simulations of the 3D flow and surfactant equations (Temprano-Coleto et al. 2023).\nWe have investigated the leading-order drag reduction (DR0) across the parameter space, varying the strength of surface advection (\u03b2), bulk (\u03b1) and surface (\u03b4) diffusion, Marangoni effects (\u03b3 ) and exchange between the bulk and the interface (\u03bd), compared with bulk advection. When exchange of surfactant is strong, the bulk and interfacial concentration are in equilibrium at leading order. We derived and solved a composite equation (3.30) that includes shear dispersion to qualitatively highlight where 3D effects become important (region G in figure 4a). When exchange of surfactant is moderate, the bulk and interfacial concentrations decouple. We have identified three primary regions of the parameter space in both the strong- and moderate-exchange problems (figures 4 and 7). In the Marangoni-dominated (M) regime, the interface is immobilised and the drag reduction vanishes to leading order (low-drag-reduction regime, DR0 1). The interfacial surfactant distribution is linear with a shallow gradient. In the advection- (A) and diffusion-dominated (D) regimes, the interface is shear-free and the drag reduction is unaffected by the surfactant at leading order (high-drag-reduction regime, 1 \u2212 DR0 1). The interfacial surfactant distribution can be non-uniform in A, near the AM boundary, where we find both exponential and almost piecewise-linear stagnant cap profiles. To clarify the underlying physics associated with these results, the dependence of the 3D velocity field on surfactant transport at the bulk and interface has been determined in both strong- and moderate-exchange limits (figures 6 and 9; supplementary movies 1 and 2).\nTable 1 summarises asymptotic approximations of the leading-order drag reduction DR0 in regions M, A and D, and the parts of the parameter space that describe them. Starting in region M, where there is no drag reduction and the interface is immobilised, we present approximations of the drag reduction when bulk diffusion (MD), shear dispersion (MG) or surface diffusion (ME) allow small surface mobilisation. The drag can be reduced by strengthening diffusion across the DM boundary (when min(\u03b3 /(\u03b1\u03b2), \u03b3 /\u03b1) \u223c O(1)), strengthening shear dispersion across the GM boundary (when \u03b1\u03b3/ 2 \u223c O(1)) or by reducing the surfactant strength relative to advection across the AM boundary (when min(\u03b3 /\u03b2, \u03b3 ) \u223c O(1)). The quantity \u03b3 /\u03b1, which affects DR0 in regions M and D, is identified in Temprano-Coleto et al. (2023) as the mobilisation length. The quantity \u03b3 /\u03b2, which affects DR0 in regions A, is identified in Sundin & Bagheri (2022) to determine whether the surfactant concentration is in the stagnant cap regime or not.\nA number of dimensionless ratios appear in table 1 that increase drag: \u03b3 /\u03b1, \u03b1\u03b3/ 2, \u03b3 /\u03b2, \u03b3 /(\u03b1\u03b2) and \u03b3 /\u03b4. We give these ratios in terms of dimensional parameters in table 2. All the ratios given in table 2 have the common factor A\u0302C\u0302L\u0302d/\u03bc\u0302, where A\u0302 is the surface activity, C\u0302 is the bulk concentration scale, L\u0302d is the depletion length and \u03bc\u0302 is the dynamic viscosity. Here, C\u0302L\u0302d measures the level of surfactant adsorbed on the plastron; A\u0302C\u0302L\u0302d gives the corresponding surface tension reduction, making A\u0302C\u0302L\u0302d/\u03bc\u0302 a velocity scale generated by interfacial Marangoni effects. The factor P\u0302zD\u0302, where P\u0302z is the transverse pitch and D\u0302 is the bulk diffusivity, decreases the drag across the DM boundary but increases the drag across the GM boundary; this reflects the smoothing effect of diffusion at the DM boundary and shear dispersion at the GM boundary. When exchange is weak, the surface diffusivity\n963 A10-34\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nD\u0302I instead decreases the drag across the DEME boundary (figure 8). The velocity flux Q\u0302 decreases the drag across the AM and GM boundaries, quadratically in the latter case (table 2). The approximations of the leading-order drag reduction in table 2 can also be divided into those with a linear or quadratic dependence on L\u0302d. Recall from \u00a7 2 that L\u0302d/H\u0302 is the normalised surfactant depletion length in \u00a7 2, such that for L\u0302d/H\u0302 1 surfactant is essentially insoluble, and for L\u0302d/H\u0302 1 nearly all surfactant is adsorbed to the interface. Accordingly, bulk diffusion and shear dispersion reduce drag through parameters that are quadratic in L\u0302d, requiring solubility for them to be effective.\n963 A10-35\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nA number of assumptions have allowed the present model to be derived. When cross-channel diffusion is weak or the long-wave parameter is not sufficiently small, the system lies in region G (identified in \u00a7 4) where cross-channel concentration gradients become comparable to streamwise variation. In region G, our 1D model breaks down and the full 3D transport equations must be solved to resolve the flow and surfactant fields. Furthermore, a host of higher-order physical effects associated with flows over SHSs may alter surfactant transport, e.g. interface curvature and the gas subphase, that have been neglected in our model but constitute important extensions (for a detailed discussion of these and other effects, see Lee et al. 2016). Another application of SHSs is in the thermal management of electronics, where streamwise and spanwise thermocapillary stresses arise due to temperature gradients at the liquid\u2013gas interface (as in considered in Kirk et al. 2020). With minor modifications it is possible that the theory outlined herein could also give insight into these diabatic flows.\nTo summarise, this paper has highlighted the range of physical balances that arise when one considers the effect of soluble surfactant in laminar flows bounded by SHSs. In the appropriate regimes, our results provide a comprehensive analytical framework that can guide the design of surfactant-contaminated SHSs. Our simple closed-form theoretical predictions of the drag reduction can help minimise drag in realistic 3D SHS microchannels and other applications, where surfactant traces may be naturally present.\nSupplementary movies.

An in-depth discussion of the (N + 1) \u00d7 (N + 1) differentiation matrix, D, that forms the basis of Chebyshev collocation technique can be found in Trefethen (2000). Briefly, it allows us to approximate f\u03be using D f , where f = ( f (0), . . . , f (N))T is the solution vector on a grid defined by \u03be(i) = cos(i\u03c0/N) for i = 0, 1, . . . , N.

We update the solution via cnew0 = cold0 + r(c0 \u2212 cold0 ) where r is a relaxation factor, until \u03c4i = \u2016Li(cnew0,i \u2212 cold0,i )\u2016\u221e/r falls below a specified tolerance for i = 1, 2.\nA.2. Leading-order flow field Problems (3.15a\u2013g) and (3.16a\u2013g) were solved by modifying the framework introduced in Game et al. (2017). We consider the domain As = {y \u2208 [0, 1]} \u00d7 {z \u2208 [0, Pz]}, constructing the rest of the solution using symmetry arguments. The domain is decomposed into two parts, separated by z = \u03c6z, where continuity of the variable and its first derivative is enforced. The domains are transformed to facilitate Chebyshev collocation discretisations and the partial differential equations are transformed to discrete space using techniques outlined in Trefethen (2000). The discontinuous boundary conditions at z = \u03c6z, (3.15b\u2013e)\u2013(3.16b\u2013e), introduce integrable stress singularities into the problem. The leading-order contributions of these singularities are subtracted to produce less singular problems. The unknown strengths of the singularities are determined by imposing a regularity condition, as follows.\nIntroducing a local polar coordinate system centred at the contact line (r, \u03b8) = ((z \u2212 \u03c6z)\n2 + y2)1/2, tan\u22121( y, z \u2212 \u03c6z)) and assuming r 1, (3.15a\u2013c), (3.16a\u2013c) can be used to evaluate the singular part of the solution (Us) via\nUsrr + Usr r + U s \u03b8\u03b8 r2 = b, such that Us(r, 0) = 0, Us\u03b8 (r, \u03c0) = d, (A2a\u2013c)\nwhere b are d are constants that can be chosen to construct (3.15a\u2013g) and (3.16a\u2013g). The solution must remain bounded as r \u2192 0 and (A2a\u2013c) can be solved to give\nUs = Bs1Us1 + O(r3/2) = Bs1r1/2 sin(\u03b8/2) + O(r3/2), (A3)\nwhere Bs1 is an singularity strength that must be evaluated as part of the solution. We substitute U = Bs1Us1 + Ur into (3.15a), (3.16a) where Ur is the residual solution with the singularity in (A3) removed, to obtain\nBs1\u22072\u22a5Us1 + \u22072\u22a5Ur = b. (A4)\nThe system is completed with a condition which requires regularity in first derivatives,\nUrz(0, \u03c6z) is constant, (A5)\nwhere this constant can be set to zero arbitrarily (Game et al. 2017). Equations (A4), (A5) are combined into a matrix problem which determines the singularity strength as part of the solution. The numerical convergence is improved significantly when compared with a single-domain solution without singularity removal.\n963 A10-37\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss"

Validity of the shear dispersion approximation When bulk diffusion is not sufficiently strong, concentration gradients normal to the SHS become comparable to the streamwise variation, the long-wave theory outlined in \u00a7 3 breaks down and 3D numerical simulation of the governing equations is required in order to resolve the coupled flow and surfactant fields. Here, we compare the size of the cross-channel-averaged surfactant concentration \u3008c0\u3009 to the cross-channel variation c\u20320, introduced in Appendix B.1, assuming that gradients normal to the SHS become important when c\u20320 = O(\u3008c0\u3009). This analysis gives an approximate boundary for the range of validity of our model.\nWe assume throughout this section that \u03b2 = O(1) (the expressions for \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 1 can be derived using similar arguments). To calculate the boundary between regions M and G, expand the cross-channel-averaged surfactant concentration as follows (see Appendix C.1)\n\u3008c0\u3009 = 1 + \u03b2 \u03b3\n( x \u2212 \u03c6x(E + 1) (E \u2212 1) ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , for \u03b3 max ( 1, \u03b1, \u03b4, 2 \u03b1 ) . (B16)\nSubstituting (B16) into (B11a,b), using p0x = 1/Q\u0303 \u2212 MaQ\u0304\u03930x/Q\u0303 from (3.25a\u2013c) and noting that \u03930x = \u3008c0\u3009x = O(1/\u03b3 ) in the strong-exchange regime, we find that c\u20320 = O(P/\u03b3 )) because Ma = O(\u03b3 ). As P = O( 2/\u03b1), we have c\u20320 = O( 2/(\u03b1\u03b3 )), so that c\u20320 = O(\u3008c0\u3009) = O(1) when \u03b3 = O( 2/\u03b1) in region M. Hence, \u03b3 = O( 2/\u03b1) defines the boundary of validity of region M near the region G, where shear dispersion terms become important (see figure 4).\nSimilarly, to calculate the boundary between regions A and G, expand as follows (see Appendix C.5):\n\u3008c0\u3009 = 1 \u03b2 + 1 +\n\u03b2 (\u03b2 + 1) exp ( (1 + \u03b2)(x \u2212 \u03c6x) \u03b1 + \u03b4 + 2s1/\u03b1 ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nfor 2 \u03b1 1, \u03b3 min(1, \u03b2).\n\u23ab\u23aa\u23ac \u23aa\u23ad (B17)\nSubstituting (B17) into (B11a,b) and using p0x = 1/Q\u0303 \u2212 MaQ\u0304\u03930x/Q\u0303, we find that c\u20320 = O(P). As P = O( 2/\u03b1), we have that c\u20320 = O(\u3008c0\u3009) when \u03b1 = O( 2) in region A. 963 A10-40\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n26 4\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss"
