    "abstractText": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a crucial tool for assessing cardiac health in humans. Aiming to enhance the accuracy of ECG signal classification, a novel approach is proposed based on relative position matrix and deep learning network information features for the classification task in this paper. The approach improves the feature extraction capability and classification accuracy via techniques of image conversion and attention mechanism. In terms of the recognition strategy, this paper presents an image conversion using relative position matrix information. This information is utilized to describe the relative spatial relationships between different waveforms, and the image identification is successfully applied to the Gam-Resnet18 deep learning network model with a transfer learning concept for classification. Ultimately, this model achieved a total accuracy of 99.30%, an average positive prediction rate of 98.76%, a sensitivity of 98.90%, and a specificity of 99.84% with the relative position matrix approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, different image conversion techniques are compared on the test set. The experimental results demonstrate that the relative position matrix information can better reflect the differences between various types of arrhythmias, thereby improving the accuracy and stability of classification.",

            "text": "Cardiovascular disease poses a significant threat to human health. As electrocardiography is a key method for representing pathological information, it has been an essential tool for the identification and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. For arrhythmia, which is one of the manifestations of cardiovascular disease, various technical difficulties still exist in achieving an accurate diagnosis, and the assistance of modeling electrocardiography is required. The traditional diagnostic technique relies on the clinical experience and feature extraction skills of physicians. However, there are technical challenges in manual diagnosis due to substantial differences in electrocardiograms. In recent years, with the application of deep learning in the medical field, automatic extraction of essential features and the automatic diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases have become research topics. The extraction of features from ECG signals is a crucial step in the intelligent recognition of cardiovascular diseases. The effectiveness of diagnosis is mainly dependent on the quality of feature extraction. The primary features found in ECG signals commonly include morphological properties, time-frequency features, and statistical information. Qin [1] utilized a discrete wavelet transform to extract morphological features combined with principal component analysis (PCA). An optimized support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to perform a six-classification recognition on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. A waveform coding rule was devised to extract multiple morphological features of signals [2], and the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) network was used for the multi-classification of ECG signals.\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25091264 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264 2 of 17\nZhu [3] used PCA and dynamic time warping (DTW) to extract multiple features with an employment of improved SVM. Elhaj [4] obtained non-linear properties by utilizing the high-order statistical cumulant of signals. The SVM and neural network were used for the five-class classification of arrhythmias with ten-fold cross-validation. Based on the statistical feature extracted with wavelet packet decomposition, a backpropagation neural network was employed for classification with a genetic algorithm [5]. Zarei [6] extracted non-linear features of signals by utilizing the wavelet transform coefficients with an entropy analysis on the fuzzy entropy, approximate entropy, and conditional entropy. However, due to the one-dimensional nature of ECG signals, the hidden features are not readily revealed. Thus, traditional deep neural networks have difficulty with automatically extracting effective features, leading to underperformance in classification. In contrast, deep learning techniques have demonstrated excellent performance in image segmentation and classification. As a result, researchers have sought to enhance neural networks by increasing the dimensionality of ECG signals. Consequently, two-dimensional imaging has emerged as a viable direction in automatic arrhythmia classification. Lu [7] proposed an advanced bidirectional recursive neural network based on residual structure, which was effectively classified for signals using a two-dimensional grayscale spectral image. A discrete cosine residual network algorithm was introduced for recognizing myocardial infarctions, optimizing time-frequency characteristics through a discrete cosine transformation method [8]. A variable scale fusion network model was employed with residual blocks and an attention mechanism to convert signals into a spectrogram [9]. Zhai [10] converted the signals into double-coupled matrices as two-dimensional feature inputs for a CNN model. However, in view of the time-frequency spectrogram, these methods may have difficulty in accurate modeling with information extraction from ECG signals with a low signal-to-noise ratio. In order to address this issue, the thought of transfer learning was utilized to develop a deep CNN model, which converted signals into a two-dimensional recurrence plot [11]. This improves the ability of the recurrence plot to represent both temporal and spatial features of signals, improving the classification accuracy with an expression of multidimensional information. However, the dimensionality reduction parameter is a key determination for the recurrence plot. Thus, empirical judgment or multiple parameter attempts may be necessary to achieve relatively accurate results. An improved ResGC-Net network for automatic arrhythmia recognition was employed by converting signals into a two-dimensional Gramian Angular Field (GAF) for identification and classification [12]. This method can better represent the interactions between different parts of signals, while possessing a superior stability and robustness. A semi-supervised CNN was proposed [13] for arrhythmia classification by using Markov Transition Field (MTF) to analyze signals at different time and frequency scales. The MTF exhibited a robustness with a reduction in the influence of noise through adjustment of the regularization parameter of the state transition matrix. However, calculations of GAF and MTF involve a high computational complexity. Therefore, it may result in an extended calculation cost or inaccurate results when dealing with large-scale time series data. In automatic arrhythmia classification, a primary challenge is to exploit a simple and efficient rise-dimensional algorithm for the image format to support subsequent automatic classification tasks. To address this need, a novel technology is proposed that utilizes relative position matrices for feature extraction in processing signals. This approach enables the swift conversion of a two-dimensional image while retaining sufficient information to facilitate subsequent automatic classification tasks. The proposed method is incorporating a deep learning algorithm via the Gam-Resnet18 network, which is built upon ResNet, by introducing the GAM global attention mechanism to enhance the capability of feature selection. The target of the proposed technology is to achieve rapid and effective detection and diagnosis of arrhythmias. The organization of this paper can be described as follows. The ECG signals for the abnormal heart rate types underwent segmentation firstly. Wavelet transform with\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264 3 of 17\na db6 wavelet and five-scale decomposition are applied to the segmented signals for noise reduction. In order to accurately represent the features of signals, the conversion of time-domain signals is conducted into relative position matrices in Section 3. Then, an in-depth explanation of the proposed network model \u201cGam-Resnet18\u201d is provided. The design strategy using transfer learning technique is discussed, which is applied to facilitate automated classification. Section 5 concentrates on constructing a transfer convolutional neural network accounting for modeling of the features represented by two-dimensional images. It is demonstrated that this model achieves an overall accuracy of 99.30% in the context of relative position matrix-based classification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparisons are also made with other algorithms using GAF, RP, and MTF."

In order to facilitate the analysis, we opted to select all 38 records that featured MLII lead configurations. The selected heart rhythms from the samples include normal electrocardiograms (Normal), and four prevalent arrhythmia types (e.g., left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature contractions (APC), and premature ventricular contractions (PVC)). In the subsequent discussion, the designations N, L, R, A, and V are chosen to represent these five electrocardiograms."

Due to the atypical waveform of arrhythmic signals, localization of ECG signals is required with precise identification of QRS peak positions. The MIT-BIH dataset has been completed using the manually labeled R-peak positions, thereby facilitating the subsequent process of heartbeat segmentation. Heartbeat segmentation is a key step in ECG signal processing. Commonly, heartbeat segmentation relies on fixed sampling points or time windows with QRS peak positions (Figure 1). Specifically, QRS peak locations serve as the starting point with 99 signal points forwards and 200 signal points backwards. Then, these points are compiled to be a complete heartbeat to guarantee the consistency and precision. With processing and filtering of the original ECG signals from MIT-BIH, all patients with the MLII lead are selected for research. Table 1 displays the number of samples for each type of ECG by applying the individual heartbeat segmentation. And it is noted that these are actual samples taken from the original database. Entropy 2023, 25, 1264 4 of 18\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264 4 of 17\nTo address the issue of data imbalance in ECG signals, an approach is employed for individual normal heartbeats conversion of 5 s data segments. By converting the single normal heartbeat into segments of 5 s, the challenge of imbalanced data can be effectively tackled. Additionally, the exclusion of 6 or 7 s time intervals is taken into account to mitigate the impact of noise and interfering signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability in detecting specific cardiac events. To perform the 5 s segmentation, it starts from the first sampling point at an interval of 5 s (1800 data points). In accordance with the established criteria, the segments will be labeled as designation of N if all the heartbeats within the segments correspond to the normal category. This approach is conducted to address the data imbalance caused by solely segmenting individual heartbeats, thereby enhancing the integrity and reliability of the dataset. Consequently, the particular outcome of the mixed heartbeat samples is referred to Table 2."

So, it is imperative to perform noise reduction processing in a targeted manner. In this paper, the db6 wavelet function is selected from the Daubechies wavelet family for suppressing noise. Within the support interval (\u22122, 2), it can be represented as a symmetric function centered at 0. The mathematical expression is defined as:\n\u03c8(t) = h0 \u2217 \u03d5(t) + h1 \u00d7 \u03d5(2t) + h2 \u00d7 \u03d5(2t\u2212 1) + h3 \u00d7 \u03d5(2t\u2212 2) + h4 \u00d7 \u03d5(2t\u2212 3) + h5 \u00d7 \u03d5(2t\u2212 4) (1)\nHere, \u03c8(t) represents the db6 wavelet function, \u03d5(t) denotes the scaling function, and h0, h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5 are the coefficients of the db6 wavelet. The specific coefficients for the db6 wavelet are h0 = 0.332671999, h1 = 0.806891509, h2 = 0.459877502, h3 = \u22120.13501102, h4 = \u22120.085441273, and h5 = 0.035226293. These coefficients are derived to ensure that the db6 wavelet satisfies the conditions of compact support and orthogonality. The db6 function is chosen here due to its similarity with the QRS waveform parameters found in ECG signals. Through the utilization of the wavelet transform, signals can be decomposed into wavelet coefficients of different scales and frequencies, providing a more precise description of characteristics. For ECG signals, the energy primarily converges within 4 or 5 scales. Accordingly, a decomposition level of 5 is chosen for multiscale analysis in this study. A balance could be achieved for a decomposition level of 5 between high frequency characteristics and noise suppression while fully retaining the low frequency information of the signal [15]. In wavelet denoising, hard and soft thresholding methods are employed typically. The compromise of soft\u2013hard thresholding [16] aims to balance the advantage and limitation of both methods. Usually, soft thresholding is applied initially to eliminate noise. Subsequently, hard thresholding is used to remove the remaining noise while maximizing the retention of signal details. The threshold function of the approach is defined as follows:\nY = {\nsign(Y) \u00b7 (|Y| \u2212 \u03b1\u03bb), |Y| \u2265 \u03bb 0, |Y| < \u03bb (2)\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264 5 of 17\nWhen \u03bb is assigned a value of 0 or 1, the threshold function manifests as either hard or soft thresholding, respectively. However, when 0 < \u03bb< 1, both soft and hard thresholding methods are applied to the ECG signal. In this study, an intermediate weight of \u03b1 = 0.5 is chosen as a compromise.

Information Feature Extraction Strategy Based on Relative Position Matrix The manual extraction of features from ECG is a complex and time-consuming task due to the large volume of data. Furthermore, a challenge is presented for CNN to accept inputs of different lengths of ECG recordings. The conversion of time-domain ECG data into two-dimensional images offers several advantages. It facilitates feature extraction, leading to improved performance. Neural networks are well suited for processing twodimensional matrix-format data. The challenge of data with varying lengths can be overcome by normalizing through segmented aggregation approximation, enabling uniform conversion to images of consistent size. The Relative Position Matrix (RPM) [17] is a visualization method, which captures the relative positions between different moments in a time series. Furthermore, it enhances data interpretability by reflecting the relative position of each moment within the entire time series. The algorithm of RPM provides a more comprehensive characterization of the correlation and trend among different data points. The dependency relationship is reflected among various temporal moments within a time series. Therefore, RPM is proposed to convert ECG signals into two-dimensional images, facilitating a better feature extraction and accurate classification. The deep learning network modeling for recognition and classification is performed in subsequent sections. The detail of the modeling process is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 2.

Overall accuracy is represented by the proportion of correctly classified heartbeat signal samples to total samples, while PPV is the ratio of correctly classified positive samples to all positive samples. Specificity is used to measure the probability of true negative samples being correctly predicted as negative. Sensitivity is referred to as the probability of true positive samples being correctly predicted as positive. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. By selecting appropriate metrics, the accuracy as well as the robustness of classifiers can be improved to meet requirements.

To assess the performance of the model, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) are utilized as evaluation metrics.

By employing the trained model on testing, the performance of classifier can be evaluated by acquiring corresponding confusion matrices. Based on these matrices, the overall accuracy rates are calculated as 99.15%, 99.28%, and 98.57% for the RP, GAF and MTF, respectively.

To address the recognition strategy, a relative position matrix is utilized to describe the relative spatial relationships between different waveforms with Gam-Resnet18 network image recognition technology for classification. The goal of this method is to\nEntropy 2023, 25, 1264 16 of 17\nenhance the ability of feature extraction and classification accuracy of ECG signals by employing image transformation, attention mechanisms, and residual blocks. The main conclusions are summarized as follows. In terms of data processing, ECG signals are segmented into the mixed heartbeat samples comprising single heartbeats and 5 s fragments. The segmented signals are denoised using the db6 wavelet basis and 5-level decomposition with wavelet transform. For image conversion, a feature extraction strategy is adopted based on a relative position matrix. This method extracts an intuitive display of features and local structure in the ECG signal, providing a support for automatic classification tasks. To achieve the two-dimensional image recognition, a Gam-Resnet18 network model is proposed for the modeling and classification of ECG signals. The GAM global attention mechanism is introduced at each residual block to improve the recognition capability of the model. Additionally, transfer learning technology is employed to accelerate the model training process. Utilizing the RPM approach with the Gam-Resnet18 modeling, the proposed method is validated with a total accuracy of 99.30%. The results are also compared with methods of GAF, RP, MTF, and other reported results to validate the effectiveness. It is demonstrated that the relative position matrix can better reflect the differences between various types of arrhythmias, thereby improving the accuracy and stability of classification.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.Z.; methodology, H.J.; software, H.J.; validation, M.Z. and H.J.; formal analysis, H.J. and W.L.; investigation, M.Z.; data curation, H.J.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.J.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.Z. and B.Z.; visualization, H.J.; supervision, M.Z. and B.Z.; project administration, M.Z.; and funding acquisition, M.Z.
