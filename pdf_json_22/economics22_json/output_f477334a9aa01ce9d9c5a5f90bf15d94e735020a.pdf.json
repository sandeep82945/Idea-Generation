Higher education is not immune from the totalizing effect of this zeitgeist. This is especially the case given state policy leaders, particularly conservative and neoconservative Republicans, are aggressively disinvesting in higher education.

Additionally, the adjunctification of faculty is creating a permanent exploited \u201cunderclass\u201d of part-time faculty as institutions move away from tenure-line employment categories. Indeed, \u201clarge armies of transient and disposable workers who are in no position to challenge the university\u2019s practices or agitate for \u2018democratic rather than monetary goals\u2019\u201d are becoming the default vehicles for content delivery (Biggers 2021). The distinction between public and private institutions is becoming less clear, where corporate interests are part and parcel of higher education. In addition, the persistent systemic violence of corporatized education has brought the student debt levels to a crisis, with students burdened by decades of debt (American Federation of Teachers 2020; Lake 2019). As Lazzarato (2011: 45\u201346) states, \u201cdebt is not only an economic mechanism, it is also a security-state technique of government aimed at reducing the uncertainty of the behavior of the governed. By training the governed to \u2018promise\u2019 (to honor their debt) capitalism exercised \u2018control over the future\u2019.\u201d In addition to this, as Kotsko (2018: 123) states, student loans \u201cforce students to think of their educational choices in financial terms and of themselves as customers.\u201d This indebtedness leads to students performing a market analysis on the costs versus the benefits of an advanced degree. Student loans more generally force most students to delay house purchasing, families, and other life events and choices because of the often devastating debt they take on for official credentialing (Kuperberg and Mazelis 2021). These topics, and more, are the focus of this special issue.\nThe first article by Winlow, Beyond Measure: On the Marketization of British Universities, and the Domestication of Academic Criminology, provides a raw critique and assessment of the march toward a neoliberalized British university system and the decline of core ideals within higher academe as the marketization telos and the pressure to drive change (i.e., continuous push for improvements, assessments, and oversight) becomes all encompassing. Winlow refers to this as \u201cthe \u2018reversal of ideology\u2019 and the onward march of processes of metricisation, competition and depoliticization.\u201d Within this critique, Winlow turns his attention to criminology, British criminologists and their working lives and careers including the impact of rampantly reproduced commercialization discourse including knowledge production, suggesting that \u201cin an act of institutionalised fetishism, we return time and again to a depressingly familiar list of concepts and frameworks from the twentieth century that simply cannot reveal anything new and important about the way we live now.\u201d\nFrom a Canadian perspective, Muzzatti\u2019s article, Strange Bedfellows: Austerity and Social Justice at the Neoliberal University, examines and critiques neoliberalism\u2019s impact and characteristics of Canada\u2019s higher academe from the ethos of corporate managerialism amongst university administrators that is manifested in the intersecting strategies of privatization, monetization, resource reallocation and the subtle regulation of faculty. Wherein corporate branding of lecture series and endowed chairs through advertising blitzes and real-life product placement on campus, one can see that \u201cglobal capitalism\u2019s tentacles are everywhere.\u201d Muzzatti also critiques how \u201cthe neoliberal university\u2019s tactless embrace of corporate values\u201d has manifested \u201cin a number of distasteful ways, not the least of which is cloaking itself in the guise of social justice whilst engaging in all manner of harm in the pursuit of profit.\u201d\nDrawing from one year of academic trade press reports, Watermeyer, Raaper and Batalla\u2019s piece, COVID-19: A neoliberal nirvana? provides an assessment of faculty experience and the impact the pandemic had within the United Kingdom\u2019s neoliberalized higher education sector. Specifically, they provide a window into the extent of the pandemic\u2019s disruption and the degree to which it accelerates the ongoing trends of neoliberalization that are\n1 3\npart and parcel of a \u201cdeterioration of academics\u2019 professional (and personal) lives.\u201d They argue that the pandemic has elucidated the scale of neoliberalized universities\u2019 market collusion and the evolution of university leaders into dispassionate corporate functionaries. As Winlow also noted, the authors point out how universities, under the sway of market logics, have turned from academic-collegialism to corporate managerialism; \u201crife among which is a fatalistic discourse of academics ceding rights of critical freedom and autonomy and their capitulation to performative ritualism and neoliberal governmentality.\u201d\nMorris and Targ\u2019s article, The Crisis of Higher Education: Neoliberalism and the Privileging of \u201cinnovation\u201d in the Twenty First Century, is a prime case study of neoliberalism\u2019s constant \u201cpush for change\u201d or market-driven innovation including disruptive innovation. They do a great job in connecting the issue of the university precariat and \u201cdisruptive innovation.\u201d Given that Purdue University, where both authors are Professors, is viewed as a leading institution of \u201cinnovation,\u201d Morris and Targ offer a critical assessment of the \u201cinnovative\u201d developments\u2014University Honors College, Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts Program and Purdue Global\u2014to demonstrate the broader trends of neoliberalized universities, e.g., administrators\u2019 corporatized decision making, increasing the precariat labor force while decreasing tenure track faculty, obfuscating transparency, toward more and more centralized models of management (micromanagement) and the \u201cdeath\u201d of those disciplines not viewed as \u201cvaluable\u201d within the market-driven logics of higher academe. It is not merely the death of disciplines viewed as non-value, it is also the prioritization and preference of funding of universities athletics.\nCollins\u2019 contribution, Academics versus Athletics? The protection and prioritization of college athletics in an era of neoliberal austerity subject to austerity measures, provides an in-depth assessment of the enduring commitment of universities to intercollegiate sports (and athletes) while subjecting the academic side of higher academe to austerity measures/policies. This is in spite of the fact that the majority of colleges/universities in the United States athletic programs operate with annual financial losses\u2014in the red. Nonetheless, administrators continue to believe in the \u201cFlutie effect\u201d\u2014\u201cthe belief that good athletic performance increases admission applications\u2014many Universities subscribe and promote the notion that intercollegiate sports are instrumental to the improvement of the institutions\u2019 academic mission.\u201d Hence, the value and prioritization of students\u2019 education have become secondary to their college \u201cexperience.\u201d With an abundance of examples, Collins also connects the prioritization of athletes and athletic programs with universities and colleges versus victims of rape and sexual assault. There is a general reluctance, if not obfuscation, to hold those accountable for these egregious acts of violence given the \u201cdominance and commercialization of sports\u201d to ensure their competitiveness and \u201csuccess\u201d as revenue generating sports. Collins states that if \u201cathletics departments programming cuts are made, not based on the competitive success of the athletes, but on neoliberal practices that reduce varsity sports to financial standing\u201d and \u201care often made in efforts to funnel saved revenue back into football and basketball (big-name coaches, new or upgraded facilities) with the hopes of conference realignment, broadcasting deals, and increased merchandising and ticketing sales.\u201d\nThe theme of athletics and market-driven forces is also a part of the focus in our (Rothe, Arneklev and Kauzlarich) article, $ over Ethics: Higher Education and the Private Prions Industry, a Symptom of the Theology of Neoliberalism. We critique the impact of corporate donations on universities, with particular attention to the private prison industry\u2019s intertwinement with higher education, and specifically the relationship between the GEO Group and Florida Atlantic University. We also suggest that the push for corporate \u201cdonations\u201d is indicative of how neoliberalized universities have come to serve corporate interests\n1 3\n(community stakeholders) amidst a global field of competitiveness. At Florida Atlantic University, the atrocious relationship between administrators and the GEO Group, one of the two largest private prison industries, is unadulterated and led to what has been coined Owlcatraz (2013). As the University made an attempt to make the big jump into NCAA Division I football, they accrued over $46 million in debt to build a stadium. A solution? Seek out corporate donations regardless of what or who the corporation is. The GEO group offered a solution: a $6 million donation to have the stadium named after them. While efforts eventually failed, after drawing local and national scorn and ire, one could claim this to be an example of a successful resistance effort (though the University did not choose to end the \u201cgift\u201d offer, it was the GEO Group who wished to prevent more negative attention to their business), yet the financial and political intertwinement/relationships have not ceased to date. For us, any acceptance of the private prison industry\u2019s monies, donations, or corporate benevolence is problematic. After all, the sanctity of higher education matters little when the dollars are needed.\nBarak\u2019s article, Debt Relief Reforms are not Enough to Alter the Relations of Inequality and Harm Reproduction: The Case of Educational Debt and the Need for Structural Reconstruction, critiques the massive debt crisis in the United States with a focus on higher education and student debt that further produces student austerity and socioeconomic inequality inherent in the capitalist system. Barak discusses, save for home mortgages, how student loans\u2014to the tune of 45 million education loans\u2014save home mortgages, is the top source of debt of residents in this country. He states, \u201cthis huge figure now exceeds the market value of Boeing, Coca-Cola, General Electric, McDonalds, Starbucks, and Walt Disney combined.\u201d This massive debt leads to additional harms from homelessness, couch surfing to food insecurity. As more and more Universities tout education as an \u201cexperience\u201d rather than knowledge and developing critical thought, and push the boundaries for enrollment increases, students become trapped in the debt crisis. Barak then makes the argument that we should be demanding student relief rather than the current situation that results in student distress, impacting marginalized consumers the most.\nTaylor\u2019s contribution, Independent School Rhetoric and its Role in the Neoliberal Construction of Whiteness, expands the conversations of \u201cneoliberal racial projects\u201d to critique the recreation of whiteness in academe. His focus on independent private schools in the United States that are in essence neoliberalized institutions\u2014explicitly market-driven organizations as is higher academe, and how these independent private schools perpetuate and reify notions of Whiteness. This is achieved, in particular, through an explicitly market-based approach to educational choice in both language and action. Taylor rightly argues that \u201cNeoliberalism and its attendant beliefs about the market, individual control, and meritocracy are existential elements of independent schools and thus any attempt at constructing an inclusive space or decolonizing community will face immediate challenges.\u201d"
