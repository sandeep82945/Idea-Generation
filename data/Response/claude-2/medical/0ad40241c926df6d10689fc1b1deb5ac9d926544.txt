 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct cross-cultural comparisons of tourists' waste sorting intentions and behaviors. The current study was done in China, but cultural values may influence intentions and behaviors. Comparing results across cultures could provide useful insights.

2. Examine the effects of different communication strategies to enhance tourists' self-identity and moral norms related to waste sorting. The paper suggests these could be effective interventions, but empirical testing of different approaches is needed. 

3. Investigate the role of habit in influencing tourists' waste sorting behaviors. The paper mentions tourists may behave differently in unfamiliar environments. Research on how habit impacts intentions and behaviors could be informative.

4. Study the effects of structural factors like convenience and accessibility of waste sorting facilities. The paper focuses on individual motivations, but external factors likely also play a role.

5. Longitudinal designs tracking tourists over time to see how waste sorting intentions translate into sustained behaviors. The current study was cross-sectional, but longitudinal work could provide insights into behavior formation.
