IRCRES-CNR Turin Research Area of the National Research Council Strada delle Cacce, 73-10135 Turin (Italy) E-mail: mario.coccia@cnr.it Abstract The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between healthcare expenditures and health capacity, and variability in COVID-19 case fatality rate between European countries. In particular, the purpose of the present study is to see whether statistical evidence supports the hypothesis that the reduction of COVID-19 fatality, between European countries, can be explained by leveraging health expenditures and if so to form some quantitative analyses and estimates of the relation between health expenditures and COVID-19 fatality rate between countries. The research is based on a sample of European countries and data from various sources, including Eurostat, World Bank, and OECD databases. Results suggest that countries with higher COVID-19 fatality rate in 2020 (when pandemic starts) in comparison to countries with lower COVID-19 fatality had (higher) +50.5% of fatality in 2020, +52.9% in 2022, lower health expenditure as % of GDP \u22125.5%, health expenditure per capita \u221234.5%, R&D expenditures in health \u221230.3%, lower reduction of COVID-19 fatality from 2022-2022 by \u221257.2 % vs 59.3% of the other group. Results also show a negative association between COVID19 Fatality in 2022 and Health expenditure as a share of GDP 2020 (r=\u22120.42, p-value 0.05); COVID-19 Fatality in 2022 and Vaccinations in December 2021 (r=\u22120.75, p-value 0.01). Difference of COVID-19 Fatality 22-20 has also negative correlation coefficients given by r=\u22120.48 (p-value 0.05) with Health expenditure as a share of GDP of 2020 and by r=\u22120.52 (p-value 0.01) with vaccinations in December 2021. Partial correlation, controlling population over 65yo in 2020, confirms previous results. The contribution here expands the knowledge in these research topics by endeavoring to clarify how higher health expenditures improve the preparedness and resilience in crisis management of countries to face unforeseen epidemic or pandemic similar to COVID-19 in society.",

In particular, the purpose of the present study is to see whether statistical evidence supports the hypothesis that the reduction of COVID-19 fatality, between European countries, can be explained by leveraging health expenditures and if so to form some quantitative analyses and estimates of the relation between health expenditures and COVID-19 fatality rate between countries. The research is based on a sample of European countries and data from various sources, including Eurostat, World Bank, and OECD databases. Results suggest that countries with higher COVID-19 fatality rate in 2020 (when pandemic starts) in comparison to countries with lower COVID-19 fatality had (higher) +50.5% of fatality in 2020, +52.9% in 2022, lower health expenditure as % of GDP \u22125.5%, health expenditure per capita \u221234.5%, R&D expenditures in health \u221230.3%, lower reduction of COVID-19 fatality from 2022-2022 by \u221257.2 % vs 59.3% of the other group. Results also show a negative association between COVID19 Fatality in 2022 and Health expenditure as a share of GDP 2020 (r=\u22120.42, p-value 0.05); COVID-19 Fatality in 2022 and Vaccinations in December 2021 (r=\u22120.75, p-value 0.01).

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world since the first months of 2020, driven by manifold\nenvironmental, social and economic factors, causing considerable human losses and significant economic and\nsocial consequences (Abel and Gietel-Basten, 2020; Bontempi and Coccia, 2021; Bontempi et al., 2021;\nChowdhury et al., 2022; Coccia 2020, 2020a,b; Coccia, 2021, 2021a-h; Coccia, 2022f, 2023b; Coccia and\nBontempi, 2023; N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Delgado et al., 2021; Tisdell, 2020; Verma and Prakash, 2020). The negative effects of\nthe novel coronavirus were initially countered by states through a variety of non-pharmaceutical measures of\ncontrol (e.g., lockdown, social distance, facemask wearing, etc.; cf., Akan and Coccia, 2022; Coccia, 2019e,f;\nCoccia, 2021d,e; Coccia, 2022) and basic health interventions and policies (e.g., care protocols; cf., Amarlou\nand Coccia, 2023; Ardito et al., 2021; Benati and Coccia, 2022). During the last three years, the effectiveness of\nthe different approaches has been variously discussed and some critical aspects have been clarified (Zhang et al,\n2021; Soltesz et al., 2020; Brauner et al, 2020; Bo et al., 2021). Countries that have previously faced the pandemic\nand experimented with intervention protocols have been able to transfer their know-how to others. In the long\nrun, the intervention models have been standardized and nowadays many aspects of COVID-19 pandemic\nmanagement appear clearer and more shared (Coccia, 2023, 2023a).\nEven though there has been a progressive homogenization of the medical intervention protocols and health\npolicies to combat COVID-19 (Coccia, 2022b), one of the most controversial aspects is to explain why case\nfatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19 in some countries is higher than other ones (CFR is the proportion of people\nwho die of COVID-19 among all individuals diagnosed with this new infectious disease over a certain period of\ntime). The literature highlights that there are several factors that can contribute to differences in COVID-19\nfatality rates across different regions and/or nations (Shakor et al., 2021; Sorci et al., 2020; Khan et al, 2020).\nThese factors are determined by characteristics of population like size and age composition, and health status\n(Dowd et al., 2020; Sanyaolu et al., 2020; Cao et al, 2020), but also by healthcare expenditure and capacity of\ncountries (Khan et al, 2020; Upadhyay and Shukla, 2021). Cao et al. (2020) found that the size of a country's\npopulation is associated with an increased case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19. Age composition is also a\nrelevant factor for negative impact of COVID-19 in society (Coccia, 2020a). Older individuals and those with a\nlot of comorbidities are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and dying from this infectious disease.\nLevin (2020) found that the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 is very low for children and younger\nadults but it increases progressively with age associated with a weaken immune system. Wolff et al. (2020) found\nthat age and comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease\ncourses. Sorci et al. (2020) found that the death rate due to smoking in people over 70 years is associated with\ntemporal changes in case fatality rate. In general, countries with older populations may therefore have higher\nfatality rates associated with pandemic diseases (cf., Galv\u00e3o et al., 2021).\nWhile demographic factors and characteristics of people are widely investigated, studies that focus on how the\nhealthcare expenditures and other structural factors of socioeconomic systems can affect the impact of COVID-\n19 in society are hardly know. Some papers suggest that healthcare capacity is associated with the fatality rate\nfor COVID-19. Khan et al. (2020) show that healthcare capacity is associated with a lower case fatality rate for\nCOVID-19. Sherpa (2020) reveals that austerity policies (e.g., health expenditure cuts) significantly increase the\nmortality rates of COVID-19 in all OCED countries. Other studies suggest that health expenditure is positively\nassociated with case fatalities (Khan, 2020). In this context, Coccia and Benati (2022a) analyze the relationship\nbetween public governance and COVID-19 vaccinations during early 2021 to assess the preparedness of\ncountries to timely policy responses to cope with pandemic crises. Results suggest that the improvement of\npreparedness of countries through good governance can foster a rapid rollout of vaccinations to cope with\npandemic threats and the negative effects of their socio-economic impact. To put it differently, countries with\nbetter healthcare systems and a greater access of people to medical, such as medical ventilators and personal\nprotective equipment (Coccia, 2023), may be better equipped to manage new airborne diseases, such as COVID-\n19, in order to reduce fatality rate.\nIn this research stream, the goal of this study is to examine the relationship between healthcare expenditures and\nhealth capacity, and COVID-19 case fatality rate variability in European countries. Healthcare expenditures are\nintended as the total amount of money spent on healthcare goods and services by individuals, organizations, or\ngovernments. These expenditures cover a wide range of healthcare-related expenses, including costs associated\nwith medical services (such as doctor's visits, hospital stays, and diagnostic tests), prescription drugs, medical\ndevices, public health programs, and health insurance. Healthcare capacity refers to the ability of the healthcare\nsystem to provide medical care to individuals who require it. This includes the availability of healthcare facilities,\nsuch as hospitals, clinics, and medical equipment, as well as the availability of trained medical personnel, such\nas doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. The capacity of a healthcare system can be measured in\nseveral ways, including the number of hospital beds available, the number of medical professionals in a given\narea, the amount of medical equipment and supplies on hand, and the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.\nThe choice to refer to the European countries is determined by the need to analyze a homogenous socioeconomic\ncontext to minimize variability in the characteristics of the population and the structural indicators. The\ncontribution here expands the knowledge in these research topics by endeavoring to clarify whether and how\nhealth expenditures affect the preparedness and management of countries to face unforeseen pandemic crisis. In\nparticular, this study try to explain the following research questions:\n\u2022 What are countries that have a better preparation to face unforeseen pandemic crisis (e.g., COVID-19)\nand minimize fatality rates, at beginning when effective drugs and treatments lack?\n\u2022 Do higher health expenditures reduce, associated with other factors, COVID-19 fatality at beginning and\nduring the evolution of pandemic waves?\n\u2022 What are driving forces supporting the resilience of countries to face unforeseen pandemic crisis?\nThe purpose of the present study is to see whether statistical evidence supports the hypothesis that the reduction\nof COVID-19 fatality, between European countries, can be explained by leveraging health expenditures and if\nso to form some quantitative analyses and estimates of the relation between health expenditures and COVID-19\nfatality rate between countries. The research is based on a quantitative approach, analyzing data from various\nsources, including Eurostat, World Bank, and OECD databases. To analyze the effect of healthcare expenditures\nand capacity on COVID-19 CFRs, we use data from European countries in different time periods, 2020 and\n2022. The study utilizes descriptive statistics, t-test and regression analysis to investigate whether there is a\nsignificant association between healthcare expenditures and capacity and COVID-19 case fatality rate in\nEuropean countries. Next section describes the study design of this study."

            "text": "The analysis of the data has highlighted the existence of a negative relationship between health expenditure and\nCOVID-19 fatality rate. When the first grows, the second decreases. These results can be due to several factors.\nFirstly, countries with higher health expenditures generally have better-equipped healthcare systems, which\nallow for earlier and more accurate diagnosis, more effective treatment, and better health management of crisis\n(Coccia, 2021, 2021c, 2022c-e). These countries may also have better governance and consequential public\nhealth infrastructure, such as disease surveillance and outbreak response systems, which can help to contain the\nspread of the virus and prevent outbreaks with appropriate health policies (Benati and Coccia, 2022, 2022a).\nSecondly, higher health expenditures may be associated with better overall health outcomes, including lower\nrates of chronic diseases and comorbidities that can increase the severity of COVID-19. Countries with stronger\nhealthcare systems may also have higher rates of vaccination and more effective public health contact tracing,\nwhich can reduce the spread of novel viral agents and protect vulnerable populations (Benati and Coccia, 2022,\n2022a). Finally, higher health expenditures may enable countries to invest in research and development of\nvaccines and treatments, which can reduce the severity and spread of the COVID-19 and similar infectious\ndiseases (Coccia, 2022c; 2022d, 2022e, 2023a). These countries may also have better access to medical supplies\nand equipment, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, which can help to mitigate the\nimpact of the pandemic (cf., Coccia, 2023).\nOverall, the negative relationship between health expenditure and fatality rate of COVID-19 highlights the\nimportance of investing in healthcare systems and public health infrastructure, supported by a good governance,\nas a means for improving preparedness in crisis management and protecting populations from the impact of new\ninfectious diseases similar to COCID-19 (Benati and Coccia, 2022, 2022a; Coccia, 2021, 2021c). The analysis\nof data has also highlighted the existence of a weak relationship between health capacity and fatality rate of\nCOVID-19 (see table 1). This evidence could be attributed to several factors. First, health capacity may not be\nsolely determined by healthcare spending or infrastructure but from overall structure and governance of\ninstitutions. Other factors, such as the quality of healthcare delivery, the availability and training of healthcare\nprofessionals, and the level of coordination between public health agencies and healthcare providers can also\nplay a role in determining health capacity to face emergencies. Therefore, investing in healthcare infrastructure\nor increasing healthcare expenditures may not necessarily result in a significant improvement in health outcomes\nand preparedness if it is not associated with a general good governance of national system. Second, the\nrelationship between health capacity and COVID-19 fatality rate may be influenced by other situational factors\nsuch as population density, age distribution, climate, air pollution, etc. (Coccia, 2020, 2020b, 2021b, 2021f).\nCountries with higher population density and older populations in regions having high air pollution and lower\ntemperature and wind speeds may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases, even if good\nhealthcare systems. Similarly, countries with high rates of chronic disease in population may experience higher\nCOVID-19 fatality rates, regardless of their health capacity. As a last argument, the weak relationship between\nhealth capacity and COVID-19 fatality rate, suggested by descriptive statistics, may be due to differences on\nhow countries report COVID-19 deaths. In general, variations in testing capacity, reporting standards, and data\ncollection practices can make it difficult to compare, ceteris paribus, COVID-19 fatality rates across countries.\nIn short, it challenging to identify clear patterns or relationships between health capacity and COVID-19\noutcomes. Overall, then, while strong healthcare systems and public health infrastructure are essential factors\nfor protecting populations from infectious diseases like COVID-19, these factors may not be the only\ndeterminants of higher or lower fatality rates (Coccia, 2022a). Other factors, such as population characteristics,\nguidelines in data reporting, climate, air pollution, new technologies, skilled human resources, etc. can also\ninfluence the relationship between health capacity and COVID-19 outcomes (Coccia, 2018, 2018a-b, 2019,\n2019a-c, 2021l; Coccia and Bellitto, 2018c-d)."

            "text": "The dynamics and effects of COVID-19 pandemic in society are due to a variety of factors associated with\nenvironmental pollution, climate, public governance, institutions, healthcare system, national system of\ninnovation, etc. (Allen Douglas, 2022; Angelopoulos et al., 2020; Ball, 2021; Barro, 2020; Coccia, 2019;\nGoolsbee and Syverson, 2021; Homburg, 2020; Pagliaro and Coccia, 2021; Wieland, 2020). In the presence of\npandemic crises, one of the goals of nations is to mitigate mortality and support the socioeconomic system\n(Coccia, 2021i). Studies analyze different interventions to cope with the spread of COVID-19 but how level of\nhealth expenditures can mitigate negative effects given by infections and deaths of new viral respiratory disease\nin society is hardly known. The statistical evidence in sections above seems in general to support the working\nhypothesis stated in Section 2, that the case fatality rates of COVID-19 can be explained by the level of health\nexpenditures between European countries that operate in a homogenous socioeconomic area. In particular, the\nfindings here suggest, between European countries, a negative relationship between health expenditure and\nCOVID-19 fatality rate, such that 1% increase of the Health Expenditure % GDP 2020, it reduces the level of\nCOVID-19 Fatality rate by 1.34%. Moreover, 1% increase of the Health Expenditure % GDP 2020, it reduces\nthe Difference COVID-19 Fatality rate 2022-2020 by 1.84% (p-value 0.01), improving the resilience of countries\nto face pandemic crises. In short, high levels of investments in healthcare sector, high levels of R&D investments\nand in new technology of mechanical ventilators, etc. support the preparedness and resilience of countries to face\nunknown infectious respiratory (cf., Coccia, 2021c, 2023, 2023a). To put it differently, the preparedness of\ncountries for next pandemic crises should be oriented to strengthen health system to cope with future health\nemergencies, especially when effective drugs to treat patients with acute respiratory illness are missing (Ardito\net al., 2021; Kluge et al., 2020; Kapitsinis, 2020). Hence, considering results of the study here, a basic aspect to\ncope with pandemics is a systematic planning, which should consider continuous investments in health sectors\nto support IT infrastructure, staffing and training.\nOverall, then, results of this analysis here seem to suggest that in the first pandemic wave of COVID-19, countries\nwith a high investment in health sectors and high healthcare expenditure per capita experienced a lower fatality\nrate of COVID-19. The findings here propose a general strategy of crisis management for future pandemic threats\nbased on high levels of investments in healthcare sector also focused on a widespread implementation of new\ntechnologies (such as high-tech medical ventilators) for improving national performance in health emergencies\nand support the overall preparedness of countries to cope with negative effects of pandemic impact on health of\npeople and socioeconomic system. These conclusions are of course tentative. There is need for much more\nresearch in these topics because not all the confounding factors that affect the COVID-19 fatality rates and role\nof health expenditures and capacity are discussed. Hence, results here have to be reinforced with a follow-up\ninvestigation based on new factors of economic systems for additional analyses of the relation between health\nexpenditures and COVID-19 fatality rate to better assess how it can reduce negative effects of next potential\nrespiratory diseases (similar to COVID-19) in society."
