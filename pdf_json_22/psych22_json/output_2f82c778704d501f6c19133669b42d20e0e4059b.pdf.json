            "text": "With the development and progress of the economy and society, traveling by car has become a common choice. However, the significant annual traffic accidents lead to a severe loss of life and property. According to the statistics from WHO, about 1.35 million people die from road traffic accidents every year, and road traffic accidents have become the leading cause of death among children and adolescents aged 5\u201329 (1). In China, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Public Security, the number of motor vehicles in China reached 395 million in 2021, including 302 million cars, and the number of motor vehicle drivers reached 481 million, including 444 million car drivers (1\u20133). The China Statistical Yearbook showed that the total number of traffic accidents in 2020 was 2,44, 674, with 61,703 people killed, 2,50,723 injured, and 1.31 billion RMB in direct property losses. In recent years, studies on the prevalence of psychological symptoms and associated correlators in motor vehicle drivers received some coverage (4, 5). For example, it is reported that occupational strain, neuroticism, and psychological symptoms are all positively correlated in metro drivers (6). Also, the study reported that bus drivers were significantly more extroverted, psychotic, and neurotic than the general population; and they were more likely to suffer from somatization and phobia (5). Similarly, some studies have reported the relationship between psychological status and traffic violations, especially for professional drivers. Data showed that bus drivers\u2019 traffic violations were mainly affected by specific socio-demographic characteristics, personality traits, and mental health, which increase the risk of traffic violations (7). Multiple personality traits, such as oppositional and negative affectivity, were also influential in predicting speeding and risky driving behaviors (8\u201310). Studies have also attempted to use the psychological state as a predictor of traffic violations and noted that drivers suffering from depression, anxiety, and neuroticism exhibit more risky driving behaviors (11, 12). However, most current studies come from western countries and few from lowand middle-income countries. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on professional drivers, including bus drivers, taxi drivers, subway drivers, and train drivers, and seldom involve the most significant number of private car drivers. In addition, previous studies mainly focused on the prevalence of one specific psychological symptom of the drivers but less involved a wide range of psychological symptoms or in specific traffic violations and traffic accidents simultaneously (13\u201315). Hence, in a Chinese sample, this study was designed to explore the prevalence of psychological symptoms in private car drivers and their associations with risky traffic behaviors and related accidents. At the same time, the relationship between psychological symptoms and the number of times the private car drivers passed the test was also analyzed, providing the basis for early identification and intervention."

            "text": "Our paper is the first study to explore the prevalence of psychological symptoms and their impact on driving behavior\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nin a sample of Chinese private vehicle drivers. The overall prevalence rate of any psychological symptom was 10.24%, higher than that of the general population in the absence of COVID-19 (19, 21), lower than that of the general public during the level I emergency response to COVID-19 andmedical health workers (22\u201324). The difference in prevalence seemed to be related to the area, survey tool, survey period, and characteristics of the survey\u2019s target group. Previous studies have noted that younger drivers were more likely to experience psychological symptoms, and the prevalence of psychological symptoms was reported to rise during and after the post-COVID-19 era (25\u2013 27). Our findings showed that the a part of the highest prevalence ranked the same among the top five psychological symptomsobsessive-compulsive followed by interpersonal sensitivity, additional items, hostility, and depression in the general population (24). However, the ranking order was not consistent with the survey results of bus drivers with high somatization\nand phobia scores (5). These inconsistencies were related to the difference in subjects, driving years, and gender composition. Not surprisingly, gender differences influenced the prevalence of psychological symptoms. Consistent with most previous research (28, 29), the prevalence rates of all psychological symptoms were higher in female drivers than in males.\nIn this study, all psychological symptoms seemed associated with traffic violations/accidents. Obsessive-compulsive and interpersonal sensitivity had the strongest correlation with traffic violations, while phobic anxiety had the weakest. Potential explanations include: (1) Drivers with interpersonal sensitivity or obsessive-compulsiveness often show excessive attention to other people or external influences, making it challenging to timely correct potentially risky driving behaviors. (2) Drivers with obsessive-compulsiveness or interpersonal sensitivity often exhibit concerns about traffic accidents and\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nrepeatedly-checking behaviors while driving (30, 31). The behavior mentioned above can further lead to inattentive driving and traffic violations. (3) Most obsessive-compulsive patients have psychiatric comorbidities, in which attention defense/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) proved to be associated with risky driving behaviors (32, 33). Meanwhile, drivers with hostility often show difficulty in controlling their emotions and behaviors, making drivers more prone to aggressive or reckless behavior under stress and anger (34). Anxiety was identified as the most related factor among drivers with traffic accidents. Consistent with previous research findings, anxiety was associated with insomnia, loneliness, longer working hours, and a higher risk of traffic accidents. Our study noted that somatization was least associated with traffic accidents, which is inconsistent with previous findings (35). Wang et al. (5)\nclaimed that somatization was a crucial marker for traffic accidents due to the driver\u2019s body\u2019s chronic vibration, leading to autonomic and vestibular organ dysfunction. The characteristics of target groups, driving time, and age distribution might be responsible for these differences (5, 15, 36). Our findings also indicated that psychological symptoms affect drivers in many ways, including the driving behavior after obtaining the driver\u2019s license and the success rate of passing the DLT for the first time. However, the influence of each psychological symptom on the driver\u2019s behavior was also different. It is worth noting that individuals with phobic anxiety and paranoid ideation were not statistically associated with the frequencies of passing the DLT in the first round, which might be related to the specific symptoms of the two symptoms with uncontrollable fear and anxiety about an unknown outcome, prompting\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nthem to repeat the exercises. Therefore, drivers who fail the DLT for the first time can be considered a critical group to undergo the early psychological screening program. This study has several limitations. First, recall bias related to selfreporting traffic violations and traffic accidents is not avoidable among these private car drivers. Second, this study is a nonprobabilistic sampling survey, and the extrapolation of the results needs to be cautious. Finally, the SCL-90 checklist is a measurement for psychological symptoms screening rather than diagnosis."

However, there are both overlaps and uniqueness among psychological symptoms and differences in the correlation and intensity between each psychological symptom and traffic violations/accidents. Both correlations between (a) obsessive-compulsive symptoms and general traffic violations and (b) anxiety symptoms and traffic accidents appeared the strongest, reminding us to pay more attention to these issues. Notably, failing the firsttime driver\u2019s license test can be an early predictor for psychological screening since most psychological symptoms are associated with failing the driver\u2019s license test. Therefore, the following tertiary prevention strategies need to be in place to reduce risky driving behavior: (a) primary prevention, screening for psychological symptoms among those who failed their first driver\u2019s license test. (b) secondary prevention,\nscreening for psychological symptoms among drivers with traffic violations, and offering necessary intervention. (c) screening and diagnosing psychological disorders and offering comprehensive intervention for those who have experienced traffic accidents."
