    "abstractText": "The disease of SARS-CoV-2 has caused considerable morbidity and mortality globally. Spike proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 allow it to bind with human cells, leading to infection. Fullerenes and their derivatives are promising SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and drug-delivery vehicles. In this study, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and the Markov state model were employed to delve into the inhibitory mechanism of Fullerene\u2013linear-polyglycerol-b-amine sulfate (F\u2013LGPS) on spike proteins. During the study, it was discovered that fullerene derivatives can operate at the interface of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD), keeping structural domains in a downward conformation. It was also observed that F-LGPS demonstrated superior inhibitory effects on the XBB variant in comparison to the wild-type variant. This study yielded invaluable insights for the potential development of efficient therapeutics targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "The disease of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the economy and society globally, resulting in deaths, healthcare shortages, reduced economic activity, social isolation, and mental-health deterioration. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1\u20133]. The XBB strain is a highly transmissible and immuneescaping variant of the Omicron variant, which requires attention to vulnerable populations and close monitoring [4]. According to previous research, the first step in infection is the binding of the spike (S) protein to ACE2 [5]. The homotrimeric S protein is located on the surface of the viral membrane, and each monomer consists of two domains, S1 and S2, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively. The S1 domain is composed of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) [6]. The binding affinity of ACE2 varies, depending on the orientation of the RBD. The closed state in which all RBDs are downward is inaccessible to ACE2 and, thus, it is inactive, while an open state with RBDs flipped upward can bind to the receptor [7,8]. Specific sulfated polysaccharides, including fucoidans and heparin, can bind tightly to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, which suggests that they can act as decoys to interfere with S-protein binding to the heparan-sulfate co-receptor in host tissues, inhibiting viral infection [9]. Functionalized fullerene can be used as a drug-delivery agent with\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14471. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241914471 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14471 2 of 15\ninhibitory activity [10,11], and animal experiments have also proven the good pulmonarydrug-delivery effect of fullerenes [12]. Fullerene-linear polyglycerol b-amine sulfate (F\u2013 LPGS) is a kind of functionalized fullerene that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2. It displayed an IC50 of 0.32 \u00d7 10\u22123 M against the wild-type variant, and IC50 between 2.02 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 0.20 \u00d7 10\u22123 M against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant. Fullerene derivatives have shown potential in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 [13]. The Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulation (GaMD) [14] is a useful method to investigate the conformational changes of proteins, protein folding, protein\u2013 ligand binding, etc. [15\u201319]. In the GaMD approach, the harmonic boost potential was added so that the energy barrier could be reduced by smoothing the potential surface and, thus, accelerating the transition between different conformational states for the purpose of enhanced sampling. Here, the increased lifting potential followed the Gaussian distribution, allowing the original potential surface to be easily recovered. Thus, this enhanced simulation approach is very suitable for studying the dynamics of complex biological systems. Markov state models [20] can cluster protein conformations in molecular dynamics trajectories and separate them into classes called microstates. Each microstate corresponds to a state in the Markov model state\u2019s space, and there is a transition probability between each state, forming a transition-probability matrix. By using the transfer-probability matrix and flux-analysis methods, the dynamic relationships between various microstates can be analyzed. In this study, we employed Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations and the Markov state model to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of F-LGPS on the spike protein, especially towards RBD and NTD, in both the wild-type variant and the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2."

To evaluate the stability of the simulations, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the C\u03b1 atoms was calculated; the RMSD values of the NTD and RBD are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The RMSD of NTD in both WT and WTF groups was higher compared to XBB and XBBF, indicating a slightly lower stability compared to the XBB and more conformational changes. The RMSD values of the RBD in all four groups were similar. Overall, the RMSD of all four systems was within 4 \u00c5, suggesting the good overall stability of the simulation systems and their suitability for further analysis. The radius-of-gyration value is shown in Figure 1c, and the mean value is presented in Figure 1d. After binding with F\u2013LPGS, the overall Rg of both the WTF and the XBBF decreased, indicating a closed conformation after binding, and the protein was not in an extended conformation. The SASA of the RBD also decreased, as shown in Figure 1e,f, indicating a smaller hydrophilic area, which suggested that the protein was in a closed conformation, with a reduced surface area. We then calculated the RMSF values of the C\u03b1 atoms for the four systems to define stable residues. By selecting the centroid of the most stable residues with the lowest RMSF value located on the axis of RBD and NTD domains, we defined dihedral angles that described the relative motion of the RBD and NTD. The results of the RMSF and the chosen residues are shown in Figure 2. The defined dihedral angles were Q226-F42-Y383-P494 for WT and WTF, and T226L41-D375-L493 for XBB and XBBF.

Next, the backbone-torsion angles were extracted from the trajectories to characterize the conformational space. To simplify the conformational space, a time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) was applied to reduce the dimensions. Subsequently, the reduced-dimension data were clustered into discrete states using k-means clustering algorithms. The VAMP2 scores for different numbers of cluster centers are shown in Figure S1, and the results of the clustering are shown in Figure S2. The lag time was determined to be 0.8 ns, as shown in Figure S3. The transition probabilities between the states were estimated by constructing a transition matrix, which captured the dynamics of the system.

Our findings reveal that fullerene derivatives, such as F-LGPS, can effectively bind at the RBD\u2013NTD interface, maintain the structural domains in a closed conformation, and reduce the likelihood of transitioning to an open or upward conformation. This action inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing valuable insights for the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Our study also demonstrates that these fullerene derivatives exhibit a stronger inhibitory effect on the XBB (Omicron) variant compared to the wild-type. This observation suggests the potential applicability of these derivatives in suppressing the spread of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as the highly infectious Omicron variant. The binding-free-energy analysis and hydrogen-bond analysis further support the enhanced inhibitory effect of F-LGPS on the XBB variant. The results of the Markov state model reveal the protein\u2019s dynamic behavior and conformational changes in the presence and absence of F-LGPS. In systems without FLGPS, the protein tends to stabilize in a relatively open conformation after RBD wobbling compared to systems with F-LGPS. In the presence of F-LGPS, the protein directly enters the closed conformation at a high level of flux from the initial state, and a small portion transitions into a closed conformation after undergoing swinging and a small number of open conformations.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14471 10 of 15\nThese findings have important implications for the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic and its evolving variants. By understanding the inhibitory mechanism of fullerene derivatives on the spike protein, we can contribute to the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors with enhanced efficacy and safety profiles. Future studies should focus on the experimental validation of these findings and the optimization of fullerene derivatives for improved efficacy and safety in clinical applications. Additionally, further research into the inhibitory effects of fullerene derivatives on other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will be crucial in addressing the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."

In this study, PyEMMA 2.5.7 [41] was utilized to construct MSM through the following workflows. First, the backbone-torsion angles were extracted from each frame in the MD trajectories to discriminate different conformations. Next, the dimension of the space was reduced to two collective coordinates using time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) [42]. This technique retains 95% of the dynamic variance of the original data and identifies the slowest modes in a feature space by maximizing the autocorrelation of reduced coordinates. The TICA method is preferred for MSM construction over principal component analysis (PCA), since it takes into account kinetic information. We then used VAMP-2 scores, where VAMP stands for variational approach for Markov process, to ascertain the number of cluster centers [43]. Next, the conformations for each system were clustered into microstates using the k-means algorithm. A transition-count matrix was constructed by counting the number of transitions between each pair of microstates at an appropriate lag time using the sliding-window approach. The transition-probability matrix was then obtained using the Bayesian MSM estimator [44]. Timescales were examined to determine when the system becomes Markovian [45]. As shown in Figure S3, a lag time of 0.8 ns was chosen. The Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov test [46] was employed to evaluate the validity of the Bayesian Markov model, revealing a nearly perfect agreement between the estimated transition probabilities calculated from the MD data and the predictions of the MSMs, suggesting the validity of the MSMs. Subsequently, these microstates were further divided into macrostates using the PCCA algorithm [47]. Finally, the TPT was used to elucidate the transitions between these macrostates and the highest-flux pathway [48]. The conformations presented in Figure 9 are representative of each macrostate."
