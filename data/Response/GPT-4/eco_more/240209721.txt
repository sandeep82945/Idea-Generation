Exploration of Different Learning Algorithms: Given the distinct outcomes observed when agents employ no-regret, no-swap-regret, and mean-based learning algorithms, a natural extension of this research could involve exploring additional learning algorithms or hybrids thereof. Investigating how alternative or newly developed learning algorithms affect the principal's utility, especially those that might bridge gaps between no-regret and no-swap-regret behaviors, could provide deeper insights into strategic information design and agent behavior modeling.

Empirical Validation in Real-World Scenarios: While the theoretical models presented offer significant insights, empirical validation in real-world scenarios could further strengthen the applicability of these findings. Future research could involve conducting experiments in various settings, such as online marketplaces, auctions, and negotiation platforms, to observe how different learning algorithms used by agents affect the outcomes in principal-agent interactions. This could also involve developing and testing software agents that implement these learning algorithms in simulated environments.

Impact of Agent's Information Access on Learning and Decision-Making: The paper assumes varying levels of knowledge and rationality on the part of the agent. Future research could delve deeper into how the quality and quantity of information available to the agent (e.g., partial vs. full information about the principal's strategy, access to historical data) influence the learning process and the overall dynamics of the principal-agent problem. This line of investigation could lead to developing more robust models that account for information asymmetry and its impact on strategic decision-making.

Extension to Multi-Agent Systems: Extending the model to scenarios involving multiple agents could uncover complex dynamics not observable in single-agent systems. This could include exploring how agents' learning algorithms interact with each other in competitive or cooperative settings and the resulting implications for the principal's strategy. Research could focus on developing strategies for the principal to manage or harness these interactions to maximize utility.

Integration of Behavioral Economic Theories: Integrating insights from behavioral economics into the models of agent learning and decision-making could offer a more nuanced understanding of principal-agent interactions. For instance, investigating how cognitive biases, risk preferences, and social preferences influence the agent's response to the principal's signals could lead to the development of more sophisticated persuasion and negotiation strategies that account for human behavioral complexities.
