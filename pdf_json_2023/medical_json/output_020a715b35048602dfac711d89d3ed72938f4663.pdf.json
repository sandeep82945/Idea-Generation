    "abstractText": "Vitamin D deficiency in children is a common nutritional issue in many populations worldwide, associated not only with skeletal malformations but, as recent studies suggest, also with the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this observational study was to assess the nutritional status of vitamin D in a group of Polish children with obesity and different grades of metabolic syndrome, with a consequent analysis of the correlation between vitamin D levels and the components of metabolic syndrome. For that purpose, the group of 78 participants (mean age: 14.18 \u00b1 2.67 years) was recruited and further grouped in relation to vitamin D status into two groups of children with and without vitamin D deficiency. The biochemical parameters associated with obesity as well as anthropometric measures were assessed and analysed in search of significant differences between the groups. In the current group of children with obesity and vitamin D deficiency, HDL (45.00 \u00b1 9.29) and adiponectin (7.21 \u00b1 1.64) were found to be significantly lower than in their peers without vitamin D deficiency, whereas W/HtR (0.60 \u00b1 0.04) and TG (171.31 \u00b1 80.75) levels proved to be significantly higher. Body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance returned no significant findings. The above findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency may influence lipid and glucose metabolism in children, leading to the development of abnormalities characteristic of the metabolic syndrome. A W/HtR parameter was shown to be a sensitive marker of abdominal obesity, which might provide an important means of assessing the correlation between vitamin D and this type of obesity. Independently, vitamin D deficiency may also influence the endocrinological function of adipose tissue, leading to lower concentrations of adiponectin. These in turn presented a linear correlation with the high results of the OGTT in the second hour of the test, hinting at its potential role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance.",

Its active form is calcitriol, also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which is a product of renal and hepatic conversion of cholecalciferol. Cholecalciferol, or vitamin D3, is synthesised in the skin after exposure to UVB light. Deficiency of vitamin D, defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol, 25OHD) concentration below 20 ng/mL [1], gives rise to comorbidities associated with pathological skeletal development.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 914. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13080914 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 914 2 of 11\nIt might result from low exposure to sunlight, inadequate vitamin D supply in the diet, or renal or hepatic diseases [2]. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is not a disease itself but rather a combination of risk factors that together contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In its pathophysiology, the most crucial factor is a long-term positive energy balance. It consists of such features as insulin resistance, high blood glucose level (\u2265100 mg/dL), dyslipidaemia (TG \u2265 1.69 mmol/L or treatment of high TG; HDLC < 1.03 mmol/L for men or <1.29 mmol/L for women or HDL treatment), hypertension (\u2265130/85 mmHg or treatment of hypertension), and high waist circumference (\u2265102 cm for men or \u226588 cm for women). In order to diagnose a MetS, at least 3 of the 5 above-mentioned features must be found [3]. Previous studies suggested that MetS and comorbidities of obesity are associated with vitamin D deficiency [4\u20138]. Unrelated to factors such as age and race, vitamin D seems to influence glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and the inflammatory response, as shown by the positive correlation between levels of vitamin D, leptin, and adiponectin and the negative correlation between vitamin D and the homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR) or waist circumference [9,10]. By modulating levels of adipokines, low vitamin D status may also stimulate the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [10,11]. In this study, an observational analysis was performed on a group of 79 children and adolescents in terms of the correlation between 25OHD levels and anthropometric measures of obesity, levels of adiponectin, markers of MetS, as well as MetS itself. The aim of this study was to evaluate the previously reported results and confront them with the results obtained from the Polish paediatric group."

The cut-off point for severe obesity was a BMI equivalent to the BMI of an adult equal to 35.0. In all but one patient, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (W/HtR) were measured.

A student\u2019s t-test for independent samples was used to compare the anthropometric and biochemical parameters between groups of patients with and without vitamin D deficiency. The same test was used for the comparison of 25OHD values between groups of patients with and without MetS.

Although it may result from nutritional rickets and growth retardation related to low levels of 25OHD and calcium [19], it was also shown to result from the increased weight of children with VDD, as reflected by a high BMI [17]. Contrary to the results of studies that focused on parameters like BMI, WC, and WHR without examining W/HtR, it was the latter parameter that proved to be significantly different between the groups in this study, whereas WHR and BMI-z scores did not. The significance of the difference in W/HtR values was also higher (p = 0.02) than in the previous report (p < 0.05) [17]. This parameter is considered useful in assessing abdominal obesity and cardiovascular disease in children and adults; in the latter group, it is also reported to be superior to other anthropometric parameters such as WHR and BMI [20,21]."

Low values of HDL cholesterol are associated with the development of cardiovascular diseases [21,22], as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus [23], which underlines the importance of HDL as a MetS component. Interestingly, research on African patients showed that low HDL is the most frequent MetS component in this population [24]. The correlation between 25OHD levels and HDL-c is a matter of discussion; the results of studies show both the presence and the lack of such a correlation. Research con-\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 914 7 of 11\nducted on Korean and Iranian children without obesity [6,14], as well as Tunisian children with obesity [7], showed a lack of significant differences in HDL levels between the VDD and VDS groups. Moreover, supplementation of 25OHD in African-American adolescents led to no significant difference in HDL levels between VDD and VDS adolescents, which is consistent with the results of studies on adolescents with obesity [8,15]. Results of another study showed similar differences in HDL levels, although after adjusting them for ethnicity, socioeconomic status, WC, and BMI, these observations were no longer significant [5]. On the contrary, a positive correlation between HDL and 25OHD levels (r = \u22120.306; p < 0.001) was found in a previous study on 114 Turkish children and adolescents. The results of the present study did not show any significant correlation between these two parameters (r = 0.02; p > 0.05), though the HDL levels did differ significantly between the VDD and VDS groups (p < 0.05). Low levels of HDL with simultaneous high levels of TG are described as atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which is associated not only with the development of atherosclerosis but also insulin resistance [25]. Hypertriglyceridemia influences the mean arterial pressure, leading to arterial hypertension as well as other cardiovascular diseases [26]. Contrary to HDL, high TG levels have been widely recognised as a MetS component that is significantly correlated with 25OHD nutritional status in children and adolescents with and without obesity [4,6,7,14]. The difference in TG levels between previously studied populations of children with deficient and sufficient 25OHD levels remained statistically significant after adjustment for BMI, age, and gender [16]. However, in adolescents with severe obesity and in children with or without obesity, no statistical difference in TG levels between VDD and VDS groups was observed [5,8]. Supplementation of 25OHD also did not lead to any significant improvement of TG levels in groups of African-American adolescents with obesity, independent of its success in reinstating 25OHD sufficiency [15]. Levels of TG measured in the population of the current study differed significantly (p < 0.02) between children with and without VDD and were more significant than in most studies on associations between 25OHD and TG levels [7,14,16]."

            "text": "Obesity is associated with the inflammatory process of adipose tissue in the whole body, leading to decreased levels of adiponectin [27], which is a component of the metabolic syndrome. The Jackson Heart Study showed that higher values of adiponectin in male African Americans correlate with a lower risk of hypertension [28]. Although lower adiponectin levels are considered to be associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, studies examining this link returned ambiguous results [29,30]. Recently, an adiponectin-involving parameter\u2014the leptin/adiponectin ratio\u2014was suggested as a measure reflecting insulin resistance [31]. In the studied group of patients, the leptin/adiponectin ratio was not significantly different between the VDD and VDS groups, nor did it correlate with levels of 25OHD. It did, however, present a significant correlation (r = \u22120.24; p < 0.05) with values of blood sugar in the second hour of OGTT, which suggests its association with the development of insulin resistance. Elevated levels of adiponectin also correlated significantly with impairment of left atrial functions and consequently with the frequency of atrial fibrillation in the examined populations of patients with diabetes and hypertension [32]. In the previous studies, the adiponectin levels differed significantly between the groups of children with and without vitamin D deficiency (p < 0.001) [4], even after adjustment for age and gender (p = 0.02) [5]. Supplementation of 25OHD in African-American adolescents with obesity did not result in a significant difference in adiponectin levels between the VDD and VDS groups [15]. In the present study, significantly lower (p < 0.02) concentrations of serum adiponectin were found in the VDD group than in the VDS group (mean: 7.21 \u00b1 1.64 vs. 8.84 \u00b1 3.95). The correlation between vitamin D levels and adiponectin levels (r = 0.17) did not reach significance (p > 0.05).\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 914 8 of 11"

According to the interventional trials, the parameters of glucose metabolism in relation to 25OHD improved after the lifestyle intervention, which included dietary counselling and regular physical activity [33], although the supplementation of vitamin D alone did not result in such an improvement [34]. None of the glucose metabolism-related parameters was significantly different between the VDD and VDS groups in the current study, but differences in levels of some of them\u2014glu120, ins0, and HOMA IR\u2014were approaching significance (respectively: p = 0.14; p = 0.19; p = 0.18). Together with the significant correlation between 25OHD and glu120 levels in the population of the current study, the above observations indicate that hypovitaminosis D does influence glucose metabolism and, as the previous studies suggest, may lead to the development of related comorbidities, such as insulin resistance."

Children meeting 3 or 4 MetS criteria had a lower mean 25OHD level (15.43) than those meeting only 1 or 2 MetS criteria (16.44). In either case, however, these mean values were within the range of vitamin D deficiency. Taking all the above observations into consideration, as well as the fact that differences in many of the examined parameters\u2014BMI-z score, glu120, ins0, and HOMA-IR\u2014were approaching significance, it is clear that the examined children who had an inadequately low level of vitamin D present a wide range of metabolic disorders that, when not addressed properly, might result in the development of severe complications. Observed hypertriglyceridaemia, an increased waist-to-height ratio, and lower levels of HDL and adiponectin indicate that these patients are at high cardiovascular risk, despite the fact that they do not always meet the required criteria for MetS, as both groups of children (MetS and non-MetS) showed mean values of 25OHD falling into the category of vitamin D deficiency. Considering the ambiguity of the results of previous studies examining the role of vitamin D in MetS as well as the prominent influence of 25OHD on the metabolic condition of patients, it may be reasonable to reassess the applicability of MetS criteria in the cases of patients with hypovitaminosis D. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this study is the first to describe the correlations between vitamin D deficiency and the components of MetS in the Polish paediatric population, with simultaneous comparison with the results of studies on groups of children from other regions of the world."

Studies on larger populations are needed to confirm the findings and generalise them to broader populations. The groups of children with and without vitamin D deficiency were adequately matched for age, severe obesity, and BMI-z score; however, they were significantly different in terms of gender (p < 0.005). Mean vitamin D concentrations also differed between the overall groups of boys and girls enrolled in the study, though the significance of this difference could not be examined statistically due to the imbalance of groups in terms of gender ratio. An issue of gender differences in vitamin D concentrations is difficult to address, as the results of studies on this matter are ambiguous [36,37], and there are no separate reference ranges of serum vitamin D concentrations for males and females. Due to the enrollment system based\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 914 9 of 11\non the patients attending control visits at the clinical centre, other confounding factors affecting the results, such as diet, physical activity, genetic predisposition, and seasonal variations in vitamin D levels, were not taken into consideration in this study. The latter factor is especially crucial, as the variability of serum vitamin D concentrations between the astronomical winter and summer months is apparent in Poland [38], similarly to the neighbouring countries [39]. As suggested by the results of studies on adults and children, the differences in duration of sun exposure might also be an important factor [40,41]. Many of the observed differences were approaching the significance threshold, which indicates that research on larger groups of patients is required to sufficiently examine the relations between the parameters. Patients were divided into groups characterised by sufficient/deficient levels of vitamin D, whereas it might be useful to use a category of suboptimal vitamin D levels (20\u201330 ng/mL 25OHD), as the patients with these results could give an insight into the early metabolic changes associated with hypovitaminosis D."
