 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on using soy protein hydrolysates to stabilize palm olein during deep frying:

1. Investigate the antioxidant and oil-stabilizing effects of peptides from the soy protein hydrolysates. The paper showed the pepsin hydrolysate had better activity, likely due to its peptide composition. Specific peptides could be isolated and tested for their antioxidant effects in oil.

2. Study the effects of the soy protein hydrolysates on the quality and shelf life of the fried food. This paper focused only on the oil stability. It would be useful to also assess how the hydrolysates affect lipid oxidation, texture, color etc. in the fried banana chips. 

3. Evaluate the antioxidant effects of the soy protein hydrolysates in other vegetable oils such as sunflower, canola, corn oil etc. during frying. Since oil composition affects stability, the effects may differ in other oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

4. Examine the impacts of frying parameters such as temperature, food type, frying time etc. on the efficacy of the soy protein hydrolysates. Varying these factors could provide insights into the optimal conditions for the hydrolysates to exert antioxidant effects. 

5. Study the sensory qualities of fried foods with the soy protein hydrolysate additions. An analysis of taste, aroma, color acceptability by consumers would provide important information for potential commercial use of the hydrolysates as natural antioxidants.
