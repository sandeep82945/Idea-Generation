1. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of other PGMs, such as platinum, rhodium, and iridium, from spent automotive catalysts.** This would help to expand the applicability of the proposed method and further demonstrate its potential for the sustainable recovery of PGMs.


2. **Explore the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of PGMs from other secondary sources, such as electronic waste and spent chemical catalysts.** This would help to further demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method and its potential for the recovery of PGMs from a variety of sources.


3. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of PGMs from primary ores.** This would help to determine the potential of the proposed method for the sustainable recovery of PGMs from virgin sources.


4. **Study the environmental impacts of the proposed method, including the life cycle assessment of the biogenic thiosulfate production and the leaching process.** This would help to ensure that the proposed method is truly sustainable and environmentally friendly.


5. **Develop a pilot-scale or industrial-scale process for the recovery of PGMs from spent automotive catalysts using biogenic thiosulfate.** This would help to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for large-scale applications and pave the way for its commercialization.
