A many-body non-stationary system whose slow relaxation dynamics also breaks time-translation-invariance and is such that the single-time correlator \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, r) and the two-time auto-correlator \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) obey the dynamical scaling (1.2), is said to be ageing [2\u20135].\nFor phase-ordering, with a non-conserved order parameter, some general exact results exist for models with short-ranged interactions. First, the dynamical exponent \ud835\udc67 = 2 for a non-conserved order parameter [6, 7].1 Second, the Yeung-Rao-Desai inequality states that \ud835\udf06 > \ud835\udc51/2 [8]. Third, for the 2D Ising model one has the Fisher-Huse inequality \ud835\udf06 6 5/4 [9]. Some typical values for \ud835\udc67 and \ud835\udf06 are listed in table 1. They illustrate the sharpness of these exact bounds and permit a comparison between short-ranged and long-ranged interactions. The agreement of the available experiments [10, 11] with the 2D universality classes is very satisfying. For more detailed tables, see [4].\nHow is the scaling behaviour, encoded in the scaling forms (1.2), modified in a system confined to a domain of finite size, e.g., being placed into a box?\nFor a phenomenological answer, consider figure 1. For a fully finite hyper-cubic lattice with \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51 sites and periodic boundary conditions, the single-time correlator \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r) is shown in figure 1a, where r is oriented along one of coordinate axes. If the spatial distances \ud835\udc5f = |r| are not too large, the shape of the correlator does not depend sensitively on \ud835\udc41 . Only if \ud835\udc5f . \ud835\udc41/2, does the correlator also receive contributions \u2018from around the world\u2019, such that for \ud835\udc5f \u2248 \ud835\udc41/2 it no longer tends towards zero, but rather saturates at a \ud835\udc41-dependent constant\ud835\udc36 (1)lim (\ud835\udc41) > 0. Figure 1b shows the two-time auto-correlator\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60). For large \ud835\udc60, but \ud835\udc66 small enough, there is a clear data collapse. However, for larger values of \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc36 begins to decrease more rapidly than the infinite-size curve (1.2b).2 As \ud835\udc66 1, \ud835\udc36 finally saturates at the limit value \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e (\ud835\udc41) > 0.\nAlthough the single-time correlator does not display strong finite-size effects, this is different for the\n1In this work, we restrict to this model-A dynamics. 2Since for lattices large enough that the system is just leaving the effective finite-size regime, the local exponent estimates \ud835\udf06eff (\ud835\udc66) may slightly over-estimate \ud835\udf06. In certain cases this might lead to claims of violation of exact upper bounds such as the Fisher-Huse inequality.\n13501-2\nlength scale \ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) of the growing clusters, estimated from the second moment \ud835\udc3f2(\ud835\udc61) = \u2211\nr |r|2\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r)\u2211 r\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r) . (1.4)\nThe precise extent of the sums is specified below. Figure 2 shows that for sufficiently short times, the length \ud835\udc3f2(\ud835\udc61) \u223c \ud835\udc61 behaves as for the infinite system, but as \ud835\udc61 grows further, finally there occurs a cross-over towards a finite constant \ud835\udc3f\u221e(\ud835\udc41). We can see how to explain the findings of figures 1 and 2 in terms of phenomenological finite-size scaling. The resulting predictions are tested in the exactly solved kinetic spherical model, for dimensions 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4.\nThe spherical model of a ferromagnet [28\u201330] served as an exactly solvable, yet non-trivial, model for the detailed analysis of general concepts of critical phenomena, see [31] for a historical perspective. Its non-equilibrium behaviour after a quench was also thoroughly analysed, see [4, 25\u201327, 32\u201340]. The related Arcetri model provides a qualitative description of the dynamics in the non-equilibrium growth of interfaces [41, 42]. Finite-size effects at equilibrium were also analysed at great depth in the spherical model and were of value to test the theory of finite-size scaling derived from the renormalisation group, see [43\u201352] and references therein. For dimensions \ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 = 4, that is above the upper critical dimension, the standard finite-size scaling ansatz must be considerably modified [49, 53\u201358].\nFinite-size scaling techniques were applied in studies of phase-ordering kinetics [20, 21], the ageing of polymer collapse [59\u201362] or the dynamics of mitochondrial networks [63]. Explicit studies of finite-size scaling in an ageing system were carried out in Ising spin glasses [64] and notably on the dimensional cross-over between the 3D and 2D Edwards-Anderson spin glass [65] motivated by extremely accurate experiments on CuMn films [66, 67]. In addition, finite-size effects analogous to figures 1 and 2 are clearly visible in the time-evolution of characteristic cluster sizes in long-ranged Ising models quenched to \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 [14] or in the auto-correlator [15]. Since the bulk 3D spherical model and the bulk (\ud835\udc5d = 2) spherical spherical spin glass are in the same dynamic universality class [36], one might hope that finite-size effects could be similar as well. Not so! Rather, detailed studies of the (\ud835\udc5d = 2) spherical spin glass [68, 69] show that this equivalence only holds in the spin glass for times \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61cross \u223c \ud835\udc412/3. For time\n13501-3\nscales \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61cross, ageing still holds with a new set of universal exponents [69], to be followed by a second cross-over to a regime of exponential decay at extremely large times [68].\nThis work is organised as follows. In section 2, we recall the main features of dynamical scaling in ageing phase-ordering kinetics. In section 3, we extend this phenomenological treatment to finite systems,\nusing the hyper-cubic geometry \ud835\udc51\u2217 factors\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc51\u2212\ud835\udc51\u2217 factors\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 \u221e\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u221e, where the first \ud835\udc51\u2217 6 \ud835\udc51 directions are finite and periodic and the other \ud835\udc51 \u2212 \ud835\udc51\u2217 directions are infinite. The finite-size forms so obtained are checked in section 4 using the exact solution of the kinetic spherical model in 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4 dimensions, quenched to \ud835\udc47 > \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 from a totally disordered state and in section 5 we conclude. Technical details of the exact solution are given in the appendix."

Writing (2.1) means that we assume negligible all finite-time and finitedistance corrections to scaling. Choosing \ud835\udf05 = \ud835\udc60\u22121/\ud835\udc67 , this gives\n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; r) = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf19/\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc60 , 1; r \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67\n) .

Setting \ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc61 in (2.2), this leads to \ud835\udf19 = 0 and3 further to \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r) = \ud835\udc36 ( 1, 1; |r|\ud835\udc61\u2212/\ud835\udc67 ) =: \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 ( |r|\ud835\udc61\u2212/\ud835\udc67 ) .

From (1.4) and (3.3), we derive the finite-size scaling form\n\ud835\udc3f2(\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc41\u22121) = \u2211\nr |r|2\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r; \ud835\udc41\u22121)\u2211 r\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; r; \ud835\udc41\u22121)\n' \ud835\udc612/\ud835\udc67 \u222b dr ( |r|\ud835\udc61\u22121/\ud835\udc67 )2 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 ( |r|\ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc61)\u222b\ndr \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 ( |r|\ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc61; \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc612/\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f\n( \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udc61\n) . (3.5)\nFor \ud835\udc4d 1, the behaviour of an effectively infinite system requires that \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc4d) \ud835\udc4d 1' \ud835\udc530 = const and for \ud835\udc4d 1, the time-independent saturation in figure 2 is captured by \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc4d) \ud835\udc4d 1\u223c \ud835\udc4d2/\ud835\udc67 such that \ud835\udc3f\u221e(\ud835\udc41) \u223c \ud835\udc41 , as would have been expected from dimensional analysis.\nNext, we consider the plateau in the two-time auto-correlator\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) for \ud835\udc66 1, see figure 1b. Recall that for the infinite system, we expect from (1.2b) and (1.3) that \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; 0; 0) = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60) \u223c ( \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60 )\u2212\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 . For \ud835\udc41 < \u221e, we reformulate (3.2) as follows\n\ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; \ud835\udc41\u22121 ) = \ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; 0; 1\n\ud835\udc41\n) = \ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc60 , 1; 0; \ud835\udc60\n1/\ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udc41\n) = ( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )\u2212\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 F\ud835\udc36 (( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )1/\ud835\udc67 , \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc41 ) . (3.6)\nHerein, the first argument in the scaling function F\ud835\udc36 = F\ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc62 ) will be considered large and be kept fixed, \ud835\udc66 1. In that case, the scaling function will describe the cross-over between (i) the infinite-system 4Very interesting adaptations of this idea were brought forward in the study of the kinetics of polymer collapse, where \ud835\udc41 is now the finite number of monomers, but the spatial geometry of the system was not specified [61, 62]. 5Spatially anisotropic finite-size effects could be taken into account by introducing distinct finite sizes \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57 in different spatial directions.\n13501-5\nbehaviour (when \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc41 \u2192 0) \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66) = F\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66, 0) \u223c \ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 , which is independent of \ud835\udc60, and (ii) the fully finite-system behaviour (when \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67/\ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e), when \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc66 1 \u2212\u2192 \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e no longer depends on \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60.\nThe first limit case is taken into account by admitting F\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc62) ' F ( \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62 ) and F(0) = const. Then, the second limit case leads to\n\ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; 0; 1\n\ud835\udc41\n) \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60 1 ' ( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )\u2212\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 F (( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )1/\ud835\udc67 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 1/\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc41 ) \u223c ( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )\u2212\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 [( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 )1/\ud835\udc67 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 1/\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc41 ]\ud835\udf14 , (3.7)\nwhere in the last step, we assumed a power-law form of F(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62) \u223c ( \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62 )\ud835\udf14 for \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc62 1. The \ud835\udc66-independent plateau\ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e observed for fully finite systems (see figure 1b for \ud835\udc60 fixed) is reproduced if we choose \ud835\udf14 = \ud835\udf06. Hence, for finite systems with \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60 1\n\ud835\udc36 ( \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60; 0; 1\n\ud835\udc41\n) \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60 1 \u2212\u2192 \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e \u223c ( \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67\n\ud835\udc41\n)\ud835\udf06 . (3.8)\nHerein, \ud835\udc60 is still kept fixed whereas \ud835\udc41 must be taken large enough such that the system under study is indeed in its finite-size scaling regime (in other word, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\u22121/\ud835\udc67 must be large enough).\nHence, for fully finite systems, quenched to \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50, the auto-correlator \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc66 1 \u2212\u2192 \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e ,\nsuch that the plateau value \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e = \ud835\udc36 (2) \u221e (\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc41) should obey the scalings\n\ud835\udc36 (2) \u221e \u223c \ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udf06 with \ud835\udc60 fixed, \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e \u223c \ud835\udc60\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc67 with \ud835\udc41 fixed. (3.9)\nThese are the sought scalings for the plateau of the auto-correlator and the main result of this section. The inset in figure 1b shows the data collapse of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) to a \ud835\udc66-independent constant for \ud835\udc66 large enough and \ud835\udc60 fixed, in the 3D spherical model, where \ud835\udf06 = 32 . In the next section, (3.9) is verified analytically from the exact solution of the quenched kinetic spherical model in dimensions 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4.\nA simple heuristic argument to establish (3.8) goes as follows. For widely different times \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udf0fmic, the asymptotic form of the auto-correlator is expressed through the cluster sizes \ud835\udc3f as \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) \u223c[ \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61)/\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc60) ]\u2212\ud835\udf06. If furthermore \ud835\udc61 is so large that \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) \u223c \ud835\udc41 while \ud835\udc60 is small enough such that still \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc60) \u223c \ud835\udc601/\ud835\udc67 , the scaling (3.8) of the plateau \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e follows."

After a quench from the disordered initial state (4.4c) to a temperature \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc51), we find in the FSS limit (3.4) (see the appendix for calculations):\n(A) the single-time temporal-spatial correlator, namely\n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; n) = \ud835\udc402eq exp \u00a9\u00ab\u2212\u03c0 \ud835\udc51\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc61 \u00aa\u00ae\u00ac \ud835\udc51\u2217\u220f \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udf173 ( i\u03c0 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc61 , e\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc4d ) \ud835\udf173 ( 0, e\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc4d\n) (4.10a) = \ud835\udc402eq exp\n\u00a9\u00ab\u2212\u03c0 \ud835\udc51\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=\ud835\udc51\u2217+1 \ud835\udc5b2 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc61 \u00aa\u00ae\u00ac \ud835\udc51\u2217\u220f \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udf173 ( \u03c0\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc57/\ud835\udc41, e\u2212\u03c0/\ud835\udc4d ) \ud835\udf173 ( 0, e\u2212\u03c0/\ud835\udc4d\n) , (4.10b) where \ud835\udc402eq = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc47/\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc51) is the squared equilibrium magnetisation and \ud835\udc4d was defined in (3.4) with \ud835\udc67 = 2. Finally, \ud835\udf173(\ud835\udc67, \ud835\udc5e) = \u2211\u221e \ud835\udc5d=\u2212\u221e \ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udc5d2 cos(2\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc67) is a Jacobi theta function [72]6. See figure 1a for illustration. From (4.10a) we identify the finite-size scaling function \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udf1a, \ud835\udc4d) in (3.3). The shape of this function is temperature-independent. Indeed, an universal shape of \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36 is expected, since the temperature \ud835\udc47 should be irrelevant in phase-ordering kinetics [1].\nEquation (4.10a) gives a factorisation of \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, n) = \ud835\udc36bulk (\ud835\udc61; n) \u00b7 \ud835\udc36red(\ud835\udc61; n; \ud835\udc41) into a size-independent \u2018bulk\u2019 part and a \u2018reduced\u2019 part which contains the finite-size effects. Because of the identity \ud835\udf173(\ud835\udc67+\u03c0, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udf173(\ud835\udc67, \ud835\udc5e), it is seen from (4.10b) that the correlator repeats periodically when \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc57 \u21a6\u2192 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc57 + \ud835\udc41 is in the finite directions, as illustrated in the inset of figure 1a. For \ud835\udc4d large enough7, the central peak of the correlator around n = 0 decays as in the bulk with a length scale \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) \u223c \ud835\udc611/2 such that the system decomposes into separate and independent clusters of linear size \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61), as expected. The bulk gaussian decay\u223c exp(\u2212n2/\ud835\udc61), rather than an exponential \u223c exp(\u2212|n|/ \u221a \ud835\udc61 ), is a peculiar property of the spherical model which distinguishes it from the Ising universality class.\n(B) the two-time auto-correlator, for all \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc51), reads\n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc402eq ( 2\u221a\ud835\udc66 1 + \ud835\udc66 )\ud835\udc51/2  \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp ( \u2212\u03c0 2\ud835\udc4d1+1/\ud835\udc66 ) )2 \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp(\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc4d) ) \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp(\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc66) )  \ud835\udc51\u2217/2\n(4.11a)\n= \ud835\udc402eq ( 2\u221a\ud835\udc66 1 + \ud835\udc66 ) (\ud835\udc51\u2212\ud835\udc51\u2217 )/2 [ \ud835\udf173 (0, exp(\u2212\u03c0 1+1/\ud835\udc662\ud835\udc4d ) )2 \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp(\u2212\u03c0/\ud835\udc4d) ) \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp(\u2212\u03c0/\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc66) ) ]\ud835\udc51\u2217/2 , (4.11b) as illustrated in figure 1b. We identify from (4.11a) the finite-size scaling function \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc4d) in (3.3), whose shape is once more temperature-independent. As above for the single-time correlator, (4.11a) displays a natural factorisation into the bulk two-time auto-correlator \ud835\udc36bulk (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc402eq [ 2\u221a\ud835\udc66 /(1 + \ud835\udc66)\n]\ud835\udc51/2 and a \u2018reduced\u2019 factor which alone contains all finite-size effects. Equation (4.11a) shows that for \ud835\udc4d 1, finite-size corrections with respect to the bulk behaviour are exponentially small. On the other hand, equation (4.11b) shows that for \ud835\udc4d 1, the system behaves effectively as if it had only \ud835\udc51\u2212 \ud835\udc51\u2217 dimensions, up to exponentially small corrections8.\nHaving verified the generic finite-size scaling forms (3.3), we now test the validity of the finite-size scaling predictions (3.9) for the plateau values \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e . To be specific, we consider a fully finite system, with \ud835\udc51\u2217 = \ud835\udc51. Fix the system size \ud835\udc41 and the waiting time \ud835\udc60 and consider the changes in \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc60 by varying the observation time \ud835\udc61. Physically, finite-size effects will be felt first by the larger length \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) \u223c \ud835\udc611/2.\n6Analogous expressions of the finite-size scaling functions in terms of Jacobi Theta functions are known for the particle density in several 1D reaction-diffusion processes for both periodic and open boundary conditions [75, 76] and for the single-time correlator in the periodic 1D Glauber-Ising model at temperature \ud835\udc47 = 0 [77].\n7Actually for \ud835\udc4d & 25, which in physical units corresponds to \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61 ) . 5\ud835\udc41 . 8Finite-temperature and finite-time effects merely give a corrective factor 1 + O ( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc601\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 ) , negligible for large waiting times\n\ud835\udc60 \u2192 \u221e, if \ud835\udc51 > 2.\n13501-8\nSince \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc60, we expect that \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc60). The limit \ud835\udc66 1 is realised by taking \ud835\udc61 1. With the identity \ud835\udf173 ( 0, e\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc66 ) = \ud835\udc66\u22121/2 \ud835\udf173 ( 0, e\u2212\u03c0/\ud835\udc66 ) , we have\n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc402eq\n( \ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc60/\ud835\udc61)1/2\n(\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc60)/2 )\ud835\udc51/2  ( 2 \ud835\udc412 \ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc60 )\u22121/2 \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp ( \u2212 \u03c02 \ud835\udc61+\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc412 )) \u221a\ufe02( \ud835\udc412 \ud835\udc61 )\u22121/2 \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp ( \u2212\u03c0 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc412 )) \ud835\udf173 ( 0, exp ( \u2212\u03c0 \ud835\udc412 \ud835\udc60 ))  \ud835\udc51\u2217 . (4.12)\nFor \ud835\udc412/\ud835\udc60 finite but large enough (such that the plateaux in figure 1b is reached), the last of the theta functions in (4.12) are very close to unity. Because of the condition \ud835\udc61/\ud835\udc412 1, the other two thetafunctions in (4.12) are also close to unity. Up to constants, we obtain\n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e\u223c ( \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc61 )\ud835\udc51/4 [( \ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc412 )1/2 (\ud835\udc412 \ud835\udc61 )1/4 const ]\ud835\udc51\u2217 \u223c ( \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc61 )\ud835\udc51/4 [ \ud835\udc61 (1 + \ud835\udc60/\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc611/2 ]\ud835\udc51\u2217/2 ( \ud835\udc41\u22122 1 2+2 1 4 )\ud835\udc51\u2217 . (4.13)\nFinally, now admitting a fully finite system such that \ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udc51\u2217, we have (for 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4) \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) \u223c ( \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc61 )\ud835\udc51/4 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51/4\ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51/4\ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc51/2, (4.14)\nwhich in view of the well-known results \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udc51/2 [25] and \ud835\udc67 = 2 [1] does indeed reproduce equation (3.8), or (3.9) if either \ud835\udc60 or \ud835\udc41 is kept fixed.\n(C) Characteristic time-dependent length scales \ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc61) of the ordered clusters can be measured as second moments of the single-time correlator\n\ud835\udc3f2(\ud835\udc61) := \u2211\nn n2\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; n)\u2211 n\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61; n) . (4.15)\nPrecise expressions follow from (4.10a) once the range of summation of the distances |n| is fixed. For example, if one measures the distances along one of the coordinate axes of one of the infinite directions, one obtains the \u2018transverse\u2019 length scale \ud835\udc3f2\u22a5(\ud835\udc61) = 4\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61, as for a fully infinite system [78]. On the other hand, if the distances are measured along the coordinates axes of one of the finite directions, we find a \u2018longitudinal\u2019 length scale, which reads for sufficiently thick films, and in agreement with (3.5)\n\ud835\udc3f2\u2016 (\ud835\udc61) = 1 \u03c0 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc4d), \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc4d) = \u03c0 6 \ud835\udc4d \u00a9\u00ab1 + 12\u03c02 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5d=1 (\u22121) \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc5d2 e\u2212\u03c0\ud835\udc5d 2/\ud835\udc4d\u00aa\u00ae\u00ac ' { \u03c0 6 \ud835\udc4d; if \ud835\udc4d 1, 1; if \ud835\udc4d 1.\n(4.16)\nThe scaling function \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc3f is temperature-independent. This describes the cross-over shown in figure 2, such that for \ud835\udc4d = \ud835\udc412/\ud835\udc61 small enough, we obtain saturation at \ud835\udc3f2\u2016 (\ud835\udc61) \u2192 \ud835\udc3f 2 \u221e \u223c \ud835\udc412, but on the other hand one has \ud835\udc3f2\u2016 (\ud835\udc61) \u223c \ud835\udc61 of an effectively infinite system for \ud835\udc4d large enough."

            "text": "We studied finite-size scaling in the ageing relaxation of phase-ordering kinetics after a quench from a disordered initial state into the two-phase coexistence regime with temperature 0 < \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50. The finite-size scaling ansatz (3.1) is the natural extension of dynamic finite-size scaling at equilibrium [71]. Phenomenologically, the observations to be gleaned from figure 1 for the single-time and two-correlations and figure 2 for the characteristic length scale are captured by the finite-size scaling forms (3.3). The form of the associated scaling functions is temperature-independent, which confirms the expectation that the temperature should be irrelevant in phase-ordering kinetics [1]. From these, the finite-size scaling (3.5) for the length scale \ud835\udc3f \u2016 (\ud835\udc61) and especially (3.9) for the plateaux \ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e in the two-time auto-correlator of a fully finite system were derived. We checked that these predictions are fully bourne out in the phase-ordering of the exactly solved kinetic spherical model, for 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4 dimensions.\nClearly, several open questions remain, including:\n13501-9\n1. Do the FSS predictions (3.3), (3.5), (3.9) also hold for other universality classes? For kinetic Ising models with either short-ranged or long-ranged interactions, detailed tests on all these have been carried out recently and will be reported elsewhere [79].\n2. Although the discussion was entirely formulated here in terms of classical dynamics, a finite-size scaling ansatz such as (3.3) should a priori also work for relaxations in quantum systems, either closed or open.\n3. Our analysis is restricted to below the upper critical dimension \ud835\udc51 < \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50. At equilibrium, it is wellknown that dangerous irrelevant variables lead to essential modifications of the finite-size scaling ansatz (3.1), (3.3) [49, 53\u201358]. Such modifications should also become necessary for the dynamics. Considerations of this kind might become crucial either for long-ranged interactions, where \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc50 is lowered with respect to the value \ud835\udc51 (short)\ud835\udc50 = 4 of short-ranged systems or else for \ud835\udc51-dimensional quantum systems (possibly with long-ranged interactions as well), for which at least the equilibrium quantum phase transitions at \ud835\udc47 = 0 are known to be in the same universality class as the corresponding (\ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udf03)-dimensional classical universality class at finite temperature, where the anisotropy exponent \ud835\udf03 > 1 [80].\n4. From figure 1b it appears that finite-size effects might create a spurious regime where the autocorrelator\ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) \u223c \ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udf06eff might look algebraic in a certain window; but rather the system already is the transition region between the rapid fall-off after having left the infinite-size behaviour of \ud835\udc36bulk (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) and the turn-around towards the saturation plateau\ud835\udc36 (2)\u221e . Since \ud835\udf06eff > \ud835\udf06, not recognising that this effect carries the risk of systematic over-estimation of the auto-correlation exponent \ud835\udf06, in simulations or in experiments.\n5. One may generalise dynamical FSS to critical quenches and to two-time response functions as well. The theory and numerical tests thereof will be presented elsewhere [79].\n6. Can one use (3.9) to devise improved methods for the measurement of \ud835\udf06?"

Recall the generalised Poisson resummation formula [82]\n13501-10\n\ud835\udc4f\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5b=\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc5b) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5e=\u2212\u221e \ud835\udc4f\u222b \ud835\udc4e d\ud835\udc65 e2\u03c0i\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) + 1 2 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc4e) + 1 2 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc4f) (A.2)\nand use this to deduce the important identity, for \ud835\udc5a \u2208 Z and \ud835\udc65 \u2208 R \ud835\udc41\u22121\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=0 exp ( 2\u03c0i \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udc65 cos 2\u03c0\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc41 \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5e=\u2212\u221e \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc41+\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65), (A.3)\nwhere \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc65) is a modified Bessel function [72]. Now, one writes as in [51], using equation (A.3) with \ud835\udc5a = 0 in the second line \ud835\udc51 times\n2\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc5d) = 2\ud835\udc37|\u039b| \u2211\ufe01\nk \u221e\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc61 exp \u2212 \ud835\udc5d + 4\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc51\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=1 ( 1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c0 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc57 ) \ud835\udc61 \n= 2\ud835\udc37 \u221e\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc61 e\u2212(\ud835\udc5d+4\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc51)\ud835\udc61 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc5e1 ,...,\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc51\u2208Z \ud835\udc51\u220f \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc57 (4\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61)\n= 1 2 \u221e\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc62 e\u2212 1 2 \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc62 [e\u2212\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3c0(\ud835\udc62)]\ud835\udc51 + 1 2 \u2211\ufe01\u2032 q\u2208Z\ud835\udc51 \u221e\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc62 e\u2212 1 2 \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\u220f \ud835\udc57=1 [ e\u2212\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc62) ] , (A.4)\nwhere one sets \ud835\udf19 := \ud835\udc5d/2\ud835\udc37. In the last line, the bulk contribution which arises from q = 0, is separated from the finite-size terms which have q \u2260 0 (indicated by \u2211\u2032). In what follows, restrict throughout to dimensions 2 < \ud835\udc51 < 4. First, standard techniques [25, 43, 46, 48] give the leading order of the Watson function\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udf19) for \ud835\udf19 1, as follows\n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udf19) := 1 2 \u221e\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc62 e\u2212 1 2 \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc62 [e\u2212\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc3c0(\ud835\udc62)]\ud835\udc51\n' \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc51 (0) \u2212 (4\u03c0)\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 \u0393 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc512 ) \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc51\u22122)/2 [1 + o(\ud835\udf19)] , (A.5)\nwith an implied analytic continuation in \ud835\udc51. Next, the finite-size terms are evaluated in the hyper-cubic geometry, such that the first \ud835\udc51\u2217 dimensions are finite (0 < \ud835\udc51\u2217 6 \ud835\udc51), with periodic boundary conditions (for simplicity, set \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc41 for all \ud835\udc57 = 1, . . . , \ud835\udc51\u2217).

(A.17) For \ud835\udc60 \u2192 \u221e, a Tauberian theorem relates the leading behaviour to the one of the Laplace transform at \ud835\udc5d \u2192 0 [81]. In turn, the behaviour of the two factors should be dominated by the long-time behaviour of the original functions. Therefore, one expects the leading contribution to be of the order [\ud835\udc540 is the amplitude of \ud835\udc54reg(\ud835\udf0f)]\n\ud835\udc36 [2] (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) ' 2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47\u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc54reg(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60)\ud835\udc54reg(\ud835\udc60) \ud835\udc60\u222b 0 d\ud835\udf0f \ud835\udc540\ud835\udf0f\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 ( 8\u03c0\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc66 + 1 2 (\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udc60 \u2212 2\ud835\udf0f) )\u2212\ud835\udc51/2\n' 2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc47 ( \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc602 )\ud835\udc51/4 \ud835\udc601\u2212\ud835\udc51 1\u222b 0 d\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 ( 4\u03c0\ud835\udc37 (\ud835\udc66 + 1) (\ud835\udc66 + 1 \u2212 2\ud835\udc63) )\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 = O ( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc601\u2212\ud835\udc51/2 ) (A.18)\nup to an \ud835\udc60-independent amplitude. For \ud835\udc51 > 2, \ud835\udc36 [2] (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc60) is negligible in the scaling limit where \ud835\udc60 \u2192 \u221e. Hence, for all temperatures \ud835\udc47 < \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50, the leading term of the auto-correlator is \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc36 [1] (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc60).\nFinally, introducing the scaling variables \ud835\udc4d and \ud835\udc66 in (A.15), and with the scaling 8\u03c0\ud835\udc37 != 1, we arrive at (4.11a). With (A.13), the equivalent form (4.11b) is obtained."
