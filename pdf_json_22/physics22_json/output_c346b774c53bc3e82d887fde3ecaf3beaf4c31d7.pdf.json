    "abstractText": "Quasi-Helmholtz decompositions are fundamental tools in integral equation modeling of electromagnetic problems because of their ability of rescaling solenoidal and non-solenoidal components of solutions, operator matrices, and radiated fields. These tools are however incapable, per se, of modifying the refinement-dependent spectral behavior of the different operators and often need to be combined with other preconditioning strategies. This paper introduces the new concept of filtered quasiHelmholtz decompositions proposing them in two incarnations: the filtered Loop-Star functions and the quasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters. Because they are capable of manipulating large parts of the operators\u2019 spectra, new families of preconditioners and fast solvers can be derived from these new tools. A first application to the case of the frequency and h-refinement preconditioning of the electric field integral equation is presented together with numerical results showing the practical effectiveness of the newly proposed decompositions.",

Andriulli, Senior Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014Quasi-Helmholtz decompositions are fundamental tools in integral equation modeling of electromagnetic problems because of their ability of rescaling solenoidal and non-solenoidal components of solutions, operator matrices, and radiated fields. These tools are however incapable, per se, of modifying the refinement-dependent spectral behavior of the different operators and often need to be combined with other preconditioning strategies. This paper introduces the new concept of filtered quasiHelmholtz decompositions proposing them in two incarnations: the filtered Loop-Star functions and the quasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters. Because they are capable of manipulating large parts of the operators\u2019 spectra, new families of preconditioners and fast solvers can be derived from these new tools. A first application to the case of the frequency and h-refinement preconditioning of the electric field integral equation is presented together with numerical results showing the practical effectiveness of the newly proposed decompositions.\nIndex Terms\u2014Integral equations, quasi-Helmholtz decompositions, quasi-Helmholtz projectors, preconditioning, EFIE.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nINTEGRAL equation formulations are effective numericalstrategies for modeling radiation and scattering by perfectly electrically conducting objects [1]\u2013[3]. Their effectiveness primarily derives from the fact that they only require the scatterers\u2019 surfaces to be discretized, automatically impose radiation conditions and, thanks to the advent of fast algorithms [4], give rise to linear-in-complexity approaches when solved with iterative schemes\u2014provided that the conditioning of the linear system matrices resulting from their discretizations is independent of the number of unknowns [5]. Among the wellestablished formulations, the electric field integral equation (EFIE) plays a crucial role, both in itself and within combined field formulations [6]. The EFIE, lamentably, becomes illconditioned when the frequency is low or the discretization density high [7]. These phenomena\u2014respectively known as the low-frequency and h-refinement breakdowns\u2014cause the solution of the EFIE to become increasingly challenging to obtain, as the number of iterations of the solution process grows unbounded, which jeopardizes the possibility of achieving an overall linear complexity.\nD. Consoli, L. Rahmouni, A. D\u00e9ly, and F. P. Andriulli are with the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, 10129 Torino, Italy; e-mail: name.surname@polito.it.\nA. Merlini and C. Henry are with the Microwave department, IMT Atlantique, 29238 Brest cedex 03, France; e-mail: name.surname@imt-atlantique.fr.\nManuscript received April 19, 2005.\nTraditional approaches to tackle the low-frequency breakdown rely on standard quasi-Helmholtz decompositions such as Loop-Star/Tree bases [8]\u2013[12] that, despite curing the lowfrequency behavior, worsen the h-refinement ill-conditioning of the EFIE [11] because of the derivative nature of the change of basis [12]. A way to circumvent the issue is the use of hierarchical strategies both on structured [13], [14] and unstructured meshes [15]\u2013[18]. These schemes, when designed properly, can solve both the low-frequency and the h-refinement problems but still rely on the construction on an explicit, basis-based, quasi-Helmholtz decomposition that requires the cumbersome detection of topological loops whenever handles are present in the geometry. A popular alternative strategy leverages Calder\u00f3n identities to form a second kind integral equation out of the EFIE. Calder\u00f3n approaches concurrently solve the low-frequency and the hrefinement breakdowns without calling for an explicit quasiHelmholtz decomposition [19]\u2013[26]. In their standard incarnations they do, however, require the use of a dual discretization and global loop handling, because global loops reside in the static null-space of the Calder\u00f3n operator. The introduction of implicit quasi-Helmholtz decompositions via the so called quasi-Helmholtz projectors [27], when combined with Calder\u00f3n approaches, led to the design of several wellconditioned formulations, free from static nullspaces (see [7], [27]\u2013[29] and references therein) and, in some incarnations, free from the need of performing a barycentric refinement [30]. Quasi-Helmholtz projectors have shown to be an effective and efficiently computable tool for performing quasi-Helmholtz decompositions, but, by themselves, they can only tackle the low-frequency breakdown and must be combined with Calder\u00f3n-like strategies that involve multiple operators, to obtain h-refinement spectral preconditioning effects. A set of tools as versatile as the projectors that could also manipulate the operator spectra beyond a simple rescaling would thus be desirable.\nThis paper introduces such a new family of tools. The contribution of this work is in fact threefold: (i) we will introduce the concept of Laplacian-filtered Loop-Star decompositions, a new quasi-Helmholtz decomposition approach that will allow for a finer tuning of the operator spectrum with respect to their standard Loop-Star counterparts. (ii) Just like standard Loop-Star bases give rise to the quasi-Helmholtz projectors, a suitable choice of projections on the filtered Loop-Star spaces will give rise to a new family of mathematical objects,\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n07 70\n4v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nN A\n] 1\n4 N\nov 2\n02 2\nthe quasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters, that will not require handling basis functions and explicit decompositions, while still providing the spectral tuning properties of (i). (iii) We will obtain new frequency and h-refinement preconditioners for the EFIE based on (i) and (ii) that represent a natural first application of the newly proposed techniques. We believe, however, that the applicability of the new spectral filters will extend beyond EFIE preconditioning in further investigations. The contribution will be further enriched by a section devoted to efficient implementations of the newly defined tools that will be obtained by leveraging strategies developed in the context of polynomial preconditioning approaches and in graph wavelet theory [31]\u2013[34]. Numerical results will then corroborate and confirm our theoretical considerations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the background material and the notation are presented in Section II, the new Laplacian filtered Loop-Star decompositions and the quasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters are presented in Section III and Section IV, respectively, along with their main properties. Various strategies for computing the filters, in practical scenarios, are detailed in Section V. Preconditioners tackling simultaneously the low-frequency and h-refinement breakdowns of the EFIE are then derived in Section VI. Finer details relating to the implementation and computation of the filters and preconditioners are then presented in Section VII. Illustrations of the effectiveness of the schemes are provided in Section VIII, before concluding in Section IX.\nPreliminary results from this work were presented in the conference contributions [35], [36]."

Equation (1) can be solved numerically by approximating \u0393 with triangular elements of average edge length h and by approximating the current density as J \u2248 \u2211N n=1[j ]nfn with the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions {fn}n [37], in which N is the number of\nedges in the mesh, j is the vector of the coefficients of the expansion, and fn is defined as\nfn(r) =  r \u2212 r+n 2A+n if r \u2208 c+n \u2212r \u2212 r \u2212 n\n2A\u2212n if r \u2208 c\u2212n ,\n(4)\nwhere the notation of Fig. 1 was employed and where A\u00b1n is the area of the cell c\u00b1n .\nThe final step to obtain the discretized EFIE is to test (1) with the rotated RWG functions {n\u0302 \u00d7 fn}, which results in the linear system\nTj = (Ts + Th) j = v , (5)\nin which [Ts]mn = \u3008n\u0302 \u00d7 fm,T s(fn)\u3009, [Th]mn = \u3008n\u0302 \u00d7 fm,T h(fn)\u3009, [v ]m = \u3008n\u0302 \u00d7 fm,\u2212n\u0302 \u00d7 Ei\u3009, and \u3008a, b\u3009 =\u222b \u0393 a \u00b7bds. The EFIE can also be discretized on the dual mesh using dual functions defined on the barycentric refinement. Both Buffa-Christiansen [38] and Chen-Wilton [39] elements can be used for this dual discretization. For the sake of brevity, we will omit the explicit definitions of the dual elements that will be denoted by {gn}n in the following; the reader can refer to [7] and references therein for a more detailed treatment. We will also need the definition of the standard and dual Gram matrices whose entries are [G]mn = \u3008fm,fn\u3009 and [G]mn = \u3008gm, gn\u3009. While they are not required for the discretization of the EFIE itself, we introduce the patch and pyramids scalar basis functions sets {pn} and {\u03bbn}, respectively composed of NS and NL functions, that will be required for some of the following developments. These functions are defined as\npm(r) = { A\u22121m if r \u2208 cm , 0 otherwise,\n(6)\nand\n\u03bbm(r) =  1 r = vm ,\n0 r = vn , n 6= m, linear otherwise,\n(7)\nwhere {vn}n are the vertices of the mesh. The number of these functions can be deduced from the mesh properties: NS is the number of mesh triangles and NL is the number of mesh vertices. The Gram matrices corresponding to these bases are Gp for the patch functions and G\u03bb for the pyramids with [Gp]mn = \u3008pm, pn\u3009 and [G\u03bb]mn = \u3008\u03bbm, \u03bbn\u3009. The dual of these functions, living in the barycentric refinement of the original mesh will also be required, and their definitions, omitted here for conciseness, can be found in [30]. The NL dual patches will be designated as {p\u0303n}n, the NS dual pyramids as {\u03bb\u0303n}n, and the corresponding gram matrices as Gp\u0303 and G\u03bb\u0303 with [Gp\u0303]mn = \u3008p\u0303m, p\u0303n\u3009 and [G\u03bb\u0303]mn = \u2329 \u03bb\u0303m, \u03bb\u0303n \u232a .\nBecause this contribution deals with discrete quasiHelmholtz decompositions we will recall some of their properties. The continuous solution J can be decomposed into a solenoidal, irrotational, and (on non simply-connected manifolds) harmonic components\nJ = \u2207\u00d7 n\u0302\u03bb+\u2207s\u03c6+ h . (8)\nWhen J is discretized by the approximate expansion in RWG functions, a discrete counterpart of (8) holds for the coefficient vector j\nj = \u039bl + \u03a3\u03c3 + Hh , (9)\nwhere \u039b \u2208 RN\u00d7NL and \u03a3 \u2208 RN\u00d7NS are the Loop-to-RWG and Star-to-RWG transformation matrices [9], [12], [40]\u2013[42] defined, following the convention of Fig. 1 and the definition of the RWG in (4), as\n[\u039b]mn =  1 if node n equals v+m ,\n\u22121 if node n equals v\u2212m , 0 otherwise,\n(10)\nand\n[\u03a3]mn =  1 if the cell n equals c+m ,\n\u22121 if the cell n equals c\u2212m , 0 otherwise.\n(11)\nWith these definitions \u039bT\u039b and \u03a3T\u03a3 are respectively the vertices- and the cells-based graph Laplacians [12]. The explicit use of the change of basis matrix H will not be required and we omit here its explicit definition, for the sake of conciseness, which could however be found in [7] and references therein.\nWith the definitions above, the standard quasi-Helmholtz projectors [12], [27] are defined as\nP\u03a3 = \u03a3 ( \u03a3T\u03a3 )+ \u03a3T ,\nP\u039bH = I\u2212P\u03a3 (12)\nfor the primal ones, P\u039b = \u039b ( \u039bT\u039b )+ \u039bT ,\nP\u03a3H = I\u2212P\u039b (13)\nfor the dual ones, and PH ( = PH ) = I\u2212P\u03a3 \u2212P\u039b (14)\nfor the projector to quasi-harmonic subspace, where + denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse."

The reader should note that, as in the case of standard Loop-Star functions, this operations will create a small number of isolated singular values, that however will not impact the convergence properties of the preconditioned equation. This effect will not be present instead in the scheme of next Section. The h-refinement regularization effect of this preconditioner can be deduced from the previous derivations for each of the potentials [50]. The low frequency regularization, can be demonstrated following the same reasoning as for standard Loop-Star approaches [7], since the new filtered bases retain the crucial properties that made Loop-Star so adapted low-frequency regularization in the first place\u2014 \u039b\u0303Tp,\u03b1T\u0303h = 0, T\u0303h\u039b\u0303p,\u03b1 = 0, and \u039b\u0303Tp,\u03b1\u03a3\u0303p,\u03b1 = 0.

            "heading": "B. Quasi-Helmholtz Filters Approach",
            "text": "In several application scenarios, an explicit quasi-Helmholtz decomposition, such as the Loop-Star decomposition, is not necessary, and quasi-Helmholtz projectors [7] could be used instead. Similarly, instead of using filtered Loop-Star preconditioning approaches, basis-free approaches, based on the quasi-Helmholtz Laplacian filters, will often be more effective. This Section will explore this approach that, as an additional advantage, will also have the avoidance of the burden of global-loop detection for multiply connected scatterers.\nFollowing the same philosophy as in Section VI-A, we will form preconditioners for the solenoidal part of T\u0303s and for T\u0303h\nthat will then be combined into a full EFIE preconditioner. We can transition from a basis-based Helmholtz decomposition to a projector based Helmholtz decomposition by leveraging the correspondences between \u03a3\u0303 and \u039b\u0303 and their respective projectors P\u0303\u03a3 and P\u0303\u039b. In particular, because B\u0303\u03a3\u0303 was a valid preconditioner for T\u0303h (equations (89) and (90)), [ B\u0303\u03a3\u0303 0 ] , once applied left and right to T\u0303h will yield a block diagonal matrix which is well conditioned away from its large nullspace. This, in turns, means that [ C\u0303\u03a3\u0303 0 ] , with C\u0303\u03a3\u0303 =\n\u03a3\u0303 ( \u03a3\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 )+ ( \u03a3\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 ) V\u0303\u03a3\u0303D\u0303 \u22125/4 \u03a3\u0303 V\u0303T \u03a3\u0303 V\u0303\u03a3\u0303D\u0303 1/2 \u03a3\u0303 , will also yield a well-conditioned (up to its nullspace) matrix.

IMPLEMENTATION RELATED DETAILS AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS\nIn addition to the efficient filtering algorithms presented in Section V, obtaining a fast and efficient implementation of the proposed preconditioning scheme based on filtered projectors requires that particular attention be given to parts of their implementation. First, all the terms of the form ThQ\u039bp,\u03b1, Q\u039bp,\u03b1Th, P\nHTh, or ThPH must be explicitly set to 0 to avoid numerical instabilities. Further treatments on the right hand side and on the solution vector, are required to ensure that the solution of the system remains accurate until arbitrarily low frequencies. These treatments are straightforward generalization of those required for standard quasi-Helmholtz preconditioning techniques that can be found in [7].\nThe condition numbers obtained when employing the schemes introduced in Section VI-A and Section VI-B, while stable, can be further brought down by slightly modifying the preconditioners. The diagonal preconditioning based on the theoretical Laplacian eigenvalues can be altered to instead employ matrix norms; the new preconditioners then become\nQ\u03a3p,\u03b1 = NS,\u03b1\u2211 l=2 ( P\u03a3\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P \u03a3 \u03b1l\u22121\u22121 ) bl+(\nP\u03a3 \u2212P\u03a3 \u03b1NS,\u03b1\u22121 ) bNS,\u03b1+1 , (108)\nwhere bl = \u2225\u2225\u2225(P\u03a3\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P\u03a3\u03b1l\u22121\u22121)T Th (P\u03a3\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P\u03a3\u03b1l\u22121\u22121)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22121/2 ,\n2 \u2264 l \u2264 NS,\u03b1 , (109)\nbNS,\u03b1+1 = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225(P\u03a3 \u2212P\u03a3\u03b1NS,\u03b1\u22121)T Th (P\u03a3 \u2212P\u03a3\u03b1NS,\u03b1\u22121) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22121/2 .\n(110)\nThe same modification can be performed for Q\u039bp,\u03b1 that becomes\nQ\u039bp,\u03b1 = NL,\u03b1\u2211 l=2 ( P\u039b\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P \u039b \u03b1l\u22121\u22121 ) dl+(\nP\u039b \u2212P\u039b \u03b1NL,\u03b1\u22121 ) dNS,\u03b1+1 , (111)\nwith dl = \u2225\u2225\u2225(P\u039b\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P\u039b\u03b1l\u22121\u22121)T Ts (P\u039b\u03b1l\u22121 \u2212P\u039b\u03b1l\u22121\u22121)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22121/2 ,\n2 \u2264 l \u2264 NL,\u03b1 , (112)\ndNS,\u03b1+1 = \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225(P\u039b \u2212P\u039b\u03b1NL,\u03b1\u22121)T Ts (P\u039b \u2212P\u039b\u03b1NL,\u03b1\u22121) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22121/2 .\n(113)\nTo ensure that the overall complexity of the algorithm is not increased, the values of {bl}l and {dl}l can be efficiently computed using, for example, power methods. The reader should note that the preconditioning approach delineated above requires filter profiles with support both proportional to and independent from the number of unknowns, which can be\nefficiently obtained with the approaches described in Section V. As said in the previous Section, filters in the transition region could be less efficient to obtain, as the Chebyshev approach decreases in efficiency away from the middle of the spectrum [34]. All preconditioning real case scenarios presented here, however, are not impacted by this fact as shown in Section VIII."

            "text": "All numerical results presented in this section have been obtained with non-normalized matrices (\u039b, \u03a3) to illustrate that graph matrices are often enough for practical cases. Equally good or superior performance, however, can be obtained by using normalized matrices (\u039b\u0303, \u03a3\u0303) instead. In the first set of examples we have leveraged perfect filters obtained by SVD before presenting results based on SVD-free approaches. The filtered Loop-Star preconditioning approach presented in Section VI-A leverages the spectral equivalences between the appropriately scaled filtered bases and Ts and Th. To numerically illustrate these equivalences, the spectra of these operators and their preconditioned counterparts are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. These spectra correspond to a smoothly deformed sphere (see Fig. 2 and 3), and the ordering of the singular values is obtained by projection against the graph Laplacians\u2019 eigenvectors. The original spectrum of Ts and Th show the expected \u03be\u22121/2 and \u03be1/2\u2014with \u03be the spectral index\u2014behaviors, predicted by pseudo-differential operator theory. Given the construction of the preconditioners, it is then not surprising that the preconditioned operators show a spectrum bounded (and away from zero) with the expected variations in the spectrum.\nTo illustrate that the preconditioning schemes based on filtered bases do regularize the EFIE, the condition number of\nthe original and preconditioned schemes will be compared for varying frequencies and discretizations. First, the conditioning of a filtered Loop-Star preconditioned EFIE for the NASA almond [51] is reported in Figure 4. The low frequency and dense discretization breakdowns of the original equations are apparent, while the preconditioned equation (corresponding to (96)) shows a constant conditioning. This is in contrast with the standard Loop-Star approach that does regularize the low frequency conditioning breakdown, but actually worsens the dense discretization behavior of the equation.\nA similar study has been performed with the filtered projectors schemes. In Figures 5 and 6 the spectra of the dominant solenoidal and non-solenoidal parts of the EFIE operators are displayed alongside their preconditioners. The preconditioning performance on the overall EFIE system is illustrated in Figure 7 for a torus. The approach yields satisfactory conditioning that remains stable in both low frequency and dense discretization, which in turns shows that the scheme can also handle multiply-connected geometries.\nFinally, a conditioning study of the NASA almond is reported in Figure 8 that has been obtained using Chebyshevinterpolated filters (78) corresponding to Butterworth filters of order 100, expanded into 200 Chebyshev polynomials. The coefficients of the filters are obtained via the norm estimates detailed in (108) and (111) and the cutting point of the filters is determined using the approximate Laplacian spectrum described bellow (76). The excellent stability of preconditioned scheme for a structure such as the NASA almond showcases the effectiveness of the scheme when using the fast techniques presented in this paper."

            "text": "In this appendix, we show that the properties P\u0303\u039b+ P\u0303\u03a3 = I and P\u0303 \u039b + P\u0303 \u03a3 = I hold true on simply connected geometries. To this end, we first prove that the normalized coefficients j\u0303 of the RWG functions can be decomposed with \u039b\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303, similarly as in (9) where we assume that the proper number of columns from the matrices have been removed as is standard to ensure a full column rank, such that\nj\u0303 = G\u2212 1 2 j = \u039b\u0303l\u0303 + \u03a3\u0303s\u0303 (114)\nin which l\u0303 and s\u0303 are the coefficient vectors of the normalized Loop and Star parts in this decomposition. Since G, Gp, and G\u03bb are invertible matrices, we have rank(\u03a3\u0303) = rank(\u03a3) and rank(\u039b\u0303) = rank(\u039b). Moreover, since \u039b\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 = 0, we also obtain that \u039b\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303 have their column linearly independent, which yields rank([\u039b\u0303 \u03a3\u0303]) = rank(\u039b\u0303) + rank(\u03a3\u0303) = N , from which the existence and (unicity) of (114) follows.\nSubsequently, using (114), we can form a new set of normalized projectors to retrieve \u039b\u0303l\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303s\u0303 separately. The\nfirst step is to apply \u039b\u0303T and \u03a3\u0303T to (114) to express j\u0303 in the two different bases\n\u039b\u0303T j\u0303 = \u039b\u0303T\u039b\u0303l\u0303 , (115)\n\u03a3\u0303T j\u0303 = \u03a3\u0303T\u03a3\u0303s\u0303 , (116)\nsince \u039b\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 = 0 and \u03a3\u0303T\u039b\u0303 = 0, given (20). Subsequently, we express the coefficients of the normalized Loop and Star bases as a function of j\u0303\nl\u0303 = ( \u039b\u0303T\u039b\u0303 )+ \u039b\u0303T j\u0303 , (117)\ns\u0303 = ( \u03a3\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 )+ \u03a3\u0303T j\u0303 . (118)\nFinally, we express \u039b\u0303l\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303s\u0303 in terms of j\u0303 by applying \u039b\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303 to (117) and (118)\n\u039b\u0303l\u0303 = \u039b\u0303 ( \u039b\u0303T\u039b\u0303 )+ \u039b\u0303T j\u0303 = P\u0303\u039b j\u0303 , (119)\n\u03a3\u0303s\u0303 = \u03a3\u0303 ( \u03a3\u0303T\u03a3\u0303 )+ \u03a3\u0303T j\u0303 = P\u0303\u03a3 j\u0303 , (120)\nand we obtain that P\u0303\u039b + P\u0303\u03a3 = I by leveraging (119), (120), and (114). Following the same procedure, except that now \u039b\u0303 and \u03a3\u0303 are employed in the initial decomposition, we can show that the property P\u0303 \u039b + P\u0303 \u03a3 = I also holds true."
