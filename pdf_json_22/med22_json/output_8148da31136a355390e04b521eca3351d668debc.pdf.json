    "abstractText": "This study explored the adaptation of parents raising a child with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) specifically the contributory role of positive perceptions, coping, self-efficacy, and social support. One hundred and thirty-six parents of children with a diagnosis of ASD completed a battery of self-report questionnaires via an online survey. Using multiple regression analyses positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy, and social support were each a significant contributor to one or more positive adaptation outcomes. Multiple moderated regression analysis found no evidence that these factors were significant moderators between behavioural problems and parental adaptation. The implications of these findings in supporting parents raising a child with ASD are outlined.",

Given the increased prevalence of ASD (Fombonne, 2020) and the central role that parents play in a child\u2019s life, it is imperative that there is a clear understanding of what helps parents adapt and manage the challenges associated with their child\u2019s ASD. The current study set out to explore the adaptation of parents raising a child with ASD, specifically the role of positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy and social support.\nCompared with parents of typically developing children and children with other disabilities the research consistently indicates higher levels of stress and anxiety, and lower quality of life for parents (Barroso et\u00a0al., 2018; Costa et\u00a0al., 2017;\nFoody et\u00a0al., 2014; Hayes & Watson, 2013; Vasilopoulou & Nisbet, 2016). It is therefore argued that ASD creates unique and complex stressors for families, presenting challenges that are different from other disabilities (Randall & Parker, 1999). Nonetheless, there is now growing evidence that families show resilience and adaptation, and that positive family outcomes are also evident (Bayat, 2007; Bekhet et\u00a0al., 2012; Halstead et\u00a0al., 2018; Manning et\u00a0al., 2011; McStay et\u00a0al., 2015; Meleady et\u00a0al., 2020). According to Bayat (2007) many families with a child with ASD demonstrate resilience, with factors such as the characteristics of the child, coping strategies, social support, and the perception of the problem, involved in their adaptation. Research has now begun to identify the factors that exacerbate negative outcomes and those that protect against negative outcomes."

Variables that have been researched as forms of appraisal in families of children with ASD include reframing (Manning et\u00a0al., 2011); benefit finding (Pakenham et\u00a0al., 2004), positive contributions (GarciaLopez et\u00a0al., 2016a), and positive perceptions (Halstead et\u00a0al., 2018; Hastings & Taunt, 2002; Sarria & Pozo, 2015). Positive perceptions refer to the parent\u2019s cognitive beliefs about their child with ASD as being a positive contributor to their family. This definition of positive perceptions is focused on the parents\u2019 defining their child with ASD as being a source of fulfilment and happiness, personal growth, and a source of closeness and strength, as derived from a number of key studies (Behr et\u00a0al., 1992; Hastings & Taunt, 2002). Studies which have examined this concept of positive perceptions have also included different terms to describe a similar concept e.g., positive contributions (Garcia-Lopez et\u00a0al., 2016a), meaning making, and benefit finding (Pakenham et\u00a0al., 2004).\nOverall, the research to date suggests that positive perceptions about their child may increase positive parent outcomes such as wellbeing and quality of life (Lickenbrock et\u00a0al., 2011; Meleady et\u00a0al., 2020; Sarria & Pozo, 2015), protect families from stress and help in their adaptation (GarciaLopez et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2016b; King et\u00a0al., 2011; Pozo, et\u00a0al., 2014). Halstead et\u00a0al. (2018) found that although positive perceptions had a main effect relationship with well-being of mothers, no evidence was found that they functioned as protective factors in moderating the relationship between behaviour problems and wellbeing for mothers raising a child with IDD. Similarly, Meleady et\u00a0al. (2020) found that while positive perceptions was a unique contributor to family quality of life and life satisfaction, it did not act as a protective factor in moderating the relationship between behaviour problems and parental outcomes. Similar to PSE however, research examining positive perceptions as a moderator is limited and requires further investigation."

Halstead et\u00a0al.

In addition, most studies explored the main effects of predictor variables on adaptation, whereas it is argued that a multidimensional approach is needed to explore the influence of different factors and the possible role of moderators (Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014). Furthermore, while it has been found that both positive and negative outcomes co-occur in families raising a child with ASD, only a small number of studies have examined both positive and negative outcomes of adaptation in families. In a similar vein, the research has been limited in examining parental positive perceptions and positive aspects to raising a child with ASD (Sarria & Pozo, 2015). Furthermore, the limited inclusion of fathers has consistently been noted in review studies (Braunstein et\u00a0al., 2013; McStay et\u00a0al., 2015; Rankin et\u00a0al., 2019). Finally,\n1 3\nthe research is also lacking in the inclusion of parents from lower socioeconomic environments and diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds (Corcoran et\u00a0al., 2015; Higgins, 2018; Lickenbrock, et\u00a0al., 2011)."

Parental adaptation was measured through parental stress, psychological wellbeing, family quality of life, and life satisfaction. The study aimed to address some of the limitations of previous studies by focusing specifically on parents of children of ASD, both mothers and fathers, both positive and negative outcomes, and including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. An understanding of the factors that promote parental adaptation is essential given parents\u2019 role in supporting and caring for their child with ASD (Xue et\u00a0al., 2014). An understanding of potential protective factors can in turn guide policy and practice (Tint & Weiss, 2016).\nIt was hypothesised that behavioural problems would increase parental stress and decrease family quality of life, psychological wellbeing, and life satisfaction; and that positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy, and social support would contribute to parental adaptation in a positive way i.e., decrease parental stress and increase family quality of life, psychological wellbeing, and life satisfaction. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that positive perceptions, adaptive coping, parental self-efficacy, and social support would act as protective factors (i.e., moderators) in the relationship between child behavioural problems and parents\u2019 adaptation. In other words, the association between behavioural problems and parental adaptation will be weaker when parents report higher levels of social support, adaptive coping, parental efficacy, and positive perceptions; in comparison to those reporting low levels of social support, adaptive coping, parental efficacy and positive perceptions."

Exclusion criteria were parents of a child with ASD who was residing in residential care. Parents who had more than\none child with ASD were asked to answer the questions in relation to their older child within that 4\u201318 age group.\nA total of 232 parents consented to participate in the current study. Ninety-nine parents partially completed the survey. Of these, only parents who were missing data from one or two measures were included in the sample (n = 3). The remaining 96 cases were excluded. This left a final sample of 136 parents of children diagnosed with ASD, 116 mothers (85%) and 20 fathers (15%). All were biological parents. Three mothers and fathers were part of the same family, yielding a sample of 133 families with a child with a diagnosis of ASD, all living in Ireland. The data presented in Table\u00a01 indicate the ages, marital status, income, educational level, and employment status of the parents. With regard to the characteristics of the child with ASD (N = 133) the age range was 4\u201318\u00a0years with the mean age of 10.5\u00a0years, (SD 3.8). Of them, 96 were male (73%), 36 were female (27%) and one recorded as non-binary. Parents self-reported on their child\u2019s diagnosis of ASD. The main category of diagnosis was ASD (81%), followed by Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (16%), and PDD_NOS (3%). This diagnosis was reportedly given by public sector multidisciplinary teams (65%); followed by private sector psychologist/ psychiatrist (31%); and other (3%) such as paediatrician. The mean length of time since their child had received their diagnosis was 5\u00a0years (SD 3.46\u00a0years), with a median of 4\u00a0years (M = 4; IQR (4)). Twenty percent of parents had more than one child with ASD. Co-morbid diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID) or global developmental delay (GDD) was reported for 32% of the children. In addition, 37% of the children had one or more additional co-morbid diagnosis (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; anxiety). Summary information on the child characteristics are also presented in Table\u00a01.\nThe sample size was initially determined through a power analysis conducted using the G*Power 3.1.9.4 computer programme. A post-hoc power analyses was also completed to confirm the a priori power analyses using the G*Power 3.1.9.4 computer program (Faul et\u00a0al., 2007).

Items are answered using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d, with higher scores indicating a higher amount of stress. A total score (i.e., overall level of parenting stress) was calculated in addition to the parental distress subscale (PD) which measures the distress experienced by parents due to personal factors, or life restrictions due to the demands of childrearing. The internal consistency has been reported as good in related studies (\u03b1 = .87 for PD scale; Garcia-Lopez et\u00a0al., 2016a). The internal consistency was good for the current study for both the total score and the PD subscale (\u03b1 = .92)."

The distribution of variables was examined by using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test. Those that yielded a significant result were examined and significant outliers removed so that they yielded a nonsignificant result and the histograms yielded reasonable normal distributions. This resulted in some small variations in the sample size for certain variables. The one exception was the BPI-S measure. The results were positively skewed with most parents recording relatively few behavioural problems. Data on atypical behaviour such as that gathered with the BPI are often positively skewed (Meleady et\u00a0al., 2020; Rojahn et\u00a0al., 2012a, 2012b).\nWith reference to the adaptation measures over half of parents (52%) reported overall levels of parental stress in the clinically significant range (i.e., over the 90th percentile). Using qualitative descriptors for family quality of life, the majority of parents are indicating a good- high quality of life rating whereas 4% reported a low/poor quality of life. The life satisfaction mean score indicates an average rating of life satisfaction in accordance with the scoring criteria by Pavot and Diener (2013).\nParental stress was positively associated with the age of the child with ASD (r = .19, p < .05); and number of children with ASD (r = .17, p < .05). Parental stress and distress levels (as measured by the PSI-SF i.e., total score and score for personal distress subscale) were significantly higher for families of lower income (i.e., below \u20ac30,000) than those of higher income (i.e., \u20ac60\u201389,000). This was statistically significant at the p < .05 level (F (3, 131) = 3.52, p = .017), (F (3, 131) = 3.19, p = .026) with a medium effect size. Family quality of life (FQOl) was significantly associated with marital status, in that FQOL was significantly lower for single parents (M = 69.23; SD 19.60; n = 13) than those who were married (M = 87.60; SD 17.66; n = 91). This was a significant difference at the p < .05 level (F (4, 129) = 3.12, p = .017), with a medium effect size. Similar significant results were found for psychological well-being and marital status (F (4,\n129) = 3.23, p = .015), and parental distress and marital status (F (4, 130) = 2.64, p = .037). Single parents reported significantly lower psychological wellbeing and higher levels of parental distress than parents who were married. These demographics were included in the main regression analyses as covariates for specific models."

            "text": "The current study set out to explore the adaptation of parents raising a child with ASD, specifically the role of positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy and social support, with reference to the Double ABCX model. The results indicate that over half (52%) of parents are experiencing clinical levels of stress in relation to their parenting. This\nfinding is well founded in the literature and supports the finding that raising a child with ASD has inherent stressors (Foody et\u00a0al., 2014; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al., 2015; Kiami & Goodgold, 2017). Nonetheless alongside these levels of parental stress, the majority of parents are indicating a good-to-high FQOL, with just 4% reporting a low or poor FQOL. Furthermore, the mean life satisfaction score for parents indicates an average rating of life satisfaction. The analyses highlight that parental adaptation as measured in this study yielded coexisting positive and negative adaptation outcomes. This is significant given that the preponderance of research to date has focused more exclusively on negative outcomes.\nMany of the hypotheses were supported. Behavioural problems regardless of type, severity or frequency, were all consistently associated with increased levels of parental stress. This finding is consistent with an extensive body of research which has consistently found a strong association between behavioural problems and parental stress (Barroso\n1 3\net\u00a0al., 2018; Yorke et\u00a0al., 2018). In addition, specific categories of behaviour problems showed significant negative associations with certain adaptation outcomes (e.g., aggressive/destructive behaviour with life satisfaction, selfinjurious behaviour with FQOl, and stereotyped behaviour with psychological wellbeing). These findings were all in the expected direction given the previous research findings that has found behavioural problems to impact negatively on psychological wellbeing and quality of life (Blacher & McIntyre, 2006; Sarria & Pozo, 2015; Vasilopoulou & Nisbet, 2016).\nAs hypothesised positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy and social support each had a positive association with FQOL, life satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing. Whereas each of these factors had a significant negative relationship with parental stress. These findings are in all in line with the literature to date (Kayfitz et\u00a0al., 2010; Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014; Sarria & Pozo, 2015). Furthermore, as hypothesised the factors of positive perceptions, adaptive coping, parental self-efficacy (PSE), and social support, were found to be significant contributors to one or more adaptation outcome even while controlling for specific demographics and behavioural problems.\nWith regard to parental stress both PSE and social support were significant contributors. These findings add to the body of research that has found social support to be a contributor to reduced stress levels (Lindsey & Barry, 2018; Pozo & Sarria, 2014). Thus, parents who perceive they have adequate social support are more likely to report reduced parental stress. While research has been more limited on PSE, this now provides further evidence that PSE contributes to parent outcomes positively. Furthermore, the study adds to the literature by identifying PSE as the strongest and most significant contributor to lower parental stress. Aggressive/destructive behaviour was also found to be a significant contributor to parental stress which is an expected finding given the literature, as this aspect of behaviour can challenge and cause most stress for parents (Blacher & McIntyre, 2006; Lecavalier et\u00a0al., 2006; Manning et\u00a0al., 2011; Tomanik et\u00a0al., 2004). While not hypothesised having more than one child with ASD and lower family income were also found to be significant contributors to parental stress. This is in line with studies that have found the increased demands for those with multiple children with ASD and the increased costs associated with raising a child with ASD (Dillenburger et\u00a0al., 2010; Roddy & O\u2019Neill, 2020).\nWith regard to FQOL, social support, PSE, and adaptive coping were each found to be significant positive contributors. This finding further adds to the evidence of the importance of social support (Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014), PSE, and adaptive coping (Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014) as contributors to positive parental outcomes in this case FQOL, where to date research has been limited on this as an adaptation outcome.

The identification of adaptive coping as a positive contributor is consistent with previous studies (e.g., Benson, 2012, 2014; Halstead et\u00a0al., 2018). While PSE has been found to be a positive contributor to mental health outcomes such as anxiety and depression (Hastings & Brown, 2002), it\nis perhaps not surprising that it was found to be a positive contributor to psychological well-being. Other significant contributors but to a lesser extent include stereotyped behaviour, and positive perceptions. In line with previous research behavioural problems have been shown to be a negative contributor to parental outcomes such as psychological\n1 3\nwellbeing and mental health (Blacher & McIntyre, 2006; Manning et\u00a0al., 2011).\nWhile in previous studies positive perceptions was found to be a positive contributor to psychological wellbeing (Sarria & Pozo, 2015), in the current study it was found to be a negative contributor. This is an unexpected finding given the research to date and given the earlier analysis found a significant and positive association between positive perceptions and psychological wellbeing. Possible explanations could be attributable to the model of analysis, and due to the interaction of multiple variables which can occur in hierarchical multiple regression analyses. It is also possible that there may be in fact this negative contribution which may be due to the possibility that seeing your child\u2019s positive contributions may result in a parent being more aware of their difficulties and disabilities which in turn may lead to reduced wellbeing.\nWith regard to life satisfaction, positive perceptions and social support were found to be significant contributors. While this finding is not surprising given that previous studies have found social support to be a significant contributor to positive parental outcomes such as life satisfaction\n(Halstead et\u00a0al., 2018; Meleady et\u00a0al., 2020), this is of significance given that research which has included life satisfaction as a parental outcome and positive perceptions as a contributory factor is still in its infancy.\nThus, in summary, the analysis of parental adaptation supports these four factors as being important and significant contributors to positive parental outcomes. PSE was demonstrated to be a positive contributor to parental stress, FQOL and psychological wellbeing and moreover was the strongest predictor for parental stress and psychological wellbeing. Social support was also a significant contributor to parental stress, FQOL, and life satisfaction and the strongest predictor to FQOL. Adaptive coping was a significant contributor to FQOL, and psychological wellbeing. Finally, positive perceptions was the strongest contributor to life satisfaction. The findings are overall consistent with previous research (e.g. Manning et\u00a0al., 2011; Sarria & Pozo, 2015), however the current study has added to the body of research while also highlighting new findings including variables that have been less studied (i.e., PSE, positive perceptions, FQOl, and life satisfaction). The analysis found that behavioural problems contributed to certain parental adaptation outcomes,\n1 3\nhowever of interest is that certain categories of behavioural problem contributed to specific adaptation outcomes. This is a significant finding which suggests the potential importance of examining different categories of behaviours. None of the behavioural problems was found to contribute to life satisfaction. While it was anticipated that behavioural problems would have contributed higher and more significantly to adaptation outcomes overall, it is possible that the behavioural measure may have been too narrow in focus and not broad enough to include all possible behaviour problems that occur in this population."

            "text": "The hypotheses that positive perceptions, adaptive coping, PSE, and social support would each act as a moderator in the relationship between behavioural problems and parent adaptation was not supported. The research has been limited in the exploration of such protective factors and the evidence mixed to date. However, the results are similar to Meleady et\u00a0al. (2020) who found that positive perceptions and social support did not act as moderators. Whereas Halstead et\u00a0al. (2018) found social support to have a moderating effect on the relationship between behaviour problems and parental stress and parental wellbeing. While the research is limited with PSE, it has been found to be a moderator between behavioural problems and anxiety in fathers (Hastings & Brown, 2002).\nWhile the results did not support these hypotheses there are two possible explanations. It is possible that the behavioural measure may have been too narrow in focus and may not have captured the full range of behavioural problems that can occur in this population. The results from the behavioural measure were low with the majority of parents reporting low levels of behavioural problems. Furthermore, it is clear from the previous analysis that these factors are contributing to parental adaptation, just not in the role of a moderator. So, while the current study did not identify a protective role (i.e., impacting when there are high levels of behaviour problems), it is possible that they are contributing to parental adaptation regardless of the level of behavioural problems.\nThe results altogether highlight the usefulness of the double ABCX model in understanding the adaptation processes and the interplay of factors when facing the potential challenges such as those in raising a child with ASD. It allowed for the investigation of positive and negative outcomes and enabled the examination of variables which contributes to the understanding of the resources that influence adaptation positively. This is consistent with previous research that has applied this model to examining adaptation in families of a child with ASD (e.g., Manning et\u00a0al., 2011; Meleady et\u00a0al., 2020; Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014)."

Given the high levels of parenting stress it is imperative that clinical services address this as part of their core work, through supports and direct intervention such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (Bazzano et\u00a0al., 2015; Cachia et\u00a0al., 2016). This is important as high stress levels can exacerbate behavioural problems and ASD symptom severity (Rodriguez et\u00a0al., 2019; Yorke et\u00a0al., 2018), reduce the effectiveness of interventions and result in poorer outcomes (e.g., Osborne et\u00a0al., 2008; Reyno & McGrath, 2006). In addition, given the strong association of behavioural problems with parental stress and other adaptation outcomes, addressing behavioural problems should be another core component of clinical services for families with a child with ASD. Providing skills training for parents to address these difficulties and at an earlier stage is likely to be beneficial. Furthermore, this could serve to indirectly reduce parental stress while also supporting and building PSE and positive coping skills.\nThe findings also support the use of a strength-based approach in working with families of a child with ASD. Conveying the message that families have the potential to positively adapt may be helpful for parents especially those new to the diagnosis. Murphy and Tierney (2014) found that parents new to the diagnosis wanted to hear positives in addition to the challenges. Furthermore, the Double ABCX model provides a useful framework for assessing adaptation, family stressors, resources, and areas of support need. In addition, using measures that capture family strengths, positive experiences and outcomes (e.g., FQOL, PCS) could be used in addition to using measures which are problem focused.\nGiven the positive contribution of PSE, adaptive coping, social support, and positive perceptions to parental adaptation, they each represent possible targets in clinical service provision. These are factors that can be promoted, facilitated, and encouraged in a number of ways. Increasing PSE and ensuring that parents feel confident in their role parenting their child with ASD is likely to be achieved directly and indirectly through skills training interventions and other supports (e.g., social support). Social support should be promoted to all parents through several avenues such as facilitating access to local support groups, providing psychoeducational groups within service, linking with national organisations; signposting to online supports, and referring those who may need to access further supports such as family support services and/or respite. As social support was measured through perceived social support it is also possible that helping parents perceive the environment as helpful will equally benefit parents\u2019 adaptation.\n1 3\nFacilitating a positive focus can occur through services adopting a perspective oriented towards the child\u2019s achievements and other positive aspects of his/her development, and family functioning, in addition to the challenges and problems. In a similar vein, Manning et\u00a0al. (2011) suggest the possibility of facilitating positive perceptions through exposure to other family\u2019s positive outlook about their child with ASD. Singer et\u00a0al. (1999) found that several parents reported that contact with a positive attitude in other families who have a child with a disability helped them to alter their own attitude in a positive direction. In addition, clinicians working with parents need to be aware of the coping strategies that parents use to manage the demands of parenting and in turn support them in their use of adaptive coping strategies (e.g., acquiring help and support, reframing, seeking spiritual support) over avoidant coping strategies.\nThe cost of raising a child with ASD is significantly greater than for those with a typically developing child (Dillenburger et\u00a0al., 2010), and thus it is not surprising that families raising a child with ASD can experience a financial burden specific to the care needs of their child, which is further exacerbated for those families with multiple children with ASD (Roddy & O\u2019Neill, 2020). The current study adds to this by highlighting those within the population at further risk in terms of increased stress levels due to certain demographics (i.e., those from low income families, and those with multiple children with ASD). These groups are therefore likely to need an elevated level of support."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "There were several limitations to this study that need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. First as this was a cross sectional study it prevented any conclusions regarding the directionality of relationships identified. The limited number of fathers participating in the study was a further limitation, especially as prior research which has managed to include both has found that mothers and fathers show different patterns of stress (Foody et\u00a0al., 2014), different use of resources, and differences in their adaptation to parenting a child with ASD (Hastings et\u00a0al., 2005a, b;\u00a0Pozo et\u00a0al., 2014).\nAnother factor which needs to be considered is the representativeness of the sample of parents raising a child with ASD. The majority of parents were Irish mothers who were in a relationship. Furthermore, given the study used a convenience sample, the sample may overrepresent engaged and motivated parents who may have differed from those who chose not to participate. The length of the survey and time taken for completion (i.e., 30\u201340\u00a0min) may have proved challenging to parents. This may have been the case for the ninety six parents who only partially completed the survey.\nAnother limitation is in relation to some of the measures used and the self-report nature of these measures. The behavioural measure used yielded low levels with many parents reporting low levels of behaviours. This measure may be more specific to those with ASD with co-morbid ID which in this current study was just 32% of the overall sample. The measure may not have detected the broader range of behavioural problems especially in those higher functioning children. This study relied on self-report measures from the same single source rather than any independent assessments or from other sources. In addition, the study did not examine the impact of other life stresses, or what is referred to in the Double ABCX model as pile up demands. It is possible that many of these families may have been experiencing other stressors in their life which were not captured, and which may have been impacting on their adaptation. Finally, it could also be considered a limitation that there was a lack of confirmation of the ASD diagnosis by a professional as part of the procedure.\nFuture research would benefit from longitudinal studies with more diverse samples including fathers, using a broader behaviour measure, and multi-informant measures particularly on critical variables such as child behavioural problems and FQOL. Investigating the possibility of social support, adaptive coping, positive perceptions, and self-efficacy, functioning as mediators in the role between behavioural problems and parental adaptation should be explored. In addition, research should also examine the role of other child characteristics (e.g., their strengths) in parents\u2019 adaptation. Given the difficulties in including fathers, future research could consider using other recruitment techniques such as snowballing. Other types of methodologies may also prove to be more fruitful such as qualitative methods e.g., focus groups."

            "text": "The findings support the well-established association between parenting stress and behaviour problems and the high levels of parental stress amongst this group. Despite this, there is evidence that there are co-existing indicators of positive adaptation in the form of family quality of life and life satisfaction. The role of positive perceptions, adaptive coping, self-efficacy, and social support in parents\u2019 adaptation was investigated and evidence found that these factors contributed positively to one or more adaptation outcomes, however none of these factors were found to act as protective factors. The findings have several implications for services for children with ASD and their families.\n1 3\nAuthor Contributions LH, AM, and GL contributed to conceptualization.
