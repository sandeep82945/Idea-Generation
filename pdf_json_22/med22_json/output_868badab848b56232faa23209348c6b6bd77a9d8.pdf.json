            "text": "Several constituents of the current global change are usually deemed accountable for the 28 worldwide declines of amphibian populations. Among these, water contamination poses a major 29 threat, especially to larval stages, which are unable to escape a polluted water body. This 30 problem is remarkable in agrosystems, one of the main sources of water pollution and whose 31 area is forecasted to increase in the forthcoming decades. However, pollutants represent a 32 selective pressure that may result in tolerance in affected areas. In this work, we tested whether 33 chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of ammonium (10 mg/L), one of the most 34 frequent agrochemicals, affects differently hatching success, survivorship, morphology and 35 swimming performance of Pelophylax perezi tadpoles from agrosystem and pine grove habitats. 36 Ammonium diminished survivorship at the earliest stages after hatching. Thus, lower density 37 was a by-product of exposure to ammonium. Higher density slowed down development, 38 reduced snout-vent length, and had a sharper negative effect on body mass and tail length and 39 depth of ammonium treated individuals with respect to the control. In turn, ammonium 40 accelerated development and increased body mass, SVL, and tail length and depth. These effects 41 did not depend on provenance habitat. However, only pine grove tadpoles\u2019 swimming speed 42 was negatively affected by ammonium, which supports the hypothesis that agrosystem tadpoles 43 are more tolerant to ammonium. Finally, corroborating previous findings, tadpoles with larger 44 bodies and tails were faster swimmers, whereas proportionally more massive individuals were 45 slower, and tail depth was unrelated to swimming speed. 46 47 Keywords: Pelophylax perezi; global decline; pollutant; nitrogenous compound; locomotor 48 performance. 49 50 51 52\nIntroduction 53 Ecosystems worldwide are undergoing a rapid global change whose fundamental causes can be 54 found in human exploitation of the environment (MEA, 2005; IPCC, 2014; Sage, 2020). These 55 activities are predicted to escalate, thus accelerating the pace of global change triggers (Pereira 56 et al., 2010). Among others, an increase is expected in emissions of greenhouse effect gases and 57 the concomitant climate change, biological invasions, modifications of land use inducing habitat 58 fragmentation and loss, and deposition of nitrogen (Sala et al., 2000). However, not all habitats 59 are equally susceptible to these alterations, as areas under greater human pressure are 60 especially vulnerable (Geldmann et al., 2014). Such is the case of agrosystems. Albeit diverse in 61 their management and essential characteristics (Waldner et al., 2016), agrosystems represent a 62 source of greenhouse gases (Miller et al., 2006), a reservoir of invasive species (P\u00e1ndi et al., 63 2014), a major shift in land use as well as a cause of habitat fragmentation (Hana\u010dek and 64 Rodr\u00edguez-Labajos, 2018), and a considerable fertilizer nitrogen input (Olivares et al., 2013). 65 Some taxa are more prone to suffering the effects of agrosystem stressors than others 66 (Foden et al., 2008). Among vertebrates, amphibians represent an enormous concern due to the 67 global decline affecting their populations (Collins and Crump, 2009), likely linked to the 68 aforementioned phenomena (Sodhi et al., 2008). As most taxa, amphibian populations are 69 frequently jeopardized by barriers to connectivity (Cushman, 2006) and alien competitors 70 (Shuman-Goodier et al., 2017), pathogens (Pounds et al., 2006) or predators (Falaschi et al., 71 2020). Moreover, as ectotherms, thermal shifts can be detrimental to their physiology (Alford 72 et al., 2007). Also, amphibians are particularly susceptible to contamination due to their semi-73 permeable skins (Beebee and Griffiths, 2005; Egea-Serrano et al., 2012; Slaby et al., 2019). Along 74 with pesticides (Br\u00fchl et al., 2013) and other agrochemicals (Van Meter et al., 2019; Trudeau et 75 al., 2020), nitrogenous compounds derived from fertilizers inflict a major impact on amphibian 76 populations (Marco and Ortiz-Santaliestra, 2009; Baker et al., 2013). 77\nAlthough nitrogenous compounds endanger amphibian health also in terrestrial stages 78 (Marco et al., 2001), the damage is prominent in the larval phases (Bridges et al., 2002; Griffis-79 Kyle, 2007; Daam et al., 2020). Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, which can actively avoid 80 contaminated soils (Marco et al., 2001), amphibian larvae cannot escape from the waterbodies 81 they inhabit, and thus from pollution. Accordingly, evidence has been found that nitrogenous 82 compounds can directly impair tadpole growth and development (Smith et al., 2005; Ortiz-83 Santaliestra et al., 2012; Ilha and Schiesari, 2014), alter activity levels (Egea-Serrano et al., 2011), 84 and lead to reduced survivorship (Egea-Serrano et al., 2009; Garc\u00eda-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011a). Plus, 85 the morphological alterations provoked by these substances could hinder locomotion, given the 86 impact of morphology on locomotor performance (Dayton et al., 2005; Arendt, 2010; Johnson 87 et al., 2015). Remarkably, impaired antipredator behavior is a well-documented negative 88 secondary effect of nitrogenous compounds on larval amphibians (Ortiz-Santaliestra et al., 89 2010a; Sievers et al., 2018), which could indirectly mediate reduced survivorship (Burgett et al., 90 2007; Ilha and Schiesari, 2014). Moreover, the severity of these effects can be exacerbated by 91 other concomitant stressors, such as hypoxia (Ortiz-Santaliestra and Marco, 2015). 92 That said, some species do thrive in agricultural ponds (Knutson et al., 2004). This is 93 because enormous inter-specific variation exists among amphibians in susceptibility to 94 nitrogenous compounds (Ortiz et al., 2004; Ortiz-Santaliestra et al., 2006; Griffis-Kyle and 95 Ritchie, 2007; Garc\u00eda-Mu\u00f1oz, 2011b; Daam et al., 2020). In addition, nitrogenous compounds 96 can be understood as selective forces capable of driving the development of tolerance (Miaud 97 and Meril\u00e4, 2001). Accordingly, geographical divergence in tolerance to nitrogenous compounds 98 has been detected even at the intraspecific level (Shinn et al., 2008), oftentimes as a possible 99 consequence of the differential selective pressures imposed by disparate degrees of exposure 100 (Egea-Serrano et al., 2009; Karaoglu et al., 2010). On the other hand, these compounds are 101 fertilizers capable of increasing primary production, which can benefit herbivores such as anuran 102 tadpoles (Beebee, 1987; Boone et al., 2007). Increased food availability could even offset the 103\nnegative effects of nitrogenous compounds, often leading to confusing and contradictory results 104 between laboratory experiments, where food availability is controlled, and semi-natural 105 approaches, where it is increased by fertilizers (Egea-Serrano and Tejedo, 2014). 106 Moreover, the effects observed vary according to the nitrogenous compound or the 107 combination of them in question, typically increasing with their concentration (Egea-Serrano et 108 al., 2009; Egea-Serrano et al., 2011; Egea-Serrano and Tejedo, 2014; Daam et al., 2020). Among 109 these compounds, ammonium may pose an especially relevant environmental problem in 110 agrosystems, where it is often particularly common among nitrogenous compounds (Olivares et 111 al., 2013). Ammonium is frequently the dominant nitrogenous compound even in nearby water 112 bodies, following fertilizer leaching (Amano et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2021). Although not without 113 exceptions (Daam et al., 2020), ammonium often exerts the greatest effects among nitrogenous 114 compounds on traits such as survival, food consumption and growth rate of amphibian larvae 115 (Egea-Serrano et al., 2009; Ilha and Schiesari, 2014; Bellezi et al., 2015; Garriga et al., 2017). 116 Indeed, Rana sylvatica tadpoles exposed to nitrate and nitrite do not experience increased 117 mortality (Smith, 2007), whereas those affected by ammonium do (Burgett et al., 2007). 118 Similarly, ammonium has greater effects than nitrite and nitrate on some aspects of the ecology 119 of Pelophylax perezi tadpoles, such as increased activity and food consumption rates, which 120 however results in smaller body size and greater mortality (Egea-Serrano et al., 2009; Egea-121 Serrano et al., 2011). 122 Since agrosystem pollutants may represent a strong selective factor for anurans, our 123 main hypothesis is that anuran populations living in agrosystems might have evolved a response 124 to pollutants as ammonium. In this work, we compare the effects of chronic exposure to 125 ammonium on survivorship, morphology and locomotor performance of pre-metamorphic 126 stages of Pelophylax perezi from agrosystems and natural environments. So far, most research 127 has focused on exposure over a limited time window (Smith et al., 2005; Egea-Serrano et al., 128 2009; Orom\u00ed et al., 2009; Egea-Serrano et al., 2011; Garc\u00eda-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2011a; Ortiz-129\nSantaliestra et al., 2012; Egea-Serrano and Tejedo, 2014; Bellezi et al., 2015; Garriga et al., 2017). 130 However, sensitivity to nitrogenous compounds is known to vary throughout the larval stage of 131 amphibians (Ortiz-Santaliestra et al., 2006; Bellezi et al., 2015; Naamane et al., 2020). Therefore, 132 our experiment is framed in a wider context by assessing the effects of uninterrupted exposure 133 from an early point after oviposition. Based on the above-mentioned rationales, we predict that 134 exposure to ammonium will result in increased mortality and reduced body size and locomotor 135 performance. However, we expect these effects to be greater in tadpoles from natural habitats 136 than in those from agrosystems. 137 138 Material and Methods 139 Study species 140 The Iberian green frog (P. perezi) is a medium-sized ranid that occurs naturally throughout the 141 Iberian Peninsula and southern France. This euryoicous species can be found in a wide variety 142 of habitats, but always in or next to waterbodies. Besides that, its ecological requirements are 143 low, and it can be found in pristine fresh-water habitats, but also in brackish or even polluted 144 waters. For this reason, it often abounds in human-altered habitats, such as urban or agricultural 145 environments. In the spring, these frogs lay egg masses of variable size, from 30-40 eggs to 146 several thousands (Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds et al., 2004), in the waterbodies they inhabit, where the larval 147 stage takes up to three months, exceptionally more. Larvae eat algae as well as plant and animal 148 matter in decomposition. In turn, larvae are often preyed on by aquatic invertebrates such as 149 crayfish, diving beetles, dragonfly naiads, as well as water snakes, turtles and birds (Egea-150 Serrano, 2014). 151 152 Study area and experimental design 153 Fieldwork was conducted in Pinares de Cartaya pine grove and surrounding agrosystems (SW 154 Spain, 37\u00ba20\u2019 N, 7\u00ba09\u2019 W). Pinares de Cartaya is an 11,000-ha Pinus pinea grove with an 155\nundergrowth dominated by Cistus ladanifer, Pistacia lentiscus and Rosmarinus officinalis. 156 Although the autochthonous or anthropic origin of this formation in the area is controversial, it 157 is known to be the dominant plant community for at least the last 4,000 years, so it is considered 158 a natural landscape (Mart\u00ednez and Montero, 2004). Agrosystems consist of a traditional 159 extensive vegetable crop area that has transitioned along the last decades into intensive 160 strawberry, raspberry, and orange plantations, among others. Fertilizers are regularly added in 161 these agrosystems at owners\u2019 discretion. These areas lay around 6 km away from each other. 162 This distance guarantees little climatic or elevational differences introducing divergent selective 163 pressures between both populations. However, frogs are unlikely to shift from one site to the 164 other, as this species rarely ventures away from the water bodies they inhabit (Egea-Serrano, 165 2014), and its dispersal averages barely 49 m, only exceptionally surpassing 250 m (S\u00e1nchez-166 Montes and Mart\u00ednez-Solano, 2011). 167 In April 2018, 10 adults of each sex were manually caught from each selected habitat, as 168 they were basking next to water bodies. We recognized males thanks to the greyish nuptial pads 169 in their forelimbs and the vocal sacs in their mouth commissures, which appear as dark spots 170 when not in use (Egea-Serrano, 2014). Frogs were pooled separately according to their 171 provenance habitat in two adjacent outdoor semi-natural enclosures. Each enclosure was 6 x 6 172 m long and 2 m high: a 1-meter-high brick wall from the ground, plus a 1-meter-high, 5-mm-size 173 steel mesh. The roof was covered with the same type of mesh. Therefore, frogs could not escape 174 the enclosures, nor could predators enter them. Moreover, each enclosure had an 11-m2, 50-175 cm deep pond where frogs could reproduce (see Supplementary Material in Zambrano-176 Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2020). We daily checked for the presence of egg masses in the ponds, and 177 transferred them to the laboratory within 12 hours after they had been laid. After oviposition, 178 frogs were released at their provenance spots as soon as possible. 179 In total, we gathered 30 egg mases laid by agrosystem parents plus 30 egg masses laid 180 by pine grove parents. In the laboratory, we immediately collected groups of 15 random eggs 181\nfrom each egg mass. To that end, each egg mass was spread in a tray, and eggs from different 182 parts of the tray were picked following no particular order. Then, each group was housed in a 183\nreplicate, a plastic aquarium (19  38  27 cm) containing 6 L of natural untreated water, thus 184 totaling 60 aquaria and 900 eggs. In half of the aquaria with eggs from each habitat, randomly 185 selected (we allotted every other aquarium to each treatment, following the order in which they 186 were set), we added approximately 178.87 mg of 99.7% pure NH4Cl, so that the concentration 187 of ammonium (NH4+) was 10 mg NH4+/L. A concentration of 13.5 mg NH4+/L triggers around 70% 188 mortality rate according to a 21-day experiment on P. perezi larvae from natural habitats (Egea-189 Serrano et al., 2009). Thus, we chose a concentration slightly lower to trigger sublethal effects, 190 while avoiding excessive mortality rates. This concentration falls within environmentally 191 relevant ranges (Egea-Serrano and Tejedo, 2014; Garriga et al., 2017). The remnant aquaria 192 conformed the control group, which contained untreated water. 193 We kept these replicates on laboratory shelves. Water of all aquaria was completely 194 replaced twice a week. The treatments with or without ammonium, and the amount of 195 ammonium added in the experimental group, were in all cases maintained in the conditions 196 described. Each time, we randomly changed the position of all replicates within the shelves, to 197 prevent potential slight differences in light or temperature conditions from affecting tadpoles. 198 A window let natural daylight in, permitting adjustment of circadian rhythms. All tadpoles were 199 fed boiled spinach ad libitum, as we daily ensured that they had food at their disposal. Once a 200 week, starting the day when the animals hatched, we counted the number of surviving tadpoles 201 in each replicate. Dead individuals were identified not only based on their lack of motility, but 202 also on post-mortem changes in coloration and external morphology. This way, we also 203 accounted for density, interpreted here as the number of individuals in 6 L of water. 204 Five weeks after hatching, before the earliest individuals started to approach the end of 205 the larval stage, we recorded one video of each tadpole with a camera (Canon EOS 550D) at 25 206 frames/s. Videos were recorded from a zenithal perspective. In these videos, tadpoles were 207\nindividually placed in a 20  35  5cm white plastic tray filled with untreated natural water up 208 to 4 cm high. During video recordings, water temperature inside the experimental tray was 209 about 18\u00b0C. As performance of anuran tadpoles is highly dependent on temperature (Perotti et 210 al., 2018), we attempted to keep all trials at the same temperature. Inside this tray, covering it 211 except for a 1-cm gap at each side, we placed a transparent plastic tray 3 cm above the floor of 212 the former. This way, we prevented water undulations due to tadpole swimming or researcher 213 stimulations (see below) from distorting the footage. Tadpoles were gently stimulated to swim 214 by stirring a wood stick in their proximities through the gaps between both trays. Each individual 215 swam at least three times before recordings were stopped. Illumination was controlled by 216 placing a 60 W white-light bulb 250 cm above the tray, which is enough distance to prevent 217 differences in lighting conditions from occurring and affecting tadpole behavior (Ding et al., 218 2014). A ruler was included in each video to calibrate distance. Maximum swimming speed was 219 then extracted from these videos using the software Tracker v.5.1.5, tracking the variations in 220 tadpole position between each pair of consecutive frames, therefore calculating the distance 221 covered in the time elapsed between them. We considered maximum swimming speed as the 222 fastest speed attained between two consecutive frames. 223 Following video recordings, we weighed tadpoles to the nearest 0.01 g with a digital 224 scale (CDS-100), after gently removing excess water with a dry piece of disposable absorbing 225 paper. Afterward, we took a lateral photo of each larva with the same camera previously 226 described. Each photo included a piece of graph paper, which we used to calibrate distance in 227 the software ImageJ v1.8.0. We then obtained tadpole snout-vent length (hereafter, SVL), tail 228 length and tail depth. Moreover, we recorded the Gosner stage (Gosner, 1960) at which each 229 tadpole was at the time. As this was a long-term study, tadpoles were kept alive for other 230 purposes after these measurements. 231\nMaking use of data on body mass and SVL, we calculated the scaled mass index 232 (hereafter, SMI), according to Peig and Green (2009). This body condition index results from 233 applying the formula: 234\nSMI = \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 [ \ud835\udc3f0 \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 ] \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34 235\nin which Wi represents body mass and Li represents SVL of a given individual, L0 is the average 236 SVL of the sample, which functions here as a standardized value to which each individual value 237 is compared, and \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc34 is the slope of a standardized major axis regression, which we calculated 238 as the quotient between the slope from the ordinary least squares regression of body mass on 239 SVL (after ln-transforming both) and the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, r (Peig and Green, 240 2009). 241 242 Statistical analyses 243 Firstly, we conducted a mixed model with the number of weekly survivors (starting from and 244 including hatchings) in each replicate as a response variable; treatment (presence or absence of 245 ammonium), habitat (pine grove and agrosystem), week (hatching day plus 5 weeks) and their 246 interaction as fixed factors; and replicate as a random factor. Significant interactions were 247 assessed with Tukey post-hoc tests. 248 Then, we performed separate mixed models with each morphometric variable of larvae 249 (SVL, tail length, tail depth, body mass, SMI, and Gosner stage) as a response variable; habitat, 250 treatment, density (number of individuals in the replicate) and their double and triple 251 interactions as fixed factors; and replicate as a random factor. 252 Larva swimming speed was analyzed with a mixed model where habitat, treatment, 253 density and their interactions were fixed factors, and replicate was a random factor. Moreover, 254 we implemented a series of separate mixed models in which we added either SVL, tail length, 255\ntail depth, body mass, or SMI as covariates to assess any potential effect of morphology on 256 swimming speed. Models including tail length and tail depth were also controlled for SVL. 257 In all cases, backward stepwise selection was applied. The initial full models, with all two 258 and three-way interactions, are presented in the Supplementary Material section. These tests 259 were conducted by implementing the package \u201cnlme\u201d (Pinheiro et al., 2012) in the software R 260 (R Development Core Team, 2012). Before performing parametric statistics, the assumptions of 261 homoscedasticity and residual normality were checked (Quinn and Keough, 2002). Whenever 262 data transformations failed to amend heteroscedasticity, we implemented the function 263 \u201cvarIdent\u201d (Zuur et al., 2009). 264 265 Results 266 Survivorship 267 Only the interaction treatment*week was significant in the full model (Table S1 in 268 Supplementary Material). In the final model, the effects of habitat (\u03a721, 336 = 0.115; P = 0.735; Fig. 269 1) and treatment (\u03a721, 336 = 0.003; P = 0.957; Fig. 1) were non-significant, whereas those of week 270 (\u03a721, 336 = 99.404; P < 0.001; Fig. 1) and the treatment*week interaction were significant (\u03a721, 336 271 = 46.825; P < 0.001; Fig. 1). Survivorship tended to decrease in time, but was always greater in 272 the control than in the ammonium group (Fig. 1; see Tukey post-hoc tests in Table S2 in 273 Supplementary Material). 274 275 Morphology 276 In no case did we detect any significant interaction in any full model involving morphological 277 variables (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Therefore, presented here are the models after 278 stepwise backwards selection. 279 In the final mixed model with SVL as the response variable, tadpoles from the pine grove 280 had significantly greater SVL than those from the agrosystem, regardless of the treatment (fixed 281\nmain habitat effect: \u03a721, 656 = 4.106; P = 0.043; Fig. 2a). In addition, SVL was significantly greater 282 in the treated group than in the control group regardless of the habitat (fixed main treatment 283 effect: \u03a721, 656 = 6.965; P = 0.008; Fig. 2a). Also, there was a significant and negative relationship 284 between SVL and the covariable density regardless of the habitat and treatment (fixed main 285 effect of density: \u03a721, 656 = 38.951; \u03b2 = -0.186; P < 0.001). 286 In the final model with tail length as the response variable, the effects of neither habitat 287 (\u03a721, 654 = 1.749; P = 0.186; Fig. 2b) nor the covariable density (\u03a721, 654 = 0.003; \u03b2 = 0.004; P = 0.955) 288 were significant, whereas larvae under the ammonium treatment had longer tails than those in 289 the control treatment (\u03a721, 654 = 5.695; P = 0.017; Fig. 2b) and the interaction treatment*density 290 was significant (\u03a721, 654 = 4.378; P = 0.036). When the correlation between tail length and density 291 was independently analyzed for each treatment, we detected a negative, significant relationship 292 in both cases, but the slope was more pronounced in the ammonium (r = -0.380; P < 0.001; Fig. 293 S1a in Supplementary Material) than in the control group (r = -0.165; P = 0.001; Fig. S1 a in 294 Supplementary Material). The effect of SVL was positive and significant (\u03a721, 654 = 885.306; \u03b2 = 295 1.492; P < 0.001). 296 In the final mixed model with tail depth as the response variable, tadpoles from 297 agrosystem had significantly greater tail depth than those from pine grove regardless of the 298 treatment (fixed main habitat effect: \u03a721, 654 = 5.622; P = 0.018; Fig. 2c). In addition, tail depth 299 was significantly greater in the treated group than in the control group, regardless of the habitat 300 (fixed main treatment effect: \u03a721, 654 = 6.417; P = 0.011; Fig. 2c). The main effect of the covariable 301 density was marginally non-significant (\u03a721, 654 = 2.844; \u03b2 = 0.047; P = 0.092). However, the 302 interaction treatment*density was significant (\u03a721, 654 = 6.281; P = 0.012). When the correlation 303 between tail depth and density was independently analyzed for each treatment, we detected a 304 negative, significant relationship in the ammonium group (r = -0.270; P < 0.001; Fig. S1b in 305 Supplementary Material), and a negative, marginally non-significant relationship in the control 306\ngroup (r = -0.093; P = 0.066; Fig. S1b in Supplementary Material). The effect of SVL was positive 307 and significant (\u03a721, 654 = 623.293; \u03b2 = 0.496; P < 0.001). 308 In the final model with body mass as the response variable, pine grove tadpoles had a 309 marginally non-significant tendency to be heavier than agrosystem tadpoles, regardless of 310 treatment (\u03a721, 655 = 2.925; P = 0.087; Fig. 2d). Also, tadpoles exposed to ammonium were heavier 311 than those from the control group (\u03a721, 655 = 15.616; P < 0.001; Fig. 2d). The main effect of the 312 covariable density was negative and significant (\u03a721, 655 = 7.312; \u03b2 = -0.015; P = 0.007). The 313 interaction treatment*density was significant (\u03a721, 655 = 11.679; P = 0.001). When the correlation 314 between body mass and density was independently analyzed for each treatment, we detected 315 a negative, significant relationship in both cases, but the slope was more pronounced in the 316 ammonium (r = -0.450; P < 0.001; Fig. S1c in Supplementary Material) than in the control group 317 (r = -0.179; P = 0.001; Fig. S1c in Supplementary Material). 318 In the final model with SMI as the response variable, neither the effect of habitat (\u03a721, 319 656 = 0.181; P = 0.671), treatment (\u03a721, 656 = 0.200; P = 0.655), nor the covariable density (\u03a721, 656 = 320 0.052; \u03b2 < 0.001; P = 0.819) were significant. 321 In the final model with Gosner stage as the response variable, the effect of habitat was 322 non-significant (\u03a721, 656 = 1.039; P = 0.308; Fig. 3), whereas tadpoles exposed to ammonium were 323 in a more advanced Gosner stage than the control individuals (\u03a721, 656 = 8.196; P = 0.004; Fig. 3), 324 and the covariable density had a negative, significant main effect (\u03a721, 656 = 5.846; \u03b2 = -0.176; P = 325 0.016). 326 327 Swimming speed 328 No interaction was significant in the full model (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). According 329 to the final model, pine grove tadpoles swam faster (\u03a721, 655 = 4.317; P = 0.038; Fig. 4), whereas 330 the effects of treatment (\u03a721, 655 = 0.045; P = 0.832; Fig. 4) and density (\u03a721, 655 = 0.383; \u03b2 = -0.135; 331 P = 0.536) as main effects were non-significant. The interaction habitat*treatment was 332\nmarginally non-significant, with a negative effect of ammonium only in pine grove tadpoles (\u03a721, 333 655 = 3.275; P = 0.070; Fig. 4). 334 According to models incorporating morphometric variables, SVL (\u03a721, 651 = 24.955; \u03b2 = 335 1.341; P < 0.001), tail length (\u03a721, 650 = 37.886; \u03b2 = 1.183; P < 0.001), and body mass (\u03a721, 651 = 336 15.745; \u03b2 = 10.152; P < 0.001) had positive effects on swimming speed, whereas that of SMI was 337 negative (\u03a721, 651 = 63.993; \u03b2 = -45.289; P < 0.001), and that of tail depth was non-significant (\u03a721, 338 651 = 1.522; \u03b2 = 0.649; P = 0.217). Full models are presented as Supplementary Material (Table 339 S4). 340 341 Discussion 342 These results confirmed some of the predicted effects of ammonium on the traits measured, 343 but not others. In no case did ammonium affect hatching success. This finding is aligned with 344 previous evidence that it is only in synergy with other stressors, such as osmotic imbalance, that 345 ammonium nitrate increases mortality in P. perezi embryos (Ortiz-Santaliestra et al., 2010b). By 346 contrast, R. sylvatica embryos do experience reduced survivorship in ponds fertilized with 347 ammonium nitrate (Griffis-Kyle and Ritchie, 2007). After hatching, we found that early tadpole 348 survivorship was indeed drastically reduced by ammonium: after the first week from hatching, 349 the number of survivors was always greater in the control than in the ammonium replicates, 350 irrespective of the habitat of origin. This could be a consequence of the loss of the protective 351 egg coat after hatching increasing exposure to ammonium, although that coat has proven 352 inefficient against pollutants in this (Ortiz-Santaliestra et al., 2010b) and other amphibians 353 (Greulich and Pflugmacher, 2003; Marquis et al., 2006). Remarkably, ammonium reduced 354 survivorship only during the first week of these tadpoles\u2019 lives, after which it remained stabilized. 355 Early survivorship of R. sylvatica tadpoles exposed to ammonium nitrate is also compromised 356 (Griffis-Kyle and Ritchie, 2007), whereas ammonium nitrate reduces survivorship of R. 357 temporaria tadpoles also in later stages (de Wijer et al., 2003). Egea-Serrano et al. (2009) 358\ndetected that a concentration of ammonium of 13.5mg/L, slightly greater than the one we used, 359 also increased mortality rates of P. perezi larvae in later stages, although survivorship in that 360 case was greater in individuals from polluted than from natural habitats. Interestingly, the fact 361 that ammonium hinders survivorship in a differentially sharper fashion in early than in late larval 362 stages may have populational consequences. In this sense, a study on the effects of mercury on 363 Anaxyrus americanus tadpoles proved that decreases in early-stage survival do not have major 364 implications on population viability, as opposed to reductions in late-stage survival (Willson et 365 al., 2012). Accordingly, P. perezi is a common sight in agrosystems (Clavero et al., 2015; Carpio 366 et al., 2016), despite these results. 367 Most interestingly, disparate survivorship provoked clear differences in density between 368 treatments, with control replicates being more densely populated than the experimental ones. 369 Therefore, reduced density may work as an indirect effect of ammonium, which, in turn, has 370 direct effects on tadpole morphology. Specifically, increasing density resulted in reduced body 371 size, including SVL, tail length and depth, as well as body mass. These results largely corroborate 372 reduced growth at higher densities of Scaphiopus holbrooki (Semlitsch and Caldwell, 1982), 373 Litoria spenceri (Gillespie, 2002), and Litoria aurea tadpoles (Browne et al., 2003), likely 374 propelled by competition for resources (Alford, 1999). Moreover, we detected that ammonium 375 exacerbates some of these negative effects of density. This finding contrasts with those on other 376 agrochemicals, such as the insecticide carbaryl, which does not interact with tadpole density 377 (Distel and Boone, 2011). Finally, density had a negative relationship with Gosner stage, which 378 coincides with former findings that development is faster at lower densities in various anuran 379 tadpoles (Semlitsch and Caldwell, 1982; Gillespie, 2002; Browne et al., 2003). 380 But even accounting for these consequences of density, ammonium inflicted direct 381 effects on some, but not all, traits of tadpole morphology. Concretely, tadpoles reared with 382 ammonium reached greater values of SVL. Contrastingly, the fact that SMI did not differ 383 between treatments suggests that these morphological dissimilarities were simply proportional, 384\nbut did not affect tadpoles\u2019 capability of storing resources. Similarly, chronic exposures to 385 ammonium nitrate produce larger Lithobates clamitans tadpoles (Smith et al., 2013). These 386 findings are in stark contrast with previous studies on P. perezi tadpoles where body mass was 387 reduced after a 21-day exposure to higher concentrations of ammonium (13.5 mg/L) as 388 compared with lower concentrations (1.35 mg/L) (Egea-Serrano et al., 2009). Likewise, larvae of 389 Alytes obstetricans toads under acute exposure to ammonium experience a slower growth rate 390 (Garriga et al., 2017). In the light of our findings, the effects of an acute versus a chronic exposure 391 to ammonium might interact differently with density, and hence may exert opposed 392 consequences on tadpole body size. Indeed, acute and chronic exposure to ammonium nitrate 393 resulted in the same body mass pattern described above (Hecnar, 1995). 394 Tadpoles in the ammonium treatment were at a more advanced Gosner stage, which is 395 the consequence of a faster development. This finding is aligned with those that developmental 396 time is shorter in Bufo bufo tadpoles exposed to ammonium nitrate (Xu and Oldham, 1997). 397 Accelerated development under stressful conditions could be beneficial, as it allows tadpoles an 398 earlier escape. As such, the negative effects of the herbicide atrazine on larval Ambystoma 399 barbouri salamanders are reduced when higher temperatures shorten development, and thus 400 exposure time (Rohr et al., 2011). Indeed, other stressors such as food deprivation (Doughty and 401 Roberts, 2003), desiccation (Loman, 1999; Lent and Babbitt, 2020), or infections (Warne et al., 402 2011) can as well trigger a faster development. Nonetheless, the physiological pathways 403 responsible for such acceleration are complex (Warne et al., 2011). Some stressors, such as salt 404 (Chinathamby et al., 2006) or heavy metals (Lefcort et al., 1998), may even cause delayed 405 metamorphosis, probably because they function as physiological disruptors of the aforesaid 406 pathways. Ammonium perchlorate inhibits metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis tadpoles (Goleman 407 et al., 2002a), which is a likely consequence of altered thyroid function (Goleman et al., 2002b). 408 Plus, although we did not detect interactive effects of density and treatment on the 409 developmental stage, other studies report that high densities hinder the ability of tadpoles to 410\nrespond to desiccating ponds with a faster development (Brady and Griffiths, 2000; Loman, 411 2002). 412 However, none of these effects of ammonium interacted with habitat, which does not 413 support the hypothesis that agrosystem tadpoles would be more tolerant to this stressor. 414 Nonetheless, this hypothesis was indeed supported with regards to swimming speed, which was 415 negatively affected by ammonium only in pine grove tadpoles. Several studies on anuran 416 tadpoles have proven that faster swimmers have greater chances of surviving predation 417 attempts by dragonfly nymphs (Chovanec, 1992), snakes (Watkins, 1996), turtles (Feder, 1983), 418 fish (Teplitsky et al., 2005), and other tadpoles (Arendt, 2009). Predation pressure could indeed 419 represent a stronger selection force than the aforementioned morphological effects of 420 ammonium, and could arguably play a role in shaping these habitat differences in the effect of 421 ammonium on swimming speed. In agrosystems, bound to contamination by ammonium, 422 predators could eliminate those tadpoles whose swimming speed is reduced after exposure to 423 ammonium, hence selecting for tadpoles that are tolerant to ammonium. Such an effect is 424 unlikely in pine groves, where exposure to ammonium is less likely to happen, and so are, thus, 425 adaptations to overcome its potential effects. In sharp contrast with our results, Egea-Serrano 426 and Tejedo (2014) detected no effect of an acute exposure to ammonium on swimming 427 performance of P. perezi tadpoles from either contaminated or pristine habitats. However, other 428 agrochemicals, such as the pesticides imidacloprid (Sievers et al., 2018), endosulfan (Deno\u00ebl et 429 al., 2013) and carbaryl (Bridges, 1997), as well as the herbicide diuron (Moreira et al., 2019), do 430 impair locomotion of other tadpoles. So do other chemical stressors: aluminum (Jung and Jagoe, 431 1995), copper (Sievers et al., 2018), and even microplastics (Ara\u00fajo and Malafaia, 2020), reduce 432 tadpole swimming speed. Surprisingly, Hyla versicolor tadpoles exposed to herbicides are faster 433 swimmers (Katzenberger et al., 2014). 434 Finally, we found that swimming speed increased with SVL and body mass, which 435 confirms previous findings that tadpoles with greater body sizes swim faster (Wilson and 436\nFranklin, 2000; Johnson et al., 2015). However, we detected a negative effect of SMI on 437 swimming speed, which indicates that proportionally more massive individuals were impaired 438 swimmers, a likely consequence of the burden that excess body mass commonly represents to 439 locomotor performance in other taxa (Zamora-Camacho et al., 2014) or even in the post-440 metamorphic stages of this study species (Moreno-Rueda et al., 2020). Plus, tail length had a 441 positive effect on swimming speed. Longer tails are known to facilitate faster swimming speed 442 in other tadpole species (Arendt, 2010; Johnson et al., 2015). On the other hand, we detected 443 no effect of tail depth on swimming speed. Deeper tails do not improve swimming speed in Hyla 444 versicolor tadpoles either (Van Buskirk and McCollum, 2000). However, this seems to be a 445 species-specific relationship, since tail depth does improve swimming performance in other 446 species (Dayton et al., 2005; Arendt, 2010). 447 To conclude, ammonium diminished survivorship at the earliest stages after hatching. 448 Therefore, tadpoles exposed to ammonium were raised at lower densities. A greater density 449 involved slowed down development, reduced SVL, and had a markedly more negative effect on 450 tail length and depth, and body mass of the treated than the control group. Even when effects 451 of density were statistically controlled for, ammonium directly accelerated development and 452 increased SVL, tail length and depth, and body mass. These effects did not depend on 453 provenance habitat, which does not support the hypothesis that agrosystem tadpoles would be 454 more tolerant to ammonium. However, the effect of ammonium on swimming speed did 455 interact with habitat: only pine grove tadpoles were negatively affected by ammonium. This 456 finding suggests that predation pressure may shape this geographical pattern, as slower 457 tadpoles are more likely to be preyed on. Finally, corroborating previous findings, tadpoles with 458 larger bodies and tails were faster swimmers, whereas proportionally more massive individuals 459 were slower, and tail depth was unrelated to swimming speed. However, further research is 460 required to overcome the limitations of this investigation, for example by analyzing the potential 461 effects of other pollutants, or including a wider geographical area. 462\nAcknowledgements 463 Frog capture and management was conducted according to a research permit issued to the 464 authors by the Consejer\u00eda de Medio Ambiente of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda (reference 465 SGMN/AWG/MGD/MGM GB-270-18) and the Bioethics Committee of the Spanish National 466 Research Council (reference 720/2018).
