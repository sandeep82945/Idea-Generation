    "abstractText": "The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the three contexts of Computerized Accounting Information System (technological, organizational, and environmental) on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. To achieve this aim, a survey was conducted on 208 construction companies that adopted CAIS with 152 valid responses received, representing a 73% rate of useable responses. The data analysis was carried out adopting the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results indicate that the technological and organizational context of CAIS had a positive significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance while the environmental context had a negative significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. This research\u2019s findings are significant to the practice of adopting CAIS technology on construction projects in developing countries since it provides the likely effect of the various contexts of CAIS on the economic performance of construction companies which will be beneficial for planning and decision-making to the construction companies\u2019 management. Theoretically, the findings of this study will enrich existing literature by providing empirical proof of the variable effect of the various CAIS contexts on construction companies\u2019 economic performance in Iraq which has not been considered in the existing literature. This study is limited to construction companies in Iraq.",

To achieve this aim, a survey was conducted on 208 construction companies that adopted CAIS with 152 valid responses received, representing a 73% rate of useable responses. The data analysis was carried out adopting the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results indicate that the technological and organizational context of CAIS had a positive significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance while the environmental context had a negative significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. This research\u2019s findings are significant to the practice of adopting CAIS technology on construction projects in developing countries since it provides the likely effect of the various contexts of CAIS on the economic performance of construction companies which will be beneficial for planning and decision-making to the construction companies\u2019 management. Theoretically, the findings of this study will enrich existing literature by providing empirical proof of the variable effect of the various CAIS contexts on construction companies\u2019 economic performance in Iraq which has not been considered in the existing literature.

The construction sector accounts for a large portion of the economy in emerging economies such as Iraq. Regardless of its economic importance, the construction industry\u2019s productivity is consistently lower than other industries like the manufacturing and oil sectors. The Iraqi economy has had an extraordinary increase in its gross domestic product (GDP) over the last three decades, as evidenced by Breghish and Ali [1]. The construction industry, on the other hand, has completed spectacular projects that were not time, cost, or quality effective [2, 3]. Furthermore, the construction industry has a bad reputation for poor performance and productivity [4, 5]. This gives rise to the need for computerization as a means of solving such issues. The primary purpose of adopting a Computerized Accounting Information System (CAIS) is the need for greater economic performance [6]. Basically, CAIS has three adoption contexts which include, technological context, organizational context, and environmental context [2]. Therefore, CAIS has become the major driver for construction companies\u2019 economic performance [7]."

As a result, understanding CAIS is a strategic asset to an organization which could serve as a tool for economic performance in particular and overall company performance [8]. Additionally, CAIS has developed into a strategic philosophy that aids businesses in developing strategic competencies in dealing with the increased dynamism and unpredictability of the business climate. Researchers and practitioners agree that computerization is critical to improving and preserving a construction company\u2019s performance [9, 10]. Several academics believe that computerization is an company's most valuable and vital resource [11]. In contrast, others believe that computerization is crucial to an organization\u2019s existence [12]. CAIS has been a primary strategy for many organizations looking to enhance their organizational performance [13- 15]. Generally, CAIS adoption is currently recognized as\n14 Informatica 46 (2022) 13\u201324 H.N.H. Al-Hashimy\na criterion for construction company\u2019s performance, and the CAIS strategy is being adopted by a rising number of organizations [16-18]. In addition, Gaikwad and Sunnapwar [19] showed that many organizations that implemented CAIS factors as a corporate strategy have failed to meet their aspirations and are getting disenchanted with CAIS\u2019s usefulness. The emphasis of early CAIS studies was on technology as a fundamental key to information flow [20]. In addition, construction industry stakeholders have made significant investments in information technology to guarantee the success of CAIS initiatives, but has failed to yield the expected results [21]. Apart from that, Kong, et al. [22] argued that, although beneficial in certain aspects, CAIS initiatives have not always resulted in better services and products, superior work processes, or more effective personnel. For example, there have been examples of a vast volume of paperwork, delayed data processing, and, as a result, delays in the generation of management accounts [23], which has had some impact on economic performance. This gives the basis for conducting this study to ascertain how Iraqi construction companies have fared economically while adopting CAIS. Also, given that the level of CAIS adoption in construction companies in Iraq is still at its early stages [24], it is critical to figure out which CAIS adoption elements/contexts have a major impact on the economic performance of Iraqi construction firms. The concept of computerization as a value to construction companies has recently garnered widespread recognition and interest. CAIS is becoming more and more vital in the construction industry, as appropriate computerization of a company\u2019s processes is critical to its existence [25]. Nevertheless, formal CAIS deployment in Iraq, especially within the construction industry, is still in its early stages [26]. As a result, construction companies must better understand the importance of computerization as a valuable asset in improving their economic performance and incorporating CAIS efforts into their strategic management schedule to achieve their objectives. With some degree of certainty of the economic performance outcome of adopting CAIS, more construction companies who hitherto are reluctant to adopt CAIS will be encouraged to do so. Therefore, the general objective of this study is to determine the nature and type of effect CAIS adoption contexts have on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. This study has a lot of significance. First, the study will be significant to construction companies since it will predict with a great degree of certainty on the likely economic performance outcome of adopting CAIS. This will help them in making informed decision on the adoption of CAIS. Also, the study will be significant to the government of developing countries whose construction industry are at the early stages of adopting CAIS. This study\u2019s findings will enable them to make the required interventions by way of enlightenment and development of the required expertise in construction companies towards adopting CAIS for improved economic productivity."

It comprises of the existing practices and equipment within the company, this is in addition to the collection of existing technologies outside the company [28]. Frank, et al. [28] opined that the choice to adopt technology is contingent on what is available, and also the degree to which the available technology is compatible with the firm\u2019s existing technology. The technological context of an organization is essential in influencing the adoption, and performance of new information technologies and information systems [29]. Some related works in this niche research area have reported findings on the nexus between the technological context of CAIS and companies\u2019 economic performance. For example, Mutie [30] reported a positive relationship between technological context of CAIS and construction companies' economic performance. Additionally, Wang, et al. [17] found that the relationship between CAIS technology context and companies\u2019 economic performance is positive. Similarly, Asian, et al. [31] and Lu, et al. [32] revealed that the higher the technological expertise of a firm regarding CAIS, the higher companies' economic performance. Also, the result obtained by Amusawi, et al. [33] acknowledged the positive relationship between reports preparation decision making and companies' economic performance. For instance, the outcome of a research by Katsaros, et al. [34] showed that there is a positive relation between technology capability and the economic performance of companies\u2019 while adopting new technologies. Organizational technology acceptance model showed that technology culture is an important link between employee skills and economic performance outcomes [35]. In view of the literature reviewed, the following hypothesis is generated: H1: CAIS technological context has a positive significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance."

According to the technology organization and environment framework, organizational adoption of innovative technologies can be affected by the organizational context [37, 38]. For this study, organizational context of CAIS is conceptualized as a\nfirm\u2019s readiness to implement CAIS. Nwagwu [39]\nEvaluating the Impact of Computerized Accounting Information\u2026 Informatica 46 (2022) 13\u201324 15\nreported that apart from the fact that organizations can attain their organizational readiness and financial readiness through organizational culture, it can also increase its organizational readiness and financial readiness by sharing the employees\u2019 computerization inclinations within the organization. Numerous research also indicated that an organization context focused on organizational culture results in positive organizational readiness and financial readiness, leading to economic performance [40]. Apart from financial capability, the ability to judiciously utilize new computerized systems and correctly manage this computerization within a firm has become the major determinant for construction companies\u2019 economic performance [41-43]. Also, the capacity to create and take advantage of the value of a construction companies\u2019 nonphysical resources comprise a fundamental competency for companies, especially those delivering professional services and can lead to greater economic performance [44]. Organizational context represented by financial capability was found to positively influence companies performance [45]. Caseiro and Coelho [46] suggested that capabilities characteristic of the organizational context of CAIS could be a source of construction companies\u2019 economic. Other previous studies obtained similar result while investigating the relationship between organizational context represented by technology capability and companies\u2019 economic performance [47]. In view of the various leanings from the reviewed literature, it is hypothesized as follows: H2: CAIS organizational context has a positive effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance."

External pressure emanates from customer, supplier, government demands, market pressure or variations in the external environment [49]. As Al-Bataineh and Gallagher [50] contended, productivity is the real source of CAIS, and CAIS advantage can result in high performance through improved competitive advantage. Many studies observed that external pressure is topmost among the factors affecting CAIS implementation [51]. One of the external pressures faced by construction companies while adopting CAIS is competitive pressure [52]. It is largely presumed that when competition among companies rises, the possibility of innovation adoption will also increase accordingly [53, 54]. This suggests that the greater the external pressure perceived by construction companies the more the possibility of them considering efficient implementation of CAIS to improve their economic performance, and keep their competitors at bay. The effect of the environmental context could also be in the form of pressure from the government and its agencies to adopt CAIS [52]. The government could provide both\nfinancial and non-financial incentives to aid a seamless adoption of CAIS, which would invariably lead to greater organizational economic performance [55]. Therefore, the third hypothesis of the study is stated as follows: H3: CAIS environmental Context has a significant positive effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. The conceptual model of this study showing the stated hypotheses is presented in Figure 1."

The survey respondents were the managers, CEO or Senior Manager of contracting companies operating in the universities of Southern Iraq. This research focused only on large and medium contracting companies because the literature has revealed that large and medium organizations are more likely to adopt CAIS when compared to smaller construction companies (Faccia et al., 2019) . After identifying the construction companies eligible to participate in the survey, they were contacted via emails and phone calls, describing the aim of the\n16 Informatica 46 (2022) 13\u201324 H.N.H.

These include internal consistency reliability, convergent validity (indicator reliability/outer loading and average variance extracted), and discriminant validity. The results obtained for the reflective measurement model are shown in Table 3.\nThe composite reliability was calculated to ascertain the reliability of the questionnaire items for each construct. The composite reliability values obtained for each of the questionnaire constructs are greater than 0.7, thus confirming the reliability of the questionnaire constructs\n[66]. In measuring the convergent validity for the measurement model, the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) is used [67]. As shown in Table 3, the AVE values for all the study\u2019s constructs are higher than 0.5, thus all the constructs meet the threshold value for convergent validity [67]. Discriminant validity is assessed in the measurement model using the Fornell and Larcker criterion [68]. The results presented in Table 4 suggests that the values are greater than 0.50 with every single item in the primary diagonal and are greater than off-diagonal items in their respective rows and columns, thus satisfying Soundarapandiyan, et al. [69] threshold value for discriminant validity. This shows that discriminant validity is attained since the constructs are markedly unique from one another.\nNote: Diagonals stand for the square root of the AVE while the off-diagonals are representative of the correlations. Table 5 presents a method of determining the discriminant validity analysis by comparing the cross loadings among constructs. Table 5 shows that all the indicators have high loading on their respective constructs but low on other constructs.

            "text": "In structural model evaluation using the PLS-SEM technique, six tests recommended by Hair , et al. [70] need to be carried out. These tests include evaluation of the structural model for collinearity issues, evaluation of the significance and relevance of the structural model relationships, assessment of the level of the coefficient of determination R2, assessment of the effect size (f2), assessment of predictive relevance Q2. In assessing collinearity in the model, the variance inflation factor (VIF) is used (See Table 6). All constructs in the model had VIF values below 3.3, therefore fulfilling Diamantopoulos and Siguaw [71] cut-off value. This indicates the absence of collinearity issues in the model. The R2 value of 0.30 was gotten in this research (see\nFigure 2), signifying that the model substantial predictive accuracy Chin [72]. Furthermore, the predictive relevance Q2 value of 0.311 was obtained which implies that the exogenous constructs have predictive relevance for the endogenous construct (economic performance), since its value is significantly greater than zero [62]. Next is the\ntesting of the study\u2019s hypotheses."

            "text": "This study was designed to evaluate the effect of the technological context, organizational context, and environmental context of CAIS on construction companies\u2019 economic performance. The results gotten showed that the technological context of CAIS had a positive significant effect on EP which supports H1, OC had a positive significant effect on CAIS supporting H2, while the environmental context (EC) had a negative significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance which does not support H3. The significant positive effect of technological context of CAIS on companies\u2019 economic performance (H1) obtained is similar to the findings of Masood and Egger [29] who reported that TC positively influences construction companies\u2019 EP. Also, Mutie [30] and Wang, et al. [17] reported that TC is positively correlated with EP which corroborates the finding of this present study. Additionally, Asian, et al. [31] and Lu, et al. [32] revealed that the higher the technological capability of a firm regarding CAIS, the higher companies' economic performance which confirms this study\u2019s findings. Technological capability which is a part of technological context of CAIS was found by Katsaros, et al. [34] to have a direct positive effect on companies\u2019 economic performance, thus supporting this research\u2019s finding. The possible reason for the significant positive effect of TC on companies\u2019 EP found in this study could be due to the fact that when organizations are vast with respect to adopting other technologies, the adoption of CAIS would be much easier in view of their past experience in technology adoption, thus leading to EP. Additionally, this research's findings indicate that the organizational context of CAIS has a positive significant effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance which supports H2. This finding is similar to that of Atkin and Brooks [41] and Taherdoost and\nBrard [43] who found that aside financial capacity, the ability to judiciously utilize CAIS and efficiently operate it internally within the firm is the most important criteria for construction companies\u2019 economic performance. This study\u2019s findings are also similar to that of Baima, et al. [44] and Tortorella, et al. [47]. The likely reason for the results obtained in this study for H2 could be that the construction companies considered have developed strong capabilities to control and make use of their nonphysical assets which contributes to improved economic performance. Also, the construction companies under consideration in this study have huge financial assets which can enable them to procure the needed expertise in the adoption of CAIS which increases the chances of their CAIS adoption to be more economically viable, hence leading to their economic performance. Another likely reason for the positive significant relationship between OC and EP obtained in this study is the technological capacity of the company prior to adopting CAIS. When the construction company is technologically savvy, adoption of a new technology such as CAIS will be without hitches thus enabling the company to receive all the accruable benefits which results in EP. Lastly, the study\u2019s findings show that the environmental context of CAIS has a significant negative effect on construction companies\u2019 economic performance (H3). This is contrary to the findings of Zhang, et al. [51] who reported a positive significant effect of EC on construction companies\u2019 EP. Also, Muhammad Auwal, et al. [54] found that the pressure emanating from the companies\u2019 operating environment would serve as a trigger for improved economic performance, thus contradicting the findings of this present study. The negative significant effect of EC on construction companies\u2019 EP obtained in this study could be due to the construction companies\u2019 inability to manage external pressure coming from their external environment such as pressure from suppliers and clients. Another likely reason for the negative effect of EC on EP could be that the operating environment does not provide an avenue for a healthy competition between companies. This discourages innovation in the companies adopting CAIS, thus impacting negatively on their EP. This finding also contradicts the findings of Kohli and\nEvaluating the Impact of Computerized Accounting Information\u2026 Informatica 46 (2022) 13\u201324 21\nMelville [53] who view innovation resulting from the adoption of CAIS as a trigger for competitive advantage and increase in EP."

            "text": "This research was designed to investigate the effect of TC of CAIS on EP, the effect of OC of CAIS on EP, and the effect of EC of CAIS on EP. The results obtained show that hypothesis 1 (H1), and hypothesis 2 (H2) were supported, while hypothesis 3 (H3) was not supported. The findings of this research suggest that both the technological and organizational context of CAIS need to be adequately grounded in construction companies to guarantee optimal EP. Also, the negative relationship obtained in the relationship between EC and EP means that the current operating environment cannot yield a favorable economic performance outcome when CAIS is adopted. Therefore, the government and professional organizations are required to do more by way of enlightening the companies and creating a favorable framework for an economically viable CAIS adoption process."

First, quantitative method was used in this study and data were collected using a structured survey questionnaire. This restricts the respondents to the range of answers presented in the questionnaire. Future research can consider adopting a qualitative method to gain greater perspectives on the relationships considered in this study. Also, this research was carried out in Iraq, a developing country in the west of the Asian continent. Therefore, its findings can only be generalized within this context. It is recommended that future research be carried out in other countries, and the results compared with those gotten in this study."
