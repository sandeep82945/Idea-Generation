In a recent paper Bj\u00f6rn Gustafsson [2] presented equations for the motion of hydrodynamic vortices on closed surfaces (compact and boundaryless). These equations, which will be referred as Gustafsson\u2019s equations, are different from those used by previous authors in the case of surfaces of genus g greater than zero. Gustafsson\u2019s introduced extra-terms that correctly couple the motion of the vortices to the variation of the harmonic part of the velocity field. In this note we present the equations of Gustafsson in the case of a single vortex of intensity one in a closed surface of a genus greater than zero. We will derive Gustafsson\u2019s equation not using a renormalized energy as done in [2], but our weak formulation of Euler\u2019s equation given in [6]. The reader must consult [2] for the Hamiltonian formulation of the equations of a system of vortices. The ideas in [2] can be used to correct the equations obtained in [6] for systems of vortices in surfaces with boundaries and/or ends and genus greater than zero. Gustafsson\u2019s result do not change the equations in [6] when the surface has genus zero but it is not simply connected due to the presence of boundaries or ends, and this we will be explained below. Every closed surface S of genus g \u2265 1 can be obtained topologically by identifying in pairs appropriate sides of a 4g-sided polygon ([1] chapter 1). In Figure 1 we illustrate the construction of a torus (genus 1) and of a bi-torus (genus 2).

Note: the harmonic forms are conformal invariants.\nWe are interested in the motion of an incompressible fluid of density one in a Riemannian surface S. The velocity field of the fluid will be denoted by v and the corresponding velocity one-form by u = \u3008v, \u00b7\u3009, where \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009 is the inner product defined by the Riemannian metric. The Riemannian two-form of area will be denoted by \u00b5 and the vorticity two-form of the fluid by du.\nEuler\u2019s equation for the motion of the fluid can be written as ([6] Eq. (3.3) after using Cartan\u2019s identity Lvu = ivdu+ du(v)):\n\u2202tu+ ivdu = \u2212d ( p+ |v|2\n2\n) (3)\nA hydrodynamic vortex is a singular velocity field defined in the following way. The Green\u2019s function of S is the unique function that satisfies\n\u2212\u2206qG(q, p) = \u03b4p(q)\u2212 V \u22121 , \u222b S G(q, p)\u00b5(q) = 0 , (4)\nwhere \u2206 = \u2217d \u2217 d is the Laplace-Beltrami operator1 on S, \u03b4p is the \u03b4distribution of Dirac, and V is the volume of S. A hydrodynamic vortex of intensity one at a point p is the velocity field q \u2192 v(q) associated with the velocity form \u2212 \u2217 dqG(q, p) = \u3008v(q), \u00b7\u3009.\nThe weak formulation of Euler\u2019s equation presented in Section 5 of [6] implies that a hydrodynamic vortex at p must be carried by the regular part of the flow (Eq. (5.7) in ibid.)\np\u0307 = vr(p) , (5)\n1If \u03b81 and \u03b82 are two orthonormal one-forms on an open set in S, then the Hodge-star operator \u201c\u2217\u201d associated with the Riemannian metric is a linear map onto the space of differential forms that satisfies:\n\u22171 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 = \u00b5, \u2217\u03b81 = \u03b82, \u2217\u03b82 = \u2212\u03b81, \u2217\u00b5 = 1.\nwhere vr(p) is the regular part of the velocity field v at p. The one-form U = \u3008vr, \u00b7\u3009, which corresponds to vr, has two terms\nU = \u2212 \u2217 dR 2 + \u03b7 , (6)\nwhere R and \u03b7 depend on p. The function R in the first term is the Robin function that is the regular part of the Green\u2019s function at p:\nR(p) = lim `(q,p)\u21920\n[ G(q, p) + 1\n2\u03c0 log `(q, p)\n] , (7)\nwhere `(q, p) is the Riemannian distance between q and p. The second term \u03b7 corresponds to a harmonic velocity field, which may exist in the absence of vortices and that generates a \u201cbackground flow\u201d.\nAny harmonic form on S can be written as a linear combination of the forms \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1g, \u03b21, . . . , \u03b2g:\n\u03b7 = g\u2211 j=1 Aj\u03b1j +Bj\u03b2j . (8)\nThe velocity one-form of the vortex with background flow is\nq \u2192 u = \u2212 \u2217 dqG(q, p) + \u03b7(q) (9)\nwhere G is the Green\u2019s function in equation (4).Following [2], if u satisfies Euler\u2019s equation (3), then the time derivative of the circulation along the curve a1 must satisfy\nd\ndt \u222b a1 u = \u222b a1 \u2202tu =\n\u2212 \u222b a1 ivdu+ \u222b a1 d ( p+ |u|2 2 ) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\n= 1\nV \u222b a1 iv\u00b5\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 \u2217u = 1 V \u222b a1 \u2217\u03b7 , (10)\nwhere we have assumed that p /\u2208 a1 and used equation (4) to write du = \u2212 d \u2217 d G = \u2212 1\nV \u00b5. Similar equations must hold for other generators\na2, . . . , ag, b1, . . . , bg of the homology. The left hand side of equation (10) can be simplified using the identities ([2] Section 3.2)\ndp \u222b aj \u2217qdqG(q, p) = \u03b2j , dp \u222b bj \u2217qdqG(q, p) = \u2212\u03b1j , j = 1, . . . , g , (11)\nwhere the integration is with respect to q and \u03b1j and \u03b2j depend on p. The harmonic forms {\u2217\u03b11, . . . , \u2217\u03b1g, \u2217\u03b21, . . . \u2217 \u03b2g} also form a basis of the cohomology of S, that is related to the basis {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1g, \u03b21, . . . \u03b2g} by means of the matrix (see [1] chapter 3 or [2] Eqs. (5.20) and (5.21))(\n\u2217\u03b1 \u2217\u03b2\n) = ( \u2212R P \u2212Q RT )( \u03b1 \u03b2 ) , (12)\nwhere P > 0, Q > 0 and R are g \u00d7 g square matrices given by\nPjk = \u222b S \u03b1j \u2227 \u2217\u03b1k , Qjk = \u222b S \u03b2j \u2227 \u2217\u03b2k , Rjk = \u222b S \u03b1j \u2227 \u2217\u03b2k , (13)\nand RT denotes the transpose of R. From equation (10), and its variations for other elements of the homology a2, . . . , ag, b1, . . . , bg, and equations (11) and (12), we obtain:\nA\u0307k \u2212 \u03b2k[p\u0307] = \u2212 1\nV g\u2211 j=1 AjRjk +BjQjk\nB\u0307k + \u03b1k[p\u0307] = 1\nV g\u2211 j=1 AjPjk +BjRkj , k = 1, . . . , g .\n(14)\nEquations (14) must be complemented by equations (5), i.e. p\u0307 = vr(p), and (6), i.e, U = \u2212\u2217 dR\n2 + \u03b7, where U = \u3008vr, \u00b7\u3009 is the \u201cvortex velocity form\u201d.\nUsing the relation ip\u0307\u00b5 = ivr\u00b5 = \u2217U the equation for the velocity of the vortex can be written as\nip\u0307 \u00b5 = \u2217U = d R\n2 + \u2217\u03b7 , where\n\u2217 \u03b7 = g\u2211 j=1 Aj(\u2217\u03b1j) +Bj(\u2217\u03b2j) . (15)\nEquations (14) and (15) are those obtained by Gustafsson [2] for the motion of a unitary vortex in a closed surface.\nAt this point it is instructive to show why Gustafsson\u2019s results do not change the equations in [6] when the surface has genus zero but it is not simply connected due to the presence of boundaries or ends. The analysis will be done in the context of an example.\nLetA be the Euclidean annulusA := {1 < |z| < 2; z = x+iy \u2208 C}. There is a unique Green\u2019s function F on A that satisfies \u2212\u2206qF (q, p) = \u03b4p(q) and F (q, p) = 0 for q \u2208 \u2202A. Consider the velocity one-form u = \u2212 \u2217 dqF (q, p).\nWe will check whether u defined in this way can be a solution to Euler\u2019s equation. As we did in equation (10), we will compute the time derivative of the circulation along each boundary component |z| = j, j = 1, 2, of A (orientation is positive when the interior of A is on the left-hand side of the boundary component). We use that \u2212dq \u2217q dqF (q, p) = 0 for q 6= p, because F is harmonic, and we obtain\nd\ndt \u222b |z|=j u = \u222b |z|=j \u2202tu = \u2212 \u222b |z|=j d ( p+ |U |2 2 ) = 0 . (16)\nIn analogy to equation (11), it can be verified that the functions defined by \u03c9j(p) = \u2212 \u222b |z|=j \u2217dqF (q, p) = \u222b |z|=j u j = 1, 2 (17)\nare harmonic on A, and satisfy \u03c91(p) = 1 for |p| = 1, \u03c91(p) = 0 for |p| = 2; and \u03c92(p) = 1 for |p| = 2, \u03c92(p) = 0 for |p| = 1 (in this case \u03c91(p) = 2|p| \u2212 1 and \u03c92(p) = \u2212 2|p| + 2). If p is moving and d dt \u03c9j(p) 6= 0, then equation (16) is false, namely circulation is not conserved at the boundaries. In order to fix F we add to it a convenient combination of \u03c91 and \u03c92 such that the circulations at the boundary components of A remain constant. If we denote the circulations at the boundaries |z| = 1 and |z| = 2 by c1 and c2, respectively, then we can prescribe c1 and c2 arbitrarily provided that c1 + c2 = 1 due to Stokes theorem. For instance, if c1 = 0 and c2 = 1, then the \u201chydrodynamic Green\u2019s function\u201d, which is used to define a vortex, is [3, 4] (or [6] Eq. (3.17))\nG(q, p) = F (q, p) + \u03c91(p)\u03c91(q)\n4\u03c0 . (18)\nThe difference between the loss of connectivity due to boundaries and due to genus is that in the former it always possible to find a Green\u2019s function that satisfy the circulation conditions imposed by Euler\u2019s equation, possibly by adding harmonic functions, while in the latter it is necessary to add harmonic forms to fulfill the circulation conditions, since the Green\u2019s function cannot be modified. The mistake in [6] was to have neglected the role of harmonic forms in surfaces with nontrivial genus in substituting differentials of harmonic functions in surfaces with boundaries.\nThe effect of Gustafsson\u2019s equation upon the paper [6] is restricted to the definition of vortices on surfaces of genus greater than zero, since no example of this kind of surface was treated in ibid. The main effect of Gustafsson\u2019s equation is in my paper [5]: \u201cThe motion of a vortex on a closed surface of\nconstant negative curvature\u201d. In this reference, I numerically computed the Robin function on the Bolza surface (of constant curvature and of genus 2) and using equation (15) without the term \u2217\u03b7 I concluded that a vortex in the Bolza surface moves, as previously conjectured by Jair Koiller. The vortex trajectories in Figures 7 and 8 in ibid. may not be correct (these figures show the level sets of the Robin function), however the conclusion that the vortex moves is still correct. Indeed, the following four main conclusions obtained in the papers [5] and [6] remain valid after Gustafsson\u2019s result:\n(a) A vortex in the Bolza surface, a surface constant of negative curvature -1 and genus 2, moves.\n(b) If S is a closed hyperelliptic surface of genus g \u2265 2 and constant curvature, then every Weierstrass point of S is an equilibrium of the motion of a single vortex (Theorem 3.4 in [5]).\n(c) It is possible to construct vortex crystals in the Poincare\u0301 disc with vortices placed at the lift of the Weirestrass points to the universal covering (see Section 5 of [5] for details).\n(d) A \u201csteady vortex metric\u201d is a Riemannian metric in which a single vortex does not move regardless of its position [6]. A Riemannian metric is a steady vortex metric if, and only if, its Robin function is constant.\nThe four statements above are corollaries of the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. If dR(p) = 0 for a certain p \u2208 S, then p and \u03b7 = 0 (A1 = . . . = Ag = B1 = . . . = Bg = 0) comprise an equilibrium of Gustafsson\u2019s equation.\nFor Gustafsson\u2019s equation, a vortex remains at rest regardless of its initial position if, and only if, the Robin function R is constant and \u03b7 is chosen initially equal to zero.\nProof. The first claim in the theorem is immediate: If dR(p) = 0 for a certain p, then p and \u03b7 = 0 comprise an equilibrium of equations (14) and (15).\nThe velocity of a vortex is null regardless of its position if, and only if, the velocity form U(p) is null for every p \u2208 S. The L2(S) norm of both sides of equation (15) is given by\u222b\nS U \u2227 \u2217U = \u222b S d R 2 \u2227 \u2217dR 2 + \u222b S \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 (19)\nbecause \u222b S dR 2 \u2227 \u03b7 = 0. For any one form \u03c3 = \u03c31\u03b81 + \u03c32\u03b82, where \u03b81, \u03b82 are local orthonormal one-forms, \u03c3 \u2227 \u2217\u03c3 = (\u03c321 + \u03c322)\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 = (\u03c321 + \u03c322)\u00b5.\nTherefore, the left-hand side of equation (19) is zero if, and only if, both terms in the right-hand side are zero.\nPhase space, Hamiltonian function, and symplectic form. Let H1(S) denote the space of harmonic forms on S. The phase space of\nGustafsson\u2019s equation is the Cartesian product S \u00d7 H1(S). A point in the phase space is a pair (p, \u03b7) where p \u2208 S is a possible position of the vortex and \u03b7 \u2208 H1(S) is a possible harmonic velocity form. Let {\u03b11q, . . . , \u03b1gq, \u03b21q, . . . , \u03b2gq} be the basis of H1(S) that satisfies the relations (1). The index q \u2208 S indicates that the form does not act on vectors defined on the first factor of the phase space S \u00d7H1(S).\nWe define the Bergman kernel\nBqp = g\u2211 j=1 \u03b1jp\u03b2jq \u2212 \u03b2jp\u03b1jq , (20)\nwhere the index p indicates that the form acts on the first factor of S\u00d7H1(S). Using equation (2) it is easy to verify that, for any harmonic form \u03c3q =\u2211\nk Ak\u03b1kq +Bk\u03b2kq,\u222b Sq \u03c3q \u2227Bqp = \u03c3p = \u2211 j Aj\u03b1jp +Bj\u03b2jp . (21)\nUsing this notation and the definition of B we can rewrite Gustafsson\u2019s equations (14) and (15) in a concise way:\n\u03b7\u0307q + ip\u0307Bqp = 1\nV \u2217 \u03b7q (22)\nip\u0307 \u00b5p = d Rp 2 + \u2217\u03b7p , (23)\nwhere ip\u0307Bqp = \u2211g\nj=1 \u03b1jp[p\u0307]\u03b2jq \u2212 \u03b2jp[p\u0307]\u03b1jq. Let H be the function\nH(p, \u03b7) = R(p)\n2 +\n1\n2 \u222b Sq \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 , (24)\ndefined on the phase space2.\n2If \u03b7 = \u2211g\nj=1Aj\u03b1j +Bj\u03b2j , then using equations (12) and (13)\u222b Sq \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 = ( AT , BT )( P R RT Q )( A B ) (25)\nThe function H is a first integral of Gustafsson\u2019s equation, that is dH dt\n= dR[p\u0307] 2 + \u222b Sq \u03b7\u0307 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 = 0. Indeed, equation (23) implies dR[p\u0307] 2 = \u2212 \u2217 \u03b7p[p\u0307] and equation (22) implies\n\u03b7\u0307q \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q + ip\u0307Bqp \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q = 1\nV \u2217 \u03b7q \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q = 0\u21d2\u222b\nSq \u03b7\u0307q \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q = \u2212 \u222b Sq ip\u0307Bqp \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q = \u2217\u03b7p[p\u0307] ,\nwhere we have used equation (21). Note: if p is a local minimum of the Robin function, then conservation of H and the positivity of \u222b Sq \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 implies that (p, \u03b7) = (p, 0) is a stable equilibrium. Let \u2126 be the following two form defined on S \u00d7H1(S):\n\u2126[(p\u0307, \u03b7\u0307), (P,N)] = \u00b5(p\u0307, P )\u2212 V \u222b Sq (\u03b7\u0307p + ip\u0307Bqp) \u2227 (Nq + iPBqp) (26)\nwhere (p\u0307, \u03b7\u0307) and (P,N) is a pair of vectors at a point (p, \u03b7) \u2208 S\u00d7H1(S) and the integration is with respect to q. In the coordinates \u03b7 = \u2211g j=1Aj\u03b1j+Bj\u03b2j, \u2126 can be written as\n\u2126 = \u00b5\u2212 V g\u2211 i=1 ( dAj \u2212 \u03b2jp ) \u2227 ( dBj + \u03b1jp ) . (27)\nThe forms \u03b1jp and \u03b2jp are closed, and so in any contractible open ball B in S there exist functions \u03bej(p) and \u03b6j(p) such that \u03b1jp = d\u03bej and \u03b2jp = d\u03b6j. The map B \u00d7H1(S)\u2192 B \u00d7H1(S) given by( p, (A,B) ) \u2192 ( p, (A\u0303, B\u0303) ) where A\u0303j = Aj\u2212\u03b6j(p) , B\u0303j = Bj+\u03bej(p) , j = 1, . . . , g\ndefines new coordinates on B\u00d7H1(S). In these coordinates, which were used in [2],\n\u2126 = \u00b5\u2212 V g\u2211 i=1 dA\u0303j \u2227 dB\u0303j , (28)\nand it becomes clear that \u2126 is symplectic. We will show that (p\u0307, \u03b7\u0307) given in equations (22) and (23) can be obtained from the equality\n\u2126[(p\u0307, \u03b7\u0307), (P,N)] = dH[(P,N)] = dR\n2 [P ] + \u222b Sq Nq \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q , (29)\nthat is valid for any vector (P,N) at the point (p, \u03b7) \u2208 S\u00d7H1(S). For P = 0\n\u2212V \u222b Sq (\u03b7\u0307q + ip\u0307Bqp) \u2227Nq = \u222b Sq Nq \u2227 \u2217\u03b7q ,\nand equation (22) must hold. For N = 0\ndR\n2 [P ] = \u00b5(p\u0307, P )\u2212 V \u222b Sq\n(\u03b7\u0307p + ip\u0307Bqp)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 = 1\nV \u2217\u03b7q (22)\n\u2227iPBqp = \u00b5(p\u0307, P )\u2212 iP \u222b Sq\n\u2217\u03b7q \u2227Bqp\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =\u2217\u03b7p (21)\nthat implies equation (23). The equations of motion of a single vortex in the 2-torus. Every Riemannian two torus is conformally equivalent to a flat torus R2/(~aZ+~bZ) where ~a = ax\u2202x + ay\u2202y and ~b = bx\u2202x + by\u2202y are the generators of the torus lattice. The volume form of the metric is given by \u00b5 = \u03bb2dx\u2227dy. We assume that the volume of both the torus and the flat torus are one, namely\nV = \u222b S \u00b5 = 1 and axby \u2212 aybx = 1 . (30)\nThe generators of the homology of the torus are the curves a := {t~a : t \u2208 [0, 1)} and b := {t~b : t \u2208 [0, 1)}. The basis of harmonic one forms {\u03b1, \u03b2} such that \u222b a \u03b1 = \u222b b \u03b2 = 1 and \u222b a \u03b2 = \u222b b \u03b1 = 0 is given by\n\u03b1 = bydx\u2212 bxdy , \u03b2 = \u2212aydx+ axdy , (31)\nwhich implies\n\u2217 \u03b1 = bxdx+ bydy , \u2217\u03b2 = \u2212axdx\u2212 aydy . (32)\nLet x\u0307\u2202x + y\u0307\u2202y denote the velocity of the vortex, R be the Robin function associated with the Riemannian metric3, and \u03b7 = A\u03b1 + B\u03b2. In this case\n3In this case, it can be shown that the Robin function is given by\nR = 1\n2\u03c0 log \u03bb+ 2\u03c6+ const ,\nwhere \u03c6 is the solution to the equation in R2/(~aZ +~bZ)\n\u22022\u03c6 \u2202x2 + \u22022\u03c6 \u2202y2 = \u03bb2 \u2212 1 .\nGustafsson\u2019s equation (15) becomes\n\u03bb2 x\u0307 = 1\n2\n\u2202R \u2202y + byA\u2212 ayB\n\u03bb2 y\u0307 = \u22121 2 \u2202R \u2202x \u2212 bxA+ axB ,\n(33)\nand equation (14) can be written as\nbyA\u0307\u2212 ayB\u0307 \u2212 y\u0307 = bxA\u2212 axB \u2212 bxA\u0307+ axB\u0307 + x\u0307 = byA\u2212 ayB .\n(34)\nThe Hamiltonian function as defined in equation (24) is\nH = R(x, y)\n2 +\n1\n2\n( A,B )( b2x + b2y \u2212axbx \u2212 ayby \u2212axbx \u2212 ayby a2x + a2y )( A B ) (35)\nThe symplectic form as defined in (27) is\n\u2126 = \u03bb2dx \u2227 dy \u2212 (dA\u2212 \u03b2) \u2227 (dB + \u03b1) , (36)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are given in equation (31). If the torus is flat, then \u03bb = 1, R =constant, and equations (33) and (34) reduce to\nx\u0307 = byA\u2212 ayB , y\u0307 = \u2212bxA+ axB , A\u0307 = 0 , B\u0307 = 0 .
