Recent studies have highlighted an attainment gap between male and female residents in performance evaluations on Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones. Because of difficulties in blinding evaluators to gender, it remains unclear whether these observed disparities are because of implicit bias or other causes. OBJECTIVE To estimate the magnitude of implicit gender bias in assessments of procedural competency in emergency medicine residents and whether the gender of the evaluator is associated with identified implicit gender bias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was performed from 2018 to 2020 in which emergency medicine residency faculty assessed procedural competency by evaluating videos of residents performing 3 procedures in a simulated environment. They were blinded to the intent of the study. Proceduralists were filmed performing each procedure from 2 different viewpoints simultaneously by 2 different cameras. One was a gender-blinded (ie, hands-only) view, and the other a wide-angled gender-evident (ie, whole-body) view. The faculty evaluators viewed videos in a random order and assessed procedural competency on a global rating scale with extensive validity evidence for the evaluation of video-recorded procedural performance. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based on gender. The secondary outcome was to determine if there was a difference in the evaluations based on the gender of the evaluator. RESULTS Fifty-one faculty evaluators enrolled from 19 states, with 22 male participants (43.1%), 29 female participants (56.9%), and a mean (SD) age of 37 (6.4) years. Each evaluator assessed all 60 procedures: 30 gender-blinded (hands-only view) videos and 30 identical gender-evident (wide angle) videos. There were no statistically significant differences in the study evaluators\u2019 scores of the proceduralists based on their gender, and the gender of the evaluator was not associated with the difference in mean scores. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, we did not identify a difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based upon the gender of the resident proceduralist or the gender of the faculty evaluator. JAMA Network Open. 2022;5(2):e2147351. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.47351 Key Points Question Does gender disparity exist in evaluation of procedural competency for emergency medicine (EM) residents? Findings This cross-sectional study enrolled 51 EM faculty from 19 states who evaluated 60 videos of 10 EM residents performing 3 procedures. Each procedure was shot with a genderblinded view and a gender-evident view, and there was no significant difference in the EM faculty evaluations of procedural competency based on gender. Meaning These findings suggest that there was no difference in the evaluation of procedural competency based on the gender of the resident proceduralist or the gender of the faculty evaluator. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

            "text": "Gender disparities exist throughout the field of medicine, including in resident milestone assessments,1,2 academic rank,3,4 authorship in medical journals,5 invited commentaries,6 and salary.7,8 While the number of women entering medical school now exceeds that of men,9 women remain significantly underrepresented as faculty in academic medicine, particularly at advanced academic ranks.3,10 Female academic physicians report experiencing significant gender bias in their careers.11\nResidency training may be a pivotal time when gender bias influences career decisions.12 In addition to qualitative differences in the kind of feedback that emergency medicine (EM) residents received from attending physicians, recent studies have highlighted an attainment gap between male and female EM residents in evaluations of performance on the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones.2,13 Dayal et al2 found that milestone ratings were higher for men than women at graduation while similar at entry into residency. A large study1 examining longitudinal ACGME milestone ratings for all EM residents over 4 years found men were rated as performing better than women at graduation for 3 procedural subcompetencies, including their general approach to procedures. Proposed explanations include implicit gender bias of faculty evaluators and actual gender-based differences in performance or skill. These gender-based differences may be attributable to the cumulative effects of disadvantages, such as reduced opportunities to access longitudinal mentorship, obtain meaningful feedback, or observe gender concordant role models.2,14\nDisambiguating between these potential causes of observed disparities is vital to developing interventions to improve gender equity. Blinding evaluators to the gender of the proceduralist would seemingly eliminate implicit bias; this has been tried successfully in other academic domains,15,16 but has been pragmatically difficult to perform in the assessment of clinical tasks.\nIn this study, we estimate the magnitude of implicit gender bias in the assessment of procedural competency in EM residents using a novel, video-based strategy with the gender of the resident hidden vs apparent. Further, we assess whether the gender of the evaluator is associated with any identified implicit gender bias."

This analysis generated 4 unique comparative groups: female evaluator and female proceduralist, female evaluator and male proceduralist, male evaluator and female proceduralist, and male evaluator and male proceduralist. Scores were summarized using mean evaluation ratings based on grouping derived from the gender of the evaluator and proceduralist (eg, mean of female evaluator for female proceduralist).

To account for this, we modeled the difference between gender-evident and genderblinded (dependent variable) pairs of videos with a mixed-effects model that included fixed effects for each evaluator and random effects for each proceduralist using the xtmxed command in STATA. Data were analyzed using Stata 16 (Statacorp).\nThe key independent variable was proceduralist gender. A significant coefficient for this variable indicates that scores are significantly different between the genders when the gender is revealed as opposed to concealed. We likewise modeled the difference between gender-evident vs genderblinded using an interaction term between reviewer and proceduralist gender to determine if any potential reviewer gender bias exists or was associated with the gender of the reviewer.\nExisting studies have shown a change of 10% per year in GRS scores as residents progress through training.23 As such, we estimated that a 10% difference in GRS scores is clinically meaningful. We calculated an a priori study size to detect an absolute difference of at least 10% between the assessment scores for the blinded and unblinded videos. A baseline score of 60% (3 on the Likert scale) was used with a 15% variance based on prior research using the OSATS GRS.23 Using \u03b1 = .0125 (based on a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) and a power of 90%, the projected sample size required was 21 male reviewers and 21 female reviewers assuming independence of the observations by reviewers. Although independence is likely violated in this study design, the assumption yields conservative estimates for the needed sample size. Statistical analyses were performed by study investigators who were blinded to the gender of the evaluators and the gender of the proceduralist. Statistical analysis was performed in November 2021, significance was set at \u03b1 = .05, and tests were 2-sided for the multilevel model."

            "text": "We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess implicit gender bias in the evaluation of EM resident procedural competency, using a validated approach to blinding evaluators to the gender of the proceduralists.17 Each of the 51 faculty evaluators assessed 60 procedure videos (30 gender-blinded and 30 gender-evident), recording evaluations of 6 unique domains on a Likert scale for a total of 18 360 data points. Based on the perceived and documented prevalence of gender bias in medicine in general13 and EM specifically,2 we hypothesized that there would be a greater difference in scores for female proceduralists. However, we found no significant difference.\nThis finding might not be surprising given the conclusions of existing studies. In a systematic review, Klein et al14 found that only 5 of 9 included studies demonstrated gender bias, though none were prospective. In a retrospective single-center study of EM residents performing simulated procedures, there was no difference in evaluations associated with resident gender.24 Other studies showed slower milestone progression for female EM residents during residency2 and small differences in 6 of 22 ACGME milestone subcompetencies.1\nThe discrepancies may be related to differences in assessment data. The 2 large studies1,2 that showed gender disparities in procedural evaluations were based on ACGME milestone data from end-of-semester aggregate milestone ratings. These assessments are determined every 6 months by a clinical competency committee (CCC) composed of several faculty members who synthesize multiple sources of assessment information (eg, end of shift evaluations, procedure logs, in-training examination scores, direct observation checklist, and other workplace-based narrative assessments) into a score on each of the 23 milestone subcompetencies.25 These summative assessments often\nTable 2.

This discrepancy suggests that the bias observed in large milestone data may enter the assessment process downstream from the direct observation of procedural performance. Alternatively, the CCCs making the aggregate assessments in the 2 large milestone studies may not have had access to robust direct observation data.\nMost real-world faculty evaluations are inherently less objective than checklist-based procedural evaluations. However, existing tools for direct observations of EM milestones lack validity and reliability. While some argue that subjective expert judgments by medical professionals are unavoidable and should be embraced as the core of assessment of medical trainees,26 the complexity of how gender bias manifests in subjective resident assessments remains a significant hurdle.14 Further, procedural competencies are a small subset of the 23 EM milestones. While objectifying procedural assessments seems like low-hanging fruit, implicit bias may be more insidious and difficult to gauge in the review of competencies with less reliable evaluation methods. The fact that we found no implicit bias in procedural assessments in our study does not suggest it does not exist in other aspects of residency training.\nOur findings might also be explained, in part, by progress in reducing the impact of implicit bias among EM faculty. There have been many recent efforts to decrease the impact of implicit gender bias in medicine, including educational programs addressing implicit bias that have been shown to change faculty attitudes toward women in academic medicine. EM has been a more progressive specialty, with committees from the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Association of Women Emergency Physicians, the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine\u2019s Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine and Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine, and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine Women in Emergency Medicine Section working to promote both awareness and change regarding gender issues. Importantly, Females Working in Emergency Medicine has a web-based Women in Medicine educational curriculum and hosts a yearly conference dedicated to providing resources and support for women in EM. While our study might provide some hope, there is still considerable work to be done. While we do not suggest neglecting implicit bias training, it may be more fruitful to focus research and resources on developing interventions aimed at the other systemic and institutional level contributors to gender disparities."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "This study had limitations. Our faculty cohort may have different levels of implicit bias than other EM faculty; our faculty evaluators were 56% women, which is higher than the 28% female faculty across academic EM. While this could bias our study, our results are consistent with other studies that found no significant differences based on the gender of the evaluator.2 While our study participants were mostly core faculty who sit on CCCs, they were a relatively junior cohort with a mean age of approximately 38 years. While some might hypothesize that a cohort of more senior faculty would have different levels of implicit bias, previous studies show only small correlations between age and implicit or explicit gender bias.\nThe proceduralists were somewhat unbalanced in terms of their level of experience, with the men being slightly more experienced than the women. This reflects the balance of our residency program, which had more men in the later PGYs and more women in the earlier PGYs. However, the difference in scores between men and women was not significant.\nWe did not account for viewer fatigue when assigning the videos. There were almost 10 hours of videos, which may have resulted in decreased vigilance toward the end of the session. Additionally, the videos were viewed in the same order by all the evaluators, which introduces the possibility of viewer fatigue blunting the difference on the same videos for each evaluator.\nJAMA Network Open. 2022;5(2):e2147351. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.47351 (Reprinted) February 7, 2022 7/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/17/2024\nThe gender-blinded and gender-evident videos were shot at the same time from different angles. The evaluators may have noticed familiar movements or errors that made them recognize that they were evaluating the same procedure twice. The Hawthorne effect could have played a role in creating a type II error that fails to demonstrate implicit bias that truly existed. However, the evaluators were blinded to the purpose of the study, and the sheer number of procedures to review combined with the random order likely prevented most, if not all, evaluators from drawing this conclusion.\nRegarding our assessment tool, there is minimal consensus on what represents a significant difference in scores on the OSATS GRS. Multiple studies have used the GRS, but they are heterogeneous, use multiple variations of the GRS (sometimes in combination with other measures including checklists), and use different GRS targets. We chose a measure that was intuitive based on an extensive review of previous research using the GRS. As such, our sample size may be less than ideal. Further, to parallel what happens in real-world settings, we chose to do minimal faculty training on GRS use. Faculty may have misinterpreted or misapplied the tool, though previous studies have shown that evaluator training did not significantly improve reliability."
