    "abstractText": "Composite thin-walled booms can easily be folded and self-deployed by releasing stored strain energy. Thus, such booms can be used to deploy antennas, solar sails, and optical telescopes. In the present work, a new four-cell lenticular honeycomb deployable (FLHD) boom is proposed, and the relevant parameters are optimized. Coiling dynamics analysis of the FLHD boom under a pure bending load is performed using nonlinear explicit dynamics analysis, and the coiling simulation is divided into three consecutive steps, namely, the flattening step, the holding step, and the hub coiling step. An optimal design method for the coiling of the FLHD boom is developed based on a back propagation neural network (BPNN). A full factorial design of the experimental method is applied to create 36 sample points, and surrogate models of the coiling peak moment (Mpeak) and maximum principal stress (Smax) are established using the BPNN. Fatigue cracks caused by stress concentration are avoided by setting Smax to a specific constraint and the wrapping Mpeak and mass of the FLHD boom as objectives. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used for optimization via ISIGHT software.",

Introduction\nDeployable composite ultra-thin booms can easily be folded and self-deployed by releasing stored strain energy; thus, these booms can be applied to membrane antennas and solar sails. Many cross-sectional deployable booms, such as lenticular booms [1], triangular rollable and collapsible (TRAC) booms [2,3], and storable tubular extendable member (STEM) booms [4,5], are available. For example, a novel collapsible boom has been applied to a roll-out solar array, and rolling and deploying experiments have been performed on this prototype [6]. Coiling of the tape-spring and composite thin-walled booms [7,8] and the micromechanical behavior of two-ply weave laminates under small strains have also been investigated [9]. An active\u2013passive composited driving deployable lenticular boom for space probes has been proposed. In addition, an optimal design of lenticular booms has been developed for its modal and wrapping analysis [10\u201312]. Experiments and numerical studies of the flattening and wrapping processes of deployable composite thin-walled lenticular tubes have been conducted [13\u201317]. A TRAC boom has been designed using a data-driven computational framework without considering the influence of the bonding web between two tapesprings [18,19]. The shapes of the consistent features of folded orthotropic collapsible booms made from metal and woven laminated composites have been calculated [20]. TRAC booms feature 10-fold greater cross-sectional inertia compared with lenticular booms and 34-fold greater cross-sectional inertia compared with STEM booms at the same package\nMaterials 2022, 15, 306. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15010306 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 306 2 of 14\nheight [21]. An N-shaped cross-section boom has been proposed, and its post-buckling properties have been optimized [22]. A four-cell lenticular honeycomb deployable (FLHD) boom composed of four pairwise symmetrical tape-springs has been proposed, as shown in Figure 1. Here, the two outer tape-springs feature only two bonded webs and four arcs, while the two inner tape-springs have four bonded webs and eight outer tangent arcs. The FLHD boom illustrated in Figure 1c is derived from the modified double lenticular (MDL) boom shown in Figure 1b. Compared with the DL boom in Figure 1a, the middle segment of the MDL boom is a smooth section located at the junction of the two arc segments. This segment is also key to the expansion of the MDL boom into the FLHD boom.\nMaterials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14\nTRAC booms feature 10-fold greater cross-sectional inertia compared with lenticular booms and 34-fold greater cross-sectional inertia compared with STEM booms at the same package height [21].

Three kinds of composite deployable booms.\nThe FLHD boom has higher bending and torsional stiffness than the DL and TRAC booms. However, material damage may occur during the dynamic process of complete coiling around the hub. Thus, geometric parameters critical to the deployment mechanism of the FLHD boom should be optimized. When the FLHD boom is close to the holding state after the full-flattening step, its cross-section could abruptly snap. The deformation is located in a short transverse curved region, and the moment increases quickly and reaches a peak moment (Mpeak). Mpeak and mass are set as objectives, while the maximum principal stress (Smax) is set as a constraint to increase the deployment-state stiffness. The bonded web-1 (w), arc radius (r), and central angle (\u03b8) of the tape-spring are set as variables. The finite element (FE) models of the full-coiling process are solved using the ABAQUS/Explicit solver. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is used to obtain an optimal design. The contents of this manuscript are as follows. The behavior of the FLHD boom is presented in Section 2.1, the three analysis steps of the complete coiling process are presented in Section 2.2, and the numerical results are discussed in Section 2.3.

Two radial rollers are symmetrically positioned on both sides of the FLHD boom, and 11 circumferential rollers are evenly distributed around a hub. The radius R of the hub is 125 mm, and the radial and circumferential rollers guide the FLHD boom to coil smoothly around the hub. The axial distance between reference point (RP) 13 and RP14 is 78 mm, and the radial distance between the outer arc of the circumferential roller and the edge of the hub is 25 mm.

Analysis Steps An FE model of the FLHD boom is established for numerical analysis. The FLHD boom is defined as an extruded shell consisting of 20,114 nodes and 19,214 four-node reduced integrate shell elements (S4R). The FE model is shown in Figure 5. The outer su - face of the hub is connected to control point referenc point 1 (RP1), and two FLHD boom nod s at the end of the bon ed web are set as slav nodes.

The coiling process c nsists of a flattening step (step ti e 0.1 s), a holding step (step time 0.05 s), and a hub coiling tep (step time 0.5 s). No direc contact exists between the surface of the boom nd the surface of the hub, and an interval of 0.36 mm i s t to avoid st ess c ncentration. The node sets of the FE model are shown in Figure 6.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 306 5 of 14Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nNode set A\nNode set B\nNode set C\nNode set D\nNode set E\nNode set F\nNode set G 1\n2 3\nNode set H\nNode set K\nNode set I Node set J\nFigure 6. Node sets used in the FE model.\nIn the first step of the simulation, the FLHD boom is pulled flat using tension. A shell edge load of 800N/m is applied to node-set A along the 2-axis direction, and a shell edge load in the opposite direction with the same size is applied to the B set. A viscous pressure of 0.5 Pa is applied to all surfaces of the boom to ensure the convergence of the explicit dynamic process. Two 50 N/m shell edge loads in opposite directions are applied to node sets F and G along the 3-axis to prevent the FLHD boom from warping. Node-set D and 14 reference points are clamped to fix the FLHD boom, hub, and rollers. The boundary condition of node-set D has fixed; node-sets A and B release displacement DoFs along the 1-axis and 2-axis. In the second step, a pressure of 0.1 MPa is applied to node sets C, J, I, H, and K, and the FLHD boom end is clamped and fixed on the hub. Boundary conditions are set as same as those in the first step. The last step is coiling one circle around the hub. The connection between the FLHD boom and hub is modeled by a beam-type multi-point constraint. RP1 of the hub is the control point, and node-set E is considered the salve node. A continuous rotation of 0.5 s is applied to RP1, the rotation displacement of UR 2 is set to 5.88 rad, and a steady step amplitude is established to reduce the loading shock on the FLHD boom. The timestep of the analysis is set to 0.1 s, and other degrees of freedom (DoFs) associated with RP1 are fixed. The DoF of node-set G is also fixed, except for the displacement along the 3-axis. Node-set G release displacement DoFs along the 3-axis. Node-set D releases displacement DoFs along the 1-axis and 3-axis, and rotate DoFs about the 2-axis.\n2.3. Numerical Results and Discussion The total CPU time required by an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9400F CPU @ 2.90GHz desktop computer to achieve one complete coil is approximately 20 h. The stress nephogram of the flattening, holding, and coiling processes for an FDLH with \u03b8 = 52.5\u00b0, w = 8 mm, and r = 27 mm is shown in Figure 7. In the flattening step, Smax is located close to the lower smooth section of the end of the FLHD boom, as shown in Figure 7a; however, in the holding and hub coiling steps, Smax is located in the middle smooth section connected to the arc sections on both sides of the boom near the hub. Smax does not show a regular trend with increasing wrapping angle, and its change shows strong nonlinearity. Smax during the coiling process is 632 MPa. If Smax exceeds the allowable stress of the material, the FLHD boom is destroyed. Therefore, Smax should be reduced. RP1 is the geometric center point of the hub, and the change of moment of RP1 during the whole coiling process can best reflect the change of moment of the whole boom. The moment curve of RP1 during the whole process is shown in Figure 8. At the beginning of the holding step, the moment\nFigure 6.

Error Analys s of the Surrogate Model\nIn general, the smaller the error of the surrogate model, the greater its fit and the higher its prediction accuracy. However, in actual applications, decreases in fitting error initially decrease the prediction error but then increase the error when a certain fitting error is reached. This phenomenon is referred to as the overfitting phenomenon in the BPNN. Obtaining more data is the best way to solve this overfitting problem. If sufficient data are available, the model can identify exceptions with greater accuracy. A diagram of the fitting effect of the training sample points is shown in Figure 10. An expression of the relative error is then defined to analyze the fitting effect of the model quantitatively.\nRE = f\u0303 (x(i))\u2212 f (x(i))\nf (x(i)) i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7m (7)\nwhere f (x(i)) is the FE result of sample i, f\u0303 (x(i)) is the BPNN surrogate model result of sample i, and m is the number of samples.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 306 9 of 14\nTable 2.
