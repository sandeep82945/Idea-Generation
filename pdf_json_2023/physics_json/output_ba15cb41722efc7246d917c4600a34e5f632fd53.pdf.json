    "abstractText": "With the proposal of replacing toxic solvents with non-toxic solvents in the concept of green chemistry, the development and utilization of new green extraction techniques have become a research hotspot. Phenolic compounds in edible oils have good antioxidant activity, but due to their low content and complex matrix, it is difficult to achieve a high extraction rate in a green and efficient way. This paper reviews the current research status of novel extraction materials in solid-phase extraction, including carbon nanotubes, graphene and metal\u2013organic frameworks, as well as the application of green chemical materials in liquid-phase extraction, including deep eutectic solvents, ionic liquids, supercritical fluids and supramolecular solvents. The aim is to provide a more specific reference for realizing the green and efficient extraction of polyphenolic compounds from edible oils, as well as another possibility for the future research trend of green extraction technology.",

With the increase in the types, production and consumption of edible oils, the selection of high-quality edible oils with high nutritional value has received more and more attention [1]. Edible oils contain some micronutrients also known as lipid concomitants, such as phenolic compounds, phytosterols, squalene and fat-soluble vitamins, etc., which are very low in content but play a vital role in human health. Among them, polyphenolic compounds are a class of plant secondary metabolites; different types of edible oils contain different types and contents of polyphenolic compounds [2], for example, avocado phenol in olive oil, and peach kernel oil triphenylene is a common polyphenolic compounds. These dispersed polyphenols can be found to be made up of multiple benzene ring structures and multiple hydroxyl groups, which include phenolic acids, tannins, isoflavones and stilbenes, etc. [3,4]. And polyphenolic compounds have a variety of pharmacological applications, including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory [5], antioxidant, diabetes prevention, cardioprotective and tumor-growth-inhibiting properties [6]. Consumption of olive oil rich in\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28248150 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 2 of 20\nphenolic compounds in the diet of Mediterranean populations has been reported to have cardioprotective effects, while showing favorable effects on the regulation of obesity [7]. Phenolic compounds are important components that occupy a major role in most functional foods and nutraceuticals. However, there are still many problems to overcome in the extraction and detection of phenolic compounds in edible oils [8]. First, the problem of extraction rate. Due to the low content of polyphenolic compounds in edible oils and the complexity of their matrix, many extraction methods are unable to extract them at the maximum yield level. Secondly, environmental issues. Conventional extraction techniques require the use of large amounts of organic solvents in the extraction of polyphenolic compounds and have the disadvantages of long extraction time, low selectivity and low extraction efficiency. Therefore, there is a need to find sample pretreatment techniques and extraction methods that can be more green and efficient, which need to ensure that the extraction method is easy to operate, shorten the extraction time, and reduce the use of organic solvents, etc. [9]. Green extraction technology is an environmentally friendly extraction technology developed with green chemistry as the core. Its sample pretreatment technology is to replace toxic solvents with non-toxic solvents, through a variety of auxiliary means, such as ultrasound-assisted technology, ultrahigh-pressure-assisted technology and microwave-assisted technology, etc. so that the extraction technology can overcome the limitations of the traditional method of sample preparation, thereby improving extraction efficiency and selectivity [10]. Based on the concept of green chemistry, this paper discusses in detail the green extraction technology of polyphenolic compounds in edible oils and related novel green chemistry materials. The contents include the application of carbon nanotubes, graphene and metal\u2013organic frameworks involved in novel extraction materials in solid-phase extraction, and the application of deep eutectic solvents, ionic liquids, supercritical fluids and supramolecular solvents in liquid-phase extraction. Emphasis is placed on the definition and classification of novel extraction materials and green reagents, and their application in natural product extraction."

The need for green extraction is based on the discovery and design of extraction processes that guarantee the optimal utilization of raw materials and solvents. Furthermore, one of the priorities set forth by the European Union in its environmental policy and legislation is to reduce the use of toxic solvents and volatile organic compounds, as most of these solvents are flammable, volatile and often toxic [12].

            "text": "Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are a new kind of one-dimensional nanomaterial [25]; CNTs are the typical materials of hollow structure, which are nanotubular materials formed by graphene molecules aligned closely and seamlessly with each other [26]. CNTs have the characteristics of high mechanical strength, low density, resistance to acidity and alkalinity, and chemical stability [27], and the main production processes of CNTs are graphite arc [28], laser evaporation [29] and chemical vapor deposition [30]. CNTs were officially discovered by Japanese scientists Lijima et al. [31] in 1991. CNTs can be categorized into single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) according to the number of layers of carbon atoms in their structure [32]. CNTs have great potential to be explored and applied in magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) techniques due to their unique structure and excellent physicochemical properties [33]. MSPE is applied through the use of powdered magnetic materials or magnetizable adsorbents, which are not only homogeneously dispersed, but also reversibly agglomerated, to facilitate the extraction of polyphenolic compounds by the strength of the applied and removed external magnetic field, as well as the contact area between the CNTs\u2019 magnetic adsorbent and the cooking oil contact area between the sample to facilitate the extraction of polyphenolic compounds. In a kind of hydrophilic multi-walled carbon nanotube (HMWCNT) [34], in which polyphenolic compounds (trans-resveratrol) in edible oils can be successfully enriched and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 5 of 20\ndetermined using MSPE, it was shown that HMWCNTs have strong adsorption properties and are excellent candidates for MSPE adsorbents. Rao et al. [35] prepared a new kind of magnetic carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube (c-MWCNT-MNP) for the determination of 23 polyphenolic compounds in sesame oil by magnetic solid-phase extraction\u2013liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. When mentioning the main parameters affecting the extraction efficiency, which include the type and volume of desorption solvent, extraction and desorption time, and washing solution and adsorbent dosage, this suggests that MWCNTs have a promising application in the routine analysis of phenolic compounds in edible oil sample prospects. Zhao et al. [36] established a method based on the alendronate sodium grafted mesoporous magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4@ANDS) with high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013ultraviolet-coupled detection, homemade magnetic composite HMWCNTs and Fe3O4 magnetite nanoparticles, which were assembled together as MSPE adsorbents, which can be used for the extraction and separation of trans-resveratrol from edible oils in a simple and efficient way. Ahmed et al. [37] used multiwalled carbon nanotubes as solid phase adsorbents to extract phenolic acids, flavonoids, and phenolics from 12 different samples with total contents ranging from 363 to 2658, 261 to 1646, and 224 to 1355 \u00b5g/100 g, respectively, and a total of 25 compounds were analyzed, which included 10 phenolic acids, 9 flavonoids, and 6 phenolics. Meanwhile, Pierantonio et al. [38] investigated the relative relationship between the amount of adsorbed biophenols and the number of carbon nanotubes used and the contact time, and it was necessary to reduce the number of carbon nanotubes used in order to obtain purer biophenol adsorbates, but an adequate number of carbon nanotubes ensured the selectivity of the biophenol adsorption in the presence of an excessive number of carbon nanotubes. This demonstrates not only the efficient extraction efficiency of multi-walled carbon nanotubes for phenolic compounds, but also the strong adsorption capacity for polyphenolic compounds. CNTs have been widely used in separation science as a novel material for sample extraction, and MWCNTs have great potential and offer a sizable alternative to perfect the preparation of magnetic adsorbent materials [39], while the method is applicable not only to edible oils but also to other fat matrices and analytes with different planar chemical structures."

Compared with traditional materials, MOF materials have a very desirable stability for the extraction and recovery of polyphenolic compounds due to their large porosity, large specific surface area, and diverse structures and functions, which are widely used in gas adsorption and separation technology, sensor technology, drug release technology, and many catalytic reactions [52]. Meanwhile, metal\u2013organic frameworks\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 7 of 20\nare used in polyphenolic compounds, furans, ketones, wheat oil, carboxylic acids and sugars for extraction and enrichment. It was shown that a highly selective adsorbent for polyphenolic compounds was selected from four metal\u2013organic skeleton materials; the four materials were MIL-53(Al), MIL-53(Cr), MIL-47(V), and Basolite A100, among which the MIL-53(Al) material had the best adsorption capacity, with optimal adsorption capacity and good selectivity [53]. Magnetic metal\u2013organic framework (MMOF) materials combine different MOF materials with various magnetic nanoparticles, adding magnetic properties to the advantages of MOF materials in terms of material selectivity, biocompatibility, ease of manipulation, and reproducibility. In combination with solid-phase extraction (SPE) technology, MMOF materials have been widely used in the pretreatment of complex matrices, such as pesticide and veterinary drug residues, toxins, food additives, and heavy-metal ions in foods. In the extraction of polyphenolic compounds and enrichment and separation of trace pollutants in edible oils, aflatoxin in vegetable oils was extracted by employing copper-based metal\u2013organic framework (Cu-BTC MOF)-derivatized porous materials as adsorbents, and the experiments showed that the C-Cu-BTC MOF materials not only removed more than 90% of AFB in edible oils within 30 min, but also had a lower level of AFB in the treated oils. Oil still has a low cytotoxicity, while the adsorption process has little effect on the quality of edible oil [54]. Therefore, MOF materials are characterized by high efficiency, safety, practicality and economy, and can be used as new potential adsorbents. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of porous crystalline pharmaceutical macromolecular materials that have been developed in recent years [55]. COFs have been used in the analysis of food contaminants due to their advantages of low density, large surface area, high safety, and ease of functional remediation [56]. The main applications of COF adsorbents in the analysis of food contaminants include the extraction of complex samples and the extraction of organic contaminants and heavy metal ions from food contaminants. Kang et al. [57] combined nano-optical sensors with near-infrared spectroscopy for the rapid detection and quantification of polyphenolic compounds and investigated the potential of chemoselective colorant-based nano-optical sensors for detecting the dynamic changes in aroma constituents during the fermentation of extracts, which demonstrated an improvement in the efficiency of polyphenolic compound detection at an ultrasound frequency of 28 kHz, a processing time of 24 min, and an ultrasound power density of 40 W/L. In magnetic porous organic frameworks (MPOFs) materials, due to the presence of pores, the physical and chemical properties of porous materials have been greatly enhanced, with the remarkable features of diverse synthesis methods, high physicochemical stability, strong magnetic responsiveness, easy separation, and excellent application performance in the extraction and enrichment of the target analytes for organic compounds (veterinary drugs, pesticides, endocrine disrupters, and other organic pollutants), heavy-metal ions and biomolecules, etc., which have a wide range of applications [58]. In recent years, although some breakthroughs have been made in food safety and detection with novel magnetic nanomaterials based on carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal\u2013organic frameworks, these materials are mainly used to achieve selective adsorption and efficient enrichment of trace analytes through hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. The commonly used assistive techniques include microwaveassisted extraction [59], ultrasound-assisted extraction [60], high-voltage pulsed electric field extraction [61], heated reflux extraction [62], and supercritical fluid extraction [63]. At present, the auxiliary technology has been developed from the laboratory to the industrial application; magnetic adsorbents will simplify the process of specimen pretreatment in the extraction of polyphenol compounds in edible oils, improve the recycling rate of the test, and have a certain significance for the further development of pretreatment materials.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 8 of 20"

            "text": "Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are the new generation of solvents made from renewable energy sources, unlike natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), which are solvents made from natural phytometabolites. DES are obtained by mixing and stirring the hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) at a specific temperature for a period of time with a certain molar ratio [67]. DES is an efficient, safe, low-cost and biodegradable green solvent with physicochemical properties such as a low melting point, higher relative density than water, low volatility at room temperature, nonflammability, and high viscosity. Not only that, DES can also be used in conjunction with magnetic nanomaterials to adsorb target analytes through hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 forces and electrostatic force specificity. Currently, DES have shown incredible capabilities in the extraction and separation of biologically active ingredients, residual drugs, metal ions and organics from complex matrices. In the preparation of DES, based on inexpensive or readily available ingredients, usually consisting of two or more substances, which include nontoxic quaternary ammonium hydrogen bond acceptors, such as choline chloride and betaine [17], and naturally derived uncharged hydrogen bond donors, such as amides, sugars, alcohols, and carboxylic acids [68] (as shown in Figure 3), DES is produced when the hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor are mixed in a certain molar ratio, and the DES is produced when the mixture has a eutectic point with a low melting point. Relative to ionic liquids, its physical and chemical properties are similar to those of ordinary ionic liquids, such as viscosity, electrical conductivity, density, surface tension, refractive index, and chemical inertness, etc. At the same time, DES has the advantages of being inexpensive, natural, of high purity, and safe for the environment, so DES is a green solvent that has the promise of being able to replace ionic liquids [69]. The main disadvantage of DES is that it has a high viscosity and density, which requires desorption of PCs from the resin during the extraction process with mobility, in which a large amount of volatile solvents are consumed [70]. DES was first reported by Abbott [71] in 2003, who successfully synthesized a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea at a molar ratio of 1:2, which was analyzed and showed physicochemical properties close to ionic liquids with good biodegradability and biocompatibility. Paradiso et al. [72] used glucose and lactose as the raw materials for the preparation of DES, and the 65 extra virgin olive oils. The DES extracts of phenolic compounds in the samples were subjected to spectrophotometric characterization and total phenol content, and methanol\u2013water solution extraction was used as a control combined\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 9 of 20\nwith analysis, and the spectrophotometric method was used to screen the total phenol content of vegetable oils. And DES has also been applied in rotating disk sorptive extraction (RDSE), which is considered as an effective sample preparation method, and a typical rotating disk is a polymer disk equipped with an adsorbent phase and a stirring magnetic bar. Andrey et al. [73] proposed a rotating disk sorptive extraction based on the mechanism of DES formation and used it for the extraction and separation of polyphenolic compounds in olive oil samples, and this method can significantly reduce the adsorption time and elution time, while various applications of DES and NADES for the extraction of polyphenolic compounds in edible oils are mentioned in Table 1, which shows that this material is a solvent with high solubilizing capacity and can be used as a green solvent for the extraction of a wide range of bioactive molecules. Thus, DES and NADES can be a viable method for the green extraction of polyphenolic compounds from edible oils. However, there is a lack of research on the theoretical mechanism of DES, microstructure analysis between substances, and extraction and separation mechanism. The physicochemical properties of substances are the basis of their application; therefore, emphasis should be placed on exploring the potential theoretical mechanisms of deep eutectic solvents and developing new deep eutectic solvents with special functions.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 20\nand separation of biologically active ingredients, residual drugs, metal ions and organics from complex matrices.

            "text": "Ionic liquids (ILs) [18] are new green solvents that replace conventional organic solvents, are low-temperature molten salts with virtually no vapor pressure, and are potential alternatives to conventional volatile organic solvents used for extraction. ILs are characterized by their chemical stability, high solubility, structural design, and high electrical conductivity. The physical and chemical properties of ILs are dependent on the nature and size of the cations and anions, which gives unique properties and, therefore, these reagents are also known as \u201cdesigner extractants\u201d [81]. ILs are mainly composed of organic cations (organic nitrogen-containing heterocycles) and a variety of anions, which are generally synthesized by direct synthesis and ion-exchange, etc., and are liquid at room temperature. As shown in Table 2, there are 2 main types of ILs [82]: the first type is divided into imidazole cations (e.g., 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium bromide), pyridine cations (e.g., N-butylpyridinium bromide), quaternary phosphine cations (e.g., tetrabutylphosphonium bromide), and quaternary ammonium cations (e.g., tetraethylammonium bromide), according to the structures of their cations; and the second type is divided into two types according to the structure of their anions: one type is halogenated salts and non-halogenated salts. Classical IL anions include bisimine (NTF2), trifluoromethyl sulfate (TFO), dicyanamide (N(CN)2), tetrafluoroborate (BF4), or hexafluorophosphate (PF6). And simple anions have also been found in less stable ILs or room-temperature nonliquids, including chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, perchlorate, formate and acetate [83]. Although there are many similarities between DES and ILs, there are significant differences in their structure, appearance, spectra and synthesis, where ILs are stabilized by the electrostatic attraction of anions and cations, whereas deep eutectic solvents are formed by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces between components [84]. In fact, ILs can be stabilized in most of the solvents, so the thermal and chemical stability of ILs is better than that of deep eutectic solvents.\nWalden et al. already reported an ethylamine nitrate ([EtNH3] [NO3]) with a melting point of 12 \u25e6C as early as 1914, which was the first organic salt to present a liquid state at room temperature and is also considered to be the earliest IL. Quaternary ammonium salt ILs can be referred to as room-temperature ionic liquids or room-temperature molten salts (RTILs) when they present a liquid state at or near room temperature [85]. Not only that, ILs can be easily immobilized on solid carriers by physical or chemical means (e.g., silica gel [86], polymers [87], and graphene oxide [88] as carriers), thus obtaining novel extraction materials with internally embedded ionic liquids or decorated on surfaces. In addition, ILs can be converted into ionic liquid immobilized composites by impregnation and grafting. The resulting composites are characterized by high enrichment efficiency, high adsorption capacity, good stability, and high extraction selectivity, as well as multiple ionic liquid recognition sites and high utilization [89]. In recent years, ILs have attracted the attention of scientists due to their unique physical and chemical properties and intermolecular\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 12 of 20\ninteractions, and they have been widely used as solid-phase extraction adsorbent materials for the separation of organic small molecules, as well as having a wider range of applications in the food field [90]. The application of ILs has been reported in the extraction and isolation of plant constituents such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, glycosides, alkaloids, aromatic compounds, and essential oils. Zhu et al. [91] used magnetic ionic liquids as microextraction solvents to prepare a new method for the extraction of two endocrine-disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A and bisphenol A, and 4-nonylphenol in vegetable oils, which was extracted by dispersive liquid\u2013liquid microextraction, and determined by ultra-highperformance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of two polyphenols in vegetable oils. Zhang et al. [92] prepared a novel three-dimensional ionic liquid-functionalized magnetic graphene oxide nanocomposite (3D-IL@mGO), which was used as an effective adsorbent for the magnetically dispersive solid-phase extraction of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in vegetable oils and analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The properties of the 3D-IL@mGO material were also characterized. It was demonstrated that the 3D-IL@mGO material had been functionalized by ionic liquids and exhibited high adsorption performance and good stability for the extraction of PAHs in vegetable oil samples."

            "text": "The supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) technique is an effective separation research technique, which has been rapidly developed and widely used in recent years [63]. The three-phase point of a substance is the coexistence of three forms, i.e., solid, liquid, and gas, at a specific temperature and pressure. The critical point is when the phase difference between solid, liquid and gas decreases as the temperature and pressure increase. At this critical point, the substance has the solubility and density of a liquid and behaves like a gas [93]. SCFE extracts biologically active substances from plants at atmospheric temperatures and prevents their thermal denaturation, which has attracted a lot of attention due to its simple design and construction. The most common solvents are hexane, pentane, toluene, nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride, However, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most widely used solvent because CO2 is the easiest and least costly solvent to remove, the critical point of CO2 exists at a critical temperature of 31 \u25e6C and a critical pressure of 74 bar, and, due to its supercritical properties, it is considered to be a promising solvent [94]. Subcritical fluid extraction (SFE) utilizes the two-phase change in the extraction solution at different temperatures and pressures to accomplish the process of edible oil extraction and extraction solvent removal. In the subcritical state, water, petroleum ether, n-butane, methanol, and ethanol are used to extract vegetable oils. Among them, subcritical water, with a critical temperature of 100\u2013374 \u25e6C and a critical pressure of 1\u201322.1 MPa, has become the most commonly used extractant because of its non-toxicity, low cost and high diffusion rate. Compared with traditional extraction techniques, SFE can shorten the extraction time, improve the quality of crude oil, reduce energy and solvent consumption, and increase the yield [95]. Supercritical CO2 (SCCO) is highly stable, non-corrosive, non-flammable, inexpensive, colorless and odorless, making it one of the ideal choices for isolation and purification in the food industry. SCCO\u2019s low polarity makes it unsuitable for extracting polar molecules, but it can be improved by adding polar-entraining agents (e.g., water, ethanol, etc.), and it is the \u201cideal\u201d green extraction solvent, and it has the advantages of non-toxicity, noncombustibility, and low cost, etc. It is widely used in the extraction of proteins, amino acids, and polyphenolic compounds in oilseed food materials, as well as fatty acids and polyphenolic compounds (Table 3). Fang et al. [96] explored the effect of different extraction methods (HPE, AEE, SE and SCCO) on the content of \u03b2-sitosterol, squalene and tocopherols in vegetable oils, and the results showed that the highest content of \u03b2-sitosterol, squalene and tocopherols was found in vegetable oils extracted using SCFE-CO2. Mohamed et al. [97] used the n-hexane extraction technique and the emerging SCCO extraction technique. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 13 of 20\nextraction efficiency of polyphenolic compounds from seed oil extraction red prickly pear was compared, and the polyphenolic compounds were identified and quantified by gas chromatography and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. The efficiency of SCCO extraction as a green process was demonstrated by the ability to identify 45 polyphenolic compounds and obtain a higher polyphenolic content using the SCCO extraction technique, although the same oil yield was obtained when compared to the n-hexane extraction technique. However, there are some drawbacks of SCCO while considering important parameters such as temperature, pressure, sample size, solvent addition, and flow rate control. Balancing each other plays a crucial role in designing highly sensitive processes with a high number of operating conditions [98]. Negative aspects aside, supercritical fluid extraction has shown positive signs when compared to other conventional techniques for the extraction of polyphenolic compounds.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 14 of 20\nThe development of SCFE technology overcomes the shortcomings of conventional extraction processes such as the toxicity of organic solvents, high energy consumption, and low extraction efficiency, etc. SCFE technology has a broad application prospect, and it needs to be studied in depth to find out its types, operating conditions, and technological costs, etc., and be improved with a view of achieving commercialization and use."

            "text": "Supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) are essentially colloids, which are discontinuous liquids composed of aggregates of amphiphilic compounds, and nanostructured liquids generated by two principles: assembly alone and coalescence phenomena [106]. Solo assembly is designed based on the structure of the desired molecule or its surroundings, while coalescence is based on the separation of the colloid into two fluid components. The equilibrium phase and the condensed phase, respectively, with the latter having a higher concentration of colloids than the former. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the application of SUPRAS through the extraction of biologically active compounds. SUPRAS not only has unique physicochemical properties, but it is also highly amphiphilic and at the same time adjusts the hydrophobicity of amphiphilic substances, among many other advantages. To date, the most commonly used amphiphilic reagents for the extraction of biologically active compounds are nonionic surfactants. In order to extract polyphenolic compounds more efficiently, SUPRAS tend to polymerize with amphiphilic groups whose polymerization involves both nonpolar and polar reactions. It has been found that amphiphilic molecules carrying the same charge react more strongly with opposite charges than with the same charge. Elevation of the temperature of the hydrocolloid solution or addition of water to the organocolloid solution can induce the formation of SUPRAS [107]. The composition and nanostructure of SUPRAS will greatly influence the amount and distribution of extracted bioactive compounds, and the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds is superior to that of conventional organic solvents. Keddar et al. [108] investigated the extraction of total carotenoids and polyphenolic compounds by using different SUPRAS compositions as lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants, respectively. It was demonstrated that lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants interact with each other in vivo through different mechanisms to maximize the total phenolic content extracted by using SUPRAS as extracts while optimizing the composition and extraction parameters of SUPRAS. Deep eutectic supramolecular polymers (DESPs) [109] are a new type of green extraction solvents, which are derivatives of DES. DESP not only possesses the properties of DES as a multifunctional medium, but is also a medium for the efficient extraction and stable storage of biologically active components. Shi et al. [110] prepared a DESP, which was composed of a supramolecular polymer \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) as the HBA and lactic acid (LA) as the HBD, in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w%), while ultrasound-assisted DESP extraction was used for the best extraction efficiency of polyphenolic compounds. Thus, SUPRAS can play an important role in the extraction of bioactives and the nature of SUPRAS allows them to replace conventional organic solvents in the extraction process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8150 15 of 20"
