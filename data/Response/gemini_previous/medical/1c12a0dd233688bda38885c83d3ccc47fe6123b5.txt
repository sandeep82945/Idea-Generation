1. **Investigate the role of NANOG and OCT4 in regulating other drug resistance mechanisms in GSCs.** The current study focused on the role of NANOG in regulating MGMT expression and the PI3K/AKT pathway. However, other drug resistance mechanisms may also be influenced by NANOG and OCT4. For example, these genes could regulate the expression of efflux pumps, which are proteins that can pump drugs out of cells, or they could alter the DNA repair machinery, making cells more resistant to the effects of chemotherapy.


2. **Explore the potential of combining NANOG and OCT4 suppression with other therapeutic approaches to target GSCs.** The current study demonstrated that suppressing NANOG or OCT4 expression can enhance the efficacy of TMZ in GSCs. However, it is possible that combining this approach with other therapeutic strategies could further improve outcomes. For example, combining NANOG and OCT4 suppression with targeted therapies that inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway or with immunotherapies that activate the immune system to target CSCs could be explored.


3. **Investigate the role of NANOG and OCT4 in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of GSCs.** NANOG and OCT4 are known to play crucial roles in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. It is possible that these genes also play a similar role in GSCs. Understanding how NANOG and OCT4 regulate these processes could provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for targeting GSCs. For example, inhibiting the self-renewal of GSCs could prevent the formation of new tumors, while promoting their differentiation could make them more susceptible to chemotherapy.


4. **Study the role of NANOG and OCT4 in the interaction between GSCs and the tumor microenvironment.** The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in supporting the growth and survival of cancer cells, including GSCs. NANOG and OCT4 could potentially influence the interaction between GSCs and the tumor microenvironment by regulating the expression of factors that promote angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels), invasion, and metastasis. Understanding these interactions could lead to the development of new therapies that target the tumor microenvironment and disrupt the support it provides to GSCs.


5. **Investigate the potential of targeting NANOG and OCT4 in other types of cancer.** NANOG and OCT4 are expressed in CSCs from various types of cancer, not just GBM. Therefore, it is possible that targeting these genes could be a potential therapeutic strategy for other cancers as well. Studies could be conducted to investigate the role of NANOG and OCT4 in CSCs from different cancer types and to explore the potential of using shRNA or other approaches to suppress their expression as a treatment strategy.
