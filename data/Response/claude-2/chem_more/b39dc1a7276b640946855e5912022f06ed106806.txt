 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Evaluate the performance of the ChemVis system through user studies with chemists and biomedical researchers. Gather feedback on the utility of the chemical entity extraction and visualization features.

2. Expand the chemical properties extracted and displayed in ChemVis beyond just molecular structure, formula, weight etc. For example, add physicochemical properties, bioactivity data, commercial availability. 

3. Integrate ChemVis into digital libraries and academic search engines to provide chemical entity aware recommendations to users directly on those platforms.

4. Apply similar chemical entity extraction and visualization techniques to patents and electronic lab notebooks to aid prior art search and experiment planning.

5. Build multimodal recommender systems that jointly analyze text, graphs, images and chemical data to generate more relevant paper suggestions tailored to chemists. The systems could account for reactions, synthetic pathways, spectroscopy data etc.
