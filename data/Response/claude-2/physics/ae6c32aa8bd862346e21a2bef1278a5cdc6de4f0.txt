 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effects of specific fatty acid compositions on membrane protein activities. The paper mentions that polyunsaturated fatty acids like DHA can influence membrane proteins by altering membrane properties, but more research is needed on how different fatty acid profiles impact specific proteins. 

2. Investigate the biosynthesis and functions of novel bioactive lipid mediators. The paper discusses known mediators like eicosanoids and docosanoids, but there may be other lipid metabolites with important signaling roles to discover.

3. Develop methods to modulate fatty acid desaturase activities. The paper highlights how desaturase enzymes play key roles in polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Finding ways to control their activities could allow regulating fatty acid profiles.

4. Study the impacts of dietary fatty acids across different species. The paper notes fatty acid metabolism can vary between species. More comparative research could reveal species-specific requirements and effects. 

5. Engineer custom lipid membranes with desired properties. The paper shows fatty acids strongly influence membrane traits like fluidity. Designing membranes with specific lipids could enable novel materials.
