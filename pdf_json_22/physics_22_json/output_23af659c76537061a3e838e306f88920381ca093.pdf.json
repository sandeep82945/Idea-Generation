    "abstractText": "Nonlinear optical effects such as four-wave mixing and generation of squeezed light are ubiquitous in optical devices and light sources. For new devices operating at low optical power, the resonant nonlinearity arising from the two-photon sensitive bound biexciton in a semiconductor microcavity is an interesting prospective platform. Due to the particularly strong Coulomb interaction in atomically thin semiconductors, these materials have strongly bound biexcitons and operate in the visible frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. To remove the strong pump laser from the generated light in optical devices or to simultaneously excite nondegenerate polaritons, a bichromatic-pump configuration with two spectrally separated pump lasers is desirable. In this paper, we theoretically investigate spontanous four-wave mixing and quadrature-squeezing in a bichromatically pumped atomically thin semiconductor microcavity. We explore two different configurations that support degenerate and non-degenerate scattering from polaritons into bound biexcitons, respectively. We find that these configurations lead to the generation strongly singleand two-mode quadrature-squeezed light.",

Denning,1 Andreas Knorr,1 Florian Katsch,1 and Marten Richter1 1Nichtlineare Optik und Quantenelektronik, Institut fu\u0308r Theoretische Physik,\nTechnische Universita\u0308t Berlin, 10623 Berlin, Germany (Dated: November 15, 2022)\nNonlinear optical effects such as four-wave mixing and generation of squeezed light are ubiquitous in optical devices and light sources. For new devices operating at low optical power, the resonant nonlinearity arising from the two-photon sensitive bound biexciton in a semiconductor microcavity is an interesting prospective platform. Due to the particularly strong Coulomb interaction in atomically thin semiconductors, these materials have strongly bound biexcitons and operate in the visible frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. To remove the strong pump laser from the generated light in optical devices or to simultaneously excite nondegenerate polaritons, a bichromatic-pump configuration with two spectrally separated pump lasers is desirable. In this paper, we theoretically investigate spontanous four-wave mixing and quadrature-squeezing in a bichromatically pumped atomically thin semiconductor microcavity. We explore two different configurations that support degenerate and non-degenerate scattering from polaritons into bound biexcitons, respectively. We find that these configurations lead to the generation strongly single- and two-mode quadrature-squeezed light.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nStrongly bound biexcitons in atomically thin semiconductor microcavities provide an avenue for low-power nonlinear optical devices, because the resonant scattering of unbound exciton-polaritons into a bound biexciton yields a powerful enhancement of the nonlinear optical response [1\u2013 3]. Previous analyses of degenerate four-wave mixing have shown that strong parametric gain from biexcitons [4, 5] can provide quadrature-squeezing with significantly lower power than when using conventional third-order nonlinear materials [6]. Thereby, atomically-thin semiconductors have a significant potential as a platform for nonlinear optics. In the interest of spectrally separating the pump photons from the generated signal, it is highly convenient to use a bichromaticpump scheme, where two non-degenerate pumps create a degenerate signal at the mean of the two pump photon energies [7\u201312]. In addition, such a bichromatic-pump setup allows to excite non-degenerate polaritons, which opens up a non-degenerate nonlinear scattering channel [13].\nFour-wave mixing in pump-probe experiments with semiconductors [14\u201320] and semiconductor microcavities [21, 22] is a heavily studied theoretical and experimental topic, and it was early recognized that the bound biexciton plays a paramount role in four-wave mixing. However, spontaneous four-wave mixing, also known as parametric flourescence or hyper-raman scattering, in semiconductors is far less studied [23, 24], despite being a central topic for quantum light sources with conventional nonlinear materials [25\u201328]. Fourwave mixing is a third-order nonlinear process that transforms two pump photons with frequencies \u03c91, \u03c92 to a pair of signal/idler photons with frequencies \u03c93, \u03c94. Stimulated fourwave mixing is facilitated by applying an idler laser field with frequency \u03c93, which will produce a signal at \u03c94 = \u03c91 +\u03c92\u2212 \u03c93 due to energy conservation. In contrast, in the absence of a stimulating idler field, spontaneous four-wave mixing produce a broad and continuous spectrum of photon pairs. This is the regime that is studied in this paper. Due to the pairwise\ncreation of photon pairs, the field properties of the generated light can exhibit strong non-classical correlation signatures in the form of quadrature squeezing, two-mode squeezing and photon-number correlations. In semiconductors, particularly in semiconductor microcavities with a strong light-matter interaction, spontaneous four-wave mixing can be mediated by the biexciton, which can break into a correlated pair of polaritons [see Fig. 1(a)\u2013(b)].\nIn this paper, we theoretically investigate spontaneous fourwave mixing in bichromatically pumped semiconductor microcavities with atomically-thin semiconductors. We investigate the spectrum and quadrature squeezing of the generated light and discuss how the cavity resonance and pump frequencies can be tuned in two configurations to facilitate efficient light generation and squeezing. Specifically, we investigate two configurations close to resonances, where four-wave mixing and squeezing is efficient. In the first configuration [Configuration A, cf. Fig. 1(c)], the cavity frequency is tuned such that the lower polariton (LP) energy E\u22120 matches half the bound biexciton energy 12 E xx b,\u2212. Here, the pump lasers should be nearly degenerate around the lower-polariton energy in order to efficiently excite LPs, which scatter via the Coulomb interaction into bound biexcitons through a degenerate polaritonic Feshbach resonance [1, 29]. A Feshbach resonance occurs when the energy of an open scattering channel (in this case a LP pair) matches the energy of a bound multiparticle complex (here a bound biexciton) [30]. The biexciton decays spontaneously into two degenerate LPs, which leads to single-mode squeezed light emission. In the second configuration [Configuration B, cf. Fig. 1(d)], the cavity frequency is tuned such that the sum of the LP and upper polariton (UP) energies E\u22120 +E + 0 matches the bound biexciton energy E xx b,\u2212, thereby giving rise to a non-degenerate polaritonic Feshbach resonance, also known as a polaritonic cross Feshbach resonance [13]. The driving field is resonant, when the two pump laser energies match the two polariton energies. An uncorrelated UP-LP pair can then resonantly scatter into a bound biexciton, which decays into a non-degenerate UP-LP pair ar X iv :2 20 7. 10 42 0v 2 [ co nd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n1 4\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2 (a) (b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFIG. 1. (a) Microcavity containing an atomically-thin semiconductor. The cavity is driven with bichromatic coherent laser light at frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92. Four-wave mixing due to nonlinearities in the optical response of the semiconductor creates an output photon pair with frequencies \u03c93 and \u03c94. (b) Diagrammatic illustration of biexcitonic four-wave mixing. The input photons (red and yelow wiggly arrows) create a pair of uncorrelated exciton-polaritons (single black lines). The two polaritons can scatter via the Coulomb interaction W\u2212b and create a bound biexciton (double line). The biexciton spontaneously breaks into a pair of polaritons via the Coulomb interaction W\u2212b , which are outcoupled from the cavity as photons (blue and green wiggly arrows). (c) Polariton energy bands (E\u00b1q , black lines) in Configuration A, where the cavity frequency is tuned in order to bring the lower polariton branch into Feshbach resonance with the bound biexciton (blue dotted line), 2E\u22120 = E xx b,\u2212. The driving frequencies are symmetrically centered around the lower polariton (orange and red arrows). The uncoupled cavity and exciton energy bands are shown with grey lines. (d) Similar to (c) for Configuration B, where the cavity frequency is tuned such that an upper-lower polariton pair matches the energy of a bound biexciton, E\u22120 +E + 0 = E xx b,\u2212, forming a non-degenerate Feshbach resonance. The driving frequencies are symmetrically centered around 12 E xx b,\u2212 with a resonance occurring when \u03c91 = E+0 , \u03c92 = E \u2212 0 .\nthat leads to the emission of two-mode squeezed light. In this context, two-mode quadrature-squeezing refers to a reduction of the quadrature noise in the cross-correlation between spectrally distinct frequency bands [31].\nFor the investigation, we employ a rigorous perturbative expansion of the electronic and photonic correlations up to third order in the driving field through the dynamics-controlled truncation (DCT) scheme [32, 33]. In order to calculate not only intracavity dynamics, but also the properties of the outcoupled and thus detectable field, we combine DCT with a Heisenberg-Langevin approach [6, 34]. Due to the presence of two non-degenerate pumps, the steady state of the system is not constant [35], but can be expressed as a discrete Fourier series. This series expansion complicates the solution of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion in frequency space compared to the case of a constant steady-state, which we solve through a discrete Fourier-index formalism.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the semiconductor model that is used for the electronic states in the semiconductor, the photonic states in the cavity and the external driving field. In Sec. III, the DCT and Heisenberg-Langevin methods are applied to calculate the dynamics, spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum and squeezing. In Sec. IV, we present and discuss the results for Configurations A and B. Finally, we conclude in Sec. V."

We assume the cavity to be rotationally symmetric in the plane, such that the cavity mode is polarizationdegenerate.\nThe semiconductor is described by electronic states in the conduction and valence bands with fermionic annihilation and creation operators c\u03b6 k, c \u2020 \u03b6 k for the conduction band and v\u03b6 k, v \u2020 \u03b6 k for the valence band. The index \u03b6 = (\u03be ,s) labels valley (\u03be ) and spin (s). We shall restrict our analysis to the lowest-energy optical transitions in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, which are located at the valleys \u03be =K and \u03be = K\u2032, respectively. Due to spin-orbit coupling, the lowestenergy transitions allow photons with right-hand (\u03c3 = R) or left-hand (\u03c3 = L) circular polarization to excite electron-hole pairs with spin-valley combinations \u03b6 = (K,\u2191) and \u03b6 = (K\u2032,\u2193 ). Due to this unambiguous relation between photon polar-\n3 ization and electron spin and valley, we can absorb photon polarization into the index \u03b6 and use the shorthand notation \u03b6 \u2208 {K,K\u2032} to denote all three degrees of freedom.\nThe total Hamiltonian H is divided into a noninteracting term H0 and a Coulomb interaction term HC, such that H = H0 + HC.

The third term accounts for the energy of cavity photons, Epk = h\u0304[\u03c9 2 p,0 + (ck/n\u0304)\n2]1/2, where \u03c9p,0 is the resonance frequency at k = 0, c is the speed of light and n\u0304 is the effective refractive index of the cavity mode [36, 37]. The last two terms describe electron-hole-photon coupling with strength\nAq = \u221a Ep0/E p qA0, which depends on the out-of-plane confinement of the cavity mode and the Bloch momentum matrix element of the semiconductor [38, 39].\nThe Coulomb interaction is given by [40]\nHC = 1 2 \u2211k1k2q \u2211 \u03b61\u03b62\nVq (\nc\u2020\u03b61,k1+qc \u2020 \u03b62,k2\u2212qc\u03b62,k2c\u03b61,k1\n+ v\u2020\u03b61,k1+qv \u2020 \u03b62,k2\u2212qv\u03b62,k2v\u03b61,k1 +2c \u2020 \u03b61,k1+q v\u2020\u03b62,k2\u2212qv\u03b62,k2c\u03b61,k1 ) .\n(2)\nHere, Vq = e20[2S\u03b50\u03b5qq] \u22121 is the screened 2D Coulomb potential, where e0 is the elementary charge, S is the quantization surface area, \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, and \u03b5q is the dielectric function for 2D semiconductors which is described in Appendix E. The inter- and intra-valley Coulomb exchange interaction has been neglected here, because in transitionmetal dichalcogenides it is significantly weaker [20, 40] than the direct interaction in Eq. (2). We note that the exchange interaction leads to effects such as biexciton fine structure [41] and a splitting of the exciton into branches with linear and quadratic dispersion [42] that coincide at zero center-of-mass momentum. While these effects are rich and interesting, we consider here only the physics of the dominating nonlinear response from the direct Coulomb interaction and leave the additional inclusion of exchange effects to more detailed future analyses."

            "text": "To calculate the time evolution of the system, we apply the DCT scheme [32, 33] to perturbatively expand the equations of motion for the coherent expectation values to third order in the driving field ain\u03b6 . The first step in this procedure is the Heisenberg equation of motion for a general operator Q, \u2212ih\u0304\u2202t \u3008Q\u3009= \u3008[H,Q]\u3009 (see Ref. 6 for the explicit derivation).\nThe Coulomb interaction and the fermionic commutation relations generate expectation values with an unequal number of conduction and valence band operators c\u03b6 ,k and v\u03b6 ,k, such as \u3008c\u2020\u03b6 ,k+qc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032\u2212qc\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032v\u03b6 ,k\u3009. Here, conduction-band electron densities c\u2020\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032\u2212qc\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032 are expressed perturbatively in terms of electron-hole pair operators using a unit-operator expansion [40, 45] c\u2020\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032\u2212qc\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032 = \u2211\u03b61k1 c \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032\u2212qv\u03b61,k1v \u2020 \u03b61,k1 c\u03b6 \u2032,k\u2032 + O[(ain)4], and similarly for valence-band hole densities. In this expansion, the Hilbert space has been restricted to pairs of conduction band electrons and valence band holes [40], which means that the effects of unpaired electrons or holes have not been accounted for. In this paper, this assumption is valid, because the only source of carriers is optical excitation through the driving field, which creates electrons and holes in pairs. However, in the presence of unpaired electrons or holes\n4 through e.g. n- or p-doping, which we do not consider in this paper, the pair expansion is no longer valid.\nWithin the DCT scheme, the third-order perturbative expansion corresponds to only keeping terms with up to three normal-ordered electron-hole pair or cavity photon operators [46], since the number of pair or photon operators corresponds to the order in the driving field. Such a perturbative expansion is possible because all correlations have their origin in the action of the external driving field [32, 33]. Furthermore, in the coherent-response limit, which is considered here, the third-order expectation values are systematically factorized as \u2329 c\u2020vc\u2020vv\u2020c \u232a = \u2329 c\u2020vc\u2020v \u232a \u3008v\u2020c\u3009 and \u2329 a\u2020c\u2020vv\u2020c \u232a =\u2329\na\u2020c\u2020v \u232a \u3008v\u2020c\u3009. This third-order factorization is exact in the coherent regime [46], i.e. when the only source of electrons and holes is excitation with coherent light near the resonances of the system, and when incoherent scattering processes e.g. via phonons can be neglected. Phonon scattering is later included phenomenologically through an exciton dephasing rate, which is obtained from a separate self-consistent microscopic calculation [47]. This means that the validity of our approach is limited to the regime where cavity outcoupling (\u03b3p) dominates over exciton dephasing (\u03b3x), such that polaritons will be outcoupled before significant dephasing and scattering takes place. In practise, this limits the theory to the low-temperature limit, where phonon dephasing is slow. For the calculations presented in this paper, the temperature is 30 K, which yields a phonon-induced dephasing rate below 1 meV, while the cavity outcoupling is 9 meV, consistent with fabricated dielectric microcavities with transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers [48]. Thus, there is a separation between these two time scales by an order of magnitude.\nThe electron-hole are expanded on the complete set of excitonic eigenstates as \u3008c\u2020\u03b6 kv\u03b6 k\u2032\u3009= \u2211i \u03c6 i\u2217\u03b2k+\u03b1k\u2032 \u3008P i\u2020 \u03b6 ,k\u2212k\u2032\u3009, where \u03c6 ik is the ith exciton wavefunction (solution to the Wannier equation) in momentum space with zero-momentum energy Exi,0 and P i\u2020 \u03b6 ,q is the creation operator of the corresponding exciton with center-of-mass momentum q, and \u03b1 = me/(me+mh) and \u03b2 = mh/(me +mh). We restrict the analysis to the lowestenergy (i = 1s) exciton, which is energetically separated from the next excitonic state by hundreds of meV for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides [49, 50] and we shall thus drop the index i from here onwards, meaning that the electronic states are projected onto the lowest exciton wavefunction. This is valid, when the excitation energy is far away from any of the neighbouring exciton states. In practise, the projection of electronic states onto the lowest-energy exciton wavefunction ensures an efficient numerical evaluation of the dynamics and exciton-exciton scattering coefficients.\nTwo-photon expectation values are partitioned into factorized parts and correlations, defined as D\u03b6 \u03b6\n\u2032 q := \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,qa \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,\u2212q\u3009\u2212\n\u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,q\u3009 \u3008a \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,\u2212q\u3009. Three-particle photon-electron-hole correlations are defined as \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,qc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2212\u03b1qv\u03b6 \u2032,k+\u03b2q\u3009 c = \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,qc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2212\u03b1qv\u03b6 \u2032,k+\u03b2q\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a \u2020 \u03b6 ,q\u3009\u3008c \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2212\u03b1qv\u03b6 \u2032,k+\u03b2q\u3009, i.e. with the contribution that can be factorized in electronhole pairs and photons subtracted. These correlations are projected onto the exciton wavefunction as\nC\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032\nq := \u2211k \u03c6k \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,qc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,k\u2212\u03b1qv\u03b6 \u2032,k+\u03b2q\u3009 c. The four-particle correlations of two electron-hole pairs have a more complicated structure due to the two possible electron-hole pairings: \u3008c\u2020\u03b6 k+qv\u03b6 kc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u2212qv\u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u3009 c := \u3008c\u2020\u03b6 k+qv\u03b6 kc \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u2212qv\u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u3009 \u2212 \u3008c\u2020\u03b6 k+qv\u03b6 k\u3009\u3008c \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u2212qv\u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u3009+ \u3008c \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u2212qv\u03b6 k\u3009\u3008c \u2020 \u03b6 k+qv\u03b6 \u2032k\u2032\u3009.

To alleviate this momentum offdiagonal coupling and thereby simplify the structure of the equations of motion, the biexcitonic correlations are expanded on the biexcitonic wavefunctions \u03a6\u00b1\u00b5,q, which are the solutions to an effective two-exciton Schro\u0308dinger equation [20] with corresponding energies Exx\u00b5,\u00b1 (see Appendix A for details). Bound (\u00b5 = b, Exxb,\u2212 < 2E x 0 ) and unbound (E xx \u00b5,\u2212 > 2Ex0 ) solutions exist in the singlet channel, where the effective exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction is attractive. The triplet channel supports only unbound solutions [52], because the effective interaction is repulsive. The unbound solutions constitute a two-exciton scattering continuum. In this biexcitonic eigenbasis, the correlations are expressed as B\u0303\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q,\u00b1 = \u2211\u00b5 \u03a6\u00b1\u00b5qB\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1.\nAt the level of the equations of motion, we phenomenologically include phonon-induced broadening of the exciton and biexciton by introducing complex-valued energies in the equations of motion: E\u0303xq = E x q + ih\u0304\u03b3x, E\u0303xx\u00b5,\u00b1 = Exx\u00b5,\u00b1+ 2ih\u0304\u03b3x. The broadening \u03b3x is calculated through a microscopic, selfconsistent approach for the phonon interaction as in Refs. 47, 53\u201356. We approximate the biexcitonic broadening as twice the exciton broadening [57\u201359].\nSimilarly, photon outcoupling from the cavity is included in the complex cavity frequency E\u0303pq = E p q + ih\u0304\u03b3p.\nThe equations of motion of the photon and exciton amplitudes and the three types of correlations as described above form a closed set within the third-order DCT scheme [46]. In a rotating reference frame with respect to the mean drive fre-\n5 quency \u03c9r = (\u03c91 +\u03c92)/2 the equations of motion are\n\u2212ih\u0304\u2202t \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009= (E\u0303 p 0 \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9r)\u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009+\u21260 \u3008P \u2020 \u03b6 ,0\u3009 + ih\u0304 \u221a\n2\u03b3p[\u3008ain\u2020\u03b6 \u30091 e \u2212i\u03c912t + \u3008ain\u2020\u03b6 \u30092 e +i\u03c912t ]\n\u2212ih\u0304\u2202t \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009= (E\u0303 x 0 \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9r)\u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009+\u21260 \u3008a \u2020 \u03b6 ,0\u3009\n\u2212\u2211 q\n\u2126\u0303q ( C\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q +\u03b4q,0 \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009 \u3008P \u2020 \u03b6 ,0\u3009 ) \u3008P\u03b6 ,0\u3009\n+W 0| \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009| 2 \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009+ \u2211 \u00b5\u03b6 \u2032\u00b1 W\u00b1\u00b5 B\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1 \u3008P\u03b6 \u2032,0\u3009 .\n\u2212ih\u0304\u2202tB\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1 = (E\u0303 xx \u00b5,\u00b1\u22122h\u0304\u03c9r)B\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1+ 1 2 (1\u00b1\u03b4\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032)\n\u00d7{W\u00b1\u00b5 \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009 \u3008P \u2020 \u03b6 \u2032,0\u3009+\u2211 q [\u2126\u00b1\u00b5,\u2212qC\u03b6 \u2032\u03b6 \u2212q +\u2126 \u00b1 \u00b5,qC\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q ]}\n\u2212ih\u0304\u2202tC\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q = (E\u0303 p q + E\u0303xq\u22122h\u0304\u03c9r)C\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q\n+\u2126qD\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q \u2212 1 2 \u03b4\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032\u2126\u0303q \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009 2 +\u2211 \u00b5\u00b1 \u2126\u00b1\u00b5,qB\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1\n\u2212ih\u0304\u2202tD\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q = 2(E\u0303 p q\u2212 h\u0304\u03c9r)D\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q +\u2126qC\u03b6 \u2032\u03b6 \u2212q +\u2126\u2212qC\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q .\n(5)\nThe full details of the derivation can be found in Ref. 6, but for completeness, all quantities are defined in Appendix A. In each equation, the first term on the right-hand side describes free evolution, and the remaining terms describe couplings or driving. For the photon amplitude \u3008a\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009, the second term is the linear vacuum-Rabi coupling to the exciton with coupling strength \u21260 (where 2\u21260 is the vacuum Rabi splitting). The last term is input-field driving, where in the rotating frame, the two pumps rotate with \u00b1\u03c912, with the difference frequency \u03c912 := (\u03c92\u2212\u03c91)/2.\nFor \u3008P\u2020\u03b6 ,0\u3009, the second term describes vacuum Rabi coupling. The third term arises from the fermionic substructure of excitons and generates nonlinear saturation of the light-matter interaction due to Pauli blocking \u2126\u0303q. The last two terms describe Coulomb exciton-exciton interactions at the mean-field level (W 0) and Coulomb-induced interactions with the biexcitonic correlations (W\u00b1\u00b5 ) beyond mean-field.\nFor the biexcitonic correlations B\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032\n\u00b5,\u00b1, the second term contains Coulomb-scattering of uncorrelated excitons (W\u00b1\u00b5 ) and coupling to exciton-photon correlations through the lightmatter interaction (\u2126\u00b1\u00b5,q). For the exciton-photon correlations C\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q , the second term describes linear coupling to two-photon correlations by exchanging an exciton with a photon (\u21260). The third term describes a nonlinear scattering of two uncorrelated excitons (\u2126\u0303q), and the last term describes coupling to biexcitonic correlations via optical fields (\u2126\u00b1\u00b5,q). The second and third terms in the equation of motion for the two-photon correlations D\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q describe coupling to exciton-photon correlations by exchanging a photon with an exciton through the light-matter coupling \u21260."

            "text": "With the equations of motion of the single-time expectation values as in Eq. (5), one can access the instantaneous quantum statistics in the steady state or in the transient evolution. This can in principle be used to calculate the intracavity squeezing or photon number. However, the relevant detectable quantity is not the intracavity field, but the outcoupled field. Since the cavity field at zero-momentum couples out of the cavity into a continuum of external radiation modes with different frequencies, outcoupled quantities are always described and often measured by a spectrum rather than a single number, in contrast to intracavity quantities, which can be expressed in terms of a single mode [44, 61].\nTo calculate the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum and quadrature squeezing of the generated light, we need not only the single-time expectation values as in Sec. III A, but also multitime averages. To calculate these, we employ a Heisenberg-Langevin approach for the time evolution of the fluctuation operator of the cavity field, \u03b4a\u2020\u03b6 ,0(t) = limt\u2192\u221e[a \u2020 \u03b6 ,0(t)\u2212 \u3008a \u2020 \u03b6 ,0(t)\u3009] and similarly for the exciton fluctuation operator \u03b4P\u2020\u03b6 ,0. Importantly, the cavity in/out-coupling and the phonon-induced dephasing give rise to Langevin noise sources [62]. For the cavity field, the Langevin noise enters directly from microscopic theory through the input-output formalism, as seen in Eq.

(6)). We then transform the fluctuation equations to Fourier space as \u03b4Q(\u03c9) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dt e\ni\u03c9t\u03b4Q(t), where \u03b4Q is any of the fluctuation operators. Terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (11) of the form \u03b4Q(t)Y (t) transform as \u2211m \u03b4Q(\u03c9\u2212n\u03c912)Ym, where Y is a steady-state expectation value and Ym is its discrete Fourier decomposition from Eq. (6). Thus, the fluctuation equations are not diagonal in frequency space, since \u03b4Q(\u03c9) is coupled to \u03b4Q(\u03c9 +n\u03c912) for n \u2208 Z.\nTo handle this challenge, we partition the frequency axis into zones of size \u03c912 and define the frequency \u03bd to be in the interval [\u2212\u03c912/2,\u03c912/2]. We then introduce the discrete Fourier-index notation \u03b4Qm(\u03bd) := \u03b4Q(\u03bd \u2212m\u03c912) [see Fig. 2(a)\u2013(b)]. Now the Heisenberg-Langevin equations are diagonal in \u03bd , i.e. \u03b4Qm(\u03bd) is not coupled to \u03b4Qm\u2032(\u03bd \u2032) with \u03bd \u2032 6= \u03bd , but only to \u03b4Qm\u2032(\u03bd). Instead, the frequency offdiagonal coupling in the fluctuation equations appears as a coupling between different Fourier indices [see Fig. 2(c)]. At the same time, we suppress the momentum-index 0 on \u03b4P and \u03b4a and use only the Fourier index, such that \u03b4P\u2020\u03b6 ,m(\u03bd) and \u03b4a\u2020\u03b6 ,m(\u03bd) implicitly refer to the zero-momentum exciton and cavity fluctuation operators.\nBy solving the frequency-space equations for \u03b4B\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 \u00b5,\u00b1, \u03b4C\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 q\nand \u03b4C\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032\nq formally (see Appendix B), they are eliminated and replaced by a renormalization of the equation for \u03b4P\u2020\u03b6 ,m(\u03c9).\n7 0 ... ...\n... ... 0 \u20131 1\n... ... ... ...\n(a)\n(b) (c) ...\n...\nFIG. 2. (a) Partitioning of the continuous frequency axis for the fluctuation operators \u03b4Q(\u03c9) into zones of width \u03c912. The continuous frequency \u03bd is defined to be in the interval \u03bd \u2208 [\u2212\u03c912/2,\u03c912/2], and the Fourier index m indicates the zone on the frequency axis, such that \u03b4Qm(\u03bd) := \u03b4Q(\u03c9 \u2212m\u03c912). (b) The frequency-axis partitioning can be illustrated as a stacking of the frequency zones, such that the continuous frequency \u03bd is on the horizontal axis and the discrete Fourier index m is on the vertical axis. (c) In this stacked representation, the dynamics of the Heisenberg-Langevin equation Eq. (11) only couples fluctuations that are on the same vertical line, i.e. the equations of motion are diagonal in \u03bd . The couplings of Eq.

The latter two stem from renormalisations due to the formal elimination of the multiparticle fluctuations and are given in Appendix B.

(15)\nThe parametric gain describes a coherent pairwise driving of the excitons, and is a purely a result of the nonlinearities in the system, specifically the Coulomb interaction and the Pauliblocking from the fermionic substructure of excitons. Moreover, without parametric gain, the generated field would have the same spectral and coherence properties as the classical input field. The parametric gain contains terms from the instantaneous Coulomb interaction between excitons (W 0), biexcitonic correlations (W\u00b1\u00b5 ) from the bound biexciton (\u00b5 = b) and two-exciton continuum (\u00b5 6= b), and Pauli-blocking \u2126\u0303q.

Due to elimination of the multiparticle fluctuations, additional second-order contributions are also present, which are given in Appendix B.\nThe formal solution of Eq.

We note that in practise, the renormalizations from formal elimination of the multiparticle fluctuations \u03b4B, \u03b4C and \u03b4D influence the numerical calculations presented in this paper only with small quantitative corrections. This means that in many cases, one can neglect \u03b4B and \u03b4C in Eq. (11), leading to the simplifications\n\u03a3mm \u2032\n\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 (\u03bd) = 0,\n\u2126\u0302mm \u2032\n\u03b6 \u03b6 \u20320(\u03bd) = \u21260\u03b4\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032\u03b4mm\u2032\nT mm \u2032 \u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 (\u03bd) = ih\u0304\u03b4mm\u2032\u03b4\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2032 diag[ \u221a 2\u03b3p, \u221a 2\u03b3x,\u2212 \u221a 2\u03b3p,\u2212 \u221a\n2\u03b3p]. (17)\nThis is demonstrated explicitly in Appendix D, where we compare the full calculation of fluctuation spectra with the calculation under the simplifications in Eq. (17). All calculations presented in the main text have been performed using the full\n8 contributions of Eq. (14). However, the negligible influence of multiparticle fluctuations supports the linearization of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, since products such as \u03b4C\u03b4P can be expected to have an even smaller effect than the terms linear in \u03b4C. This fact does not mean that many-body correlation effects are unimportant: indeed, the dominating contribution to the parametric gain stems from the bound biexciton, BKK\u2032b,\u2212 ."

            "text": "Quadrature squeezing is described through homodyne detection of the output field from the cavity (see Fig. 3). While the quadrature squeezing of the internal cavity mode can be evaluated simply as the variance of the quadrature operator \u03b4X(\u03b8) := ei\u03b8 \u03b4a\u2020 + e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b4a with respect to the quadrature phase \u03b8 , the outcoupled and thus measurable field quadrature fluctuations are more complicated [44, 63]. In homodyne detection, the source field from the cavity Es(t) = \u221a 2\u03b3pa(t) is mixed with a strong local oscillator Elo(t) on a beamsplitter, such that the fields leaving the beamsplitter E1 and E2 are given by [\nE1(t) E2(t)\n] =\n1\u221a 2 [ 1 i i 1 ][ Es(t) Elo(t) ] . (26)\n9 BS Det. 1\nDet. 2\nFIG. 3. Homodyne detection. The source field Es is mixed with a strong, coherent local oscillator field Elo on a 50/50 beamsplitter (BS). The outgoing field modes E1 and E2 are detected on detectors 1 and 2, which produces the photocurrents I1 and I2. The homodyne signal is the current difference I1\u2212I2.\nThe local oscillator has a frequency equal to the rotating frame frequency 12 (\u03c91 + \u03c92). Thus, when working in the rotating frame, the local oscillator expectation values are timeindependent: \u3008Elo(t)\u3009 = ei\u03d5 \u221a Flo, where Flo and \u03d5 are the photon flux and reference phase of the local oscillator, respectively, and the expectation value is evaluated in the rotating frame. Taking the local oscillator to be in a coherent state, we have \u3008E\u2020lo(t)Elo(t)\u3009= Flo. In the homodyne measurement process, the two output fields E1 and E2 are measured on separate photodetectors (which are labeled with corresponding indices 1 and 2) and the difference of these photocurrents are recorded as the signal.\nThe statistical properties of this photocurrent difference are derived using normal-ordered detection theory [63\u201367]. Here, we extend the derivation of Ref. 63 to the case of balanced homodyne detection and to bichromatic driving, where no time-independent stationary source field exists. The detection model is based on the assumption that a single photoelectric detection event produces a current pulse of duration \u03c4d and amplitude ge/\u03c4d, where e and g denote the electronic charge and photodetector gain, respectively. The photocurrents of detector \u00b5 = 1,2 is then given by [63, 65]\nI\u00b5(t) = ge \u03c4d n\u00b5 , (27)\nwhere n\u00b5 is a classical stochastic variable representing the number of overlapping pulses in the detection electronics of detector \u00b5 , i.e. the number of pulses initiated in the time interval t\u2212 \u03c4d to t. For practical purposes, we shall work with a scaled current, I\u00b5(t) := I\u00b5(t)/(ge), which has units of inverse time and represents the flux of detected photons.\nThe joint probability of detecting n1 photons in detector 1 and n2 in detector 2 within the time interval [t\u2212 \u03c4d, t] is given by [63, 65]\np(1)(n1,t\u2212 \u03c4d, t;n2, t\u2212 \u03c4d, t)\n= \u2329 : \u220f\n\u00b5=1,2\n[G\u00b5(t\u2212 \u03c4d, t)]n\u00b5 n\u00b5 ! e\u2212G\u00b5 (t\u2212\u03c4d,t) :\n\u232a , (28)\nwhere the generator G of the distribution is given by\nG\u00b5(t1, t2) = \u03b7 \u222b t2\nt1 dt E\u2020\u00b5(t)E\u00b5(t), (29)\nand \u03b7 is the detection efficiency.

The probability distribution Eq. (28) is essentially Mandel\u2019s counting formula, as presented in e.g. Ref. [44]. From p(1), the mean photocurrent is derived as [63]\nI\u00b5(t) = 1 \u03c4d\n\u2329 G\u00b5(t\u2212 \u03c4d, t) \u232a ,\n= \u03b7 \u03c4d \u222b t t\u2212\u03c4d dt \u2032 \u3008E\u2020\u00b5(t \u2032)E\u00b5(t \u2032)\u3009 (30)\nwhere we note that we use overlines to denote the mean value of the classical stochastic variable I\u00b5 and angular brackets to denote quantum-mechanical expectation values.\nSimilarly, the two-time probability of detecting n counts in detector \u00b5 in the time interval [t\u2212\u03c4d, t] and m counts in detector \u00b5 \u2032 in the time interval [t + \u03c4\u2212 \u03c4d, t + \u03c4] is given by [63]\np(2)\u00b5\u00b5 \u2032(n, t\u2212 \u03c4d, t;m, t + \u03c4\u2212 \u03c4d, t + \u03c4)\n= \u2329 : G\u00b5(t\u2212 \u03c4d, t)n\nn! e\u2212G\u00b5 (t\u2212\u03c4d,t)\n\u00d7 G\u00b5 \u2032(t + \u03c4\u2212 \u03c4d, t + \u03c4) m\nm! e\u2212G\u00b5 \u2032 (t+\u03c4\u2212\u03c4d,t+\u03c4) :\n\u232a . (31)\nFrom this probability, the detector current correlation function is found to be (for \u03c4 > 0)\nI\u00b5(t)I\u00b5 \u2032(t + \u03c4) =( 1 \u03c4d )2[\u2329 : G\u00b5(t\u2212 \u03c4d, t)G\u00b5 \u2032(t + \u03c4\u2212 \u03c4d, t + \u03c4) : \u232a +\u03b4\u00b5\u00b5 \u2032\u0398(\u03c4d\u2212 \u03c4) \u2329 G\u00b5(t + \u03c4\u2212 \u03c4d, t) \u232a] , (32)\nwhere \u0398 is the Heaviside function. The measured spectral noise function N(\u03c9) of the homodyne signal I\u2212 := I1 \u2212 I2 is then the Fourier transformation of the photocurrent fluctuation correlation function, averaged over one period of the signal oscillation T = 2\u03c0/|\u03c912| = 4\u03c0/|\u03c92\u2212\u03c91|:\nN(\u03c9,\u03b8) = lim t0\u2192\u221e 1 T \u222b t0+T t0 dt \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c4 cos(\u03c9\u03c4)\n\u00d7 [ I\u2212(t)I\u2212(t + \u03c4)\u2212 I\u2212(t) I\u2212(t + \u03c4) ] .\n(33)\nFrom Eqs.

The measured quadrature angle \u03b8 stems from the local oscillator phase \u03d5 and a phase displacement \u03c0/2 from the beamsplitter as seen in Eq. (26). The first term in Eq. (34) is the shot noise correlation function, which in the limit where the local oscillator is much stronger than the source field is given by\nN0(\u03c4) = \u03b7Flo \u03c42d (\u03c4d\u2212 \u03c4)\u0398(\u03c4d\u2212 \u03c4). (35)\nIn order to characterize the intrinsic noise properties of the source field and to disentangle these properties from the detector properties, we take the limit of infinite detection bandwidth (\u03c4d\u2192 0) and unity detection efficiency (\u03b7 = 1). In this limit, inserting Eq. (34) into Eq. (33) yields the noise spectrum relative to the shot-noise level (see Appendix C)\nN(\u03c9) N0(\u03c9) = 1+\u039b(\u03c9,\u03b8), (36)\nwhere N0(\u03c9) = \u222b \u221e\n0 d\u03c4 cos(\u03c9\u03c4)N0(\u03c4) is the shot noise spectrum and\n\u039b(\u03c9,\u03b8) = Re[\u039b1(\u03c9)+ e\u22122i\u03b8 \u039b2(\u03c9)], (37)\nwhere \u039bi(\u03c9) = 4 \u222b \u221e\n0 d\u03c4 cos(\u03c9\u03c4)Ci(\u03c4) and Ci(\u03c4) = 1 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 ei\u03c9\u03c4 2\u03b3pSi(\u03c9). All details of the derivation are given in Appendix C. The optimal quadrature angle, where the noise is minimized, is given by e\u22122i\u03b8 = \u2212\u039b2(\u03c9)/|\u039b2(\u03c9)|. At this angle, the spectrum of squeezing is\n\u039b(\u03c9) = Re[\u039b1(\u03c9)]\u2212|\u039b2(\u03c9)|, (38)\nwhere the homodyne phase \u03b8 has been suppressed in \u039b(\u03c9,\u03b8) for notational brevity. In the analysis of squeezing, we shall use the normalized optimal-angle spectrum 1+\u039b(\u03c9) to characterize the amount of squeezing in the generated light. This spectrum is normalized such that a value of 1 + \u039b(\u03c9) = 1 corresponds to the shot noise level, i.e. no squeezing at all, whereas a value of 1 + \u039b(\u03c9) = 0 corresponds to complete elimination of the shot noise and thus perfect squeezing.\nWe note that the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum SFWM(\u03c9) and the squeezing spectrum \u039b(\u03c9) are of fundamentally different nature and are measured with very different techniques. The spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum SFWM(\u03c9) can be detected by filtering out the bichromatic pump from the generated light and sending the filtered signal into an optical spectrum analyser. The frequency argument \u03c9 is connected to the emitted photon energy on the order of 2 eV.\nIn contrast, the squeezing spectrum \u039b(\u03c9) is measured through homodyne detection, i.e. by beating the generated signal with a local oscillator at frequency \u03c9r := (\u03c91 +\u03c92)/2. Here, the frequency argument \u03c9 is the beat frequency between the signal and the local oscillator, and is thus much smaller, on the order of a few meV."

In this section, we present these results for Configurations A and B, respectively, as shown in Fig 1(c)-(d). The numerical calculations become increasingly challenging as h\u0304\u03c912 := (\u03c92\u2212 \u03c91)/2 approaches 0, because the oscillation period becomes longer and longer. However, in the case where h\u0304\u03c912 = 0, the spectra SFWM(\u03c9) and \u039b(\u03c9) can be calculated using the simpler calculation methods for a monochromatic driving field described in Ref. 6. For completeness, we include the results for h\u0304\u03c912 = 0 in this way. The calculations are performed for atomically thin MoS2 encapsulated by hexagonal BN on both sides. The coupling strength of the cavity is taken to be \u21260 = 20 meV and the cavity outcoupling rate is taken to be h\u0304\u03b3p = 9 meV, consistent with fabricated devices [48, 68]. The temperature is taken to be 30 K, leading to a phonon-induced exciton dephasing of h\u0304\u03b3x = 0.8 meV (see Appendix E). The pump polarization is taken to be linear, with the two drives having the same linear polarization, and the pump power is 5 mW with a pump spot size of 9 \u00b5m2 . The detected polarization is taken to be co-linear with the drive, and we note that very similar results are seen for cross-polarized detection. Further details about the numerical calculations and all parameters are given in Appendix E."

            "text": "Configuration A is defined by setting the cavity frequency such that the lower polariton energy E\u22120 matches half the bound biexciton energy 12 E xx b,\u2212, and setting the mean value of the driving fields to 12 (h\u0304\u03c91 + h\u0304\u03c92) = E \u2212 0 = 1 2 E xx b,\u2212 [cf. Fig. 1(c)]. When the drive energy difference h\u0304\u03c912 is zero, the degenerate driving field resonantly creates lower polaritons, which resonantly scatter into bound biexcitons via the Coulomb interaction. The latter process is also known as a polaritonic Feshbach resonance [1, 2, 29] and gives a strong enhancement of the nonlinear response, which in this case leads to strong spontaneous four-wave mixing and singlemode squeezing. Since the in-scattering particles in this configuration (lower polaritons) are identical, this is a degenerate Feshbach resonance.\n11\nIn Fig. 4(a), the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum is shown for four values of the drive frequency difference h\u0304\u03c912. The spectra feature multiple peaks, which we can identify by considering the resonant four-wave mixing channels. Due to energy conservation the energy of a generated photon pair with frequencies \u03c93 and \u03c94 must match the sum of two pump photon energies. With two different pump frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92, there are three possible combinations of pump photon pairs, meaning that the output photon pair frequencies must fulfill one of the relations\n\u03c93 +\u03c94 = \u03c91 +\u03c92 (39a) \u03c93 +\u03c94 = 2\u03c91 (39b) \u03c93 +\u03c94 = 2\u03c92. (39c)\nThe resonant output channels appear where one of the output photon energies equals a polariton energy. Thus, by setting h\u0304\u03c93 = E\u00b10 , the resonance conditions Eq. (39) become\n\u03c94 = \u03c91 +\u03c92\u2212E\u00b10 /h\u0304 (40a) \u03c94 = 2\u03c91\u2212E\u00b10 /h\u0304 (40b) \u03c94 = 2\u03c92\u2212E\u00b10 /h\u0304. (40c)\nThese four-wave mixing resonance conditions give rise to a total of eight possible output photon frequencies (two values of \u03c93 and three values of \u03c94 for each of these). In Fig. 4(a), the resonances E\u00b10 and h\u0304\u03c91+ h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E\u00b10 are indicated with vertical grey lines. These resonance frequencies are independent of h\u0304\u03c912. The strongest (middle) resonance peak is the lower polariton energy E\u22120 , which in Configuration A matches the mean drive energy, 12 (h\u0304\u03c91 + h\u0304\u03c92). The corresponding photon\npair partner from Eq. (40a) has the same energy. The upper polariton resonance E+0 and its partner h\u0304\u03c91 + h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 are positioned symmetrically around the lower polariton. Since the excitation of the upper polariton is much further from resonance, these peaks appear with a much weaker amplitude than the central lower polariton peak.\nIn addition, the resonance condition in Eq. (40c) for the lower polariton, 2h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E\u22120 is also shown with vertical dotted lines. This resonance depends on h\u0304\u03c912 and becomes degenerate with E\u22120 in the limit h\u0304\u03c912 = 0.\nFor the largest value of h\u0304\u03c912, the resonance in Eq. (40c) is also shown for the upper polariton, i.e. 2h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 , with a dashed vertical line. This resonance cannot be seen for the other values of h\u0304\u03c912: when h\u0304\u03c912 is too small, the drive energies h\u0304\u03c91 and h\u0304\u03c92 are close to resonance with E\u22120 , but very far away from the upper polariton E+0 . When h\u0304\u03c912 matches the polariton splitting E+0 \u2212E\u22120 , as is approximately the case in the panel with h\u0304\u03c912 = 35 meV, the emission line h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 is degenerate with the dominating lower polariton E\u22120 . When h\u0304\u03c912 is larger, the drives are far away from resonance with the lower polariton, meaning that the dominating polaritonic features (as indicated with vertical gray lines) are diminished, thereby revealing the much weaker peak at h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 .\nFig. 4(b) shows the homodyne squeezing spectrum as 1+ \u039b(\u03c9). As discussed in Section III E 3, this spectrum is normalized such that a value of 1+\u039b(\u03c9) = 1 corresponds to no squeezing at all, whereas a value of 1+\u039b(\u03c9) = 0 corresponds perfect squeezing. Since the dominant emission channel in Configuration A is degenerate photon pairs at the lower polariton energy E\u22120 , the output field is single-mode squeezed, which is observed as a squeezing spectrum that is minimal\n12\n(providing the strongest squeezing) at zero frequency. The squeezing bandwidth is several meV, which stems from the typical scale of the resonance linewidths of the cavity photons, excitons and biexcitons in the system [69].\nFig. 4(c) shows the dependence of the squeezing at zero homodyne frequency as a function of the drive frequency difference h\u0304\u03c912. As expected for Configuration A, the squeezing is strongest in the degenerate limit h\u0304\u03c912 = 0, where both drives are resonant with the lower polariton. In addition, there is a weak resonance appearing at h\u0304\u03c912 = E+0 \u2212E\u22120 , where the drive frequency \u03c92 is resonant with the upper polariton. The resonance is weak, because the energy of two upper polaritons overshoot the bound biexciton energy, 2E+0 Exxb,\u2212. We note that the bichromatic-pump scheme can be utilised to generate strong single-mode squeezing. Since the width of the squeezing dip around h\u0304\u03c912 = 0 in Fig. 4(c) is several meV, one can choose a pump frequency difference of e.g. h\u0304\u03c912 = 100 \u00b5eV, which allows to filter out the pump lasers spectrally and still have strong single-mode squeezing over a bandwidth that exceeds the resolution of any standard photodetector.\nIn Fig. 4(d), the leading Fourier components m = 0 and m = 2 of the parametric gain \u2206m is shown as the sum of the absolute values of the spin-diagonal and spin off-diagonal components. The m = \u22122 component is simply the complex conjugate of m = 2, and the remaining components are negligible in comparison to the ones shown. The reason behind this is twofold: first, the contributions to the parametric gain are products of \u3008a\u2020\u3009 and \u2329 P\u2020 \u232a\nor quantities that are driven by such products, and therefore only contain even Fourier orders. The Fourier components with m larger than 2 are only driven by higher-order processes and are therefore strongly suppressed in comparison with the leading components. This observation corroborates the validity of the DCT perturbative expansion up to third order in the pump field. However, we can not be entirely certain that the contributions to next (5th) order are of a different nature and can introduce new effects. In addition to the total parameric gain, the contribution from the bound biexciton alone is also shown with dashed lines. As can be seen, this constitutes the dominating contribution to the parametric gain, and thus the other contributions in Eq. (15) from Pauli blocking and from the two-exciton scattering continuum are small corrections."

            "text": "Configuration B is defined by setting the cavity frequency such that E+0 +E \u2212 0 = E xx b,\u2212 (corresponding to E p 0 = E xx b,\u2212\u2212Ex0 ) and the mean driving frequency such that h\u0304\u03c91 + h\u0304\u03c92 = E+0 + E\u22120 = E xx b,\u2212 [see Fig. 1(d)]. Thus, we expect the driving to be resonant, when the drive frequency difference h\u0304\u03c912 = 1 2 (E + 0 \u2212E\u22120 ), such that h\u0304\u03c91 = E\u22120 and h\u0304\u03c92 = E+0 . In this case, the drive resonantly excites upper and lower polaritons, which scatter resonantly into bound biexcitons via the Coulomb interaction. The latter process is a non-degenerate polaritonic Feshbach resonance, because the in-scattering particles (upper and lower polaritons) are different with non-degenerate energies.\nFig. 5(a) shows the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectra for Configuration B at different drive-frequency differences h\u0304\u03c912. In contrast to Configuration A, the emission spectrum features two equally bright peaks from the upper and lower polariton, respectively. In terms of the four-wave mixing resonances introduced in Sec. IV A, these peaks correspond to Eq. (40a) with h\u0304\u03c93 = E+0 and thus h\u0304\u03c94 = h\u0304\u03c91 + h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 = E\u22120 . These two main emission energies are indicated with grey vertical lines in Fig. 5(a). In addition, the weaker four-wave mixing resonance from Eq. (40c) 2h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E\u22120 is indicated with vertical dotted lines. When the drive energy difference becomes larger, the power of the main emission peaks is weakened, whereby the additional four-wave mixing resonances 2h\u0304\u03c92\u2212E+0 and 2h\u0304\u03c91\u2212E+0 become visible as well (indicated with vertical dashed and dash-dotted lines, respectively).\nIn Fig. 5(b), the homodyne squeezing spectrum is shown. Here, the most remarkable difference from Configuration A is the appearance of maximal squeezing at the sideband frequency 12 (E + 0 \u2212E\u22120 ) rather than at zero homodyne frequency. This is because the non-degenerate Feshbach resonance creates two-mode squeezing, i.e. squeezing from the strong correlations between two different frequency bands. This is strongly related to the two equally strong peaks in the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum from Fig. 5(a) in contrast to Fig. 4(a), which features a single strong central peak. Although the detection of such high-frequency twomode squeezing is challenging in standard homodyne detection due to finite detection bandwidth, succesful detection can be carried out with bichromatic heterodyne detection, where the high-frequency sideband squeezing is mixed down to a low-frequency beat signal [70, 71].\nFig. 5(c) shows the squeezing at zero homodyne frequency (solid line) and at the optimal homodyne sideband frequency (dotted line) as a function of the drive energy difference h\u0304\u03c912. The optimal sideband frequency is close to 12 (E + 0 \u2212E\u22120 ), but due to small nonlinear shifts, we have taken the numerically optimal homodyne frequency. The behaviour shows a resonance around h\u0304\u03c912 = 12 (E + 0 \u2212E\u22120 ) (indicated with vertical line), where h\u0304\u03c91 = E\u22120 and h\u0304\u03c92 = E + 0 and polaritons are efficiently excited by the drive fields. This resonance is also seen in Fig. 5(d), where the parametric gain is shown as a function of the drive energy difference h\u0304\u03c912. Here, it is seen that the parametric gain is strongest around h\u0304\u03c912 = 12 (E + 0 \u2212E\u22120 ). Furthermore, as is the case for Configuration A, the bound biexciton (dashed lines) dominates the parametric gain in this configuration."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have presented a theoretical investigation of spontaneous four-wave mixing and squeezing in bichromatically pumped atomically-thin semiconductor cavity polaritonic systems, in particular focusing on the strong nonlinear response from the bound biexciton. By applying a rigorous truncation scheme of the many-body state, we have derived a tractable set of equations of motions for exciton and photon fields, as well as the correlated multiparticle fields. In addi-\n13\ntion, we have employed a Heisenberg-Langevin approach to calculate the fluctuation spectra in the presence of two nondegenerate pump laser fields. The combination of these two methods gives access to the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectra and the squeezing properties of the outcoupled field from the cavity in the presence of strong Coulomb-generated correlations. We have focused on two resonant configurations, corresponding to a degenerate and non-degenerate polaritonic Feshbach resonance, respectively. In the degenerate configuration, a pair of lower polaritons is resonant with the bound biexciton, thereby giving rise to a single dominating peak in the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum and strong single-mode squeezing. In the non-degenerate configuration, a upper and lower polariton pair is resonant with the bound biexciton, thereby giving rise to two balanced peaks in the spontaneous four-wave mixing spectrum and strong two-mode squeezing. We believe that these results will open new opportunities in the cross-field between semiconductor physics and nonlinear optics.\nAlthough the numerical calculations in this paper have been performed for an atomically-thin semiconductor, the overall features of the presented phenomena can be expected to be seen in other semiconductor materials with spectrally resolved biexcitons as well. We note that a previous experimental investigation [4] measured parametric gain from biexcitons in a bulk CuCl microcavity in the near-UV spectral range, although no homodyne detection was performed in the experiment. Furthermore, ZnO quantum wells with biexciton binding energies around 15 meV [72] are another interesting platform to potentially observe the predicted squeezing mecha-\nnism in the near-UV spectrum. Polariton Feshbach resonance has been observed in pump-probe experiments with InGaAs quantum wells [13, 29, 73]."

This corresponds to taking the limit of infinite detection bandwidth. Naturally, the detection bandwidth will restrict the observable homodyne spectrum, but in the interest of characterizing the intrinsic properties of the source field, \u03c4d \u2192 0 is the correct limit to consider. Since the integral over \u03c4 in Eq. (C6) only runs over positive values, this means that only the second Heaviside function in Eq. (C9) can be nonzero.

(C10)\nThe term in Eq. (C6) proportional to e2i\u03b8 can be connected to S\u22172(\u03c9) by following an analogous derivation. The final expression for the quadrature noise spectrum becomes\nN(\u03c9) = 1 2 \u03b7Flo sin2(\u03c9\u03c4d/2) (\u03c9\u03c4d/2)2\n{1+\u03b7 Re[\u039b1(\u03c9)+ e\u22122i\u03b8 \u039b2(\u03c9)]}, (C11)\nwhere the functions \u039bi(\u03c9) are defined below Eq.

            "text": "The numerical calculations in the paper have been performed for atomically thin MoS2 encapsulated with hexagonal BN on both sides, which is often used in experiments [see e.g. [74]]\nWe use the screened Coulomb potential obtained from solving Poison\u2019s equation for the van der Waals heterostructure: dielectric environment/air gap/atomically thin semiconductor/air gap/dielectric environment [41, 75]. The small interlayer air gaps hint take account of naturally occurring air gaps between the atomically thin semiconductor and its dielectric\n18\nenvironment [76] described by the dielectric constant \u03b5e.\nThe parameters used for the calculations in this paper are summarized in Table I.\nThe phonon-induced dephasing rate \u03b3x is calculated according to the methods given in Ref. [47], without self-consistent inclusion of radiative broadening, because this is contained in the interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field.\nIn the numerical representation of the equations of motion, the dynamical variables such as \u3008a\u2020\u3009 and \u3008P\u2020\u3009 are expressed in surface-density units \u3008a\u2020\u3009/ \u221a S and \u3008P\u2020\u3009/ \u221a S. This ensures that all coupling coefficients and scattering matrices in the equations of motion are independent of the quantization surface area S. Only the input-field driving term contains explicit reference to S, when converting the driving power Pin to surface-density units Pin\u2192Pin/S. For the numerical calculations, S is taken as the laser spot area (see Table I).\nIn the numerical representation of matrix elements and dynamical variables that depend on wavevectors, we exploit the rotational symmetry and express these quantities in their angle-averaged form as described in detail in Ref. 52. The complete set of exciton wavefunctions is calculated as the solutions to the angle-averaged Wannier equation (see Ref. 6 for details), which is solved in momentum space using a polar coordinate system with 4000 points in the radial direction and 4000 points in the angular direction. As discussed in Sec. III A, only the lowest-energy exciton state is kept, and the\nhigher-lying wave functions are discarded. To construct the matrix elements for the biexcitonic eigenvalue equation (the left-hand-side of of Eq. (A3)) the 2D wavevector-summations in Eq. (A2) must be evaluated for two 2D wave vectors, which presents a significant numerical challenge. Therefore integration in polar coordinates with Gaussian quadratures is used and the matrix elements are calculated for an adjusted, nonequidistant grid of 2D wave vectors, such that the point density is higher for smaller k-values and lower for larger k-values which are required for convergence. This leads to a matrix with a resolution of 100 k-points. Finally, a bicubic spline interpolation is applied to the resulting matrix to form a regular k-grid with 100\u00d7100 k-space points and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated.\nIn the evaluation of some of the matrix elements in Eq. (A1), GPU-based parallelization is used to accelerate the momentum summations using the pytorch library in Python. This makes the evaluation several orders of magnitude faster than a corresponding single-CPU evaluation.\nThe equations of motion Eq. (5) are solved using the DOP853 adaptive 8th order Runge-Kutta algorithm as implemented in the scipy.integrate library in Python. The matrix inversion required to solve the frequency-space Heisenberg-Langevin equation Eq. (13) is carried out using the Python library numpy.linalg. Specifically, the inversion of Eq. (14) is carried out simultaneously over the dimensions \u03b6 , m and the four vector dimensions of the fluctuation vector in Eq. (12).\n[1] M.
