    "abstractText": "Copper is a common metallic element that plays an extremely essential role in the physiological activities of living organisms. The slightest change in copper levels in the human body can trigger various diseases. Therefore, it is important to accurately and efficiently monitor copper ion levels in the human body. Recent studies have shown that fluorescent probes have obvious advantages in bioimaging and Cu2+ detection. Therefore, a novel Cu2+ probe (N2) was designed and synthesized from fluorescein, hydrazine hydrate and 5-p-nitrophenylfurfural that is sensitive to and can detect Cu2+ within 100 s. The response mechanism of the N2 probe to Cu2+ was studied by several methods such as Job\u2019s plots and MS analysis, which showed that the Cu2+ and the N2 probe were coordinated in a complexation ratio of 1:1. In addition, compared with other cations investigated in this study, the N2 probe showed excellent selectivity and sensitivity to Cu2+, exhibiting distinct fluorescence absorption at 525 nm. Furthermore, in the equivalent range of 0.1\u20131.5, there is a good linear relationship between Cu2+ concentration and fluorescence intensity, and the detection limit is 0.10 \u03bcM. It is worth mentioning that the reversible reaction between the N2 probe and Cu2+, as well as the good biocompatibility shown by the probe in bioimaging, make it a promising candidate for Cu2+ biosensor applications.",

            "text": "Copper is commonly found in various organisms and is one of the more abundant transition metals in the human body [1,2]. Compared with other transition metals, Cu has a strong stability constant of binding ligands, which makes it an ideal enzyme cofactor [3,4]. Cu can enter the human body in a variety of ways, such as through inhalation, diet and environmental intake [5]. According to some studies, Cu2+ solutions and metallic Cu can effectively inhibit the growth of viruses and even inactivate them [6,7]. However, for human body, systematic Cu content must be intermediate at a relatively fixed level [8]. Changes in Cu levels can contribute to anemia, coronary heart disease, Wilson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and can also trigger cell carcinogenesis and apoptosis [3,8\u201310]. Levels of Cu have been reported to be a sign of cancers, such as breast cancer, which can be measured by Cu2+ levels, and prostate tumor proliferation, which can be inhibited by reducing the uptake of Cu [11]. Therefore, accurate detection of the content of Cu2+ in organisms is required. Currently, Cu2+ is detected by atomic absorption spectrometry [12], inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry [13], electrochemical methods [14], etc. In these detection methods, it is indubitably necessary to involve advanced pretreatment processes and several large-scale instruments, which limit rapid detection in the wild and nondestructive functions of organisms [15\u201318]. Fluorescent probes have been widely used in the identification and measurement of Cu2+ due to their advantages of sensitivity, good biocompatibility,\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 301. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13030301 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 301 2 of 9\nsimple operation, and fast and specific recognition [19\u201325]. As a consequence, a series of fluorescent probes based on traditional fluorophores, such as coumarin, rhodamine and BODIPY, has been explored extensively [26\u201332]. Luciferin, a kind of optically stable fluorophore, has also been the subject of broad research [33\u201335]. It has been shown that amide-modified fluorescein derivatives with large metal ion coordination sites can be complexed with metal ions, resulting in changes in the fluorescence of the probe and successful applications in bioimaging [20,36\u201338].\nIn this study, we designed and synthesized a novel fluorescein derivative of Cu2+\nfluorescence, the N2 probe. It is worth noting that this probe has a unique ability to recognize Cu2+ in multi-ion coexistence solutions and shows a very intense fluorescence absorption peak at 525 nm, unlike other ions that are almost unchanged. Compared with other probes reported in the published literature [25,39\u201343], this probe has a relatively low detection limit and a stabilized fluorescence response at pH 6.0\u20139.0. In addition, through the discussion of the response mechanism between Cu2+ and the probe, it was revealed that Cu2+ enabled a certain reversibility of the recognition effect of the N2 probe by opening the lactam ring of the N2 probe and complexing with it in a 1:1 coordination ratio (Figure 1). Furthermore, cytotoxicity testing showed that the N2 probe has good biocompatibility. Bioimaging showed that N2 probe can be used as an intracellular Cu2+ tracer sensing material.\nBiosensors 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11 reducing the uptake of Cu [11].

It is apparent that the N2 probe has a relatively stable fluorescence response to Cu2+ in the pH range of 6.0 to 9.0. Hence, it can be adapted for bioimaging experiments at pH 7.4. The response times were examined at 525 nm (Figure 2B). After the addition of Cu2+ (20.0 \u00b5M), the fluorescence intensity at 525 nm intensified and reached a smoothed level after 100 s, which means that Cu2+ could be promptly detected by the N2 probe.

Analysis of data from ethylenediamine titration experiments and mass spectrometry also revealed that the probe complexes with Cu2+ in a 1:1 coordination ratio. Moreover, the probe achieves a reversible fluorescence response to Cu2+ via a switching ring, which provides a potential idea for the design of reusable probes.
