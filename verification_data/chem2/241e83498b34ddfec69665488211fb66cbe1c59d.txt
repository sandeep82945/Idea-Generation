"Theoretically, it is impossible to take into account all interactions occurring during ligands docking; there are indeed discrepancies between in silico docking and experimental results. A key to the actual tuning of receptor vs. ligand affinity is experimental studies with gas mixtures. Summarizing, the addition of the linker to the peptide’s structure provides more effective docking of volatile ligands; glycine-serine linkers provide the highest increase in affinity, which yielded an increase in biosensor’s sensitivity by ca. 15% with respect to the original peptide. The highest sensitivity values were also obtained for the GSGSGS linker: 0.3312, 0.4281, and 0.4676 Hz/ppm for pentanal, octanal, and nonanal, respectively. Generally, the dependence between the rigidity of a linker and the number of amino acid residues is much more pronounced than variations in a sequence. It was found that longer linkers had a better influence on docking effectiveness; the selection of the linkers with suitable length and sequence can constitute an additional aspect during the construction of more effective peptide-based biosensors for gas substances."
