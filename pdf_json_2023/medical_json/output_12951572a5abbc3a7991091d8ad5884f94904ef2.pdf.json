    "abstractText": "Optic nerve head (ONH) cupping is a clinical feature of glaucoma associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and lamina cribrosa (LC) fibrosis. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) occurs commonly in glaucoma, and is characterised by the loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) adjacent to the ONH. Under pro-fibrotic conditions, epithelial cells throughout the body can differentiate into fibroblast-like cells through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute to ECM fibrosis. This is investigated here in the context of glaucoma and PPA. Human-donor ONH sections were assessed for the presence of the RPE cell-specific marker RPE65 using immunofluorescence. We examined the EMT response of ARPE-19 cells to the following glaucoma-related stimuli: cyclic mechanical stretch, mechanical stiffness, transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). The gene expression was measured using the PCR of the epithelial tight junction marker zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the mesenchymal markers alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and vimentin. A scratch assay was used to assess the ARPE-19 migration. Significant RPE-65 staining was demonstrated in the glaucomatous ONH. The cyclic stretching and substrate stiffness of the ARPE-19 cells caused a significant decrease in ZO-1 (p = 0.04), and an increase in \u03b1SMA (p = 0.04). The scratch assays demonstrated increased migration of ARPE19 in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (p = 0.02). Furthermore, ARPE-19 cells undergo an EMT-like transition (gain of \u03b1SMA, loss of ZO-1 and increased migration) in response to glaucomatous stimuli. This suggests that during PPA, RPE cells have the potential to migrate into the ONH and differentiate into fibroblast-like cells, contributing to glaucomatous ONH cupping.",

            "text": "Glaucoma encompasses a group of optic neuropathies and is one the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment and blindness worldwide. It is characterised by optic nerve head (ONH) cupping and visual-field defects. In addition to ONH cupping, its features include the loss of the retinal ganglion cells and the thinning of the retinal-nerve-fiber layer (RNFL). Frequently in glaucoma, peripapillary atrophy (PPA) is observed. In this condition, there is a loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in a crescentic distribution around the ONH [1,2]. While this is also seen in some normal eyes, as well as in myopia, it is found more commonly and is larger in size in eyes with glaucomatous optic neuropathy [3,4]. Beta-zone atrophy (the sub-type most commonly associated with glaucoma) is characterised by bare sclera with exposed choroidal vessels, and Bruch\u2019s membrane is devoid of RPE [1,5]. The progression, conformation, and temporal changes in PPA correlate with the rate and\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 2737. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12072737 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 2737 2 of 11\nnature of progression of visual-field deterioration in glaucoma [2]. However, little is yet known about the aetiology of PPA or the fate of RPE cells during the process of PPA. As mentioned above, ONH cupping is a core characteristic of glaucoma. It occurs as changes in the lamina cribrosa (LC), the sieve-like meshwork of connective tissue that supports the optic-nerve axons as they leave the eye. The LC becomes compressed and bowed backwards [6]. This dynamic process of fibrotic change in the LC can be partly explained by a remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [7]. Optic-nerve-head astrocytes and LC cells have been implicated as mediators of the maladaptive changes in the collagen profile of the ONH [8,9]. Increased levels of pro-fibrotic cytokines, notably transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), have been implicated in ONH remodeling in glaucoma [10,11]. Work from our laboratory shows an upregulation of TGF\u03b2 global geneexpression analysis in glaucomatous human LC-cell explant cultures compared with normal samples, as well as an upregulation in genes with fibrogenic potential (e.g., collagen I) when normal LC cells are treated with TGF\u03b2 [9,12]. Mechanical cyclical stretching has been used successfully as an in vitro stimulus in LC cells and astrocytes, inducing ECM-gene-expression changes associated with the pathophysiology of cupping [13,14]. The process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated in a number of fibrotic disease states, including pulmonary fibrosis [15], renal fibrosis [16], and specifically in ophthalmology, the development of cataracts and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) [17\u201319]. The EMT involves a decreased expression of epithelial cell markers, such as Zona-Occludens 1 (ZO-1), the increased expression of the mesenchymal markers alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and vimentin, and the increased ability of cells to migrate [16,20]. The EMT can be induced by exposure to the pro-fibrotic growth factors TGF\u03b2 [16] and TNF\u03b1 [21] and by mechanical stress [15]. Furthermore, \u03b1SMA has been found to be upregulated in numerous in vitro studies when fibroblasts are treated with TGF\u03b2 and, subsequently, to adopt the myofibroblast migratory phenotype [22\u201324]. In addition, during the stimulation of epithelial cells grown on stiff substrates, simulating mechanical stress, EMT took place [16,20]. By no means is EMT a novel aspect of fibrosis. Importantly, with regards to RPE, this has been shown to occur in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) [18,19]. Retinal pigment epithelium cells were present in the contractile membranes of PVR, with a fibroblast-like phenotype, according to which the RPEs\u2019 intermediate filament profiles were altered [18]. The process of EMT has never been explored in the context of ONH cupping and the LC. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the potential involvement of RPE cells in LC fibrotic changes via the mechanism of EMT. The first objective of our study was to determine whether there was immunofluorescence-based evidence of RPE-cell expression in the glaucoma ONH. In parallel, we studied the in vitro responsiveness of RPE cells (ARPE19) in terms of EMT-like transition potential following exposure to cyclical stretching, biomechanical stiffness, and the cytokines TGF\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. We hypothesise that RPE cells contribute to LC fibrosis by undergoing EMT and migrating to the ONH in glaucoma."

The studies we conducted provide observation-based support for this hypothesis by demonstrating increased RPE-65 localised in the glaucomatous ONH and the capacity for cultured RPE cells to undergo EMT in vitro. Human normal and glaucomatous ONHs were examined for evidence of the RPEcell-associated visual-cycle protein RPE-65. The RPE-65 was retained in RPE-cell cultures shown to have undergone EMT, making it a reliable marker of this cell type [29]. Alongside the positive staining of the RPE in situ, there was increased positive staining within the glaucomatous ONH, as visualised by immunofluorescence. Anatomically, the junction between the intermediate tissue of Kuhnt and the border tissue of Elschnig may represent a route of migration for the RPE into the ONH [30]. This result was qualitative in nature and presents a novel finding, as there is no published evidence for the expression of RPE65 within the ONH. A further step in our research would be to quantify this difference. In order for RPE cells to play a part in the fibrotic cupping of the LC in glaucoma, EMT must occur. This involves the adoption of a migratory phenotype, a loss of epithelial markers, and a gain in mesenchymal markers [15,16,22\u201324]. This has been demonstrated in vitro in renal and pulmonary fibrosis using the same stimuli relevant to the ONH in glaucoma, namely TGF\u03b2 and cyclical stretch [15,16]. Renal tubular epithelial cells transition to a mesenchymal fibroblast-like phenotype through a number of steps: the loss of cell adhesion, actin reorganisation, basement-membrane disruption, and cell migration [16]. This transition has also been shown to occur in glaucoma, in which EMT takes place in Schelmm\u2019s canal and TM, which are essential anatomical sites for the drainage of aqueous humor and IOP regulation via glaucomatous stimuli [31,32]. Importantly, with regards to RPE, this has been shown to occur in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) [18,19]. Retinal pigment epithelium cells were present in the contractile membranes of PVR, with a fibroblast-like phenotype, according to which the RPEs\u2019 intermediate filament profiles were altered [18]. Therefore, RPE cells have the potential to contribute to pathological processes via EMT. To date, this has not been demonstrated in the LC of glaucomatous ONH. Our current in vitro study shows that epithelial marker ZO-1 is indeed upregulated in ARPE19 control samples and in ARPE19 soft substrate (4 kPa)-cultured cells prior to any introduction of glaucomatous stimuli. After the introduction of the known glaucomatous stimuli, TNF\u03b1, TGF\u03b2, 15% cyclical stretching, and increased stiffness (100 kPa), there is a clear change in the gene signatures of ARPE19 cells, with a significant loss of ZO-1 and the upregulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and \u03b1SMA. Through the EMT, we showed that the ARPE-19 adopted a migratory phenotype stimulated by TGF\u03b2 or TNF\u03b1, which caused similar degrees of wound closure on the scratch assay, a result that could not be attributed to increased cell proliferation, as shown in our proliferation assay. This is very interesting, as TGF\u03b2 levels are increased in the glaucomatous optic nerve [10], and TNF\u03b1 levels increased in the retina in glaucoma [11]. In summary, this work demonstrated evidence of RPE-cell protein within the ONH of human glaucoma donors. In parallel, the human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) was shown to undergo an EMT-like transition in response to glaucomatous stimuli. The cells were shown to have the altered phenotype of increased myofibroblastic gene expression, decreased epithelial gene expression, and enhanced migratory ability. With its consideration of the pathophysiology of glaucoma, our in vitro study suggests that RPE-cell EMT and consequent migration to the ONH may certainly contribute to the dynamic process of fibrotic change in the LC and add to the remodeling of the ECM. The application of this knowledge to the loss of RPE cells (i.e., beta zone PPA) in vivo in eyes with glaucoma may shed new light on the process of peripapillary atrophy.\nJ. Clin.
