    "abstractText": "In ridesharing platforms such as Uber and Lyft, it is observed that drivers sometimes collaboratively go o ine when the price is low, and then return after the price has risen due to the perceived lack of supply. This collective strategy leads to cyclic uctuations in prices and available drivers, resulting in poor reliability and social welfare. We study a continuous time, non-atomic model and prove that such online/o ine strategies may form a Nash equilibrium among drivers, but lead to a lower total driver payo if the market is su ciently dense. Further, we show how to set price oors that e ectively mitigate the emergence and impact of price cycles.",
