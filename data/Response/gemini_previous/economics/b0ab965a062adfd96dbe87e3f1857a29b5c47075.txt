1. **Investigate the relationship between the WEF Nexus Index and other development indicators.** This could include exploring the correlation between the WEF Nexus Index and indicators of poverty, inequality, and environmental sustainability. Such research would help to identify the specific ways in which the WEF nexus can contribute to broader development goals.


2. **Conduct case studies of countries that have successfully implemented WEF nexus approaches.** This research could identify the key factors that have contributed to success, as well as the challenges that were encountered. The findings from these case studies could then be used to inform the development of WEF nexus policies and programs in other countries.


3. **Develop new methods for assessing the WEF nexus.** The current WEF Nexus Index is a valuable tool, but it is limited by the availability of data. New methods for assessing the WEF nexus could be developed that are more comprehensive and that can be used in data-scarce contexts.


4. **Explore the potential for using the WEF nexus approach to address specific development challenges.** For example, the WEF nexus approach could be used to develop strategies for addressing food insecurity, water scarcity, and energy poverty. This research could help to identify the specific interventions that are needed to achieve these goals.


5. **Investigate the role of the WEF nexus in promoting sustainable development.** The WEF nexus approach has the potential to contribute to sustainable development by promoting the efficient use of resources, reducing environmental impacts, and improving human well-being. Research is needed to explore the specific ways in which the WEF nexus can contribute to sustainable development and to identify the policies and programs that are needed to support this.
