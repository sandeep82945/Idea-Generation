 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of other financial factors like corporate governance, ownership structure, and financial reporting quality on financing constraints and performance of logistics companies. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different financial factors influence logistics firms.

2. Conduct research on financing constraints and performance in other developing countries' logistics industries. This can reveal if the findings for China generalize to other emerging market contexts. 

3. Investigate how technological innovations like blockchain, AI, and big data could help alleviate financing constraints for logistics companies by improving transparency, efficiency, and information availability. 

4. Analyze the role of government policies and development initiatives in easing financing constraints and promoting growth of logistics companies in less developed regions. This can inform policymaking to support logistics firms.

5. Examine the relationship between knowledge stock and performance in more detail - how does knowledge get transformed and diffused within logistics firms? What organizational factors enable effective knowledge utilization? Answering this can provide insights into how logistics firms can better leverage knowledge for growth.
