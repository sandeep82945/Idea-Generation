    "abstractText": "An organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with MoS2 nanosheets modified on the gate electrode was proposed for glucose sensing. MoS2 nanosheets, which had excellent electrocatalytic performance, a large specific surface area, and more active sites, were prepared by liquid phase ultrasonic exfoliation to modify the gate electrode of OECT, resulting in a large improvement in the sensitivity of the glucose sensor. The detection limit of the device modified with MoS2 nanosheets is down to 100 nM, which is 1~2 orders of magnitude better than that of the device without nanomaterial modification. This result manifests not only a sensitive and selective method for the detection of glucose based on OECT but also an extended application of MoS2 nanosheets for other biomolecule sensing with high sensitivity.",

            "text": "Diabetes, a group of metabolic diseases fueled by the prevalence of obesity and an unhealthy lifestyle, has become a major cause of premature mortality or complication diseases including blindness, heart attacks, strokes, and numbness, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1\u20133]. Although there is no permanent cure for diabetes, timely glucose level monitoring and then appropriate medication have been regarded as effective methods to hinder complications and reduce the severity of the disease. So far, several types of biosensors have been developed to detect glucose, with the research direction moving from invasive to wearable [4\u20136]. Methods for glucose detection include those based on spectroscopy [7,8], colorimetry [9,10], electrochemistry [11\u201313], and so on. Electrochemical sensors, in particular, have drawn much attention because of their simple equipment, easy operation, fast response time, and high sensitivity. Yet due to working in a complex aqueous environment, the glucose sensor can be mired by humidity, pH, and other chemicals, leading to relatively poor sensitivity and selectivity. Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), a new branch of organic thin-film transistor, seems to overcome the constraints and show a promised sensing platform due to its stability in aqueous environment operation [14\u201317]. It not only combines the advantages of traditional electrochemical detection but also the signal amplification function, and thus has a very high sensitivity with a low detection limit. In addition, the superiority of low working voltage, good biocompatibility, easy fabrication, and potentially flexible form all make OECT an efficient application for biomolecules (such as ions [18,19], biomarkers [20,21],\nSensors 2023, 23, 7449. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177449 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7449 2 of 12\ncells [22,23]) and electrophysiology [24\u201326]. Therefore, OECT shows an ideal platform for highly sensitive glucose sensing, which is crucial to the diagnosis of diabetes. Most commercialized glucose sensors are based on a glucose-enzyme reaction, with their products detected by an amperometric electrode [27]. Thus, the mechanism of sensing in OECT involves boosting the process of the enzymatic reactions. For this purpose, the sensitivity and selectivity can be improved generally by increasing the surface area of the enzymatic electrooxidation reaction or promoting the catalytic activity of the enzyme, which ultimately accelerates the electron transport to the gate electrode and thus an electric signal change in the OECT device. For example, Macaya et al. [28] fabricated an enzymatic OECT with Pt wire, which was coiled to increase the reaction area, leading to a micromolar sensitivity within the clinical range of the glucose level in human saliva. Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Pt NPs, were also modified for the enzyme electrode to improve the sensitivity of OECT for glucose, owing to NPs\u2019 large specific area, excellent conductivity, and electrocatalytic properties [29,30]. Due to its fascinating structures (high specific surface area and nanosheet morphology) and electronic property (excellent electron mobility), two-dimensional material (2DM) has become a good candidate for electrode modification for OECT to promote the redox reaction and thereby improve the sensitivity and selectivity for glucose detection [31\u201333]. We anticipate that 2DM may be a potential strategy for modification of the OECT gate for glucose detection. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a metal sulfide two-dimensional nanomaterial, has attracted exuberant attention in the area of electrochemical biosensors due to its large surface area, tunable band gap, high electron mobility, excellent electrocatalytic properties, and ion-intercalation surface morphologies [34,35]. MoS2, with its graphene-like structure, has a high surface-to-volume ratio, and its superior layer spacing (0.65 nm) compared to graphene (0.34 nm) facilitates the probability of intercalation of a large number of small biomolecules [36]. The MoS2 obtained can promote redox transfer between the enzyme and the electrode surface. Moreover, there are catalytic active sites at the edge of the MoS2 nanometer lamellar structure [37], which can be used as an electrochemical catalyst for the chemical reactions between the enzyme and detected biomolecules, thereby improving the sensitivity and detection limit of the devices [38\u201340]. The satisfactory analytical properties evidence that the use of MoS2 modified on the reaction electrode holds great promise for detecting glucose of interest. However, the properties of MoS2 are susceptible to being affected by the preparation methods, resulting in slow progress in the application field of biological sensing. Therefore, to fully exploit the superiority of MoS2, the implementation of an optimal production method to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of biosensors is needed. In this paper, we report a kind of OECT-based glucose sensor in which MoS2 nanosheets were modified on the gate electrode for improving the sensitivity and detection limit. MoS2 nanosheets were exfoliated in different solvents for ease of surface functionalization and modification of the gate electrode of OECT. Nafion was also modified to facilitate the immobilization of MoS2 nanosheets and an enzyme (glucose oxidase, GOx). Nafion, a sulfonated copolymer enjoying good film-forming ability and susceptibility to chemical modifications that has been widely used as a support for enzyme immobilization, could be used to noncovalently associate with the modified materials on the gate electrode, leading to a high selectivity for the glucose sensor. Compared with a non-nanomaterials-modified device, the detection limit could be increased by 1~2 orders of magnitude with high selectivity. This work manifests that the OECT sensing platform holds great promise for sensitive detection of glucose and also indicates that MoS2 nanosheets have great potential in biosensing applications."

MoS2 nanosheets have excellent electrocatalytic performance and a large specific surface area, which can further improve the sensitivity of the device. In addition, unlike NPs and their colloidal dispersions suffering from aggregation or the high production cost of graphene, MoS2 nanosheets can be synthesized by liquid-phase ultrasonic exfoliation methods, which are cheaper and easier. Therefore, we explored the effects of different exfoliated solvents and sizes of MoS2 nanosheets on the detection performance of OECT glucose sensors. Table 1 shows the detection limit of the devices with\nSensors 2023, 23, 7449 7 of 12\nNafion-GOx/Pt and Nafion-MoS2-GOx/Pt gate electrodes, where the concentration of the modified Nafion solution on all gate electrodes is fixed at 1.5%. As can be seen, when MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated by aqueous alcohol were modified on the gate electrode, the device had the best detection performance with a detection limit of 0.25 \u00b5M. And the change in effective gate voltage was about 53.37 mV when the glucose concentration increased by an order of magnitude. Figure 4 shows the current response of the devices with MoS2 nanosheets stripped with different solvents to different concentrations of glucose. As shown in Figure 4c, there is a significant current response to 0.25 \u00b5M glucose. Compared with the device without MoS2 nanosheet modification, the detection limit is optimized from 5 \u00b5M to 0.25 \u00b5M, and the change of effective gate voltage is increased from 39.82 mV to 53.37 mV per decade, indicating that the sensitivity of the device with MoS2 nanosheet modified gate electrode is significantly improved.\nTable 1.

To optimize this condition, four different concentrations of Nafion solution (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) were used to modify the gate electrode, as shown in Table 2. Figure 5 shows the channel current response of the device modified with different concentrations of Nafion on the gate electrode. It can be seen that the OECT with Nafion (1%)- MoS2-GOx/Pt gate electrode reveals the best sensing performance, with glucose detection limits down to 100 nM, which are comparable to or even better than those of some other methods (LOD at the nM level). With a thinner or thicker Nafion layer on the electrode, the sensor demonstrates inferior performance in sensitivity. On one hand, the relatively thin Nafion film (0.5%) could have a poor effect on the immobilization of MoS2 nanosheets and the enzyme GOx, which may cause MoS2 nanosheets and GOx to fall off. On the other hand, a too-thick Nafion film (2%) would hinder the charge transfer to the electrode, thus leading to a weak redox reaction. Therefore, for the modification of the gate electrode in OECT, the optimal concentration of Nafion was 1%. We consider that the high sensitivity of the device with a Nafion-MoS2-GOx/Pt gate electrode can be attributed to the enhancement of reaction surface area and electrocatalysis and the fast electron transfer to the gate electrode. Firstly, a certain amount of NafionMoS2 hybrid was used for GOx enzyme immobilization, in which a small amount of Nafion-MoS2 hybrid may not result in sufficient immobilization and too much hybrid may lead to a thick film and prohibit glucose from reaching GOx. Then, MoS2 nanosheets have a large surface area for enzyme immobilization and fast mass transport due to the large interlayer distance of their ordered structure. The open structures of the Nafion-MoS2-GOx enzyme electrode made the enzyme electrode highly catalytic, strengthening the electrochemical reaction between GOx and glucose. At last, owing to the electrochemically catalytic activity of MoS2 nanosheets, the realization of fast electron transfer to the gate electrode is of great significance for sensitivity.\nFigure 4.

As shown in Figure S2 (supplementary materials), the ize of M S2 nanosheets exfoliated by aqueous alcohol is smaller than that of samples prepared by\nSensors 2023, 23, 7449 8 of 12\nother stripping solvents. It could be deduced that MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated by aqueous alcohol may have a larger specific surface area, which can increase the effective enzyme load on the gate electrode. In addition, the higher surface area of the thin MoS2 nanosheets would result in more active edge sites, which are crucial for excellent catalytic activity [37]. Overall, MoS2 nanosheets exfoliated by aqueous alcohol have a smaller size and thus more active sites exposed at the edges, which is conducive to increasing the catalytic reaction speed of glucose oxidase and thus improving the sensitivity of glucose detection. Therefore, for liquid-phase exfoliated methods, solvent selection plays an important role in the quality of MoS2 nanosheets. In addition, the concentration of Nafion solution is also very important to the sensor\u2019s performance. To optimize this condition, four different concentrations of Nafion solution (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) were used to modify the gate electrode, as shown in Table 2.
