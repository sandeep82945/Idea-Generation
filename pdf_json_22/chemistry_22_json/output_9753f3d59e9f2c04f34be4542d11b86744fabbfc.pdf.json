    "abstractText": "One of the most severe human health problems is gastric ulceration. The main aim of our study is to explore the gastroprotective effect of the Psidium guajava seeds extract (PGE). Metabolic profiling based on LC-HRMS for the extract led to the dereplication of 23 compounds (1\u201323). We carried out a gastric ulcer model induced by indomethacin in male albino rats in vivo and the extract of PGE was investigated at a dose of 300 mg/kg in comparison to cimetidine (100 mg/kg). Furthermore, the assessment of gastric mucosal lesions and histopathology investigation of gastric tissue was done. It has been proved that Psidium guajava seeds significantly decreased the ulcer index and protected the mucosa from lesions. The antiulcer effect of Psidium guajava seed extract, which has the power of reducing the ensuing inflammatory reactions, can counteract the inflammation induced by indomethacin by the downregulation of relative genes expression (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, PGE significantly downregulated the increased COX-2, TGF-\u03b2, and IGF-1 relative genes expression, confirming its beneficial effect in ulcer healing. Moreover, the possible PGE antioxidant potential was determined by in vitro assays using hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical scavenging and revealed high antioxidant potential. Additionally, on the putatively annotated metabolites, an in silico study was conducted, which emphasized the extract\u2019s antiulcer properties might be attributed to several sterols such as stigmasterol and campesterol. The present study provided evidence of Psidium guajava seeds considered as a potential natural gastroprotective agent.",

They are evergreen trees indigenous to subtropical and tropical climatic regions, it originated from Latin\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1230. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11071230 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 1230 2 of 14\nAmerica and was cultivated in many locations of Asia, Africa, and Europe [1]. The plant is an economically important crop cultivated for fruit production such as food and raw material in food industry [2,3]. Moreover, P. guajava has a wide range of medicinal applications [4]. P. guajava is a plentiful source of diverse secondary metabolites including phenolic acids (chlorogenic, ferulic and caffeic acids) [5], flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, and morin glycosides) [6], tannins (guavins A, B, C, D) [7], ellagitannins (casuarinin, flavonotannins; psidinins A, B, C) [8], Benzophenone glycosides (guavinoside B) [9,10]. Guava leaves and bark were assigned to treat gastrointestinal disorders; particularly diarrhea [11]. In the last decades, several studies were performed using the decocted or infused extracts of leaves, fruits, stems, and flower buds to study their different biological activities [12\u201319]. The anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, blood glucose lowering effect, antiviral and cough sedative activities are the key factors which labelled the guava fruit to be a perfect candidate to protect against COVID-19 infection especially for chronic diseased individuals [20]. Guava seeds (PGE) as a waste product of the commercially important fruit was evaluated as an inhibitor for the proliferation of the human erythroleukemic cells with low toxicity [21], the seed oil contains unsaturated fatty acids especially, linoleic acid and possessed a high antioxidant activity [22]. In addition to seed fatty acids, the seeds were found to be rich with proteopolysaccharides with potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [23], peptides from guava seeds were reported to perform antimicrobial effects against gram-negative bacteria [24], the phenolic content of the seeds extracted by supercritical fluid extraction performed a high antioxidant activity [25]. The anticorrosion potential of Psidium guajava seeds on carbon steel in an acid medium was reported as an ecofriendly application [26]. Guava seeds are considered a rich reservoir of variable potent phytochemical constitutes, so we investigated for the first time the gastroprotective and antioxidant of the Psidium Guajava seeds as well as their anti-inflammatory potential. Moreover, we carried out LC-MS analysis to reveal the chemical entities of Psidium guajava seeds. Finally, a docking study was carried within three different active sites, which includes the gastric proton pump, muscarinic receptors as well as H2 receptors."

Rats were fasted for 24 h before the test to guarantee an empty stomach. The animals were housed in standard cages with free access to water and food. The animals were acclimatized for seven days prior to the experiment start day, and all circumstances were designed to eliminate animal suffering. To eliminate differences owing to diurnal rhythms as possible regulators of stomach functions, all rats were used in the experiment at the same time of day [30,31]. The rats were separated into four groups: A, B, C and D, each of which had 6 rats. The normal control group, Group A received only the vehicle (0.5 percent CMC solution). Group B (positive control) was given the vehicle (0.5 percent CMC solution). Group C (market comparable reference group) was administered oral cimetidine (100 mg/kg p.o) (oral administration), whereas Group D was given guava seed extracts of 300 mg/kg p.o. (dissolved in a 0.5% CMC solution). After 1 h, groups B, C, and D received a single acute dosage of indomethacin (IND) (40 mg/kg) orally to induce gastric ulcers. All animals of the four groups were killed four hours after starting the experiment [32,33]. The stomach was cut and the larger curvature of the stomach was sliced apart. The stomachs were placed flat on a cork board after being washed under a steady stream of water. The ulcer index was obtained by counting the number of ulcer spots in the glandular region of the stomach in both control and drug-treated animals [30,34]."

Guava seed extract provided substantial protection against the ulcerogenic effects of indomethacin in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1). We carried out the study as follows: group A was a normal group that didn\u2019t have any ulcers, while group B (indomethacin) showed lesions that were hemorrhagic and shaped in a linear or dotted pattern. Furthermore, group C (cimetidine) showed mild lesions. Finally, group D (guava seed extract) had a similar number of ulcers to the normal group (Figure 2). Our results showed that the indomethacin group (group B) had a lesion index of (117.32\u00b1 23.3), while the cimetidine treated group (group C) had a lesion index of (2.0\u00b1 1.01) and preventive index of 98.2%.

Psidium guajava seed extracts\nsignificantly decreased the ulcer index and protected the mucosa from lesions. The\nantiulcer effect of Psidium guajava seed extract downregulated the cytokines expression\n(IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, PGE significantly downregulated the increased COX-\n2, TGF-\u03b2, and IGF-1 relative gene expressions, confirming its beneficial effect in ulcer\nhealing. Moreover, the identified compounds were also docked in the active sites of\nseveral inflammatory targets and mediators, which include COX-1, COX-2, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\n\u03b2, EGFR, and IGFR. The gastroprotective effect could be potentially attributed to the effect\nof several sterols such as stigmasterol and campesterol, as suggested by docking studies.\nOur experiment proved the possible use of Psidium guajava seeds as a protective agent\nagainst ulceration, and a possible alternative to antiulcer agents.
