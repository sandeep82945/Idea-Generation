    "abstractText": "Sanguinarine (1) is a natural product with significant pharmacological effects. However, the application of sanguinarine has been limited due to its toxic side effects and a lack of clarity regarding its molecular mechanisms. To reduce the toxic side effects of sanguinarine, its cyanide derivative (1a) was first designed and synthesized in our previous research. In this study, we confirmed that 1a presents lower toxicity than sanguinarine but shows comparable anti-leukemia activity. Further biological studies using RNA-seq, lentiviral transfection, Western blotting, and flow cytometry analysis first revealed that both compounds 1 and 1a inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of leukemic cells by regulating the transcription of c-MET and then suppressing downstream pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. Collectively, the data indicate that 1a, as a potential anti-leukemia lead compound regulating c-MET transcription, exhibits better safety than 1 while maintaining cytostatic activity through the same mechanism as 1.",

J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8113. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098113 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8113 2 of 14\nTo improve the cytostatic activity of 1 and reduce its toxic effects on normal cells, in our previous work we carried out structural modification and assessed the anti-leukemia activities of its derivatives [9]. We found that the activity of 1 was mainly dependent on the following structural features: the fusion of the B/C ring, hydroxylation patterns, N-methyl substitutions, and planar configuration [10]. Most notably, the cyanide derivative (1a) (Figure 1) showed comparable anti-leukemic activity and lower normal hepatic stellate cell cytotoxicity than 1; however, the molecular mechanisms of the anti-leukemic effect remain to be explored. According to previous research, 1 exerts its cytostatic effects mainly by inducing the apoptosis of tumor cells through regulatory proteins and signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [11], PI3K/AKT [12], JAK2/STAT3, and P53 pathways [13,14]. However, it is not clear how these signaling pathways and proteins are regulated by 1. Therefore, it is crucial to further explore the underlying anticancer mechanism or targets of 1. Upstream proteins such as c-MET, EGFR, and HER2 are involved in compound-1-mediated regulation of the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 signaling pathways [15\u201317]. The c-MET receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is the cell surface receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) encoded by the MET proto-oncogene [18]. It plays essential roles in controlling a number of critical cellular processes [19]. Aberrant activation of c-MET can lead to tumor progression, invasive growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapies, and plays a vital role in the treatment of tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma; therefore, c-MET has become a popular target for tumor treatment [20]. To date, there are no reports about the effect of 1 on c-MET. In this work, we investigated the effects of 1 and its derivative 1a on c-MET at the transcript and protein levels. This study might reveal a new antitumor mechanism and provide a solid theoretical basis for the development and utilization of 1 in tumor therapy."

At present, the treatment of leukemia is still a major challenge, and most of the drugs used clinically for the treatment of leukemia have various degrees of adverse effects [22]. There is an urgent need for effective lead compounds for the treatment of leukemia. Compound 1 is a natural product isolated from Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC with significant inhibitory activity against leukemia cells but obvious cytotoxicity against normal cells. To improve the cytostatic activity of 1 and reduce its toxic effects, a series of derivatives were synthesized (Figure S1), and the cytostatic activity of the derivatives including 1a was screened (Table S1). Notably, the cytostatic activity of 1a was comparable to that of 1 (Figure 2A), but 1a was less cytotoxic than 1 to normal LX-2 hepatic stellate cells (Figure 2B). To further investigate whether the molecular mechanisms of compound 1a were the same as those of the lead compound (compound 1), 0.75 \u00b5M, 1.50 \u00b5M, and 3.00 \u00b5M, and 1.00 \u00b5M, 2.00 \u00b5M, and 4.00 \u00b5M were separately selected as experimental concentrations for 1 and 1a."

            "text": "The induction of apoptosis is considered to be one of the major mechanisms of 1\u2032s inhibition of tumor cells [2]. To assess the effect of 1 on the apoptosis of HEL cells, cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 [23]. As shown in Figure 3A, the intensity of bright blue fluorescence was enhanced with increasing concentrations after treatment with 1 and 1a, and the fluorescence spots were evenly distributed. Compared with that of the blank control group, the fluorescence intensity of the treatment group was significantly higher. Meanwhile, TUNEL staining showed that treatment with 1 and 1a significantly induced cell apoptosis (Figure 3B) [24]. The above results demonstrate that both 1 and 1a could induce the apoptosis of HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner.\nInt. J. Mol.

HEL cells were treated with different concentrations of the compounds, and the staining results showed that the compounds increased the apoptosis rate of HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). Then, Western blotting was used to analyze the changes in apoptotic proteins after the treatment of HEL cells with the compounds [26]. The results showed that the compounds increased the levels of cl-PARP protein in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). PARP is a DNA repair enzyme that plays an important role in DNA damage repair and apoptosis, and PARP shearing is considered to be an important indicator of apoptosis [27]. Overall, these results clearly confirmed that 1 and 1a can induce HEL cell apoptosis.\nInt. J. Mol.

The MAPK signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched pathway in both 1-treated cells and 1a-treated cells vs. controls cells (Figure 4A). The MAPK family is a group of serine/threonine protein kinases that mediate intracellular signaling and are important trans itters of signals from the cell surface to the interior of the nucleus. The MAPK signaling pathway consists of three main MAPK subfamilies, including MAPK14, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK or SAPK), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK MAPK, Ras/Raf1/MEK/ERK).

(A) RNA-seq was performed in HEL cells pretreated with DMSO, 1 (3 \u00b5M), or 1a (4 \u00b5M), and KEGG enrichment analysis was used to analyze the most significantly enriched signaling pathways.

Western blotting results showed that treatment with 1 and 1a reduced p-MEK and p-ERK expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4B,C). These results revealed an antagonistic relationship between 1/1a and MAPK signaling in HEL cells. In addition, we found that both 1 and 1a significantly decreased the protein levels of c-MET, an upstream target protein of the MAPK signaling pathway [31]."

            "text": "c-MET is an upstream protein of the MAPK signaling pathway, and it has been reported in the literature that c-MET activates Ras through the GRB2-SOS complex [32], which in turn activates RAF and activates the downstream MAPK pathway. In addition, the binding of\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8113 7 of 14\nthe receptor c-MET to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activates several signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT, NF-\u03baB and STAT3/5 pathways [15]. Thus, the overexpression of HGF and the overactivation of c-MET play key roles in tumorigenesis [33]. Another study showed that there is high expression of c-MET and its sole ligand HGF in HEL cells [34], and in view of this, it is reasonable to suspect that in HEL cells, 1 and 1a induce apoptosis by mediating c-MET activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, we analyzed the protein expression of c-MET after compound treatment of HEL cells. The experiments showed that both 1 and 1a reduced the expression levels of c-MET protein in a timedependent and dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A,B). This suggests that the expression of c-MET was suppressed after treatment with the compounds, and the RNA-seq analysis also showed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, a downstream signaling pathway of c-MET, was one of the most significantly changed signaling pathways in cells treated with 1 or 1a vs. control cells (Figure 4A) [35]. We speculate that the alteration of the MAPK signaling pathway is likely to be mediated by c-MET. To test this hypothesis, we further validated the protein expression levels of the c-MET downstream pathway components PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3. As expected, the Western blotting results showed that both 1 and 1a reduced the protein expression levels of p-PI3K, p-mTOR, and p-STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5C,D). This result further confirms that the molecular mechanism by which 1 and 1a act on HEL cells may be mediated through c-MET.

            "text": "To confirm the mechanism by which the downstream signaling pathways MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 are mediated by 1 and 1a via c-MET, overexpression of c-MET was performed in HEL cells (Table S3, Figure S2) [36]. According to Western blotting validation experiments, the decrease in the protein levels of c-MET caused by treatment with 1 and 1a could be attenuated by MET transient transfection, indicating the essential role of MET in the antiproliferative activity of these compounds. This result was verified by assessment of the protein expression levels of p-MEK, p-ERK, p-mTOR, and p-STAT3, which are key targets in the downstream signaling pathway (Figure 6A,B). To further explore how c-MET protein expression levels were affected by 1 and 1a, we examined the mRNA expression levels of c- MET by RT q-PCR after compound treatment [37]. Intriguingly, c-MET mRNA levels in HEL cells were reduced in a dose-dependent manner with compound treatment, indicating that c-MET expression is subject to pretranscriptional regulation (Figure 6C); this indicates that c-MET and its downstream pathways are repressed, at least in part, through c-MET pretranscriptional regulation after treatment with 1 and 1a. These data indicated that in HEL cells, 1 and 1a exert their cytostatic effects at least in part by decreasing the mRNA and protein levels of c-MET and subsequently inhibiting the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 signaling pathways as shown in Figure 7. In this study, we found that both 1 and 1a effectively decreased the viability of HEL in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner, and 1 and 1a mainly decreased c-MET mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of its downstream signaling components MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, and STAT3 and subsequently inducing apoptosis. Our study clarified that the molecular mechanisms of compound 1a were the same as those of lead compound 1 and that c-MET was involved in the regulatory effects of 1 and 1a on signaling pathways, including the MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, and STAT3 pathways, which is a new antitumor mechanism of 1. This study provides a solid theoretical basis for the development and utilization of 1 in tumor therapy and provides more drug candidates for the treatment of leukemia and a theoretical basis for applying such treatments. Certainly, there are some limitations to this research. For example, the mechanism by which 1 and 1a decrease the mRNA level of c-MET needs to be further explored; this will be addressed in future studies.\nInt. J. Mol.
