            "text": "The oldest artificial object that remains in orbit is Vanguard 1, a scientific satellite launched in 1958. Having lost communications in 1964, the satellite has been derelict ever since, residing in an elliptical medium-Earth orbit. Lower-altitude objects, if left to their own devices, will spiral back towards the Earth\u2019s surface over time, owing to drag forces induced by gas molecules in the upper atmosphere. This effect acts as a \u2018natural sink\u2019 for satellites and orbital debris in the vicinity, though the impact on higher-altitude orbits is negligible (Klinkrad 2006). Indeed, Vanguard 1 is expected to remain in orbit for centuries.\nThe accumulation of defunct satellites and rocket bodies over the years has contributed to a steady rise in the number of orbiting objects tracked and\ncatalogued by surveillance networks. In Figure 1, the evolution of the most widely used public catalogue is shown, maintained by the US Space Command (USSPACECOM) with observations from the US Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a series of over 30 ground-based radars and optical telescopes across the globe, supported by several satellites in orbit.\nWhile abandoned objects make up a significant proportion of the debris littering the near-Earth environment, by far the most numerous contributions have stemmed from fragmentation events, or breakups, in orbit. The first of these took place in 1961, when a Thor-Ablestar upper stage exploded shortly after depositing its payload into orbit, producing close to 300 trackable fragments and more than trebling the catalogue at the time (Portree 1999). By the end of 2019, the number of confirmed fragmentation events to have taken place in orbit stood at 561 (ESA 2020). The most common cause of fragmentations has historically been the explosion of propulsion-related sub-systems (see\nFigure 2c) due to thermal stress. Explosions can also occur due to overcharging batteries and other electrical failures. Operators are now advised to \u2018passivate\u2019\ntheir spacecraft at the end of their mission lifetimes, meaning that residual fuel and other reservoirs of stored energy are to be dissipated prior to disposal. However, many old derelicts remain in an \u2018unpassivated\u2019 state, so explosions will likely continue to supplement the debris population for the foreseeable future.\nNot all break-ups have been the result of accidents. From the 1960s to the 1980s, the US and Soviet Union frequently demonstrated their anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities. The tens of tests that took place during this period, each generating a few hundred trackable fragments of debris, contributed appreciably to\nLooking o ut for a sust\nainable space Nearly 65 years on from the advent of human activity in space, James Blake charts the evolution of the orbital debris environment and reviews efforts to make operations more sustainable.\nAll Payloads Rocket bodies Fragmentation debris Mission-related objects\nCosmos-Iridium collision\nFengyun 1C ASAT test\nTowards LEO constellations Voluntary reductionUS-Soviet ASAT tests\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 Year\n20 000\n17 500\n15 000\n12 500\n10 000\n7 500\n5 000\n2 500\n0\nNu m\nbe r\n1 The temporal evolution of the USSPACECOM catalogue for objects larger than 10 cm in low Earth orbit (from Blake 2021, adapted from NASA ODPO)\n!\nTq\nq\nL\nT * *\n*\n* ,,\n\u201c\u201c go i\ni n\n? ?\n; o a\nr\nu k\nt\ni\no\ny >\ny\nh\nr\no\na\ns\nfy\nn\nf t\ne o r . . \u2018\n, .\n. .\n, . . . ,\n,\n,\n,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /astrogeo/article/63/2/2.14/6546993 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nA&G | April 2022 | Vol. 63 | academic.oup.com/astrogeo 2.15\nthe early growth of the catalogue (Tan et al. 1996, Portree 1999). Soviet ASAT tests would typically make use of an interceptor satellite that would detonate when proximate to the target, while the US were the first to deploy a so-called \u2018kinetic kill vehicle\u2019 (KKV), namely a homing projectile designed to destroy a satellite via kinetic impact (Tan & Reynolds 2019).\nThe years of frequent ASAT testing were followed by a two-decade international hiatus, as the major agencies united to try to tackle the orbital debris problem. Fortuitously, the efforts to reduce debris generation coincided with a solar maximum in 1989; the increased solar activity caused the atmospheric envelope to swell, increasing drag and accelerating the re-entry process for debris (Johnson 2010). This serendipitous combination resulted in a temporary net decrease in the number of objects being tracked (see Figure 1).\nIt did not take long, however, for the catalogue to resume growth. In 2007, undeterred by the hiatus that had held fast since the end of the Cold War era, China put into practice its own ASAT programme, culminating in the destruction of a defunct meteorological satellite: Fengyun 1C (Kelso 2007; Liou & Johnson 2009). Producing the most trackable fragments of any single event (see the step change in Figure 1), the test was widely condemned by the global community. Owing to the target\u2019s comparatively high altitude, the break-up produced a cloud of long-lasting debris in an already densely populated region; over half of the fragments catalogued remain in orbit (Lambert 2018).\nLooking o ut for a sust\nainable space\nPropulsion Anomalous Deliberate Aerodynamics\nAccidental Electrical Collision Unknown\nPL PL\nR/B R/B\nUI\nUI\nDEB\nDEB\nGSO Total: 4345\n8.219.9\n8.0\n63.9\n21.2\n6.0\n16.6 55.4\nm \u2264 10 kg 10 kg < m \u2264 100 kg\n100 kg < m \u2264 1000 kg m \u2265 1000 kg\nCo un t Co un t\nSh ar\ne %\nSh ar\ne % Co\nun t\nLEO Total: 17 355\nLEO\nLEO\nGSO\nGSO\nALL\n1970 1990 2010 1970 1990 2010\n1970 1990 2010\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2000 2005 2010 2015\n400\n200\n0\n40\n20\n0\n60\n30\n0\n100\n50\n0\n100\n50\n0Natural Success Insufficient\nYear\nNo attempt(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nDespite an apparent consensus that ASAT tests represent irresponsible and reckless behaviour, legally binding and internationally recognized regulations are still lacking. In 2019, India became the fourth nation to demonstrate ASAT capabilities, intercepting the Microsat-R satellite head-on with a KKV. The impact is thought to have induced additional on-board explosions, generating several hundred fragments, many of which were propelled into higher-altitude orbits that pose a threat to active satellites (Tan & Reynolds 2020; Oltrogge et al. 2019). Most recently, in November 2021, the Russian Federation destroyed a derelict spy satellite that launched in 1982. Some of the fragments in the resulting debris cloud pass through the orbital altitude of the International Space Station (ISS); indeed, the crew of seven at the time of the test were forced to prepare for emergency evacuation, while surveillance networks assessed the resulting debris field.\nAs the population densities of orbital regions with useful characteristics have increased over time, so too has the probability of collision in those regions. Only a handful of accidental collisions between trackable objects have taken place thus far, though near-miss events are becoming commonplace. In early 2020, for instance, the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) passed within an estimated 11 metres (courtesy: LeoLabs) of the Gravity Gradient Stabilization Experiment (GGSE-4), each decommissioned and orbiting in an uncontrolled state. The typical energies involved make this miss distance even more alarming; relative velocities in the low-Earth orbit region (LEO, nominally <2000 km altitude) often exceed 10 km/s, meaning that objects as small as 1 cm can cause mission-fatal damage.\n2(a) Number of objects penetrating the LEO and GSO regions by object type: payload (PL), rocket body (R/B), debris (DEB) or unidentified (UI). (b) Payload launch traffic into the LEO and GSO regions by mass. (c) Number of fragmentation events by diagnosis.

The collision was catastrophic, polluting the environment with over 2000 trackable fragments of debris, and likely thousands more that are too small to be detected by current surveillance networks (Wang 2010; AnzMeador et al. 2018). The Cosmos-Iridium collision took place in an already densely populated altitude band, hosting many of the sun-synchronous satellites carrying out Earth observation, reconnaissance, and weather monitoring. The fragments generated by the collision have consequently been responsible for a significant proportion of avoidance manoeuvres undertaken by active satellites since, including those of the ISS itself (NASA 2015; Braun et al. 2016).\nSeveral bands of the LEO region are already thought to be unstable, on the cusp of a collisional cascade, whereby collisions generate fragments of debris that go on to seed further collisions, which generate further debris, and so on. This scenario is commonly referred to as the Kessler Syndrome, after Don Kessler, the former NASA scientist who first proposed it (Kessler & Cour-Palais 1978). Interestingly, the 2013 film Gravity features a Kessler-like cascade seeded by fragments from a spy satellite, itself the target of a Russian ASAT test; it remains to be seen whether the 2021 test will trigger a similar chain of events, though the film should nevertheless serve as a humbling reminder of the potential ramifications of such irresponsible actions.\nChange, then, is clearly necessary. So what is currently being done to address the issue?"

            "text": "As is true for the US SSN, most space surveillance observations utilize radars or optical telescopes. Radars are best suited to monitoring the LEO region, as their sensitivity drops with the fourth power of the range (observer-to-target distance). The Royal Air Force Fylingdales radar station in North Yorkshire, for example, serves as a key element of the SSN, tracking objects out to an altitude of roughly 5500 km.\nHigh-altitude targets are typically monitored by optical telescopes, with the more favourable inverse square law governing their sensitivities. Groundbased Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) is the primary optical component of the SSN, a system of one-metre telescopes with sites in New Mexico, Hawaii, and the British Indian Ocean Territory. Combined with NASA\u2019s new MCAT facility on Ascension Island (Lederer et al. 2019), the sites are tactically chosen to monitor satellites in the geosynchronous (GSO) region, a ring of orbits (see\nFigure 3) roughly 36 000 km above the equator, where\ngeostationary satellites reside. These are some of the most valuable assets in space, massive buses (see right-hand panel, Figure 2b) occupying a limited number of longitudinal slots within the geostationary belt. Satellites in the belt have the unique property of matching the Earth\u2019s rotation, remaining (near-) fixed in an observer\u2019s sky and thus enabling simplified tracking using unidirectional ground-based antennas.\nDespite offering the best coverage of global space assets, the USSPACECOM catalogue is far from complete. The SSN can reliably track objects down to roughly 5-10 cm in size at LEO altitudes, and roughly 1 m when observing higher-altitude regions. These cut-offs are a major cause for concern, given that even millimetre-sized debris can prove disruptive in the hypervelocity regime of LEO. Indeed, ESA\u2019s Sentinel-1A\n3 (above) A snapshot of the near-Earth environment, showing the instantaneous location of all objects tracked by the SSN as of January 2019, from a vantage point above the North Pole. Points representing tracked objects are scaled for optimal visibility, not relative to the Earth. (From NASA ODPO)\n4 (inset) Sentinel-1A\u2019s solar array before and after the impact of a millimetre-size particle on the second panel. The damaged area has a diameter of about 40 cm, which is consistent on this structure with the impact of a fragment of less than 5 mm in size. (ESA)\nsatellite experienced an anomaly in 2016 that was attributed to a sub-centimetre impactor damaging a solar panel, causing a permanent partial power loss (see Figure 4). Too small to be registered by the SSN, the characteristics of the colliding fragment were belatedly inferred from images of the resulting crater, taken by an onboard camera (Krag et al. 2017). Even in the GSO region, recent simulations have suggested that objects less than 10 cm in size could cause mission-fatal damage, despite the comparatively low relative velocities involved (Oltrogge et al. 2018).\nWhile satellites and rocket bodies make up over 98% of the tracked mass in orbit (ESA 2020), the numerical abundance of small debris remains a critical concern. However, very little is known about the nature and extent of this elusive population. Bespoke (and thus sporadic) observations using large radars like MIT\u2019s Haystack, JPL\u2019s Goldstone, and others (Stansbery et al.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /astrogeo/article/63/2/2.14/6546993 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n2.17\n1995; Matney et al. 1999; Mehrholz et al. 2002; Stokely et al. 2009), have detected objects in LEO down to a few millimetres in size. In situ methods have been used to investigate the population of sub-millimetre LEO debris, by examining impact features on spacecraft such as the Long Duration Exposure Facility, Hubble Space Telescope, and Space Shuttle Orbiter (Love et al. 1995; Graham et al. 2001; Christiansen et al. 2004). Laboratorybased experiments have attempted to recreate hypervelocity impacts, allowing debris fragments to be studied and characterized (Cowardin et al. 2020).\nAll these sources of statistical information feed into environmental models that operators use to assess the risk posed by orbital debris. That said, even the most widely used models, NASA\u2019s ORDEM and ESA\u2019s MASTER, are known to differ significantly in their output (Krisko et al. 2015). Most notably, predicted flux densities disagree by more than an order of magnitude in the 1-3 mm bracket, currently an \u2018observational gap\u2019; too small to be detected by the most sensitive radars, yet too rare to have caused a statistically informative number of craters on surfaces that have been analyzed using in situ techniques. The MASTER model predicts there to be roughly one million objects larger than 1 cm in orbit, while ORDEM predicts a factor of two fewer. Both estimates nevertheless serve to highlight the inadequacies of current space surveillance catalogues.\nFigure 2a shows a breakdown of catalogued objects orbiting in both the LEO and GSO regions. A large proportion of objects intersecting the GSO region are \u2018unidentified\u2019, their nature and launch origin still unclear. There are several reasons for this: historically, the GSO region has received less attention from an orbital debris perspective, and it is likely that numerous anomalous events have taken place without any realtime follow-up; a substantial population of objects with high area-to-mass ratios (HAMRs) exists in the vicinity of the GSO region, having been highly perturbed by solar radiation pressure (SRP) and other poorly modelled forces, rendering it impossible so far to associate them with a launch (Kelecy & Jah 2011); the HAMR objects, likely shreds of blanketing material, typically reside in eccentric orbits, necessitating bespoke observational strategies which have only been employed in the past couple of decades (Frueh & Schildknecht 2012).\nRecent anomalies and break-ups involving satellites and rocket bodies have added to the relatively mysterious population of small debris in high-altitude orbits (Cunio et al. 2017; Schildknecht et al. 2019). In the past couple of decades, several surveys have looked to uncover these faint objects (Schildknecht 2007; Molotov et al. 2009; Blake et al. 2020, 2021), though cataloguing\nis rendered very difficult on account of the limited time available with the large aperture telescopes required. Indeed, the GSO debris population below roughly 10 cm in size remains unprobed by any technique.\nMost active satellites conduct regular \u2018stationkeeping\u2019 manoeuvres to maintain a desired behaviour, as natural perturbations resulting from gravitational asymmetries, atmospheric drag, SRP, and so on, can otherwise cause the spacecraft\u2019s attitude and orbit to evolve (Ziebart 2004). Observations of uncontrolled debris offer a chance to probe the effects of these perturbations and refine models for predicting attitudinal and orbital states (Papushev et al. 2009; Kudak et al. 2017). Several groups have acquired multi-colour photometric (Hejduk et al. 2012; Cardona et al. 2016; Zigo et al. 2019) and time-resolved spectroscopic (Jorgensen et al. 2004; B\u00e9dard et al. 2014; Vananti et al. 2017) measurements to probe the material properties of objects in orbit, a key consideration when modelling the effects of electroand geo-magnetic torques (Wetterer et al. 2014).\nMany of the small fragments detected in the GSO region have shown photometric signatures of rapid tumbling (see figure 5), potentially arising from the Yarkovsky-O\u2019Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect that is commonly used to explain the rotational dynamics of asteroids and small bodies (Bottke et al. 2006; Albuja et al. 2018). Light curves are a useful tool for characterization, encoding information about an object\u2019s shape and attitude, though it remains a complex task to disentangle desired information from other components (Wetterer & Jah 2009; Hinks et al. 2013; Fan & Frueh 2020). Several groups have conducted bespoke surveys to gather high-quality light curves for LEO and GSO objects, with the aim of testing and improving inversion algorithms (Schildknecht et al. 2015; Chote et al. 2019; \u0160ilha et al. 2020)."

Observations alone cannot prevent the explosions of unpassivated derelicts, nor can they thwart the impact of two uncontrolled objects that find themselves on a collision course. With no legally binding regulations, the testing of ASAT capabilities can continue to take place unpunished, while operators can opt to launch with little regard for sustainable practices. What needs to be done in the future to ensure that satellite operations in the space domain remain sustainable?\nPolicy is one of the major hurdles standing in the way of sustainability in space. For the past couple of\nNAM 2021 Space Domain Awareness The 2021 National Astronomy Meeting featured a parallel session on space domain awareness (SDA), convened by John Zarnecki (Open University) and James Blake (University of Warwick), both active members of the STFC-supported Global Network On Sustainability In Space (GNOSIS).\nThe session explored the ways in which astronomers and MIST physicists can contribute to enhanced levels of SDA. Ian McCrea (STFC) kicked off proceedings with an excellent overview of the importance of monitoring space weather and its various effects on atmospheric drag, a key parameter when predicting the positions of satellites. Stuart Eves (SJE Space Ltd) moved on to identify the current knowledge and technology gaps that need to be addressed to achieve sufficient levels of SDA, from tracking orbital debris as small as 1 cm, to determining an object\u2019s origins, intentions, and physical characteristics. To round off the session, James Blake presented the results from a survey of the geosynchronous region carried out using the Isaac Newton Telescope and a robotic astrograph, on the Canary Island of La Palma. Blake concluded with an introduction to GNOSIS, encouraging members of the audience to participate in future workshops.\n\u201cObservations alone cannot prevent the explosions of unpassivated derelicts, nor can they thwart the impact of two uncontrolled objects that find themselves on a collision course\u201d\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /astrogeo/article/63/2/2.14/6546993 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\non methods for post-mission disposal (PMD). The \u201825-year rule\u2019 encourages operators to ensure disposal via atmospheric re-entry within 25 years of mission completion. Low-altitude satellites may already be naturally compliant with this, while the deorbit process can be accelerated for non-compliant satellites using propulsion, drag sails, and so on. Re-entry is not a viable option for objects in the high-altitude GSO region, so operators will typically attempt to raise decommissioned spacecraft into so-called \u2018graveyard\u2019 orbits, clearing the way for future use of the operational zone (Jehn et al. 2005).\nLevels of adherence to the debris mitigation guidelines are provided in Figure 2d. Excluding naturally compliant cases, adherence to the 25-year rule in LEO remains concerningly low. Recent efforts have looked to formulate a Space Sustainability Rating to incentivize operators (Letizia et al. 2020), though several questions remain unanswered. With access to space becoming more and more widespread, how can one compare, say, a university-led CubeSat experiment against a constellation operator\u2019s fleet of satellites? How does one attribute liability in the event of a collision involving uncontrolled debris? How can regulations ensure an even playing field for emerging nations, when other nations have had ample opportunity to develop sustainable practices through trial and error?\nWhile the legal quagmire surrounding mitigation continues to unfold on the ground, another key focus is on the development and testing of remediation concepts in space. Several studies agree that mitigation will need to be supplemented by active debris removal (ADR) to stabilize the LEO environment (Liou et al. 2010; Bonnal et al. 2013; White & Lewis 2014). Commonly cited as the goal for future ADR activities, Liou (2011) found the removal of five high-priority targets per year to be effective at suppressing a runaway growth in the debris population, when combined with 90% adherence to PMD guidelines and launch traffic representative of the period 2003\u201311. However, with small satellite technologies flourishing in recent years, launch rates consequently soaring, and operators continuing to ignore voluntary standards, it is likely that a higher removal rate will be necessary.\nLarge clusters of derelict LEO rocket bodies have been identified as high-priority candidates for future ADR missions (Liou 2011; Rossi et al. 2020; McKnight et al. 2021; Maclay & McKnight 2021). Another key target is ESA\u2019s defunct eight-tonne satellite, Envisat, which resides in a densely populated region and is known to be tumbling (Kucharski et al. 2014; Pittet et al. 2018). Studies have explored the challenges of approaching and capturing a tumbling, uncooperative\nThe Argus Experiment Argus was a citizen science project, bringing together scientists from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (UK) and members of the Basingstoke Astronomical Society (BAS) to gather observations of LEO satellites and assess the performance of amateur-grade imaging systems in the context of SDA (Feline et al. 2019).

While some space-faring nations have already reflected these guidelines in their national regulatory framework, legally binding regulations are still lacking on the international stage (Weeden 2011).\nAlongside passivation and collision avoidance, the voluntary guidelines place recommendations\n2.18 A&G | April 2022 | Vol. 63 | academic.oup.com/astrogeo\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /astrogeo/article/63/2/2.14/6546993 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ntarget (Nishida et al. 2011; Chu et al. 2018), alongside those associated with the removal of multiple targets per mission (Braun et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2018).\nA wide variety of mechanisms have been proposed for capturing and removing spacecraft, involving nets (Botta et al. 2016; Shan et al. 2020), harpoons (Dudziak et al. 2015), tentacles (Wormnes et al. 2013; Pirat et al. 2017), electrodynamic tethers (Kawamoto et al. 2006; Nishida et al. 2009; Pardini et al. 2009), drag augmentation (Underwood et al. 2019), propulsion (DeLuca et al. 2013; Olympio & Frouvelle 2014), and laser ablation (Phipps et al. 2012; Soulard et al. 2014; Ebisuzaki et al. 2015). Far from exhaustive, this list nevertheless serves to highlight the complexity of the problem, with no concept offering a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution. More comprehensive reviews of ADR methods have been undertaken by Shan et al. (2016) and, more recently, Mark & Kamath (2019), though the field continues to evolve rapidly.\nTechniques conceptualized for ADR remain largely untested in space. The RemoveDebris mission, led by Surrey Space Centre, carried out successful captures of planted debris using net and harpoon systems, prior to the partial deployment of a drag sail for re-entry (Forshaw et al. 2020; Aglietti et al. 2020). Astroscale\u2019s ELSA-d mission launched successfully in March 2021 and aims to demonstrate the capture of a tumbling client in orbit using a magnetic docking system (Forshaw et al. 2019). ESA\u2019s ClearSpace-1 mission will likely be the first to remove an existing object from orbit, currently due to target a Vespa upper stage when it launches to LEO in the mid-2020s (Biesbroek et al. 2021).\nRemoval missions targeting higher altitudes remain technologically and financially unfeasible, though the GSO region provides an excellent testbed for on-orbit servicing concepts (Xu et al. 2011; Flores-Abad et al. 2014; Medina et al. 2017). Northrop Grumman\u2019s Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV) servicers have successfully rendezvoused and docked with two GSO communications satellites, Intelsat 901 (February 2020) and Intelsat 10-02 (April 2021), with the aim of extending their operational lifetimes. The MEV missions have been monitored by a network of Five Eyes sensors as part of the Phantom Echoes campaigns (George et al. 2021). These have explored the myriad observational challenges associated with rendezvous and proximity operations, from maintaining custody of constantly manoeuvring targets, to resolving the servicer and client satellites as they undergo close approach. The Phantom Echoes experiment serves as an example of how SDA activities can be coordinated across multiple sectors, combining expertise from government, industry, academia, and even the amateur astronomy community (see \u2018The Argus Experiment\u2019 box)."

Of particular concern are the large constellations of LEO satellites that are under development, offering global coverage and promising ubiquitous access to low-latency broadband data services. Many private companies have already licensed thousands of new satellites, ready to launch into a variety of orbital bands (Muelhaupt et al. 2019; Curzi et al. 2020). Efforts to simulate the environmental impact of constellations have collectively agreed that adherence to PMD guidelines will be a pivotal factor (Bastida Virgili et al. 2016; Radtke et al. 2017; Pardini & Anselmo 2020). Indeed, the latest update to the US mitigation standard practices states that constellation operators should aim for a 90% success rate for PMD, though many believe a minimum goal of 99% will be\nnecessary. Aside from PMD, constellations are set to place further strain on the archaic infrastructures of existing surveillance networks; even with responsible management in place, constellation satellites will still be at risk of colliding with uncontrolled debris, thus resulting in more frequent collision avoidance scenarios.\nNumerous studies have highlighted the negative effects that large LEO constellations are likely to have on ground- and space-based astronomical observations across a range of wavelengths (Hainaut & Williams 2020; Levchenko et al. 2020; McDowell 2020). Satellite streak contamination in astronomical imaging is by no means a new issue, but the vast numbers and low altitudes involved in maintaining LEO constellations look set to exacerbate the problem, particularly for wide-field systems such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which will look to study large parts of the\nsky at any one time, thus resulting in a high probability of field contamination (Massey et al. 2020). An example of a contaminated wide-field image is provided in Figure 7.\nWhile the lowest-altitude constellations are likely to be the brightest, those in higher-altitude bands will perhaps be of greater concern to astronomers; low-altitude satellites will spend much of the night eclipsed in the Earth\u2019s shadow, while satellites in the upper bands of the LEO region will remain visible for larger portions of the night. This will be the case for nodes of the OneWeb constellation, now part-owned by the UK government. OneWeb satellites reside in altitude bands around 1200 km, to take advantage of a local minimum in the debris population. Seitzer (2020) has recommended that constellation operators take precautions to keep their satellites faint, and opt for altitude bands below roughly 600 km, to best combat the issue.\nTo add to the logistical challenges associated with monitoring a sky that is getting busier every year, surveillance networks may soon be tasked with tracking and cataloguing objects far beyond\n(a)\n(b) (c)\n(a)\n(b) (c)\n7(a) An example of satellite streak contamination in a survey image acquired by the Gravitational wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) in La Palma, Canary Islands, a wide-field array focused on detecting the optical counterparts of gravitational wave events (Steeghs et al. 2021).

The expansion of launch traffic into cislunar space in the wake of NASA\u2019s Artemis programme will undoubtedly pose problems for existing SDA architectures (Bolden et al. 2020): the increased range will result in diminished signal-tonoise, calling for more sensitive instruments; the much larger volume of space in need of monitoring will necessitate a more extensive array of groundand space-based SDA capabilities; and observations will often be obstructed by the Moon, or eclipsed in shadow, calling for more sophisticated algorithms for object detection and orbital state prediction with sparse or diminished information (Yanagisawa et al. 2012; Virtanen et al. 2016; Hickson 2018; Nir et al. 2018; Pirovano et al. 2020). It is likely that a variety of astronomical techniques developed for data reduction, classification, fusion, tracking and association may prove transferable when applied to many of the upcoming challenges for SDA, from cislunar surveillance to the monitoring of rendezvous and proximity operations for on-orbit servicing and ADR missions.\nOrbital debris is not a new problem, but it will worsen dramatically if the SDA community fails to act. The problem affects all operators in space, and international cooperation will be integral to the solution, not least in the development of robust regulations for debris mitigation. Moreover, the problem warrants a cross-sector, cross-disciplinary approach. Astronomers are well-placed to help build our understanding of the near-Earth environment, with a wide range of tools and techniques that could\ncomplement future SDA missions. Surveillance systems will need to handle the strain of monitoring tens of thousands of active satellites, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of fragments that are currently too small to be catalogued, yet sufficiently large to cause significant damage to spacecraft. Algorithms for object detection, characterization and classification, will need to overcome additional obstacles as rendezvous and proximity operations become commonplace, and orbital traffic starts to spill into the cislunar domain. Observational data from a plethora of sensors, institutions, nations, will need to be shared and fused (see, for example, early efforts from the University of Texas at Austin with AstriaGraph, bit.ly/3o2rqHs) to have any hope of preventing collisional cascades from rendering key orbital bands unusable for future generations.\nAs new technologies develop, and challenges arise, it is essential that we keep a watchful eye on the sky to protect the satellites that we have come to rely on. \u25cf\nGNOSIS The STFC-supported Global Network On Sustainability In Space (GNOSIS) aims to bring together scientists in academia and industry to tackle issues related to the growing problems of orbital debris and space sustainability.\nThe network organizes \u2018jargonbusting\u2019 workshops and conferences for those wishing to learn more\nabout the field.
