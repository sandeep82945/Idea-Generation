            "text": "Recent cosmological and astronomical observations predict that the present Universe is passing through an accelerated phase of expansion. The recent decade is witnessing a challenge in theoretical cosmology from the observed data coming from various missions, namely, supernovae (SN) Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), etc [1\u20134]. It was known in the standard model of cosmology that the late phase of the Universe can be understood by introducing a cosmological constant (\u039b) [5\u20138]. Although the approach is fairly successful, this model suffers from the serious problem of fine tuning [9]. The observational evidence of galactic and extra-galactic dynamics is not understood by general relativity (GR). The present observations demand that the Universe consists mainly of a non-gravitating type of matter, namely, dark energy (DE) having negative pressure, and a substantial amount of gravitating non-baryonic dark matter (DM) [10\u201312]. Another alternative approach in this direction is to modify the gravitational sector of the Einstein field equations to fit the missing matter energy of the observed Universe. Recently several authors have considered modified theories of gravity to describe the evolution of the Universe. The aim of the theories is to incorporate the description of the DE era [13\u201318] in the theoretical cosmology. It is also known that the present Universe emerged from a early inflationary phase, the modified theories of gravity also provide an explanation of early inflation in addition to the late time Universe with different coupling parameters [19\u201324]. Most of the works in modified gravity are focussed on curvature based formulations, i.e., a modification of the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action by adding higher order curvature terms to it. In f (R) theory of gravity, the Lagrangian is considered to be a non-linear function of the Ricci scalar (R) [26]. The torsion based f (T ) modification, with T being the torsion scalar, is also considered in the literature [27\u201329]. In recent times, extension of GR like f (R, T ) gravity [16] with T being the trace of the energy momentum tensor and f (G) theory [30] where G is the Gauss\u2013Bonnet (GB) invariant, f (T, T ) theory [31], f (Q) theory [32, 33] where Q is the non-metricity tensor has been considered in cosmology and astrophysics.\nThe application of modified f (R)-gravity to describe the DE era of the Universe has attracted considerable attention in recent times. In the case of f (R) gravity, modifications to GR appears naturally in the low energy limit of the effective actions of the promising theories of quantum gravity namely, superstring theory. The f (R) gravity models are conformally related to GR with a self interacting scalar field [34], and both early inflation and the late time acceleration of the Universe can be accommodated. In modern cosmology, early inflation is considered to be an essential ingredient to construct viable model of the Universe. Starobinsky obtained an inflationary solution in a higher derivative theory of gravity long before the advent of inflation was actually realized [22]. In the Palatini approach of f (R) gravity models, R, RabRab corrections are considered with second order field equations, and the analysis led to an accelerating Universe [35\u201338]. These models were further tested using observational data from SN, CMB shift parameter, BAO and Big Bang nucleosynthesis [39\u201343]. It is known that in metric f (R) gravity theories, the field equations become fourth order which is difficult to handle [44].\nIn the literature several functional forms of f (R) have been considered. To test the viability of such models, Solar System tests of the theory are implemented [45\u201350] and the results appearing from these tests are important to choose an f (R)-theory that permits a realistic cosmological model explaining the current accelerating phase of the Universe satisfactorily. It is also found that a cosmological model which fails to pass Solar System tests permits an accelerating Universe satisfactorily [51]. Thus, one can bypass these local considerations and simply study the cosmological behaviour to arrive at an independent test. The cosmological constraints on f (R) gravity is relevant also because one can simply imagine that the baryons do not see the modifications to GR [52] and evades the Solar System tests in a somewhat artificial way. For a ready reference see [53\u201355]. In astrophysics it is reported that the issue of massive neutron stars can be resolved considering higher order curvature terms that appears in f (R) gravity [56\u201358].\nZweibach [59] has shown long ago that the string corrections due to the Einstein action up to first order in the slope parameter and fourth power of the momenta should be proportional to GB terms (where GB = RabcdRabcd \u2212 4RabRab + R2). However later on, it was shown that the field redefinition theorem of Hooft and Veltman [60] may apply in this case. GB terms arise in the low energy effective action for heterotic strings [61\u201364] and also in the second order of Lovelock gravity theory [65]. It is known that GB terms in higher dimensions leads to a ghost free propagator. In the four-dimensional framework, the GB terms do not contribute to the dynamics of the Universe. However, if the GB terms are coupled with a scalar field in the gravitational action, then the combination plays an important role in the dynamics of evolution of the Universe via the scalar field. The scalar field coupled with the GB terms also plays an important role in avoiding the singularity in string induced gravity [66]. In the braneworld scenario, it has been shown that naked singularities may not occur if a scalar field with a GB term is considered [67]. Cosmological solutions admitting an emergent Universe scenario was obtained in the framework of GB gravity coupled with a scalar field in four dimensions [68]. In the literature, the evolution of cosmological perturbations and their corresponding parameters for GB inflationary models were considered [69\u201374]. The observational constraints on the values of the cosmological perturbation parameters are used to verify cosmological inflationary models in the presence of a non-minimal coupling of a scalar field and the GB scalar [75, 76]. For further discussions of the cosmology in GB theory, please see references [77\u201381], and the references therein.\nRecently interacting fluid models in cosmology have attracted renewed attention because of their interesting physical as well as mathematical properties. Many astrophysical situations require interactions among fluids for a complete description of the Universe. In the literature, it is shown that matter may possess multiple interacting components in the case of an inflationary Universe [82], in M-theory [83] and also in some models of cosmic acceleration [84]. These fluids admit a covariant description [85], different scaling solutions [86], support the theory of cosmological perturbations [87] and are also used in models with DM and DE [88]. Among the different motivations for such models, the analysis of interactions within the dark sector are quite popular. The effect of interactions among cosmic fluids has been studied in the emergent Universe framework [89]. In the literature late time evolution of the Universe is studied in the framework of f (R,G) gravity with a scalar field [90]. It is likely that interaction among the fluids originates as one sector of matter transforms to another sector leading to excess contribution of DE in the present Universe. The motivation of the paper is to investigate the effect of interaction that sets in among the cosmic fluids, (viz, non-relativistic matter, radiation and DE) on the evolution of the Universe in the modified gravity. We consider linear interaction among the cosmic fluids to study evolution of the Universe which are realistic and accommodates the observed Universe.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: in section 2, the field equation in f (R) gravity with a GB term is obtained. The field equations are converted in terms of redshift parameter. The cosmological parameters to probe the Universe are also obtained. A general form of the field equations are obtained in terms of a new density parameter \u03a9H in the model. In section 3, we consider interaction among the fluid components, and the conservation equation is rewritten incorporating the interaction terms. In section 4, we obtain cosmological models in the framework of two different modified theories of gravity and investigate the late time evolution of the Universe. Finally, in section 5, we enumerate the results obtained with a brief discussion.\n2. Field equations in f(R)-modified gravity with GB terms\nThe modified action in the case of f (R) gravity with the GB terms in (3 + 1) dimensions is given by,\nS = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g ( 1\n2\u03ba2 f (R) \u2212 1 2 g\u03bc\u03bd\u2202\u03bc\u03c6\u2202\u03bd\u03c6\u2212 V(\u03c6) \u2212 \u03be(\u03c6)G + Lm\n) , (1)\nwhere R denotes the Ricci scalar, \u03ba = 1MP with MP is Planck mass, V(\u03c6) is the potential of the scalar field, and \u03be(\u03c6) is the GB coupling function with the dilaton field. The GB invariant is given by G = R2 \u2212 4R\u03bc\u03bdR\u03bc\u03bd + R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1 where R\u03bc\u03bd and R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1 are the Ricci and Riemann curvature tensors respectively. Finally Lm denotes the matter Lagrangian corresponding to both relativistic and non-relativistic perfect fluids respectively. We consider a flat Friedmann\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FRW) metric to describe the cosmological geometric background in this study. The line element is given by,\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2\u03b4i j dxi dx j (2)\nwith a(t) being the scale factor of the Universe. In a flat Universe background the Ricci scalar and the GB terms are given by R = 6(2H2 + H\u0307) and G = 24H2(H2 + H\u0307) respectively, where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time t and H = a\u0307a is the Hubble parameter. We consider a homogeneous scalar field which depends only on the cosmic time. The field equations for the gravitational action given by equation (1) is obtained by varying with respect to the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd and the scalar field \u03c6, which are,\nH2 = \u03ba2\n3 fR\n( \u03c1+\n1 2 \u03c6\u03072 + V(\u03c6)\n) +\nfRR \u2212 f 6 fR \u2212 H f\u0307R fR + 8\u03ba2\u03be\u0307H3 fR , (3)\nH\u0307 = \u2212 \u03ba 2\n2 fR\n( \u03c1+ P + \u03c6\u03072 ) \u2212 f\u0308R \u2212 H f\u0307R\n2 fR + 8\u03ba2\u03be\u0307HH\u0307 fR , (4)\nV\u03c6 + \u03c6\u0308+ 3H\u03c6\u0307 = \u03be\u03c6G, (5)\nwhere, \u03c1 and P represent density and pressure respectively, the suffix\u03c6 represents the derivative w.r.t. \u03c6 and fR = \u2202 f \u2202R . We assume that the cosmic fluid is a composition of two different fluids namely, non-relativistic matter and radiation. The total energy density and the pressure of the cosmic fluids are taken as\n\u03c1 = \u03c11 + \u03b6\u03c12 (6)\nP = \u2211\ni\nwi\u03c1i, (7)\nwhere, \u03c11 and \u03c12 are the energy densities of the fluids, \u03b6 = \u03c120 \u03c10 , and \u03c120 is the present density of the relativistic matter, \u03c10 is the present value of energy density for non-relativistic matter and wi is the equation of state (EoS) parameter for the ith fluid.\nIn an evolving Universe the redshift parameter can be determined for different cosmological sources, thus we replace the scale factor from cosmic time representation to redshift parameter. A late time evolution of the Universe corresponds to very low redshift parameter (z). Thus we take the scale factor of the Universe, which is given by\na(t) = 1\n1 + z , (8)\nwhere present size of the Universe (a0) = 1. Now we replace the time derivative by the derivative of the redshift parameter (z) as,\nd dt \u2261 \u2212H(1 + z) d dz . (9)\nThe time derivatives can then be replaced by the derivative with respect to the redshift parameter z accordingly. We get the following relations,\nH\u0307 = \u2212H(1 + z)H\u2032 (10)\n\u03c6\u0307 = \u2212H(1 + z)\u03c6\u2032 (11)\n\u03c6\u0308 = H2(1 + z)2\u03c6\u2032\u2032 + H2(1 + z)\u03c6\u2032 + HH\u2032(1 + z)2\u03c6\u2032 (12)\nf\u0307R = R\u0307 fRR + \u03c6\u0307 fR\u03c6 (13)\nR\u0307 = 6H(1 + z)2 ( HH\u2032\u2032 + (H\u2032)2 \u2212 3HH \u2032\n1 + z\n) (14)\nwhich are used to rewrite the field equations. Using equation (9), the field equations (3) and (5) can be rewritten as,\nH2 = \u03ba2\n3 fR\n( \u03c1+\n1 2 H2(1 + z)2\u03c6\u20322 + V(\u03c6)\n) +\nfRR \u2212 f 6 fR \u2212 8\u03ba 2(1 + z)\u03be\u2032H4 fR\n\u2212 H fR\n[ fRR ( 6H(1 + z)2 ( HH\u2032\u2032 + H\u20322 \u2212 3HH \u2032\n1 + z\n)) \u2212 H fR\u03c6(1 + z)\u03c6\u2032 ] , (15)\nV\u03c6 + H 2(1 + z)2\u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2H2(1 + z)\u03c6\u2032 + HH\u2032(1 + z)2\u03c6\u2032 = \u03be\u03c6G (16)\nhere prime (\u2032) represents the differentiation with respect to the redshift parameter (z).\nNow we define a new density parameter [90\u201393] which we denote as,\n\u03a9H = \u03c1DE \u03c10 , (17)\nwhere \u03c1DE denotes the DE density. Instead of using Hubble rate and its derivatives to quantify the cosmological evolution we use \u03a9H for investigating the evolution of the Universe. Using the field equations we obtain the DE density which is given by,\n\u03c1DE = 1 2 \u03c6\u03072 + V + fRR \u2212 f 2\u03ba2 \u2212 3H f\u0307R \u03ba2 + 24\u03be\u0307H3 + 3H2 \u03ba2 (1 \u2212 fR). (18)\nThe usual field equations as obtained in GR can be reproduced using equation (18) in equations (3) and (4) which are given by,\nH2 = \u03ba2\n3 (\u03c1+ \u03c1DE), (19)\nH\u0307 = \u2212\u03ba 2\n2 (\u03c1+ P + \u03c1DE + PDE), (20)\nwhere PDE represents the pressure corresponding to the dark fluid. We now express the Hubble parameter in terms of the density parameter \u03a9H as,\nH2 = m2s [ \u03a9H(z) + \u03c1\n\u03c10\n] , (21)\nwhere m2s = \u03ba 2 ( \u03c10 3 ) = 1.871 01 \u00d7 10\u221267.\nThe derivatives of the above expression with respect to the redshift parameter yields,\nHH\u2032 = m2s 2\n( \u03a9\u2032H(z) + \u03c1\u2032\n\u03c10\n) . (22)\nHowever, once again derivative of the above equation w.r.t. z yields\nH\u20322 + HH\u2032\u2032 = m2s 2\n( \u03a9\u2032\u2032H(z) + \u03c1\u2032\u2032\n\u03c10\n) , (23)\nwhich will be used to determine the cosmological parameters. The field equations (15) and (16) are highly nonlinear and we analyse the equations numerically to understand the cosmological evolution of the Universe. We plot graphically the different cosmological parameters here for two models. The variations of the cosmological parameters, namely, the density parameter\u03a9H , scalar field \u03c6 etc are plotted with redshift parameter z.\nTo distinguish the DE models qualitatively or quantitatively a new geometrical analysis called statefinder diagnostic was proposed by Sahni et al [99]. In the paper we consider the statefinder diagnostic to study the nature of DE by defining the EoS parameter wDE and the density parameter \u03a9DE with respect to z and \u03a9H [90] which are given by,\nwDE = \u22121 + 1 3 (1 + z) d ln \u03a9H dz , \u03a9DE = \u03a9H \u03a9H +\n\u03c1 \u03c10\n. (24)\nHowever, a complete scenario of the cosmological evolution can be obtained by determining the following parameters [90]\nq = \u22121 \u2212 H\u0307 H2 , j = H\u0308 H3 \u2212 3q \u2212 2, s = j \u2212 1 3 ( q \u2212 12\n) , Om(z) = ( H H0 )2 \u2212 1\n(1 + z)3 \u2212 1 ,\n(25)\nwhere q is the deceleration parameter, j is the jerk parameter, s is the snap parameter and Om(z) is the Om parameter. Here the transformation of matter from one sector to the other sector begins at time t = ti when interaction originates among the fluids which will be considered in the next section."

            "heading": "3. Conservation equations for interacting fluids",
            "text": "In this section, we consider an interacting DE model with non-relativistic matter and radiation fluid. The interaction is assumed to originate at a later epoch (interactions arise due to a variety of mechanisms during particular eras) [94\u201396]. The conservation equations with interactions can be written as,\n\u03c1\u03071 + 3H(\u03c11 + P1) = \u2212Q (26)\n\u03c1\u03072 + 3H(\u03c12 + P2) = Q\u2032 (27)\n\u02d9\u03c1DE + 3H(\u03c1DE + PDE) = Q \u2212 Q\u2019, (28)\nwhere, \u03c11, P1 and \u03c12, P2 are the energy densities and pressure corresponding to non-relativistic matter and radiation, respectively, Q and Q\u2032 represent the interaction strengths which may assume arbitrary forms. The signs of the terms Q and Q\u2032 are not restricted. When Q > 0, energy transfer from the non-relativistic matter sector to the other two constituents takes place. Q\u2032 < 0 corresponds to energy loss from the radiation sector, and Q < Q\u2032 corresponds to energy transfer from the DE sector to the other two fluid sectors. In the case of Q\u2032 = 0, DE interacts only with the non-relativistic matter sector. From the conservation equations, it is evident that although energy conservation is violated for individual fluids, the total energy density of the fluid satisfies the conservation equation together. An equivalent uncoupled set of conservation equations can be obtained from equations (26)\u2013(28) as,\n\u03c1\u03071 + 3H(1 + weff1 )\u03c11 = 0, (29)\n\u03c1\u03072 + 3H(1 + weff2 )\u03c12 = 0, (30)\n\u02d9\u03c1DE + 3H(1 + weffDE)\u03c1DE = 0. (31)\ni.e.,\n3\u2211 i=1 [\u03c1i + 3H(\u03c1i + Pi)] = 0. (32)\nThe effective EoS parameters are given by\nweff1 = w1 + Q\n3H\u03c11 , (33)\nweff2 = w2 \u2212 Q\u2032\n3H\u03c12 , (34)\nweffDE = wDE + Q\u2032 \u2212 Q 3H\u03c1DE . (35)\nWe now consider the interactions as Q = \u2212\u03b2H\u03c11 and Q\u2032 = \u03b1H\u03c12, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the interaction strength of the fluids. Here the strength of interactions, \u03b1 and \u03b2 determines the transformation of matters from one sector to another sector unless Q = Q\u2032. The effective EoS parameters for non-relativistic matter and radiation are given by,\nweff1 = w1 \u2212 \u03b2\n3 , (36)\nweff2 = w2 \u2212 \u03b1\n3 . (37)\nThe behaviour of \u03c11 and \u03c12 in terms of z and w eff is obtained by integrating equations (29) and (30). The energy densities are given by:\n\u03c11 = \u03c10(1 + z)3(1+w eff 1 ), (38)\n\u03c12 = \u03c120(1 + z)3(1+w eff 2 ). (39)\nUsing equations (38) and (39) in equation (6) we get\n\u03c1 = \u03c10\n[ (1 + z)3(1+w eff 1 ) + \u03b6(1 + z)3(1+w eff 2 ) ] . (40)\nNow the field equation (15) and (16) can be solved numerically using the above equations for energy densities and we determine the new parameter \u03a9H and the scalar field \u03c6. The evolution of the Universe is studied plotting the state finding parameters in addition to \u03a9H and the deceleration parameter q. The interaction strengths \u03b1, \u03b2, the function f (R), potential function V(\u03c6) and the GB coupling term \u03be(\u03c6) act as free parameters in this case. To study the effect of the interaction among the components of the cosmic fluid one has to consider specific forms of the above functions. Changing the values of the coupling functions affect the evolution of the cosmological parameters which will be discussed in the following sections for two different models.\n4.

            "text": "In this case a scalar field coupled with GB terms is considered as in four dimensions GB term does not play any role in the dynamics of the Universe. The primordial gravitational wave (GW) speed depends on \u03be(\u03c6) and the scalar field potential (V(\u03c6)). We consider here a finite GW speed and a free scalar field. Thus the coupling parameter is to be considered in the absence of a scalar field potential (i.e., V = 0) and we take the GB coupling term as [90],\n\u03be(\u03c6) = e \u03c6 MP . (41)\nThe modified f (R) gravity is chosen to be,\nf (R) = R + \u03b3R2 \u2212 \u03bb (\nR 3m2s\n)\u03b4 , (42)\nwhere \u03b3 = M\u22122, \u03bb (dimensions of mass squared ([Mass]2)) and \u03b4 are constants. Here M is approximately equal to M = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 ( 50 N ) MP, with N being the number of e-foldings and the exponent \u03b4 is positive in the interval 0 < \u03b4 < 1 [93]. It is important to mention here that f (R) modified gravity can unify the early Universe with a late time accelerating Universe.\nWe have considered this functional form of f (R) as it can give a reasonable description of the inflationary epoch as well as the late time era [90, 93]. The R2 term dominates in the early epoch when R is large and controls the inflationary behaviour, whereas the R\u03b4 term dominates during the present epoch with R \u2192 0 for \u03b4 < 1. The presence of scalar field further alters the dynamics of the evolving Universe. It was shown that a GB topological invariant (G) in a f (R) modified gravity cannot nullify the DE oscillations, although G alone permits an oscillationfree DE [97]. In the paper a scalar field is considered with interacting cosmic fluids to examine the role of interaction on the late time evolutionary features of the Universe. We consider a set of values of the model parameters \u03bb = 130.845\u00d7 10\u221267 eV2, \u03b4 = 10\u22122 and N = 60 e-folding which lead to a physically consistent cosmology [90, 93]. The current value of the Hubble parameter is taken from the Planck data [25] which is,\nH0 = 67.4 \u00b1 0.5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. (43)\nWe consider H0 = 67.4 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 which when converted in the unit of eV becomes H0 = 1.37187 \u00d7 10\u221233 eV.\nEquations (15) and (16) are analysed numerically considering suitable initial conditions for a range of redshifts that describe the last stage of matter domination epoch and the late time era up to the present time, i.e., [zi, z f ] = [0, 10]. The initial conditions are considered to be,\n\u03a9H \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (z=10) = \u03bb 33m2s ( 1 + \u03b3\u0303(1 + z f ) ) ,\nd\u03a9H dz \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (z=10) = \u03b3\u0303 ( \u03bb 33m2s ) ,\n\u03c6 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (z=10) = 10\u221216MP, d\u03c6 dz \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (z=10) = \u221210\u221217MP. (44)\nwhich gives a viable description of the present observed Universe. In the above we put \u03b3\u0303 to get various initial conditions for the parameter \u03a9H. The initial conditions assumed above are found to play an important role in the higher redshift values only, it is independent at the low z values (namely, zi). The nature of evolution of the cosmological parameters depend on the initial conditions through \u03b3\u0303 which will be discussed in the following [93]. We consider \u03b3\u0303 = 10\u22123 for the rest of the manuscript as it yields a reasonable phenomenological behaviour\nof the cosmological parameters, however it can assume higher values also in principle. The accurate forms for the initial conditions may however be obtained considering some cosmographic approach (reference [100]) which is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be tackled elsewhere. Now assuming interactions among the different components of the cosmic fluid we obtain cosmological models in the following cases:\nCase I. For \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 < 0 (i.e., Q > 0): For Q > 0, energy transfers from the non-relativistic matter sector to the other two fluids, the system of equation (15), (16) and (40) are analysed numerically. The different state finder parameters are plotted in figure 1. From figure 1(a), it is evident that for a given interaction \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 < 0, one cannot negate the DE oscillations for z 4 in the f (R) + f (G) model. The variation of the scalar field with redshift (z) is plotted in figure 1(b). The scalar field increases as the Universe evolves but at the present epoch it attained a maximum value. This behaviour of the scalar field is in contradiction with pure f (R) gravity. In figures 1(c)\u2013(f), the deceleration parameter (q), the jerk parameter ( j), snap parameter (s) and the Om(z) parameter are plotted with redshift. For the interaction strength considered in this case i.e., \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = \u22120.01, we found oscillating nature in the high redshift domain which however reduces at the present epoch. The deceleration parameter q shows a transition from positive value to negative value at a certain redshift which indicates a transition from decelerated phase to the accelerated phase. The statefinder parameters j and s approaches their respective \u039bCDM values (i.e., j = 1 and s = 0) at the present epoch. The present values of the cosmological parameters are tabulated in table 1 for z = 0 and compared with cosmological observations. We note from table 1 that the deceleration parameter (q) and the Om(z) parameter are different from that of the corresponding\u039bCDM model. In figure 1( f ) we plot the Om(z) parameter for the present model (blue) and that of the \u039bCDM (red, dashed). It is observed that at very low redshifts the f (R) gravity model coupled with GB terms in presence of interacting fluids differs significantly from the \u039bCDM which is found prominent in the case of Om(z) diagnostics plot. The evolution of the effective DE EoS parameter (\u03c9effDE) and the density parameter (\u03a9DE) are plotted in figure 2. Both of them show oscillating behaviour for higher redshifts. This behaviour originates because of the dominance of the f (R) gravity part over the GB term and it is decided by the choice of \u03b1 and \u03b2. In the case of interacting cosmic fluids, the effective EoS parameter (\u03c9effDE) for the DE depends on the scalar field (\u03c6) explicitly, which is an interesting observations. It is noted that as the strength of interaction is increased up to a certain point (decreasing \u03b2 keeping \u03b1 fixed), then the oscillating behaviour of the density parameter \u03a9H vanishes. However, for \u03b1 = 2, the oscillation smooths out for \u03b2 \u22120.95. and it is found that the state finder parameters exhibit discontinuity at some redshift (shown in figure 3), which is not desirable for a stable cosmological model. Thus the range of the strength of interaction can be estimated which leads to stable cosmological models. We consider three different \u03b1 values and determined the range of \u03b2 numerically for a realistic cosmological model. It is found that as \u03b1 increases the allowed range of \u03b2 decreases. From figure 2(b) it is observed that for high redshifts (z \u223c 10) weffDE was oscillating, indicating transfer of energy from one sector of matter to the others, however, at the present epoch, the oscillation dies out reaching a stable configuration attaining a negative EoS parameter indicating existence of exotic matter obtained from transformation mechanism in a modified gravity beyond Einstein gravity and interacting fluids.\nFinally, in figure 4 we consider two different \u03b3\u0303 values viz, \u03b3\u0303 = 10\u22123 and \u03b3\u0303 = 1 to study the dependence of initial conditions on the DE oscillations. As the field equations are highly nonlinear we analyse numerically as plotted. From the plots it is clear that for a given range of values of the initial conditions the DE is found to show oscillation behaviour for higher redshifts. However the present value of the DE is independent of \u03b3\u0303. It is found that as \u03b3\u0303 is\ngradually increased the DE oscillations become more prominent. The transition redshift, i.e. the z value for which the Universe transits from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase also get changed with change of \u03b3\u0303.\n(II) For \u03b1 < 0 and \u03b2 > 0 (i.e., Q\u2032 < 0)\nFor Q\u2032 < 0, i.e., energy loss from the radiation sector, we analyse the system of equations numerically. We plot different cosmological parameters in figure 5. In this case, the new density parameter \u03a9H is found to oscillate and thereafter at the present epoch it attains a constant value. The present value of \u03a9H is constant in both the cases. The scalar field increases as the Universe evolves similar to the previous cases. We conclude that the evolution of the scalar field is independent of the interactions. Variation of the cosmological parameters with redshift (z) are drawn in figure 5(c)\u2013(f). The state finder parameters exhibit oscillating behaviour for high redshifts (z 4). The figures are plotted for \u03b1 = \u22120.1 and \u03b2 = 0.02 in figure 5. We found that as \u03b1 attains large negative values for a given \u03b2, the oscillating behaviour of the parameters vanishes (when \u03b2 = 0.01 oscillation dies down for \u03b1 \u22122.063). However, the cosmological parameters are found to be entangled with singularities at a given z as shown in the figure 3(e).\nThe EoS parameter for the DE and the density parameter are plotted in figure 6. Here both \u03a9DE and \u03c9effDE are increasing, but the oscillation in the \u03c9 eff DE which shows oscillation for z 4 is found without oscillatory behaviour at the present epoch (z = 0) but remains negative staying\nin the phantom region for most of the time with the chosen \u03b1 and \u03b2 values. The present value of \u03c9effDE however indicates a transition from phantom to quintessence region as noted in table 2.\nIt is noted that for Q\u2032 < 0 the effective EoS parameter always remains negative whereas for Q > 0 it oscillates between positive and negative values in the past, however, in the recent past the parameter attains a negative value. In this case it admits an accelerating Universe with weffDE indicating a transition from phantom to quintessence matter at present. It is also noted that\ncosmological and state finder parameters show strong oscillation if a small \u03bb is considered. The values of the cosmological parameters calculated using the model at the present epoch are displayed in table 2. For Q > 0, as\u03b1 increases, the limiting range of interaction for\u03b2 decreases. Similarly, for Q\u2032 < 0, as beta is increased the range of allowed \u03b1 decreases. The range of the coupling parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are estimated for three different cases as displayed in table 3.\nIt is noted that in the modified gravity f (R) term dominates over the GB terms as we observe oscillation of DE in the late time Universe in the presence of interaction between the fluids. The interacting cosmic fluids play an important role in determining the evolutionary pattern of the Universe. The existence of oscillation in the density parameter \u03a9H for z 4 imposes an upper bound on the strength of interaction \u03b1 for a given \u03b2. It is new and interesting to note that beyond the strength of interaction considered above the oscillation in DE vanishes and also discontinuity appears in the cosmological parameters at a given redshift in the late time Universe. In figure 7 we plot the variations of \u03a9H and the deceleration parameter q with z in the presence of interaction and in the absence of interaction. The interacting scenario is analysed for Q\u2032 < 0 with \u03b1 = \u22120.1 and \u03b2 = 0.02. It is observed in figure 7 that as interaction between cosmic fluid sets in, the amplitude of oscillation for \u03a9H is found to jump up significantly compared to a Universe without interaction. It is also found that the present value of \u03a9H(0) is more in a Universe in the presence of interactions. The deceleration parameter q in figure 7 drawn in the right panel shows that a Universe transits into an accelerated phase early compared to the case when the cosmic fluids are non-interacting. In both the cases q < 0 which admits an accelerating Universe in the late time. In an interacting Universe the oscillatory behaviour of the q value found during its positive phase is however, absent in a Universe without interacting fluid. This is a new scenario noted by us in the EGB cosmology which differentiates a non-interacting fluid Universe."

            "text": "We consider Einstein gravity (i.e. f (R) = R) with GB terms coupled with a scalar field. The scalar field is not free now, a self interacting potential is operative. The scalar field potential is\nV(\u03c6) =\n( \u03c6\nMP\n)4 , (45)\nand the scalar coupling function has the following form,\n\u03be(\u03c6) =\n( \u03c6\nMP\n) . (46)\nIt is known that the theories which involve GB terms coupled with an arbitrary scalar field produce gravitational waves which propagate with a velocity deviating from the speed of\nlight. The recent GW170817 event implies that the primordial GW speed must be equal to the speed of light [101]. This leads to an instability in the theoretical framework. If the theory considered is described by massless gravitons throughout the evolution of the Universe, then this problem can be removed [90]. This implies that the scalar coupling function should satisfy the differential equation \u03be\u0308 = H\u03be\u0307, where H is the Hubble parameter. The Hubble parameter is obtained from the Friedmann equations which in turn connects the two scalar functions V(\u03c6) and \u03be(\u03c6) in such a way that the differential equation is satisfied. In this paper we start from arbitrary forms of the scalar field coupling functions. Power law models for the scalar fields have been used in the inflationary era where the slow roll conditions are assumed to satisfy. The \u2018slow-roll\u2019 approximation neglects the most slowly changing terms in the equations of motion. However, during the late time era one can take fields which do not obey the slow-roll conditions. Thus the Einstein gravity f (R) = R, with GB terms we consider scalar field to study late era evolution. Now we do not have R\u0307 in the field equation, the second derivative of the density parameter \u03a9H is zero. However, the second derivative of the scalar field \u03c6 is proportional to \u03a9\u2032H as seen from the continuity equation. So we need only one initial condition for \u03a9H . We\nassume that \u03a9H|(z=0) = \u039b3m2s ( 1 + 1+z f 1000 ) and the initial values for the scalar field are taken as\n\u03c6|(z=0) = 10\u221210MP = d\u03c6dz \u2223\u2223 (z=0)\n. We have considered two types of interaction among the fluids as before, and summarised the results below.\nI. For \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 < 0 (i.e., Q > 0) For \u03b1 > 0, energy transfer from non-relativistic matter sector to other two fluids sectors. In this case the field equations are solved numerically. The interaction parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 play an important role in determining the stability of the model. We note that for a given value of \u03b1, say \u03b1 = 2, the cosmological parameters are entangled with discontinuity for lower values of \u03b2 < \u22120.004. Thus the state finder parameters are plotted in figure 8 for\u03b1 = 2 and\u03b2 = \u22120.001. In this case we do not find any oscillatory behaviour in the parameters. The scalar field now decreases from a large value. The deceleration parameter flips sign from positive to negative value admitting acceleration at the present epoch. The density parameter \u03a9H remains constant, the snap parameter vanishes but the jerk parameter is close to one for the present epoch. The Om parameter stays constant at 0.3. The plot in figure 9 shows that \u03a9DE increases and \u03c9effDE increases but it remains negative throughout the evolution of the Universe.\nThus we conclude that the presence of the scalar potential smooths out the DE oscillations. The scalar field in this case shows a transition from positive to negative value at a redshift \u22489. The present values of the different parameters are listed in table 4. The values of the DE density parameter, \u03a9DE(0) and the DE EoS parameter, wDE(0) are compared with the latest\ndata from the PLANCK 2018 collaboration for estimating cosmological parameters. From the table we note that the cosmological parameters and the state finder quantities indicates that the cosmology with the modified gravity permits a Universe that resembles a \u039bCDM model at the present epoch. In the absence of interaction among the fluids, the DE EoS parameter assumes a constant value \u22121. In this case DE lies in the quintessence region and throughout the evolution never crosses the phantom divide (weffDE < \u22121).\nII. For \u03b1 < 0 and \u03b2 > 0 (i.e., Q\u2032 < 0) In this case with Q\u2032 < 0, \u03b1 < 0, \u03b2 is changed to study the cosmological model. Here we do not find a Universe without a singularity. In figure 10, the density parameter \u03a9H , scalar field (\u03c6) and different cosmological parameters are plotted for \u03b1 = \u22121 and \u03b2 = 0.01. The snap parameter in this case shows a singularity near z \u2248 5. We do not find oscillating state finder parameters in the presence of scalar potential.\nFinally the velocity of the primordial gravitational waves can be calculated for both the model [90, 98], which is given by:\nc2T = 1 \u2212 Q f 2Qt , (47)\nwhere, Q f = 16(\u03be\u0308 \u2212 H\u03be\u0307) and Qt = M2P \u2212 8\u03be\u0307H. The GW speed can assume arbitrary values depending on the scalar field coupling function \u03be(\u03c6). However, despite being arbitrary its value is close to unity as Q f Qt. The variation of of the GW speed with the redshift parameter is plotted in figure 11 for a given interaction strength considering the first model. For \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = \u22120.01, the value of Q f is of the order Q f \u223c 10\u221289 whereas Qt \u223c 10\u221229 and it admits that the ratio is very close to zero. This leads to a GW speed close to unity which is consistent with the GW170817 event. From the expression of Q f , one can see that as Q f \u2192 0, \u03be\u0308 = H\u03be\u0307. Thus the GB coupling parameter is important and the choice of the scalar coupling function to the GB terms is not arbitrary."

            "text": "We present cosmological models in f (R) modified gravity with coupled GB terms and interacting fluids. The strength of interactions between the different fluid components are probed in the modified gravity with scalar field (\u03c6) coupled to GB terms and the evolutionary features of the late time Universe are obtained. A Universe consisting of DE and other fluids are taken up here with interaction that permits energy flow between the different components. We consider\ntwo different actions of gravity: (I) f (R) = R + \u03b3R2 \u2212 \u03bb (\nR 3m2s\n)\u03b4 with GB terms coupled in the\npresence of a free scalar field and (II) Einstein gravity f (R) = R with GB terms coupled with a\nscalar field in a self interacting potential. We probe cosmological models that accommodate the present accelerating Universe naturally. The different functional forms of f (R) are considered here to find out the importance of interaction that changes the dynamics of the Universe.\nWe note the following: Model-I. The f (R) modified gravity contains additional R2 term and R\u03b4 term where \u03b4 < 1, is a small perturbative term. The inclusion of the R2 term is to accommodate the early inflationary phase and the R\u03b4 term is added to get a late time behaviour of the Universe. The dynamics of the early Universe is controlled by the R2 term. In the absence of a scalar potential function (V(\u03c6)), we study the evolution of the Universe considering two different interactions. In the case of pure GB gravity, an arbitrary choice of scalar coupling function may lead to primordial GW speeds that deviates considerably from the speed of light. To overcome the problem, we took the scalar coupling functions which satisfy the differential equation \u03be\u0308 = H\u03be\u0307.\nWe determine the interaction strengths \u03b1 and \u03b2 for a realistic late time cosmology and plot the variation of the density parameter \u03a9H with z for Q > 0 in figures 1(a) and 3(a) which show that \u03a9H \u223c 12 in the unit of H 2\nms at the present epoch and dominates the present energy\ndensity for non-relativistic matter. It is found that the evolutionary behaviour of the cosmological parameters depend on the choice of the initial conditions and therefore we chose the initial conditions so that the analysis carried out here for the given cosmological model is supported by the PLANCK 2018 results. It is to be noted that the parameter \u03b3\u0303 introduced in the theory acts as a free parameter to find the effect of \u03b3\u0303 on the evolution of \u03a9H . It is observed that as \u03b3\u0303 is increased the DE oscillations become more pronounced. We would like to point out here that the initial conditions strongly affect the large redshift behaviour of \u03a9H and the corresponding statefinder parameters however their effect at the present epoch is insignificant. For a given strength of interaction say, \u03b1 = 2, if one probes with smaller \u03b2 < 0, the oscillatory behaviour of the scale free \u03a9H that dominates in the high redshift domain (z 4) vanishes, showing an interesting feature, where initially it was small then increases thereafter attains a maximum and then decreases to a constant value. The present value is however independent of the strength of interactions. For Q\u2032 < 0 i.e., \u03b1 < 0 and \u03b2 > 0, the figure 5(a)\nshows similar behaviour as evident with Q > 0 but in the left panel of figure 7, we draw \u03a9H with and without interacting fluid, which shows that a large DE density is permissible in the presence of interaction compared to that without interaction. The variation of decelerating parameter in the right panel show that the deceleration parameter shows a sign flip which is evident at a redshift z 2. In the presence of interaction it is oscillatory which is not observed in a Universe without interaction. An interaction among the cosmic fluids indicates that the Universe transits to accelerating phase from decelerating phase earlier compared to a Universe without interacting fluids. The other cosmological parameters are oscillatory in nature for z 4 and the oscillations are significant in case of statefinder parameters containing higher derivatives of the Hubble rate. However, for the present Universe, the oscillation smooth out considerably.The scalar field evolves monotonically and for Q > 0, the variation of the deceleration parameter corresponds to a Universe passing through an accelerating phase at the present epoch. When Q\u2032 < 0, q remains positive in the past and then transits, indicating an accelerating Universe at z 2. The variation of the statefinder pair j and s with z indicate that although these are oscillatory in the past, at the present epoch the parameters closely correspond to that for the \u039bCDM model. The present values (z = 0) for the cosmological variables are tabulated in tables 1 and 2 along with their\u039bCDM values making use of the observed data. The f (R) + f (G) model with interacting fluids can be distinguished from the \u039bCDM model if one considers the Om(z) diagnostics which is shown in figures 1(f) and 5(f). The Om(z) parameter clearly differs from its \u039bCDM value at the present epoch. In the presence of interactions, the effective EoS parameter for the DE in figures 2(b) and 6(b), show that the present value is negative in both the cases supporting the predictions from observations. For both Q > 0 and Q\u2032 < 0, the effective EoS parameter for the DE lies in the quintessence region.\nFinally we computed the range of allowed interaction strengths for which the model remains singularity free in table 3 making use of the results obtained from the numerical solutions of the field equations. Beyond the range of the parameters determined here, \u03a9H becomes singularity free as shown in figure 3, but the model is unstable at a given redshift depending on the model parameters. The evolution of the Universe depends strongly on \u03bb, the coupling parameter in the f (R) gravity, we determine \u03bb which permits the present observed Universe.\nModel-II. In this case, we consider Einstein gravity with GB terms coupled with a scalar field in a potential (V(\u03c6)) to obtain cosmological model in the presence of interactions. The scalar coupling function \u03be(\u03c6) is assumed so that the differential equation \u03be\u0308 = H\u03be\u0307 is satisfied and impose an acceptable limit on the primordial GW which propagates with velocity unity (velocity of light). The Hubble parameter is determined from the field equations containing the potential energy of the scalar field V(\u03c6). Thus, the two functional behaviour of the scalar fields are interconnected which is employed here in determining the physical features of the cosmological model. As before, two types of interaction are assumed here (i) Q > 0 and (ii) Q\u2032 < 0. It is evident from the analysis that the oscillatory behaviour of the density parameter \u03a9H is however absent. In this case when the energy flows from non-relativistic matter sector to the other two sectors of the fluids one can accommodate a stable singularity free cosmological model. The strength of interactions determined by \u03b1 and \u03b2 play an important role in determining the stability of the model. For \u03b1 = 2, the cosmological parameters are determined and a discontinuity in the snap parameter s is found for \u03b2 < \u22120.004. The state finder parameters plotted in figure 8 for \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = \u22120.001 show that the deceleration parameter flips sign from positive to negative value which is required for transition of a decelerating Universe to a accelerating Universe at the present epoch. The density parameter defined by \u03a9H is found be a constant, the snap parameter vanishes at the present time and the jerk parameter attains j \u2192 1. The Om(z) parameter remains constant at 0.3 during the evolution of the Universe. In this case we note that both \u03a9DE and \u03c9effDE increase with the increase in z but the later\none remains negative always signalling the quintessence regime that never cross the phantom divide (w < \u22121) (figure 9). When Q\u2032 < 0, it admits accelerating Universe as observed from figure 10. The snap parameter is singular at z \u223c 5 but as the Universe evolves it admits \u039bCDM model since j = 1 and s = 0 at the present epoch satisfying c2T = 1.\nLastly, we conclude that in f (R) = R + \u03b3R2 \u2212 \u03bb (\nR 3m2s\n)\u03b4 modified gravity with GB term\ncoupled with a free scalar field admits oscillating state parameters in the late time Universe but at the present epoch oscillation die out and attains a constant value accommodating a late accelerating phase. For a given \u03b2 = 0.01 an upper limit on \u03b1 is found when the statefinder parameters are found free from oscillation, a new result. The oscillatory features of the parameters signals the onset of interaction that sets in the fluids at an epoch t = ti in the Universe. The present values of the model parameters are determined numerically and displayed in table 4. The values of the DE density parameter,\u03a9DE(0), the DE EoS parameter and wDE(0) are estimated which is compared with the recent data from the PLANCK 2018 collaboration. The cosmological parameters and the state finder quantities indicate that the cosmological models obtained here resembles a \u039bCDM cosmology at the present epoch. In the absence of interaction among the fluids, the DE EoS parameter assumes a constant value \u22121 in the Einstein gravity. The DE lies in the quintessence region and throughout the evolution it never crosses the phantom divide (weffDE < \u22121). In the case of Einstein gravity with GB terms, where GB term is coupled with a scalar field coupled to an interacting potential admits a new cosmological scenario where the density parameter is always constant. In the cosmological model, we found that Om(z) parameter is constant during accelerating phasr even in the presence of interaction. The DE in the Universe is found to increase and the effective value of EoS parameter also increases but it remains negative. The calculated value of the GW speed is close to unity which agrees with observation [90]. Thus the coupled GB terms in the Einstein gravity has rich structure important for constructing a viable cosmological model."
