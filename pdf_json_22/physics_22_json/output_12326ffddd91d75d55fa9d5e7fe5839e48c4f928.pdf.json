    "abstractText": "We investigate the admissible vector-valued modular forms having three independent characters and vanishing Wronskian index and determine which ones correspond to genuine 2d conformal field theories. This is done by finding bilinear coset-type relations that pair them into meromorphic characters with central charges 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40. Such pairings allow us to identify some characters with definite CFTs and rule out others. As a key result we classify all unitary three-character CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, excluding c = 8, 16. The complete list has two infinite affine series Br,1, Dr,1 and 45 additional theories. As a by-product, at higher values of the total central charge we also find constraints on the existence or otherwise of meromorphic theories. We separately list several cases that potentially correspond to Intermediate Vertex Operator Algebras.",

It is possible for multiple primaries to have the same character.1 The positive integers Yi in eq. (1.1) are the multiplicities of the characters, and the number of primaries is given in terms of these by p = 1 + \u2211n\u22121i=1 Yi. When n = 1, the only character is the identity character, and since the vacuum state is unique and real we also have p = 1. In this case we will refer to the resulting theory as a meromorphic CFT.2 A classification programme initiated in [1\u20133] and pursued by both mathematicians and physicists in more recent times [4\u201336], is based on the fact that characters are vector-valued modular forms (VVMF) of weight 0:\n\u03c7i(\u03b3\u03c4) = n=1\u2211 j=0 %ij(\u03b3)\u03c7j(\u03c4) (1.3)\nwhere: \u03b3 =\n( a b\nc d\n) \u2208 SL(2,Z), \u03b3\u03c4 \u2261 a\u03c4 + b\nc\u03c4 + d, \u03c4 \u2208 H (1.4)\nand H = {\u03c4 \u2208 C | Im(\u03c4) > 0} is the upper half plane. For the partition function in eq. (1.1) to be modular invariant, we must have:\n%\u2020diag(1, Yi)% = diag(1, Yi) (1.5)\nCharacters that transform in this way under the modular transformations can be shown to solve modular linear differential equations (MLDE) [2, 3]. Such equations have finitely many parameters and these can be varied to scan for solutions that satisfy the basic criteria to be those of a conformal field theory. These criteria correspond to the fact that each character is holomorphic in q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 (except as q \u2192 0), and have an expansion of the form:\n\u03c7i(\u03c4) = q\u03b1i \u221e\u2211 s\u22650 ai,s q s, s \u2208 Z (1.6)\nIf the VVMF correspond to a genuine CFT then these critical exponents, \u03b1is, can be identified with the central charge and (chiral) conformal dimensions as:\n\u03b1i = \u2212 c\n24 + hi (1.7)\nwith h0 = 0\u2192 \u03b10 = \u2212 c24 corresponding to the identity character of the CFT. The coefficients ai,s, s \u2265 1 should be non-negative integers for some choice of positive integer ai,0 that provides the overall normalisation of each character. To satisfy the axioms of CFT we must choose a0,0 = 1 (non-degeneracy of the vacuum), while for each i 6= 0\n1This occurs in particular whenever a primary is complex, since its complex conjugate has the same character, but there are also more general cases of this phenomenon.\n2Some authors restrict the word \u201cmeromorphic\u201d to those CFT whose character is exactly modular invariant without a phase, and hence c is a multiple of 24. However in this work we will use the term for all one-character CFT, whose central charges can be any positive integral multiple of 8.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nwe define the integer Di = ai,0. Since the MLDE from which characters are obtained is homogeneous, the degeneracies are not uniquely determined without some additional input. One tentatively chooses the minimum integral Di that make the coefficients ai,s, s \u2265 1, of each character, non-negative integers and then checks for consistency. We discuss this point in some detail in section 2. In [23] VVMFs with the above properties were called \u201cadmissible\u201d. For any admissible VVMF, we define m1 = a0,1, the degeneracy of the first excited state in the identity character \u03c70. For a CFT, this corresponds to the number of spin-1 generators in the chiral algebra. The integers m1, Di, Yi will be important in what follows. In general, admissible characters do not correspond to a CFT, as we discuss in detail below. While much of the literature cited above has focused on classifying admissible characters, from the CFT point of view the result should be interpreted as a \u201csuperset\u201d of candidates of which actual CFTs form a subset. The problem of identifying this subset has been addressed in varying degrees of detail, for small numbers of characters, in [3, 17, 18, 20, 24, 27, 28, 35\u201339]. In the present work we take this goal forward by completing the classification of three-character CFT with vanishing Wronskian index (explained below) for any central charge, but excluding central charge = 8, 16 where the classification of admissible characters is itself problematic [21, 33\u201335]. The significance of our result is that we decisively rule in, or out, every admissible character as being a CFT by making an exhaustive list of bilinear pairings. In a different context, some recent work where the distinction between consistent partition functions and actual CFTs is highlighted is [40, 41]. An important quantity in the classification procedure is the number of zeroes of the Wronskian determinant of the characters in moduli space. Because the torus moduli space has cusps, the number of zeroes can be fractional in units of 16 . Hence we define the Wronskian index ` [2] to be an integer such that the number of zeroes is `6 . Certain values of ` can be ruled out \u2014 we have ` 6= 1 in general, ` even for n = 2 [4], ` a multiple of 3 for n = 3, and again ` even for n = 4 [33]. Our focus in this work is on admissible characters with (n, `) = (3, 0). Progress in classifying these was made in [3, 10, 17, 28] and more recently in three independent works: [33\u201335] which all found a set of seven new solutions that had previously been missed. Of these, the work of Kaidi, Lin and Parra-Martinez [33] was able to complete the classification of admissible characters using a method based on [42]. In view of their proof, the classification in [34] (originally restricted to c \u2264 96) is likewise complete. In the rest of this work we will closely follow the notation of this paper. There is one caveat to the above statements: there are infinitely many admissible (3, 0) characters at c = 8, 16 [27, 33\u201335] that are harder to classify and would need to be considered separately. In the present work we start with the complete set of admissible characters (excluding those with c = 8 and 16) and make use of the coset construction [17, 43, 44] to complete the classification of (n, `) = (3, 0) CFT. The cosets we consider are in the spirit of [17] where the numerator is a meromorphic CFT with c = 8N with N \u2208 N. However we go far beyond this work by exhaustively tabulating all possible bilinear pairings with a total central charge of c = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40. Notably, even at c = 24 we find interesting classes of pairings that were not considered in [17].\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nA significant spinoff of our coset pairings is that we can use them to predict several non-lattice meromorphic CFT at arbitrary high values of c = 8N . The results have been presented in [45] and here they are placed in a larger context. Moreover we will also rule out certain classes of meromorphic theories at c = 32, 40.\nReturning to the three-character case, the restriction on Wronskian index makes this in one sense a weaker classification than that of [39] for two primaries, where there was no restriction on the Wronskian index, but in one sense also stronger since the present work has no restriction on the central charge. This should finally bring closure to a programme for the \u201csimplest\u201d three-character theories (those with vanishing Wronskian index) that was initiated over three decades ago in [3]. By contrast, the analogous problem for two characters and vanishing Wronskian index was simple enough to solve in a single paper [2] with completeness being rigorously proved more recently [21].\nApart from the fact that we restrict the Wronskian index but not the central charge, the approach in the present work has some other important differences from [39]. Here we start from a given finite set of admissible characters, then look for bilinear coset-type relations for them based on their q-expansion. Thereafter we use embedding techniques to identify one of these as a CFT if the other one is known, We also allow any number of primaries as long as the number of characters (dimension of the VVMF) is three, while the rank (number of primaries or \u201csimple modules\u201d) can be larger. We do not impose unitarity, but always work with the unitary presentation of the characters (the most singular term is treated as defining the central charge).\nIn section 2 we start by describing the methodology used and provide a list of VVMFs that potentially describe three-character CFTs but were so far uncharacterised. Thereafter we summarise some relevant facts about embeddings, extensions of chiral algebras and bilinear or \u201cgluing\u201d relations. We also review a class of admissible characters that have formally negative fusion rules (as computed from the Verlinde formula [46], after extending if necessary the modular S-matrix to have the same rank as the number of primaries). Some of these have been identified as \u201cIntermediate Vertex Operator Algebras\u201d [14]. Section 3 is devoted to the detailed presentation of our results, with tables detailing the coset pairs at the level of VVMFs and descriptions of the tables that explain how individual entries are either identified with definite CFTs or ruled out. We summarise our results and discuss significant general features of our classification in section 4. At the very end we abstract a complete table of unitary CFTs with three characters and zero Wronskian index (excluding c = 8, 16 as mentioned above). The reader who is only interested in the results may skip directly to section 4.\nWhile this work was in progress we came to know of [36] which has significant overlap with table 8 of our paper which positively identifies 6 of the 41 previously uncharacterised solutions. However, in the present work we are also able to unambiguously categorise all the remaining 35 solutions, separating them into 20 that are of IVOA type and 15 that we can rule out as CFTs, completing the classification process. This process makes use of most of the remaining 20 tables in subsections 3.1\u20133.5. Also, as mentioned above, we find both positive and negative predictions for classes of meromorphic theories at c > 24.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3"

            "text": "As explained in the Introduction, the starting point of the classification procedure in which we are working is the construction of admissible characters using MLDEs. Here we explain some important subtleties in this construction and then go on to discuss the coset construction which we employ in the present work to characterise which admissible characters correspond to CFTs.\nBelow eq. (1.7) we defined the degeneracy Di of each non-identity character \u03c7i as the minimum integer such that the q-series for the corresponding character has non-negative integral coefficients. This assigns a tentative normalisation to each non-identity character. As explained in [3], the test of having found correct degeneracies Di is that the S-matrix in a basis of primaries is unitary. Note also that for an affine theory (WZW model), the degeneracy Di for a given \u03c7i is the dimension of the representation of the finite-dimensional Lie algebra in which the ith primary transforms, so in this case it is uniquely determined.\nIn view of these observations, at some stage it may be needed to change the degeneracy of a primary from the initially determined one to a multiple of itself. However the possibility of such a change is subject to a constraint. Suppose we have a solution to a given MLDE where the degeneracies Di as well as the multiplicities Yi have been tentatively determined (the Yis can be computed for MLDE solutions using the procedure given in [3]). If we redefine the Di by multiplying by an integer factor, the Yi will also change in such a way that the product YiD2i remains fixed. This can be seen by writing the partition function as:\nZ(\u03c4, \u03c4\u0304) = |\u03c70|2 + n\u22121\u2211 i=1 YiD 2 i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ( 1 + ai,1 ai,0 q + ai,2 ai,0 q2 + . . . )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 , (2.1)\nwhere everything except YiD2i is uniquely determined by the MLDE. Then modular invariance uniquely determines the YiD2i for each i. Thus the change Di \u2192 \u03b4iDi leads to the scaling Yi \u2192 Yi\u03b42i . The new Yi will be integer only if the old one was divisible by \u03b4 2 i . This is a stringent constraint \u2014 for any given pair Yi, Di, rescaling of Di is only allowed if the original Yi are divisible by the square of an integer. This point is illustrated in considerable detail in the discussion of table 8.\nIn fact there are MLDE solutions for which both Di and Yi cannot simultaneously be made integral. These cannot be CFTs and are marked with a \u201cstrikethrough\u201d in table 1 (thus they appear as III or V). We note that none of these solutions appears in [33], who presumably eliminated them at the outset for the above reasons, however some of them do appear in [35]. Interestingly even these VVMFs satisfy bilinear relations, and for completeness we display these in our subsequent tables where they continue to be marked with a \u201cstrikethrough\u201d. Though they are inconsistent as CFTs, it is still striking that they satisfy bilinear pairings at all, and this might prove useful for the general understanding of VVMFs.\nNext we describe one of our main tools, the coset construction [43, 44, 47]. This is a general class of relations among CFTs, and we will only use the class of cosets where the\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nnumerator factor of the coset is a meromorphic CFT, as we explain below.3 Pick a set of admissible characters \u03c7i, i = 0, 1, . . . n\u2212 1 and collectively denote it by W. Suppose this set has Wronskian index `, central charge c and conformal dimensions hi, i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7n\u2212 1. W will be said to have a \u201cbilinear relation\u201d with another set of admissible characters \u03c7\u0303i, collectively denoted W\u0303 , with i running over the same range and having Wronskian index \u02dc\u0300, central charge c\u0303 and conformal dimensions h\u0303i if the following holomorphic identity holds:\n\u03c70(\u03c4)\u03c7\u03030(\u03c4) + n\u22121\u2211 i=1 di \u03c7i(\u03c4)\u03c7\u0303i(\u03c4) = \u03c7H(\u03c4) (2.2)\nwhere \u03c7H(\u03c4) is a polynomial in the Klein j-invariant times possible factors of j(q) 13 or j(q) 23 , such that the result has non-negative integral coefficients in a power series in q \u2261 e2\u03c0i\u03c4 . Such a relation can only hold if \u03c7\u0303i(\u03c4) transforms the same way as the complex conjugate \u03c7i(\u03c4\u0304) under modular transformations. Then the di are positive integers satisfying:\n%\u2020diag(1, di)% = diag(1, di) (2.3)\nwhere \u03c1 is the representation under which the \u03c7i transform. From its properties, \u03c7H(\u03c4) is also an admissible character. It may potentially correspond to a meromorphic CFT of central charge c+ c\u0303, but it is not necessary that such a CFT exists. For example at c+ c\u0303 = 24 we have an infinite family of admissible characters but only a finite number correspond to CFT\u2019s [37]. Bilinear pairings are also known to hold for quasicharacters [23, 30] which are integral but not admissible due to negativity of some coefficients. Comparing eq. (2.3) with eq. (1.5) we see that we must have di = Yi. Physically this is because on the one hand the modular transformations of W,W are conjugate to each other (where W is the complex conjugate VVMF to W with characters \u03c7i(\u03c4\u0304)), so that the partition function is invariant. On the other hand the modular transformations of W, W\u0303 are also mutually conjugate, so that the bilinear relation is modular invariant \u2014 A slight subtlety here is that the bilinear relation can acquire a phase under modular transformations if cH = 24n+8, 24n+16 with n a non-negative integer. However this phase can be absorbed into the transformations of \u03c7\u0303 and it is still true that di = Yi. Note that if the degeneracies of one of the members of the pair (Di or D\u0303i) are not the correct ones then we may not find di = Yi. This will be a useful diagnostic in what follows. However there is another condition under which it is possible to have (d1, d2) 6= (Y1, Y2), that arises when the dual pair is made up of affine theories of the type D4n,1. In such cases the representation of SL(2,Z) on the characters is reducible (see v1 of [28]) and as a result there are multiple ways to combine the characters into a modular invariant. This will be explained in more detail in section 2.4. The bilinear relation eq. (2.2) does not imply that any of \u03c7(\u03c4), \u03c7\u0303(\u03c4), \u03c7H(\u03c4) correspond to a genuine CFT. However, if \u03c7, \u03c7\u0303 and H are all CFTs, denoted C, C\u0303 and H respectively, then the bilinear relation is equivalent to the coset relation:\nC\u0303 = H C\n(2.4)\n3This is the form studied in the physics literature in [17, 18, 36, 39] and in the mathematics literature in, for example, [48\u201350].\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nThis means that the chiral algebra of C\u0303 is the commutant of the embedding of the chiral algebra of C in that of H. The representations of the commutant algebra also follow from this embedding, hence the coset completely defines a CFT. If both C and H correspond to CFT\u2019s whose stress tensor is given by the Sugawara construction in terms of Kac-Moody currents, then by embedding the currents of C in those of H one defines the stress tensor of the coset theory C\u0303. This will provide a relatively easy way to prove the existence of a coset relation [17]. However it is also possible for eq. (2.2) to be satisfied when H does not have any Kac-Moody currents (an example is the Monster Module [51, 52]). In this case the coset construction of [43, 47] does not strictly apply, but the more general one of [44] does. In these cases it is easier to verify the bilinear relation rather than compute the commutant of C in H. One such example, studied in the context of MLDE and holomorphic bilinear relations [18] arises when C is the Ising model and C\u0303 is the Baby Monster CFT [49]. The existence of bilinear relations between an admissible solutionW , another admissible solution W\u0303 and an invariant (up to a phase) character \u03c7H provides us a number of ways to decide whether given admissible characters do or do not correspond to CFT. These are as follows:\n\u2022 When W and \u03c7H are both known CFTs C,H, the bilinear relation suggests that W\u0303 may correspond to one or more CFTs C\u0303. This can then be accurately confirmed by checking for the existence of one or more suitable embeddings of C in H that would define C\u0303.\n\u2022 When W, W\u0303 are both known CFTs C, C\u0303, we may conclude that the character \u03c7H corresponds to a CFT H that can be called the \u201cgluing\u201d of C, C\u0303.4 Several new meromorphic CFT were recently discovered in this way in [45].5\n\u2022 When a bilinear relation exists and W is a CFT C, but the character \u03c7H is known not to correspond to a CFT, the bilinear partner W\u0303 cannot be a CFT. For if it were, then the bilinear relation would predict that \u03c7H is a CFT, resulting in a contradiction.\n\u2022 When a bilinear relation holds and W corresponds to a CFT C but W\u0303 is known not to correspond to any CFT, it can sometimes be argued that \u03c7H does not describe a CFT. The naive reasoning is that if \u03c7H were a CFT H, then by taking the coset H/C we would define a CFT C\u0303 corresponding to the admissible character W\u0303 , resulting in a contradiction. However a certain condition needs to be satisfied in this case, so we will explain the statement more precisely in the discussion on table 16 where it is implemented for the first time.\nWe see that the bilinear relation is a powerful diagnostic tool for relating admissible characters to CFT or ruling them out as being CFT.\n4Rigorously this is true for CFTs with up to 4 primaries, for which the Modular Tensor Category is unique given the modular transformations of the characters [53].\n5However, again for cases involving D4n,1, there can be ways to pair C, C\u0303 that do not lead to a meromorphic theory because the coefficients di in the pairing are not integral. We will remark on these as they are encountered.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nLet us note here that the recent work [36] also makes use of the coset construction to identify some admissible three-character solutions as CFT, however there are some differences in the criteria used. We will comment on the cases of overlap as we go along. In [17] the following relation between the data of characters \u03c7i and their coset dual \u03c7\u0303i was derived:\n`+ \u02dc\u0300= n2 + ( c+ c\u0303 4 \u2212 1 ) n\u2212 6 n\u22121\u2211 i=1 (hi + h\u0303i) (2.5)\nHere we are interested in the case n = 3. Because c+ c\u0303 must be a multiple of 8, we write it as 8N where N is an integer.6 Since the right hand side of the bilinear relation is a character with integer dimensions (up to an overall power of q), we must have hi + h\u0303i = ni, an integer \u2265 1, for each i. Thus the above relation can be written:\n`+ \u02dc\u0300= 6 ( N + 1\u2212\nn\u22121\u2211 i=1 ni\n) (2.6)\nAs both `, \u02dc\u0300\u2265 0 we have the bound: n\u22121\u2211 i=1 ni \u2264 N + 1 (2.7)\nIf this bound is saturated it means ` = \u02dc\u0300 = 0 and we have the possibility of dual (3, 0) pairs. Thus we will proceed by listing all possible values ni that saturate the bound for each N , and then classifying dual pairs with these ni. This technical point is of importance because it seems to have been missed in much of the previous literature, starting with [17] that only considered a special sub-class of cosets where each ni \u2265 2. More general cosets of meromorphic theories were studied recently, and apparently for the first time, in [39] in the context of theories with exactly two primaries. The values of ni have considerable significance for the structure of the bilinear pair, which we now explain. Suppose a bilinear relation holds between CFTs C, C\u0303 with Kac-Moody algebras h, h\u0303, and they pair up to a CFT H with Kac-Moody algebra g. Then h\u0303 must be the commutant of h in g. Now suppose that for any of i = 1, 2 we have ni = 1. This means that some spin-1 currents in the theory H arise as \u201ccomposites\u201d of primaries in C, C\u0303. This in turn means the total number of spin-1 currents of C, C\u0303 is strictly smaller than that of H, in other words dim h + dim h\u0303 < dim g, so the embedding of h in g is a non-trivial one \u2014 typically h is embedded into a simple factor of g. Such cases were discussed for the case of two primaries in [39]. On the other hand whenever all ni \u2265 2, no currents of H can arise as composites of primaries of C, C\u0303. Therefore we have dim h + dim h\u0303 = dim g. This can only happen if g is non-simple and h corresponds to one or more of its simple factors. Such cases were first studied in [17], and they are simpler because the coset merely \u201cdeletes\u201d the simple factors of g corresponding to h leaving behind the remaining simple factors as the chiral algebra h\u0303 of the coset theory. At this point it is useful to briefly describe how the concept of \u201cfusion rules\u201d applies to VVMFs even before they are identified with CFT. In the MLDE approach to classification\n6In [17] the convention was to write c + c\u0303 = 24N where N is a multiple of 13 .\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nof RCFT, one first finds admissible character solutions that transform covariantly under SL(2,Z) and only later addresses their identification with CFT. Thus we can calculate their modular S and T matrices at the outset. Inserting the S-matrix into the Verlinde formula [46] one can then compute the following quantities:7\nNkij = \u2211 l SilSjlS \u22121 kl S0l (2.8)\nAs long as the Sij are only a property of admissible characters, the quantities Nkij have no particular physical meaning. But once the characters are identified with CFTs then these quantities necessarily become the fusion rules of that theory. Hence by abuse of notation we will refer to Nkij as \u201cfusion rules\u201d even when no CFT interpretation has so far been assigned to the corresponding characters. An important point that will come up below is that sometimes one or more of the Nkij is a negative, rather than positive, integer. We refer to such characters as being of Intermediate Vertex Operator Algebra (IVOA) type, following [14]. We now give a short summary of the complete classification of admissible VVMF\u2019s with three characters and ` = 0 (the characters are extracted from the most recent papers [33\u201335] and expressed in the notation of [34]), referring the reader to the original references for more details. The admissible character sets fall into five categories, labelled I, II, . . . ,V. Let us briefly review what the various categories mean.\nCategory I. The admissible VVMFs belonging to this category are all 3-character theories that are affine or tensor products of affine theories, together with the Ising CFT M(4, 3) and the unitary presentations8 ofM(7, 2) andM(5, 2)\u22972.\nCategory II. Most of these are admissible 2-character solutions together with an \u201cunstable\u201d character (or sometimes an admissible 1-character solution together with two \u201cunstable\u201d characters). By unstable, we mean that this character has rational coefficients in its q-series that cannot be made integral by any choice of normalisation. Such a case was first discussed in [2] and more general examples were found in [34]. There are also some type II cases where the conformal dimensions degenerate \u2014 two of them become equal \u2014 and in this case the MLDE has a logarithmic solution. Due to these reasons, type-II VVMFs are not genuine 3-character solutions and we do not explore them further.\nCategory III. The admissible VVMFs belonging to this category are those solutions of the (3,0) MLDE which appeared in [28] but not in [17] and hence were not previously categorised as CFT. In this category, there exists special infinite sets of solutions, at c = 8 and c = 16 that we explain in appendix B. We will not attempt to include these in our classification, though some of the known cases will appear in our tables.\n7This can only be done once a unitary S-matrix has been found. In general S does not come out to be unitary, this problem arises when multiple primaries have the same character. In that case the space of primaries has to be manually enlarged and the S-matrix recomputed in that space, as explained in [3].\n8By unitary presentation we mean the choice of the most singular character as the identity. However, this does not imply there is a unitary theory.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nCategory IV. The admissible VVMFs belonging to this category are those solutions of the (3,0) MLDE which appeared in [17, 18] where they were precisely characterised as CFTs via the coset construction.\nCategory V. There are seven admissible VVMFs in this category, these were independently discovered in [33\u201335] and not known previously.\nWe see that all entries in categories I, II, IV have already been identified as CFT\u2019s or else shown to be inconsistent [34]. Thus we need to focus on the characterisation of classes III and V which so far have not been identified as CFTs. To characterise them, we will study their bilinear relations with solutions in category I and IV (and amongst themselves).\nIn table 1 we have listed all solutions in categories III,9 (except for the infinite sets having c = 8 and c = 16 noted above) and V. The subscripts label the set in order of increasing central charge, thus for example V18 (c = 12) lies between III17 (c = 12) and III19 (c = 252 ). As explained below eq. (1.6), the integer m1 is the dimension of the weight-1 space in the identity character, while Di, i = 1, 2 are the ground-state degeneracies of the non-identity characters.\nNote from this table that none of the entries contains a primary with integer conformal dimension, or a pair that differ in dimension by an integer. For this reason it is not possible to make a non-diagonal modular invariant from the characters, justifying our choice in eq. (1.2) to consider only diagonal invariants.\nIn the last column of table 1, labelled \u201csign(fusion)\u201d, we list the signature of the fusion coefficients of the concerned VVMF, computed using eq. (2.8). However we do not bother to compute these for solutions of III, V type. Also, as noted earlier this computation requires us to enlarge the matrix in cases where there are more than three primaries, and this rapidly becomes tedious. So we restrict this calculation to solutions that have at most four primaries. The notation \u2018\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2019 in the last column of the table denotes that we did not compute the fusion coefficients of these solutions for one of the reasons above. Fortunately these will also not be needed. In the remaining cases a \u2018+\u2019 sign in the last column denotes that all the fusion coefficients are non-negative while a \u2018\u2212\u2019 sign denotes that at least one coefficient is negative. The latter will be called IVOA-type solutions, and we discuss them in more detail in section 2.5.\nIn table 2, we list the category III infinite sets of admissible character solutions at c = 8 and c = 16. More details on these infinite sets are in appendix B.\nAs mentioned above, the tables in the following sections will include the III and V entries in table 1 even though they are already ruled out from being CFTs. For completeness, our tables will also include some already characterised theories from [34], as their bilinear pairings are interesting and could be useful for subsequent work.\n9Note that III27 in table 1 is actually E\u229727.5 and was identified in [34] as a category I solution. However it has a negative fusion rule and therefore is of IVOA type. Here we include it in category III as it will pair up with other IVOA-type characters in this category.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) (Y1, Y2) sign(fusion) III1 127 ( 2 7 , 3 7 ) 6 (3, 2) (1,1) \u2212 III2 125 ( 1 5 , 3 5 ) 3 (3, 5) (1,2) + III3 447 ( 4 7 , 5 7 ) 88 (11, 44) (1,1) \u2212 III4 365 ( 3 5 , 4 5 ) 144 (12, 45) (1,2) \u2212 III5 527 ( 4 7 , 6 7 ) 156 (13, 78) (1,1) \u2212 III6 172 ( 1 16 , 3 2 ) 255 (17, 221) ( 1 256 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III7 607 ( 3 7 , 8 7 ) 210 (10, 285) (1,1) \u2212 III8 445 ( 2 5 , 6 5 ) 220 (11, 275) (1,2) \u2212 III9 445 ( 1 5 , 7 5 ) 253 (11, 242) ( 1 50 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nIII10 9 ( 18 , 3 2 ) 261 (9, 456) ( 1 32 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III11 192 ( 3 16 , 3 2 ) 266 (19, 703) ( 1 64 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III12 687 ( 3 7 , 9 7 ) 221 (17, 782) (1,1) \u2212 III13 10 ( 14 , 3 2 ) 270 (5, 960) ( 1 2 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III14 212 ( 5 16 , 3 2 ) 273 (21, 1225) ( 1 16 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III15 11 ( 38 , 3 2 ) 275 (11, 1496) ( 1 2 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III16 232 ( 7 16 , 3 2 ) 276 (23, 1771) ( 1 4 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III17 12 ( 35 , 7 5 ) 222 (25, 1275) (2, 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nV18 12 ( 13 , 5 3 ) 318 (9, 4374) (1, 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nIII19 252 ( 9 16 , 3 2 ) 275 (25, 2325) (1,1) + III20 13 ( 58 , 3 2 ) 273 (26, 2600) (2,1) + III21 272 ( 11 16 , 3 2 ) 270 (54, 2871) (1,1) + III22 685 ( 4 5 , 7 5 ) 136 (119, 1700) (1,2) + III23 685 ( 2 5 , 9 5 ) 374 (119, 12138) ( 1 50 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III24 1007 ( 5 7 , 11 7 ) 325 (55, 2925) (1,1) \u2212 III25 1007 ( 4 7 , 12 7 ) 380 (55, 11495) (1,1) \u2212 III26 292 ( 13 16 , 3 2 ) 261 (116, 3393) (1,1) + III27 765 ( 4 5 , 8 5 ) 380 (57, 3249) (2,1) \u2212 III28 765 ( 3 5 , 9 5 ) 437 (57, 11875) (1, 2) \u2212 III29 1087 ( 6 7 , 11 7 ) 378 (117, 3510) (1,1) \u2212 III30 1087 ( 4 7 , 13 7 ) 456 (39, 20424) (1,1) \u2212 III31 332 ( 17 16 , 3 2 ) 231 (528, 4301) (1,1) + III32 1167 ( 8 7 , 10 7 ) 348 (725, 1972) (1,1) \u2212 III33 845 ( 6 5 , 7 5 ) 336 (770, 1452) (2,1) \u2212 III34 845 ( 1 5 , 12 5 ) 534 (33, 55924) ( 2 625 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III35 1247 ( 9 7 , 10 7 ) 248 (2108, 2108) (1,1) \u2212 III36 18 ( 14 , 5 2 ) 598 (25, 221 \u00b7 210) ( 1 32 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 III37 925 ( 6 5 , 8 5 ) 92 (1196, 7475) (1,2) + III38 925 ( 3 5 , 11 5 ) 690 (299, 178802) ( 2 25 , 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nOne of the intriguing features that will come up is that Virasoro minimal models with c < 1 appear in the coset pairings, thus making it clear that the coset construction is more general than pairings of theories with Kac-Moody symmetry.

            "heading": "2.2 Embeddings of Lie algebras",
            "text": "In this section, we gather facts from Lie algebras, affine Lie algebras etc that we will need to understand coset relations. Typically, the CFTs of H and C (2.4) have chiral algebras which contain affine Lie-subalgebras, whose Lie algebras are such that the Lie algebra associated with C is a subalgebra of that of H. Denote by h \u21aa\u2192 g the corresponding embedding. Here both the subalgebra h as well as the embedding map are crucial data. The same subalgebra can be embedded in multiple ways and can potentially result in different cosets; we will see examples of this phenomenon in the next section. First we study maximal embeddings; when there is no Lie-subalgebra of g that properly contains h. There are two kinds of maximal embeddings: regular (R) and special (S). The rank of h is equal to that of g in a regular embedding and is smaller in a special embedding. One can obtain the regular and special embeddings of simple Lie algebras readily from the literature; we use the LieArt 2.0 package (see [54]) in Mathematica to obtain all possible maximal embeddings of a given Lie algebra. For example E8 has five regular maximal embeddings, namely D8, A4 \u2295A4, E6 \u2295A2, E7 \u2295A1 and A8 and six special embeddings, namely G2 \u2295 F4, A1 \u2295A2, C2, A1, A1 and A1. The last three correspond to A1 embedded into E8 in three different ways; one way to characterize this difference is via the embedding index, which we discuss below. After having understood maximal embeddings, one studies non-maximal embeddings as follows. Let l \u21aa\u2192 h and h \u21aa\u2192 g be maximal embeddings. By composing the two embedding maps, one obtains a non-maximal embedding l \u21aa\u2192 g and all non-maximal embeddings are obtained in this manner, in steps of maximal embeddings. Now given an embedding h \u21aa\u2192 g, maximal or non-maximal, there exists an important quantity called the embedding index xe \u2208 N which can be computed as follows. Pick any non-trivial irrep of g say \u039bg and consider its branching\n\u039bg = \u2295i \u039bhi , (2.9)\nwhere \u039bhi s are irreps of h. The embedding index is then computed using the formula:\nxe =\n\u2211 i L ( \u039bhi )\nL (\u039bg) , (2.10)\nwhere L ( \u039bhi ) denotes the Dynkin index of the irrep \u039bhi . Note that even if xe is computed in (2.10) using a particular irrep and its branching (2.9), one obtains the same answer for any finite-dimensional irrep. For example, the embedding indices of the various subalgebras (occuring in the maximal embeddings) of E8 are given below in superscript. For regular embeddings we have D(1)8 , A (1) 4 \u2295A (1) 4 , E (1) 6 \u2295A (1) 2 , E (1) 7 \u2295A (1) 1 and A (1) 8 and for special embeddings we have G(1)2 \u2295 F (1) 4 , A (16) 1 \u2295A (6) 2 , C (12) 2 , A (520) 1 , A (760) 1 and A (1240) 1 . Computations of branching rules, Dynkin indices, embedding indices etc are performed using LieArt 2.0 ([54]).\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nThe relationship between the affine Lie algebras associated with the CFTs of H and C in (2.4) can now be made explicit. For affine embeddings of the form, hk\u0303 \u21aa\u2192 gk, the levels follow the rule (see section 14.7 of [55]):\nk\u0303 = k xe. (2.11)\nThus, for example, when H = E8,1, some possibilities for C are D8,1, A4,1, E6,1, E7,1, A1,1, A2,1, G2,1, F4,1.\nConvention. Throughout this paper, we think of the Ising CFTM(4, 3) as B0,1, A1,2 as B1,1, C2,1 as B2,1, U(1) (with the appropriate radius) as D1,1, A\u229721,1 as D2,1 and A3,1 as D3,1."

Its n-character extension, denoted by En[gk], is a new theory where the chiral algebra has been extended by adding new generators. The theories based on gk and En[gk] have the same c. The characters of the extension are linear combinations of characters of the original theory that differ in dimension by integers and as a result the extension will have fewer characters than the original affine theory. It also has a different Wronskian index in general. Note that a given affine theory may have more than one extension. One can also consider extensions of more general chiral algebras. For example, a direct product of Kac-Moody and c < 1 Virasoro minimal models can be extended in the same way. If there is a single minimal model module of central charge c, we will denote the extension by En[g \u2297 L(c)] and similarly for the more general case.

            "text": "As we saw above, coset relations between a pair of CFTs (C and C\u0303) or admissible characters (W and W\u0303) are bilinear relations between characters of the form:\n\u03c7H = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + 2\u2211 i=1 di \u03c7i\u03c7\u0303i. (2.12)\nHere, \u03c70, \u03c71, \u03c72 are the characters of W and \u03c7\u03030, \u03c7\u03031, \u03c7\u03032 are the characters of W\u0303 . (d1, d2) are positive integers. \u03c7H0 is the character of a meromorphic CFT. Sometimes we have the situation of \u201cself-cosets\u201d when the same CFT/admissible character solution is both W as well as W\u0303 . Also sometimes (as we will see this happens when D4n,1 are involved) there may be more than one pairing of the same sets of characters: one with \u03c70 = \u03c7\u03030, \u03c71 = \u03c7\u03031, \u03c72 = \u03c7\u03032, which results in a standard bilinear relation as in (2.12) with a pair of positive integers (d1, d2), and one or more distinct ones when the characters are paired differently as described below. In eq. (2.12), the characters \u03c7i and \u03c7\u0303i are understood to be properly normalised with integral ground-state degeneracies and multiplicities that have been determined. Let the multiplicities of \u03c7i, \u03c7\u0303i be Yi, Y\u0303i. Since the standard coset pairing is a pairing at the level of primaries these two multiplicities must be the same for each i. Moreover, by modular\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\ninvariance it follows that the integers di in the bilinear relation are also equal to these multiplicities, thus di = Yi = Y\u0303i. Hence from now on, we use di to denote both Yi and Y\u0303i whenever the pairing is of standard type. We will comment on the non-standard pairings as and when they arise. We now describe in detail three infinite families of coset pairs of CFTs and compute their (d1, d2) values. Members of these families will occur often amongst the many coset relations between (3, 0) admissible characters that we compute and tabulate in the next section. In one of the families below the non-standard pairings will also be illustrated.\nExample 1. We start with the case where the meromorphic CFT is the E8,1 CFT and the coset pairs are B3,1 and B4,1. E8 contains a regular maximal sub-algebra D8 which contains a special maximal sub-algebra B3 \u2295B4. Thus B3 \u2295B4 \u21aa\u2192 E8 constitutes a non-maximal embedding. One finds that the commutant of B3 in E8 is B4 and vice versa. This then means that if B3 is taken to be the Lie algebra associated to the denominator theory C in (2.4), then the Lie algebra associated to the coset theory C\u0303 would be B4. After computing embedding indices and levels, this means that the coset of E8,1 by B3,1 is B4,1 CFT, and vice versa.\nThe characters of B3,1 and B4,1 satisfy a bilinear relation with \u03c7H = j 1 3 :\nj 1 3 = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + d1 \u03c7 1\n2 \u03c7\u0303 1 2 + d2 \u03c7 7 16 \u03c7\u0303 9 16 (2.13)\nWe can compute the (d1, d2) values for this relation using Lie algebra representation theory. For this, let us count spin-1 currents on both sides. On the l.h.s. we have the 248 currents of E8 spanning the adjoint representation. This representation decomposes as follows into irreducible representations of B3 \u2295B4:\n248 = (21,1)\u2295 (1,36)\u2295 (7,9)\u2295 (8,16) (2.14)\nThis means that on the r.h.s. of eq. (2.13), the 248 currents come from: (i) 21 spin-1 currents of B3,1 combined with the identity from B4,1, (ii) 36 spin-1 currents of B4,1 combined with the identity from B3,1, (iii) the product of primaries in the 7 and 9 representations of B3 and B4, (iv) the product of primaries in the 8 and 16 spinor representations of B3 and B4 respectively. Of these, (i) and (ii) can be found in the first term of eq. (2.13), (iii) in the second term and (iv) in the third term. Since there are no multiplicities in the above decomposition, it follows that d1 = d2 = 1. This example is a special case of a more general phenomenon where the meromorphic CFT is the one-character extension E1[Dr,1] for r = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 . . . of which E8,1 is the c = 8 case. The single character of each of these CFTs is the modular invariant obtained by combining the identity character \u03c70 (which at level-1 contains the adjoint representation 2r2 \u2212 r of Dr) and the character \u03c7 r8 for the spinor representation 2\nr\u22121 of Dr. We will find several coset pairs of admissible characters that correspond to the CFTs C = Br1,1 and C\u0303 = Br2,1 for r1 + r2 + 1 \u2261 r where r is a multiple of 8, that satisfy the following bilinear relation to the above meromorphic extension of Dr,1:\n\u03c7 E1[Dr,1] 0 = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + d1 \u03c7 12 \u03c7\u0303 12 + d2 \u03c7 2r1+116 \u03c7\u0303 2r2+116 (2.15)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nThe relevant Lie algebra representation content of each of its terms comes from the following two relations:\n2r2 \u2212 r = (2r21 + r1,1)\u2295 (1,2r22 + r2)\u2295 (2r1 + 1,2r2 + 1) 2r\u22121 = (2r1 ,2r2)\n(2.16)\nNow the first two terms on the right hand side of the first line of (2.16) give rise to the spin-1 contributions in the product of identity characters (first term of eq. (2.15)), while the third term gives rise to the spin-1 contributions in the product of the characters in the fundamental representations (second term of eq. (2.15)). Meanwhile the spinor of Dr decomposes into the product of spinor reprsentations of Br1 , Br2 (second line of eq. (2.16)) and this corresponds to the last term in eq. (2.15) (note that this contribution in general has spin r8 rather than 1). It follows that d1 = 1, d2 = 1. We also learn that the dimensions of the spinors of the coset pair add up to r8 rather than 1, and this corresponds to the integer n2 defined in eq. (2.6). The commutant of Br1 inside Dr1+r2+1 is Br2 (because there is a special maximal embedding B(1)r1 \u2295B (1) r2 \u21aa\u2192 Dr1+r2+1) so we can identify Br1,1 with the denominator theory C with E1[Dr1+r2+1,1] as the numerator theory H and Br2,1 as the coset theory C\u0303. Of course one can also exchange the roles of Br1 and Br2 .\nExample 2. Another infinite family of coset pairs is Dr1,1 and Dr2,1 pairing up in a bilinear relation with a meromorphic extension E1[Dr,1] where r = r1 + r2 is a multiple of 8. The affine theory Dr,1 has three characters: the identity character \u03c70, the vector character \u03c7 1\n2 with conformal dimension 12 and the spinor and conjugate spinor (two representations with the same character) \u03c7 r 8 with conformal dimension r8 . The bilinear relation for the coset pair of Dr1,1 and Dr2,1 is:\n\u03c7 E1[Dr,1] 0 = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + d1 \u03c7 12 \u03c7\u0303 12 + d2 \u03c7 r18 \u03c7\u0303 r28 (2.17)\nand the Lie algebra representations decompose as:\n2r2 \u2212 r = (2r21 \u2212 r1,1) + (1,2r22 \u2212 r2) + (2r1,2r2) 2r\u22121 = (2r1\u22121,2r2\u22121) + (2r1\u22121,2r2\u22121)\n(2.18)\nThe first two terms on the right hand side of the first line in (2.18) are associated with the product of the identity characters while the third term corresponds to the product of the characters in the fundamental representations (hence d1 = 1), and these terms are associated to spin-1 generators on both sides. The two terms on the right hand side of the second line in (2.18) correspond to the product of the characters in the spinor representations and since there are two terms we find d2 = 2. These are associated to spin- r8 generators. Finally we note that the commutant of Dr1 inside Dr1+r2 is Dr2 (because there is a regular maximal embedding D(1)r1 \u2295D (1) r2 \u21aa\u2192 Dr1+r2) which means we can choose Dr1,1 for the denominator theory C with E1[Dr1+r2,1] as the numerator theory H and get Dr2,1 for the coset theory C\u0303; again the roles of Dr1 , Dr2 can be exchanged. Interestingly, when r1, r2 are both multiples of 4 there is another way to pair them up to a meromorphic theory that is not Dr1+r2,1. As an example, consider the pair D12,1, D12,1\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n(both members of this pair are the same, but that is irrelevant to the discussion). The non-trivial conformal dimensions for each factor are 12 , 3 2 . Of these, the latter \u2014 the spinor representation \u2014 occurs twice because of chirality. Thus (Y1, Y2) = (1, 2). We find that they have a bilinear pairing to the meromorphic theory D24,1 as discussed in subsection 3.3. This is consistent with the fact that:\nE [D24,1] D12,1 = D12,1 (2.19)\nIn this pairing, the vector primaries with h = 12 of each D12,1 pair up to make (24)2 = 576 spin-1 fields that, together with the 276 generators of each D12, make up the 1128 generators of D24. This is a special case of the counting above. This pairing relies on the existence of a modular-invariant extension of D24 which is a general phenomenon for all D8n. We may therefore consider this a \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d pairing. However we also find another coset pairing in which the vector representation with h = 12 for each D12 combines with one of the spinors with h = 3 2 of the other as shown in table 8. We see that this time new spin-2 generators arise, but no new spin-1 generators are created. As a result the meromorphic theory formed by this pairing still has Kac-Moody algebra (D12,1)\u22972. The pairing is:\n\u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c7 1 2 \u03c7\u0303 3 2 + \u03c7 3 2 \u03c7\u0303 1 2 = \u03c7E1[(D12,1)\u22972] = j(\u03c4)\u2212 192 (2.20)\nand corresponds to the coset: E [(D12,1)\u22972]\nD12,1 = D12,1 (2.21)\nIt exists because of the special modular invariant E1[(D12,1)\u22972] which is entry 66 of [37]. Notice that in eq. (2.20) not all primaries are used, since each spinor occurs only once rather than twice as in the affine theory D12,1. Comparing with eq. (2.12) it seems that we effectively have (d1, d2) = (1, 1), and therefore (d1, d2) 6= (Y1, Y2), but a better way to think of it is that for such special pairings, (d1, d2) are not associated to multiplicities of primaries at all. This point becomes clearer if we consider two copies of D16,1 which pair up in two different ways to a meromorphic c = 32 theory, corresponding to the distinct cosets:\nE1[D32,1] D16,1 = D16,1, E1[(D16,1)\u22972] D16,1 = D16,1 (2.22)\nNow D16,1 has (h1, h2) = (12 , 2) and hence there seems to be only one bilinear pairing involving the vector representation having h1 = 12 , where it pairs with itself. The result is easily seen to be E1[D32,1]. One may then wonder what is the other pairing leading to the second coset. The resolution is that in the other pairing we skip the vector representation entirely and take the modular-invariant combination (up to a phase) \u03c70 + \u03c72 as the single character of each factor, then multiply them. The resulting bilinear relation is:\n(\u03c70 + \u03c72)(\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c7\u03032) = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c70\u03c7\u03032 + \u03c72\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c72\u03c7\u03032 = \u03c7(E1[D16,1]) 2 = j(\u03c4) + 248 (2.23)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nThus in this example the meromorphic extension of the square is actually the square of a meromorphic extension of each factor \u2014 and the corresponding 32-dimensional lattice is the direct sum of two independent 16d lattices (this was not true for the two ways of pairing D12,1 however, where the resulting extension is not the product of extensions). In this situation we again see that the numbers (d1, d2) are not meaningful per se and should not be compared to (Y1, Y2). Fortunately, as emphasised above, this issue arises only for coset pairs involving affine theories of type D4r,1.\nExample 3. The third and last example of an infinite family of coset relations is based on the maximal special embedding B(1)r\u22121 \u21aa\u2192 Dr. The commutant of Br\u22121 inside Dr is trivial; one can see this from the fact that the branching rule for the adjoint representation of Dr contains no singlets. This means that when E1[Dr, 1] is taken to be the numerator theory H and Br\u22121,1 as the denominator theory C, then the coset theory C\u0303 is a CFT with a chiral algebra containing no Kac-Moody currents. Comparing central charges, we see that this CFT has c = 12 . Since it is unitary, it has to be the Ising CFT, equivalently the M(4, 3) Virasoro minimal model. We thus have the coset pair, Br\u22121,1 and M(4, 3); its bilinear relation is:\n\u03c7 E1[Dr,1] 0 = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + d1 \u03c7 12 \u03c7\u03031 + d2 \u03c7 2r\u2212116 \u03c7\u03032 (2.24)\nwhere \u03c7\u03030, \u03c7\u03031, \u03c7\u03032 are the characters of the Ising model. The Lie algebra representation content is:\nr(2r\u2212 1) = (r\u2212 1)(2r\u2212 1)\u2295 2r\u2212 1 (2.25)\nAdditionally the spinor representation 2r\u22121 of Dr goes directly into the spinor of the same dimension for Br\u22121. Matching the dimensions of the representations in (2.25) and comparing with (2.24) we conclude that d1 = 1, d2 = 1. The coset pair relations amongst (3, 0) admissible characters feature this example for r = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40. This family of examples can be subsumed under Example 1 above if we denote the Ising CFT by B0,1. Following the standard formulae for Br,1 we see that B0,1 should have c = 12 , h1 = 1 2 , h2 = 1 16 which is precisely the Ising model."

For these, some of the fusion rules derived from the modular S-matrices via the Verlinde formula [46] turned out to be negative integers. In general these cannot be identified with unitary CFT, though in a few special cases one can exchange characters to find a non-unitary \u2014 but otherwise genuine \u2014 CFT [3]. Such characters do share a number of good properties with RCFT and are of some mathematical interest. Hence we include them in our classification.10 Whether these can be precisely said to be IVOA is beyond the scope of the present work, so we will simply identify them as \u201cpotentially of IVOA-type\u201d and put them in separate tables.\n10IVOA-type characters have also been included in the work of [33, 35].\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nIt is important to realise that having negative fusion rules is quite distinct from nonunitarity.

Exchanging the choice of identity characters sometimes (but not always) converts an IVOA to a consistent but non-unitary CFT. We will find several admissible characters of IVOA type that pair up via bilinear relations into a modular invariant.11 Our policy when encountering such characters will be to list them separately in tables. They are listed in our conclusions but do not appear in our final list of CFTs, table 28. Determining whether they are consistent IVOA\u2019s within the definitions of [14] is left for future work."

            "text": "In this section, we tabulate the bilinear relations that exist between pairs of admissible character-like solutions and then discuss what this tells us about possible identification of the solutions with CFTs. To begin with, we list all pairs W \u2194 W\u0303 which satisfy c+ c\u0303 = 8N and hi + h\u0303i = ni \u2208 Z \u2200 i \u2208 {1, 2}. Such a list a priori includes some pairs whose bilinear relation has rational, rather than integral, di. We then rule out such pairs as inconsistent since they do not satisfy a valid bilinear relation even at the level of characters. That leaves us with pairs that satisfy the bilinear relations with integral di. In such cases, sometimes we know that the meromorphic character to which they pair up is not a genuine CFT. Then it follows that at least one of the pair is not a consistent CFT. If the meromorphic theory does exist, then we perform a case-by-case analysis and try to explain the bilinear relations from the point of view of Lie algebra embeddings. If, for a coset pair, such an embedding exists, then we can readily find the affine subalgebra corresponding to the new theory and show that its extension leads to the new theory by computing its characters as linear combinations of the affine characters. Then we can declare it to be a genuine CFT. On the other hand when there does not exist an embedding, then again one member of the pair is not a CFT. All the remaining cases turn out to be of \u201cIVOA type\u201d, namely the fusion rules computed from the modular S matrix have at least one negative value. These are inconsistent within the class of normal CFTs but may make sense as IVOAs, hence we list them separately. Notably all characters of IVOA type pair up into bilinear relations only with each other. In short, all possible admissible characters that we started with get classified into three groups: (i) CFT, (ii) positive fusion rules but still not CFT, (iii) IVOA type."

Hence we consider all admissible characters from [34] with c < 8. For any of them, call it W with central charge\n11For two characters, a bilinear pairing between IVOA-type characters of c = 25 and c = 118 5 is easily seen from appendix B.2 of [23].\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nand conformal dimensions (c, h1, h2), we ask if there is another admissible character W\u0303 with central charge and conformal dimensions (8 \u2212 c, 1 \u2212 h1, 1 \u2212 h2). For each such pair W, W\u0303 , we then ask if their characters satisfy a coset bilinear relation (2.12) and if they do, we would have computed the values of (d1, d2) defined in these equations. We collect the details of these coset bilinear relations in two tables, 3, 4. It is remarkable that every (3, 0) admissible character with c < 8 is part of a coset relation and is featured somewhere in these tables; this is not necessarily the case for c > 8.\nComments on table 3. This table contains 10 bilinear pairings. Each of these is consistent, as we will recount below \u2014 in other words both members of every pair are genuine CFTs. Row 1 is a special case of Example 3 of section 2.4, namely (2.24), (2.25) for r = 8 (note that E1[D8,1] = E8,1). On general grounds, we know that (i) since the B7 of the denominator theory has a trivial commutant in E8, the coset must have no Kac-Moody symmetries, and (ii) the central charge of the coset must be 12 . Unitarity then implies that the coset theory is indeed the Ising CFT, as we also explicitly verify. We will see more examples of this phenomenon later \u2014 that the coset H/C, where both H and C have Kac-Moody symmetries, results in a CFT with no Kac-Moody symmetries, in this case a minimal model. Because of the way it naturally arises as a special case of the Br,1 Kac-Moody algebras, we will often denote the Ising model by B0,1 in what follows. Rows 2, 4, 7 are special cases of Example 2 of section 2.4, namely (2.17), (2.18) for r = 8. We thus have E8,1D3,1 \u223c= D5,1 or E8,1D5,1 \u223c= D3,1. The (d1, d2) values follow the predictions from decomposing the representation as explained in section 2.4. Rows 3, 6, 8 are special cases of Example 1 of section 2.4, hence (2.15), (2.16), for r = 8. Note that either of the pair of CFTs can serve as the denominator while the other would be the coset, we thus have E8,1B6,1 \u223c= B1,1 and E8,1B1,1 \u223c= B6,1 (this is a very general phenomenon, though if only one member of the pair is known as a CFT then it is more useful to treat that one as the denominator). The (d1, d2) values follow the predictions from the decomposition of representations explained in section 2.4. Rows 9 and 10 are coset relations between two identical CFTs, namely self-cosets. Row 9 is a self-coset relation with d1 = d2 = 2 and is explained by the regular maximal embedding: A(1)4 \u2295 A (1) 4 \u21aa\u2192 E8 so that the commutant of each A4 is the other one. This gives us the coset E8,1A4,1 \u223c= A4,1. The computed value d1 + d2 = 4 can be explained from the decomposition: 248 = (24,1) \u2295 (1,24) \u2295 (5,10) \u2295 (5,10) \u2295 (10,5) \u2295 (10,5). The first two terms correspond to the \u03c720 term of (2.2) while the last four terms correspond to the \u03c7i\u03c7\u0303i term thus giving d1 = d2 = 2. Row 10 is again a self-coset relation. The embedding behind this coset relation is obtained in two steps, each of which is a regular maximal embedding: A2\u2295A2\u2295A2 \u21aa\u2192 E6 and E6\u2295A2 \u21aa\u2192 E8. Computing the embedding indices we get A(1)2 \u2295A (1) 2 \u2295A (1) 2 \u2295A (1) 2 \u21aa\u2192 E8. The commutant of one of the A2\u2295A2 is the other A2\u2295A2. This gives us the coset E8,1 A\u229722,1\n\u223c= A\u229722,1. The computed value of d1, d2 can be explained from the decomposition: 248 = (8,1,1,1)\u2295 (1,8,1,1)\u2295 (1,1,8,1)\u2295 (1,1,1,8)\u2295 (3,1,3,3)\u2295 (1,3,3,3)\u2295 (3,3,1,3)\u2295 (3,1,3,3)\u2295 (1,3,3,3)\u2295 (3,3,1,3)\u2295 (3,3,3,1)\u2295 (3,3,3,1). The first four terms correspond to the \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 term of (2.2) while the last eight terms correspond to the \u03c7i\u03c7\u0303i terms thus giving d1 = d2 = 4.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nAll the coset relations described so far (in rows 1\u201310 except row 5) were between (3, 0) admissible characters corresponding to well-known CFTs namely WZW CFTs and Virasoro minimal models. In row 5 we encounter for the first time a coset relation between a WZW CFT namely G2,1 \u2297G2,1 and III2, an admissible character (see table 3) which has not yet been characterised as a CFT. Coset relations and the general theory of meromorphic cosets will enable us to characterise III2 as follows. We first seek a Lie algebra embedding for E8 which contains G2 \u2295G2. We find it in two steps of maximal embeddings: G2 \u2295A1 \u21aa\u2192 F4 and G2\u2295F4 \u21aa\u2192 E8 giving G2\u2295G2\u2295A1 \u21aa\u2192 E8. This means that the commutant of G2\u2295G2 in E8 is A1. Further, computing the embedding indices, we have G(1)2 \u2295G (1) 2 \u2295A (8) 1 \u21aa\u2192 E8, which gives the affine Lie algebra embedding G2,1 \u2297G2,1 \u2297A1,8 \u21aa\u2192 E8,1 (see appendix A \u2014 Example 1,2). This implies that the coset CFT is A1,8. The central charge of A1,8 is 125 and m1 = 3 which matches with that of III2. But A1,8 is a nine-character CFT and cannot as such be in a coset relation with the three-character G2,1 \u2297G2,1. Instead, we are dealing with a three-character extension E3[A1,8]. Let us construct this extension explicitly. Denote the three characters of III2 by {\u03c7\u03030, \u03c7\u0303 1\n5 , \u03c7\u0303 3 5 } and the nine Kac-Weyl characters of A1,8 by\n{ \u03c7K0 , \u03c7 K 3\n40 , \u03c7K1 5 , \u03c7K3 8 , \u03c7K3 5 , \u03c7K7 8 , \u03c7K6 5 ,\n\u03c7K63 40 , \u03c7K2\n} . Then E3[A1,8] is given by:\n\u03c7\u03030 = \u03c7K0 + \u03c7K2 , \u03c7\u0303 15 = \u03c7 K 1 5 + \u03c7K6 5 , \u03c7\u0303 3 5 = \u03c7K3 5 . (3.1)\nThe explicit forms of the left hand sides of (3.1) are available from the solutions of the (3, 0) MLDE [34]. The explicit forms of the right hand sides of (3.1) are also available, from say chapter 14 of [55]. This allows us to derive the relevant coefficients in (3.1). Further evidence towards the fact that III2 is the above extension is provided by the following derivation of the (d1, d2) values: 248 = (14,1,1)\u2295 (1,14,1)\u2295 (1,1,3)\u2295 (7,7,3)\u2295 (7,1,5)\u2295 (1,7,5). The first three representations are associated with the \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 term in the coset relation, the fourth representation is associated with d1\u03c71\u03c7\u03031 and the last two representations are associated with d2\u03c72\u03c7\u03032 thus giving d1 = 1, d2 = 2. Thus using the coset relation in row no. 10 we have completed the identification of III2 as the three-character extension E3[A1,8] in (3.1).\nNote that the modular invariant partition function one can construct from eq. (3.1) is the following (see table 1 of [56]),\nZ = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7K0 + \u03c7K2 \u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7K15 + \u03c7K65 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 + 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7K35 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232\n= |\u03c7\u03030|2 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7\u0303 1\n5 \u2223\u2223\u22232 + 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c7\u0303 3 5 \u2223\u2223\u22232 (3.2) which shows that (d1, d2) = (1, 2). Thus, E3[A1,8] is a 3-character and 4-primary extension of A1,8. This is the D-type non-diagonal invariant of [56, 57].\nConclusion. From table 3 we conclude that III2 is identified as a genuine CFT which is E3[A1,8].\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) C c\u0303 (h\u03031, h\u03032) m\u03031 (D\u03031, D\u03032) C\u0303 (d1, d2) 1. 12 ( 1 2 , 1 16 ) 0 (1,1) B0,1 152 ( 1 2 , 15 16 ) 105 (15,27) B7,1 (1, 1)\n2. 1 (\n1 2 , 1 8 ) 1 (2,1) D1,1 7\n( 1 2 , 7 8 ) 98 (14,64) D7,1 (1, 2)\n3. 32 ( 3 16 , 1 2 ) 3 (2,3) B1,1 132 ( 13 16 , 1 2 ) 78 (64,13) B6,1 (1, 1)\n4. 2 (\n1 2 , 1 4 ) 6 (4,2) D2,1 6\n( 1 2 , 3 4 ) 66 (32,12) D6,1 (1, 2)\n5. 125 ( 1 5 , 3 5 ) 3 (3,5) III2 285\n( 4 5 , 2 5 ) 28 (49,7) G\u229722,1 (1, 2)\n6. 52 ( 5 16 , 1 2 ) 10 (4,5) B2,1 112 ( 11 16 , 1 2 ) 55 (32,11) B5,1 (1, 1)\n7. 3 (\n1 2 , 3 8 ) 15 (6,4) D3,1 5\n( 1 2 , 5 8 ) 45 (10,16) D5,1 (1, 2)\n8. 72 ( 7 16 , 1 2 ) 21 (8,7) B3,1 92\n( 9 16 , 1 2 ) 36 (16,9) B4,1 (1, 1)\n9. 4 (\n2 5 , 3 5 ) 24 (5,10) A4,1 4\n( 3 5 , 2 5 ) 24 (10,5) A4,1 (2, 2)\n10. 4 (\n1 3 , 2 3 ) 16 (3,9) A\u229722,1 4\n( 2 3 , 1 3 ) 16 (9,3) A\u229722,1 (4, 4)\nTable 3.

            "heading": "3.2 Cosets of cH = 16",
            "text": "We consider coset bilinear relations between (3, 0) admissible character solutions with cH = 16 meromorphic character j 23 . With reference to (2.6) this would correspond to N = 2 and to either n1 = 1, n2 = 2 or n1 = 2, n2 = 1. Any admissible character solution that is potentially part of such a coset relation has to have a central charge less than 16. Hence we consider all admissible character solutions from [34] with c < 16. For any one of them, say W with central charge and conformal dimensions (c, h1, h2), we ask if there is an admissible character solution W\u0303 with central charge and conformal dimensions either (16\u2212 c, 1\u2212 h1, 2\u2212 h2) or (16\u2212 c, 2\u2212 h1, 1\u2212 h2). For every such pair (W, W\u0303), we then ask if their characters satisfy a bilinear relation (2.12) and compute (d1, d2). The resulting pairs of VVMF are listed in tables 5, 6 and 7. The tables provide the details first of W , then of W\u0303, followed by (d1, d2).\nComments on table 5. Table 5 contains 23 bilinear relations; 22 of them are such that each member of every pair is an affine theory. There is one bilinear relation (row 8) in which one of the pair (III2) has been characterised in the previous subsection and the other III22 is to be characterised. The solutions of each row each pair up to a known meromorphic theory at c = 16, for which there are two choices of the theory H, namely E8,1 \u2297 E8,1 and E1[D16,1]. For short, we refer to these two cases in the last column of the table as E and D respectively. Consider rows 1 and 2. These are both coset relations that involve the Ising CFT M(4, 3) = B0,1. Starting from the central charge and conformal dimensions of the Ising CFT (c = 12 , h1 = 1 16 , h2 = 1 2), one can obtain two potential coset relation partners, one with n1 = 1, n2 = 2 which gives B15,1 and the other with n1 = 2, n2 = 1 which gives E8,2. Row 1 is a special case of Example 3 of section 2.4, with r = 16 and hence the meromorphic CFT for this coset relation is E1[D16,1]. Row 2 follows from the well-known coset E8,1\u2297E8,1E8,2\n\u223c= B0,1 where the denominator is diagonally embedded. The coset relations in rows 3, 7, 10, 15, 18 and 20 are all special cases of Example 2 of section 2.4, corresponding to (r1, r2) values (1, 15), (2, 14), (3, 13), (5, 11), (6, 10) and (7, 9) respectively. All these rows thus have d1 = 1, d2 = 2 and D (standing for E1[D16,1]) as the entry in the last column. For row 7, notice that A\u229721,1 is identical to D2,1. Note that all possible (r1, r2) pairs with r1 + r2 = 16 are realised. Next we consider row 4. In fact the bilinear relations in rows 3 and 4 involve the same D1,1 factor, but the Lie algebra embedding is different. In the former case, D1 is embedded via the regular maximal embedding: D1 \u21aa\u2192 D1 \u2297 D15 \u21aa\u2192 D16 while in the latter case it is embedded via a different regular maximal embedding: D1 \u21aa\u2192 D1 \u2297 A15 \u21aa\u2192 D16 (see appendix A \u2014 Example 4). This suggests a coset relation (after considering embedding indices) between D1,1 and A15,1; but since the latter is a nine-character theory one should expect the coset relation to involve a three-character (and four-primary) extension of it, E3[A15,1]. There is a cH = 24 meromorphic CFT, the Schellekens CFT #63 whose affine\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nsub-algebra is D9,1A15,1, indicating a coset relation between the three-character D9,1 CFT and a three-character extension of A15,1, which is in row 4 here. This extension was first found, in precisely this way, in [17] and hence we denote this here by E3[A15,1] = GHM255.12 The coset relations in rows 5, 9, 11, 14, 16, 19 and 21 are all special cases of Example 1 of section 2.4, corresponding to r1, r2 values (1, 14), (2, 13), (3, 12), (4, 11), (5, 10), (6, 9) and (7, 8) respectively. All these rows thus have d1 = 1, d2 = 1 and D as the entry in the last column. Notice that in row 5, A1,2 is identical to B1,1 and in row 9, C2,1 is identical to B2,1. Also note that all possible (r1, r2) pairs with r1 + r2 = 15 are realised. We will study rows 6, 12, 17, 23 together. In row 6, we have the folllowing identification: D2,1 \u223c= A\u229721,1. Now each of the three-character bilinear relations in these rows is derived from two-character bilinear relations involving the pairs (A1,1, E7,1), (A2,1, E6,1), (G2,1, F4,1) and (D4,1, D4,1) which form coset pairs with E8,1 with d = 1, 2, 1, 3 respectively [34]. The last one is a self-coset relation. Denote any of these pairs by (g1, g\u03031) with central charge and conformal dimensions (c, h) and (c\u0303, h\u0303), related by c+ c\u0303 = 8, h+ h\u0303 = 1. Now consider the pair of three-character CFTs, (g1\u2297 g1, g\u03031\u2297 g\u03031) whose central charges and conformal dimensions are given by (2c, h, 2h), (2c\u0303, h\u0303, 2h\u0303). We have 2c + 2c\u0303 = 16 and h + h\u0303 = 1, 2h + 2h\u0303 = 2, corresponding to the pairings in this table. If we denote the characters of g1 by \u03c70, \u03c71 and those of g\u03031 by \u03c7\u03030, \u03c7\u03031 and the two-character coset relation by \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + d\u03c71\u03c7\u03031 = j 1 3 then the characters of g1 \u2297 g1 are \u03c720, \u03c70\u03c71, \u03c721 and those of g\u03031 \u2297 g\u03031 are \u03c7\u030320, \u03c7\u03030\u03c7\u03031, \u03c7\u030321. A three-character coset relation is obtained by simply squaring the two-character coset relation: \u03c720 \u03c7\u0303 2 0 + 2d\u03c70\u03c71\u03c7\u03030\u03c7\u03031 + d2 \u03c721\u03c7\u030321 = j 2 3 . We can read off the (d1, d2) values for the threecharacter relation to be d1 = 2d, d2 = d2. Finally, we identify the meromorphic CFT in the three-character coset relation to be the E8,1\u2297E8,1 CFT. In terms of Lie algebra embeddings, each factor of g\u2295 g is embedded into a corresponding factor of E8 \u2295 E8. The commutant of g \u2297 g inside E8 \u2297 E8 is the direct sum of two copies of the commutant of g in E8, i.e. g\u0303 \u2295 g\u0303. All aspects of the coset relations in rows 6, 12, 17 and 23 are thus explained from two-character coset relations.\nOne may ask what happens if we embed g\u2295g into E8\u2295E8 with both copies embedded into the same copy of E8 It turns out that such embeddings, when they are possible, are relations between CFTS with ` = 0 and ` = 6 (recall that ` is the Wronskian index). When g1 = D4,1, we do not get anything because D4,1 \u2297D4,1 has a central charge of 8 and its commutant is trivial. For g1 = A1,1, after recognizing that A1,1 \u2297 A1,1 \u223c= D2,1, from the coset relation in row 3 of table 3, we can conclude that the coset would be D6,1 \u2297 E8,1 which is a three-character CFT whose characters are j 13 times the characters of D6,1. This then means that it is an ` = 6 CFT. This is one example of the more general rule that, for n characters, the tensor product of an ` = 0 CFT with E8,1 is an ` = 2n CFT. For g1 = A2,1, we invoke the coset relation in row 8 of table 3 and obtain the coset to be A\u229722,1 \u2297 E8,1, another (3, 6) CFT. Finally for g1 = G2,1, we invoke the coset relation in row 9 of table 3 to conclude that the coset CFT is E3[A1,8]\u2297E8,1, an ` = 6 CFT. We have thus\n12We remind the reader that \u201cGHM\u201d indicates that the coset was discovered in [17], and the subscript is the dimension of the algebra listed there. IIIxx, Vxx indicates that the pair is taken from [34] and it is labelled following the conventions used there.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nanticipated three coset relations between ` = 0 and ` = 6 CFTs, which would be part of a more thorough study of all such coset relations [58].\nIn row 8 we find a pairing between III2 and III22. The first of these characters was identified from table 3 above to be E3[A1,8]. We find there is an embedding A1 \u21aa\u2192 D16 with embedding index 8, whose commutant is C8 (see appendix A \u2014 Example 5). It follows that III22 is the three-character extension E3[C8,1]. Below we will find independent confirmation of this fact from another embedding.\nIn row 13, we pair D4,1 (two characters, four primaries) with D12,1 (three characters, four primaries). This is a slightly unusual example where the two elements of the pair do not have the same number of characters. They do, however, have the same number of primaries and the coset relation is straightforward if we just pair the primaries with unit coefficient for each term. The three non-trivial primaries of D4,1 all have h = 12 , while one of the non-trivial primaries of D12,1 has h\u0303 = 12 and the other two have h\u0303 = 3 2 . Thus the bilinear relation is:\n\u03c7H = j(\u03c4) 2 3 = \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c7 1\n2 \u03c7\u0303 1 2 + \u03c7 1 2 \u03c7\u0303 3 2 + \u03c7 1 2 \u03c7\u0303 3 2\n= \u03c70\u03c7\u03030 + \u03c7 1 2 (\u03c7\u0303 1 2 + 2\u03c7\u0303 3 2 )\n(3.3)\nRow 22 is another self-coset relation. It is a special case of Example 2 of section 2.4 with r1 = r2 = 8 and r = 16. The meromorphic CFT is thus E1[D16,1] CFT which is reflected in the last column. The d1 = 1, d2 = 2 values are also thereby explained.\nConclusion. From table 5 we have found that the character III22 should be identified with E3[C8,1]. The remaining entries in the table correspond to known CFTs.\nComments on table 6. This table contains 9 pairs that are all of IVOA type, by which we mean some of their fusion rules as computed from the modular S-matrix are negative. The third row of table 6 displays a dual pair of IVOAs. This pair is inherited from the simpler pair with two characters that combine to give E8,1. Rows 1, 2, 4 contain bilinear pairs that combine to the character j 23 and one of which in each case is a known IVOA. We would therefore claim that the duals, III29, III30, III28 are also IVOAs. However the remaining rows 5\u2212 9 contain pairs where neither member is a known CFT or IVOA. In terms of fusion rules (deduced from the modular S-matrix) these are all of IVOA type, but we cannot say more about them. In some of these cases, one member of the pair already appeared in table 4, so if one is able to characterise that one using the cH = 8 duality then it would provide evidence for existence of its partner as an IVOA.\nConclusion. From table 6 we conclude that III7, III8, III12, III24, III25, III28, III29 and III30 are of IVOA-type as these have negative fusion rules and that they are paired as in the table.\nComments on table 7. As for the two previous cases, the two sets of characters in each line of table 7 satisfy a bilinear pairing to the character j 23 . We now argue that all the previously uncharacterised solutions that appear in this table are inconsistent as CFTs.

IVOA-type pairings, cH = 16 with (n1, n2) = (1, 2). The two sets of characters pair up to j 23 .\nshort, we refer to these as \u201cinconsistent pairings\u201d. This means that, though the VVMFs do pair up into a modular invariant, these are not coset pairs of CFTs. In rows 1, 2, 4\u20137 we find known CFT in the left column paired with the characters III26, III21, III20, III19,V18, III17 in the right column. In the first five of these cases, the CFTs in the first column also appear in a coset pair in table 5, in lines 5, 9\u201312 respectively, where they are paired with known CFTs. However here these theories are paired differently and their partners are previously uncharacterised admissible characters. For the sixth case, A4,1 does not appear in table 5 but only in table 7. The details of the bilinear relation in row 7 suggests that for III17 to be a CFT, it must be based on a Lie subalgebra, h, of D16,13 which has dimension 222 and that there must exist a (246 dimensional) embedding A4 \u00d7 h \u21aa\u2192 D16. We listed embeddings of D16 in decreasing order of dimensions (496, 384, 380 . . .) till a little beyond 246 and we did not find any with a A4 factor (there is a 256 dimensional embedding A4 \u00d7D11 \u00d7D1.) We thus conclude that the character III17 does not correspond to a CFT. We will independently confirm this in a slightly simpler way when we come to cH = 24, in table 7. This story for row 7 repeats for each of rows 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. There is another way to rule out solution V18 in row 6 of table 7. A\u229722,1 is known to have nine primaries and three characters; one primary corresponding to the identity character and each of the other two characters correspond to four primaries each. Thus the multiplicities in the partition function are Y1 = 4, Y2 = 4. Any CFT which forms a coset relation with A\u229722,1 is also expected to have the same partition function multiplicities Y\u03031 = 4, Y\u03032 = 4 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity are expected to be d1 = 4, d2 = 4. The MLDE analysis [34] for the admissible character V18 gives the degeneracies D\u03031 = 1, D\u03032 = 1\n13An embedding of E8 \u00d7 E8 that contains a A4 factor will result in a CFT with Wronskian index 6.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nwhich results in partition function multiplicities Y\u03031 = 34, Y\u03032 = 22 \u00b7 314. A reassignment of degeneracies and multiplicities is allowed as long as Y\u0303i D\u0303i\n2 is kept fixed. There is no reassignment with Y\u03031 = 4 simply because Y\u03031D\u03031\n2 = 81 does not have 4 as a factor. Another inconsistency comes from the details of the bilinear identity given in row no. 6. A reassignment of degeneracies and multiplicities (d1, d2) is allowed as long as diD\u0303i is kept fixed. But there is no reassignment with d1 = 4 simply because d1 D\u03031 = 18 does not have 4 as a factor. Due to all these details, we conclude that the admissible character V18 does not correspond to a CFT. This agrees with the conclusion based on embeddings.\nRows 3 and rows 8\u201315 of table 7 are inconsistent since every W\u0303 in these rows has fractional Y1, Y2 values. These are the entries of type III, V. Row 16 is interesting because both members of the pair are known affine theories. However this is not a consistent bilinear pairing since the coefficient d1 in the bilinear relation is fractional. This enables us to rule it out without even computing d2. There is an important consistency test that explains why this pairing failed. Had it succeeded, there would have been a meromorphic theory at c = 16 involving an extension of D\u229724,1D8,1 with a total of 120 + 56 + 128 = 304 Kac-Moody generators. Such an extension is known not to exist (since there are just two c = 16 meromorphic theories, both having 496 Kac-Moody generators) which is why the pairing also should not exist.\nConclusion. From table 7 we conclude that III17, V18, III19, III20, III21 and III26 are not valid CFTs.14"

            "text": "With c = 24, and considering that we are working throughout with Wronskian index ` = 0, eq. (2.5) gives us the constraint n1 + n2 = 4. This can be satisfied in two ways, with (n1, n2) = (2, 2) or (1, 3). Each choice leads to a distinct set of bilinear pairings. We address each class in turn.\nThe character of the meromorphic theory to which the two entries in each row pair up, can be written \u03c7(\u03c4) = j(\u03c4)\u2212 744 +N . In this way of writing it, N is the dimension of the Kac-Moody algebra of the meromophic theory, if any. Below, wherever relevant we provide the serial number(s) in the list of [37] which specifies the meromorphic CFT(s) with that N .\n(n1, n2) = (2, 2). This set comprises tables 8, 9 and 10. We discuss each one in turn. There is some overlap between this section and the papers [35, 36]. The main focus of the former is fermionic CFT and of the latter, Hecke relations, and both references present some bilinear pairs of admissible three-character VVMFs. However these references mostly restrict to pairings with total central charge cH = 24, and moreover the sub-case (n1, n2) = (2, 2) that we consider in this subsection. In some of these cases the bilinear pairing was used to identify admissible characters as CFTs. Thus there is some overlap between the results of these references and our table 8, which we will point out below.\n14In [36] it is claimed that III17 is a CFT, however we disagree with this.\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n3\nComments on table 8. In this table we will go into considerable detail to illustrate the way to correctly choose the degeneracies Di for the type III and V characters which, since they were discovered via MLDE, did not automatically come with a fixed normalisation. We will not be so detailed about this point in the remaining tables.\nAll cosets in this table are of the form explained in the discussion below eq. (2.7), where the coset simply \u201cdeletes\u201d simple factors (at most two) from a Schellekens theory and leaves behind the remaining simple factors. These cases are labelled as follows: \u201cGHM\u201d indicates that the coset was discovered in [17], and the subscript is the dimension of the algebra listed there. IIIxx,Vxx indicates that the pair is taken from [34] and it is labelled following the conventions used there and reviewed here in section 2 and in table 1. Rows 22, 23, 18, 20 were for some reason missed in both these references. Interestingly the first two are \u201cself-cosets\u201d where C, C\u0303 are the same theory. This implies that C\u0303 is actually an affine theory rather than an extension of one. The table provides the correct degeneracies for both the non-trivial primaries of W\u0303 .\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nIn table 8 (and in other tables of this paper) we have arranged the coset relations in an increasing order of central charge for the admissible character solution in the left column, so that, naturally the solution on the right has a decreasing central charge, and the self-cosets (if any) are at the bottom of the table. But it makes sense to discuss the coset relations in a slightly different order. We discuss first the batch of rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, all of which have a Br,1 CFT in the left column. Then we discuss the batch of rows 2, 4, 6, 11, 14, 16, 19, 20 all of which have a Dr,1 CFT in the left column. Then we discuss row 9 which is a sporadic case. After that we take up the batch of rows 8, 13, 17, 21, 23 where the CFT in the left column is a tensor product CFT. This then leaves us with row 22 which is a self-coset relation.\nThe case of row 1 is different from the others: here h, g, and consequently also h\u0303, are empty. This is the coset pairing of the Ising model, here denotedM(4, 3), with the Baby Monster CFT [49]. This bilinear pairing was previously studied in [18]. The latter character was obtained as an admissible character in [34] with degeneracies D\u03031 = 4371, D\u03032 = 47 which then results in the multiplicities in the partition function as Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 222. Requiring that Y\u0303iD\u0303i\n2 is unchanged we can redefine: D\u03031 = 4371, D\u03032 = 47 \u00b7 211 and Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 1. These new degeneracies then enter into the computation of the bilinear identity to give the multiplicities there as d1 = 1, d2 = 1. We thus have a consistent coset relation between to three-primary CFTs.\nIn row 3, we have four pairs of coset relations. Each of the theories C\u0303 have a common set of characters which were obtained by solving the MLDE in [34]. The degeneracies of the characters as obtained from the MLDE, for conformal dimensions 32 (\u03c7\u0303 32 ) and 29 16 (\u03c7\u0303 2916 ) are D\u03031 = 4785 and D\u03032 = 45 respectively. The multiplicities in the partition function were then computed to be Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 220. With these degeneracies the bilinear identity then gives multiplicities of d1 = 1 and d2 = 1024 respectively. If we redefine our degeneracies to be D\u03031 = 4785 and D\u03032 = 45 \u00d7 210, then the multiplicities would be d1 = 1 and d2 = 1 respectively (which is what we display in the table). With this assignment of degeneracies and multiplicities, we have the interpretation for the coset relation as between two threeprimary CFTs. We can justify the above redefinition, for the first of the four theories of row 3, where it can be realised as a three-character extension of A\u2297151,2 . Let us denote the characters of A1,2 to be \u03c70, \u03c7 1\n2 and \u03c7 3 16 and note that they have degeneracies of 3 and 2\nrespectively. It turns out that the leading term of \u03c7\u0303 3 2 is given by 35\u03c7120 \u03c731 2 + 15\u03c770\u03c783 16 from which it follows that the degeneracy is 35 \u00d7 33 + 15 \u00d7 28 = 4785. Similarly the leading term of \u03c7\u0303 29\n16 is given by 120\u03c770\u03c773 16 \u03c7 1 2 which gives it a degeneracy of 120\u00d7 27 \u00d7 3 which is\nalso equal to 210 \u00d7 45. Thus, at least for one of the theories of row 3, we have derived the degeneracies that will make the multiplicities to be each equal to 1. We expect this to hold for the other theories in row 3 as well. Furthermore, the new degeneracies implies that the multiplicities in the partition function are now Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 1, which is consistent with d1 = 1, d2 = 1. For the three coset relations in row 5 the degeneracies of the characters obtained from the MLDE are D\u03031 = 5031 and D\u03032 = 43 respectively. The multiplicities in the partition function was then computed to be Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 218. With these degeneracies the bilinear identity then gives multiplicities of d1 = 1 and d2 = 512 respectively. If we redefine our\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\ndegeneracies to be D\u03031 = 5031 and D\u03032 = 43\u00d729, then the multiplicities would be d1 = 1 and d2 = 1 respectively. Furthermore, these new degeneracies change the multiplicities in the partition function to Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 1 With this assignment of degeneracies and multiplicities, we have the interpretation for the coset relations in row no. 5 as between two three-primary CFTs. This same phenomenon repeats itself in rows nos. 7, 10, 12 and 15. We need to multiply the degeneracy obtained by solving the MLDE, for the character paired with the spinor character, by 28, 27, 26 and 25 respectively. We would then have multiplicities of 1 and 1 in each case and consequently the correct interpretation between two three-primary CFTs. In row 18, we have a coset relation between two three-primary CFTs both of which are WZW CFTs. The bilinear gives rise to meromorphic theory #62 in the list of [37] which is a non-lattice theory. This case was in fact the basis for the prediction in [45] of an infinite series of non-lattice meromorphic theories at increasing central charges, and is the m = 0 case of entry #15 in table 3 of that reference. Similarly, the bilinear relations in rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 15 were the basis for the prediction in [45] of 14 infinite series of non-lattice meromorphic theories at increasing central charges, corresponding to entries #1\u2212#14 in table 3 there. For the coset relation in row 2, the MLDE computations for the degeneracies are D\u03031 = 575, D\u03032 = 23 which gives the degeneracies in the partition function to be Y\u03031 = 64, Y\u03032 = 223. With these degeneracies the bilinear identity then gives multiplicities of d1 = 8, d2 = 4096. The MLDE and the bilinear identity are also consistent with the following new assignment viz. D\u03031 = 575\u00d78, D\u03032 = 23\u00d7211 and d1 = 1, d2 = 2. This new assignment of the degeneracies results in the following partition function multiplicities: Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 2. Row 2 is thus a coset relation between two four-primary CFTs.) More significantly, we can now conclude that the admissible character solution III50 corresponds to a genuine CFT, a three-character extension of D\u2297231,1 . Thus the coset relation in row 2 has resulted in the discovery of a new CFT. In row 4, we have a coset bilinear relation between D2,1 and III45. We are able to redefine the degeneracies to obtain partition function multiplicities to be Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 2 and the parameters in the bilinear identity to be d1 = 1, d2 = 2, indicating a pairing between two four-primary CFTs. There are six meromorphic theories, #15\u2013#20, of [37] with D2,1 = A\u229721,1 as a factor of the affine part of their chiral algebras, which means that III45 corresponds to six different CFTs. Each of these are three-character extensions of the remaining factors of the affine part of the chiral algebras, viz. A\u2297221,1 , A\u229743,2A\u229721,1, A5,3D4,3A1,1, A7,4A1,1, D5,4C3,2 and D\u2297226,5 respectively. Thus, the coset relation in row 4 has resulted in the discovery of six new CFTs. In rows 6, 11, 14, 16, 19, we have bilinear relations between D3,1, D5,1, D6,1, D7,1, D9,1 on the left with CFTs already discovered in [17]. What we are able to do new here is give exact details of the characters: the degeneracies of the non-identity characters that lead to partition function multiplicities Y\u03031 = 1, Y\u03032 = 2 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity to be d1 = 1, d2 = 2. Thus each of these rows describe pairings between four-primary CFTs. In row 20, we have a coset relation between two four-primary CFTs both of which are WZW CFTs. The bilinear gives rise to meromorphic theory #64 in the list of [37]. This case was in fact the basis for the prediction in [45] of an infinite series of meromorphic theories at increasing central charge, and is the m = 0 case of entry #33 in table 3 of that reference. Similarly, the bilinear relations in rows 2, 4, 6, 11, 14, 16, and 19 were the basis\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nfor the prediction in [45] of 17 infinite series of meromorphic theories at increasing central charges, corresponding to entries #16\u2212#32 in table 3 there. Row 9 is a bilinear relation between A4,1 and a CFT already discovered in [17]. Again what we do new here is to give exact details of the characters: the degeneracies D\u03031, D\u03032 that lead to partition function multiplicities Y\u03031 = 2, Y\u03032 = 2 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity to be d1 = 2, d2 = 2. This establishes a pairing between two five-primary CFTs. We now study bilinear relations where one of the solutions is the three-character CFT obtained from a tensor product of two copies of two-character CFTs. There are 7 such CFTs viz. A\u229721,1, A\u229722,1, G\u229722,1, D\u229724,1, F\u229724,1 , E\u229726,1 and E\u229727,1 . The first has been studied in row 4 (as D2,1) and the last one in row 20. The remaining five are in rows 8, 13, 17, 21 and 23 and for some reason these were missed out in [17]. In row 8, we have a bilinear relation between A\u229722,1 and V39. The former is a nineprimary theory with multiplicities Y1 = 4, Y2 = 4. We are able to obtain an assignment of degeneracies for the latter so the partition function multiplicities are Y\u03031 = 4, Y\u03032 = 4 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity are d1 = 4, d2 = 4, so that we have a pairing between two nine-primary CFTs. Furthermore we find three meromorphic CFTs in [37] viz. #24, #26 and #27 that contain a factor of A\u229722,1, giving rise to three new CFTs that are the three-character extensions of the remaining factors viz. A\u2297102,1 , A\u229725,2C2,1 and A8,3 respectively. Thus the coset relation in row 8 has enabled us to characterize the MLDE solution V39 as corresponding to three CFTs. In row 13, we have a bilinear relation between G\u229722,1 and III37. The former is a fourprimary theory with multiplicities Y1 = 2, Y2 = 1. We are able to obtain an assignment of degeneracies for the latter so the partition function multiplicities are Y\u03031 = 2, Y\u03032 = 1 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity are d1 = 2, d2 = 1, so that we have a pairing between two four-primary CFTs. Furthermore we find a meromorphic CFT in [37] viz. #32 that contains a factor of G\u229722,1, giving rise to a new CFT that is a three-character extension of the remaining factors, namely E6,3G2,1. Thus the coset relation in row 13 has enabled us to characterize the MLDE solution III37 as corresponding to a genuine CFT. Row 17 is a bilinear relation between D\u229724,1 and an admissible character solution that is one of the infinite family of solutions given in table 2 viz. III\u2032\u2032 with m1 = 112. The former is a sixteen-primary theory with multiplicities Y1 = 6, Y2 = 9. We are able to obtain an assignment of degeneracies for the latter so the partition function multiplicities are Y\u03031 = 6, Y\u03032 = 9 and the multiplicities in the bilinear identity are d1 = 5, d2 = 9, so that we have a pairing between two sixteen-primary CFTs. Furthermore we find a meromorphic CFT in [37] namely #42 that contains a factor of D\u229724,1, giving rise to a new CFT that is a three-character extension of the remaining factor D\u229744,1. Thus the coset relation in row 17 has enabled us to characterise the MLDE solution III\u2032\u2032 with m1 = 112 of table 2 as a sixteen-primary CFT, denoted E3[D\u229744,1]. This is the CFT with the largest number of primaries but just three characters in this paper that is not a tensor product theory (of course D\u229724,1 has the same properties, but it is a tensor product). In row 21 we find a coset relation involving F 24,1. The unique meromorphic theory with this factor at c = 24 is #52 of [37] with Kac-Moody algebra F 24,1C8,1. This proves that III22 is equivalent to E3[C8,1], confirming the result obtained from table 5.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nIn row 23 we find a self-coset relation for E\u229726,1 . This is a pairing between nine-primary CFTs. This comes about because of the existence of a meromorphic theory in [37] namely #58 which is the extension E1[E\u229746,1 ]. Row 22 is a self-coset relation involving D12,1; the meromorphic theory is #66 of [37] which is the extension E1[D\u2297212,1]. Even though the D12,1 is a four-primary theory, the pairing of characters is not the usual one which gives the bilinear identity parameters (d1, d2) = (1, 2) or (2, 1). Instead we have (d1, d2) = (1, 1). This has been explained in the discussion around eq. (2.20). This unusual coset pairing will appear in our future tables between D4k,1 theories with odd k, at cH > 24 and whenever n1, n2 6= 1.\nConclusion. From table 8 we have deduced the following new identifications for type III and V solutions:\nIII37 = E3[E6,3G2,1] V39 = E3[A\u2297102,1 ], E3[A\u229725,2C2,1], E3[A8,3] III45 = E3[A\u2297221,1 ], E3[A\u229743,2A\u229721,1], E3[A5,3D4,3A1,1], E3[A7,4A1,1], E3[D5,4C3,2], E3[D6,5] III50 = E3[D\u2297231,1 ]\nIII\u2032\u2032(m1 = 112) = E3[D\u229744,1] (3.4)\nWe also confirm the conclusion from table 5 that III22 is identified with E3[C8,1]. We note here that the above identifications, with the exception of III\u2032\u2032(m1 = 112), have been made in [36]. Let us briefly comment on the three-character extension E3[D\u229744,1] at c = 16. Though we had excluded c = 8, 16 solutions from the classification at the outset, we felt it worth noting the existence of this one at c = 16, since it is of the \u201cGHM\u201d type [17].\nComments on table 9. This table has several bilinear pairs that we have shown to be of IVOA type. However in a number of cases (rows 1, 5\u20139) the pairing does not lead to a valid meromorphic CFT as it does not correspond to any entry in [37]. In three cases, however, the pairing does reproduce a meromorphic theory \u2014 these are rows 2, 3, 4. These examples appear more favourable for identification of the pair as some variant of CFTs.\nConclusion. From table 9 we conclude that III27, III32, III33, III35, III47, III52 and III54 belong to the IVOA category. These have at least one negative fusion rule, and the above pairings are always between two such solutions.\nComments on table 10. This table lists all the pairs where one can rule out at least one member being a CFT, or in several cases both members. For rows 1, 4\u201311, 13\u201316, the solution in the second column should arise as the commutant of some embedding of the known algebra in the first column in a meromorphic theory. However there is no candidate meromorphic theory for these cases, since the value of the integer denoting the constant term in the meromorphic character \u03c7(\u03c4) = j(\u03c4)\u2212 744 +N does not appear in any entry of the table in [37]. This immediately rules out the solution in the right column of every case from being a CFT.\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) C c\u0303 (h\u03031, h\u03032) m\u03031 (D\u03031, D\u03032) C\u0303 (d1, d2) S# 1. 12 ( 1 2 , 1 16 ) 0 (1, 1) B0,1 47 2 ( 3 2 , 31 16 ) 0 (4371, 47 \u00b7 211) BM (1, 1) 0 2. 1 ( 12 , 1 8 ) 1 (2, 1) D1,1 23 ( 3 2 , 15 8 ) 23 (4600, 23 \u00b7 211) III50 (1, 2) 1 3. 32 ( 1 2 , 3 16 ) 3 (3, 2) B1,1 45 2 ( 3 2 , 29 16 ) 45 (4785, 45 \u00b7 210) GHM45 (1, 1) 5\n7 8 10\n4. 2 ( 12 , 1 4 ) 6 (4, 2) D2,1 22 ( 3 2 , 7 4 ) 66 (77 \u00b7 26, 11 \u00b7 211) III45 (1, 2) 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n5. 52 ( 1 2 , 5 16 ) 10 (5, 4) B2,1 43 2 ( 3 2 , 27 16 ) 86 (5031, 43 \u00b7 29) GHM86 (1, 1) 25\n26 28\n6. 3 ( 12 , 3 8 ) 15 (6, 4) D3,1 21 ( 3 2 , 13 8 ) 105 (5096, 21 \u00b7 29) GHM105 (1, 2) 30\n31 33 34 35\n7. 72 ( 1 2 , 7 16 ) 21 (7, 8) B3,1 41 2 ( 3 2 , 25 16 ) 123 (5125, 41 \u00b7 28) GHM123 (1, 1) 39 40 8. 4 ( 13 , 2 3 ) 16 (3, 9) A \u22972 2,1 20 ( 53 , 4 3 ) 80 (4 \u00b7 37, 5 \u00b7 35) V39 (4, 4) 24\n26 27\n9. 4 ( 25 , 3 5 ) 24 (5, 10) A4,1 20 ( 8 5 , 7 5 ) 120 (13 \u00b7 54, 4 \u00b7 54) GHM120 (2, 2) 37 10. 92 ( 1 2 , 9 16 ) 36 (9, 16) B4,1 39 2 ( 3 2 , 23 16 ) 156 (5083, 39 \u00b7 27) GHM156 (1, 1) 47 48 11. 5 ( 12 , 5 8 ) 45 (10, 16) D5,1 19 ( 3 2 , 11 8 ) 171 (5016, 19 \u00b7 27) GHM171 (1, 2) 49 12. 112 ( 1 2 , 11 16 ) 55 (11, 32) B5,1 37 2 ( 3 2 , 21 16 ) 185 (4921, 37 \u00b7 26) GHM185 (1, 1) 53 13. 285 ( 2 5 , 4 5 ) 28 (7, 49) G \u22972 2,1 92 5 ( 8 5 , 6 5 ) 92 (7475, 1196) III37 (2, 1) 32 14. 6 ( 12 , 3 4 ) 66 (12, 32) D6,1 18 ( 3 2 , 5 4 ) 198 (75 \u00b7 26, 9 \u00b7 27) GHM198 (1, 2) 54 55 15. 132 ( 1 2 , 13 16 ) 78 (13, 64) B6,1 35 2 ( 3 2 , 19 16 ) 210 (4655, 35 \u00b7 25) GHM210 (1, 1) 56 16. 7 ( 12 , 7 8 ) 91 (14, 64) D7,1 17 ( 3 2 , 9 8 ) 221 (4488, 544) GHM221 (1, 2) 59\n17. 8 ( 1 2 , 1 ) 56 (8,64) D\u229724,1 16 ( 3 2 , 1 ) 112 (211,27) E3[D\u229744,1] (6, 9) 42 18. 172 ( 1 2 , 17 16 ) 136 (17, 256) B8,1 31 2 ( 3 2 , 15 16 ) 248 (3875, 248) E8,2 (1, 1) 62 19. 9 ( 12 , 9 8 ) 153 (18, 256) D9,1 15 ( 3 2 , 7 8 ) 255 (3640, 120) GHM255 (1, 2) 63 20. 10 ( 12 , 5 4 ) 190 (20, 512) D10,1 14 ( 3 2 , 3 4 ) 266 (562, 56) E \u22972 7,1 (1, 2) 64\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) W c\u0303 (h\u03031, h\u03032) m\u03031 (D\u03031, D\u03032) W\u0303 (d1, d2) N S# 1. 47 ( 1 7 , 3 7) 1 (1, 1) I[M(7, 2)] 164 7 ( 13 7 , 11 7 ) 41 (50922, 4797) III54 (1,1) 42 \u2014 2. 45 ( 1 5 , 2 5) 2 (2, 1) I[M(5, 2)\u22972] 116 5 ( 9 5 , 8 5) 58 (27550, 4959) III52 (2,1) 60 12\u201314 3. 127 ( 2 7 , 3 7) 6 (3, 2) III1 156 7 ( 12 7 , 11 7 ) 78 (27170, 5070) III47 (1,1) 84 22\u201323 4. 447 ( 4 7 , 5 7) 88 (11, 44) III3 124 7 ( 10 7 , 9 7) 248 (2108, 2108) III35 (1, 1) 336 60 5. 365 ( 3 5 , 4 5) 144 (12, 45) III4 84 5 ( 7 5 , 6 5) 336 (1452, 770) III33 (1,2) 480 \u2014 6. 527 ( 4 7 , 6 7) 156 (13, 78) III5 116 7 ( 10 7 , 8 7) 348 (1972, 725) III32 (1,1) 504 \u2014 7. 607 ( 3 7 , 8 7) 210 (10, 285) III7 108 7 ( 11 7 , 6 7) 378 (3510, 117) III29 (1,1) 588 \u2014 8. 445 ( 2 5 , 6 5) 220 (11, 275) III8 76 5 ( 8 5 , 4 5) 380 (3249, 57) III27 (1,2) 600 \u2014 9. 687 ( 3 7 , 9 7) 221 (17, 782) III12 100 7 ( 11 7 , 5 7) 325 (2925, 55) III24 (1,1) 546 \u2014\nTable 9. IVOA-type pairings, cH = 24 with (n1, n2) = (2, 2). Wherever present, the entry in the last column identifies the meromorphic theory by its row number in the table of [40].\nIn some of these cases, namely rows 10, 11, 13\u201316, the entry in the right column was already ruled out by considerations of non-integral multiplicities (d1, d2). That leaves rows 1, 4\u20139 where we can now rule out the solutions in the right column, namely III42, III26, III21, III20, III19, V18, III17. The last six of these were already ruled out by table 7, a nice confirmation of the internal consistency of our method. Notice that the reasons for ruling out these six solutions are slightly different in the two tables \u2014 in table 7, the pairings gave a sensible character j 23 that actually describes two distinct meromorphic CFT, but there was no possible embedding to justify the coset relation and this ruled out the uncharacterised solution. However in table 10, the same solutions were ruled out more easily because the pairing produced no known theory in the (complete) classification of [37]. Meanwhile the solution III42 is being ruled out for the first time. Let us move on to the three remaining cases in rows 2, 3 and 12. In row 3 we cannot say anything about III28 because its partner III9 is already ruled out. Thus there are no grounds, from this table, to decide whether III28 is a CFT or not. Fortunately III28 has already been identified as being of IVOA-type in table 10. In row 12, although the pairing is formally to an invariant that corresponds to a genuine meromorphic theory from the list of [37], the solution in the right column was already ruled out from the beginning and we get no new information. That leaves row 2 where the pairing gives rise to a modular invariant j\u2212744+N with the integer N = 336. This appears in the list of [37] and has the Kac-Moody algebra A212,1. However we have verified that there is no embedding of B7,1 in the above algebra that would give rise to the character III31. It follows that III31 is not a CFT.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) W c\u0303 (h\u03031, h\u03032) m\u03031 (D\u03031, D\u03032) W\u0303 (d1, d2) N S# 1. 125 ( 1 5 , 3 5) 3 (3, 5) III2 108 5 ( 9 5 , 7 5) 27 (42483, 2295) III42 (1,2) 30 \u2014 2. 152 ( 1 2 , 15 16) 105 (15, 128) B7,1 33 2 ( 3 2 , 17 16) 231 (4301, 528) III31 (1,1) 336 60 3. 445 ( 1 5 , 7 5) 253 (11, 242) III9 76 5 ( 9 5 , 3 5) 437 (11875, 57) III28 ( 15 , 1) 690 \u2014 4. 192 ( 1 2 , 19 16) 171 (19, 512) B9,1 29 2 ( 3 2 , 13 16) 261 (3393, 116) III26 (1,1) 432 \u2014 5. 212 ( 1 2 , 21 16) 210 (21, 210) B10,1 27 2 ( 3 2 , 11 16) 270 (2871, 54) III21 (1,1) 480 \u2014 6. 11 (12 , 11 8 ) 231 (22, 210) D11,1 13 ( 3 2 , 5 8) 273 (2600, 26) III20 (1, 2) 504 \u2014 7. 232 ( 1 2 , 23 16) 253 (23, 211) B11,1 25 2 ( 3 2 , 9 16) 275 (2325, 25) III19 (1,1) 528 \u2014 8. 12 (13 , 5 3) 318 (9, 4374) V18 12 ( 5 3 , 1 3) 318 (4374, 9) V18 (1, 1) 636 \u2014 9. 12 (35 , 7 5) 222 (25, 1275) III17 12 ( 7 5 , 3 5) 222 (1275, 25) III17 (2, 2) 444 \u2014 10. 252 ( 1 2 , 25 16) 300 (25, 212) B12,1 23 2 ( 3 2 , 7 16) 276 (1771, 23) III16 (1, 12 ) 576 \u2014 11. 13 (12 , 13 8 ) 325 (26, 212) D13,1 11 ( 3 2 , 3 8) 275 (1496, 11) III15 (1,1) 600 \u2014 12. 272 ( 1 2 , 27 16) 351 (27, 213) B13,1 21 2 ( 3 2 , 5 16) 273 (1225, 21) III14 (1, 14 ) 624 67 13. 14 (12 , 7 4) 378 (28, 213) D14,1 10 ( 3 2 , 1 4) 270 (960, 5) III13 (1,1) 648 \u2014 14. 292 ( 1 2 , 29 16) 406 (29, 214) B14,1 19 2 ( 3 2 , 3 16) 266 (703, 19) III11 (1, 18 ) 672 \u2014 15. 15 (12 , 15 8 ) 435 (30, 214) D15,1 9 ( 3 2 , 1 8) 261 (456, 9) III10 (1, 14 ) 696 \u2014 16. 312 ( 1 2 , 31 16) 465 (31, 215) B15,1 17 2 ( 3 2 , 1 16) 255 (221, 17) III6 (1, 116 ) 720 \u2014\nTable 10. Inconsistent pairings, cH = 24 with (n1, n2) = (2, 2). Wherever present, the entry in the last column identifies a candidate meromorphic theory by its row number in the table of [40].\nConclusion. From table 10 we concluded that III31 and III42 are not valid CFTs, and confirmed that the same holds for III17, V18, III19, III20, III21, III26 which were already ruled out previously.\n(n1, n2) = (1, 3). We now turn to bilinear pairs of solutions with (n1, n2) = (1, 3), a class never previously explored to our knowledge. This set consists of a list of CFT pairings as well as tables 11 and 12. We do not need a table for the consistent CFT pairings with these values of n1, n2 as all the pairs are cosets of the meromorphic theory E1[D24,1] that appears in [37] as the final entry #71, by B,D type WZW models at level 1. D24 has dimension 1128, so the integer N in the meromorphic character is 384 for all these cases. These cosets are obtained through regular embeddings of Br,1 or Dr,1 into D24,1 as discussed in section 2.4. Thus we have pairings of (i) Br1,1 and Br2,1 with r1 + r2 = 23, 0 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 23, (ii) Dr1,1 and Dr2,1 with r1 + r2 = 24, 1 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 23. Recall that B0,1 is identified with M(4, 3), the Ising model.\nComments on table 11. In this table we have four pairs that are all of IVOA type. 7 of these 8 solutions have appeared in previous coset pairs where the meromorphic theory had c = 8 or 16 (tables 4 and 6). The only new one is III48 with c = 1567 .\nConclusion. From table 11 we conclude that III48 belong to the IVOA category as this has negative fusion rules and also satisfies the above pairing.\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nComments on table 12. In this table, rows 1, 2, 4, 7, 10\u201312, 14\u201316, 18, 19 are pairings of solutions of III type with consistent CFTs (we used the fact that III2 was identified as a CFT in table 3). These pairings mostly give us fractional values of N in the meromorphic character, so we do not learn anything from them. In a few cases we get integer values of N but these too do not feature in [37].\nIn row 17 both solutions were previously ruled out. This leaves rows 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, where we can hope to get new information. In all these cases except row 13, the solutions III51, III46, III44,V41,V40 are paired with known CFTs. However the result of the pairing is not a meromorphic CFT as one readily sees from [37]. That means these five solutions are ruled out as corresponding to CFTs.\nConclusion. From table 12 we conclude that V40, V41, III44, III46 and III51 are not valid CFTs."

            "heading": "3.4 Cosets of cH = 32",
            "text": "Now we move on to list coset pairs for cH = 32. The meromorphic character in this case can be written:\n\u03c7(\u03c4) = j(\u03c4) 1 3 (j(\u03c4)\u2212 992 +N ) \u223c q\u2212 4 3 (1 +N q + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) (3.5)\nso that N is the dimension of its Kac-Moody algebra. Since we have (p, `) = (3, 0), we get n1 + n2 = 5 from eq. (2.5). This again implies that we have two sub-cases: (n1, n2) = (1, 4) or (2, 3) that lead to distinct sets of coset theories. We address each one in turn.\n(n1, n2) = (1, 4). Here any admissible character solution that is potentially part of a coset relation has to have a central charge less than 32. Hence we consider all admissible character solutions from [34] with c < 32. The consistent cosets all turn out to arise through regular embeddings of Br,1 or Dr,1 into D32,1 as discussed in section 2.4. Thus we have pairings of (i) Br1,1 and Br2,1 with r1 + r2 = 31, 0 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 31, (ii) Dr1,1 and Dr2,1 with r1 + r2 = 32, 1 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 31. It turns out there are no IVOA-type bilinear pairs with (n1, n2) = (1, 4) so we go on directly to the table of inconsistent pairings in table 13.\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nComments on table 13. All the pairs (W \u2194 W\u0303) listed in table 13 satisfy a bilinear relation to a potential c = 32 character of the form in eq. (3.5). However the relation is problematic in one or more ways. In rows 1\u20134, 6, 7, 14, 18, 19 we have theories that were found to be inconsistent at the outset, paired with a known CFT. There is nothing left to determine in these cases. Next, in rows 9, 10, 12, 17 both members of the pair are already ruled out.\nRows 5, 8, 15 seem more promising as the pairings lead to integer values of N as seen in the last column of the table. However in these cases N is greater than 2016, which is the\n\u2013 38 \u2013\ndimension of D32. It can be shown that the dimension of the Kac-Moody algebra for all meromorphic theories at c = 8N is less than or equal to the dimension of D8N , we do this in appendix C. For rows 5 and 15 this means the bilinear pairing in these cases does not produce a valid meromorphic theory at c = 32. In turn, this rules out V58 in row 5 since it is paired with a valid theory. However in row 15 we have already ruled out V18 so we cannot say anything definite about V41. Fortunately this was ruled out in table 12. And in row 8 both partners in the pairing are consistent, it is the pairing which is inconsistent as shown by the fractional values of d1, d2.\nThis leaves rows 11, 13, 16. Rows 11 and 13 are inconclusive since the solution in the first column is inconsistent. Fortunately, again the solutions III51 and III46 in the second column were already ruled out by table 12. Row 16 is inconclusive for a different reason: we do not know if a meromorphic theory with N = 1532 exists. However again V40 was also ruled out in table 12.\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nConclusion. From table 13 we obtain the new information that V58 is not a valid CFT. We also predict that there is no meromorphic theory at c = 32 of the form E1[D\u229724,1D24,1].\n(n1, n2) = (2, 3). We go on to consider bilinear pairings to meromorphic characters of c = 32 where the integers (n1, n2) = (2, 3). In this category we find consistent, IVOA-type and inconsistent solutions that are listed in tables 14, 15 and 16 respectively.\nComments on table 14. This table has 22 bilinear pairs, all of which we will argue to be consistent CFTs. In row 1 the Baby Monster CFT with c = 472 makes its first appearance in which it is not paired with the Ising model M(4, 3), being paired instead with B8,1. This has previously appeared as one in a family of pairings in [45] (entry 1 of table 2) where it was argued that, since the existence of Br,1 as well as the Baby Monster CFT are established, the pairing actually predicts a non-lattice CFT at c = 32. The pairings in rows 3, 5\u20137, 10\u201313, 15, 17\u201319, 21 all involve the pairing of an affine theory with a CFT that was explicitly constructed as a coset in [17]. Row 20 is slightly different, being a pairing between two theories from [17], a phenomenon we are seeing for the first time. All these theories already made an appearance in our table 8 which is the context in which they were originally discovered in [17]. Their re-appearance illustrates a phenomenon that was highlighted in [45]: once a new CFT appears as a coset, it appears repeatedly in distinct coset pairings at higher total central charge. Rows 9, 16, 22 are pairings between affine theories. Even though these are known theories, the pairings merit some discussion. Row 9 is a case that was analysed in Example 2 of section 2.4, and involves a pairing of D12,1 and D20,1 that is distinct from the standard pairing to D32,1. In the present case the pairing gives rise to the c = 32 lattice theory E1[D12,1D20,1] without an enhancement of the Kac-Moody algebra. This is a known Kervaire lattice [59]. Row 16 pairs E\u229727,1 with D18,1 to a meromorphic character whose Kac-Moody algebra has dimension 896. From this pairing one would be led to predict the existence of a meromorphic theory at c = 32 with Kac-Moody algebra E1[E27,1D18,1] of rank 32 and dimension 896. Because this algebra has only simply-laced factors at level 1, and its rank equals the central charge, it must be a lattice theory. And indeed, this is again a known Kervaire lattice [59]. Row 22 pairs E8,2 with B16,1 and predicts a new meromorphic theory at c = 32 that must be a non-lattice theory (given that the rank is less than maximal, one factor has a level greater than 1, and one factor is non-simply-laced). This is again part of an infinite family in [45], corresponding to the m = 1 case of entry #15 of table 3 in that reference. Next we turn to the remaining cases in rows 2,4,8,14. For row 2, the dual of D9,1 is III50 which was previously identified from table 8 as the three-character extension E3[D231,1]. Here we see it paired to give a meromorphic theory at c = 32 with a total of 176 generators. Of these, D9,1 contributes 153 generators and a central charge 9, leaving 23 residual generators and a residual central charge of 23. These two conditions can only be met by U(1)23. Thus we predict a lattice theory at c = 32 with Kac-Moody algebra D9,1U(1)23. Comparing with [60], we see that there is indeed a lattice with 144 roots (plus 32 Cartan generators) having a D9,1 factor. This verifies the prediction following from our coset pairing and the fact that III50 was previously characterised. Note that this is not a Kervaire lattice, since apart from D9,1 the remaining symmetries are all Abelian.\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nMoving on to row 4, the dual III45 of D10,1 has been identified in eq. (3.4) as one of six possible three-character extensions. This means the pairing in the present table predicts six meromorphic theories at c = 32. Only one of these corresponds to a lattice, with algebra D10,1A 22 1,1 and this indeed exists \u2014 it is a Kervaire lattice [59] with 224 roots. For the remaining five cases one has a prediction for new meromorphic theories at c = 32, and this is again part of the infinite series of predictions in [45] where they correspond to the m = 1 case for entries 18\u201322 in table 3. Row 8 pairs E\u229726,1 with V39 which was identified in eq. (3.4) with three distinct threecharacter extensions. Thus again we have predictions for three meromorphic theories at c = 32. One is a lattice theory with algebra E26,1A102,1 that corresponds to a Kervaire lattice [59] and the other two are non-lattice theories that were predicted in entries 2,3 of table 6 [45]. These theories are part of a finite, rather than infinite, collection.\nFinally in row 14 we have a pairing of III22 and III37 which have been identified previously as E3[C8,1] and E3[E6,3G2,1] respectively. This leads to a prediction of a new meromorphic theory at c = 32 corresponding to E1[C8,1E6,3G2,1]. This is entry 4 of table 6 in [45].\nConclusion. From table 14 we were not able to characterise any admissible solutions as CFTs or otherwise, but rather started to see several predictions of meromorphic theories at c = 32. Details of these were presented in [45].\nComments on table 15. Here all the entries are of IVOA-type and all of these were previously characterised.\nComments on table 16. This table consists entirely of inconsistent pairings. In row 1 we see such a pairing between known theories: the value of d1 is fractional. This corresponds to the non-existence of a meromorphic extension E1[D24,1D24,1]. If such an extension existed it would be a Kervaire lattice, however this does not appear in the list of Kervaire lattices, in agreement with the fact that the pairing is inconsistent.\nIn row 6 we have a pairing between D9,1 and III51, however the result has N = 2476 which is greater than the maximum allowed value of 2016 at c = 32. This means III51 is not a CFT, consistent with our conclusion from table 12.\nIn row 14 we have a pairing between D10,1 and III46 with a total N = 1488. However III46 has been ruled out, and we now argue that this implies the corresponding meromorphic character is not a CFT. This crucially depends on the fact that the pairing has n1, n2 > 1. In such pairings, the meromorphic theory \u2014 if any \u2014 has a Kac-Moody algebra that is the direct sum of those of the paired solutions. Thus we can conclude that there is no meromorphic theory at cH = 32 with N = 1488 and a D10,1 factor. Similar considerations hold for rows 15, 16, 23, 24, 27\u201332, 36, 37, 39, 40 where in each case we get constraints ruling out specific possibilities for meromorphic theories at c = 32. The details are a little complicated to work out in some cases, where the valid CFT in the pairing is of GHM type. In these cases one has to look in [17] for the definition of the theory in terms of a meromorphic theory of Schellekens type and then read off the answer from [37]. The results are summarised below.\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nIn rows 25, 26, both solutions are of type V. However for row 25 we have ruled out one member, V18, and characterised V39 in eq. (3.4), and for row 26 we have already ruled out both members of the pair V18 (again) and V40. Note that we do not get a constraint on meromorphic theories in these cases. All remaining rows have an entry of III type, from which we typically do not get new information.\nConclusion. From table 16 we were not able to newly rule out any solutions from being CFTs, but instead we were able to predict the absence of meromorphic theories with the\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\n# c (h1, h2) m1 (D1, D2) W c\u0303 (h\u03031, h\u03032) m\u03031 (D\u03031, D\u03032) W\u0303 (d1, d2) N 1. 607 ( 3 7 , 8 7 ) 210 (10,285) III7 1647 ( 11 7 , 13 7 ) 41 (4797,50922) III54 (1, 1) 251\n2. 445 ( 2 5 , 6 5 ) 220 (11,275) III8 1165\n( 8 5 , 9 5 ) 58 (4959,27550) III52 (1, 2) 278\n3. 687 ( 3 7 , 9 7 ) 221 (17,782) III12 1567 ( 11 7 , 12 7 ) 78 (5070,27170) III47 (1, 1) 299\n4. 687 ( 9 7 , 3 7 ) 221 (782,17) III12 1567 ( 5 7 , 18 7 ) 1248 (130,799500) III48 (1, 1) 1469\n5. 765 ( 4 5 , 8 5 ) 380 (57,572) E\u229727.5 845\n( 6 5 , 7 5 ) 336 (770, 1452) III33 (2, 1) 716\n6. 765 ( 3 5 , 9 5 ) 437 (57,11875) III28 845\n( 7 5 , 6 5 ) 336 (1452,770) III33 (1, 2) 773\n7. 1007 ( 4 7 , 12 7 ) 380 (55,11495) III25 1247 ( 10 7 , 9 7 ) 248 (2108,2108) III35 (1, 1) 628\n8. 1007 ( 5 7 , 11 7 ) 325 (55,2925) III24 1247 ( 9 7 , 10 7 ) 248 (2108,2108) III35 (1, 1) 573\n9. 1087 ( 6 7 , 11 7 ) 378 (117,3510) III29 1167 ( 8 7 , 10 7 ) 348 (725,1972) III32 (1, 1) 726\n10. 1087 ( 4 7 , 13 7 ) 456 (39,20424) III30 1167 ( 10 7 , 8 7 ) 348 (1972,725) III32 (1, 1) 804\nTable 15.

This happens when either one solution in the bilinear pair is a WZW theory (or a known RCFT) and the other solution has integral Yi values. Furthermore, these two solutions also have a nice bilinear pairing, that is, dis are integral. In addition to the above two conditions, the N value of this bilinear pair must be less than or equal to 2016 which is the dimension of the Kac-Moody algebra D32,1. Table 17 lists the cases for which meromorphic theories at c = 32 with given values of N and simple factor in their Kac-Moody algebras have been ruled out. As a mild check of these predictions, wherever the algebra listed above is simply laced and of level 1 one can check from [59] that there are no lattice theories with complete root systems at c = 32 having these dimensions and subalgebras."

(2.7) this means n1 + n2 = 6, from which we find the three possibilities (n1, n2) = (1, 5), (2, 4) and (3, 3). We consider each one in turn.

Inconsistent pairings, cH = 40 with (n1, n2) = (1, 5).\nIn row 2 we have an inconsistent pairing, visible from the fractional value of one of the pair (d1, d2), which implies the absence of a c = 40 modular invariant with an algebra of dimension 2584. If the pairing existed then we would have a lattice theory E1[D\u229724,1D32,1]. Hence such a theory should not exist. This is a prediction about lattices with complete root systems in 40 dimensions, which we were unable to independently confirm. The pair in rows 7 and 13, and also III46 in row 11, have been ruled out by tables 7, 12 and 13. All the other entries are self-evidently inconsistent.\nConclusion. From table 18 we learn for the first time that V63 is not a CFT. With this we have completed the characterisation of all admissible solutions appearing in table 1. We also predict that there is no meromorphic theory at c = 40 of the form E1[D\u229724,1D32,1].\nConjecture. We conjecture the non-existence of meromorphic theories of the form E1[D\u229724,1D8(N\u22121),1] at c = 8N , for integer N \u2265 3.\n(n1, n2) = (2, 4). We move on to pairings with (n1, n2) = (2, 4). In these cases (as well as the ones to follow with (n1, n2) = (3, 3)), no non-trivial embeddings of Kac-Moody algebras can be involved, as we explained earlier. Thus they are relatively simpler to deal with.\nComments on table 19. This table is made up entirely of consistent bilinear pairings of known theories. Note that III50 and III45 have previously been characterised as CFT in\n\u2013 46 \u2013\n3\neq. (3.4). Hence these pairings are predictions about the existence of meromorphic theories at c = 40. More details of these predictions can be found in [45].\nConclusion. Table 19 gives us predictions for meromorphic theories at c = 40. We do not go into detail here since we have already presented these predictions in [45].\nComments on table 20. This table has just one pair of admissible characters of IVOA type. Both members have already been identified as such in previous tables.\n\u2013 47 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nComments on table 21. The rows without a type III factor are 12\u201315, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31. All of them contain precisely one member that has been shown not to be a CFT. As a consequence we again get a set of cases for which a meromorphic theory at c = 40 is ruled out. We list these below in table 22. The remaining rows have a type III factor that is paired with an affine theory in most cases, and with an inconsistent type III solution in the remaining cases. Either way we get no new information from such pairs.\nConclusion. From table 21 we were able to predict the absence of meromorphic theories with the following values of N < 3160 coupled with a particular factor in their Kac-Moody algebra.\n(n1, n2) = (3, 3).\nComments on table 23. All entries in this table are genuine coset pairs. Several CFTs of GHM type from [17] are paired with each other. This includes a self-coset in row 9. Rows 3 and 8 are similar, the theories III45,V39 were not listed in [17] but this should count as an oversight as they properly belong in table 2 of that paper. In row 7 we see a self-pairing of D20,1 to a meromorphic theory at c = 40 without enhancement of Kac-Moody algebra, so the resulting theory can be written E1[D20,1D20,1] (this is to be contrasted with the pairing of the same factors in the (n1, n2) = (1, 5) case, where the meromorphic theory is D40,1).\nComments on table 24. This table contains four pairings that all involve characters of IVOA type. Seven of these have been encountered before, but one of the solutions in row 1, with c = 2367 , is appearing here for the first time. This one has been previously noted in [18] in the context of a study of three-character solutions without Kac-Moody symmetry. Hence we denote this character as HM(7, 2).\nConclusion. In table 24 we find seven IVOA-type solutions that were previously discussed above, and one that appears for the first time in this table but has been noted before.\nComments on table 25. This table contains 10 pairings. Rows 1\u20138 have one inconsistent solution paired with a known CFT, while rows 9 and 10 are self-pairings where both members are known to be inconsistent. As a result, rows 1, 3, 6 and 7 lead to negative predictions for specific types of meromorphic theories at c = 40, while rows 9 and 10 do not. Meanwhile rows 2, 4, 5 and 8 have one factor with fractional Yi values, so these also do not lead to negative predictions for meromorphic theories. From table 25 we were able to predict the absence of meromorphic theories with the following values of N < 3160 coupled with a particular factor in their Kac-Moody algebra, which we collect in table 26."

            "text": "Table 27 lists the cases from among the admissible characters listed in table 1 that have been classified as CFTs. We note that cases 2\u20135 are most easily understood as cosets of Schellekens theories by the square of MMS [2] theories.15 These are of the same form as the cosets in [17] in that (n1, n2) = (2, 2) and the Kac-Moody algebra of the coset is simply obtained by deleting a factor from the meromorphic theory. Case 1, however, first arises as the coset of E8,1 by G\u229722,1 and subsequently as a coset of E1[D16,1] by E3[C8,1]. On the other hand case 6 is a coset of the unique theory in [37] having Abelian factors, by U(1) \u223c D1,1. We see that in some cases there are multiple CFTs corresponding to a single set of admissible characters, as was already seen in [17]. All entries of this table were identified by [36].\nNext we list the cases that were in our table 1, other than those already eliminated at the outset (namely type III and V), which we have shown in the present work cannot be identified as consistent CFTs. These fall into two classes: the first are those of IVOA type: III1, III3, III4, III5, III7, III8, III12, III24, III25, III27, III28, III29, III30, III32, III33, III35, III47, III48, III52, III54, while the second have sensible fusion rules but are nonetheless inconsistent: III17, V18, III19, III20, III21, III26, III31, V40, V41, III42, III44, III46, III51, V58, V63 (recall that the (c, h1, h2) and m1 values of these are listed in table 1). From the inconsistent list, the ten type-III solutions were first discovered as admissible characters in [28] while the five type-V solutions are among the seven that were newly found last year in [33\u201335].\nOur work once more highlights the intimate relation between general RCFT and meromorphic CFT. We see that this relation, when properly applied, allows us to rule in and also rule out characters from being CFT, and likewise gives positive and negative predictions for the existence of meromorphic theories.\n15Recall that the square of a two-character theory is a three-character theory.\n\u2013 52 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nWhile we have not aspired to mathematical rigour in this work, we believe our conclusions can and should be tested at a more formal and rigorous level. Basic properties of Modular Tensor Categories (MTC) at low numbers of primaries [53] lead us to believe that whenever two admissible characters pair up and both are known CFTs, the pair is also a CFT \u2014 but technically this is only known up to 4 primaries and a few of our examples have more primaries than that, despite having only three characters. There are also possible subtleties about linear equivalence vs equivalence of embeddings, as well as about possibly inequivalent embeddings in different simple factors of the same algebra. Such questions were addressed in [39] where the focus was on a rigorous classification for exactly two primaries in a range of central charge. Something similar can surely be attempted for three primaries (rather than three characters) in a more rigorous fashion than was done here using the MTC data for theories with three simple objects. On the other hand, a positive aspect of the present approach based on MLDE and bilinear pairing of q-series is that the classification of pairings is explicit and exhaustive, and does not rely on mathematically subtle questions. Also it raises intriguing questions about admissible characters that are not CFT \u2014 we do not know why they nevertheless exhibit bilinear pairings, and what this teaches us. This point may be of interest to the community studying vector-valued modular forms."

(A.6)\nFrom the first embedding consider the following branching rule,\n248 = (14,1)\u2295 (7,26)\u2295 (1,52) (A.7)\nNow let us employ the second embedding to write the above branching rule as,\n(14,1)\u2295(7,26)\u2295(1,52) = (14,1,1)\u2295(7,((5,1)\u2295(3,7)))\u2295(1,((3,1)\u2295(5,7)\u2295(1,14))) = (14,1,1)\u2295(7,5,1)\u2295(7,3,7)\u2295(1,3,1)\u2295(1,5,7)\u2295(1,1,14),\n(A.8)\nwhere in the second equality we are just expanding the first equality and considering that the numbers inside a parenthesis have to be multiplied.\nNow let us compute the embedding indices a, b, c,\nLE8(248) = 60 LG2net = 0 + 0 + 42 + 0 + 10 + 8 = 60 LA1net = 1\u00d7 14\u00d7 LA1(1) + 1\u00d7 7\u00d7 LA1(5) + 7\u00d7 7\u00d7 LA1(3) + 1\u00d7 1\u00d7 LA1(3)\n+ 7\u00d7 1\u00d7 LA1(5) + 14\u00d7 1\u00d7 LA1(1) = 0 + 140 + 196 + 4 + 140 + 0 = 480 LG2net = 8 + 10 + 42 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 60\nthus, a = L G2 net LE8(248) = 60 60 = 1\nand, b = L A1 net LE8(248) = 480 60 = 8\nand, c = L G2 net LE8(248) = 60 60 = 1 (A.9)\n\u2013 56 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nHence we have: E8 n\u2212m\u2212\u2192 G(1)2 \u00d7A (8) 1 \u00d7G (1) 2 which implies that in the affine case we would get: E\u03028,1 n\u2212m\u2212\u2192 G\u03022,1 \u00d7 A\u03021,8 \u00d7 G\u03022,1.\nExample 3: non-maximal embedding.

Let us compute the embedding indices, a, b, c, r, s, for the above three embeddings.\nE8 \u2192 D (a) 8 . Now let us consider the embedding E8 \u2192 D (a) 8 (maximal and R type). For the above embedding consider the following branching,\n248 = 120\u2295 128 (A.12) now, LE8(248) = 60\nLD8(120) = 28 LD8(128) = 32\nthus, a = L D8(120) + LD8(128) LE8(248) = 60 60 = 1 (A.13)\nHence, we have: E8 \u2192 D(1)8 .\nE8 m\u2212\u2192 D(a)8 . Let us consider D8 \u2192 D (b) 4 \u00d7D (c) 4 (maximal and R type),\n120 = (8v,8v)\u2295(28,1)\u2295(1,28) (A.14) now, LD8(120) = 28\nLD4net = 8\u00d7LD4(8v)+1\u00d7LD4(28)+28\u00d7LD4(1) = 8\u00d72+1\u00d712+28\u00d70 = 28 LD4net = 8\u00d7LD4(8v)+28\u00d7LD4(1)+1\u00d7LD4(28) = 8\u00d72+28\u00d70+1\u00d712 = 28\nthus, b= L D4 net LD8(120) = 28 28 = 1\nand, c= L D4 net LD8(120) = 28 28 = 1 (A.15)\nHence, we have: D8 m\u2212\u2192 D(1)4 \u00d7D (1) 4 .\n\u2013 57 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nE8 \u2192 D (r) 4 \u00d7D (s) 4 .

This implies that, D4 as a sub-algebra of E8 has commutant D4 inside E8. This is the statement that was made in [17].\nExample 4: D16 \u2192 D (a) 1 \u00d7 A (b) 15 . Here we consider D16 \u2192 D (a) 1 \u00d7 A (b) 15 (which is a maximal R type embedding). For the above embedding consider the following branching,\n496 = (1,255)\u2295 (1,1) + (1,120)\u2295 (1,120) (A.18) now, LD16(496) = 60\nLD1net = 255\u00d7 LD1(1) + 1\u00d7 LD1(1) + 2\u00d7 120\u00d7 LD1(1)\n= 255\u00d7 0 + 1\u00d7 0 + 240\u00d7 14 = 60\nLA15net = 1\u00d7 LA15(255) + 1\u00d7 LA15(1) + 2\u00d7 1\u00d7 LA15(120) = 1\u00d7 32 + 1\u00d7 0 + 2\u00d7 1\u00d7 14 = 60 (A.19)\nHence, we get, for the embedding indices, a, b,\na = L D1 net LD16(496) = 60 60 = 1\nand, b = L A15 net LD16(496) = 60 60 = 1 (A.20)\nHence, we have: D16 \u2192 D(1)1 \u00d7 A (1) 15 and in the affine case we would have: D\u030216,1 \u2192 D\u03021,1 \u00d7 A\u030215,1.\n\u2013 58 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nExample 5: D16 \u2192 A (a) 1 \u00d7 C (b) 8 . Here we consider D16 \u2192 A (a) 1 \u00d7 C (b) 8 (which is a maximal S type embedding). For the above embedding consider the following branching,\n496 = (1,136)\u2295 (3,1)\u2295 (3,119) (A.21) now, LD16(496) = 60\nLA1net = 136\u00d7 LA1(1) + 1\u00d7 LA1(3) + 119\u00d7 LA1(3) = 136\u00d7 0 + 1\u00d7 4 + 119\u00d7 4 = 480\nLC8net = 1\u00d7 LC8(136) + 3\u00d7 LC8(1) + 3\u00d7 LC8(119) = 1\u00d7 18 + 3\u00d7 0 + 3\u00d7 14 = 60 (A.22)\nHence, we get, for the embedding indices, a, b,\na = L A1 net LD16(496) = 480 60 = 8\nand, b = L C8 net LD16(496) = 60 60 = 1 (A.23)\nHence, we have: D16 \u2192 A(8)1 \u00d7C (1) 8 and in the affine case we would have: D\u030216,1 \u2192 A\u03021,8\u00d7C\u03028,1.\nB Infinite family of c = 8 and c = 16 for category III solutions\nIn this appendix, we briefly summarise the results of section 2.3 of [34] which explains, from an MLDE perspective, why there are an infinite family of c = 8 and c = 16 for category III solutions (this fact was previously noted in [27]). It is shown in [34] that the identity character \u03c70 can be written in terms of the other two characters, \u03c71, \u03c72 as,\n\u03c70(q) = q 1 2\u2212\u03b11\u2212\u03b12 \u221e\u2211 n=0 [ a0,n +A1 q\u2212 1 2 +2\u03b11+\u03b12 a1,n +A2 q\u2212 1 2 +\u03b11+2\u03b12 a3,n ] qn, (B.1)\nwhere ai,n are the Fourier coefficients in the q-series of the character \u03c7i(q) and i = 0, 1, 2. Now say the values of \u03b11 and \u03b12, for which admissible solutions, exist are such that \u221212 + 2\u03b11 + \u03b12 and \u2212 1 2 + \u03b11 + 2\u03b12 are not non-negative integers, then to get admissible solution for \u03c70, we have to set A1 and A2 to be zero. This is what happens in most examples. However, one can imagine the following situation. (i) If \u221212 + 2\u03b11 + \u03b12 is a non-negative integer, then A1 isn\u2019t required to vanish. A1 can take any positive integral value and we would have an admissible solution for \u03c70.\n\u2212 12 + 2\u03b11 + \u03b12 \u2208 Z\u22650, A1 \u2208 Z\u22650\n\u03c71(q) = q 1 2\u2212\u03b12\u2212\u03b13 \u221e\u2211 n=0 [ a0,n +A1 q\u2212 1 2 +2\u03b11+\u03b12 a1,n ] qn. (B.2)\nWe thus have an infinite number of admissible character solutions, parametrised by A1, in (B.2). All members of this infinite family have the same indices and hence the same c,\n\u2013 59 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nh1, h2 and also they have the same Wronskian. However, they are different solutions as in they differ in the identity character. (ii) If \u221212 + \u03b11 + 2\u03b12 is a non-negative integer, then A2 isn\u2019t required to vanish. A2 can take any positive integral value and we would have an admissible solution for \u03c70.\n\u2212 12 + \u03b11 + 2\u03b12 \u2208 Z\u22650, A2 \u2208 Z\u22650\n\u03c71(q) = q 1 2\u2212\u03b11\u2212\u03b12 \u221e\u2211 n=0 [ a0,n +A2 q\u2212 1 2 +\u03b11+2\u03b12 a2,n ] qn. (B.3)\nWe thus have an infinite number of admissible character solutions, parametrised by A2, in (B.3). All members of this infinite family have the same indices and hence the same c, h1, h2 and also they have the same Wronskian. However, they are different solutions as in they differ in the identity character. So, in the study of admissible solutions to [3,0] MLDEs, one encounters the above two infinite families of CFTs where each family has the same c, h1, h2 values, one following (B.2) and another following (B.3). Note that, D\u229724,1 is a part of the infinite family of c = 8 solutions with m1 = 56, D8,1 is a part of the infinite family of c = 8 solutions with m1 = 120 and D\u229744,1 is a part of the infinite family of c = 16 solution with m1 = 112. The key point to note here is that, in the notation of [34], D\u229724,1, D8,1 and D\u229744,1 are the only three solutions which belong to both category I and III."

            "heading": "C Upper bound on N for meromorphic theories",
            "text": "Here we prove the following bound: for any meromorphic CFT with c = 8N , the dimension N of its Kac-Moody algebra is bounded above by 8N(16N \u2212 1). This bound is saturated by the meromorphic theory E1[D8N ].16 To show this, let us first consider meromorphic theories with a \u201ccomplete\u201d Kac-Moody algebra with simple factors, i.e. theories whose entire central charge comes from non-Abelian Kac-Moody factors. This holds for 69 of 71 theories at c = 24, and additional examples come from lattice theories with \u201ccomplete root systems\u201d at higher values of c such as Kervaire lattices in 32d [59]. In this situation we have:\nc = \u2211 a ca, ca = ka dimGa ka + ga\n(C.1)\nwhere ka is the level, ga is the dual Coxeter number and dimGa is the dimension of the a\u2019th simple factor. The sum runs over all the simple factors. Next, we note that simply-laced algebras Ga satisfy the inequality, rank Ga \u2264 ca \u2264 dimGa where the first inequality is saturated at ka = 1 and the second as ka \u2192\u221e. In fact, as one can easily check, the same inequality is satisfied by non-simply-laced algebras, except that the lower bound becomes strict and is never saturated.\n16We are grateful to Brandon Rayhaun for suggesting this line of argument.\n\u2013 60 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nMeanwhile, the total dimension of the Kac-Moody algebra is:\nN = \u2211 a dimGa (C.2)\nOur problem then is to maximise N keeping c fixed. Now we further restrict to complete Kac-Moody algebras with just one simple factor. Using standard formulae for the dimensions Nr and dual Coxeter numbers of the classical compact Lie algebras (Ar, Br, Cr, Dr) we find:\nc(Ar,k) = kr(r + 2) k + r + 1\nc(Br,k) = kr(2r + 1) k + 2r \u2212 1\nc(Cr,k) = kr(2r + 1) k + r + 1\nc(Dr,k) = kr(2r \u2212 1) k + 2r \u2212 2\n(C.3)\nIt follows that, at fixed central charge, r decreases as k increases. Thus to maximise the rank in each family (which maximises the dimension, which is monotonic in the rank) we must take k = 1, which gives the simpler formulae:\nc(Ar,1) = r c(Br,1) = r + 12 c(Cr,1) = r(2r + 1) r + 2 c(Dr,1) = r\n(C.4)\nNotice that c(Br,1), c(Cr,1) are non-integral for all r \u2265 2. From the above, the dimension of the algebra at fixed c is:\nAr,1 : N = c(c+ 2) Br,1 : N = c(2c\u2212 1)\nCr,1 : N = 1 4 ( 7c+ c2 + c \u221a 1 + 14c+ c2 ) Dr,1 : N = c(2c\u2212 1)\n(C.5)\nIt is easy to verify that for any fixed c \u2265 8, the common value of N for Br, Dr is the largest in the above set. However since Br has non-integral central charge it cannot be a complete simple factor. Therefore Dr,1 has the largest possible dimension among simple algebras at a fixed integral central charge. Moreover there is indeed a meromorphic theory with Kac-Moody algebra D8N,1 for every r, corresponding to the modular invariant extension E1[D8N,1] (for N = 1 this is E8,1, while for all N \u2265 2 the extension does not enhance the Kac-Moody algebra).\n\u2013 61 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 2 3\nNow we can go on to the general case: direct sums of Kac-Moody algebras, including exceptional as well as Abelian algebras, at arbitrary levels. We also allow meromorphic theories where the Kac-Moody algebra is not complete (for example the algebra could contain minimal model or higher-spin modules). We argue that all these generalisations lower the dimension of the Kac-Moody algebra, proving the bound. First, when we take direct sums, the sum of dimensions of the factors is always less than the dimension of a simple algebra of the same c. Since there are finitely many exceptional algebras one can also verify explicitly that none of them \u201cwins\u201d over D8N,1. Also for Abelian algebras the dimensions are always smaller than those of non-Abelian algebras of comparable central charge. Second, raising the level of any factor raises its central charge without changing its dimension, and therefore lowers its dimension for fixed central charge. Finally if the Kac-Moody algebra is not complete, its dimension will be smaller than that of a complete algebra with the same c. This then proves the result.\nOpen Access.
