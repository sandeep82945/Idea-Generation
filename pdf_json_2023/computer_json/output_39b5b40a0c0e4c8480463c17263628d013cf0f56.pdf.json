    "abstractText": "As recommendation systems heavily depend on user data, these systems are susceptible to potential privacy breaches. To mitigate this issue, diferential privacy (DP) protection techniques have been developed to ofer robust privacy safeguards. Nevertheless, a majority of the extant DP-based recommendation algorithms tend to introduce excessive noise, consequently impairing the quality of recommendations. In response, this study presents a novel DP-preserving recommendation algorithm that integrates matrix factorization (MF) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Initially, the MF problem is transformed into two interrelated optimization problems, namely, the user-hidden factor and the item-hidden factor. Subsequently, GA is employed to address these optimization issues. An enhancement index mechanism is incorporated into the individual selection of GA, while the variation process of GA is devised based on identifying crucial hidden factors. Utilizing the enhancement index mechanism aids in minimizing the algorithm\u2019s perturbation level, thereby achieving an optimal balance between privacy protection and algorithm utility. Experimental analyses, encompassing recommendation accuracy, efciency, and parameter variation efects, are conducted on Last.fm and Flixster datasets. Te fndings corroborate that the proposed system outperforms existing alternatives under stringent privacy constraints, thereby attesting to its efcacy.",

To mitigate this issue, diferential privacy (DP) protection techniques have been developed to ofer robust privacy safeguards. Nevertheless, a majority of the extant DP-based recommendation algorithms tend to introduce excessive noise, consequently impairing the quality of recommendations. In response, this study presents a novel DP-preserving recommendation algorithm that integrates matrix factorization (MF) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Initially, the MF problem is transformed into two interrelated optimization problems, namely, the user-hidden factor and the item-hidden factor. Subsequently, GA is employed to address these optimization issues. An enhancement index mechanism is incorporated into the individual selection of GA, while the variation process of GA is devised based on identifying crucial hidden factors. Utilizing the enhancement index mechanism aids in minimizing the algorithm\u2019s perturbation level, thereby achieving an optimal balance between privacy protection and algorithm utility. Experimental analyses, encompassing recommendation accuracy, efciency, and parameter variation efects, are conducted on Last.fm and Flixster datasets. Te fndings corroborate that the proposed system outperforms existing alternatives under stringent privacy constraints, thereby attesting to its efcacy."

            "text": "In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet economy, there is a trend of rapid growth in the amount of information on the network, making it sometimes difcult for users to quickly flter out the information they are interested in from the vast amount of information. Although some search engines (such as Baidu and Google) have developed and adopted some special search algorithms to achieve targeted search according to keywords entered by users, the results searched in this way often cannot meet the real needs of users to quickly obtain the information they need. In order to make it more convenient and easier for users to get the information they need from the Web, personalized recommendation services are becoming an integral part of web application services [1]. Terefore, recommendation systems are widely used and rapidly spreading. Recommendation systems are designed to deliver\ninformation of interest directly to users according to their preferences, which can signifcantly reduce the workload of sifting through large amounts of information and bring convenience to users\u2019 life and work [2].\nTe core part of a recommendation system is the recommendation algorithm, and a high-performance recommendation algorithm is naturally the key to building a highquality recommendation system. As a mainstream recommendation algorithm, collaborative fltering (CF) uses the user\u2019s historical evaluation information to predict the user\u2019s preference for unknown items and make recommendations accordingly [3]. CF techniques need to use a large amount of user data, and there is a risk of user privacy leakage. In the neighbor-based CF technique, an attacker can infer the target user\u2019s rating of an item by tracking the changes in the recommendation list of neighboring users [4]. In MF-based CF techniques, since the decomposition of the resulting matrix of hidden factors carries data information, it may be\nHindawi International Journal of Intelligent Systems Volume 2023, Article ID 2959503, 14 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/2959503\nused by attackers to infer users\u2019 rating data through reconstruction attacks and other means. Te compromised ratings may be further used to infer the user\u2019s gender, age, and other information, violating the user\u2019s privacy [5]. If users refuse to provide some information for security reasons, the performance of the recommendation system may be degraded and even personalized services may not be provided. Terefore, it is very necessary to consider the privacy protection of users\u2019 information in the recommendation system.\nIn recent years, DP techniques have become a hot research topic by adding controlled noise to protect individual user privacy information without changing the overall pattern characteristics of the data. Santos-Lozada et al. [6] proposed a defnition of DP. Tey provided a good theoretical basis for implementing efective privacy protection in recommender systems. Bao et al. [7] introduced DP protection into the CF technique and achieved DP protection by perturbing the item covariance matrix. Meng et al. [8] applied DP to the CF recommendation algorithm based on neighbors and achieved privacy protection by adding noise to the neighbor selection and similarity metric processes. Xu et al. [9] proposed two privacy-preserving schemes by adding Laplace noise to the original rating and user similarity metric processes, respectively. Mewada [10] proposed a DP-preserving neighbor-based CF algorithm for the privacy leakage problem faced by the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. For label-based recommendation systems, Wang et al. [11] proposed a DP-preserving algorithm for modifying and publishing user profles. Te algorithm is able to perform label recommendation and protect users\u2019 privacy within a certain accuracy loss.\nFor the MF-based recommendation algorithm, Hien and Gillis [12] perturbed the objective function of the MF algorithm under the consideration of the untrustworthiness of the recommendation system. Tey used the matrix of itemhidden factors with privacy protection implemented for the recommendation task. Shin et al. [13] proposed a personalized DP recommendation algorithm based on probability MF assuming that users have diferent degrees of privacy protection needs. Yu et al. [14] proposed a privacy MF scheme based on joint optimization by perturbing the objective function. Gao et al. [15] applied DP protection to the MF recommendation algorithm and designed three ways to add noise, i.e., in the input information, in the training process, and in the output information, respectively. Based on this idea, Yang et al. [16] designed 3 DP-preserving models on the SVD++ model.\nMost of the current work implements DP protection by adding noise terms to various results of the MF process (e.g., gradient, hidden factor matrix, and objective function), and such schemes have the following problems: (1) higher noise: higher privacy protection requirements or sensitivities can increase the variance of the noise distribution, leading to the inclusion of excessive noise. (2) Nongeneralizability: the noise addition method may cause the fnal solution to be infeasible for constrained problems. (3) Te importance of the hidden factor is not considered, which afects the algorithm\u2019s solving efciency.\nTo address the abovementioned problems, this paper proposes a DP-preserving recommendation algorithm that fuses MF and the genetic algorithm. It introduces the genetic algorithm into the MF task so that the DP protection can be achieved by perturbing the selection process of candidate solutions without relying on the abovementioned method of adding noise. Meanwhile, the search for solutions in the genetic algorithm will be performed in the feasible domain, which can be easily extended to MF problems with constraints. Several sets of experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper can obtain higher accuracy on the basis of ensuring privacy protection and has better practical application value."

            "text": "2.1. MF and CF. Usually, recommendation systems can be classifed into three categories as follows: content-based recommendations, CF-based recommendations, and hybrid approach-based recommendations [17]. Te specifc classifcation is shown in Figure 1.\nTe recommendation based on CF is to analyze the user\u2019s historical behavior data to fnd people who have similar behavior with that of the user or items that are similar to the items they are interested in. Ten, by continuously fltering out those items that do not interest them, the needs of that user are increasingly satisfed. CF generally uses the nearest neighbor technique. Its recommendation mechanism is to calculate the distance between users or items based on the user-item rating matrix and then fnd the nearest neighbors of the target user or item and make recommendations based on the nearest neighbors. According to whether machine learning ideas are applied, CF recommendation can be divided into neighborhood-based CF recommendation and model-based CF recommendation [18]. Figure 2 explains what is meant by CF through a schematic diagram.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the CF algorithm fnds videos that users may like in an intuitive way by using the user\u2019s viewing history to fnd similar users who have watched the same videos as the target user, Sam.Ten, it fnds other videos that these similar users like to watch and recommends them to the target user Sam.\nMF is a typical algorithm of the implicit semantic recommendation model, which is one of the CF methods belonging to the model-based approach [19]. Compared with the traditional memory-based CF recommendationmethods for users and items, the model-based MF recommendation algorithm has a better recommendation efect. Moreover, MF can fully consider various factors that have an impact on the data and possesses very good scalability. MF algorithms are widely used because they are easy to implement and have excellent scalability. In the Netfix Prize competition, the recommendation based on MF has achieved very good recommendation results.\n2.2. Research on theApplication of DP inCFRecommendation Algorithms. Diferential privacy (DP) is a privacypreserving technique [20] that aims to protect individual\nprivate information while allowing statistical analysis of data. Te technique was frst proposed by Li et al. [21] in 2006 and has been widely used in the felds of data publishing, machine learning, and recommender systems. Te core principle of diferential privacy is to introduce controlled random noise into the statistical results so that an attacker cannot infer any specifc information about an individual from the output data. DP provides a powerful privacy-preserving mechanism that allows dataset\npublishers to share the aggregated results of the data without revealing sensitive information about individuals.\nTe exponential mechanism is an important tool for implementing randomization in diferential privacy. Its basic principle is to introduce noise by calculating the sensitivity of each output to provide diferential privacy protection. In the exponential mechanism, for each possible output, its sensitivity with respect to the input data is computed and randomly sampled according to the\nprobability distribution of the exponential distribution to obtain the fnal diferential privacy output.\nDiferential privacy and exponential mechanisms have a wide range of applications in recommender systems. By introducing the randomization mechanism of diferential privacy, recommender systems can provide users with accurate and personalized recommendation results while protecting their privacy. For example, in collaborative fltering-based recommendation algorithms, by introducing diferential privacy and the exponential mechanism, noise can be added to the user rating matrix, thus realizing user privacy protection. Meanwhile, the recommender system can use the index mechanism to randomize the recommendation results according to the user\u2019s personalized preferences and increase the diversity of the recommendation results. Terefore, the application of DP technology to the protection of recommender systems has become a hot spot in the current research.\nWang et al. [22] proposed a recommendation scheme based on DP protection through the Laplacian mechanism of the DP recommendation scheme. However, in their scheme, they introduced a randomperturbationmethod to process the user\u2019s historical data and generate useful data, which may have uncontrollable noise. Shen et al. [23] mentioned a federated diferential privacy method for collaborative fltering. Te method introduces the idea of federated learning in collaborative fltering. However, these issues need to be better handled as the diference in data distribution between different data sources, and the imbalance in data volume may lead to degradation in the generalization performance of the model. Hu et al. [24] proposed a new federated edge learning framework based on hybrid diferential privacy and adaptive compression for industrial data processing. Experimental results show that the method is very efective in industrial edge computing scenarios and also opens up new directions for the efect of diferential privacy in federated learning. However, the adaptive federated diferential privacy technique proposed in this method may lead to an increase in noise or over elimination of noise while protecting individual privacy, afecting the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm. A better tradeof between privacy protection and data quality is needed.\nMatrix factorization (MF) is a commonly used technique in recommender systems, which maps users and items to a hidden factor space of the same dimension. By learning the hidden factors of users and items, the potential feature relationships between them can be extracted to achieve personalized recommendations. Tere are also many studies on the application of matrix decomposition methods in recommender systems; for example, Fan et al. [25] proposed a collaborative fltering model based on graph neural networks for heterogeneous graphs. Tey learned the complex relationship between users and items through graph neural networks and fully exploited the interaction information between users and items in the graph structure, thus improving the performance of the recommender system. However, the high computational complexity of graph neural networks when facing large-scale data may lead to a decrease in the efciency of training and inference. Jing\net al. [26] proposed a multiview fusion recommendation algorithm with an attentive deep neural network. Te model designs a two-stage joint learning solution that combines user attributes, item attributes, and user-item interaction information into a unifed framework. Experimental results on real datasets show that the algorithm achieves high recommendation accuracy even with extremely sparse data. Te method fuses information from diferent views, thus improving the personalization efect of the recommender system. However, when faced with heterogeneous data with large diferences in quality, the method may overft lowquality views, thus afecting the recommendation efect.\nTe genetic algorithm (GA) is an optimization algorithm that can be used to solve complex optimization problems. In recent years, researchers have begun to apply genetic algorithms to recommender systems to improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendation algorithms. Alhijawi and Kilani [27] proposed a novel genetic-based recommender system. Te system relies on semantic information and historical rating data. Te experimental results demonstrate a more accurate prediction performance than other collaborative fltering recommender systems. However, the system may sufer from slow convergence, and better design of algorithm parameters and strategies is needed to improve the efciency and convergence of the algorithm. Wei et al. [28] proposed a hybrid probabilistic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for solving the cold-start problem. Te method optimizes the recommendation results by the genetic algorithm to improve the recommendation accuracy in the case of cold start. However, it may be more sensitive to missing data when dealing with the cold-start problem and needs to better deal with data incompleteness to further improve the recommendation results."

Te hidden factor corresponding to user p is denoted as Up \u2208 Rd, and the matrix consisting of the hidden factors of all users is denoted as U. Te hidden factor of item x is denoted as Vx \u2208 Rd, and the matrix consisting of the hidden factors of all items is denoted as V. MF is shown in Figure 3.\nTen, the MF algorithm is to solve for best U and V satisfying the following equation:\nminf(U, V) \ufffd min  (p,x)\u2208K rpx \u2212 U N p Vx \n2 , (1)\nwhere rpx is the rating of item x by user p in the user rating matrix and K is the set of user-item pairs corresponding to the observed rating data.

For any neighboring datasets D and D\u2032 that difer by at most one data, and for all possible outputs O in the range of the randomized algorithm G, the diferential privacy (DP) guarantee holds. (Te O and G in this\nsentence are formulas). G satisfes \u03b5-DP when and only if the following equation is satisfed:\nUr[G(D) \u2208 O]\u2a7d e\u03b5Ur G D\u2032  \u2208 O , (2)\nwhere \u03b5 is the privacy budget, and the smaller the value of \u03b5, the higher the level of demand for privacy protection.\n3.2.1. Exponential Mechanism. Te exponential mechanism [29] is a technical means to achieve DP protection, which is defned as follows.\nExponential mechanism: let the input of the randomized algorithm W be the dataset D and the output be \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. Te function V(D,\u03c9)\u27f6 R is the availability function of \u03c9. If the algorithm W selects and outputs \u03c9 from \u03a9 with a probability proportional to exp (\u03b5V(D,\u03c9)/\u0394), then algorithm W provides \u03b5-DP protection and is said to be an exponential mechanism, where \u0394 is the damping factor of the availability function V(D,\u03c9), also called the sensitivity of V(D,\u03c9). It indicates the maximum impact of the difference of individual data on V(D,\u03c9). We assume that D\u2032 and D are neighboring datasets, and \u0394 satisfes the inequality:\n\u0394\u2a7e2 max \u03c9\u2208\u03a9,D,D\u2032\nV(D,\u03c9) \u2212 V D\u2032,\u03c9 . (3)\n3.2.2. Enhanced Exponential Mechanism. In contrast to the exponential mechanism, the application of the augmented exponential mechanism is limited to availability functions with a specifc form:\nf(D,\u03c9) \ufffd b(\u03c9) +  n\u2208D v(n,\u03c9), (4)\nwhere D is a dataset containing t tuples, T is the range of values of any tuple n, v(n,\u03c9) is the tuple ft function, which indicates how well the model fts a single tuple n in D, and b(\u03c9) is a function independent of the dataset D. Based on this availability function, the augmented exponential mechanism is defned as follows.\nEnhanced exponential mechanism (EEM): let the input of the randomized algorithm W be the dataset D and the output be \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. Te algorithmW selects and outputs from \u03a9 with a probability proportional to exp (\u03b5f(D,\u03c9)/\u0394), where f(D,\u03c9) satisfes equation (4), and \u0394 satisfes the following inequality:\n\u0394\u2a7emin 2 max n,n\u2032\u2208T,\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 v(n,\u03c9) \u2212 v n\u2032,\u03c9 ,\n2 max n\u2208T,\u03c9,\u03c9\u2032\u2208\u03a9\nv(n,\u03c9) \u2212 v n,\u03c9\u2032 .\n\u23a7\u23aa \u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa \u23aa\u23a9\n\u23ab\u23aa \u23aa\u23ac\n\u23aa \u23aa\u23ad\n. (5)\nTen, the algorithm W provides \u03b5-diference privacy protection and is called the enhanced exponential mechanism. From equation (5), it can be seen that the diference between the enhanced exponential mechanism and the standard exponential mechanism is that the damping factor\u0394 of the former takes into account the maximum diference between v(n,\u03c9) and v(n,\u03c9\u2032). Tis is more suitable for the case where the degree of variation between solutions in the candidate solution set is relatively small due to the fact that max may obtain a smaller value at this time. Te privacy-preserving scheme proposed in this paper will take advantage of this feature to improve the algorithm utility.\n3.3. Privacy Genetic MF Algorithm. Tis algorithm improves the privacy genetic algorithm and proposes the adjusted private genetic algorithm (APrivGene). Te APrivGene algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem shown below, and the privacy protection of the MF process is implemented by introducing an enhanced indexmechanism in the selection phase. Te APrivGene algorithm is presented in the order of execution in 3 aspects as follows: initialization, selection, and variation.\nInitialization phase: each control parameter, including \u03b5, is set. Ten, ld-dimensional vectors are randomly generated as the initial candidate solution set \u03a9, and the objective function value of each solution is calculated as the ftness value of the genetic algorithm.\nSelection phase: with f(D,\u03c9) as the availability function and using \u03b5/2NA as the privacy budget for the selection operation, the enhanced exponential mechanism (EEM) is applied to select \u03c9 from \u03a9 with probability proportional to exp (\u03b5f(D,\u03c9)/2NA\u0394). To efectively mitigate the\nperturbations introduced in the selection phase, only a single individual is selected for the subsequent operation, after which \u03a9 is left empty and ready to admit new solutions.\nVariation stage: to avoid excessive sensitivity caused by crossover operations, only variation operations are used. To improve the efciency of the search, the variational perturbation is generated using the Corsi variational operator with high global search efciency; that is, a random perturbation is generated from the standard Corsi distribution C (0,1). Ten, with the aim of fnding the most important hidden factor, let the variation operation vary for each hidden factor and search only on one dimension z at a time. Since the preference of a user or item for a hidden factor can be classifed as positive or negative, perturbations on individual hidden factors are correspondingly designed in both positive and negative directions. Te abovementioned variation is performed for each dimension, and two new solutions are generated for each variation and added to \u03a9, fnally forming a new set of candidate solutions.\nAfter generating the new set, the variation step size \u03b7 is reduced using the decay factor \u03b2 to gradually reduce the search range and improve the search efciency. Ten, the selection session is returned, and the next cycle is entered. When the maximum number of iterations A is reached, the fnal solution \u03c9\u2217 is selected using the EEM approach. Te pseudocode of the abovementioned improved privacy genetic algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.\nTe proposed algorithm revolves around the decomposition of the scoring matrix of the recommendation system and transforms the process of solving the hidden factor matrices U and V into two alternating optimization processes. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization process, and an enhanced exponential mechanism is introduced in the solution process, which in turn makes theMF process satisfy DP protection.Te general fow of the algorithm in this paper is as follows:\n(1) To improve the rating prediction accuracy, the user rating matrix r is preprocessed.Tat is, the boundary parameter is set to B, and the ratings are transformed to the range of [-H, H] to obtain the new user rating matrix R. Ten, the matrix R is decomposed by the hidden factor:\nU, V \ufffd argmin U,V  (p,x)\u2208K Rpx \u2212 U N p Vx \n2 . (6)\nWhere Rpx is the true rating of item x by user p in R. Te objective of the hidden factor decomposition is to fnd the U and V matrices that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and true ratings.\n(2) Te objective problem of equation (6) is converted into two types of feature solving tasks as follows: (1) solving the vector of hidden factors of users and (2) solving the vector of hidden factors of items. Tat is, in solving Up, the matrix V is considered as a constant, and the objective function is constructed as follows:\nf p\nV Dp, Up  \ufffd \u2212  x\u2208Xp\nRpx \u2212 U N p Vx \n2 \ufffd \nn\u2208Dp\nv n, Up . (7)\nWhere v(n,Up) \ufffd \u2212 (Rpx \u2212 UNp Vx) 2 is a tuple ftting function for a single tuple n \ufffd (Vx, Rpx), which characterizes the prediction efect on a single rating, Vx \ufffd (Vx1, Vx2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Vxd) denotes the vector of hidden factors for item x, Dp \ufffd (Vx, Rpx)|x \u2208 Xp  is the set of binary tuples about the user p, and Xp is the set of items evaluated by the user p. To guarantee the accuracy of rating prediction, upper and lower bounds are set on the hidden factor Vx: |Vxz|\u2a7d 1, z \u2208 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d{ }. Similarly, in solving Vx, keeping the V matrix constant, the objective function is constructed as follows:\nf x U Dx, Vx(  \ufffd \u2212 \np\u2208Px\nRpx \u2212 U N p Vx \n2 \ufffd \nn\u2208Dx\nv n, Vx( . (8)\nWhere v(n, Vx) \ufffd \u2212 (Rpx \u2212 UNp Vx) 2, n \ufffd (Up, Rpx), andUp \ufffd (Up1, Up2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Upd) are the vector of hidden factors for the user p.Dx \ufffd (Up, Rpx) \u2223 p \u2208 Px  is the set of binary groups about the item x.Px is the set of users who have evaluated the item x.We set upper and lower bounds on the hidden factor Up: |Upz|\u2a7d 1, z \u2208 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d{ }.\n(3) First, keeping the matrix V constant, we use previously designed APrivGene to solve the optimization problem shown in equation (7) for each user, obtain the corresponding user hidden factor, and update the matrix U. Ten, keeping the matrix U constant, we use previously designed APrivGene to solve the optimization problem shown in equation (8) for each item, obtain the corresponding item hidden factor, and update the matrix Q. Te abovementioned process is repeated alternately to continuously optimize the matricesU andV until the maximum number of iterations N is reached.\nTe pseudocode of the above privacy genetic MF algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2.\nTe computational complexity of the proposed method was discussed and analyzed, summarized as follows.\nIn terms of time complexity, the method involves several crucial steps. Te preprocessing step, where the user rating matrix R is transformed into a bounded range, takes O(n) time, with n representing the number of nonzero elements in the rating matrix. Te matrix factorization (the MF algorithm) contributes O(nd) time, where d signifes the dimension of the hidden factor matrices U and V. Te outer loop iteration, conducted N times, accounts for O(N) time. In addition, calculating objective functions and obtaining binary groups have time complexities of O(1) and O(m), respectively, where m is the number of items evaluated by a user. Te privacy genetic algorithm (APrivGene) used for obtaining hidden factors takesO(Ald) time for each user and O(n\u2217Ald) time for each item, where A corresponds to the number of genetic algorithm iterations and l denotes the\npopulation size. Te total time complexity of the method is summarized as follows:\nO(n + nd + N\u2217 (m\u2217Ald) + N\u2217 (n\u2217Ald)). (9)\nIn terms of space complexity, the method requires storage for various components. Te user rating matrix R\u2032, with bounded ratings, has a space complexity of O(n). Meanwhile, the hidden factor matrices U and V occupy the O(nd) space. Consequently, the total space complexity is\nO(n + nd). (10)\nIn conclusion, the proposed method has been thoroughly analyzed for its computational complexity. Te time complexity assessment provides valuable insights into the method\u2019s efciency in real-world scenarios, while the space complexity estimation helps in understanding the memory requirements for storing matrices and data\nduring algorithm execution. Tis comprehensive understanding of computational complexities is crucial for evaluating the method\u2019s practical feasibility and potential applications.\nIn summary, this paper proposes a diferential privacy-preserving recommendation algorithm that incorporates matrix decomposition and the genetic algorithm. Te algorithm employs an augmented exponential mechanism to mitigate the degree of perturbation of the algorithm, thus better realizing the diferential privacy protection. Te method successfully solves the problems of privacy leakage and data security in recommender systems while maintaining the efciency of the recommendation algorithm and the personalized features of the recommendation results.

Te hardware confguration selected for the experiments in this section is as follows: Intel i5-6400K 3.2 GHz, memory 8GHx, and system Win8 fagship version. To verify the efectiveness of the algorithm in this paper, four algorithms from literatures [29\u201332] are selected here as the comparison algorithms. Te experimental objects of the algorithms in this paper are the data in Table 2.\nTe relevant parameters in Table 2 are parameter P which is the number of user sets in the experimental object, parameter S1 which is the number of relationships between users in the experimental object, parameter S2 which is the number of relationships between users and items in the experimental object, and the parameter item which is the number of items in the experimental object. In order to verify the usability of the DP recommendation results of the fve algorithms, the experimental evaluation index selected is the NDCG index.

Usability Metric Evaluation. Te two experimental datasets shown in Table 2 are used, and the evaluation metrics NDCG (z, p) for usability recommendations of diferent sizes are obtained by setting diferent item recommendation numbers z and privacy budgets \u03b5 during the experiments.Te parameters \u03b5\ufffd {0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0} and z\ufffd {10, 40, 70, 100}. Te parametric experiments are as follows:\n(1) Privacy budget \u03b5 infuence experiment: the recommended number of DP in this experiment is set to k\ufffd 40 in the dataset, the privacy budget \u03b5 is chosen to be changed during the experiment, and the efectiveness of the algorithm is verifed by using Jaccard metrics.

However, the algorithm in this paper uses the server gradient perturbation of user privacy, so the NDCG value that it obtains is larger and the recommended accuracy is higher.\n(2) Te parameter m changes afect the experiment. In this part of the experimental session, the privacy budget is set to a fxed value, i.e., \u03b5\ufffd 0.4. For diferent values of the number of DP recommendationsm, the Jaccard metric is selected to verify the efectiveness of the algorithm. Te usability recommendation results of diferent algorithms on the selected experimental set are shown in Figures 7 and 8.\nAccording to the experimental results in Figures 7 and 8, it can be seen that the NDCG indices of the centralized comparison algorithms all show a monotonically increasing trend when the number of DP recommendation items is gradually increased from 10 to 100.Te results show that the NDCG indices of the algorithms in this paper are kept above 90% on the selected experimental datasets, and the algorithms in literature [32] can be kept above 80%, the algorithm in literature [31] is kept above 70%, and the algorithms in literature [29, 30] are only maintained at less than 50%. Te main reason is that the algorithm in this paper has low noise among the project users for the experimental dataset.\n4.3. Algorithm Comparison Test. Te abovementioned four algorithms are selected as the comparison calculation method, and the comparison index object is shown in Table 2. Algorithm calculation time and privacy data recovery accuracy are selected as the comparison index to verify the data recommendation quality of the algorithm, and the experimental results are shown in Figure 9.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms more consistently, the average computational metrics of 10 experimental runs are selected here as the comparison results. As can be seen from Figure 9, in terms of the calculation time index, the DP recommendation time of this algorithm on the Last.fm test set is about 2.5 s, while the algorithms in literature [30] and literature [32] are 12.5 s, 10 s, 8 s, and 5.5 s, respectively. Te calculation time of this algorithm is improved by 80%, 75%, 68.8%, and 54.5%, respectively, compared with the other four algorithms. In the recommended accuracy index, the recommended accuracy of this algorithm is 99%, which is 4.5%, 6.2%, 11.4%, and 13.6% higher than that of the four algorithms in literature [29\u201331] and [32]. Tis indicates that the DP recommendation efciency and recommendation quality of this paper\u2019s algorithm on the Last.fm test set are better than those of the four selected comparison algorithms. Meanwhile, the data on the Flixster test set prove that this paper\u2019s algorithm also outperforms the other four comparison algorithms in the literature, showing similar performance.\n4.4. Efect of Diferent Privacy Budgets on Recommendation Results. Te purpose of this set of experiments is to examine the impact of this paper\u2019s algorithm on the recommendation results while achieving DP protection for users (see Figure - 10). Te root mean square error (RMSE) is used to measure the performance of the algorithm.Te privacy budget \u03b5 of this algorithm is 5. As can be seen in Figure 10, when \u03b5< 1, the accuracy of this algorithm is smaller than that of the underlying literature\u2019s [30] algorithm, which makes the algorithm unusable. Tis is because when \u03b5 is small, the algorithm\nadds a large amount of noise and thus afects the results of the model. When 1< \u03b5< 3, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is between that of literature [30] and literature [29]. When 3< \u03b5< 5, the accuracy of the algorithm in this paper is between literature [29] and literature [31]. When 5< \u03b5< 6, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is between literature [31] and literature [32]. When \u03b5> 6, the accuracy of this algorithm is higher than that of literature [32]. \u03b5 is still one of the difculties in DP research, and it is generally believed that the smaller \u03b5 is, the higher the degree of privacy protection is."

            "heading": "5. Conclusion",
            "text": "In this paper, a privacy-preserving recommendation algorithm based onMF and the genetic algorithm is proposed for the privacy problem in recommendation systems. Te algorithm transforms MF into two alternating user-hidden factor and item-hidden factor optimization problems, which efectively overcomes the problems of high dimensionality of the solution space and nonconvexity in optimization in the solution process. Moreover, an enhanced exponential mechanism is used in the selection operation of the genetic algorithm to make the whole MF process satisfy the DP protection. However, based on the idea of searching for signifcant hidden factors, the mutation operation of the genetic algorithm is redesigned to mutate the hidden factors from both positive and negative directions. Tis not only improves the efciency of the algorithm but also efectively enhances the performance of the understanding. Experimental results on two standard datasets show that the algorithm in this paper can better balance privacy and recommended accuracy. Especially under the condition of high privacy protection requirements, it can still achieve a good recommendation efect and has good application potential.\nTe proposedmodel exhibits two limitations that require further research. (1) Privacy budget selection: the model relies on the privacy budget parameter (\u03b5) to control the level of privacy protection for users. However, determining the appropriate privacy budget for individual users poses a signifcant challenge. Setting the same privacy budget for all users may not adequately cater to varying privacy concerns among users. Future research needs to address the issue of dynamically selecting privacy budget parameters based on users\u2019 privacy preferences and risk tolerance. (2) Individual user characteristics: the model assumes a uniform privacy protection level for all users, overlooking the fact that diferent users may have distinct privacy requirements. Future research should explore methods to capture individual user attributes, such as privacy preferences, risk tolerance, and past privacy-related behaviors. By integrating such information into the model, personalized privacy protection strategies can be devised, ensuring that users feel comfortable and confdent in sharing their data while receiving personalized recommendations."
