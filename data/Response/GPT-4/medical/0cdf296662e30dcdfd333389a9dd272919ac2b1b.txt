Elucidating the Role of Post-transcriptional Mechanisms in ATP Synthase and IF1 Regulation: Investigating the specific RNA-binding proteins (RNABPs) and microRNAs that influence the expression and activity of ATP synthase and IF1. This could uncover novel regulatory networks and potential therapeutic targets, particularly how these mechanisms contribute to cancer progression and metastasis.

Targeted Therapy Based on Tissue-specific Expression of IF1: Since IF1 acts as a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the tissue, developing targeted therapies that modulate IF1 activity or expression in a tissue-specific manner could offer personalized treatment strategies for different cancer types. This requires a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind IF1's dual roles.

Combination Therapies Targeting Mitochondrial Metabolism: Exploring combination therapies that target multiple aspects of mitochondrial metabolism, including ATP synthase, IF1, and fatty acid oxidation pathways, to overcome therapeutic resistance and prevent metastasis. This could involve the use of existing drugs like nebivolol or metformin in combination with novel inhibitors designed to specifically target mitochondrial metabolic pathways.

Investigating the Structural Role of ATP Synthase and IF1 in Mitochondrial Dynamics: Since ATP synthase and IF1 play a role in shaping the inner mitochondrial membrane and influencing cristae structure, researching how these proteins contribute to mitochondrial dynamics and integrity in cancer cells could provide insights into how mitochondrial morphology influences cancer progression and resistance to cell death.

Developing Biomarkers for Predicting Cancer Progression and Response to Therapy: Utilizing the expression levels of Î²-F1-ATPase, IF1, and other mitochondrial proteins as biomarkers for cancer prognosis and therapeutic response. This could lead to the development of diagnostic tools that help tailor treatments based on the metabolic profile of individual tumors, improving patient outcomes.
