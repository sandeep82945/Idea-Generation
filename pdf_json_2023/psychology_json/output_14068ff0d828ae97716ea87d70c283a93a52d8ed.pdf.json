    "abstractText": "V-ATPases are highly conserved multi-subunit enzymes that maintain the distinct pH of eukaryotic organelles. The integral membrane a-subunit is encoded by tissue and organelle specific isoforms, and its cytosolic N-terminal domain (aNT) modulates organelle specific regulation and targeting of V-ATPases. Organelle membranes have specific phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipid enrichment linked to maintenance of organelle pH. In yeast, the aNT domains of the two a-subunit isoforms bind PIP lipids enriched in the organelle membranes where they reside; these interactions affect activity and regulatory properties of the V-ATPases containing each isoform. Humans have four a-subunit isoforms. We hypothesize that the aNT domains of the human isoforms will also bind to specific PIP lipids. The a1 and a2 isoforms of human V-ATPase a-subunits are localized to endolysosomes and Golgi, respectively. Bacterially expressed Hua1NT and Hua2NT bind specifically to endolysosomal PIP lipids PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 and Golgi enriched PI(4)P, respectively. Despite the lack of canonical PIP binding sites, potential binding sites in the HuaNT domains were identified by sequence comparisons and existing subunit structures and models. Mutations at a similar location in the distal loops of both HuaNT isoforms compromise binding to their cognate PIP lipids, suggesting that these loops encode PIP specificity of the a-subunit isoforms. These data also suggest a mechanism through which PIP lipid binding could stabilize and activate V-ATPases in distinct organelles. 1 .

V-ATPases are highly conserved multi-subunit enzymes, functioning as ATP-driven proton pumps (Collins and Forgac 2020). They are comprised of 14 subunits organized in two operational subcomplexes, V1 and Vo (Oot, Couoh\u2010 Cardel et al. 2017). The catalytic V1 subcomplex is a peripheral membrane complex on the cytosolic face of the membrane and the Vo subcomplex is embedded in the membrane (Kane 2006). The V1 subcomplex executes ATP hydrolysis and the Vo subcomplex contains the proton pore (Graham, Powell et al. 2000, Oot, Couoh-Cardel et al. 2017, Seidel 2022) . V-ATPases are ubiquitously expressed and localized to multiple organelles, including the Golgi, endosomes, secretory vesicles, lysosomes and the lysosome-like yeast and plant vacuoles (Maxson and Grinstein 2014, Seidel 2022). Their principal function is organelle acidification and through this function they impact processes such as receptor mediated endocytosis, protein processing, trafficking and degradation, neurotransmitter loading, and modulation of signaling pathways such as Notch and mTOR (Maxson and Grinstein 2014, Pamarthy, Kulshrestha et al. 2018, Collins and Forgac 2020). In mammals, V-ATPases are also present in the plasma membrane of specific cells including kidney intercalated cells, epididymal clear cells, osteoclasts, macrophages and neutrophils. In these settings, they acidify the extracellular space and function in pH homeostasis, bone resorption, urine acidification and sperm maturation. (Breton and Brown 2013, Stransky, Cotter et al. 2016, Chu, Zirngibl et al. 2021)\nThe a-subunit of the Vo domain of V-ATPases is a 100 kDa subunit, which consists of amino terminal (aNT) and carboxy terminal (aCT) domains (Figure 1A) . The aNT is on the cytosolic face of the membrane and hydrophilic and the aCT is integral to the membrane and hydrophobic (Oot, Couoh\u2010Cardel et al. 2017, Roh, Stam et al. 2018). The aCT domain is involved in proton translocation (Kawasaki-Nishi, Bowers et al. 2001, Arata, Nishi et al. 2002, Qi and Forgac 2008). Cryo-EM studies establish that the aNT domain resembles a folded hairpin, comprised of globular proximal and distal ends connected by a coiled-coil linker, giving it a dumbbell shape (Roh, Stam et al. 2018). The aNT domain functions as a regulatory core for several reasons. It is positioned at the V1-Vo interface and is capable of interacting with the three peripheral stator stalks in the assembled enzyme. In intact, active V-ATPase, the aNT proximal and distal domains are pulled away from the central stalks because of their interactions with stator stalks (Oot and Wilkens 2012, Oot, Couoh-Cardel et al. 2017), while in autoinhibited Vo that is not bound to V1, the aNT domain collapses towards the central stalk (Roh, Stam et al. 2018). These conformational changes affect both the proximal and distal ends of aNT and may be involved in V-ATPase regulation by reversible disassembly (Stam and Wilkens 2017). In addition, aNT domains interact with cellular factors essential for V-ATPase regulation. These factors include RAVE, PIP lipids, and regulatory proteins like glycolytic enzymes (Banerjee and Kane 2020, Collins and Forgac 2020, Jaskolka, Winkley et al. 2021). Significantly, the information for compartment specific targeting, localization and signaling of V-ATPase to\nspecific cellular membranes also is encoded in the aNT domain (Kawasaki-Nishi, Bowers et al. 2001, Banerjee and Kane 2017).\nImportantly, the V-ATPase a-subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms that are critical for targeting of V-ATPases to specific compartments and administer their manifold organellespecific functions to V-ATPase (Nishi and Forgac 2000, Toyomura, Oka et al. 2000, Sun-Wada and Wada 2022). Yeast has two a-subunit isoforms, Vph1 and Stv1, which are localized at steady state to vacuoles and Golgi (Kane 2006, Toei, Saum et al. 2010). Higher organisms, including humans, have four isoforms designated a1-a4 (Forgac 2007). The a1, a2 and a3 isoforms are expressed ubiquitously but can also be enriched in certain organelles or cell types. The a1 isoform is present in lysosomes, but is also enriched in synaptic vesicles (Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein 2020). The a2 isoform is predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus but has also been found in endosomes (Hurtado-Lorenzo, Skinner et al. 2006). The a3 isoform is present in lysosomes, particularly secretory lysosomes, phagosomes, and the plasma membrane of osteoclasts (Ochotny, Van Vliet et al. 2006, Sun-Wada, Tabata et al. 2009). The a4 isoform is specific to renal intercalated cells and epididymal clear cells (Breton and Brown 2013). Genetic defects in V-ATPase activity due to loss of specific subunit isoforms are implicated in several diseases, including distal renal tubule acidosis (a4 mutations) (Breton and Brown 2013), cutis laxa type II (a2 mutations) (Kornak, Reynders et al. 2008), and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (a3 mutations) (Frattini, Orchard et al. 2000). Also, aberrant V-ATPase activity is implicated in cancer and viral infection (Kohio and Adamson 2013, Stransky, Cotter et al. 2016). This makes V-ATPase an attractive target for drug development.\nAnother important feature of eukaryotic organelle membranes is the enrichment of phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids. PIPs are transiently generated from phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids in outer leaflets of cellular membrane by lipid kinases and phosphatases (Strahl and Thorner 2007). Their levels are scarce, but they can modulate vesicular trafficking, ion channels, pumps and transporters and maintain organelle physiology (Balla 2013, Hille, Dickson et al. 2015, De Craene, Bertazzi et al. 2017). In eukaryotic cells, PIP lipids are enriched in specific intracellular membranes where they help to specify organelle identity (Shewan, Eastburn et al. 2011, Ho, Alghamdi et al. 2012, Hammond and Balla 2015, De Craene, Bertazzi et al. 2017). PI(3)P is enriched in early endosomes, but are also present in late endosomes and lysosomes (Clague, Urb\u00e9 et al. 2009, Shewan, Eastburn et al. 2011, Hammond and Balla 2015, Wallroth and Haucke 2018). PI(4)P is the chief PIP lipid in the Golgi apparatus but is found in plasma membranes as well (Shewan, Eastburn et al. 2011, Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein 2020). PI(3,5)P2 is predominantly localized in yeast vacuoles and mammalian late endosomes, lysosomes and multivesicular bodies (Strahl and Thorner 2007, Dove, Dong et al. 2009, Shewan, Eastburn et al. 2011, Ho, Alghamdi et al. 2012, McCartney, Zhang et al. 2014). PI(4,5)P2 is enriched in the plasma membrane (Hammond, Fischer et al. 2012).\nV-ATPase activity is regulated by PIP lipids in yeast. V-ATPases containing the Vph1 asubunit isoform are activated and stabilized by salt stress and high extracellular pH in a PI(3,5)P2-dependent manner (Li, Diakov et al. 2014). Addition of short chain PI(3,5)P2 to isolated vacuoles increases V-ATPase and proton pumping activity (Banerjee, Clapp et al. 2019).\nMutations in the distal domain of Vph1NT compromise this in vitro activation, and when present in intact Vph1, also impact the cellular response to osmotic stress (Banerjee, Clapp et al. 2019). Elevating PI(3,5)P2 levels by constitutive activation of Fab1 kinase or salt shock reversibly recruits Vph1NT to membranes in vivo in the absence of other subunits (Li, Diakov et al. 2014). Taken together, these data suggest that Vph1NT can interact with PI(3,5)P2. PI(4)P is also essential for Stv1 localization and activity. In vitro, Stv1NT binds PI(4)P and this association is impaired by a mutation in the proximal domain of Stv1NT (Banerjee and Kane 2017). When this mutation is introduced into full length Stv1, or Golgi PI(4)P levels are lowered, Stv1containing V-ATPases are mislocalized to the vacuole (Banerjee and Kane 2017). Addition of PI(4)P was shown to enhance activity of Stv1-containing V-ATPases (Vasanthakumar, Bueler et al. 2019). These data highlight the important of PIP interactions with V-ATPase a-subunit isoforms.\nIn this paper, we aim to determine whether PIP binding is conserved in mammalian asubunit isoforms, and to elucidate any PIP specificity of the human a1 and a2 isoforms. We have tested the specificity of Hua1NT and Hua2NT for intracellular PIP lipids in a liposome pelleting assay and found that Hua1NT binds preferentially to liposomes containing PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, lipids typically enriched in endosomes and lysosomes. In contrast, Hua2NT shows a preference for Golgi-enriched lipid PI(4)P. We have identified potential PIP specific binding sites for both Hua1NT and Hua2NT in their distal domains. The data demonstrate the association between specific V-ATPase subunit isoforms and the PIP lipids enriched in the organelles where they reside. Defining PIP binding codes on V-ATPase will improve our understanding of organelle specific pH control and could provide new avenues for controlling V-ATPase subpopulations."

            "text": "Hua1NT binds the endolysosomal PIP lipids PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 in vitro\nThe human a1 and a2 isoforms reside in endolysosomal compartments and Golgi, respectively, in most mammalian cells. Based on the results in yeast indicating that vacuolar Vph1NT binds to PI(3,5)P2 and Stv1NT binds to PI(4)P, we hypothesized that the human a1 and a2 subunits might also bind to the predominant intracellular PIP lipids in their organelles of residence, including PI(3)P, PI(3,5)P2 and PI(4)P. In addition, based on current structures and results with the yeast a-subunits, we hypothesized that the cytosolic N-terminal domains would be most likely to contain PIP lipid binding sites.\nTo investigate whether the N-terminal domain of human Vo a-subunit a1 (Hua1NT) and a2 (Hua2NT) isoforms exhibit specific binding to PIP lipids. We expressed the NT domain only of each isoform (Figure 1A) and tested their binding to liposomes in a quantitative liposome pelleting assay (Figure 1B) (Chandra, Chin et al. 2019). The Hua1NT domain (aa 1-356) was fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) at its N-terminus and a FLAG tag at its C-terminus to generate MBP-Hua1NT-FLAG. The tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by sequential affinity chromatography on amylose and anti-FLAG columns, followed by size exclusion chromatography. Purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A, left). The\nHua1NT construct eluted at the molecular mass of a monomer (M) from the gel filtration column (Figure 2A, right). This fraction was used to characterize the in vitro binding specificity of Hua1NT and different PIP lipids. In this assay, different concentrations of the expressed protein were mixed with liposomes containing 5 mol% of the indicated PIP lipid, then incubated at room temperature to allow interaction, followed by ultracentrifugation (described in Experimental Procedures). The same concentration of protein was centrifuged without any liposomes in order to determine whether there is any precipitation; this is the \u201cProtein only\u201d sample. As an additional control, we incubate the proteins with liposomes without PIP lipids, but with an equal amount of phosphatidyl serine (PS) replacing the PIPs. This sample serves as a control for liposome binding that is not PIP-specific. For all samples, supernatant and pellet fractions were obtained as described in Experimental Procedures and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.\nHua1NT interacted with both PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 as indicated by the presence of bands in pellet (P) fraction at all concentrations (Figure 2B). In contrast, Hua1NT pelleted much less with PI(4)P liposomes, suggesting weaker binding (Figure 2B). The relative amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions were determined by quantification of band intensity by ImageJ for each experiment and dividing the signal from the pellet over the total (supernatant + pellet) signal. The level of precipitation in the protein only sample was negligible. There was some variability in individual samples, but each experiment was repeated at least three times with freshly prepared protein and liposomes. The average proportion of total protein that bound to the PIP-containing and control liposomes over several experiments is plotted in Figure 2C. The control, PIP-independent binding (bottom of stacked bars for each protein concentration) is relatively low. In Figure 2D, PIP-independent binding is subtracted in order to compare the level of PIP-specific binding at each protein concentration. These data indicate that Hua1NT binds specifically PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 liposomes, but shows little binding to PI(4)P-containing liposomes. In addition, binding is nearly complete at the lowest concentration of protein measured (0.5 \u00b5M), indicating sub-micromolar affinity of the protein for these lipids. These data suggest that the Hua1 isoform, which resides in the endosomes and lysosomes of many cells, shows preferential binding to PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, the lipids enriched in these organelles.\nHua2NT binds the Golgi PIP lipid PI(4)P in vitro\nWe next tested the specificity of Hua2NT for the same three PIP lipids. MBP-Hua2NTFLAG (aa 1-364) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified similarly to Hua1NT. A Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of purified MBP-Hua2NT-FLAG after affinity purification and gel filtration and its elution profile are depicted in Figure 3A. The liposome pelleting assay was performed to test the interaction of Hua2NT with liposomes of distinct PIP content. We found that at different concentrations, Hua2NT interacted with PI(4)P most strongly, as indicated by the bands in pellet (P) fractions (Figure 3B). There is again negligible pelleting in the protein only sample. The pelleting of Hua2NT with PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 was less than that with PI(4)P (Figure 3B). The proportion of protein at different concentrations bound to the PIP lipids and control was determined as described above and is plotted in Figure 3C. The binding to control liposomes is relatively low (Figure 3C) and was subtracted in Figure 3D. The comparison indicates Hua2NT binds specifically and with relatively high affinity to PI(4)P (Figure 3D). These data suggest that the Hua2 isoform, which functions in Golgi, shows a preference for the Golgi-enriched PI(4)P.\nIdentification of candidate PIP lipid binding sites on human a1NT and a2NT\nOnce the binding specificities of Hua1NT and Hua2NT isoforms for different PIP lipids were established, we wanted to identify candidate PIP lipid binding sites in these isoforms. Identifying these binding sites will aid in understanding the functions of PIP lipids in vivo and recognizing PIP binding codes on V-ATPase subunit isoforms might aid in understanding regulation and targeting of V-ATPases. Many cytosolic or peripheral membrane proteins bind PIP lipids with an orthodox binding site like PX, PHD or FYVE (Strahl and Thorner 2007, Hammond and Balla 2015). None of these canonical binding sites are present in yeast or human V-ATPase a-subunit isoforms. However, some membrane can bind PIPs through noncanonical binding sites. To identify candidate PIP lipid binding sites, we used structure and homology modeling to identify aNT mutations for testing and then tested the mutant proteins for altered PIP lipid binding. The cryo-EM structure of human V-ATPase containing the a1 isoform from HEK293F cells (PDB 6WM2) has been reported (Wang, Wu et al. 2020). There is no structure for human V-ATPases containing the a2 isoform, so we used the molecular threading software PHYRE2 (Kelley, Mezulis et al. 2015) to model Hua2NT on the Hua1NT structure. An overlay of the a1NT structure and a2NT model is depicted in Figure 4A. The two subunit isoforms are moderately conserved (48.2% identity) (Supporting information 1). To identify candidate PIP lipid binding sites, we applied three major criteria. These include: (a) minimal homology between isoforms that show distinct PIP binding specificities, (b) presence of basic amino acid residues, capable of ionic interactions with negatively charged PIP head groups (possibly flanked by aromatic amino acids), and (c) predicted orientation of the binding sites toward the cytoplasmic leaflet of membrane, where the PIP lipids reside, in the assembled V-ATPase complex. In Hua1NT, Y214VH and G239FR were identified as candidate binding sequences (Figure 4B, left) that satisfied the criteria and in Hua2NT K221WY and G183KV were identified (Figure 4B, right). All of these residues are present in the distal domain in the loops in Hua1NT and Hua2NT. Although yeast Stv1NT has a binding site in a proximal loop, the corresponding proximal loops Hua1NT and Hua2NT are shorter and have no basic residues.\nHua1NT requires Y214VH sequence to bind PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2\nThe candidate binding sites identified in Hua1NT, Y214VH and G239FR, were mutated using the primers listed in Table 1, to yield MBP-Hua1NT(Y214VH-AVA)-FLAG and MBPHua1NT(G239FR-AAA)-FLAG fusion proteins. The purified mutant proteins had similar purification profiles to the wild-type Hua1NT (Figure 5A, left), and the monomer fractions (M) from gel filtration (Figure 5A, right) were again used for liposome pelleting assay. Since wildtype Hua1NT showed binding specificity to liposomes containing PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, we tested the mutant proteins for binding to liposomes containing these PIP lipids. The immunoblots show that Hua1NT with Y214VH \u2013 AVA mutation has reduced binding to liposomes containing PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 as depicted by the more intense bands in supernatant (S) (Figure 5B, left) and the lower proportion of bound protein (Figure 5B, right). However, Hua1NT with G239FR \u2013 AAA mutation still binds to the liposomes containing PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 as indicated by bands in the pellets (P) (Figure 5C, right) and the relatively high proportion of protein bound to liposomes containing both lipids (Figure 5C-left). The PIP specific binding to both PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 of the wild-type and mutant versions of Hua1NT are compared in Figure 5D. The graph shows that Hua1NT with mutation at Y214VH site has almost no detectable binding for PI(3)P or PI(3,5)P2 and Hua1NT with mutation at G239FR site has slightly reduced binding to both lipids at low concentrations, suggesting a somewhat lower affinity, but binds similarly to\nwild-type at higher concentrations (Figure 5D). These data indicate that Hua1NT requires the Y214VH sequence to bind PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 in vitro.\nHua2NT requires K221WY sequence to bind PI(4)P\nInterestingly, yeast Stv1, which resides in the Golgi, contains a high affinity binding site for PI(4)P in a W83KY sequence at its proximal end; mutation of only the lysine in this sequence abolished PI(4)P binding (Banerjee and Kane 2017). Given the similarity to the K221WY sequence in the distal end of Hua2NT, we mutated the lysine of the K221WY sequence to alanine to yield MBP-Hua2NT(K221A)-FLAG using the primers listed in Table1. In addition, the G183KV sequence, was mutated to generate an MBP-Hua2NT(G183KV-AAV)-FLAG fusion protein. The mutated proteins had similar purification profiles to wild-type Hua2NT (Figure 6A). The monomer fractions (M) were used in liposome pelleting assays. Since wild-type Hua2NT showed binding specificity for PI(4)P, we tested the binding of the mutants to PI(4)P-containing liposomes. The immunoblots show that Hua2NT with K221A mutation binds poorly to PI(4)Pcontaining liposomes, and the low proportion of MBP-Hua2NT(K221A)-FLAG in pellets (P) over several experiments (Figure 6B). Comparison of the PIP specific binding of Hua2NT mutant (K221A) with binding of the wild-type Hua2NT to PI(4)P-containing liposomes (Figure 6C) indicates significantly reduced binding of the mutant protein. For MBP-Hua2NT(G183KVAAV)-FLAG, the immunoblot and graph depicting proportion of protein bound (Figure 6D) show that, curiously, Hua2NT with mutation at G183KV sequence binds to PI(4)P lipids at low protein concentrations (0.5 \u00b5M), but seems to have reduced binding to PI(4)P at higher concentration of protein. This behavior is very different than that of Hua2NT with the K221A mutation or the wild-type and mutant forms of Stv1NT and Hua1NT and will require further analysis to understand. However, it is clear that mutation of Hua2NT K221 to A greatly decreases binding to PI(4)P.\nDifferent PIP binding specificities are encoded at a similar location in aNT isoform structures\nThese data highlight the importance of the Y214VH sequence in Hua1NT and K221WY in the Hua2NT sequence for binding to their respective PIP lipids. The sequence alignment in Figure 7A indicates that these two sequences are at very similar positions in the aligned sequences. A comparison of the three-dimensional structures indicates that both of the sequences lie in a poorly conserved loop at the distal end of the aNT isoforms. Remarkably, the sequence implicated in binding of yeast Vph1NT to PI(3,5)P2 is in a very similar position as shown in Figure 7B. This distal domain loop is poorly resolved in most V-ATPase cryo-EM structures, suggesting that it may be mobile, but is resolved one of the yeast (Khan, Lee et al. 2022) and some of the human V-ATPase structures (Wang, Wu et al. 2020, Wang, Long et al. 2020). Overall structure of V-ATPases is highly conserved between organisms and between complexes containing different a-subunit isoforms. These data suggest that there is a variable loop in the distal domain of multiple aNT isoforms that has the capacity for binding to PIP lipids. Intriguingly, different sequences at this location appear to support distinct PIP specificity."

            "text": "PIP binding is a conserved feature of V-ATPase aNT domains\nThese data suggest that the capacity for PIP-specific binding is present in a-subunit isoforms from mammals as well as yeast, despite the lack of previously characterized PIP binding domains in any of the a-subunit isoforms. However, there are both similarities and differences in the binding of yeast and human isoforms to PIP lipids.\nHuman a2NT and yeast Stv1 are both primarily in Golgi-localized V-ATPases. Both bind tightly and specifically to liposomes containing PI(4)P, the PIP lipid enriched in the Golgi apparatus. The mutations that compromised PI(4)P binding, K84A in the W83KY of yeast Stv1NT and mutation of K221A in a K221WY sequence in human a2NT, appear to occur in a similar sequence context but are present at opposite ends of the aNT domain. Stv1 is longer than most asubunit isoforms across species, and much of this additional length is in insertions in the NT domain, including a longer and more basic membrane-adjacent loop at the proximal end that contains the W83KY sequence. In the a2NT model, there are no basic amino acids in the shorter proximal loop. However, it is also notable that although mutation of Stv1 K84 abolishes binding to PI(4)P liposomes in vitro and transfers PI(4)P binding to Vph1NT when added at a similar position, experiments with chimeras between regions of Stv1NT and Vph1NT suggest that the distal end of Stv1NT may also help support high affinity binding to PI(4)P (Tuli and Kane 2023). The sequences involved are not known, and it is notable that Stv1 has a glutamate, which could disrupt PIP binding, in the region aligned with the K221WY sequence of a2NT. However, a recent study identified another distal end sequence conserved across yeast and human a-subunit isoforms that supports binding to several different PIP lipids, but has limited specificity in vitro (Chu, Yao et al. 2023). This sequence could help to strengthen PI(4)P binding in both Stv1NT and a2NT. In yeast, PI(4)P binding is linked to both activation of V-ATPase activity in vitro and retention or retrieval of Stv1-V-ATPases to the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Introduction of the K221A mutation into full-length human a2 will be necessary to determine whether the functional effects of PI4P binding are similar.\nComparisons of the human a1NT and yeast Vph1NT, both of which reside in endolysosomal compartments, reveals sequence conservation between the regions that compromise PI(3,5)P2 binding in vitro when mutated (Figure 7). In yeast, mutations in either of two adjacent sequences K231TREY- and K236HK-AAA block PI(3,5)P2 activation of V-ATPases in isolated vacuoles and cause defects in PI(3,5)P2-dependent osmotic stress responses (Banerjee, Clapp et al. 2019). Interestingly, the human Y214VH sequence implicated in binding of Hua1NT to PI(3,5)P2 aligns with a Y235KH sequence in the middle of the two sequences implicated in yeast Vph1NT binding to PI(3,5)P2 and both are followed by an additional lysine that was not mutated in this study, but could potentially contribute to binding (Figure 7). However, there are important differences as well. Although human a1NT binds tightly and specifically to liposomes containing either PI(3)P or PI(3,5)P2, Vph1NT binds poorly to liposomes in vitro (Tuli and Kane 2023), suggesting a lower affinity for PIP lipids than Hua1NT. In addition, V-ATPase activity in yeast could be activated by PI(3,5)P2 but not by PI(3)P, suggesting the two lipids have distinct effects on activity, and potential differences in binding (Banerjee, Clapp et al. 2019). Although\nsimilar activity assays are not yet available for the human a1 isoform, it is difficult to justify differences in specificity and affinity purely from the sequences in this region, as Vph1NT has additional basic amino acids including a lysine in the middle of the homologous sequence that could potentially contribute to binding to either or both of these PIP lipids (Figure 7). In addition, the basic lysine and arginine of the KTREY sequence are not present in a1NT. Functionally, the V-ATPase in the yeast vacuole appears to be closely integrated with the osmotic stress response, which is characterized by dramatic changes in PI(3,5)P2 levels in yeast (Duex, Nau et al. 2006, Li, Diakov et al. 2014). In this context, the rather weak affinity of Vph1NT for PI(3,5)P2 may be important for a robust regulatory response to the rapid rise of PI(3,5)P2 with osmotic stress. Although PI(3,5)P2 is also extremely important in the endolysosomal system of higher eukaryotes, the changes in lipid levels with environmental stress are less dramatic (Jin, Jin et al. 2017), so higher affinity binding could be appropriate to maintain both a basal level of interaction between V-ATPases and the PIP lipids support the response to stress. Notably both Vph1NT and Hua1NT are likely to transit through the Golgi en route to endosomes and lysosomes, but neither binds significantly to PI(4)P. This is potentially consistent with PIP binding occurring when they reach their compartments of residence, possibly accompanied by activation or other functional effeccts. Further experiments are necessary to establish how PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3)P affect function of V-ATPases containing the a1 isoform in cells.\nHow could PIP binding sites in the distal domain of aNTs affect V-ATPase structure and activity?\nAs described above, it is remarkable that the human a1NT and a2NT show distinct PIPspecific binding that can be disrupted by mutations in sequences mapping to such as similar structural location (Figure 7A). We have found that binding to PI(3,5)P2 activates V-ATPases containing the Vph1 isoform, and also stabilizes them against disassembly of the V1 subcomplex from Vo (Li, Diakov et al. 2014). The evidence that Vph1NT is regulated by sequences at this same location suggests that PIP binding to the mammalian a-subunit isoform to this region could also be functionally important. Structures are available for both intact yeast V-ATPases and isolated Vo subcomplexes containing Vph1, and we compared the position of the loop containing the potential PI(3,5)P2 binding sequence in both (Figure 8). Both the proximal and distal domains of Vph1NT collapse toward the center of the Vo subcomplex in the absence of V1 (Stam and Wilkens 2017, Roh, Stam et al. 2018). In this conformation, the loop implicated in PI(3,5)P2 binding is above the c-ring and does not appear to be readily accessible to membrane lipids. In contrast, Vph1NT is in a more extended conformation in the assembled Vph1-containing VATPases where it now would have access to membrane lipids (Zhao, Benlekbir et al. 2015, Khan, Lee et al. 2022). In this extended conformation, Vph1NT interacts with V1 subunits in two of the three peripheral stalks, as required for stable V-ATPase assembly. The distal end of Vph1NT, specifically, interacts with one EG stalk and the foot end of the C subunit (Oot and Wilkens 2012, Oot, Couoh-Cardel et al. 2017). A similar extended conformation of Hua1NT is seen in structures of the intact V-ATPases containing this subunit (Abbas, Wu et al. 2020, Wang, Wu et al. 2020, Wang, Long et al. 2020). We hypothesize that PIP binding to the extended conformation of aNT helps to stabilize the assembled conformation. Reversible disassembly of\nV1 from Vo, possibly initiated by departure of V1 subunit C, is a characteristic feature of VATPases from multiple species (Oot, Couoh-Cardel et al. 2017). It is possible that the V-ATPase is poised for disassembly even in its assembled state, and stabilizing factors, such as PIP binding are able to favor or stabilize the assembled conformation.\nThere is still much to learn about the interaction between PIP lipids and V-ATPases, although this work indicates that the capacity for these interactions is conserved and focuses attention on the distal end of aNT isoforms as sites of PIP binding and regulation. The PIP binding mutations in Hua1NT and Hua2NT identified here can be introduced into the intact asubunit isoforms to assess the functional importance of PIP binding. Mutation of the endogenous isoform genes may be necessary, given the presence of multiple a-subunit isoforms and the potential for overexpression to perturb isoform distribution or introduce functional compensation. In addition, although cryo-EM structures of V-ATPases have identified lipids within the Vo subcomplex, there is as yet no structure that shows direct interaction of the aNT distal end with lipid headgroups. Achieving such a structure may require restoration of PIP lipids after solubilization of V-ATPases, with the goal of preserving PIP interactions through reconstitution."

            "text": "Cloning, expression, and purification of HuaNT isoforms from E. coli\nMBP-Hua1NT(1-356)-FLAG fusion protein was generated by Anne Smardon (SUNY Upstate Medical University). PCR fragments containing the first 356 amino acids from human cDNA ATP6Voa1 were cloned into pGEM and excised with EcoRI and SalI, then cloned into pMAL:PPase cut with the same enzymes. Construction of MBP-Hua2NT-FLAG domain was described (Banerjee and Kane 2017). The mutant constructs, MBP-Hua1(Y214VH-AVA)NTFLAG, MBP-Hua1(G239FR-AAA)NT-FLAG, MBP-Hua2(K221WY -AWY)NT-FLAG and MBPHua2(G183KV-AAV)NT-FLAG were constructed by introducing point mutations using In-Fusion HD Cloning (Takara Bio USA, Inc) with the primers listed in Table 1. The constructs were transformed into Rosetta [genotype: F\u2212 ompT hsdSB(rB\u2212 mB\u2212) gal dcm (DE3) pRARE (CamR)] (Novogen) competent E. coli cells and grown to a density of A600 of 0.6 in 2.5% Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Fisher Bioreagents) with 125 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol(Sigma-Aldrich). Expression of protein was then induced by addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside followed by incubation at 19\u1d52C for 16 hours. The cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm at 4\u1d52C for 20 minutes and resuspended in 25 ml amylose column buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2M NaCl and 1mM EDTA). 2 mM MgCl2, 1mg/ml lysozyme, 2\u03bcg/ml DNase, 5 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM of Phenyl Methane Sulfonyl Fluoride (PMSF) were added, and the mixture was sonicated on ice for cell lysis, followed by slow rocking at 4\u1d52C for 30 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4\u1d52C for 20 mins. The supernatant was diluted 1:4 with the same buffer and purified through 5 ml Amylose and 1 ml FLAG affinity purification columns sequentially. Amylose resin was purchased from New England BioLabs\nand anti-FLAG M2 resin from Sigma. Purification in the amylose column involved running the lysate twice through the column followed by a wash with 10 column volumes of the same buffer. Proteins were eluted from amylose column with 10mM maltose monohydrate. 1 ml fractions were collected and 5 mM DTT was added. Peak fractions with protein concentrations giving an A280> 0.5 were pooled and dialyzed in dialysis tubing with MWCO 3.5kD (Spectrum Labs) in FLAG buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 150mM NaCl) overnight at 4\u1d52C. The dialyzed mixture was added to an anti-FLAG M2 column (Sigma), for the second round of purification. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of FLAG buffer and proteins were eluted as 1 ml fractions with 100 \u03bcg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). 5 mM DTT was added to each fraction and peak fractions as determined from Coomassie blue gel electrophoresis were pooled and concentrated in Vivaspin 15-max speed filter (MWCO 30kD) (Sartorius Stedim Lab Ltd.) to a final concentration of at least 1mg/ml. The concentrated protein was run on a Superdex Increase 200 (Cytivia) gel-filtration FPLC column on Biologic DuoFlow System (Biorad). The fraction corresponding to the peak corresponding to the molecular mass of the monomer protein (~80kDa) was collected and was used for liposome pelleting assay.\nLiposome preparation and liposome pelleting assay\nLipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids as lyophilized powder and dissolved in CHCl3: CH3OH: H2O in 20:9:1 ratio. Liposomes with 50 mol % 16:0 phosphatidylcholine (PC), 25 mol % 16:0 phosphatidylserine (PS), 18 mol %16:0 phosphatidylthanolamine (PE), 2 mol % 16:0 NBD-PE (for visualizing liposomes) and 5 mol % 18:1 phosphatidylinositol phospholipids PI(3)P, PI(4)P or PI(3,5)P2, were prepared by in Liposome making buffer (50mM Tris, 25mM NaCl, pH 7.4) by extrusion as described by Banerjee and Kane, 2017 (Banerjee and Kane 2017). Control liposomes, without PIP lipids were prepared with an extra 5 mol% 16:0 PS.\nLiposome pelleting assays were performed by incubating the prepared liposomes with the expressed protein of interest at room temperature for 30 minutes to allow protein-lipid interaction. The salt concentration was adjusted to 60 mM with NaCl. The final volume of the mixture was 100 \u00b5l and samples contained protein concentrations of 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 1.5 \u00b5M with a final lipid concentration of 0.33 mM. Following incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 95,000 rpm at 4\u1d52C for 30 mins in a TLA-100 fixed angle rotor using Beckman Coulter mini ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5l buffer with 50mM Tris-HCl and 60mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Both supernatant and pellet samples were precipitated with 10% trichloro acetic acid (TCA), and the resulting pellets were washed with cold acetone and resuspended in 30 \u00b5l cracking buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8M urea, 5% SDS and 1mM EDTA). Equal volumes of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred into nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antiFLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody (Promega). Band intensities were quantified by Image J. To calculate proportion of total protein that bound to the liposomes with PIP or without PIP (control), the band intensities of the pellet fractions were divided by the total band intensity of the supernatant and pellet. The PIP specific binding was calculated by subtracting the band intensity of PIP independent binding (control)\nfrom band intensity of PIP specific binding. Freshly prepared liposomes and purified proteins were used in the experiments."
