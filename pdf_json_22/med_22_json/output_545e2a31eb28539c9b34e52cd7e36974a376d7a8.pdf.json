    "abstractText": "Selenium (Se), abundantly obtained in fish, is a crucial trace element for human health. Since there are no data on Se bioaccessibility from commonly consumed fish in Thailand, this study assessed the in vitro bioaccessibility of Se using the equilibrium dialyzability method. The five fish species most commonly consumed in Thailand were selected to determine total Se content using several preparation methods (fresh, boiling, and frying). Equilibrium dialyzability was used to perform in vitro bioaccessibility using enzymatic treatment to simulate gastrointestinal digestion for all boiled and fried fish as well as measuring Se using inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QQQ-MS). Two-way ANOVA with interaction followed by Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test revealed that boiled Indo-Pacific Spanish mackerel, longtail tuna, and short-bodied mackerel were significantly higher in Se content than striped snakehead and giant sea perch (p < 0.05). For fried fish, longtail tuna showed the highest Se content (262.4 \u03bcg/100 g of product) and was significantly different compared to the other fish (p < 0.05, estimated marginal means was 43.8\u2013115.6 \u03bcg/100 g of product). Se bioaccessibilities from striped snakehead (70.0%) and Indo-Pacific Spanish mackerel (64.6%) were significantly higher than for longtail tuna (p < 0.05). No significant difference in bioaccessibility was found in terms of preparation method (i.e., boiling and frying). In conclusion, the fish included in this study, either boiled or fried, have high Se content and are good sources of Se due to high bioaccessibility.",

            "text": "Selenium (Se) is a crucial nutrient for human health. Adequate Se intake supports physiological functions and lowers the risk of complications by downregulating T cell differentiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1,2]. The cut-off criteria for Se deficiency is serum Se below 63 \u00b5g/L [3]. Thailand\u2019s Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) guideline recommends Se intake of 55 \u00b5g daily for adults [4]. Unfortunately, many countries still report Se deficiency. For instance, Spanish children (13.9%) were reported as having a low level of serum Se (<60 \u00b5g/L) [5], adults in Saudi Arabia (41%) had low Se concentration (<0.56 \u00b5g/L) in toenails [6], and children living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Thailand (56%) were reported as having low serum Se [7]. Long-term inadequate Se intake is related to impaired immunological functions and the risk of carcinogenesis [8]. Hence, consuming foods that are high in Se should be promoted to prevent Se insufficiency among populations. Widely consumed around the world, fish are well-known as good sources of Se, and previous studies have reported high Se contents in several species of fish. Most notably, in Canada, Se concentrations in Wahoo and flying fish were 1.4 and 0.8 mg/kg,\nFoods 2022, 11, 3312. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11213312 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2022, 11, 3312 2 of 12\nrespectively [9]. A Japanese study found 0.75, 0.77, and 1.27 mg/kg of Se in Kuromaguro, Musu, and Kinmedai fish, respectively [10]. Furthermore, Se concentrations in Atlantic herring, Atlantic halibut, and Atlantic cod were 0.38\u20130.61, 0.47\u20130.48, and 0.25\u20130.31 mg/kg, respectively, according to a European study [11]. Thailand is a large fish-producing nation due to extensive offshore fishing and fish farming. Due to inexpensive prices, fish are easily accessible and affordable sources of protein for the Thai people and are included in a variety of Thai traditional menus. A previous study reported high Se content in fish that are commonly consumed in Thailand, such as longtail tuna, short-bodied mackerel, Indo-Pacific Spanish mackerel, and giant sea perch at 208.4, 80.7, 89.7, and 47.9 \u00b5g/100 g edible part, respectively [12]. Bioaccessibility is defined as the content of nutrients released from a food matrix after ingestion in the human gastrointestinal system that are then available for further absorption through the gut barrier. Hence, foods with high bioaccessibility of specific nutrients can have potentially high bioavailability and thus can enter the circulatory system and reach target physiological functions [13]. Consequently, an enhanced understanding of the bioaccessibility of nutrients in foods can help people in general, and especially those groups at risk of Se deficiency, to improve their food intake and optimize the efficiency of nutrients for their bodily functions. The bioaccessibility of nutrients can be determined by the in vitro method that mimics the human digestive system to provide information on the interaction of nutrients, the food matrix, methods of food processing and preservation, luminal factors including enzymes and pH, food components, etc. Moreover, this method is useful for evaluating potential micronutrient absorbability [14]. The in vitro method has been used to determine nutrient bioaccessibility in previous studies, such as levels of calcium in vegetables low in phytate, dietary fiber, and oxalate including kale, collard, and soybean sprouts (20\u201339%) [15]. Another study investigated the in vitro bioaccessibility of iron in colored and white beans, i.e., 1.5\u20132.7% and 12.1\u201318.8%, respectively [16]. For Se in fish, a previous European study reported high in vitro bioaccessibility in tuna, swordfish, and sardines at 50, 76, and 83%, respectively [17]. While a previous study established the Se content in fish commonly consumed in Thailand, to our knowledge no data exist on the bioaccessibility of Se from those fish [12]. Consequently, this study investigates the bioaccessibility of Se based on the in vitro method using the equilibrium dialysis technique from fish widely consumed among the Thai people and using inductively coupled plasma triple quadruple mass spectrometry (ICP-QQQ-MS), the preferred analytical technique due to its lower detection limit values and minimization of interferences."

Table 1 presents the common names of the fish sampled in this study, as well scientific names and other information. All fish samples were stored in cooling bags to retain freshness after purchase and until being sent to the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University, to be prepared as boiled and fried fish and then homogenized (with skin), after which the moisture content was evaluated according to procedures described elsewhere [20,21]. Briefly, the weights of all fish before and after eliminating inedible parts were recorded. The fish cooked by boiling were boiled in deionized water, while the fish prepared by frying were fried in palm oil. Portions of all samples were dried using a freeze-dried system (freeze dryer model FD-5, Genvac, Bangkok, Thailand) and ground using a grinder (Philips, 600 W, Indonesia) into fine particles.

Collision and reaction gas modes were used to decrease interferences during ICP-QQQ-MS analyses and to improve selenium sensitivity and accuracy. An external calibration curve was created by a series of working standard solutions of Se in 2% v/v HNO3. An internal standard (Rh) was also prepared with 2% v/v HNO3, which was pipetted into digested sample solutions at the same concentration to monitor any change in instrument condition during analysis. The procedures for microwave digestion and final solution preparation of the fish samples were adapted from a previous study [22]. Briefly, all freeze-dried fish samples (0.5 g) and CRMs (0.25 g) were weighed and added to glass vials followed by 5 mL of concentrate HNO3 (65% v/v). The mixed samples then underwent microwave-assisted digestion in triplicate using Anton Paar Multiwave 7000 (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) with conditions shown in Table 2. Thereafter, each digested sample was made to volume with DI water in another volumetric vial (40 mL). These volume aliquots were then pipetted into other volumetric vials to which an internal standard (Rh) at the same concentration (final volume was 10 mL) was added before being injected into the ICP-QQQ-MS.

Consequently, the gastrointestinal simulation procedure was performed only on boiled or fried fish using the equilibrium dialysis system according to a previous study [23]. In brief, 0.5 g of each cooked fish sample was weighed in triplicate and placed in an Erlenmeyer flask, followed by 95 mL of deionized water, and the pH of 2.0 adjusted with HCl. Deionized water was used to adjust the final volume to 100 mL. Thereafter, each flask received 3 mL of fresh pepsin solution made by dissolving 16 g of pepsin in 100 mL of 0.1 M HCl. Flasks were incubated in a shaking water bath (Memmert GmbH, Germany) (37 \u25e6C for 2 h). Titratable acidity was determined as the volume of KOH needed to titrate a pepsin digest and pancreatin bile extract mixture to pH 7.5. The digesta\u2019s titratable acidity was measured by pipetting each aliquot sample of 20 mL into another flask, followed by 5 mL of fresh pancreatin-bile extract solution (dissolving 0.4 g of pancreatin and 2.5 g of bile extract in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaHCO3). The solution was then titrated with 0.5 N KOH to pH 7.5, and the quantities of KOH needed to achieve each sample\u2019s target pH were recorded. Once incubation was completed, the incubated samples were pipetted at 20 mL to other 50 mL volumetric vials in triplicate. For this study, dialysis bags were prepared by rinsing several times and soaking in deionized water for 10 min, boiled with 40% ethanol for 10 min, rinsed with deionized water mixed with 0.01 M EDTA-Ca2 and 2% NaHCO3, rinsed again with deionized water, then soaked in 0.001 M NaHCO3 and stored at 4 \u25e6C until use. For the analysis, the dialysis bags contained identical volumes of 0.5 N NaHCO3 equivalent to 0.5 N KOH used to analyze for titratable acidity in each fish sample. A final volume of 7 mL was made with deionized water and placed inside 50 mL volumetric vials that contained an aliquot (20 mL) of pepsin digesta. The vials were then incubated for 30 min in a shaking water bath at 37 \u25e6C. Thereafter, a prepared pancreatin bile extract mixture of 5 mL was added into the incubating vials, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Reagent blanks were also conducted to control for checking and corrected contamination. In the end, the dialysates and residue digesta of the fish samples were weighed and assessed for Se content using ICP-QQQ-MS. Briefly, the dialysates and digesta were dried to 1 mL and then digested using microwave digestion as per the described procedure and conditions shown in Table 2. Thereafter, the digested dialysates and digesta were dried again until reaching 1 mL and made to a volume of 5 mL with deionized water, and then filtered using a 0.22 \u00b5m nylon filter with a syringe (Merck Millipore) before analysis. Dialyz-\nFoods 2022, 11, 3312 5 of 12\nability was presented as the percentage of Se content in the dialyzate to the total amount of Se obtained in the sample as follows: dialyzability (%) = 100 \u00d7 dialyzed Se content (\u00b5g/g sample) divided by the total Se content (\u00b5g/g sample). Digested residue digesta were also assessed for Se content using ICP-QQQ-MS to achieve the mass balance analysis."

            "text": "The EP range is dependent on the actual preparation method used for the fish. In Thai household practice, the internal organs and scales of fish are removed before cooking, which may explain why the EP of the selected fish in this study was different from results previously presented for Bangladesh (62\u201385%) [26]. Moreover, the yield factor is influenced by several fish tissue components, which may result in weight changes after cooking [27]. In addition, different fat contents obtained in foods could be associated with yield factor [28]. The lowest moisture content, according to this analysis, was found in fried giant sea perch (54 g/100 g) while the highest was in short-bodied mackerel (76 g/100 g). This finding is in\nFoods 2022, 11, 3312 9 of 12\nline with the loss of moisture that occurs more often in fried fish compared to boiled fish due to heat processing at high temperatures, which impacts heavily on the loss of moisture in foods, especially for fish [29\u201332]. The results for total Se concentration support the findings of a previous study that indicated frying and heat processing at high temperatures had no effects on the degradation of Se in Se-biofortified grains when compared to traditional Chinese cooking methods [33]. The general findings of this present study are comparable to those for other areas, such as fish in Japan, where Se concentrations ranged from 12 to 127 \u00b5g/100 g [10], and in European fish, where they ranged from 22 to 61 \u00b5g/100 g [11]. In addition, the findings reveal that Se is different from other nutrients obtained in fish that are commonly consumed in Thailand, such as vitamin D content, which is not affected by the cooking method [21]. Alternatively, the diverse Se forms found in fish may possibly be the primary difference influencing Se loss after cooking. According to prior research, the primary forms of Se obtained in most fish are selenocysteine and selenomethionine [34]. Selenomethionine is the most common chemical type of Se seen in tuna blood [35]. These Se forms have a low molecular weight and dissolve quickly in water upon boiling [36], which could explain why boiling causes more Se loss than frying."

            "text": "This present study\u2019s results on the high bioaccessibility of Se among fish species commonly consumed in Thailand are comparable to those of European fish, such as sardine (83%), swordfish (76%), and tuna (50%) [17]. These findings indicate that the selected fish species used in this study have potentially high efficiency in terms of Se absorption and Se bioavailability in the human body, since the Se obtained from these fish are highly released from matrix tissue by human gastrointestinal simulation [41]. Consequently, nutritionists should recommend these fish for healthy people, in general, and especially for groups at risk of Se deficiency. In addition, a previous study reported that macro-elements obtained from fish tissues play an important role in the bioaccessibility of Se. Se bioaccessibility is positively related to carbohydrate content and dietary fiber [42]. In this study, the fish contained a low amount of carbohydrate (0\u20131 g/100 g, data not presented) and no dietary fiber. Protein content exhibits a negative correlation with Se bioaccessibility but no correlation between the bioaccessibility fraction of Se and the fat content [42]. In this study, all of the fish had protein contents of 22.6\u201326.7 g/100 g for boiling and 29.6\u201324.9 g/100 g for frying (detailed data not presented). They also provided fat contents of 2.1\u20135.6 g/100 g for boiling and 6.9\u201313.8 g/100 g for frying. A negative correlation was found between Se bioaccessibility and protein (r = \u22120.65) and fat (r = \u22120.41). In addition, a previous study reported that selenomethionine is the main chemical form of Se in fish, and it is the major form of Se in fish dialysate [43]. However, there is no information on selenium form in this study as yet. Potentially toxic element contamination in fish tissues and other seafood products is common [44], especially mercury (Hg), which is most commonly in the form of methylmercury (MeHg). Se is recognized as decreasing the toxicity of MeHg. The present data established that the Se:Hg molar ratio in the fish was 0.23:1 [45]. In addition, a previous study revealed that a high ratio of Se/Hg in fish was related to low bioaccessibility of MeHg\nFoods 2022, 11, 3312 10 of 12\naccording to the in vitro method [46]. Other potentially toxic elements reported as usually contaminating fish and other seafood products are cadmium, arsenic, and lead, which are harmful to humans [47]. Long-term consumption of foods that are contaminated with these elements can increase the risk of cancer development [48]. Consequently, determination of potentially toxic element contents and their bioaccessibility in fish commonly consumed in Thailand is an area for future study to ensure that the fish are safe to consume with below the maximum levels of potentially toxic element concentrations (i.e., Pb < 0.3 mg/kg, Hg < 1.2\u20131.6 mg/kg, etc.) based on the criteria established by the FAO [49]. Finally, Se can come in a variety of chemical forms. Organic forms, most commonly found as selenomethionine and selenocysteine, are prevalent in fish and other animal products [50,51]. Inorganic forms, mainly selenite and selenate, have been reported to be poisonous and ineffective in the human body [52,53]. Since in our study a Se speciation analysis in fish dialysate was not undertaken, a future study focusing on this analysis is needed to determine which major Se form was obtained in the dialysate, and to determine its potential to be absorbed from these selected fish samples."

Although there is some loss of selenium after cooking, nonetheless, the cooked fish provided high levels of Se. This study is the first to report selenium bioaccessibility in Thailand due to the difficulty of selenium analysis. Se bioaccessibility for all of the studied fish is about one-half to two-thirds of the original Se content. However, these fish also showed a high Se content after cooking as well as with in vitro bioaccessibility. Consequently, an in vivo human study of Se bioavailability should be further conducted. In conclusion, all five studied fish (striped snakehead, giant sea perch, Indo-Pacific Spanish mackerel, longtail tuna, and short-bodied mackerel) are highly recommended for consumption, especially among those persons who might be Se deficient.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization by K.J., P.S. and A.S.; methodology by A.S., K.J., P.S. and C.C.; laboratory analysis by A.S., N.L., N.O. and C.Y.; statistical analysis by A.S. and K.J.; writing, review, and editing by A.S. and K.J.; project administration by P.S. and K.J.; funding acquisition by K.J.
