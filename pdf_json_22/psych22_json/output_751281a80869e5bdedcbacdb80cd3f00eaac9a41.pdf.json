We aimed to investigate the prevalence of\nanxiety and depression and risk factors among patients with cardiovascular disease in\nthe post-pandemic period.\nMethod: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through opportunistic and snowball\nsampling in southeast China from 10 October to 24 November. Anxiety and depression\nwere assessed on the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS).\nResults: A total of 435 patients with hypertension (48.05%), atrial fibrillation (17.24%),\ncoronary artery disease (14.48%), heart failure (9.89%) and other heart diseases (10.34%)\ncompleted the survey. Interestingly, most patients reported monthly income comparable\nto (90.11%) or even greater than (8.51%) pre-pandemic income. The occurrence of\nanxiety and depression was 11.72 and 9.20%, respectively. Marital status and treatment\ninterruption during the pandemic were independent risk factors for both anxiety and\ndepression. Moreover, current monthly income and access to telemedicine during the\npandemic were independent risk factors for anxiety.\nConclusion: Patients with cardiovascular disease may experience anxiety and\ndepression not only because of disease complications but also because of the effects of\nthe pandemic. In facing the global challenge posed by the coronavirus, efforts should be\nmade to improve patients\u2019 psychological well-being in the management of populations\nwith cardiovascular disease.\nKeywords: cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, anxiety, depression, risk factors"

            "text": "COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020 and continues worldwide (5). First identified in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019, COVID19 rapidly affected the entire country and then spread to the rest of the world. To effectively stem the spread of the virus, the Chinese government swiftly adopted rigorous and comprehensive measures including enforced quarantine and isolation, and mobilization of medical resources across the country (2). Since April 29th 2020, the lockdown restrictions have gradually been lifted, and virus control entered the postpandemic stage in China (3).\nCardiovascular diseases are a leading public health problem worldwide (4). Increasing evidence indicates that patients with cardiovascular disease have a higher rate of psychological disorders than is found in the general population, and mental health status is associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality (6, 7). Previous studies have shown that largescale disasters such as major health emergencies may trigger stress related disorders such as anxiety, sadness, insomnia and confusion (7, 8). Understanding patients\u2019 psychological distress and behavioral responses to emerging infectious diseases may be important in cardiovascular disease management (9). A variety of studies have focused on the effects of COVID19 on the public during lockdown (10, 11); however, data on the prevalence of psychological disorders in patients with cardiovascular disease in the mitigation stage of the pandemic are limited.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we aimed to address the rates of anxiety and depression in patients with underlying\ncardiovascular disease, and to explore the related risk factors during the post-COVID-19 period in China."

The participants came from four provinces (Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai) in southeast China, majority (70.80%) were from Zhejiang Province. The regional distribution of the respondents is presented in Figure 1. After scanning a quick response code with their mobile phones, the participants completed the questionnaire in Chinese through an online survey. Illiterate patients were asked to answer orally and have their family members fill in the questionnaire on their behalf.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients diagnosed by their managing cardiologists as having cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure and other heart diseases) according to internationally accepted criteria and (2) patients older than 18 years of age who were current residents of China. Patients were excluded if they could not comprehend the questionnaire or refused to provide consent.

First, social-demographic characteristics, clinical information on the participants and their medical experiences during the pandemic were assessed. The second part of the questionnaire comprised the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire.\nThe HADS questionnaire was used to investigate the rate of anxiety and depression in the participants. It comprises 14 questions: seven associated with the anxiety evaluation (HADSA) and seven associated with the depression evaluation (HADSD). Each item was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. For both HADS-A and HADS-D, we divided the respondents into subgroups by using a cut-off of \u22658 points for depression or anxiety to define pathologic and non-pathologic values, according to the recommendations in the literature (12, 13). Good reliability and validity of the HADS have been reported in a prior study conducted among Chinese residents with\ncardiovascular diseases (14), in which Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 values of the HADS, HADS-A subscale and HADS-D subscale were 0.879, 0.806, and 0.806 respectively, and the intra-class correlation coefficients were 0.945, 0.921, and 0.932, respectively. In the current study, the reliability of the HADS was even better, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficients of 0.889 (total scale), 0.804 (HADS-A subscale) and 0.812 (HADS-D subscale)."

Little is known about the presence of anxiety and depression among individuals with cardiovascular disease, particularly in the post-pandemic stage.\nThe results of this current study indicated 11.72 and 9.20% occurrence of anxiety and depression in participants, respectively. Compared with data from the peak stage of the COVID-19 outbreak reported in other studies (18.5\u2013 23.5% occurrence of anxiety/depression), the prevalence of psychological disorders among patients with cardiovascular\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 6 January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 758874\ndisease appeared to slightly decrease post-pandemic (16, 17). These results are consistent with findings from a study by Chen et al. (18) in Hubei, China, reporting that the prevalence of psychological distress decreased from more than 75% to approximately 15% during the peak and mitigation stages of the pandemic. Because psychological disorders are highly associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality (5, 13), the importance of patient mental health during the post-pandemic stage should be emphasized. Previous studies have focused only on the effects of temporal lockdown on patients with cardiovascular disease. Here, we provide initial information on patients\u2019 mental well-being during the long post-pandemic stage.\nTo better manage psychological disorders in patients with cardiovascular disease, emerging studies have reported on risk factors for anxiety and depression, and have indicated that female sex (19), low education (6), persistent complications and weakened physical function (20) are risk factors. The present study revealed that marital status was an independent risk factor for both anxiety and depression, and current monthly income was a risk factor for anxiety among patients with cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, most of the respondents had comparable or even greater income than pre-pandemic levels. The Chinese authorities\u2019 decisive actions and targeted measures against COVID-19, and the restoration of industrial chains, somewhat mitigated the effects of the crisis.\nWe observed no significant differences between the anxiety and non-anxiety cardiovascular disease subgroups in having relatives or friends who contracted COVID-19. However, the number of participants was limited, so these results may not robustly reflect real-world conditions.\nWe found that both anxiety and depression were more frequent in patients experiencing treatment interruption during the pandemic. Thus, ensuring a timely medical service is essential for individuals with cardiovascular disease during the pandemic. Access to telemedicine during the pandemic was confirmed to be an independent risk factor for anxiety in our research. The results of this study also suggest that the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the spread of telemedicine. More participants have used or heard about telemedicine after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine may compensate for traditional health care in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease during the pandemic."

First, the use of online self-reported questionnaire to measure the mental health of the participants and the small participation rate may have yielded results that do not fully reflect the real-world situation. Second, the cross-sectional research design of the study does not allow\nfor exploration of the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 on patients with cardiovascular disease. Third, the patients\u2019 current treatment regimens were not investigated in the study. Finally, this study was conducted in patients with cardiovascular disease in China, and therefore the findings may not be applicable to other populations. Because of the dearth of data in this field, this study, regardless of its limitations, should serve as an impetus for further research in other countries and other patient groups to investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic."
