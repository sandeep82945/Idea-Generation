Fifty healthy young adults (mean age = 19.96 \u00b1 1.03 years) engaged in (1) a MICE session, 20 min of continuous running on a treadmill at an intensity of 40\u201359% of heart rate reserve (HRR); (2) a HIIE session, 10 sets of 1 min running at an intensity of 90% HRR, interspersed by 1 min self-paced walking at 50% HRR; and (3) a control session, resting in a chair and reading books for 24 min. A spatial 2-back task was performed to assess working memory before, immediately after and 30 min after each intervention. Reaction time in the 2-back task was significantly reduced immediately after both MICE and HIIE interventions. The enhanced working memory associated with HIIE sustained for 30 min after the exercise, whereas the beneficial effects associated with MICE returned to the pre-exercise level at 30 min after the exercise. These results suggest that although both MICE and HIIE enhance working memory in young adults, the positive effect sustains longer in HIIE than that in MICE. The current study extends the existing knowledge base by suggesting that improvements in working memory with HIIE last longer than with MICE.",

The enhanced working memory associated with HIIE sustained for 30 min after the exercise, whereas the beneficial effects associated with MICE returned to the pre-exercise level at 30 min after the exercise. These results suggest that although both MICE and HIIE enhance working memory in young adults, the positive effect sustains longer in HIIE than that in MICE. The current study extends the existing knowledge base by suggesting that improvements in working memory with HIIE last longer than with MICE.\nKeywords: acute exercise, cognitive function, working memory, 2-back task, time course\nINTRODUCTION\nWorking memory refers to the ability to actively store and manipulate task-relevant information in a short period of time, which is a core component of executive function (Baddeley, 2010; Diamond, 2013). Working memory is essential in achieving academic success and solving complex cognitive tasks in daily life (Kao et\u00a0 al., 2017a). Evidence has shown that acute exercise produces transient improvement in working memory (Hussey et\u00a0 al., 2020; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2020; Olivo et\u00a0al., 2021). Previous studies used a single bout of moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), a traditional exercise, as an intervention program to explore the relation between exercise and working memory. Significant improvement in working memory after MICE cessation has been reported (Weng et\u00a0 al., 2015; Chen et\u00a0 al., 2016; Dodwell et\u00a0 al., 2019). In addition to traditional continuous exercise, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), which is defined as repetitive high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods of light intensity (Kao et\u00a0 al., 2017b), has been recognized as one of the most effective methods for improving exercise\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 766679\ncapacity, metabolism, and cardiorespiratory fitness (Weston et\u00a0 al., 2014; Batacan et\u00a0 al., 2017; Dolci et\u00a0 al., 2020). Recently, HIIE has been widely investigated for its positive influence on working memory during the period following the cessation of the exercise bout (Ai et\u00a0 al., 2021; Hsieh et\u00a0 al., 2021).\nAlthough the benefits of acute exercise on working memory is well known, it may vary according to exercise modality (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). Kao et\u00a0al. (2021) used a modified Sternberg task to assess working memory in healthy young adults and found that only HIIE enhanced the processing speed during memory retrieval compared with MICE and control condition. Northey et\u00a0 al. (2019) also found that the HIIE intervention elicited positive moderate-to-large effects on working memory in comparison with MICE. However, some studies proposed that MICE maximizes exercise-induced cognitive benefits versus HIIE (McMorris and Hale, 2012; Pyke et\u00a0al., 2020) and contributes to a significant improvement in working memory performance relative to pre-intervention (Tsai et\u00a0 al., 2021). The existing literature remains inconsistent about which modality of exercise, MICE or HIIE, is the more effective in improving working memory. Thus, further research to establish the relationship between exercise modality and working memory is necessary.\nAnother concern which needs to be\u00a0 addressed in the subsequent research is the time point of working memory assessment after exercise (Pontifex et\u00a0 al., 2019). Most previous studies exploring the effects of acute exercise on working memory focused on the immediate effects (up to 5 min after exercise) of acute exercise (Chen et\u00a0 al., 2014; Soga et\u00a0 al., 2015; Bediz et\u00a0al., 2016), with only a few studies examined sustained effects after exercise (Pontifex et\u00a0 al., 2009; Tsujii et\u00a0 al., 2013; Kamijo and Abe, 2019). A meta-analysis investigating the effects of acute exercise on cognitive function (including working memory) has indicated that the effects of exercise on cognition vary with the time of performing cognitive tasks (Chang et\u00a0al., 2012). The cognitive tests displayed the greatest effects 1\u201315 min after exercise, and then, these effects faded following a longer (>15 min) delay. Cooper et\u00a0al. (2018) used HIIE as an intervention and observed changes in working memory performance immediately after and 45 min after the intervention and only found an increase in performance at the maximum level of working memory load in the Sternberg paradigm (working memory load in the current study has three levels) immediately after exercise. In contrast, two studies (with the MICE and HIIE interventions, respectively) reported that the improvement in working memory capacity was prominent at the end of the exercise intervention and continuously elevated up to 30 min (Pontifex et\u00a0 al., 2009; Martinez-Diaz et\u00a0 al., 2020). However, these results contradict Chang et\u00a0 al. (2012) who suggested that physiological responses to exercise (e.g., heart rate, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine) predicted effects on executive function performance. When executive function was tested immediately after exercise, lower intensity exercise produced appropriate levels of physiological mechanisms that resulted in more beneficial effects on executive function; however, higher intensity exercise produced the strongest effects when executive function was tested delayed after exercise. To our knowledge, there are no\nstudies that have directly compared the sustainable effects of MICE and HIIE on working memory, and thus, the effects of different exercise protocol on lasting improvements in working memory should be\u00a0 examined.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the different effects of acute MICE versus HIIE on working memory and whether this effect remains stable after a 30 min recovery period using duration-matched exercise protocols in healthy young adults. Given that drive theories suggested a linear relationship between intensity of exercise and executive function such that the benefit scales in relation to increasing intensity (Chang et\u00a0 al., 2012), we\u00a0 hypothesized that (1) both the MICE and HIIE conditions would improve working memory compared with the control condition and (2) HIIE would have a longer duration of positive effect on working memory than MICE."

Participants completed the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; Thomas et\u00a0al., 1992) to exclude potential exercise risks. All eligible participants were right-handed, free of any reported neurological, cardiovascular, or pulmonary diseases and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The sample size is determined based on a priori power (G*power 3.1.9.2) analysis with a small-to-moderate effect size (\u03b72 = 0.23; Etnier et\u00a0 al., 2016), \u03b1 level of 0.05 and a power (1\u2014\u03b2) of 0.80 at the group level, resulting in at least a sample size of 33 to detect similar significant effects.

The display screen consisted of 25 white-framed 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm small black squares combined into a large square. A small square filled with blue was presented randomly in one of the 25 squares for 500 ms, followed by a 3,000 ms of response interval in which a black screen was displayed, resulting in a total response window of 3,500 ms (Figure\u00a0 1). Participants were required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to press the F button on the keyboard when the position of the current stimulus matched the position of blue square presented in the previous two trials (i.e., match trials), and press the J button on the keyboard when the two trials were not matched (i.e., no match trials). It was considered a false alarm (FA) when a participant incorrectly identified a trial with no match when the F button was pressed. The task contains two blocks of 23 trials each block, including seven match trials, 14 no match trials, and two beginning trials to which do not need to respond. There were 23 practice trials before the formal experimental trials.

Calculation of d\u2019 scores used the formula provided by Sorkin (Sorkin, 1999), z (adjusted target accuracy)\u2014z (adjusted false alarm rate).

The interval between each two sessions was \u22657 days to minimize any effects of the previous session, and for a given participant, the four sessions were completed at approximately the same time of the day. Participants were instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity, caffeinated beverages, or alcoholic drinks at least 24 h before each session. During the first session, participants completed relevant questionnaires and performed a graded exercise test (GXT) using a treadmill (ICON 705CST) for estimating maximum heart rate (HRmax) (Ferguson, 2014). The initial speed of the test was 8.5 km/h with the grade of 3%; then, the speed of the treadmill was increased by 0.5 km/h every 1 min and the grade was kept constant until the participant became volitional exhausted. A Polar H10 heart rate strap (Polar, Kemple, Finland) measured HR throughout the test and assessed the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) immediately after the test (Borg, 1970). HRmax was determined when participants met three of the following four criteria: (a) a plateau in heart rate resulting in no longer rising with an increase in the speed of the treadmill, (b) a peak HR \u2265 age-predicted HRmax [208 \u2013 (0.7*age)]\nFIGURE\u00a01 | The spatial 2-back task.

The entire protocol took participants approximately 6 h. The Polar H10 heart rate strap was used to monitor real-time heart rate throughout the exercise intervention.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate and delayed effects of acute MICE and HIIE relative to a resting control condition on working memory in healthy young adults using a spatial 2-back task. Results indicated that both MICE and HIIE have a beneficial effect on working memory in healthy young adults, but there were differences in the duration of the improvement between the two exercises. Improvements in working memory immediately after exercise were similar in the HIIE and MICE protocols. However, the benefit after HIIE lasted for 30 min of post-exercise recovery, during which MICE returned to the pre-exercise level. As we\u00a0 hypothesized, HIIE produced longer working memory improvement than MICE.\nConsistent with previous studies (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016; Dodwell et\u00a0 al., 2019), the current study found that MICE improved working memory immediately after the intervention, as evidenced by an overall decrease in RT with no difference in response accuracy for the 2-back task relative to that before the acute exercise. This finding may suggest that MICE improved the processing efficiency of working memory processes (McMorris et\u00a0 al., 2011). However, the MICE-induced improvement in working memory returned to pre-exercise levels 30 min after exercise. This is inconsistent with previous studies reporting that improvement in working memory induced by MICE (30 min of motor driven treadmill exercise) was not only reflected immediately after exercise, but also remained 30 min after exercise. Ji et\u00a0 al. (2017) also found a significant reduction in RT for working memory tasks after moderate-intensity exercise at 60% HRR (30 min treadmill running), and this improvement was maintained until 30 min after exercise. The discrepancies between these studies and our findings may stem from differences in the duration of the exercise intervention (Chang et\u00a0 al., 2015). A meta-analysis found that performance on cognitive tests was facilitated when participants completed an exercise longer than 20 min (Lambourne and Tomporowski, 2010). Improvement in working memory was not observed 30 min\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 766679\nafter MICE in the present study, probably because our exercise intervention was not long enough to produce a significant effect.\nThe present study demonstrated that working memory improved immediately after HIIE and lasted up to 30 min. This finding supports some recent studies reporting that cognitive improvements can be\u00a0 maintained for a period of time after HIIE. For example, Martinez-Diaz et\u00a0 al. (2020) used the Digit Span Test (DST) to assess working memory in healthy young men and found that DST scores obtained 30 min after exercise remained higher than those assessed before the exercise. Williams et\u00a0al. (2020) used high-intensity intermittent games-based activity to explore the moderating effect of physical fitness on the acute exercise-cognition relationship and measured working memory performance using the Sternberg paradigm. Results revealed that working memory improved in the high fitness group\u00a0 45 min after exercise. Our findings validate previous studies reporting that HIIE improves working memory (Moreau and Chou, 2019; Ai et\u00a0al., 2021), confirming that HIIE-induced improvements in working memory can be\u00a0 sustained until at least 30 min after exercise.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that HIIE was a more effective strategy for improving inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility compared to MICE (Tian et\u00a0 al., 2021a,b). In the present study, we\u00a0 provide evidence that HIIE is also effective in improving working memory. The improvement in working memory after the MICE and HIIE interventions implied some predictions related to describing the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of exercise on cognitive function. As a stressor, the transient effects of acute exercise on working memory are commonly explained by energetic arousal. This arousal is mainly expressed as increases in neural activation or general physiological arousal measured by heart rate, RPE, or other biological indices (Lambourne and Tomporowski, 2010; Netz et\u00a0 al., 2016). Studies have shown that arousal levels increase with exercise intensity (Yerkes and Dodson, 1908), with cognitive performance rising to an optimal level along with increased exercise-induced arousal levels (Lambourne and Tomporowski, 2010). The RPE was significantly greater after HIIE compared to MICE, which may lead to a higher level of arousal in the organism with HIIE than MICE, resulting in a longer duration of improvement in working memory. Changes in BDNF accompanying exercise participation can also contribute to improved working memory (Aaron et\u00a0al., 2015). Previous studies have found acute increases in BDNF concentrations in human blood serum after a single bout of physical exercise (Knaepen et\u00a0 al., 2010), and the\nA B\nC D\nFIGURE\u00a03 | Mean accuracy (A), mean reaction time (RT) (B), false alarm rate (C), and d\u2019 scores (D) for 2-back task.

Acute exerciseinduced changes in BDNF concentrations can predict memoryrelated cognitive performance (Skriver et\u00a0 al., 2014), possibly explaining the longer duration of HIIE on working memory than MICE. Further, the increased cerebral blood flow promoted by exercise may also be\u00a0 a possible mechanism for the improvement in working memory after acute exercise. Acute exercise promotes increased cerebral blood flow (Ellis et\u00a0 al., 2017; Steventon et\u00a0 al., 2021), which facilitates the transport of nutrients and oxygen to the brain (Vogiatzis et\u00a0 al., 2011), and the resulting increased oxygenation benefits broader cognition, particularly in the frontal areas of the brain that support executive functions (Lambrick et\u00a0 al., 2016). Some studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy have demonstrated increased cortical activation in the prefrontal cortex after exercise, corresponding to an increase in cognitive performance (Byun et\u00a0 al., 2014). Meanwhile, since interval exercise requires more complex coordination of motor movements and higher demands on executive functions, it may result in a greater increase in cerebral blood flow to the prefrontal cortex compared to continuous exercise and has a greater impact on working memory (Lambrick et\u00a0al., 2016).\nA few limitations must be\u00a0 taken into consideration. Firstly, the study compared the effects of two different modalities of exercise on working memory, HIIE, and MICE, but the energy expenditure induced by exercise was not equal, so it was difficult to determine whether the differential effects of HIIE and MICE on working memory were related to energy expenditure. Secondly, we\u00a0 propose that exercise-induced energy arousal increased BDNF concentrations and cerebral blood flow might play important roles in improving working memory. However, we\u00a0did not perform direct measurements of these physiological indices. Further studies are needed to measure exercise-induced changes in biological indicators, such as BDNF concentration and cerebral blood flow. Finally, the current study found that the benefits of HIIE on working memory lasted up to 30 min after exercise cessation. However, since the working memory test ends at that point, it is unclear whether the benefits of HIIE on working memory can be\u00a0 sustained for much longer."

Specifically, the MICE intervention significantly facilitated working memory only immediately after exercise. However, the enhanced working memory associated with the HIIE intervention was not only observed immediately after exercise, but also lasted for at least 30 min after exercise. Thus, the differential effects of HIIE and MICE on working memory provide support for the importance of exercise modality as a possible modulator of the relationship between acute exercise and working memory. The finding that HIIE is a more time-efficient method to improving cognitive performance compared to MICE may have some social significance. Long-term sedentary study and work with intervals of short-duration HIIE intervention could generate better learning and work performance that relies on working memory."
