    "abstractText": "The cross-linked microspheres were prepared and loaded with Favipiravir SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, by copolymerization of chitosan (CS) with a polysaccharide extracted from fresh pomegranate peels. Moreover, glutaraldehyde (Glu) has been used as a chemical cross-linker and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) as a physical cross-linker. The extracted polysaccharide was analyzed, and different techniques have been used. The analyses lead to the conclusion that it is pectin. The surface morphology of the prepared microspheres was studied using a scanning electron microscope, where the size and shape factor (S) of the Glu microspheres showed high values (74.27 \u03bcm) and (0.852), respectively, meaning their surfaces tend to be rough, whereas the SHMP microspheres showed a smaller size particle (20.47 \u03bcm) and a smaller shape factor (0.748), which gives an indication that the SHMP microspheres have smooth surfaces. The swelling studies have shown that Glu microspheres have a higher degree of swelling, which means SHMP microspheres are more compact. The prepared microspheres have shown a higher loading percentage of Favipiravir antiviral drug in SHMP microspheres (37% w/w) in comparison with Glu microspheres (35% w/w), where the electrostatic interaction between the Favipiravir ions and SHMP anions helps for more loading. The microspheres prepared under different types of cross-linking have shown initial burst release of Favipiravir, followed by a step of controlled release for a certain period of time, whose period depends on the pH of the release medium. Both Glu and SHMP cross-linked microspheres have shown high controlled release times in buffered release solutions at pH = 7.4 and for shorter periods at pH = 1.3 and pH = 9.4, which may be related to the type of electrostatic interactions between drug and polymer systems and their reactions with release solution ions.",

Natural polysaccharides, pectin and chitosan in particular, have expanded biological properties and a wide range of applications in pharmacology [2,3]. Polymers have been improved to have a technique that adds effort to the development of different technologies such as bioengineering, biotechnology, and medicine [4\u20136]. Drug delivery systems were early designs for delivering medication to a certain target inside a patient to increase the drug concentration in that part and prevent any interactions [7]. Biomaterials, or polymers, showed the ability to modify the pharmacokinetics of the drug [8]. The selection of polymers could play a significant role in\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3173. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15153173 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3173 2 of 15\ndesigning a drug delivery system with a controlled profile and known physicochemical properties [9]. Polysaccharides are one type of biomaterial used in drug delivery systems and have formulations suitable for drug delivery. Chitosan and pectin are polysaccharides of cationic and anionic structures, respectively, and have the important properties of biomedical polymers, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and mucoadhesivity with mechanical strength [7]. Chitosan is a linear heteropolysaccharide (Figure 1a) consisting of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl D-glucosamine connected with \u03b2-(1-4) glycosidic linkages [10].\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 16 macokinetics of the drug [8]. The selection of polymers could play a significant role in designing a drug delivery system with a controlled profile and known physicochemical properties [9].

Chitosan and pectin are polysaccharides of cationic and anionic structures, respectively, and have the important properties of biomedical polymers, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and mucoadhesivity with mechanical strength [7]. Chitosan is a linear heteropolysaccharide (Figure 1a) consisting of D-glucosamine and N-acetyl D-glucosamine connected with \ud835\udefd-(1-4) glycosidic linkages [10].\nThe main groups in chitosan are amino functional groups that have a significant role in the biochemical system and electrostatic interactions in drug delivery systems, and it is soluble in a slightly acidic solution [11,12]. The gelling biopolymer pectin is derived from plants, and mainly its chain structure consists of \u03b1-(1-4) D- galacturonic acid units (Figure 1b). Its chains are interspersed by rhamnogalacturonan sections with alternate residues of rhamnose and galacturonic acid [13]. Recently, pectin-based drug delivery systems have received a great deal of attention because of their gelling capacity, biocompatibility, and low toxicity [14]. Pectin microspheres are used in drug delivery by mixing pectin with other polymers to form hybrid pectin spheres. Pectin is highly soluble in water because it has a carboxyl group; therefore, it has a higher hydrophilicity than chitosan. Adding pectin to chitosan can improve its mechanical properties and increase its hydroflability. Therefore, pectin is widely used in pharmaceutical preparations for drug delivery in the form of gels, tablets, and films. Chitosan-pectin composites could increase the microspheres\u2019 strength so that they can control hydrophilicity and disintegration [15]. Favipiravir, the antiviral agent, is a purine nucleic acid analog (Figure 1c) that inhibits the RdRp proteins of RNA based viruses [16]. It is also used as an antiviral for Arena, Ebola, Bunya, and influenza viruses [17]. Favipiravir is an oral drug that was approved to treat COVID-19. It has shown fast viral clearance as compared to others [18].\nThe main purposes of this work were loading and orally releasing the Favipiravir drug under controlled conditions. A new hydrogel system was prepared by copolymerizing chitosan with freshly extracted pectin from pomegranate peels. The hydrogel was cross-linked by gluteraldehyde and sodium hexametaphosphate for chemical and physical comparison, respectively. The degree of swelling of the hydrogel microspheres was studied for both hydrogels with different cross-linkers. The hydrogel systems have been characterized by FTIR, 1H NMR, GC/MS, XRD, thermal, and SEM analyses. Maximum loading and efficiency of loading percentages were measured, and the loaded microspheres were allowed to release in different pH-buffered solutions, and their cumulative release percentages were calculated.\n.\nhe ain groups in chitosan are amino functional groups that have a significant role in the biochemical system and electrostatic interactions in drug delivery systems, and it is soluble in a slightly acidic solution [11,12].

Whereas the microspheres are cross-linked with SHMP (Table 5, Figure 10), their maximum loading (Lmax) has increased to 37 mg per 100 mg microspheres. The increasing trend in maximum loading (Lmax) for Favipiravir in SHMP cress-linked microsphe e (37 mg Favipiravir per 100 mg microspheres) was due to highly electrostatic interactions between the watersoluble Favipiravir t pH = 7 [34] and the ighly ionic salt sodium hexametaphosphate anions. Added to that, the dispersal holes and folds on their surfaces, beside the SHMP microspheres, are present in clusters, which significantly increase the retention capacity of SHMP microspheres in comparison with the non-ionic Glu microspheres.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3173 12 of 15\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nhavior with Favipiravir.

            "text": "The release profile of Favipiravir has indicated that the release of the drug is dependent on the type of cross-linking and on the pH of the release medium where the pH of the release medium has controlled the drug release pattern of microspheres by changing their degree of swelling due to variations in electrostatic interactions between microspheres and their ionic cross-linkers like sodium hexametaphosphate anions. The release pattern of Favipiravir from microspheres at different pHs was studied (Table 5, Figure 11), and Favipiravir was released first with a burst trend (%RB), where the amount of released drug increased in a fixed interval of time (Table 5, Figure 11). Moreover, the\nrelease profile of Favipiravir has indicated that t e release of the drug is dependent on the type of cross-linking and on the pH of the release medium where the pH of th release medium has controlled the drug release pattern of microsph res by changing their d gree of swelling due to variations in lectrostatic interacti s betw en microspheres and their ionic cross-linkers like sodium hexametaphosphate anions.

Moreover, the polymer chains in microspher s were relaxed, and the degree of swelling continued to increase. With microspheres, structural changes have taken place. Accordingly, because the drug was released in bursts and was not constant, this type of release is not useful for sustainable drug release. After the microspheres\u2019 structure reaches equilibrium, they start releasing drugs in a constant manner within a fixed interval of time. This step of drug release with a controlled trend (%Rc) has shown (Table 5, Figure 11) dependence on the release media and types of microsphere cross-linkers. The trend in burst release of Favipiravir from Glu microspheres has shown an increase from 9.8 mg in a release solution of pH = 7.4 to 23.8 mg in pH = 9.4. At high pH, the Glu microspheres reach their high structural relaxation, whereas in an acidic release solution of pH = 1.3, the microspheres compact the same as those in pH = 7.4 and reach their controlled release with minimum loss. The Glu microspheres give a controlled release trend different from the burst release step, where they release in controlled fashion for 30 h in a release solution of pH = 7.4, and the released amount of drug represents 72% w/w of their load of Favipiravir (Table 5, Figure 11). Similarly, the Glu microspheres released 66.8% w/w of their loaded Favipiravir in a controlled manner for 24 h in a release solution of pH = 1.3, meaning the microspheres swelled to a\nPolymers 2023, 15, 3173 13 of 15\nmoderate degree in an acidic medium.

The Favipiravir loaded microspheres were released at 72% w/w of their loaded Favipiravir for 36 h in a release solution of pH = 7.4 (Table 5, Figure 11). However, the main difference between the two systems is the controlled release time, which is 36 h for SHMP microspheres and 30 h for Glu microspheres (Table 5, Figure 11). In addition, the release of Favipiravir from SHMP microspheres in release media of pH = 9.4 was improved under controlled conditions, while it seemed not to be as good in pH = 1.3 acidic release media. This may be due to the electrostatic attraction between chitosan and its cross-linker SHMP ions, which hinders the release of Favipiravir.\nFigure 11. effect of solution pH on the release percentage of Favipiravir from Glu and SHMP cross-linked (CS-co-PE) microspheres.

            "text": "Chitosan was copolymerized with pectin, where the latter was extracted from fresh pomegranate peels and characterized for its structure. The prepared copolymers were cross-linked physically by SHMP, and chemically, the microspheres were cross-linked by Glu. The formed microspheres were characterized for their structures, crystallinity, thermal behaviors, surface morphologies, surface area, and degree of swelling. Types of crosslinking of microspheres have shown significant effects on their surface morphology; SHMP cross-linked microspheres appeared small in size with a smooth surface, while Glu crosslinked microspheres had a larger size with a rough surface. The loading of chitosan/pectin microspheres with Favipiravir and their release characteristics were evaluated as a function of physical and chemical cross-linking and varying the solution pH of Favipiravir release media. The depression in the degree of swelling of SHMP cross-linked microspheres shows the compactness in their form structure in comparison with those of Glu microspheres, as the shape factor (S) measurements proved. The prepared microspheres showed after 24 h inside a pH7 buffered solution of Favipiravir a maximum loading of 37% (w/w) for SHMP microspheres and 35% (w/w) for Glu microspheres. The release characteristics of leaded microspheres have shown differences when varying the pH of the release solution from 1.3 to 7.4 and then to 9.4, especially in the case of SHMP microspheres, due to the strength of electrostatic interactions between sodium hexametaphosphate anions and the ionized chitosan/pectin molecules, which controlled the release of Favipiravir in a better way. The SHMP microspheres in pH = 7.4 release media have shown a better controlled pattern for releasing Favipiravir, where the media ions could help for more interactions. Whereas, the Glu microspheres system has shown controlled release of Favipiravir better at pH = 1.3 than at pH = 7.4, which may provide more protons for electrostatic interactions between chains of chitosan and pectin molecules.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, F.H.J. & H.M.; Formal analysis, F.H.J.; Investigation, A.R.H.; Writing\u2014draft, F.H.J., H.M. & A.R.H.; Supervision, H.M.
