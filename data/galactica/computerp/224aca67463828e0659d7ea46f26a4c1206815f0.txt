conclusion We present FlexRDZ, an autonomous RDZ manager, and validated its design through a proof-of-concept prototype. Despite its limitations, FlexRDZ represents an intersection between a growing interest in autonomous control, digital twin modeling, and dynamic spectrum environments. We argue that systems such as FlexRDZ will be critical towards realizing an autonomous RDZ amidst the growing sophistication and complexity of wireless environments.
