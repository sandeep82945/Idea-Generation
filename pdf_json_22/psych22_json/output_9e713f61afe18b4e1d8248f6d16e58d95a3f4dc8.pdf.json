Non-suicidal\nself-injury (NSSI) is a serious and high prevalent problem among adolescents with mood\ndisorders. However, a systematic perspective on psychosocial correlates amongChinese\nclinical adolescents is still rare.\nMethod: The impact of several factors at the individual (i.e., sex, age, self-esteem, and\npsychological distress), family (i.e., family structure, family income, and family support),\nand social level (i.e., living environment, peer support, and teacher support) on the\nfrequency of NSSI behaviors were investigated in the current study. This research\nincluded 621 Chinese adolescents with mood disorders from 20 hospitals.\nResults: Three-steps hierarchical regression analyses indicated that lower levels of\npsychological distress and higher levels of self-esteem were most associated with less\nfrequency of NSSI behaviors. In addition, family support was negatively associated with\nthe frequency of NSSI behaviors. After controlling the factors at individual and family\nlevels, no significant association was found between the factors at the social level and\nthe frequency of NSSI behaviors.\nConclusion: These findings provide preliminary support for the notion that adolescent\nself-esteem and family support may effectively shield them from problematic behavior;\nnevertheless, adolescents suffering from more emotional pain can be even riskier.\nThus, further intervention strategies should consider the non-independence of individual\ncapacities, co-combinatory effects of mood disorder, and family environment in treating\nthose vulnerable Chinese adolescents.\nKeywords: psychosocial factors, non-suicidal self-injury, adolescent, mood disorder, self-esteem, family support"

            "text": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has been defined as a direct selfharm behavior without death intention (1, 2) and is particularly dangerous during adolescence (3). NSSI is far more common in China than in Western countries (4), with 20\u201357% of community adolescents reporting at least one incident (5\u2013 7). Notably, NSSI is particularly frequent in adolescents with mood disorders, such as depression (8), anxiety disorder (9), bipolar disorder (10), and post-traumatic disorder (11), with a prevalence rate of up to 60% (12). In turn, this co-morbidity between mood disorders and NSSI may further increase the maladaptive psychological outcomes, such as suicidal behavior, which has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners (13). Thus, it becomes imperative to identify modifiable factors associated with NSSI, which are of great reference for developing preventive measures and plausible interventions for these vulnerable populations.\nAccording to the integrated theoretical model (14) and socio-ecological framework (15), individuals\u2019 risk behavior is not a straightforward outcome of their own beliefs but a complex interplay between multiple levels, including individual, family, and social levels. The individual factors emphasize internal characteristics (e.g., capacities, mental health); whereas, family and social factors focus on social relationships or environments (e.g., family relationships, peer relationships, and teacher relationships). However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have examined the potential factors of NSSI behaviors among Chinese clinical adolescents by using a systematic framework, which only offers a limited understanding of the NSSI behaviors."

            "text": "At the individual level, mixed findings were observed for sex on the NSSI behaviors. For example, most studies showed that NSSI prevalence was 1.5\u20133 times higher in girls than boys (16, 17). This disparity may increase the clinical adolescent population (18), with girls significantly outnumbering boys (19). However, several studies suggest no significant relationship between sex and adolescents\u2019 self-harm behaviors (20, 21). Paradox findings were also found regarding the age difference. Barrocas et al. have recruited 655 American children aged from 7 to 16 years old. Their findings showed that older children report higher rates of NSSI than younger children (22). Nevertheless, these results were not replicated in a South African student sample (23). Taken together, there is still a need to clarify the sex and age difference in Chinese clinical adolescents\u2019 NSSI behavior, especially since the majority of the existing literature has been limited to community samples in the Western population (22).\nThere has been a link between the level of psychological distress and the NSSI behaviors (24\u201326). According to the emotional cascade model (27), NSSI would be served as a distraction strategy to rapidly reduce an individual\u2019s intensive negative feelings, leading to a sense of relief and even increasing their positive feelings. For example, Houben et al. found that individual with higher levels of negative emotion was more prone to NSSI behaviors (28). However, Hasking et al.\nindicated that psychological distress was not associated with NSSI frequency among students (29). Again, these inconsistent findings highlighted that more studies on the relationship between the level of psychological distress and NSSI frequency among our targeting population are required.\nMoreover, some individual capacities negatively correlate with NSSI, including self-esteem (30). As explicitly noted by researchers, a lower level of self-esteem is often characterized by an overly harsh and negative attitude toward oneself (e.g., I am not a good or worthwhile person). In line with the experiential avoidance model (31), adolescents may engage in NSSI with a wish to escape from or avoid their unwanted poor psychological feelings (e.g., self-critical, negative attitudes). Self-esteem may also be an essential factor associated with Chinese clinical adolescents\u2019 NSSI frequency. Taken together, the first block of potential predictor factors in the present study involved individual factors, including sex, age, self-esteem, and psychological distress."

            "text": "The supportive home environment (i.e., family support) may be a safeguard against engaging in NSSI for adolescents with emotional problems (32). Previous research has demonstrated that social support from family members can help community adolescents stop exhibiting NSSI (7, 33, 34). According to Bowlby (35, 36), inadequate parental support may exacerbate children\u2019s maladaptive coping techniques in the face of pressures, including suicide attempts (37). Thus, adolescents with emotional disorders may practice more NSSI behaviors to escape from the overwhelming and intolerable affect in the absence of supportive figures from their families.\nResearch on the familial structure has so far focused primarily on parent-child dyads, while remarkably little is known about siblings that adolescents were reported to spend more time with them than other family members (38). Siblings may act as protective factors against stressors ormay further serve as triggers for more NSSI behaviors due to the interpersonal competition and conflicts (39), which is also an interesting thing to be confirmed in our study.\nSeveral findings showed that lower family economic status was associated with more NSSI behaviors among adolescents. For example, a Swedish cohort study found that low parental socioeconomic status was associated with community adolescents\u2019 self-harm behaviors (40). However, a few research found no evidence for an association between family income and NSSI behavior, including Chinese adolescents (41) and Western adolescents with mood disorders (42). To clarify the findings on the frequency of NSSI behaviors within family contexts, the demographic characteristics (i.e., family income), family structure (i.e., only child or with siblings), and the level of family support were used in the second block as potential factors."

Adolescents\u2019 adaptive outcomes are linked to their relationships with peers\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 768400\nand teachers (43). For example, a previous study found that the quality of peer connections is strongly associated with children\u2019s internalizing difficulties (44), which are, in turn, positively associated with NSSI behaviors (13). Furthermore, adolescents who feel supported by their teachers are less likely to engage in NSSI behavior (45\u201347).\nChinese economic and cultural systems have differentiated rural and urban areas. Generally, the economic development level is relatively lower in rural regions, and cultural norms are more conservative (17), limiting their schema on NSSI. It\u2019s also possible that residing in a remote area with fewer social resources (e.g., social services, mental health clinics, and school counseling centers) would be a risk factor for the frequency of NSSI behavior. Plener et al. (48), on the other hand, discovered no difference in NSSI frequency between people living in German cities and those living in rural regions. Therefore, the third block contained three possible predictors: living environment, peer support, and teacher support."

Specifically, adolescents with higher self-esteem were less likely to participate in NSSI behaviors. The findings were consistent with the prior research amongWestern inpatient adolescents (57) and a non-clinical sample of Chinese adolescents (8, 58). There are two possible explanations. According to the Experiential Avoidance Model (31), adolescents with poor self-esteem have more hostile, critical, and unpleasant self-perception types, making them more likely to engage in problematic behaviors (e.g., NSSI) to avoid or cope with distressing inner states (57). Second, people with poor self-esteem struggle with body awareness, which can lead to a lack of feelings when it comes to inflicting physical pain on themselves, leading to increased selfinjury behaviors (59, 60). More research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanism between self-esteem and NSSI behaviors.\nIn accordance with earlier research among Western adolescents, psychological distress was the strongest risk factor for the NSSI frequency among adolescents (61). The most popular models of NSSI conceptualized it as an emotional regulation strategy (27, 62). For example, (63) reported that inpatient adolescents used NSSI behaviors to reduce their dysphoric affect. Thus, it is likely that Chinese adolescents with mood disorders who experience more psychological distress than community samples may also engage NSSI to cope with their excessive emotional distress (62). Therefore, intervention programs to teach adaptive emotional regulation strategies for clinical adolescents who experience higher levels of psychological distress may also reduce their engagement in NSSI (64)."

A possible explanation is that adolescents with poor familial support systems perceive their parents as untrustworthy, feeling unworthy of being cared for or loved (65). Specifically, by operating fundamental psychological defense mechanisms unconsciously, adolescents may internalize and experience the hostile image of their parents as self-hatred to reduce their painful feelings (65, 66), in turn, be more inclined to engage NSSI as a selfpunishment (61).\nAlternatively, NSSI was more likely to serve as a strategy to escape from the intolerable effect without more adaptive mechanisms.

For instance, parents provide the fundamental exemplary model, and their children learn how to express rather than repress their negative feelings and regulate emotions by adaptive strategies from their parents (68, 69), for example, crying or asking for help (70).\nAnother possible explanation is that those adolescents may engage in NSSI to \u201cget a reaction from parents\u201d (1, 62). In a large sample of Chinese high school students, You et al. subsequently found that \u201csocial influence,\u201d including \u201cget parents to understand or notice me\u201d and \u201cto get others\u2019 attention,\u201d were rated as secondary reasons for NSSI among (71). A helpful and friendly family appears to be a key defense against NSSI; according to all prior research, the result was consistent with previous studies of western adolescents (34)."

Interestingly, we found no significant association between social environments and NSSI among those Chinese adolescents with mood disorders. This finding is inconsistent with previous Western findings (72, 73). A possible explanation was that the poor living environment, including relationships with family, peers, and teachers might influence those adolescents\u2019 problematic behaviors via individual capacities, such as self-esteem. In line with the MultiSystem Model of Resilience (74), the external resources would contribute to individuals\u2019 internal resources, thereby promoting their adaptive outcomes. For example, Thompson et al. found that self-esteem was a significant mediator between peer relationships and adolescents\u2019 internalizing, externalizing, and delinquent behaviors (75). Additionally, it has also been found that adolescents who feel supported by their teacher may increase their sense of self-worth, predicting more emotional adjustment and less psychological maladjustment (76).\nTo further test this hypothesis, we used the mediation model. Interestingly, self-esteem was revealed to have a significant mediating effect between family, peer, teacher support, and NSSI behavior frequency. Further research should employ a longitudinal design to understand better how social environments affect the frequency of those Chinese adolescents\u2019 NSSI behavior."

            "text": "The study has several limitations. First, it should be acknowledged that all the measures in this study are selfreported, which may be an artifact of shared method variance. Future research using physiological measures, such as stress hormones, pain tolerance, may provide a more comprehensive perspective on NSSI. Second, the intersection of NSSI and sex has been limited by using small samples of boys drawn primarily from clinical populations. Future research designs should be more deliberate in selecting samples. Third, correlational and cross-sectional would limit us from drawing any causal conclusion, further producing biased estimates. Thus, a prospective, longitudinal design is required to tases the temporal order between variables overtimes. Fourth, clinical samples were obtained from different China regions, which helps represent the nation. However, there exist different cultural norms, social-economic levels, and other social characteristics. Thus, a region-level residual in multilevel analyses should be further considered (77). Fifth, individuals with suicidal ideation may employ different functions than individuals without suicidal ideation, which should be further explored. Finally, the underlying mechanism from social support to NSSI behaviors via self-esteem could be further examined in future studies. Despite these limitations, this study has examined the related psychosocial determinates (individual, family, and environmental factors) among a clinical sample of Chinese adolescents, which provides a starting point for further intervention studies.\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 768400\nM e n g e t a l.\nP syc h o so c ia lC o rre la te s o f N S S IB e h a vio rs\nF ro n tie rs in P u b lic H e a lth |w w w .fro n tie rsin .o rg\n6 F e b ru a ry 2 0 2 2 | V o lu m e 1 0 |A rtic le 7 6 8 4 0 0\nOur findings can help health professionals design the prevention and intervention programs among adolescents engaging in NSSI with the comorbid mental disorder under the Chinese context. Integrated interventions targeting low selfesteem and high psychological distress, such as the compassionfocused treatment (including self-compassion and emotional regulation), may help achieve more with less effort (78). Treating those adolescents with respect and dignity was also necessary. Second, the NSSI prevention and intervention program should provide parents with better tools to help their children. Specifically, helping educated parents improve communication, parenting skills, and knowledge of NSSI might be a promising direction for minimizing the possibility of adolescents engaging in NSSI. Thirds, the school-based intervention programs may significantly improve children\u2019s poor maladaptive strategies via strengthening their self-esteem (79)."
