"There are several policy implications for the findings of this study. First, all countries should be committed to increasing the depth of their RTAs, and continue to promote the deepening development of RTAs, so as to maximize the potential role of deep RTAs in improving residents’ health. On one hand, countries should continue to expand the coverage of RTAs, and actively conduct regional trade agreement negotiations with potential partners. Furthermore, on the basis of strengthening trade cooperation in traditional policy areas such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers, new areas should be further strengthened, such as the environment and labor. On the other hand, countries should upgrade the RTAs they have already signed. They should not only actively promote a high degree of liberalization in the border policy areas, but should also actively incorporate the behind-border terms, such as environmental protection and labor supervision, In addition, countries should grasp the concept of the development of RTAs as a whole, formulate differentiated development strategies for different development stages, and focus on strengthening the construction of important border areas and important behind-border areas to facilitate the establishment of deep RTAs. Besides these implications, there are also some limitations in our empirical research. This study is an empirical analysis for 143 countries around the world, not a specific study. Meanwhile, this study mainly analyzes the impact mechanisms of deep free trade agreements on residents’ health from the perspectives of employment and environment, but there may be other mediating factors."
