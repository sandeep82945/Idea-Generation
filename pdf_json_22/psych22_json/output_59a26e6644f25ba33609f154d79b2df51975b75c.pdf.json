            "text": "Clinical trials evaluating effects of treatments for mental disorders compare outcomes observed in intervention group with those observed in control group. Control groups in such trials sometimes deploy usual care or no treatment (passive controls), and at other times, they use placebo conditions including sham psychotherapy or inactive medication (active controls).1,2 The placebo conditions have been associated with placebo effect.3- 7 Variation in the effect of treatment observed in a clinical trial may be linked to the type of control group used, whether passive or active.1,2 There is a debate about the influence of placebo effect on estimation of treatment effect in mental health clinical trials 4,8,9. The magnitude of the placebo effect may vary depending on\u00a0psychological amenability of participants, the mental disorder and the type of placebo under investigation. It is therefore important to explore the influence of disorder and placebo type in order to decipher the extent of the placebo effect in mental disorders. This systematic review and meta- analysis determined the magnitude of the placebo effect in active control groups compared to passive control groups, and explored whether this effect differed between disorders and type of placebo condition."

The complete search equation that was used can be found in the Prospero registration protocol (Table\u00a0S2). In addition to the database searches, hand searches of placebo review papers and the reference lists of the included trials were carried out. There were no language restrictions. The selection process was carried out using the Mendeley citation manager.\nThree armed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with adult participants (18\u00a0years or older) diagnosed with, or being primarily treated for the symptoms of a mental disorder, as classified by DSM- V were included. The placebo needed to be described by the authors as a placebo, sham, nonspecific or equivalent. The no- treatment condition needed to be usual/routine care, waiting list or no treatment, which was of equivalent duration to the placebo condition. Allocation to intervention, placebo conditions or to no treatment conditions had to be by randomization. Trials were excluded if the disorder was linked to a developmental aetiology (e.g. dementia) or an identified organic aetiology (e.g. substance- induced persisting amnesia or acquired brain injury), or if the symptoms reported were linked to a singular non- persistent event (e.g. preoperative anxiety). Substance disorders and sleep disorders were excluded, as were studies that recruited healthy controls for no treatment comparison. Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently by R.F.- L. and B.R.- G. for inclusion and potentially relevant full- text articles were screened by R.F.- L. and B.R.- G. independently. When a disagreement occurred, the decision for inclusion was made by consensus."

            "text": "Articles that met the inclusion criteria were subjected to independent data extraction by two members of the research team (R.F.- L. and B.R.- G.) using a data extraction sheet that was collaboratively developed. The primary outcome measure extracted for results (e.g. pre- and posttreatment means and standard deviations) was linked to clinical assessment of the symptoms for the disorder afflicting the participants. When more than one outcome measure was reported, we selected one for meta- analysis using the following rules in order: standardized measures were prioritized over composite measures; if other- reported and self- reported questionnaire- based measures were both available as outcomes, data from the former were extracted because of the greater objectivity in these measures; when previous rules were met, the measure of preference was the one described by the authors as their main one or the one mainly directed to the psychiatric condition being treated.; when more than one measure met the previous rules, depression measures were prioritized over other measures, because they are the more common and could provide higher power for meta- analysis. For studies that use dichotomous outcomes, odds ratio were calculated and transformed to standardized mean differences (SMD) using the method developed by Chinn.12 Data were also extracted on sample characteristics (e.g. participating numbers, demographic composition, diagnostic and\nclinical characteristics), and study design (e.g. randomization procedure, type and length of intervention, placebo/ sham group types and no- treatment/passive group type). Where possible, we contacted authors for data that were not extractable from the published reports. This proved to be restrictive as this often related to papers published over 30\u00a0years prior to our data extraction, making authors difficult to trace or data difficult to obtain. No requests for additional data were met."

It covers five domains of bias: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. Within each domain, a series of questions (\u2018signalling questions\u2019) aim to elicit information about features of the trial that are relevant to risk of bias. A judgement about the risk of bias arising from each domain is proposed by an algorithm, based on answers to the signalling questions. Judgements can be \u2018Low\u2019 or \u2018High\u2019 risk of bias, or can express \u2018Some concerns\u2019. The outcome selected for the RoB assessment was the principal end- point of the outcomes selected for meta- analysis."

Standard errors were also calculated for continuous outcomes using an appropriate equating method.14,15 All preparatory conversion calculations were made using the escalc function of the metafor package for R.16 Effect size (ES) signs were inverted when an improvement was reflected in an outcome measure by scoring less. A favourable improvement in symptoms under placebo compared to no- treatment conditions was indicated with an ES value greater than zero.\nFor pooling results across studies, we used random effects model combining ESs in the meta R package.17 We determined the importance of size of placebo effect using Cohen's18 guidelines for interpretation, with standardized ES of 0.2 considered small, 0.5 considered medium and 0.8 considered large. Heterogeneity was expected across trials, with different disorders and placebos being metaanalysed. The extent of heterogeneity was estimated using\nthe I\u00b2 statistic with 25%, 50% and 75% regarded as low, medium and high heterogeneity levels.19 Subgroup analyses were conducted for psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression and schizophrenia), type of placebo condition (sham psychotherapy and inactive medication) and methodological quality score (risk of bias). Multivariable metaregression was carried out on four moderators (disorder, type of placebo, risk of bias and publication year) to explore their influence on variation in ES. We inspected for funnel asymmetry and Egger's test20 was applied."

Of these, 24 met the eligibility criteria, which included three with binary outcomes21- 23 that were not combinable in meta- analysis with continuous data and 110 were excluded. The reasons for exclusion were not having a placebo group, not having a passive group studies analysing a singular non- persistent outcome and studies with a healthy group. Characteristics and quality of the 24 articles (1244 participants: only control groups) included in systematic review, of which 21 were included for meta- analysis are shown in Table 1.21- 44 The trials were published between 1963 and 2021. Most trials concerned the treatment of adults with either an anxiety disorder24,28,29,40 or a depressive disorder,22,23,35- 41 with the remaining four aimed at treating adults with schizophrenia or a related disorder.\nThe placebo and the no treatment group allocations were incorporated in the same randomization procedure as the one used for allocation to the active treatment group. The exception was one study for which there was no active treatment.23 Within the included trials, 575 participants were assigned to the placebos, and 620 participants to the no treatment conditions. Sample sizes for placebo and no treatment conditions were relatively small (mean\u00a0= 25.14, standard deviation\u00a0= 21.60). Of the placebos used, eight trials used inactive medications, delivered either as a tablet or liquid. The remaining 17 were psychotherapeutic shams, consisting of either the nonspecific aspects of an active treatment or a plausible attention control. For the no- treatment conditions, the majority were either on a waiting list (12), received nothing (5) or were in receipt of the same routine care as the placebo group (7)."

Nine (37.5%) studies presented some concerns, and four (16.7%) studies were at low risk of bias\n(Figure\u00a0 2). The most common methodological flaw that included RCTs presented was the absence of reporting of randomization procedures or the presence of sub- optimal randomization procedures. Additionally, some studies where at high risk of bias due to a lack of statistical analysis plan or had multiple eligible outcome measures, which put them at high risk of reporting bias. Finally, some studies were at high risk of bias in measurement of the outcome mainly because experimental and active control groups tend to be assessed more often than their passive group counterpart."

Additionally, the overall results are obtained from a broad search with a large number of studies included, which makes the results more robust. However, we found that 44% of included studies where at high risk of bias and. Univariable and multivariate meta- regression failed to account for the moderate heterogeneity that we found in the meta- analysis. Nonetheless, it is important to note that results of multivariate meta- regression should be taken with caution, because the number of included studies for metaanalysis is relatively low for this model and can lead to overfitting problems.\nA limitation of the present study remains in the definition of the placebo group. Sometimes active interventions could be labelled as placebos by other researches. We made our best effort to systematically categorize in a transparent way which active control groups can be considered placebos or actual interventions, but it is important to take into account that opinions may differ over this.\nSubgroup analyses were low powered in some cases (schizophrenia and inactive medication), so results in such subgroups should be taken with caution. Additionally, it would have been of great interest to explore differences between different sub- disorders of anxiety and depression, as well as different passive and active control groups, but it was not possible because a larger number of studies would have been required to have enough power."

The low power on inactive medication is due to the fact that there is a lack of trials using passive groups together with the active control group in medical placebo research, which makes it difficult to generalize the result."
