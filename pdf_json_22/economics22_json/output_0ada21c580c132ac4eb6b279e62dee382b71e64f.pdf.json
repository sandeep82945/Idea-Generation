An increasing trend has been reported in secondary care costs over time; however, not enough data was available at this time to evaluate inpatient and outpatient costs versus treatment strategies. Similarly, further research is required to evaluate the costs and potential savings associated to new therapies. Numerous studies have evaluated the indirect costs of endometriosis in the past years, finding costs between 2022US$ 4572 and 2022US$ 14,079.

            "text": "Endometriosis is a poorly understood chronic disease, with profound consequences for patients in terms of pain, quality of life and infertility [1]. Endometriosis appears to be multifactorial, and its pathogenesis is still not fully understood [1]. Despite the limited understanding of the disease, with scarce data published before the 2000s, endometriosis is estimated to affect about 10% of women [2,3]. Over the past two decades, efforts have been made to improve the diagnosis of the disease, aiming to find reliable tests or biomarkers to diagnose endometriosis; however, the diagnosis and management of the disease still presents several limitations. Diagnosis delays are frequent, and they have been associated with a reduced life quality and a greater number of pelvic symptoms [3]. Moreover, the systemic nature of the disease still poses a significant difficulty in terms of finding an adequate treatment [3].\nNumerous diagnosis and treatment guidelines have been issued by national and\ninternational organizations over the past decades, aiming to provide standardized tools for the management of patients with suspected and confirmed endometriosis; current guidelines are summarized in Table 1 [4-9]. International consensus was reached to recommend incorporating the diagnosis and management of endometriosis into primary care settings, as included in the guidelines issued by the World Endometriosis Society (WES) [8]. In general terms, diagnosis should be based on the patient\u2019s history, symptoms and non-invasive imaging techniques. Similarly, the treatment choice should be guided by the specific needs and preferences of the patient, considering contraindications and potential adverse effects. NSAIDs are recommended as first-line therapy for endometriosis pain in all current guidelines, often in combination with oral progestines or combined oral contraceptives [1]; however, long-term NSAIDs therapy is\nnot recommended due to its gastric and renal side effects [4,8]. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) recommends the use of gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonists as a second-line treatment for endometriosisrelated pain [5]. Similarly, GnRH antagonists can be offered as second-line treatment although the evidence in terms of dosage or duration of treatment is still limited [5,10]. In addition to pharmacological treatment many patients require surgical removal of endometriotic tissue, in order to reduce pain and other symptoms [3]. Surgical treatment can be offered as an option to reduce pain and improve quality of life. The most common interventions include laparoscopy, laparotomy and hysterectomy, with specific recommendations issued depending on the tissue affected, aiming to reduce post-surgical recurrence rates [5,6]. European guidelines recommend complete surgical removal of lesions in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis involving vagina, bowel, bladder and ureters, after considering the possible risks and benefits [5,6]. The long-term healthcare requirements of patients with endometriosis and the shortcomings in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease are associated with a significant economic burden, both in terms of direct and indirect costs [11]. Four publications have reviewed various aspects around the burden of endometriosis, published in 2006, 2007, 2016 and 2017, respectively [11,12-14]. Despite being associated to significant economic costs, the total burden of endometriosis remains poorly understood, considering the number of undiagnosed and untreated patients. In addition, previous reviews described limitations in the evaluation of the indirect costs of endometriosis. This review aims to examine and summarize research studies evaluating the costs of endometriosis, focusing on economic evaluations and burden of disease studies, and\nincluding direct and indirect costs. Cost-effectiveness evaluations were reviewed in the context of the most recently published international guidelines."

Given the changes in diagnosis and treatment protocols over time, studies published before the year 2000 were considered of limited current relevance. Search terms were: (endometriosis) AND (costs OR cost of illness OR cost analysis OR economic burden). In total, 485 abstracts were obtained in the literature search. After the elimination of duplicates, 289 abstracts were reviewed applying the following inclusion criteria: articles focused on endometriosis, articles analyzing costs of inpatient or outpatient care, or costs of treatment and follow-up, cost of illness studies and cost-effectiveness studies; 32 studies remained to be included in the review (Figure S1). Total costs, costs of primary and secondary care, productivity losses and indirect costs were manually extracted and reported.

            "text": "3.1 Direct costs of endometriosis\nTwenty-one studies describing the direct medical costs of endometriosis were identified in the literature search and included in this review. The economic burden of endometriosis has been primarily estimated from data obtained in retrospective database analyses and patient questionnaires (Table 2). Overall, direct costs have been evaluated in 17 countries in Europe and North America. The distinct settings, subpopulations and specificities found in cost studies hampered the direct comparison of economic data, and it is possible that the differences in the healthcare systems across different countries explain some of the variability in direct costs. Overall, fewer data exists based on primary care settings (general practitioners) compared to secondary healthcare settings (hospitals), and a small number of studies evaluated costs in inpatient and outpatient care separately. The costs of endometriosis in primary care settings ranged from \u20ac171 (2022US$ 320) to US$ 883 (2022US$ 1041) per patient per year in Belgium and Australia, respectively [15,16]. Greater variability was found in secondary care costs, which ranged from US$ 935 (2022US$ 1103) to US$ 13,199 (first post index year, 2022US$ 17,500) per patient per year in Australia and the United States, respectively [16,17]. Additionally, the cost per admission was US$ 39,662 (2022US$ 48,379) between 2014 and 2015 in one study evaluating admission costs in the United States [18]. In terms of temporal trends, two studies described an increasing trend in total secondary care costs, one in Spain between 2014 and 2017 and one in the United States between 2006 and 2015 [18,19]. The total direct medical cost of endometriosis ranged from CA$ 1164 (2022US$ 1459) to US$ 16,573 (2022US$ 20,239) per patient per year in Canada and the United States, respectively [20,21]. Surgical interventions were one of the main cost drivers, increasing 3-fold the total direct medical cost per patient per year, from US$ 6365 (2022US$ 7773)\nregistered in a non-surgery cohort to US$ 19,203 (2022US$ 23,451) in a surgery cohort [22]. The costliest surgical procedures identified in cost studies were oophorectomy (2022US$ 17,016), excision (2022US$ 4980), cystectomy (2022US$ 2172) and ablation (2022US$ 1588), and laparotomy as a diagnostic procedure (2022$ 9668-13,894) [20,22]. Factors that increased medical costs significantly included surgery, hospitalizations, and infertility treatments. Diagnostic delays were also associated to increases in direct medical costs: total direct medical costs measured the 5 years before the diagnosis increased from US$ 21,489 (2022US$ 25,885) in patients with delays of less than a year to US$ 34,460 (2022US$ 41,510) in patients with diagnostic delays of 3 to 5 years [23]. The costs of medication were not always disclosed as a standalone item; when reported, drug costs were \u20ac117 (2022US$ 219) per patient per year in Austria, \u20ac190 (2022US$ 246) in Sweden, \u20ac191 (2022US$ 358) in Belgium 2009 and \u20ac320 (2022US$ 246) in a multicenter study in ten European countries [15,24-26]. In addition, several studies investigated the additional costs associated to opioid usage in patients with endometriosis in the United States, with the highest costs found in patients that were prescribed opioids both before and after diagnosis [27-29]. Finally, the cost of complementary therapies was often not covered by public healthcare systems, despite being described as a significant economic burden for patients, including expenses in physiotherapy, mental health specialists and naturopaths [30]."

Eight cost-effectiveness studies were identified in the literature search, developed in China, Germany, Japan, Spain, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States. Seven studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies, while one study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early diagnosis strategies. Early physician consultation was cost-effective in patients with dysmenorrhea [31]; the cost-effectiveness of early diagnosis and primary care attention is supported by cost studies, as reported in section 3.1 of this review [23]. In terms of treatment, the recommended approach, including NSAIDs and oral contraceptives, is cost-effective when compared to no hormonal treatment or surgery alone [32,33]. Two cost-effectiveness studies were found evaluating the cost-effectiveness of GnHR- based therapies: one study found elagolix (a GnHR antagonist) to be dominant versus leuprolide acetate (a GnHR agonist) in the treatment of moderate to severe endometriosis pain; a second study supported the cost-effectiveness of GnHR agonist therapies for the prevention of endometriosis recurrence versus conservative surgery only [34,35]. One study found 'no treatment\u2019 to be cost-effective versus intramuscular and intrauterine hormones and oral contraceptives to prevent recurrence of endometriosis after conservative surgery in primary care, however, GnRH agonists were not evaluated in this study [36]. In terms of surgical procedures, ultrasound-guided aspiration with ethanol sclerosis was cost-effective when compared with standard surgery for endometriomas [37]. Moreover, ghost ileostomy was found to be costeffective versus loop ileostomy in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum [38]."

The indirect costs of endometriosis ranged from CA$ 4043 (2022US$ 4572) in Canada to \u20ac7434 (2022US$ 14,079) in Belgium [15,20]. Comparison was established in a 2018 study using a cohort of patients without endometriosis in the United States, where costs of patients with endometriosis were 1.4 times higher than those in patients without endometriosis [21]. In addition, patients receiving surgery for endometriosis registered indirect costs 1.6 times higher than those without surgery [22]. Significant productivity losses were found associated with chronic pain and disability [16,24,39,40]. Total productivity losses ranged from US$ 208 (2022US$ 293) per person per year in Nigeria to US$ 23,712 (2022US$ 33,428) in Italy [39]. The calculation of productivity losses may consider the cost of presenteeism, the time when employees are at work but not working, and absenteeism, consisting of unscheduled absences [41]. One study based on patient surveys in Australia, estimated a cost associated to presenteeism due to endometriosis that reached US$ 6058 per person per year, while the estimated cost of absenteeism was US$ 3647 per person per year [16]. Data obtained in this study indicated that productivity losses associated to pain severity were a major contributor to the total costs of endometriosis [16]. When productivity losses were evaluated before and after surgical treatment, the greatest costs were incurred the 6 months before and following surgery [40]. Finally, one study specifically analyzed the salary of women diagnosed with endometriosis over a 5-year period after diagnosis [40]. In this case, the annual salary of patients diagnosed with endometriosis was lower and experienced a smaller growth versus matched controls; additionally, endometriosis patients registered higher risks of work loss events [42]."

            "text": "The grave consequences of endometriosis in terms of quality of life and infertility are associated with significant medical and societal costs. The delays in the diagnosis of endometriosis are common and are associated with a worsened quality of life and greater medical costs [23,43]. This review aimed to provide an updated overview of the total burden of endometriosis via the revision of available studies focused on direct and indirect medical costs, and cost-effectiveness studies of new therapies, relying on current guidelines. In an attempt to shorten diagnosis times and provide a more personalized and multidisciplinary care of the disease, international guidelines advise promoting the diagnosis and management of endometriosis in primary care settings [8]. This study reviewed medical cost evaluations that included both secondary care and primary care centers, providing data for each setting separately. To date, few studies have analyzed the medical costs associated to endometriosis in primary care settings and further data will be necessary to identify any existing trends in the use of primary care resources [21,16,25,26]. Despite limitations, data suggest that the medical costs of endometriosis are principally registered in secondary care settings, where the most expensive admissions are those associated to surgical interventions [22,44]. Surgery alone increased 3-fold direct medical costs per patient and often did not prevent disease recurrence [22]. The different healthcare systems found in different countries may explain some of the variability in direct medical costs, which ranged from 2022US$ 1459 to 2022US$ 20,239 per patient per year [20,21]. Two studies described an increasing trend in secondary care costs over time, however, data should be further analyzed to explore any changes in patients\u2019 hospitalization rate versus the rate of outpatient visits\nand the implications in terms of cost distribution [18,19]. In this direction, it could be hypothesized that favoring outpatient interventions and shorter hospitals stays could contribute to decreasing the burden of endometriosis from a healthcare perspective, yet current data appears contradictory. Inpatient care costs estimated by Prast et al [24] and Koltermann et al. [44] were five to ten times larger than outpatient costs, whereas As-Sanie et al. [27] and Estes et al. [28] found inpatient care costs to be significantly smaller than outpatient costs. In parallel, this review included an evaluation of cost-effectiveness studies, which was deemed of relevance when considering the introduction of novel therapies for the management of endometriosis. Emerging pharmacological therapies, including aromatase inhibitors, selective progesterone receptor modulator and GnRH antagonists, may be able to reduce the need for surgical interventions and could have an effect in reducing the total medical costs of the disease, although evidence is limited at this time [8]. Additionally, few studies measured the costs of complementary therapies, including physiotherapy, which are often covered by the patient [30]. The limitations in the access to these therapies via the public healthcare system often represent a source for inequality. Similarly, psychotherapy is generally not offered to these patients despite the higher levels of depression and anxiety documented compared to the general population [45]. The pain, depression and other symptoms associated to endometriosis and the high morbidity found in these patients correlate with significant physical and emotional disability [46,47]. The previously published reviews tackling the burden of endometriosis described a scarcity of indirect cost evaluations, an aspect that has improved over the past years [11,12-14]. Eleven studies were identified at this time\nquantifying the indirect costs and productivity losses associated to endometriosis [15,16,20-22,24-26,39,40,42]; these studies included data from a wide range of countries, and found that the indirect costs of endometriosis were significantly larger than costs in patients without the disease [15,20,21]. Surgery was also a determinant factor for indirect costs, with greater indirect costs registered in patients treated with surgery versus patients with no surgical treatment, especially the 6 months prior and after surgery [22,40]. Moreover, substantial productivity losses were associated with chronic pain and disability, ranging from 2022US$ 293 per person per year in Nigeria to 2022US$ 33,428 in Italy [39]. The societal burden of endometriosis is substantial, and data suggests that it also represents a long-term burden at the patient level. In addition to the aforementioned medical costs that are often not covered by the public healthcare system, including physiotherapy and psychotherapy, patients with endometriosis had a lower annual salary and experienced a smaller growth versus matched controls [42]. A similar effect in patients\u2019 salary growth has been observed in patients diagnosed with other inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease [48]. Several limitations influenced this review. Firstly, only full-length research studies in English-language were included in this review, relevant data presented in abstracts or other languages might have been excluded. Secondly, although a systematic approach was followed to review relevant publications in the field, limitations associated to the search or inclusion of articles must be considered. Thirly, great disparities exist between data obtained in different countries and using different study settings, including study population, time horizon and data sources, and comparisons should be exercised with caution. Generally, more data is available for Europe and North America, nonetheless,\nendometriosis plausibly poses a significant economic burden worldwide. Further research will be needed to fully understand the economic burden of endometriosis, as well as the costs associated to new treatment options."

            "text": "Endometriosis represents a significant burden for healthcare systems and society. Surgery was identified in a number of studies as one of the main cost drivers, presenting an opportunity to reduce medical costs with the introduction of alternative treatments with the capacity to reduce pain and further complications. Further research in new therapies is crucial for improving patients\u2019 quality of life and reducing the costs of this disease, while any future updates in national and international guidelines should focus on cutting the time to diagnosis. Additionally, the burden of endometriosis at the patient level should be considered and further analyzed, in terms of costs of complimentary therapies and the reduced salary identified in these patients."
