The full-length 45 MUC1 protein extends 200-500 nm from the apical surface of epithelial cells and is therefore an 46 important component of the glycocalyx1,2. At the mucosal surface, MUC1 has an essential barrier 47 function against bacterial and viral invasion3,4 but it can also be used as entry receptor by 48 pathogenic Salmonella species 5. Using knockout mice, it was demonstrated that MUC1 has anti-49 inflammatory functions6\u20138. However, MUC1 is most well-known for its aberrant expression and 50 glycosylation in different types of adenocarcinomas . 51\nThe full-length MUC1 heterodimer consists of an extracellular domain with a variable number of 52 tandem repeats (VNTR) of 20 amino acids, which are heavily O-linked glycosylated, a non-53 covalently attached SEA domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with signaling 54 capacity (see Figure 1). The VNTR region consists of repeats of 20 amino acids with the sequence 55 GSTAPPAHGVTSAPDTRPAP10,11. Each repeat contains five serine and threonine residues that 56 can be O-linked glycosylated and experiments with synthetic MUC1 fragments demonstrated a 57 high glycosylation occupancy at these residues12. In healthy tissue, the O-glycans on the MUC1 58 VNTR predominantly consist of elongated core 2 structures, while it remains restricted to 59 predominant core 1 structures in many cancerous cells13,14. 60\n61\n65\nThe overexpression and altered glycosylation of MUC1 in cancerous cells makes it a potentially 66 viable candidate target for cancer immunotherapy. In addition, MUC1 could be an interesting 67 target for therapeutic strategies that require delivery to the (healthy) mucosal surface. Monoclonal 68\nantibodies against the MUC1 VNTR can be powerful tools because of their multiplicity of binding 69 and possible applications in the diagnosis and treatment of MUC1-expressing cancers. Since the 70 late 1980\u2019s, several monoclonal antibodies against MUC1 have been described and explored for 71 the diagnosis and treatment of MUC1 overexpressing cancers15,16. Peptide mapping experiments 72 have revealed that many such monoclonal antibodies target a similar region within the VNTR of 73 MUC1, resulting in the definition of an immunodominant peptide corresponding to the 74 subsequence APDTRPAP17. One such antibody is 139H2, a hybridoma monoclonal antibody that 75 was raised against human breast cancer plasma membranes15,16. In different studies, 139H2 has 76 been applied for the diagnostics of MUC1-overexpressing cancers and 77 radioimmunotherapy15,16,18. In addition, the antibody is also widely applied as a research tool in 78 Western blot, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy to study 79 MUC1 biology16,19,20. To make this antibody available for general use, we set out to determine its 80 sequence based on the available hybridoma-derived product. Recently we have reported a 81 method to reverse engineer monoclonal antibodies by determining the sequence directly from the 82 purified protein product based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), 83 using a bottom-up proteomics approach21\u201324. Here we applied this method to obtain the full 84 sequence of 139H2. The sequence was successfully validated by comparing the performance of 85 the reverse engineered 139H2 and its Fab fragment to the hybridoma-derived product in Western 86 blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Reverse engineering 139H2 enabled us to 87 characterize binding to the immunodominant peptide epitope within the MUC1 VNTR by surface 88 plasmon resonance (SPR) and map out the epitope by solving a crystal structure of the 139H2 89 Fab fragment in complex with the APDTRPAP peptide. These analyses reveal the molecular basis 90 for 139H2 binding to MUC1 and illustrate a remarkable diversity of binding modes to the 91 immunodominant epitope in comparison to other reported structures of anti-MUC1 monoclonals 92 targeting the VNTR. 93\n94\nResult 95"

            "text": "The goal of our study was to obtain the sequence of the full length 139H2 IgG antibody using a 97 bottom-up proteomics approach. As a starting point, we used 139H2 IgG hybridoma supernatant 98 and purified the antibody using protein G affinity resin. The purified IgG was digested with a panel 99 of 4 proteases in parallel (trypsin, chymotrypsin, \u03b1-lytic protease, and thermolysin) to generate 100\noverlapping peptides for the LC-MS/MS analysis, using a hybrid fragmentation scheme with 101 stepped high-energy collision dissociation (sHCD) and electron-transfer high energy collision 102 dissociation (EThcD) on all peptide precursors. The peptide sequences were predicted from the 103 MS/MS spectra using PEAKS and assembled into the full-length heavy and light chain sequences 104 using the in-house developed software Stitch. This resulted in the identification of a mouse IgG1 105 antibody with an IGHV1-53 heavy chain paired with an IGKV8-30 light chain (the full sequence is 106 provided in the Supplementary Information). The depth of coverage for the complementarity 107 determining regions (CDRs) varies from around 10 to 100, indicating a high sequence accuracy 108 (see Supplementary Figure S1). Examples of MS/MS spectra supporting the CDRs of both heavy 109 chain and light chain are shown in Figure 2. Comparison to the inferred germline precursors 110 indicate a typical moderate level of somatic hypermutation (3% in the light chain; 10% in the heavy 111 chain), with some notable mutations in the framework regions, also directly flanking CDRH2.\u00a0\u00a0112\n113\n120\nValidation of the experimentally determined 139H2 sequence 121\nThe experimentally determined sequences of the 139H2 variable domains were codon optimized 122 for mammalian expression and subcloned into expression vectors with the mouse IgG1 heavy 123 chain (with an 8xHis-tag) and the kappa light chain backbones (see Supplementary Information 124 for the full amino acid sequences). Co-transfection of the two plasmids in HEK293 cells yielded 125 ca. 10 mg from a 1 L culture following His-trap purification (see Supplementary Figure S2). 126 Additionally, the Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region was expressed to study the monovalent 127 binding to MUC1. The recombinant 139H2 and Fab were then compared with the hybridoma-128 derived 139H2 in Western blot and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. 129\n130\n131\nFigure 3. Validation of synthetic recombinant 139H2 following the mass spectrometry-derived 132 sequence. (A) Immunoblot analysis of lysates of intestinal epithelial HT29-MTX and HT29-MTX 133 \u2206MUC1 cells with the original hybridoma-derived 139H2 IgG antibody and synthetic recombinant 134 139H2. (B) Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy imaging of confluent HT29-MTX and HT29-135 MTX \u0394MUC1 monolayers. Cells were stained for nuclei (DAPI, blue) and MUC1 (139H2, green). 136 The signal of the 139H2 Fab was enhanced to compensate for the expected low signal/binding. 137 White scale bars represent 20 \u03bcm. 138\n139\nTo investigate the specificity of the recombinant 139H2 antibody for MUC1, we performed 140 immunoblot analysis on lysates of the methotrexate-adapted human colon cancer cell line HT29-141 MTX, known for its high MUC1 expression, and a MUC1 knockout of the same cell line that was 142 previously described (see Figure 2)5. The original hybridoma-derived 139H2 recognizes one 143 predominant band at an estimated molecular weight of 600 kDa, corresponding to full length 144 MUC1, and this band is absent in lysates of the MUC1-knockout cells. The recombinant 139H2 145 showed the same binding pattern. In confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, original 146 hybridoma-derived 139H2 stains MUC1 at the apical surface in a confluent culture of HT29-MTX, 147 and this signal is reduced to background in the MUC1-knockout cell line. A similar staining is 148 observed with the recombinant 139H2. Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy using 149 the monovalent Fab fragment also showed specific binding to MUC1 in the wild type background 150 but with reduced avidity compared to the full bivalent IgG molecule. These results confirm that 151 the reverse engineered 139H2 antibody is functional and recognizes the full length MUC1 152 glycoprotein at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. 153\n154\nEpitope mapping of 139H2 155\nUsing the reverse engineered 139H2 product, we next characterized binding to the 156 immunodominant epitope APDTRPAPG within the MUC1 VNTR. Binding to the synthetic peptide, 157 including an N-terminal biotin and short peptide linker for immobilization to the SPR substrate (i.e. 158 biotin-GGS-APDTRPAPG), was determined by SPR. Binding of the full IgG was characterized by 159 a high and low affinity phase with dissociation constants of 17\u00d710-9 M and 43\u00d710-7 M, respectively 160 (Figure S3). We interpret this biphasic binding as an avidity-enhanced bivalent mode (both Fab 161 arms engaged with epitope, high affinity), and a monovalent mode (single Fab arm, low affinity) 162 of binding, respectively. In line with this interpretation, binding to a recombinant monovalent 163 139H2 Fab yielded a dissociation constant of 45\u00d710-7 M, similar to the low affinity binding phase 164 of the full IgG. 165\n166\nFigure 4.

(C) Comparison with previously reported structures of monoclonal 170 anti-MUC1 antibodies targeting the VNTR. Glycosylated residues of the epitope are depicted by 171 yellow square above. 172\n173\nTo better understand the molecular basis of 139H2 binding to the immunodominant epitope within 174 the VNTR we determined a crystal structure of the Fab fragment in complex with the synthetic 175 APDTRPAPG peptide (without N-terminal biotin or peptide linker). Crystals diffracted to a 176 resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 and a structure was solved using molecular replacement with a ColabFold 177 model of the 139H2 Fab. This also revealed clear density for the peptide epitope in contact with 178 the CDRs of 139H2 (see Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S4). 179\nThe APDTRPAPG peptide binds diagonally across the cleft between the heavy and light chains, 180 making direct contact with all CDRs, except CDRL2 (see Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S2). 181 Contact points between the peptide and the 139H2 Fab include hydrogen bonds with the peptide 182 backbone at 6 out of 8 positions. Both the aspartic acid and arginine residues within the epitope 183\nmake salt bridges with side chains from 139H2. While D3 interacts with R99 within CDRL1, R5 184 interacts with E50 and T59 near CDRH2, in addition to a stacking interaction with Y100 in CDRL3. 185 Neither residue E50 nor T59 in 139H2 is formally part of CDRH2, though both residues directly 186 flank the loop. Previous studies on the binding specificity of 139H2 have shown that R5 of the 187 epitope is crucial for 139H2 binding. The crystal structure reported here shows that interactions 188 with R5 are mediated by residues in 139H2 that are formally part of the framework regions of the 189 heavy chain, but both mutated compared to the inferred germline precursors (see Figure 2). Two 190 additional framework mutations in the heavy chain, i.e. Y35 and T97, appear indirectly involved 191 in MUC1 binding by positioning CDRH3 through hydrogen bonds with N106 and the backbone of 192 Y111, respectively (see Supplementary Figure S5). Finally, the T4 residue of the APDTRPAPG 193 epitope is a known glycosylation site, although 139H2 binding is reported to be unaffected by the 194 presence of a single O-linked GalNAc at this position14,25. The crystal structure reported here 195 shows the T4 side chain to be pointing outwards from the 139H2 paratope with no indication of 196 potential clashes that would preclude binding of the epitope with glycosylated APDTRPAPG at 197 the T4 position. In line with this previous report and our own structural data, we also found that 198 139H2 binds equally well to MUC1 reporter constructs with different types of O-linked glycans 199 (Supplementary Figure S6). 200\nComparison with previously reported structures of monoclonal anti-MUC1 antibodies targeting the 201 VNTR reveal a striking diversity in the modes of binding (a full overview of reported structures is 202 listed in Supplementary Table S3)26\u201336. Monoclonal antibodies 14A, 16A, and 5E5 all target a 203 different region within the VNTR. While monoclonal antibodies SM3, SN101, and AR20.5 all bind 204 to the same immunodominant epitope of the VNTR as 139H2, the peptide is either shifted or 205 oriented in the opposite direction relative to the cleft between the heavy and light chains. For 206 SN101 and AR20.5, the peptide runs across this cleft in the opposite direction compared to 207 139H2. In SM3 the peptide is oriented in a similar direction but shifted by approximately 2 residues 208 such that both D3 and R5 are contacting different CDRs. In contrast to 139H2, each of the 209 monoclonals compared above bind stronger to the glycosylated epitope. In the case of AR20.5 210 and SN101 this specificity can be explained by direct contacts made between the glycan and 211 CDRs of the antibody. However, for SM3 the orientation of the glycosylated T4 residue is more 212 similar to 139H2. In SM3 the GalNAc residue makes an additional hydrogen bond with a tyrosine 213 in CDRL1. A similar interaction is predicted for 139H2, albeit through a different group of the 214 GalNAc residue (see Supplementary Figure S7). 215\n216\nDiscussion 217\nOur study demonstrates how direct mass spectrometry-based protein sequencing enables the 218 reconstruction of antibodies from hybridoma supernatants. In addition to recovering such precious 219 resources for research and therapeutic applications, it also contributes to open and reproducible 220 science by making the sequences of crucial monoclonal antibody reagents more readily available 221 and accessible. Poorly defined (monoclonal) antibody products have notoriously been a challenge 222 to reproducibility in life science research and the present work shows that MS-based sequencing 223 can offer helpful improvements in this regard37,38. 224\nThe reverse-engineered anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody 139H2 reported here is suitable for 225 Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy and is likely suitable for other applications 226 in FACS sorting of MUC1 positive cells, immunohistochemistry and ELISA, as demonstrated for 227 the original hybridoma-derived product16,19,20. We show that 139H2 binds the immunodominant 228 epitope of the VNTR in a unique way compared to previously described monoclonal antibodies 229 against MUC1. Because of its previously reported glycan-independent binding, which we 230 supported in this study by the determined structure in complex with the epitope, the 139H2 231 antibody is an important tool for current and future MUC1 research. 232\nMethods 233\n234\nPurification of 139H2 from hybridoma cultures supernatant: 235\nThe 139H2 in hybridoma culture supernatant was a kind gift from John Hilkins from The 236 Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI). The 139H2 was purified with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast 237 Flow beads (Merck), washed with PBS, eluted with 0.2 mM Glycine-buffer pH 2.5, neutralized 238 with 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8 and dialyzed against PBS with Pierce Protein Concentrators PES, 30 kDa 239 MWCO. 240\n241\nBottom-up proteomics \u2013 in-solution digestion: 242\n139H2 was denatured in 2% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 200 mM Tris-HCl, and 10 mM Tris(2-243 carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), pH 8.0 at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 30 min incubation at 37 244 \u00b0C for reduction. The samples were then alkylated by adding iodoacetic acid to a final 245 concentration of 40 mM and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. 3 \u03bcg sample 246 was then digested by one of the following proteases: trypsin (Promega) and elastase (Sigma-247 Aldrich) in a 1:50 ratio (w/w) in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37 248 \u00b0C for 4 h. After digestion, SDC was removed by adding 2 \u03bcL of formic acid (FA) and centrifuged 249 at 14000\u00d7 g for 20 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant containing the peptides was 250 collected for desalting on a 30 \u03bcm Oasis HLB 96-well plate (Waters). The Oasis HLB sorbent was 251 activated with 100% acetonitrile and subsequently equilibrated with 10% formic acid in water. 252 Next, peptides were bound to the sorbent, washed twice with 10% formic acid in water, and eluted 253 with 100 \u03bcL of 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid in water (v/v). 254\n255\nBottom-up proteomics \u2013 in-gel digestion: 256\nThe hybridoma 139H2 was loaded on a 4%-12% Bis-Tris precast gel (Bio-Rad) in non-reducing 257 conditions and run at 120 V in 3-Morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (Bio-Rad). 258 Bands were visualized with Imperial Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the size of the 259 fragments evaluated by running a protein standard ladder (Bio-Rad). The Fab bands were cut 260 and reduced by 10 mM TCEP at 37 \u00b0C, then alkylated in 40 mM IAA at RT in the dark, followed 261 by alkylation in 40 mM IAA at RT in the dark. The Fab bands were digested by chymotrypsin and 262\nthermolysin at 37 \u00b0C overnight in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The peptides were 263 extracted with two steps incubation at RT in 50% ACN, and 0.01% TFA, and then 100% ACN 264 respectively. 265\n266\nBottom-up proteomics \u2013 LC-MS/MS: 267\nThe peptides obtained by in-solution and in-gel digestion were vacuum-dried and reconstituted in 268 100 \u03bcL of 2% FA. The digested peptides were separated by online reversed-phase 269 chromatography on an Agilent 1290 Ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC) or Dionex UltiMate 3000 270 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. 271 Peptides were separated using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 2.7-Micron analytical column (ZORBAX 272 Chromatographic Packing, Agilent) and a C18 PepMap 100 trap column (5 mm \u00d7 300, 5 \u03bcm, 273 Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were eluted over a 90 min gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile 274 at a flow rate of 0.3 \u03bcL/min. Peptides were analyzed with a resolution setting of 60 000 in MS1. 275 MS1 scans were obtained with a standard automatic gain control (AGC) target, a maximum 276 injection time of 50 ms, and a scan range of 350\u20132000. The precursors were selected with a 3 277 m/z window and fragmented by stepped high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) as well as 278 electron-transfer high-energy collision dissociation (EThcD). The stepped HCD fragmentation 279 included steps of 25, 35, and 50% normalized collision energies (NCE). EThcD fragmentation 280 was performed with calibrated charge-dependent electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) parameters 281 and 27% NCE supplemental activation. For both fragmentation types, MS2 scans were acquired 282 at a 30 000 resolution, a 4e5 AGC target, a 250 ms maximum injection time, and a scan range of 283"

For the linker and Fc region of the heavy chain, the standard mouse Ig \u03b3-1 304 (IGHG1) amino acid sequence (Uniprot P01868.1) was used. An N-terminal secretion signal 305 peptide derived from human IgG light chain (MEAPAQLLFLLLLWLPDTTG) was added to the N-306 termini of both heavy and light chains. BamHI and NotI restriction sites were added to the 5\u2032 and 307 3\u2032 ends of the coding regions, respectively. Only for the light chain, a double stop codon was 308 introduced at the 3\u2032 site before the NotI restriction site. The coding regions were subcloned using 309 BamHI and NotI restriction-ligation into a pRK5 expression vector with a C-terminal octahistidine 310 tag between the NotI site and a double stop codon 3\u2032 of the insert, so that only the heavy chain 311 has a C-terminal AAAHHHHHHHH sequence for nickel-affinity purification (the triple alanine 312 resulting from the NotI site). After the sequence was validated by Sanger Sequencing, the HC/LC 313 were mixed in a 1:1 DNA ratio and expressed in HEK293 cells by the ImmunoPrecise Antibodies 314 (Europe) B.V company. After expression the culture supernatant of the cells was harvested and 315 purified using a prepacked HisTrap excel column (Cytiva), following standard protocols. (see 316 Supplementary Figure S2)) 317\nTo recombinantly express anti-MUC1 Fab the coding regions of HC variable region were 318 subcloned using AgeI and NheI restriction-ligation into a pRK5 expression vector. The subcloned 319 region contains the mouse Ig \u03b3-1 (IGHG1) Fab constant region with a C-terminal octahistidine tag 320 followed by a double stop codon 3\u2032 of the insert, so that only the heavy chain has a C-terminal 321 AAAHHHHHHHH sequence for nickel-affinity purification (the triple alanine resulting from the NotI 322 site). After the sequence was validated by Sanger Sequencing the HC/LC were mixed in a 1:1 323 (m/m) DNA ratio and expressed in HEK293 cells by the ImmunoPrecise Antibodies (Europe) B.V 324 company. After expression the culture supernatant was loaded onto a 5 ml HisTrap excel column 325\n(Cytiva) using peristatic pump. Column was reconnected to the \u00c4ktaGo system (Cytiva) for 326 column wash (50 mM Tris at pH=8, 150 mM NaCl) and step elution (50 mM Tris at pH=8, 150 mM 327 NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). Fraction from the peak corresponding to the Fab were concentrated 328 using Amicon Ultra-15 (Millipore) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using 329 Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva) in buffer 50 mM Tris (pH=8), 150 mM NaCl. 330\n331\nMammalian cell lines and culture conditions:\u00a0332\nThe human gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines HT29-MTX43 and HT29-MTX \u2206MUC15 were 333 cultured in 25 cm2 flasks in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal 334 calf serum (FCS) at 37 \u00b0C in 10% CO2. 335\n336"
