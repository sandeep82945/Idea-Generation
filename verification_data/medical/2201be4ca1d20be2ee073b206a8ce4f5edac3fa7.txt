"In this paper, we have studied the local unitary equivalence of quantum systems from the perspective of unitary matrix tensor decomposition. We have presented a detailed process to find the unitary matrices in the tensor decomposition of an arbitrary tensorfactorable unitary matrix. We have also derived a property of LU invariants that may be used to find a complete set of LU invariants. It should be noted that our schemes are convenient to discuss the local unitary equivalence when the number and the dimension of the subsystems are small."
