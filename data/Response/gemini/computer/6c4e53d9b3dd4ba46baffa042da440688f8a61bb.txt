1. **Investigate the use of different sensor fusion techniques for autonomous driving.** The paper uses result-level fusion for lidar-camera and radar-camera fusion. Other fusion techniques, such as feature-level fusion or decision-level fusion, could also be explored.


2. **Develop new algorithms for multi-type sensor detection.** The paper uses YOLOv4 and PointPillars for 2D and 3D object detection, respectively. New algorithms could be developed that are specifically designed for multi-type sensor data.


3. **Explore the use of artificial intelligence for traffic management.** The paper proposes a lightweight scheduling system for traffic management. Artificial intelligence could be used to develop more sophisticated scheduling systems that can optimize traffic flow in real-time.


4. **Investigate the use of roadside sensors for autonomous driving.** The paper focuses on the use of roadside sensors for autonomous driving. However, roadside sensors could also be used for other applications, such as traffic monitoring and incident detection.


5. **Develop new methods for evaluating the performance of roadside sensor systems.** The paper uses a variety of metrics to evaluate the performance of the RMMDet system. New methods could be developed that are more comprehensive and that can better capture the performance of roadside sensor systems in real-world conditions.
