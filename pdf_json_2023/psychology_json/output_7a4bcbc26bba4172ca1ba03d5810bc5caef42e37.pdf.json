    "abstractText": "Various 4-aminotetrahydropyridinylidene salts were treated with aldehydes in an alkaline medium. Their conversion to 5-substituted \u03b2-hydroxyketones in a one-step reaction succeeded only with an aliphatic aldehyde. Instead, aromatic aldehydes gave 5-substituted \u03b2-aminoketones or a single \u03b4-diketone. The new compounds were characterized using spectroscopic methods and a single crystal structure analysis. Some of them showed anticancer and antibacterial properties.",

            "text": "Recently, we described the synthesis and antiprotozoal potency of 4-aminotetrahydropyridinylidene salts [1] and of 1-benzyl derivatives of these salts with enhanced antiprotozoal activities [2,3]. The insertion of an additional benzyl group in ring position 3 via alkylation under basic conditions yielded 1,3-disubstituted compounds with increased antiplasmodial activity [4]. This paper reports the synthesis of 5-substituted derivatives. Surprisingly, the reaction afforded mainly \u03b2-aminoketones, less frequently \u03b4-diketones or the expected \u03b2-hydroxyketones, which are usually obtained from \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones under Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillmann conditions [5\u20137]. Similar Mannichlike products were obtained from formaldehyde and secondary amines with quinolin4(1H)-ones [8,9] or pyridin-4(1H)-ones [10,11]. However, their synthesis from 4-aminotetrahydropyridinylidene salts or from their hydrolysis products, the 2,3-dihydropyridin4(1H)-ones, have not yet been reported. Unsubstituted 2,3-dihydropyridin-4(1H)-one has been prepared from ethyl 4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridin-1-carboxylate [12]. Its 2,2-dimethyl analog has been synthesized from 2-methylhexa-3,5-diyn-2-amine [13] as well as from 1-ethenyl-4,4-dimethylazetidin-2-one via UV-irradiation [14] (Scheme 1). Further cyclic enaminones have been used as convenient synthons for numerous reactions including photocycloadditions [15\u201319] and alkaloid synthesis [20]. The structural and electronic properties of a series of 2,3-dihydropyridin-4-ones have been the subject of a theoretical study [21]. So far, only the insertion of an allyl or an alkenyl substituent in ring position 5 of a dihydropyridine-4-one has been reported [22,23]. 2,3-Dihydropyridin-4(1H)-one is a partial structure of cenocladamide, an alkaloid from Piper cenocladum [24]. This alkaloid and derivatives thereof have previously been investigated for their anticancer potency [25]. Furthermore, the dihydropyridin-4(1H)one moiety is part of derivatives of piperlongumine, which have been investigated for\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6869. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196869 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6869 2 of 19\ntheir anticancer activity [26] as well as of the potent antibacterial MRX-I [27] (Figure 1).

Then, a mixture of pyrrolidine and benzaldehyde in alkaline solution was added and considerable amounts of 2a were formed overnight. The reaction of 15 without secondary amine resulted in a high yield of the hydroxy analog 11 (Scheme 4).\nScheme 2.

Due to strong alkaline conditions, these are hydrolyzed to ketone 15 which is deprotonated to the resonance-stabilized anion 17. The formed methylene component is readily attacked by aldehydes resulting in aldols 18,19. If R3 is an aliphatic group, tautomerization to compounds 11,12 may occur. Moreover, a proton can be abstracted from the \u03b1-position of aldols 18,19. Cleavage of a hydroxy group from the formed resonance-stabilized anions 20,21 leads to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones 22,23. Addition of secondary amines in \u03b2-position yields \u03b2-aminoketones 2\u201310. This is the main reaction for the less electrophilic aromatic aldehydes as well as isobutyric aldehydes. Alternatively, compounds 22,23 can be attacked by anion 17 resulting in \u03b4-diketones 13, 14 via a Michael reaction (Scheme 5).\nolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5\nr ti is can be considered as follows: The 4- dialkylaminotetrahydropyridinylidene salts 1 are deprot nated by potassium hydroxide to their corresponding bases 16 in the first step.

Structure Elucidation The structures of the obtained compounds were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy: In the 13C-spectra, a signal shift from 162 to 189 ppm was observed for C-4 due to ketone formation. Furthermore, the resonance of the proton in position 5 disappeared in the 1H spectra. The remaining olefinic proton showed a coupling to the proton in ring position 1. Connectivity was proven by cross peaks of the newly formed methine proton to C-4 and C-5 as well as to NCH2 and aromatic carbons in the HMBC spectra. Through-space couplings were detected in NOE experiments (Nuclear Overhauser experiments) (Figure 2). Both can be seen in the Supplementary Materials.\nSche e 5.

Crystal Structure Determination of 6a: All the measurements were performed using monochromatized Mo K\u03b1 radiation at 100 K: C18H30N2O, Mr 290.44, orthorhombic, space group P b c a, a = 10.5346(4)\u00c5, b = 11.7374(4)\u00c5, c = 28.1853(11)\u00c5, V = 3485.1(2)\u00c53, Z = 8, dcalc = 1.107 g cm\u22123, \u00b5 = 0.068 mm\u22121. A total of 125,061 reflections were collected (\u0398max = 30.0\u25e6), from which 5084 were unique (Rint = 0.0642), with 4213 having I > 2\u03c3(I). The structure was solved using direct methods (SHELXS-97) [29] and refined using full-matrix least-squares techniques against F2 (SHELXL-2014/6) [30]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined with an-isotropic displacement parameters without any constraints. The position of the H atom bonded to N1 was taken from a difference Fourier map, the N\u2013H distance was fixed to 0.88 \u00c5, and this H atom was refined with an individual isotropic displacement parameter without any constraints to the bond angles. The H atom bound to C6 was put at the external bisector of the N\u2013C\u2013C angle at a C\u2013H distance of 0.95 \u00c5 and an individual isotropic displacement parameter was refined for it. The H atoms of the tertiary C\u2013H groups were refined with individual isotropic displacement parameters and all X\u2013C\u2013H\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6869 13 of 19\nangles were equal at a C\u2013H distance of 1.00 \u00c5. The H atoms of the CH2 groups were refined with common isotropic displacement parameters for the H atoms of the same group and idealized geometry with approximately tetrahedral angles and C\u2013H distances of 0.99 \u00c5. The H atoms of the methyl groups were refined with common isotropic displacement parameters for the H atoms of the same group and idealized geometries with tetrahedral angles, enabling rotations around the C\u2013C bonds, and C\u2013H distances of 0.98 \u00c5. For the 211 parameters, final R indices of R1 = 0.0431 and wR2 = 0.1167 (GOF = 1.035) were obtained. The largest peak in a difference Fourier map was 0.417 e\u00c5\u22123. The final atomic parameters, as well as bond lengths and angles, were deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC 2193723).\nCompound 11 from 15: Compound 15 (0.412 g (3.29 mmol)) was dissolved in a solution of KOH (0.752 g\n(13.4 mmol)) in distilled water (15 mL) with sonication.

Cytotoxicity against Human (Cancer) Cell Lines\nThe human leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM of L-glutamine (Gibco\u00ae, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin (all obtained from Gibco\u00ae). Human MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were cultivated in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Gibco\u00ae) containing 4 mM of L-glutamine, 10% of FBS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL of streptomycin. MRC5 cells were sub-cultured at 90% confluence via trypsinization using a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (Gibco\u00ae). Cytotoxicity was measured via cell metabolic activity, which was determined using XTT (2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide). Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 96-well plates (flat bottom; 100 \u00b5L/well) at a density of 10,000 cells/well. CCRF-CEM cells were immediately used for experiments, whereas MRC-5 cells were incubated overnight before being used for experiments. Both cell lines were treated with compounds (5 and 50 \u00b5M) for 72 h before cell metabolic activity\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6869 17 of 19\nwas determined using a commercial kit (Cell proliferation kit II, Roche) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CCRF-CEM and MRC-5 cells were incubated with the XTT solution for 4 h and 2 h, respectively. Then, absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex, Turku, Finland). Experiments were performed as two independent experiments carried out in triplicates. Cell viability was calculated relative to mock-treated cells (0.1% DMSO) using blank-corrected values. Vinblastine (100 nM) served as a positive control.\n3.3.2. Antibacterial Activity\nAll compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 0.01 mg/\u00b5L and the disc plate method [31] was used to detect bioactivity against Gram-positive (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. The results were noted as the ability of the compound to inhibit the growth of the corresponding test organism by noting the zone of inhibition (ZOI) around a disc (6 mm) as follows: mild clearance = detectable activity (\u00b1) (ZOI = 7\u20139 mm), clearance = active (+) (ZOI = 10 mm), and clear clearance = higher activity (++) (ZOI > 10 mm). Compound 6a has cyclohexane moiety that could have interfered with its ability to penetrate the bacterial outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide layer), disrupting this layer that is structurally significant in Gram-negative bacteria [32], while the addition of fluorine improved Gram-negative activity in 3a, 4b, 5a, 5b. Fluorine has the ability to change the electron distribution of a molecule, leading to modifications in the molecule\u2019s pKa, dipole moment, chemical reactivity, and stability. The introduction of fluorine can reduce the basicity of compounds, resulting in improved bioavailability as a result of better permeation via cellular membranes."

The expected \u03b2-hydroxyketone was only isolated after reaction with cyclohexane carbaldehyde. Aromatic aldehydes were yielded in most cases \u03b2-aminoketones and less frequently \u03b4-diketones. Most of the aminoketones exhibited anti-proliferative activity against human leukemia cells. A few of these compounds showed high inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli, whereas the \u03b2-hydroxyketone was the most active against Bacillus subtilis. These compounds could be a base for further investigation in order to produce leading compounds that could be further refined and optimized for possible applications.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28196869/s1.
