ABSTRACT Objective To examine the role of social media in promoting recall and belief of distorted science about nicotine and COVID19 and whether recall and belief predict tobacco industry beliefs. Design Young adults aged 18\u201334 years (N=1225) were surveyed crosssectionally via online Qualtrics panel. The survey assessed recall and belief in three claims about nicotine and COVID19 and three about nicotine in general followed by assessments of industry beliefs and use of social media. Ordinal logistic regression with robust standard errors controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, education, current ecigarette use and age was used to examine relationships between variables. Results Twitter use was associated with higher odds of recall (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.01 to 1.44) and belief (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.52) in COVID19specific distorted science. YouTube use was associated with higher odds of believing COVID19specific distorted science (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.09 to 1.60). Reddit use was associated with lower odds of believing COVID19specific distorted science (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.59 to 0.88). Recall (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.07 to 1.47) and belief (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.09 to 1.50) in distorted science about nicotine in general as well as belief in distorted science specific to COVID19 (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.34 to 1.95) were associated with more positive beliefs about the tobacco industry. Belief in distorted science about nicotine in general was also associated with more negative beliefs about the tobacco industry (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.02 to 1.35). Conclusions Use of social media platforms may help to both spread and dispel distorted science about nicotine. Addressing distorted science about nicotine is important, as it appears to be associated with more favourable views of the tobacco industry which may erode public support for effective regulation.",

There is a legitimate need to differentiate the harmful consequences of combustible cigarettes (CCs) from those of nicotine, as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) offers an evidence- based means for adults to quit smoking.1\u20133 However, dissemination of unsubstantiated claims about nicotine as a harmless stimulant or even a therapeutic method can undermine public health by promoting the use of an addictive substance.4 5 The distortion of science to fit a pro- tobacco narrative has a long history6 and is now emerging to counter evidence of the dangers associated with e- cigarette (EC) use.7 The tobacco industry has seized on the reach of social media to disseminate distorted interpretations of science and misinformation about ECs,8 9 often through the lens of harm reduction.10 The resulting impact threatens to position tobacco companies in a more positive light as advocates for the health of former smokers instead of purveyors and marketers of a harmful product, which in turn threatens to undermine regulatory efforts. This research examines the potential role of social media in disseminating distorted science about nicotine both in the context of\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 This study answers a novel and timely research question examining the distorted information environment surrounding nicotine and COVID- 19. \u21d2 This study addresses an understudied area of tobacco control research, namely tobacco users\u2019 perceptions of the tobacco industry and how this may play into public perception of their products, and by extension, how they are regulated. \u21d2 This study is cross- sectional and thus causality cannot be identified from the analysis. \u21d2 This study sample is sufficient in size, however, it is not nationally representative and therefore limited in terms of external generalisability.\nP atna).

However, those who hold more antagonistic views of the tobacco industry, wherein their actions are \u2018denormalised\u2019, are more likely to support policy regulating the industry.21 Thus, the tobacco industry\u2019s attempts to market their products as safe have the potential to undermine regulatory efforts.21\nAlthough nicotine is not responsible for many of the most well- known consequences of smoking,22\u201324 it is an addictive substance with strong potential for lifelong abuse.25\nMoreover, such use may have adverse consequences on neural development.26\u201329 Though evidence is limited, nicotine may pose additional risks to cardiovascular health.30\u201333 The societal consequences of the widespread belief that nicotine is harmless threatens to expand nicotine addiction far beyond current levels driven by smoking, as beliefs about nicotine predict product use.5 Recent research suggests that social media has a high volume of problematic information about nicotine and nicotine products.9 Thus, it is important to examine the prevalence and potential effects of such information, particularly on EC users to whom much of this information is targeted.34 35\nThe ambiguity surrounding COVID- 19 has made it a common topic of misinformation,36 particularly with respect to the effects of nicotine. One prominent example is based on a review of clinical data in Wuhan province, China, showing a significantly lower prevalence of smokers among patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) for COVID- 19 in the early months of the pandemic.37 38 These findings prompted an editorial39 and the registration of clinical trials testing the hypothesis that nicotine may prevent infection and progression of COVID- 19.40 While the clinical trials have not yet concluded, research conducted since does not support any therapeutic or prophylactic benefits of nicotine on COVID- 19.40 In fact, in addition to smoking increasing odds of disease progression and severe symptoms,41\u201343 a recent systematic review strongly suggests that nicotine, including ECs and smokeless products, are a likely risk factor for infection and progression of COVID- 19.44 Although more research is needed to make definitive claims about the effects of nicotine, there is currently no evidence supporting a therapeutic use for nicotine with respect to COVID- 19. Despite the lack of supporting evidence and significant evidence to the contrary, an analysis of Twitter discourse identified a substantial presence of content related to prevention or treatment of COVID- 19 with nicotine.45\nWhether a deliberate effort by EC advocates or a product of online discourse with minimal moderation, the dissemination of distorted science about nicotine on social media poses a barrier to public health. Researchers have identified a variety of potential impacts of such information among EC users including bulk buying and increased usage.35 Additionally, the dissemination of information distorting the science of nicotine safety is likely to directly undermine efforts to regulate the industry by creating more favourable views of ECs and the companies who manufacture them. The most recent review of the literature suggests EC- related content on social media tends to be favourable to EC use.46 Moreover, analysis of social media posts suggests an environment hostile to regulation47 with a significant presence of sponsored industry advocacy messaging.48 The dissemination of distorted science positioning regulatory efforts in opposition to public health threatens to further deceive the public regarding the safety of nicotine and ECs.7 The evidence to date highlights a need to examine the extent to which distorted science about nicotine is disseminated on social media and its potential impact on tobacco industry attitudes. Specifically, this work investigates the extent to which use of specific social media platforms are associated with recall and belief in distorted science about nicotine. We also aim to investigate the relationship between beliefs about the tobacco industry and recall and belief in distorted science about nicotine.\nP atna).

COVID- 19- related distorted science recall was significantly less likely among female participants, but more likely among black participants and those who used ECs. Greater Twitter use was associated with higher odds of recalling distorted science about nicotine and COVID- 19. Belief in distorted science about nicotine and COVID- 19 followed a similar trend. Female participants were less likely to believe these claims, while black participants or those who used ECs were more likely to believe them. Finally, greater use of both Twitter and YouTube were associated with higher likelihood\nof believing these claims, while greater Reddit use was associated with lower likelihood of believing them. For distorted science about nicotine in general, female participants were less likely to recall or believe these claims. Black participants were more likely to believe these claims, however recall failed to reach significance. EC users were more likely to recall and believe these claims, while lower education participants were more likely to believe them, but not to recall exposure to them in the last year. Although TikTok and Twitter approached significance in predicting belief in claims related to nicotine in general, none of the social media platforms reached significance for either recall or belief in these claims.\nRecall and belief in misinformation and tobacco industry beliefs Table 3 presents ORs and 95% CIs for ordinal logistic regression models.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The most important conclusion to draw from this research is that a substantial portion of 18\u201334 years olds, a demographic far less likely to smoke CCs than previous generations,51 accept several erroneous claims about nicotine. In our sample, nearly one in three believed nicotine to be no more harmful than a cup of coffee, one in four believed nicotine to be useful as a medical treatment for mood, attention or memory disorders and more than one in eight believed that unlike CCs, nicotine from ECs is not addictive. While it is important to address barriers to using effective cessation products like NRT, such as the overestimation of the dangers of nicotine,11 these data suggest there is also substantial danger posed by the underestimation of the dangers of nicotine. Young people who do not smoke and in the case of those suffering from mood or attention disorders may be at heightened risk of addiction,52 report both seeing and believing demonstrably false or unsubstantiated information about nicotine safety that is likely to encourage use5 and result in lifelong addiction.25 As the full extent of the known harms from ECs increase with more research,53 the continued dissemination of distorted science about the safety of nicotine poses a sizeable long- term risk to public health.\nPublic attitudes surrounding nicotine are still intrinsically tied to CCs. However, the proliferation of alternative nicotine products like ECs will inevitably lead to youth and young adult perceptions of nicotine divorced from the connotation of smoking. As such perceptions evolve, future research must examine the influence of both formal and informal information channels on attitudes and beliefs about nicotine in its growing variety of forms.\nThe second important conclusion drawn from this work is that social media plays a complex role in the current information environment. The often cited \u2018infodemic\u201954 of false and misleading information spreading\nonline encompasses COVID- 19,36 55 ECs56 57 and the intersection of the two.45 However, false and misleading information varies from unintentionally incorrect misinformation to intentionally deceitful disinformation.58 Distorted science exemplified in this study by the extrapolation of published scientific findings to support unsubstantiated claims about a prospective therapeutic role of nicotine during the COVID- 19 pandemic were recalled and believed more among more frequent users of Twitter and YouTube, but less among frequent users of Reddit. These findings suggest that the different characteristics of specific social media platforms that enable and influence the ways users of such platforms share and encounter information, that is, technological affordances,59 may offer a useful framework for examining the role of social media in both spreading and correcting problematic information. The lack of traditional media gatekeepers on platforms like YouTube and Twitter may allow misleading interpretations of these scientific studies to spread unchecked.34 60 Meanwhile, the moderated forums or subreddits encouraging lengthy discussions on Reddit may facilitate a user base that is more informed than social media platforms with restrictive character limits and a lack of formal moderation.61 Previous research suggesting many users view Reddit as a trusted source of actionable health information61 62 suggests Reddit may have utility in disseminating correct information to counter distorted science and other forms of misinformation and disinformation. Thus, although complicit in the dissemination of distorted science about ECs and nicotine, social media may also offer a crucial tool in reducing the impact of such information. That said, it is also important to note that Reddit and Twitter were not used as frequently as other platforms among our study participants. This is reflective of the greater social media environment wherein Twitter and Reddit,\nP atna).

We hesitate to hypothesise a basis for these trends due to the small sample of racial and ethnic minority participants surveyed in our convenience sample. That said, these findings emphasise the need for further research into understanding the racial and ethnic differences in the impact of misinformation.\nFinally, our finding that the tobacco industry\u2019s reputation is likely improved by the spread of distorted science has distinct regulatory implications. The prevalence of positive beliefs related to the tobacco industry\u2019s role in ending smoking, donating to charity, and that nearly half of our sample (46%) believed that the tobacco industry was honest about the effects of their products indicates that 18\u201334 years olds are increasingly ambivalent about the role of the tobacco industry in society. Unsubstantiated information about potentially therapeutic effects of nicotine, framing ECs and other mass- marketed nicotine products as tools for \u2018harm reduction\u2019 and efforts to distance nicotine from cigarettes in favour of likening nicotine use to caffeine from a cup of coffee mirror old strategies used by tobacco companies to promote CCs.64 For example, one ad from Bidi stick states \u2018a bidi stick a day keeps the pulmonologist away\u2019,65 conflating the potential reduced harm with switching from CCs to ECs with objectively false claims of pulmonary benefits of using the product. The tobacco industry continues to spend significantly on corporate social responsibility campaigns66 67 and strategically promote products as environmentally friendly67 68 or their brands as charitable.69 Intervention strategies highlighting deception and manipulation by the tobacco industry have been among the most effective strategies for deterring tobacco use.70 By positioning ECs as the necessary antidote to CCs, the tobacco industry uses distorted science and other forms of misinformation to mobilise public support against regulation of ECs, potentially leveraging their own past deception to permit unchecked promotion of ECs to a generation of non- smokers. Previous research supports the use of news literacy campaigns and expert correction as strategies for combatting misinformation. Moreover, in addition to the importance of monitoring the channels through which problematic information spreads to vulnerable subpopulations, the US Surgeon General\u2019s report on health misinformation highlights the importance of \u2018prebunking\u2019 to inoculate the public to the sorts of misinformation they are likely to encounter.71 72\nA crucial reason to monitor the spread of distorted science and other forms of misinformation about nicotine on social media is that beliefs about nicotine are associated with individual behaviour, notably nicotine product\ncuriosity, susceptibility and use.5 However, this research focuses on the relationship between distorted science and industry attitudes because efforts intended to mobilise political opposition to regulation on social media exemplified by hashtags like #wevapewevote or #flavorssavelives often rely on misinformation.73 Such misinformation is problematic beyond the scope of behaviour, as favourable public opinion is integral to the success of tobacco control policies.74\u201376 It appears that more antagonistic views of the tobacco industry are tied to greater support for tobacco industry regulation.21 There is substantial evidence supporting the problematic influence of misinformation on behaviour in the context of nicotine and tobacco.4 8 9 77 However, future research should more closely examine the specific effects of distorted science on individual behaviour as well."

Although we provide evidence of an association between use of specific social media platforms and recall and belief in misinformation and disinformation, we do not assess whether exposure to such information occurred on social media in general or any specific platform. Thus, while the proliferation of misinformation on social media is a welldocumented phenomenon,35 45 our data do not provide definitive evidence that misinformation is more likely to spread on Twitter versus Reddit, but rather that Twitter users are more likely to recall and believe such information, whereas Reddit users are less likely.\nAs with any survey, inferences about causality or effect sizes at a population level are limited. Moreover, methods used to maintain data quality for online opt- in surveys such as the attention checks we used may pose further limitations to studying the people most susceptible to misinformation. Although it is best practice not to overinterpret responses from respondents screened out by such attention checks, we note that recall and belief of distorted science was significantly higher among those who failed them. Thus, methodological approaches to studying misinformation should account for the fact that the same inattentiveness we use to screen responses for surveys may also screen out misinformationsusceptible participants. Though our estimates likely differ from general population parameters, this study provides robust evidence that young adult EC users are more likely to recall and believe misinformation about the effects of the products they use.
