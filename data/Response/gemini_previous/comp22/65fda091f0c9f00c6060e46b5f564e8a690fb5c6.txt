1. **Investigate the impact of popularity bias on different types of users:** The paper focuses on three user groups based on their tendency towards popular items: Niche, Diverse, and Bestseller-focused. Future research could explore how popularity bias affects other user groups, such as those who are new to a platform or those who have a specific interest in a particular genre or topic.


2. **Examine the relationship between popularity bias and user satisfaction:** The paper demonstrates that popularity bias can lead to unfair recommendations, but it does not explore how this affects user satisfaction. Future research could investigate the relationship between popularity bias and user satisfaction, and explore ways to mitigate the negative effects of popularity bias on user experience.


3. **Develop new recommendation algorithms that are less susceptible to popularity bias:** The paper highlights the limitations of existing recommendation algorithms in addressing popularity bias. Future research could focus on developing new recommendation algorithms that are less susceptible to popularity bias, and that can provide more personalized and fair recommendations to users.


4. **Explore the use of user-generated content to mitigate popularity bias:** User-generated content, such as reviews, ratings, and comments, can provide valuable information about users' preferences and interests. Future research could explore how user-generated content can be used to mitigate popularity bias, and to improve the personalization and fairness of recommendation algorithms.


5. **Investigate the impact of popularity bias on different domains:** The paper focuses on the book domain, but popularity bias is a problem that affects many different domains, such as music, movies, and news. Future research could investigate the impact of popularity bias in different domains, and explore ways to mitigate its effects in each domain.
