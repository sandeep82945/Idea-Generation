1. **Investigate the role of glutathione in the regulation of MIA40 and ERV1 activity in vivo.** This could be done by measuring the levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione in the IMS of plant cells, and by examining the effects of glutathione depletion or addition on the activity of MIA40 and ERV1.
2. **Determine the structural basis for the differences in redox properties between plant and yeast ERV1 proteins.** This could be done by comparing the crystal structures of the two proteins, or by using site-directed mutagenesis to identify the amino acid residues that are responsible for the differences in redox potential.
3. **Identify the physiological substrates of MIA40 and ERV1 in plants.** This could be done by using proteomics approaches to identify proteins that are imported into the IMS in a MIA40- and ERV1-dependent manner.
4. **Investigate the role of MIA40 and ERV1 in plant development and stress responses.** This could be done by generating mutant plants that lack MIA40 or ERV1, and by examining the effects of these mutations on plant growth, development, and response to environmental stresses.
5. **Explore the potential of MIA40 and ERV1 as targets for the development of new antibiotics and antifungals.** This could be done by screening for compounds that inhibit the activity of MIA40 or ERV1, and by testing the efficacy of these compounds against bacteria and fungi.
