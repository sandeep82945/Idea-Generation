    "abstractText": "A single qutrit with transitions selectively driven by weakly-coupled reservoirs can implement one of the world\u2019s smallest refrigerators. We analyze the performance of N such fridges that are collectively coupled to the reservoirs. We observe a quantum boost, manifest in a quadratic scaling of the steady-state cooling current with N . As N grows further, the scaling reduces to linear, since the transitions responsible for the quantum boost become energetically unfavorable. Finetuned inter-qutrit interactions may be used to maintain the quantum boost for all N and also for not-perfectly collective scenarios.",

            "text": "Performance boost of a collective qutrit refrigerator\nDmytro Kolisnyk 1,2 and Gernot Schaller 2\u2217 1Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, 28759 Bremen, Germany and\n2Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Bautzner Landstra\u00dfe 400, 01328 Dresden, Germany (Dated: February 27, 2023)\nA single qutrit with transitions selectively driven by weakly-coupled reservoirs can implement one of the world\u2019s smallest refrigerators. We analyze the performance of N such fridges that are collectively coupled to the reservoirs. We observe a quantum boost, manifest in a quadratic scaling of the steady-state cooling current with N . As N grows further, the scaling reduces to linear, since the transitions responsible for the quantum boost become energetically unfavorable. Finetuned inter-qutrit interactions may be used to maintain the quantum boost for all N and also for not-perfectly collective scenarios.\nBeyond foundational questions, the study of quantum systems is nowadays driven by applications of quantum computation [1]. While for these background noise [2] is usually detrimental, it can also be turned into something useful by considering energy conversion processes [3]. The ability of quantum systems to act as energy filters between reservoirs has fostered the whole field of quantum thermodynamics leading to numerous applications [4]. One of the most pressing questions in this area is whether quantum heat engines can outperform their classical counterparts in some aspects [5\u20138].\nAlready on a much simpler setting, the collective superradiant evolution of quantum many-body systems [9\u201311] is an example where quantum systems can easily surpass the speed of classical ones. This can for example be exploited in the collective charging of quantum batteries [12\u201314]. Also finite-stroke quantum thermodynamic cycles have been analyzed with collective quantum working fluids [15\u201323]. These mimic classical thermodynamic cycles like e.g. the Quantum Otto cycle [24, 25] and thereby depend on classical control parameters. Experimentally, such cycle implementations require a high degree of control that should not open additional decoherence channels and at present dwarfs the work that can be extracted (see e.g. [26]). The study of autonomously operated thermodynamic cycles [27\u201330] is so far limited to rather low-dimensional systems, as it requires understanding of non-linear dynamics.\nIn contrast, continuously operating heat engines [31] operate while simultaneously coupled to two or more reservoirs at all times. Examples for such devices are thermoelectric generators [32\u201335] or quantum absorption refrigerators (QARs) [36, 37]. With regard to collective effects, the latter are particularly interesting [38], as QARs require only reservoirs without particle exchange, for which superradiance is well-established. Proposals [39\u201341] and actual realizations [42] for QARs exist, and also collective couplings have been implemented experimentally in the past [43\u201345]. Therefore, in a previous work [46], a superradiant QAR constructed from interacting qubits has been analyzed. While su-\n\u2217 g.schaller@hzdr.de\nperradiant cooling performance could be observed at steady state, the device required fine-tuned interactions between the qubits throughout and the preparation of an entangled initial state.\nIn this paper, we consider a simpler realization based on qutrits that \u2013 at least in the simplest variant \u2013 need not interact directly and do not require an entangled initial state. We start by introducing the model in Sec. I, then explain the methods in Sec. II and discuss our results in Sec. III before concluding in Sec. IV. For the interested reader, technical background information is provided in the appendices thereafter. Throughout the paper, we use units with ~ = 1 and kB = 1, plot only dimensionless quantities, use an overbar to denote steadystate quantities, bold symbols to refer to the interaction picture, and {A\u0302, B\u0302} = A\u0302B\u0302 + B\u0302A\u0302 to denote the anticommutator."

            "text": "Our generic starting point is a total Hamiltonian of the form\nH\u0302 = H\u0302S + \u2211 \u03bd S\u0302\u03bd \u2297 B\u0302\u03bd + \u2211 \u03bd H\u0302\u03bdB (1)\nthat is composed of a system part H\u0302S , different reservoirs H\u0302\u03bdB and the corresponding interactions written as products of bath operators B\u0302\u03bd that couple to different system operators S\u0302\u03bd . In this paper, we will consider three reservoirs \u03bd \u2208 {c, h, w} that we label cold, hot, and work (hottest) reservoirs, respectively. These reservoirs are modeled by standard harmonic oscillator baths\nH\u0302\u03bdB = \u2211 k \u03c9k\u03bd b\u0302 \u2020 k\u03bd b\u0302k\u03bd throughout.\nAn introductory example for the system could be a single three-level model (qutrit) with ground state |0\u3009, first excited state |1\u3009, and most excited state |2\u3009, for which we could write H\u0302S = \u2206 |2\u3009 \u30082| + \u03b4 |1\u3009 \u30081|, where \u2206 > \u03b4 > 0 are the excitation energies and we have gauged the ground state energy to zero. We consider the case where the coupling between system and reservoir drives the individual system transitions exclusively, e.g. for the single qutrit via S\u0302c = [|0\u3009 \u30081| + |1\u3009 \u30080|],\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n07 84\n4v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 4\nFe b\n20 23\n2 + _ + + +\n+ +\n+\n+ +\n+ +\n_\n_ _ _\n_ _\n1\n1\n1\n4\n4 4\n4\n4\n4\n6\n6\n6\n12 12\n12\nFIG. 1. Left: Three-level cyclic systems performing refrigeration (N = 1, even cycle in bottom left panel and odd cycle with work and cold reservoir exchanged in top left panel). Right: For larger qutrit numbers (here N = 4), the 3N states in total are composed of N !/[(N \u2212M \u2212m)!M !m!] states (numbers inside circles) with M large (along red arrows) and m small (along blue arrows) excitations such that 0 \u2264 m + M \u2264 N . Ordering the eigenstates in layers by the eigenvalue of Casimir operators, the largest layer corresponds to the subset of permutationally completely symmetric states, which hosts (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 states. Subspaces of permutationally non-symmetric states can be grouped in additional layers, see Fig. 6, such that collective couplings then admit only intra-layer transitions.\nS\u0302h = [|0\u3009 \u30082|+ |2\u3009 \u30080|], and S\u0302w = [|1\u3009 \u30082|+ |2\u3009 \u30081|], compare Fig. 1 bottom left panel. In the appropriate regime (reservoirs held in thermal states with inverse temperatures obeying \u03b2c > \u03b2h > \u03b2w and the cooling condition \u03b2h\u2206 > \u03b2w(\u2206 \u2212 \u03b4) + \u03b2c\u03b4), the single-qutrit model implements a quantum absorption refrigerator (QAR): A device that implements stochastic cooling by on average absorbing heat from the coldest (c) and hottest (w) reservoirs and dumping the waste heat into the intermediate temperature (h) reservoir. We provide more details on the working principles of this configuration and also for the case where the work and cold reservoirs are exchanged (as in Fig. 1 top left panel) in App. A.\nIn this paper, we will instead as system consider N identical qutrits\nH\u0302S = \u2206N\u0302\u2206 + \u03b4N\u0302\u03b4 , (2) where N\u0302\u2206 = \u2211N i=1 (|2\u3009 \u30082|)i and N\u0302\u03b4 = \u2211N i=1 (|1\u3009 \u30081|)i count the total number of large and small excitations present in the system, and the introductory example is reproduced for N = 1. The reservoirs are assumed to drive individual transitions as before, but the coupling to the ith qutrit may in principle depend on its position. Thus, we assume as system coupling operators the multi-qutrit operators\nS\u0302c = \u2211 i [hci (|1\u3009 \u30080|)i + h.c.] \u2261 S\u0302 c + + S\u0302 c \u2212 ,\nS\u0302h = \u2211 i [ hhi (|2\u3009 \u30080|)i + h.c. ] \u2261 S\u0302h+ + S\u0302h\u2212 ,\nS\u0302w = \u2211 i [hwi (|2\u3009 \u30081|)i + h.c.] \u2261 S\u0302 w + + S\u0302 w \u2212 , (3)\nwhere S\u0302\u03bd\u2212 = (S\u0302 \u03bd +) \u2020. The dependence of the coupling on the qutrit is encoded in the coefficients h\u03bdi \u2208 C,\nand furtheron we will denote the limit h\u03bdi \u2192 1 as the collective limit, for which we write J\u0302\u03bd = lim\nh\u03bdi\u21921 S\u0302\u03bd and\nJ\u0302\u03bd\u00b1 = lim h\u03bdi\u21921 S\u0302\u03bd\u00b1. Analogous to permutationally invariant many-qubit systems, where one can generalize singlequbit Pauli matrices \u2013 the generators of su(2) \u2013 to large spin operators (see e.g. [47] for potential applications), we can also define the collective generalizations of the generators of su(3). We denote them by lower indices\nJ\u0302\u03b1 = 1\n2 N\u2211 i=1 \u03bb\u0302\u03b1i , (4)\nwhere \u03bb\u0302\u03b1i denotes the Gell-Mann matrix \u03bb\u0302 \u03b1 (with 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 8) acting on the ith qutrit (with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N). In the collective limit, we can express the system coupling operators by the large qutrit operators, specifically we have S\u0302c\u00b1 \u2192 J\u0302c\u00b1 = J\u03026 \u00b1 iJ\u03027, S\u0302h\u00b1 \u2192 J\u0302h\u00b1 = J\u03024 \u00b1 iJ\u03025, and S\u0302w\u00b1 \u2192 J\u0302w\u00b1 = J\u03021 \u00b1 iJ\u03022, see App. B. To represent the problem efficiently, it is advantageous to use common eigenstates of J\u03023, J\u03028 and the collective Casimir operators of su(3) like C\u03022 = \u22118 \u03b1=1 J\u0302 2 \u03b1. We provide some example states in App. C. The question we address here is whether one can observe superradiant performance boosts [48] analogous to results for interacting qubits [38, 46] also for this system of non-interacting qutrits."

Depending on the microscopic implementation of (1), a nonperturbative treatment may require modifications to the global Hamiltonianian [49]. As in (2) all qutrits are identical and do not interact, the transformation into the interaction picture is straightforward as shown in Eq. (D2). This facilitates the derivation of these master equations.\nFirst, we consider the Redfield-II master equation [50] (Lamb-shift omitted, see App. D 1 for details)\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i [ H\u0302S , \u03c1(t) ] + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(\u2212\u2126\u03bd) 2 ([ S\u0302\u03bd+\u03c1, S\u0302 \u03bd ] + [ S\u0302\u03bd , \u03c1S\u0302\u03bd\u2212\n]) + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) 2 ([ S\u0302\u03bd , \u03c1S\u0302\u03bd+ ] + [ S\u0302\u03bd\u2212\u03c1, S\u0302 \u03bd ]) , (5)\nwhere \u03b3\u03bd(\u03c9) = \u0393\u03bd(\u03c9)[1 + n\u03bd(\u03c9)] \u2265 0 is the product of the reservoir spectral coupling density \u0393\u03bd(\u03c9) and the Bose distribution n\u03bd(\u03c9) = [e\n\u03b2\u03bd\u03c9\u22121]\u22121, evaluated at the system excitation frequencies \u2126c = \u03b4 > 0, \u2126h = \u2206 > 0, and \u2126w = \u2206 \u2212 \u03b4 > 0. Since we analytically continue the spectral coupling density as an odd function \u0393\u03bd(\u2212\u03c9) = \u2212\u0393\u03bd(+\u03c9), we can express \u03b3\u03bd(\u2212\u2126\u03bd) =\n3 \u0393\u03bd(\u2126\u03bd)n\u03bd(\u2126\u03bd) \u2265 0. The generator (5) need in general not preserve the positivity of the density matrix [2] and need not be thermodynamically consistent [51]. For example, it may not exactly conserve the sum of all stationary energy currents leaving the reservoirs for nonvanishing couplings, such artifacts are of higher order than the accuracy Redfield approach though, cf. Fig. 7 in App. D 1. Nevertheless, it has for selective systems been shown to approach the true quantum dynamics in the appropriate regimes very well [52, 53], such that we use it as benchmark approach here.\nSecond, we consider the Lindblad-GoriniKossakowski-Sudarshan (LGKS) master equation [54, 55] (Lamb-shift neglected, see App. D 2 for details)\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i [ H\u0302S , \u03c1(t) ] + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) [ S\u0302\u03bd\u2212\u03c1S\u0302 \u03bd + \u2212 1 2 { S\u0302\u03bd+S\u0302 \u03bd \u2212, \u03c1\n}] + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(\u2212\u2126\u03bd) [ S\u0302\u03bd+\u03c1S\u0302 \u03bd \u2212 \u2212 1 2 { S\u0302\u03bd\u2212S\u0302 \u03bd +, \u03c1 }] , (6)\nwhich unconditionally preserves all density matrix properties and is thermodynamically consistent also for nonequilibrium reservoirs [56].\nThird, in the perfectly collective limit (S\u0302\u03bd\u00b1 \u2192 J\u0302\u03bd\u00b1) and for a completely symmetric initial state like e.g.\u2223\u2223\u03a8vacrep\u232a = |0\u3009 \u2297 . . .\u2297 |0\u3009 \u2261 |0; 0\u3009 (7) the perfect permutational symmetry is preserved (i.e., formally the evolution is constrained to the subspace with largest Casimir operator eigenvalue). The other permutationally completely symmetric states of this subspace with M large and m small excitations can be obtained by acting with the collective raising operators on the vacuum state |M ;m\u3009 \u221d (Jh+)M (Jc+)m |0; 0\u3009. This generates e.g. the state with N small and no large excitations |0;N\u3009 = |1 . . . 1\u3009 and the state with N large and no small excitations |N ; 0\u3009 = |2 . . . 2\u3009, and many others in between, see Fig. 1 right panel and App. C for detailed examples. In particular, the states in this subspace are non-degenerate and thereby [2] their populations obey a Pauli-type rate equation of the form\nP\u0307Mm = \u2211 M \u2032m\u2032 RMm,M \u2032m\u2032PM \u2032m\u2032\n\u2212 \u2211 M \u2032m\u2032 RM \u2032m\u2032,MmPMm , (8)\nwhere PMm \u2261 \u3008M ;m| \u03c1 |M ;m\u3009 and the transition rate from |M \u2032;m\u2032\u3009 to |M ;m\u3009 is given by RMm,M \u2032m\u2032 = \u2211 \u03bd [ \u03b3\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008M ;m| J\u0302\u03bd\u2212 |M \u2032;m\u2032\u3009\u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u03b3\u03bd(\u2212\u2126\u03bd)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008M ;m| J\u0302\u03bd+ |M \u2032;m\u2032\u3009\u2223\u2223\u22232] \u2265 0. This rate equation can be directly obtained by evaluating (6) in the fully symmetric basis |M ;m\u3009, see App. D 3 for details. As\nPauli rate equations can be obtained from microscopically derived LGKS equations in special cases (they\nalways result for non-degenerate H\u0302S , here applied to isolated subspaces), they also obey their favorable properties, manifest e.g. in the fact that the rates for every reservoir respect local detailed balance [57]. To obtain the coefficients in Eq. (8), we require the action of the collective ladder operators in the symmetric subspace, compare Fig. 1 right panel. They can be evaluated by representing the symmetric subspace with two bosonic modes by means of a generalized Holstein-Primakoff transform, see App. E, which yields\nJ\u0302h+ |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a (N \u2212M \u2212m)(M + 1) |M + 1;m\u3009 ,\nJ\u0302c+ |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a (N \u2212M \u2212m)(m+ 1) |M ;m+ 1\u3009 ,\nJ\u0302w+ |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a (M + 1)m |M + 1;m\u2212 1\u3009 ,\nJ\u0302h\u2212 |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a (N \u2212M \u2212m+ 1)M |M \u2212 1;m\u3009 ,\nJ\u0302c\u2212 |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a (N \u2212M \u2212m+ 1)m |M ;m\u2212 1\u3009 ,\nJ\u0302w\u2212 |M ;m\u3009 = \u221a M(m+ 1) |M \u2212 1;m+ 1\u3009 . (9)\nKeeping m = 0 and M = jz + N/2 for J\u0302 h \u00b1, or keeping M = 0 and m = jz+N/2 for J\u0302 c \u00b1, or keeping M+m = N and M \u2212 m = 2jz for J\u0302w\u00b1 , we see that the transitions along the red or blue or green triangle facets in Fig. 1 right panel, respectively, precisely reproduce the usual su(2) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the Dicke states with j = N/2. Accordingly, our model also includes the Dicke superradiant relaxation of two-level systems [9, 10, 58] if we couple only to one reservoir. These ClebschGordan coefficients are largest when jz = 0 (i.e., for one green/red/blue bath, they become maximal in the middle of the respective green/red/blue triangle facet in Fig. 1 right panel). Accordingly, triangles where all coefficients are large havem \u2248M \u2248 N/3. In Fig. 1 right panel, such a central cycle is marked (shaded), and our main findings are based on the properties of these most productive cycles.\nFinally, we also use a coarse-grained rate equation [59] valid for infinite temperatures of the work reservoir nw(\u2206\u2212 \u03b4)\u2192\u221e (see App. D 4 for details)\nQ\u0307n = \u2211 n\u2032 Rcgnn\u2032Qn\u2032 \u2212 \u2211 n\u2032 Rcgn\u2032nQn ,\nQn = \u2211 M,m PMm\u03b4M+m,n , (10)\nwhere the mesostate probabilities Qn are occupations of states with the total number of n (small and/or large) excitations and \u03b4M+m,n denotes a Kronecker symbol. This reduction is possible because in this limit, the transitions along the green lines in Fig. 1 right panel become dominant, such that all populations connected by green transitions become identical. The non-vanishing coarse-\n4 grained transition rates then become\nRcgn,n+1 = [\u0393c(1 + nc) + \u0393h(1 + nh)] (n+ 1)(N \u2212 n)\n2 ,\nRcgn,n\u22121 = [\u0393cnc + \u0393hnh] (n+ 1)(N + 1\u2212 n)\n2 (11)\nwith \u0393\u03bd \u2261 \u0393\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) and n\u03bd \u2261 n\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) and 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N \u2212 1 in the first and 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N in the second line, respectively. The coarse-grained rate equation provides a tremendous reduction of complexity by mapping our system for nw \u2192\u221e to a tri-diagonal rate equation, and we provide analytic solutions for the cooling current in App. D 4.\nWe are dominantly aiming at the steady-state solutions to Eqns.

(13)\nTogether with the inherent assumption \u03b2c > \u03b2h > \u03b2w, this defines an operational cooling regime. Due to the tight-coupling, we only quantify the cooling current below.\nOur main result however is that, within appropriate regimes, the collective features of our model can support a quadratic scaling of the stationary cooling current with the number of qutrits N , see Fig. 2. There, we approach the problem with methods of different complexity like the full Redfield treatment, the LGKS treatment, the rate equation treatment, and the coarsegrained rate equation treatment. We see that all methods coincide for the case N = 1 (bottom left), where a simple rate equation treatment is sufficient (see App. A).

In App. H we emphasize the quantum nature of this effect. This is seen both in LGKS (orange and green filled symbols) and Redfield (orange and green hollow symbols) approaches. The perfect agreement of LGKS and Redfield approaches (solid versus hollow symbols) demonstrates that in the considered weak-coupling regime, the effect is not just a consequence of the secular approximation. Furthermore, for collective couplings we also see that the cooling current in the fully symmetric subspace (orange symbols, generated with ladder operators from state (7)) is larger than than that originating from a subspace with second largest Casimir operator eigenvalue (green symbols), which we constructed by acting with collective ladder operators J\u0302\u03bd\u00b1 on the representative state\n|\u03a8rep\u3009 = 1\u221a N\n[ ei2\u03c00/N |0 . . . 01\u3009+ ei2\u03c01/N |0 . . . 010\u3009\n+ . . .+ ei2\u03c0(N\u22121)/N |10 . . . 0\u3009 ] , (14)\nuntil no new orthogonal vectors were found (analogous to the discussion in App. C).\nAs one may expect for quantum features, the quadratic boost is fragile in some aspects: First, we observe for large N a crossover to linear scaling (filled orange circles and blue triangles), which we can link to the fact that for fixed temperatures and increasing\n5 N , the most productive cycles with m \u2248 M \u2248 N/3 are no longer populated significantly (insets display stationary populations for N = 8 and N = 80). Similiar inhibitions of superradiant behaviour for large N have been observed elsewhere [18, 60]. For the limit of an infinitely hot work reservoir (blue triangles), this can even be understood analytically (dashed magenta curves, see App. D 4). Second, a more severe restriction appears when we relax the assumption of collective couplings by allowing for random phases in the coupling operators (red symbols). Then, the Liouvillian no longer decouples the subspaces of different Casimir operator eigenvalues, and already for weak deviations from the col-\nlective limit, the steady-state current no longer scales quadratically. In this limit, the steady state is close to a product of single-qutrit states, see App. H, such that major parts of the steady state populate less productive subspaces. When the deviations from the collective limit are small, at least two time scales will emerge: A fast one describes the evolution within the subspaces of constant Casimir operator eigenvalue, and the slow one(s) will describe the leakage between the subspaces of different Casimir operator eigenvalues. Thus, initializing the working fluid in a permutationally symmetric state like |0; 0\u3009 and operating the device only for a finite time, between these two time scales, may sufficiently populate states near |N/3;N/3\u3009 and then still yield a quantum boost. However, to stabilize the quantum enhancement at steady state and to resist small perturbations, fine-tuned interactions may be required, as exemplified at the end of this section.\nTo analyze the device from the thermodynamic perspective, we note that LGKS and the derived rate equations are thermodynamically fully consistent. At steady state, the first law just implies that the stationary energy currents add to zero \u2211 \u03bd I\u0304 \u03bd E = 0 \u2013 see Eq. (12), and the second law implies that the stationary irreversible entropy production rate is non-negative \u03c3\u0304i = \u2212 \u2211 \u03bd \u03b2\u03bd I\u0304 \u03bd E \u2265 0 [56]. As specifically in the symmetric subspace the currents are tightly coupled (12), the coefficient of performance of the device is given by \u03ba \u2261 I\u0304 c E\nI\u0304wE \u0398(I\u0304cE) = \u03b4 \u2206\u2212\u03b4\u0398(I\u0304 c E). One can check that in\nthe regions of cooling functionality (I\u0304cE > 0), the coefficient of performance is bound by its Carnot value via the condition that \u03c3\u0304i \u2265 0. Tighter bounds can be obtained by considering the thermodynamic uncertainty relation [61\u201363]\n\u03c3\u0304i S\u0304I\u03bdE\n(I\u0304\u03bdE) 2 \u2265 2 . (15)\nUsing that all currents are tightly coupled, we use it to lower-bound the fluctuations for e.g. the cooling current as\nS\u0304IcE \u2265 \u03b4I\u0304cE\n\u03b2h\u2206\u2212 \u03b2c\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2w(\u2206\u2212 \u03b4) , (16)\nwhich proves that the fluctuations inherit the superextensive scaling of the current (if present). As the\nFIG. 3. Contour plot of the symmetric subspace cooling current for N = 6 vs. inverse dimensionless temperatures of hot \u03b4\u03b2h and cold \u03b4\u03b2c reservoirs. Cooling is achieved in the region bounded by the outer solid lines which represent condition (13). Parameters: \u0393c = \u0393h = \u0393w, \u2206 = 10\u03b4, solid contours: nw = 100, dashed contours: nw \u2192\u221e.\nFIG. 4. Contour plot analogous to Fig. 3 but showing the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (15) in the cooling region. Parameters as in Fig. 3.\neigenvalues of the Pauli rate equation cannot scale faster than N2, we also find that the fluctuations cannot grow faster than N2. Therefore, the relative fluctuations [64]\u221a S\u0304IcE/I\u0304 c E are also affected by this bound. Numerically, we find that the fluctuations approximately follow the scaling of the current. Then, it follows that these are suppressed strongest in the regime of quadratic current and noise scaling. Due to the tight-coupling relations (12), we found the relative fluctuations to be alike for all reservoirs [65].\nThus, if in practice one would like a device with a large cooling power, a look at Fig. 3 suggests that our device should be operated at \u03b2c ' \u03b2h. Likewise, one would would like to have a device with a small product of relative fluctuations and overall entropy production, as quantified by the uncertainty quotient (15). We find that this quotient is smallest at the other boundary of the cooling region, where \u03b2c / \u03b2h\u2206\u03b4 \u2212\u03b2w \u2206\u2212\u03b4 \u03b4 , see Fig. 4. Thus, our model recovers the usual trade-off between accuracy and performance.\nBy adding specifically taylored interactions to the sys-\n6 m\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8 10\nM 0246810\nE/\u03b4\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\nFIG. 5. Visualization of H\u0302S + \u2206H\u0302S for N = 10 and within the maximally symmetric subspace. The bottom plane depicts the energy landscape in absence of a penalty Hamiltonian, and the energetically most favorable triangle (red) is at lowest excitation numbers. The curved surface demonstrates the minimal penalization of the most productive triangle (blue), the plane defined by it is parallel to the plane without interactions. Parameters: \u2206 = 10\u03b4, \u03b1P = 20\u03b4 (the curved surface has been shifted upwards for clarity).\ntem, we can energetically favor the maximally symmetric subspace and also the cycle with the maximum current. One example for such an interaction could be\n\u2206H\u0302S = \u03b1C\n[ N(N + 3)\n3 \u2212 C\u03022\n] + \u03b1P [( N\n3 \u2212 N\u0302\u2206 )2 + ( N\n3 \u2212 N\u0302\u03b4\n)2 + ( N\n3 \u2212 N\u0302\u2206\n)( N\n3 \u2212 N\u0302\u03b4 )] (17)\nwith coefficients \u03b1C > 0 and \u03b1P > 0 penalizing the deviation from the maximum Casimir sector and the central triangle, respectively (all operators in square brackets are positive semidefinite). For the case where N = 3k+ 1 with integer k (for other configurations one may adapt the penalty Hamiltonian accordingly), the three states of the maximum symmetry sector |k; k\u3009, |k; k + 1\u3009, and |k + 1; k\u3009 have the same minimal energy penalty, see the blue triangle in Fig. 5. Therefore, it cancels out in the difference of energies, and the corresponding transition rates are the same as without any interaction. Provided that the energy penalty is strong enough \u03b2\u03bd\u03b1C/P 1, the other states with larger energy penalties can be omitted from the considerations, and we obtain the current for a single QAR as discussed\nin Eq. (A1) but with boosted rates \u0393\u03bd \u2192 \u0393\u03bd ( (N+2) 3 )2 , which results from the enhanced Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (9) in the central cycle.

As we scale all coupling constants, the fluctuations (and all higher cumulants) would increase likewise, such that both I\u0304cE \u221d N2 and S\u0304IcE \u221d N 2."

            "text": "We analyzed an ensemble of N identical qutrits for its suitability as a QAR using different approaches. The most striking effect is a quadratic scaling of the output (cooling current) with the number of qutrits for a permutationally symmetric configuration and collective system-reservoir couplings. This collective phenomenon can be understood analogously to Dicke superradiant decay of two level systems \u2013 here put to use in an engine by collective couplings. In contrast to quantum computers subjected to decoherence, the performance of the QAR is only reduced to linear (classical) scaling for too large N (changing other parameters may increase the critical size) or for a not-perfectly-collective coupling. For non-identical qutrits we would expect a similar breakdown [66]. Compared to a qubit implementation [46], we want to summarize some advantages of collective qutrits: First, the initialization in the proper subspace requires just a permutationally symmetric state (no entangled states like in [46]) as e.g. |0 . . . 0\u3009. Second, to see the speedup, we do not require fine-tuned inter-qutrit interactions (although this can be used to stabilize the setup against perturbations). Third, in contrast to the interacting qubit system, the (non-interacting) multi-qutrit system only provides three transition frequencies, such that a selective driving appears easier to implement.\nOn the technical side, we have confirmed the effect with a variety of methods. Using a bosonization technique is helpful to compute the transition rates analytically. While the behaviour of the collective limit can be well understood with analytic approximations and allowed us to treat fairly large systems, treating the noncollective limit requires significant resources. We have benchmarked our results with considering also the nonLGKS Redfield master equation. We found that LGKS and Redfield results did not differ much in the considered weak-coupling regime. Beyond stronger systemreservoir coupling strengths, one may also expect larger deviations outside the tight-coupling regime, where the reservoirs no longer drive the individual transitions.\nAs an outlook, we think it could be interesting to consider laser-driven QARs [67, 68] or investigate the fluctuations of energy currents beyond the tight-coupling regime [69] or for detuned levels [70] in greater detail. One may also be tempted to address the strong-coupling regime beyond phenomenologic models [71], e.g. using\n7 reaction coordinates [72]. This however should be performed while maintaining a lower spectral bound on the global Hamiltonian for all coupling strengths and N , in this case we expect modifiations to Eq. (1) [49]."

            "text": "For the case of a single qutrit N = 1 one may derive a rate equation ~\u0307P = R~P for the occupation probabilities ~P = (P0, P1, P2) T of these states (Redfield, LGKS, and Pauli rate equations then yield the same dynamics for these probabilities). For the normal configuration shown in Fig. 1 bottom left panel, where the cold reservoir drives transitions between the lowest two states |0\u3009 \u2194 |1\u3009, the hot between lowest and highest |0\u3009 \u2194 |2\u3009, and the work reservoir transitions between the two excited states |1\u3009 \u2194 |2\u3009, the rate matrix becomes R+ =  R+00 \u0393c(1 + nc) \u0393h(1 + nh)\u0393cnc R+11 \u0393w(1 + nw) \u0393hnh \u0393wnw R + 22  , (A1) where n\u03bd \u2261 n\u03bd(\u2126\u03bd) and the negative diagonal elements are fixed by demanding vanishing of the column sums (this implements overall probability conservation). In the rate matrix, we can clearly distinguish the contributions of the individual reservoirs. From this, the energy current entering from, for example, the cold reservoir can be obtained by standard techniques: One may compute the current via IcE(t) = \u2211 ij(Ei \u2212 Ej)R + ij,cPj(t), where R+c = R +|\u0393h=\u0393w=0 is the cold reservoir rate matrix. Alternatively, one may introduce energy counting fields R+ \u2192 R+(\u03c7) by replacing \u0393c(1 + nc) \u2192 \u0393c(1 + nc)e \u2212i\u03b4\u03c7 and \u0393cnc \u2192 \u0393cnce+i\u03b4\u03c7 in the offdiagonal elements of the rate matrix and compute the current via IcE(t) = \u2212i(1, 1, 1)(\u2202\u03c7R+(\u03c7))|\u03c7=0 ~P (t), see also App. F. With this formalism, it is possible to compute also higher cumulants of the distribution of energy transfers [73]. In the limit of nw \u2192 \u221e, the long-term (stationary) current reduces to I\u0304c,\u221eE+ = \u0393c\u0393h\u03b4(nc \u2212 nh) \u0393c(1 + 3nc) + \u0393h(1 + 3nh) . (A2) For the case where cold and work reservoir are exchanged E0 = 0, E1 = \u2206\u2212 \u03b4, E2 = \u2206 depicted in Fig. 1 top left panel, the rate matrix is given by\nR\u2212 =  R\u221200 \u0393w(1 + nw) \u0393h(1 + nh)\u0393wnw R\u221211 \u0393c(1 + nc) \u0393hnh \u0393cnc R \u2212 22  , (A3)\n10\nand an analogous calculation leads in the case of nw \u2192 \u221e to a slightly different cooling current\nI\u0304c,\u221eE\u2212 = \u0393c\u0393h\u03b4(nc \u2212 nh)\n\u0393c(2 + 3nc) + \u0393h(2 + 3nh) . (A4)\nBoth currents have the same cooling condition\nnc > nh \u21d4 \u03b2c < \u03b2h\u2206/\u03b4 , (A5)\nwhich \u2013 together with \u03b2c > \u03b2h \u2013 defines an operational window for cooling the coldest reservoir. This is a sufficient and necessary condition for nw \u2192\u221e and N = 1.\nFor finite nw, the calculations are a bit lengthier but fully analogous. One obtains for both configurations the sufficient and necessary cooling condition\n\u03b2w(\u2206\u2212 \u03b4) + \u03b2c\u03b4 < \u03b2h\u2206 , (A6)\nwhich reduces to the previous condition as \u03b2w \u2192 0. Together with the underlying assumption \u03b2c > \u03b2h, this defines the bounds on the window of cooling also for larger N (compare Fig. 3 in the main text)."

Depending on the initial condition, this strongly reduces the Hilbert space dimension that needs to be treated explicitly. For example, assuming that our system is prepared e.g. in the collective ground state (7), we can constrain ourselves to the subspace of (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 permutationally symmetric states, which is significantly less demanding than treating 3N basis states [74, 75].\nWe label these states analogously to the maximum angular momentum Dicke states (known from collective two-level systems) by |M ;m\u3009 with 0 \u2264 M large and 0 \u2264 m small excitations such that 0 \u2264 M + m \u2264 N , specific examples are provided in App. C. These states are eigenstates of N\u0302\u2206 and N\u0302\u03b4 (or alternatively J\u03023 and J\u03028) and the Casimir operators, in particular we have\nN\u0302\u2206 |M ;m\u3009 = M |M ;m\u3009 , N\u0302\u03b4 |M ;m\u3009 = m |M ;m\u3009 , J\u03023 |M ;m\u3009 = [ M \u2212m\n2\n] |M ;m\u3009 ,\nJ\u03028 |M ;m\u3009 =\n[\u221a 3\n2 (M +m)\u2212 N\u221a\n3\n] |M ;m\u3009 ,\nC\u03022 |M ;m\u3009 = N(N + 3)\n3 |M ;m\u3009 ,\nC\u03023 |M ;m\u3009 = N(N + 3)(2N + 3)\n18 |M ;m\u3009 .

We have two additional states with exactly one small and one large excitation that are orthogonal to |1; 1\u3009, J\u0302h+ |\u03a811\u3009, J\u0302h+ |\u03a818\u3009 and to each other and having a similar behavior under cyclic permutations. These are\n|\u03a825\u3009 = 1\u221a 6\n[ |201\u3009+ ei\u03c02/3 |012\u3009+ ei\u03c04/3 |120\u3009\n\u2212 |021\u3009 \u2212 ei\u03c02/3 |210\u3009 \u2212 ei\u03c04/3 |102\u3009 ] ,\n|\u03a826\u3009 = 1\u221a 6\n[ |201\u3009+ ei\u03c04/3 |012\u3009+ ei\u03c02/3 |120\u3009\n\u2212 |021\u3009 \u2212 ei\u03c04/3 |210\u3009 \u2212 ei\u03c02/3 |102\u3009 ] . (C8)\nThe first one gets a phase ei2\u03c0/3 under cyclic permutations, the second the phase ei4\u03c0/3. Additionally, one can see that the states J\u0302h+ |\u03a811\u3009, J\u0302h+ |\u03a818\u3009 are symmetric under the state-conditional permutation 0 \u2194 2, whereas the states |\u03a825\u3009 and |\u03a826\u3009 are antisymmetric. One can get to |\u03a825\u3009 e.g. via J\u0302w+ J\u0302c+ |\u03a811\u3009 and subsequent orthonormalization. Analogously, |\u03a826\u3009 can be reached by J\u0302w+ J\u0302 c + |\u03a818\u3009 and subsequent orthonormalization. Thus, the 16 = 2 \u00d7 8 states |\u03a811\u3009 , . . . , |\u03a826\u3009 are closed under the action of a collective reservoir, they have eigenvalues of Casimir operators C\u03022 and C\u03023 of 3 and 0, respectively. In the bosonic four-mode representation |M,m,Q, q\u3009, the 8 states for this Casimir subspace and given behaviour under cyclic permutations can be constructed from the subspaces with Na = 1 and Nb = 1. Formally, the bosonic four-mode representation yields via (M,m), (Q, q) \u2208 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} in total 9 (6 nondegenerate and 3 degenerate) possible states, but one superposition of the three degenerate states |0, 0, 1, 0\u3009, |0, 1, 0, 1\u3009, and |1, 0, 0, 0\u3009 has a different Casimir operator eigenvalue and can be decoupled.\nFinally, the last state is\n|\u03a827\u3009 = 1\u221a 6\n[ |012\u3009+ |120\u3009+ |201\u3009\n\u2212 |021\u3009 \u2212 |210\u3009 \u2212 |102\u3009 ] . (C9)\nIt is annihilated by J\u0302\u03bd\u00b1, has the smallest eigenvalue 0 of both Casimir operators C\u0302i, and is also inert under cyclic permutations. It is fully antisymmetric under the exchange of any two qutrits, and corresponds in the bosonic four-mode representation to the state |0, 0, 0, 0\u3009 with Na = 0 and Nb = 0.\nWe note that in the collective limit, states like |\u03a827\u3009 remain fully inert, they are dark states [76, 77]. From the combinatorics of states, we may expect dark states with m = M = N/3 for any number N divisible by 3. These dark states will then have minimum, i.e., vanish-\ning, Casimir operator eigenvalue \u2329 C\u03022 \u232a = 0. In particu-\nlar, since already the case N = 6 hosts more than one dark state, superpositions of these could be used to form e.g. a decoherence-protected logical qubit in presence of all possible collective system-reservoir interactions."

In the equations above, the functions on the r.h.s. are then the even and odd Fourier transforms of the reservoir correlation functions\n\u03b3\u03bd(\u03c9) = \u222b C\u03bd(\u03c4)e +i\u03c9\u03c4d\u03c4 ,\n\u03c3\u03bd(\u03c9) = \u222b C\u03bd(\u03c4)sgn(\u03c4)e +i\u03c9\u03c4d\u03c4 . (D6)\nThe Lamb-shift parts \u03c3\u03bd(\u00b1\u2126\u03bd) are negligible in comparison to H\u0302S , such that it is common practice to neglect them. Eventually, this transforms Eq. (D3) into Eq. (5) in the main text. The Redfield equation conserves trace and hermiticity, but not necessarily the positivity of the density matrix. For general operators O\u0302 one can rewrite it in terms of expectation values\nd\ndt\n\u2329 O\u0302 \u232a = +i \u2329[ H\u0302S , O\u0302 ]\u232a + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(\u2212\u2126\u03bd) 2 [ \u2329[ S\u0302\u03bd , O\u0302 ] S\u0302\u03bd+\n\u232a + \u2329 S\u0302\u03bd\u2212 [ O\u0302, S\u0302\u03bd\n]\u232a ] + \u2211 \u03bd \u03b3\u03bd(+\u2126\u03bd) 2 [ \u2329[ S\u0302\u03bd , O\u0302 ] S\u0302\u03bd\u2212\n\u232a + \u2329 S\u0302\u03bd+ [ O\u0302, S\u0302\u03bd ]\u232a ] . (D7)\nThus, it is easy to see that the above equation conserves all operators that commute with both H\u0302S and S\u0302 \u03bd , i.e., if [O\u0302, H\u0302S ] = [O\u0302, S\u0302 \u03bd ] = 0, one also has Tr { O\u0302\u03c1\u0307 } = 0.\nThis is the case in the collective limit, where S\u0302\u03bd \u2192 J\u0302\u03bd e.g. for the Casimir operators O\u0302 \u2192 C\u0302i.\nApart from the Lamb-shift terms, the spectral coupling densities of the reservoirs are always evaluated at their transition frequencies \u03b4, \u2206, and \u2206\u2212\u03b4, respectively. Thus, for our calculations in the main text (where the Lamb-shift is neglected), the actual form of the spectral coupling density is not relevant. To confirm that the Lamb-shift contributions are indeed negligible, we employed a special model for the spectral coupling density. Using\n\u0393\u03bd(\u03c9) = \u0393\u03bd \u03c9\n\u03bd \u03b44\u03bd (\u03c92 \u2212 2\u03bd)2 + \u03b44\u03bd , (D8)\nthe correlation function C\u03bd(\u03c4) as well as the Lamb-shift contribution\n\u03c3\u03bd(\u03c9) = i \u03c0 P \u222b \u03b3\u03bd(\u03c9 \u2032) \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u2032 d\u03c9\u2032 (D9)\n14\nmay be computed analytically (but yielding extremely lengthy expressions). To compare with our calculations in the main text, we used resonant reservoirs with c = \u03b4, h = \u2206 and w = \u2206 \u2212 \u03b4 and computed the Redfield current in Fig. 2 with Lamb-shift corrections included (setting \u03b4\u03bd = \u03bd). For the other parameters chosen as in Fig. 2 we found the effects of the Lambshift contributions to be negligible.\nSimilar to the rate equation discussion from App. A, the cold reservoir energy current may now be computed using different options: Taking the view of the system perspective, one may obtain it by computing the system energy balance from (5). The energy current entering from the cold reservoir then becomes\nIcE,S = \u0393cnc 2 Tr { H\u0302S ([ S\u0302c+\u03c1, S\u0302 c ] + [ S\u0302c, \u03c1S\u0302c\u2212 ])} (D10)\n+ \u0393c(1 + nc) 2 Tr { H\u0302S ([ S\u0302c, \u03c1S\u0302c+ ] + [ S\u0302c\u2212\u03c1, S\u0302 c ])} ,\nand analogously for the other reservoirs. Alternatively, we may microscopically derive energy counting fields [53, 78, 79], which takes the perspective of energy leaving the reservoir and yields a tilted Liouvillian L \u2192 L(\u03c7). In Eq. (5) in the main text, this would effectively lead to\nthe replacements ([ S\u0302c, \u03c1S\u0302c+ ] + [ S\u0302c\u2212\u03c1, S\u0302 c ])\n\u2192( S\u0302c\u03c1S\u0302c+e \u2212i\u03b4\u03c7 + S\u0302c\u2212\u03c1S\u0302 ce\u2212i\u03b4\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c1S\u0302c+S\u0302c \u2212 S\u0302cS\u0302c\u2212\u03c1 ) and\nthe analogous one ([ S\u0302c+\u03c1, S\u0302 c ] + [ S\u0302c, \u03c1S\u0302c\u2212 ]) \u2192(\nS\u0302c+\u03c1S\u0302 ce+i\u03b4\u03c7 + S\u0302c\u03c1S\u0302c\u2212e +i\u03b4\u03c7 \u2212 S\u0302cS\u0302c+\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1S\u0302c\u2212S\u0302c ) . The\ncurrent (and noise) can then be computed by the methods in App. F. This yields for the current leaving the cold reservoir\nIcE = \u2212 \u0393c\u03b4(1 + nc) 2 Tr { S\u0302c\u03c1S\u0302c+ + S\u0302 c \u2212\u03c1S\u0302 c }\n+ \u0393c\u03b4nc 2 Tr { S\u0302c+\u03c1S\u0302 c + S\u0302c\u03c1S\u0302c\u2212 } . (D11)\nIn general, we have I\u03bdE 6= I\u03bdE,S for the Redfield equation. Moreover, while by construction the stationary currents for the system add to zero \u2211 \u03bd I\u0304 \u03bd E,S = 0, this is only approximately true in the Redfield approach for the energy currents leaving the reservoir. In Fig. 7 we plot the sum of energy currents leaving the reservoirs (i.e., the deviation from the first law at steady state) versus the coupling strengths to the reservoirs (assumed equal). One can see that the deviation from energy conservation becomes smaller when the coupling strength is reduced. Moreover, it scales with \u03932 (the Redfield approach is accurate to order \u0393), such this apparent violation can be considered a truncation artifact and does not indicate a violation of the first law in the weak-coupling regime, where for our model Redfield and LGKS solutions agree."

As a sanity check, we remark that for N = 1, the proper coarse-grained rates (which one gets by applying an analogous procedure to the rate matrices in Sec. A) for a single QAR are reproduced. We note that the resulting effective rates for cold and hot reservoir no longer obey local detailed balance, which allows energy\n17\nto flow out of the cold reservoir. The simple tri-diagonal form of this effective rate equation has the advantage that the stationary state can be computed analytically, since it obeys\nQ\u0304n = Rcgn,n\u22121 Rcgn\u22121,n Rcgn\u22121,n\u22122 Rcgn\u22122,n\u22121 \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 Rcg1,0 Rcg0,1 Q\u03040 , \u2211 n Q\u0304n = 1 .\n(D28)\nMaking the ratios explicit with (11), we can determine Q\u03040 from the normalization condition and from that write the stationary cooling current with n\u0304 = \u0393cnc+\u0393hnh\u0393c+\u0393h and \u03b1n\u0304 = n\u0304 n\u0304+1 and R c ij \u2261 R cg ij |\u0393h\u21920\nI\u0304cE = \u03b4 N\u2211 n=1 Rcn,n\u22121Q\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 \u03b4 N\u22121\u2211 n=0 Rcn,n+1Q\u0304n+1\n= \u0393c\u03b4\n2 N\u2211 n=0 [ (n+ 2)(N \u2212 n)nc\n\u2212 n(N \u2212 n+ 1)(1 + nc) ] Q\u0304n\n= \u0393c\u0393h\u03b4\n2(\u0393c + \u0393h) (nc \u2212 nh)fN (n\u0304) ,\nfN (n\u0304) \u2261 gN (n\u0304) + \u03b1\nN+1 n\u0304 hN (n\u0304)\nn\u0304+ 1\u2212 \u03b1N+1n\u0304 [2 + n\u0304+N ] ,\ngN (n\u0304) \u2261 2(N \u2212 3n\u0304)(n\u0304+ 1) , hN (n\u0304) \u2261 N2 + (5 + 4n\u0304)N + 6(n\u0304+ 1)2 . (D29)\nIn the current, only the term (nc \u2212 nh) can turn negative, such that we recover the original cooling condition for nw \u2192 \u221e given in (A5). Apart from that, the scaling factor fN (n\u0304) > 0 can be analyzed for various limits: First of all, we have f1(n\u0304) = 2 1+3n\u0304 , which yields the same current as (A2). Second, for very large N n\u0304, we can drop the terms with powers of \u03b1n\u0304 < 1, such that fN (n\u0304)\u2192 2N , and the current eventually will scale just linearly I\u0304cE \u2248 \u0393c\u0393h\u03b4 \u0393c+\u0393h\n(nc \u2212 nh)N . Third, for N n\u0304 we have fN (n\u0304) \u2192 N(N+3)6n\u0304 , and we maintain a quadratic scaling for the current I\u0304cE \u2248 \u0393c\u0393h\u03b4(nc\u2212nh) 12(\u0393cnc+\u0393hnh) N(N + 3). The crossover system size N\u2217 between these regimes can be found by simply equating the limits and yields N\u2217 = 12n\u0304 \u2212 3. These limits can be seen well in Fig. 2 (dashed magenta curves). The crossover between two scaling regimes is thus quite analogous to previous results for collective qubit systems [60]. We can see that the current becomes maximal when nh \u2192 0 (which can be reached by \u2206 \u2192 \u221e and then implies nc \u2192 \u0393c+\u0393h\u0393c n\u0304). Then, we can numerically maximize (nc\u2212nh)fN (n\u0304)\u2192 \u0393c+\u0393h\u0393c n\u0304fN (n\u0304) as a function of n\u0304 only. The position of this maximum is for large N roughly at n\u0304 \u2248 N/6, and the current scales quadratically in N at this maximum."
