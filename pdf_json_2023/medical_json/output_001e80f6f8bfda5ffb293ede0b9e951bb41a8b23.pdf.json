    "abstractText": "The work aims to study the economical losses of the condemnation of bovine and buffalo carcasses, in order to estimate the losses in animals slaughtered in Santar\u00e9m-Par\u00e1, Brazil, between 2016 and 2018, with data obtained from the Municipal Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Sex, age, origin, total number of animals slaughtered and causes of condemnation of carcasses were considered. All analyzes were performed in RStudio version 1.1.463. In this study, 71,277 bovine carcasses and 2,016 buffalo carcasses were inspected, of which 300 bovine and 71 buffalo were condemned. The highest prevalence of causes of condemnation in cattle was recorded for brucellosis (0.0020%) and tuberculosis (0.0019%). In buffaloes, tuberculosis (0.0307%) peritonitis (0,0019%) were the main causes of condemnations. Economical losses were more evident in females, for both species. The projection of economical losses related to the condemnation of carcasses showed a sharp growth for the next three years, if the average growth remains constant. The biggest projected loss was for bovine females, with an accumulated projection of $ 5,451.44. The smallest estimated loss was for buffalo males, projected at more than thirty-two thousand reais. The most important causes of condemnation report the diseases brucellosis and tuberculosis, as the ones with the greatest impact. In the buffalo species this was even more accentuated, even though the number of buffaloes slaughtered is more than 35 times smaller than the number of cattle.

Sex, age, origin, total number of animals slaughtered and causes of condem-\nnation of carcasses were considered. All analyzes were performed in RStudio version\n1.1.463. In this study, 71,277 bovine carcasses and 2,016 buffalo carcasses were\ninspected, of which 300 bovine and 71 buffalo were condemned. The highest prevalence of\ncauses of condemnation in cattle was recorded for brucellosis (0.0020%) and tuberculosis\n(0.0019%). In buffaloes, tuberculosis (0.0307%) peritonitis (0,0019%) were the main causes\nof condemnations. Economical losses were more evident in females, for both species. The\nprojection of economical losses related to the condemnation of carcasses showed a sharp\ngrowth for the next three years, if the average growth remains constant. The biggest pro-\njected loss was for bovine females, with an accumulated projection of $ 5,451.44. The small-\nest estimated loss was for buffalo males, projected at more than thirty-two thousand reais.\nThe most important causes of condemnation report the diseases brucellosis and tuberculo-\nsis, as the ones with the greatest impact. In the buffalo species this was even more accentu-\nated, even though the number of buffaloes slaughtered is more than 35 times smaller than\nthe number of cattle.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285224 May 4, 2023 1 / 15\nCitation: Silva WCd, Camargo RNC, Ju\u0301nior, Silva E\u0301BRd, Silva JARd, Picanc\u0327o MLR, Santos MRPd, et al.

Some animals can be carriers of zoonotic diseases, which can cause public health problems and generate economical losses in slaughterhouses, due to the condemnation of carcasses [4\u20137].\nAmong the main diseases that affect bovine and buffalo herds, tuberculosis [8] and brucel-\nlosis, which cause considerable economic losses [9]. The northern region of Brazil, especially the state of Para\u0301, has the largest buffalo herd and the fifth largest cattle herd [10].\nRegarding the demand, population projections point out rapid and continuous growth in\nthe upcoming decades, which should increase food demand in general [11]. According to a report by the United Nations Population Division, it is estimated that the world\u2019s population will reach about 8.5 billion by 2030, and for an even greater increase of about ten billion by 2050 [12].\nIn this context, it is essential that, in agricultural production, there is an amount of quality,\nhealthy food, given that they need the sustainable use of scarce agricultural resources [13]. Livestock activity plays an important role in food safety, which is considered a valuable resource and a source of wealth [14].\nMeat inspection in slaughterhouses, plays an important role in preventing the transmission\nof parasitic diseases as well as of those transmitted from animals to humans. In addition, slaughterhouse data regarding the condemnation of organs and carcasses can be analyzed to verify the rate of food waste (meat) and financial losses, due to diseases and failures in technological processing during slaughtering [15]. Based on this information, the objective of this work was to study the economic losses arising from the condemnation of bovine and buffalo carcasses, in order to estimate their future damage, in animals slaughtered in Santare\u0301m, Para\u0301, Brazil."

[21], who identified a higher occurrence of tuberculosis in bovine females (87.6%) and buffaloes (71.4%). Females are more likely to contract the disease. This can be explained by the fact that females are more likely to contract the disease, because they normally spend more time in the herd and, consequently, suffer greater exposure to the agent [22]. On the other hand, the excessive slaughter of matrices and the subsequent increase of young animals in the herd may reflect in the decrease in the number of calves [23]. Thus,"

In a study carried out by Oliveira et al. [26] a prevalence of 0.003% was identified in the carcasses of cattle affected by tuberculosis in the state of Maranh\u00e3o. Lopez et al. [27] identified a prevalence of 0.00087% in the state of Rondo\u0302nia due to tuberculosis.\nWhen related to age, it was identified that more than half (55.1%) of the animals were older\nthan seven years, which can be explained by the chronic nature of the disease, especially in older animals. Pereira et al. [28] identified that the largest number of positive bovines and buffaloes were older than seven years, followed by younger animals aged 0 to three years, as these young animals may have acquired the disease through the ingestion of milk and/or contaminated colostrum [29].\nBrucellosis was one of the main causes of condemnation in cattle, also evidenced to a lesser\nextent, cases of condemnation in buffaloes [30]. This disease has been reported in several countries [31\u201335], with the main means of contamination in cattle, the digestive, as well as it is contracted during the breeding period, both by natural mating, but especially by artificial\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285224 May 4, 2023 9 / 15\ninsemination [36]. It is noteworthy that the proliferation of the epidemiological agent in ruminants occurs mainly through infected females, with or without the presence of a previous history of abortion [37, 38]. In this way, the slaughter of females on a large scale is a worrying factor, since it may provide the livestock industry with a reduction in the production of calves.\nA prevalence of 0.002% was found, a lower rate than that reported by Sousa et al. [39], who\nfound a 1,19% prevalence of brucellosis in cattle in the state of Maranh\u00e3o, Brazil. In a study carried out by Freitas and Oliveira [38], the prevalence of bovine brucellosis was 0.099%, much higher when compared to the results found in the present study, while Roma et al. [34] identified a lower prevalence of 0.001% [42/23.963].\nCarcass condemnation by hematoma was evidenced in cattle and absent in buffaloes, possibly as a result of bad habits in the transport of cattle, such as acceleration, sudden braking during access to poorly planned highways, which affect a series of injuries to the animal, by falling of cattle inside the truck and lack of proper direction by the driver [40]. In addition, other animals trample them, causing bruises on a large part of the body. The removal of injured meat parts was on average 0.3 kg of discarded meat per carcass. These results are similar to those described contrary to the average described by Melo et al. [41], with a loss of 2.33 kg, with a total loss of 1,143.8 kg, in 490 animals. When comparing batches of cattle transported on paved and unpaved roads, the occurrence of a higher rate of injuries in animals transported on unpaved roads over long distances is noticeable [42].\nCachexia is a disease that is associated with the popular tuberculosis, becoming a determining factor in the total condemnation of the carcass [16]. Similar results were obtained by Yibar et al. [43], who verified the prevalence of tuberculosis and cachexia as one of the main causes of condemnation.\nThe clinical signs of cachexia manifested in bovines is one of the reasons for condemna-\ntions, as established by RIISPOA in Art. 113, paragraph 2. Cachexia is characterized as complex, and not easily defined, being considered a metabolic syndrome, consisting of progressive weight loss [44, 45].\nInjury rates are associated with inadequate handling of cattle, whether in loading, trans-\nporting or unloading. The greater number of wounds in the rear regions of cattle, which affect the quality of the meat, is possibly due to the use of inappropriate objects, such as shock sticks and pointed pieces, while driving the animals [45\u201347]. During loading and unloading, the lack of training of employees can cause disordered movement in animals, as well as stress [48\u201350], which which favors the appearance of injuries [51\u201353].\nIn a study carried out in California, the presence of peritonitis was identified as one of the\ncauses of the increase in condemnation of contaminated carcasses. For White et al. [54] and Dupuy et al. [55], the emergence of these condemnations may be the result of certain aspects in all parts of the production chain, such as environmental conditions, management, stress and accommodation of pathogens in bovine animals. Corroborating the reports by Bassuino et al. [56], who describe peritonitis as a very evident disease in production animals, although little known by most rural owners.\nIt is noteworthy that in the region where this study was developed, it is common for slaugh-\nterhouses to receive animals from neighboring municipalities. Therefore, it is important to clarify to producers the main causes of condemnation of carcasses and to draw their attention to the damage resulting from this practice. All of this will encourage the tracking of sick animals at source, in addition to mitigating management practices that may promote condemnation of carcasses.\nOn the other hand, contamination of carcasses is identified as one of the forms of condem-\nnation. The main causes of condemnation of carcasses are related to diseases, in about 57%, especially tuberculosis [10] and brucellosis [35, 57].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285224 May 4, 2023 10 / 15\nAnother possible means of contamination is the incorrect washing of the animals, as it\ndumps external impurities adhered to the skin, in addition to cleaning the anus and extremities region, to avoid contamination of the carcasses in later stages [58]. According to Picchi [59], in addition to the fur, the flow of blood clots in the carcass cavities contributes to the proliferation of microorganisms, which demonstrates the importance of washing the carcass, as one of the forms of elimination for possible contamination foci.\nIn relation to economical losses, it was evident that they presented expressive values in this\nstudy. The paucity of studies in this area is highlighted and this is even worse when it comes to research carried out in the Southwest Paraense and Lower Amazon Mesoregions.\nTherefore, the work developed by Dourado et al. [10] deserves attention, where a loss\ncaused by tuberculosis in cattle was observed, in the order of $ 50,638.96, of which approximately 58% resulted from the condemnation of females.\nFrom another perspective, still in relation to the damage caused by post-mortem condem-\nnation in cattle developed in the region of this research, there is the work of Pereira et al. [15], which alleges economic loss of $ 41,116.30 subsequent to the condemnation of tongue, liver and heart, for several causes. On the other hand, unfortunately, there were no studies with buffaloes, making it impossible to compare data.\nIt is noteworthy that there are no studies estimating financial projections for losses due to carcass condemnation in cattle and buffaloes. Thus, this investigation proved to be a pioneer for this methodology and for this reason there are no data on this aspect that can be compared with the results obtained in this investigation."

Among the protagonists responsible for the worsening of the damage, the diseases brucellosis and tuberculosis stand out. This forecast may even discourage the slaughter of buffaloes, perhaps even the beef buffalo culture. In this way, more important than quantifying the economic damage, it is to work towards mitigating the expected losses in the short term, because from the knowledge of factors causing damage, the more assertive the strategy can be to minimize their impacts or even avoid them."
