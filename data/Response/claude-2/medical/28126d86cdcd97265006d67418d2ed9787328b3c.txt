 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on cardiac image segmentation:

1. Investigate different encoder-decoder architectures besides SqueezeNet and ResNet for the ROI localization and segmentation stages. This could potentially improve accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

2. Explore attention mechanisms beyond spatial attention, such as channel and depthwise attention, to focus on relevant features. This may further improve the handling of fuzzy edges.

3. Evaluate the framework on additional cardiac MRI datasets, such as from other challenges or clinical sites, to further demonstrate generalization. 

4. Extend the framework to do full 3D segmentation rather than slice-by-slice 2D, which could improve continuity.

5. Modify the framework to jointly segment additional structures beyond the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle, like the atria or great vessels. This could provide a more comprehensive analysis.
