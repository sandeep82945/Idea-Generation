    "abstractText": "Cosmological evolution of axion field in the early universe might be significantly affected by a thermal friction induced by the axion coupling to thermalized hidden sector. We examine the effects of such a thermal friction on axion dark matter density and its perturbation when the thermal friction dominates over the Hubble friction until when the axion field begins to oscillate around the potential minimum. We show that in the presence of sizable thermal friction there can be an exponential decay phase of the axion field before the oscillation phase, during which the axion energy density is efficiently dissipated into hidden thermal bath. Consequently, the previously excluded parameter region due to overclosing relic axion density becomes cosmologically viable with thermal friction. In particular, a QCD axion much lighter than \u03bceV is viable without tuning the initial misalignment angle. We also find that thermal friction can affect the density perturbation of axion dark matter in various ways. For instance, it can alleviate the large-scale isocurvature bound on axion dark matter in the pre-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, which would make the pre-inflationary axion dark matter compatible with high scale inflation over a wide range of model parameters. In the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, thermal friction can also significantly change the scaling behavior of axionic strings, and therefore the typical size of the resultant axion miniclusters.",

            "text": "The QCD axion is among the most compelling candidates for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). It solves the strong CP problem [1\u20133] and provides a natural candidate for cold dark matter [4\u20136]. Similar particles, dubbed axion-like particles (ALPs), are ubiquitous in string theory [8, 9], some of which can be identified as ultralight dark matter with a broad mass range and interesting cosmological consequences [7, 10, 11]. Usually the abundance of axion dark matter is determined by the axion mass and decay constant depending upon the cosmological epoch when the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking takes place [7, 12]. Axions can have a sizable interaction with a thermal system in the early universe. Such an interaction can make freeze-in production of axions if the interaction rate is weaker than the Hubble expansion rate, while it thermalizes axions in the other case that the interaction rate is greater than the Hubble expansion rate [13\u201316]. The interaction with a thermal system can also give rise to an intriguing influence to the dynamics of the classical axion field through the form of macroscopic friction [17]. Possible effects of thermal friction on the dynamics of axion field have been studied before in the context of warm inflation [18\u201321], axionic dark energy [22], axionic early dark energy which may ameliorate the H0 tension [23], and electroweak baryogenesis by axion dark matter [24]. In this work we explore the influence of thermal friction on the abundance of axion dark matter and also on the axion density perturbation. We will show that in the strong friction limit there is an exponential decay phase in the cosmological axion field evolution before the axion starts to oscillate around the potential minimum. During this phase the axion energy density is efficiently dissipated into a thermal bath, and the resultant axion dark matter density is significantly reduced compared with the conventional cosmological scenarios\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwithout thermal friction.1 This decay phase has been partially studied in different contexts including early dark energy [23] and electroweak baryogenesis by axion dark matter [24]. Here we provide approximate analytic solutions for the axion field evolution in the presence of significant thermal friction in order to study its impact on axion dark matter density. The thermal friction-induced exponential decay of the axion field allows for instance a QCD axion much lighter than \u00b5eV to be cosmologically viable without tuning the initial misalignment angle in the pre-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, and also a QCD axion much lighter than 0.1meV to be viable in the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario. We also find that thermal friction can significantly affect the density perturbation of axion dark matter in various ways. For instance, it can alleviate the large-scale isocurvature bound on axion dark matter in the pre-inflationary PQ breaking scenario. It also suppresses the power spectrum of axion density perturbation at small scales below a certain scale determined by the axion mass when the axion field underwent an exponential decay. Moreover it turns off various resonance effects which can be present in the absence of thermal friction. In the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, on the other hand, the thermal friction keeps the random axion field values in a scale even smaller than the horizon size. Thus it changes the scaling behavior of the axionic strings, making the strings to be present by O(1) population in a scale significantly smaller than the horizon size. As a consequence, the typical axion minicluster size is to be smaller than the conventional one for a given axion mass. For the QCD axion, combined with the fact that the thermal friction allows a larger decay constant well above 1010 GeV in the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, the axion minicluster size can be much greater than the expected size in the conventional axion cosmology of negligible thermal friction. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss cosmological axion field dynamics in the presence of strong thermal friction in a general context and examine its impact on axion dark matter density. In section 3, we pay attention to the implications on the QCD axion dark matter. In section 4, we discuss constraints and cosmological implications arising from the involved hidden thermal sector. In section 5, we study thermal friction effect on the density perturbation of axion dark matter. Section 6 is for summary and conclusions."

            "text": "Generic axion field may have a sizable interaction with hidden thermal system realized in the early universe. As a concrete example for thermalized hidden sector, we will consider SU(N) Yang-Mills (YM) gauge fields without charged fermions.2 (For other examples, see\n1See e.g. [25] for an alternative scenario where the axion abundance is significantly modified due to interaction with a light hidden sector.\n2In the presence of SU(N)-charged fermion lighter than about \u03b12hTh, the sphaleron transitions generating thermal friction for the axion field are suppressed due to the energy cost for producing light fermions, where Th is the temperature of the thermalized hidden YM sector [17, 22, 24]. Thus we will assume that there is no light SU(N)-charged fermion. This also means that the QCD gluon fields would not be able to make a significant thermal effect on the evolution of axion field because of the light quarks.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\ne.g. [18].) The relevant part of lagrangian for the axion field \u03c6 is given by\nL \u2283 \u221212\u2202 \u00b5\u03c6\u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2212 V (\u03c6) + \u03b1h 8\u03c0 \u03c6 fh G\u00b5\u03bdah G\u0303 a h\u00b5\u03bd , (2.1)\nwhere Gah\u00b5\u03bd are the hidden YM field strengths, G\u0303a\u00b5\u03bd = 12 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3G a\u03c1\u03c3 h are their duals, \u03b1h = g2h 4\u03c0 is the hidden YM fine structure constant, and the scale fh characterizes the interaction strength of the axion to the hidden YM fields. For homogeneous and isotropic background, the axion field obeys the equation of motion:\n\u03c6\u0308+ 3H\u03c6\u0307+ V \u2032(\u03c6) = \u2212 \u03b1h8\u03c0fh \u3008G\u00b5\u03bdah G\u0303 a h\u00b5\u03bd\u3009, (2.2)\nwhere the dot denotes time-derivative, the prime is the partial derivative with respect to \u03c6, H is the Hubble expansion rate, and \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 is the thermal average of the quantity. The thermal average of the hidden YM operator GG\u0303 gives rise to a friction term for the axion field dynamics by sphaleron processes [17, 22]:\n\u03b1h 8\u03c0fh \u3008G\u00b5\u03bdah G\u0303 a h\u00b5\u03bd\u3009 = \u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u0307+ . . . (2.3)\nwith\n\u03b3\u03c6 \u223c (N\u03b1h)5 T 3h f2h . (2.4)\nHere Th is the temperature of the thermalized hidden sector, and the ellipsis stands for other terms which can be safely ignored in our discussion.3 In the following we will parameterize \u03b3\u03c6 as\n\u03b3\u03c6 \u2261 \u03be T 3\nf2h (2.5)\nwith a dimensionless coefficient \u03be given by\n\u03be \u223c (N\u03b1h)5 ( Th T )3 , (2.6)\nwhere T is the temperature of the dominant radiation component of the universe. In this work, we will assume that the parameter \u03be is nearly a constant, which would be justified if the energy density of the axion field is negligible compared to that of the hidden thermal sector. Later we will show that this is a valid assumption in reasonable parameter space. We also ignore the running of \u03b1h which would result in logarithmic-dependence of \u03b1h on the temperature. As we will discuss later, this is justified as far as we are concerned with the thermal friction effect on the axion field evolution, since the thermal friction affects the axion density mostly near the time when the axion field begins to oscillate. As for the axion potential, we will consider a cosine potential whose temperaturedependence can be parameterized as\nV (\u03c6) = m 2 0f 2 1 + (T/\u039b\u03c6)b ( 1\u2212 cos \u03c6 f ) , (2.7)\n3It includes for instance the potential induced by the hidden YM instantons, which can be easily made to be negligible compared to V (\u03c6) in eq. (2.1). This point will be discussed in section 4.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwhere m0 is the axion mass at zero-temperature, \u039b\u03c6 is a dynamical scale around which this axion potential is generated by certain dynamics, and b is a constant. Around its minimum, the potential can be approximated by the quadratic term with temperature-dependent axion mass\nm2\u03c6(T ) \u2261 m20\n1 + (T/\u039b\u03c6)b . (2.8)\nIn the early universe the thermal friction \u03b3\u03c6 can be larger than the Hubble rate H, because \u03b3\u03c6 \u221d a\u22123, while H \u221d a\u22123(1+w)/2, where a is the scale factor of the expanding universe, and w is defined by the equation of state of the universe p = w\u03c1 with the total energy density \u03c1 and the total pressure p. Moreover, in the early universe, the thermal friction \u03b3\u03c6 can also be greater than the axion mass m\u03c6. Using the quadratic approximation for the axion potential, solution to eq. (2.2) during this period (i.e. \u03b3\u03c6 H,m\u03c6) is found to be\n\u03c6(t) 'f\u03b8i exp ( \u2212 13(3 + w)/2 + \u03b2(t) m2\u03c6(t) \u03b3\u03c6(t)H(t) ) \u00d7 [ 1 +O ( m2\u03c6/\u03b3 2 \u03c6, H/\u03b3\u03c6, \u03b2\u0307/H ) ] (\u03b3\u03c6 H,m\u03c6),\n(2.9)\nwhere\n\u03c6i \u2261 f\u03b8i (2.10)\nis the initial value of the axion field and\n\u03b2(t) \u2261 \u2212T \u2202 lnm2\u03c6 \u2202T = b1 + (\u039b\u03c6/T )b . (2.11)\nThe velocity of the axion field during this overdamping phase turns out to be\n\u03c6\u0307 ' \u2212 m2\u03c6 \u03b3\u03c6 \u03c6. (2.12)\nThis shows that the axion field begins to move substantially when \u03b3\u03c6H drops below m2\u03c6 as the temperature decreases. As the universe further cools down, thermal friction eventually becomes smaller than the axion mass, and then the axion starts to oscillate around the potential minimum. For this period (i.e. m\u03c6 & \u03b3\u03c6, H), we find that approximate solution to eq. (2.2) is given by\n\u03c6(t) ' \u03c61 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1 + ( \u03c6\u03071 m1\u03c61 )2( m1 m\u03c6(t) )1/2\n\u00d7 exp ( \u2212 13(1\u2212 w) \u03b31 H1 [ 1\u2212 ( a1 a ) 3 2 (1\u2212w) ])\n\u00d7 ( a1 a )3/2 cos (\u222b t t1 dt\u2032m\u03c6(t\u2032)\u2212 tan\u22121 \u03c6\u03071 m1\u03c61 ) \u00d7 [ 1 +O ( \u03b32\u03c6/m 2 \u03c6, H 2/m2\u03c6 ) ] (m\u03c6 & \u03b3\u03c6, H),\n(2.13)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwhere t1 denotes the starting time of the oscillation, which is defined by\nm\u03c6(t1) = Amax(\u03b3\u03c6(t1), 3H(t1)) (2.14)\nfor some constant A \u223c O(1), and a is the scale factor of the expanding universe. The subscript 1 means that the corresponding quantity is evaluated at t = t1, for instance\nm1 \u2261 m\u03c6(t1), \u03b31 \u2261 \u03b3\u03c6(t1), \u03c61 \u2261 \u03c6(t1). (2.15)\nFor the solutions eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.13), we have assumed \u03b3\u03c6 \u221d a\u22123. If we take into account the logarithmic temperature-dependence of \u03b1h, \u03b3\u03c6 also logarithmically depends on the scale factor a as\nd ln \u03b3\u03c6 d ln a = \u22123 + \u03b6(t),\n(2.16)\nwhere\n\u03b6(t) ' 55N6\u03c0 \u03b1h(t) \u223c g 2 h(t) (2.17)\nfor hidden SU(N) YM gauge fields. It can be shown that this changes the exponential factors in eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.13) as\nexp ( \u2212 13(3 + w)/2 + \u03b2(t) m2\u03c6(t) \u03b3\u03c6(t)H(t) )\n\u2192 exp ( \u2212 13(3 + w)/2 + \u03b2(t)\u2212 \u03b6(t) m2\u03c6(t) \u03b3\u03c6(t)H(t) ) (2.18)\nand\nexp ( \u2212 13(1\u2212 w) \u03b31 H1 [ 1\u2212 ( a1 a ) 3 2 (1\u2212w) ])\n\u2192 exp ( \u2212 13(1\u2212 w)\u2212 2\u03b6 \u03b31 H1 [ 1\u2212 ( a1 a ) 3 2 (1\u2212w)\u2212\u03b6 ]) .\n(2.19)\nThis shows that the effects of the logarithmic running of \u03b1h on the axion field evolution can be ignored if g2h(t) 1, which can be assumed in our case since the hidden YM confinement occurs at a later time than the period when the thermal friction is active. Even when g2h = O(1) over the relevant period, the effects due to the changes (2.18) and (2.19) can be absorbed into a factor of few change of fh (note that \u03b3\u03c6 \u221d f\u22122h ), and it does not make a qualitative change of the result. We will thus ignore the logarithmic temperature dependence of \u03b1h in the following discussions. The solutions eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.13) also tell us that the thermal friction effect on the axion field amplitude is mostly determined around t = t1 within a few e-folds. Therefore, only the value of \u03be \u221d \u03b15h near t = t1 will be relevant for our discussion, and the gauge coupling running effect on \u03be can be ignored.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nThe solution eq. (2.13) is valid when t > t1. For the thermal friction to make a substantial difference for axion cosmology compared to the conventional scenario with \u03b3\u03c6 \u2248 0, the Hubble friction has to be smaller than the thermal friction at t = t1:\n\u03b31 > 3H1, (2.20)\nwhich will be assumed in the following discussions. Otherwise, \u03b3\u03c6H > m2\u03c6 before the thermal friction falls below the Hubble expansion rate, so that the axion field nearly doesn\u2019t move (see eq. (2.9), and afterward the thermal friction becomes negligible compared with the Hubble rate. Thus if \u03b31 < 3H1, the axion dynamics is essentially the same as the conventional scenario. Let us now discuss how to connect the solution eq. (2.9) for the regime m\u03c6 & \u03b3\u03c6 to the solution eq. (2.13) for the opposite regime m\u03c6 \u03b3\u03c6. For the case when eq. (2.20) is satisfied, which is the case of our concern, the two solutions can be connected at t = t1 defined by\nm1 ' A\u03b31 (2.21)\nfor a constant A \u223c O(1) whose precise value can be determined numerically. The field values \u03c61 and \u03c6\u03071 in eq. (2.13) are determined from the previous overdamping phase with eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.12):\n\u03c61 ' f\u03b8i exp ( \u2212 A 2\n3(3 + w1)/2 + \u03b21 \u03b31 H1\n) , (2.22)\n\u03c6\u03071 ' \u2212Am1\u03c61. (2.23)\nIf the universe is radiation-dominated at t = t1, i.e. w1 = 1/3, the exponent in eq. (2.22) can be determined as\n\u03b31 H1 = 3 \u03c0\n\u221a 10\ng\u2217(T1) \u03be MP f2h T1 (2.24)\nwith the temperature T1 at the onset of axion oscillation, which is given by\nT1 ' m20f4h\u039b\u03b21\u03c6 A2\u03be2 1/(6+\u03b21) (2.25) from the condition (2.21). In figure 1, we depict the cosmological axion field evolution when the thermal friction is strong enough to satisfy eq. (2.20), connecting the solutions eq. (2.9) and eq.

Cosmological axion field evolution in the presence of sizable thermal friction. Blue is the numerical solution to the axion equation of motion, and Red is the approximate analytic solution given in eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.13). Here for the analytic solution, we take A ' 1.0 to get the best fit line. a represents the scale factor, and a1 is its value at the time when axion field begins to oscillate. At the beginning of the oscillation, \u03b31/H1 ' 19 which determines the suppression of the axion field due to thermal friction afterward (see eq. (2.13)). Before the oscillation, the axion field already moves substantially in the Hubble time in contrast to the conventional scenario of negligible thermal friction. For the parameter set in this figure, axion abundance coincides with the observed dark matter abundance: fh ' 2.7 \u00d7 106 GeV, \u03be = 10\u22127, f = 1016 GeV, m\u03c6 = 0.1 eV, g\u2217(T1) = 106.75, \u03b8i = 1 and T1 ' 2 TeV.\nFor t t1, we then find\n\u03c1\u03c6 ' 1 2(1 +A 2)m1m\u03c6\u03c621e\u22122\u03b31/3(1\u2212w)H1 ( a1 a )3 (2.28)\n\u3008p\u03c6\u3009t ' 0, (2.29)\nwhere \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009t denotes time-average over an oscillation period. It shows that eventually the axion energy density behaves like matter, i.e. \u03c1\u03c6 \u221d a\u22123 once m\u03c6(t) ' m0, and therefore the axion can be identified as a cold dark matter. Let us now examine the implications of the thermal friction on axion dark matter abundance. The axion dark matter density is determined by eq. (2.28) with eq. (2.22):\n\u03c1\u03c6 ' m1m\u03c6f2\u03b82i ( a1 a )3 exp ( \u22127 + \u03b215 + \u03b21 \u03b31 H1 ) , (2.30)\nwhere we assume radiation domination at t = t1 and A ' 1. In terms of \u2126\u03c6h2 = \u03c1\u03c6h2/\u03c1c with the critical density \u03c1c, the abundance of the axion dark matter in the present universe is estimated as\n\u2126\u03c6h2 ' 0.1\u03b82i ( \u03be 10\u22127 )( m0 0.1eV )( f 1016 GeV )2 ( 106.75 g\u2217s(T1) )\n\u00d7 (\n2.8\u00d7 106 GeV fh\n)2( e\u2212(7+\u03b21)\u03b31/(5+\u03b21)H1\n10\u221211\n) ,\n(2.31)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwhere h \u2261 H0/(100 km/s/Mpc), and H0 is the Hubble expansion rate at the present time. Note that the above expression holds only for \u03b31 > 3H1, and therefore is not valid in the limit when the thermal friction is turned off. If the axion mass is independent of temperature (b = \u03b2 = 0), \u03b31/H1 is estimated from eq. (2.24) as\n\u03b31 H1 ' 18\n( \u03be 10\u22127 )2/3 ( m\u03c6 0.1eV )1/3(2.8\u00d7 106 GeV fh )4/3 (106.75 g\u2217(T1) )1/2 . (2.32)\nFrom eq. (2.31) and eq. (2.32), we see that the axion dark matter abundance is exponentially sensitive to the axion coupling f\u22121h for a given axion mass m\u03c6. For the case b = \u03b2 = 0, the temperature at the onset of the axion oscillation is given by eq. (2.25),\nT1 ' 2 TeV (\n10\u22127 \u03be\n)1/3 ( m\u03c6\n0.1eV )1/3 ( fh 2.8\u00d7 106 GeV )2/3 . (2.33)\nA crucial feature of the thermal friction dominated scenario defined by eq. (2.20) is a hierarchy between the two axion scales, f which would define the axion coupling to the dynamics generating the dominant axion potential V (\u03c6) as eq. (2.7) and fh which defines the axion coupling to the hidden YM sector as eq. (2.1). From eq. (2.31), one can derive\nf\nfh ' 104 \u03b8\u22121i exp ( (7 + \u03b21) 2(5 + \u03b21) \u03b31 H1 )[(0.1eV m0 )(10\u22127 \u03be )( g\u2217s(T1) 106.75 )(\u2126\u03c6h2 0.1 )]1/2 , (2.34)\nwhich tells us that f has to be much greater than fh to explain the observed dark matter abundance by the axion when thermal friction effect is important as \u03b31 > 3H1, unless the axion is heavier than MeV. Such a large hierarchy may need an explanation, e.g. the clockwork mechanism [26\u201328]. It may be instructive to compare the axion dark matter density in the presence of the thermal friction with that in the conventional scenario in which the Hubble friction dominates over other sources of friction. In the conventional scenario, the onset time of the oscillation tconv1 is determined by the condition\n3H(tconv1 ) ' mconv1 (2.35)\nwith mconv1 \u2261 m\u03c6(tconv1 ), which implies\ntconv1 = 3 2(m conv 1 )\u22121 (2.36)\nin the radiation-dominated era with the resulting axion dark matter density\n\u03c1conv\u03c6 = 1 2m conv 1 m\u03c6(t)f2\u03b82i ( tconv1 t )3/2 . (2.37)\nComparing this with eq. (2.30), one can find\n\u03c1\u03c6 ' 2\u03c1conv\u03c6 exp ( \u22122(7 + \u03b21)(5 + \u03b21) m1t1 )( m1 mconv1 )(2 3m conv 1 t1 )3/2 \u03c1conv\u03c6 , (2.38)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwhere m1 > mconv1 and mconv1 t1 > 3/2 since the axion oscillation is delayed due to the thermal friction. It shows that in our scenario \u03c1\u03c6 is always smaller than \u03c1conv\u03c6 for the same m\u03c6 and f\u03b8i, and exponentially suppressed in the limit m1t1 1, although the thermal friction delays the axion oscillation. Finally let us discuss the consistency of the assumption that the parameter \u03be in eq. (2.6) is nearly a constant. The hidden thermal bath actually can get a significant energy density from the axion sector. The hidden thermal bath energy density \u03c1h evolves according to [22, 23]\n\u03c1\u0307h + 4H\u03c1h = \u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u03072. (2.39)\nA sufficient condition for the axion feedback to the hidden bath is negligible would be\n\u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 2 4H\u03c1h, (2.40)\nwhere\n\u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 2 \u223c (m 4 \u03c6/\u03b3\u03c6)\u03c62 for \u03b3\u03c6 > m\u03c6\n\u03b3\u03c6m 2 \u03c6\u03c6 2 for \u03b3\u03c6 . m\u03c6 (2.41)\nfrom eq. (2.12) and eq. (2.13). The solutions eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.13) also tell us that \u03c6 is exponentially decreasing within a single Hubble time once m2\u03c6/\u03b3\u03c6 & H until t \u223c t1, while for t t1, \u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u03072 \u221d 1/a6\u2212\u03b2(t)/2 which implies (m0/m\u03c6)\u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u03072 \u221d 1/a6. On the other hand, H\u03c1h \u221d 1/a3(1+w)/2+4 with 3(1 + w)/2 + 4 \u2264 6. Therefore, if (m0/m\u03c6)\u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u03072 (\u2265 \u03b3\u03c6\u03c6\u03072) is smaller than 4H\u03c1h at the time when the axion energy density begins to decrease with m2\u03c6/\u03b3\u03c6 & H, the condition (2.40) is always satisfied. So conservatively we may require\nm0m 3 \u03c6\n\u03b3\u03c6 \u03c62 4H\u03c1h (2.42)\nat t = t\u2217 defined by the condition m2\u03c6(t\u2217) \u03b3\u03c6(t\u2217) = (3(3 + w) 2 + \u03b2 ) H(t\u2217) (2.43)\nfrom eq. (2.9). This requirement corresponds to\nm0m\u2217f 2\u03b82i r4hT 4\u2217 (2.44)\nwhere m\u2217 \u2261 m\u03c6(t\u2217), rh \u2261 Th/T which is assumed to be a constant, and we ignore coefficients of O(1). Assuming radiation domination at t = t\u2217, the condition (2.44) turns out to be equivalent to\nf\nfh 3\u00d7 1012\u03b8\u22125/4i r 5/2 h ( m\u2217 m0 )3/8(10\u22127 \u03be )1/2 ( 1TeV\u221a m0f )1/2 . (2.45)\nIn section 4, we will see that r2h . 0.1 is required from the constraints on dark radiations. For instance, if the axion mass is temperature-independent, that is m\u2217 = m0, one can find that the condition (2.45) is easily satisfied in the axion dark matter parameter space of eq. (2.31) if the height of axion potential \u221a m0f is below TeV. As we will examine in the next section, the QCD axion with a temperature-dependent mass also turns out to easily satisfy the condition (2.45).\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0"

            "text": "A pure hidden Yang-Mills (YM) is perhaps the most straightforward and motivated example for the origin of thermal friction. In this section we discuss constraints and possible cosmological signatures from the hidden SU(N) YM sector assumed in our scenario. The hidden YM gives rise to an axion potential through the YM instanton dynamics as well as the thermal friction through sphaleron processes. We require that the axion potential generated by the hidden YM instantons is small enough so that the axion dynamics discussed so far is not affected. From the above discussion which is briefly summarized in eq. (2.30), one can see that the thermal friction affects the axion dynamics mostly around the onset of axion oscillation with m1 \u223c \u03b31. Therefore a necessary condition is that the contribution from the hidden YM to the axion mass is negligible from the time of axion oscillation. As a conservative condition, we simply require the zero-temperature axion mass from the hidden YM is smaller than the axion mass at the onset of the axion oscillation:\n\u039b2h fh m1, (4.1)\nwhere \u039bh is the confinement scale of the hidden YM. For the QCD axion, on the other hand, a possible shift of the axion field vacuum value due to the additional axion potential induced by the hidden YM dynamics has to be small enough to keep the axion solution to the strong CP problem. This requires that\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u223c \u039b 4 h/fh\nm2\u03c0f 2 \u03c0/f\n. 10\u221210 (4.2)\nwhere \u03b4\u03b8 = \u3008\u03c6\u3009/f is the displacement of the QCD axion potential minimum from the CP conserving point, which has to be smaller than about 10\u221210 by the non-observation of the electric dipole moment of the neutron [29, 30].\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nFor an SU(N) pure YM hidden gauge sector, the confinement scale is\n\u039bh ' \u00b5 exp ( \u2212 6\u03c011N\u03b1h(\u00b5) ) (4.3)\nfor a renormalization scale \u00b5 > \u039bh. Because the value of \u03be \u223c (N\u03b1h)5(Th/T )3 around the onset of axion oscillation is most relevant, we may take\n\u00b5 = Th(t1) \u2261 rhT1, (4.4)\nwhere rh = Th/T is a constant. The condition (4.1) is then translated into a constraint on \u03b1h(t1):\nN\u03b1h(t1) . \u03c0\nln(r2hMP /fh) , (4.5)\nwhere we have assumed \u03b31/H1 . O(10) r2hMP /fh. On the other hand, the condition (4.2) for the QCD axion becomes\nN\u03b1h(t1) . 2\u03c0\nln(r4h1010f/fh) . (4.6)\nIn the interesting parameter space for the QCD axion dark matter in eq.

The ratio rh = Th/T is actually constrained by the dark radiation component made of the hidden gluons and thermalized axions. Currently the most stringent constraint comes from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [31]:\n\u2206Neff = 8 7 (11 4 )4/3 r4h(N2 \u2212 1/2) < 0.124 (4.8)\nFor SU(2) hidden YM, this requires rh . 0.3. The constraint from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurement is currently weaker with \u2206Neff < 0.29 [32]. However, the future CMB-S4 is expected to reach \u2206Neff ' 0.02\u20130.03 [33, 34], and therefore the hidden YM sector assumed in our scenario may give rise to observable dark radiation signatures in future experiments. Alternatively, the hidden YM sector may confine before the matter-radiation equality. Then it gives rise to self-heating hidden glueball dark matter component along with the axion dark matter [35], however this interesting possibility is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0"

As we have discussed so far, the axion dark matter density is exponentially reduced by the thermal friction. On the other hand, we will discuss below that the density contrast of axion dark matter perturbation is maintained except extremely small scales. Consequently, large scale isocurvature bound on axion dark matter is relaxed in pre-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking scenario. Also in the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, axion miniclusters can be formed at different axion mass and coupling scales compared to the conventional scenario.\nIn this section we will denote the spatially homogeneous part of the axion field by \u03c6\u0304(t),\n\u03c6(t,x) = \u03c6\u0304(t) + \u03b4\u03c6(t,x).

Note that we do not specify a gauge choice in eq. (5.2). In the subsequent discussions, we will specify the source terms after fixing the gauge. For the moment, let us ignore the source terms. As we have discussed in section 2, the background field \u03c6\u0304 begins to decay into the hidden thermal bath after t = t\u2217 defined by\nm\u03c6(t\u2217) ' \u221a \u03b3\u03c6(t\u2217)H(t\u2217), (5.3)\nsee eq.

On the other hand, for the perturbation \u03b4\u03c6k, high k-modes with k/a\u2217 m\u2217 begins to decay earlier than the background field because of the effective mass m2eff(k) \u2261 k2/a2 +m2\u03c6 m2\u03c6. Therefore \u03b4\u03c6k/\u03c6\u0304 becomes negligible for the modes with k/a\u2217 m\u2217 for t > t\u2217. On the contrary, for low k-modes with k/a\u2217 . m\u2217, m2eff(k) ' m2\u03c6 for t > t\u2217, and thus \u03b4\u03c6k decays almost in the same way as the background field value \u03c6\u0304 so that \u03b4\u03c6k/\u03c6\u0304 remains constant. The resultant density contrast \u03b4\u03c1\u03c6/\u03c1\u03c6 \u223c \u03b4\u03c6/\u03c6\u0304 will be maintained until gravitational collapse of the axion over-density.

In the present universe the corresponding physical length scale for the comoving wavenumber k = a\u2217m\u2217 is\nz\u2217 m\u2217 ' 1 pc\n( T\u2217\n0.1GeV )(10\u221211eV m\u2217 ) , (5.5)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nwhere z\u2217 + 1 \u2261 a0/a\u2217 with the current scale factor a0. The reference values for T\u2217 and m\u2217 are typical values for the QCD axion. Thus in case of the QCD axion, for example, the density contrast \u03b4\u03c1\u03c6/\u03c1\u03c6 \u223c \u03b4\u03c6/\u03c6\u0304 for large scales greater than 1 pc in the current universe is not diluted by the thermal friction, while the average density \u03c1\u03c6 can be exponentially diluted. On the other hand, axion density contrast at smaller scales may be significantly affected by the thermal friction. For this case, the source terms in eq. (5.2) can be important. In the following subsections, we will discuss these points in detail for different PQ symmetry breaking scenarios."

For small scales with k/a0 > 0.1Mpc\u22121, the isocurvature perturbations of dark matter are not constrained by the CMB data [36]. It has been suggested that the small scale axion isocurvature perturbations can be enhanced by several mechanisms including tachyonic instability [37], parametric resonance [38], and resonance with the radiation fluctuation [39,\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\n40] when the Hubble damping is the dominant source of friction for axion dynamics. Here we examine how the thermal friction would change the picture and affect the growth of small scale perturbations. For the small scale perturbations, the source terms in eq. (5.2) can be important, and they may be classified according to the convention of [40]:\nS1 = \u2212 ( \u03a8\u0307k + 3\u03a6\u0307k ) \u02d9\u0304\u03c6, (5.11) S2 = 2\u03a8km2\u03c6(T )f sin \u03c6\u0304\nf , (5.12)\nS3 = \u2212(\u2202Tm2\u03c6) \u03b4Tkf sin \u03c6\u0304\nf , (5.13)\nS4 = (\u03a8k\u03b3\u03c6 \u2212 (\u2202Th\u03b3\u03c6)(\u03b4Th)k) \u02d9\u0304\u03c6, (5.14)\nwhere \u03b4T and \u03b4Th are the temperature fluctuations of the visible radiation and the hidden radiation, respectively, and the metric perturbations \u03a8 and \u03a6 are defined by\nds2 = \u2212a2(\u03c4) [ (1\u2212 2\u03a8(\u03c4,x)) d\u03c42 \u2212 (1 + 2\u03a6(\u03c4,x)) dx2 ] , (5.15)\nin the conformal Newtonian gauge [41, 42]. Here S1 and S2 are source terms for axion perturbation from gravitational potentials, S3 from the radiation fluctuation via temperaturedependent axion mass, and S4 is a new source term originated from the thermal friction.4\nAssuming that the anisotropic stress of the energy-momentum tensor vanishes, we have\n\u03a8 = \u03a6. (5.16)\nThe analytic solutions for the gravitational potential \u03a6 and the temperature fluctuation \u03b4T in the radiation-dominated era are given by [43]\n\u03a6k = 3(\u03a6k)i sin yk \u2212 yk cos yk\ny3k , (5.17)\n\u03b4Tk T\n= (1\n2 + 1 2y 2 k\n) \u03a6k +\n1 2H \u03a6\u0307k , (5.18)\nwhere (\u03a6k)i is the primordial Newtonian potential, and yk \u2261 k/( \u221a\n3aH).

The left panel represents the case for T -independent axion mass (b = 0), while the right panel is for the QCD axion case. We choose a large initial field perturbation (\u03b4\u03c6\u0302/\u03c6)i = 102 \u221a 2.1\u00d7 10\u22129 to demonstrate the effect of the thermal friction. The solid (dashed) lines represent the evolution of density perturbation with (without) thermal friction. The low-k modes, i.e., k/(a\u2217m\u2217) . 1, maintain their initial amplitudes since m2eff(k) ' m2\u03c6, and the source terms are suppressed [40]. For the high k-modes (red-solid line), i.e., k/(a\u2217m\u2217) 1, due to their large effective masses, \u03b4\u03c6k oscillates prior to the oscillation of the background field \u03c6\u0304. Consequently, the thermal friction renders the initial decay stage of the high-k modes erasing the axion isocurvature power spectrum \u221a Piso. The decay stage is followed by a mild enhancement stage due to the source terms in eq. (5.2), during which \u221a Piso becomes comparable to the curvature perturbation, \u03b4T/T \u223c \u221a Ps. Previous works [39, 40] have pointed out that the terms proportional to \u03b4\u03c6 in eq. (5.23) can be resonantly enhanced by the source term S3 for which the temperature dependence of the axion mass is crucial. We find that such resonance effect is negligible for light QCD axion around neV, where sizable thermal friction is required to explain the dark matter abundance by the QCD axion. The thermal friction increases the width of the resonance, making the resonant amplitude smaller. Furthermore, we have examined the possibility of the parametric resonance which can happen when the initial axion field value is close to the hilltop of the axion potential [37, 38, 40]. In the presence of sizable thermal friction, however, we find such resonant growth is also hindered. This is because the axion field amplitude is quickly damped down to the regime where the non-linear axion self-interaction becomes negligible.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nH E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0"

            "text": "In the post-inflationary scenario, the axion field takes random values over the universe after the PQ phase transition. In the presence of the thermal friction, those random field fluctuations are diluted only for small length scales with k/a & \u221a \u03b3\u03c6H as observed in eq. (5.2) and eq. (2.9), which are smaller than the horizon scale when \u03b3\u03c6 > H. This is essentially because the thermal friction holds the field values by stronger friction than the Hubble damping. Therefore, a global string can exist in the following length scale smaller than the horizon scale:\ndstring \u223c 1/ \u221a \u03b3\u03c6H < 1/H. (5.27)\nIt means the behavior of the scaling solution [44\u201347] for strings is changed due to the thermal friction. The string-wall network is formed and collapses around the time when the background axion field starts to substantially move after t = t\u2217 defined by eq. (5.3).5 Thus O(1) density contrast of the axion dark matter will be formed at the scale kc/a\u2217 \u223c \u221a \u03b3\u2217H\u2217 ' m\u2217 around t = t\u2217. This O(1) density contrast is not diluted by the thermal friction according to the argument given around eq. (5.4), while the average axion density can be exponentially\n5Here we assume the domain wall number NDW = 1. Otherwise the string-wall network can be collapsed long after t = t\u2217 depending on the lifetime of the domain walls.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\ndiluted. If the axion is a dominant component of the total dark matter, the axion clumps are expected to collapse gravitationally prior to matter-radiation equality into small dark matter halos, called axion miniclusters [48\u201350]. The typical axion minicluster size is estimated to be\nrmc . ( aeq a\u2217 ) m\u22121\u2217 (5.28)\nwhere aeq is the scale factor at the matter-radiation equality. This means that the thermal friction makes the minicluster size smaller compared to the conventional scenario for a given axion mass, because the string-wall network collapses later due to stronger friction. For the QCD axion the estimation (5.28) implies an interesting consequence. As we have discussed in section 3, the QCD axion scale f can be much larger than the intermediate scale while explaining the dark matter abundance without a small \u03b8i thanks to the strong damping by the thermal friction. Thus the QCD axion can be far lighter than meV scale even in the post-inflationary scenario without overproducing axion dark matter. According to eq. (5.28) the corresponding axion minicluster size is to be much larger than what is expected in the conventional scenario."

            "text": "Axion field dynamics in the early universe might be significantly affected by interactions with a hidden thermal bath. A well motivated example is an axion coupling to hidden YM gauge fields. The sphaleron processes then give rise to a friction term for the cosmological evolution of axion field. In this work we have examined the influence of such a thermal friction to the abundance of axion dark matter and its density perturbations. Assuming that the energy density of the hidden thermal bath is large enough compared with the axion energy density, the temperature Th of hidden thermal bath is maintained to be proportional to the temperature T of the universe. This gives rise to thermal friction approximately proportional to T 3. We have derived approximate analytic solutions to the equation of motion of the axion field for the case that thermal friction remains to be greater than the Hubble expansion rate until the onset of the axion field oscillation around the potential minimum. Our solutions show that there is an exponential decay phase of the axion field before the axion begins to oscillate. Because of this decay phase, the axion dark matter abundance can be exponentially reduced by the factor \u223c e\u2212\u03b31/H1 , where \u03b31 and H1 denote the thermal friction and the Hubble expansion rate, respectively, when the axion field begins to oscillate. This allows that the model parameter region which would yield an overclosing relic axion mass density in the conventional scenario without thermal friction is cosmologically viable in the presence of thermal friction. In particular, it opens a new parameter space for the QCD axion dark matter with m\u03c6 \u00b5eV without having a fine-tuned initial misalignment angle. The dark radiation formed by hidden gluons and thermalized axions may also result in potentially observable signatures in the future CMB measurements. A crucial ingredient of this scenario is a big hierarchy among the two axion scales, f characterizing the axion coupling to the dynamics generating the dominant axion potential\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 8 0\nand fh characterizing the axion coupling to generate the thermal friction. Such a scale (or coupling) hierarchy might be naturally generated by the clockwork mechanism [26\u201328].\nThermal friction can also make remarkable consequences for the density perturbations of axion dark matter. In the pre-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, the large-scale isocurvature perturbation generated during the early universe inflation experiences the same exponential decay as the average axion field value does. As a consequence, for a given axion dark matter relic density, the isocurvature bound on the inflationary energy scale can be significantly ameliorated in our scenario with strong thermal friction. The thermal friction also suppresses the power spectrum of axion density perturbation at small scales below the scale determined by the axion mass at the onset of the exponential decay. It turns off various resonance effects which can be present in the absence of thermal friction. In the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, on the other hand, the thermal friction keeps the random axion field values in a scale smaller than the horizon size. Thus it changes the scaling behavior of the axionic strings making them to be present by O(1) population in a scale significantly smaller than the horizon size. As a consequence, the typical axion minicluster size is to be smaller than the conventional one for a given axion mass. For the QCD axion, combined with the fact that the thermal friction allows a larger decay constant well above 1010 GeV even in the post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, the axion minicluster size can be much greater than the expected size in the conventional axion cosmology without thermal friction effect."
