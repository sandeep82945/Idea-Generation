    "abstractText": "26 Biofilm formation begins when bacteria contacting a surface induce cellular changes to 27 become better adapted for surface growth. One of the first changes to occur for Pseudomonas 28 aeruginosa after surface contact is an increase in the nucleotide second messenger 3\u2019,5\u2019-cyclic 29 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It has been demonstrated that this increase in intracellular 30 cAMP is dependent on functional Type IV pili (T4P) relaying a signal to the Pil-Chp system, but 31 the mechanism by which this signal is transduced remains poorly understood. Here, we 32 investigate the role of the Type IV pili retraction motor PilT in sensing a surface and relaying 33 that signal to cAMP production. We show that mutations affecting the structure of PilT and in 34 particular ATPase activity of this motor protein, reduce surface-dependent cAMP production. 35 We identify a novel interaction between PilT and PilJ, a member of the Pil-Chp system, and 36 propose a new model whereby P. aeruginosa uses its retraction motor to sense a surface and to 37 relay that signal via PilJ to increased production of cAMP. We discuss these findings in light of 38 current TFP-dependent surface sensing models for P. aeruginosa. 39 40 Importance 41 T4P are cellular appendages that allow P. aeruginosa to sense a surface leading to the 42 production of cAMP. This second messenger not only activates virulence pathways but leads to 43 further surface adaptation and irreversible attachment of cells. Here, we demonstrate the 44 importance of the retraction motor PilT in surface sensing. We also present a new surface 45 sensing model in P. aeruginosa whereby the T4P retraction motor PilT senses and transmits the 46 surface signal, likely via its ATPase domain and interaction with PilJ, to mediate production of 47 the second messenger cAMP. 48 .

            "text": "Biofilm formation begins when bacteria contacting a surface induce cellular changes to 27 become better adapted for surface growth. One of the first changes to occur for Pseudomonas 28 aeruginosa after surface contact is an increase in the nucleotide second messenger 3\u2019,5\u2019-cyclic 29 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It has been demonstrated that this increase in intracellular 30 cAMP is dependent on functional Type IV pili (T4P) relaying a signal to the Pil-Chp system, but 31 the mechanism by which this signal is transduced remains poorly understood. Here, we 32 investigate the role of the Type IV pili retraction motor PilT in sensing a surface and relaying 33 that signal to cAMP production. We show that mutations affecting the structure of PilT and in 34 particular ATPase activity of this motor protein, reduce surface-dependent cAMP production. 35 We identify a novel interaction between PilT and PilJ, a member of the Pil-Chp system, and 36 propose a new model whereby P. aeruginosa uses its retraction motor to sense a surface and to 37 relay that signal via PilJ to increased production of cAMP. We discuss these findings in light of 38 current TFP-dependent surface sensing models for P. aeruginosa. 39 40 Importance 41 T4P are cellular appendages that allow P. aeruginosa to sense a surface leading to the 42 production of cAMP. This second messenger not only activates virulence pathways but leads to 43 further surface adaptation and irreversible attachment of cells. Here, we demonstrate the 44 importance of the retraction motor PilT in surface sensing. We also present a new surface 45 sensing model in P. aeruginosa whereby the T4P retraction motor PilT senses and transmits the 46 surface signal, likely via its ATPase domain and interaction with PilJ, to mediate production of 47 the second messenger cAMP. 48\nIntroduction 49 Biofilm formation is initiated when free swimming, planktonic cells contact a 50 surface. This contact serves as a signal that must be transmitted across the cell envelope 51 into the cytoplasm to initiate appropriate physiological changes to adapt to the biofilm 52 mode of growth (1). For many bacteria this initial surface contact is mediated through 53 motility appendages such as type IV pili (T4P) or flagella (2-8). Contact between these 54 appendages and the surface creates forces that are not normally present in planktonic 55 environments and can serve as a \u201csurface signal\u201d to the microbe (9). 56 Early work in Vibrio parahaemolyticus demonstrated that the signals encountered 57 during surface contact could be mimicked by increasing the load on the flagellum either 58 through changes in viscosity of the medium or by addition of antibodies specific to the 59 flagellum (10, 11). Recent work in Caulobacter crescentus demonstrated that holdfast 60 formation and DNA replication, which normally occurs during surface contact, could be 61 stimulated by increasing the load on Tad pili during retraction. Furthermore, the baseline 62 number of cells with a holdfast without prior pili obstruction was higher in mutants that 63 were unable to rotate their flagellum (2). Others have demonstrated that the flagellar 64 motor itself is able to sense surface contact to trigger c-di-GMP production leading to 65 holdfast synthesis (12). Together, these data indicate that bacteria use their surface 66 appendages to help sense surface engagement and indicate that impeding the motion (i.e., 67 retraction and/or rotation) of these appendages might serve as the proximal signal for 68 surface engagement. 69 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, like other organisms, utilizes T4P as well as its polar 70 flagellum to sense and traverse surfaces (3, 13-16).

In P. aeruginosa PA14, this initial increase in cdG is produced by the 73 diguanylate cyclase SadC and recent work from our lab and others has shown that SadC 74 activity is regulated by both components of the flagellum and the T4P (3, 18). Prior to an 75 increase in cdG, P. aeruginosa PA14 increases levels of another second messenger, 3\u2019,5\u2019-76 cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (15). 77 The surface-dependent increase of cAMP by P. aeruginosa PA14 depends on 78 functional T4P, the Pil-Chp chemotaxis-like system, and the adenylate cyclase CyaB, and to 79 a lesser extent, the adenylate cyclase CyaA. The methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein 80 (MCP) PilJ relays a signal to the kinase ChpA (19). Activation of the system causes ChpA to 81 phosphorylate the response regulator PilG; phosphorylation of PilG as well as FimV and 82 FimL are required to then activate the adenylate cyclases CyaAB to produce cAMP from 83 ATP (20-22). The cAMP binding protein Vfr then binds cAMP and activates genes 84 necessary for further surface adaptation, as well as for virulence (23, 24). 85 Recent work by Yarrington, Limoli and colleagues shows that the PilJ likely detects 86 phenyl soluble modulins via its periplasmic domain as a ligand to trigger signaling, a 87 finding that strongly suggests that PilJ can function like a classic MCP (25). Others have 88 recently uncovered the function of PilG and PilH in twitching motility and surface 89 adaptation (26, 27). In contrast, how surface engagement by T4P triggers cAMP signaling 90 in a PilJ-dependent manner is still an open question. A previous study showed that the 91 ligand binding domain (LBD) of PilJ is not required for surface-dependent cAMP 92 production, although the extent of cAMP induction is significantly reduced relative to the 93 WT (28).

In a recent study from our group, we found that surface pili and surface engagement 101 are required for surface signaling, consistent with previous studies (15, 19, 23, 34, 35). 102 Furthermore, we showed that the ability to retract pili with only enough force to allow 103 phage infection was necessary for surface-dependent, cAMP production. That is, the force 104 required for twitching motility was not necessary for cAMP signaling (29). Since phage 105 susceptibility and the cAMP response both require the retraction motor PilT, we reasoned 106 that PilT may be involved in surface-mediated signal transduction in addition to its role in 107 pilus retraction. 108 To explore the potential role of PilT in surface signaling, we began by characterizing 109 the effect of different PilT mutations on surface dependent cAMP production during biofilm 110 formation. We found that mutations in PilT affecting ATP binding and hydrolysis affected 111 cAMP production. A Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two Hybrid (B2H) screen revealed a 112 novel interaction between PilT and PilJ. We screened for mutant PilT alleles with altered 113 interaction with PilJ, but which retained the ability to perform twitching motility. We 114 report here a strong relationship between the extent of PilT-PilJ interaction for PilT 115 mutants that are defective in ATPase activity and the magnitude of cAMP signaling. We 116 also find a strong relationship between the twitching motility zone size and the extent of 117\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We also identify a mutation in PilT that disrupts its interaction with PilJ 118 in a B2H assay in E. coli that does not appear to perturb signaling in P. aeruginosa, 119 suggesting a possible unappreciated level of complexity in PilT-PilJ signaling. Our data are 120 consistent with a model in which PilT senses a surface through tension on the pilus fiber 121 and relays this signal to modulate cAMP production. 122 123 Results 124 125 PilU levels significantly affect cAMP levels during surface attachment 126 To quantify cAMP levels during surface adaptation, the previously reported PaQa 127 cAMP-responsive transcriptional reporter (4) was integrated onto the chromosome of P. 128 aeruginosa PA14. This reporter is composed two fluorescent proteins, mKate2 and EYFP, 129 under the control of two different promoters, PrpoD and PPaQa, respectively. PPaQa has been 130 shown to be regulated by Vfr in a cAMP dependent manner and an increase in PPaQa-eyfp 131 expression is correlated with an increase in cAMP. PrpoD-mKate2 is used to normalize the 132 EYFP levels for microscopy and used to gate on cells containing the reporter for flow 133 cytometry (4). The PaQa reporter was integrated onto the chromosome at a neutral site of 134 the P. aeruginosa PA14 chromosome using the mini-CTX1 system (4, 36). We validated this 135 PaQa reporter using a mutant that is defective in cAMP production (\u2206cyaAB) and a mutant 136 lacking the phosphodiesterase that degrades cAMP (\u2206cpdA), which results in over-137 production of cAMP (Figure S1A,B). After gating on single cells with PrpoD-mKate signal 138 (gating cells with a ECD-A value of 1000 RFU or greater), the mean EYFP intensity was recorded 139 and normalized to the WT signal. As expected, the \u2206cyaAB mutant showed reduced levels 140\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

PilU is the accessory retraction motor for T4P in P. aeruginosa, whose function is 145 dependent on the presence of PilT (37, 38). Both PilT and PilU hydrolyze ATP to power 146 retraction but only PilT can interact with the platform protein PilC to coordinate PilA 147 disassembly from extended T4P (32, 38). While PilT alone is able to retract pili bound to 148 phage (as judged by phage sensitivity assays), PilU is required for T4P retraction that can 149 pull the cell body along a surface to power twitching motility (TM) (14, 29, 30). 150 To better understand the respective contributions of PilT and PilU to surface-151 mediated cAMP production, we used single and double mutants and a series of phenotypic 152 assays. The absence of PilT phenocopies a \u2206pilT\u2206pilU double mutant in terms of TM, phage 153 susceptibility and cAMP response (Figures 1A,B; and as reported previously by our group 154 (29)). In contrast, a \u2206pilU strain retains phage susceptibility due to the presence of PilT but 155 shows an increase in surface-dependent cAMP response (Figure 1A,B; and as reported (15, 156 29, 33, 37-40)). Given that PilU is the only T4P protein whose deletion increases the level 157 of surface-dependent cAMP and that this motor can only exert effects through PilT, we 158 reasoned that PilT may be directly sensing the surface and relaying this signal to the Pil-159 Chp system, a model we probe in more detail below. 160 As mentioned above, PilT appears capable of retracting T4P under low loads like 161 that of a phage bound to the pilus, but is unable to power twitching motility, which requires 162 ATP hydrolysis from both PilT and PilU (37).

This PilT signaling model 166 makes several predictions. First, a \u2206pilU strain should show increased cAMP but only on a 167 surface, a finding we have reported previously (15, 29, 39) and shown here (Figure 1B). 168 Also, overexpression of PilU (a condition that is the opposite of deleting the pilU gene) 169 should suppress the cAMP response. 170 To test this second prediction, we created the pilU expression plasmid, pVLT31-171 PTAC-pilU, and transformed this construct into the WT and \u2206pilU mutant backgrounds with 172 the PaQa reporter on the chromosome. cAMP was measured via flow cytometry with pilU 173 expressed from a multi-copy plasmid for surface-grown bacteria (Figure 1C). Western 174 blots were performed confirming excess PilU accumulation in all the analyzed strains 175 (Figure 1D). All strains harboring the pilU overexpression construct had cAMP levels 176 significantly lower than those with the vector control even in the absence of inducer. In the 177 WT background, excess PilU significantly reduced the amount of cAMP when grown on a 178 surface and the addition of inducer modestly further reduced the level of cAMP. The trends 179 observed in the WT background were also observed in the \u2206pilU mutant background. 180 Interestingly, the level of cAMP production in the WT and \u2206pilU backgrounds with the PilU 181 construct were both significantly reduced from WT but not significantly different from each 182 other. This observed decrease in surface-dependent cAMP is consistent with a model of 183 PilT acting as a signaling protein during surface contact. 184 To determine whether the increase in cAMP production in the \u2206pilU background 185 was due to improper ATP hydrolysis during retraction, we expressed PilT-K136A (this 186\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

PilT-K136A is unable to bind ATP and we hypothesized that the 188 incorporation of this monomer into the functional hexamer would lead to hexameric 189 conformations similar to those that occur for the WT PilT during pilus retraction in absence 190 of PilU. We observed a non-significant increase in cAMP in strains containing the PilT- 191 K136A expression vector relative the empty vector control for the WT background (Figure 192 S2, first 3 bars). This negative result is difficult to interpret because we do not know if the 193 mutant protein is indeed incorporated into the motor. 194 195 Mutations in PilT change the dynamics of surface-dependent cAMP induction 196 We previously showed that mutating critical residues in the Walker A and Walker B 197 boxes of PilT, which abolish ATP binding and hydrolysis, respectively, also disrupt the 198 surface-dependent cAMP response (29, 41). To investigate the role of PilT in surface 199 sensing, these mutations, as well as other previously published mutations in the PilT 200 protein of P. aeruginosa that affect the protein\u2019s hexameric structure or retraction 201 dynamics (32, 33, 42, 43), were inserted into the genome of P. aeruginosa PA14 at the 202 gene\u2019s native locus with the PaQa cAMP reporter on the chromosome at the neutral attB 203 site. A list of mutations tested here with their characteristics, either previously published 204 or determined in this report, are summarized in Table 1 and mapped onto the PilT protein 205 structure (Figure 2A). 206 For these mutants, we assessed protein stability, twitching motility, phage 207 susceptibility and levels of cAMP when grown on a surface. The stability of each allele was 208 assessed via Western blot and quantified by densitometry (Figure 2B).

We also observed a significant decrease in the level of the protein with the 211 PilT-H229A variant. The other alleles result in PilT levels that were reduced, but not 212 significantly, relative to the level of the WT . The discrepancy in protein stability for some 213 alleles could be due to the fact that previous reports used inducible promoters to express 214 pilT on multi-copy plasmids and/or perhaps due to the fact the experiments were 215 performed in the PAO1 strain (32, 33, 43). Here we produce PilT from a single copy with 216 the gene\u2019s native promoter to preserve endogenous regulation during surface sensing, and 217 furthermore, to not perturb levels of PilU as the pilU gene is located directly downstream of 218 the pilT gene. 219 To characterize the effects of these mutations on pilus retraction we performed 220 twitching motility (TM) and phage susceptibility assays (Figure 2C). Twitching motility 221 requires a fully functional PilT and PilU, while phage susceptibility requires only PilT (29, 222 44, 45). Despite the decrease in the level of the PilT proteins as measured by Western blot, 223 all of the indicated PilT variants phenocopied previously published results in terms of 224 twitching motility and phage susceptibility. Mutations that prevent ATP binding or 225 hydrolysis (K136A, E204A; indicated in green) are unable to power TM but remain phage 226 susceptible due to the presence of a functional PilU (29, 37). Mutating the first histidine in 227 the His-box reduced TM while mutating the second histidine completely abolished TM 228 (H222A, H229A; indicated in magenta and blue, respectively), however both alleles 229 maintained phage susceptibility (32, 33).

The average normalized fluorescent intensity per cell was 236 plotted over time for cells harboring the PaQa reporter on the chromosome (2)(Figure 3A, 237 Figure S3). All backgrounds initially start at the same level of intracellular cAMP (i.e., the 238 lower levels associated with planktonic cells) and then begin to differ significantly for 239 measured cAMP level within the first two hours. Throughout the time course, the \u2206pilT 240\n(Figure 3A) and Walker box mutants (WA, PilT-K136A and WB, PilT-E204A; Figure 3A, 241 Figure S3) maintained the lowest levels of cAMP. A strain carrying the PilT-D31K mutation 242 (Figure S3) peaked early and then decreased after three hours of growth. The H229A allele 243 maintained an intermediate level of cAMP relative to the other mutants. The remaining 244 PilT alleles converged with the WT allele around hour 3 and maintained this trajectory 245 until the end of the experiment although their cAMP levels differed from WT at most time 246 points (Figure 3A, Figure S3). 247 We noted that every genetic background that was unable to perform TM showed 248 reduced levels of cAMP relative to WT (Figure 3B), with the exception of the \u2206pilU mutant 249\nas shown above; this mutant background showed an increase in cAMP (Figure 1B) and as 250 previously reported (15, 29, 39). cAMP was lowest in backgrounds that lacked the pilT 251 gene followed by strains that expressed the Walker A (WA, PilT-K136A) and Walker B (WB, 252 PilT-E204A) alleles of PilT. The PilT-D31K mutation resulted in a decrease in twitch zone 253 and slight decrease in cAMP levels compared to that of WT.

PilT-K58A, H222A, and 255 T216R mutants displayed TM and cAMP not significantly different from WT. 256 As a control we measured cAMP levels in liquid grown cultures in the absence of a 257 surface, all strains carrying these pilT alleles were not significantly different from the WT. 258 As an additional control we grew the \u2206cpdA mutant planktonically as well and it displayed 259\nhigh levels of cAMP (Figure S4A and (15)). We also showed that the cAMP measured in 260 selected PilT alleles was PilJ-dependent, supporting the known role of PilJ in cAMP 261 signaling (Figure S4B). 262 Together, these data show that mutations in various domains of the PilT motor alter 263 cAMP signaling of bacteria grown on a surface, and these pilT alleles also impact pilus 264 function by eliminating TM while retaining phage sensitivity, or alternatively, eliminating 265 both TM and sensitivity to phage. 266 267 Does PilT need to adopt both an ATP- (closed) and ADP- (open) bound state to 268 support surface-dependent signaling? 269 Our previous work demonstrated that only the retractive force necessary for phage 270 infection is necessary but not sufficient for surface-dependent cAMP induction (29). This 271 conclusion was reached based on the observation that a \u2206pilU mutant is phage susceptible, 272 TM negative and has a cAMP level above that of the WT strain, while strains expressing the 273 PilT-K136A (Walker A, WA) and PilT-E204A (Walker B, WB) mutations in a background 274 with functional PilU is phage susceptible, TM negative but do not induce the cAMP response 275 when grown on a surface (29). 276\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

That is, a fully functional PilT hexamer exists as a mixture 280 of ATP- and ADP-bound states, and we hypothesized that a mixture of ATP- (closed) and 281 ADP-bound (open) states of PilT might be necessary for cAMP signaling. 282 Given that the Walker A mutation prevents ATP-binding and the Walker B mutation 283 prevents hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (32, 41), based on previous studies (32), locking the 284 hexamer in either a fully unbound or fully ATP bound state, respectively, might interfere 285 with surface signaling. Furthermore, given the ADP-bound state is structurally similar to 286 nucleotide free state we reasoned that we may be able to observe the cAMP response if we 287 expressed both Walker A and B mutants of PilT within the same cell. 288 To perform this experiment, we transformed a multicopy plasmid expressing the 289 PilT-WA mutation (PBAD-pilT-K136A) in a background expressing the PilT-WB allele (PilT-290 E204A) integrated at its native locus with the PaQa reporter on the chromosome to 291 measure the cAMP response. As shown in Figure S2 (last 3 bars), these mutations had no 292 impact on cAMP levels, indicating that locking the PilT motor in these particular mixed 293 conformations does not alter cAMP signaling. 294 295 The retraction motor PilT binds to PilJ of the Pil-Chp system 296 The data presented so far are consistent with a model wherein PilT is required for 297 the surface-dependent cAMP response.

As a control we assessed binding between PilJ and the other retraction motor PilU 302 and the extension motor PilB, but did not observe any such interaction (Figure 4A,B). We 303 also assessed the interactions between PilT and the other components of the Pil-Chp 304 system as well as other proteins that are known to influence surface attachment through 305 T4P (Figure S5 and Table 2). We only detected robust interaction between PilT and PilJ, as 306 well as the previously reported interaction between PilU and PilT (40). 307 To characterize this interaction with the pilT alleles described above, these mutants 308 were cloned into the B2H system and the level of interaction with PilJ was measured via \u03b2-309\ngalactosidase activity. In general, PilT mutants that were able to perform TM and induce a 310 surface-dependent cAMP response had higher levels of interaction with PilJ (Figure 4C). 311 We explore the consequences of the changes in interaction below. 312 313 Associations between PilT-related phenotypes and cAMP signaling. 314 We next examined associations between cAMP signaling and other measured 315 phenotypes. Using our various P. aeruginosa mutant strains, we first plotted the diameter 316 of the twitch zone for each allele versus the level of cAMP for surface-grown cells as 317 measured by flow cytometry. Analyzing these data with a linear model we observed a 318 highly significant, positive correlation between the twitch zone diameter and level of cAMP 319 (Figure 5A). While this link between the production of cAMP and twitching motility is well 320 known, the direct relationship between the levels of cAMP and the extent of TM, to our 321 knowledge, has not been previously reported. 322\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

These values were then used 327 with cAMP data to build a linear model to evaluate the relationship between PilT-PilU 328 interaction strength and cAMP production (Figure S6B). We did not find any significant 329 relationship between PilT-PilU interaction strength and cAMP levels when analyzing either 330 all the PilT alleles or the mutations impacting ATPase activity, indicating that the 331 relationship between PilT-ATPase variants and interaction strength with cAMP levels is 332 specific to the PilT-PilJ interaction. 333 Together, these data indicate that the state of ATPase domain of PilT alters the 334 interaction of this motor protein with the PilJ. Furthermore, this association between 335 interaction strength of these ATPase mutants with PilJ and cAMP signaling suggests a 336 mechanism whereby PilT ATPase activity could be linked to PilJ-mediated cAMP signaling, 337 a possibility we discuss further below. 338 339 Isolation of a mutation that disrupts PilJ-PilT interaction in E. coli using a B2H-based 340 screen. 341 To attempt to further understand the interaction between PilT and PilJ, and to 342 assess the impact of this interaction on the influence of the cAMP response in P. aeruginosa, 343 we screened for mutants of PilT that were able to perform twitching motility but no longer 344 able to interact with PilJ using a B2H-based assay.

Briefly, random mutations were introduced into the pilT 346 sequence using error-prone PCR and then the mutant library cloned into the B2H 347 backbone. This pool was then co-transformed with the WT PilJ construct and we picked 348 white colonies indicating a loss of interaction with PilJ. The PilJ non-interacting alleles 349 were then pooled and screened for the ability to retract pili by cloning this population of 350 mutant pilT alleles into an expression vector and transforming this pool of alleles into the 351 \u2206pilT background of P. aeruginosa. The transformants were then screened for twitching 352 motility. The pilT alleles that were able to twitch and did not interact with PilJ using a 353 plate-based B2H assay were sequenced. 354 The extent of interaction of PilJ with candidate PilT alleles was then quantified using 355 the B2H assay (Figure S8A), the stability of the proteins assessed by Western Blot (Figure 356 S8B), and the mutations were mapped onto the PilT hexameric structure (Figure S8C). The 357 majority of these mutations mapped to a patch on the surface of the N-terminal domain of 358 the PilT protein. 359 As mentioned above, these mutant variants of PilT were checked for their stability 360 via Western blotting, and unfortunately, the only stable allele was PilT-H44L (Figure S8B). 361 The strain carrying the H44L showed levels of TM similar to the WT and the strain 362 expressing this allele is phage susceptible (Fig S8D). The H44 residue maps to the N-363 terminal domain of PilT and should not impact ATPase activity. Although this allele does 364 not interact with PilJ by B2H in E. coli, it appears to have phenotypes identical to the WT P. 365 aeruginosa for twitching and phage susceptibility, and it produces cAMP levels that are not 366 significantly different from the WT.

Data presented here and from previous 374 studies indicate that PilT is involved in sensing a surface, promoting at least minimal T4P 375 retraction activity, and that PilT\u2019s role may extended beyond its function in TFP retraction. 376 We show that mutations in PilT that affect structure or T4P-related phenotypes also affect 377 the surface-dependent cAMP response as measured through kinetic and endpoint assays. 378 We also describe a novel interaction between PilT and PilJ of the Pil-Chp system. We then 379 quantified the level of interaction between these PilT variants and PilJ using a B2H assay. A 380 linear model showed a positive, significant correlation between cAMP level and twitching 381 motility, and importantly, cAMP level and the strength or PilJ-PilT interaction for variants 382 of PilT with known deficiencies in ATPase activity. We interpret this latter finding to mean 383 that ATP binding and hydrolysis is critical, not only for retraction activity, but for PilT to 384 bind and transmit a signal to PilJ. Furthermore, the interaction strength between the PilT 385 ATPase mutants and PilJ is correlated with an increase in cAMP. We did not observe this 386 correlation when examining alleles of PilT with full ATPase activity or the interaction 387 between PilT and PilU. Together, these data support a model whereby the retraction motor 388 PilT senses the surface during T4P retraction and relays this signal to PilJ. 389\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We propose that when the PilU accessory 391 retraction motor is absent during retraction, PilT enters a force induced conformational 392 change, perhaps through stalling of the motor while attempting to retract a bound pilus, in 393 turn transmitting a surface signal to the Pil-Chp system. Our model makes several 394 predictions that have been confirmed in previous publications (15, 29, 39) and this study. 395 First, we demonstrated that cAMP levels when grown on a surface are dependent on the 396 presence of PilT and PilJ. Second, the absence of PilU leads to elevated cAMP levels, a 397 finding made by others and confirmed here (15, 29, 39). Lastly, our data show that excess 398 PilU, has the opposite effect, reducing the surface-dependent cAMP response. 399 We also observed a strong, positive correlation between twitching ability as 400 measured through twitch zone diameter and cAMP production for multiple mutants when 401 analyzed with a linear model. This finding is consistent with previous studies that 402 demonstrated that twitching motility requires cAMP production, and that at the single cell 403 level, oscillations of T4P activity and cAMP are highly correlated (39). While cAMP 404 production is dependent on T4P activity, this second messenger activates a positive 405 feedback loop whereby Vfr and cAMP positively regulate Fims-AlgR, which in turn leads to 406 increased expression of minor pilins and the number of active T4P complexes per cell. This 407 positive regulatory loop is part of the rapid surface adaptation response of P. aeruginosa, 408 and we now know that part of this signaling cascade is initiated by the retraction motor 409 PilT. Thus, PilT appears to play integrated roles in surface sensing and the control of TM in 410 response to surface inputs. 411\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This screen yielded two interesting findings. First, 414 most of the mutations mapped to a region near the N-terminus of PilT with a known role in 415 hexamer formation. The N-terminus of PilT binds to the C-terminus of the adjacent 416 monomer to form the hexamer. This interface also undergoes the major conformational 417 change during ATP binding and also makes contacts that facilitate the O and C 418 conformations. Thus, these mutations could impact PilT hexamer protein assembly and/or 419 function. Unfortunately, most of these PilT variants were unstable thus we could not 420 unwind whether the lack of signaling was due to reduced levels of the PilT protein, or the 421 inability of these mutant proteins to interact with PilJ. 422 We did isolate one allele of pilT that was able to perform TM but did not interact 423 with PilJ in E. coli using a B2H assay; for this allele (H44L) we still observed WT surface-424 dependent cAMP production in P. aeruginosa. This mutation was near the N-terminal 425 region of PilT and not in proximity to any parts of the protein thought to contribute to its 426 ATPase activity. Consistent with this idea, this allele was able to perform TM at a level 427 similar to that of WT, indicating that this mutant variant does not have a defect in its 428 ATPase activity. A similar phenotype was observed for the PilT-D31K allele, which retains 429 ATPase activity (32). This PilT-D31K allele, which also maps to the N-terminus of PilT, was 430 able to perform TM at WT levels and induce cAMP production when on a surface, but had 431 very low levels of interaction with PilJ when measured through the B2H assay. Thus, it is 432 possible that mutations at the N-terminus of PilT can impact its ability to interact with PilJ 433 in the B2H, but perhaps not impact PilT-PilJ interaction when this allele is expressed in P. 434\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We believe it is important to acknowledge that while our findings here allow us 436 to posit a model connecting T4P to surface sensing and cAMP signaling, we still lack key 437 pieces of information to build a model which explains all of the current data. We look 438 forward to interrogating our model further. 439 We believe our findings are consistent with previous studies, as T4P motors as 440 signaling proteins is not unprecedented. For example, Mxyococcus xanthus requires T4P for 441 exopolysaccharide (EPS) production as well as a type of surface-based motility known as S-442 motility.

Mutations in the T4P assembly ATPase PilB were isolated that led to the 444 production of EPS without S-motility. A Walker-A mutation in PilB phenocopied this 445 mutation and was dominant over the WT allele (46). Consistent with our studies of 446 T4P/PilY1 regulating surface-dependent cdG signaling (3), these data link a T4P and motor 447 function to second messenger signaling, and may represent a more general strategy 448 whereby T4P (and perhaps other pili families) serve double duty as adhesins and signal 449 transduction machinery. 450 Others have suggested that the surface signal is transmitted from the T4P pilin, PilA, 451 to PilJ to activate cAMP production. Although we have previously shown no correlation 452 between PilA-PilJ binding strength and cAMP production (29) this does not exclude a role 453 for PilA signaling through a different mechanism. Regardless of the extent of signaling 454 through PilA, the pilin remains a critical part of our motor signaling model, as the motor 455 relies on the pressence of a pilus fiber to extend and bind to the surface to create tension 456 during PilT retraction. Overall, we have presented evidence for a new model of surface 457\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP PA14 was used as the WT strain. 463 Mutations were made in this background using E. coli S17-1 \u03bbpir. E. coli BTH101 was used 464 for Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two Hybrid assays. Strains used in this study are listed in 465 Supplemental Table S1. Bacterial strains were routinely cultured in 5ml of lysogeny broth 466 (LB) medium or plated on 1.5% agar with antibiotics when necessary. Tetracycline (tet) 467 was used at 15ug/ml for E. coli and 120 ug/ml during P. aeruginosa selection and 468 maintained with 75ug/ml. Gentamicin (Gm) was used at 30 \u00b5g/ml for P. aeruginosa and 10 469 \u00b5g/ml for E. coli. Carbenicillin (Cb) was used at 250 ug/ml for P. aeruginosa and 100 ug/ml 470 for E. coli. Kanamycin (Kan) was used at 50 ug/ml for E. coli. M8 minimal salts medium 471 supplemented with MgSO4 (1mM), glucose (0.2%) and casamino acids (0.5%) was used for 472 all assays. Plasmids were induced with either 0.2% arabinose for PBAD promoter induction 473 or 0.5 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to agar or liquid media for 474\nPTAC promoter induction unless otherwise stated. b-galactosidase activity from B2H assays 475 was visualized using plates supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-476 galactopyranoside (X-Gal; 40 \u03bcg/ml). 477 478 Construction of mutant strains and plasmids.

Chromosomal mutations 481 were made using homologous recombination with the pMQ30 vector. Insertions at neutral 482 sites in the P. aeruginosa genome were made using the mini-Tn7 vector (47, 48) and the 483 mini-CTX1 vector (36). Resistance markers were removed using the pFLP2 plasmid 484 followed by sucrose counter selection (36). Point mutations were generated using 485 QuikChange \u00ae site-directed mutagenesis followed by Gibson assembly. Expression vectors 486 were generated using Gibson assembly of purified PCR products into pMQ72 or pVLT31 487 and then transformed into P. aeruginosa or E. coli using electroporation. 488 489 Twitching motility. Twitching motility plates were made using M8 medium 490 supplemented with casamino acids, MgSO4, glucose and 1% agar. Plates were inoculated 491 from liquid cultures using a sterile toothpick plunged through the agar to the bottom of the 492 plate. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37C and then 24 hours at room temperature. 493 The agar was then removed and the twitch zones were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. 494 Images were obtained and the twitch zone diameter was measured twice using a ruler. 495 496 Phage plaque assay. Phage susceptibility assays were performed in (60 x 15 mm) plates 497 using M8 medium supplemented with casamino acids, MgSO4, glucose, and 1% agar. 1ml 498 of 0.5% M8 molten agar was then inoculated with 50 ul from a P. aeruginosa overnight 499 culture. This mixture was poured over the solidified 1% M8 agar to form a bacterial lawn. 500 After solidifying, 2ul of phage DMS3vir lysate was pipetted onto the bacterial lawn and 501 incubated for 24 hours at 37C. 502 503\n.CC-BY-ND 4.0 International licenseavailable under a was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The B2H system from Euromedex (49) 504 was used to assess protein-protein interactions in E. coli BTH101. Alleles of pilT and other 505 T4P proteins were cloned into the pKT25 vector and PilJ along with other Pil-Chp proteins 506 were cloned into the pUT18 and pUT18C vectors. A pair of pKT25 and pUT18/UT18C 507 vectors were then co-transformed into E. coli BTH101. To visualize the interaction, 508 transformants were plated on LB agar containing Cb, Kan, X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-509 indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside) (40 g/ml) and IPTG (isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside) 510 (0.5 mM) and incubated at 30C until an interaction was observed through the 511 transformation of X-Gal to a blue pigment or until the negative control began to produce a 512 blue pigment. To quantify the level of interaction between proteins, transformants were 513 plated on LB agar with Cb, Kan and IPTG. After incubation at 30C, cells were harvested and 514 \u03b2-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (49). 515 516 Protein detection and quantification. Strains were grown in M8 liquid medium 517 supplemented with arabinose or IPTG and grown at 37C for 6 hours. Whole cell lysates 518 were prepared as previously described (50). Cultures were OD normalized to 1 and an 519 equal volume was resolved on either a 12% or 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were 520 then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with either anti-PilT or anti-PilU 521 antisera. Detection of proteins was performed using fluorescence detection with IR-Dye\u00ae-522 labeled fluorescent secondary antibodies and imaged using the Odyssey CLx Imager (LICOR 523 Biosciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Quantification of protein bands was performed using Image 524 Studio Lite software (LICOR Biosciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE).

Bacterial strains harboring the PaQa reporter on the 528 chromosome were subcultured into liquid M8 medium supplemented with glucose, 529 casamino acids, and MgSO4 and incubated at 37C until an OD of 0.5 was reached, ~3 hours. 530 Gm, Tet, IPTG, or arabinose was added to the liquid medium when indicated. 200ul of the 531 culture was then spread onto M8 agar plates and allowed to incubate for 5 hours at 37C. 532 Cells were then harvested from these plates, washed, diluted, and analyzed on a Beckman 533 Coulter Cytoflex S. FlowJo software version 10.8.1 was used to gate on populations of 534 single cells that had mKate fluorescence. The EYFP fluorescence from the PPaQa promoter 535 was then measured on the gated population. A workflow of the gating strategy can be 536 found in Figure S9. 537 538 Microscopy experiments using 8-well dishes.
