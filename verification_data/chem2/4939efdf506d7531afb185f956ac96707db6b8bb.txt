The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"The proposed polymer+protein model is qualitatively predicting the primary, secondary, and ternary adsorption tendencies of interacting globular proteins under certain conditions, which we explored. Using the results obtained here during variation of several relevant system parameters, one may combine the various cases to tune a system of interest after calibration, so that the final amount of adsorption will be close to the desired one, depending on the systemâ€™s requirements and the technical/chemical characteristics as well as the conditions of the surrounding environment."
