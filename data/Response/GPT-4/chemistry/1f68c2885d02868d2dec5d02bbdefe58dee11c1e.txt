Exploration of ANP0903 Liposomal Formulation in Other Cancer Types: Given the promising results observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), investigating the efficacy and safety of ANP0903 liposomal formulation in other types of cancer could be valuable. This would involve screening various cancer cell lines, including those resistant to current treatments, to evaluate the potential broad-spectrum anticancer activity of ANP0903.

Combination Therapy Studies: Investigating the synergistic effects of ANP0903 with other chemotherapeutic agents or treatment modalities (such as radiation or immunotherapy) could offer insights into more effective combination therapies for HCC. This could help overcome drug resistance and improve treatment outcomes.

Mechanistic Studies on Proteasome Inhibition by ANP0903: While the study suggests that ANP0903 induces cytotoxicity through proteasome inhibition, detailed mechanistic studies are needed to fully understand how ANP0903 interacts with the proteasome. This could involve identifying specific proteasome subunits affected by ANP0903 and elucidating the downstream effects on cellular processes.

Development of Targeted Liposomal Delivery Systems: Enhancing the specificity of ANP0903 liposomal formulation to cancer cells could minimize side effects on healthy cells. Future research could focus on engineering liposomes with surface modifications that target overexpressed receptors on cancer cells, ensuring more effective and selective drug delivery.

Long-term Efficacy and Toxicity Studies in Animal Models: Before clinical trials can be considered, it is crucial to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of ANP0903 liposomal formulation in relevant animal models of HCC. This includes evaluating potential immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and off-target effects to ensure that the treatment is both effective and safe for future clinical use.
