    "abstractText": "Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a non-communicable disease representing one of the most serious public health challenges of the twenty-first century. Its incidence continues to rise in both developed and developing countries, causing the death of 1.5 million people every year. The use of technology (e.g. smartphone application\u2014App) in the health field has progressively increased as it has been proved to be effective in helping individuals manage their long-term diseases. Therefore, it has the potential to reduce the use of health service and its related costs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a digital platform called \u201cTreC Diabete\u201d embedded into a novel organisational asset targeting poorly controlled T2DM individuals in the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT), Italy. Methods This trial was designed as a multi-centre, open-label, randomised, superiority study with two parallel groups and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Individuals regularly attending outpatient diabetes clinics, providing informed consent, are randomised to be prescribed TreC Diabete platform as part of their personalised care plan. Healthcare staff members will remotely assess the data shared by the participants through the App by using a dedicated online medical dashboard. The primary end-point is the evaluation of the Hb1Ac level at 12-month post-randomisation. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. *Correspondence: Sandro Inchiostro sandro.inchiostro@apss.tn.it Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 16 Giovanazzi et al. Trials (2023) 24:513 Discussion This trial is the first conducted in the PAT area for the use of an App specifically designed for individuals with poorly controlled T2DM. If the effects of introducing this specific App within a new organisational asset are positive, the digital platform will represent a possible way for people diagnosed with T2DM to better manage their health in the future. Results will be disseminated through conferences and peer-reviewed journals once the study is completed. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05629221.

Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial targeting type 2 diabetes individuals with non-ideal glycemic values (Telemechron study)\nTrial registration {2a and 2b} ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05629221 [Registered on November 29, 2022 prior start of inclusion]\nProtocol version {3} Version 2 of 27\u201309-2022 First issue date: 11 May 2022 (8 August 2022) Approved by Ethics Committee: 30 May 2022 (Amendment: 27 September 2022) (Ethics Committee opinions are available as Additional File 1) Primary reason for amendment: The trial initially aimed to recruit T2DM individuals with non-ideal glycemic values, also affected by post-infarction cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure. It was soon realised that the criteria of being both diabetic and with a heart condition would have compromised the recruitment process and no targeted sample size would have been reached in time. Therefore, the following two inclusion criteria were removed: (1) having a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease identified by a previous documented acute ischemic event requiring an hospital access or a diagnosis of ischemic heart diseases following a positive test for inducible ischemia, or (2) having a diagnosis of heart failure with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure I or II or III (reduced or preserved ejection fraction) [1] defined on the basis of a previous hospitalisation for heart failure, or defined by an ejection fraction below 50% and NYHA I or II or III (absence of dyspnoea at rest) Before the first version of the protocol was approved, Ethical Committee made the following requests: i) improved description of the intervention; ii) clarification related to the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices, that is, clarifying that TreC Diabete is not a medical device [2]; iii) amendment to the informed consent form to further simplify the wording (available in English upon request)\nFunding {4} This trial is funded by the Department of Health of the Italian National Health System in the context of the \u201cRicerca finalizzata (Bando della ricerca finalizzata year 2018)\u2014National Research (Bandi/ Call 2018)\u201d.

            "text": "Diabetes is a non-communicable disease characterised by an elevated level of blood glucose. About 422 million people have diabetes worldwide [3]; with 1.5 million deaths every year, diabetes is the fifth cause of death and represents one of the most serious public health challenges of the twenty-first century [3]. The most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), accounts for 90% of all diabetes cases. It is often described as a lifestyle disease because of its association with modifiable risk factors, such as overweight and physical inactivity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of T2DM is expected to rise in both developed and developing countries, leading to an increase in the economic loss for the people affected by the diseases, the society and the health systems [3]. Considering that diabetes is one of the main causes of severe long-term conditions, such as cardiovascular events, macro- and micro-vascular complications, it is urgent to tackle it by either preventing its onset or delaying its progression [4].\nThe management of diabetes is a sensitive issue, particularly when considering the (perceived) quality, acceptability and easiness of the service delivery, both from a patient and healthcare staff\u2019s perspective [5]. WHO has advocated the use of mobile health (mHealth) as a potentially effective methodology to support patients in the management of their health [6]. MHealth is defined as a \u201cmedical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones\u201d for collecting, managing and sharing health-related data between patients\u2014clinicians and researchers [6]. Therefore, mHealth constitutes a practice that can be effectively adopted for chronic diseases such as diabetes.\nAs part of the swift and disruptive development and use of technology in the context of public health and health care delivery that has characterised the last decades, there have been an increasing number of\nmHealth tools piloted in clinical contexts and targeting patients with diabetes [7]. A relevant number of studies tried to prove how communication technologies can increase self-management [8], as well as an effective improvement of clinical outcomes and better care costs [7, 9\u201311]. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis corroborate the effectiveness of mHealth intervention in improving clinical outcomes when compared to usual care in people with diabetes. The vast majority of these studies considered the improvement of the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels as their main outcome. The systematic reviews and meta-analysis of Martos-Cabrera and colleagues [12], Wu and colleagues [13] and Bonoto and colleagues [14], including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, showed that the use of mobile apps could yield to a significant reduction of HbA1c in comparison to usual care. Authors discussed the importance of further investigating the use of mHealth since current studies regarding mHealth are very heterogeneous by population and mHealth interventions and likely to focus on short-term effectiveness only (< 12\u00a0 months). The need of conducting more studies on mHealth intervention is supported by other studies results not able to find significant improvements in clinical outcomes, as reported in the systematic review and metaanalysis of Hyun and colleagues [15]. In this systematic review and meta-analysis considering T2DM adult participants and including 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the superiority of using a mobile application (App) or an App with e-coaching on HbA1c levels could only be observed on a limited number of subjects and for a short-term follow-up time [15].\nIn order to respond to the WHO emphasis on the importance of investing in strategies and public health programmes to prevent and manage diseases through the use of mHealth [16], the Italian Ministry of Health has made funds available to conduct studies focusing on the application of technology in the management of chronic diseases.\nThis study protocol focuses specifically on one of the Work Packages (WP), i.e. WP4, of a wider project called \u201cTelemedicine for home-based management of patients with chronic diseases and comorbidities: analysis of current models and design of innovative strategies to improve quality of care and optimise resource utilisation: TELEMECHRON study\u201d. WP4 has been approved to be implemented also in the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT), where, with a slightly lower prevalence of diabetes than in the Italian and global population, currently there are 28.000 cases of people\ndiagnosed with diabetes (5.0% of PAT total population) [17, 18]. The aim of this specific WP is to comprehensively assess an innovative healthcare management system targeting patients with T2DM in non-ideal glycaemic control status. The system is enabled by the use of a mHealth platform called \u201cTreC Diabete\u201d, including an App for participants/patients and a web-based dashboard for health care staff."

Clinicians of the diabetes clinics will provide standardised and key information regarding the study. If patients are interested, they will receive the information sheet to read (either face-toface or by email). The information sheet and the consent form for the participants are originally written in Italian. At this stage, patients will be contacted by a member of the research team (registered nurse) who will also ensure that the information sheet is fully read and understood. During another dedicated face-to-face appointment, the patient who volunteers to participate in the study will provide written informed consent, provided that all\nquestions regarding his or her involvement in the study are answered.

The privacy policy has been elaborated under Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR. The legal grounds of the processing are both the explicit consent of the data subjects (as regards data concerning health) and the performance of tasks carried out in the public interest by the data controller.\nBy signing the informed consent, participants will allow the appointed researchers to access their medical records\u2019, including blood test results at follow-up. Blood tests are carried out by qualified nurses who are not part of the research team but are still part of the APSS organisation. Blood tests performed within the hospital organisation do not require additional written consent."

            "text": "After being approached for face-to-face screening and enrolment, eligible individuals are randomised on a 1:1 allocation ratio to the intervention or the control group.\nThose allocated to the intervention group are prescribed with the TreC Diabete App. This is one of several Apps created within the so-called TreC platform, which enables citizens from PAT to access, manage and share information about their health and wellbeing in the context of telemedicine [23\u201326]. TreC is an acronym for Cartella Clinica del Cittadino (Citizens\u2019 Clinical Records), in which the citizen/patient plays the role of the focal manager and owner of his/her own health data. The technological platform has been preliminarily used for other studies targeting patients with diabetes, specifically pregnant women [27].\nParticipants will download the App from Google Play or Apple Store (Android or iOS system, respectively), accept the online information form, enter their tax code (Codice Fiscale) and the health card number, create a PIN code and then confirm it to complete the procedure. At this point, the participant must wait for the clinician to proceed with the activation of the App; otherwise, it will not be possible to access the functions. Participants are enabled to activate the App as soon as the clinician\nprovides the unique activation code. Participants can then set a personal password, required to access the App.\nClinicians will then prescribe the App for a 12-month period through the online medical dashboard. The dashboard allows the visualisation of the information shared by the participant. Moreover, it enables healthcare staff to interact directly through video-chat and chat with the participant. A menu allows clinicians to set up a specific and personalised plan for each participant: they are asked to indicate which parameter (e.g. BP) should be registered in the App and to activate reminders at set intervals. During the 12-month follow-up, clinicians will regularly check the information entered by the participant (minimum frequency of 45\u00a0 days). Clinicians can provide advice based on the information shared by the participant (e.g. inviting the participant to book an appointment with their general practitioner\u2014GP). Participants will receive the training for the use of the App as soon as they are allocated to the intervention group. A member of the research team (registered nurse) will show the participant how the App works, highlighting its different features. The appointed person will specifically show how to enter the PIN when asked, insert different types of data in the App, write in the chat, and fill in the questionnaire. Also, the registered nurse could be contacted by phone in case of problems managing the app. The app\u2019s chat was another way to contact researchers and IT personnel to solve management problems. Paper-based training material can be provided to the participant upon request.\nTable\u00a02 depicts the App features (for the prescriber and the participant perspectives) and provides an explanation of their use.\nParticipants in the control group are asked to record their health-related data such as body weight, BP, glycaemic levels, results of laboratory tests and diagnostic tests as usual (e.g. on a paper diary). Other information collected by the control group participants during the follow-up period can be shared, as routinely done, with their GP.\nFor the App functions described above and according to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745 requirements [2], the TreC Diabete App cannot be considered a medical device. The App does not perform operations on clinical data; it is used as data archive and for communication and simple research purposes. It does not provide direct recommendations to participants based on algorithms; it does not make changes or alterations to the collected data and it does not transfer data with implantable devices eventually belonging to the participants. Moreover, the App does not provide direct recommendation to the clinicians for diagnosis and treatment; it cannot be used to handle emergency situations.\nTable\u00a0 3 depicts the list of the therapeutic goals that people with T2DM should reach set by the current national and international guidelines [28\u201331]."

A lower variability around the HbA1c mean level is also expected for the subjects in the intervention group when compared to the HbA1c mean level for the subjects in the control group. It was assumed that at 12\u00a0 months, the mean Hb1Ac level will be 49 (SD \u00b1 3) mmol/mol in the intervention group and 52 (SD \u00b1 7) mmol/mol in the control group. In order to achieve a power of 80% and to keep the significance level at 5%, the sample size was calculated to be 102 (51 in each group) by using Open Epi (a freely accessible software, https:// www. opene pi. com/ Menu/ OE_ Menu. htm) as depicted in Fig.\u00a0 1 below.

(2) Activity status evaluated through the \u201cDuke Activity Status Index\u2014DASI scale\u201d, which measures the functional capacity perceived by the participant. It is a 12-item scale with a score that ranges from 0 (worst) to 58.2 (best). A difference of 2 or more is considered clinically significant [35, 36]. (3) Daily physical activity level, evaluated using the \u201cPhysical Activity Questionnaire Daily \u2013 IPAQ\u201d questionnaire, composed of 4 generic items with open-ended questions regarding last 7-day recall of physical activity [37]; (4) Evaluation of medication adherence using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale in the 4-item version (MMAS-4) [38]. The scale consists of 4 questions with a score of 0 and 1 for a \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d answer, respectively. The questions are summed to give a range of scores from 0 (high adherence) to 4 (low adherence). The questionnaire answers will be collected during the face-to-face meeting with the research team. (5) App user satisfaction using the System Usability Scale (SUS): The scale consists of 10 questions with a score ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong agreement). Each score is then multiplied by 2.5, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 100. A 68 score is considered above average [39]."

            "text": "This research project aims at assessing the impact of a telemedicine platform dedicated to DM patients as a self-management tool for supporting empowerment, selfmeasurement of parameters and adherence to care.\nOn the basis of previous studies, the TreC Diabete platform has proven to be an acceptable and viable tool to support new healthcare service delivery approaches enabled by new technologies: previous studies highlighted the use of TreC Diabete particularly among pregnant women, and the platform is currently part of the routine practice for this specific target considering the enrolment of approximately 100 women per year [23, 27]. This is done considering the complexity of the specific pathology with comorbidities and with respect to the treatment path with standard treatment. The use of a dedicated App for supporting patients\u2019 empowerment, simplifying connections between healthcare staff and patient / caregiver, is expected to improve process, intermediate and final outcomes of the patients\u2019 disease. Furthermore, the telemedicine platform is expected to represent a factor of satisfaction for patients, without a relevant impact in terms of workload for the healthcare staff. The platform is also expected to act as a trigger for a closer interaction among healthcare professionals. Interfacing with healthcare professionals asynchronously can promote patient compliance and allow healthcare professionals to arrive at the time of the visit with the anamnestic, clinical and laboratory elements ready. Potentially, this aspect could allow to reduce the timing of the visits whilst maintaining and even increasing the quality level of the diabetic visit. This aspect is particularly important in light of the challenge that has arisen in recent years and in future years of managing a complex, disabling and progressively growing disease, to be faced with resources that can be increased with difficulty in parallel with the spread of diabetic disease."
