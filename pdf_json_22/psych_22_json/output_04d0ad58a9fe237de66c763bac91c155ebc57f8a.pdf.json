The aim of this study is to perform an approximated replication of a previous network analysis study investigating how different clinical aspects\u2014covering psychopathology, cognition, personal resources, functional capacity, and real-life functioning\u2014are interrelated in the context of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.\u00a0Study design: A sample of 843 subjects from a multisite cohort study, with the diagnosis of a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, was used to estimate a network comprising 27 variables. The connectivity and relative importance of the variables was examined through network analysis. We used a quantitative and qualitative approach to infer replication quality.\u00a0Study results: Functional capacity and real-life functioning were central and bridged different domains of the network, in line with the replicated study. Neurocognition, interpersonal relationships, and avolition were also key elements of the network, in close relation to aspects of functioning. Despite significant methodological differences, the current study could substantially replicate previous findings.\u00a0 Conclusions: Results solidify the network analysis approach in the context of mental disorders and further inform future studies about key variables in the context of recovery from psychotic disorders.\nKey words: psychosis/functional capacity/functioning/re silience/cognition/psychopathology"

            "text": "Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders are an important cause of disability worldwide.1 The difficulties in addressing the consequences of these disorders might be related to the complexity of different factors at\u00a0play.\nBeyond psychopathology, an array of variables seems crucial to address during the recovery process.2 Neurocognitive deficits in psychotic disorders have been pointed over several years as another fundamental dimension impacting on the success of rehabilitation outcomes and also as a target for interventions.3 On a different angle, social and contextual factors such as stigma and social support have been shown to influence treatment outcomes.4 Personal factors such as resilience have more recently been gathering attention in the context of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and seem a promising point for future research.5 Moreover, these factors mutually impact each other creating a web of relationships, the understanding of which could help design better treatments. However, most clinical studies are not designed to grasp this complexity and more sophisticated methodologies still have limitations such as the assumption of a-priori hypotheses or the exclusion of circular relationships between variables (e.g. directed acyclic graphs). Network analysis emerged in psychometric research as a tool that overcomes these limitations, while also being suited to accommodate the analysis of numerous variables simultaneously.6,7 The use of network analysis in\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/48/4/871/6546024 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\npsychiatry can go beyond the study of psychopathology symptoms and deal with different interacting domains.8\nAn example of the usefulness of this approach is presented by Galderisi et\u00a0al.9 in the context of communitydwelling patients with schizophrenia. In their work, the authors included a set of variables cutting across different domains (i.e. psychopathology, neurocognition, functional capacity, personal resources, and real-life functioning). This way, they intended to gain insight into the complex associations between these domains, ultimately trying to clarify pathways in order to design integrated treatment plans. The main findings were that the capacity to perform everyday specific tasks in optimal conditions (i.e. functional capacity) and real-life functioning (a combination of interpersonal, work, and everyday life skills) showed a high connectivity within the network, whereas variables such as positive symptoms were deemed as more marginal. These results underscored the importance of approaches that are recovery-oriented and personalized. However, replication of these findings is needed in light of the exploratory nature of network models and the importance of taking the \u201creplication crisis\u201d in psychology and psychiatry seriously.10,11\nThe main goal of the current study was to evaluate an approximated replication of the study by Galderisi et\u00a0al.9 in a sample of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. By doing so, we hoped to simultaneously replicate important findings concerning factors contributing to real-life functioning while also extending the literature on network replicability to the context of schizophreniaspectrum disorders. We also aimed to test the generalizability of Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study to a broader clinical population (full schizophrenia-spectrum), hence expanding its original value."

In the current analysis, only the patient data of the first follow-up assessment was used, 3\u00a0 years after baseline (n\u00a0=\u00a0843).

            "text": "Similar to Galderisi et\u00a0 al.,9 a network model was constructed to model the relationship between the variables. All analyses were performed using the programming language R.31 Network models consist of nodes, which represent variables (e.g. working memory, avolition) and edges, which indicate a statistical relationship between them.32 In addition, edges can further give information about the strength of the relationship (thicker edges represent a stronger relationship) and also whether the association is negative (red edges) or positive (blue\u00a0edges).\nWe modeled an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)33 network using the R package qgraph.34 Compared to correlation and partial correlation networks, a LASSO network can be more easily interpretable as it assigns penalties to shrink weak partial correlations to 0, thus creating a more parsimonious graph. To control the sparsity, LASSO uses a tuning parameter, the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC), which is by default implemented in the qgraph package.35 We used this network estimation technique to keep the methods aligned as much as possible with the study by Galderisi et\u00a0al.9 Spearman partial correlations were used to account for non-normality of the variables. The network layout was based on the FruchtermanReingold algorithm,36 which places nodes with strong associations in the center of the network, and the proximity of the nodes is weighed based on the strength of the interaction. In line with Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 analysis, only edges of 0.05 or above were depicted. Pairwise estimation of missing data was\u00a0used.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/48/4/871/6546024 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nTo account for the importance of individual nodes, centrality measures were computed: node strength, closeness, and betweenness.32,37 Node strength is the sum of the weighted edges of a node, thus translating its local interconnectedness in the network. Closeness investigates how strongly a node is indirectly connected to other nodes by taking the inverse of the sum of all shortest paths between one node and all other nodes in the network. Betweenness is the measure of how many shortest paths between two nodes go through the node at hand, such that higher betweenness facilitates links in the network. Centrality measures help indicating which nodes might be more relevant in the network. The interpretation of\nspecific centrality measures\u2014i.e. betweenness and closeness\u2014is not entirely clear when applying network analysis in mental disorders.38 They were nonetheless included in our analysis to ensure a closer resemblance to Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9study and also because we considered them to have interest for the assessment of replicability.\nThe robustness of the network was computed as suggested by Epskamp et\u00a0al.,32 using the bootnet R package. We investigated the accuracy of edge-weights, followed by the stability of centrality indices and the bootstrapped difference tests between edge weights and centrality indices.\nFinally, the extent to which the findings replicate Galderisi et\u00a0 al.\u2019s9 results was explored using different\nTable 1.

These measures gave a broader overview of the networks\u2019 structural similarity. Secondly, we compared the five nodes with highest centrality scores between the two networks. This way, we gained further insight into the similarities and differences regarding the most important (i.e. central) nodes. Thirdly, we compared the two networks regarding the connections between domains, therefore aiming to identify the most important bridging nodes and compare them between the two networks. Bridge nodes are of particular interest due to their hypothesized role in cohering the overall network structure, hence, becoming natural targets for interventions.40 The authors from Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9study provided us with the correlation matrix used as input for the network analysis, this way enabling the strategies outlined above."

Moreover, the domains also tended to share several edges between each other, highlighting their interconnected\u00a0nature.\nDescriptive statistics of the variables used as input for the network analysis can be found in supplementary table S2.\nCorrelation of Edge Weights and Centralities. To investigate how well the current study\u2019s network replicated Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s,9 we correlated all edge weights between them and obtained the correlation of r\u00a0=\u00a00.64, which indicates a moderate to strong relationship. The correlations between the centrality measures were lower: r\u00a0=\u00a00.44 for strength and betweenness centrality, and r\u00a0 =\u00a0 0.55 for closeness (see supplementary figures S2\u2013S5). Comparing Centrality Indices. Figure 2 displays the centrality indices for every node in the current study\u2019s network. Furthermore, table\u00a0 3 shows the five nodes with the highest centrality in each centrality domain for both networks. For the strength measure, the nodes \u201cworking memory\u201d and \u201cavolition\u201d ranked high in both networks. For closeness and betweenness, three nodes replicated: \u201ceveryday life skills\u201d, \u201cfunctional capacity\u201d, and \u201cinterpersonal relationships\u201d. Bridging Nodes. Functional capacity took up the most central role of bridging nodes from the psychopathologic, neurocognitive, resilience, real-life functioning, and \u201cother\u201d domains together, thereby replicating one of the most important findings of Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study to a great extent. Another central node was the neurocognitive item \u201cprocessing speed\u201d which bridged neurocognition and to a lesser extent social cognition items to the rest of the network. In the Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study, working memory instead of processing speed took a more central role within cognition and also as a bridge to other domains (namely, functional capacity). Emotion recognition was another important bridge from cognitive variables to functioning variables in their study. The three real-life functioning variables acted as a bridge between all psychopathologic variables, resilience items, and variables from the \u201cother\u201d domain. This was also overall true for Galderisi et\u00a0 al.,9 where everyday life skills, in particular, took on a very important bridging role. The psychopathology domain shared connections mostly with functional capacity and real-life functioning items. While \u201cdepression\u201d connected the psychopathologic domain to resilience items, \u201cavolition\u201d connected it to real-life functioning items. In Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9study, the psychopathology domain was less pivotal between domains. However, disorganization and avolition played more relevant bridging roles with the first being connected to functional capacity and the latter closer to resilience items, while both being connected to real-life functioning items. Robustness Analysis. Bootstrapped confidence intervals were calculated for each edge weight, in this way\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/48/4/871/6546024 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nestimating their accuracy. The results showed that the confidence intervals were generally narrow, suggesting that the stability of the edge weights estimates was likely good (supplementary figure S6).\nThe stability of centrality indices was evaluated with a case-dropping bootstrap procedure.32 The correlationstability coefficients were considered good for strength centrality (CS-coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.60), acceptable for betweenness centrality (CS-coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.28), and unstable for closeness centrality (CS-coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.21; see supplementary figure S7). Despite betweenness and closeness warranting caution, we still considered all the centrality indices for discussion. Further bootstrapped difference tests can be found as supplementary figures S8\u2013S11."

Functional capacity was of particular importance, bridging core neurocognition, avolition, and more general functioning outcomes. Findings affirm functional capacity as a very relevant clinical outcome while also confirming the need to concomitantly consider negative symptoms in the prediction of real-world functioning.41,42\nReplication parameters comparing the current network to the study by Galderisi et\u00a0al.9 were overall considered good. This is also in line with previous studies which have investigated replication quality of the network approach, specifically in the context of major depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and internalizing symptoms.39,43\u201345\nFig. 1.

The magnitude of edgeweight correlation was comparable to the findings of a previous study in PTSD where the analyzed networks relied on the same instrument.43\nBoth the importance of and the interactions between functional capacity and the real-life functioning domain were well replicated.

These four nodes were among the most connected in both networks and with highest centralities. They bridged the social cognitive and neurocognitive nodes with the resilience and psychopathology domains, as well as the \u201cother\u201d variables. These findings indicate that functional recovery is related to multiple dimensions. This seems to corroborate previous literature supporting integrated approaches for psychosis.46,47 One way, then, to take these results (as also pointed out by Galderisi et\u00a0al.9) would be to acknowledge that (i) outcomes close to real-life functioning such as functional capacity should be more often measured and directly addressed by therapeutic interventions, and (ii) at the individual level, different paths might lead to functional recovery, hence personalized interventions are warranted.\nInterpersonal relationships, a real-life functioning variable, was again among the few variables connecting resilience items with the rest of the network. It was associated with the social competence, everyday life skills, functional capacity, and avolition nodes in both networks. Its high centrality values were to a great extent due to bridging functional capacity, resilience, psychopathology items, and three real-life functioning items. The link between interpersonal relationships, everyday life skills, and the standard of living in patients with schizophrenia has long been studied and explored with therapeutic purposes.48 Indeed, meta-analytic research showed that social skills training is capable of increasing social performance, as well as decreasing patients\u2019 negative symptoms.49\nThe depression node was negatively connected to resilience items \u201cperception of self\u201d and \u201cperception of future\u201d. In the network of Galderisi et\u00a0al.,9 depression was only associated with \u201cperception of self\u201d but the edge was very strong between \u201cperception of self\u201d and \u201cperception of future\u201d in both networks. Looking at the GROUP network, the resilience items \u201cperception of self\u201d and \u201cperception of future\u201d were not directly related to positive or\nnegative symptoms, only through the depression node. This concurs with literature showing that affective symptoms (i.e. depression and anxiety), are more substantially associated with personal recovery than positive or negative symptoms.50 Avolition was the psychopathology node with higher relevance, showing important connections to functional capacity and real-life functioning nodes, the latter also shared by Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 estimated network. This seems aligned with other network studies in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis51,52 and also non-network literature.53 Overall, this points to the crucial role avolition plays within negative symptoms with regard to functional recovery and also within a broader set of clinical symptoms.54"

            "text": "Regarding neurocognitive variables, processing speed and working memory behaved differently in the two networks, the first being more central than the latter in the current study and the opposite pattern being found in Galderisi et\u00a0 al.\u2019s9 study. We believe this might be explained by the use of different underlying instruments between the studies. In particular, in the current study, working memory assessment was approached only through its verbal component, rendering a less central node when compared to Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study (which also included a spatial span task). With a less central working memory node, this pivotal role was instead assumed by processing speed in the current\u00a0study.\nDespite the common role functional capacity played in both networks in connecting the neurocognition and social cognition domains to the rest of the nodes, some differences should be mentioned. In the current study\u2019s network, functional capacity was more closely related with psychopathologic, rather than neurocognitive items \u2013 it was associated with four out of five psychopathology nodes and only one neurocognitive node. Conversely, in Galderisi et\u00a0 al.9 it was linked with four out of six\nTable 3.

This was possibly due to the nature of the instruments used \u2013 an external evaluation of functioning in the current study vs. an active performance task in Galderisi et\u00a0al.,9 the latter being typically more related to neurocognitive outcomes. Support for the close association of functional capacity and neurocognition comes from previous studies, which recommend functional capacity as an additional measure in neurocognitive tests.55,56 Those studies\u2014similarly to Galderisi et\u00a0 al.9\u2014conceptualized functional capacity using the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA).57 The UPSA batteries consist of performance-based assessments where subjects need to demonstrate their ability, for instance, to use public transport or buy groceries, rather than relying on a questionnaire, which was the case in the current study. However, considering this difference, it is notable how similar the functional capacity node behaved in both studies.\nPositive symptoms played a relatively more important role in the current study\u2019s network when compared to Galderisi et\u00a0 al.\u2019s9 study, especially due to more connections within psychopathology. This translates previous evidence from the literature58 concerning the close relationship between positive and affective symptoms in the wider spectrum of psychosis."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "Several limitations of our study should be considered. First, there were significant differences between the participants and the instruments used in the two studies. While Galderisi et\u00a0 al.\u2019s9 sample consisted only of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, subjects in the current sample were diagnosed with nonaffective psychotic disorders, with significantly less severe symptoms. Even though this is a limitation in the context of the replication reliability, it nevertheless contributes to expand the scope of Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study. Divergences in instrument\u2019s choice were also clear, particularly for some items. While a few nodes were represented by identical or very similar instruments (e.g. disorganization, depression, positive symptoms, and attention), others differed in important ways (e.g. service engagement, work skills, functional capacity). In the current study, avolition was calculated including the item \u201cdisturbance of volition\u201d from the PANSS. This item was not included in Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 avolition construct, in congruence with a recent guidance paper considering it to be closer to cognition/disorganization rather than negative symptoms.59 This might explain connectivity differences between the studies regarding the avolition node. Nonetheless, for the vast majority of nodes, key constructs were comparable granting an acceptable resemblance between studies.\nSecond, on a technical note, two aspects should be mentioned: although the size of our sample (n\u00a0 =\u00a0 843)\nwas similar to Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study (n\u00a0=\u00a0740), the latter dataset was complete while in the current study there was a considerable amount of missing data. It was not possible to remove the missing data because there would have been too few remaining cases. The existence of missing data also prevented the use of a nonparanormal transformation with the aim of relaxing the normality assumption (as used in Galderisi et\u00a0al.9). Another technical limitation relies on the use of the LASSO network estimation technique, which assumes that the variables are continuous. In fact, the variable \u201cFamily cohesion\u201d was dichotomous in the current study. We still opted to use this method in order to keep a closer resemblance to Galderisi et\u00a0al.\u2019s9 study. Of note, the use of Spearman correlations was shown to also work well in the case of network estimation with ordered non-normal data.60\nThird, similarly to Galderisi et\u00a0al.,9 the cross-sectional nature of the current study prevents reaching conclusions with regards to causality and the direction of effects."

Furthermore, a follow-up study from the same authors on the same cohort greatly overlapped with baseline findings.61 This points to the robustness of the common findings and their relevance to the recovery of patients with psychotic disorders. The comparable findings between the studies point to the importance of neurocognition, social skills, and avolition for functional recovery in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Interventions targeting neurocognition, on one side, while simultaneously aiming at improving social skills and avolition are thought to be the most promising to stimulate functional recovery. Further intervention studies using longitudinal designs and network analysis are needed to shed light onto causal pathways hence clarifying the most promising approaches to recovery."
