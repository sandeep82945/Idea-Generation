Its root is commonly used as folk medicinal materials in southern China. The chemical compositions of I. asprella are rich in pentacyclic triterpenoids, which show various biological activities and demonstrate a good prospect for drug development. The elucidation of biosynthesis mechanism of triterpenoids in I. asprella could lay important foundations for the production of these precious plant secondary metabolites by metabolic engineering. Our previous studies have revealed IaAO1 (a CYP716A210 homolog) responsible for the C-28 oxidation of \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin. Herein, we reported the identification of three more cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes IaAO2 (a CYP716A212 homolog), IaAO4 (CYP714E88), IaAO5 (CYP93A220), and a cytochrome P450 reductase gene IaCPR by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae eukaryotic expression system and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among them, the protein encoded by IaAO2 can catalyze the C-28 oxidation of \u03b1-amyrin and \u03b2-amyrin, IaAO4 can catalyze the C-23 oxidation of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, while IaAO5 is responsible for the C-24 oxidation of \u03b2-amyrin. By introducing three genes IaAO1, IaAO4 and IaCPR into S. cerevisiae. We constructed an engineered yeast strain that can produce C-23 hydroxyl ursane-type triterpenoid derivatives. This study contributes to a thorough understanding of triterpenoid biosynthesis of medicinal plants and provides important tools for further metabolic engineering.\nKeywords: Ilex asprella, triterpenoid, biosynthesis, CYP, CPR\nINTRODUCTION\nAs a group of important plant secondary metabolites, triterpenoids exist widely in fungi, ferns, monocotyledons, dicotyledons and animals, especially dicotyledons (Liby et al., 2007). These compounds have a wide range of pharmacological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-virus and immune regulation (Nazaruk and Borzym-Kluczyk, 2015; Bao et al., 2018; Lou et al., 2021). However, the structures of triterpenoids are complex and the content of triterpenoids in plants is relatively low. Most of these compounds are mixed with compounds with similar structures. So it is difficult to obtain a large quantity of triterpenoid monomers by plant\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 831401\nextraction, separation or chemical synthesis (Moses et al., 2015). Nowadays, with increased understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of triterpenoids, synthetic biology has turned into a promising platform for high production of these high-value natural products.\nThere are many key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoids. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), as an important enzyme in the metabolism of plant triterpenoids, directly affect the structural diversity and biological activity of triterpenoids as they participate in the oxidative modification downstream of their biosynthetic pathway. Recently, quite a few CYP genes involved in the oxidation of triterpene skeletons have been identified. For example, CYP88D6 encodes a \u03b2-amyrin 11- oxidase catalyzing the sequential two-step oxidation of \u03b2-amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin in the glycyrrhizin pathway (Seki et al., 2008). CYP716A52v2 as a \u03b2-amyrin 28-oxidase played a key role in the formation of oleanane-type triterpene biosynthesis in the ginsenoside pathway (Han et al., 2013). CYP716A141 as a \u03b2-amyrin 16-oxidase was able to catalyze C16\u03b2 hydroxylation of \u03b2-amyrin in the platycodon grandiflorus saponin pathway (Tamura et al., 2017). CYP72A68v2 and CYP93E2 were involved in the hemolytic and non-hemolytic sapogenin biosynthetic pathways in M. truncatula, mainly the oxidative modification at position 23 and 24 (Fukushima et al., 2013). Despite the identification of more and more CYPs, their oxidative modification mechanism of many sites has not been totally revealed (Seki et al., 2015). There are still great challenges in the functional characterization of CYPs due to the low yield of products, low stability of enzymes and rapid consumption of cofactors (Ohnishi et al., 2006; Rasool and Mohamed, 2016; Liu et al., 2020).\nCytochrome P450 reductase (CPRs) is an important component of cytochrome P450 system (Guengerich et al., 2009). When CYPs works, CPRs is included as the electron donor and the electron transfer reaction between them is also believed to be the rate-limiting step of CYP catalytic oxidation (Rana et al., 2013). Matching CYP with appropriate CPR can improve the catalytic efficiency of P450 system. Recently, glycyrrhetinic acid and 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin in engineered yeast were greatly improved by co-expressing new CYPs and CPRs from plant sources. This provided a new way for the optimization and regulation of exogenous pathway in yeast (Zhu et al., 2018).\nIlex asprella from Aquifoliaceae is popular traditional medicinal materials widely used in Southern China (Li et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018). The main active components of I. asprella are a great variety of ursane- and oleanane-type triterpenoids with oxidation and glycosylation modification (Du et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019). The oxidative modification occurs at various positions, mainly at C-19, 23, 24, and 28 (Figure 1). These triterpenoids show various biological activities and high clinical application values. Among them, asprellanoside A had obvious antiviral effect determined by in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity test (Zhou et al., 2012). Ilexoside O had obvious anticoagulant effect and could decrease the amount of the abdominal aortic blood clots (Taketa et al., 2004). Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the biosynthesis of pentacyclic triterpenoids of I. asprella.\nPreviously, we have obtained the transcriptome of I. asprella using RNA-sequencing (GenBank accession number SRP035767) (Zheng et al., 2014). Transcriptome analysis showed that several Unigenes might be related to pentacyclic triterpene biosynthesis. Among them, IaAS1 and IaAS2 were identified as oxidosqualene cyclase, catalyzing the conversion of 2, 3-oxidosqualent to \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin at different ratios. IaAS1 mainly produces \u03b1-amyrin, accounting to \u226580% of total amyrin production. IaAS2 mainly synthesizes \u03b2-amyrin with a yield of 95% (Zheng et al., 2015). And IaAO1 (a CYP716A210 homolog) catalyzes the C-28 carboxylation of amyrin (Ji et al., 2020). However, genes pertaining to the oxidation at other positions are still unknown. In this study, we reported the identification of three CYP genes, involved in oxidative modifications at C-28, C-23 and C-24 positions, and one CPR gene IaCPR, the cofactor of bi-enzymatic system."

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed three CYP genes potentially involved in oxidative modification in triterpenoid biosynthesis, namely IaAO2, IaAO4, and IaAO5 (Figure 2).\nAmong them, gene IaAO2 (a CYP716A212 homolog, GenBank accession No. OL604227) is 1,239 bp in length, encoding a protein of 412 aa. TMHMM Server v2.0 online tool was used to predict the transmembrane domain of IaAO2 protein. The results showed that IaAO2 protein was located outside the cell membrane and there was no transmembrane domain (Supplementary Figure 4). IaAO2 was closely clustered with CYP716A75, which was identified from Maesa lanceolata as a multifunctional C-28 oxidase capable of converting \u03b2-amyrin and 16\u03b1-hydroxy \u03b2-amyrin to oleanolic acid and 16\u03b1-hydroxy oleanolic acid, respectively (Moses et al., 2015). The sequence similarity between IaAO2 and CYP716A75 is 60%. It is worth mentioning that the N-terminal of IaAO2 was 66 amino acids less than IaAO1, but its functional domain structure was complete (Supplementary Figure 4). The similarity of amino acid sequences encoded by IaAO2 and IaAO1 is 76.46%. Therefore, it is plausible that IaAO2 encodes a triterpene C28 oxidase.\nSequence analysis of IaAO4 (CYP714E88, GenBank accession No. MZ508437) revealed an open reading frame of 1,539 bp, encoding a protein of 513 aa. IaAO4 was closely clustered with CYP714E19, which was identified from Centella asiatica as a multifunctional C-23 oxidase capable of converting ursolic acid and oleanolic acid to 23-carboxyl-ursolic acid and gypsogenin in three successive steps, respectively (Kim et al., 2018). The sequence similarity between IaAO4 and CYP714E19 is 63.32%. Thus IaAO4 is very likely a triterpene C-23 oxidase.\nThe other putative CYP gene IaAO5 (CYP93A220, GenBank accession No. MZ508433) includes an open reading frame of 1,545 bp, encoding a protein of 515 aa. IaAO5 was closely clustered with CYP93E1, which was identified from Glycine max as a C-24 hydroxylase capable of converting \u03b2-amyrin to olean12-ene-3\u03b2, 24-diol (Shibuya et al., 2006; Moses et al., 2014). The sequence similarity between IaAO5 and CYP93E1 is 49.42%. Therefore, IaAO5 might be a triterpene C-24 hydroxylase, too.\nLikewise, IaCPR (GenBank accession No. MZ508433) annotated as \u201ccytochrome P450 reductase\u201d contains an open\nreading frame of 2,133 bp, encoding a 710 aa protein. According to phylogenetic tree analysis, IaCPR was divided into CPR II family (Figure 3).\nBy using RNA from the leaves of I. asprella as template, cDNA of IaAO2, IaAO4, IaAO5 and IaCPR were obtained."

Its enzymatic properties were analyzed (Supplementary Figure 2).

WAT11tfA accumulates the common triterpene precursor 2, 3-oxidosqualene, while WAT11tfAX accumulates the triterpenoid intermediates \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin.\nIn case of IaAO2, it was hetero-expressed separately or together with IaCPR in yeast strain WAT11tfAX. Western blot analysis showed that IaAO2 was expressed as expected (Supplementary Figure 1). The metabolites of strains WAT11tfAX-pTIaAO2 and WAT11tfAX-pTIaAO2-IaCPR after 7 days of cultivation were analyzed, using WAT11tfAX as a negative control. WAT11tfAX-pTIaAO2 accumulated four additional peaks (peak 1\u223c4, Figure 4A). Peak 2 and 3 were determined as oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA), respectively (Figure 4B).

And the control strain did not accumulate these products. The results demonstrated that IaAO2 is a C-28 triterpene oxidase, catalyzing the oxidation of \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin to OA and UA, respectively. Furthermore, strain WAT11tfAX-pTIaAO2-IaCPR also accumulated OA and UA but in larger quantities (964.73 \u00b5g/L UA, about 2.5-fold as that of WAT11tfAX-pTIaAO2), suggesting that IaCPR could promote the catalytic efficiency of IaAO2 in S. cerevisiae (Table 1).\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 831401\nTo identify the function of IaAO4, it was co-expressed in the yeast strain WAT11tfAX together with IaAO1 for biochemical characterization and metabolite determination. Western blot analysis revealed the successful expression of IaAO4 (Supplementary Figure 1). As expected, the expression of IaAO1 in WAT11tfAX led to the production of OA and UA. The expression of pESC-URA did not lead to any additional products. In comparison, co-expression of IaAO1 and IaAO4 resulted in the formation of four new peaks (Figure 5A). Among the newly formed peaks, the peak 1 and 3 were identified as hederagenin and gypsogenic acid (GA), based on the consistence of retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Peak 2 and 4 displayed the characteristic fragment ions m/z 203 and 320 of pentacyclic triterpenes. In addition, peak 2 showed MS fragmentation pattern similar to that of hederagenin (Figure 5B) and peak 4 showed pattern similar to that of GA, implying peak 1 and 2, peak 3 and 4 must be two pairs of isomers. Therefore, peak 2 and 4 were tentatively identified as 23-hydroxyl-ursolic acid and 23-carboxyl-ursolic acid. These results demonstrate that IaAO4 is a multifunctional triterpenoid oxidase, catalyzing the oxidation of both OA and UA at the C-23 position, most likely in three successive steps.\nFor functional characterization of IaAO5, it was firstly carried out by using \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin producing strain WAT11tfAX. However, no newly formed product was detected. Therefore, yeast strain WAT11tfA-pDIaAS2, WAT11tfA-pDIaAS2-pT and WAT11tfA-pDIaAS2-pTIaAO5 were constructed. Western blot\nanalysis revealed IaAO5 was successfully expressed in yeast (Supplementary Figure 1). GC-MS analysis showed WAT11tfApDIaAS2 produced \u03b2-amyrin as anticipated and WAT11tfApDIaAS2-pT accumulated no new compounds other than \u03b2-amyrin (Figure 6A). In contrast, the WAT11tfA-pDIaAS2pTIaAO5 produced one additional compound which was not found in the controls. The compound was identified as \u03b1-Boswellic acid after compared with the authentic standard in regard of retention time and mass spectra (Figure 6B). These results demonstrate that IaAO5 from I. asprella catalyzes oxidation at the C-24 position of \u03b2-amyrin to yield \u03b1-Boswellic acid (Figure 7)."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The vast structural diversity of plant triterpenoids is largely created by CYPs, the key enzymes from the downstream biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we identified three CYPs from I. asprella, namely IaAO2, IaAO4, and IaAO5. They are responsible of various oxidative tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of ursane- and oleanane-type triterpenoids. IaAO2 could convert \u03b1- and \u03b2-amyrin into UA and OA, respectively. This is the second C-28 oxidase from I. asprella. According to previous report, 90% of triterpenoids in I. asprella are oxidized at C-28 position (Ji et al., 2020). Therefore, it can be inferred that C-28 oxidase is the key enzyme catalyzing the initial step of multiple oxidation of triterpenoids. Notably, IaAO2 contains no transmembrane domain, unlike other characterized CYPs. And the lack of transmembrane domain did not affect its catalytic activity in heterologous host yeast. Quantitative PCR revealed the unambigous expression of IaAO2 in different tissues of I. asprella, suggesting it must play a role in plant. However, its exact function is unknown and need to be further elucidated.\nAnother CYP identified in this study IaAO4, was shown to be a multifunctional triterpenoid C-23 oxidase, accepting both OA and UA. A similar enzyme CYP714E19 has been isolated from Centella asiatica (Kim et al., 2018). According to the author, CYP714E19 plays a major role in oxidizing the C-23 methyl group of various triterpenoid precursors into corresponding 23- hydroxy compounds, and only a lesser role in the two further oxidation steps to the corresponding aldehydes and acids. In comparison, IaAO4 catalyzed the oxidation of UA and OA to the corresponding alcohols and acids, no aldehyde products at C-23 position can be detected. Besides, there are two more C23 oxidases, CYP72A397 and CYP72A552, which were proved to accept only oleanane-type substrates (Seki et al., 2011; Han et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Tzin et al., 2019). Investigation into the interactions between these CYPs and substrates may shed light on the reasons for differences in their substrate specificity profile.\nThe third CYP, IaAO5 catalyzes the carboxylation at the C-24 position of \u03b2-amyrin to yield \u03b1-Boswellic acid. The catalytic reaction was observed only in \u03b2-amyrin producing strain WAT11tfA-pDIaAS2 expressing IaAO5 but not in \u03b1and \u03b2-amyrin producing strain WAT11tfAX containing IaAO5. The reasons may lie in low amount of the substrate \u03b2-amyrin in the strain WAT11tfAX and poor catalytic efficiency of IaAO5. So far, several triterpenoid C-24 oxidases have been reported, but their functions seem vary slightly from one another. CYP749A63 catalyzes C-24 hydroxylatin of OA. CYP93E subfamily members like CYP93E1 and CYP93E2 convert \u03b2-amyrin to the product olean-12-ene-3\u03b2, 24-diol (Shibuya et al., 2006; Moses et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2019). Compared to that, IaAO5 from I. asprella must catalyze the three-step oxidation of methyl group of \u03b2-amyrin, though no corresponding alcohol and aldehyde at C-24 has been detected in our study.\nVersatile triterpenoids and triterpenoid saponins have been isolated asprella, most of which are oxidized at various positions.\nThe isolation of different CYPs from I. asprella is not only consistent with multiple oxidative modification of triterpenoids, but also provides valuable synthetic biology tools for metabolic engineering. Yeast strain WAT11L with the integration of three genes IaCPR, IaAO1 and IaAO4 by CRISPER/Cas9 produces probably C-23 hydroxylation triterpenes, as expected. Yeast strain WAT11tfAX harboring the gene IaAO2 accumulated UA and OA and subsequent introducing another copy of CYP redox partner, IaCPR, increased the production up to 2.5- fold. In conclusion, the characterization of IaAO2, IaAO4, IaAO5, and IaCPR may give rise to new potential approaches for genetic engineering to enhance large-scale production of biological active triterpenoid saponins of I. asprella and provide precursor substrates for the identification of more new oxidases."
