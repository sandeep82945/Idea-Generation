            "text": "Species belonging to the Michelia genus are arboreous plants, growing in the temperate zones of oriental India, southern China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Various chemical constituents isolated from different species of the genus Michelia include aporphines, oxoaporphines, steroids, benzenoids, and terpenoids. The important biological activities of constituents isolated from Michelia are anticancer, antiplasmodial and antibacterial activities [1]. Lesser-known species, such as Michelia crassipes Y. W. Law, are used as ornamental plants and to obtain essences. [1]. M. crassipes Y. W. Law, a small evergreen shrub tree in Magnoliaceae, is a great ornamental plant with fragrant and dark purple flowers. It became a useful cross-breeding germplasm resource. Field observation in Changsha (China) indicated that its flowers started blooming in late March and continued into early May for about 50 days [2]. In the course of screening for biologically and chemically novel agents from Formosan Magnoliaceous plants [3\u20137], M. crassipes was chosen for further phytochemical investigation. The compounds derived from the stems include one oxoaporphine, liriodenine (1) [8]; four benzenoids, vanillic acid (2) [9], vanillin (3) [10], p-hydroxybenzoic acid (4) [10], and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5) [11]; two amides, N-trans-feruloyltyramine (6) [12] and N-cis-feruloyltyramine (7) [13]; one cyclitol, (\u2013)-liriodendritol (8) [14]. The newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a serious threat to human health. COVID-19 is a pandemic disease worldwide and is resulted in millions of deaths and caused rampant economic damage worldwide [15, 16]. Therefore, it is very important to develop the drug against COVID-19. We chose the 3C-like protease (3CL protease) of SARS-CoV-2 which is crucial in viral replication, as our strategy to develop the compound [17, 18]. The inhibitory of efficient potential compounds were screened by protease activity assay. The 100 \u03bcM compounds 1\u20138 or PBS were incubated with 40 nM 3CL protease of COVID-19 for 30 min at RT, followed by the addition of the 10-\u03bcM SARS-CoV2 substrate for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. The fluorescence intensity was determined to monitor the protease activity. As shown in Table 1, the Protease activity of 3CL protease of COVID-19 could efficiently inhibit via all of our compounds. The results show the inhibitory ability of vanillin acid (2), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (5), and (\u2013)-liriodendritol (8), which have the potential to be developed to the anti-COVID-19 drugs. These results indicated that the 2, 5, and 8 of M. crassipes could specifically and efficiently inhibit the protease activity of 3CL protease of COVID-19. The stems of M. crassipes Y. W. Law were collected from New Taipei City, Taiwan, May 2016. Plant material was identified by Prof. Fu-Yuan Lu (Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, College of Agriculture, National Chiayi University). A voucher specimen was deposited in the School of Medical and Health Sciences, Fooyin University, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The air-dried stems of M. crassipes (1.4 kg) were extracted with MeOH (5 L \u00d7 3) at room temperature and a MeOH extract (22.8 g) was obtained upon concentration under reduced pressure. The MeOH extract was chromatographed over silica gel (800 g, 70\u2013230 mesh) using n-hexane\u2013EtOAc\u2013MeOH mixtures as eluents to produce five fractions.\nDOI 10.1007/s10600-023-03997-7\nPart of fraction 1 (5.2 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography by eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (70:1), enriched gradually with MeOH, to furnish five fractions (1-1\u20131-5). Fraction 1-2 (1.1 g) was further purified on a silica gel column using CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH mixtures to obtain 6 (11 mg) and 7 (6 mg). Part of fraction 2 (6.6 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography, by eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (50:1), enriched gradually with MeOH, to furnish five fractions (2-1\u20132-5). Fraction 2-2 (1.6 g) was further purified on a silica gel column using CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH mixtures to obtain 4 (13 mg) and 5 (9 mg). Part of fraction 3 (4.8 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography by eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (40:1), enriched with MeOH to furnish four further fractions (3-1\u20133-4). Fraction 3-2 (1.2 g) was further purified on a silica gel column using CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH mixtures to obtain 2 (22 mg) and 3 (16 mg). Part of fraction 4 (6.8 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography by eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (30:1), enriched with MeOH to furnish four further fractions (4-1\u20134-4). Fraction 4-2 (1.8 g) was further purified on a silica gel column using CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH mixtures to obtain 1 (28 mg). Part of fraction 5 (5.1 g) was subjected to silica gel chromatography by eluting with CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH (25:1), enriched with MeOH to furnish five further fractions (5-1\u20135-5). Fraction 5-3 (2.4 g) was further purified on a silica gel column using CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH mixtures to obtain 8 (36 mg).

The 100 \u03bcM compounds or PBS were incubated with 40 nM 3CL protease of COVID-19 in an aqueous cleavage buffer (200 mMTris [pH 9.0], 20% glycerol) for 30 min at RT, followed by the addition of the 10\u03bcM SARS-CoV2 substrate for 60 min at 37\u00b0C.
