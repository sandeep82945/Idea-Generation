Logistic regression analysis was employed to establish a prediction model for lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer. We evaluated the performance of the model using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and decision analysis curves.\nResults Our analysis revealed that among the 368 patients in the training set, 101 patients (27.4%) had undergone lymph node metastasis. Maximum tumor diameter, multifocal tumor, and Ki67 level were identified as independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve in the training set was 0.837 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.792\u20130.881); in the validation set this value was 0.814 (95% CI: 0.744\u20130.884). Calibration plots and decision analysis curves revealed good calibration and clinical application value.\nConclusions We successfully developed a model for predicting lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer, based on ultrasound examination results and clinical data. Our model accurately identified patients at high risk of lymph node metastasis and may guide the selection of appropriate treatment strategies. This model has the potential to significantly enhance the precision and efficacy of clinical management in patients with ovarian cancer."

            "text": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, with approximately 313,000 new cases and 207,000 deaths in 2020, making it the third leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies [1]. Like most gynecological malignancies, the lymphatic system provides the primary route for ovarian cancer metastasis; the incidence of lymph node metastasis is lower in early- than in late-stage disease [2]. Lymph node status significantly affects the survival of patients with ovarian cancer and is an important factor in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) ovarian cancer staging system [3]. Ovarian cancer with lymph node metastasis is usually classified as stage III or higher and has a poorer prognosis. Lymph node dissection is an effective method of identifying lymph node metastasis and can therefore influence disease staging and prognosis, and guide treatment [4]. However, lymph node dissection in patients with ovarian cancer remains controversial, as it increases surgical duration and risk and may cause serious postoperative complications such as lower limb lymphedema and pelvic lymphatic cysts with accompanying infections [5]. It has been reported that 14.2% of patients with early-stage and 44\u201353% of patients with late-stage ovarian cancer may have lymph node metastasis [6]. Therefore, although determining lymph node status is important for ovarian cancer staging, not all patients require lymph node dissection.\nOver the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made to develop accurate preoperative and intraoperative methods for identifying lymph node metastasis. Several models based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have demonstrated significant predictive value [7]. However, CT does not provide sufficient accuracy for the prediction of lymph node metastasis, with a sensitivity of 48\u201380% [8]. MRI has a similar efficacy, with the additional disadvantage of increased examination costs. Positron emission tomography-CT can improve the staging accuracy, but has a high false positive rate [8]. Ultrasonography is the firstline imaging method for diagnosing ovarian masses with a high level of accuracy [9]. Furthermore, it is an inexpensive and safe procedure that does not pose a radiation risk to patients and is relatively easy to perform. Despite these advantages, further research is necessary to fully understand its diagnostic capabilities. The purpose of our study was to identify risk factors for lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer using ultrasound examination, in order to guide selection of the appropriate surgical procedure and treatment strategy."

In other words, the model had a high accuracy in distinguishing patients with and without lymph node metastasis. In addition, we used a calibration plot to evaluate the consistency between the predicted probability of lymph node metastasis and the actual occurrence of lymph node metastasis, which showed good calibration (Fig.\u00a0 3C). Finally, we used a decision curve to evaluate the clinical utility of the model (Fig.\u00a0 3E), which showed good utility. We also validated the model using the validation set of patients (n = 157). The ROC curve showed that the application value of the model was retained in the validation set (AUC = 0.814, 95% CI: 0.744\u20130.884; Fig.\u00a03B).

            "text": "In this multicenter study, we established a prediction model based on clinical and ultrasound data to evaluate the risk of lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer. Through univariate and multivariate regression analysis, we identified maximum tumor diameter, multifocal tumor, and Ki67 as independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis; these were included in the model. We evaluated the performance and clinical utility of the model using ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curves and compared it with models using only clinical or ultrasound data. The results showed that the combined model had a greater diagnostic value than either of the individual models.\nOvarian cancer is a common gynecological malignancy, and surgical treatment is usually divided into radical and conservative surgery [11, 12]. In radical surgery, lymph node dissection is performed to treat and prevent ovarian cancer metastasis [13]. However, lymph node dissection also carries certain risks [14\u201316], such as postoperative lymphedema and lower limb deep vein thrombosis. Kleppe et al. [17] reported that the average incidence of lymph node metastasis in clinical stage I-II ovarian cancer was 14.2%. A separate study indicated that only 12.6% of patients with low-grade stage I-II ovarian cancer had\nundergone lymph node metastasis [18]. In our study, only 12 patients (11.9%) with stage I-II disease in the training set and 7 patients (14%) with stage I-II disease in the validation set had lymph node metastasis. Performing lymph node dissection on patients with a very low likelihood of lymph node metastasis may not be beneficial. Therefore, doctors need to evaluate the patient\u2019s specific condition and surgical indications to decide whether to perform lymph node dissection. However, accurately identifying patients with true lymph node metastasis who would benefit from preoperative lymph node dissection is challenging. Predicting whether a patient will have lymph node metastasis before surgery is therefore particularly important.\nResearch on preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis in ovarian cancer has so far failed to find a sufficiently accurate model. Most prediction models are based on clinical data, which are sometimes supplemented by CT or MRI. However, relevant literature indicates that CT and MRI cannot detect cancer in normal-sized lymph nodes, nor can they distinguish between hyperplastic and metastatic lymph nodes [19]. This has contributed to the poor accuracy of existing models in predicting lymph node metastasis. Ultrasound is widely used in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer\nas it is noninvasive and cost-effective. If ultrasound could be used to accurately predict lymph node metastasis, it would have significant clinical implications for patients. However, the combination of ultrasound data with other parameters for detecting lymph node metastasis is rare. In previous studies, age, CA125, Ki67, tumor diameter, histological type, histological grade, menopausal status, and other factors were shown to be associated with lymph node metastasis [20\u201325]. Our research findings were similar to this study; however, in our study, histological type was significant in the univariate but not in the multivariate analysis. We found that maximum tumor diameter, multifocal tumor, and Ki67 level were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the FIGO and TNM stages were previously shown to be closely associated with lymph node metastasis [20, 25]. However, as these stages are evaluated based on lymph node status, we deemed it inappropriate to include them as study variables.\nIn our study, the maximum tumor diameter in the LNM negative group was significantly lower than that in the LNM positive group (81.67 \u00b1 49.22 vs. 110.31 \u00b1 49.02, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size was predictive of lymph node metastasis. As the tumor size increased, the probability of lymph node metastasis also increased. A previous large-scale retrospective analysis of 4,110 patients showed that when the tumor diameter was < 200\u00a0mm, the risk of lymph node metastasis increased with the tumor diameter [26], which is consistent with our results. However, this study also determined that the risk of lymph node metastasis in patients with a tumor diameter > 200\u00a0mm was lower than that in patients with a tumor diameter of 150 ~ < 200\u00a0mm. This anomaly may be due to the transformation of tumor\ndiameter from measurement data to count data, leading to the loss of some statistical information. In addition, we found that the risk of lymph node metastasis was higher in multifocal than in single tumors. This is not surprising, as most multifocal tumors have higher invasiveness and malignancy than single tumors, and a greater likelihood of distant metastasis [27]. Moreover, this is an advantage of using ultrasound examination, as it can quickly identify multifocal tumors and determine the presence of suspicious metastatic lesions in the pelvis and abdomen. The expression level of Ki67 is widely used to predict the growth rate and potential malignancy of tumors [28]. Generally, a higher Ki67 level indicated increased tumor cell activity, leading to a faster rate of tumor growth and a greater potential for malignancy [29]. Our study results showed that Ki67 is a risk factor for lymph node metastasis, which is consistent with previous studies [3, 4].\nWe also established separate prediction models based on ultrasound examination or clinical data alone, and the results showed that the predictive power of the ultrasound examination-only model was superior to that of the clinical-only model, although both were inferior to the combined model. This highlighted the value of ultrasound examination in predicting lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer. The high AUC of the ultrasound model (AUC = 0.809, 95% CI: 0.759\u20130.858) indicated that the risk of lymph node metastasis in patients could be accurately predicted using noninvasive ultrasound examination. In addition, we used data from multiple medical centers, with a relatively large sample size. The prediction model based on ultrasound examination results and clinical data showed good accuracy in both the training and validation sets, indicating that our model has a good predictive value. Our study results\ncan provide an important reference for the determination of lymph node metastasis in patients with ovarian cancer, which impacts the prognosis and treatment of patients. In our model, maximum tumor diameter, multifocal tumor, and Ki67 level are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Therefore, when examining patients with ovarian cancer, these risk factors should be particularly noted to more accurately evaluate the patient\u2019s risk of lymph node metastasis and develop the best individual treatment plan. The dynamic nomogram established in this study should facilitate the application of our model and thus help physicians make more accurate decisions. It should be noted that Ki67 was often obtained from immunohistochemistry of surgically resected tumor tissue. We recommend using immunohistochemical markers from preoperative biopsy specimens of ovarian cancer for preoperative prediction of LNM.\nIt should be noted that our study has some limitations. First, our study was based on retrospective data analysis, which may have information bias. Second, we conducted only internal and not external validation. Future studies are needed to further validate the nomogram in different populations."
