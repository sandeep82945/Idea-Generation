Quantum sensors based on optically addressable spin defects in bulk semiconductors are typically employed for such purposes, but the 3D crystal structure of the sensor inhibits the sensitivity by limiting the proximity of the defects to the target spins. Here we demonstrate the detection of paramagnetic spins using spin defects hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a van der Waals material which can be exfoliated into the 2D regime. We first create negatively charged boron vacancy (V\u2212B ) defects in a powder of ultrathin hBN nanoflakes (< 10 atomic monolayers thick on average) and measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time (T1) of this system. We then decorate the dry hBN nanopowder with paramagnetic Gd3+ ions and observe a clear T1 quenching, under ambient conditions, consistent with the added magnetic noise. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of performing spin measurements including T1 relaxometry using solution-suspended hBN nanopowder. Our results highlight the potential and versatility of the hBN quantum sensor for a range of sensing applications, and pave the way towards the realisation of a truly 2D, ultrasensitive quantum sensor.\nOptically addressable spin defects in solids have been a significant driver in the advancement of practical applications for highly sensitive quantum measurement and detection devices in a variety of fields including geoscience, materials science, and biology [1\u20134]. One promising capability of solid-state quantum sensors is being able to probe weak, fluctuating magnetic fields under ambient conditions and at sub-micrometer scales, which cannot typically be accessed by existing techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance. The most prominent example of such a nanoscale sensor is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, which has been successfully employed to interrogate magnetic noise from a variety of sources, from magnons in ferromagnetic materials [5, 6] to electric current fluctuations in conductors [7, 8] to paramagnetic spins in molecular systems [9\u201313]. The detection of paramagnetic spins, i.e. unpaired electrons that produce a fast fluctuating magnetic noise, is especially relevant in the chemical, biological and medical sciences. For example, NV-based noise sensing has been applied to detect trace amounts of ions in aqueous solutions [14, 15], monitor the generation of free radicals in cells [16, 17], determine iron load in ferritin proteins [18], and has been proposed as the basis for new methods for rapid and sensitive virus detection [19]. In the latter proposal and similar biosensing demonstrations [19, 20], the biochemical signal of interest (e.g. the presence of a specific viral\n\u2217 jean-philippe.tetienne@rmit.edu.au\nparticle or a change of pH) is transduced into magnetic noise using a paramagnetic molecule, typically a gadolinium (Gd) complex, which is attached to the surface of the quantum sensor.\nThe method of choice in many of these applications is measuring the longitudinal spin relaxation time (T1) of the defect, which is sensitive to magnetic fluctuations at the defect\u2019s spin resonance frequency, \u03c90 [9\u201313]. The change in relaxation rate induced by a nearby paramagnetic spin, \u0393ext1 = 1/T ext 1 , scales with the distance d between the sensor (spin defect) and the target spin as \u0393ext1 \u221d d\u22126 [9, 10]. This strong distance dependence necessitates the defects be located close to the surface of the host crystal, in order to maximise sensitivity to spins located outside. However, spin defects in bulk 3D crystals face a practical limit, as the surface is typically plagued with dangling bonds and other sub-bandgap electronic states which compromise the charge- and photostability of near-surface defects [21\u201323]. For instance, an average minimum depth of at best or greater than d \u2248 5 nm is typically observed for NV ensembles created near an optimised flat diamond surface [24\u201326]. Additionally, these unwanted surface states are often paramagnetic [22, 27] and cause a background magnetic noise obscuring the external signal of interest. These effects are especially severe in nanodiamonds with their high surface-to-volume ratio [10], limiting their practical sensitivity to external signals. Given nanodiamonds are widely used for chemical and bio-sensing applications owing to their convenience and compatibility with inar X iv :2 30 2. 10 56 0v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 1\nFe b\n20 23\n2 solution measurements [12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 28], there is a strong motivation for exploring new quantum sensing systems that may afford shorter sensor-target distances and reduced intrinsic magnetic noise while preserving the versatility of nanodiamonds.\nSpin defects hosted in a layered van der Waals (vdW) material could provide a solution to both of these problems. Indeed, vdW materials can often be exfoliated into atomically thin flakes while maintaining near-perfect crystallinity and defect-free surfaces. As such, it may be possible to engineer robust spin defects that reside within just a few atomic sites from the surface (i.e. d \u2248 1\u22122 nm) and with no surface-induced background magnetic noise, which could open a new frontier in ultrasensitive quantum sensing. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising material platform to realise such ultrathin quantum sensors [29\u201337]. hBN is an exfoliable, air-stable vdW material and is host to a robust, optically addressable spin defect, the negatively charged boron vacancy (V\u2212B) [29, 38]. The V \u2212 B defect can be introduced in the hBN lattice through a variety of irradiation methods [39, 40], and several demonstrations of quantum sensing have subsequently been reported, including the detection and imaging under ambient conditions of static magnetic fields, temperature and strain [30, 33\u201336], and the imaging of magnetic noise from a ferromagnetic material at cryogenic temperatures [37].\nIn this work, we demonstrate the first detection of magnetic noise from paramagnetic spins with an hBN quantum sensor, under ambient conditions. In contrast with previous quantum sensing demonstrations which employed hBN flakes exfoliated from bulk crystals [30, 33\u2013 36], here we use hBN nanopowder, a convenient and cost-effective alternative which enables sensing in a wider range of environments including in solution. We first characterise the spin properties of the V\u2212B defects created in hBN nanopowder, and find the T1 time is comparable to that in a bulk hBN crystal. We then dress the nanopowder with Gd3+ ions, a common paramagnetic contrast agent used in magnetic resonance imaging, and observe a reliable T1 quenching effect which illustrates the ability to detect external noise sources. Finally, we perform spin measurements of the nanopowder suspended in water and again observe a T1 reduction upon adding Gd3+ ions, demonstrating the possibility of in-solution sensing experiments. These results establish hBN nanopowder as a promising platform for magnetic noise sensing applications, and motivate further work to improve the sensitivity of the hBN quantum sensor, including by making hBN flakes approaching the 2D limit. This could make hBN quantum sensors a viable alternative to nanodiamonds for a range of chemical and biosensing applications such as ultrasensitive virus detection and other rapid point-of-care tests.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nOur quantum sensor is based on commercially available hBN nanopowder sourced from Graphene Supermarket. The powder is composed of flake-like particles with a thickness of 6 \u00b1 3 nm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) as determined by atomic force microscopy measurements, and a lateral size of order 100 nm (see SI, Sec. II). The 6 nm mean thickness corresponds to \u2248 9 atomic monolayers. In principle, the size of these nanoflakes can be further reduced through liquid-phase exfoliation [41, 42], making it an ideal candidate to realise quantum sensors approaching the 2D limit (i.e. made up of a single monolayer of hBN). The as-received powder was electron irradiated to create a high density of vacancies throughout the entire material, some of which forming the desired V\u2212B defects [40]. The irradiated powder was used as is, in its dry form, or suspended in water or isopropanol to make powder films by drop-casting or to perform in-solution measurements.\nSpin measurements with hBN nanopowder\nWe first characterised the dry hBN nanopowder following electron irradiation, to establish a baseline of its optical and spin properties. To this end, the powder was placed directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) with a microwave (MW) waveguide to enable driving of the V\u2212B \u2019s electron spin transitions. A schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1(a), and the crystal structure of the V\u2212B defect in Fig. 1(b). Small clumps of hBN nanopowder are visible in the photograph Fig. 1(c), which were imaged using a widefield optical microscope [Fig. 1(d,e)]. The V\u2212B defects are excited with a green laser (\u03bb = 532 nm) and the resulting photoluminescence (PL) in the near-infrared (\u03bb = 750 \u2212 900 nm) imaged by a camera [Fig. 1(e)], showing uniform PL across the clump. The ground state of the V\u2212B defect is a spin triplet (S = 1) which is polarised into the |0\u3009 state upon laser excitation [Fig. 1(f)]. When left in the dark, this unequal population distribution decays back to thermal equilibrium (an equal mixture of all three spin states |0,\u00b11\u3009) at a rate \u03931 = 1/T1 [43]. In general, the total relaxation rate is the sum of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, \u03931 = \u0393 int 1 + \u0393 ext 1 , where \u0393 ext 1 may be caused e.g. by paramagnetic spins external to the hBN crystal, as we will demonstrate later. Importantly, the spin state can be read out optically owing to spin-dependent PL [29], which will allow \u03931 to be measured. Moreover, by applying a MW field of variable frequency, an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum can be obtained [Fig. 1(g)], revealing a broad resonance at \u03c90 \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3.45 GHz corresponding to the electronic spin transitions |0\u3009 \u2192 |\u00b11\u3009. The 2% spin contrast obtained in this pulsed-ODMR spectrum is in line with previous reports on similar powders [32].\n3\nIntrinsic T1 time\nTo assess the viability of the hBN nanopowder for T1based magnetic noise sensing, we first characterised the intrinsic T1 time of the dry powder. The measurement sequence is depicted in Fig. 2(a) and consists of laser pulses, required to initialise and read out the spin state, separated by a dark time \u03c4 during which a T1 decay takes place. A reference measurement including a resonant MW pulse is performed to remove common-mode variations and extract the spin imbalance, which decays towards zero as \u03c4 is increased, as shown in the example decay curves in Fig. 2(b). Here, the PL data is integrated from a 15\u00d7 15\u00b5m2 region of powder which is uniformly illuminated by the laser. We found the curves are generally well fit by a mono-exponential function, e\u2212\u03c4/T1 , from which T1 is obtained (see further analysis details in the SI, Sec. IV).\nIn Fig. 2(b), two types of powder are measured and compared to a large (\u223c 100\u00b5m) flake exfoliated from a high-purity bulk hBN crystal (PL image shown as inset of\nFig. 2(b)). Powder 1 received the lowest electron irradiation dose (2\u00d71018 cm\u22122) and returns T1 = 19.5\u00b10.8\u00b5s (here the uncertainty corresponds to the standard error from the fit). For powder 2, the irradiation dosage was increased by 2.5\u00d7 to 5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 and T1 was measured as T1 = 17.6 \u00b1 0.6\u00b5s. For the bulk crystal, which was electron irradiated to the same dose as powder 1, T1 was slightly lower, T1 = 14.0\u00b10.8\u00b5s. The small differences in T1 may be due to different levels of crystal damage, as was suggested by Guo et al. [44]; here we speculate that the powder may experience less damage than the bulk crystal at the same nominal irradiation dose due to more efficient thermalisation during the irradiation process. Importantly, the T1 values measured for our nanopowders, despite a mean flake thickness of only 6 nm, are comparable to the value reported by Gottschol et al. [43] for a neutron-irradiated bulk crystal (T1 = 18\u00b5s), which is the largest T1 value reported to date for V \u2212 B at room temperature. Thus, nanopowders appear as an ideal platform for T1-based sensing, available in much higher volume and at a lower cost compared to flakes made from bulk\n4 crystals.\nWe also assessed possible T1 spatial variations across a clump of hBN powder. A T1 map is shown in Fig. 2(c) for a typical clump, with the corresponding PL image shown in Fig. 2(d). The measured T1 is found to be relatively uniform across the clump, with a standard deviation of about 1\u00b5s comparable with the uncertainty from the fitting of individual pixels. On a larger scale,\nwe observed slightly larger variations up to \u00b110% for the mean T1 of distinct clumps of powder of the same type, and from different spatial locations within a continuous film of powder (as we will see in Fig. 3). Such variations may be due to local temperature variations (as laser and MW absorption leads to some amount of heating) or reflect measurement and analysis uncertainties, see Sec. IV and V of the SI for further discussions. In the following, we will study T1 changes caused by external magnetic signals, keeping all measurement conditions constant otherwise.\nDetection of external paramagnetic spins\nWe now test the possibility of detecting external paramagnetic spins with the hBN nanopowder, by adding a solution of gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3). Due to the high spin of the Gd3+ ion (S = 72 ), gadolinium complexes are commonly used as paramagnetic relaxation agents in magnetic resonance imaging. To allow for systematic measurements, we first prepare a uniform film of hBN nanopowder by suspending the powder [powder 2 from Fig. 2(b)] in isopropanol and drop-casting onto a MW waveguide [Fig. 3(a)]. A series of T1 measurements are made at multiple random locations along the waveguide to gather a reference distribution of T1 times, giving the top histogram in Fig. 3(b). The mean value is T1 = 16.3\u00b11.3\u00b5s where here the error bar corresponds to the standard deviation from the histogram. The spread is consistent with the variation of up to \u00b110% observed and discussed previously in relation to Fig. 2.\nFollowing these reference measurements, a drop of GdCl3 solution is deposited on the hBN film and allowed to percolate through the powder. Evaporation of the water by heating then leaves the hBN nanoflakes surrounded by a highly concentrated medium of paramagnetic Gd3+ ions. Example relaxation curves before and after adding Gd3+ are plotted in Fig. 3(c), showing a clear T1 reduction upon adding Gd3+. Repeating the measurements at multiple locations [bottom histogram in Fig. 3(b)], we find that all T1 values measured are shorter compared to the bare powder, with a mean value of T1 = 11.3\u00b11.2\u00b5s, a 30% reduction, significantly larger than the . 10% uncertainty. This T1 reduction corresponds to an additional relaxation rate of \u0393ext1 = 30 \u00b1 10 kHz. Furthermore, we performed successive T1 measurements (one every 5 s) at a given location and found T1 to be stable over many minutes of monitoring [Fig. 3(d)], with again a clear offset in the presence of Gd3+. Combined, these results indicate a robust T1 quenching effect by the Gd\n3+ spins. Note, we repeated these experiments with higher concentrations of the GdCl3 solution, and by applying multiple doses of the solution, and found a similar level of T1 quenching in all cases, suggesting that the resulting density of Gd3+ spins around the hBN flakes has reached a saturation. On the other hand, repeating the process using pure water or a highly diluted GdCl3 solution led to no\n5\nmeasurable change in T1.\nTo verify the observed T1 reduction is consistent with magnetic noise from the Gd3+ spins, we assume each hBN nanoflake is surrounded by pure GdCl3 and contain V\u2212B defects located at a distance d from either surface of the flake of thickness 2d (see Sec. VI of the SI). The Gd3+ spins produce a randomly fluctuating magnetic field with a correlation time \u03c4c, which increases the relaxation rate of the V\u2212B spins by [9, 10]\n\u0393ext1 = 3\u03b3 2 eB 2 \u22a5 \u03c4c 1 + \u03c920\u03c4 2 c , (1)\nwhere \u03b3e is the electron gyromagnetic ratio and B 2 \u22a5 is the variance in the transverse magnetic field experienced by the V\u2212B spins. \u0393 ext 1 is maximised when \u03c4c = 1/\u03c90 \u2248 50 ps, which is a typical order of magnitude for Gd3+ complexes [9]. Assuming this maximum effect, we find the observed \u0393ext1 is reproduced for a flake thickness of 2d \u2248 10 nm, in good agreement with the 6\u00b1 3 nm thickness of our flakes. This supports our claim that the observed T1 quenching is caused by the magnetic noise from the added Gd3+ spins.\nSpin measurements in solution\nMany applications of T1-based sensing involve a liquid environment, for instance detecting ions and viruses in aqueous solutions [14, 15, 19] or free radicals in cells [16, 17], or to measure the pH of a solution [20]. To test the sensing capabilities of hBN in a wet environment, we performed spin measurements of the nanopowder suspended in water. First, a drop of the hBN solution was placed on a MW waveguide and a pulsed-ODMR spectrum recorded [Fig. 4(a)]. As shown in the photographs Fig. 4(b), the solution has a white opaque appearance, such that the collected PL signal must initially come from the top-most part of the colloidal suspension. The water was found to evaporate completely after a few minutes of continuous measurement, leaving behind a dry hBN powder film [Fig. 4(c)]. Comparing the ODMR spectra taken before and after evaporation [Fig. 4(a)], we see that while the contrast remains relatively unchanged (\u2248 1%), the resonance is shifted towards lower frequencies by \u2248 50 MHz upon evaporation. This decrease in \u03c90, which here corresponds to the zero-field splitting parameter of the V\u2212B spin, implies an increase in local temper-\n6\nature of \u2248 70 K [30, 32]. The rapid evaporation followed by a dramatic temperature increase can be explained by the presence of significant heating due to local laser and MW absorption, which is initially dissipated as latent heat during the evaporation phase thus keeping the solution relatively cool, until the water has fully evaporated.\nTo facilitate in-situ addition of paramagnetic spins to the solution and T1 measurements over extended periods of time, we next moved to a setup based on an inverted microscope configuration [Fig. 4(d)]. The hBN suspension is deposited on a glass coverslip which comprises an \u2126-shaped MW waveguide. Because optical addressing occurs from below, the collected PL signal comes primarily from the hBN flakes that are closest to the glass-solution interface, and so it is possible to address a region located very close to the MW waveguide, thus requiring a significantly reduced MW power. To further reduce the heating induced by the measurements, we used shorter laser pulses and a lower laser peak power. As a result, we were able to perform T1 measurements continuously for up to an hour before complete evaporation of the water, although at the cost of a reduced signal-to-noise ratio \u2013 in future, a cuvette-based setup could be employed to allow optimised, long-term measurements [45]. As a test experiment, we monitored the T1 time of the hBN flakes initially suspended in pure water, before adding a solution of 100 mM GdCl3 [Fig. 4(e)]. A small reduction in T1 is observed upon addition of the GdCl3 solution, corresponding to an added relaxation rate of \u0393ext1 = 10 \u00b1 10 kHz. While the observed T1 change is close to the measurement uncertainty, these experiments demonstrate the feasibility of in-solution magnetic noise sensing with hBN nanopowder. Note, the induced quenching \u0393ext1 is smaller than that observed in Fig. 3,\nwhich is expected since here the density of Gd3+ ions is reduced due to the presence of solvent molecules. Using higher concentrations of Gd3+ ions led to additional background PL which made the T1 measurements unreliable.\nSensitivity\nThe key motivation for developing quantum sensors based on vdW materials is the potential for a drastically reduced minimum distance d between sensor (spin defects) and target (e.g. paramagnetic spins), compared to 3D hosts like diamond. In the present work, for our initial demonstration of external paramagnetic spin detection, we used commercially available, off-the-shelf hBN nanopowders which had a flake thickness of 6 \u00b1 3 nm, meaning the sensing defects are located at most 5 nm from the closest surface (for the thickest flakes), which is already an improvement over state-of-the-art experiments based on NV ensembles in diamond [24\u201326]. Furthermore, there is ample room for optimisation of the hBN sensor, in particular liquid-phase exfoliation methods should provide a straightforward way to produce even thinner hBN flakes (a few or even a single monolayer) in large quantities [41, 42]. While there has been no report of V\u2212B defects in monolayer hBN to date, V \u2212 B defects have been successfully detected in flakes as thin as 4 nm [46] while still exhibiting ODMR, implying the defects are within 2 nm (i.e. 3 atomic layers) of the closest surface. Compared to an NV centre at d = 5 nm (typical minimum depth observed [24\u201326]), a V\u2212B defect at d = 2 nm would increase the relaxation rate \u0393ext1 induced by a paramagnetic spin located at the surface by\n7 a factor (5/2)6 = 244, already a dramatic improvement. Nevertheless, a potential gain in \u0393ext1 due to better proximity does not guarantee an improved sensitivity to external spins. In a photon-shot-noise-limited T1relaxometry experiment, the signal-to-noise ratio scales as [9, 10]\nSNR \u221d \u0393 ext 1\u221a \u0393int1 C \u221a IPL, (2)\nwhere \u0393int1 = 1/T int 1 is the intrinsic relaxation rate in the absence of the target spin (assumed to satisfy \u0393int1 \u0393ext1 ), C is the relative spin contrast, and IPL is the PL signal from one readout pulse. Currently, the V\u2212B defect exhibits an inferior contrast and PL output compared to the NV centre, and so will need to be improved through material optimisation or photonics engineering to enhance collection [31, 46, 47]. On the other hand, the intrinsic relaxation time observed in this work for V\u2212B in hBN nanopowders (T int 1 \u2248 15 \u2212 20\u00b5s) is similar to that of NVs in nanodiamonds of comparable size [10], which do not reach the longer relaxation times exhibited by NVs in bulk diamond but nevertheless have found widespread interest. Considering all these factors together, hBN nanopowders emerge as a viable alternative to nanodiamonds for T1 relaxometry with the potential for an improved sensitivity to external paramagnetic spins and a lower production cost, making it appealing for applications such as high-sensitivity point-of-care diagnostics [19, 28].\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we demonstrated the first detection of magnetic noise from paramagnetic spins under ambient conditions using a van der Waals quantum sensor, namely using optically addressable spin defects (V\u2212B defects) in hBN nanopowders. We first characterised the intrinsic\nspin relaxation time (T1) of the V \u2212 B defects in nanopowders, which was found to be comparable to that in bulk hBN crystals. We then observed a reduction in T1 upon the addition of paramagnetic Gd3+ ions, in dry conditions, demonstrating the ability to detect external noise sources. Finally, we performed spin measurements using the hBN nanopowder suspended in water, demonstrating the feasibility of in-solution sensing experiments. The sensitivity of the hBN quantum sensor for the detection of paramagnetic spins was discussed, and with further improvements (in particular, approaching the 2D limit for the host hBN flakes) could be competitive with established quantum sensing platforms such the NV centre in diamond. Our results thus suggest hBN nanopowders could be a viable and potentially more convenient and cost-effective alternative to diamond-based sensors, making it appealing for a range of chemical and biosensing applications such as ultrasensitive virus detection and other rapid point-of-care tests.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through grants CE170100012, CE200100010, FT200100073, DE200100279 and FT220100053, and by the Office of Naval Research Global (N62909-22-1-2028).

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe optical and spin measurements reported in the main text were carried out on a custom-built wide-field fluorescence microscope. Optical excitation from a continuous-wave (CW) \u03bb = 532 nm laser (Laser Quantum Opus 2 W) was gated using an acousto-optic modulator (Gooch & Housego R35085-5) and focused using a widefield lens (f = 400 mm) to the back apearture of the objective lens (Nikon S Plan Fluor ELWD 20x, NA = 0.45). The photoluminescence (PL) from the V \u2212B defects is separated from the excitation light with a dichroic mirror and filtered using a 750 nm longpass filter before being imaged using a tube lens (f = 300 mm) onto a scientific CMOS camera (Andor Zyla 5.5-W USB3). In all experiments except Fig. 4(d,e) of the main text, the laser spot diameter (1/e2) at the sample was about 50\u00b5m and the total CW laser power 500 mW, which gives a maximum intensity of about 0.5 mW/\u00b5m2 in the centre of the spot. In Fig. 4(d,e), the laser power was reduced to 200 mW.\nMicrowave (MW) excitation was provided by a signal generator (Windfreak SynthNV PRO) gated using an IQ modulator (Texas Instruments TRF37T05EVM) and amplified (Mini-Circuits HPA-50W-63+). A pulse pattern generator (SpinCore PulseBlasterESR-PRO 500 MHz) was used to gate the excitation laser and MW and to synchronise the image acquisition. The output of the amplifier was connected to the printed circuit board (PCB) which was terminated by a 50 \u2126 termination. In all experiments except Fig. 4(d,e) of the main text, MW driving was achieved via a coplanar waveguide built in the PCB, with the hBN powder deposited directly onto the surface of the waveguide. In Fig. 4(d,e), the MW was delivered by an \u2126-shaped resonator fabricated onto a glass coverslip mounted on a PCB, with the hBN suspension deposited on the coverslip. All measurements were performed at room temperature in ambient atmosphere.\nII. SAMPLE PREPARATION\nAll experiments performed in this work [except the bulk crystal measurement in Fig. 2(b)] used hBN nanopowder sourced from Graphene Supermarket (BN Ultrafine Powder). As the as-received powder contained no measurable concentration of V\u2212B defects, we subjected the powder to electron irradiation with a beam energy of 2 MeV. The irradiation dose was 2\u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 (called \u2018powder 1\u2019 in the main text) or 5\u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 (\u2018powder 2\u2019). PL spectra of the different powders under \u03bb = 532 nm excitation [Fig. S1] show the appearance of the characteristic V\u2212B emission upon irradiation, i.e. a broad peak centred around 800 nm wavelength [29].

S1. PL spectra of the hBN nanopowder following different electron irradiation conditions: no irradiation (as received), 2\u00d71018 cm\u22122 dose (\u2018powder 1\u2019), and 5\u00d71018 cm\u22122 (\u2018powder 2\u2019). These spectra were obtained with the same setup as described in Sec. I, with 500 mW of laser power over a 50\u00b5m spot, except that the PL emission was passed through a 550 nm longpass filter to block the laser light and sent to a spectrometer (Ocean Insight Maya2000-Pro).\n2 For the experiments in Fig. 1 and 2 of the main text, the irradiated powder was transferred to the PCB with the tip of a pair of tweezers, forming large clumps (10\u2019s of \u00b5m in size). For the experiments in Fig. 3 of the main text, the irradiated powder was suspended in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at a concentration of 20 mg/mL and sonicated for 30 min using a horn-sonicator. The sediment from the suspension was drawn using a pipette, then drop cast on the PCB, forming a relatively continuous film. For the experiments in Fig. 4 of the main text, the powder was suspended in water (20 mg/mL) and a drop of the suspension was deposited on the PCB [Fig. 4(a-c)] or on the coverslip [Fig. 4(d,e)].\nTo characterise the size of the hBN nanoflakes, we performed atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements of powder 2. The particle stock suspension (20 mg/mL in IPA) was diluted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL, sonicated for 10 min in a sonication bath, centrifuged at 1000 rcf for 1 min to remove large aggregates, and the supernatant was spin coated at 2000 rpm onto a clean silicon wafer. AFM images were acquired using an Oxford Instruments Asylum Research MFP-3D Infinity AFM in AC mode using a Budget Sensors Tap300AL-G probe. The images were collected at a scan rate of 1 Hz. A typical AFM image is shown in Fig. S2(a), where isolated flakes are visibe. The images were analysed to extract the average thickness of each individual flake, excluding all large particle aggregates, giving the histogram Fig. S2(b). The flake thickness ranges mainly between 2 nm and 9 nm, with a mean value of 6 nm and a standard deviation of 3 nm. The lateral size of the flakes is of the order of 100 nm. These values are consistent with previous measurements of powder from the same manufacturer [42]. They are also consistent with the specific surface area of \u223c 20 m2/g measured by the manufacturer.

S2. (a) Typical AFM image of hBN nanoflakes spin-coated onto a silicon wafer. (b) Histogram of the average hBN particle height.\nFor the T1 quenching experiments reported in Fig. 3 and 4 of the main text, a solution of GdCl3 was first prepared by dissolving GdCl3 solid powder (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99% purity) in water to a concentration of 100 mM. A drop of the solution was then deposited on the hBN film. The PCB was then heated immediately to 80\u25e6C for 5 min to evaporate any remaining water. We note that the density of the hBN nanopowder in dry form is 0.30 g/cm3 according to the manufacturer, which is 7 times less than the density of bulk hBN (2.1 g/cm3). This indicates that the dry powder forms a largely porous medium. We conjecture that the GdCl3 solution percolates through the hBN film in such a way that most individual hBN flakes are completely surrounded by GdCl3 upon solvent evaporation, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 3(b).\nFinally, the bulk crystal measurement in Fig. 2(b) was done using a high-purity crystal purchased from HQ Graphene. The crystal was electron irradiated to a dose of 2 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 with a beam energy of 2 MeV. Following irradiation, a \u223c 1\u00b5m-thick flake was exfoliated using scotch tape and transferred to a quartz coverslip placed on a PCB with a MW waveguide. To avoid possible edge effects, the T1 time was measured near the centre of the flake where the PL from the V\u2212B defects was uniform.\nIII. DATA ACQUISITION\nThe spin measurements reported in the main text were obtained using the wide-field setup described in Sec I. For optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra, the pulse sequence was typically: 0.5\u00b5s laser pulse, 0.5\u00b5s wait time, 30 ns MW pulse (corresponding to a \u03c0 spin flip as estimated from a Rabi measurement). This sequence was\n3 repeated thousands of times to fill the exposure time of the camera, generally set to 10 ms. The MW frequency was swept such that one camera frame is recorded for each MW frequency value, with a reference frame with the MW off recorded every other frame to remove common-mode noise \u2013 forming a normalised ODMR spectrum (PL with MW on divided by PL with MW off) such as that shown in Fig. 1(g). The MW sweep was repeated tens to hundreds of times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), corresponding to several minutes of acquisition per spectrum. T1 measurements were obtained by applying a series of laser pulses separated by a variable dark time \u03c4 . For each \u03c4 value, the base pulse sequence (laser pulse, wait time \u03c4 , optional MW pulse) was repeated N = tcam/t0 times where t0 is the duration of the base sequence with the shortest \u03c4 , and tcam = 10 ms is the minimum camera exposure time. As \u03c4 is increased, we keep N fixed and increase the camera exposure time accordingly. For each \u03c4 value, a camera frame is acquired without the MW pulse (\u2018signal\u2019), followed by a camera frame with the MW pulse (\u2018reference\u2019). Example PL traces S(\u03c4) and R(\u03c4) thus obtained (without and with the MW pulse, respectively), are shown in Fig. S3(a). The reference trace serves to remove common-mode variations and normalise the data, as will be discussed in Sec. IV B. The entire \u03c4 sweep is repeated over several minutes to improve the SNR in the same way we do for ODMR measurements.\nThe laser pulse acts as both initialisation and readout of the V\u2212B spin state. Its duration (between 0.5\u00b5s and 4\u00b5s in our experiments) is chosen long enough to initialise the spin in the |0\u3009 state with sufficient fidelity as appropriate for T1 measurements while preserving a good spin contrast, as will be discussed in Sec. IV C. The MW pulse was around 30 ns long typically, corresponding to a \u03c0 spin flip as estimated from a Rabi measurement. The dark time \u03c4 was defined as the time between consecutive laser pulses, inclusive of the MW pulse time when present. The timing of the MW pulse was adjusted to account for the delay incurred by the AOM, such that the MW pulse occurred immediately prior to the laser pulse. For all T1 measurements presented in the paper, 51 \u03c4 points are collected between 2\u00b5s to 60\u00b5s with exponentially weighted spacing, where we excluded the \u03c4 = 0\u22122\u00b5s range to allow the system to fully relax to its electronic ground state.\nExcept in Fig. 2(c) where the T1 data was analysed pixel by pixel to form a spatial map of T1, all ODMR and T1 measurements reported integrated the data over a 15 \u00d7 15\u00b5m2 area where the laser intensity was approximately uniform.\nIV. ANALYSIS OF T1 MEASUREMENTS\nA. Population dynamics in the dark\nIn order to analyse the T1 measurements, we consider a simple three-level system corresponding to the three spin states |0,\u00b11\u3009 of the spin-1 system [see main text Fig. 1(f)]. In the dark (no laser), |0\u3009 and |\u00b11\u3009 are coupled by a two-way transition rate k01 = kint + kext which captures both intrinsic (kint) and external (kext) contributions [7, 10]. For simplicity we assume that there is no coupling between |+1\u3009 and |\u22121\u3009, which is valid if the relaxation dynamics is dominated by magnetic effects rather than electric or phonon processes [7, 48, 49]. In Ref. [43], a strong temperature dependence of T1 was observed for the V \u2212 B defect indicating a thermally activated process, but the exact mechanism remains unclear \u2013 one possibility is that T1 relaxation is primarily due to magnetic noise from the electron spin bath with a temperature-dependent correlation time [50].\nTo determine the population dynamics in the dark, we solve the matrix rate equation \u2202t\u03c1 = \u03a6\u03c1 where \u03a6 is the transition rate matrix and \u03c1 is the population density matrix with elements \u03c10(t), \u03c1+1(t), and \u03c1\u22121(t), which describe the time-dependent populations of the individual states in the spin-1 system. Under the above-mentioned assumption, the transition rate matrix is,\n\u03a6 = \u2212k01 k01 0k01 \u22122k01 k01 0 k01 \u2212k01  . (S1) Solving the matrix rate equation with initial populations \u03c10(0), \u03c1+1(0), and \u03c10(0), gives\n\u03c10(t) = 1\n3 +\n[ \u03c10(0)\u2212 1\n3\n] e\u22123k01t (S2)\n\u03c1\u00b11(t) = 1 3 \u2212 1 2\n[ \u03c10(0)\u2212 1\n3\n] e\u22123k01t \u00b1 1\n2\n[ \u03c1+1(0)\u2212 \u03c1\u22121(0) ] e\u2212k01t . (S3)\nBy convention, T1 is defined as the characteristic decay time out of the |0\u3009 state, i.e. the decay in the population of \u03c10(t); thus,\n1 T1 = 3k01.\n4 FIG. S3. (a) Typical raw traces S(\u03c4) and R(\u03c4) (called signal and reference, respectively) obtained from a T1 measurement. The inset shows the pulse sequence in each case, where the reference measurement includes a MW \u03c0 pulse prior to the laser readout pulse. (b) Normalised relaxation curve deduced from the raw traces in (a) using Eq. S9. The solid line is a mono-exponential fit used to extract a value for T1.\nB. PL normalisation\nExperimentally, T1 is estimated via the PL emitted by the V \u2212 B defects following a dark time \u03c4 , as the PL depends on the spin state owing to an intersystem crossing [29]. One can write the PL intensity measured in a T1 experiment as the sum\nI(\u03c4) = IB(\u03c4) +A0(\u03c4)\u03c10(\u03c4) +A1(\u03c4) [ \u03c1\u22121(\u03c4) + \u03c1+1(\u03c4) ] (S4)\nwhere IB is the background (spin-independent) PL, and A0 and A1 are the PL rates associated with the |0\u3009 and |\u00b11\u3009 states, respectively. In Eq. S4, we included a \u03c4 dependence in all the constants to highlight the importance of the choice of normalisation method [23, 51], discussed below.\nAs described in Sec. III, the experimental data set comprises a \u2018signal\u2019 trace S(\u03c4) and a \u2018reference\u2019 trace R(\u03c4), corresponding to the PL measured without and with a MW \u03c0 pulse following the dark time \u03c4 , respectively. To obtain equations for S(\u03c4) and R(\u03c4), we substitute in the expressions for the population densities with corresponding initial populations which assume the laser perfectly initialises the |0\u3009 state and the MW pulse perfectly swaps the |0\u3009 and |\u00b11\u3009 populations:\nS(\u03c4) = IB(\u03c4) +\n( A0(\u03c4) + 2A1(\u03c4)\n3\n)[ 1 + 2 ( A0(\u03c4)\u2212A1(\u03c4) A0(\u03c4) + 2A1(\u03c4) ) e\u2212 \u03c4 T1 ] (S5)\nR(\u03c4) = IB(\u03c4) +\n( A0(\u03c4) + 2A1(\u03c4)\n3\n)[ 1\u2212 ( A0(\u03c4)\u2212A1(\u03c4) A0(\u03c4) + 2A1(\u03c4) ) e\u2212 \u03c4 T1 ] (S6)\nTo simplify and generalise we rewrite in terms of the spin-related PL IS = [A0 +2A1]/3 and the contrast C1 = \u22122C2 = 2[A0 \u2212A1]/[A0 + 2A1]:\nS(\u03c4) = IB(\u03c4) + IS(\u03c4) [ 1 + C1(\u03c4)e\u2212 \u03c4 T1 ] (S7)\nR(\u03c4) = IB(\u03c4) + IS(\u03c4) [ 1 + C2(\u03c4)e\u2212 \u03c4 T1 ] . (S8)\nTwo relevant cases allow T1 to be extracted exactly [23]. First, if the product ISC1 = 2[A0 \u2212A1]/3 is constant (i.e. independent of \u03c4), then subtraction of R(\u03c4) from S(\u03c4) gives a simple exponential decay\nN (\u03c4) := S(\u03c4)\u2212R(\u03c4) = ISCe \u2212\u03c4 T1 (S9)\nwhere C = C1 \u2212 C2. The T1 time can thus be estimated via an exponential fit to the normalised data N (\u03c4). This method is valid provided the absolute spin contrast A0 \u2212 A1 is independent of \u03c4 , which may not be the case in\n5 the presence of charge population relaxation during the dark time \u03c4 . Such charge dynamics have been reported in experiments with diamond NV centres [23, 51], but there has been no report of charge relaxation in the V\u2212B system. We note that Eq. S9 remains valid even if the MW pulse is imperfect (i.e. it causes only a partial swap of populations) and for arbitrary initial populations, as these effects simply change the values of C1 and C2.\nAlternatively, if the background PL is negligible (IB IS), then we can normalise the data as follows:\nN \u2032(\u03c4) := S(\u03c4)\u2212R(\u03c4) S(\u03c4) +R(\u03c4) = C 2 e \u2212\u03c4 T1 (S10)\nwhere we assumed C1,2 1. In this case, T1 can be estimated via an exponential fit to the normalised data N \u2032(\u03c4) provided the relative spin contrast C is independent of \u03c4 . The latter condition may be expected to hold even in the presence of charge relaxation.\nOutside these two scenarios, it is generally not possible to estimate T1 without knowledge of the functional forms of IB(\u03c4), IS(\u03c4) and C1,2(\u03c4). In our experiments, the measured PL contains a non-negligible background contribution (non V\u2212B spin related), as evidenced by the PL spectrum Fig. S1 where the non-irradiated powder emits a significant amount of PL overlapping with the V\u2212B emission. We also observed that this background PL tends to increase following a dark time which is seen as a common-mode increase in the raw traces S,R(\u03c4) [Fig. S3(a)]. Furthermore, adding GdCl3 whether dry or in solution adds a small but non-negligible background contribution. Therefore, the second normalisation method N \u2032(\u03c4) cannot be used here. Instead, we used the first method N (\u03c4) as it only assumes that the absolute V\u2212B spin contribution to the total PL, precisely the product ISC, is constant independent of \u03c4 .\nThe normalised data is relatively well fit with a mono-exponential function [Fig. S3(b)], here giving T1 = 18\u00b5s. A stretched exponential fit exp[\u2212(\u03c4/T1)n], often used in NV T1 sensing experiments [9, 15], returns a similar T1 value but does not seem to fit the data better (not shown). We thus choose to fit all data with a mono-exponential as to reduce the number of fitting parameters. We note that a small deviation from the exponential behaviour is sometimes observed at small \u03c4 values, as can be seen in the example Fig. S3(b). This deviation may be due to a decrease in the sample temperature as \u03c4 is increased (see Sec. V) or to residual relaxation effects that extend beyond the \u03c4 = 0\u22122\u00b5s window. The variability of this deviation across different experiments adds an uncertainty to the measured T1 values, which we estimate (e.g. by changing the spacing between \u03c4 points in the T1 curve or restricting the fit to larger \u03c4 values) to be about \u00b110%.\nC. Effect of finite spin initialisation fidelity\nIn this section, we develop a simple model to quantify the effect of finite spin initialisation (due to a finite laser pulse duration) on the estimated T1 time. Indeed, in general insufficient repumping from the laser during a T1 measurement leads to an apparent decay time Td that is shorter than the true spin decay time T1.\nWe consider a two-level model corresponding to |0\u3009 and the doublet |\u00b11\u3009 treated as a single level. When the laser is off, these two levels are coupled by the transition rate k01 which mediates spontaneous spin relaxation and defines T1 as discussed in Sec. IV A, where here the relation between the two is 1/T1 = 2k01. Turning the laser on adds a pumping rate kp which drives the |\u00b11\u3009 \u2192 |0\u3009 transition [Fig. S4(a)]. This pumping rate scales with the laser intensity used. We apply this model to calculate the population dynamics during our measurement sequence, which alternates a free decay part (kp = 0, duration \u03c4) and a pumping part (kp 6= 0, duration tp) where tp is the laser pulse duration [Fig. S4(b)]. Note, while the model omits the overall photodynamics of the defect (e.g., the intersystem crossing) as well as possible charge dynamics effects, we expect it to provide a useful guide to choose an appropriate pulse duration tp allowing a faithful estimation of T1.\nWe first treat the two stages of the sequence [A and B, see Fig. S4(b)] separately, defining rate matrices \u03a6A and \u03a6B and solving the corresponding linear matrix rate equations to determine the time-dependent functions for the populations \u03c10(t) and \u03c1\u00b11(t):\n\u03a6A = [ \u2212k01 k01 k01 \u2212k01 ] =\u21d2 { \u03c10,A(t) = C0 + C1e \u22122k01t\n\u03c1\u00b11,A(t) = C0 \u2212 C1e\u22122k01t\n\u03a6B = [ \u2212k01 k01 + kp k01 \u2212(k01 + kp) ] =\u21d2 { \u03c10,B(t) = C2 k01+kp k01 \u2212 C3e\u2212(2k01+kp)t\n\u03c1\u00b11,B(t) = C2 + C3e \u2212(2k01+kp)t\n(S11)\nTo solve for the coefficients Cn, we first use the fact that the system is closed, such that \u03c10,A(t) + \u03c1\u00b11,A(t) = \u03c10,B(t) + \u03c1\u00b11,B(t) = 1. Second, since the sequence is repeated N \u223c 1000 times, we can apply periodic boundary conditions \u03c10,A(0) = \u03c10,B(\u03c4 + tp), combined with the trivial condition \u03c10,A(\u03c4) = \u03c10,B(\u03c4) [see Fig. S4(b)].\nWe obtain:\n6 FIG. S4. (a) Simple two-level model used to describe the effect of finite spin initialisation. The two levels are coupled by the two-way transition rate k01 defining the spontaneous spin relaxation rate and thus T1. When the laser is on there is an additional pumping rate kp which drives the transition |\u00b11\u3009 \u2192 |0\u3009. (b) Schematic representation of the timing for the laser pulses and the effect on the population of the |0\u3009 state \u03c10(t). The regions labelled A and B are the areas where we solve the dynamical rate equations by employing the indicated periodic boundary conditions.

(d) Plot of the decay time Td versus tp (bottom axis) and calculated initialisation fidelity (top axis) with Td being extracted from the curves in (c) by fitting with a mono-exponential. The solid line indicates the nominal T1 value input into the model (T1 = 18\u00b5s) while the dotted line is a separate exponential fit which acts as a guide to the eye which shows how Td converges on T1 as tp is increased. Values for tp used in experiments were all within the shaded area.\n[ \u03c10,A(t) ] sig. = 1\n2 + kp 2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp \u2212 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1\n) e\u22122k01t (S12)\n[ \u03c1\u00b11,A(t) ] sig. = 1 2 \u2212 kp\n2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp \u2212 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1\n) e\u22122k01t (S13)\n[ \u03c10,B(t) ] sig.\n= k01 + kp 2k01 + kp \u2212 kp 2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)\u03c4 ( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1 ))e\u2212(2k01+kp)t (S14) [ \u03c1\u00b11,B(t) ] sig. = k01\n2k01 + kp + kp 2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)\u03c4 ( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 \u2212 1 ))e\u2212(2k01+kp)t (S15) Note these equations are representative of the \u2018signal\u2019 collection where no MW pulse is applied. Similarly, to obtain equations for the \u2018reference\u2019 measurement, the MW pulse is assumed to perfectly swap the populations of the |0\u3009 and |\u00b11\u3009 states. For simplicity it is assumed this process is instantaneous and occurs at t = \u03c4 . Re-solving for the coefficients with the now new condition \u03c10,B(\u03c4) = \u03c1\u00b11,A(\u03c4), new rate equations which describe the reference measurement are obtained, giving:\n[ \u03c10,B(t) ] ref.\n= k01 + kp 2k01 + kp \u2212 kp 2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u22122k01\u03c4 + 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)\u03c4 ( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 + 1 ))e\u2212(2k01+kp)t (S16) [ \u03c1\u00b11,B(t) ] ref. = k01\n2k01 + kp + kp 2(2k01 + kp)\n( e\u22122k01\u03c4 + 1\ne\u2212(2k01+kp)\u03c4 ( e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp\u22122k01\u03c4 + 1\n))e\u2212(2k01+kp)t (S17)\n7 Now, we express the PL traces S(\u03c4) and R(\u03c4) in accordance with Eq. S4, but here integrating the populations over the laser pulse duration:\nS(\u03c4) = IB + 1\ntp \u222b tp 0 dt ( A0 [ \u03c10,B(t) ] sig. +A1 [ \u03c1\u00b11,B(t) ] sig. ) (S18)\nR(\u03c4) = IB + 1\ntp \u222b tp 0 dt ( A0 [ \u03c10,B(t) ] ref. +A1 [ \u03c1\u00b11,B(t) ] ref. ) (S19)\nFinally, we can express the normalised PL as defined by Eq. S9, i.e. the PL difference N = S \u2212R. This gives:\nN (\u03c4) = kp(A0 \u2212A1) tp(2k01 + kp)2\n( 1\u2212 e\u2212(2k01+kp)tp )2 1\u2212 e\u22122(2k01+kp)tp\u22124k01\u03c4 e\u22122k01\u03c4 (S20)\nTo numerically test the influence of the laser pulse duration tp, in Fig. S4(c) we plot N (\u03c4) curves with different values of tp. The parameters were chosen as T1 = 1/2k01 = 18\u00b5s and kp = 5.1 MHz, the latter corresponding to a typical experimental value, as we will see below. By fitting the curves in Fig. S4(c) with an exponential decay exp(\u2212\u03c4/Td), we can extract the apparent characteristic decay time Td, which is plotted against tp in Fig. S4(d). As tp is increased the value for Td increases until it reaches a maximal asymptote equal to the true T1. Thus, the measured Td will always be less than T1 unless kptp is sufficiently large. However, for tp \u2265 0.5\u00b5s as used experimentally, the relative error \u03b5 = T1\u2212TdT1 is negligible, \u03b5 \u2264 0.01%.\nTo estimate the experimental pumping rate kp at a given laser intensity, we use the fact that the maximum PL difference Nmax = N (\u03c4 = 0) scales with tp as\nNmax = A0 \u2212A1 kptp 1\u2212 e\u2212kptp 1 + e\u2212kptp , (S21)\nwhere to obtain a workable expression, we assume that kp k01 which amounts to neglecting spin relaxation during laser pumping, which is a valid assumption as will be justified below. Thus, by measuring Nmax as a function of tp and fitting Eq. S21 to the data, we can estimate kp for our experimental conditions. An example measurement of Nmax vs tp taken in the conditions of main text Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. S5. Here Nmax was taken as the PL difference at \u03c4 = 2\u00b5s rather than at \u03c4 = 0 to ensure full relaxation to the electronic ground state, but numerically calculating N (\u03c4 = 2\u00b5s) shows the correction is negligible. Fitting Eq. S21 to the data in Fig. S5 gives kp = 5.1\u00b1 0.5 MHz, which satisfies kp k01 validating the above assumption. This is the value of kp that was used in the prediction Fig. S4(d).\nWe can also define an initialisation fidelity\nF := 2\u03c10,B(t = tp)\u2212 1 (S22) = 1\u2212 e\u2212kptp (S23)\nwhere \u03c10,B(t = tp) is the population at the end of the laser pulse when starting from an unpolarised state, i.e. \u03c10(t = 0) = 1/2. With kp = 5.1 MHz as determined before, we obtain F = 0.93 for tp = 0.5\u00b5s, for instance. This\nFIG. S5. Experimental data of the spin contrast measured at different laser pulse durations. The data is fit with Eq. S21 in order to extract a value for the pumping rate kp.\n8 initialisation fidelity directly dictates the relative error \u03b5 made in the estimation of T1. In all the T1 measurements presented in the paper, we used a fidelity of F > 0.9, ensuring that the associated error was \u03b5 < 0.01%, well below the statistical noise (i.e. the uncertainty from the fit).\nV. T1 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE\nAs a part of our initial investigation regarding T1 measurements in our nanopowder samples, we also measured the T1 dependence on temperature. Measurements were performed using a custom-built wide-field fluorescence microscope which is constructed around a closed-cycle cryostat (Attocube attoDRY1000), described in detail in Ref. [52]. The base temperature of the cryostat is about 5 K, and the sample temperature can be increased to up to room temperature using a heater.\nThe measurement conditions were similar to the room-temperature measurements as described in Sec. I and III except for the laser power, 50 mW here, resulting in a smaller laser intensity. The powder was dropcast on to a PCB with a MW waveguide in similar fashion to our other samples before being loaded into the cryostat for measurement.\nThe results of T1 versus temperature are shown in Fig. S6 over the range T = 70\u2212 325 K. In these measurements, T1 was found to increase from T1 = 15 \u00b1 3\u00b5s at room temperature to T1 = 160 \u00b1 30\u00b5s at T = 70 K. We did not measure below 70 K because the required acquisition time became impractically long as T1 got longer. This temperature dependence indicate that T1 is governed by a thermally activated process, but further work will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism. For comparison, in Fig. S6 we also plotted the data from Ref. [43] which was obtained with a neutron-irradiated bulk hBN crystal. At low temperatures, the T1 times we measure in our powders are in general shorter and do not exhibit as strong of an overall dependence on temperature below 250 K. However, at room temperature the T1 of our powders is similar to the T1 \u2248 18\u00b5s value reported in Ref. [43], and can even exceed this value as was the case for powder 1 as reported in the main text.\nWe also note that the temperature dependence implies that any heating effect during the measurements (caused by laser or MW absorption by the sample) may affect the measured T1 value. For instance, T1 will be about 20% shorter if the temperature is raised from 300 K to 320 K, according to Fig. S6. Using pulsed-ODMR spectroscopy and monitoring the shift of the spin resonance frequency \u03c90, it is possible to estimate the temperature experienced by the V\u2212B defects [30, 32]. In Fig. 4(a) of the main text, the temperature increase was estimated to be \u2248 70 K. However, in conditions similar to those of our T1 measurements, in particular with a minimum delay of \u03c4 \u2265 2\u00b5s between the laser pulse and the MW probe pulse, we find the heating to be generally less than \u2248 20 K above room temperature\nFIG. S6. Temperature dependence of T1 of powder 2 (green squares) in comparison with the data from Ref. [43] obtained with a neutron-irradiated bulk hBN crystal (orange diamonds). Solid lines are a power law fit, with the shading indicating one standard error.\n9 at \u03c4 = 2\u00b5s, with further cooling at longer \u03c4 . Therefore, T1 is expected to be shortened by 20% at most as a result of heating, compared to the room-temperature value. This effect is one of the major sources of uncertainty in our experiments, and may explain the variability sometimes observed between T1 measurements, since the local sample temperature will be sensitive to the specific experimental conditions.\nVI. DETERMINING THE EXPECTED T1 QUENCHING\nHere we model the expected contribution to the total relaxation rate from the external paramagnetic ions. As stated in the main text, the total relaxation rate (\u03931) is the sum of both the intrinsic (\u0393 int 1 ) and external magnetic noise (\u0393ext1 ) contributions. The latter is caused by randomly fluctuating magnetic fields and is thus described by [9, 10]\n\u0393ext1 = 3\u03b3 2 eB 2 \u22a5 \u03c4c 1 + \u03c920\u03c4 2 c\n(S24)\nwhere \u03b3e is the electron gyromagnetic ratio, B 2 \u22a5 is the variance in the fluctuating transverse dipolar magnetic field which constitutes the noise source, \u03c4c is its correlation time, and \u03c90 is the resonant frequency of the V \u2212 B triplet ground state. We can use this equation to model the expected quenching effect by first finding an expression for B2\u22a5. The dipolar field radiated by a spin Sn at a point in space rn is\nBn = \u00b50\u03b3e~ 4\u03c0r3n\n[ Sn \u2212 3(Sn \u00b7 un)un ] , (S25)\nwhere un = rn/rn. For a fluctuating (paramagnetic) spin, we assume all projections of the spin are equally probable and so take the trace over a purely mixed state described by the density matrix \u03c1 = 12S+112S+1,\nB2\u22a5,n = \u3008B2x,n\u3009+ \u3008B2y,n\u3009 = Tr[\u03c1(B2x,n +B2y,n)] = ( \u00b50\u03b3e~\n4\u03c0\n)2 CS\n2 + sin2 \u03b8n r6n\n(S26)\nwhere CS = Tr[\u03c1S 2 i,n] = 1 2S+1 \u2211S m=\u2212Sm 2 = S(S+1)3 with i = x, y, z, and \u03b8n is the angle between the z-axis (V \u2212 B quantisation axis) and rn. For a slab of hBN with thickness 2d and containing V \u2212 B at a depth d [Fig. S7], assuming a\nFIG. S7. Schematic representation of the geometry for which the variance B2\u22a5 of the transverse magnetic field experienced at the V\u2212B from a bath of external paramagnetic spins (Gd\n3+) is derived. The V\u2212B is assumed to exist at the centre of a hBN nanoflake with thickness 2d, which is much smaller than the lateral dimensions (i.e. an infinite slab of hBN with finite thickness). We define the principle axis of the V\u2212B to be along the z-axis and also describe the locations of the Gd\n3+ spins relative to the centre of the defect. The problem is assumed to be symmetric about the defect in the x and y directions.\n10\ndensity of external spins \u03c1ext occupying all space external to the slab of hBN, we can obtain the total transverse field by summing over all external paramagnetic ions,\nB2\u22a5 = \u2211 n B2\u22a5,n = ( \u00b50\u03b3e~ 4\u03c0 )2 \u03c1extCS \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03c6 \u222b \u03c0 2 0 d\u03b8 sin \u03b8 \u222b \u221e d cos \u03b8 dr 2 + sin2 \u03b8 r4 (S27)\n=\n( \u00b50\u03b3e~\n4\u03c0\n)2 \u03c0\u03c1extCS\n3d3 . (S28)\nIn our initial quenching experiment, we assume the solution of GdCl3 percolates through the hBN powder film and surrounds individual flakes of hBN before evaporation which leaves behind crystalline GdCl3. The crystal has a density of 4520 kg m\u22123 and molar mass 0.236 kg mol\u22121 giving a Gd3+ density of \u03c1ext = 1.03 \u00d7 1028 m\u22123 with each Gd3+ contributing S = 72 . In the optimal case where there is maximal coupling between the noise source and the V \u2212 B defect then \u03c4c = 1 \u03c90\nwith \u03c90 \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3.45 GHz. For a flake of thickness 2d = 10 nm, and given there is an effectively infinite volume of Gd3+ ions on both sides of the flake (thus we double the magnetic noise) we calculate \u0393ext1 = 27 kHz which approximately matches our experimentally measured value of 30 kHz. We note for this calculation we have chosen an idealised value for the correlation time \u03c4c of the noise source; however, we have compensated by using a conservative value for the thickness of the hBN flake which is over one standard deviation larger than what the AFM data in Sec. II indicates. If instead we assume the mean thickness of 2d = 6 nm, we can relax the optimised choice on \u03c4c and reduce or increase its value by a factor of \u2248 10 to obtain the same \u0393ext1 , i.e. \u03c4c \u2248 10\u03c90 or \u03c4c \u2248 1 10\u03c90 . Furthermore this model assumes a single V\u2212B defect located at the middle of a flake which is the worst case scenario in terms of sensitivity. The electron irradiation process should populate a hBN flake with multiple defects distributed throughout and thus would allow us to further relax the conditions on \u03c4c."
