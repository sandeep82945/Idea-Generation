    "abstractText": "We demonstrate the generation, 40 km fiber transmission, and homodyne detection 8 of single-mode squeezed states of light at 1550 nm using real-time phase control of a locally 9 generated local oscillator, often called a \u201dreal local oscillator\u201d or \u201dlocal local oscillator\u201d. The 10 system was able to stably measure up to around 3.7 dB of noise suppression with a phase noise 11 uncertainty of around 2.5\u25e6, using only standard telecom-compatible components and a field12 programmable gate array (FPGA). The compactness, low degree of complexity and efficacy of 13 the implemented scheme makes it a relevant candidate for long distance quantum communication 14 in future photonic quantum networks. 15",

The10 system was able to stably measure up to around 3.7 dB of noise suppression with a phase noise11 uncertainty of around 2.5\u25e6, using only standard telecom-compatible components and a field-12 programmable gate array (FPGA). The compactness, low degree of complexity and efficacy of13 the implemented scheme makes it a relevant candidate for long distance quantum communication14 in future photonic quantum networks.15\n1. Introduction16\nSqueezed states of light have by now been generated for more than three decades [1] and have17 become a ubiquitous resource in optical quantum information science. Unlike coherent states18 of light, squeezed light has the outstanding property of exhibiting lower noise uncertainty than19 the fundamental shot noise in some of its quadratures \u2013 known as squeezing \u2013 while conjugated20 quadratures exhibit uncertainties above the shot noise limit \u2013 known as anti-squeezing [2,3]. This21 fundamental quantum property of squeezed states has been the engine of numerous quantum22 sensing experiments, such as the quantum-enhanced measurements of gravitational waves [4]23 and vibrational modes of molecules [5, 6], and recent quantum computing models including24 Gaussian boson sampling [7, 8] and measurement-based quantum computing [9\u201311]. Further-25 more, the use of squeezed states (compared to coherent states) improves the performance of26 continuous variable quantum key distribution systems by increasing the tolerance to optical loss,27 excess noise and imperfect error correction [12\u201314], effectively allowing longer transmission28 distances or improved security.29 The most common technique employed to measure squeezed states of light is homodyne de-30 tection, which implements the ideal measurement of one quadrature of the electromagnetic field31 by using a strong reference beam, called the local oscillator, in conjunction with a (balanced)32 detection system [2, 15]. Because of its versatility, simplicity and high efficiency, it is a widely33 employed measurement technique in quantum information protocols including the recent demon-34 strations of Heisenberg limited quantum sensing [16], measurement-induced quantum comput-35 ing gates [11], long-distance quantum key distribution [17] and high-speed quantum random36 number generation [18].37 In most quantum optical proof-of-concept experiments, the homodyne detection process is38 carried out with a local oscillator that originates from the same laser as the one that produces39 the signal, e.g. the squeezed state. The advantage in doing so is that the local oscillator is nat-40 urally frequency-synchronized with the signal, and the remaining slow phase fluctuations can41 be easily stabilized using simple control systems. However, in real-life applications on quan-42 tum communication, distributed quantum sensing and networked quantum computing where the43 information-carrying optical signal, e.g. the squeezed state, needs to be transmitted through op-44 tical fibers to remote locations, a centrally distributed local oscillator is problematic for several45 reasons. Firstly, the optical power of the local oscillator decreases exponentially with propa-46\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA c\npt d\nM an\nsc rip\nt\ngation distance, and therefore, to provide sufficient optical power at the various nodes in the47 network for enabling low-noise homodyne detection, a significant amount of power must be dis-48 tributed through the fiber network. In addition to this direct power wastage, the massive power49 distribution might also lead to deteriorating non-linear optical effects (such as Brillouin scatte-50 ring) and to distortion of the quantum state of the signal [19, 20]. Secondly, transmitting the51 local oscillator along with the signal is also fundamentally problematic for continuous-variable52 quantum key distribution (CVQKD), as there are several eavesdropping strategies that explic-53 itly make use of the transmitted local oscillator to corrupt the coherent detection at the trusted54 receiver, therefore breaching the security of the QKD protocol [21\u201324].55 Hence, it is preferable to generate the local oscillator locally at the receiving nodes. Obviously,56 real-time control of the phase difference between the signal and the local oscillator becomes57 more challenging as the two laser sources are in general not frequency-locked; partly for this58 reason, many current proof-of-concept CVQKD systems, while using an real local oscillator,59 use heterodyne reception and do not stabilize the phase in real-time, but rather rely on phase60 estimation and compensation in post-processing, possibly invoking elaborate phase estimation61 techniques [25]. Moreover, due to the complications associated with an real local oscillator, all62 previous experiments on quantum communication with squeezed light have employed a local63 oscillator derived from the same laser as they used for squeezed light generation.64 In this article, we report on the generation, transmission and homodyne detection of single-65 mode squeezed states of light at the wavelength of 1550 nm using an real local oscillator with66 real-time phase control. By exploiting a real-time feedback system, we controlled the frequency67 and phase of an locally-generated local oscillator to such an extent that it enabled homodyne68 detection with a phase uncertainty of 2.51\u25e6 of a squeezed state that had propagated up to 40 km69 in a telecom fiber. Our demonstration constitutes a critical milestone in the construction of a70 quantum information network based on continuous variable quantum systems.71\n2. Methods72\nBalanced homodyne detection works by interfering the mode to be detected, here named the sig-73 nal, with a much more intense optical mode, known as the local oscillator (LO), on a balanced74 beam splitter. The outputs of the beam splitter are simultaneously detected with two photodi-75 odes, and the resulting photocurrents are electronically subtracted to produce a signal which is76 proportional to a specific quadrature of the signal. The quadrature being measured is governed77 by the phase difference of the signal and the local oscillator, so in order to enable a long-term78 measurement of a specific quadrature \u2013 as required for most applications \u2013 the phase relation be-79 tween the two input modes must be kept constant. This is often realized with an active feedback80 control system. A conceptual schematic of homodyne detection is shown in figure 1.81\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\nep te\nd M\nus cr\npt\nFor the detection of squeezed light, it is common to use the same laser for delivering power to82 the local oscillator and for generating the squeezed state which means that the central frequency83 component of the squeezed light is naturally synchronized with the local oscillator frequency.84 Such frequency synchronization is indeed required as the detection of squeezed light corresponds85 to the precise detection of adjacent, quantum correlated, frequency side bands located symmet-86 rically around the reference frequency. This in-built frequency synchronization also means that87 small frequency drifts of the laser play no role in the performance of the measurement.88\nTo achieve homodyne detection of squeezed light at a fixed phase angle with an indepen-89 dent local oscillator where frequency synchronization is not inherent, synchronization must be90 established in real time to counteract the relative frequency drifts. This must be done with a91 precision that allows for the simultaneous detection of symmetrically correlated sidebands such92 that the squeezing is revealed. Towards this end, we employ a pilot tone technique as illustrated93 in Fig. 2a: A pilot tone is a coherent excitation which is extracted from the central laser (which94 is used for squeezed light generation) and frequency shifted with respect to the squeezed light95 carrier by \u03a9\ud835\udc5d = 2\ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d . The pilot tone is combined with the squeezed light mode, residing as96 a single frequency sideband, thereby providing a frequency and phase reference for the local97 oscillator upon reception at the homodyne detection station. We note that pilot tones are an98 essential part of the coherent control scheme commonly used to actively control squeezed light99 sources [4, 26, 27] and, thus, they are readily available in many squeezed light experiments. At100 the receiver station, the frequency offset and phase difference relative to the real local oscillator101 are measured through interference at a beam splitter as shown in the figure, and the resulting sig-102 nals are subsequently used to control the frequency and phase of the real local oscillator mode103 to compensate for any phase and frequency drifts. The feedback signal is divided into a slow104 port for frequency control of the LO laser and a fast port for phase control via an electro-optics105 modulator.106 The output signal of a balanced homodyne receiver measuring the pilot tone with an indepen-107 dent laser as LO is proportional to108 \u221a\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc42 cos ( (\u03a9\ud835\udc5d + \u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc61))\ud835\udc61 + \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udf19set ) , (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc42 are the optical powers of the pilot and local oscillator at the input to the109\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt ed\nM an\nus\nhomodyne detector, \u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc61) is the time dependent angular frequency offset of the two lasers, and110 \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc61) is the time dependent phase difference between LO and pilot (modulo their frequency111 offset). The goal of our active feedback scheme is to achieve \u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc61) = \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc61) = 0 and to thereby112 perform homodyne detection at the phase angle \ud835\udf19set.113\nThe laser we employed as LO laser in the experiment was an NKT Photonics E15 which allows for frequency tuning via a piezo-electric transducer (PZT). We complemented this slow frequency actuator with a fast electro-optical phase modulator (EOM), cf. Fig. 2a. The feedback loop, consisting of phase detection and control, was implemented in a field-programmable-gate array (FPGA) as shown in Fig. 2b. To limit the required sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) connected to the FPGA we first electrically down-mixed the output of the homodyne detector, see Eq. 1, with two orthogonal sinusoidal signals with amplitude \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f , frequency \u03a9\ud835\udc5d and phase \ud835\udf19set. After down-mixing we low-pass filtered the signal with 5 MHz cutoff fre-\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\ne te\nd M\nquency. The electrical sinusoidal signals have to be synchronized with the generation of the pilot tone at the squeezed light source which can either be achieved by transmitting a clock signal using a wavelength multiplexed channel or a dedicated servicing fiber, which is a standard technique in quantum communication, or potentially by more sophisticated digital-signal-processing [28]. After down-mixing and low-pass filtering, the two signals are given by\n\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61) \u221d \u221a \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f cos (\u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc61 + \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc61)) , (2)\n\ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc61) \u221d \u221a \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f sin (\u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc61 + \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc61)) . (3)\nThese were sampled by two ADCs with sampling period \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 , resulting in a discretization of time114 as \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 with sample index \ud835\udc5b.115 In the FPGA, we established two signal paths corresponding to the two actuators: A fast path116 using the EOM as actuator, and a slow path actuating with the PZT. For the PZT actuation path117 we estimated the instantaneous phase error by calculating the arctan between \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61) using118 a coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm [29] which yields119\n\u03a6\ud835\udc52 (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60) \u2243 \u0394\u03a9(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60 + \u0394\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60) (mod [\u2212\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b]) . (4)\nIf the phase error exceeds [\u2212\ud835\udf0b, \ud835\udf0b], \u03a6\ud835\udc52 undergoes an abrupt transition, often called phase wrap.120 This can be avoided by accumulating phase increments between consecutive samples, namely121 \u03a6\ud835\udc52 (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60) \u2212 \u03a6\ud835\udc52 ((\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1)\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60) and detecting a phase wrap event by comparing the last two bits of122 the binary representation of the current phase increment, and compensating for it by adding or123 subtracting 2\ud835\udf0b [30]. Phase unwrapping allows to detect a wider range of phase fluctuations, at124 the cost of decreased signal resolution due to a fixed number of bits used in the implementation.125 To generate the actuator signal for the PZT, the output of the phase unwrapping algorithm126 was injected into a proportional-integral (PI) controller whose output was added to the output127 of another PI controller taking directly \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61) as error signal. The latter allowed to control the128 medium frequency range which was not possible with the instantaneous phase error signal due129 to latency.130 The fast path used \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61) as error signal. This was low-pass filtered at 39 kHz, since at higher131 frequencies the measured phase fluctuations hit the noise floor of the detection system. After132 PI control, the signal was converted to the electrical domain and low-pass filtered at 5 MHz to133 eliminate high frequency electronic noise.134 The lock was acquired by first tuning the frequency of the LO laser into the capture range135 of our controller via the laser\u2019s temperature. The capture range was determined by the 5 MHz136 lowpass filter before analog-to-digital conversion. The lock was then engaged by first disabling137 the fast path as well as the medium frequency part of the slow path which allowed us to achieve a138 frequency lock first. Afterwards the two additional paths were enabled to lock the phase without139 cycle slips. We note that the homodyne angle can be adjusted by changing the phase \ud835\udf19set of the140 electrical LO used for downmixing the homodyne detector output.141 The described phase locking scheme was experimentally tested with the experimental setup142 in Fig. 3 showing a schematic for squeezing generation, fiber transmission and detection.143 The laser that generates the squeezed and the pilot modes is an NKT Koheras ADJUSTIK144 E15, at 1550.12 nm wavelength. Squeezed vacuum at 1550 nm was generated through para-145 metric downconversion using a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal146 placed inside an optical cavity resonant for the squeezed field and the pump field at 775 nm. The147 pump was generated by a commercial second harmonic generation module (NTT Electronics148 WH-0775-000-F-8-C), consisting in a lithium niobate (LN) crystal with waveguide. While the149 pump field was used to lock the squeezed light source\u2019s cavity on resonance, we used the coher-150 ent control scheme for the phase. An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) frequency-shifted a small151 fraction of the fundamental laser beam at 1550 nm by \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d = 40 MHz which was then injected152\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\np d\nM an\nus cr\nip t\ninto the cavity and its phase was locked with respect to the pump field. This constituted the pilot153 signal used at the detection stage. It had a power of about 5 \ud835\udf07W leaving the cavity and it coprop-154 agated with the squeezed light. More details about the squeezed light source can be found in155 Ref. [27]. In principle, lower pilot frequencies can be chosen, with the caution that antisqueez-156 ing noise has higher impact at lower frequencies, thereby resulting in lower signal-to-noise ratio157 for phase locks involving the pilot tone. In Ref. [27], \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d = 40 MHz was set to lie mostly out-158 side the squeezer spectral response and allow for a clean spectral measurement of the squeezed159 light quadratures. Reflected off a dichroic beam splitter (DBS), the squeezed and pilot modes160 were coupled from free space into a standard single-mode optical fiber (SMF-28) and propagated161 towards the free space receiver station, where homodyne detection of the squeezed mode took162 place using a separate laser source at 1550.12 nm wavelength (NKT Koheras MIKRO E15) as163 local oscillator. To match the polarization of the squeezed light after transmission through the164 fiber to the local oscillator we used a quarter waveplate and a half waveplate.165\n3. Results166\nAll our measurements compare the performance of the real LO with a regular LO drawn from167 the squeezed light\u2019s laser source and transmitted through a separate short optical fiber - 2 m168 length. Using the same length of regular LO fiber as for the signal channel would have been169 more realistic, but we chose a short fiber to benchmark the real LO against the best possible170 regular LO scenario.171 The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4. First, we transmitted the squeezed light through a172 10 m fiber and compared the performance of the phase locked loop to a measurement for which173 we used a regular LO transmitted along with the squeezed light, through a separate short optical174 fiber. This is shown in Fig. 4a where we plot the variance of the squeezed (\ud835\udc49\u2212) and anti-squeezed175 (\ud835\udc49+) quadratures for varying pump power of the squeezed light source.

The difference can be explained by phase186 noise which we determined by the fit to be 56 mrad for the real LO and 29 mrad for the regular187 one. The total efficiency of the setup was 68 % which limited the measured squeezing to about188 3.7 dB.189 We then added a 1, 5, 10 and 40 km fiber between the squeezed light source and the receiver190 and measured squeezing with both the real LO from the receiver laser and the regular LO from191 the transmitter laser. The power of the pump field of the squeezed light source was 2.6 mW.192 The results can be seen in Fig. 4b. We note that for fair comparison we did not transmit the193 regular LO from the transmitter laser through the same fiber but instead used another fiber of194 constant length. This however let to the accumulation of phase drifts caused by the long fibers195 the squeezed light travelled through. While the coherence length of the lasers by far exceeds196 40 km, the phase fluctuations in the fiber made it necessary to use a fast EOM for phase locking.197\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\npt\nM\nan\nus\ncr ip\nt\nFrom the fit of the theoretical model, shown in the figure, we obtained an effective value for the198 fiber attenuation of 0.25 dB/km which is slightly higher than the manufacturer\u2019s specification of199 0.18 dB/km. The reason is partly due to changing coupling losses when attaching the different200 fibers.201 The residual phase noise standard deviations at the given distances are shown in Fig. 4c.202 Clearly, the phase noise increases with transmission distance which can be explained by two203 effects: Firstly, the signal-to-noise ratio of the pilot beam drops with transmission distance,204 thereby reducing the quality of the error signals at the input of the PI-controllers. Secondly, the205 phase fluctuations become stronger while the light travels through the fiber. Since the loop gain206 stays constant, the deviations from the lock point increase. Notably the phase noise at 40 km is207 higher for the regular LO than for the real LO.208 This effect can also be seen in Fig. 4d where we investigated the squeezed light transmitted209 through 40 km of fiber in more detail. Here we varied again the pump power of the squeezed210 light source and measured the noise variances of the squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures211 using both LOs. The overall optical transmission was determined from the fit of the theoretical212 model of Eq. 5 to 13% for the real LO and 11 % for the regular one. The deviation may come213 from a change of fiber in-coupling or polarization drifts. For the phase noise standard deviation214 we obtained 147 mrad and 115 mrad for the real and regular LO, respectively. At 40 km distance215 the phase drifts seem to be better compensated by the phase lock of the real LO than the regular216 one.217 At a distance of 5 km we investigated the quadrature noise spectrum and phase noise in more218 detail. Figure 5a shows the quadrature noise power spectrum of the squeezed light in the range219 0 to 20 MHz measured with the real local oscillator. The noise power has been normalized to220 the noise power of the vacuum state. The pump power was 2.6 mW. The fit of the theoretical221 model from Eq. 5 reveals an optical transmission of 50.0 %, corresponding to about 1.3 dB fiber222 attenuation, and a phase noise standard deviation of 65 mrad. The inset shows histograms of223 the noise for the squeezed state in the 0 to 20 MHz frequency range in the squeezed and anti-224 squeezed quadrature and the vacuum state as comparison.225 By acquiring the 40 MHz pilot signal with a data acquisition system digitizing the coherent re-226 ceiver output we extracted the residual phase noise power spectral density. The phase estimation227 procedure, which is explained in detail in the supplementary material, has been performed for228 the regular and the phase-locked real local oscillator. Figure 5b shows the phase noise spectrum229 for the squeezed quadrature while Fig. 5c shows it for the antisqueezed quadrature and the cor-230 responding phase histograms are shown in Fig. 5d and e, respectively. When phase locked, the231 signal-to-noise ratio of the pilot is different in the two cases due to the antisqueezing which low-232 ers it by around 5 dB, however, the performance of the phase lock seems to be similar.Although233 not directly visible in the figure, between the cases of squeezed quadrature and antisqueezed234 quadrature measurement, the noise floor at the pilot frequency (40 MHz) differs by 5 dB, i.e.,235 approximately -2 dB in the squeezed case and +3 dB in the antisqueezed case. Thus, since the236 pilot mode is noisier when measuring antisqueezing, the signal-to-noise ratio for the control sys-237 tem is lower in this condition, provided the pilot mode has the same optical power all the time.238 Even so, the performance of the phase lock seems to be similar for squeezed and antisqueezed239 quadrature measurements. At low frequencies the phase noise of the real LO is slightly larger240 than the phase noise of the regular LO. The phase histograms are taken over the entire frequency241 range. Here the peak around 80 kHz in the spectra for the regular LO seems to compensate the242 better phase noise behaviour at low frequencies.243\n4. Discussion244\nThe developed system allowed homodyne detection of up to 3.7 dB squeezed states of light over245 optical fiber spools of up to 40 km length. The control system exhibited a minimum phase noise246\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nA cc\np ed\nM nu\nsc rip\nt\n(a)\n(b)\nreal LO\n(c)\nreal LO\n(d)\nreal LO\n(e)\nreal LO\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\nte\nd\nM an\nus cr\nip t\nstandard deviation of (43.78\u00b1 0.07) mrad, corresponding to (2.508\u00b1 0.004)\u25e6, under phase con-247 trol. In particular, it enables the measurement of squeezed states and other quantum states of248 light spatially separated from the source without the distribution of high-power local oscillators249 through the fiber network (thereby avoiding detrimental effects such as non-linear Brillouin scat-250 tering in optical fibers [20]). The maximum measured amount of squeezing was not primarily251 limited by phase noise, but rather by the optical transmission efficiency of the squeezed mode252 through the experimental setup, which can be improved by accurate single-mode fiber coupling253 and by optimizing the detection efficiency in future implementations. The phase noise perfor-254 mance of the phase control system could be improved by reducing the electronic amplification255 noise at the output of the homodyne detector and at the input of the control actuators, and by256 performing the downmixing and low-pass filtering that yield the signals \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61) and \ud835\udc5e(\ud835\udc61) inside the257 FPGA rather than at its input, thereby avoiding the use of potentially noisy analog mixers and258 low-pass filters. Furthermore, the three employed PI control systems should be carefully de-259 signed, to ensure that phase noise is effectively compensated for over its full Fourier spectrum260 support, and to avoid detrimental interference between the different control systems in action.261\n5. Conclusions262\nThis work has demonstrated the possibility of transmission and homodyne detection of general-263 ized quadratures of squeezed states of light at 1550 nm wavelength over at least 40 km single-264 mode optical fiber (compatible with large metropolitan networks), using a phase-locked real265 local oscillator. Our system makes use of standard telecom components, such as piezoelectric266 fiber stretchers and electro-optic modulators, and widely used general-purpose digital signal267 processing devices, such as FPGAs. It is a general homodyne detection technique that allows268 for the characterization of arbitrary states over long distances in a network, as needed for a269 variety of quantum information tasks. For quantum key distribution, using a true local oscilla-270 tor disables eavesdropping attacks that target the transmitted local oscillator [24], and using a271 real-time phase control avoids the need for accurate and computationally heavy phase estima-272 tion techniques, often performed in post-processing within current proof-of-concept CVQKD273 experiments [25]. The system becomes particularly interesting if applied to the quadrature de-274 tection of non-Gaussian and entangled states of light in distributed photonic quantum computing275 based on measurement-induced quantum computing modules [11], in distributed quantum sens-276 ing systems [33, 34] and in quantum communication networks [22, 35]. The quadrature detec-277 tion of non-classical light with real local oscillators therefore constitute an important technique278 in future quantum photonics networks for quantum computing, quantum sensing and quantum279 communication.280\n6.
