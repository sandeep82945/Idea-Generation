    "abstractText": "Globular clusters (GCs) are proxies of the formation assemblies of their host galaxies. However, few studies exist targeting GC systems of spiral galaxies up to several effective radii. Through 12-band Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) imaging, we study the point sources around the M81/M82/NGC3077 triplet in search of new GC candidates. We develop a tailored classification scheme to search for GC candidates based on their similarity to known GCs via a principal components analysis (PCA) projection. Our method accounts for missing data and photometric errors. We report 642 new GC candidates in a region of 3.5 deg2 around the triplet, ranked according to their Gaia astrometric proper motions when available. We find tantalising evidence for an overdensity of GC candidate sources forming a bridge connecting M81 and M82. Finally, the spatial distribution of the GC candidates (g \u2212 i) colours is consistent with halo/intra-cluster GCs, i.e. it gets bluer as they get further from the closest galaxy in the field. We further employ a regression-tree based model to estimate the metallicity distribution of the GC candidates based on their J-PLUS bands. The metallicity distribution of the sample candidates is broad and displays a bump towards the metal-rich end. Our list increases the population of GC candidates around the triplet by 3-fold, stresses the usefulness of multi-band surveys in finding these objects, and provides a testbed for further studies analysing their spatial distribution around nearby (spirals) galaxies.",

            "text": "Understanding the assembly history of the baryonic content in galaxies is pivotal for studying the cosmic growth of large-scale structures. Globular clusters (GC) are found around galaxies spanning an extensive range of masses, from dwarfs to giants (Brodie & Strader 2006;\n\u2605 E-mail: ana.chies@ufrgs.br \u2020 E-mail: drsouza@shao.ac.cn \u2021 E-mail: jpcaso@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar\nBeasley 2020) and are discrete bright beacons that help shed light on the evolution of their host galaxies up to distances of hundreds of Mpc (Harris et al. 2017; Alamo-Mart\u00ednez & Blakeslee 2017). In addition to their high intrinsic brightness, another property makes them of vital interest to galaxy evolution studies. Having mean ages older than \u223c10Gyrs (Strader et al. 2005; Chies-Santos et al. 2011b) GCs act as fossil tracers of galaxy evolution and its environment.\nThe properties of GC systems are intrinsically related to the accretion history of their host galaxies not only through the physical\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n11 47\n2v 2\n[ as\nprocesses ruling their origin (Kru\u0133ssen et al. 2019, Choksi & Gnedin 2019) but also due to subsequent assembly episodes that shape their current properties through the contribution of accreted populations (e.g. Forbes et al. 2011a, Caso et al. 2017, Longobardi et al. 2018, Villaume et al. 2020, Fensch et al. 2020). GCs are not only found in the bodies of their host galaxies but also free floating in galaxy clusters, not necessarily bound to a host galaxy (Blakeslee 1999, Bassino et al. 2003; West et al. 1995; Lee et al. 2010; Alamo-Mart\u00ednez & Blakeslee 2017, Harris et al. 2020). The Virgo, the Fornax, the Coma and the Abell 1689 galaxy clusters all appear to have rich populations of intracluster GCs. Moreover, the Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxies Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC) have a bridge population of GCs (e.g. Bica et al. 2015). Further out in the Local Group (LG), a rich population of stream GCs has been uncovered by the Pandas Survey in M31 (e.g. Huxor et al. 2014) as well as a population of intragroup GCs, not associated with any particular galaxy from the LG (Di Tullio Zinn & Zinn 2015a). Several studies point to the relevance of the environment in the build-up and later evolution of GC systems (De B\u00f3rtoli et al. 2022), including stripping (Bassino et al. 2006) and potential signs of supra-galactic formation processes (Forte et al. 2019). This is supported by the constant GCto-halo mass relation, described in both observational (e.g. Hudson et al. 2014; Harris et al. 2017) and numerical studies (e.g. El-Badry et al. 2019; Reina-Campos et al. 2021; Doppel et al. 2021), and their common use in the literature as dynamical tracers of the galaxy halo (e.g. Schuberth et al. 2012; Alabi et al. 2017). In addition to the GC systems associated with the Milky Way, galaxies in the LG and a few other exceptions (e.g. Gonz\u00e1lezL\u00f3pezlira et al. 2017, 2019), GC system studies have traditionally targeted early-type galaxies (ETGs). In ETGs, GCs are found in large numbers and are more easily detectable against a smoother galactic background. Age-metallicity distribution of GCs for Milky Way-type simulations at the present-day Universe show a remarkable variety of distributions, which arises due to differences in the formation and assembly histories of the host galaxies (Kru\u0133ssen et al. 2019, Choksi et al. 2018, Li & Gnedin 2019). Although the halo to total mass relation seems to rule the richness of a GC system, observational studies point to second-order differences based on the morphological type, with late-type galaxies appearing less efficient per unit mass in forming GCs, and having metal-rich GC fractions slightly higher than early-types (Harris et al. 2015). The extension of the GC system and the properties of those GCs located in the distant halo might also be relevant to describe the evolutionary history of the system (e.g. Marchi-Lasch et al. 2019). In this sense, the brightest galaxies in the LG arise as a natural reference for spiral galaxies. For instance, Laevens et al. (2014) found a Galactic GC at a distance of \u223c 145 kpc, and Hernitschek et al. (2019) used RRLyrae to measure precise spatial distances to 13 Galactic GCs, spanning up to 90 kpc, and a fraction of unknown distant GCs are yet to be found (Webb & Carlberg 2021). Going further out from our spiral neighbour Andromeda Di Tullio Zinn & Zinn (2015b) uncovered distant GCs associated with M31. They surveyed a large portion of the LG, resulting in 17 candidates associated with M31 GCs with projected distances of 137 kpc. This same work found five intragroup GC candidates not associated with any particular galaxy. Hence, wide-field studies of GC systems associated with nearby spirals are critical to a comprehensive picture of GCs and their role in galaxy evolution. The region around the M81/M82/NGC3077 triplet (from now one refereed as the triplet) has been the subject of several campaigns targeting its stellar cluster systems. However, they target regions close to the respective host galaxies. A detailed picture of the GC population in the vicinity of this interacting system is still unknown. M81\nis a spiral located at 3.6Mpc (Tully et al. 2013), being the dominant galaxy of a group conformed by \u223c 30 members. The foreground extinction in the direction of M81 is \u223c 0.16 in the r-band (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). It is classified as a spiral with a classical bulge by Fisher & Drory (2008), and its bulge mass is huge given its stellar halo mass, occupying an unusual region in the bulge mass-stellar halo mass diagram in the sample of Bell et al. (2017). It presents a stellar mass of \u223c 3 \u2212 8.5 \u00d7 1010M (Karachentsev & Kudrya 2014 and Oehm et al. 2017) and a dark matter halo mass of \u223c 1\u00d71012M , (Oehm et al. 2017). Its halo shows a flat colour profile, indicating negligible halo population variations as a function of galactocentric distances (Monachesi et al. 2013). Perelmuter et al. (1995) present the kinematics and metallicity of 25 GCs in M81 from 82 bright spectra of GC candidates and computes relative strengths of H\ud835\udeff, CaI \ud835\udf064227, and FeI \ud835\udf064045 absorption lines to distinguish stellar images of M81 globular clusters from stars in the Milky Way. Nantais & Huchra (2010) obtain spectra for 74 GCs in M81, finding a mean GC metallicity of \u223c-1.06, higher than either M31 or the Milky Way. The authors report a similar rotation pattern among blue and red GC subpopulations to the Milky Way ones. Clusters at small projected radii and metal-rich clusters rotate firmly, while clusters at large projected radii and metal-poor clusters show weaker evidence of rotation. Nantais et al. (2010) present a catalogue of extended objects in the vicinity of M81 based on a set of 24 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) I-band images. They find a total of 233 good GC candidates, 92 candidate Hii regions, OB associations, or diffuse open clusters. Nantais et al. (2011) study over 400 GC candidates fromHST/ACS photometry. The blue and red GC candidates and the metal-rich and metal-poor spectroscopically confirmed clusters are similar in half-light radius. The total population of confirmed and \"good\" candidates shows an increase in half-light radius as a function of galactocentric distance. More recently, Ma et al. (2017) derives structural parameters of two old and massive GCs in the halo of M81 - GC1, GC2 through the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), the Be\u0133ing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC), the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and HST/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging. The effective radius versus \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc49 diagram shows that GC2 is an ultra-compact dwarf (UCD). M82, located at 3.5Mpc (Tully et al. 2013), has a baryonic and halo mass of \u223c 1\u00d71010M and \u223c 5\u00d71011M respectively, (Oehm et al. 2017). It is the textbook example of starburst galaxy, with a star formation rate \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc45 = 13\ud835\udc40 /\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f (Adebahr et al. 2017). The foreground extinction in the direction of M82 is estimated to be \u223c 0.32 in the rband but drops to 0.17 halfway towards M81 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). Through Subaru Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS) imaging and spectroscopy Saito et al. (2005) identify two bona fide GCs that should have formed at the epoch of M82\u2019s formation. They also identify a few young star clusters in M82, likely produced during the tidal-interaction episodewithM81. Lim et al. (2013) finds over 1000 star clusters through UBVIYJH imaging. The colours of halo clusters are similar to GCs in the Milky Way, and their ages are estimated to be older than 1 Gyr. Cuevas-Otahola et al. (2021) extracts structural parameters for a sample of 99 intermediate-age super star clusters (SSCs) in the disc of M82 and carry out a survival analysis using a semi-analytical cluster evolution code. NGC3077 is an irregular galaxy located at 3.8Mpc (Tully et al. 2013) with a baryonic and halo mass of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1010M and \u223c 5 \u00d7 1011M respectively (Oehm et al. 2017). Its foreground extinction is of \u223c0.14 in the r-band (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). Davidge (2004) investigates the near-infrared photometric properties of NGC3077 through the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Harris et al. (2004) studies the star clusters candidates of NGC3077 through HST/ACS broad\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\n(F300W, F547M, and F814W) and narrow-band (F487N and F656N) filters. They estimate the age and mass of each star cluster, which provides constraints on the recent star formation histories of the host galaxy. The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is currently undertaking observations of thousands square degrees of the sky visible from Observatorio Astrof\u00edsico de Javalambre (OAJ, Teruel, Spain; Cenarro et al. 2014) with the panoramic camera T80Cam (Mar\u00edn-Franch et al. 2015) at the Javalambre Auxiliary Survey Telescope (JAST80) using a set of 12 broad, intermediate and narrow-band optical filters (Cenarro et al. 2019, see also Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2019 for the southern counterpart, S-PLUS). The wide-field (1.4 deg \u00d7 1.4 deg) capabilities of T80Cam allow the study of nearby systems out to great galactocentric distances (see Brito-Silva et al. 2021, Buzzo et al. 2022). Our goal is to make optimum use of the J-PLUS photometric bands to identify extragalactic GCs candidates in a region of 3.5 deg2 around the M81 triplet. Most studies focus on two main criteria to identify GCs, ranging from simple cuts in colour space to fits of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our study employs an approach that naturally utilises the full information provided by the J-PLUS SEDs while accounting for missing data and photometric errors applying a principled statistical learning technique. We organise the paper as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the JPLUS data details and outline the photometric procedures adopted to extract a list of point sources in the analysed pointings. In Sect. 3 we present the heuristic GC search methodology procedure adopted and the training sample literature data used that allowed us to derive a list of candidate GCs around the triplet. In Sect. 4 we show the analysis and results, and finally, in Sect. 5 we present a summary and the concluding remarks."

In this work, the analysis is limited to the region spanning 148.4 deg < RA < 151.1 deg and DE > 68 deg (see Figure 1), which matches the H i emission described in de Blok et al.

            "text": "The J-PLUS DR2 catalogue offers a list of detected sources for each fieldwith their corresponding estimatedmagnitudes. The detection of sources is good enough at large galactocentric distances. However, the completeness of the J-PLUS catalogue significantly decreases in the vicinity of galaxies, making it mandatory to pre-process the images to recover objects in such regions. Here, we require aperture corrected magnitudes and a homogeneous treatment of the data, hence the photometry was rerun for all 12 J-PLUS filters across the 3 pointings analysed. Based on bright point sources from the images, the seeing typically spans 1 \u2212 1.5 arcsec, with some degradation towards the blue side of the spectral range. There are examples of extended clusters in the literature, whose nature have been largely discussed (e.g. Brodie et al. 2011; Br\u00fcns & Kroupa 2012; Norris et al. 2019). However the mean effective radius for old GCs is \u223c 3 pc (e.g. Harris 1996, 2010 Edition; Peng et al. 2008), i.e. \u223c 0.2 arcsec at the distance of M81, which is close to the limit of detection for several devoted algorithms (e.g. ISHAPE, Larsen 1999). Therefore, we assume that GCs can be treated as point sources in the following. We run a median filter of size 100 px on each J-PLUS filter, and then subtracted it from the original image. This procedure slightly increases the noise of the images, but the removal of the extended emission of the galaxies largely improves the source detection. The initial catalogues are build using SExtractor version 2.19.5 (Bertin & Arnouts 1996a) in dual mode with the \ud835\udc5f filter acting as a reference image. We consider every group of three connected pixels with a number of counts above 2\ud835\udf0e the sky level as a positive detection. The analysis threshold is 2\ud835\udf0e above sky level, except for the filters\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nbluer than \ud835\udc54, for which we reduced the threshold to 1\ud835\udf0e. Aperture photometry is performed in the 12 filters, assuming in each case an integer aperture diameter close to 3 times the FWHM of point sources. Several bright and isolated stars are used to build the point spread function (PSF) and to calculate the aperture corrections in different sections of the fields, focused on the region analysed in this work. Such aperture corrections span 0.14 \u2212 0.30mag. Finally, zero points for each field and filter are calculated from the crossmatch of the sources with the J-PLUS photometric catalogue. To this end, a second aperture photometry run is carried out, with a standard diameter of 5.45 px (\u223c 3 arcsec), to facilitate the comparison with the photometric catalogue from the J-PLUS Data Release 2. In all cases, more than 100 bright sources are used, and the scatter ranges from 0.01 to 0.04mag. At this point, the photometric catalogue that spans the 3 J-PLUS fields described above contains 17,800 sources."

This leads to a similar FWHM distribution for sources from the three fields, with a sudden peak at 2 px, and a smooth slope towards larger values. A preliminary catalogue of point-sources is built from sources presenting FWHM < 6 px and a stellarity index from SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996b) in the \ud835\udc5f filter larger than 0.5. Such criteria have proven to be useful to discard the majority of the extended sources but relaxed enough to be fulfilled by sources embedded in the disk of M81. Additionally, since we aim to perform a multi-band analysis, we require sources to have as many photometric data points as possible. The completeness drops towards the blue direction of the spectral range, and it is particularly low in the \ud835\udc62 band. For this reason, we choose to exclude sources with photometry available in less than 11 filters. This results in a final sample of 7 200 point-like sources. The 90-percentile of the photometric errors in the \ud835\udc5f filter, assumed as the reference one, increases from 0.01 at \ud835\udc5f = 17mag to 0.1 at \ud835\udc5f = 20.5mag."

Following this, we applied the filtering and repeated the SExtractor photometry in the same manner. The results show that the filtering does not affect the photometry, with a typical scatter after removing outliers of 0.12mag for artificial stars brighter than \ud835\udc5f = 20mag.

Even a couple of intragroup GCs in the region between M81 and M82 have already been reported (Jang et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2017). As an\nexample, we show the J-PLUS SED of GC-2 from Jang et al. (2012), in Figure 2, along side its SDSS spectrum. We gather a sample of 105 GCs that have spectroscopy available. In the majority of cases, objects are marginally resolved through observations, but for some, the classification as GCs was based on the relative strengths of spectral lines (Perelmuter et al. 1995). This spectroscopic sample of literature confirmedGCs is listed inTableA1 (see Appendix A). The crossmatch between these 105 objects and the 7,200 source catalogue described in Section 2.1.2 leads to 73 objects, whose locus on the colour-magnitude diagram is highlighted in Figure 3. Marginal distributions are shown on the side panels re-scaled to have a maximum height of one per group for clarity. All subsequent marginals shown in the paper will follow a similar normalisation. Another 21 objects are detected in such catalogue. However, photometry is only available for a subset of the filters. In section 3 we use the 73 previously known GCs with J-PLUS photometry in at least 11 filters as our training set."

Besides, it allows us\nto automatically exploit the bulk of the information available in the 12 J-PLUS filters instead of relying on a few ad-hoc combinations.

Figure 5 shows the missing pattern of our data, from which 81.5 per cent have complete information, 13.3 per cent are missing the u band, and 1.7 per cent are missing u and J430 bands together. Hence, a naive removal of rows presenting missing information would throw away a non-negligible amount of data.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nThe imputation here is not meant to provide \"true\" values for the missing bands but to marginalise them, thus enabling to use of the entire dataset. We employ aMultiple Copula Imputation (MCI). The method decomposes joint probability distributions into theirmarginal distributions and a copula function that couples them (Nelsen 2010). Recently, Kuhn et al. (2021) used the method of MCI to aid the construction of the SPICY catalogue of young stellar objects in the Galactic midplane. Noteworthy applications of copula to astronomy include Sato et al. (2011), and Lin et al. (2016), who constructed likelihood functions for weak lensing analysis, and Andreani et al. (2018) that inferred bivariate luminosity andmass functions of galaxies. Previous tests suggest that this method outperforms other popular approaches, such as multiple imputations via chained equations (Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011) and Amelia (Honaker et al. 2011), in terms of bias and coverage, especially for non-Gaussian distributed variables (Hoff 2007). The underlying idea of MCI is to derive conditional density functions of the missing variables given the observed ones through the corresponding conditional copulas and then impute missing values by drawing observations from them. Although the method employs a Bayesian marginalisation under the hood, a critical difference is an assumption regarding the joint distribution of the data. The typical approach usually marginalises missing values under the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution. At the same time, the copula imputation relaxes such assumptions and computes the imputation on a transformed space (the copula space). In the present work we implement the MCI using the sbgcop package (Hoff 2018) within the r language (R Core Team 2019). Copulas fit simultaneously to both training and target datasets. For a detailed discussion about Copula and applications, we refer the reader to Hofert et al. (2018)."

Because of its versatility, PCA is utilised in a broad range of astronomical studies (e.g., Ishida & de Souza 2011; Ishida et al. 2011; Ishida & de Souza 2013; De Souza et al. 2014; Wild et al. 2014; Maltby et al. 2018; Yohana et al. 2021).

We then disregard any point source that failed to match any given GC at least once. The choice of 50 ensures the stability of the search. Increasing this number does not affect the list of candidates. This process leads to a list of 642 candidates, which we flag accordingly to Gaia proper motions, i.e., if \ud835\udf07 is higher or lower than 3.6mas yr\u22121 (see Figure 4), which represents the 95 percent quantiles of the current distribution of known GCs or not available. We note that if we assume a typical GC tangential velocity of 250 km/s, a more strict cut of \u223c 0.014mas yr\u22121 (assuming a distance of 3.6 Mpc) should take place. However, the existence of spectroscopically confirmed GCs with measured proper motions > 10mas yr\u22121 suggests that a non-negligible measurement scatter around sources with nearly zero proper motion. Hence, this criterion does not represent a hard cut for the candidate\u2019s credibility, but it conveys a simple rule to tag the most probable candidates. Figure 7 shows the candidates projected in two principal components and conveys the intuition behind our approach; the method is conservative in the sense that it only flags within the coverage of the known GCs and in the densest regions. Despite their limited size, the samples of galactic stars and background galaxies described in Section 2.3 convey some complementary information to test our procedure. Firstly, none of the Galactic stars and just one of the background galaxies were included in our selection of candidates to GCs. Besides, more than 60 per cent of the galactic stars have proper motion larger than 3.6mas yr\u22121. Thus, in section 4 we use this flag in the plots analysing the GC candidates colours and spatial distribution."

While most of the previously known GCs are close to M81, the new GC candidates appear to be distributed across the entire region. The count distribution of GC candidates with over-plotted density contours shown in the right panel of Figure 8 reveals an overdensity of GC candidates extending from M81 in the direction of M82. Such count excess provides tantalising evidence of a GC bridge. Although a bridge of H i gas between M81 and M82 is evident from de Blok et al. (2018), see Figure 1, a bridge of GCs between these galaxies has not yet been reported. A bridge of GCs has been found to exist between the SMC and LMC (Bica et al. 2015). If we go further out in the local group, towards Andromeda, the density of GCs around M31 seems higher in the direction of M33, along the major axis of the galaxy, if\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\ncompared to the opposite direction (see Fig. 1 of Huxor et al. 2009). In Appendix C we further discuss the potential bridge taking into account the different proper motion samples (Figure C1). Another interesting feature of Figure 8 is the absence of cluster candidates towards the south of M81, opposite to the location of M82. Moreover, we do not see many GC-like objects close to NGC3077. This could be due to the fact that the stellar cluster population of this galaxy is dominated by younger clusters, whose SEDs differ from that of old globulars. Therefore, our methodology does not extract such objects from the data. The (\ud835\udc54\u2212\ud835\udc56) colour of the candidates as a function of their minimum projected distance to the pair M81/M82 are indicated in Figure 9. As expected, there is a marginal increase in the population of redder GCs closer to the galaxy, indicating a metallicity gradient. Although the direct separation of two colour modes into two metallicity modes should be taken carefully (Chies-Santos et al. 2012; Blakeslee et al. 2012; Powalka et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2019; Fahrion et al. 2020), the colours in optical bands have largely been used to separate GCs in bluer and redder GCs (\u2018more metal-poor\u2019 and \u2018more metal-rich\u2019, respectively), that present distinct behaviours in their spatial distribution (Bassino et al. 2006; Escudero et al. 2015) and kinematics (Schuberth et al. 2010; Pota et al. 2013). This has been suggested as a consequence of the processes ruling the build-up of the GC system (Forbes et al. 2011b; Choksi et al. 2018; Kru\u0133ssen et al. 2019). From Figure 9 it is clear that the GC systems in the triplet fit with the picture of redder GCs being more concentrated towards the centre of the hosts while the bluer ones being more extended to larger distances from the centre of the host and dominating at larger radii (Bassino et al. 2006; Brodie & Strader 2006; Beasley 2020)."

Figure 10 show6 representative colour-colour diagrams for the selected sources in the J-PLUS narrow and broad-band filters. The distribution of the sources seem plausible since most of the candidates are within the coverage of the known GCs. However, the candidates with higher proper motions (\ud835\udf07 > 3.6 mas yr\u22121) are overall more spread than their lower proper motion counterparts. To illustrate the foreground extinction and to allow for easy comparison with other GC systems, we show a reddening vector calculated assuming \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc35\u2212\ud835\udc49) = 0.068\u00b1 0.012 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011) towards the direction of the centre of the field analysed in this work. In Figure 11 we show narrow and broad-band colour distributions for point sources, spectroscopically confirmed GCs and GC candidates. From the distributions, it is clear that our methodology selects GC candidates roughly consistent with the spectroscopically confirmed GCs in most colours and excludes very red objects (see, e.g. the (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) distributions) that are consistent with background galaxies. In commonly used optical colours such as (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) (Harris et al. 2016) and (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 \ud835\udc67) (Peng et al. 2006, Beasley et al. 2018) our sample of GC candidates peaks at slightly bluer colours, if compared to the spectroscopically confirmed GCs. This goes in hand with what is seen in Figure 9 and is not surprising, given that blue GCs are expected to dominate at large galactocentric radii. Looking at the (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) distribution of candidates, we find that 85 per cent of the low proper motion candidates fall in the range 0.6 < (\ud835\udc54 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) < 1.6mag, which is in agreement with the typical colours of extragalactic GCs in this photometric system (e.g. Sinnott et al. 2010; Chies-Santos et al. 2011a; Faifer et al. 2011; Caso et al. 2019; Ennis et al. 2020) under the assumption of foreground reddening \ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc54\u2212\ud835\udc56) \u223c 0.13mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011). Moreover, there is a tail of candidates presenting (\ud835\udc54\u2212\ud835\udc56) > 1.6mag, they are mainly fainter than \ud835\udc5f = 19mag and \u223c 2/3 of them have higher proper motion values."

            "text": "Based on the sample of 73 spectroscopically confirmed GCs with derived metallicities (Nantais & Huchra 2010), we build a function to map the metallicity distribution of confirmed GCs to their respective photometric bands in order to infer the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the GC candidates. More specifically, we model the GC metallicity as a function of J-PLUS photometric bands with XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin 2016), a scalable regression-tree-based model that outperforms deep-learning-based approaches when it is comes to model tabular data (Shwartz-Ziv & Armon 2021). In a nutshell, the intuition behind different regression models relies on how we approximate the underlying relationship between a given response variable, here defined by the metallicity, and a set of covariates, herein represented by the first two PCs. The choice for only two PCs is motivated by both being able to explain more than 97 percent of the data variance. In a hypothetical scenario where the relationship could be amenable by a linear regression model, the linear relation would be written as:\n[\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52/\ud835\udc3b] = \ud835\udefd0 + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc361 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362. (6)\nWhere \ud835\udefd0 is the intercept and \ud835\udefd1 and \ud835\udefd2 are the respective slopes of each covariate. On the other hand, is a preconceived parametric regression does not exists or is unknown, a non-parametric approach is needed. Different solutions have been proposed in the literature, notable examples include additive models, kernel-based models, neural\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nnetworks and regression-tree models. While a comprehensive discussion about non-parametric regression is beyond the scope of this paper, the underlying intuition behind tree-based models is to approximate the unknown relation by a series of additive functions: [\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52/\ud835\udc3b] = \ud835\udc3e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc361, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc362). (7)\nEach \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58 corresponds to an independent tree structure \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc99, \ud835\udc47\u210e), where \ud835\udc54 is a step function and \ud835\udc47\u210e is the \u210e-\ud835\udc61\u210e tree. The model then partitions the space of covariates and fits a series of trees in each of them. We choose XGBoost because empirical results have shown that it enables us to uncover complex relationswithout fine-tuning. Furthermore, we perform a PCA regression instead of using all twelve J-PLUS filters to mitigate co-linearity and over-fitting. Figure 12 displays a pairwise correlation matrix of the filters and PCs. The filters are highly\ncorrelated, a feature known to cause regression models instability. The PCs, on the other hand, show weak to moderate correlation \u2013 a desiderata for any regression analysis. Figure 13 displays the correlation between the first two PCs and the J-PLUS filters. The first PC correlates strongly with most of the colours, except for the \ud835\udc62-band, which is expected since most colours are highly correlated. To convey intuition about the model solution, the left panel of Figure 14 depicts the regression plane between the first two PCs and the [Fe/H] abundance. The colours represent different bins of metallicity. The points depict the metallicities of the training sample, while the contours the predicted value by the XGBoost. The right panel shows the predicted metallicities as open circles and the metallicities of known GCs as solid circles. In Figure 15 we show the MDF of the GC candidates and the spectroscopically confirmed GCs with metallicities available (including our training sample). We stress that we are using a small and biased training sample, which is far from ideal. Nevertheless, it can give us a grasp of our sample GC candidates\u2019 MDF shape. The top panel of Figure 15 shows that the MDF of the GC candidates is broad, -2.5 . [Fe/H] . 0.5, but has an important tail towards the metal-rich end (-0.5 . [Fe/H] . 0.7). A comparison to the work of Caldwell et al. (2011) and the catalogue published in Caldwell &Romanowsky (2016) for the M31 GC system (bottom panel of Figure 15) shows similarities, including such metal-rich tail at similar values. While the Milky Way GC system shows two clear peaks, this is not seen for either M31 or the M81/M82 systems. A visual inspection of Figure 15 indicates that our method is conservative and does not select GC candidates towards the tails of the MDF of the spectroscopically confirmed GCs. Thus, we caution the reader that we are not complete towards the extremes of metallicity distribution."

            "text": "To build a large and homogeneous catalogue ofGC candidates around the M81/M82/NGC3077 triplet with 12 J-PLUS broad and narrowbands in 3 pointings, we develop a tailored statistical model. Our model accounts for missing data and small training sets and uses uncertainty aware PCA to flag GC candidates from a sample of point sources, starting from a training set of 73 spectroscopically confirmed GCs that we recover in J-PLUS. GCs are proxies of the formation assemblies of their host galaxies (Brodie & Strader 2006; Beasley 2020) and of their environments (Lee et al. 2010; Huxor et al. 2014; Alamo-Mart\u00ednez & Blakeslee 2017; De B\u00f3rtoli et al. 2022). With the lack of wide-field studies targeting GC systems of spiral galaxies (Kru\u0133ssen et al. 2019), such a catalogue is timely. This work showcases the power of principled statistical techniques allied with multi-band surveys in finding extragalactic GCs in and beyond the outskirts of their host galaxy in the local Universe. Our list increases the population of GC candidates around the triplet by 3-fold and provides a testbed for further studies of GC spatial distribution around spirals galaxies.\nWe study the spatial distribution of the candidate clusters and report an over-density of GC candidates, forming a potential bridge connecting M81 and M82. Interestingly, we do not recover a significant population of GC-like objects around NGC3077, probably due to the fact that the star cluster population of such galaxy is not made of old GCs, but of younger objects, whose SEDs are not part of our training sample. As expected, blue GCs dominate at more considerable distances from M81 and M82.\nThe power of our method is further tested against colour-colour diagrams and colour distributions of the point sources, the confirmed GCs and GC candidates. The bulk of our candidates tends to have bluer colours in typical (\ud835\udc54\u2212 \ud835\udc56) and (\ud835\udc54\u2212 \ud835\udc67) colours than the confirmed GCs. Our method generally excludes very red objects, typical of background galaxies. We further map the metallicity distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed GCs into the metallicity distribution of the sample candidates. Furthermore, find that the MDF of GC candidates is in the range of -2.5 . [Fe/H] . 0.5, but has a tail towards the metal-rich end (-0.5 . [Fe/H] . 0.7), similar to what is seen in the GC system of M31 (Caldwell et al. 2011). We present a few SEDs for GC candidates and discuss them in light of what is expected for GC systems.\nThe method presented here can be straightforwardly applied to other nearby systems in J-PLUS and S-PLUS surveys and more remote systems with the upcoming J-PAS survey. For the specific system studied in this work M81/M82/NGC3077, future developments include follow-up observations of a randomly selected sample of our candidate clusters in order to better quantify the contamination rate, SED fitting to derive stellar population parameters of a cleaner\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201320 (2022)\nsample of GC candidates and a dedicated study to characterise the properties of the bridge of GCs connecting M81 and M82."

Spatial distribution in Aitoff projection of GC candidates divided by proper motion categories.\ntheir joint range of wavelength matches with that of the \ud835\udc3a band, with slightly different transmission curves (Evans et al. 2018). The similarity between these passbands leads to the definition of the flux ratio, (\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc43 + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43)/\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3a , as a proxy of crowded regions. Although the flux ratio from the Gaia passbands, (\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc43 + \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43)/\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3a , is assumed as an indication of crowded regions, large values can also represent extended objects. This is particularly relevant in the case of GCs in nearby systems, like the M82/M82/NGC3077 triplet, for which the typical effective radii (\u223c 0.2 arcsec, from reff \u223c 3 pc, e.g. Harris 1996, 2010 Edition, and Caso et al. 2014, and the distance assumed in this paper) is comparable to the pixel scale for the Gaia astrometric CCD (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). Figure D1 shows the flux excess for GC candidates as a function of the (\ud835\udc54\u2212 \ud835\udc56) colour with blue squares. The majority of the GC candidates present flux excess close to unity, as expected from point sources (FigureD1 and Fabricius et al. 2021). Still, there are \u223c 20 plausible candidates and a few less plausible ones with flux excess larger than 2. In contrast, almost all the flux excess for Galactic stars and background galaxies are below 2. However, we are aware that several confirmed GCs also present flux excess close to unity. This feature cannot be used to unequivocally separate GCs from Galactic stars in our sample (but see Voggel et al. 2020)."

For such GCs, we calculated simulated magnitudes in the broad-bands from J-PLUS through the SSPs from the CMD 3.1 web interface5, by means of the PARSEC evolutionary tracks (Bressan et al. 2012) and a Chabrier log-normal initial mass function, and a fiducial age of 10Gyrs.

(2019). We note that the procedure is largely uncertain, due to the combination of the errors in the spectroscopic metallicities, the assumption of a fiducial age for all the GCs, systematic effects from the SSPs, and the photometric errors. However, it serves the purpose to estimate a mean \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 . By restricting the sample to GCs at projected distances from the galaxy centre to be larger than 12 arcmin, the mean absorptions from the broad-band colours are around \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 \u223c 0.19\u22120.22mag. The estimated absorptions for these GCs should be ruled by Galactic foreground extinction, which is settled at \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 \u223c 0.22mag from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). The GCs at less than 12 arcmin from M81 centre are typically embedded in its disk, their mean absorption reach \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 \u223c 0.44 \u2212 0.48mag leading to a mean intrinsic absorption in the disk of M81 of \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc49 \u223c 0.22 \u2212 0.26mag.
