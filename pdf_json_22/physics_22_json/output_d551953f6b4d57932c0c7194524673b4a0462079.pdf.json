In the realm of Bell\u2019s nonlocality [4], the presence of nonlocal character or entanglement is witnessed by the violation of Bell inequality. In the earliest quantum information theory era, it is believed that the entanglement is the complete manifestation of nonlocality of a quantum system.\nSince the inception of Werner\u2019s work [5] and quantum discord [6], it has been debated whether the entanglement can manifest the nonlocal aspects of a quantum system or not. Buscemi showed that entanglement is considered as the complete manifestation of nonlocality. In other words, \u201dall entangled quantum states are nonlocal\u201d [7]. On the other hand, Werner constructed a mixed state family, which admits the local hidden variable model even the state is entangled [5]. Further, it is shown that the presence of noise or mixedness is responsible for the destroying nonlocal correlation between local constituents of the composite system, and hence some of the mixed entangled states behave locally [8]. Ollivier and Zurek introduced a measure called, quantum discord to quantify the quantum correlations beyond entanglement. It can capture the correlation between the marginal states which cannot grasp by the entanglement [6]. Recently, a new variant of nonlocality, called measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) is introduced [9]. MIN is based on the fact that local disturbance due to locally invariant von Neumann projective measurements on the marginal state can influence globally. MIN is quite different from the entanglement and violation of the Bell inequalities, more importantly it goes beyond entanglement.\nIn quantum entanglement swapping experiment, the independence between the multi-sources induces the nonlocal behavior of probability distributions and is called nonbilocal correlations [10,11]. This kind of correlation is demonstrated and captured using nonlinear inequalities and one important class of these inequalities is the so-called binary-input-and-output bilocality inequality which is known as the bilocality inequality [10,11]. In recent times, the considerable progress has been made in this context [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Gisin et al. have shown that pair of entangled states can violate the bilocality inequality, implying that tensorizing states may possess nonlocal correlation [22].\nWhen two bipartite states with vanishing correlation are combined, it is always interesting to check that the tensorizing state possess any nonlocal advantage or not. It is shown recently that the combining two quantum systems exhibit better quantum advantages than the individual system. This is known as superactivation of nonlocality, symbolized as 0+0 > 0 and it cannot occur in the classical world. The superactivation of nonlocality provides an answer for \u201dcan the state \u03c1\u2297\u03c1 be nonlocal if the \u03c1 is local\u201d. Recently, Palazuelos explained the superactivation of quantum nonlocality in the sense of violating certain Bell inequalities with an entangled bound state [23]. The same study is carried out in the context of tensor networks [24,25]. Further, the superactivation was also considered for arbitrary entangled states by allowing local preprocessing on the tensor product of different quantum states (\u03c1\u2297 \u03c1\u2032) [26] and symbolized\nas 1 + 0 > 1. With our best knowledge, the quantification of this nonbilocal correlation is limited in the literature.\nTo quantify the nonbilocal correlation, we extend the notion of bipartite measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) to a bilocal quantum system. This paper proposes a new version of the non-bilocal correlation measure. The relation between the nonlocal and non-bilocal correlation measure is established, and it is shown that non-bilocality is always greater than the nonlocal correlation. Further, the upper bound of the bilocal correlation measure is obtained for the arbitrary mixed input states. To validate the properties of nonbilocal measure, we study the proposed quantity for a few examples.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we review the notion of measurement-induced nonlocality and provide the definition of affinity based MIN. In Sec. 3, we introduce a nonbilocal measure based on the affinity induced metric and we derive the analytical formula of the measure when the input states are pure. Considering the input states are arbitrary mixed states, the upper bounds of bilocal correlation are presented in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5, the proposed measure studied for a few examples. Finally, in Sec. 6 we present the conclusion."

            "text": "To capture the bipartite quantum correlation beyond entanglement, Luo and Fu introduced a new measure of quantum correlation called measurementinduced nonlocality (MIN) using locally invariant projective measurement. It is originally defined as maximal square of Hilbert-Schmidt norm of difference of pre- and post- measurement states and is defined as [9]\nN(\u03c1) = max\u03a0a \u2016\u03c1\u2212\u03a0a(\u03c1)\u20162, (1)\nwhere the maximization is taken over the von Neumann projective measurements on subsystem a, \u03a0a(\u03c1) = \u2211\nk(\u03a0 a k \u2297 1b)\u03c1(\u03a0ak \u2297 1b), and \u03a0a = {\u03a0ak} =\n{|k\u3009\u3008k|} being the projective measurements on the subsystem a, which do not change the marginal state \u03c1a locally i.e., \u03a0a(\u03c1a) = \u03c1a. Here \u2016O\u2016 = \u221a TrO\u2020O is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of operatorO. The dual of this quantity is geometric discord (GD) of the given state \u03c1 and it is defined as [27,28]\nD(\u03c1) = min\u03a0a \u2016\u03c1\u2212\u03a0a(\u03c1)\u20162. (2)\nIn general, if \u03c1a is nondegenerate, then the optimization is not required and the above measures are equal. This is more general than the conventionally mentioned quantum nonlocality related to Bell\u2019s version of nonlocality. Apart from the quantification of bipartite quantum correlation, this quantity provides a novel classification scheme for bipartite states, and is a useful resource quite different from entanglement. In particular, MIN is a more secured resource for cryptographic communication. Due to its geometric nature, MIN is easy to compute and realizable. Nevertheless, both the MIN and geometric discord are\nnot useful quantifiers of quantum correlation due to the local ancilla problem, which is pointed out by Piani [29]. A natural way to circumvent this issue is to modify the definition of MIN using any contractive distance measure. One such distance measure between the states \u03c1 and \u03c3 is defined as\ndA(\u03c1, \u03c3) = 1\u2212A(\u03c1, \u03c3), (3)\nwhere A(\u03c1, \u03c3) = Tr (\u221a \u03c1 \u221a \u03c3 )\nis the affinity between the states. Analogous to fidelity [30], the affinity is also a measure of closeness between the states \u03c1 and \u03c3 [31,32] and shares all the properties of fidelity [30]. Also, affinity is useful in the quantification of nonclassical correlations [34,35] and quantum coherence [36]. It is worth mentioning that the affinity between the states is realizable using the quantum circuit [33]. Due to its realization, affinity based measures may have a good impact in the research of quantum information.\nThe affinity-based MIN is defined as [35]\nNMINA (\u03c1) = max \u03a0a dA(\u03c1,\u03a0 a(\u03c1)) = 1\u2212 min\u03a0a Tr ( \u221a \u03c1\u03a0a( \u221a \u03c1)) . (4)\nHere also the optimization is taken over von Neumann projective measurements. It is worth reiterating that the NA(\u03c1) fixes the local ancilla problem using the multiplicative property of affinity. Hence, NMINA (\u03c1) is a faithful quantifier of quantum correlation or quantumness of the system. Further, we have shown that affinity based MIN is closely related to local quantum uncertainty [37] and interferometric power of a quantum state [38]."

Like MIN, the nonbilocal measure is also a useful resource for cryptographic communication. Next, we demonstrate some interesting properties of nonbilocality measure given by Eq. (5).\n(i) NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd) is nonnegative, (ii) NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd) = 0 for any product states \u03c1ab = \u03c1a \u2297 \u03c1b and \u03c1cd = \u03c1c \u2297 \u03c1d.\nFurther, the nonbilocal measure also vanishes for classical-quantum state \u03c1ab = \u2211 i \u03c1 a i \u2297 pi|ib\u3009\u3008ib| and \u03c1cd = \u2211\nj qj |jc\u3009\u3008jc| \u2297 \u03c1dj . (iii) NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd) is locally unitary invariant in the sense that\nNA((Uab \u2297 Ucd)\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd(Uab \u2297 Ucd)\u2020) = NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd), (6)\nwhere Uab = Ua \u2297 Ub and Ucd = Uc \u2297 Ud are the local unitary operators. (iv) NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd) is positive, at least any one of the input states is entangled. (v) Although NA(\u03c1ab) = NA(\u03c1cd) = 0, nevertheless NA(\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd) > 0.\nSince the properties (i) - (v) are inherited directly from the properties of affinity-based MIN, we omit the proving process. Next, we establish a simple relation between the nonbilocal measure and MIN (nonlocal).\nTheorem 1: The nonbilocal measure and affinity-based MIN are connected as\nNA(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab) \u2265 NMINA (\u03c1). (7)\nProof: To prove this, first we recall the definition of affinity-based nonbilocal measure,\nNA(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab) = max\u03a0aa dA(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab, \u03a0aa(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab)), =1\u2212 min\u03a0aaA(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab, \u03a0aa(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab)), \u2265 max\u03a0a dA(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab, (\u03a0a \u2297\u03a0a)(\u03c1ba \u2297 \u03c1ab)), =1\u2212 min\u03a0a Tr( \u221a \u03c1ab \u2297 \u221a \u03c1ab)(\u03a0 a( \u221a \u03c1ab)\u2297\u03a0a( \u221a \u03c1ab)),\n=1\u2212 min\u03a0a Tr( \u221a \u03c1ab\u03a0 a( \u221a \u03c1ab)) 2, \u22651\u2212 min\u03a0a Tr( \u221a \u03c1ab\u03a0 a( \u221a \u03c1ab)), =NMINA (\u03c1),\nwhere the first inequality follows from the fact that \u03a0a\u2297\u03a0a is not necessarily optimal and the second inequality is due to the square of the affinity which is always equal to or less than the affinity. Hence the theorem is proved. The above theorem provides a closer connection between the nonbilocal and nonlocal measures and implying that the nonbilocal measure is always greater than MIN. Next, we compute the nonbilocal measure for pure input states.\nTheorem 2: Let |\u03a8ab\u3009 = \u2211\ni\n\u221a si|iaib\u3009 and |\u03a8ab\u3009 = \u2211\nj\n\u221a rj |jcjd\u3009 are the\npure input states, then\nNA(|\u03a8ab\u3009 \u2297 |\u03a8cd\u3009) = 1\u2212 \u2211\ni,j\ns4i r 4 j , (8)\nwhere si and rj are Schmidt coefficients of |\u03a8ab\u3009 and |\u03a8cd\u3009 respectively.

            "text": "Nonlocality is often related to the entanglement or violation of Bell\u2019s inequality. In this article, we have employed the nonlocality in different notion, namely measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN). Extending the definition of affinity-based MIN, we have introduced a new variant of quantifier to quantify the nonlocal correlation contained in tensorizing a local state with itself called nonbilocal correlation and also demonstrated the computational properties of the proposed measure. A closer connection between the affinity-based measurement-induced nonlcality and measurement-induced nonbilcality is also derived. An analytical formula of nonbilocal measure is derived when the input states are pure. Moreover, two upper bounds of nonbilocal measure are also obtained for mixed input state. For illustration, we have studied the nonbilocality for different input states.\nLike MIN, the nonbilocality measure may also useful resource for remote state preparation, quantum dense coding and cryptographic communication and hence, the proposed nonbilocal measure provides more insight into quantum information theory.\nAppendix\nLet |\u03a8ab\u3009 = \u2211 i si|iaib\u3009 and |\u03a8cd\u3009 = \u2211 j rj |jcjd\u3009 are the two pure input states with si and rj are the respective Schmidt coefficients of input states.\nNoting that\n\u03c1ab \u2297 \u03c1cd = |\u03a8ab\u3009\u3008\u03a8ab| \u2297 |\u03a8cd\u3009\u3008\u03a8cd| = \u2211\nii \u2032 jj \u2032\nsisi\u2032 rjrj\u2032 |ia\u3009\u3008i \u2032 a| \u2297 |ib\u3009\u3008i \u2032 b| \u2297 |jc\u3009\u3008j \u2032 c| \u2297 |jd\u3009\u3008j \u2032 d|.
