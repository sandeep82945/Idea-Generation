1. **Investigate the relationship between LC activity, worry, and memory performance in a larger sample size.** The current study had a relatively small sample size, which may have limited the power to detect some effects. A larger sample size would allow for more robust analyses and would help to confirm the findings of the current study.


2. **Examine the effects of different types of worry on LC activity and memory performance.** The current study did not distinguish between different types of worry, such as worry about memory, worry about health, or worry about finances. Future studies could investigate whether different types of worry have different effects on LC activity and memory performance.


3. **Explore the relationship between LC activity, worry, and memory performance in different age groups.** The current study focused on older adults. Future studies could investigate whether the relationship between LC activity, worry, and memory performance is similar in younger adults and children.


4. **Investigate the effects of interventions that target the LC on worry and memory performance.** If the LC is found to play a causal role in the relationship between worry and memory performance, then interventions that target the LC could potentially be used to reduce worry and improve memory performance. Future studies could investigate the effects of such interventions.


5. **Examine the relationship between LC activity, worry, and memory performance in individuals with different levels of cognitive impairment.** The current study focused on cognitively healthy older adults. Future studies could investigate whether the relationship between LC activity, worry, and memory performance is different in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
