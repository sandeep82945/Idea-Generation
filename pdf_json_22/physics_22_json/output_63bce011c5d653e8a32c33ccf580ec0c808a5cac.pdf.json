In this Paper we report on possible benefits of quantum information measures in simulations of ultrafast spin dynamics. For Co/Cu heterostructures illuminated by femtosecond laser pulses, we discuss the general behaviour of quantum information measures, in particular distances in Hilbert space and degrees of mixing in the density matrix. The measures are in particular sensitive to variations of the polarization of a laser pulse and the sample composition. Moreover, they are closely related to magnetization and number of excited electrons.",

            "text": "Ultrafast spin dynamics: complementing theoretical analyses by quantum-information measures\nFranziska Ziolkowski, Oliver Busch,\u2217 Ingrid Mertig, and J\u00fcrgen Henk Institut f\u00fcr Physik, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06099 Halle, Germany\n(Dated: April 7, 2022)\nTheoretical analyses of ultrafast spin dynamics commonly address and discuss simulated phenomena by means of observables, whereas in quantum information theory one often utilizes measures of quantum states. In this Paper we report on possible benefits of quantum information measures in simulations of ultrafast spin dynamics. For Co/Cu heterostructures illuminated by femtosecond laser pulses, we discuss the general behaviour of quantum information measures, in particular distances in Hilbert space and degrees of mixing in the density matrix. The measures are in particular sensitive to variations of the polarization of a laser pulse and the sample composition. Moreover, they are closely related to magnetization and number of excited electrons.\nKeywords: Condensed matter physics, ultrafast magnetization dynamics, spin dynamics simulations, quantum information theory\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn experiments and theoretical simulations of ultrafast spin dynamics and spin transport, one often compares results for different setups: temperature [1, 2], material composition [3\u20135], sample size and geometry [6, 7], details of a laser pulse [8\u201310] \u2014 all of which may be varied. The obtained differences are explained in terms of physical processes and quantities; to name but a few, magnetization as well as charge and spin currents. Although successful and well-established, this approach may be complemented by considering the degree of perturbation.\nTake, for example, an electronic charge current brought about by a femtosecond laser pulse, for which it is a priori not clear whether an increased photon energy causes a stronger perturbation of the quantum state. On the one hand, more energy is transferred into the system \u2013 what may be regarded as a stronger perturbation. On the other hand electrons may be excited into a regime with decreased density of states, leading to less excited states \u2014 what may be interpreted as a weaker perturbed quantum state. We recall that the amount of absorbed energy [11\u201313] or the number of excited electrons can be measured and compared to QI measures on equal footing.\nAlso quantifying the degree of perturbation by means of different observables may lead to contradicting conclusions. For example, on the one hand the degree can be estimated by means of the temperature obtained from approximating time-dependent occupation-number profiles by a Fermi-Dirac distribution [4, 14, 15]. On the other hand, the amplitude of an emitted THz signal may be utilized for this purpose [5, 16].\nThese brief reflections suggest that it would be desirable to quantify the degree of perturbation of a system independently of observables. Suitable measures are provided by quantum information (QI) theory [17, 18]. One\n\u2217 Correspondence email address: oliver.busch@physik.uni-halle.de\nsubject of QI theory is the general study of informationprocessing capabilities of quantum systems [19]. For this purpose, the utilized measures address the degree of coherence of a quantum state or the distance of two quantum states in Hilbert space. A quantum state is described by its density matrix \u03c1\u0302(t), the latter entering the timedependent expectation value\n\u3008O\u3009(t) = Tr ( \u03c1\u0302(t) O\u0302 ) (1)\nof an observable O (Ref. 20). This raises immediately a question regarding relations between observables and QI measures in spin dynamics simulations.\nIn the present work the time evolution of density matrices of inhomogeneous Co/Cu systems has been studied systematically within our computational framework evolve (for details see Ref. 21). We address four QI measures, two distance and two mixture measures. While fidelity and trace distance scale the deviation of a quantum state with respect to a reference state, purity and von Neumann entropy quantify the degree of disorder or loss of information. In the present analysis, these measures are related to the magnetization and to the number of electrons excited by the laser pulse. We conclude that QI measures are valuable theoretical tools that complement evaluations based solely on observables.\nThis Paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the QI measures (IIA), sketch the spin dynamics simulations (II B), and give details of the setup (II C). Results of the simulations are presented and discussed in Section III. We address general properties of the measures and their relation to the magnetization and the number of photo-excited electrons (IIIA). Various setups are compared in Section III B. We conclude and give an outlook in Section IV.\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n02 77\n1v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n6 A\npr 2\n02 2\n2"

Energy is transferred from the electron system into the bath, if i < j for the involved electronic states, and vice versa, if i > j . The Lindbladians account thus for thermalization of the electron system, typically on the timescale of picoseconds, but also reduce the coherences in the density matrix (that is \u2018dephasing\u2019). For details see Ref. 21.\nA typical simulation consists of three stages. Initially, the electron system is thermalized by coupling to the heat bath.

            "text": "For addressing the general behaviour of the QI measures we choose a Co/Cu chain with 20 sites each (as depicted in Fig. 1), a p-polarized laser pulse with a 10 fs wide envelope centered at t = 0 fs and a photon energy of 1.55 eV. The temperature is T = 300 K. This is the reference system used in Section III B.\nWe first discuss the time dependence of the distance measures fidelity F and trace distance T, Eqs. (3)\nand (4). The reference state \u03c1\u0302(t0) is the thermalized system at t0 = \u221250 fs.\nThe fidelity F drops by about 4 % (Fig. 2b) caused by the laser pulse (panel a). Its modulation follows the oscillations of the laser\u2019s electric field, but with twice as large a frequency, as has been checked by a Fast-Fourier transformation (FFT) of the signals (confer Fig. SM1 in the Supplemental Material [31]). This behaviour is explained as follows. Dipole transitions cause excitations and deexcitations between the electronic states, irrespectively of the sign of the electric field (cf. Fermi\u2019s golden rule [32], in which the transition probability is proportional to cos2(\u03c9t) = [1+cos(2\u03c9t)]/2). The probability for both processes is largest if the electric field is maximal or minimal. Moreover, the excited electrons propagate within the sample, so that excitation and de-excitation are not reciprocal processes, in particular in inhomogeneous systems. As a result, the fidelity decreases \u2018under the laser pulse\u2019. After the pulse F increases very slowly, caused by the coupling to the heat bath, i. e. the quantum state relaxes toward the initially thermalized state \u03c1\u0302(t0).\nThe trace distance T displays the same qualitative features as the fidelity (Fig. 2c): modulations and a net increased distance. A closer inspection shows that T \u2018reacts\u2019 slightly faster to the laser-induced changes than F : compare the onsets of the spectra at t \u2248 \u221210 fs.\nWe now turn to the mixture measures purity \u03b3 and von Neumann entropy S, Eqs. (6) and (7). The thermalization imposes a Fermi-Dirac-type distribution of the occupation probabilities, which yields an initial purity of \u03b3(t0) \u2248 0.00249, a value considerably larger than that of the maximally mixed state with \u03b3 = 1/d = 1/720 \u2248 0.0014 (Fig. 2d). The laser pulse introduces coherences pij(t) in the density matrix (via dipole transitions) and, thus, decreases the purity (increases the mixing) with a relative drop by about 5 %. After the laser pulse the mixing is reduced due to mediation by the heat bath; the purity increases slowly (cf. panel d). There is an extremely small modulation with the laser\u2019s electric field (not visible in the Figure), in contrast to the sizable ones observed for fidelity and trace distance [33]. The von Neumann entropy behaves qualitatively similar to the purity (panel e).\nSummarizing briefly at this point, a laser pulse changes the electronic quantum state, here in the order of a few per cent, as is quantified by fidelity and trace distance. And it increases the mixing in the same order of magnitude. The two distance measures behave very similarly, as do the mixture measures.\nSince the QI measures address the entire system, we compare their time dependencies with that of two observables: magnetization and number of photo-excited electrons. Since we are dealing with inhomogeneous systems, it turns out beneficial to decompose the magnetization of the entire sample into those of the Co and Cu regions.\nBoth purity and entropy follow quite accurately the magnetization change in the Co region (which is actually demagnetized; Fig. 3a). The laser pulse causes photoinduced spin polarization [34, 35] and affects the coher-\n4\nences in the density matrix. Moreover, spin-orbit coupling leads to spin mixing and, thus, contributes to demagnetization. Both effects increase the mixing in the density matrix.\nWhile the magnetization change builds up quickly in both regions, that in the Co region stays almost constant and that in the Cu region drops rather quickly (Cu becomes magnetized), as is seen in the inset in panel a. As has been illustrated in Refs. 21 and 36, the interface acts as a \u2018source\u2019 of spin-polarized currents in the sample. More precisely, the magnetization change in the Cu region is initiated at the interface by a backflow mechanism [36, 37]; it then spreads out into the Cu region via a spin-polarized current with rapidly decreasing magnitude. As a result, the Cu magnetization exhibits a peak at t \u2248 15 fs, i. e. slightly after the laser pulse. The interface also affects the demagnetization in the Co region [21]. In addition demagnetization happens at all Co\nsites, as in a bulk sample. The combination of Cu and Co profile results in the \u2018retarded\u2019 profile of the total magnetization.\nAnother observable is the number of electrons excited by the laser pulse,\nNexc(t) \u2261 \u2211 i (pii(t)\u2212 pii(t0)) \u0398( i \u2212 \u00b5). (11)\nThe Heaviside function \u0398 selects electronic states with energies i larger than the chemical potential \u00b5. To extract the number of laser-excited electrons, the number of thermally excited electrons is subtracted (pii(t0) accounts for the thermally excited electrons described by \u03c1\u0302(t0)). The number of excited electrons is accessible by time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy [14, 15], for the number of photoelectrons resembles Nexc(t). Hence, the QI measures may be contrasted with experimental outcomes.\nThe distance measures follow closely Nexc(t) (Fig. 3b). All three profiles are modulated by the laser pulse and are\n5 Parameter Variation Temperature 10 K,300K, 600 K Light polarization s-polarized, p-polarized Photon energy 0.775 eV,1.55 eV Sample composition Co/Cu 40/0, 30/10, 20/20, 10/30, 0/40\nTable I.

However, F (t) and Nexc(t) increase more sharply than T(t) at t < 0 fs. Comparing qualitatively the chronological sequences of panel a with those in panel b it is evident that purity and entropy do not resemble Nexc(t). This finding suggests that \u2014 since only diagonal elements pii(t) enter Nexc(t) \u2014 the distance measures appear largely sensitive to changes of the occupation probabilities, that is to photo-induced excitations and deexcitations. On the contrary, mixture measures reflect magnetization changes."

Contrary to temperature, light polarization has a pronounced effect on the fidelity (Fig. 4b). The minimum for s-polarized light is less deep than for p-polarized light (0.96 at t = 0 fs compared to 0.99 at t = \u221250 fs). The dipole selection rules tell which orbitals are involved in the optical transitions. Within the presented geometry, p-polarized light perturbs the system more efficiently\n6 than s-polarized light, which suggests to utilize light polarization as means to tailor ultrafast demagnetization and transport phenomena.\nThe photon energy shows a minute effect on the fidelity (Fig. 4c), although the photon energy ~\u03c9 = 0.775 eV is only half as large as that of the reference system. This finding is in line with the electronic structures of Co and Cu. The d bands of Co cover energies from about \u22124 eV up to about +1.5 eV, and the sp-band \u2018cuts\u2019 through this range. p \u2194 d transitions are thus accessible for both selected photon energies. The same holds for d \u2192 p transitions in Cu. This result is in agreement with experimental outcomes for Fe and Fe/Pt multilayers, which show only minor variations with a change of the excitation wavelength [8, 9].\nFor investigating the effect of sample composition on the fidelity, the total number of sites is fixed (here: 40). The largest change is found for pure Co, the smallest for pure Cu (Fig. 4d): the more Co in the system, the larger the change. Cu has a large density of occupied d states and a small density of sp states above the chemical potential, as compared to Co. Hence, optical excitations are less likely in Cu, which is reflected in the smaller decrease of fidelity.\nTo wrap up, distance measures are mostly sensitive to light polarization and sample composition, rather than to temperature and photon energy."

Consequently, a lower temperature yields marginally less mixing than a higher temperature (Fig. 5a), as is best seen at times \u2018before the laser pulse\u2019.\nAs for the fidelity (Fig. 4b), the light polarization variation changes strongly the purity (Fig. 5b).

Moreover, the photon energy shows no visible effect in both measures (cf. panel c).\nThe sample composition in panel d yields two effects on the purity. First, increasing the Cu content increases the number of electrons in the system, which reduces the occupation probabilities of the thermally occupied states. As a result, the purity decreases with increased Cu content. Second, the laser pulse increases the mixing stronger in a pure Co sample than in pure Cu sample, as is evident from the drop of each profile during and after the laser pulse.\nThe mixing measures are significantly sensitive to light polarization and sample composition, but not to photon energy and temperature \u2013 as is found also for the distance measures.

In Fig. 7 we show analogous calculations for the number of laser-excited electrons Nexc(t). We restrict ourselves to discussing the dependencies on light polarization and sample composition, both of which produce pronounced effects in these observables. Variations of temperature and photon energy bring forth minute effects and are depicted in Fig. SM4 in the Supplemental Material [31].\nFor s-polarized light, the demagnetization as well as the number of photo-excited electrons are considerably less than for p-polarized light (Figs. 6a and 7a) \u2014 as already found for the measures.\nThe importance of an interface becomes evident when considering the sample composition (Fig. 6b). While for small Cu content a minor photo-induced spin polarization produces a minute modulation at t \u2248 20 fs (cf. Fig. SM3h in the Supplemental Material [31]) and a small demagnetization for pure Co (green in Fig. 6b, Co/Cu = 40/0), the demagnetization is largest for the system with Co/Cu = 10/30 (blue graph, drop around t = 0 fs). This finding has been attributed to the imbalance of occupation at the Co/Cu interface (see Ref. 21 for details) which facilitates demagnetization and spin transfer from Cu into Co states, thereby triggering spin currents. This interface-driven effect becomes relatively weaker, the larger the Co content in the sample. It is not revealed in the measures, which implies that QI measures cannot fully replace observables, but complement theoretical analyses based on the latter.\nThe amount of Cu in the sample strongly affects the number of laser-excited electrons, as well (cf. Fig. 7b). After the laser pulse, most electrons are in an excited state in a pure Co sample (green graph). With increasing Cu content the amount of excited electrons is decreasing since optical excitations in Cu are less likely as explained in III B 1. for the fidelity."

Although sensitive in particular to the light polarization of a laser pulse and to sample composition, the subtle differences of the four measures discussed here suggest to utilize at least one distance measure and one mixture measure to characterize the degrees of perturbation and coherence of the quantum state under the influence of a laser pulse. We would like to stress that the minute extra effort in computing the QI measures during a simulation is worth the extra insight gained. Moreover, we hope that our findings encourage colleagues to utilize QI measures in theoretical spin dynamics investigations.\nConcerning future applications we think it worth to compare THz with laser excitations (i. e. excitations close to the chemical potential versus excitations within a significantly broader energy range), linearly versus circularly polarized light, and sample composition (e. g., re-\n8 placing Co/Cu by Fe/Al)."

The laser\u2019s photon energy of 1.55 eV is equivalent to a frequency of f = 0.374 fs\u22121, resulting in a single peak in the FFT spectrum (blue in Fig. 8; the broadening is caused by the Gaussian envelope). In contrast, both measures do not exhibit a maximum at that frequency but at the doubled and quadrupled values of f \u2248 0.75 fs\u22121 and \u2248 1.50 fs\u22121 (cf. vertical black lines). Purity \u03b3(t) and von Neumann entropy S(t) exhibit modulations at about 0.75 fs\u22121 that are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of fidelity and trace distance, and thus not resolved in this Figure.\nAppendix B: Comparing systems\n1. Trace distance and von Neumann entropy\nThe investigation of the measures revealed that fidelity F (t) and trace distance T(t) show qualitatively similar behaviour (cf. Figs. 2 and 3 in the main text). The same holds for the two mixture measures purity \u03b3(t) and von Neumann entropy S(t). To illustrate this in more detail, Figure 9 displays the trace distance T(t) [left column, panels (a)\u2013(d)] and the von Neumann entropy S(t) [right column, panels (e)\u2013(h)] for the various systems discussed in Section III.B of the main text. The variations of temperature and photon energy lead to minimal changes, whereas those for light polarization and sample composition have a strong effect, which is in agreement with our findings for fidelity and purity (cf. Figs. 4 and 5 in main text).\n2. Total and Cu magnetization\nIn the main text we analyzed how variations of the setup parameters [cf. Table 1] affect the demagnetization in the Co region of the sample [cf. Fig. 6 in the main text as well as panels (a) and (c) in Fig. 11]. For the sake of completeness, Fig. 10 displays the magnetization of the respective Cu regions [left column, panels (a)\u2013(d)] and of entire samples [right column, panels (e)\u2013(h)].\n11\nAs found for the measures and the observables the variations of light polarization and sample composition have a pronounced effect on the magnetization of both the Cu region and the entire sample. The influence of temperature is again weak. However, in contrast to the demagnetization in Co, the magnetization in the Cu region is not independent of the photon energy: the setup with a photon energy of 0.775 eV, which is half as large as the one in the reference system, yields a magnetization that is approximately half as large as that of the reference system.\n12"

            "text": "As for the measures, temperature has a minute effect on both the magnetization and the number of excited electrons [cf. Fig. 11(a) and (c)]. A higher temperature yields less initial magnetization because more electronic states with dominantly minority-spin orientation are occupied. The relative change, however, is almost independent of T . We note in passing that thermal fluctuations of the local magnetic moments, i. e. a noncollinear magnetic configuration, are not considered: the configuration is collinear and the temperature enters only via the occupation probabilities. Due to the modified initial occupation less electrons are excited after the laser pulse at a higher temperature. The variation of the photon energy produces small changes in the Co magnetization and has no visible effect on the number\n13\nof laser-excited electrons [panels (b) and (d)]."
