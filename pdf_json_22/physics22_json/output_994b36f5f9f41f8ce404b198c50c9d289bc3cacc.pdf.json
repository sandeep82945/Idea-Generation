    "abstractText": "We consider a system of strongly interacting bosons in two dimensions with moat band dispersion which supports an infinitely degenerate energy minimum along a closed contour in the Brillouin zone. The system has been theoretically predicted to stabilize a chiral spin liquid (CSL) ground state. In the thermodynamic limit and vanishing densities, n\u2192 0, chemical potential, \u03bc, of the uniform CSL state was shown to scale with n as \u03bc \u223c n log n. Here we perform a Monte Carlo simulation to find the parametric window for particle density, n . k 2 0 82\u03c0 , where k0 is the linear size of the moat (the radius for a circular moat), for which the scaling \u223c n log n in the equation of state of the homogeneous CSL is preserved. We variationally show that the uniform CSL state is favorable in an interval beyond the obtained scale and present a schematic phase diagram for the system. Our results offer some density estimates for observing the low-density behavior of CSL in time-of-flight experiments with a recently Floquet-engineered moat band system of ultracold atoms in Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 213401 (2022), and for the recent experiments on emergent excitonic topological order in imbalanced electron-hole bilayers.",

These states are qualitatively different from the ordinary phases of many electrons and atoms. A characteristic property of QSLs is that they exhibit an absence of breaking of the rotational symmetry and, thus, an absence of long-range ordering. They support the fractionalization of quasiparticle excitations such as anyons, while their analytical\nPreprint submitted to Annals of Physics May 4, 2023\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n12 98\n8v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .q\nua nt\n-g as\n] 3\ndescription entails the emergence of gauge fields. On the contrary, ordered states lead to massless Goldstone modes, such as spin waves, due to continuous symmetry breaking. Broken continuous symmetries give rise to local order parameters that can describe the zero-temperature ground state of the system.\nThe concept of emerging gauge fields provided a very natural way to classify and study QSLs in general. Moreover, theoretically, the spin-liquid phase has been linked to the confinement problem in the theory of fundamental interactions. The appearance of gauge fields in describing and classifying spin-liquids of lattice systems makes these systems attractive and directly linked to lattice gauge theories. The latter theories, originating from particle physics in the context of QCD, provide motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research toward developing digital and analog quantum simulators and, ultimately, scalable universal quantum computers. In Ref. 10, two new complementary approaches to studying lattice gauge theories are discussed. First, tensor network methods are presented \u2013 a classical simulation approach \u2013 applied to studying lattice gauge theories together with some results on Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, there have been recent proposals for implementing lattice gauge theory quantum simulators in different quantum hardware, e.g., trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits. Finally, the first proof-of-principle trapped ions experimental quantum simulations of the Schwinger model are reviewed.\nQSLs, often exhibiting a topological order, feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. Ref. 9 used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe QSL states. In that experiment, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under the Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a QSL phase of the Z2 toric code type was detected using topological string operators providing direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations. These observations enable the controlled experimental exploration of topological matter and protected quantum information processing. A thorough theoretical analysis of the experiment [9] was performed in Ref. 11. Motivated by these experimental advances, Ref. 12 shows that combining Rydberg interactions and appropriate lattice geometries naturally leads to emergent Z2 gauge theories endowed with matter fields.\nRef. 13 reports the quantum simulation of a topological gauge theory by realizing a one-dimensional reduction of the Chern-Simons (CS) theory (the chiral BF theory) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). This experiment reveals the critical properties of the chiral BF theory: the formation of chiral solitons and the emergence of a self-generated electric field. The results expand the scope of quantum simulation to topological gauge theories and open a route to implementing analogous gauge theories in higher dimensions.\nAnother efficient framework for the quantum simulation and computation of gauge theories is developed in Ref. 14, which is based on quantum link models providing a resource-efficient framework for the quantum simulation and computation of gauge theories.\nRef. 15 analyzes a Higgs transition from a U(1) Dirac spin liquid to a gapless\nZ2 spin liquid. This Z2 spin liquid is relevant to the spin S = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnet. Recent numerical studies have given evidence for such a phase existing in the regime of high frustration between nearest neighbor and nextnearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions (the J1-J2 model) appearing in a parameter regime between the vanishing of Ne\u0301el order and the onset of valence bond solid ordering.\nGenerally, a quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnet can be regarded as a model of hard-core bosons hopping on a lattice. Importantly, once the frustration of quantum spins is strong enough, the lattice dispersion exhibits degeneracies. An intermediate degenerate regime is when the lattice dispersion acquires the moat shape, i.e., the degenerate energy minimum along a closed line in the Brillouin zone, see fig. 1. In this case, as in one dimension (1D), the singleparticle density of states diverges at the bottom of the band. In analogy with the 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], it suggests transforming the quantum s = 1/2 spins, or equivalently, hard-core bosons, into spinless fermions, which automatically satisfy the hard-core condition. The 1D many-body bosonic wavefunction in the Tonks-Girardeau limit when g/n \u2192 \u221e, where g is the interaction parameter and n boson density, is then nullified when bosons reside at the same spatial point. The exact solution of the model in this limit, corresponding to low densities or strong interactions, shows that the wavefunction is in fact equivalent to the absolute value of the fermionic Slater determinant in 1D, which supports bosonic statistics.\nIn 2D, such \u201dfermionization\u201d may be achieved with the help of the CS transformation. An example of such statistical transmutation in 2D is the composite boson state in the fractional quantum Hall systems. In the composite boson scenario, Landau quantization keeps the kinetic energy completely degenerate at a given filling factor, and the interactions induce emergent CS fields that attach fluxes to the fermions, leading to statistical transmutation[22, 23, 24, 25].\nThe chiral spin liquid (CSL) wavefunction within this approach can be obtained from the CS fermion representation of a 2D bosonic system. A widely accepted point of view[26, 27, 28, 29] is that an interacting spin/boson system can always be formally represented in the form of fermions coupled to a CS field. Within the flux-smearing mean-field theory, fermions in the background magnetic field (typically fully) occupy the lowest Landau level. The wavefunction of the fermion state is given in terms of a Slater determinant. The bosonic wavefunction is obtained upon the multiplication of the Slater determinant by the CS phase, representing the fermionization procedure in the first quantization. Depending on the direction of the field seen by the fermions, the overall CS terms in the ground state wavefunction either cancel out (corresponding to taking the absolute value of the Slater determinant, similarly to 1D) or give rise to a prefactor \u223c (CS term)2. The Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL state is an example of this type. In the second quantization approach, these different situations are obtained by integrating fermions out and looking at the low-energy effective theory. If the CS terms are canceled out, the gauge field dynamics is thus of Maxwell type representing a superfluid. In the second case, it is a variant of the CSL.\nThe time-reversal symmetry in a CSL is broken either explicitly at the level of the Hamiltonian[34, 35, 36, 37, 38], stabilizing a scalar chirality (like in chiral spin chains supporting the chiral phase with time-reversal symmetry breaking[39, 40, 41]) or spontaneously[42, 43, 8, 44, 6]. This is an essential aspect of this state of matter, as it can give rise to the appearance of edge states and the ability to store and transmit information in a topologically quantum computation scenario. For example, the long-distance physics of the KalmeyerLaughlin CSL state can be described by a theory of fermions coupled to the U(1) CS gauge field. After integrating out fermions, the low-energy effective action becomes abelian U(1) CS theory with K-matrix being just K = 2 (or, generally, an even integer = 2m). This theory on the torus geometry has a doubly (or 2m) degenerate ground state. The quasiparticles in the CSL are vortices that support fractionalized charge e/2 (or e/2m for K = 2m) and corresponding anyonic statistics. These excitations are equivalent to Laughlin quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect, and the vortices of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin state are mutually semions (\u03c0-flux excitations).\nIn recent work by one of us (TAS) and collaborators[42, 43, 8, 44, 6], a system of strongly interacting bosons in 2D with moat dispersion was considered. It was shown that the degeneracy of the band prevents boson condensation at low densities and/or strong interactions. Furthermore, we showed a formation of a topologically ordered CSL state spontaneously breaking the timereversal symmetry. This CSL has a bulk gap and chiral gapless bosonic edge excitations[42, 43, 8, 44]. At low densities, the CSL was shown to be homogeneous, while at higher densities, and particularly at the half-filling of the system the charge density wave (CDW) order or, alternatively, out of plane Ising order for spin-1/2 systems is shown to coexist with the CSL state lowering the overall\nn g\nCSL\nf-BEC\nBEC U(1) symmetry breaking\n*\nn\u22171 n \u2217 2 \u223c 1.64n\u22171\nNon-uniformity increasing\ng \u223c 1\nFigure 2: Phase diagram of the moat band interacting bosons. The horizontal and vertical axes are particle density n and interacting strength g, respectively. CSL is the chiral spin liquid state, with a darker color indicating a stronger non-uniformity. f-BEC is the fragmented Bose-Einstein condensation that includes a condensate in two diametrically opposite momenta, coherent combinations of macroscopically occupied states with momenta along the moat including the condensates at momenta homogeneously spread along the moat [30, 31, 32, 33]. BEC is Bose-Einstein condensate at one single momentum on the moat. The density labeled in the figure is n\u22171 = k 2 0/82\u03c0, which sets the limit for the equation of state \u00b5 \u223c n2 ln 2(n) of the uniform CSL.\nenergy of the CSL state. The equation of state corresponding to the homogeneous CSL at low densities, n \u2192 0, implies that the chemical potential scales with the density as \u00b5CSL \u223c n2 ln2 n, see a detailed calculation that considers the fluctuation of the gauge field in[44].\nThe comparison of the chemical potential of the CSL state in interacting bosonic moat band systems with that of the condensate leads to the schematic\nphase diagram depicted in fig. 2. For a regular Bogolyubov-like BEC state with a spontaneously chosen single momentum state on a moat, the equation of state implies the scaling \u00b5BEC \u223c gn, where g is the density-density interaction parameter in 2D. The loop-renormalization of the coupling under the assumption of fractionalization of BEC (f-BEC) to two or more diametrically opposite condensates on a moat implies the flow of g to the universal value[31] g \u2192 guniv \u223c n1/3 at some intermediate densities and interactions leading to the following scaling of the chemical potential \u00b5f\u2212BEC \u223c n4/3. Therefore, at sufficiently low particle densities and/or strong interactions[8, 44, 6], the CSL is energetically more favorable.\nThe realization of the moat band dispersion was also explored in the degenerate quantum gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling [45, 31, 46, 47, 48, 49] and bipartite lattices with next-nearest-neighbors hoppings[50, 43, 8, 51]. Recently, the moat band was experimentally realized in a system of ultracold atoms in a Floquet-driven optical lattice [52], opening the possibility of verifying the properties of the variational CSL ansatz experimentally. In the Floquet setup, by a periodic modulation of optical lattice depth, the initially two separate quadratic bands are adiabatically moved overlappingly and hybridize each other, forming a moat band. It is, therefore, important to know the numerical range of particle density when the \u00b5CSL \u223c n2 ln2 n scaling of the low-density CSL state is stabilized. Since the analytical calculation of \u00b5CSL is performed only at the low density and thermodynamic limit (N \u2192\u221e, N/V \u2192 0)[44].\nIn the present work, the Monte Carlo (MC) calculation is performed to benchmark the low-density result for CSL and find the interval for finite densities for which \u00b5CSL \u223c n2 ln2 n. This will help to find the CSL state in time of flight experiments for which the momentum distribution will be homogeneous with the width of the peak centered around the moat scaling with n as \u03b4k \u223c n log n. Our Monte-Carlo simulation indicates \u00b5CSL \u223c n2 ln2 n relation holds at n . k 2 0\n82\u03c0 . At higher densities, we see that the equation of state of the CSL state is changing, while the tricritical transition to the BEC and f-BEC states takes place at g \u223c 1 and densities of the order of\nk20 50\u03c0 ."

In this way, the BEC state with broken U(1) symmetry translates into a magnetically ordered state of the magnet. Here our goal is to study the phase diagram of bosons with strong repulsion, g > 1, all the way up to the hard-core limit, supporting the moat dispersion (which quite generally describes frustrated magnets on moat lattices) by performing variational Monte Carlo simulations with our accurate wave functions. In particular, we will consider the problem of a moat band populated with bosons with low density.\nThe system of bosons interacting via Dirac-\u03b4 potential and supporting a\nmoat-like dispersion is described by the Hamiltonian\nH = \u222b dr [ 1\n2M \u03a6\u2020(r)(|k| \u2212 k0)2\u03a6(r) +\ng\nM [\u03a6(r)\u2020\u03a6(r)]2\n] , (1)\nwhere \u03a6(r) is the bosonic field operator, k is the momentum operator, k0 is the constant momentum representing the radius of the moat, M is the mass of the boson, and g is dimensionless interacting constant.\nThe variational ground state many-body wavefunction we consider in the present work is given by[44]\n\u03a6 (l) B (z1, z2, ..., zN ) = N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | \u03a8 (l) F (z1, z2, ..., zN ), (2)\nwhere z = x + iy is the complex variable representing the position of a boson, and \u03a8 (l) F is a Slater determinant generated by the single particle Landau wavefunctions corresponding to the fully filled Landau level. The dependence of wavefunctions on conjugate variables z\u03041, z\u03042, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , z\u0304N will be assumed but will not be explicitly written for simplicity throughout the paper. The global phase in front leads to an emergent CS field. Under the mean-field assumption of spatially uniform particle density, n, and hence constant strength of the CS field, Landau levels are given by E = 12M ( \u221a (2l + 1)M\u03c9c\u2212k0)2, where \u03c9c = B/M = 2\u03c0n/M . Therefore the energy is minimized at density\nnl = k20\n2\u03c0(2l + 1) , l \u2208 N.

(5)\nHere L (m) l (x) is the generalized Laguerre polynomial and lB = 1/ \u221a 2\u03c0nl is the magnetic length. L (m) l (x) forms a basis of Landau level degenerate subspace at the given density eq. (3). The wavefunction 2 preserves the rotational U(1) symmetry and describes the uniform CSL (uniform in the sense that it supports no out-of-plane order).\nIt is instructive to look at the l = 0 state when the trial wavefunction becomes\n\u03a6 (l=0) B (z1, z2, ..., zN ) \u221d  N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | detV ({zj}) exp \u2212\u2211 j |zj |2 4l2B  =\n N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | 2 N\u220f i<j |zi \u2212 zj | exp \u2212\u2211 j |zj |2 4l2B . (6)\nHere V ({zj}) is the Vandermonde matrix, the determinant of which is detV ({zj}) =\u220fN i<j(zi \u2212 zj). This should be compared with one of the possible f-BEC configurations corresponding to the situation when condensation happens on all the wavevectors along the minima of the moat band. Such a state can be described by the wavefunction written as the modulus of the lowest Landau level wavefunction[30]\n\u03a6allf\u2212BEC(z1, z2, ..., zN ) \u221d N\u220f i<j |zi \u2212 zj | exp \u2212\u2211 j |zj |2 4l2B . (7) Comparing eqs. (6) and (7), one can establish the following connection between the two:\n\u03a6 (l=0) B (z1, z2, ..., zN ) =  N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | 2 \u03a6allf\u2212BEC(z1, z2, ..., zN ). (8) From the field theoretical perspective, this state can be interpreted as arising from the CS gauge theory with a single-valued matrix, K = 2, after the matter field degrees of freedom in the CSL are integrated out.\nIn general, when N 1,\n\u03a6 (l) B (z1, z2, ..., zN ) \u221d  N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | detW ({zj}) exp \u2212\u2211 j |zj |2 4l2B  =\n N\u220f i<j zi \u2212 zj |zi \u2212 zj | 2 det W ({zj}) V ({zj}) N\u220f i<j |zi \u2212 zj | exp \u2212\u2211 j |zj |2 4l2B , (9)\nwhere the components of matrix W ({zj}) are Wim({zj}) = zmi L (m) l [ |zi|2 2l2B ] . We expect the bosonic part of the many-body state without the CS phase would lead to other types of f-BEC condensates with a finite condensate fraction on all the momenta along the moat, such as the states discussed in Refs. 32, 33."

The whole process is discussed in Appendix C.\nThe MC simulation is performed with the number of particles N = 60, l is chosen to be l = 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 32, 50, 100, which determines the density through eq. (3). In the inset of fig. 3, the averaged momentum \u3008|k|\u3009 and\naveraged squared momentum \u3008k2\u3009 are fitted with second-order polynomials. To see the low density analytical relation eq. (26), one needs to fit \u3008|k|\u3009 and \u3008|k|2\u3009 with only low density points, i.e., fitting with only points in range [0, n(max)]. Then the ratio of their fitted linear term coefficients at low densities approaches a constant asymptote of 2, as shown in the main figure of fig. 3 (the figure shows a logarithmic plot, for which the predicted ratio corresponds to the situation when the logarithm goes to 1).\nThe averaged energy shown in fig. 4 scales as \u3008E\u3009 \u223c n2 ln2 n at l > 20 with the corresponding density n < n\u22171 \u2261 k20 82\u03c0 . In the experimental setup of [52], k0 \u2248 15 2\u03c0 \u03bb has a corresponding density scale of n / 6.13\u00d710\u22123 \u03bb2 , or the filling\nfraction of about \u223c 140 . When comparing these results with the f-BEC energy 2ME k20N = 2 (2\u03c0)4/3 ( nn0 ) 4/3[31, 54] (n0 = k 2 0/2\u03c0, which is consistent with eq. (3)), the variational energy of the CSL state is lower than the f-BEC energy at l > 12, which indicates the CSL state is stable up to higher density n\u22172 \u2261 k20\n50\u03c0 for the dimensionless interaction g \u223c 1. This allows observation of the CSL state at a relative higher density in experiments, n / 1.0\u00d710 \u22122\n\u03bb2 , or about 1 25 filling fraction\nobservable in time of flight experiments. In this region, E \u223c n3. We attribute the deviation from n2 ln2(n) to the non-uniformity CSL[8, 6], where the CDW order or, alternatively, out of plane Ising order, is shown to coexist with the CSL\nstate lowering the overall energy of the CSL state. A similar scaling behavior can also emerge in a 1D Fermi gases with cubic dispersion, i.e., the edge excitation of Laughlin states[55, 56]. A low energy effective hydrodynamic description of the edge excitations indicates the E \u223c n3 can be captured by an emergent surface tension term. Note that at high particle density, tensor network calculation of the lattice CS representation also predicts nonuniform CSL[6, 57, 58, 59].\nIt is also interesting to compare the CSL energy with the BEC energy 2ME k20N\n= g\u03c0n/n0, as a result of which, the weakly interaction bosons, g (n/n0) ln\n2(n/n0), with moat-like dispersion remain Bose-Einstein condensed. The phase diagram fig. 2 is obtained based on this comparative analysis."

            "text": "We performed variational a Monte Carlo analysis of the equation of state corresponding to the CSL state of strongly interacting bosons with the moat dispersion. We found the density interval where the chemical potential scales with the density as \u00b5CSL \u223c n2 ln2(n). Numerical data shows a high precision fit up to density\nk20 82\u03c0 beyond which the scaling gradually changes. In the inter-\nmediate density region k20 82\u03c0 < n < k20\n50\u03c0 , which indicates the non-uniform CSL with surface tension low energy effective description. Combined with previous analytical and numerical results, the phase diagram fig. 2 is proposed, where the BEC phase dominates the weakly interacting region. In contrast, in the strongly interacting region, the emergent CS field leads to the CSL phase. The finite size scaling of the energy in the emergent CSL phase remains an exciting and open problem. To experimentally identify such a CSL state unambiguously, one needs a method to access the information of the collective modes in the whole system. Although some experimental techniques, such as polarized neutron scattering[60] or Raman susceptibility measurement[61], may provide indirect evidence of the time-reversal symmetry breaking and nonlocal chirality.\nFlatband lattice systems, similar to moat band, also give rise to the CSL state with emergent lattice CS field[62]. It is also shown that a fermionic flatband system with the disorder can harbor compressible non-Fermi liquid or strange metal with chaos[63, 64]. How the moat band system behaves in the presence of disorder still remains an open problem. The moat band becomes flat in the m \u2192 \u221e limit, enhancing the interaction effect. So the \u03a8F in the wavefunction eq. (2) could acquire a more complicated structure than a simple Slater determinant. Localization effects are also predicted in the disordered CSL[65]. Notably, the limit k0 \u2192 0 leads to the Bose glass as observed in [66, 67]."
