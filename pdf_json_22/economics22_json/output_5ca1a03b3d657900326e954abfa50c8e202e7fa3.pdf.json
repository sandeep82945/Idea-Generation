    "abstractText": "Ice and snow tourism has yielded considerable socioeconomic benefits, especially for the countries and regions that are rich in ice and snow resources. Boosted by the Beijing Winter Olympics, China\u2019s ice and snow tourism economy is likely to usher in a period of high-quality development. This study utilized Hailuogou Glacier Forest Park, a relatively well-developed glacier tourism area in China, as the study area. We used data on the regional GDP of Ganzi Prefecture and the comprehensive tourism revenue of Hailuogou scenic area from the period of 1990\u20132021 to quantitatively analyze the reciprocal feedback relationships between the regional economic growth of Ganzi Prefecture and the development of Hailuogou glacier tourism. The analyses were performed through the construction of a VAR model and through conducting robustness tests using the instrumental variable method. The results show that there is a long-term equilibrium cointegration relationship between regional economic growth in Ganzi Prefecture and tourism development in the Hailuogou scenic area, with each 1% increase in the former driving a corresponding growth of 2.01% in the latter. There is an asymmetric reciprocal feedback relationship between the economic growth of Ganzi Prefecture and the development of tourism in the Hailuogou scenic area. Economic growth in Ganzi Prefecture significantly contributes to the development of glacier tourism in Hailuogou over a longer period of time, with a contribution rate of 49%; meanwhile, the development of tourism in the Hailuogou scenic area has a limited effect on the quality and acceleration of economic development in Ganzi Prefecture, with a contribution rate of 16%. Based on the above results, relevant policy recommendations are proposed to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference for the high-quality development of the Hailuogou scenic area in the post-COVID-19 and post-Winter",

            "text": "Tourism has been an industry of importance for local and regional economic growth and development for decades [1\u20134]. For most countries, tourism should be the main driving force behind regional development, accelerating recent economic activity. It has a positive impact on foreign exchange revenue growth, increasing job opportunities and generating tax revenues [5]. International and regional experiences show that tourism can induce significant positive direct and indirect impacts at the local level through the creation of production and employment, as well as increased wages and capital income [6,7]. Tourism is a significant factor in socio-economic development, as acknowledged in the United Nations World Tourism Organization\u2019s (2005) declaration, \u201cHarnessing Tourism to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\u201d As the primary, and occasionally the only, means of sustainable economic and social development, tourism plays a particularly significant\nLand 2023, 12, 24. https://doi.org/10.3390/land12010024 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/land\nLand 2023, 12, 24 2 of 17\nrole in most developing countries, least developed countries (LDCs), and tiny island states. Glacier tourism is an alpine tourism activity that combines sightseeing, experience, fitness, scientific research, popular science, and excitement, with modern glaciers and glacier relic resources as the primary attraction; it is an alpine outdoor activity that is close to nature, challenging to explore, and has the characteristics of providing fitness and physical strength development, recreation, and science education [8]. Over 100 years ago, glaciers began to be developed and utilized as tourism resources globally [9], and have played an important role in many fields, such as in tourism, sports, and economies worldwide. Globally, more than 100 glacier tourism destinations have been successfully developed and operated, with good commercial and economic benefits [8\u201310]. China has many glaciers at middle and low latitudes. The second glacier inventory shows that there are 48,571 glaciers in China, with a total area of about 5.18 \u00d7 104 km2 [11]. Although China is a country with significant glacier resources, current development is still at a preliminary stage, which is extremely inconsistent with the glacier resources available; this gap is significant compared with other countries. China\u2019s glacier resources have great potential for future development. In February 2022, China successfully hosted the 24th Winter Olympic Games and achieved the following goals: \u201cdriving 300 million people to participate in ice and snow sports\u201d; \u201cdriving income from ice and snow-related industries\u201d. The \u201cChina Snow and Ice Tourism Development Report (2020)\u201d, released in January 2020, pointed out that the number of snow and ice tourism visitors in China during the 2018\u20132019 snow and ice season reached 224 million, with a snow and ice tourism revenue of approximately CNY 386 billion. In April 2021, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the \u201c14th Five-Year Plan for Culture and Tourism Development\u201d alongside the ongoing development of The National Leisure Programme (2021\u20132035), which will promote a comprehensive paid leave system, expand holiday consumption, meet mass tourism demands, and continuously increase the potential of tourism. Against the backdrop of these national policies, we will see an increase in people\u2019s leisure time, travel demand, the number of visitors to glacier tourism destinations, and the demand for ice and snow tourism; these increases are expected to generate considerable socioeconomic benefits. With the growth of tourism in many countries and regions, the causal link between economic growth and tourism income has become increasingly important to policymakers. The literature on the relation between tourism and economic growth has been the subject of extensive research for various countries and/or regions. Through reviews of the literature, researchers have found that four basic hypotheses have been formed about the relationship between tourism development and economic growth [12]: the tourism-led economic growth hypothesis (TLGH); the economy-driven tourism growth hypothesis (EDTH); a hypothesis surrounding the two-way interaction between tourism and the economy; and a hypothesis that the relationship has no significant impact. For the TLGH, studies have shown that tourism has long played an important role in promoting economic growth due to its role in creating jobs, increasing foreign exchange earnings, generating tax revenue, stimulating consumption, and promoting regional infrastructure development [13\u201315]. As pioneers in this field of empirical research, Balaguer and Cantavella Jord\u00e1 (2002) first proposed the TLGH through cointegration techniques and causality tests [13], and later confirmed the validity of the TLGH in extensive empirical studies at national and provincial levels [16\u201319]. However, other studies have suggested the opposite, namely EDTH [20\u201322], with Eugenio Martin et al. (2008) confirming that economic growth in some developed countries has improved the quality of infrastructure and services, which in turn has contributed to tourism expansion [23]. At the same time, studies have also demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between tourism and economic growth [24,25]. Finally, there are cases where studies have found no relationship between tourism and economic growth [26,27]. Due to the considerable socioeconomic benefits of glacier tourism, glacier-tourismrelated research began internationally in the 1980s. During this period, the focus was mainly on the direct and indirect economic benefits of glacier tourism and employment from a perspective of livelihood and infrastructure development [28\u201330]. From the 1990s onward,\nLand 2023, 12, 24 3 of 17\nthere was a clear shift in the perspective of glacier tourism research, mainly from a climate change perspective [31\u201336]; this perspective focused on the effects of glacier retreats, rising snowlines, and changing precipitation patterns in alpine regions on glacier landscapes [37], as well as tourist seasons, tourist routes [38,39], and related hazards [37,39,40]. Thus, the literature in this field has focused on the economic benefits and sustainable development of the snow and ice tourism industry. Domestic glacier tourism research started late, but it is rich and diverse, and covers aspects such as the economic value of the landscape [41], glacier tourism resource development models [42], economic benefits [43,44], the impact of climate change on glacier tourism [45,46], and the sustainability of glacier tourism [43,47]. In summary, for the first, second, and third hypotheses on tourism development and economic growth, most of the literature is focused on clusters of countries and individual countries worldwide; meanwhile, related research in China focuses on the national and provincial levels, with few studies examining regional-scale glacier tourism. Research on glacier tourism has focused on the economic, employment-related, and sustainability benefits of glacier tourism in the context of climate change; there has been a growing variety of research themes, using qualitative analysis as the main research method, and with geography, climatology, and sociology as the main research perspectives. For example, studies on the economic benefits of glacier tourism have focused on the one-way impact of glacier tourism on regional economies, with few quantitative studies on the two-way impact of glacier tourism on regional economic development. Furthermore, while the positive impact of tourism on economic growth is widely acknowledged in the short term, the dynamic interaction between tourism development and economic growth is not adequately addressed in the long term; this is particularly the case in regions where tourism has been developed with specific tourism attractions, which can lead to a neglect of the economic return patterns of tourism. The question of how economies specializing in tourism can sustain long-term growth remains open and requires further research. In view of this, the study utilized Hailuogou Glacier Forest Park, a relatively welldeveloped glacier tourism area in China, as the study area; we adopted an econometric analysis method, based on data on Ganzi Prefecture\u2019s economic growth and Hailuogou\u2019s tourism revenue from 1990 to 2021, to determine whether there is a two-way reciprocal feedback relationship between the glacier tourism industry and regional economic growth and how much the two affect each other in the longer term. The findings are anticipated to serve as a foundation for enhancing the effectiveness and quality of glacier tourism development in the post-Winter Olympics and post-COVID-19 era, as well as serve as a guide for the sustainable growth of the local economy and society with tourism as the leading industry."

            "text": "3.2.1. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models\nThe introduction of vector autoregressive (VAR) models into economics in 1980 by Christopher A. Sims [49,50], a Nobel laureate in economics, has promoted the widespread use of analyses for the dynamics of economic systems. VAR models reflect the regressions of all current variables in a model on a number of lags of all variables, and do not carry any prior constraints. VAR models are used to predict interconnected timeseries systems as well as to analyze the dynamic shocks of stochastic perturbations within the system of variables; thus, the impact of various economic shocks on the formation of economic variables can be explained using VAR models [51]. Specifically, the unconstrained vector autoregressive model (VAR(p)) introduced here has the following mathematical expression:\nyt = \u03a61yt\u22121 + L + \u03a6pyt\u2212p + Hxt + \u03b5t, t = 1, . . . , T (1)\nwhere yt is a k-dimensional column vector of endogenous variables; xt is a d-dimensional column vector of exogenous variables; p is the lag order; and T is the number of samples. k \u00d7 k-dimensional matrices \u03a61, ..., \u03a6p and k \u00d7 d-dimensional matrix H are the coefficient matrices to be estimated. \u03b5t is a k-dimensional column vector of random perturbations that can be correlated contemporaneously; however, this cannot be performed with their own lagged values or with the variables on the right-hand side of the equation. Assuming that \u2211 is the covariance matrix of \u03b5t, a (k \u00d7 k)-positive definite matrix, Equation (1) can be expanded and expressed as follows:\ny1t y2t M ykt\n = \u03a61  y1t\u22121 y2t\u22121\nM ykt\u22121\n+ L + \u03a6p  y1t\u2212p y2t\u2212p\nM ykt\u2212p\n+ H \nx1t x2t M xkt\n+ \n\u03b51t \u03b52t M \u03b5kt , t = 1, . . . , T (2) Equation (2) is a VAR(p) model containing k timeseries variables, consisting of\nk equations.\n3.2.2. Overview of the VAR Model Analysis Process\nA seven-step process is required to analyze the relationship between glacier tourism development and regional economic growth using a VAR model, as follows: 1\u00a9 Smoothing tests: In classical econometrics, one important assumption when modelling timeseries data is that the data are stationary. Unsteady data series often lead to large deviations in the results of some statistical tests, and even to \u201cspurious regression\u201d problems. Therefore, in this study, the augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller unit root test (ADF) was used to test the smoothness of the data series of two variables before the VAR model was\nLand 2023, 12, 24 6 of 17\nconstructed [52]. ADF is a test which can be used to determine the smoothness of the data series of the two variables [52]. If the ADF test value is less than the critical value at some significance level, then the series is considered to have no unit root and is smooth; thus, the original hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, the original hypothesis is accepted and the series is considered to have a unit root, i.e., a non-smooth series. 2\u00a9 Cointegration test: The Engle and Granger cointegration (E-G two-step method) method was used to test the cointegration relationship between the two variables [53]. According to the cointegration theory proposed by Engle and Granger, two variables should be considered to be cointegrated, and there is a long term equilibrium relationship if some linear combination of the two variables remains in a steady state. 3\u00a9 Determination of the model order: When constructing the VAR model, the optimal lags need to be determined. In this study, the optimal lags were determined based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [54], the Schwarz criterion (SC) [55], the likelihood ratio (LR) [56], the final prediction error criterion (FPE) [57], and the Hannan\u2013Quinn criterion (HQ) [58], to determine the optimal lag order of the VAR model. 4\u00a9 Model stability test: After determining the order of the VAR model, for a VAR model with lag length, p, and k endogenous variables, the AR-characteristic polynomial has p \u00d7 k roots. A VAR model is considered stable if the modulus of the inverse of all roots of the constructed VAR model is less than 1, i.e., if the modulus of the inverse of all roots lies within the unit circle. 5\u00a9 Granger causality test: The Granger causality test is essentially a test of whether the lagged variables of a variable can be introduced into the equation of other variables; a variable is said to have Granger causality if it is affected by the lags of other variables [59,60]. In this study, based on the results of tests 1\u00a9 and 2\u00a9, we tested whether the two smooth data series variables constitute Granger causality in the presence of a cointegration relationship. 6\u00a9 Impulse response function analysis: As VAR models contain many parameters with an economic significance that is difficult to interpret, attention is usually focused on the impulse response function. If there is a cointegration relationship between two variables that constitutes at least a one-way Granger causality, then the dynamics of the system when the model is subjected to some kind of shock can be analyzed by means of an impulse response function (IRF) [50]. 7\u00a9 Variance decomposition analysis: The importance of different structural shocks is further evaluated by analyzing the contribution of each structural shock to the change in the endogenous variables through variance decomposition (VD) [50]. The impulse response function describes the impact of one unit of shock to an endogenous variable in the VAR system on other variables, which is a description of the absolute effect; meanwhile, the variance decomposition analyzes the contribution of each variable update toward the impact of the variables in the VAR system, comprising a description of the relative effect."

The ADF unit root test was performed on the residual series, \u03b5t. If the residuals are a smooth random series, it can be judged that there is a cointegration relationship between the two series of lnTR and lnGDP. The t-statistic of the unit root test for the residual series, \u03b5t (Table 1), is \u22122.6940, which is smaller than the corresponding critical values at the 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels. Therefore, the original hypothesis that there is a unit root for the residual series, \u03b5t, is rejected and the residual series, \u03b5t, is considered to be smooth; this finding indicates that there is a long-term stable equilibrium relationship between the comprehensive tourism revenue of Hailuogou scenic area and the economic growth of Ganzi Prefecture. The equation regression coefficient gives the elasticity relationship between the growth of the comprehensive tourism income of Hailuogou scenic area and the economic growth of Ganzi Prefecture. Equation 3 shows that for every 1% increase in Ganzi\u2019s regional GDP, the comprehensive tourism income of Hailuogou scenic area increases by 2.01% accordingly, and Ganzi\u2019s regional economic growth has a more significant impact on the development of Hailuogou glacier tourism.\n(3) Determination of the optimal lag order of the VAR model Table 3 shows the calculated LR, FPE, AIC, SC, and HQ values for VAR models of\norders 0\u20137. The lags marked with \u201c*\u201d are the lags filtered by the corresponding criteria. According to the principle of determining the optimal lag of the model by taking the lag corresponding to the smallest value at the same time, the optimal lag order of the VAR model is 4. Therefore, the VAR model was constructed with the optimal lag order of 4, which is denoted as VAR(4), The model is as follows:[\ndlnGDP dlnTR ] t = [ 0.015 1.356 ] + [ 0.294 0.044 \u22122.498 \u22120.281 ][ dlnGDP dlnTR ] t\u22121 + [ 0.220 0.044 \u22122.819 \u22120.468 ][ dlnGDP dlnTR ] t\u22122\n+[ 0.019 0.032 3.884 \u22120.127 ][ dlnGDP dlnTR ] t\u22123 + [ \u22120.018 0.037 \u22125.103 \u22120.253 ][ dlnGDP dlnTR ] t\u22124 + [ \u03b51t \u03b52t ] (4)\nNote: * indicates the lag order chosen for the corresponding criterion.\nThe points in the unit circle in Figure 3 indicate the mode of the inverse of the ARcharacteristic roots, and the horizontal and vertical coordinates indicate the unit values; if all these points fall within the unit circle, then the VAR(4) model is smooth. The VAR(4) model established here, with four lags of two variables, has eight characteristic roots; the mode of the inverse of each characteristic root falls within the unit circle, indicating that the constructed VAR(4) model passes the stability test; therefore, the impulse response function and variance decomposition analyses can be performed.\nLand 2023, 12, 24 9 of 17\nLand 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 18 Table 3.

This indicates that the economic growth rate of Ganzi has a positive shock effect on itself over a longer period of time. Figure 4b shows that dlnGDP is subject to a positive shock from dlnTR, which starts to rise in period 1 and reaches a maximum of 0.02 in period 2; after this, the shock effect decreases continuously to \u22120.01 in period 6, and then rises slightly in period 7 and remains relatively stable thereafter. It can be seen that dlnTR has a positive effect on dlnGDP in the first five periods, a short negative shock in periods 6\u20138, and is not statistically significant after period 9; these results indicate that the shock effect of dlnTR on dlnGDP is insignificant in the long term. Overall, in the long term, Ganzi\u2019s economic growth rate is mainly influenced by its own internal structure; meanwhile, in the short term, it is influenced by both its own internal structure and the growth rate of comprehensive tourism income from the Hailuogou scenic area, and this effect is positive.\nLand 2023, 12, 24 11 of 17\n(2) The shock to the growth rate of comprehensive tourism revenue in the Hailuogou scenic spot is shown in Figure 4c. dlnTR is shocked by dlnGDP in the first six periods, creating a \u201cW\u201d shape shock, in periods 1\u20133 of the negative shock; however, in the fourth period, the highest value of positive shock is reached at nearly 0.4; then, in the fifth period, a second negative shock peak is reached (-0.3); a positive shock can be observed in periods 7\u201311, and a plateau can be seen after period 12. It can be seen that the period of response to the growth rate shock of Hailuogou tourism revenue is relatively long. dlnTR responds quickly to a standard deviation of its own new interest shock in the current period; this reaches a value of 0.5 in period 1, followed by a short negative shock of \u22120.3 in periods 2\u20134, and then remains stable for a long time from period 5 onwards and converges to 0 (Figure 4d). This indicates that the shock effect of the combined tourism growth rate of the Hailuogou scenic area on itself is not persistent. In summary, there is an asymmetrical relationship between the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture and the growth rate of comprehensive tourism income in the Hailuogou area, as evidenced by the following: (1) The longer duration of the shock response period is caused by the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture. The length of the shock response period for the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture on itself and the growth rate of comprehensive tourism income in Hailuogou are the 10th and 12th periods, respectively; meanwhile, the length of the shock response period for the growth rate of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism income on the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture and on itself are the 7th and 5th periods, respectively. (2) The shock effect caused by the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture is much larger than that caused by the growth rate of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism income. The vertical axis shock function values in Figure 4b,c show that the maximum value of the dlnTR\u2013dlnGDP shock is about 0.02 and the maximum value of the dlnGDP\u2013dlnTR shock is about 0.4, with a difference of 20 times between the two. It can be seen that the economic growth of the Ganzi region can significantly contribute to improvements in the comprehensive tourism income of Hailuogou."

            "text": "The analyses in the previous section show that there is a significant asymmetric relationship between economic growth in the Ganzi region and tourism development in the Hailuogou scenic area; this subsection will further quantify this asymmetric relationship through a variance decomposition analysis. In terms of the results of the variance decomposition of the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture (Table 5), the impact effect of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism growth rate on the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture, which is influenced by 100% of its own fluctuation shock in period 1, starts to appear in period 2; the shock intensity of dlnTR on dlnGDP is 7.061% at the beginning of the shock, and increases to 12.795% in period 3. It is worth noting that, from period 3 onwards, the shock intensity continues to increase until it reaches 16% in period 7, and after period 7, the shock intensity remains stable at around 16%; meanwhile, the shock intensity of dlnGDP to itself remains constant at around 84% from period 7 onwards. Overall, the shock intensity of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism growth rate to the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture is weak, and the contribution of the growth rate of Hailuogou comprehensive tourism to the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture is relatively low in the long run. This is consistent with the previous conclusion that the shock effect of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism growth rate on the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture is insignificant.\nLand 2023, 12, 24 12 of 17\nIn terms of the results of the variance decomposition of the growth rate of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism income (Table 5), the dlnTR is affected by the impact of the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture in period 1, with a shock intensity of 2.226%; after period 1, the shock intensity shows a continuous strengthening trend, maintaining a steady state of about 49% after period 7, with the largest contribution occurring in period 8, with a contribution rate of 48.98%. dlnTR is affected by its own structural shock. The strength of dlnTR, as influenced by its own structural shock, gradually decreases from period 1 to period 7, until it plateaus at about 51% after period 7; this indicates that dlnGDP has a strong shock strength on dlnTR. This is consistent with the results of the previous paper, stating that the \u201ceconomic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture is the Granger cause of the growth rate of tourism revenue in Hailuogou\u201d. This means that the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture and the growth rate of Hailuogou tourism revenue can help to explain the future growth rate of tourism revenue in Hailuogou. The above results are mainly due to the fact that the regional economic growth in Ganzi Prefecture is the result of the combined effect of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Tourism is only a part of the tertiary industry; furthermore, the Hailuogou scenic area is only one of the tourist attractions in Ganzi Prefecture, and its comprehensive tourism revenue in 2021 only accounted for 6.8% of the comprehensive tourism revenue in Ganzi Prefecture. However, this does not mean that the effect of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism revenue on the regional economic development in Ganzi Prefecture will disappear in the later years. In fact, tourism and the economy have a two-way interaction that promotes a positive relationship, with socioeconomic development, the continuous improvement of people\u2019s living standards as well as the construction of roads and other infrastructure (the total mileage of roads in Sichuan Province at the end of 2020 ranks first in the country), and the gradual introduction of relevant national leisure tourism policies, the ongoing (post-Olympic era) ice and snow tourism interest provides an unprecedented opportunity for the rapid development of glacier tourism in Hailuogou."

Therefore, the original hypothesis was rejected, with the indication that there was some endogeneity problem between the variables.

We obtained the following conclusions (here, GDP indicates the level of economic growth in Ganzi; TR reflects the level of development in Hailuogou glacier tourism): (1) There is a long-term, stable equilibrium relationship between the level of regional economic growth in Ganzi Prefecture and the level of glacier tourism development in the Hailuogou scenic area. This equilibrium relationship is an elastic one, i.e., every 1% increase in Ganzi\u2019s GDP will lead to a 2.01% increase in the comprehensive tourism income of the Hailuogou scenic area; these results indicate that Ganzi\u2019s regional economic growth has a relatively significant positive impact on the development of tourism in the Hailuogou scenic area. (2) There is an asymmetrical dependency between the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture and the growth rate of the Hailuogou comprehensive tourism income: the impact of the economic growth rate of Ganzi Prefecture on itself and on the growth rate of Hailuogou comprehensive tourism lasts longer and contributes more significantly, at approximately 84% and 49%, respectively; the contribution of the growth rate of Hailuogou comprehensive tourism to itself and to the economic growth of the Ganzi Prefecture region is approximately 51% and 16%, respectively. The economic growth of the Ganzi Prefecture region can significantly contribute to the development of glacier tourism in Hailuogou; meanwhile, the development of glacier tourism in Hailuogou has a limited impact on the quality and acceleration of the economic development in Ganzi Prefecture. Based on the above conclusions, our team found, after several surveys of the Hailuogou scenic area, that post-COVID-19 pandemic tourism competition may be a greater challenge\nLand 2023, 12, 24 14 of 17\nfor the future of the Hailuogou scenic area than the inevitable factors such as climate warming and the COVID-19 pandemic. In the recent decades of China\u2019s booming tourism industry, homogenization and low level are common problems in current tourism scenic spots, particularly in Hailuogou scenic area. The specific problems are as follows: low level of development, single tourism product, and lack of experience; the high price of entrance fee and the secondary charges of the scenic area, which exceed expectations; inconvenient transportation, and the scenic area being far away from tourists\u2019 starting point, and tourists only staying in one-stop. Combining these objective problems with our model-based conclusions, the current level of tourism development in the Hailuogou scenic area is not yet a good driver of economic growth in the Ganzi Prefecture region. The primary issue facing the Hailuogou scenic area concerns the means with which to recognize problems and future trends, transform negative impacts into new growth points and new highlights through comprehensive quality improvement, improve the scientific and technological content of tourism, increase visitors\u2019 sense of experience and satisfaction, improve the taste and reputation of the scenic area, and develop a domestic super-class glacier tourist destination model, to this end, we provide the following recommendations: (1) Carry out three-dimensional planning and build a long-term development strategy for the scenic area. Specific measures are re-planning and transformation of the glacier scenic area; construction of a \u201csubtropical-Arctic\u201d ecological experience sightseeing area with a vertical vegetation spectrum; integration of the geological landscape, featuring rich glacier landscape area viewing content. (2) To shape a high-quality brand image, carry out the quality improvement project with science popularization as the primary connotation. Specific measures are to utilize the fact of glacier changes, to carry out targeted science popularization activities, to correspond exactly to the physical objects-photos interpretation, and to make science popularization interpretations clear and precise; make full use of the public image of national scientific research institutions, such as the State Key Laboratory of Cryosphere Science of the Northwest Institute of Ecological and Environmental Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and organically combine science popularization with observational studies conducted by these institutions to enhance the grade and credibility of science popularization in the scenic area. (3) Mining and integration of rich natural, scientific and educational, and \u201cred\u201d tourism resources, to create a professional mid-to-high-end \u201cglacier+\u201d study tour. (4) Break the management rule of \u201cone view, many doors\u201d, and improve the overall management level, to create a national first-class scenic spot. Specific measures are management system reform and strengthening of the professional management team. The above recommendations can be implemented to create a good reputation and high-quality tourism brand image, enhance the experience and satisfaction of tourists, so as to retain tourists, and then release more consumption potential, enhance the direct consumption power and industrial development power, strengthen the Hailuogou glacier tourism Rosto guidelines, which can enhance the development of the Hailuogou glacier tourism to Ganzi Prefecture regional economic growth spillover capacity, provide more jobs for the destination community, and create more tax revenue for the local government. With the success of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, China has fulfilled its promise of \u201cdriving 300 million people to participate in snow and ice sports\u201d; accordingly, they have driven the rapid growth of the snow and ice tourism economy. As an important part of the ice and snow tourism economy, glacier tourism will continue to see rapid development. China is rich in glacier resources, holding considerable economic potential in glacier tourism value. This study utilized Hailuogou Glacier Forest Park, a relatively well-developed glacier tourism area in China, as a case study. We quantified the reciprocal feedback relationships between Hailuogou glacier tourism development and economic growth in Ganzi Prefecture based on an econometric approach, which to some extent makes up for the shortcomings of existing qualitative studies, enriches the scientific research on the cryosphere, and, moreover, verifies the hypothesis that a two-way interaction exists between tourism and economic growth. However, as an exploratory study, there were\nLand 2023, 12, 24 15 of 17\nsome shortcomings. In the initial development of the model, the study relied on relevant economic theory to suggest that tourism will, to some extent, contribute to local economic growth; furthermore, we suggest that the increase in local income brought about by local economic growth may indirectly contribute to local tourism. For example, it may contribute by bringing about infrastructure development and thus promoting tourism; however, our investigation of this potential was limited by the availability of data on infrastructure input variables. Thus, it was not possible to add infrastructure inputs as new endogenous variables in the VAR model to determine their influence on tourism. Accordingly, we were unable to validate the following hypothesized driving mechanism: \u201ceconomic growth in Ganzi brings about the development of infrastructure, which in turn drives the level of tourism development in Hailuogou\u201d.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization and methodology, J.Y. and Y.W.; data resources and curation, X.D., Y.W., Q.H. and F.T.; analysis, J.Y., Y.W., F.T. and Q.G.; visualization, Y.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.Y.; funding acquisition, J.Y.
