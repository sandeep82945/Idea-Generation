The health status of women was comprehensively evaluated by single health variables and frailty index. A Probit model was used to measure the excess working capacity of women by region (rural/urban) and educational level, taking all women aged 45\u201349, rural women aged 45\u201349, and rural (illiterate) women in all age groups as the benchmark, respectively.\nResults: The excess capacity of all Chinese women aged 50\u201364 is 1.9 years, and that of women aged 50\u201374 is 5.1 years. The excess work capacity of women in urban and rural areas and with di erent educational levels is heterogeneous. The excess working capacity of urban women aged 50\u201364 is 6.1\u20137.8 years, and that of urban women aged 50\u201374 is 9.8\u201314.9 years. The excess working capacity of urban women aged 50\u201364 is about 6 times that of rural women. The excess work capacity of highly educated women was 3 times higher than that of illiterate women.\nConclusion: The potential work capacity of Chinese women remains to be exploited, especially for urban and highly educatedmiddle-aged and older women with better conditions of health, whose potential is more significant. A rational retirement policy for women and the progressive implementation of an equal retirement age for men and women will contribute to further advancement of gender equality and healthy aging in the workplace in China.\nKEYWORDS\ndelayed retirement, women\u2019s health, labor participation, Chinese, work capacity\n1. Introduction\nWith decreasing birth rate and increasing life expectancy, numerous countries have initiated reforms attempting to raise the normal retirement age (NRA) in response to tremendous pressure on pension funds (1). China is facing a more severe situation due to early sex ratio imbalance and population expansion. China began to implement the one-child policy in the 1980s, which was continued for nearly 30 years. The long-term one-child policy has led to a persistent low fertility rate, resulting in the formation of hundreds of millions of inverted pyramidal one-child families, which will accelerate China\u2019s labor shortage (2).\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\nCheng et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.987362\nAdditionally, according to the World Health Organization, when the aging rate exceeds 7, 14, and 21% it is called \u201can aging society\u201d, \u201can aged society,\u201d and \u201ca super-aged society,\u201d respectively. The \u201caging rate\u201d refers to the proportion of people over 65 years old in a society (3). As China\u2019s aging population continues to grow, it is expected that China will become a \u201csuper-aged society\u201d by 2035 (4). This labor shortage and aging increase will directly aggravate the pension payment crisis (5). According to statistics, the accumulated amount of China\u2019s existing pension fund will be in deficit by the middle of the 21st century without any reform program (6). This suggests that the current pension fund cannot protect the future older population completely. The future sustainability of pension funds will still require government financial support, which will strongly impact China\u2019s fiscal sustainability (7). Consequently, in the face of rapid aging and pressure on pension fund payments, raising the normal retirement age is urgent for China.\nThe retirement age in China is stipulated as 60 for men and 50 for blue-collar women (8). In 1955, the State Council of China promulgated a document raising the retirement age for white-collar women to 55. This gender-specific age policy has been in place ever since (9). The average normal retirement age in Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in 2018 was 64.2 years for men and 63.5 years for women (10). Compared with the retirement age regulations of OECD countries, China\u2019s retirement age is significantly lower, especially for women. At the same time, more than half of OECD countries have the same retirement age for men and women, and even if the remaining countries adopt the policy of different retirement age for men and women, the retirement age gap between men and women is relatively low. For example, the retirement age gap between men and women in Slovenia is only 0.3 years (11). In contrast, the gap between men and women for retirement age in China is 5 years (for men and white-collar women) or 10 years (for men and blue-collar women)\u2014significantly higher than in OECD countries. Contradictions exist between the relatively elevated life expectancy of Chinese women and the relatively early retirement age. The average life expectancy of Chinese women in 2020 was 79.43 years, while that of men was 73.64 years, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Although life expectancy cannot be regarded as an accurate indicator forecasting women\u2019s health, it still remains of some indicative significance (12). Although the Chinese government\u2019s policies regarding retirement at different ages formen and women were originally intended to protect women\u2019s rights, it is undeniable that with China\u2019s rapid development and women\u2019s increased health and education, these policies have shortened women\u2019s careers and hindered their professional development (13).\nUnder these circumstances, there is still no definite proposal for delaying retirement, even though China initiated research on the formulation and promotion of a delayed retirement policy as early as 2013, but these results are still limited to the academic community (14). Prolonging the retirement age of women may not yield the expected results, not all the older women are capable of working, especially for those burdened by physical or psychosocial health limitations. Simply prolonging the retirement age while disregarding heterogeneity among older womenmay lead to increased inequality between healthy and unhealthy individuals, further impairing the lives of older women in general (15).\nConsequently, one of the criteria for determining the delay in retirement age should be whether the older women is able to cope, and for how long, with the excess work (16).\nIt is well-known that retirement desire increases with age (17). Physical condition of middle-aged and older women tends to decline with age, thus poor physical condition is often cited to explain early retirement (18). As a consequence of the phenomenon, scholars have subsequently introduced other ideas such as economic factors and social security (19, 20). Some scholars believe the impact of health on retirement cannot be ignored even though it is more economical to keep working (21, 22). While numbers of scholars concur with the importance of health as a factor influencing retirement in middle and old age, there are still different arguments on the metrics of health. In studies related to health and retirement, self-rated health was first used as a proxy variable for health (23, 24). However, the endogenous side effects of self-assessed health cannot be avoided, such as the tendency of the unhealthy population to exaggerate their health conditions and retire early on the grounds of illness (25). Thus, objective health indicators have gradually been adopted by scholars to avoid these biases. Mortality, for example, is more serious and has a greater impact on labor force participation behavior (26). Several articles investigate the impacts of specific illnesses on retirement decisions, like chronic disease (27) and disability (28). However, fully objective health measures, although avoiding endogeneity problems, have three drawbacks. First, the dimensionality is single and answers are usually dichotomous variables that do not provide a comprehensive description of the condition (29). Second, the association between objective health status and labor supply is dependent on the individual\u2019s occupation, e.g., arthritis affects painters more than white-collar workers (30). Finally, geographical or cultural differences, e.g., the United States and the Netherlands have different criteria for disability (31). Thus, objective ratings of health are prone to measurement bias. To avoid endogeneity problems and measurement bias, Stern combined the two using objective health indicators as instrumental variables for self-rated health (32). Poterba, Venti, and Wise (PVW) combined self-rated health with objective health indicators using principal component analysis to construct a composite health index to comprehensively assess the health of older adults. This index has several important attributes, it has a strong stability over time. It strongly correlates with mortality and is a good predictor of future health events, such as the onset of cancer or diabetes (33, 34). This index has been used in excess work capacity studies in several countries (35\u201338).\nThere are two principal approaches to health-level flexible retirement age measurements. First, based on mortality, Wise estimates excess work capacity by comparing decline in mortality in the long-term group (as a proxy for health improvement) with variations in labor participation among the older population, but this does not provide a reasonable explanation for the rising trend in female employment rates over time (39). The second approach by Cutler, Meara, and Richards-Shubik (CMR) is based on comprehensive health status, which associates employment rate with health status by using the regression coefficient of the middleaged group to calculate the expected labor participation rate of the older group. The difference between the expected rate and the actual rate referred to the excess working capacity (40), the\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nCheng et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.987362\napproach has been widely adopted in countries such as Spain (38), Japan (41), and Denmark (36).\nFrom a health perspective, to what age can Chinese women delay retirement? Since China has not formally implemented a delayed retirement policy, answering this question can help promote the delayed retirement policy (13). Therefore, this paper uses the CMR health measurement model, combined with the PVW comprehensive health index, to measure women\u2019s excess work capacity based on their health level, and to a certain extent, to simulate and evaluate whether Chinese women have the health capacity to support their delayed retirement. This paper further enriches the measurement of retirement age, and provides theoretical support for the delayed retirement policy."

The CHARLS baseline survey was chosen because it contains a large number of health status measures, and it focuses on the Chinese population over the age of 45, which matches the required sample age for this study. Basic information such as health status and function, health care and insurance, and work retirement pension from the CHARLS questionnaire were involved in this study. Women aged 45\u201374 were selected as subjects, those missing critical variables were excluded. Eventually, a valid sample of 31 937 cases was obtained, including 19 524 cases in the labor participation group and 12,413 cases in the non-labor participation group. As one person may appear in multiple waves, standard errors were clustered at the individual level."

The subjective assessment is the self-assessment of health status, which is divided into five levels: very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor.\nObjective measures include the depression (CESD-10) score, limitations on activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), disabilities, psychiatric conditions, eyesight, hearing, chronic falls, fractures, smoking, and drinking. In CHARLS, depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10), ADLs are measured using a 6-item summary assessed with an ADL scale that includes eating, dressing, transferring, bathing, using the toilet, and continence, IADLs cover telephone, housework, cooking, medication, shopping, and financial management, with four different options for each measure: \u201cno difficulty, difficulty but can still do it, difficulty needing help, and unable to do it\u201d (42). In this study, having any ADL limitation was identified as an ADL disability, and IADL was classified in the same way. The second is the use of a composite health index instead of a series of health indicators, drawing primarily from Poterba, Venti, and Wise\u2019s composite health index (hereafter referred to as the PVW index) (34). This health index was constructed based on 19 questions, including self-rated health, functional limitations, hospital admissions, and other health indicators. The first principal component of the indicator set is used first and is ranked in percentile order based on principal component scores, so that the index is a percentile scale from 1 to 100, with higher scores associated with better health. The weights of the components in constructing the PVW index are shown in Appendix Table A1."

Marital status was a dummy variable, coded as 1 and 0, representing in marriage and not in marriage, respectively. Considering the differences in educational background over time, an education of junior high school and above was considered as higher education (43). Therefore, education level was divided into illiterate, elementary school, middle school, and above. Health insurance coverage was a dichotomous indicator of whether the participant reported having any type of health insurance. See Appendix Table A2 for variable definitions and codes."

Therefore, a younger group was selected in the study as reference for calculating the excess work capacity of the older group in the same health state. Women in this age group are farther away from retirement and retirement decisions tend to be independent of the pension system during this time, thus the effect of health characteristics on labor participation could be accurately assessed. However, there is a natural benchmark group in China, unlike in\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 03 frontiersin.org\nCheng et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.987362\ndeveloped countries, namely, Chinese rural women. More than 90% of the older people in rural China are primarily engaged in agricultural activities and do not require a clear retirement age as in urban employment (44). They usually do not choose to retire as long as they are physically able to continue working (13). There is a natural advantage in using this benchmark group as comparison to the younger group. Consequently, three benchmark groups are established in this paper: first, all women aged 45\u201349 years to predict the excess work capacity of all women aged 50\u201374 with rural and urban subgroups; second, rural women aged 45\u201349 to predict the capacity of urban women aged over 50 years; and third, rural women aged 50\u201354, 55\u201359, 60\u201364, 65\u201369, and 70\u201374 to predict the capacity of urban women with the same age.\nThis paper estimates the excess working capacity of older women through two steps. In the first step, a Probit model was used to estimate the relationship between health and labor participation in the benchmark group to obtain coefficients. In the second step, the coefficients obtained in the first step were combined with actual health characteristics of the post-retirement age group to predict the proportion of older workers (women aged 50\u201364 and women aged 50\u201374) working, and then to calculate their excess working capacity against the actual working proportion. In this sense, the excess work capacity defined in this paper refers to the ability to work that is determined by physical health.\nBenchmark regression models of this paper were set as follows.\nWorki= \u03b20+\u03b21Healthij+\u03b22Xik+\u03b5i (1)\nIn model 1, Worki represents individual labor participation status. Healthij(j = 1, 2. . . 8) represents individual health characteristics, including a series of health indicators like self-assessment of health, chronic diseases, and disability; Xk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) represents control variables; \u03b20 is a constant term, \u03b21 is a health coefficient, and \u03b5i is a random disturbance term.\nWorki= \u03b20+\u03b21PVWi+\u03b22Xik+\u03b5i (2)\nIn model 2, the health index was not regressed on multiple sets of health indicators but rather a percentile ranking after converting all health indicators of an individual into a PVW index, which is done to corroborate the validity of model 1. Higher index is associated with better health, which means that the health coefficient can be interpreted as the effect of a one percentage point change in the health distribution on the probability of labor participation.

To ensure the scientific precision of the study, four items were summarized based on differences in background as follows. First, it is assumed that health status has been completely included and there are no missing or omitted health variables. With increasing age and poorer health, it is easy to overestimate the additional work capacity of older women, therefore multi-dimensional health behaviors, including smoking, are included in this paper to ensure that health status is completely assessed as much as possible. Second, it is assumed that health status has an equal motivational effect on women aged 45\u201349 with women aged 50 and above. Third, it is assumed that all nonlabor participating women aged 45\u201349 are influenced by health factors to exit the labor market, and the effects of other nonhealth factors, such as institutional factors like pensions, are not considered. If present, they are prone to underestimate excess work capacity. Given that the highest legal retirement age for Chinese women is 55 (8), women in the 45\u201349 age group were selected for this study in order to avoid the influence of non-health factors as much as possible. However, it has been pointed out that early retirement is widespread in China (46), and although a sample from the younger pre-retirement group was used in this study to reduce this error, the excess work capacity obtained is likely to be underestimated due to the presence of early retirement. However, in terms of delayed retirement, this underestimation does not bring a fundamental change to the conclusions of this paper. Fourth, health and employment endogeneity issues, like the reverse effect of labor participation on health, are not considered."

The majority of health indicators were associated with labor participation. Worse health, one or more physical limits, numbers of ADL or IADL limitations equal to or above 1, multiple chronic conditions, disabilities, psychiatric conditions, and smoking were all associated with lower labor participation. However, CESD score, number of falls, and the consumption of alcohol were positively associated with labor participation, which could be due to a multiple covariance phenomenon caused by entering excessive health indicators simultaneously. To avoid such problems, health indicators were excluded in the baseline regressions of Table 3, which used the PVW index instead of a series of health indicators. Women who married, with rural residence, and with health insurance have higher labor participation, but the phenomenon worth noting is that highly educated women are associated with lower labor participation."

It may be that there are more rural women in the study, which leads to an increase of the \u201cendless labor\u201d sample, so the predicted excess working capacity is small.

The increase was 3.5\u20134.8 years for women aged 50\u201364 with middle school and above, and 8.4\u201311.2 years for women aged 50\u201374, which illustrates that older women with higher educational level tend to possess higher work potential."

            "text": "The current policy reform on delayed retirement in China has not yet been implemented, and there are few studies on excess work\ncapacity based on health perspective in China. The excess work capacity of Chinese women was estimated using a Probit model by comprehensively assessing women\u2019s health status using a variety of single health variables and PVW health coefficients. There is one study closely related by Cutler et al. who estimated the excess work capacity of the older workforce using data from 12 countries participating in the International Social Security Project (ISS), including the UK, Japan, Germany, and Italy, which conducted an international comparison (40). Unlike previous studies, this paper includes two new benchmark groups, young rural women in China and rural women in the same age group. Compared to Cutler et al. who took a single young cohort as the baseline group for their study, China, a developing country, has a special study context with urban-rural background differences and rural women with endless labor behavior (13, 47, 48). Rural women in China tend not to have a clear concept of retirement and will work if their health allows. Therefore, the use of the same age group of rural women as the benchmark group, ensures more accurate results than using a younger cohort and is less likely to have results that exaggerate the excess work capacity of older adults.\nHealth level is associated with labor force participation among older adults. Older women with better health tend to remain in the labor force, which is consistent with previous research (49, 50). The effect of health on labor participation is not only manifested in selfrated health, but objective health measures such as chronic illness, ADL and IADL are significantly associated with labor participation (27). It is important to note that Chinese rural women generally have lower health levels than urban women. Previous studies have also demonstrated that rural Chinese women are far less susceptible to retirement due to health issues than urban women (47). In other words, rural women are more likely to continue working as long as their health allows until their health deteriorates (15). This phenomenon is common in China, but this idea often leads rural women with health problems to remain in the labor market and thus experience health deterioration, exacerbating urban-rural health inequalities (51). Given the gap between rural and urban areas, the government should provide appropriate assistance to\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org\nCheng et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.987362\nmiddle-aged and older women who continue to work in agriculture due to economic factors and improve social welfare policies for middle-aged and older rural women to narrow the health gap between urban and rural women. The retirement age should also be set to maintain proper consideration of women\u2019s health levels and implement a flexible retirement policy (52).\nThe results of this study also suggest there is an urban-rural heterogeneity in the excess work capacity of older women. Urban women have significantly higher excess capacity to work than rural women, but urban women with better health have much lower actual labor participation rates than rural women. This suggests that urban women have health levels to support delayed retirement, but it does not mean that urban women are willing to continue working after retirement or support delayed retirement policies. Many scholars have investigated women\u2019s willingness to delay retirement and found that most urban women workers oppose delaying retirement (53). It is mainly due to two reasons, one is that urban women have better social security resources, they can get access to better social security services and benefits (54). In addition, the three-child policy is currently being advocated in China (55), due to China\u2019s strong traditional intergenerational ties and the inadequacy of the current childcare system (56, 57), more and more women prefer to retire to care for their grandchildren to reduce the pressure on their children (58, 59). In the absence of social support, many women are physically and psychologically exhausted by family (60). Therefore, in the formulation of delayed retirement policies, urban-rural differences should be considered according to health status. For urban women, a corresponding retirement incentive should be established to encourage women in better health to remain in the labor market and provide certain subsidies (61), while supporting policies such as infant and childcare services should also be implemented one after another. The public welfare services for childcare to some extent can weaken the grandparenting responsibility and intensity of the older women and in turn can enable them to remain in the labor market and prolong their working life (62).\nFinally, educational heterogeneity was found in the excess\nwork capacity of older women. Excess work capacity increases\nwith education and the predicted working rate is higher for highly educated women, but the actual labor participation rate\nis lower. However, in developed countries such as Denmark,\nthe extra work capacity of highly educated women is instead lower than that of less educated women (63). This shows there\nis currently a huge labor potential for highly educated older\nwomen of China. Along with Chinese women\u2019s education levels\nsignificantly rising (43), women\u2019s initial age of entry into the\nlabor market has been delayed, while the retirement age has\nremained the same implying that women are working fewer years (64). Furthermore, women with higher education are generally in better health, especially the older people (65), thus, women with more education are more capable of delaying retirement (66). Therefore, considering the characteristics of knowledgeable women with long years of education, high starting age for employment, abundant human capital stock, and generally better health, it is possible to take the lead in implementing a delayed retirement policy in medical, scientific research, and higher education sectors where knowledgeable women are concentrated (67), so as to make\nreasonable use of human resources of highly educated female and gradually narrow the retirement age gap between males and women (52)."

            "text": "This paper also has some limitations. First, this study is based on survey data from women aged 45 and above, which, although relatively representative, is the time women start to think about retirement and is not representative of the entire female population. Secondly, it is undeniable that the estimation method in this paper relies on many assumptions. For example, the endogeneity of labor force participation and health levels are not considered. Although multiple benchmark groups and different health measures were used to ensure the robustness of the findings as much as possible, given the importance of delayed retirement reform, we argue that more predictive research on the additional work capacity of the older population is still needed. Third, the delayed retirement age policy targets full-time workers, and the labor force participation behavior in this study is examined for both full-time and part-time women, and we hope that further distinctions can be made in future studies to better promote policy improvement."

            "heading": "6. Conclusion",
            "text": "China has announced a delayed retirement system, but the specific delayed retirement policy still needs to be formulated (8). As health is an essential factor affecting the employment of the older people (22), few studies in China have been conducted to explain whether the older population has sufficient health capacity to cooperate with implementing the delayed retirement policy from a health perspective. This study finds that older women in China still have some excess working capacity and room for delayed retirement based on women\u2019s health perspective, which further enriches the measurement of retirement age and provides some theoretical support for the delayed retirement policy. As the health level of older women continues to improve, if the labor potential of older women can be further explored, it will help further mitigate the adverse effects of population aging and realize the positive aging strategy (52). However, the implications of delaying retirement age reform are broad and far-reaching. In the future, there is still a need to use more detailed information on employment and health, taking into account a variety of integrated factors including health levels. A more in-depth exploration of the gender differences that exist in the retirement ages of men and women in China is needed to facilitate large-scale delayed retirement policy reform."
