Based on the provided text, the future research direction mentioned is as follows:

"Although most existing FIM-based or graph-based methods for detecting spammer groups are generally effective, they have some limitations. Specifically, FIM-based methods are prone to misjudging genuine reviewers as spammers in the process of mining groups. Furthermore, the FIM methods are suitable for detecting tightly coupled spammer groups. For homogeneous graph-based and heterogeneous graph-based methods, the former does not take full advantage of the implicit relationships between reviewers when constructing the reviewer relationship network, while the latter ignores the step of group purification. Moreover, existing heterogeneous graph-based methods do not jointly consider the structural features of the review network and the attribute features of nodes as well as the structure-attribute correlation."
