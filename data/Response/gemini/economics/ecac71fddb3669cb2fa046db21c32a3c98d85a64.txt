1. **Investigate the impact of different subsidy and penalty mechanisms on the quality of elderly care services.** The paper proposes three different regulatory mechanisms, but it does not empirically test their effectiveness. Future research could compare the effectiveness of these mechanisms in improving the quality of elderly care services.
2. **Examine the role of the public in the supervision of elderly care services.** The paper briefly discusses the role of the public in the supervision of elderly care services, but it does not explore this role in depth. Future research could investigate the different ways in which the public can participate in the supervision of elderly care services and the impact of this participation on the quality of services.
3. **Analyze the impact of government regulation on the financial sustainability of private elderly care institutions.** The paper notes that private elderly care institutions are facing financial pressures, but it does not explore the impact of government regulation on these pressures. Future research could investigate the impact of government regulation on the financial sustainability of private elderly care institutions and identify ways to mitigate any negative impacts.
4. **Develop a model to simulate the dynamics of the elderly care service market.** The paper uses a system dynamics model to simulate the dynamics of the elderly care service market, but this model is relatively simple. Future research could develop a more complex model that incorporates more factors and interactions. This model could be used to simulate the impact of different policy interventions on the elderly care service market.
5. **Conduct a longitudinal study to track the evolution of the elderly care service market.** The paper presents a cross-sectional analysis of the elderly care service market, but it does not track the evolution of the market over time. Future research could conduct a longitudinal study to track the evolution of the market and identify the factors that are driving change.
