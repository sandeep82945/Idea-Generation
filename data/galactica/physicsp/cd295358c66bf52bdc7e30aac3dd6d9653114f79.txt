nanocellulose/alginate hydrogel composite beads for purifying mining effluents†

Biobased adsorbents and membranes offer advantages related to resource efficiency, safety, and fast
kinetics but have challenges related to their reusability and water flux. Nanocellulose/alginate
composite hydrogel beads were successfully prepared with a diameter of about 3–4 mm and porosity
as high as 99%. The beads were further modified with in situ TEMPO-mediated oxidation to
functionalize the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and facilitate the removal of cationic pollutants from
aqueous samples at low pressure, driven by electrostatic interactions. The increased number of
carboxyl groups in the bead matrix improved the removal efficiency of the adsorbent without compromising the water throughput rate; being as high as 17 000 L h−1 m−2 bar−1. The absorptivity of
the beads was evaluated with UV-vis for the removal of the dye Methylene Blue (91% removal) from
spiked water and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elemental analyses for the removal of Cd2+ from industrial mining effluents. The modified beads
showed a 3-fold increase in ion adsorption and pose as excellent candidates for the manufacturing of
three-dimensional (3-D) column filters for large-volume, high flux water treatment under atmospheric
pressure. conclusions We devised a facile method of preparing nanocellulose/alginate composite beads with increased adsorption performance derived from the in situ TEMPO oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Oxidation of the beads increased the number of carboxyl groups which can facilitate the removal of cationic impurities from aqueous samples. The enhancement of removal efficiency of the cationic dye MB and Cd2+ was conrmed with UV-vis measurements (for MB), EDS, and XPS

(for Cd2+). Interestingly, the EDS elemental analysis of the beads showed an almost 3-fold improvement in Cd2+ removal aer the in situ oxidation. Furthermore, the obtained water ux data indicates that the prepared beads can be used for the manufacturing of column lters. This approach offers lters with a higher amount of adsorbent and better water permeability than 2D membrane lters. Overall, the abundance of the component feedstock, as well as the ease and efficiency of the modication route indicate that the nanocomposite beads are promising candidates for larger production and manufacturing of column lters for water purication.
