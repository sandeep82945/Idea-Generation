Materials and Methods: We employed HPV RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to reclassify 209 cervical adenocarcinomas according to the International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Criteria and Classification (IECC). We analyzed the diagnostic value of cytology, hrHPV testing and serum CA19-9 in these tumors and their detection variance among IECC histotypes. Results: We found that the sensitivity of cytology or hrHPV test alone was 74.1% (129/174) or 72% (131/182), respectively. Non-HPV related adenocarcinoma showed a lower detection rate of cytology (60%, 27/45 vs. 79.1%, 102/129, p=0.017) or hrHPV testing (9.8%, 4/41 vs. 90.1%, 127/141, p<0.0001), compared to HPV-related adenocarcinomas. The cytology and hrHPV co-testing significantly demonstrated a higher sensitivity (151/165, 91.5%) than single test alone (p<0.001). Nevertheless, the sensitivity of co-testing was substantially lower for gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAC) (74.1%, 20/27) than that for non-GAC (94.9%, 131/138) (p=0.001). Serum CA19-9 (>40 U/mL) identified 44.1% (15/34) GACs including 75% (6/8) that were missed by co-testing, much higher than for non-GACs (10.7%, 19/177; p<0.001). The combination of cytology, hrHPV test and serum CA19-9 enhanced the detection rate of GACs (92.9%, 26/28). Conclusion: We conclude that cytology and hrHPV co-testing is not very effective for non-HPV related adenocarcinoma, particularly for GAC. As such, additional serum CA19-9 should be given in women with potential cancer risks.\nKeywords: Cervical adenocarcinoma- gastric-type- cytology- high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing-CA19-9\nproportion of adenocarcinoma increased from 13.2% to 22.1% (Castanon et al., 2016).\nCytology is less effective against cervical adenocarcinoma than squamous cell carcinoma because glandular lesions in deep locations are more likely to be missed by cytology (Castanon et al., 2016). Infection with high-risk human papilloma virus (hrHPV) is well established as the causative agent in cervical cancers (Crosbie et al., 2013). However, unlike squamous cell carcinoma, cervical adenocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors with approximately 20% cases unrelated to HPV infection (Pirog et al., 2019; Stolnicu et al., 2018). An international group of gynecological pathologists have proposed the International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Criteria and Classification (IECC), a new pathogenetic scheme based on the presence or absence of HPV infection-related morphological features (Stolnicu et al., 2018). The IECC approach appears to be"

Gastric-type adenocarcinoma (GAC), the predominant subtype of non-HPV related cervical adenocarcinoma, has demonstrated a more aggressive clinical behavior than the usual HPV-related adenocarcinoma (Nishio et al., 2019; Pirog et al., 2019). hrHPV test is apparently ineffective for the detection of GAC and other non-HPV related adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, it is a permanent requirement to find additional approach for the detection of cervical adenocarcinomas.\nSerum tumor biomarkers, such as cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), are clinically useful in the screening and diagnosis of many carcinomas including those from stomach, colorectum, pancreas and ovary (Scatena, 2015). However, the clinical significance of these biomarkers has not been well documented in cervical adenocarcinoma and its subtypes yet. In this study, we investigated the screening value of these biomarkers in combination with cytology and hrHPV co-testing for cervical adenocarcinoma, especially for GAC."

A total of 209 adenocarcinomas, accounting for 11.7% (209/1792) of all cervical carcinomas, were searched by computer (PACS system) from the archives of the Department of Surgical Pathology, Women\u2019s Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China, between January 2014 and June 2019. The clinical data, including clinical presentation, preoperative hrHPV testing, and liquidbased cytology, were retrospectively obtained from the electronic medical records before de-identification. We excluded adenosquamous carcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma from the lower uterine segment and serous carcinoma with concurrent tubo-ovarian or uterine corpus carcinomas. Tumor stage was re-assessed according to the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) cervical cancer staging system. The hrHPV test was carried out using one of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods, HC2 HR HPV DNA Test (Qiagen Gaithersburg, MD), Cervista HPV HR Test (Hologic, Bedford, MA) and Aptima HPV assay (Hologic, Bedford, MA). The cytological examination was performed with ThinPrep technique (Hologic, Bedford, MA). The results were interpreted according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology. Both hrHPV test and cytological examination were carried out within 2 months before surgery.\nTwo authors (L.B. and S.H.) reviewed the archival hematoxylin-and-eosin (HandE) slides to reclassify the adenocarcinomas according to the IECC (Stolnicu et al., 2018). To reach a consensus classification, RNA in situ\nhybridization (ISH) and immunostaining were applied with the RNAscope HPV-HR18 Probe (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA, USA) and immunostaining with a two-step Vision procedure (DAKO, Carpentaria, USA).The antibodies included p16 (G175-405; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA; 1:100), MUC6 (MRQ-20; Cell Marque, Rocklin, USA; ready-to-use), estrogen receptor (ER) (SP1; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA; 1:300) and progesterone receptor (PR) (SP2; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA; 1:500). The presence of a punctate yellow-to-brownish nuclear reaction in RNA ISH was defined as HPV RNA positive staining. Diffuse (blocking) p16 staining was considered to be positive.\nSerum tumor biomarkers including CEA, CA125, and CA19-9 were measured by electrochemiluminescence assay kits (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). The blood samples were collected from all patients before surgery and 91 patients 2-4 days post-operatively. The cut-off values used were those recommended by the manufacturers, i.e., 5 ng/mL for CEA, 35 U/mL for CA125, and 40 U/mL for CA19-9."

There were 161 patients at stage I, 18 at stage II, 26 at stage III and 4 at stage IV. The IEEC classification included 150 (71.1%) HPV-related adenocarcinomas, 48 (22.7%) non-HPV adenocarcinomas and 13 (6.2%) adenocarcinomas-no other specified (NOS). HPV-related adenocarcinomas were composed of usual type 111 (52.6%), villoglandular type 7 (3.3%), mucinous-NOS type 20 (9.5%), stratified mucinproducing type 10 (4.7%), signet-ring cell type 1 (0.5%), and mucinous intestinal type 1 (0.5%) while non-HPV related adenocarcinomas were comprised of gastric-type 34 (16.1%), endometrioid type 5 (2.4%), serous type 4 (1.9%), clear cell type 4 (1.9%), and mesonephric type 1 (0.5%). Some histological subtypes are exemplified in Figure 1A-D.

We found that the rate of cytological abnormalities was 74.1% (129/174) and that of hrHPV test was 72% (131/182). Our findings indicate that even in the setting of invasive cervical adenocarcinomas, cytology or hrHPV test alone has a high negative rate. However, cytology and hrHPV co-testing can significantly improve the sensitivity for cervical adenocarinomas (91.5%); therefore, they may represent the most efficient approach for the screening of invasive cervical adenocarcinoma to date.\nThe percentage of patients with invasive cervical adenocarcinoma showing positive Pap tests (ASCUS or worse) varies widely. The rate of positive Pap testing was 64.0% (87/136) in a retrospective study with large case series from KinMed Diagnostics (Xie et al., 2019).

The early tumor stage of the disease in the screening population may be associated with the low rate of positive cytology in the KPNC program. There are at least a certain percentage of false negative cytological tests for cervical adenocarcinoma. The possible explanations include the deep location of tumors in the endocervix, inadequate specimen and interpretation challenges limited by benign-looking morphology in minimally deviated adenocarcinomas (the well differentiated form of GAC) and diagnostic unfamiliarity with adenocarcinomas by cytopathologists. Recently, a large case-control study from regular screening project has indicated that cytological test alone is less efficient for cervical adenocarcinomas than for squamous cell carcinomas, but it can lead to a down-staging of disease by detecting adenocarcinoma earlier than diagnosis in the absence of screening (Castanon et al., 2016).\nThe role of hrHPV test in cervical carcinoma screening is increasing because of the causative link of persistent hrHPV infection to most cervical carcinomas. Primary screening with hrHPV test has been considered as an independent approach (Rijkaart et al., 2012). Recent population-based studies confirmed that hrHPV testing had a higher sensitivity, but lower specificity for the detection of cervical carcinomas and precursor lesions, compared with cytology (Katki et al., 2011; Ronco et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010). The overall hrHPV prevalence in cervical adenocarcinomas varied from 62% to 94% (Chen et al., 2018; de Sanjose et al., 2010; Holl et al. 2015; Tao et al. 2015; Xie et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2017), lower than in squamous cell carcinoma and precursor lesions (~97.5% in CIN3 or worse lesions) (Zhao et al., 2010). It becomes evident that there is a substantially high rate of negative hrHPV testing in cervical adenocarcinomas. The question on negative hrHPV tests in adenocarcinomas is whether they are true or false negativity. In this study, 8 of 14 patients with prior negative hrHPV testing showed HPV RNA positive staining in tissue slides by RNA ISH. This finding suggests the presence of false negativity to a certain degrees. The potential reasons may include some technical issues, such as the limited detection sensitivity and coverage for specific HPV types, low HPV copies in cancers, and inadequate cellularity. A possible explanation for true HPV negativity may be due to the misclassification of cases including endometrial carcinoma with endocervical involvement and metastasis to the cervix from the ovary and fallopian tube. Such cases were excluded in our study since primary endometrioid carcinoma, serous carcinoma and other rare types of the cervix, were only diagnosed when no concurrent carcinomas were found in the ovary, fallopian tube, uterus and lower uterine segment by staging surgery. In fact, cervical adenocarcinoma represents a heterogenous group with many different subtypes. The rate of hrHPV positivity was reported to vary among cervical adenocarcinoma subtypes, with a high prevalence in the usual type (~90.4%), and much lower prevalence in other subtypes (0%-34%), such as serous carcinoma, endometrial\ncarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma and gastric-type adenocarcinoma (An et al., 2005; Holl et al., 2015; Pirog et al., 2014). These subtypes were regarded as non-HPV related adenocarcinomas, accounting for 15.2% (55/361), in the new IECC classification as supported by negative RNAscope signals for HPV mRNA and non-blocking P16 staining (Stolnicu et al., 2018). Likewise, we here also find that the non-HPV related subtypes (23.7%, 50/211) showed no evidence of HPV infection in histological slides. Therefore, we believe that a substantial number of cervical adenocarcinomas are truly negative for hrHPV tests indeed.\nWe here showed the high efficiency of cytological and hrHPV co-testing in the detection of cervical adenocarcinoma. However, very limited data were available on the co-testing for cervical adenocarcinoma screening due to the relatively low incidence. A recent study from China showed consistent findings with ours (Xie et al., 2019) whereas the KPNC co-testing program suggested that cytology added little to the efficiency of HPV testing for cervical adenocarcinoma (Katki et al., 2011). Besides the relatively earlier stages in screening patients, another major factor that affects the screening efficiency of HPV testing is the wide geographic distribution of adenocarcinoma subtypes. For example, GAC, the predominant histotype of non-HPV related adenocarcioma, has a prevalence of up to 20% of cervical adenocarcinomas in Japanese, and only 10% in the IECC cohort (Stolnicu et al., 2018). Our study contained a substantial number of non-HPV related adenocarcinomas (23.9%) or GAC (16.3%) that were confirmed by histopathology, HPV E6/E7 mRNA ISH, and immunostaining with a panel of antibodies (ER, PR, P16 and P53). We did find a substantially lower detection rate of co-testing for GACs (74.1 %) than for non-GACs (94.9%). To the best of knowledge, there was no clinical analysis specifically on the diagnostic value of cytological and hrHPV co-testing in GAC to date.\nWe observed that serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA125 were not good markers for detecting cervical adenocarcinomas because of their low sensitivity. Nevertheless, we found that serum CA19-9 was relatively sensitive for GAC (44.1%) including 75% (6/8) cases that were missed by cytology and hrHPV co-testing. The combination of cytology, hrHPV test and serum CA19-9 generated a high sensitivity for GACs (92.9%) and non-GACs (97.1%). The investigation on serum CA19-9 in cervical adenocarcinoma is very limited at present. Two early studies with a small sample size showed that CA199 had a detection rate of 43.7% (7/16) in cervical adenocarcinomas (Borras et al., 1995) and 62% (13/21) in recurrent adenocarcinomas (Tabata et al., 2000). Recently, Nakamura et al. (2019) reported that 53.8% (7/13) of GACs harbored an increased CA19-9 level (>40U/mL), much higher than non-GACs (21.4%, 12/56). Our study on serum CA19-9 was comparable to previous studies. However, several critical aspects limited the clinical utility of CA19-9. First, CA19-9 is not sensitive for the detection of cervical adenocarcinoma. Second, CA19-9 is a broad tumor marker primarily for pancreatic cancer and to a lesser degree for malignancies from other"

Third, transient elevation of CA19-9 (false positivity) is occasionally found in a variety of benign entities including pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and ovarian cysts. However, considering the aggressive clinical behavior in GAC and lack of powerful biomarkers currently (Nishio et al., 2019; Pirog et al., 2019), we believe that serum CA19-9 remain an alternative for the detection of GACs particularly in women with clinical manifestations (such as vaginal discharge) and negative cytology, and monitoring the clinical course in patients with elevated CA19-9 levels.\nThe advantage of our study is the presentation of a large cohort of cervical adenocarcinomas with detailed clinicopathological features. Therefore, it may provide a relatively robust analysis of the efficacy of cytology, hrHPV test and serum CA19-9 in the detection of adenocarcinoma and its subtypes. However, this study is limited by missing values in some patients, sampling bias owing to retrospective study, and the rarity of GAC. Future multiple-institutional studies and large population-based screen programs are critically required to consolidate these findings.\nIn conclusion, we find that cytology and hrHPV co-testing is much more efficient than cytology or hrHPV test alone in the detection of cervical adenocarcinoma. However, the co-testing remains less effective for nonHPV related adenocarcinoma, particularly GAC. As such, serum CA19-9 should be given for women with suspected clinical manifestations on account of its aggressive clinical behavior."
