This study aimed to examine the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses in urban China. Methods The effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses were estimated by using fuzzy regression discontinuity based on data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. Its group heterogeneity by educational backgrounds and marital status, and underlying mechanisms were also explored. Results Retirement increased medical reimbursement expenses of outpatient significantly (P < 0.05).Low time cost and deteriorating health status after retirement were possible mechanisms in this association. Retirement increased the reimbursement expenses significantly among the older adults with more educational obtainment or being widowed/divorced. Conclusion The above findings indicated that there was a positive association between retirement and medical reimbursement expenses. The scope and proportion of medical reimbursement should be incorporated into retirement policy for improving medical service accessibility and rational healthcare utilization of retired population.",

According to national seventh census, there were 264 million people aged 60 and above, accounting for about 18.7% of the total population in China. Accompanied by the extension of life expectancy, retired population was increasing rapidly. The \u201cbaby boom\u201d from 1962 to 1975 exceeded 25 million in China, and it was expected that more than 22 million people was going to retire each year nowadays.\nRetirement occurred in the middle and later stages of life. Current Chinese retirement policy indicated that statutory retirement age was 60 for male workers, 50 for female workers, and 55 for female cadres. In China, the old-age stage often was longevous but sick, which raised the concerns about health status and healthcare utilization of retired population [5]. On the one hand, based on the intergenerational perspective, the large scale of retired population led to less income and more *Correspondence: Hualei Yang home@zuel.edu.cn 1 School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, China 2 School of Public Administration, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan 430073, China\nexpenditures due to non-payment policy of retirement group, increasing the payment pressure and affecting the structural stability of the health insurance fund. On the other hand, retirement mostly occurred in the old age when physical functions were declining. Retired population in poor health had more medical service demands, but medical reimbursement expenses were not completely consistent with medical service demands. Therefore, there was a huge gap between medical reimbursement and medical service demand for retired population in China.\nMost studies estimated the effect of retirement on the sustainability of health insurance fund from a national level [21, 22, 24], and further focused on the association between retirement on individual healthcare utilization and medical service demand, such as Zhang et\u00a0 al. [23], Wei and Zhou [19] and He et\u00a0al. [9]. However, there were few studies exploring the relationship between retirement and medical reimbursement expenses. Medical reimbursement expenses referred to the expenses paid through the medical insurance fund, and were obtained by subtracting out-of-pocket expenses from the total medical expenses, which was different from healthcare utilization focusing on the consumption of medical services by medical service consumers or patients in the medical service market. In China, there was a huge gap between medical reimbursement and healthcare utilization due to non-reimbursement policy for some diseases and medical services. The reimbursement expenses were closely associated with Medical Insurance Catalog, including drugs list, diagnosis and treatment items list, and medical service facilities list. The patients can reimburse their medical expenses according to the prescribed proportion after receiving medical services within the scope of three lists. Compared to healthcare utilization, estimating the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses better reflected the choice or propensity of retirees to use medical reimbursement services when receiving medical services, such as, using more drugs in Medical Insurance Catalog. And the transmission mechanisms behind healthcare utilization and medical reimbursement were different. Healthcare utilization was associated with medical demands, but medical reimbursement was achieved through receiving more medical services within the Medical Insurance Catalog.\nTherefore, this study aimed to estimate the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses of Chinese urban retired population based on the data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 by using fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRD) and further explored group heterogeneity under different educational\nbackgrounds and marital status, and its underlying mechanisms."

            "text": "Unlike the retirement system in many developed countries, China implements a mandatory retirement system, but there are different arrangements for different kinds of employees. As workers, males are to retire at the age of 60 and females at the age of 50, and as cadres, males can retire at the age of 60 and females at the age of 55. For employees, people who are engaged in special types of work such as high-risk work or work that is harmful to health, men can retire at 55\u00a0years old, and women can retire at 45\u00a0 years old; for employees who have work-related illnesses and are incapacitated, both men and women can retire early, at 50 and 40\u00a0years old, respectively.\nCurrent basic medical insurance system in China mainly comprises two types: Urban Employee\u2019s Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI). In the 1950s, China established a labor insurance system and a free medical care, providing basic medical services for urban workers. In 1998, the \u201cDecision of the State Council on Establishing the Basic Medical Insurance System for Urban Employees\u201d was promulgated and the UEBMI replaced the labor insurance system.1 However, at that time, the rural cooperative medical coverage rate was only 6.5%. Therefore, establishing a new rural cooperative medical system to ensure the health of rural residents became an urgent matter. Subsequently, in 2003, the \u201cOpinions on Establishing a New Rural Cooperative Medical System\u201d was issued, and a new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS) was established, which was organized, guided, and supported by the government, and funded by individuals, collectives, and the government, focusing on the major diseases treatment.2 In 2016, the basic medical insurance system for urban and rural residents was established by integrating the NCMS with the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI).3\nAt the same time, the basic medical insurance system continued to expand its coverage and improve actual reimbursement ratio. The coverage rate increased from about 15% in 2000 to nearly 95% by the end of 2010, covering a total of 1.27 billion people. The actual reimbursement ratio of UEBMI for hospitalization expenses gradually increased from 71.2% in 2007 to 82.1% in 2014.\n1 Data Source: http:// www. gov. cn/ banshi/ 2005- 08/ 04/ conte nt_ 20256. htm 2 Data Source: http:// www. gov. cn/ zhuan ti/ 2015- 06/ 13/ conte nt_ 28790 14. htm 3 Data Source: http:// www. gov. cn/ zheng ce/ conte nt/ 2016- 01/ 12/ conte nt_ 10582. htm\nThe actual reimbursement ratio of the NCMS for hospitalization expenses increased from 43% in 2010 to 56.6% in 2014. The actual reimbursement ratio of URBMI for hospitalization expenses increased from less than 50% in 2007 to 66.5% in 2014. After integrating the NCMS with the URBMI, the actual reimbursement ratio of hospitalization expenses within the basic medical insurance system for urban and rural residents was 70.0% in 2020, compared to 65.6% in 2018, an increase of 4.4% in two years [10].\nMost European and American studies supported the positive effect of retirement on healthcare utilization. Lucifora and Vigani [14] found that retirement increased the number of outpatient care and the probability of outpatient visits based on SHARE data from ten European countries. Similarly with the study by B\u00edr\u00f3 [2], retirement impelled a 3% to 10% growth of outpatient visits in Europe. More leisure time and stronger health preferences promoted medical service utilization. In addition, in terms of drug use, Puig-Junoy et\u00a0 al. [16] found that reimbursement from health insurance increased drug consumption by an average of 17.5% and total drug expenditures by 25% by using Differences-in-Differences method. Boaz and Muller [3] found that retirement increased the likelihood of physician services and the number of visits based on data from the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey (RHS) in the United States.\nThere were similar findings in the Asian studies. Dang [4] found that retirement significantly increased outpatient utilization based on data from Vietnamese towns. In Japan, Tokuda et\u00a0 al. [17] found that only the unemployed elderly aged 70 ~ 74 had a higher outpatient care rate. Kananurak [11] used a structured questionnaire to survey 400 Thai social health insurance participants and found that the poor health, the high-income\u00a0 and the retirees with chronic\u00a0 disease tended to use more healthcare measures. In China, Zhang et\u00a0 al. [23] found that retirement increased out-of-pocket expenses for self-treatment by $177 per month, and retirement had a significantly positive effect on the number of outpatient visits and hospitalizations. He et\u00a0 al. [9] also verified the positive effect of retirement on medical service utilization.\nThe transmission mechanism was possibly three channels, including low time cost, changes of socioeconomic status and deteriorating health status. First, individuals were liberated from their stressful and strenuous work after retirement, and received more medical services due to more leisure time. When working, a leave for outpatient care meant loss of income and unemployment risk, therefore, patients might delay their treatment, especially for hospitalization. After retirement, the time cost for medical services decreased. There was no worry about\nincome loss and unemployment risk [9, 23]. The second possible explanation was change of socioeconomic status. In Chinese context, the socioeconomic status after retirement decreased dramatically, especially for those who were key leadership when working. As the\u00a0Chinese saying\u00a0 goes, the house\u00a0 was crowded\u00a0 with visitors when at work, the house was deserted when at retirement. The changes of psychological feelings might be especially prominent for males, because it was often difficult for males to re-established their new social identities after retirement [18]. The third possible explanation was health status. Zou et\u00a0al. [27] found that after retirement, urban residents\u2019 tobacco consumption dropped by about 30 ~ 40%, and their alcohol consumption also showed a significant decline based on the Urban Household Survey(UHS), resulting in changes of health status."

To address this, a fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRD) approach was used to identify this association, leveraging the threshold in eligibility for retirement at the age of 60. FRD equation was as follows,\nwhere Ra is a dummy indicating if an individual is older than the age required to be eligible for retirement. Agea indicates individual\u2019s age and Age2a is the square of individual\u2019s age. Xa was control variables, including marital status, education attainment and others. a was random error. The validity test was performed to ensure the validity of results when using FRD: first, assignment variable could not be manipulated. The individual\u2019s age was randomly distributed near the breakpoint, and the age was continuous at the breakpoint.

            "text": "It was found that retirement increased reimbursement expenses of outpatient, and the result was robust through validity test, placebo test, eliminating the bias of policy change and estimation in different age ranges. Compared with previous studies focusing on healthcare utilization, the association between retirement and medical reimbursement expenses was investigated, because medical reimbursement in China was not for all diseases, and medical reimbursement expenses were not completely consistent with medical service demand. The association provided us another perspective to verify the growth of medical cost after retirement and enlightenment to optimize medical reimbursement policy.\nThe possible mechanism was low time cost and deteriorating health after retirement. On the one hand, more outpatient times and more reimbursement expenses of outpatient after retirement indicated that workers were not willing to sacrifice their working hours for healthcare utilization because of a high time cost, which was consistent with the findings of He et\u00a0 al. [9]. Low time cost after retirement motivated healthcare utilization, leading to an increase in medical reimbursement expenses of outpatient. On the other hand, retirement increased the number of chronic diseases, the risk of disability, CES-D scores and BMI index, and decreased the selfrated health status significantly. Retirement was seen as a stress or an important life event and implied a change of income and social status, resulting in some adverse health consequences [13, 20]. For example, individuals\u2019 cognitive function decreased after retirement, particularly on males [12]. Also, retirement significantly increased depression index by 0.485% and significantly decreased self-rated health status by 6% [25]. There also was the same effect in physical health, as Behncke [1] found that retirement increased the risk of chronic diseases, and Godard [8] found that the incidence of obesity was significantly higher in males after retirement. Besides, Feng et\u00a0al. [7] found that males\u2019 weight and BMI index increased because of alcohol consumption and less physical activities.\nThere were group differences in the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses of outpatient. Those with lower education had more reimbursement expenses of outpatient and medicine than those with higher education. It was possible that, first, males with low education might have less self-regulatory behaviors of health. For example, Feng et\u00a0 al. [7] found the males with low\neducation had more drinking behaviors, resulting in poor health status after retirement Secondly, the low-education group was more likely to receive unreasonable medical services and healthcare utilization [26]. And those being divorced, widowed, or never-married had more reimbursement expenses of outpatient than being married. Possible explanations were that lacking spouses\u2019 spiritual support and physical care reduced the health resources in older adults, inducing more medical demands."

The findings were as follows,\nFirst, retirement increased medical reimbursement expenses of outpatient. The result remained robust through validity test, placebo test, eliminate the bias of policy change and estimation in different age ranges.\nSecond, there were group differences in the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement by education level and marital status. Those with low education had more reimbursement expenses of outpatient than those with high education. Those being divorced, widowed, or never-married had more reimbursement expenses of outpatient than in married.\nFinally, low time cost and deteriorating health status were the transmission mechanism in the effect of retirement on medical reimbursement expenses. It was found that working hours before retirement significantly decreased the outpatient incidence and outpatient times. Meanwhile, retirement had a negative effect on health status, including number of chronic diseases, activities of daily living, CES-D scores and BMI and self-rated health status.\nThe results of this study indicate that first, though delayed retirement policy reduces payment pressure by expanding contribution group and extending contribution years, but in the long run, the aging trend is irreversible, and the retired population will increase rapidly. It is difficult to achieve long-term effects by delaying the retirement age alone. Therefore, paying attention to health change before and after retirement, and taking measures to reduce health damage caused by retirement are advocated. Second, non-payment health insurance policy induces excessive utilization of medical services. It is important to make an adjustment to overcome unreasonable utilization. Finally, more healthcare utilization is not associated with actual health promotion. Health investment and healthy lifestyle are key factors in realizing old-age health.\nAbbreviations CHARLS China health and retirement longitudinal study RD Regression discontinuity FRD Fuzzy regression discontinuity LATE Local average treatment effect\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13561- 023- 00434-x.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplement.
