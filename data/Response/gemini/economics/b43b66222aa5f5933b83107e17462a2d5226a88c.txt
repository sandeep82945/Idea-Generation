1. **Investigate the existence and computation of EF1 and PO allocations for chores with more general valuation functions.** The paper considers additive valuations, but it would be interesting to explore whether similar results hold for other valuation functions, such as lexicographic or bivalued valuations.
2. **Develop algorithms for computing DEF-k allocations that are more efficient than the RoundRobin algorithm.** The RoundRobin algorithm is simple and easy to implement, but it is not very efficient. It would be valuable to develop algorithms that can compute DEF-k allocations more quickly, especially for large instances.
3. **Explore the relationship between DEF-k and other fairness notions for chores.** The paper introduces the DEF-k fairness notion, but it does not explore its relationship to other fairness notions for chores, such as EF1 or PO. It would be interesting to investigate how these different fairness notions compare to each other, and to identify the conditions under which they are equivalent.
4. **Apply the DEF-k fairness notion to other resource allocation problems.** The DEF-k fairness notion could be applied to other resource allocation problems, such as the allocation of indivisible goods or the allocation of tasks in a multi-agent system. It would be interesting to explore how the DEF-k fairness notion performs in these other contexts, and to identify the challenges and opportunities that arise.
5. **Investigate the use of dubious chores to achieve fairness in other settings.** The paper considers the use of dubious chores to achieve fairness in the allocation of chores. It would be interesting to explore whether dubious chores could be used to achieve fairness in other settings, such as the allocation of goods or the allocation of tasks in a multi-agent system.
