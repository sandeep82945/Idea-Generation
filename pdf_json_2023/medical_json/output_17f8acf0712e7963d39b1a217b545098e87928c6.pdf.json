How these therapies influence T-cell-mediated immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after immunization remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and myasthenia gravis (MG).\nMethods: Patients with MS (83), NMOSD (19), or MG (7) undergoing RTX (n=47) or OCR (n=62) treatment were vaccinated twice with themRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Antibodies were quantified using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescence immunoassay, targeting the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were quantified by interferon g release assays (IGRA). The responses were evaluated at two different time points (4-8 weeks and 16-20 weeks following the 2nd dose of the vaccine). Immunocompetent vaccinated individuals (n=41) were included as controls.\nResults: Almost all immunocompetent controls developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein, but only 34.09% of the patients, without a COVID-19 history and undergoing anti-CD20 treatment (via RTX or OCR), seroconverted. This antibody response was higher in patients with intervals of longer than 3 weeks between vaccinations. The duration of therapy was significantly shorter in seroconverted patients (median 24 months), than in the non-seroconverted group. There was no correlation between circulating B cells and the levels of antibodies. Even patients with a low proportion of circulating CD19+ B cells (<1%, 71 patients) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses. SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responsemeasured by released interferon g\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nwas detected in 94.39% of the patients, independently of a humoral immune response.\nConclusion: The majority of MS, MG, and NMOSD patients developed a SARSCoV-2-specific T cell response. The data suggest that vaccination can induce SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in a portion of anti-CD20 treated patients. The seroconversion rate was higher in OCR-treated patients compared to those on RTX. The response represented by levels of antibodies was better in individuals, with intervals of longer than 3 weeks between vaccinations.\nKEYWORDS\nSARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccine, SARS-CoV-2, humoral immune response, IFN gamma release assay, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder"

            "text": "Anti-CD20-based B-cell-depleting strategies are implemented in treatment schemes for different autoimmune neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and myasthenia gravis (MG) (1, 2). Unfortunately, treatment with rituximab and ocrelizumab (monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies) has been shown to be one of the risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 infection in MS, NMOSD, and MG patients (3\u20135). Considering these findings, the vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus promised reduction in the severity of COVID-19 in anti-CD20 treated patients.\nSeveral questions have been posed, regarding the effect on humoral and cellular responses to vaccination based on the effect of rituximab (RTX) and ocrelizumab (OCR) on CD20pos B-cells and T cells. A limited humoral response upon vaccination has already been demonstrated in several studies focusing on neurological patients (6\u201310). On the other hand, several studies have also shown evidence for the preserved cellular response of MS patients treated with RTX or OCR to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but there is a paucity of information about the longevity of these responses (11\u201314). Data on the cellular immune response induced by vaccination in patients with NMOSD and MG on anti-CD20 therapy are limited. Moreover, we still have some uncertainty in the interpretation of laboratory results and identification of parameters of immune responses predicting sufficient and effective protection against the severe course of COVID-19.\nNeutralizing antibodies play a role in protection against SARSCoV-2 and an orchestrated adaptive immunity can limit COVID19 severity. This implies, that the B cell immune response deficit in the patients treated with anti-CD20 drugs, results in impaired clearance of SARS-CoV-2, hence, a higher risk of severe and/or prolonged symptomatology (10, 15). The effective T cell immune response was shown to be associated with a milder COVID-19 course (15, 16). The immune response to vaccination can be affected by different factors, including different immunosuppressive treatments, age, and gender (17). B cell activation is a key factor contributing to the efficacy of the vaccine response, but there are several age-related changes in B cells,\n02\nsuch as decreased plasma cells and IgM memory cells, which may contribute to the loss of vaccine efficacy (18). This factor should be considered in evaluating the vaccination effectiveness in older patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs or their combination in the context of a neurological diagnosis.\nIn this study, we analysed a cohort of patients with MS, NMOSD and MG treated with anti-CD20 therapy, compared with healthy controls, to evaluate the impact of rituximab or ocrelizumab therapy on the efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in eliciting humoral and cellular immunity, measured by detection of specific antibodies against the spike protein and release of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) after spike protein stimulation of blood cells, respectively. Furthermore, we tried to evaluate other parameters, that might be useful for monitoring the postvaccination response of patients on anti-CD20 therapy in various age categories."

The interval between the first and second dose of the mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranged from 21 to 58 days. The dosing regimen for RTX consisted of two infusions of 1000 mg of RTX two weeks apart, followed by a single infusion of 1000 mg of RTX every 6-7 months in NMOSD and MS patients. The interval of\nfrontiersin.org\nretreatment was longer in MG patients. The OCR treatment was two 300 mg infusions, two weeks apart, followed by a single infusion of 600 mg of OCR every 6-7 months. In general, routine blood and flow cytometry measurements of particular subsets of leukocytes were included in the analysis. All adverse reactions and COVID-19 histories were recorded via the national registry ReMuS from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021.

Patients being treated for myasthenia gravis were nonsignificantly older (median 65.33 years) in comparison to other groups (medians between 43.83 to 45.67 years), but this was influenced by the relatively small MG group size. The median\nfrontiersin.org\ntime between the last anti-CD20 infusion and the first vaccine dose was 153 days (R84-338 days) in ocrelizumab-treated patients.

They had longer intervals between both doses of the vaccine (median 42 days compared to 27 days, p = 0.0021). The fourth cluster (n=27) included 25 controls and 2 MS patients sorted according to higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG (more than 270 AU/ mL) and SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g below 2895 mlU/mL. They also had longer intervals between both doses of the vaccine (median 42 vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001). Lastly, the fifth cluster consisted of 3 controls,1 MS patient, and 1 myasthenia gravis patient (0-250 mlU/mL of SARSCoV-2 IFN-g and 400-650 AU/mL SARS-CoV-2 IgG). Those patients had no adverse effects from the vaccination.\nIf we exclude subjects with a history of COVID-19 infection from this analysis we can observe the division of the first cluster into two new clusters with 50 members (41 MS, 8 NMOSD, and 1 control, Figure 5B, cluster 1a) and 28 members (12 MS, 8 NMOSD, 5 MG, and 3 controls) (Figure 5B, cluster 1b). In the first new cluster, individuals were characterized by SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g values higher than 2000 mlU/mL. These patients had more severe, adverse effects after vaccination (p = 0.0089). The new cluster 1b had a higher value of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG than the first cluster (median SARS-CoV-2 IgG 14.75 vs. 0 AU/mL, p=0.0004) and SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g below 2000 mIU/mL. The previously described second cluster (Figure 5A) with high SARSCoV-2 IFN-g production and upregulation of Treg disappeared in this analysis, because the majority of those subjects had suffered from COVID-19 previously. In summary, the first group (cluster 1a) of subjects had low levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and production of IFN-g following spike protein stimulation that was higher than 2000 mlU/mL as well as more adverse events. The second group (cluster 1b) was characterized by slightly higher levels of antibodies and production of IFN-g below 2000 mlU/mL. We have not found any other relationships between lymphocyte subpopulations and markers of humoral or cellular responses.\nFrontiers in Immunology 08"

            "text": "Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and monitoring of immune response are important parts of the management of patients with autoimmune neurological disorders. We studied the postvaccination response in patients with MS, AQP4posNMOSD, and AChRposMG undergoing anti-CD20 treatment.\nWe found that 34.09% of patients without a medical history of COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination developed positive SARSCoV-2 specific IgG. However, the levels of these antibodies were very low in most of our patients. The proportion of seroconverted patients on anti-CD20 therapy can differ between published works. This fact can also be influenced by the method of antibody assessment, the different time spans between the infusion administration and vaccination, and the type of vaccine administered. We did not confirm a link between the time period from the last infusion until the vaccination, and humoral responses. This can be due to the relatively short time frame between the last infusion administration and vaccination in our MS and NMOSD cohorts (approximately 5 months) in contrast to published works (4, 19). Sormani et al. have shown the necessary time span between the last infusion and antibody response to the vaccine is 143 days (95%CI=84-258), but the cohort consisted of patients who had also been vaccinated by the other mRNA vaccine that has a supposedly higher impact on humoral response. Disanto et al. have also shown a progressive increase in SARS-CoV-2 IgG over time since the last anti-CD20 infusion, with a noticeable boundary of more than six months (19). It is consistent with the idea that the immunological effect of anti-CD20 treatment may last longer than 6 months. A very low humoral response was detected regardless of diagnosis or age in our patients undergoing anti-CD20 treatment. Duration of the antiCD20 treatment for fewer than 2 years was positively associated with a higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG seropositive patients. Whether there is a difference based on the use of RTX or OCR on the time frame for CD19+ cell repopulation in the context of\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nvaccination response has not been satisfactorily elucidated yet, but it seems that there might be some difference. In line with the previous work, some patients exhibited antibody responses to the spike protein in the absence of detectable circulating B cells in our cohorts. This fact perhaps points to the early repopulation within the lymphoid tissue of B cells that are capable of contributing to serological responses (12). This could also explain the better humoral response in patients with a longer period between the 1st and 2nd vaccine doses. In addition, we also observed a delayed humoral response in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, but not in RTX-treated patients. Both drugs, OCR and RTX, can also target CD20posT cells, which are elevated in peripheral blood in different autoimmune disorders (20\u201322). Whether there is a distinct potential of different drugs to influence this T cell subpopulation should be addressed in future studies.\nIn many viral infections, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are key cellular subsets for the control and clearance of an acute infection. We have shown preserved or upregulated cellular responses to spike protein ex vivo in NMOSD and MS patients upon vaccination. This was not observed in MG patients, who were treated with other immunosuppressive drugs alongside RTX. The different arms of adaptive immunity can compensate for each other in protective immunity in some conditions (15). The compensation of decreased humoral response by the other arms of adaptive immunity could be an explanation for the increasing production of IFN-g in ocrelizumab-treated patients suffering from MS. This compensation was not observed in patients with NMOSD or MG. This fact can be explained by concomitant medication in MG patients. Based on previous studies focusing on vaccine immunogenicity in patients treated with corticosteroids, we can presume that their effect depends on the daily dose. A dose of corticosteroids higher than 10mg/day can affect the response (23). The risk of decreased vaccine efficacy, as measured by humoral or cellular response, increases in patients on combined immunosuppressive therapy in different autoimmune disorders (24, 25).\nFIGURE 6 Cluster analysis of longevity of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g production upon spike protein stimulation of peripheral blood cells. DBscan cluster analysis was performed on the whole studied cohort including the subjects with COVID-19 infection prior to vaccination (\u03f5=0.7, minimal points per cluster 3). There are two clusters, the first is represented by subjects with decreased levels of IFN-g production upon spike protein stimulation of peripheral blood cells (highlighted by -.- line) compared with a cohort of almost stationary levels (highlighted by - - line). Most of this cohort consisted of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the proportion of adverse effects after vaccination was higher. NMOSD = neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, MG = myasthenia gravis.\nfrontiersin.org\nThe group of MG patients was very small, therefore all results for such a group must be interpreted very carefully. NMOSD and MG patients were non-significantly older but immunosenescence must be taken with caution as well. We presume that the effect of age on the immunogenicity of vaccination was not seen due to the strong impact of anti-C20 therapy on the immune response. We also cannot exclude the role of different immune mechanisms that are related to the pathology of each disease. There is evidence that RTX has better efficacy in controlling disease activity in MG patients with autoantibodies against muscle-specific kinase compared to those who have AChR-IgG (26).\nIt seems that the longevity of specific cellular responses to spike proteins is different and can last longer in subgroups of MS or NMOSD patients in comparison to healthy controls. Whether cellular response can protect patients on anti-CD20 therapies against the severe course of COVID-19 in our observed cohorts remains unanswered, because the administration of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the majority of patients. Higher values of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g were associated with a higher prevalence of adverse effects following vaccination. Using cluster analysis, we have shown an increased proportion of regulatory T cells in the subgroup of patients who had suffered from COVID-19 prior to vaccination.\nWe did not observe any severe adverse events from vaccination in the MS, NMOSD, and MG patients in our studied cohort. The presence of mild or moderate adverse events was higher in patients with higher SARS-CoV-2 IFN-g. Our finding is in line with the previous work of Stastna et al. that risks from COVID-19 infection are more pronounced than risks of vaccination in relation to disease exacerbation (27).\nThis study has limitations related to the retrospective study design. We did not perform serological analysis prior to vaccination, and we can not exclude a previous asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a minority of the studied groups. We did not assess virus-neutralizing antibodies, but we assumed a very good correlation with antibodies to spike protein. Unfortunately, we did not characterize the IFN-g-producing peripheral T cell in detail and did not include the total IgG or IgM levels in the analysis. The boosting of humoral immunity in patients with MS, NMOSD, and MG treated with anti-CD20 therapy is questionable and certainly needs further observation at different time points. A comparison of patients who experienced COVID-19 to a group of patients who have had a 3rd dose of the vaccine will be very important. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to patients with reinfections despite vaccinations and with other concomitant immunosuppressive therapies. The prolongation of the interval between pulses of anti-CD20 therapy and when the vaccine is administered should be considered in clinically stable patients. Otherwise, the combination of primary and secondary prevention tools should be useful in preventing severe COVID-19 infection in anti-CD20 treated patients. Our data from this pilot study should be confirmed in a larger cohort of MS, MG, and NMOSD patients undergoing distinct therapies in a future study.\nFrontiers in Immunology 10"

            "text": "Our data in combination with those already published, can be instrumental in better defining the most appropriate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strategy in MS, NMOSD, and MG patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy. A longer interval between the 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccine seems to boost seroconversion. However, some humoral responses might still be visible within the first 2 years of anti-CD20 treatment independently of infusion or vaccination interval. There is a higher seroconversion rate in patients treated with ocrelizumab, when compared with the rituximab-treated group. Furthermore, concomitant immunosuppressive treatment alongside anti-CD20 agents influences cellular response.\nAssessing IFN-g production following stimulation of peripheral blood cells by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is likely the most useful marker of vaccine response in CD20-treated patients. It is worth mentioning that higher production of IFN gamma was associated with a higher rate of adverse vaccine effects in patient cohorts."
