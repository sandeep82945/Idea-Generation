IMPORTANCE The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) (age, <50 years) continues to increase globally within high-income countries. OBJECTIVE To examine and compare rates of synchronous neoplasia found in patients at colonoscopic diagnosis of early-onset CRC with rates found at diagnosis of average-onset CRC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multisite retrospective and cross-sectional study conducted at Mayo Clinic sites and in the Mayo Clinic Health System from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022, 150 randomly selected patients with early-onset CRC were identified from the electronic health record and matched with 150 patients with average-onset CRC based on sex and colonoscopic indication. Patients with known hereditary syndromes, past history of CRC, or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Colonoscopic findings (polyp size, number, site) and related histopathologic findings (adenoma, advanced adenoma, sessile serrated polyp) were analyzed in association with cancer clinicopathologic features and molecular data (mismatch repair status, KRAS, and BRAFV600E). RESULTS Among 300 patients (156 men [52%]), the median age at diagnosis was 43 years (IQR, 39-47 years) for those with early-onset CRC and 67 years (IQR, 57-76) for those with average-onset CRC. Overall, 85% of patients were symptomatic at CRC diagnosis. Cancer stage, grade, molecular features, body mass index, and family history did not differ significantly between these groups. Among patients with colon cancer, the overall prevalence of synchronous neoplasia was similar, yet advanced adenomas were 3 times more frequent in those with early-onset vs average-onset cancers (31 of 75 [41%] vs 10 of 75 [13%]; P < .001). This difference was not associated with cancer stage or primary location. Among patients with rectal cancer, nonadvanced adenomas were less frequent among the early-onset group than the average-onset group (21 of 75 [28%] vs 36 of 75 [48%]), and although the prevalence of advanced adenomas was similar (11 of 75 [15%] vs 14 of 75 [19%]), they were more commonly located in the rectum (early onset, 5 of 11 [45%] vs average onset, 1 of 14 [7%]). Patients with early-onset cancer of the colon were significantly more likely than those with earlyonset cancer of the rectum to have a synchronous advanced adenoma (31 of 75 [41%] vs 11 of 75 [15%]; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, synchronous advanced adenomas were more commonly found in patients with early-onset colon cancer compared with average-onset colon cancer, and they were distributed throughout the colon. In contrast, advanced adenomas were not increased in patients with rectal cancer and, when detected, were predominantly located in the rectum.

Findings In this cross-sectional study of 300 patients, patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, had significantly higher rates of synchronous advanced adenomas compared with patients with average-onset cancers. Meaning The finding of increased synchronous advanced adenomas among patients with early-onset colon cancer, but not rectal cancer, suggests widespread field cancerization in the former, indicating biological differences by primary tumor site. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

Among patients with early onsetrectal cancer, however, synchronous neoplasia was not increased compared with those with average-onset rectal cancer, suggesting differences in their pathobiology.
