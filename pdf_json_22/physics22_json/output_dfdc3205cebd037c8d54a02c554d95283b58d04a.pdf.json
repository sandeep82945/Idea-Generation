    "abstractText": "A universal decay law (UDL) for light cluster decay of excited nuclei is formulated by fitting the UDL half-lives to those evaluated within an excitation energy-dependent double folding model (DFM). The half-lives are evaluated within a preformed cluster model. The excitation energy dependence is introduced both in the energy of the emitted cluster and in the interaction potential through the density distributions of the interacting nuclei. The half-lives are found to decrease when the difference between the excitation energies of the parent and daughter nuclei, \u2206E\u2217 > 0, increases, with the reduction being a few orders of magnitude for higher values of \u2206E\u2217. This can be of importance for nucleosynthesis calculations of heavy elements formed in extremely hot environments, as well as in highly energetic heavy-ion collisions. The UDL for excited nuclei is used to provide an estimate of the enhancement in the cluster decay rates of thermally excited nuclei such as those produced in r-process nucleosynthesis.",

            "text": "In the investigation of heavy elements, the half-lives and their possible decay modes test the ideas developed on the nuclear structure. This has motivated the formulation of semiempirical relations that provide nuclear information that would have otherwise been difficult to obtain through a complicated microscopic framework. For alpha (\u03b1) decay, the Geiger-Nuttall law [1] proves to be one of the most versatile tools for studying half-life systematics. This was extended by Viola and Seaborg [2], incorporating a dependence on the parent proton number Z. Different expressions have been tried to generalize the Geiger-Nuttall law to cluster decay [3, 4]. The half-lives of nuclei decaying\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n09 22\n1v 1\n[ nu\ncl -t\nby the emission of a wide range of charged particles has been explained by a universal decay law (UDL) in [5]. Here we formulate a UDL to study the emission of light nuclei, namely, 14C, 20O, 23F, 24\u221226Ne, 28,30Mg, and 32,34Si from parent nuclei ranging between mass numbers of 222 to 242, i.e., from 222Ra to 242Cm. The latter phenomenon is known as cluster radioactivity or cluster decay; predicted in 1980 [6] and first observed in the emission of 14C from 223Ra [7].\nWithin a semiclassical framework, the spontaneous emission of a charged particle\n(or light nucleus) can be described as a quantum tunneling phenomenon of the particle through the Coulomb barrier. This requires the assumption of a preformed cluster of the emitted nuclei inside the parent nucleus. The half-life or the decay width are then simply expressed in terms of the penetration probability P , the assault frequency \u03bd, and the cluster preformation factor Pc as\nt1/2 = ln 2\n\u03bb0 =\nln 2\nPc \u03bd P , (1)\nwhere \u03bb0 is the decay constant related to the width as, ~\u03bb0 = \u0393. The appearance of a preformation probability Pc in (1) takes into account the non-zero probability for the existence of the preformed cluster inside the parent nucleus [8, 9] and is closely related to the internal structure of nuclei.\nThe study of nuclear properties at finite temperatures is relevant both for\napplications in astrophysics [10, 11, 12] and for models of finite nuclei and nuclear matter at high excitation energy [13, 14, 15]. On the other hand, the internal excitations of nuclei play an important role in regulating their abundance, since they increase significantly their entropy. The excitations form an important ingredient in multifragmentation studies of hot nuclei. For example, the authors in [16], working within a statistical multifragmentation model find significant temperaturedependent modifications relevant for stellar dynamics and nucleosynthesis. They perform calculations for supernova matter by assuming that the nuclei have the same internal temperature as the surrounding medium.\nThe present work as mentioned above is focused on determining the excitation\nenergy (related to nuclear temperature) dependence and thereby the ambient temperature dependence of cluster decay half-lives from the UDL and is organized as follows. We present the extension of the commonly used double folding model (DFM) to take into account the possible excitations of the parent as well as the heavy daughter nuclei. The excitation energy dependence in the DFM is introduced through temperature-dependent matter and charge density distributions of the daughter nuclei. The Q value or the energy of the emitted light cluster is also modified in order to take the excitations into account. The modified DFM is used to calculate the cluster decay half-lives within the tunneling formalism. An excitation energy-dependent universal decay law (UDL) is formulated by fitting the parameters to reproduce the excitation energy-dependent half-lives evaluated using the DFM. Finally, the excitation energydependent UDL is used to calculate the ambient temperature-dependent half-lives. The results display a reduction in half-lives (or enhanced decay rates) with increasing ambient\ntemperature, which can be of relevance at high temperatures such as those encountered in r-process nucleosynthesis producing the heavy elements."

The latter exercise is carried out by relating the excitation energy of the nucleus to a nuclear temperature and formulating a double folding model (DFM) with temperaturedependent nuclear densities. The excitation energy of the parent nucleus is incorporated through an effective Q value which reflects as a shift in the energy of the tunneling light cluster which is taken to be in its ground state.

            "text": "Cluster decay half-lives (1) in literature are usually calculated using the expression of the decay width \u0393 considering the emission of a charged particle (light nucleus, here referred to as cluster) in the transition of the parent nucleus in its ground state to the ground state of the daughter (i.e., g.s.\u2192 g.s.) [17, 18, 19]. We refer to the heavier decay product as the daughter nucleus. The light cluster is also considered to be in its ground state. To extend the cluster decay half-life calculations to excited states, the excitation energy relative to the ground state is included in both the energy of the emitted cluster and the interaction potential. Therefore, the energy of the cluster is taken as an effective Q value given by\nQeff \u2261 Q+ E\u2217p \u2212 E\u2217d = Q+ \u2206E\u2217 . (2)\nwhere E\u2217p and E \u2217 d are the excitation energies of the parent and daughter nuclei, respectively, and \u2206E\u2217 is the difference between them. Since the cluster decay is treated as a tunneling problem in which the preformed cluster tunnels the potential barrier composed of the nuclear, Coulomb, and centrifugal potentials, the definitions of these are of relevance in the construction of the excitation energy-dependent interaction potential and will hence be explained in some detail below.\nThe nuclear potential is calculated using a realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN)\ninteraction folded with the density distributions of both interacting nuclei (i.e. the heavy daughter and the light cluster which are preformed in the parent) [18, 19]. The excitation energy effects are included via the nuclear density distributions defining a nuclear temperature T of the daughter nucleus as [20]\nE\u2217d(T ) = A\n9 T 2 . (3)\nThe temperature-dependent matter density distribution of the excited daughter nucleus is given as [21, 22],\n\u03c1d (r;E \u2217 d(T )) = \u03c10(T )\n[ 1 + exp ( r \u2212R(T ) a\u0303(T ) )]\u22121 , (4)\nwhere \u03c10(T ) is obtained by normalizing the density to the mass number, \u222b \u03c1(r, T )dr = A, and R(T ) and a\u0303(T ) are given by\nR(T ) = R0 ( 1 + 0.0005T 2 ) (5)\nand\na\u0303(T ) = a\u03030 ( 1 + 0.01T 2 ) (6)\nwhere R0 = 1.07A 1/3 fm and a\u03030 = 0.54 fm. The nuclear potential is then obtained within the double-folding model [23] as\nVN (r;E \u2217 d(T )) = \u222b drcdrd \u03c1c (rc) vN (|s| = |r + rc \u2212 rd|) \u03c1d (rd;E\u2217d(T )) (7)\nwhere a popular choice of the effective NN interaction based on the M3Y-Reid-type soft core potential is used. Thus,\nvN (|s|) = 7999 exp (\u22124 |s|) 4 |s| \u2212 2134exp (\u22122.5 |s|) 2.5 |s| + J00\u03b4(s) , (8)\nwhere |s| = |r + rc \u2212 rd| is the distance between a nucleon in the daughter nucleus and a nucleon in the cluster. This consists of a short-ranged repulsion and a long-ranged attraction responsible for the direct component of the interaction. An additional zerorange contribution with J00 = \u2212276(1\u22120.005E/Ac) called the knock-on exchange term takes into account the antisymmetrization of identical nucleons in the cluster and the daughter nucleus. The latter represents a kind of nonlocality in the double folding potential [24]. Nonlocality can be included in the description of nuclear decay using other approaches too and we refer the reader to [25, 26] for further reading.\nThe excitation energy-dependent Coulomb potential is evaluated in a similar\nmanner by using the T -dependent charge density distributions as in Eqs. (4) normalized to the atomic number Z. Thus, the total potential is given by,\nV ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = \u03bb ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) VN (r;E \u2217 d) + VC (r;E \u2217 d) + ~2\n2\u00b5\n( l + 1\n2 )2 r2 . (9)\nwhere r is the separation between the center of masses of the cluster and the daughter nucleus. Note that the usual centrifugal barrier has been replaced by the Langer modified one [27] since the width is evaluated within a semiclassical approximation.\n\u03bb ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) is the strength of the nuclear interaction and is fixed by imposing the BohrSommerfeld quantization condition. This also determines the depth of the nuclear potential for different excited states of the parent and daughter nuclei as\u222b r2(E\u2217p ,E\u2217d) r1(E\u2217p ,E \u2217 d) k ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) dr = (G\u2212 l + 1)\u03c0 2 (10)\nTemperature dependence of cluster decay 5 where k ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = \u221a 2\u00b5 ~2 \u2223\u2223V (r;E\u2217p , E\u2217d)\u2212Qeff \u2223\u2223 is the wave number. The turning points depend parametrically on the excited states through the condition\nV ( ri;E \u2217 p , E \u2217 d ) = Qeff , and n is the number of nodes of the quasibound wave function of the light cluster - daughter nucleus relative motion. This is expressed as n = (G \u2212 l)/2, where G is a global quantum number and l is the relative orbital angular momentum quantum number. The global quantum number G is chosen according to the Wildermuth-Tang condition [28, 29],\nG = 2n+ l = Ac\u2211 i=1 ( g (Ac+Ad) i \u2212 g (Ac) i ) , (11)\nwhere g (Ad+Ac) i are the oscillator quantum numbers of the nucleons forming the cluster required to ensure that the cluster is completely outside the shell occupied by the daughter nucleus, and g (Ac) i are the internal quantum numbers of the nucleons in the emitted cluster. The values of gi are taken as gi = 4 for nucleons in the 50 \u2264 Z, N \u2264 82 shell, gi = 5 for nucleons in the 82 < Z, N \u2264 126 shell, gi = 6 for nucleons in the N \u2264 184, and gi = 7 for nucleons outside the N = 184 neutron shell closure. These values correspond to the 4~\u03c9, 5~\u03c9, 6~\u03c9, and 7~\u03c9 harmonic-oscillator shells, respectively. The Wildermuth-Tang condition is considered to be sufficient to account for the main effects of the Pauli principle.\nAs a consequence of the excitation energy dependence of the interaction potential,\nand the effective Q value, the decay width for a preformed cluster model within the semiclassical Jeffreys-Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin (JWKB) approximation [17, 18] becomes excitation energy-dependent and is given by\n\u0393 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = Pc ~2\n2\u00b5 [\u222b r2(E\u2217p ,E\u2217d) r1(E\u2217p ,E \u2217 d)\ndr k ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d\n)]\u22121\n\u00d7 exp [ \u22122 \u222b r2(E\u2217p ,E\u2217d) r1(E\u2217p ,E \u2217 d) k ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) dr ] . (12)\nwhere Pc is the cluster preformation probability and \u00b5 is the reduced mass of the two nuclei forming the cluster inside the parent nucleus. The exponential factor corresponds to the penetration probability and the factor in front of it is the normalization of the bound-state wave function in the region between r1 and r2, the first and second turning\npoints. The excitation energy-dependent half-life is then calculated as t1/2 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) =\n~ ln 2 /\u0393 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) ."

            "text": "The relation between the decay constant and the penetration probability, the assault frequency, and the preformation factor allows us to write a logarithmic formula for the half-life (1) which is convenient for obtaining a parameterized analytical formula for the latter. Thus, we begin by writing,\nlog (\u03bd t1/2) = \u2212 logP \u2212 logPc + constant. (13)\nIn the simplest model, one can write the first term \u2212 logP assuming a tunneling process in which the light cluster goes through the Coulomb barrier formed due to its interaction with the daughter nucleus, with the nuclear potential being a rectangular well of width R0 = Rc +Rd. The penetration probability is given by\nP = exp [ \u22122 \u222b R R0 k(r) dr ] , (14)\nwhere k (r) = \u221a\n2\u00b5 ~2 |V (r)\u2212 E| is the wavenumber inside the barrier and R is the outer\nclassical turning point calculated from VC(R) = E. Here, E is the energy of the tunneling particle and \u00b5 is the reduced mass of the cluster-daughter nucleus system. The interaction potential V (r) has contributions from both the Coulomb and centrifugal potentials, i.e.,\nV (r) = ZcZd e2\nr +\n~2 2\u00b5 l(l + 1) r2 . (15)\nThus, the wavenumber is given by k(r) = \u221a 2\u00b5E ~2 [( R r \u2212 1 ) + \u03c3 1 r2 ] , where \u03c3 =\n~2 2\u00b5E l(l+1) is a small quantity due to the centrifugal potential being very small compared with the Coulomb potential [30, 31]. With these considerations, the integral in equation (14) is calculated as\u222b R R0 k(r) dr = \u221a 2\u00b5E ~2 R [ cos\u22121 ( R0 R )1/2 \u2212 ( R0 R )1/2( 1\u2212 R0 R )1/2]\n+ \u03c3\n\u221a 2\u00b5E\n~2 1\u221a R0R\n\u221a 1\u2212 R0\nR . (16)\nThis result is in good agreement with that obtained in [5, 32] in which the\npenetrability is written in terms of Coulomb-Hankel functions. To simplify 16, we consider the potential barrier is relatively wide, i.e., R >> R0. This allows us to make the approximations cos\u22121 \u2248 \u03c0 2 \u2212 R0 R and ( 1\u2212 R0 R )1/2 \u2248 1. The integral of equation (16) is then approximated as\u222b R\nR0\nk(r) dr =\n\u221a 2\u00b5E\n~2 R\n[ \u03c0\n2 \u2212 2 ( R0 R )1/2] + \u03c3 \u221a 2\u00b5E ~2 1\u221a R0R . (17)\nReplacing (17) in (14), choosing the energy of the emitted cluster E to be\nQeff = Q + \u2206E \u2217 as in (2), and defining the turning points by E = ZcZd e 2/R and R0 = r0 ( A 1/3 c + A 1/3 d ) , the penetration probability (14) is then given as\nlogP (T ) = \u2212\u03b1 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) \u03c7\u2032 \u2212 b \u03c1\u2032 \u2212 c l(l + 1)\n\u03c1\u2032 (18)\nwhere the coefficients are \u03b1 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = ( a0 \u2212 a1 \u2206E \u2217\nQ\n) , with a0 = \u03c0e2 \u221a 2m0 ~ ln 10 and a1 = a0/2,\nb = \u22124e \u221a\n2m0r0 ~ ln 10 , and c = \u2212 2~ ln 10e \u221a 2m0r0 , and the functions \u03c7\u2032 and \u03c1\u2032 are defined as\n\u03c7\u2032 = ZcZd \u221a AcAd ApE\nand\n\u03c1\u2032 = \u221a ZcZd\nAcAd Ap\n( A 1/3 c + A 1/3 d ) .\nWe note that the first two terms of the UDL (18) are the same as in Ref. [5] for\nE\u2217p = E \u2217 d = 0 and arise from the Coulomb interaction. The third term introduces a correction associated with the angular momentum carried by the emitted cluster [33].\nThe contribution of the assault frequency to the UDL is taken to be the same\nas that in Refs. [34, 35]. The cluster is assumed to vibrate near the surface of the parent nucleus in a harmonic oscillator potential with frequency \u03c9 and reduced mass \u00b5. Using the virial theorem \u00b5\u03c92 \u3008r2\u3009 = (2nr + l + 3/2) ~\u03c9 where the (radial) number of nodes nr and angular momentum l are related to the global quantum number by G = 2nr + l, and the rms radius can be written in terms of the radius of the parent nucleus as \u3008r2\u3009 = (3/5)R2p. Assuming masses are proportional to the mass number and replacing Ri = r0A 1/3 i , the assault frequency \u03bd = \u03c9/2\u03c0 is then given as [34, 35]\n\u03bd = [( G+ 3\n2\n) A 1/3 p\nAcAd\n] \u03bd0 , (19)\nwhere \u03bd0 = ~/(1.2\u03c0m0r20) \u2248 1.4714 \u00d7 1022 s\u22121. Some authors [36, 37, 38] also include the nuclear isospin asymmetry term I = (Np \u2212 Zp)/Ap for the parent nucleus and the parity effects. Using the above inputs, we formulate the universal decay law (UDL) for the excitation energy-dependent half-life as\nlog [\u03bd0 t (UDL) 1/2 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) ] = \u03b1 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) \u03c7\u2032 + b \u03c1\u2032 + c l(l + 1)\n\u03c1\u2032\n+ d log [( G+ 3\n2\n) A 1/3 p\nAcAd\n] + e I(I + 1) + f ( 1\u2212 (\u22121)l ) , (20)\nwhere, \u03b1 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = ( a0 \u2212 a1 \u2206E \u2217\nQ\n) . Though a0, a1, b, c, d, e, and f are constants as\ndefined above, they can be considered as free parameters to be fitted in order to make up for the approximations made in deriving the UDL. An important feature emerges from the above excitation energy-dependent UDL. Since the correction introduced by the angular momentum is very small, as mentioned above, the half-life can be factorized into two terms in which one of them depends just on the half-life for the (parent) ground state to the (daughter) ground state decay and the other that is excitation-energy-dependent. Thus,\nlog [ \u03bd0 t1/2 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d )] = log [ \u03bd0 t1/2(g.s.\u2192 g.s.) ] \u2212 a1 \u03c7\u2032 \u2206E\u2217\nQ . (21)\nwhere t1/2(g.s. \u2192 g.s.) is the half-life when the emission occurs from ground state to ground state. We can therefore fit the single parameter a1 by evaluating the ratio t1/2(E \u2217 p , E \u2217 d)/t1/2(g.s. \u2192 g.s.) using the Eq. (12) for the width in the double folding\nmodel and t1/2 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = ~ ln 2 /\u0393 ( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) . Since it is the ratio which we are fitting, we do not need to specify the preformation probability Pc as long we assume that it\nremains the same for nuclei in the ground and excited states. Pc in the DFM is generally obtained phenomenologically by comparing the theoretical half-lives with experimental data. Having thus fitted the parameter a1 (to be discussed in the next section), we can now consider (21) to be the universal decay law for excited nuclei. The first term in (21) can be replaced by the experimental half-life (if available) or using a UDL such those in Refs. [37, 38, 39]. Note that the objective of this study is not to fit the universal decay law for the g.s. \u2192 g.s. decays but rather to obtain an expression which can be used for excited nuclei. Hence, it suffices for us to fit the parameter a1 and use a UDL available from literature [37, 38, 39] for the g.s. \u2192 g.s. decays."

The latter is done partly with the objective of evaluating the half-lives of thermally excited nuclei in an astrophysical environment at high temperatures, Ts, of the environment, such as those encountered in the r-process nucleosynthesis sites.

The excitation energy dependence as mentioned earlier is introduced through both the energy of the emitted cluster and the charge and matter density distribution via the half-density radius, (5), and the surface diffuseness, (6). The inclusion of excitation energy leads to a shift of the second and third turning\npoints that are solutions of V ( r;E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) = Qeff , where the total potential is obtained using the folding procedure, Eqs. (7), (4), and (9), with the strength of the nuclear potential \u03bb fixed at each combination of excitation energies of the parent and daughter nuclei by the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, (10). Even though the strength of the nuclear part gets modified when E\u2217p and E \u2217 d change, the net effect is dominated by the modification of the width of the Coulomb barrier, which leads to a change in the penetration probability. The shift in the turning points with excitation energy is not large but the penetration probability being an exponential factor is sensitive to this change and grows rapidly with decreasing width of the barrier. Therefore, the cluster\ndecay half-lives are affected by the excitation energy of the parent and daughter nuclei.\nThe excitation energy-dependent UDL is fitted with the results obtained from\nthe DFM for cluster decay half-lives of cluster emitters decaying from their ground and excited states to the ground and excited states of the daughter nuclei. Since the excitation energy-dependent UDL can be factorized into a zero-temperature part plus an excitation energy-dependent one (21), it is possible to calculate the coefficients of the latter separately from those with the ground state to ground state emission. To this end, eight heavy nuclei, including even-even and odd-A, are selected. For each decay, the decaying parent nucleus is in any state of a set of six of its energy levels including the ground state. Similarly, the daughter nucleus is in any state of a set of six states, including its ground state. Thus, for each decay, 36 transitions result from all the possible combinations for parent and daughter states. We limit the calculations to six excited states each of the parent and heavy daughter since considering higher levels result in very small tunneling energies of the light cluster nucleus. The latter would lead to insignificant tunneling probabilities. Apart from this we must also mention that the light cluster nucleus is chosen always to be in its ground state since the first excited state of the light nuclei considered here is of the order of few MeV and less likely to be reached by a thermal excitation as compared to the keV levels of the heavier parent and daughter nuclei. Using the nuclear data from National Nuclear Data Center [40], the parameter estimation of a1 within standard curve fit Python library is 0.1724\u00b1 0.0006 MeV1/2.\nA hindrance factor (HF ) could be defined as the ratio of the half-lives for emissions\nin which the parent nucleus or the daughter nucleus or both nuclei are excited and those in which the emission occurs from the ground state to ground state,\nHF = t1/2\n( E\u2217p , E \u2217 d ) t1/2(g.s.\u2192 g.s.) = 10\u2212a1 \u03c7 \u2032\u2206E\u2217/Q .

These results also suggest an enhancement in the cluster radioactivity process when the excitation energy of the parent nucleus is larger than that of the daughter nucleus."

            "text": "Nucleosynthesis involving the production of heavy and super-heavy nuclei is expected to happen at extremely high temperatures under explosive conditions [16]. Numerical calculations of the abundance of heavy elements such as in the r-process nucleosynthesis require the inputs from different nuclear reactions as well as decay processes. The light cluster decay mode is usually neglected in the r-process abundance calculations because the probability of occurrence is usually lower compared to that of other decay modes. Here, we explore the possibility of the cluster decay channel becoming important at elevated temperatures of the environment.\nWe examine the total enhancement of a given spontaneous emission of a light\nnucleus from excited states of a heavy nucleus (and resulting in an excited daughter nucleus) under conditions of finite temperature. For a given temperature of the environment Ts, the total cluster decay half-life is given by [41]\nt1/2(Ts) =  1 G \u2211 ij gpi exp ( \u2212E\u2217pi/kBTs ) t1/2 ( E\u2217pi , E \u2217 dj ) \u22121 , (23)\nwhere G = \u2211 i gpi exp ( \u2212E\u2217pi/kBTs ) is the standard partition function, and gpi = (2Jpi + 1) is the statistical weight with Jpi being the spin of the parent state pi. kB denotes Boltzmann\u2019s constant and Ts is the surrounding temperature. t1/2 ( E\u2217pi , E \u2217 dj ) is calculated using (21).\nFigure (2) displays the ratio between the temperature-dependent cluster decay half-\nlife and that at zero temperature for several representative temperature scales occurring in different sites of r-process nucleosynthesis [42]. It is observed that each curve is flattened at both limits of temperature, namely kBTs << E \u2217 pi and kBTs >> E \u2217 pi . In the first case, when kBTs << E \u2217 pi , the exponential term acquires a very small value for all excited states. As a result, the major contribution is from the ground state decay for which E\u2217p0 = 0 resulting in the exponential term to be unity and hence removing the\ndependence on the temperature Ts. For the case when, kBTs >> E \u2217 pi , the exponential term is close to unity for any excited state and once again the effects of the surrounding temperature are not significant. There is however a window between about 1 GK and 10 GK, in which the half-lives fall sharply with increasing temperature. This is to say that the decay rates are enhanced due to thermal excitations by few orders of magnitude in this temperature range. The latter can be a reason for the inclusion of the cluster decay channel in r-process nucleosynthesis calculations which do not consider this decay channel to be important, relying on the experimental information obtained from experiments performed in terrestrial laboratories.\nTo summarize the above discussions, we can say that the above results show that\nthe combined effect of considering both excited states in the initial and final states of decay and the temperature of the environment, is an enhancement in the probability of cluster decay."

            "text": "Universal decay laws for the emission of light clusters are usually formulated by fitting a semi-empirical formula to the experimental half-lives. Here we extend such ideas to present an excitation energy dependent universal decay law (UDL) for the emission of light clusters from heavy nuclei. The excitation energy dependent half-lives evaluated within a standardly used theoretical model which reproduces the half-lives measured in the lab (i.e. from ground state to ground state) well, is used in order to fit the\nexcitation energy-dependent parameters of the UDL. The excitation energy-dependence in the theoretical model enters through both the energy of the emitted cluster as an effective Q value and the nuclear densities which are folded onto the elementary nucleonnucleon interaction, thus giving us an excitation energy dependent double folding model.\nGiven the findings of the present work, it seems important to consider the\ntemperature and excitation energy dependent enhancement of decay rates in hot astrophysical environments. It would clearly be a formidable task to calculate the halflives for hundreds of nuclei using a theoretical model and include it in the numerical codes for nucleosynthesis. A universal decay law such as the one presented in this work is therefore a first step in this direction and a combined excitation energy dependent UDL for different decay modes such as \u03b1 decay, light cluster decay and fission could eventually be formulated for an appropriate modification of the nucleosynthesis calculations."
