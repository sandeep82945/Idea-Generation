Grenoble Alpes, CEA, Grenoble INP, IRIG, Pheliqs, 38000 Grenoble, France (Dated: March 23, 2023)\nWe consider a quantum Hall (QH) region in contact with a superconductor (SC), i.e., a QH-SC junction. Due to successive Andreev reflections, the QH-SC interface hosts hybridized electron and hole edge states called chiral Andreev edge states (CAES). We theoretically study the transport properties of these CAES by using a microscopic, tight-binding model. We find that the transport properties strongly depend on the contact geometry and the value of the filling factor. We notice that it is necessary to add local barriers at the corners of the junction in order to reproduce such properties, when using effective one-dimensional models.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCombining systems displaying a quantum Hall effect and superconductors is a difficult task, as the magnetic field needed to realize the quantum Hall effect tends to suppress superconductivity. If successful, it leads to interesting phenomena as the superconductor may induce correlations in the chiral edge states of the quantum Hall system. In particular, the formation of so-called chiral Andreev edge states (CAES) has been predicted. Semiclassically, these CAES result from skipping orbits of electrons and holes involving Andreev reflections at the quantum Hall-superconductor (QH-SC) interface [1\u20134]. Quantummechanically, the edge states along that interface are described as hybridized electron and hole states [5\u20139]. Their use for topologically protected quantum computing was also considered [10\u201312].\nA number of recent experiments have succeeded in creating QH-SC hybrid systems using either graphene [13\u201316] or InAS two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) [17], and observing evidence for CAES in the so-called downstream conductance. Namely, the downstream conductance measures the conversion of electrons into holes, involving the transfer of Cooper pairs into the superconductor along the interface. The larger the conversion probability, the smaller the downstream conductance and, in particular, it becomes negative when the conversion probability exceeds one half. While the experiments [13\u201317] did indeed measure negative downstream conductances, questions remain about the magnitude and the parameter dependence of the effect that do not match simple models: the observed signal is much smaller than expected. Furthermore, it shows either an irregular pattern [13\u201315] or remains roughly constant [17] when sweeping the field or the gate voltage, while simple models predict a regular oscillation. This stimulated further theoretical research. A suppression of the measured signal may be explained by the absorption of quasiparticles in the superconductor, for example, by subgap states in nearby vortices [14, 18\u201320], whereas the oscillations may be strongly affected by disorder [18, 19].\nHere we explore a different aspect that has not been addressed before: the role of the geometry. Namely, the downstream conductance does not probe only the properties of the QH-SC interface, but also the scattering properties at the point where this interface meets the QHvacuum interface. We find that these scattering probabili-\nties strongly depend on the geometry of the contact region. In particular, a pronounced dependence of the angle between the QH-vacuum interface and the QH-SC interface is observed. Interestingly, this opens the possibility of creating asymmetric structures, where the angles are different on the two sides of the superconductor, that may display an enhanced overall electron-hole conversion probability. This may even lead to a situation where the downstream conductance becomes negative on average.\nNote that to study the effect of geometry, a full twodimensional description of the system is necessary \u2013 simple one-dimensional models commonly used in the literature are not sufficient. Some aspects may be captured by using a generalized one-dimensional model, though there is no obvious way to determine its parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the system and the downstream conductance formula based on edge state transport whose parameters have to be computed. To do so, we first use a two-dimensional model in Sec. III. In particular, we start by studying a continuous model in Sec. III A that allows one to determine the properties of the edge states at an infinitely long interface. We then use a tight-binding model in Sec. III B to obtain the scattering probabilities at the points where two different interfaces, i.e., QH-vacuum and QH-SC, meet. With these two ingredients, we have all that is needed to compute the downstream conductance. In Sec. IV, we address the question whether the prior results may be obtained from an effective one-dimensional model. Further considerations on the role of additional nonchiral edge states and the effects of temperature can be found in Sec. V, before we conclude in Sec. VI. Some details were relegated to the appendices."

We are interested in the regime, where one spin-degenerate Landau level is occupied in the quantum Hall region, i.e., there are two chiral edge states. Introducing particle-hole space to be able to incorporate superconductivity, we can describe one spin state as an electron state and the other spin state as a hole state. While the chiral edge states along an edge with the vacuum are either\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n16 86\n7v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 2\nM ar\n2 02\n3\n2 QH SC 1\n2\ndownstream\nupstream\nC A ES\nFIG. 1. QH-SC setup: the edge of the quantum Hall region is in contact with a grounded superconductor over a finite length L. The geometry of the corners at the beginning and end of that region can be characterized by two angles each: \u03b8QH,i and \u03b8SC,i. Both the QH-vacuum and QH-SC interface host chiral edge states that can be probed by measuring the differential downstream conductance Gd = \u2202I/\u2202V , where V is the voltage applied to the upstream reservoir and I is the current flowing into the downstream reservoir. While (quasi)electron and (quasi)hole states have opposite directions of quasi-momentum along the interface, they have the same propagation direction. A typical process contributing to Gd is shown. An incoming electron |e\u3009 scatters at the first corner, propagates along the QH-SC interface as a superposition of quasielectron |qe\u3009 and quasihole |qh\u3009 CAES, then scatters at the second corner, and finally exits the superconductor in a superposition of electron |e\u3009 and hole |h\u3009. The hole probability Ph = |ph|2 of the outgoing state depends on the scattering processes at the corners as well as the interference of the CAES propagation along the QH-SC interface.\npure electron or hole states, the CAES along an edge with a superconductor are a superposition of electron and hole components. In the following, we will call them quasielectron when their momentum at the Fermi level is negative and quasihole when their momentum at the Fermi level is positive. As we will see below, for the system under consideration, this choice is in agreement with the pure electron and hole states obtained when Andreev processes are suppressed.\nWe want to study the situation where the edge of the quantum Hall system is in contact with a superconductor over a region with finite length L as shown in Fig. 1. In that case, we can define a probability Ph that an incoming electronlike state is transformed into an outgoing holelike state. It depends on the properties of the CAES along the QH-SC interface as well as the scattering amplitudes at the two corners, which begin and end that interface. Assuming ballistic propagation along the interface with a given material, the probability Ph can be written as [8]\nPh = \u03c41(1\u2212 \u03c42) + \u03c42(1\u2212 \u03c41) +2 \u221a \u03c41(1\u2212 \u03c42)\u03c42(1\u2212 \u03c41) cos(2k0L+ \u03c612), (1)\nwhere \u03c41 is the probability that the electron is converted into a quasihole at the beginning of the QH-SC interface, whereas \u03c42 is the probability that a quasielectron is con-\nverted into a hole at the end of the QH-SC interface. The second line describes the interference resulting from the fact that the particle may propagate along the QH-SC interface either as a quasielectron with momentum \u2212k0 or as a quasihole with momentum +k0. The phase shift \u03c612 depends on the phases of the scattering amplitudes at the two corners. At zero temperature, the differential downstream conductance, Gd(0) = \u2202I/\u2202V |V=0, where V is the voltage applied to the upstream reservoir and I is the current flowing into the downstream reservoir (see Fig. 1), is directly related to the probability Ph at the Fermi level, namely Gd(0) = G0(1 \u2212 2Ph), where G0 = 2e2/h is the conductance quantum. A negative downstream conductance is a clear signature of the Andreev conversion taking place at the QH-SC interface. Note that the average conductance is given as G\u0304d = G0 \u220f i=1,2(1 \u2212 2\u03c4i). For \u03c41 = \u03c42 it is limited to positive values, whereas \u03c41 6= \u03c42 allows one to realize G\u0304d < 0. For completeness, let us mention that the maximal downstream conductance is Gmaxd =\nG0[1\u2212 2( \u221a \u03c41(1\u2212 \u03c42)\u2212 \u221a \u03c42(1\u2212 \u03c41) )2], while the minimal\ndownstream conductance is Gmind = G0[1\u22122( \u221a \u03c41(1\u2212 \u03c42)+\u221a\n\u03c42(1\u2212 \u03c41) )2]. In the symmetric case \u03c41 = \u03c42 \u2261 \u03c4 , this yields Gmaxd = G0 and G min d = G0[1\u2212 8\u03c4(1\u2212 \u03c4)].\nThus, to model the experimentally measured downstream conductance, we need to determine k0 as well as the probabilities \u03c4i associated with the contact points between the QH region, the vacuum, and the superconductor. In the following, we show that k0 can be obtained semianalytically from a microscopic model of an infinite QH-SC interface. By contrast, there is no simple model for the probabilities \u03c4i. We study their dependence on system parameters and, in particular, the geometry of the contact points using tight-binding simulations. To conclude, we compare with an effective 1D model."

Note that we\n3 neglect self-consistency of the order parameter. Furthermore, we assume that the magnetic field in the superconductor is screened. Thus, choosing the Landau gauge that preserves translational invariance along the interface, we set A(x) = Bx\u0398(\u2212x)u\u0302y. The wave functions can then be written in the form:\n\u03a8(r) = eikyy\u221a Ly \u03c8ky (x), (4)\nwhere Ly is the length of the system along the y-direction and \u03c8ky is the transverse wave function associated with longitudinal wave vector ky. Following [21], we can determine the CAES by writing the wave functions \u03c8QHky (x) in the half-space x < 0 and \u03c8SCky (x) in the half-space x > 0, and matching them at the interface to obtain an eigenstate of Eq.

When the filling factor \u03bd \u2261 2\u00b5QH/\u03c9c is in the range 1 < \u03bd < 3, the chemical potential lies between the first and second (spin-degenerate) Landau levels of the QH region, and one obtains a single pair of CAES. An example of the spectrum is shown in Fig. 2, where we considered an ideal interface, i.e., \u00b5QH = \u00b5SC and V0 = 0.

Energy spectrum of the states along the QH-SC interface obtained from Eq. (9). The crossings of the CAES with the Fermi level are indicated by red lines. Here the parameters are \u00b5QH = \u00b5SC = 10\u2206, \u03bd = 2.4, and V0 = 0.\nThe Fermi momentum k0 appearing in the interference term for the downstream conductance, cf. (1), can be obtained by solving s(0,\u2213k0) = 0, which in general has to be done numerically. We observe that, as long as \u2206 \u00b5QH , \u00b5SC , the momentum k0 does not depend on \u2206. In the limit of a large interface barrier Z \u2261 2mV0 / kQHF 1 and \u03bd \u2192 3, we find k0lB 1 and an analytical solution is possible, namely k0 \u2248 (3 \u2212 \u03bd) \u221a \u03c0/4lB [9]. In Fig. 3, we show the evolution of k0 as a function of the barrier strength Z for various values of the filling factor. Typically k0 decreases with increasing \u03bd, except for a small region of intermediate values of Z and fillings \u03bd close to three.\nThe velocity of the low-energy states is given as vCAES = \u2212 \u2202kys(E, ky)/\u2202Es(E, ky) \u2223\u2223 E=0,|ky|=k0 . One may also compute the electron and hole content of the states, \u03c8(x) = (\u03c8e(x), \u03c8h(x)). We define\nfh = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx |\u03c8h|2 = 1\u2212 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx |\u03c8e|2.

Furthermore, the subscript 0 indicates that the previously introduced quantities have to be taken at E = 0 and ky = \u2212k0. Particle-hole symmetry implies f\u2212h = 1 \u2212 f+h . In the limit Z \u2192 \u221e, we recover pure electron and hole states, f+h = 0 and f \u2212 h = 1. By contrast, at Z = 0 and in the limit \u2206\u2192 0, one finds an equal repartition between electron and hole components, f+h = f \u2212 h = 1/2. As an illustrative example, we represent the content f+h of the quasielectron CAES as a function of the barrier strength Z for various values of the filling factor \u03bd in Fig. 4."

            "text": "We now turn to the scattering probabilities at the corners where the QH-vacuum interface and the QH-SC interface meet. In addition to the system parameters, this corner can be characterized by two angles as shown in Fig. 1: the angle \u03b8QH,i that the QH-vacuum interface forms with the continuation of the QH-SC interface and the angle \u03b8SC,i that the SC-vacuum interface forms with the continuation of the QH-SC interface. To ensure that there is no overlap, the angles must satisfy \u03b8QH,i+ \u03b8SC,i > 0. To compute the scattering probabilities \u03c4i as a function of these angles and system parameters, we perform tight-binding simulations with a discretized version of the Hamiltonian (3) on a square lattice using the Kwant software [24]. Introducing the Nambu spinor \u03a8i = (ci, c \u2020 i ) T , where c\u2020i (ci) is the operator that creates (annihilates) an electron at the position ri = (xi, yi), the second-quantized tight-binding\nHamiltonian reads:\nHTB = \u2211 i \u03c8\u2020i [(4t\u2212 \u00b5i + Vi)\u03c3z + \u2206i\u03c3x]\u03c8i\n+ \u2211 \u3008i,j\u3009 \u03c8\u2020i [ tei\u03c6ij\u03c3z\u03c3z ] \u03c8j , (12)\nwhere \u03c3x/z are Pauli matrices in Nambu space, and \u3008i, j\u3009 denotes pairs of nearest neighbor sites. The barrier potential is given as Vi = V0\u03b4xi,0\u0398 ( L 2 \u2212|yi| ) , where \u03b4i,j is the Kronecker delta. In the QH region, \u00b5i = \u00b5QH and \u2206i = 0, whereas in the SC region, \u00b5i = \u00b5SC and \u2206i = \u2206. Using a Peierls substitution, the hopping matrix element t = 1/(2ma2), where a is the lattice spacing, acquires a field-dependent phase [25]\n\u03c6ij = \u2212 \u03c0B\n\u03c60 (xi + xj)(yj \u2212 yi)\u03b8\n( \u2212xi + xj\n2\n) (13)\nwith \u03c60 the flux quantum. This lattice model matches the continuum model as long as the hopping energy is the largest energy scale, \u2206, \u00b5QH , \u00b5SC t. We further make realistic assumptions \u2206 \u00b5QH \u2264 \u00b5SC .\nAs the conversion probability from electron to quasihole at the first corner is equal to the conversion probability from quasielectron to hole at the second corner when parameters are chosen the same [8], \u03c41(\u03b8QH , \u03b8SC) = \u03c42(\u03b8QH , \u03b8SC) \u2261 \u03c4(\u03b8QH , \u03b8SC), it is sufficient to simulate the first QH-SC corner. The python code is available on Zenodo [26]. When not specified, we set t = 1 and \u00b5SC = t/20.\nFigure 5 shows the dependence of \u03c4 on angles for \u00b5QH = \u00b5SC = 10\u2206. In Fig. 5a, \u03b8QH = 90\n\u25e6 is fixed while \u03b8SC varies. We see a weak dependence of \u03c4 on \u03b8SC for angles up to 90\u25e6. This is not surprising as the propagation of the chiral edge states does not involve the SC-vacuum interface. The residual effect of \u03b8SC on the scattering probability is due to the modified decay of the edge state wave function into the bulk in the vicinity of the corner. As shown in Appendix B, in this regime \u03c4 also shows a more pronounced dependence on the value of \u2206 that controls the decay length in the superconductor. We illustrate this in Fig. 6 by plotting the probability density |\u03c8e(r)|2\u2212|\u03c8h(r)|2 of an incoming electron state; it can be seen that it is vanishingly small at angles < 90\u25e6 within the SC region. By contrast, \u03c4 decreases as \u03b8QH is increased. This is shown in Fig. 5b, where \u03b8SC = 90\n\u25e6 is fixed while \u03b8QH varies. The stronger sensitivity of \u03c4 on \u03b8QH can be understood as stemming from the fact that this angle directly determines the propagation direction of the edge state and thus the projection of the momentum of the incoming state onto the direction of the interface.\nA more realistic interface is obtained when allowing for different values of \u00b5QH and \u00b5SC , as well as for an interface barrier Z 6= 0. As an example, in Fig. 7 we show the evolution of \u03c4 as a function of \u03b8QH with \u00b5SC = 2\u00b5QH and Z = 0.7. The behavior is qualitatively similar though the variation with the angle is less pronounced.

If \u2206b 6= 0, \u03c4 6= \u03c40 is possible, and the model has sufficient parameters to obtain an arbitrary value of \u03c4 for a given \u03c40. Thus, in principal, this effective one-dimensional model can be used to describe an arbitrary geometry. However, there is no straightforward way to estimate parameters. As a consequence, a full two-dimensional model is necessary to determine the downstream conductance even in simple geometries.\nFor illustration, in Fig. 8 we show the downstream conductance as a function of the length of the QH-SC interface obtained from a full tight-binding simulation of the structure shown in Fig. 1. Here the same parameters were used as in Fig. 7 with \u03bd = 2.8. It is compared with the result of an effective 1D model where we set Lb = \u03be/10 with \u03be = vSCF /\u2206 the BCS coherence length, vb = vCAES and \u00b5b = \u00b5SC . We use a numerical minimization procedure to find the values of \u2206b and \u03c6b that give the scattering probabilities \u03c41, \u03c42 obtained from the tight-binding model. Fitting parameters for Fig. 8 were \u2206b1 = 10.08\u2206, \u03c6b1 = 3.382 and \u2206b2 = 0.32\u2206, \u03c6b2 = 3.002. (Note that the choice is not unique.) In addition, we adjust the scattering phase \u03c612 appearing in Eq. (1) so that the effective model matches the simulation at large L. A small mismatch between the values of k0 can be attributed to lattice effects.

As can be seen in Fig. 2, in a full 2D calculation, additional subgap states may appear. While for the parameters chosen in Fig. 2, these states are close to the gap edge, they may cross the Fermi level in other parameter regimes. An example is shown in Fig. 9. We studied their parameter dependence and found zeroenergy crossings only happen for \u03bd . 3 and close to ideal interfaces. In experimentally relevant regimes, they are not expected to play a role as discussed in Appendix A. Note that additional in-gap states may appear as well when the interface is smooth. This question has been addressed in Ref. [18].\nThe downstream conductance at finite temperature is more likely affected by these nonchiral states. Furthermore, at finite T , the linear approximation for the dispersion of the CAES may not be sufficient. Namely, as long as kBT \u2206 and continuum contributions may be neglected, the downstream conductance Gd(T ) takes the form:\nGd(T ) \u2248 G0 \u222b \u2206 \u2212\u2206 dE 1\u2212 2Ph(E) 4kBT cosh 2 (\nE 2kBT ) , (19) where Ph(E) is given by Eq.

If \u03b4k varies significantly with energy on the scale kBT , this leads to an averaging of the oscillations of the downstream conductance.

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied the downstream conductance mediated by CAES in QH-SC junctions. In particular, we found that the geometry plays an important role. This limits the applicability of simple effective 1D models that are often used to describe such systems. We showed that the most general effective 1D model containing a complex pairing potential localized in the region where the QH-vacuum edge meets the QH-SC edge allows one to model an arbitrary electron-hole conversion probability\u2014 however, there is no clear prescription as to how parameters have to be chosen. We note that the geometry dependence may be exploited to device asymmetric junctions, where the overall electron-hole conversion probability is enhanced and the average downstream conductance can become negative. This may be a way to obtain clearer signatures of the Andreev conversion at the QH-SC interface. Our work concentrated on the clean case. It will be interesting to explore how these features are modified by disorder. Disorder as well as vortices modify the propagation phase along the interface and therefore change the interference pattern. However, this effect alone does not modify the minimal and maximal values, nor the average value of the downstream conductance determined by the electronhole conversion at the corners. Thus, the geometrical effects are expected to be robust as long as the disorder does not introduce significant electron-hole scattering along the interface. On the other hand, vortices may lead to the loss of quasiparticles, thus decreasing the overall value of the downstream conductance. It is less clear how this affects the repartition between quasielectrons and quasiholes. Further studies are also needed to better characterize geometries with a narrow superconducting finger such that crossed Andreev reflections and cotunneling across the finger come into play.\n5 10 15 20 \u00b5QH/\u2206\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n\u03c4\n\u03bd = 1.2 \u03bd = 1.6 \u03bd = 2.0\n\u03bd = 2.4 \u03bd = 2.75\n(a)\n5 10 15 20 \u00b5QH/\u2206\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n\u03c4\n\u03bd = 1.2 \u03bd = 1.6 \u03bd = 2.0\n\u03bd = 2.4 \u03bd = 2.75\n(b)\nFIG. 11.

            "text": "In the main text, we show the dependence of the electron-hole conversion probability at the corners on various parameters. Here we complement our study with results on the dependence on the superconducting gap \u2206. In particular, we compare two different geometries, namely \u03b8QH = 90 \u25e6, \u03b8SC = 45 \u25e6 in Fig. 11a and \u03b8QH = 90\n\u25e6, \u03b8SC = 135\n\u25e6 in Fig. 11b.

For \u03b8SC = 45\n\u25e6 (Fig. 11a), the electronhole conversion probability depends on \u2206 only very weakly. This is consistent with the analytic results of Sec. III A, which show that the properties of the edge states are almost independent of \u2206 in the considered parameter regime. For \u03b8SC = 135\n\u25e6 (Fig. 11b), a stronger dependence is seen, in particular for \u03bd close to one and three. For angles \u03b8SC > 90\n\u25e6, the decay length of the edge state in the superconductor plays a more important role. Namely as the decay may reach the superconductor-vacuum interface, a\nstronger dependence of \u03c4 on \u2206, which controls the decay length in the superconductor, is expected. The modified decay is illustrated in Fig. 12."

            "heading": "Appendix C: Downstream conductance at finite temperature",
            "text": "As the downstream conductance at finite temperature involves integral over the hole conversion probabilities at different energies, it is important to know the dependence of the parameters determining the hole conversion probability on energy. In particular, if the momentum mismatch \u03b4k or the phase \u03c612 strongly varies with energy, the oscillations of the conductance should be averaged out upon increasing temperature.\nThe momentum mismatch \u03b4k(E) can be obtained from the continuum model. We find that, even beyond the regime where the edge state spectrum is linear, the variation of \u03b4k remains small. We illustrate our findings in Fig. 13. Here the same parameters as in Fig. 8 were used. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 13a. Additional non-chiral edge states are visible at energies |E| & \u2206/2. The relative deviations of \u03b4k(E) from \u03b4k(0) = 2k0 are shown in Fig. 13b. For small enough energies, the deviations are small, implying a nearly constant period of the oscillations. Figures 13c and 13d show the energy dependence of the conversion probabilities \u03c41 and \u03c42. Again, the variation is weak up to the energy where additional subgap states appear. Note that this is consistent with what one would obtain from our effective 1D model, where there is no energy dependence. The scattering phase \u03c612 (not shown) remains approximatively constant in this regime as well. These findings suggest that the zero-temperature results obtained for the downstream conductance are robust as long as kBT \u2206. This is confirmed by a full tight-binding simulation, shown in Fig. 14. For kBT/\u2206 = 0.1, the result is almost unaffected. By contrast, at the larger temperature kBT/\u2206 = 0.5, a clear suppression of the amplitude of the oscillations is observed while the mean value increases as energies close to \u2206 start to contribute, where variations of \u03b4k become nonnegligible and \u03c4i \u2192 0.\n9 [1] Y.
