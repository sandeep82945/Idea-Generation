            "text": "Gravitational wave (GW) observations bring a wealth of information to a broad range of topics ranging from astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. The first GW detection(Abbott et al. 2016b) opened a new way of observing the Universe. The latest measurements from the LIGOVirgo-KAGRA (LVK)(Gregory 2010; Aso et al. 2013; Acernese et al. 2014; Aasi et al. 2015; Abbott et al. 2016a, 2018; Tse et al. 2019; Akutsu et al. 2020; Abbott et al. 2021a) have detected 90 compact objects which constituents of binary neutron stars (BNSs), neutron star binary black holes (NSBHs), and binary black holes (BBHs) (Abbott et al. 2021b). The observed GW sources give a direct probe to infer the mass distribution of the compact objects across a range of cosmic redshifts. The recent measurement by the LVK col-\n\u2020 ckarathanasis@ifae.es \u2021 suvodip@tifr.res.in \u00a7 simone.mastrogiovanni@oca.eu\nlaboration exhibit that the mass distribution of the BBHs shows a power-law+Gaussian (PLG) distribution (Abbott et al. 2019b, 2021e,b,c,d). Along with the mass distribution, a power-law model of the BBHs merger rate is inferred from LVK analysis (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2021e,b,c,h). The mass distribution of GW sources and the merger rate provides a direct way to understand the formation channel of BBHs if an underlying physical model can be inferred from observations.\nThe currently used phenomenological PLG model of mass distribution does not consider redshift evolution. However, the mass distribution of the astrophysical BBHs is likely to exhibit a redshift dependence due to the dependence of the black hole masses on stellar properties, such as the stellar metallicity (Bethe & Brown 1998; Portegies Zwart & Yungelson 1998; Heger & Woosley 2002; Belczynski et al. 2002; Dominik et al. 2012; Dominik et al. 2015; Mapelli et al. 2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017; Giacobbo et al. 2018; Toffano et al. 2019; Farmer et al. 2019a; Renzo et al. 2020; Baxter et al. 2021; Mehta et al. 2022). One of the inevitable ways the BBHs distribution can get a complex redshift dependence\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n13 49\n5v 5\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nO ]\n5 M\nis through a time delay acting between the binary formation and the merger. (Mukherjee 2022). This delay causes the population of BBHs at a given redshift to encode information of astrophysical processes and channels that were present at a different cosmic epoch. The time delay contribution will produce a BBH population at a merger redshift z (hat is non-trivial to describe with simple models) which is composed by black holes formed at different cosmic times with possibly different astrophysical formation channels. The time delay distribution and the dependence of the astrophysical processes on cosmic time can lead to a non-trivial BBH merger mass spectrum.\nThe mass distribution of the BBHs can also play an important role in inferring the cosmic expansion history (Taylor et al. 2012; Farr et al. 2019; Mastrogiovanni et al. 2021a; You et al. 2021; Mancarella et al. 2021; Mukherjee 2022; Leyde et al. 2022; Ezquiaga & Holz 2022). As the masses of the GW sources are redshifted (mdet = (1 + z)m), one can expect to infer the redshift from the mass distribution of the GW sources, if the mass distribution of the BBHs can exhibit a universal property or at least a standardized behavior. We can break the mass-redshift degeneracy and infer the cosmic expansion history from dark standard sirens without applying the cross-correlation technique (Oguri 2016; Mukherjee & Wandelt 2018; Mukherjee et al. 2020, 2021a; Bera et al. 2020; Scelfo et al. 2020; Mukherjee et al. 2021b; Can\u0303as-Herrera et al. 2021; Scelfo et al. 2022; Cigarra\u0301n D\u0131\u0301az & Mukherjee 2022; Mukherjee et al. 2022) or statistical host identification technique (Schutz 1986; MacLeod & Hogan 2008; Del Pozzo 2012; Arabsalmani et al. 2013; Gray et al. 2020; Fishbach et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2021g; Soares-Santos et al. 2019; Finke et al. 2021; Abbott et al. 2020b; Palmese et al. 2021). However, if BBHs mass distribution exhibits redshift dependence due to its intrinsic dependence on the delay time distribution, then cosmic redshifts cannot be accurately inferred (Mukherjee 2022; Ezquiaga & Holz 2022), and it can bias the results if the redshift dependence of the mass distribution is not considered. Exploring the merger rate distribution to explore cosmology from dark sirens is also studied for the third generation GW detectors (Ding et al. 2019; Ye & Fishbach 2021; Leandro et al. 2022).\nIn this paper, we make a first joint estimation of the BBH merger rate evolution, mass distribution, and metallicity dependance parameters, by allowing for the redshift dependence of the BBH mass distribution and H0. This measurement makes it possible to also infer the delay time distribution of the BBHs in a consistent framework along with the cosmological parameters. The paper is organized as follows, In Sec. 2.1 we discuss the redshift dependence of the mass distribution of the BBHs and its merger rate. In Sec. 3 and Sec. 4 we discuss the basic Bayesian framework used in this analysis, the results from the joint estimation and we compare these results with the results inferred by the LVK collaboration. Finally, we conclude the analysis of this work and future prospects in Sec. 5."

            "heading": "2.1 The redshift dependence of the mass distribution: Mixing of black holes",
            "text": "The distribution of BBHs observed by LVK spans a range of redshift and masses which is currently modeled using different phenomenological models out of which the PLG model fits the data the best (Abbott et al. 2019b, 2021e,b,c,d) but does not explore the redshift dependence of the BBH mass distribution. In this paper, we explore how an astrophysically motivated mass distribution of the BBHs originating due to the effect of the time delay distribution agrees with the GWTC-3 data. The observed mass distribution of the BBHs is driven by the underlying astrophysical properties of the parent stars of the individual black hole and the mixing of black holes formed in different redshifts, both of which lead to a redshift dependence of the observed BBH mass distribution.\nThe redshift dependence of the observed BBH mass distribution in the mixing of binary black hole model, that we consider in this analysis, is due to three effects, (i) metallicity dependence of the pair-instability supernovae (PISN) mass scale, (ii) redshift evolution of the stellar metallicity, (iii) distribution of delay times between the formation of the stars that will later become BHs, and for them to merge with another black hole. We will briefly describe below all these aspects.\n(i) According to the PISN process, the mass distribution of BHs is expected to feature a mass gap due to the mass loss of heavy stars (Spera & Mapelli 2017; Farmer et al. 2019a; Renzo et al. 2020). The mass loss during the PISN sets the lower limit of the mass gap at around MPISN = 45 M . However, MPISN is also closely related to the stellar metallicity. It was shown (Spera & Mapelli 2017; Farmer et al. 2019a; Renzo et al. 2020) that MPISN varies less than 10% for a variation of the stellar metallicity Z from 10\u22125 to 3\u00d7 10\u22123 from a 1-D stellar evolution model Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) (Paxton et al. 2011, 2019). The stars with higher metallicity have a larger mass loss due to stellar winds, which leads to a lower value of the PISN mass scale, than stars formed with lower metallicity. As a result, the position of the MPISN will vary. Given the simplicity of current modeling of stellar winds in 1-D codes such as MESA and the lack of independent observations to determine the PISN mass scale, the dependence of MPISN on stellar properties is still subject to large uncertainties.\n(ii) The metallicity in the Universe varies with redshift and also with the individual galaxies. The global evolution of the\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nstellar metallicity (Belczynski et al. 2002; Dominik et al. 2012; Dominik et al. 2015; Mapelli et al. 2017; Giacobbo et al. 2018; Safarzadeh & Farr 2019; Toffano et al. 2019) indicates that the Universe at high redshift has poor stellar metallicity than at low redshift. As a result, the BHs formed at high redshift may have a higher PISN mass scale than the BHs formed at low.\n(iii) Finally, the BHs which we observe using GWs, are not the individual BHs, but binaries. Though the formation of a black hole takes only a few Myrs, a black hole requires much more time to form a binary and merge. As a result, there is a non-zero delay time between the formation of a star and the merging of BHs. This delay time depends on the formation channels of the BBHs (O\u2019Shaughnessy et al. 2010; Banerjee et al. 2010; Dominik et al. 2012; Dominik et al. 2015; Mandel & de Mink 2016; Lamberts et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2018; Elbert et al. 2018; Eldridge et al. 2019; Vitale et al. 2019; du Buisson et al. 2020; Santoliquido et al. 2021). Moreover, the delay time is not a fixed number for all the BHs, but rather it follows a distribution that is expected to be a power law from simulations. For a flat in the log-space distribution of the separation of the BHs, the delay time distribution is going to be t\u22121d with a minimum delay time from a few hundreds of Myrs to a few Gyrs, depending on the formation channels. The current constraints from GWTC-2 (Fishbach & Kalogera 2021) and the stochastic GW background (Mukherjee & Silk 2021) are weak. In the future, data-driven measurement is possible by combining GW sources with emission line signal (Mukherjee & Dizgah 2021). Consequently, by combining these three effects, we can expect that the observed BHs detected in a binary system are going to have a redshift-dependent mass distribution due to a phenomena of mixing of BHs.\nOrigin of the redshift dependence of black hole masses: Following the analysis that was presented in Mukherjee (2022) the mass distribution of BHs at a merging redshift zm is given by\np(m1|zm,\u03a6m1 ,\u03a6d,\u03a6nuis) = p(m1|zm,\u03a6m1)Wtd(m1; zm|\u03a6nuis). (2) where m1 is the most massive BH mass in the source frame, p(m1|zm,\u03a6m1) is a BH mass distribution which can be associated with the initial stellar mass function (IMF) and Wtd(m; zm) is the window function that takes into account the delay time of the mergers (Mukherjee et al. 2021c) . The BH mass model used in this analysis is described in detail later in Eq. (10). The window function given in Eq. (2) is calculated using\nWtd(m; zm) = N \u222b \u221e zm Pt(td|tmind , tmaxd , d) dt dzf W (m; zf )dzf ,\n(3) where N is a normalization factor, Pt(td|tmind , tmaxd , d) is the delay time distribution, W (m; zf ) is a Heaviside step function W (m; zf ) = \u0398(MPISN(zf )\u2212m) and zf is the redshift of the formation of a black hole which puts a cutoff up to a mass of MPISN. The delay time distribution is taken to be a simple power-law function of the delay time td:\nPt(td|tmind , tmaxd , d) \u221d\n{ (td) d , for tmind < td < t max d\n0 , otherwise , (4)\nand the delay time is given by td = tm \u2212 tf , with the notation tm = t(zm), tf = t(zf ) to be the time of merger and time\nof formation respectively. The Wtd(m; zm) function brings a breaking point Mbreak at the mass distribution, after which the mass distribution is suppressed depending on the form of the delay time distribution, the dependence of the PISN mass scale on stellar metallicity and the redshift evolution of the stellar metallicity. It is evaluated from the combination of different MPISN values which are governed by the minimum delay time tmind , metallicity evolution \u03b3Z and dependence of PISN mass scale on metallicity \u03b1Z. The evolution of the Mbreak for different choices of these parameters can be seen in Fig. 1. At a given zm, the value of Mbreak(zm) is the minimum of PISN over the formation redshifts included in z(zm, t min d ) < zf < z(zm, t max d ), namely\nMbreak(zm) = mintd\u2208[tmind ,t max d ]MPISN(zf (td, zm)). (5)\nAssuming the dependence of the PISN mass scale on metallicity MPISN(Z) studied by Spera & Mapelli (2017); Farmer et al. (2019a); Renzo et al. (2020) can be reliably scaled using a parameter \u03b1Z (Mukherjee 2022), we can then model it with metalicity as:\nMPISN(Z) = MPISN(Z\u2217)\u2212 \u03b1Z log10(Z/Z\u2217), (6)\nand for a power-law redshift evolution of the stellar metallicity (as supported by the current observations (Mannucci et al. 2010; Sommariva et al. 2012; Krumholz & Dekel 2012; Dayal et al. 2013; Madau & Dickinson 2014)), we can write the redshift dependence of metallicity as logZ(z) = \u03b3Zz + \u03b6. Consequently, the previous equation can be written as:\nMPISN(z) = MPISN(Z\u2217)\u2212 \u03b1Z[\u03b3Zz + \u03b6 \u2212 log10(Z\u2217)], (7)\nwhere \u03b6 = 10\u22122 is taken to be a constant to match the low redshift measurement of the stellar metallicity Z(z = 0) \u2248 10\u22122 and Z\u2217 = 10\n\u22124. We select this Z\u2217 value as it is a midvalue inside the range for which PISN dependence has been explored in 1-D stellar mass model (Farmer et al. 2019a). In our analysis, we sample for the value of MPISN(Z\u2217).\nThe above expression is written in terms of the global evolution of stellar metallicity with redshift. However, at any particular redshift, there is going to be additional variation in the stellar metallicity depending on the property of the\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nhost galaxy. So, we would expect variation in the parameter \u03b3Z on the property of the host galaxy. However, currently, due to the poor sky location error of the GW sources, we cannot identify the host galaxy and hence cannot model the parameter \u03b3Z as a function of the galaxy. As a result, there can be an additional variation in the \u03b3Z that cannot be well modeled currently. Similarly, the parameter \u03b1Z controls the dependence of the PISN mass scale on the metallicity (Farmer et al. 2019a). Hence we treat both these parameters as nuisance parameters in this analysis. We choose wide priors on \u03b1Z, \u03b3Z which broadly include expected values from works cited above.\nThe connection of the observed BBH mass distribution with the PISN mass scale: We model the distribution of BBHs in terms of their source frame masses m1,m2 (with m1 > m2) and merger redshift zm of the binary as\np(m1,m2|zm,\u03a6m,\u03a6d,\u03a6nuis) = p(m1|zm,\u03a6m1 ,\u03a6d,\u03a6nuis)p(m2|m1,\u03a6m2)S1S2, (8)\nThe masses in the detector frame (or redshifted masses) are given by:\nmdet = (1 + zm)m, (9)\nwhere m are the masses in the source frame. To capture the mass distribution of BBHs that originate from the BHs mass distribution of Eq. 2, we consider p(m1|zm,\u03a6m1) to be given by a power-law distribution superpositioned with the distribution of a Gaussian peak (Talbot & Thrane 2018; Abbott et al. 2021h,d,b):\np(m1|zm,\u03a6m1) = (1\u2212 \u03bbg)P (m1|Mmin,Mmax,\u2212\u03b1) +\u03bbgG(m1|Mbreak(zm), \u03c3g), (10)\nwhere \u03a6m1 = {Mmin,Mmax, \u03b1, \u03bbg,Mbreak(zm), \u03c3g}, G(m1|Mbreak(zm), \u03c3g) is a Gaussian distribution with \u00b5 = Mbreak(zm) and \u03c3 = \u03c3g and P (m1|Mmin,Mmax,\u2212\u03b1) is a power-law distribution with slope \u2212\u03b1 between Mmin and Mmax. In this model the power-law part of the mass distribution is motivated by the power-law form of the initial mass function (IMF) Kroupa (2002) and the Gaussian part of the mass distribution is motivated by the PISN mass scale. The sources merging at redshift zm due to the contribution from all the higher redshift will lead to an excess near the value of Mbreak and then a decline in the mass distribution due to the window function. The position of the Gaussian peak \u00b5 is considered at the break of the window function at that redshift, which depends on the metallicity dependence of the PISN mass scale and delays time distribution. The value of the PISN mass scale is inferred for the metallicity value at Z\u2217 = 10\n\u22124 (for which the results are obtained by Farmer et al. (2019b)). The Gaussian peak modeled in this analysis gets a physical motivation expected from the PISN mass scale but is also expected to evolve as a function of the redshift of BBHs mergers.\nThe distribution of m2 in the source frame is considered to be given by a power law with maximum value m1:\np(m2|\u03a6m2) = P (m2|Mmin,m1, \u03b2). (11)\nSince m2 is conditional to m1, the window function Wtd is being applied also to m2 indirectly.\nFinally, the functions S(1,2) = S(m(1,2)|\u03b4m,Mmin) are\nsigmoid-like window functions to smooth the lower end of the distributions (see appendix A of (Abbott et al. 2021d)). We choose to consider only the position of the Gaussian peak to vary with redshift since this is the most prominent feature in the mass spectrum of BHs and is the bestconstrained parameter. Other mass parameters of the mass model (Mmax, \u03b1,Mmin, ...) can also be given a redshift or metallicity dependence (van Son et al. 2022). However currently, with the limited number of GW sources, measurement of the redshift dependence of the additional parameters will be difficult or unlikely to be strongly constraining."

Current observations from LVK can measure BBHs at redshifts (z < 1) (for a fiducial model of cosmology).\nThe above discussion shows that the delay time distribution Pt(td|tmind , tmaxd , d) plays a role in both the mass distribution of the BHs and also in their merger rates. As a result, to infer the BBH formation channel and the delay time distribution, it will be necessary to use both merger rate and mass distribution to infer the delay time distribution of BBHs. Moreover, to estimate the redshift of the BHs from their mass distribution, one needs to account for the redshift dependence of the BBH mass distribution. As a result, we need to conjointly infer the cosmological parameters along with the delay time distribution of BHs, and the black hole mass distribution, to correctly marginalize the degenerate parameters."

Moreover, the choice of a high SNR threshold is motivated by the fact that our selection biases are evaluated with injections in simulated and not real data. Detection properties between simulated data and real data might be different, especially when lowering the threshold for detection. For all the events, we also require a False Alarm Rate < 0.25 yr\u22121.\nThe injection campaign is done in simulated data with duration and sensitivity typical of O1, O2, and O3. For all the observing runs, we assume independent duty cycles among the LIGO Hanford (H1), LIGO Livingston (L1), and Virgo (V1) detectors taken from (Abbott et al. 2021f) for O1 and O2 and O3 (Buikema et al. 2020; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2023). For O1 we assume duty cycles of 64.6% for H1 and 57.4% for L1, while in O2 it was 65.3% and 61.8%. For the entire O3, we assumed 74.6% for H1, 77.0% for L1, and 76.0% for V1. We used the power spectral density of the publicly available detectors for O11 and O2 2, while for O3 we used an estimation provided with the first three months of O3a 3. Moreover we have assumed the noise of the detector to be Gaussian and stationary. The injections are performed using the IMRPhenomPv2 waveform model and are drawn from a distribution in detector frame masses and luminosity distance large enough to cover all the detectable sources"

Case-3 : as Case-2 but keeping the value of the delay time power-law index fixed and equal to d = \u22121, which is usually assumed as a fiducial scenario for flat in the log-space distribution of the separation between the binaries.\nThe analysis for Case-3 (with a fixed value of d = \u22121) is motivated to find the constraints on the parameter space for the fiducial scenario of the delay time distribution, which resembles closely previous analysis (Abbott et al. 2021b). The priors of the runs for each of the parameters can be found in Table 1. We have summarised the estimated values of the parameters for different cases in Table 2. All the quoted values of the error bars are 68% confidence intervals unless mentioned otherwise.\nCase-1 (GW source population + H0): For this scenario, the joint constraints on the thirteen GW source population parameters and one cosmological parameter, H0, is shown in Fig. 5. The joint estimation can be broadly classified into the parameters related to the delay time + merger rate, mass distribution, and cosmology. Among the delay time +\nmerger rate parameters, we find that data support a scenario of a steep increase in the redshift evolution of the merger rate (d < \u22121), with BBHs merger rate density at z = 0 R0 = 22.3 +7.5 \u22125.7 Gpc\n\u22123 yr\u22121. Our constraint on the GW merger rate at high redshifts is dominated by our assumptions on the SFR and the constraints we obtain on the time-delay parameters at low redshifts. However, if there is a different population of BBHs that do not contribute to low redshifts according to the Madau-Dickinson SFR, but contributes to the high redshift such as the Pop-III star, that cannot be constrained from this analysis. The expected number of events after including the detector noise and duty cycle agrees well with the total number of events with SNR > 12 considered in this analysis.\nUsing this model, we impose constraints on the minimum delay time distribution tmind < 10 Gyrs\n4. We find the powerlaw index of the delay time distribution to be constrained d < \u22120.7 and there is a mild preference towards values lower than d = \u22121 as expected from a simple scenario of flat in the log-space distribution of object separation of the binaries. This measurement shows a steep distribution of the delay time and hints towards scenario formation channels having\n4 Upper or lower limits are based on the 90% CL\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nless probability of a large delay time. The constraints on the tmind and d obtained here are driven by the joint estimation of the merger rate and mass distribution of the BBHs. Larger (smaller) values of tmind or larger (smaller) values of d support higher (lower) delay time values in P (td). Mergers of BBH from higher redshifts are supported from the scenarios with large values of tmind or large values of d. The BBHs with heavier component masses in the data are fitted with BHs appearing from a higher redshift with higher PISN masses and a non-zero value of the delay time.\nIn our analysis, we also constrain models with a metallicity evolution in the Universe through the parameter \u03b3Z . The value of the parameter \u2212\u03b3Z = 3.2+1.1\u22121.25 shows that there\n5 Measurements around the median are based on the 68% CL\nis likely an evolution of the metallicity of the parent stars. In comparison to the current observations, (Mannucci et al. 2010; Sommariva et al. 2012; Krumholz & Dekel 2012; Dayal et al. 2013; Madau & Dickinson 2014) and also proposed from simulations (Genel 2016; Torrey et al. 2019), the posterior on \u03b3Z is consistent, supporting a decrease in the stellar metallicity with redshift. However, depending on the metallicity of the host galaxy, the parameter \u03b3Z can have additional dependence on the astrophysical property of the host galaxy (Artale et al. 2019, 2020), and hence can exhibit additional variation from the mean metallicity value of the Universe. Such effects can show up when more events are available and hence better modeling of the BBHs population will be needed.\nThe parameters related to the mass distribution are also constrained well using a model. We have obtained a value of the power-law index of the mass distribution \u03b1 = 3.2+1.0\u22120.8\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nand \u03b2 = 1.0+1.2\u22120.9. We also find support for a feature over a simple power-law in the mass spectrum of BBH mergers with a relative height of the feature with respect to the power-law component of \u03bbg < 0.13 and the position of the feature is inherited at a fiducial metallicity from MPISN(Z\u2217) = 46.8 +6.8 \u22127.3 M at Z\u2217 = 10 \u22124. Differently from (Abbott et al. 2021b), we are not able to exclude with confidence the value \u03bbg = 0 (absence of a peak feature). This is due to the use of selection criteria based on a higher SNR cut instead of an IFAR cut. We verified that with a vanilla PLP model and an IFAR cut\nof 1 yr as in (Abbott et al. 2021b), we can exclude the absence of the peak.)\nThe position of the peak agrees with the theoretically predicted position of the PISN mass scale between 45-60 M (Farmer et al. 2019a; Renzo et al. 2020; Baxter et al. 2021). In Fig. 9, we show the PISN position is translated to the BBH merger primary mass spectrum when taking into account the full-time-delay model. As we can see from the figure, the PISN mass scale between 45-60 M is translated to a BBH merger excess at around 35 M for z < 0.2. This is compatible with the overdensity of BBHs observed by the\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nLVK in Abbott et al. (2021b). However, as redshift increases this moves to higher masses and appears to become more prominent.\nFor high-mass BBH, we see a significant increase in merger rate with redshift, clearly indicating that there is support for a higher merger rate from high masses at higher redshift in comparison to the low redshift. The posterior distribution of the MPISN parameter is shown separately in Fig. 11 (bottom, blue curve). The PISN mass scale depends on the value of metallicity and this value of MPISN is defined in our analysis at the value of Z\u2217 = 10 \u22124, which is in agreement with\nthe parameters chosen in the simulation by (Farmer et al. 2019a). The dependence of the PISN mass scale on metallicity is stronger, i.e. the probable values of \u03b1Z are larger, in this model than is expected from the 1-D stellar evolution models of Paxton et al. (2011, 2019).\nAlso, as it is evident from Fig. 5 the data has strongly suppressed any negative values of \u03b1Z . So, scenarios of a decrease in the PISN mass scale with a decrease in the metallicity are strongly ruled out.\nIt is important to note that the current theoretical estimation on the dependence of the PISN mass scale is sub-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nject to the assumption of the stellar wind models and 1-D stellar evolution code MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2019). To explain the current LVK observation of the GWTC-3 by a first-generation BBH formation scenario, one needs a stronger dependence of the PISN mass scale on the stellar metallicity and higher merger rate of the high mass BHs at high redshift. However, in the future with a higher number of sources, a better understanding of the formation channel of the BBHs will be possible.\nPreviously redshift dependence of different phenomenological models of BBH mass distribution was explored from GWTC-2 (Fishbach et al. 2021). They found strong evidence for the redshift evolution of the mass model when considering a truncated power law with a sharp cut-off at high masses. However, the data were consistent with both an evolving and\na non-evolving mass distribution when they considered a broken power-law model as a mass model. Those findings are broadly in agreement with our results.\nWe find that most of the parameters do not show up significant deviation from previous results (Abbott et al. 2021b,d). However, differently from (Abbott et al. 2021b,d), \u03c3g is not well constrained. The high \u03c3g estimation is an indication that there may not be a Gaussian feature in the mass distribution and the mass distribution can be smeared with an extended distribution in the masses at the higher end.\nFinally, a weak measurement of the Hubble constant H0 = 42+19\u221212 km/s/Mpc is made which is in the agreement with the values from Planck-2018 (Aghanim et al. 2018), SH0ES (Riess et al. 2021) due to large uncertainty in the current measurements. However, note the correlation between the Hubble constant and the tmind parameter in Fig. 5. This indicates that not being able to correctly infer the PISN mass scale and the value of tmind can lead to an incorrect inference of the cosmological parameters (Mukherjee 2022).\nCase-2 (Main model): In this case, we only focus on the GW source population keeping the value of cosmological parameters fixed at the Planck-2018 (Aghanim et al. 2018). The corresponding joint estimations of the parameters are shown in Fig. 6. From the posteriors, we can obtain the merger rate model for various samples, along with the median. This can be seen in Fig. 7. We find that the value of the MPISN(Z\u2217) = 44.4 +7.9 \u22126.3 M , has moved to lower values with respect to the value allowing H0 to vary. The value of tmind shows a maximum a posteriori around 1.5 Gyrs and a significantly narrower posterior with respect to Case-1. The posteriors for tmind and d are consistent with the case of varying H0. We also find d < \u22120.87 for this case. We retrieve weak evidence of MPISN(z) evolving with redshift as the \u03b1Z parameter supports positive values. The value of MPISN (z) spans from around 30 M for z = 0 up to around 40 M for z = 1. As shown in Fig. 8, the redshift evolution of the PISN mass scale shows a weak variation over the redshift range z \u2208 [0, 1]. However, more observation will be required to confidently make any detection of the redshift evolution of PISN mass distribution. A few samples in Fig. 8 show MPISN(z) values around 80 M at redshift z = 0 and exhibit a de-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\ncrease in the MPISN(z) with redshift evolution. Those arise from the tail of the posterior distribution due to statistical fluctuations.\nComparison of the simple PLG peak model with our model we retrieve a Bayes factor (BFPLG/main model) equal to log10(BFPLG/main model) = 0.32 in favor of the simple PLG peak model. So, we conclude that there is a slight but insignificant preference for the PLG model. A higher number of detections is required to obtain decisive evidence for or against the redshift evolution of the BBH mass distribution.\nWe also compare the results with the events from GWTC-\n3 with SNR > 11 in Fig. A1 (shown in the appendix). The results are consistent with the measurement of the parameters made with events having an SNR > 12. In this analysis, we have not considered the GW event GW190521 (Abbott et al. 2020a) which has a much higher value of the component masses. Results including GW190521 can be seen in the appendix (see in Fig. B1). Constraints on the GW source parameters are very similar for both with or without GW190521.\nTo explore whether the model struggles to fit high masses seen in the data, we also consider a variation of our main\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\nmodel. We refer to this modification as the \u201cHigh mass\u201d model and in this we impose the window function Wtd only in the Gaussian peak of the distribution, leaving the power law intact. For a given redshift, we can fit higher mass events with respect to our main model. However, this model is not physically motivated within the framework of mixing binary black holes scenarios. The posteriors we obtained for the High mass model can be seen in the appendix (see in Fig. C2) and are broadly consistent with the results obtained for our default model. Moreover, the value of the Bayes Factor in favor of our baseline model with respect to this \u201cHigh mass\u201d model is log10(BFmain model/High mass) = 0.17. This implies that both models fit the data equally with a slight preference in favor of the baseline model. In App. C we provide more details about this comparison.\nCase-3 (GW source population (with fixed d = \u22121) parameters): In Case-1 and Case-2, we have seen a value of\nthe power-law index significantly away from d = \u22121 (usually considered as a fiducial value (Fishbach & Kalogera 2021; Mukherjee & Silk 2021)), which is possible for scenarios with flat in log space distribution of the separation between the BHs. Here we perform a joint estimation with the value of the power-law index fixed at d = \u22121. The corresponding joint estimations of the parameters are shown in Fig. 10. For this case, the merger rate normalization is R0 = 27.3 +7.4 \u22126.5 Gpc\u22123 yr\u22121, and the constraints on the minimum delay time tmind have been reduced (though completely in agreement with the value obtained with d varying from the two previous cases). This happens because, for a scenario with a fixed value of the parameter d = \u22121, the peak of the merger rate distribution is shifted towards a lower redshift, as a result by allowing a smaller value of the delay time tmind , the peak of the merger rate position shifts towards a higher redshift. The position of the Gaussian peak has a very similar value MPISN(Z\u2217) = 43.8 +7.5 \u22126.5 M with respect to the previous results of Case-2. Among all our time delay models, we find that the preferred model is Case-2, namely the case in which cosmology is fixed but the index of the time delay distribution d varies. More interestingly, the Case-3 model (d = \u22121) is disfavored with respect to Case-2 by a Bayes factor of log10(BFvary d/fixed d) = 0.38. However, this is not enough to claim any statistical evidence and we can not conclude any preference towards against or in favor of d = \u22121. The posteriors of tmind and MPISN(Z\u2217) can be seen in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 11 for the three main cases that we considered.\nThe results obtained using our model including the delay time distribution and redshift evolution in the merger rate indicate a value of MPISN = 44.4 +7.9 \u22126.3. In this model, the heavy mass BHs are formed from the low metallicity parent stars at a high redshift that has merged at a low redshift due to a delay time distribution function which allows large values of time delay. The Bayes factor in favor of this model in comparison to the phenomenological model of PLG is comparable and cannot be well distinguished at this stage. However, in the future with more data, we will likely be able to distinguish between different scenarios.\nOne of the major drawbacks of the baseline model considered here is that it only considers first-generation BBHs and not the scenarios where the second-generation BBHs are present. As a result, the presence of heavier masses observed in GWTC-3 is expected to arise from stars with low metallicity. However, in reality, there can be second-generation BBHs that can contribute to the observed population. A successful physics-driven model needs to consider this aspect as well. We will explore this in a future work."

            "text": "The mass, spin, and merger rate of BBHs are a direct probe to infer their formation channels. Though the information available from observations of BBH component spins is limited (see e.g. Abbott et al. (2021b)), we can infer the masses and luminosity distance of several BBHs using the network of LIGO/Virgo detectors. The mass distribution and merger rate of the BBHs are likely to exhibit a redshift dependence due to the dependence on the stellar metallicity and forma-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\ntion channel of BBHs. In this work, we consider a model which considers the redshift dependence of BBH mass distribution due to the mixing of binary black holes and the redshift dependence of merger rate. We used a Bayesian analysis and estimated the values of the model\u2019s parameters using the latest GW catalog of LVK GWTC-3.\nBy fitting this model with the data with both GW source parameters and cosmological parameters. We show that using a time-delay distribution for BBHs and a PISN mass model in redshift, it is possible to obtain a value ofMPISN(Z\u2217) compatible with astrophysical expectations. This shows that the BBH excess in the mass profile of BHs could likely be reconciled with the PISN mass-scale value of around 40\u221250 M when time delay information is considered. However, if there exist BHs of second-generation that are going to have masses heavier than predicted by the PISN mass scale, then such systems cannot be captured by this model. Though we have found that current data equally favors a model allowing only for first-generation BBH mergers with redshift-dependent mass distribution over the phenomenological redshift-independent PLG mass model. There is also an indication of the redshift dependence of the BBH mass distribution, but this trend is not statistically significant. More observations will be required to better understand the redshift dependence. Our analysis also indicates a value of \u03b1Z = 7.0 +4.0 \u22122.9 for the Case-2 (fixed H0 case). This variation is 3\u2212 4 times larger than the typical value people expect from 1-D stellar simulations and a simplistic prescription of stellar wind models Farmer et al. (2019b). In the future with more data, if these results hold, then one needs to better understand the dependence of metallicity on MPISN(Z\u2217).\nIn the hypothesis that the BBHs we consider are formed in a stellar binary scenario, we provide an upper limit for the minimum of the time delay distribution. The delay time distribution agrees with the formation channels explored in the literature. We find support for values of the power-law index of the delay time distribution d < \u22121. The value d = \u22121 is usually considered as the fiducial value for flat in-log space distribution of the spacing between the binaries. We retrieve values d < \u22121 for the power index of the time delay distribution. Though we can not exclude with certainty the fiducial scenario d = \u22121, we do find a mild preference for smaller values.\nIn our analysis, we also jointly infer the value of the Hubble constant, which currently exhibits a large uncertainty and hence is consistent with the value of the Hubble constant inferred from Planck-2018 and SH0ES. However, one of the important parts is that the Hubble constant shows strong degeneracy with the GW source parameters. In particular, in this paper, we have shown that the estimation of the Hubble constant could also be impacted by the BBHs time delay distribution. As a result, if the inferred value of the GW source population is incorrect, then it can bias the value of the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameter estimation.\nIn the future with the availability of more sources from the next observation run, a better measurement of the GW source population along with the cosmological parameters will be possible. This will shed light on the formation channels of the binary systems and the redshift dependence of the BH mass distribution. Also, improvement in the theoretical modeling will be required to capture the underlying distribution of the BBHs from both the first generation and second generations."

However, the posterior for Mmax seems to give more stringent constraints in this case, with high values of masses being disfavoured. This is expected since in this model the power law is left intact allowing for significant support for higher values in the mass distribution after the MPISN. Therefore, because we do not have posterior samples in these ranges of masses, the Bayesian inference can exclude the very high mass values. This does not affect our estimations for the time delay parameters, since the posteriors are in agreement with those from our main model.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201315 (2022)\n2.5 5.0 7.5\n10 .0\n0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 60 901 201 501 80\n3 4 5 6\n24 32 40 48 56 (\n*)\n2 4 6 8 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n2 4 6 8 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0 3.2 2.4 1.6 0.8\n4 3 2 1\n15 30 45 60\n12 6 0 61 2\n2.5 5.0 7.510 .0 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 60 9012 0 15 0 18 0 3 4 5 6 24 32 40 48 56 ( *) 2 4 6 8 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2 4 6 8 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0 3.22.41.60.8 4 3 2 1 12 6 0 6 12\nFigure A1.
