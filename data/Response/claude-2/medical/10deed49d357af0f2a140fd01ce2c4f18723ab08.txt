 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Investigate other transition metal oxides besides TiO2 as electron-selective contacts for silicon solar cells. The paper studied TiO2 but there may be other materials with better band alignments. 

2. Optimize the TiO2 deposition and annealing process for industrial scale manufacturing. The paper used lab-scale techniques but translating this to an industrial process could improve efficiency and reduce costs.

3. Study the long-term stability and degradation mechanisms of TiO2 carrier-selective contacts. It's important to understand how the contacts hold up over years in the field.

4. Combine the TiO2 electron-selective contact with advanced light-trapping techniques like photonic or plasmonic structures. This could further boost efficiency.

5. Try depositing TiO2 with spatial selectivity just in the n+ doped regions. This could simplify cell processing compared to a blanket TiO2 layer.
