    "abstractText": "The topic of modification of magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) using specific functional additives is very much pronounced in the research of alternative building materials. This study deals with the co-doping of MOC by 1D and 2D carbon nanomaterials in order to improve its mechanical properties while using tannic acid (TA) as a surfactant. Furthermore, the effect of TA on MOC also improves its water resistance. As a filler, three size fractions of standard quartz sand are used. The proposed types of MOC-based composites show promising results considering their mechanical, macroand microstructural, chemical, and hygric properties. The use of 1D and 2D nanoadditives and their mixture enables the improvement in the flexural strength and particularly the softening coefficient, which is the durability parameter characterizing the resistance of the prepared materials to water. After immersion in water for 24 h, the compressive strength of all tested specimens of modified composites was higher than that of the reference composite. Quantitatively, the developed co-doped composites show mechanical parameters comparable to or even better than those of commonly used Portland cement-based materials while maintaining high environmental efficiency. This indicates their potential use as an environmentally friendly alternative to Portland cement-based products.",

            "text": "In the attempts to mitigate the carbon footprint originating from the construction and building industry, researchers turn to alternative composite materials that could possibly replace the commonly used Portland cement (PC). Among such materials, magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) and composites on its base have played a major role in past decades. The environmental advantage of MOC compared to PC is based on its ability to capture CO2 while forming carbonates [1]. It also manifests up to a 75% lower impact on resources [2]. Generally, MOC is formed in four main phases, of which Phase 5 is the most researched, mostly due to its simple synthesis, rapid hardening, and excellent mechanical properties [3\u20135]. Recent developments in the research on MOC mainly cover two approaches. The first one is the utilization of waste fillers and modifiers, and it is based on the ability of MOC to contain a large amount of aggregate while maintaining good mechanical performance. This approach further broadens the environmental sustainability of MOC-based materials, as it usually concerns wastes, which would otherwise need to be landfilled. Among the most used additives in this regard are various types of ash, waste wood, gypsum, sludge,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15214300 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 2 of 16\nand many others [6\u201311]. The second approach is based on the functional improvement in the properties of the composites based on MOC. For this purpose, the MOC matrix is modified using specific types of materials and additives. The most pronounced material properties in this regard are durability, water resistance, and mechanical performance. The studies concerning this approach usually result in highly functional materials based on MOC, which are applicable in variable conditions. Davras et al. studied the effect of mixing ratios during the production of MOC-based lightweight composites using hydrogen peroxide, potassium iodide, and methylcellulose [12]. The proposed ratio of the raw materials enabled the production of an ultra-lightweight MOC composite. Another type of lightweight, high-performance, MOC-based composite was proposed by Abd-El-Raoof et al. [13]. The basis of this experiment was the modification of the MOC matrix using polymers. Yan et al. studied the influence of multiple inorganic salts on hydration reactions occurring during MOC formation. This study demonstrated that such salts can promote the reaction rate, resulting in a higher amount present in MOC Phase 5 and a shortened curing time [14]. The studies focusing on the improvement in water resistance of MOC usually concern the application of functional additives, such as silica fume/nano-silica, hydroxyacetic acid, soluble phosphates, tannin, or carbon-based nanomaterials [15\u201319]. Recently, the introduction of carbon-based nanomaterials into construction composites has been a highly researched topic. The main contribution of such additives is their high potential to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the designed composite materials, especially in hydration behavior, strength, durability, and electrical and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, specific carbon-based nanomaterials can also provide specific functional properties and smart functions. All of these enhancements can be attributed to the unique properties and microstructure of these types of nanomaterials [20]. The influence of carbon-based nanomaterials on the hydration process is based on the facilitation of the pozzolanic reaction. This phenomenon is caused by the formation of nucleation sites where the cement hydrate phases sediment and grow [21\u201323]. The improvement in mechanical properties is based on the use of carbon-based nanomaterials as nano-reinforcement. The enhancement rate is relatively high, especially considering the generally low proportions of the nanomaterial used. The compressive, tensile, flexural, and fracture strengths, as well as the elastic moduli are among the properties improved [24,25]. The increase in durability is based on the refined pore structure and the reduced pore connectivity, which hinders the transport of aggressive ions and harmful agents. Furthermore, carbon-based nanomaterial-enhanced composites have been proven to have increased durability to chloride and sulfate ions, carbon dioxide molecules, and decalcification agents [26\u201329]. The improvement in thermal and electrical conductivity is based on the excellent thermal and electrical properties of the carbon-based nanomaterials themselves, which translate into the properties of the composite into which they are introduced [30\u201332]. The smart functions provided by the cement-based composites are mainly represented in self-sensing cement or environmental monitors for the detection of moisture or chloride content [33\u201336]. The enhancement of the composite material can also be further improved by using a combination or hybrid of multiple types of carbon-based nanomaterials. Li et al. studied the influence of the combination of graphene oxide sheets and single-walled carbon nanotubes. This research has shown the significance of the co-effect of these two types of carbonbased nanomaterials compared to their individual use. Furthermore, their influence on the particle size of the matrix crystals was assessed, as was their influence on the mechanical parameters [37]. Lu et al. studied the dispersion of such a combination of nanoadditives showing that graphene oxide can work as a surfactant for the homogenization of carbon nanotubes in a water suspension. This effect is based on increased electrostatic repulsion. As a result, more load is transferred from the matrix to the nano-reinforcement, resulting in enhanced compressive and flexural strength [38]. The combination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets was proven to be useful in the enhancement of fracture toughness and microhardness of the prepared composites. These effects were assigned to a decrease in the porosity of the designed composite and a possible bridging effect of the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 3 of 16\nnanoadditives, which resulted in the mitigation of crack propagation [39]. Yoo et al. have also shown the positive influence of combined carbon-based nanomaterials on the electrical properties of construction composites. This research has shown how the degradation of electrical properties can be decelerated using multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets, and nanofibers [40]. The most pronounced challenge in the introduction of carbon-based nanomaterials into construction composites is their homogenous dispersion in the cementitious matrix. It was previously shown that these additives can show their full potential only when their agglomeration is omitted [41,42], which is caused by the Van der Waals forces present in their atomic structure [43\u201346]. The formation of agglomerates or clumps can result in weak spots in the microstructure of the composite, causing increased susceptibility to defects [47,48]. To ensure proper homogenization of the carbon-based nanomaterials, both specific incorporation methods and agents are used. Among such methods, ultrasonication is the most commonly applied [49]. As dispersing agents, mostly polycarboxylate-based surfactants such as methylcellulose or anionic superplasticizers are used. Their effect is based on steric hindrance or static charge repulsion [50\u201352]. As an environmentally friendly surfactant, tannic acid was previously studied [53]. The basis of its function as a surfactant lies in its adsorption onto the carbon-based nanomaterial creating a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction between the aromatic rings of tannic acid and carbon atoms in the structure of the nanomaterial. This process increases the steric repulsion between the individual carbon nanomaterial particles, which makes them easier to disperse [54\u201356]. The introduction of tannic acid into construction composites was recently studied by Fang et al. [57]. The experiments conducted showed that tannic acid can reduce the total porosity of the mortar, especially concerning the capillary pores with a size between 10 and 50 nm. This results in improved mechanical performance. Furthermore, tannic acid was proven to improve the cohesion in the hardened cement-based product due to its increased ability to cross-link the hydration phases via various types of interactions, such as hydrogen and ionic bonding or hydrophobic interactions [58,59]. Moreover, as tannic acid is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, it can be considered somewhat eco-friendly and possibly renewable [60]. This study concerns the research of MOC-based composites enhanced by the combination of various types of carbon-based nanomaterials while being simultaneously doped with tannic acid. The use of tannic acid in construction composites based on PC was previously studied; however, this type of modifier was not introduced into the eco-friendly MOC-based matrix. The expected effect of the tannic acid on MOC-based composites doped with multiple types of carbon-based nanomaterials is dual: First, it is presumed to work as a functional additive for the improvement in the water resistance of the designed composites due to its positive effect on the microstructure, and especially the porosity and density of the MOC-based matrix. Second, it is applied as a surfactant for homogenous dispersion of the applied carbon-based nanoadditives. The proposed composites should therefore manifest high values of mechanical parameters, which are further enhanced by the carbon-based nanoadditives, as well as the high water resistance ensured by the tannic acid. Such composites can be useful in construction, especially in specifically shaped or prefabricated elements."

The designation of the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 4 of 16\nsamples was set as follows: REF for reference MOC sample with quartz sand filler; TA for MOC sample with quartz sand filler and tannic acid; 1D-TA for MOC sample with quartz sand filler, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and tannic acid; 2D-TA for MOC sample with quartz sand filler, graphene nanoplatelets, and tannic acid; and 1D-2D-TA for MOC sample with quartz sand filler, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplatelets, and tannic acid. Furthermore, a sample named PASTE consisting of only MOC with no filler was prepared. The fresh mixture properties of the specific samples are summarized in Table 1. The synthesis of the samples consisted of the preparation of an aqueous solution of MgCl2\u00b76H2O, in which the functional additives such as tannic acid, graphene nanoplatelets, and/or multi-walled carbon nanotubes were dispersed using a mechanical rotor-stator homogenizer Ultra-Turrax T-18 (IKA, K\u00f6nigswinter, Germany) for 5 min at a speed of 10,000 rpm. For the samples REF and PASTE, this step was not implemented. After that, the MgO powder, the homogenized MgCl2 solution/suspension of additives in MgCl2 solution, and the quartz sand filler were mixed together in a planetary type of mortar mixer. First, a low-speed regime (140 rpm) was used for 1 min, and then a high-speed regime (285 rpm) was used for 1 min. After that, the mixer bowl and paddle were scraped, and the mixing continued for 3 min at the high-speed regime. The prepared mixtures were then poured into prismatic molds with dimensions of 40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 160 mm3, where they were left for 24 h. After that, they were demolded and cured for 27 days at T = (23 \u00b1 2) \u25e6C and RH = (50 \u00b1 5)%.\nFigure 1.

This method provided both the elemental maps (see Figure 5), as well as the content of each present element in wt.% (see Table 2). Present in all of the samples were carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and chlorine. The quantity of each element corresponded sufficiently with the intended composition of the composite; however, it should be noted that the content obtained from EDS can vary as the analysis considers only a very small area of the fracture surface of the analyzed sample. The element patterns show the distribution of the quartz sand particles (maps of Si) and the MOC-based matrix (maps of Mg and Cl).

SEM micrographs of typical MOC Phase 5 microstructure studied on PASTE sample.\nThe macro- and microstructural parameters of the tested composites are introduced in Table 3. The data were obtained from samples cured for 28 days and represent the mean value from the measurement of five samples. The changes in bulk density, specific density, and porosity were minimal, and taking into account the expanded combined uncertainty of the test methods used, they can be considered insignificant or even negligible from a practical point of view. The minimal variation in the measured fundamental structural parameters shows evidence of the positive effect of tannic acid used as a surfactant in avoiding the agglomeration of nanoadditive particles, and thus their homogeneous distribution in the MOC matrix. Moreover, TA itself did not negatively affect the formation of the MOC structure. The assessment of the microstructural parameters by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) indicated that the porous structure was refined by the co-doping of the composite by the combination of 1D and 2D nanoparticles, which was also noticed based on the obtained macrostructural parameters. This was also observed in the composites 1D-TA and 2D-TA. The determined average pore size is a characteristic of medium capillaries, which affect mechanical strength and water permeability. The cumulative pore size distribution is shown in Figure 8. The shape of the pore size curves correspond well with the calculated microstructural parameters. Quantitatively, the measured porosity values are low, as demonstrated by both test techniques, i.e., the combination of helium pycnometry with the gravimetric determination of bulk density and MIP. In general, as capillary porosity affects mechanical strength and stiffness and reduces water ingress, the results obtained for nano-modified composites with TA can be considered promising.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 10 of 16Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 17\nFigure 7.

The composites exhibited high mechanical strength and stiffness. The flexural/compressive strength ratio was about 30%, which is much higher than that reported for PC concrete, whose flexural strength makes up approximately 10\u201320% of its compressive strength [66]. In general, the addition of tannic acid as well as nanoadditives slightly decreased the compressive strength and slightly increased the flexural strength of the prepared composites. The reduction in compressive strength was lesser for composites with TA and 2D nanoadditives compared to that for TA- or TA +1D-modified materials. The increase in the flexural strength is the result of three effects: (i) the high intrinsic tensile strength of the used nanoadditives themselves [67], (ii) the bridging effect of the 2D nanodopant, and (iii) the decrease in the volume of pores having a diameter of >0.1 \u00b5m. The last effect was not identified for the 2D-TA sample, but was very visible for the materials TA, 1D-TA, and 1D-2D-TA. Dynamic Young\u2019s modulus was almost identical for all samples.\nFig re 8. lative ore size istrib tion of the re are -based co posites.\nechanical parameters of the investigated composites are summarized in Figure 9.

The flexural/compressive strength ratio was about 30%, which is much higher than that reported for PC concrete, whose flexural strength m kes up approximately 10\u201320% of its compressive strength [66].

Water absorption values are presented in Figure 10. A slight decrease in water absorption was obtained for all enhanced composites; however, the major positive influence of the dopants was proved after water immersion for 24 h. Figure 9 shows that after water immersion, the highest compressive strength was obtained for the co-doped sample 1D-2D-TA, reaching 56.9 MPa, which is much higher than the 43.7 MPa obtained for the reference sample. The dramatic drop in the compressive strength of the reference material is the result of the decomposition of MOC Phase 5 into Mg(OH)2, which has much lower mechanical strength [68]. Within the water-induced structural changes, the mechanical interlocking of a stable needle-like crystallized Phase 5 is damaged, which is the reason for the loss of mechanical integrity. This mechanism is generally attributed to the pure water resistance of MOC-based products [69,70]. The softening coefficient was 51.4% for REF, 77.3% for TA, 69.8% for 1D-TA, 68.1% for 2D-TA, and 73.8% for 1D-2D-TA, confirming the significant influence of tannic acid addition on the compressive strength of all the composites. The increase in the softening coefficient is very promising for the practical use of the prepared materials. The improved durability is a result of the solidified structure of the composites, the effect of chelation between TA and Mg2+ ions, and their reinforcement against crack propagation induced by chemical changes in the precipitated MOC Phase 5. Since TA has a high molecular weight and is rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups, it forms a chelate with Mg2+ that forms a gel-like shell on the surface of precipitated products of MOC hydration [71]. This shell prevents contact of the MOC Phase 5 needles with water, thus improving water resistance. The effective reinforcement of the MOC matrix is attributed to the fact that the used nanoadditives can bridge the pores between sand particles and\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 12 of 16\nMOC Phase 5 crystals. Since the pores have an average pore size of about 0.05 \u00b5m, both the graphene particles and the multi-walled carbon nanotubes allow the reinforcement of these weak points in the composite microstructure. Moreover, in the case of water damage, they can partially withstand the generated tensile stress, thus at least partially eliminating the failure rate and loss of integrity.

The two nanomaterials used, graphene nanoplatelets and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and their combination positively influenced the water resistance in the hardened materials, as well as the flexural strength when incorporated into composite blends. All of the modified MOC-based composites manifested an increase in the softening coefficient, which is a crucial indicator of their durability against water-induced damage. The softening coefficient was improved by tannin and carbon nanodopants by 35.8%, 32.5%, and 43.6% in MOC composites with graphene, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and their combination, respectively. The highest increase in the softening coefficient was obtained for the samples TA (77.3%) and 1D-2D-TA (73.8%). These values are more than sufficient for the application of the designed composites in the field where PC-based composites are used. Regarding flexural strength, the improvements were 9.3%, 6.9%, and 0.8% for 1D-TA, 2D-TA, and 1D-2D-TA samples, respectively. The application of TA enabled the avoidance of the agglomeration of nanoparticles, and thus their homogeneous distribution in the MOC\u2013sand matrix, which is a crucial and problematic step in the introduction of nanoadditives in construction materials. Since MOC is generally considered to be more environmentally friendly due to its ability to sequester CO2 from the environment of the application, the developed composites effectively modified by nanoadditives can be a potential alternative to the Portland cement-based products that dominate the current construction market. In the prospective application of the researched composites, it is necessary to consider their excellent mechanical strength, high compressive/flexural strength ratio, and good resistance to excessive moisture.\nFig re 10. ater absorption of prepared samples after 24 h im ersion.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4300 13 of 16"
