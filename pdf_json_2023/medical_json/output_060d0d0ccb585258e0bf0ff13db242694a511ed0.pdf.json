            "text": "Breastfeeding is a public health issue important for achieving national and global health goals and improved health outcomes that is supported by the World Health Organization as a key strategy to improve public health [1]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants be exclusively fed human milk until 6 months old and then continue, adding complementary foods, for 2 years or more [1]. In this study, breastfeeding is defined as human milk feeding, whether directly at the breast/chest, previously expressed milk, or a combination thereof [2]. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as human milk feeding with no other liquid or solids [3]. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life provides important nutritional, physical, and psychosocial benefits to both infant and lactating parent [1, 3].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 1 / 19\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Scott AL, Lambert AW, Wang C-h, Johnson KV, Weiss J, Stankus T (2023) University campus breastfeeding, knowledge, and perceptions of support: An exploratory study.

Despite public breastfeeding being legal in every state, efforts to encourage acceptance have been necessary [5, 6]. However, public health policies have primarily focused on infant health benefits, with interventions centered around the healthcare system as opposed to home, workplace, or community environments, thus perpetuating stigma [6, 7]. Prior research demonstrates the influence of families, social networks, and community on infant feeding decisions, particularly around breastfeeding in public [5]. Even with health policy support for public breastfeeding and the desire to avoid parental anxiety and feelings of unease, researchers have found experiences of both nursing and expression outside the home to negatively affect breastfeeding rates and duration [5, 7]. Support of public breastfeeding is vital to breastfeeding success and can impact duration [7].\nMany lactating parents struggle to continue breastfeeding after entering the workforce and\ntherefore must choose between education/career and the wellness of self and child [8]. Returning to work or attending university courses and maintaining exclusive breastfeeding is a challenge due to barriers such as time, private space, and perception of breastfeeding in public. In prior studies, investigators attributed cessation of breastfeeding to the lactating parent\u2019s return to work [9\u201312]. University-employed parents reported insufficient break time and inadequate facilities for milk expression storage as barriers [13]. Many higher education campuses are investing in lactation support, but few studies have explored perspectives of the campus community [14].\nThe federal Break Time for Nursing Mothers law of 2010, covered by the Fair Labor Stan-\ndards Act, requires all employers with more than 50 employees to provide break time and a private, designated space other than a bathroom for expressing human milk [15, 16]. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act addresses reasonable break times and lactation spaces in the workplace but does not provide universal protection for university students who are not employed full-time by their institution [17]. On public university campuses, students are protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states that any school or university receiving federal funding cannot discriminate for any reason [18]. Prohibiting a lactating parent to breastfeed or express on campus would be deemed discrimination. Awareness of federal and state breastfeeding laws among university students has not been well studied; one of the few studies found that only 16% of students (undergraduate and graduate combined) at a large southeastern university were aware of laws supporting breastfeeding [18]. Only 3.6% of 139 colleges and universities examined in 2018/2019 had an official policy for lactating students [19].\nUniversities host faculty, staff, students, and visitors and are thus have unique needs in\nmeeting the challenges of breastfeeding support [19]. One basic need is that of a clean, private space in which to breastfeed. The National Institutes of Health\u2019s general guideline for lactation space recommends a minimum of six lactation expression stations per 1,000 female employees [15]. A study of campus lactation spaces found about half of universities offered at least one dedicated space with an average of 0.33 lactation spaces per 1,000 students [17]. Although research demonstrates benefits, such as cost savings and employee retention, to corporate employers because of workplace lactation support [20], the benefit to universities has not been established [14].\nWomen have had the legal right to breastfeed in public spaces since 2006 in Alabama [21]\nand 2007 in Arkansas [22]. Stigma and lack of adequate space remains a major barrier for lactating parents to breastfeed in public. The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, 2021 passed as an amendment to the omnibus spending package, will expand the requirement for employers to provide certain pumping accommodations for salaried, lactating employees, including pay during milk expression if the employee is also working [23]. The PUMP Act also makes it possible for workers to file a lawsuit seeking monetary compensation if the employer fails to\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 2 / 19\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\ncomply. Some states are considering legislation that mandates reasonable accommodations to express human milk or breastfeed on campus, with California being the first state to implement such a law [23]."

            "text": "The Socio-Ecological Model (SEM), developed from the early work of Urie Bronfenbrenner [24], guided this study. The Centers for Diseases and Prevention has adapted the SEM for application of health promotion [25]. The SEM can be utilized to determine attitudes, supports, and barriers provided by breastfeeding stakeholders [26, 27]. Health behaviors, such as breastfeeding, are affected by individual factors and the interaction between the individual and actors at interpersonal, community, organization, and policy levels [26]. Barriers to successful breastfeeding include low self-efficacy (individual), lack of peer support (interpersonal), community stigma (community), hospital formula samples (organizational), and lack of specificity in protective laws (policy) [26]. Exploring perspectives of breastfeeding parents pertaining to each level within the SEM is important to determine effective interventions.\nThis study incorporated each of the five ecological levels. For example, interpersonal factors\nwere incorporated through questions about fathers being left out during breastfeeding. Community factors asked whether breastfeeding is viewed as normal within a participant\u2019s culture, but predominantly focused on their immediate campus environment, given the aims of this study. Organizational and policy factors were explored through questions regarding awareness of current state policies and available lactation resources. The individual level focused on personal attitudes and beliefs. All of these levels must be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of potential future interventions to support breastfeeding in a campus environment."

The second part of the survey utilized, with author permission, the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitudes Scale (IIFAS), a validated tool to measure maternal attitudes toward infant feeding [31]. The IIFAS is a 17 question, 5-point Likert scale tool that can be easily administered to measure breastfeeding attitudes and is a strong predictor of breastfeeding behavior, including duration. A higher score on the IIFAS indicates a more positive attitude toward breastfeeding [31]. Additional questions were adapted from the Breastfeeding Behavior Questionnaire (BBQ) with five items based on the original situational question but modified in a non-scenario form using a 5-point Likert scale. The BBQ, developed by Libbus [32], examines attitudes and beliefs influencing infant-feeding choice among populations with varied demographics, with a lower score indicating an increased positive attitude and more accurate knowledge concerning breastfeeding. A lower score in the adapted BBQ also indicated a more positive attitude.\nThe Qualtrics survey consisted of five questions about attitudes toward breastfeeding in\npublic, 16 questions about perceptions of the benefits of breastfeeding, five knowledge questions about campus lactation spaces, and five questions regarding state and federal laws pertaining to breastfeeding. Questions regarding lactation spaces, laws, and personal attitude were generated by the primary investigator, based on existing state laws and university campus resources in place at the time of the study. Two questions about personal attitudes toward\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 4 / 19\nbreastfeeding, unrelated to public breastfeeding, and two knowledge questions about potential benefits of breastfeeding were also included.\nBoth attitude and perception subscales were 5-point Likert-type scales. Participants\nresponded to each item from 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree. To validate the psychometric property of the measures, reliability analysis to calculate internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha) was conducted. Cronbach\u2019s Alpha provides a value between 0 to 1 to indicate the relationship among items within a measure [33]. A value of .70 or above is considered good reliability and indicates the items within the same measure are measuring the same construct [34]. Results from reliability analysis indicated that Cronbach\u2019s Alpha was .80 for the attitude subscale and .82 for the perception subscale, indicating good reliability.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 5 / 19\nThe knowledge subscale contained questions where participants responded to each item by\nchoosing True, False, or Don\u2019t Know. The correct answers were coded as 1, while incorrect answers or Don\u2019t Know was coded as 0. The Cronbach\u2019s Alpha for knowledge about campus resources was .74 and .72 for knowledge about state and federal laws, indicating acceptable reliability.

Overall, UAR participating students were more likely to correctly answer these items in the Knowledge scale than AU student participants, including ideal beneficial feeding choice and economic healthcare benefits {Tables 10 & 11}. The results did not differ from the comparison of UAR and AU female only participants {Tables 10 & 11}."

            "text": "Knowledge of resources, laws, and current breastfeeding attitudes\nParents stop breastfeeding for a multitude of reasons, including lack of support at home, community, and work [11]. Findings from this study indicate support for breastfeeding initiatives within both the UAR and AU university communities. However, the findings suggest that there is a need for additional education with both students and employees concerning breastfeeding resources and laws. Specifically, there is a knowledge deficit regarding national and state laws protecting the right to breastfeed in public, such as the FLSA, PPACA, and applicable state laws. With the passage of the PUMP Act, it is possible awareness of breastfeeding protection could be accelerated. This was consistent among all participants and when comparing both universities. Similarly, fewer than half of the participants correctly answered questions about breastfeeding rights, the most beneficial feeding choice, and the economic benefits of breastfeeding.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 11 / 19\nCampus resources, including designated lactation space, exist at both study sites. However, participants, particularly students, lacked knowledge of these resources. Lack of knowledge of breastfeeding and breastfeeding policy, paired with a significant lack of breastfeeding resources, creates an overall deficit in campus support for breastfeeding among the campus community. Despite both study sites offering breastfeeding information, private lactation spaces in a variety of campus buildings, and additional resources, such as lactation spaces at athletic events, awareness of these resources was inadequate. In determining the cause of this lack of awareness, consideration must be given to a lack of signage or publicizing of breastfeeding rooms. Furthermore, not all buildings offer an easily accessible location. A public space to support community breastfeeding should not be the best-kept secret on campus, nor should it be information provided only on a need-to-know basis.\nOverall, participants had a positive attitude towards breastfeeding. Overwhelmingly, partic-\nipants indicated support for breastfeeding rights in public spaces, with about 90% of participants agreeing that there is an ethical right to breastfeed in public. Even with limited knowledge of the law, participants indicated that this right extends to public spaces on college\nTable 6.

Providing education for university students and staff is key to creating a better understanding of current laws and regulations concerning breastfeeding in public.\nWhile there were positive attitudes towards public breastfeeding reported at both campuses,\nthe survey response rate was significantly higher at AU. The high participation at AU could indicate a population interested in community breastfeeding education and additional resources. Both universities likely had high participation from nursing students since social media was utilized from student nursing associations who posted the survey link. This does not explain the difference in UAR participants having higher knowledge scores, as the Bachelor of Science in nursing curriculum does not differ significantly. Lastly, the survey was primarily taken by undergraduate students who identified as white and female. The larger number of male participants at AU did not impact the findings.\nAs expected, employees reported having more children and were older than the student\npopulation. Employees with children likely have additional exposure to community resources and breastfeeding. This additional exposure may have supported an increase in knowledge and positive attitudes towards community breastfeeding. UAR reported a slightly higher percentage of participants having children compared to AU, perhaps influencing higher knowledge scores and more positive attitudes regarding public breastfeeding. Students indicated less concern for and knowledge of economics, possibly due to lack of experience with costs associated with caring for children.\nConcerning knowledge of breastfeeding resources and attitudes within campus communi-\nties, continued inquiry is needed to empower breastfeeding initiatives and create an environment supportive of continued breastfeeding. Advocacy for breastfeeding requires understanding the specific needs of a community and providing the education and resources required to support and encourage an inclusive community. Changing breastfeeding attitudes and perceptions towards normalization requires dedication by breastfeeding advocates and community cooperation. Continued advocacy for and promotion of easily accessible lactation spaces on campus, along with knowledge of applicable breastfeeding laws, is needed and vital to ensure the normalization of breastfeeding in public, which, in turn, will positively impact\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 13 / 19\nbreastfeeding outcomes. This study serves as an indication of current breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes among those on university campuses in the United States\u2019 southeast/south central regions and can guide breastfeeding education and implementation of future initiatives."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "Limitations potentially affecting study outcomes include a homogeneous participant group and lack of control over the sample composition. The target populations were students and employees, but the eligibility criteria were diminished by an unintended bias. The title of the study indicating the topic was breastfeeding could have led potential male participates to assume the study was for females only. This may be due to the nature of the study being inherently more appealing to women than men or those having a stronger opinion on the subject. This limitation poses a high likelihood for selection bias and inadvertently could have greatly decreased male participation. This bias could reduce the validity of the results, targeted at the college campus population. Another limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design: the data reflects one point in time at the selected study locations.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 14 / 19\nmatter. Both students and employees could have reacted to the desire to be positive and support breastfeeding. There were no delimitations; therefore, knowledge or experience with breastfeeding was not considered in the results. The majority of participants were white females, reflecting underrepresentation of diverse populations, making generalizability of the results unreliable for campus populations that differ significantly in ethnicity or diversity. The findings from this study, conducted in the southern United States, may not be generalizable to other university campuses, especially those of different size and geographical location. The survey was also only offered in English, limiting responses from non-English speaking participants.\nAlthough the study began during the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey link was still live\nduring a semester when students were receiving some face-to-face instruction. The timing of the survey is a limitation, however, and warrants further study. Disruption in campus attendance is especially concerning regarding awareness of campus resources, despite information being available online at both universities.\nFuture studies should include university populations with less homogeneous demographic composition and in various international locations. Additionally, delineation between pumping/expressing milk versus direct breastfeeding in public should be considered."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "While there is general awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, the recommendation to exclusively breastfeeding for 6 months is not universally known among the college population. There is also a knowledge deficit regarding national and state laws protecting the right to breastfeed in public and the beneficial impact of breastfeeding, including its economic benefit. Although there appears to be a positive attitude toward breastfeeding in public, closer analysis revealed a need for normalization and awareness of legal rights of breastfeeding in public, which aligns with recent studies [4, 5, 8]. Normalization of breastfeeding includes both positive\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 15 / 19\nattitudes regarding ethical and legal rights. Although the majority of participants responded positively to the ethical right to breastfeed in public, only about 60% responded positively to the legal right. Campus employees have greater knowledge of the economic cost of not breastfeeding and knowledge of breastfeeding benefits, possibly related to more exposure to breastfeeding personally or in the community. Results of this study support the need for initiatives to promote awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding and continued efforts to eliminate lack of support of breastfeeding in public spaces. Changes to campus policies and support from campus decision makers could promote an environment of inclusion and encourage the university community to utilize campus breastfeeding resources. Including a written policy for lactating students in the student handbook would be an important beginning for most universities, as few have an official policy [3]. Lactation space should be easily accessible, ideally within 10 minutes, and be Americans with Disabilities Act compliant. Campus health centers and community agencies serving those of childbearing age can conduct activities and trainings relating to breastfeeding, along with providing state lactation laws in the workplace. Introductory classes, such as University 101 or Health Science classes should include information on campus\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285008 May 26, 2023 16 / 19\nlactation policies. Social media campaigns for lactation education must involve the entire campus community. The University of Northern Colorado has developed a toolkit for establishing lactation support on University and College campuses, including funding sources [35]. Utilization of this toolkit or other resources could serve in developing campus breastfeeding initiatives. Supporting the breastfeeding family contributes to better workforce production, increases student and employee retention rates, and raises campus morale. Inclusive campus environments are increasingly important and improving breastfeeding policy and support should involve key stakeholders, especially the lactating family."
