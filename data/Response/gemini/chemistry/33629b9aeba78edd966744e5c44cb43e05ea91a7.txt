1. **Investigate the effect of different oxidants on the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes.** The paper only investigates the use of H2O2 and Na2S2O8 as oxidants, but there are many other potential oxidants that could be used. Exploring the effects of different oxidants would help to identify the most effective and efficient oxidant for this application.
2. **Study the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes.** The paper proposes a mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes, but this mechanism is not fully understood. Further research is needed to investigate the details of this mechanism, including the role of different reactive species and the effect of different reaction conditions.
3. **Develop new photocatalytic materials for the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes.** The paper uses g-C3N4 as the photocatalytic material, but there are many other potential photocatalytic materials that could be used. Developing new photocatalytic materials with higher activity and selectivity would help to improve the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation process.
4. **Apply the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes to real-world applications.** The paper demonstrates the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes in the laboratory, but it is not clear how this technology can be applied to real-world applications. Further research is needed to develop practical applications for this technology, such as the treatment of wastewater or the removal of dyes from textiles.
5. **Investigate the environmental impact of the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes.** The paper does not discuss the environmental impact of the photocatalytic degradation of anionic and cationic dyes. Further research is needed to assess the potential environmental risks associated with this technology, such as the formation of harmful byproducts or the release of toxic chemicals.
