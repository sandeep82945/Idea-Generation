INTRODUCTION\nStructural disorders at the microscopic level generally exist in materials such as semiconductors and lightharvesting systems. These disorders may substantially alter the electronic structure of the system and ulteriorly influence the transport properties of the carriers (electron, hole, or exciton) therein.\nAccording to the time scale of the influence, the disorders can be categorized into two types. The first type called the static disorder comes from obvious local structural imperfections caused by impurities, vacancies, irregular stacking arrangements, structural mismatching, etc., and is reflected in the electronic state energies and electronic couplings as certain static randomness over a long timescale. The second type manifests time-evolving changes in the electronic structure at a relatively short timescale (from femtoseconds to picoseconds), and thereby is referred to as the dynamic disorder. The dynamic one, which originates from the continuous motion of the nuclei, is also recognized as the electronphonon interactions (or exciton-phonon interactions for the excitation energy transfer process).\nThe transport properties in many disordered semiconductors and light-harvesting systems often exhibit unexpected and sometimes exhilarating behaviors. For instance, recent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic experiments on the pigment-protein complexes of photosynthetic organisms1\u20137 and conjugated polymers8 have revealed long-lasting oscillating cross peaks at both cryogenic and physiological temperatures, implying that quantum coherence may play a significant role in the excitation energy transfer process. These observations challenge the traditional view that the exciton dynamics in such disordered systems should follow incoherent hopping motion. As an another example, it has been known for a long time that the carrier mobilities in some organic semiconductors decline as the temperature arises,\n\u2217 E-mail: yizhao@xmu.edu.cn\nexhibiting a typical band-like behavior9\u201312. However, the magnitude of these mobilities is close to the Mott-IoffeRegel limit, which indicates a strong localization nature of the charge carrier and contradicts the delocalized band picture13. Similar band-type tendency of the mobility has also been found in the titanium dioxide of different crystallographic forms14\u201319, but several experimental20,21 and theoretical22\u201324 evidences have shown that the charge carrier may form localized small polarons.\nOver the decades, great efforts have been devoted to uncover these fascinating mysteries, which has also boosted the development of many insightful theoretical models and powerful numerical approaches. In the field of quantum biology, numerically exact approaches such as the hierarchical equation of motion25\u201327 and iterative quasi-adiabatic path integral28,29 have been frequently applied to the exciton dynamics in small-sized systems like the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. For systems as large as the chlorosome from green sulfur bacteria (containing hundreds of thousands of bacteriochlorophylls), impressive studies based on approximate methods like the stochastic Schro\u0308dinger equation have been carried out30\u201334. Nevertheless, the dynamical methods for largesized systems still have remained unsatisfactory. For example, owing to the use of classical random forces, the stochastic Schro\u0308dinger equation does not satisfy the detailed balance and may not be able to give a correct description for the quantum coherence.\nTo explain the peculiar behaviour of the carrier mobility in organic semiconductors, various models and computational schemes have been proposed, which include but not limited to the hopping model with the nuclear tunneling effect35, polaron theory36,37, mixed quantum-classical method38 and transient localization scenario39\u201342 based on the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model, and real-time quantum dynamic simulations43\u201348. These pioneering works have greatly promoted our understanding toward the localization-delocalization conflict of the charge carrier. Nevertheless, each of them has its own limitations. For example, the hopping model completely neglects the coherence; the mixed quantum-classical method and transient localization scenario only consider the nonlocal ar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n12 48\n0v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n8 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 electron-phonon interactions caused by low-frequency intermolecular vibrations; accurate quantum dynamic simulations are only affordable for relatively small-sized systems and are often limited by the finite-size effect. In realistic organic semiconductors, the transport mechanism is involved in multiple factors, such as the highfrequency intramolecular and low-frequency intermolecular vibrations, local and nonlocal electron-phonon interactions, static disorder, and complicated transport paths. The transport mechanism may also be relevant to several electronic energy bands if the unit cell contains multiple components. Up to now, a general consensus over the transport mechanism in organic semiconductors is yet to be achieved. As for the transport properties of inorganic semiconductors, the semiclassical Boltzmann equation is generally used in theoretical studies. However, it is known that many metallic oxides such as the titanium dioxide are characterized by strong Fro\u0308hlich-type electron-phonon interactions49\u201354. This is inconsistent with the assumption of the Boltzmann equation that the electron-phonon interactions can be regarded as perturbation. Recently, there have been attempts to apply the hopping model to titanium dioxides of different crystallographic forms, but the calculated mobilities are usually several orders of magnitude less than the experimental one55,56.\nThe aforementioned difficulties arise from the fact that various complex interactions (dynamic and static disorders, electronic couplings, etc.) in many disordered materials are at a similar magnitude, precluding a straightforward perturbation treatment for the real-time dynamic simulations. By contrast, accurate quantum simulations in imaginary time are much easier to carry out due to the absence of the dynamical sign problem. According to the Matsubara formalism and linear response theory57, transport properties like the optical conductivity and one-particle spectral function can be extracted from the imaginary time propagator via analytic continuation.\nIn the absence of the dynamical sign problem, the Monte Carlo technique is very suited for the calculations of physical quantities in imaginary time. Particularly, the advanced diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method has gained great success in the bosonic lattice models58,59, polaron problems60\u201369 and quantum impurity models70 during the past two decades. The basic principle of DQMC is to expand the partition function into the summation of Feynman diagrams of arbitrary order and perform importance samplings over all of the diagrams. Despite the generality of the pivotal principle, the concrete framework and numerical realization of DQMC differ from model to model. In the polaron problems, works on the Holstein model65,66, Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model64,67 and Fro\u0308hlich model61\u201363,69 have been reported. It is worth mentioning that by combining DQMC with numerical analytic continuation, the mobility of the Holstein polaron has been obtained for a very broad parameter regime from low to high temperatures and from weak to strong electron-phonon interactions66. Powerful as it is, the DQMC has been only applied to simple theoretical models where the local and nonlocal electron-phonon interactions are not simultaneously presented, and where only single phonon branch is considered. Furthermore, the static disorder has not yet been incorporated into the existing DQMC framework in the literatures.\nBecause of the generality of the basic idea, it is expected that under proper formulation and implementation, DQMC can in principle apply to realistic materials with multifarious intricate factors beyond the model systems. In this work, we will provide a new formulation of DQMC toward the calculation of transport properties in realistic disordered semiconductors and lightharvesting materials that simultaneously involve multiple electronic dispersions, high-frequency optical and lowfrequency acoustic vibrations, and different kinds of dynamic and static disorders in a unified and numerically exact way. As will be seen, the extension for the dynamic disorder is straightforward, but the incorporation of the static disorder is much more involved.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, detailed formulation is presented to arrive at a new DQMC approach. In Sec. III, the performance of the proposed approach in different parameter regimes are systematically examined. In Sec. IV, further discussion of the this approach and concluding remarks are given. Throughout the paper, we set ~ = kB = 1 for the sake of convenience."

            "text": "For the sake of convenience, here we take the carrier transport in semiconductors as an example, but the whole DQMC methodology can also be applied to the excitation energy transfer process occurring in regularly arranged light-harvesting materials such as the chlorosomes.\nII.1.1. Hamiltonian in reciprocal space\nConsider a three-dimensional semiconductor material with the periodic boundary condition. In the absence of disorder in the morphology, the semiconductor is in the crystal form and is translational symmetric. Under this situation, the electronic structure and phonon spectrum\n3 are well-described by the band theory. By including various extrinsic disordered factors such as impurities, vacancies and irregular stacking arrangements, the translational symmetry is broken and the electronic energy band is interrupted. With this in mind, it is convenient to divide the total Hamiltonian of the disordered semiconductor into four parts as\nH\u0302 = H\u0302el + H\u0302ph + H\u0302el\u2212ph + H\u0302sd, (1)\nwhere H\u0302el, H\u0302ph and H\u0302el\u2212ph are the primitive electronic Hamiltonian, phonon Hamiltonian and electron-phonon interactions, respectively, and H\u0302sd contains the static disorder in electronic state energies and electronic couplings induced by extrinsic disordered factors. Technically speaking, H\u0302sd is also one part of the electronic Hamiltonian. We assume that the crystal lattice parameters along the directions of the three crystal axes are a, b, and c, respectively, and the total number of unit cells within the semiconductor is Na \u00d7Nb \u00d7Nc. For the sake of convenience, we set Na = Nb = Nc = N hereafter, but the DQMC formalism being introduced can be straightforwardly extended to situations where the three integers are different.\nOwing to the translational symmetry in the absence of the static disorder, H\u0302el and H\u0302ph are both diagonal in reciprocal space (also called the Bloch representation). Concretely speaking, the electronic Hamiltonian is given by\nH\u0302el = \u2211 nk nkc\u0302 \u2020 nkc\u0302nk. (2)\nHere, n corresponds to the nth energy band. The threedimensional vector k = (2\u03c0naaN , 2\u03c0nb bN , 2\u03c0nc cN ) is the crystal momentum of the electron, where the possible values of na, nb and nc are \u2212N\u221212 ,\u2212 N\u22123 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N\u22121 2 when N is odd and \u2212N\u221222 ,\u2212 N\u22124 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N 2 when N is even. nk is the energy of the Bloch orbital at the nth energy band with crystal momentum k, and c\u0302\u2020nk and c\u0302nk are the corresponding electron creation and annihilation operators, respectively. Note that nk is symmetric with respect to the \u0393 point in the Brillouin zone, nk = n,\u2212k.\nThe phonon Hamiltonian is written as\nH\u0302ph = \u2211 \u03bdq \u03c9\u03bdq ( b\u0302\u2020\u03bdqb\u0302\u03bdq + 1 2 ) . (3)\nHere, \u03bd represents the \u03bdth phonon branch. q is the crystal momentum of the phonon, and its possible value is identical to that of k. \u03c9\u03bdq is the frequency of the phonon at the \u03bdth branch with crystal momentum q, and b\u0302\u2020\u03bdq and b\u0302\u03bdq are the corresponding phonon creation and annihilation operators, respectively. The phonon frequency is also symmetric with respect to the \u0393 point, \u03c9\u03bdq = \u03c9\u03bd,\u2212q.\nThe electron-phonon interaction has the following form H\u0302el\u2212ph = \u2211 \u03bdq A\u0302\u2020\u03bdq \u2297 B\u0302\u03bdq (4)\nwith\nA\u0302\u2020\u03bdq = N \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk gnmkq\u03bd c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk (5)\nand\nB\u0302\u03bdq = b\u0302\u03bdq + b\u0302 \u2020 \u03bd,\u2212q, (6)\nwhere the complex number gnmkq\u03bd is the electronphonon interaction parameter obeying (gnmkq\u03bd)\n\u2217 = gmn,k+q,\u2212q,\u03bd . Eq. (4) indicates that for the electronic crystal momentum to be increased by q, one must annihilate (create) a phonon with the same (opposite) crystal momentum. Thereby, the electron-phonon interactions conserve the total crystal momentum, which is a natural result of the translational symmetry. Furthermore, it is easy to prove that A\u0302\u2020\u03bd,\u2212q = A\u0302\u03bdq and B\u0302\u03bd,\u2212q = B\u0302 \u2020 \u03bdq. Being the given general form, the local and nonlocal electronphonon interactions are included in Eq. (4) on an equal footing71.\nEqs. (2)-(4) are widely used in the literatures for the description of the carrier dynamics in periodic systems. To be able to describe extrinsic disordered factors within the same theoretical framework, we adopt the static disorder Hamiltonian with the following form\nH\u0302sd = \u2211 \u00b5q D\u00b5qC\u0302 \u2020 \u00b5q (7)\nwith\nC\u0302\u2020\u00b5q = N \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk fnmkq\u00b5c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk. (8)\nHere, resembling the concept of the phonon spectrum, we have introduced two indexes \u00b5 and q to distinguish different random variables of the static disorder (termed as the disorder variables in the following), where \u00b5 represents the \u00b5th static disorder branch (that is, the \u00b5th type of static disorder), and q is a three-dimensional vector, the physical meaning of which is identical to that of the phonon crystal momentum. D\u00b5q is a standard complex Gaussian random variable obeying (D\u00b5q) \u2217 = D\u00b5,\u2212q,\nM{D\u00b5q} = 0, M{D\u00b5qD\u00b5\u2032q\u2032} = \u03b4\u00b5\u00b5\u2032\u03b4q,\u2212q\u2032 ,\n(9)\nwhere M{\u00b7} represents to take the average. Such kind of random variables can be generated via D\u00b5q = 1\u221a 2 (x\u00b5q + iy\u00b5q),\nD\u00b5,\u2212q = 1\u221a 2\n(x\u00b5q \u2212 iy\u00b5q), (10)\nwhere x\u00b5q and y\u00b5q are independent real Gaussian variables obeyingM{x\u00b5qx\u00b5\u2032q\u2032} =M{y\u00b5qy\u00b5\u2032q\u2032} = \u03b4\u00b5\u00b5\u2032\u03b4q,q\u2032 , and their index q is restricted to half of the first Brillouin zone. fnmkq\u00b5 is a deterministic complex number and has the property (fnmkq\u00b5)\n\u2217 = fmn,k+q,\u2212q,\u00b5. Apparently, Eq. (7) is in a form very different from that of the static disorder Hamiltonian commonly adopted in the literatures. In Sec. II.1.2, we will give a detailed derivation of this expression and prove that any kinds of Gaussian static disorder in real space can be transformed into Eq. (7) if only the covariance of the static disorder is translational symmetric. Thereby, Eqs. (7)-(9) can be regarded as the general expressions of the Gaussian static disorder in reciprocal space. Note that the random nature of the static disorder is condensed into D\u00b5q, whereas the magnitude and correlation of the static disorder is fully characterized by fnmkq\u00b5. Comparing Eqs. (7)-(8)\n4 with Eqs. (4)-(5), it is obvious that the static disorder has a very similar form to the electron-phonon interaction in reciprocal space. Concretely, fnmkq\u00b5 and D\u00b5q correspond to the electron-phonon interaction parameter gnmkq\u03bd and the phonon coordinate B\u0302\u03bdq, respectively. As such, one may consider D\u00b5q as the \u201ccoordinate\u201d of the static disorder, and regard fnmkq\u00b5 as the static disorder parameters. It is worth noting that different from B\u0302\u03bdq, D\u00b5q is a complex random variable instead of an operator.\nMany transport properties such as the carrier mobility, group velocity and mean free path are tightly relevant to the current operator J\u0302, which is a three-dimensional vector, J\u0302 \u2261 (J\u0302a, J\u0302b, J\u0302c). The current operator is defined as the time derivative of the polarization operator P, J\u0302 = i[H\u0302, P\u0302]. For the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) being considered here, it can be decomposed into three components, J\u0302 = J\u0302el + J\u0302el\u2212ph + J\u0302sd, where J\u0302el, J\u0302el\u2212ph, and J\u0302sd originate from the electronic kinetic energy, the electronphonon interactions, and the static disorder, respectively. In reciprocal space, J\u0302el is given by\nJ\u0302el = e \u2211 nm \u2211 k vnmkc\u0302 \u2020 nkc\u0302mk, (11)\nwhere e is the charge of the electron, and the vector vnmk \u2261 (vanmk, vbnmk, vcnmk) is the element of the velocity matrix associated with crystal momentum k. For the diagonal element, vnnk = \u2207k nk. One can see from Eq. (11) that J\u0302el is partially diagonal in reciprocal space in the sense that there is no cross terms between orbitals with different crystal momentums.\nThe component from the electron-phonon interactions reads\nJ\u0302el\u2212ph = eN \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk \u2211 \u03bdq unmkq\u03bd c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk \u2297 B\u0302\u03bdq, (12)\nwhere unmkq\u03bd \u2261 (uanmkq\u03bd , ubnmkq\u03bd , ucnmkq\u03bd) is also a vector. Comparing Eq. (12) with Eqs. (4)-(6), one can find\nthat J\u0302el\u2212ph has a very similar form to H\u0302el\u2212ph. Actually, just like the connection between vnnk and nk, a simple relationship unnkq\u03bd = \u2207kgnnkq\u03bd approximately holds true if there is only one electronic band. In Appendix A, we briefly discuss the origin of Eq. (12), and suggest a first-principles calculation scheme of unnkq\u03bd on the basis of the Wannier function.\nLikewise, the last component originating from the static disorder is given by\nJ\u0302sd = eN \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk \u2211 \u00b5q u\u0303nmkq\u00b5D\u00b5qc\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk, (13)\nwhere u\u0303nmkq\u00b5 \u2261 (u\u0303anmkq\u00b5, u\u0303bnmkq\u00b5, u\u0303cnmkq\u00b5) is a threedimensional vector. Appendix B provides a brief derivation of Eq. (13) and discusses the relation between u\u0303nmkq\u00b5 and fnmkq\u00b5.\nIn Sec. III, the current operator will be involved in the calculations of the imaginary time and imaginary frequency current autocorrelation functions defined as\nG\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c4) = 1 Z Tr { e\u03c4H\u0302 J\u0302\u03b1e \u2212\u03c4H\u0302 J\u0302\u03b2e \u2212\u03b2H\u0302 } (14)\nand\nG\u0303\u03b1\u03b2(i\u03c9n) = \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c4ei\u03c9n\u03c4G\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c4), (15)\nrespectively, where \u03c9n = 2\u03c0nT is the Matsubara frequency, and n is a nonnegative integer. From G\u03b1\u03b1(\u03c4) or G\u0303\u03b1\u03b1(i\u03c9n), the optical conductivity and the mobility along the \u03b1 direction can be extracted via numerical analytic continuation.\nII.1.2. Derivation of the reciprocal-space static disorder\nIn this subsection, we provide a derivation of Eqs. (7)- (8) from its real-space correspondence. To this end, we first need to adopt a specific real-space representation. It is known that for the electronic degrees of freedom, the definition of real space is not unique, and one may choose a proper localized basis set according to the system under investigation. For instance, the frontier molecular orbitals of the monomers are usually used as the basis set for organic materials, whereas for inorganic materials the maximally localized Wannier orbitals are frequently adopted72,73.\nDespite the non-unique definition of such a representation, the real-space localized orbitals can be generally expressed as the linear combinations of the Bloch orbitals as  c\u0302\u2020n\u0304R = N \u2212 32 \u2211 nk e\u2212ik\u00b7R(U\u0302k)nn\u0304c\u0302 \u2020 nk,\nc\u0302n\u0304R = N \u2212 32 \u2211 nk eik\u00b7R(U\u0302\u2020k)n\u0304nc\u0302nk, (16)\nwhere R = (maa,mbb,mcc) with ma,mb,mc = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N is a lattice vector, c\u0302\u2020n\u0304R and c\u0302n\u0304R are the creation and annihilation operators of the n\u0304th localized orbitals in the unit cell centered at R, and U\u0302k is the unitary transformation operator associated with k. The short line over n\u0304 is used to remind that n\u0304 is a real-space index.\nThe static disorder in real space can be generally written as\nH\u0302sd = \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304R\u0304e \u2211 R \u03b3n\u0304m\u0304R\u0304eR ( c\u0302\u2020n\u0304Rc\u0302m\u0304,R+R\u0304e + c\u0302 \u2020 m\u0304,R+R\u0304e c\u0302n\u0304R ) . (17) Here, R\u0304e is a lattice vector. \u03b3n\u0304m\u0304R\u0304eR is a real random variable obeying certain statistical properties. When n\u0304 = m\u0304 and R\u0304e = 0, \u03b3n\u0304m\u0304R\u0304eR corresponds to the static disorder in the orbital energy (local static disorder), otherwise it corresponds to that in the electronic coupling (nonlocal static disorder). To simplify the notation, we introduce a compact index \u00b5\u0304 \u2261 (n\u0304, m\u0304, R\u0304e) and the corresponding summation \u2211 \u00b5\u0304 \u2261 \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304R\u0304e\n. Note that the short bars over these indexes are used to remind that they are real-space indexes. As such, Eq. (17) is simplified to\nH\u0302sd = \u2211 \u00b5\u0304 \u2211 R \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R ( c\u0302\u2020n\u0304Rc\u0302m\u0304,R+R\u0304e + c\u0302 \u2020 m\u0304,R+R\u0304e c\u0302n\u0304R ) . (18)\nUp to now, the statistical properties of the static disorder have not been given yet. We further assume that \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R is a Gaussian random variable with a zero average, and it satisfies the following statistical property\nM{\u03b3\u00b5\u0304R\u03b3\u00b5\u0304\u2032,R+\u2206R} = \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R, (19)\nwhere \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R is the covariance of the static disorder, which determines the correlation between different disorder variables \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R. In traditional theoretical studies,\n5 it is often assumed that different disorder variables are independent with each other. However, in realistic materials, there may be nonnegligible correlations between disorder variables that are close in space location. It is worth noting that \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R is independent of R because we have assumed that the covariance of the static disorder is translational symmetric. This is in consistent with the fact that the morphological disorders in different locations of a realistic semiconductor usually exhibit similar statistical properties at a macroscopic level.\nSince the static disorder technically is part of the electronic Hamiltonian, one can directly transform Eq. (18) into reciprocal space via Eq. (16). Before doing so, we first show how to disentangle different disorder variables \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R and acquire the \u201ceigenstates\u201d of the static disorder by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. To this end, we introduce a new set of random variables\n\u03b3\u00b5\u0304q = N \u2212 32 \u2211 R e\u2212iq\u00b7R\u03b3\u00b5\u0304R. (20)\nUsing the property N\u22123 \u2211\nR e \u2212i(q+q\u2032)\u00b7R = \u03b4q,\u2212q\u2032 and in-\nvoking Eq. (19), it is easy to prove that the new random variables satisfy the following statistical property\nM{\u03b3\u00b5\u0304q\u03b3\u00b5\u0304\u2032q\u2032} = \u03b4q,\u2212q\u2032(\u0393\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032 , (21)\nwhere the matrix element (\u0393\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032 = \u2211 \u2206R e iq\u00b7\u2206R\u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R. It is seen that \u03b3\u00b5\u0304q with different crystal momentum q are independent with each other. Furthermore, from Eq. (19), we have \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R = \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u00b5\u0304,\u2212\u2206R. Using this property, it is easy to prove that (\u0393\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032 = (\u0393\u0302q) \u2217 \u00b5\u0304\u2032\u00b5\u0304. Therefore, \u0393\u0302q is hermitian, and there exists a unitary matrix \u03a6\u0302q that can diagonalize \u0393\u0302q, \u03a6\u0302q\u0393\u0302q\u03a6\u0302 \u2020 q = \u0393\u0303q, where\n(\u0393\u0303q)\u00b5\u00b5\u2032 = \u03b4\u00b5\u00b5\u2032\u03bb\u00b5q. Note that we have removed the short bar over the index \u00b5\u0304 to remind that the covariance matrix is diagonal in this new representation. The nonnegative definiteness of the covariance matrix guarantees that \u03bb\u00b5q \u2265 0. In addition, it can also be proved that \u03a6\u0302T\u2212q = \u03a6\u0302q = \u03a6\u0302 \u2020 q, \u03bb\u00b5q = \u03bb\u00b5,\u2212q.\nUtilizing the above unitary matrix, we can further define a new set of random variables, \u03b3\u0303\u00b5q = \u2211 \u00b5\u0304(\u03a6\u0302q)\u00b5\u00b5\u0304\u03b3\u00b5\u0304q. It is straightforward to show that \u03b3\u0303\u2217\u00b5q = \u03b3\u0303\u00b5,\u2212q and M{\u03b3\u0303\u00b5q\u03b3\u0303\u00b5\u2032q\u2032} = \u03b4\u00b5\u00b5\u2032\u03b4q,\u2212q\u2032\u03bb\u00b5q. Thereby, \u03b3\u0303\u00b5q with different indexes are completely independent with other, and they constitute the spectrum of the static disorder. To go further, we set \u03b3\u0303\u00b5q = \u221a \u03bb\u00b5qD\u00b5q, where D\u00b5q are complex Gaussian random variables obeying Eq. (9). Then, starting from \u03b3\u0303\u00b5q, and inversely applying all of the above transformations, we obtain\n\u03b3\u00b5\u0304R = N \u2212 32 \u2211 q eiq\u00b7R \u2211 \u00b5 (\u03a6\u0302\u2020q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u03b3\u0303\u00b5q\n= N\u2212 3 2 \u2211 q eiq\u00b7R \u2211 \u00b5 (\u03a6\u0302\u2020q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5 \u221a \u03bb\u00b5qD\u00b5q.\n(22)\nEq. (22) exhibits the relation between D\u00b5q and the realspace disorder variable \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R. On the other hand, we can also start from Eq. (22) and use Eq. (9) to derive the sta-\ntistical properties of \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R M{\u03b3\u00b5\u0304R\u03b3\u00b5\u0304\u2032,R+\u2206R} = N\u22123 \u2211 q e\u2212iq\u00b7\u2206R(\u03a6\u0302\u2020q\u0393\u0303q\u03a6\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\n= N\u22123 \u2211 q e\u2212iq\u00b7\u2206R(\u0393\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\n= \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R,\n(23)\nwhere in the last equality we have used the transformation between (\u0393\u0302q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032 and \u0393\u00b5\u0304\u00b5\u0304\u2032\u2206R.\nSo far, we have successfully disentangle different disorder variables \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R. Substituting Eq. (16) and Eq. (22) into Eq. (18), we finally arrive at Eqs. (7)-(8) with\nfnmkq\u00b5 = \u221a \u03bb\u00b5q \u2211 \u00b5\u0304 (\u03a6\u0302\u2020q)\u00b5\u0304\u00b5 [ eik\u00b7R\u0304e(U\u0302k+q)nn\u0304(U\u0302 \u2020 k)m\u0304m\n+e\u2212i(k+q)\u00b7R\u0304e(U\u0302k+q)nm\u0304(U\u0302 \u2020 k)n\u0304m\n] .\n(24)\nNote that \u00b5\u0304 \u2261 (n\u0304, m\u0304, R\u0304e) is a simplified notation. Eq. (24) provides a direct way to transform the static disorder from real space to reciprocal space. In another word, by assigning the concrete function form of fnmkq\u00b5, Eq. (7) can represent any Gaussian static disorder with a translational symmetric covariance.\nII.1.3. Examples of the static disorder\nHere we give some examples of the static disorder to show the generality of Eq. (7). For the sake of simplicity, we only consider the situation of single electronic energy band and single type of static disorder. As such, the real-space and reciprocal-space expression of the static disorder are simplified to\nH\u0302sd = \u2211 R \u03b3R ( c\u0302\u2020Rc\u0302R+R\u03040 + c\u0302 \u2020 R+R\u03040 c\u0302R ) (25)\nand\nH\u0302sd = N \u2212 32 \u2211 q \u2211 k fkqDqc\u0302 \u2020 k+qc\u0302k, (26)\nrespectively. Here, R\u03040 is a specific lattice vector. R\u03040 = 0 and R\u03040 6= 0 correspond to local and nonlocal static disorders, respectively. For the sake of convenience, we omit the indexes \u00b5\u0304 and \u00b5 in \u03b3\u00b5\u0304R and fkq\u00b5, respectively. The unitary matrices U\u0302k+q, U\u0302 \u2020 k and \u03a6\u0302 \u2020 q all reduce to the identity matrix, and Eq. (24) is simplified to\nfkq = \u221a \u03bbq [ eik\u00b7R\u03040 + e\u2212i(k+q)\u00b7R\u03040 ] , (27)\nwhere\n\u03bbq = \u2211 \u2206R eiq\u00b7\u2206RM{\u03b3R\u03b3R+\u2206R} (28)\nis the eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the static disorder. In the following, we discuss the concrete form of fkq under different situations.\nWe first consider the case R\u03040 = 0, which corresponds to the static disorder in the orbital energy. From Eq. (27),\n6 it is clear that fkq = 2 \u221a \u03bbq is only dependent on q but not on k. Assume that the disorder variables \u03b3R are uncorrelated,M{\u03b3R\u03b3R+\u2206R} = \u03c3\u03b40,\u2206R, where \u03c3 characterizes the magnitude of the static disorder. Substituting \u03bbq = \u03c3 and R\u03040 = 0 into Eq. (27), we obtain\nfkq = 2 \u221a \u03c3. (29)\nTherefore, uncorrelated local static disorder corresponds to a constant fkq.\nThen, consider the local static disorder with the following correlation property\nM{\u03b3R\u03b3R+\u2206R} = \u03c3e\u2212 |\u2206R|2 2L2 , (30)\nwhere \u03c3 and L characterize the magnitude and correlation length of the static disorder, respectively. When the relative distance |\u2206R| exceeds L, the correlation between different disorder variables will rapidly decline as |\u2206R| further increases. Substituting Eq. (30) into Eq. (28) and Eq. (27), we obtain\nfkq = 2 ( \u03c3 \u2211 \u2206R eiq\u00b7\u2206Re\u2212 |\u2206R|2 2L2 ) 1 2 . (31)\nAs compared with Eq. (29), it can be seen that the dependence of fkq on q reflects the real-space correlation of the static disorder.\nNow turn to the situation that R\u03040 is a nonzero vector, which corresponds to the static disorder in electronic couplings. We first consider the uncorrelated disorder variables, M{\u03b3R\u03b3R\u2032} = \u03b4RR\u2032\u03c3. Substituting the eigenvalue \u03bbq = \u03c3 into Eq. (27), we obtain\nfkq = \u221a \u03c3 ( eik\u00b7R\u03040 + e\u2212i(k+q)\u00b7R\u03040 ) . (32)\nOn can see that fkq exhibits dependency on both k and q, which is a character of the nonlocal static disorder. Likewise, consider the nonlocal static disorder with the following correlation property\nM{\u03b3R\u03b3R+\u2206R} = \u03c3e\u2212 |\u2206R|2 2L2 . (33)\nAfter the same procedure, we obtain\nfkq = ( \u03c3 \u2211 \u2206R eiq\u00b7\u2206Re\u2212 |\u2206R|2 2L2 ) 1 2\n\u00d7 ( eik\u00b7R0 + e\u2212i(k+q)\u00b7R0 ) .\n(34)\nAs can be seen, Eqs. (7)-(9) provide an elegant way for the description of the static disorder in reciprocal space. The resemblance between the static disorder and the electron-phonon interactions also paves the way for incorporating the former one into the DQMC framework, as will be seen in Sec. II.3."

(35). Thereby, the thermal average over the multiple product of phonon coordinates is reduced to the summation over the multiple product of various binary thermal averages. From Wick\u2019s theorem, we can also know that Eq. (35) should be zero\nif the number of B\u0302\u03bdq is odd.

Generalized Wick\u2019s theorem for static disorder\nWhen introducing the static disorder to the DQMC framework, one will have to deal with the following complex product of disorder variables\nQ2\u03ba,k0 =N\u22123\u03ba \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b52\u03baq2\u03ba \u03b4q1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+q2\u03ba,k0D\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u00d7D\u00b52\u03baq2\u03baY2\u03ba(\u00b51,q1; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\u00b52\u03ba,q2\u03ba). (38)\nHere, \u03ba is a positive integer. k0 is a crystal momentum in the first Brillouin zone. D\u00b5q is a complex Gaussian random variable obeying Eq. (9). Y2\u03ba is a bounded continuous complex function of q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,q2\u03ba, and is not always zero in the definition domain. Eq. (38) resembles very much the phonon thermal average Eq. (35). In fact, based on the central limit theorem, a generalized Wick\u2019s theorem can be proven to greatly simplify Eq. (38). The pivotal idea relies on the fact that most of the terms in the summation will cancel out with each other due to the stochastic nature of D\u00b5q, and only those terms where all\n7 D\u00b5q are in pairwise combination with each other contribute to Eq. (38).\nWe first briefly introduce the central limit theorem. Consider L independent random variables x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xL, where the average value and standard deviation of the nth random variable xn are x\u0304n and \u03c3n, respectively. We\nset \u03c3L = \u221a\u2211L n=1 \u03c3 2 n. According to the Lyapunov\u2019s central limit theorem, if there exists a positive number \u03b7 such that \u2211L\nn=1M{|xn \u2212 x\u0304n|2+\u03b7} (\u03c3L)2+\u03b7 \u2192 0 (39)\nwhen L \u2192 \u221e, then the summation of the random variables \u2211L n=1 xn is subject to the Gaussian distribution\nwith an average of \u2211L n=1 x\u0304n and a standard deviation of \u03c3L. In other words, we have\nL\u2211 n=1 xn \u223c L\u2211 n=1 x\u0304n \u00b1 \u03c3\u0304L 1 2 , (40)\nwhere A \u223c B represents that A and B are at the same magnitude, and \u03c3\u0304 = \u221a\u2211L n=1 \u03c3 2 n/L.\nNow we show how to utilize Eq. (40) and mathematical induction to prove the following relation\u2211\n\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b5\u03baq\u03ba D\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7D\u00b5\u03baq\u03ba\n\u00d7 Y\u03ba(\u00b51,q1; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\u00b5\u03ba,q\u03ba) \u223c N 3\u03ba 2 .\n(41)\nFor the sake of simplicity, we first assume that Y\u03ba is a real-variable function and D\u00b5q are standard real Gaussian random variables. The results will be generalized to the complex-number case later. For \u03ba = 1, the left of Eq. (41) becomes \u2211 \u00b5qD\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q). Since D\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q) can be regarded as a Gaussian random variable with a zero average value and a standard deviation of |Y1(\u00b5,q)|, we can use Lyapunov\u2019s central limit theorem to evaluate the magnitude of \u2211 \u00b5qD\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q). We might set \u03b7 = 2, then the numerator in Eq. (39) is\nL\u2211 n=1 M{|xn \u2212 x\u0304n|2+\u03b7} = \u2211 \u00b5q |Y1(\u00b5,q)|4M{|D\u00b5q|4}\n= 3 \u2211 \u00b5q |Y1(\u00b5,q)|4\n\u2264 3|Ymax|4NsdN3 \u223c N3,\n(42)\nwhere Nsd is the total number of the index \u00b5 (that is, the total number of static disorder types), and |Ymax| is the maximal absolute value of Y (remember that Y is bounded in its definition domain). Furthermore, due to the continuity of Y1, we can always find a continuous region R0 in which Y1 is always nonzero. Assume that the minimal absolute value of Y in R0 is |Ymin,R0 |. For the denominator in Eq. (39), we have\n(\u03c3L) 2+\u03b7 = [\u2211 \u00b5q |Y1(\u00b5,q)|2 ]2\n\u2265  \u2211 (\u00b5,q)\u2208R0 |Y1(\u00b5,q)|2 2\n\u2265 [ |Ymin,R0 |2r0NsdN3 ]2 \u223c N6, (43)\nwhere r0 is the ratio between the area of R0 and the total area of the definition domain of Y1(\u00b5,q). Combining Eq. (42) and Eq. (43), the condition Eq. (39) is satisfied, and one can use Lyapunov\u2019s central limit theorem to evaluate the magnitude of \u2211 \u00b5qD\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q). Keeping in mind that the total number of q point is N3 and the fact that the average value of D\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q) is zero, from Eq. (40) we have\n\u2211 \u00b5q D\u00b5qY1(\u00b5,q) \u223c \u00b1\n[\u2211 \u00b5q |Y1(\u00b5,q)|2\nNsdN3\n] 1 2\nN 1 2 sdN 3 2 \u223c N 32 ,\n(44) which proves that Eq. (41) is valid for \u03ba = 1. In the next step, we assume that Eq. (41) is valid for a positive integer \u03ba, and inspect the case of \u03ba+ 1. Setting\nK\u03ba,\u00b5q = \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b5\u03baq\u03ba D\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7D\u00b5\u03baq\u03ba\n\u00d7 Y\u03ba+1(\u00b51,q1; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\u00b5\u03ba,q\u03ba;\u00b5,q), (45)\nthen\u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b5\u03ba+1q\u03ba+1 D\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7D\u00b5\u03ba+1q\u03ba+1\n\u00d7 Y\u03ba+1(\u00b51,q1; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ;\u00b5\u03ba+1,q\u03ba+1) = \u2211 \u00b5q K\u03ba,\u00b5qD\u00b5q. (46)\nIt is easy to know that K\u03ba,\u00b5q is also a bounded continuous function of q, and it is not always zero in the definition domain. Since K\u03ba,\u00b5q \u223c N 3\u03ba 2 , we can regard K\u03ba,\u00b5qD\u00b5q as a Gaussian random variable with a zero average and a standard deviation at the magnitude of N 3\u03ba 2 . Apply-\ning Eq. (40) again, we obtain \u2211 \u00b5qK\u03ba,\u00b5qD\u00b5q \u223c N 3(\u03ba+1) 2 . Hence, Eq. (41) is valid for any positive integer \u03ba. Finally, in the complex-number case, we can divide Eq. (41) into the real and imaginary parts and complete the prove separately through the same procedure.\nNow we utilize Eq. (41) to prove the generalized Wick\u2019s theorem for static disorder. First consider the case k0 6= 0. Inspecting Eq. (38), we can find that due to the existence of \u03b4q1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+q2\u03ba,k0 , one of the 2\u03ba q indexes in Eq. (38) is eliminated, and Eq. (38) only involves the summation over 2\u03ba\u2212 1 q indexes. From Eq. (41), we readily obtain\nQ2\u03ba,k0 \u223c N\u2212 3 2 for k0 6= 0. (47)\nThe same argument also applies to the case where Eq. (38) only involves an odd number of (\u00b5,q) index sets.\nThen we consider the case k0 = 0. Divide Q2\u03ba,0 into two parts, Q2\u03ba,0 = Qunpair2\u03ba + Q pair 2\u03ba , where the terms involving at least one unpaired D\u00b5q are included in Qunpair2\u03ba , whereas those with all the D\u00b5q in pairwise combinations are included in Qpair2\u03ba (we say that D\u00b5iqi and D\u00b5jqj are paired if and only if \u00b5i = \u00b5j and qi = \u2212qj). Following the same argument, it is easy to show that Qunpair2\u03ba \u223c N\u2212 3 2 . However, the situation of Qpair2\u03ba is completely different. Invoking the fact D\u00b5qD\u00b5,\u2212q = |D\u00b5q|2, Qpair2\u03ba can be explicitly written as\nQpair2\u03ba =N\u22123\u03ba \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b5\u03baq\u03ba |D\u00b51q1 |2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |D\u00b5\u03baq\u03ba |2\n\u00d7 \u2211\nall possible pairings\nY2\u03ba(paired), (48)\n8 where Y2\u03ba(paired) represents that all the variables (\u00b5,q) of Y2\u03ba are in a specific type of pairwise combination. For instance, when \u03ba = 2, Y4(paired) could be any one of Y4(\u00b51,q1;\u00b51,\u2212q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b52,\u2212q2) , Y4(\u00b51,q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b51,\u2212q1;\u00b52,\u2212q2) and Y4(\u00b51,q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b52,\u2212q2;\u00b51,\u2212q1). For a general \u03ba, there are (2\u03ba)!2\u03ba\u03ba! kinds of different Y2\u03ba(paired) in total. It is seen that in Eq. (48) the Kronecker delta symbol disappears since all paired variables automatically satisfies the condition q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+q2\u03ba = 0. Furthermore, regarding |D\u00b5q|2 as indepedent random variables, Eq. (48) can be considered as the summation over |D\u00b5q|2 instead of D\u00b5q. From Eq. (9) we know that the average value of |D\u00b5q|2 is 1 rather than 0. As such, applying the Lyapunov\u2019s central limit theorem and mathematical induction again, we have Qpair2\u03ba \u223c N0. Combining all the above results, we finally obtain\nQ2\u03ba,k0 =\u03b4k0,0N\u22123\u03ba \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b5\u03baq\u03ba |D\u00b51q1 |2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |D\u00b5\u03baq\u03ba |2 \u2211\nall possible pairings\nY2\u03ba(paired) +O(N\u2212 3 2 ).\n(49)\nEq. (49) is the generalized Wick\u2019s theorem for static disorder. The last summation in Eq. (49) involves (2\u03ba)!2\u03ba\u03ba! of\ndifferent Y2\u03ba(paired). Taking \u03ba = 2 as an example, according to Eq. (49), we have\nN\u22126 \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 \u00b54q4 \u03b4q1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+q4,0D\u00b51q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7D\u00b54q4Y (\u00b51,q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b53,q3;\u00b54,q4)\n=N\u22126 \u2211 \u00b51q1 \u2211 \u00b52q2 [Y (\u00b51,q1;\u00b51,\u2212q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b52,\u2212q2) + Y (\u00b51,q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b51,\u2212q1;\u00b52,\u2212q2)\n+Y (\u00b51,q1;\u00b52,q2;\u00b52,\u2212q2;\u00b51,\u2212q1)] |D\u00b51q1 |2|D\u00b52q2 |2 +O(N\u2212 3 2 ).\n(50)\nAt this moment, it is worth pointing out that in the generalized Wick\u2019s theorem, the contribution from unpaired terms is at the magnitude of N\u2212 3 2 , and it approaches zero only in the thermodynamic limit (N \u2192\u221e). Whereas in the Wick\u2019s theorem for phonons, the contribution from unpaired terms is exactly zero no matter the size of the system. As compared with Eqs. (35)-(37), |D\u00b5q|2 may be regarded as the free static disorder propagator, although it does not really depend on time.\nII.3. Diagrammatic expansion of the partition function\nNow we turn to the diagrammatic expansion of the partition function, Z = Tr{e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302}. In the new DQMC approach, we consider the single-electron situation. In other words, for the electronic degree of freedom, we restrict ourselves in the subspace expanded by the singleelectron Bloch states |nk\u3009 \u2261 c\u0302\u2020nk|vac\u3009, where |vac\u3009 is the vacuum state that the energy bands under consideration are all empty. This corresponds to the low-density limit frequently encountered in realistic semiconductors.\nWe divide the total Hamiltonian Eq. (1) into a plain\nterm H\u03020 = H\u0302el + H\u0302ph and an interaction term V\u0302 = H\u0302el\u2212ph + H\u0302sd, where the concrete expressions for H\u0302el, H\u0302ph, H\u0302el\u2212ph and H\u0302sd have been given in Eq. (2), Eq. (3), Eq. (4) and Eq. (7), respectively. To facilitate the derivation, we can further rewrite the interaction term as\nV\u0302 = \u2211 jq \u039b\u0302\u2020jqF\u0302jq. (51)\nHere, we have introduced several new notations\nF\u0302jq = { B\u0302jq for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Nph, Dj\u2032q for Nph < j \u2264 Nph +Nsd,\n(52)\n\u039b\u0302\u2020jq = N \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk hnmkqj c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk, (53)\nwith\nhnmkqj = { gnmkqj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Nph, fnmkqj\u2032 for Nph < j \u2264 Nph +Nsd, (54)\nwhere j\u2032 = j\u2212Nph, andNph andNsd are the total number of phonon branches and static disorder branches, respectively. Note that we have introduced a unified branch index j to replace \u03bd and \u00b5.\nThen, expand Z into an infinite series in terms of V\u0302 as follows\nZ = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c42\u03ba \u222b \u03c42\u03ba 0 d\u03c42\u03ba\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b \u03c42 0 d\u03c41\n\u00d7 Tr { e\u2212\u03b2H\u03020T+V\u0302 (\u03c42\u03ba) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 V\u0302 (\u03c41) } +O(N\u2212 32 ), (55)\nwhere V\u0302 (\u03c4) = e\u03c4H\u03020 V\u0302 e\u2212\u03c4H\u03020 is the interaction term at imaginary time \u03c4 , the sequential order of imaginary-time variables is 0 \u2264 \u03c41 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03c42\u03ba \u2264 \u03b2, and the trace over the electronic part is restricted to the single-electron Bloch states. It is noted that we only include even-order terms in Eq. (55). As will be seen soon afterwards, according to the two Wick\u2019s theorems presented in the last subsection, the contributions from odd-order terms to the partition\n9 function are at the magnitude of about N\u2212 3 2 and have been integrated into O(N\u2212 32 ) in Eq. (55). Substituting Eq. (51) into Eq. (55) and using the fact that the electronic operator \u039b\u0302\u2020jq commutes with the disorder coordinate F\u0302jq, we obtain\nZ = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u2211 j1q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 j2\u03baq2\u03ba \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c42\u03ba \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b \u03c42 0 d\u03c41Tr { e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302elT+\u039b\u0302\u2020j2\u03baq2\u03ba(\u03c42\u03ba) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u039b\u0302 \u2020 j1q1 (\u03c41) }\n\u00d7 Tr { e\u2212\u03b2H\u0302phT+F\u0302j2\u03baq2\u03ba(\u03c42\u03ba) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 F\u0302j1q1(\u03c41) } +O(N\u2212 32 ),\n(56)\nwhere \u039b\u0302\u2020jq(\u03c4) = e \u03c4H\u0302el\u039b\u0302\u2020jqe \u2212\u03c4H\u0302el and F\u0302jq(\u03c4) = e\u03c4H\u0302ph F\u0302jqe \u2212\u03c4H\u0302ph . It should be noted that all of the operators in the two curly braces have already been arranged\nin the correct chronological order.\nSubstituting Eq. (53) into Eq. (56) and explicitly evaluating the trace over the electronic part, one arrives at\nZ = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u2211 k1 \u2211 m1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m2\u03ba \u2211 j1q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 j2\u03baq2\u03ba \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c42\u03ba \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b \u03c42 0 d\u03c41\u03b4q1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+q2\u03ba,0N \u22123\u03ba [ 2\u03ba\u220f l=1 hml+1mlklqljl ]\n\u00d7 Zph\u3008T+F\u0302j2\u03baq2\u03ba(\u03c42\u03ba) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 F\u0302j1q1(\u03c41)\u3009ph exp\n{ \u2212\n2\u03ba\u2211 l=1 (\u03c4l \u2212 \u03c4l\u22121) mlkl\n} +O(N\u2212 32 ).\n(57)\nHere, for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 2\u03ba, \u03c4l is the time position of the lth interaction vertex, and \u03c40 = \u03c42\u03ba\u2212\u03b2. k1 is the initial electronic crystal momentum, kl = k+q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ql\u22121 is the crystal momentum within the time interval (\u03c4l\u22121, \u03c4l). ml is the energy band index within (\u03c4l\u22121, \u03c4l), and m2\u03ba+1 = m1.\nTo go further, we need to simplify the thermal aver-\nage in the second row of Eq. (57). It is worth pointing out again that the disorder variable D\u00b5q is a complex random variable instead of an operator. Therefore, the phonon coordinate B\u0302\u03bdq commutes with D\u00b5q. Combining the Wick\u2019s theorem for phonons, Eq. (35), and the generalized Wick\u2019s theorem for static disorder, Eq. (49), we can recast Eq. (57) into\nZ = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u2211 k1 \u2211 m1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m2\u03ba \u2211 j1q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 j2\u03baq2\u03ba \u222b \u03b2 0 d\u03c42\u03ba \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b \u03c42 0 d\u03c41N \u22123\u03baZph [ 2\u03ba\u220f l=1 hml+1mlklqljl ]\n\u00d7 exp { \u2212\n2\u03ba\u2211 l=1 (\u03c4l \u2212 \u03c4l\u22121) mlkl } \u2211 all possible\npairings\n\u03b4ji1 ji2 \u03b4qi1 ,\u2212qi2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b4ji2\u03ba\u22121 ji2\u03ba \u03b4qi2\u03ba\u22121 ,\u2212qi2\u03ba\n\u00d7 \u03beji1qi1 (\u03c4i1 \u2212 \u03c4i2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03beji2\u03ba\u22121qi2\u03ba\u22121 (\u03c4i2\u03ba\u22121 \u2212 \u03c4i2\u03ba) +O(N \u2212 32 ),\n(58)\nwhere the time variable pairs in the last row should follow \u03c4i1 > \u03c4i2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c4i2\u03ba\u22121 > \u03c4i2\u03ba , and\n\u03bejq(\u03c4) = { \u03b1jq(\u03c4) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Nph, |Dj\u2032q|2 for Nph < j \u2264 Nph +Nsd, (59)\nwith j\u2032 = j \u2212 Nph can be regarded as a compact free disorder propagator. It should be noted that although the summations in Eq. (58) seem to be relevant to 2\u03ba sets of indexes (j,q), only \u03ba sets of them are independent with each other due to the existence of the Kronecker delta symbols, and half of them should be left out when doing the summations.\nEq. (58) is the central result of this work. To associate\nwith the Monte Carlo technique, we reexpress Eq. (58) as\nZ = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u2211 x\u03ba Z(x\u03ba). (60)\nHere, the configuration variable x\u03ba is defined as\nx\u03ba \u2261(k1;m1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m2\u03ba; ji1 ,qi1 , \u03c4i1 , \u03c4i2 ; ji3 , qi3 , \u03c4i3 , \u03c4i4 ; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; ji2\u03ba\u22121 ,qi2\u03ba\u22121 , \u03c4i2\u03ba\u22121 , \u03c4i2\u03ba), (61)\nwhere (i1, i2; \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ; i2\u03ba\u22121, i2\u03ba) represents a possible pairwise combination of (1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 2\u03ba), and the corresponding time variable pairs obey \u03c4i1 > \u03c4i2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c4i2\u03ba\u22121 > \u03c4i2\u03ba . The ordered sequence (j1q1, j2q2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , j2\u03baq2\u03ba) can be regarded as the chronological rearrangement of the sequence (ji1qi1 , ji2qi2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ji2\u03baqi2\u03ba), where ji2n = ji2n\u22121\n10\nand qi2n = \u2212qi2n\u22121 with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 \u03ba (a requirement of the Kronecker delta symbol in Eq. (58)). Note that we have denoted the order of the configuration x\u03ba explicitly in the subscript. In Eq. (60), the summation over x\u03ba represents\n\u2211 x\u03ba \u2261 \u2211 k1 \u2211 m1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7m2\u03ba \u222b \u03b2 0 \u222b \u03c42\u03ba 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222b \u03c42 0\n\u00d7 \u2211\nall possible pairings\n\u2211 ji1qi1 \u2211 ji3qi3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2211 ji2\u03ba\u22121qi2\u03ba\u22121 , (62)\nand the function Z(x\u03ba) is\nZ(x\u03ba) = N\u22123\u03baZphz(x\u03ba)d\u03c41 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d\u03c42\u03ba, (63)\nwhere\nz(x\u03ba) = [ 2\u03ba\u220f l=1 hml+1mlklqljl ] exp { \u2212 2\u03ba\u2211 l=1 (\u03c4l \u2212 \u03c4l\u22121) mlkl } \u00d7 \u03beji1qi1 (\u03c4i1 \u2212 \u03c4i2)\u03beji3qi3 (\u03c4i3 \u2212 \u03c4i4) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 \u03beji2\u03ba\u22121qi2\u03ba\u22121 (\u03c4i2\u03ba\u22121 \u2212 \u03c4i2\u03ba).\n(64)\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between z(x\u03ba) and the Feynman diagram. With the help of the diagrams, one can easily obtain the concrete expression of z(x\u03ba) at any configurations. Based on Eqs. (60)-(64), the implementation and numerical realization of DQMC is straightforward and similar to the other variants in the literatures58,60,61,70 Therefore, we will not present the details here. For the completeness and self-consistency of this paper, we provide several relevant contents in the Supplemental Material, including a brief summary of the Monte Carlo technique, the correspondence between z(x\u03ba) and the diagrams, the necessary configuration updating procedures required for the Monte Carlo stochastic sampling, and several efficient estimators for the calculations of different physical quantities such as the thermally averaged coherence, one-particle Green\u2019s function, and imaginary time current autocorrelation function."

            "heading": "III.2. Numerical Results",
            "text": "To eliminate any finite-size effects, all of the DQMC calculations are performed in the thermodynamic limit (N \u2192 \u221e). Two methods, the stochastic Liouville-von\n11\nNeumann equation74,75 (SLN) and the polaron theory, are used to benchmark the results of DQMC. SLN is a numerically exact method that incorporates the influence of electron-phonon interactions on the system via stochastic fields, but the numerical cost grows cubically with respect to the system size, and it may be hard to converge at low temperatures or strong electron-phonon interactions. To afford the numerical cost, we adopt a finite-size molecular chain consisting of dozens of sites in the SLN calculations. On the other hand, the polaron theory treats nonlocal interactions as perturbation, and only includes the lowest-order contributions of V , \u03bbnon and \u2206non. As such, the polaron theory is accurate only in the limit V, \u03bbnon,\u2206non T .\nWe start from the case of dynamic disorder. It it noted that the performance of DQMC is tightly connected to the average diagram order \u3008\u03ba\u3009 and the average diagram sign, the latter one is defined by\n\u3008Sign\u3009 = \u221e\u2211 \u03ba=0 \u2211 x\u03ba |Z(x\u03ba)| Z(x\u03ba) . (72)\nThe numerical cost for calculating the weight of a concrete diagram is linear in the diagram order, and so as those for calculating various estimators. As such, it is expected that the overall numerical cost should be at least linear in the average diagram order. On the other hand, it is well known that in a Monte Carlo simulation the stochastic error can be magnified by the inverse of \u3008Sign\u3009. Therefore, the error may become uncontrollable if \u3008Sign\u3009 1.\nFig. 1 (a) and (b) present the average diagram order and average sign, respectively, at different temperatures with the presence of local or nonlocal electron-phonon interactions. It is seen that for both types of dynamic disorders, the average diagram order increases linearly with 1/T , and the order of the nonlocal one is slightly larger than that of the local one at the same temperature. From Fig. 1 (b), it is found that for local dynamic disorder the average sign is always unity in the whole temperature regime, whereas that for the nonlocal one slowly\ndecreases from unity as the temperature decreases. Inspecting Eq. (64), it is clear that the phase factor of a diagram is exclusively determined by the electron-phonon interaction parameters gnmkq\u03bd . For the local dynamic disorder, gnmkq\u03bd is usually independent of the electronic crystal momentum k. Since (gnmkq\u03bd)\n\u2217 = gnm,k+q,\u2212q,\u03bd , and the interaction vertexes with the opposite q always exist in pairs, we can expect that there is usually no sign problem for the local dynamic disorder. On the contrary, gnmkq\u03bd can exhibit fruitful dependence on both k and q for the nonlocal one, and the sign problem may show up in some parameter regimes. In spite of this, the average sign is still larger than 0.3 even if the temperature is extremely low.\nDisorders of different types alter the electronic properties of the system in varying degrees. To show this, we calculate the coherence participation ratio (CPR), which measures the magnitude of real-space coherence and is therefore a good indicator for characterizing the localization degree of the electron. CPR is defined as\nCPR = (\u2211 n |\u03c1nn|2 ) ( \u2211 n \u2211 l |\u03c1n,n+l|)2\u2211 n \u2211 l |\u03c1n,n+l|2 , (73)\nwhere \u03c1n,n+l = Tr{c\u0302\u2020nc\u0302n+le\u2212\u03b2H\u0302/Z} is the thermally averaged coherence between site n and site n+ l. For a completely delocalized state, CPR equals to the total site number N , whereas for a completely localized state it equals to one.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, without the presence of any disorder, CPR quickly arises as the temperature decreases. Under the influence of local dynamic disorder, the magnitude of CPR is slightly decreased, but it still exhibits a large value at low temperatures, indicating that moderate local dynamic disorder (\u03bbloc \u2248 V ) only has limited impact on the system. However, when the nonlocal dynamic disorder takes part in, CPR is substantially suppressed to a small value for the whole temperature range. This implies that the nonlocal one has a much more significant decoherence effect than the local one, which is consistent with the physical picture of the transient lo-\n12\ncalization scenario39\u201342. In addition, the results obtained by SLN shown in Fig. 2 coincide with those calculated by DQMC since they are both numerically exact. We note that it becomes very hard to acquire a convergent result for SLN as \u03bbloc > 15 or \u03bbnon > 5.\nNext, we analyze the situation of varying the dynamic disorder strength at a fixed temperature. The results are presented in Fig. 3 (a). Similarly, the average diagram order is linearly dependent on \u03bbloc and \u03bbnon. The average sign for the local dynamic disorder is still unity despite the concrete value of \u03bbloc, whereas that for the nonlocal one continuously declines as \u03bbnon increases, and it becomes smaller than 0.05 when \u03bbnon exceeds 20. As\na result, it is not easy to obtain convergent results for DQMC when \u03bbnon > 20.\nTo see the impacts of strong dynamic disorder on the system, in Fig. 3 (b) we present the CPR and the average electronic energy defined as \u3008Eel\u3009 = Tr{H\u0302ele\u2212\u03b2H\u0302/Z} for different values of \u03bbloc and \u03bbnon. As can be seen, by varying \u03bbloc from weak to strong regimes, the CPR gradually decreases and finally approaches 1. Simultaneously, the average electronic energy continuously increases and eventually approaches zero. This is not surprising but can be well explained by the energy band narrowing effect induced by the local electron-phonon interactions. On the other hand, under the influence of the nonlocal dynamic disorder, the CPR shows much more fruitful behaviours. As \u03bbnon increases from zero, the CPR sharply declines in the beginning and quickly reaches a minimal value at around \u03bbnon = V . After that, the CPR briefly arises and then decreases again at a slow rate. This peculiar behaviour implies that the nonlocal dynamic disorder may play a dual role in the decoherence. Furthermore, from the right panel of Fig. 3 (b), it can be seen that the nonlocal dynamic disorder also has a stronger impact on the average electronic energy than the local one.\nTo further elucidate the effects of the nonlocal dynamic disorder on the coherence, we present the normalized real-space coherence |\u03c1\u0303n,n+l| = |\u03c1n,n+l|/|\u03c1nn| with different strengths of nonlocal electron-phonon interactions in Fig. 4. It is found that although the presence of weak nonlocal dynamic disorder (\u03bbnon = 0.5) substantially suppresses the coherence, the next nearest-neighbouring coherence |\u03c1\u0303n,n+2| is resurrected as \u03bbnon exceeds V , and it even surpasses that without disorder when \u03bbnon is larger than 3. Similar resurgence phenomenon is also observed for |\u03c1\u0303n,n+3| and |\u03c1\u0303n,n+4|. Combining the results shown\n13\nin Fig. 2, we conclude that when the nonlocal dynamic disorder is weak it strongly suppresses the coherence, whereas it turns to help regenerate the coherence when it becomes strong. In addition, it is noted that the nearestneighbouring coherence |\u03c1\u0303n,n+1| is always suppressed no matter the strength of the disorder, which is found to be relevant to the anti-symmetric form of the nonlocal electron-phonon interaction.\nNow we turn to the static disorder. Fig. 5 presents the average diagram order and average sign for varying temperatures and varying static disorder strengths. Different from the linear relation of the dynamic one, it is found that the average diagram order increases quadratically as 1/T , \u2206loc or \u2206non increases. Since the diagram order partially reflects the importance of the interaction, one can expect that the static disorder will dominate the transport properties at low temperatures, whereas the dynamic one will overwhelm at high temperatures. Furthermore, similar to the dynamic disorder, the average sign for a local static disorder is always unity, but a nonlocal one can have a severe sign problem when \u2206non/T is larger than 5, which is much worse than the case of the dynamic disorder. Consequently, it is hard to obtain convergent results when \u2206non/T > 5 for the current version of DQMC.\nThe static disorder can strongly influence the electronic properties of the system at low temperatures. Fig. 6 presents the CPR and average electronic energy at different temperatures with the presence of local or nonlocal static disorders. In the local case, from Fig. 6 (a) it can be seen that the CPR and average electronic energy start to deviate those without the disorder when \u2206non/T is larger than 1. As \u2206non/T exceeds 2, the CPR gradually approaches a maximal value of about six and\nthen turns to decline. In the meantime, the average electronic energy exhibits a similar inversion behaviour. At extremely low temperatures (where the ground state is mostly occupied), the CPR and average electronic energy finally approach one and zero, respectively. It is well known that with the presence of static disorder the ground state of a one-dimensional chain is exponentially localized, the so-called Anderson localization. Our results successfully capture this feature. As for the results of the nonlocal static disorder shown in Fig. 6 (b), we find that the influence of the disorder also becomes important when \u2206non/T > 1, but the effects are less significant than those in the local case, and the inversion behaviour do not obviously appears within the range \u2206non/T < 5. Convergent results are not available for lower temperatures.\nOne of the most important transport properties is the optical conductivity, which can be obtained by applying analytic continuation to the imaginary time or imaginary frequency current autocorrelation function. Fig. 7 (a) presents the current autocorrelation function for small electronic couplings with the presence of local dynamic and local static disorders. As can be seen, the imaginarytime one, G(\u03c4), is a symmetric function with respect to \u03c4 . When there is no disorder, G(\u03c4) is a constant function; as the disorder is turned on, G(\u03c4) becomes cupulate, and the stronger the disorder, the more concave in the middle of G(\u03c4). In the strong disorder limit, G(0) can even be larger than G(\u03b2/2) by several orders of magnitude. On the contrary, the imaginary-frequency current autocorre-\nlation function G\u0303(i\u03c9n) becomes less and less structured as the disorder strength increases. Similar behaviours are found for the case of large electronic couplings at low temperatures shown in Fig. 7 (b). We also present the results of the polaron theory and SLN in Fig. 7. In the small electronic coupling limit, the polaron theory is quite accurate, and the results perfectly coincide with those obtained by DQMC. As for SLN, it is found to be hard to obtain convergent results for large \u03bbloc at low temperatures. Fig. 8 presents the current autocorrelation functions with the inclusion of nonlocal disorders. Again, one can find that the results of the polaron theory and DQMC are consistent with each other in the limit of weak nonlocal interactions.\nIn the last part of this section, we examine the reliability of combining DQMC and numerical analytic continuation to extract charge carrier mobilities in different transport regimes from imaginary-time data. The imaginary time and imaginary frequency current autocorrelation function is related to the real part of the optical conductivity \u03c3\u03b1(\u03c9) via 57\nG\u03b1\u03b1(\u03c4) = 1\n\u03c0 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u03c9e\u2212\u03c4\u03c9 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b2\u03c9 \u03c3\u03b1(\u03c9) (74)\nand\nG\u0303\u03b1\u03b1(i\u03c9n) = 1\n\u03c0 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03c9 \u03c92 \u03c92 + \u03c92n \u03c3\u03b1(\u03c9), (75)\nrespectively. Inversely, \u03c3\u03b1(\u03c9) can be obtained by applying numerical analytic continuation to G\u03b1\u03b1(\u03c4) or G\u0303\u03b1\u03b1(i\u03c9n). The mobility of the charge carrier along the \u03b1 direction can be extracted from the optical conductivity via \u00b5\u03b1 = lim\u03c9\u21920 \u03c3\u03b1(\u03c9)/|e|.\nWe choose the state-of-the-art stochastic optimization method61,76 (SOM) to perform numerical analytic con-\n14\n15\ntinuation on G\u0303(i\u03c9n). It is worth mentioning that based on the Holstein model, Mishchenko et al. have successfully obtained the mobilities in several regions including the band conduction region66. Their work on the SuSchrieffer-Hegger model67. also covers the regime of transient localization. As such, in the following we mainly focus on the strong disorder regimes involving several types of disorders.\nThe first example is the thermally activated hopping transport shown in Fig. 9. In this region, the Marcus theory is applicable, and the mobility can be calculated by\n\u00b5 = 1\nzsdkBT\n\u222b dE1 \u222b dE2Psd(E1)Psd(E2)e \u2212E1/kBT\n\u00d7 |V |2 \u221a \u03c0\nkBT\u03bb e\u2212(E2\u2212E1+\u03bb) 2/(4kBT\u03bb),\n(76)\nwhere \u03bb = 2\u03bbloc is the reorganization energy for the electron transfer,\nPsd(E) = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u2206loc e\u2212E 2/(2\u22062loc) (77)\nis the probability distribution function of the static disorder, and zsd = \u222b dEPsd(E)e\n\u2212E/kBT . As can be seen in Fig. 9, the mobilities calculated by DQMC and SOM coincide very well with the Marcus theory despite very small deviations at some temperatures. This confirms the validity of the analytic continuation strategy in the hopping region with the presence of both dynamic and static disorders.\nThe second one is the phonon-assisted transport presented in Fig. 10. In this region, the mobility can be obtained by\n\u00b5 = kpol/kBT, (78)\nwhere kpol is the rate constant calculated via the realtime version of the polaron theory77. From Fig. 10, it is seen that as the nonlocal electron-phonon interaction strength increases, the mobility continuously increases, which is a character of the phonon-assisted transport. The comparison with the polaron theory further validates the results of DQMC and SOM.\nThe last one is the nuclear tunneling transport mechanism. To explain the conflict between the localization nature of the carrier and the band-like behaviour of the mobility in many organic semiconductors, Nan and coworkers35 have proposed that the carrier still follows hopping motion but the hopping rate decreases with the increase in the temperature due to the nuclear tunneling effect of high-frequency intramolecular vibrations. By using the Fermi\u2019s golden rule (FGR) to calculate the hopping rate, they successfully obtained the band-like mobilities for several organic semiconductors. Fig. 11 presents the mobilities in the nuclear tunneling region calculated by our method and by FGR. We set \u03c9c = 10 to mimic high-frequency intramolecular vibrations. The results of FGR are calculated by\n\u00b5 = 1\nzsdkBT\n\u222b dE1 \u222b dE2Psd(E1)Psd(E2)\n\u00d7 e\u2212E1/kBT kFGR(E2 \u2212 E1), (79)\n16\nwhere kFGR(E) =|V |2 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e dt exp{iEt\u2212 \u2211 j Sj [(2nj + 1)\n\u2212 nje\u2212i\u03c9jt \u2212 (nj + 1)ei\u03c9jt]}, (80)\nand Sj = g 2 j /2\u03c9 3 j is the Huang-Rhys factor. It can be seen in Fig. 11 that the results of DQMC and SOM are quantitatively in line with those of FGR at both low and high temperatures. Nevertheless, significant deviations (with a relative error larger than 30%) appear for the temperatures ranging from 5 to 8. This indicates that one should be cautious when applying the numerical analytic continuation in this parameter regime."

            "heading": "IV. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS",
            "text": "The DQMC approach presented here naturally inherits several merits of many other variants in the literatures. First, it is a numerically exact method since we did not introduce any approximation to the framework. Second, this approach can be used to obtain transport properties in the thermodynamic limit (infinitely largesized systems) and therefore is not bothered by any finitesize effects. Carefully inspecting the acceptance ratios and estimators presented in Supporting Information, one can see that the numerical cost of the Monte Carlo procedure is not relevant to the size of the system but is only determined by the temperature and the Hamiltonian parameters, ie., the electron-phonon interactions, phonon frequencies, static disorder, and electronic dispersions. Third, the diagrammatic expansion technique treats the imaginary time as a continuous variable and dispenses with the systematic error caused by the discretization of the time axis (as such, it is more often called the continuous-time QMC in the field of quantum impurities70).\nIn addition to the aforementioned advantages, the present DQMC approach also benefits from the generality of the Hamiltonian we adopted. To give a theoretical description as accurate as possible for realistic disordered semiconductor materials, we have included multiple electronic energy bands and phonon branches with arbitrary dispersions, and various kinds of dynamic and static disorders in the Hamiltonian Eq. (1). We have also explicitly included a general disorder-induced current operator (J\u0302el\u2212ph + J\u0302sd) in our framework. As such, the proposed DQMC approach is versatile and applicable to diverse semiconductor materials involving various intricate factors such as the local and nonlocal electron-phonon interactions, high-frequency optical and low-frequency acoustic phonons, static disorder with complicated covariance properties, complex unit cells with multiple components, and anisotropy.\nWhen applying the DQMC approach to a realistic semiconductor materials, the most expensive part should be the first-principles calculation of the Hamiltonian parameters. For this task, there have already been many powerful state-of-the-art first-principles methods. For example, the electronic energy bands are routinely obtained by the density functional theory, whereas the phonon dispersions and electron-phonon interaction parameters for\na sparse q grid can be efficiently calculated by the density functional perturbation theory78. Nevertheless, in practical calculations, the k and q grids in the Brillouin zone should be dense enough so as to eliminate the finite-size effect. This can be a formidable task for direct ab initio calculations. To circumvent this problem, it is useful to adopt efficient interpolation schemes52,79 to obtain Hamiltonian parameters at any points in the Brillouin zone based on the original data in a relatively coarse grid. This strategy also applies to the parameterization of J\u0302el in Eq. (11)80. As for the parameters unmkq\u03bd and u\u0303nmkq\u00b5 given in Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), respectively, there is no computational method currently available to our knowledge. In Appendix A, we establish a quantitative relationship between J\u0302el\u2212ph and the electron-phonon interactions with the aid of the localized Wannier functions73. This relationship can serve as an efficient computational scheme for unmkq\u03bd . A similar computational scheme for J\u0302sd is discussed in Appendix B.\nIt is worth noting that in the theoretical framework presented in this work, the static disorder is introduced as the certain randomness in the electronic-state energies and electronic couplings on the basis of a perfect periodic crystal. Thereby, this description is suitable for semiconductors with regularly arranged microscopic structures containing small or moderate static disorder, but may not apply to very disordered materials such as amorphous polymers.\nFinally, although we take the semiconductor material as an example, the current approach can also be used to study the transport properties of the exciton in natural and artificial light-harvesting systems as long as the system being studied consists of regularly stacking units. Typical examples of the suitable systems are small-molecule optoelectronic materials like the metal phthalocyanines81,82 and self-assembled tubular molecular aggregates such as the chlorosome from green sulfur bacteria30\u201334 and synthetic nanotubes83\u201386.\nIn summary, starting from a general Hamiltonian expressed in reciprocal space and utilizing the standard diagrammatic expansion technique to the imaginary time propagator, we have proposed a new DQMC approach which is suitable for the accurate calculation of various transport properties in realistic disordered semiconductors and light-harvesting materials. This approach deals with the dynamic and static disorders in a unified and numerically exact way and is applicable to material systems containing multiple electronic bands and phonon branches with general dispersions. It is expected that the DQMC approach proposed here will become a promising theoretical tool for elucidating various fascinating transport properties experimentally observed in disordered semiconductors and light-harvesting materials."

In real space, the polarization operator can be decomposed into two parts as\nP\u0302 = P\u0302(1) + P\u0302(2) (A2)\nwith\nP\u0302(1) = e \u2211 n\u0304R rn\u0304Rc\u0302 \u2020 n\u0304Rc\u0302n\u0304R (A3)\nand P\u0302(2) =e \u2211 n\u0304 \u2211 \u2206R 6=0 rn\u0304n\u0304\u2206R \u2211 R c\u0302\u2020n\u0304,R+\u2206Rc\u0302n\u0304R\n+ e \u2211 n\u0304 6=m\u0304 \u2211 \u2206R rn\u0304m\u0304\u2206R \u2211 R c\u0302\u2020n\u0304,R+\u2206Rc\u0302m\u0304R . (A4)\nHere, rn\u0304R = \u222b r|\u03c8n\u0304R(r)|2dr = rn\u0304 + R with rn\u0304 =\u222b\nr|\u03c8n\u03040(r)|2dr and rn\u0304m\u0304\u2206R = \u222b r\u03c8n\u0304,R+\u2206R(r)\u03c8m\u0304R(r)dr are diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the position operator, respectively, and \u03c8n\u0304R(r) is the wavefunction of the n\u0304th Wannier orbital in the unit cell centered at R. It is noted that rn\u0304m\u0304\u2206R is independent of R, which is due to the orthogonality of the Wannier functions. P\u0302(1) and P\u0302(2) can be regarded as the local and nonlocal components of the polarization operator, respectively. Due to the localization nature of the Wannier orbital, P\u0302(2) is usually much smaller than P\u0302(1) and thereby is frequently neglected in the literatures (which is just the tight-binding approximation).\nThe electron-phonon interactions in real space reads H\u0302el\u2212ph = \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304Re \u2211 \u03bd\u0304Rp \u2211 R gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304\n\u00d7 Q\u0302\u03bd\u0304,R+Rp \u2297 c\u0302 \u2020 n\u0304Rc\u0302m\u0304,R+Re .\n(A5)\nHere, Re and Rp are three-dimensional vectors, the possible values of which are the same as that of R. The realspace vibrational coordinate Q\u0302\u03bd\u0304R can be generally expressed as the linear combination of the reciprocal-space coordinate B\u0302\u03bdq as\nQ\u0302v\u0304R = N \u2212 32 \u2211 q eiq\u00b7R \u2211 \u03bd (\u0398\u0302\u2020q)\u03bd\u0304\u03bd\u221a 2\u03c9\u03bdq B\u0302\u03bdq, (A6)\nwhere \u0398\u0302q is the unitary transformation operator associated with the phonon crystal momentum q. The parameter gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 corresponds to the electron-phonon interaction between |n\u0304R\u3009 \u2261 c\u0302\u2020n\u0304R|vac\u3009 and |m\u0304,R + Re\u3009 \u2261 c\u0302\u2020m\u0304,R+Re |vac\u3009 caused by Q\u0302\u03bd\u0304,R+Rp , and it satisfies the property gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 = gm\u0304n\u0304,\u2212Re,Rp\u2212Re,\u03bd\u0304 . Substituting Eqs. (16) and (A6) into Eq. (A5), one can recover Eq. (4) with the following relation\ngnmkq\u03bd = 1\u221a\n2\u03c9\u03bdq \u2211 ReRp eik\u00b7Re+iq\u00b7Rp \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304 (U\u0302k+q)nn\u0304\n\u00d7 (U\u0302\u2020k)m\u0304m \u2211 \u03bd\u0304 (\u0398\u0302\u2020q)\u03bd\u0304\u03bdgn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 ,\n(A7)\nwhere we have invoked the property \u2211\nR e ik\u00b7R = \u03b4k0N 3. Likewise, applying the inverse transformation leads to\ngn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 =N \u22126 \u2211 kq e\u2212ik\u00b7Re\u2212iq\u00b7Rp \u2211 nm (U\u0302\u2020k+q)n\u0304n\n\u00d7 (U\u0302k)mm\u0304 \u2211 \u03bd \u221a 2\u03c9\u03bdq(\u0398\u0302q)\u03bd\u03bd\u0304gnmkq\u03bd . (A8)\nEq. (A7) and Eq. (A8) as reciprocal relations have been utilized in the Wannier-Fourier interpolation scheme to calculate the electron-phonon interactions in a dense reciprocal-space grid based on the original ab initio data in a coarse grid79. In the following, we provide a similar relation between gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 and unmkq\u03bd .\nFor the convenience of derivation, we divide J\u0302el\u2212ph into\ntwo parts, J\u0302el\u2212ph = J\u0302 (1) el\u2212ph + J\u0302 (2) el\u2212ph, where\nJ\u0302 (l) el\u2212ph = i[H\u0302el\u2212ph, P\u0302 (l)] (A9)\nwith l = 1, 2. Substituting Eq. (A3) and Eq. (A5) into Eq. (A9) and using the property\n[c\u0302\u2020i c\u0302j , c\u0302 \u2020 k c\u0302l] = \u03b4jk c\u0302 \u2020 i c\u0302l \u2212 \u03b4ilc\u0302 \u2020 k c\u0302j , (A10)\nit is straightforward to obtain the following real-space expression for the first part\nJ\u0302 (1) el\u2212ph = ie \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304Re \u2211 \u03bd\u0304Rp \u2211 R (rm\u0304 \u2212 rn\u0304 + Re)gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304\n\u00d7 Q\u0302\u03bd\u0304,R+Rp \u2297 c\u0302 \u2020 n\u0304Rc\u0302m\u0304,R+Re .\n(A11)\nIt is noted that Eq. (A11) is very similar to Eq. (A5). The only differences are the presence of the prefactor ie\n18\nand the relative distance (rm\u0304 \u2212 rn\u0304 + Re). Applying the Wannier-to-Bloch transformation, Eqs. (16) and (A6), to Eq. (A11), we arrive at the following reciprocal-space expression\nJ\u0302 (1) el\u2212ph = eN \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk \u2211 \u03bdq u (1) nmkq\u03bd c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk\u2297 B\u0302\u03bdq, (A12)\nwhere\nu (1) nmkq\u03bd = i\u221a 2\u03c9\u03bdq \u2211 ReRp eik\u00b7Re+iq\u00b7Rp \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304 (rm\u0304 \u2212 rn\u0304 + Re)\n\u00d7 (U\u0302k+q)nn\u0304(U\u0302\u2020k)m\u0304m \u2211 \u03bd\u0304 (\u0398\u0302\u2020q)\u03bd\u0304\u03bdgn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304\n(A13)\nis the main component of unmkq\u03bd . Comparing Eq. (A13)\nwith Eq. (A8), we can immediately find that u (1) nmkq\u03bd = \u2207kgnmkq\u03bd if there is only one single electronic band. In the multiple-band situation, this relation is no longer valid.\nFollowing the same straightforward but tedious procedure, the second part of J\u0302el\u2212ph can be cast into\nJ\u0302 (2) el\u2212ph = eN \u2212 32 \u2211 nmk \u2211 \u03bdq u (2) nmkq\u03bd c\u0302 \u2020 n,k+qc\u0302mk \u2297 B\u0302\u03bdq,\n(A14)\nwhere\nu (2) nmkq\u03bd = i\u221a 2\u03c9\u03bdq \u2211 ReRp eik\u00b7Re+iq\u00b7Rp \u2211 n\u0304m\u0304 (U\u0302k+q)nn\u0304(U\u0302 \u2020 k)m\u0304m \u2211 \u03bd\u0304 (\u0398\u0302\u2020q)\u03bd\u0304\u03bd \u2211 n\u0304\u2032 6=m\u0304 rn\u0304\u2032m\u03040gn\u0304n\u0304\u2032ReRp\u03bd\u0304\n\u2212 \u2211 n\u0304\u2032 6=n\u0304 rn\u0304n\u0304\u20320gn\u0304\u2032m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 + \u2211 \u2206R6=0 \u2211 n\u0304\u2032 e\u2212ik\u00b7\u2206Rrn\u0304\u2032m\u0304\u2206Rgn\u0304n\u0304\u2032ReRp\u03bd\u0304 \u2212 \u2211 \u2206R 6=0 \u2211 n\u0304\u2032 e\u2212i(k+q)\u00b7\u2206Rrn\u0304n\u0304\u2032\u2206Rgn\u0304\u2032m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304\n (A15)\nis the other component of unmkq\u03bd . Eq. (A8) together with Eq. (A13) and Eq. (A15) provide a feasible way to compute unmkq\u03bd from gnmkq\u03bd . The concrete steps can be summarized as follows. First, perform first-principles calculations to acquire the electronic and phonon dispersions and the electron-phonon interaction parameters gnmkq\u03bd in a uniform reciprocal-space grid. The transformation matrix \u0398\u0302q between the realspace and reciprocal-space coordinates is simultaneously obtained during the calculation of the phonon normal modes. Second, use computational tools like the Wannier90 program87 to construct Bloch-to-Wannier transformation matrix U\u0302k and acquire rn\u0304 and rn\u0304m\u0304\u2206R. Third, calculate gn\u0304m\u0304ReRp\u03bd\u0304 according to Eq. (A8). Fourth, calculate u (1) nmkq\u03bd and u (2) nmkq\u03bd according to Eq. (A13) and Eq. (A15), respectively. Beneficial from the exponential localization of the maximally localized Wannier functions73, the above computational scheme can be used to calculate unmkq\u03bd at any points in the Brillouin zone for nonpolar materials by following the conventional Wannier-Fourier interpolation strategy73,79,80. As for polar materials like the titanium dioxide, special techniques toward the calculation of the Fro\u0308hlich vertex should be addressed52."
