    "abstractText": "In this paper, we introduce and study seven types of semantics for bipolar argumentation frameworks, each extending Dung\u2019s interpretation of attack with a distinct interpretation of support. First, we introduce three types of defence-based semantics by adapting the notions of defence. Second, we examine two types of selection-based semantics that select extensions by counting the number of supports. Third, we analyse two types of traditional reduction-based semantics under deductive and necessary interpretations of support. We provide full analysis of twenty-eight bipolar argumentation semantics and ten principles.",

            "text": "In this paper, we consider so-called bipolar argumentation frameworks [13,14,15] containing not only attacks but also supports among arguments. While there is general agreement in the formal argumentation literature on how to interpret attack, even when different kinds of semantics have been defined, there is much less consensus on how to interpret support [18]. There exist very few results and studies about the role of support in abstract argumentation. Consequently, the principle-based approach is used to bring structure to the field [16,42]. In this paper, we address the following research questions: In which ways can support affect attack, defence and argumentation semantics? Which principles can be introduced to distinguish between, and characterise, these semantics?\nThere exist different approaches to extending Dung\u2019s abstract theory by taking into consideration the support relation. The relation between support and attack has been studied extensively in reduction-based approaches, in the sense that deductive and necessary interpretations of support give rise to various notions of indirect attack [16], thus, they typically give opposite results. Deductive support [8] captures the intuition that if\nL. Yu and C. Al Anaissy contributed equally to this work.\na supports b, then the acceptance of a implies the acceptance of b. This intuition is characterised by the so-called closure principle [16]. Necessary support [29] captures the intuition that if a supports b, then the acceptance of a is necessary to obtain the acceptance of b, or equivalently, the acceptance of b implies the acceptance of a. It has been characterised by the inverse closure principle [33]. Another approach to handling support is the evidence-based approach [31] where the notion of evidential support is introduced. An argument cannot stand unless it is supported by evidential support. Support can also be seen as an inference relation between the premises and the conclusion of the argument itself [35]. Moreover, in selection-based approaches [23], support is used only to select some of the extensions provided in Dung\u2019s semantics, and thus does not change the definition of attack, or defence.\nDespite the relevance and significance of all the mentioned approaches, we think that there is still the need to explore other approaches that have not been yet considered for bipolar argumentation frameworks. The aim of our research is not to replace other approaches but rather to point to the existence of other interesting ones that can be applied depending on the chosen application. Note that our approach is novel in its methodology. On one hand, reduction-based approaches can be seen as a kind of pre-processing step for Dung\u2019s theory of abstract argumentation (i.e. adding the complex attacks and then applying Dung\u2019s semantics). On the other hand, selection-based approaches can be seen as a kind of post-processing step (i.e. applying Dung\u2019s semantics and then applying the approach to select some of the extensions). Differently from those two groups of approaches, our approach (i.e. the defence-based approach) does not affect the concept of attack and conflict-freeness, but rather changes the definition of defence.\nMost of the principles we introduce and use for analysing bipolar argumentation are in the same spirit as the principles used in the principle-based analysis of Dung\u2019s semantics [40]. For example, the robustness of argumentation semantics when adding or removing attacks plays a central role [39]. In this paper, we consider robustness when adding or removing support relations. We also introduce some principles specifically defined for support, such as to which extent an argument is accepted while receiving support from others.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. We first introduce three defence-based semantics, then two selection-based ones, and we study two traditional reduction-based ones. Then, we introduce ten principles, and we analyse which properties are satisfied by which semantics, before concluding and introducing the ideas for future work."

A bipolar argumentation framework (BAF) is a triple \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9 where Ar is a finite set called arguments, and att,sup \u2286 Ar\u00d7Ar are binary relations over Ar called attack and support respectively.\nFigure 1 illustrates three BAFs, where attack relations are depicted by solid arrows, and support relations are depicted by dashed arrows.

            "text": "We first define three new types of defence-based semantics, which are based on conflictfree0 and the new definitions of defended1, defended2 and defended3. To have a generic definition of defence-based semantics (Definition 5), we also define conflict-free1, conflict-free2, and conflict-free3, for each of the new types of semantics. The three notions of defended have stronger requirements than defended0. Defended1 requires that the argument defending0 another argument also supports it. Defended2 requires that a defender is supported. Moreover, defended3 requires not only that the attackers are attacked, but also that all supporters of the attackers are attacked as well.\nDefinition 3 (Conflict-free1\u22123 and Defended1\u22123). Let F= \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9 be a BAF. We use the same definition as Dung for conflict-free, i.e. c f1 \u2261 c f2 \u2261 c f3 \u2261 c f0. Moreover:\nFollowing Dung\u2019s approach,we say the characteristic function di(F,E) of a bipolar argumentation framework BAF is as follows:\n\u2013 di(F,E) : 2Ar \u2192 2Ar, \u2013 di(F,E) = {A |A is defendedi by E}, for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.\nDefinition 4 (Admissibility0\u22123). A set of arguments E in BAF F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, is said to be admissiblei iff E is conflict-freei and E \u2286 di(F,E), for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.\nTo define the complete (abbreviated as c), preferred (p), and stable (s) semantics of bipolar argumentation frameworks, the following definition is generic and can be used with any kind of conflict-freeness and defence.\nDefinition 5 (Semantics0\u22123). An extension-based semantics \u03c3 is a function that maps a BAF F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9 onto a set of subsets of Ar, written as \u03c3 xi (F), where i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}, x \u2208 {c, p,s} as follows:\n\u2013 \u03c3 ci (F) = {E \u2286 Ar | c fi(F,E) and di(F,E) = E}; \u2013 \u03c3 pi (F) = {E \u2286 Ar | E is admissiblei, and for all admissiblei set E \u2032,E \u2288 E \u2032}; \u2013 \u03c3 si (F) = {E \u2286 Ar | E is admissiblei, and for all arguments a not in E, there is an\nargument b in E attacking a}.\nMost of the following propositions were introduced and proved for semantics0 by Dung (1995). We prove that the above three new defence semantics are able to conserve the relations among completei, preferredi, and groundedi for i \u2208 {1,2,3} and stablei for i = 3.\nLemma 1 (Fundamental Lemma). Let E be an admissiblei set of arguments, and A1 and A2 be two arguments which are defendedi by E. Then for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}, we have the following:\n\u2013 E \u2032 = E \u222a{A1} is admissiblei. \u2013 A2 is defendedi by E \u2032.\nThe following theorem follows directly from the Fundamental Lemma.\nTheorem 1. Let F be a BAF, for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}:\n\u2013 The set of all admissiblei sets of F forms a complete partial order with respect to set inclusion. \u2013 For each admissiblei set S of F, there exists a preferredi extension E of F such that S \u2286 E.\nNote that the empty set is always admissiblei, we have the following Corollary for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}:\nCorollary 1. There exists at least one preferredi extension in any bipolar argumentation framework for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.\nProposition 1. For i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}, we have the following: every completei extension is also admissiblei; every preferredi extension is also completei; every stablei extension is also preferredi.\nProposition 2. The characteristic function di(F,E) is monotonic (with respect to set inclusion) for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}.\nProposition 3. Any BAF F induces a complete lattice which is the power set of all the arguments in F. The characteristic function di(F,E), i \u2208 {0,1,2,3}, is monotonic (with respect to set inclusion). Therefore, from Knaster\u2013Tarski theorem:\n\u2013 The set of fixed points of di(F,E) is a complete lattice. \u2013 di(F,E) has a unique least fixed point which can be obtained either by doing the\nintersection of all the fixed points of di(F,E), or by iteratively applying di(F,E), to the empty set.\nDefinition 6 (Grounded0\u22123 semantics). The groundedi extension of a BAF F= \u27e8Ar,att, sup\u27e9, is the least fixed point of the characteristic function di(F,E), for i\u2208 {0,1,2,3}.We denote the groundedi semantics by \u03c3gi (F).\nProposition 4. The groundedi extension of F for i \u2208 {0,1,2,3} is the minimal (with respect to set inclusion) complete extension of F.\nWe now give a real legal example to illustrate the intuition behind semantics1. This example deals with a neighbor\u2019s quarrel over a row of conifers and was used to explain how the judge defends the claimant\u2019s interest [32].\nExample 1 (Neighbours\u2019 quarrel over conifers). (...) The defendant argues that the conifers have been planted to reduce draught in his house, but this argument is absolutely unsound since most of the window posts are closed and the window that does open is located on a point higher than the tops of the conifers and has not been fitted with any anti-draught facilities. (...) Whereas the defendant has no considerable interest in these conifers, removal is of significant concern to the claimant since they block his view and take away the light. (...) (2981. Country court Enschede 6 October 1988)\nThe judge defends the standpoint that the claimant\u2019s interest in the removal of the conifers is greater than the defendant\u2019s interest in leaving them untouched. In the judge\u2019s preceding remarks, he mentions the defendant\u2019s argument: he does have a considerable interest in the conifers since they reduce draught in his house, thus he wants to keep the conifers. To support the standpoint of the claimant and against the defendant, the judge argues that the conifers block the view and take away the light, most of the window posts are closed and the opening window, which has no anti-draught facilities whatsoever, is located higher than the tops of the conifers.\nAs stated by Plug: \u201cthe judge\u2019s argumentation consists of a pro-argument and the refutation of a counter-argument which, in conjunction, form sufficient support for his standpoint.\" This type of defence inspires semantics1.\nWe now give an example to illustrate the intuition behind semantics2.\nExample 2 (Twelve Angry Men play using Semantics2). We consider an example extracted from the NoDE benchmark [10], which consists of annotated datasets extracted from a variety of sources (Debatepedia, Procon, Wikipedia web pages and the script of \u201cTwelve Angry Men\u201d play), where the aim of this benchmark is to analyse the support and attack relations between the arguments. We explore the Twelve Angry Men\ndataset, this play is about a jury consisting of twelve men who must decide whether a young man is guilty or not for murdering his father. Consider the following arguments extracted from this dataset.\n\u2013 a1: I think we proved that the old man couldn\u2019t have heard the boy say, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\" but supposing he really did hear it? This phrase: how many times has each of you used it? Probably hundreds. \u201cIf you do that once more, Junior, I\u2019m going to murder you.\" \u201cCome on, Rocky, kill him!\" We say it every day. This doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to kill someone. \u2013 e1: The phrase was \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\" and the kid screamed it out at the top of his lungs. Anybody says a thing like that the way he said it\u2014they mean it. \u2013 g1: Do you really think the boy would shout out a [\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\"] so the whole neighbourhood would hear it? I don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s much too bright for that.\nThe example above is shown in Figure 2. In this example, argument g1 attacks argument e1 by raising some doubt about it. In the same manner, argument e1 attacks argument a1. We can see that the argument g1 defends argument a1 in Dung\u2019s sense. Just because argument g1 is not attacked, argument a1 is accepted.\nIn a legal case, any given argument must be evaluated based on the evidence provided to support it. In the absence of such evidence, the presence of at least a support, even if it is challenged, seems necessary. Therefore, one can ask themselves whether Dung\u2019s notion of defence seems enough, in this case, to say that the argument g1 defends the argument a1. Hence, for this kind of application, one might want to use a stronger notion of defence. An example of such a notion is our semantics2, where an argument must be supported in order to be able to defend another argument. The idea behind this semantics is to provide a stronger and more restrictive defence notion than Dung\u2019s defence notion, by taking into account the support relation.\nWe consider now the following arguments extracted from the same dataset, to illustrate semantics2.\n\u2013 f : Maybe he didn\u2019t hear [the boy yelling \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\"]. I mean with the el noise. \u2013 g: [The old man cannot be a liar, he must have heard the boy yelling \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\"]. \u2013 h: It stands to reason, [the old man can be a liar]. \u2013 i: Attention, maybe [the old man is a liar].\nContrary to the previous example, we see that argument i is supported by another one, hence it might be seen as having a better capacity to defend f . Formally, the set of arguments {h, i} defends2 the argument f .\nExample 3 (Recruitment using semantics3). Consider the following arguments.\n\u2013 a: Alice should be hired as a professor. \u2013 b: Alice lacks many essential qualifications to become a professor. \u2013 c: Alice has few publications. \u2013 d: Alice has recently got her PhD, she does not have enough teaching experience.\n\u2013 e: All of Alice\u2019s publications are in top conferences. When it comes to publications, quality beats quantity.\n\u2013 f : Alice has taught 64 hours of practical works during every year of her PhD, which is considered enough as teaching experience.\n\u2013 g: Alice is good at team work, she also has an excellent academic carrier, these two enable her to become a professor.\nThis example can be represented with the BAF depicted on the left-hand side of Figure 3. g fails to reinstate a because g does not attack b\u2019s supporters c and d. The set of arguments {e,g, f} reinstates a because it attacks all the supporters of b. \u03c3 c,g,p,s3 (F) = {{a,e,g, f}}."

Semantics5 selects the extensions that receive the most support from outside, reflecting the idea that the more support a coalition receives, the stronger it is. It thus interprets support as a kind of voting.\nWe say that argument b in E is internally supported if b receives support from arguments in E. Argument b in E is externally supported if b receives support from arguments that are outside E.\nDefinition 7 (Number of Internal and External Supports). Let F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9 be a BAF.

The set of robustness principles was proposed by Rienstra et al. [38]. Here, we adapt their idea to bipolar argumentation in order to investigate the robustness of bipolar argumentation semantics when removing and adding support. Principle 3 states that if two arguments a and b are in an extension E such that a supports b, then E is still an extension after we remove the support from a to b.\nPrinciple 3 (Internal Support Removal Robustness) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the internal support removal robustness principle iff for all BAFs F= \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), if arguments a,b \u2208 E and a supports b, then E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (Ar,att,sup\\{(a,b)}).\nPrinciple 4 states that if argument a is not in an extension E and argument b is in this extension E such that a supports b, then E is still an extension after we remove the support from a to b.\nPrinciple 4 (External Support Removal Robustness) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the external support removal robustness principle iff for all BAFs F= \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), if argument a \u2208 Ar \\E supports argument b \u2208 E, then E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (Ar,att,sup\\{(a,b)}).\nPrinciple 5 and Principle 6 both concern the closure under the support relation. Closure says that if an argument is in an extension, the arguments it supports are also in the extension, while inverse closure says the opposite, i.e. if an argument is in an extension, the arguments supporting it should also be in the extension [8,15,33].\nPrinciple 5 (Closure) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the closure principle iff for all BAFs F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), if (a,b) \u2208 sup and a \u2208 E, then b \u2208 E.\nPrinciple 6 (Inverse Closure) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the inverse closure principle iff for all BAFs F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), if (a,b) \u2208 sup and b \u2208 E, then a \u2208 E.\nPrinciple 7 reflects the idea that if there is no support relation, the extensions under semantics \u03c3 xi are equivalent to the ones in Dung semantics.\nPrinciple 7 (Extension Equivalence) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the extension equivalence principle iff for all BAFs F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, \u03c3 xi (Ar,att, /0) = \u03c3 x0 (Ar,att, /0).\nPrinciple 8 and Principle 9 both state the positive effect of supports on the supported arguments. We first present the definition of the status of arguments as introduced by Baroni and Giacomin [3]. Extension-based semantics classifies arguments into three statuses, namely sceptically accepted, credulously accepted, and rejected.\nDefinition 11. (Status of an Argument [3]) Let F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9 be a BAF. If the set of extensions is empty, all the arguments are declared to be rejected. Otherwise, we say that an argument is: (1) sceptically accepted if it belongs to all extensions; (2) credulously accepted if it is not sceptically accepted and it belongs to at least one extension; (3) rejected if it does not belong to any extension.\nGargouri et al. [23] write Status(a,F) = sk(resp. cr,re j), and they define the order \u2a7d on the set of statuses as expected: sk > cr > re j. We denote the set of sceptically accepted (resp. credulously accepted, rejected) arguments of a BAF by Sk(Ar,att,sup) (resp. Cr(Ar,att,sup), Re j(Ar,att,sup). Principle 8 states that adding supports to arguments does not change their status into a lower order. Gargouri et al. [23] call this monotony, but we prefer to use a more specific name (i.e. monotony of status) to make it more precise and avoid ambiguity.\nPrinciple 8 (Monotony of Status) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the monotony of status principle iff for all BAFs F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), for all a,b \u2208 Ar, we have Status (a,\u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9) \u2a7d Status(a,\u27e8Ar,att,sup\u222a{(b,a)}\u27e9).\nPrinciple 9 shows a skeptically accepted argument stays skeptically accepted when supports are added [25].\nPrinciple 9 (Extension Growth) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the extension growth principle iff for all BAFs F= \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every extension E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F), it holds that Sk(Ar,att,sup)\u2286 Sk(Ar,att,sup\u222a sup\u2032).\nDirectionality is introduced by Baroni, Giacomin, and Guida [4]. It reflects the idea that we can decompose an argumentation framework into sub-frameworks so that the semantics can be defined locally. For the directionality principle, they first introduce the definition of an unattacked and unsupported set.\nDefinition 12 (Unattacked and unsupported arguments in BAF). Given a BAF F= \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, a set U is unattacked and unsupported if and only if there exists no a \u2208 Ar\\U such that a attacks U or a supports U. The set unattacked and unsupported sets in F is denoted US(F) (U for short).\nPrinciple 10 (BAF Directionality) A semantics \u03c3 xi for BAFs satisfies the BAF directionality principle iff for every BAF F = \u27e8Ar,att,sup\u27e9, for every U \u2208 US(F), it holds that \u03c3 xi (F\u2193U ) = {E \u2229U |E \u2208 \u03c3 xi (F)}, where F\u2193U = (U,att \u2229U \u00d7U,sup\u2229U \u00d7U) is a projection, and \u03c3 xi (F\u2193U ) are the extensions of the projection.\nTable 1 compares the semantics with respect to the principles. For the defencebased semantics, semantics1 and semantics2 can be classified by the same principles, and they can be distinguished from semantics3 by Principles 3, 7 and 9. Semantics4\nand semantics5 are selected from semantics0, they can be distinguished by Principle 3 and Principle 4. However, Table 1 indicates it is not the case that if semantics0 satisfies a principle implies semantics4 and semantics5 also satisfy it, e.g. the results regarding Principle 10. Reduction-based semantics can be distinguished from others by Principles 1, 5, 6 and 8. More precisely, they themselves can be further distinguished by Principle 5 and 6, and surprisingly, only semantics7 satisfies Principle 8. One thing worth noting is that, in the literature, there are two other reductions based on necessary interpretation of support, i.e. one introduces only secondary attacks and the other introduces only extended attacks. Both of them do not satisfy directionality [42]. However, the result in this paper shows when the necessary reduction induces both secondary and extended attacks, semantics7 (except for stable7) satisfy directionality."

            "text": "The notion of support has drawn the attention of many scholars in argumentation theory, including the role of support in argumentation, whether attack and support should be treated as equals, the link between the abstract approaches and ASPIC+, and also higher-order abstract bipolar argumentation frameworks [36,37,24,11]. We now review and comment on the three approaches to define semantics studied in this paper. For the defence-based approach, we adapted the core notions in Dung\u2019s theory. There are other variants of semantics that adapt these notions, such as weak defence for weak admissibility semantics [7,20], but it is not related to the notion of support. For selection-based approach, semantics4 and semantics5 select extensions based on the number of internal (or external) supports received respectively. Such an approach has already been used in some previous work, and most of them are based on preference [2,25] or weight of arguments and relations [19,26]. More recently, Gargouri et al. proposed an approach to select the best extensions to BAFs by comparing the number of received supports with scores for each extension [23]. The reduction-based approach allows a BAF to be\ntransformed into an argumentation graph that has been already discussed in the literature [16,30,36,11]. There is a striking similarity at the abstract level between support in bipolar argumentation and preference-based argumentation, as both can be seen as reductions, as well as both can be used to select extensions [25]. For other approaches to bipolar argumentation semantics, Cayrol et al. proposed some properties of gradual semantics for bipolar argumentation [12], after which Evripidou and Toni provided a concrete definition of gradual semantics for bipolar argumentation [22] and introduced the quantitative argumentation debate (QuAD) framework [6]. Concerning aggregating bipolar argumentation frameworks, Chen considered how to cope with different opinions on support relations and analyse which properties can be preserved by desirable aggregation rules during aggregation of support relations [17]. Lauren et al. also considered aggregating bipolar assumption-based argumentation frameworks under the assumption that agents propose the same set of arguments, different sets of attacks and different interpretations of supporting arguments [28].\nBaroni and Giacomin are the first to adopt a principle-based approach for classifying argumentation semantics [3], which was followed by other papers axiomatising abstract argumentation [40], preference-based argumentation [25] and agent argumentation [41]. There are papers that propose principles for bipolar ranking-based/gradual semantics [1], and their generalisations [5]. However, there is a lack of such work for extension-based semantics. Cayrol et al. compared bipolar argumentation semantics, they discussed the semantics based on deductive and necessary interpretations, and provided a few properties, e.g. closure, coherence and safe [16]. Inspired by this work, Yu and van der Torre analysed reduction-based semantics with more properties [42], however, they have only considered reduction-based semantics, without comparing them with others."

            "text": "In this paper, we gave an axiomatic analysis of bipolar argumentation semantics. We considered three approaches, namely defence-based, selection-based, and reductionbased approaches. In total, we introduced seven different types of semantics and studied them together with Dung semantics, which is the baseline and does not take into account supports. Semantics1\u22123 are defence-based, i.e. they are defined by generalising the new notions of defence. Such an approach allows us to treat attack and support at the same level. Semantics4 and semantics5 are not only based on admissibility, but also borrow the idea from another field, i.e. social voting, to use the number of supports as a way of voting or selecting to derive extensions. Semantics6 and semantics7 are based on the notions of necessary and deductive support respectively. We evaluated those semantics against the set of ten principles. The results are shown in Table 1. Given the diversity of interpretations of support, such axiomatic analysis can provide us an overview and systematic assessment of different approaches. It can help us to choose a semantics for a given task or a particular application in function of the desirable properties. One can look at the table and see if there exists a semantics that satisfies the given desiderata.\nAn interesting question for future work is how to relate semantics defined by various approaches, e.g. can we define a new defence with attacks and supports indicating\nthe deductive, necessary or evidential interpretation of support? We have semantics2 stating that only a supported argument can defend others, which also reflects the idea of evidential support [30,34]. In this paper, we use dynamic properties, e.g. the robustness of semantics when adding and removing support. This could be further developed by analyzing labelling-based semantics of bipolar argumentation. The distinction between arguments labelled out and undecided makes the principles more precise. We also consider that the approaches to the dynamics of argumentation can be used as a source for principles [9,25]. Another possible direction is to study the relation between the principles, for example, to verify whether one principle implies another one, or if there is a set of principles such that no semantics satisfies all of them. Lastly, in the same spirit of this paper, another future work is the principle-based analysis of higher-order bipolar argumentation frameworks [27]."
