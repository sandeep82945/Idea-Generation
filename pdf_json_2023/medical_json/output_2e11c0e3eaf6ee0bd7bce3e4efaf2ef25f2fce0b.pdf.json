    "abstractText": "People living with kidney disease are among the most vulnerable at times of natural or man-made disasters. In addition to their unpredictable course, armed conflicts impose a major threat given the disruption of infrastructure, sanitation and access to food, water and medical care. The ongoing war in Ukraine has once more demonstrated the importance of preparedness, organization, coordination and solidarity during disasters. People living with kidney disease face serious challenges given their dependence on life-sustaining treatment, irrespective of whether they remain in the war zone or are displaced internally or externally. This especially affects those requiring kidney replacement therapy, dialysis or transplantation, but also patients with other kidney diseases and the medical staff who care for them. Soon after the war started, the European Renal Association assigned a Renal Disaster Relief Task Force dedicated to support the people living with kidney disease and the nephrology community in Ukraine. This report summarizes the major challenges faced, actions taken and lessons learned by this task force. We anticipate that the experience will help to increase preparedness and mitigate the devastating effects of armed conflicts on the kidney community in the future and propose to establish an international collaboration to extend this effort to other parts of the world facing similar challenges.",

People living with kidney disease face serious challenges given their dependence on life-sustaining treatment, irrespective of whether they remain in the war zone or are displaced internally or externally. This especially affects those requiring kidney replacement therapy, dialysis or transplantation, but also patients with other kidney diseases and the medical staff who care for them. Soon after the war started, the European Renal Association assigned a Renal Disaster Relief Task Force dedicated to support the people living with kidney disease and the nephrology community in Ukraine. This report summarizes the major challenges faced, actions taken and lessons learned by this task force.

Vulnerable people, especially the elderly, women, children, the frail and the chronically ill, are more severely affected during disasters. These groups should receive specific attention to increase their survival chances. Among these, patients in need of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) compose a small but particularly vulnerable group comprising <1% of the population [3\u20135].

One of the major differences between armed conflicts and natural disasters is that in armed conflicts, the extent and the duration are not predictable. Conflicts may last for years, necessitating a sustainable relief plan.\nIn this report we aim to evaluate the interventions of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force (RDRTF) of the European Renal Association (ERA) during the war in Ukraine and to make proposals for more effective renal relief and rescue strategies for similar future catastrophes."

            "text": "The link between disasters and acute kidney injury (AKI) has been well recognized for more than a century [6, 7]. The RDRTF of the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) [8] was founded following the 1988 Armenian Spitak earthquake, when a large number of patients with crush syndrome died due to insufficient dialysis availability. Consequently, the term \u2018renal disaster\u2019 was introduced [8, 9]. The RDRTF, in close collaboration with M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), was instrumental in saving the lives of a substantial number\nof AKI patients in subsequent earthquakes [10, 11]. Since then, the world has faced many natural [12\u201315] and manmade [16] disasters, where threats to life occur across the spectrum of patients with kidney diseases and hence the term \u2018disaster nephrology\u2019 [17] was introduced. Challenges and approaches to such disasters have been highlighted previously and strategies continue to be adapted and improved [16, 18\u201330].\nThe recent armed conflict in Ukraine drew attention once more to the importance of preparedness for such unanticipated disasters. Appropriately, the theme of World Kidney Day 2023 is \u2018Kidney Health for All\u2014Preparing for the unexpected, supporting the vulnerable!\u2019, aiming to raise awareness about disastrous events, whether natural or man-made, international or local, and their impact on people living with kidney disease who depend on appropriate diagnostic services, treatment and care [31].\nERA IN THE UKRAINIAN CRISIS"

            "text": "On 24 February 2022, the world was shaken by the attack of Russia on Ukraine, which triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Action on Armed Violence reported that three hospitals were destroyed in the regions of Donetsk (Vuhledar and Mariupol) and Kyiv associated with injuries and deaths (Fig. 1) [32]. As of November 2022, nearly 7.8 million refugees fleeing Ukraine have been recorded across Europe, while an estimated 8 million people have been displaced within the country [33].\nAccording to theUkrainian Renal Registry, in January 2021, 11 181 patients (268 per million population) were on KRT:\nLessons learned during the war in Ukraine: report from the RDRTF 1961\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/article/38/9/1960/7080159 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n6017 on haemodialysis (HD), 2700 on haemodiafiltration, 931 on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 1533 living with a functioning kidney transplant [34].\nAs the leading nephrology society in Europe, the ERA was deeply concerned about the possible consequences of this attack and immediately condemned the invasion [35]. The ERA Council appointed a Renal Disaster Relief Task Force (RDRTF) dedicated to finding ways to provide help to all Ukrainian patients with kidney diseases and healthcare workers. The RDRTF was started shortly after the invasion (17 March 2022), but unfortunately did not have the chance to meet and prepare for the upcoming war beforehand. The members of the RDRTF are adult and paediatric nephrologists, representatives of the European Dialysis and Transplantation Nurses Association/European Renal Care Association (EDTNA/ERCA) and representatives of the European Kidney Patients Federation (EKPF).\nPreparedness is the key to mitigate disaster-related chaos [36, 37]. The need for coordination has been emphasized previously [36, 37]. The RDRTF applied the appropriate coordination model, ensuring rapid communication between the RDRTF coordinator and the key contact people in the affected country, enabling rapid action and pragmatic decisions. The RDRTF decided to use this approach, which had previously proven successful in cases of natural disasters [36, 37] and at the first RDRTF meeting after the general overview of the situation in Ukraine, tasks were immediately assigned among the members, mainly regarding communications with representatives of Ukrainian Society of Nephrology, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health (MOH), the European Commission, pharmaceutical companies, dialysis industry representatives, The World Health Organization (WHO), NGOs in the field (e.g. MSF) and humanitarian aid organizations (e.g. Caritas and Direct Relief).\nThe initial aim was to collect information regarding patient numbers in Ukraine and outside, functional therapeutic capacity, urgent needs and possibilities for donations or procurement of supplies and determining how to achieve regular and safe supply delivery. The information collected was shared with the coordinator/chair of the RDRTF, who briefed the other RDRTF members through frequent mail updates as has been suggested in previous disasters.\nThe European Union (EU) Temporary Protection Directive [38] was activated in February 2022, ensuring free-of-charge treatment for all patients fromUkraine in EU countries. At the end of the first RDRTF meeting, the members considered an approach to prioritize the evacuation of patients on KRT to EU countries where they could be cared for. However, soon it became obvious that many patients were reluctant to leave, mostly due to feelings of insecurity and a hesitancy to be separated from their families and regular caregivers.\nRepresentatives of the Ukrainian MOH,WHO andMSF, as well as the presidents of the adult and paediatric Ukrainian Societies of Nephrology and representatives from the dialysis industry were promptly identified and invited to participate in RDRTF meetings. This helped the RDRTF members to better understand the Ukrainian conditions and requests and how the needs in Ukraine could be met. Dialysis industry\nrepresentatives included those who operated dialysis units in Ukraine or in neighbouring countries and those providing supplies for those units.\nThe major conclusions were:\n\u2022 Most dialysis units except three were operational, one of which was disrupted due to a bomb attack and the other two were disconnected fromwater and electricity service. \u2022 Most patients in the eastern part of Ukraine were displaced to cities in western Ukraine (Lviv, IvanoFrankivsk, Chernivci, Uzhgorod). \u2022 Medications for CKD management, including heparin, intravenous iron, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were lacking. \u2022 Immunosuppressive medications including, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids were urgently needed. \u2022 External human resource assistance was not requested since local and displaced Ukrainian healthcare workers continued to work.\nA recent article on how the war in Ukraine affected dialysis provision sheds further light on the human suffering and organizational challenges during times of armed conflict [29, 34, 39].\nGiven the unpredictability of this armed conflict, the feasibility of relying on donations to sustainablymeet themedical needs was limited, although some early donations were obtained. Furthermore, the WHO, NGOs and the European Commission raised funds to purchase dialysis equipment and other supplies as part of humanitarian aid. The RDRTF collected and provided updated information to key organizations such as the WHO, which was used by the RDRTF to facilitate its own advocacy on behalf of people living with kidney disease (as well as other complex non-communicable diseases) and to catalyse the provision of medical supplies through networking between the stakeholders. The safe delivery of requested materials to specific destinations proved difficult under the armed conflict conditions. A detailed account of the contributing professional societies, NGOs and humanitarian aid organizations helping Ukrainian patients with kidney diseases during the war in Ukraine is provided in Table 1.\nDuring the initial months of the conflict, the RDRTF had weekly meetings with colleagues representing the Ukrainian nephrology community. This permitted regular updating of their needs and requests as well as informing the RDRTFmembers about the ongoing situation. The Ukrainian Association of Nephrologists and Transplantologists created a Ukrainian Renal Disaster Relief Committee and representatives joined the RDRTF meetings.\nIn addition to unavailability of specific medications, other challenges arose related to the inability to measure immunosuppressant blood levels and a lack of infrastructure and materials needed for histopathologic examinations and some simple biochemistry tests. The devaluation of the Ukrainian currency resulted in an acute increase in the cost of all medical supplies, which have thus become largely unaffordable.\nAccess to immunosuppressive medication for transplant patients has generally not been a problem until the present,\n1962 S.

Until now, transplantation practice has continued in Ukraine, even under war conditions. There has not been a report of an increased incidence of infection, acute rejection or other complications among renal transplant recipients.\nFollowing the recent missile and drone attacks on power stations and the distribution grid in Ukraine, the electric system has been brought to a crisis, leading to prolonged restrictions on electricity consumption. Since HD units rely on electricity supplies, as an alternative dialysis method, some patients were converted to PD (personal communication from Dr. Dmytro Ivanov). PD has previously been successfully applied in other war conditions as well as during natural disasters. This has been especially emphasized for paediatric patients, but it is certainly a viable option for adult patients as well [21, 40\u201342]. Energy supply problems also impact access to medical records and thus access to patient histories and current therapy.\nAdvocating for patients with kidney diseases The joint declaration of the ISN, American Society of Nephrology (ASN) and ERA at the beginning of the war continued with further collaboration across the global kidney community. A podcast organized by the ASN generated much interest from the nephrology community and a special \u2018Kidney fund\u2019 was started by Direct Relief, a US-based NGO that has ample experience in providing humanitarian aid to disaster zones and armed conflict areas. This initiative enabled the RDRTF to directly focus and support provision of the necessary medications needed to the people living with kidney disease.\nThe RDRTF had the opportunity to participate in several meetings of the Directorate-General of Health (DG Sant\u00e9) of the European Commission, with the support of the European Kidney Health Alliance (EKHA). The EKHA is an advocacy agency working to increase awareness of kidney disease at the EU level, and had already highlighted the need to not\nLessons learned during the war in Ukraine: report from the RDRTF 1963\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/article/38/9/1960/7080159 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nforget patients on dialysis in support actions [43, 44]. The WHODepartment of Noncommunicable Diseases anticipated the plight of those living with kidney disease, especially those requiring dialysis, and spontaneously reached out early to RDRTF members. The collaboration with the WHO was key in earmarking funds for procurement of supplies through the UkrainianMOHand catalysing networkingwith organizations such as Direct Relief for direction of donations and procurement and delivery of supplies.\nCase for refugee patients Although the majority of patients on KRT preferred to stay within Ukraine in the early days, there was an increasing efflux of refugee patients to neighbouring countries over time that seemed to stabilize and was followed by a return to Ukraine as the conflict became chronic. At the beginning of September, 700 Ukrainian refugee patients on dialysis were displaced throughout Europe. Poland received the highest number of refugee dialysis patients (up to 270 patients), while Romania, Moldova, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Lithuania also hosted many refugee dialysis patients. For some patients, the displacement was further from Ukraine, mainly to Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Currently the RDRTF is trying to map the distribution of dialysis patients to provide insights into the reasons, challenges and health impacts of displacement through a dedicated survey, the results of which are still being analysed.\nEducational and advisory activities A special portion of the ERA website [45] has been created to offer support to Ukrainian patients as well as healthcare providers. The website includes information about dialysis centres in neighbouring countries, the EU Protection Directive and information for both patients and the medical staff to reduce uncertainties and improve safety. Given that young doctors in Ukraine had to take over responsibilities for managing complex kidney care cases, a series of case discussions on adult and paediatric patients was launched to provide support to our Ukrainian colleagues. The case discussions covered basic concepts as well as complex clinical challenges. The language challenge was overcome with the help of two Ukrainian expatriate nephrologists. This weekly virtual, interactive \u2018Clinical Case Discussion\u2019 series has proven very popular, with up to 70 participants providing constructive suggestions supporting daily medical practice in the current war conditions.\nAn all-hazards model can be the key Considering that all disasters share certain commonalities, an \u2018all-hazardsmodel\u2019 (i.e.managing different hazard scenarios with a common plan for hazard mitigation and preparedness) could offer a robust foundation for effective responses. An all-hazards tool was published by the WHO, which suggests key actions that need to be considered in responding to any disaster event. This tool proposes the use of a hospital emergency checklist (i.e. communication, safety and security,\ntriage, surge capacity, continuity of essential services, human resources, logistics and supply management), highlighting the importance of a well-functioning command and control system [46].\nFor a detailed description of the nephrological actions that can be undertaken in disasters, including wars, the interested reader is referred to several review papers in the literature, including the recent article published by the RDRTF [16, 27, 29\u201331, 36, 37, 43, 47\u201353]. Possible approaches are detailed in Fig. 2."

            "text": "Lessons learned in other disasters can be largely extrapolated to war situations, and some new lessons were learned. During the war in Ukraine we saw the verification of most in-war situations as well.\n1. Preparedness is crucial: Disasters may occur anywhere, and, because of their complex needs, preparation is vital to increase the chance of survival of patients with acute or chronic kidney disease. These preparations include medical and logistic planning in a disaster-free period. 2. The collaboration of national and international nephrology societies is essential: The RDRTF is a new organization that provided significant help and support during the recent Ukraine\u2013Russian conflict. The collaboration of national and international nephrology societies is essential for better preparedness and more effective intervention in renal disasters, in all regions of the world, especially in developing countries, which are frequently faced with wars and suffer from major healthcare problems not only during disasters, but also in routine practice. 3. Individual actions should not be encouraged in situations of armed conflict/war: During the course of the war in Ukraine there has not been a specific request for human resources. During armed conflicts it may not be safe to travel and work on a volunteer basis, and there may be language barriers as well as legislation problems even for healthcare staff. Therefore the RDRTF suggests that individual actions should not be encouraged under such conditions and alternative methods should be considered (telehealth, case discussions, WhatsApp groups) to support the care of patients locally. On the other hand, volunteers\u2019 support in neighbouring countries for the care of refugee patients may prove to be useful. 4. Help and support of international scientific societies and other NGOs are vital: Following mass disasters, governments and authorities face many practical problems and patients with kidney diseases do not always receive the necessary attention, leaving the local medical communities with a vast workload and responsibility. The help and support of international scientific societies and other NGOs are vital to support national societies and care providers in their efforts to care for patients with kidney diseases.\n1964 S. Tug\u0306lular et al.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/article/38/9/1960/7080159 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nFigure 2: Problems and consequences of mitigation/relief activities during disasters. Dialysis demand may increase, mostly due to acute dialysis needs in disaster-related AKI patients. Due to damage to dialysis centres and subsequent redistribution of their patients to the functioning units, dialysis patients may overload these centres. A shortage of dialysis material and personnel, in combination with organizational problems, cause a disparity between dialysis demand and supply. Training patients may allow them to adhere strictly to dietary restrictions, thus enabling less frequent dialysis, whereas training the nephrologists may be useful to decrease dialysis dose, thus increasing dialysis availability for the remaining patients. National and international dialysis material and personnel help may be useful to respond to the need for increased dialysis services. If these interventions are not efficient enough, the only remaining option would be referral of patients to unaffected regions of the country or abroad. Interventions and an advisory role of local nephrology societies and international support task forces are instrumental for all of these mitigation and relief efforts.\n5. Collaboration with the WHO and NGOs is crucial: Communication and partnership with the WHO, humanitarian aid organizations and other NGOs active in the affected country are crucial to bring the specific needs of patients with kidney diseases to the attention of these major organizations. These organizations may also already have or are able to raise specific funds for patients with kidney diseases 6. Collaboration with the highest local health authorities aligns efforts to help: TheMOH is the highest authority responsible for the functioning of the healthcare system. Most NGOs, as well as the WHO and EU, will accept official requests only from the MOH. This is also important for oversight of the allocation of limited sources. The MOH is also a valuable source of credible information. Good relations must be established with the highest health authority of the affected country, especially with the members responsible for the care of dialysis and transplant patients. 7. Establishment of local RDRTFs must be encouraged: The nephrology community in each country should be encouraged to create a local RDRTF, which should be in close contact with international nephrology societies. The RDRTF should include dialysis nurses\nand technicians as well as nephrologists. In a disasterfree period, local organizations should assign key contact people and substitutes to facilitate efficient intervention if a disaster does occur. These individuals should be easily reachable, prepare and update local disaster preparedness plans and organize local training programs in disaster nephrology, targeting each stakeholder (patients, physicians/nephrologists and dialysis units). Furthermore, under disaster conditions, these local RDRTF coordinators may provide valuable realtime information about the status and functionality of dialysis centres, availability of medications, major needs and requests. If a local RDRTF does not exist, it is worth considering that some countries have multiple nephrology societies and each should be contacted individually. 8. Patient organizations must be involved in disaster preparedness planning: It is crucial to include patient organizations in the process of preparing for future disasters. Their active participation will lead to a better understanding of the patients\u2019 perspectives and a better response to their needs. Patient education by any means (written, visual and social media, brochures, infographics, websites) is vital to\nLessons learned during the war in Ukraine: report from the RDRTF 1965\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ndt/article/38/9/1960/7080159 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nincrease survival probability. It would also be very useful for the patients to have a printed brief medical report, including their current treatment, in case of displacement. The ERA has established a special section for patients with kidney diseases on its website. However, despite the efforts of the RDRTF, we were unable to reach the patients\u2019 associations in Ukraine. This issue must be included in the efforts for preparation. 9. Dialysis and pharmaceutical industries should be included as important stakeholders: Dialysis and pharmaceutical industries are among the stakeholders of healthcare. The industry may be able to provide information about the functionality of supply chains and of dialysis units. They may also be able to provide help and donations of essential medications, especially in the early stages of the disaster. 10. Regular updating of the medical knowledge in disaster nephrology is one of the key elements of preparedness: The occurrence of disasters is sporadic, and unapplied medical knowledge is easily forgotten, therefore disaster nephrology courses should be included in medical and nursing curricula and continuing medical education activities. Preparation and dissemination of short and pragmatic guidelines and/or translating existing guidelines is effective in decreasing the risk of error and providing the most efficient treatment, which in turn increases the survival probability of people with acute and chronic kidney disease in disasters [50]. 11. Important legal information must be accessible to patients and medical staff: Important information like the legal rights to access healthcare systems in other countries, lists of dialysis centres in neighbouring countries as well as phone numbers and addresses of the closest dialysis centres in neighbouring countries, especially for displaced patients on dialysis, can be disseminated through the RDRTF and national society websites, ideally in the native language of the affected country. Disseminating important information through the most popular channels in the affected country may be important. 12. Adjustment of dialysis requirements to disaster (war) conditions may be needed: Adjustments in dialysis frequency or dose, switching from in-centre HD to PD or home HD and changes in immunosuppressive regimens should be considered in the case of shortages ofmedicalmaterial and personnel as well as restrictions in power supplies. If problems cannot be coped with once urgent care has been initiated, referral of the patient to a distant higher-level hospital may be lifesaving. However, patient evacuation should be attempted only after careful preparations and, if international, after an administrative agreement between countries has been made. 13. Use of telemedicine and tele-education may prove very useful: Telemedicine (if possible) may be useful to support inexperienced local physicians in managing\nmedical and logistical challenges. Online consultations and case discussions have been very useful in the recent Ukrainian crisis; this opportunity should also be provided in future catastrophes if local circumstances allow. During these virtual meetings, expatriate nephrologists may be helpful to overcome language barriers. 14. Special attention to ethical dilemmas is required: Ethical dilemmas may occur under disaster circumstances, especially so during armed conflicts. Corruption at many levels is a risk during all disaster conditions, including armed conflict situations. It is important to clarify communication channels pre-emptively for discussion and identify sources of assistance/advice to address such issues in real time [54]. 15. Collection of scientific data is important: Although collecting scientific data during disaster conditionsmay be very challenging and not considered a priority, it is crucial since it may serve to shed light on similar future disaster conditions. 16. Depression and war weariness must not be overlooked: Depression and war weariness remain very important issues and are typical for both patients and the medical staff. The desire and motivation of patients to continue treatment as well as the attention and care of medical personnel towards patients both decrease over time. The tension in the society increases as the family members of many people are at the front or have already been injured or died. This fatigue and burnout syndrome has been previously described and has been once more proven during the war in Ukraine [29]."

The end of the hostilities is totally unpredictable. Until now, the events have proved some of the previous theoretical concerns to be true: burnout syndrome increasing over time, the lack of electricity andwater supplies and adjustments being made according to needs [16]. Modalities of renal replacement therapies seem to be changing out of necessity from HD to PD. In contrast to earlier in the conflict, the supplies of consumables and medical products seem to be adequate. However, requests for generators for electricity supply and batteries to run automated PDmachines are increasing. Ultimately, generators for electricity production may not be a solution due to a lack of fuel to run those generators. The presence of a functioning health system, infrastructure and competent health workers before the war is extremely important in finding constructive solutions under the present conditions. Continuing communication and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders and regular updates of the current needs and conditions will be essential in the future.\n1966 S.

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "People living with kidney disease have complex needs and require continued support and care during disaster circumstances to avoid life-threatening situations. Disaster mitigation and preparedness, which include organizing disaster response teams, organizing training courses, preparing and/or translating guidelines and planning of the interventions may be useful to decrease the extent of post-disaster chaos and disorganization, which in turn increases the survival probability of patients with acute and chronic kidney disease. The implementation of action plans, which are prepared in a disaster-free period, and follow-up care in the maintenance phase may be lifesaving for patients with kidney disease. Post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation activities are necessary to optimize the quality of life of the patients who survive the disaster. Debriefing meetings and timely revision of action plans may be useful to avoid mistakes in future disasters.\nNo place is immune to natural or man-made disasters. The RDRTF is acutely aware that the time and resources spent on supporting patients and colleagues in Ukraine is disproportionate to the support of patients and colleagues in similar (chronic) conflict situations elsewhere. This disproportionate support is not easy to justify but can be attributed to the shock of the invasion of one sovereign country by another, the occurrence of the conflict on the European territory and the physical ability of the ERA to provide support locally. This in no way means that the ERA values less the lives and challenges faced by others; however, it does highlight the necessity for the global renal community to join forces to advocate for and support patients and colleagues in conflict situations everywhere."
