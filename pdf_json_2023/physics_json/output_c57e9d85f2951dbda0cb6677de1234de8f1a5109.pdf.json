Nanomaterials have made exponential progress due to\ntheir numerous uses in a variety of fields, particularly the advancement of engineering technology.\nNanoparticles are divided into various groups based on the size, shape, and structural morphology of\ntheir bodies. The 21st century's defining feature of nanoparticles is their application in the design and\nproduction of semiconductor devices made of metals, metal oxides, carbon allotropes, and\nchalcogenides. For the researchers, these materials then opened a new door to a variety of applications,\nincluding energy storage, catalysis, and biosensors, as well as devices for conversion and medicinal uses.\nFor chemical and thermal applications, ZnO is one of the most stable n-type semiconducting materials\navailable. It is utilised in a wide range of products, from luminous materials to batteries, supercapacitors,\nsolar cells to biomedical photocatalysis sensors, and it may be found in a number of forms, including\npellets, nanoparticles, bulk crystals, and thin films.

A nanometer is a SI (System international of units, SI) unit of length equal to 10\u22129 metres. NMs are characterised in principle as materials with at least one dimension length of 1\u20131000 nm; nonetheless, they are frequently dened as having a diameter of 1\u2013100 nm. Today, various articles of legislation in the United States of America (USA) and the European Union (EU) make specic mention to NMs. However, there is no universally accepted denition of NMs. Different organisations have divergent views on how to dene NMs.2 \u201cNMs can display behaviour unrelated to chemical components of comparable size\u201d, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.3 Nanomaterials are also known as \u201cmaterials with at least one dimension in the 1\u2013100 nm range that exhibit dimension dependent behaviours\u201d, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.4 The International Organization for Standardization denes Nanomaterials as \u201cany exterior nanoscale dimension or surface structure with an internal nanoscale dimension\u201d,5 This ISO denition has been used to dene quantum dots, nanowires, nanoplates,\nr Rajwali Khan is an Assistant rofessor and Associate Dean for esearch at the Department of hysics, University of Lakki Marat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakitan.

Iron oxide mNPs have the ability to digest excess iron and restore the supply in the human body. There is a continuous presence of these cationic mNPs in the endosomes for a considerable amount of time. This continues to be the case over and over again.18 Aer that, during the postcellular absorption process that takes place in the endosome and the lysosome, elemental components like iron and oxygen are brought into the body's storage, where hydrolytic enzymes either digest them or cause their destruction. In the human body, homeostasis is the process through which iron levels are maintained and adjusted. Adsorption, excretion, and storage are all processes that contribute to this process. Iron oxide nanoparticles help the body digest any excess iron that may be present.19 Iron is essential in almost all biological tissues, yet it has a low bioavailability.

Metal nanomaterials. Nanoparticles of metallica can be synthesized from metals through either constructive or destructive mechanisms. In order to create pure metal nanoparticles, metal precursors are required for the production process. Metal nanoparticles have distinctive optoelectrical properties, which can be attributed to their plasma on resonance characteristics.20 The size, shape, and surface of the metal nanoparticles all play a role in the synthesis process in their own unique ways.21 All metal nanoparticles can be synthesised.22 Nanoparticles of the metals cadmium, aluminium, copper, silver, lead, cobalt, zinc, gold, and iron are all examples of well-known nanoparticles of the element. Nanoparticles can be identied by their smaller size (10 to 100 nm), their surface properties such as pore size, surface charge, environmental factors, surface area to volume ratio, structure (amorphous and crystalline), shapes (irregular, rod, spherical, cylindrical, tetragonal and hexagonal), surface charge density and colour. Nanoparticles have been shown to have a variety of applications in a variety of elds (air, heat, moisture and sunlight).

Noble metal nanoparticles have been utilized in a diversity of biomedical applications, including those that treat cancer, diagnose diseases, improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy, ght germs and fungi, perform thermal ablation, deliver drugs and transport genes (Au, Pt, Ag). Nanoparticles made of noble metals have a number of unique properties, all of which contribute to their increased value. In order to target a wide variety of cell types, metal nanoparticles can be functionalized with a wide variety of functional groups, including antibodies, peptides, DNA, and RNA, as well as biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol.

The major goal in the manufacture ofmetal oxide nanomaterials is the alteration of the properties of the relevant metal nanomaterials. One example of this would be the transformation of iron nanoparticles into iron oxide nanoparticles. When compared to the reactivity of nanoparticles made of iron, the reactivity of nanoparticles made of\n13738 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\niron oxide is substantially higher. Nanoparticles of metal oxide are producedwhen the efficiency and reactivity ofmetal oxide are increased. This results in the production of the nanoparticles.26 Zinc oxide, iron oxide, silicon dioxide, magnetite, titanium oxide, aluminium oxide and cerium oxide are examples of metal oxide nanomaterials. Nanoparticles made of metal oxides have shown promising outcomes in studies conducted in the eld of biomedicine. Antibacterial activity has been demonstrated for a wide variety of metal oxide nanoparticles, including but not limited to MnO2, FeO, Ag2O, ZnO, Bi2O3, CuO, CaO, Al2O3, MgO, and TiO2.

Zinc oxide nanoparticles demonstrated strong bactericidal efficacy both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and spores. High pressure and temperature have little effect on these bacteria and spores. In addition, Fadeel et al.

Amorphous carbon is one of the most common forms of carbon.37 Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are the two categories that can be used to categorise carbon nanotubes.

Fullerene has a highly symmetric cage that can range in size from C60, C70, and beyond due of its unusual structure of sp2 carbons. In the as-synthesized formulation, C60 is the most prevalent fullerene, and its molecular structure, which can be shown in Fig. 8 together with that of C70, can be seen to be very similar.46 C60 is composed of 60 carbon atoms bonded to one another by single C5\u2013C5 bonds, which result in the formation of 12 pentagons, and double C5\u2013C6 bonds, which result in the formation of 20 hexagons.47 In reality, a \u2018n\u2019 hexagon is present in every fullerene that has 2n + 20 carbon atoms.48 Fullerene C60 has the shape of a football, and according to Yadaf and colleagues, the diameter of the earth is 12.75 \u00d7 106 metres,\nFig. 8 (a\u2013c) Shows the Fullerenes in different forms, C60 and (d\u2013f) show\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

According to the ndings of the study, the proportion of a fullerene molecule to a soccer ball is analogous to the proportion of a soccer ball to the earth.49\nIn terms of crystallographic properties, the presence of symmetric elements such as 20 tripled axes, 12 vefold axes and 30 twofold axes has made fullerene the most symmetrical molecule that is regulated by the Golden Mean rule (as was previously stated). Fullerene also possesses 12 vefold axes and 20 tripled axes.49,50 C60 has a structure that is sufficiently stable that it may be described as having face-centered cubic lattices in its solid phase where fullerene cage disintegration occurs at temperatures more than 10008 \u00b0C. To analyse fullerene, many spectroscopic approaches such as FTIR, NMR, UV-vis, and Raman spectroscopy could be used.46 Furthermore, Biomolecules, particularly those structured by the Fibonacci sequence and exhibiting Golden Mean properties, have discovered fullerene to be a promising nanomaterial.51 C60 is an outstanding candidate for photodynamic therapy due to the fact that, among its many properties, it possesses the capacity to generate oxygen species when it is illuminated by visible light.52 The puzzling behaviour of fullerene in solutions is evidence of a newly known interaction between solvents and solute. Because of this interaction, the fullerene molecule has not changed conformationally or in a way that is dependent on the solvent, nor has it taken on the shape of a hexagon.

Multi walled carbon nanotubes are produced by surrounding a standard core hollow with a few to a few tens of concentric cylinders with regular periodic interlayer spacing. An interlayer spacing range was discovered during realspace evaluation of multiwall nanotube images (0.34\u20130.39 nm).56 MWCNTs can have an interal diameter anywhere from 0.4 nm to a few nanometers, while their outside diameters can range anywhere from 2 nm to 20 to 30 nm, dependent on the number of layers they are composed of. Both of the normally closed tips of the MWCNT have domeshaped half-fullerene molecules capping them. These defects, which are also referred to as pentagonal defects, cap the normally closed points.

The purpose of the half-fullerene molecules, which are also referred to as a pentagonal ring defect, is to make the operation of capping off both ends of the tube more easy. On the other side, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have diameters that can be anywhere from 0.4 to 2 to 3 nanometers, while their lengths typically fall somewhere in the micrometre zone. In most cases, SWCNTs are able to create bundles by joining together (ropes). Within a bundle structure, the SWCNTs are organised in a hexagonal pattern to create a structure similar to a crystal.57\nCarbon nano tubes are elongated tubular structures with a diameter of 1 to 2 nm.58 Based on diameter, a carbon nanotube can be classied as semiconducting or metallic.59 CNT has a structure that looks like a graphite sheet rolling on itself.

Carbon has a ground state structure of 2s22p2 with a valence shell of four electrons. Both graphite and diamond are naturally occurring crystalline forms of pure carbon. Graphite is the more common of the two. Unlike graphite, which has sp2 hybridization, diamond possesses sp3 hybridization, which gives it its amazing rigidity. Graphite, on the other hand, has sp2 hybridization. Along the x\u2013y plane, each carbon atom in graphite forms C\u2013C bonds with three more carbon atoms at an angle of 120\u00b0, while a \u2013 bond is formed along the z axis.54 In sp2 hybridization, the C\u2013C bond length is 1.42 nm and the spacing between carbon layers is 3.35 nm.55,56 Graphite is an exceptional electrical conductor because it possesses delocalized electrons that are free to ow throughout the structure of the graphite. This makes graphite a wonderful material. Carbon nanotubes, also known as CNTs, are hexagonal networks made up of carbon atoms. The diameter of a carbon nanotube can range from one to one hundredmetres, and it has a diameter of one nanometer.

Nanowires can be metallic or semiconducting based on the chirality of SWNTs.59\u201362 The level of twist in the graphene sheet is the primary factor that inuences the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes.\nA single rolled sheet is used to make single-walled nanotubes.

As can be seen in Fig. 18, a single zinc atom is tetrahedrally connected with a total of four oxygen atoms. The piezoelectric nature of the material, which is an crucial property for the creation of microelectromechanical systems consisting of transducers, sensors and actuators, is the cause of ZnO's noncentrosymmetric structure. This structure can be attributed to the material's piezoelectric nature.161 Due to the fact that it is noncentrosymmetric, it also possesses two polar surfaces on sides that are opposite one another. Each of these polar surfaces is terminated by a single type of ions (Table 1).\nPolarity is referred to as zinc polarity when the bonds along the c-direction are from cation (Zn) to anion (O), whereas polarity is referred to as oxygen polarity when the bonds are from anion (O) to cation. Zinc polarity can refer to either Zn polarity or oxygen polarity; either one can be used interchangeably (Zn). This polarity is also the cause of a number of other properties that ZnO possesses, such as spontaneous polarisation and piezoelectricity. In addition to playing an important role in the creation of crystals, the formation of defects, plasticity, etching, and other processes, this polarity is also the cause of a number of other properties that ZnO possesses. It possesses both polar and non-polar surfaces, in addition to the polar ones it already has. The c-axis is the direction in which the polar Zn-terminated (0001) and Oterminated (0001) sides of wurtzite ZnO are oriented toward. Wurtzite is composed of ZnO, which has an equal number of atoms of both Zn and O on its non-polar (2110) (a-axis) and (0110) faces. The most common wurtzite ZnO crystals have these four faces arranged in a square. It has been demonstrated that the development of ZnO crystals into a wide variety of shapes is brought about by variations in the relative growth rates of different crystal facets as well as differences in the growth rates of various crystal planes. The years 1970 were the ones in which this discovery was made.163,164 Polar surfaces ought to be unstable from an electrostatic point of view, unless charge congurations and, as a consequence, opposite ionic charges on the surface result in spontaneous polarization and a normal dipole moment. In addition to this, it was discovered that both the surface with the coordinates (0110) and the polar surface are stable.

            "text": "ZnO, once it has been developed, is considered to be a negative (n-type) semiconductor. Zinc oxide is a type of semiconductor that falls within groups 2\u20134 of the periodic table. The energy gap in zinc oxide is measured to be 3.37 eV. In addition, zinc oxide possesses a high binding energy. Zinc oxide has a binding energy of around 60 meV.166 ZnO possesses a high exciton binding energy and is very stable at high temperatures. In addition to that, it boasts a high optical gain.167 As a result of the characteristics that have been discussed thus far, ZnO has emerged as one of the most intriguing substances for the creation of electrical and optoelectronic devices. On the other side, due to the high binding energy of ZnO, a wide variety of photonic devices that are highly effective in their utilisation of light may be fabricated. This opens up a lot of opportunities for research and development in this area. Additionally, the large band gap of ZnO is being utilized in the research and development of short wavelength optoelectronic devices.168 ZnO is a type of optical material that is see-through and is optimized for use with visible wavelengths.169 Numerous research organisations have examined the ZnO's unique features. This results in an improvement of ZnO's electrical and optical characteristics. Numerous other features of ZnO enable a diverse range of uses. These include light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, microelectromechanical systems and photodetectors.170\u2013173 ZnO is an incredibly versatile material with semiconducting, pyroelectric and piezoelectric characteristics. ZnO is a material that exhibits a wide variety of nanostructures, signicantly more than any other nanomaterial, including carbon nanotubes.174\u2013176\n4.2.1. Optical properties of zinc oxide. The way in which a substance reacts when illuminated by light is what establishes its optical characteristics. Based on their physical characteristics, such as their vibrational and electrical states, as well as the presence and nature of impurities and defects in the material, semiconductor substances have contributed a great deal to our understanding of a wide range of topics, providing a wealth of information along the way. This knowledge has been gleaned from the study of semiconductor materials. The extrinsic and intrinsic qualities of a material are what designate it as a semiconductor. Excitonic causes related to the Coulomb attraction, in addition to the interaction between electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band, are the fundamental building blocks for the intrinsic properties of semiconductors. These characteristics are known as the electronic band structure. The dopants and defects that are injected into the semiconductor are what govern its extrinsic optical properties. These dopants and imperfections form discrete electronic states between valence band and conduction band.177 Investigations into an optical transition in a zinc oxide semiconductor have been carried out utilizing a variety of methodologies, including transmission photoluminescence, cathode luminescence, reection, optical absorption, and others. The photoluminescence method is one of these methods that has\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785 | 13753\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The photoluminescence spectra of various zinc oxide nanostructures include UV emission in addition to one or two bands of visible emission that are brought about by vacancies, antisites, interstitials, defects, and complicated defects.178,179 The zinc oxide material has a band gap of 3.37 eV and an exciton energy of 60 meV when it is at ambient temperature. Due to the fact that this material has a higher exciton energy value than GaN, it is capable of emitting excitons in an effective manner at room temperature and below low excitation energy (25 meV). As a direct result of this, zinc oxide is currently considered to be one of the most promising photonic materials in the blue-ultraviolet region.180 The optical properties of zinc oxide nanorods have been studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy, which provides information about the band gap, defects, and crystal features.180,181 Zinc oxide nanorods show a near-band edge for UV emission and a broader band emission due to deep level defects when subjected to photoluminescence study at ambient temperature. A single emission at UV emission (from 3.236 to 3.307 eV) has been seen in zinc oxide nanorods with lower impurity concentrations, and deep level emissions have been seen in these nanorods as well.182 Near-band edge and deep level emissions band emissions in the UV and visible ranges are attributable to defects in the zinc oxide nanostructure such as oxygen vacancy, oxygen interstitial, zinc vacancy, zinc interstitial and extrinsic contamination.180,182 The optical quality of various zinc oxide systems can be assessed by comparing the relative intensity of near-band edge and deep level emissions emission. Thus, the optical quality of zinc oxide is given by the ratio of near-band edge emission intensity to deep level emissions emission intensity (INBE/IDLE). The high (INBE/IDLE) number indicates\nFig. 19 Typical ZnO doped optical properties graphs (a) ref. 183, (b) ref.\n13754 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\na deep level defect with lesser concentration.182 Different type of ZnO doped optical properties graphs are displayed in the Fig. 20 (a\u2013f).\n4.2.2. Magnetic properties of zinc oxide. The orientation of electron spins in the magnetic semiconductor host lattice is used to categorise the various types of magnetic semiconductors. On the basis of this alignment, semiconductors can be divided into the following three distinct categories: (a) magnetic semiconductor, (b) DMS semiconductors and (c) semiconductors that do not exhibit magnetic behaviour, as seen in Fig. 19a\u2013c. As seen in Fig. 19a, magnetic semiconductors are constructed solely out of the periodic alignment of magnetic components. As can be seen in Fig. 19b, DMS are composite materials consisting of magnetic components and nonmagnetic semiconductors. As can be seen in Fig. 19c, nonmagnetic semiconductors do not have any magnetic impurities present in the host lattice of the semiconductor. Doping various transition or rare earth ions into nonmagnetic semiconductors, such as Cu, Ni, Sm, Co, Cr, Eu, Fe, Mn, Gd, and so on, is one method for producing DMS (Fig. 19b).\nDoping is the technique of inserting impurities on purpose into an intrinsic semiconductor in order to affect the material's physical properties. Doping is also known as doping an intrinsic semiconductor. A great number of research reports were distributed all at once via DMS154\u2013159,189. There have also been reports of attempts to doped semiconductor nanocrystals160,161. There is a growing interest in studying the fundamental characteristics of DMS in various nanostructures for spintronics applications158\u2013160,162. The introduction of transition or rare earth ions into semiconductors results in the formation of these materials. Because the d and f shells of transition or rare earth ions are only partially full, these doping elements have electrons"

This allows for greater doping efficiency. One of the bands in transition metals such as manganese, copper, cobalt, and nickel is only partially full or just over half-lled at most (up or down spins). The ions of the transition metal are almost always substituted for the cations that are originally present in the host semiconductor. Doping manganese into zinc oxide, for example, causes the element to offer its four s2 electrons to the s\u2013p3 bonding and causes a Mn2+ charge state to be created in the tetrahedral bonding. This is because dopingmanganese causes the element to give its four s2 electrons to the s\u2013p3 bonding. In order to determine the tetrahedral bonding, the d bands of the transitionmetal hybridise with the VB bands of the host (O-p bands in zinc oxide). Because of this hybridization, the interface between the locally organised carriers in the host valence band and the three-dimensional spins is replaced, which results in the sample having a local magnetic moment. When it comes to dening the magnetic properties of materials that have been doped with transitionmetals, the degree of doping in the carrier density, the crystal, and the quality of the crystal all play a part.\nDulub et al.163 provided the impetus for thinking about semiconductor oxides, specically zinc oxide, in the context of spintronics. According to the predicted mean eld theory, common diamagnetic semiconductors with ve atomic percent Mn doped and a hole quantity of 3.5 \u00d7 1020 cm3 would have a high Curie temperature. In the case of zinc oxide and GaN, simulations show that the Curie temperature exceeds 300 K.163 Because the Zener model suggests that magnetic properties can be modied by modifying the carrier concentration in the materials, the character of the carrier is an important part of the model that must be taken into consideration. In the beginning, the substitution integral parameter suggested that p-type materials would be ideal candidates for high Curie temperatures. Additionally, the density of states in the valence band is higher than the density of states in the conduction band. Because it is impossible to produce p-type zinc oxide, Dietl's theory does not apply to zinc oxide, which is an element.\nLi et al.164 proposed a pattern that demonstrates the dominance of defect states on DMS ferromagnetism properties.\nThey claim that donor defects are responsible for covering up a signicant amount of doping substance as well as the establishment of a contaminated band. In the case of type zinc oxide, these donor defects can take the form of zinc interstitials or oxygen vacancies. This contaminated band is capable of\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ninteracting with the local magnetic moment if the bound magnetic polaron is made signicantly larger. Within this radius, the magnetic dopants will interact with the bound carrier, and they will be able to align their spins in each bound magnetic polaron so that they are parallel to one another. In order to obtain both ferromagnetism and penetrating ferromagnetism in the DMS, the magnetic polarons that are coupled to the electrons in the material must be stacked one on top of the other to create a chain that runs the length of the material. MS nanocrystals are remarkable materials that incorporate quantum connement effects as well as magnetic features due to the system's DMS composition. Some articial problems are involved in the direct exchange of cations/anions of host material via dopant ions in nanocrystals.165,166 A signicant barrier that needs to be surmounted is the creation of nanocrystals that have dopant ions incorporated continuously throughout the lattice of the host substance. The utilization of nanocrystals that have a high surface area to volume ratio has begun to promote impurity separation to the surface of the nanocrystals during a process known as \u201cself annealing\u201d in the core. This process takes place in the core. As a consequence of this, dopants are probably just sitting on the surface, which results in a high level of entrapment. Nevertheless, the production method for generating doped nanocrystals serves a crucial function in the overall process. Several papers162,167,168 propose successful dopant integration in host materials. Doping a very small amount of rare earth or transition atoms is the primary technique that is utilized in the process of initiating magnetism in ZnO. There are still some points of contention regarding the substitutional insertion of transition or rare earth elements in host materials and the attainment of ferromagnetism in doped host materials, both of which have been the subject of extensive research. The ferromagnetism that was explored in the host semiconductor could have been induced by the inherent magnetism of the semiconductor itself, as well as its precipitates, or the secondary magnetic phases of transition metals. If DMS is researched in a methodical manner by correlating all of its attributes, then the controversy over the presence of magnetic properties can be settled once and for all.\nA great deal of curiosity has been ignited as a result of the nding that metal oxide nanocrystals exhibit ferromagnetism at normal temperature. When compared to the equivalent bulk material, nanocrystals have a high surface-to-volume ratio; hence, changes in nanocrystal size have the greatest inuence\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785 | 13755\nFig. 21 Typical ZnO doped magnetic properties graphs (a) ref. 190, (b) ref. 191, (c) ref. 192, (d) ref. 193, (e) ref. 194, (f) ref. 195.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The inuence of voluntary surface spins on saturation magnetization provides evidence that this function plays a crucial role in magnetic properties. In their bulk and nanostructure forms, metal oxides such as HfO2, ZnO, and Al2O3 exhibit diamagnetic and ferromagnetic magnetic properties, respectively.169 Interactions between localised electron spin moments and oxygen vacancies at nanocrystal surfaces are thought to be the cause of ferromagnetism in nanocrystalline materials.169 Ferromagnetic behaviour was seen in chemically produced zinc oxide nanocrystals that were capped by a variety of capping agents when the samples were allowed to reach room temperature. Spin polarization can be facilitated by the alteration of the surface charge state by coupled ligand.152 According to the ndings of this study, the magnetic properties of nanocrystals are not only associated with the presence of magnetic ions, but they are also highly supported by the presence of surface defects. Additionally, the presence of magnetic ions is associated with the magnetic properties of nanocrystals. In addition to this, the magnetic properties are connected with the presence of magnetic ions, which explains why they have these characteristics.152 Different type of ZnO doped magnetic properties graphs are displayed in the Fig. 21 (a\u2013f)."

Nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, nanocolumns, nanorings, nanobelts, nanosheet networks, nanoribbons, nanoowers, hollow micro- and nanospheres and nanocombs are among the nanostructures.\n4.3.1. ZnO nanorods and nanowires. One-dimensional nanostructures such as nanorods and nanowires are gaining popularity due to the multiple applications they have in photovoltaic systems, nanoelectronics, chemistry, and biosensors. These nanostructures are comprised of a single layer. In addition, the 1D nanostructures are a good candidate for the production of effective optoelectronic nanodevices due to their many important characteristics, such as a direct band-gap and a signicant exciton binding energy. This makes the 1D nanostructures a good candidate for the production of efficient optoelectronic nanodevices. There have been a signicant number of articles written about the synthesis of zinc oxide nanorods and nanowires, as well as their characteristics and the growth mechanisms behind them. There are two primary growth methods that have been described for the creation of zinc oxide nanowires and nanorods through a gas phase process. These approaches are as follows: vapor\u2013liquid\u2013 solid,170,171 and vapor-solid.172\u2013174 As nucleation sites for the generation of one-dimensional nanostructures, metal nanoclusters or metal nanoparticles have been utilized in the VLS mechanism, which is a process that is supported by a catalyst.

The production of alloy liquid droplets takes place as a result of the gaseous reactants interacting with the catalytic particles throughout this process. The formation of 1D nanostructures is signicantly aided by the participation of these droplets. The formation of precipitation begins when a droplet of liquid gets supersaturated with the medium from which it originated. If the conditions are favourable, the amount of precipitation that falls will continue to increase over the course of time, which will result in the construction of connected structures that are one-dimensional. During the process of creating 1D nanostructures, a number of different metal catalyst components, including gold, tin, copper, and cobalt, are utilised as catalysts. On the other hand, in order to successfully carry out the VS mechanism, the utilisation of a catalyst is not required in any way. When it comes to the process of generating 1D nanostructures, it is generally agreed upon that one of the most signicant components is mastering the ability to regulate the level of supersaturation present. This is due to the fact that the degree of supersaturation is what is responsible for determining the primary growth morphology. For whiskers growth, a low degree of supersaturation is required; for bulk growth, a medium degree is necessary; and for powder growth, a high degree of supersaturation is necessary. The source materials are vaporised at a high temperature in the usual vapor solid process, and then they are quickly condensed onto the substrate in a zone that is characterized by a low temperature. This results in the formation of a vapor solid. This takes place in an area where the temperature is lower than the point at which vaporization can take place. Condensed molecules give rise to seed crystals aer the rst stage of the condensation process is complete. These seed\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The specic vapor solid approach has been established for the purpose of manufacturing a wide variety of ZnO nanostructures in order to full demand. Fig. 22a\u2013h displaying the ZnO nanowires and rods.\n4.3.2. ZnO nanotubes. ZnO nanotube arrays are almost always created by dissolving the centre of previously made nanorods. Electrochemical dissolution is a viable option.,202 Chemical dissolution is more prevalent, though. Zinc oxide is amphoteric, which means it may dissolve chemically in either an acidic (HCl) or a basic (KOH) solution.203 The selective decomposition of the nanorods' centres while leaving the lateral faces unaffected by the process can be explained in two different ways. To begin, the metastable plans for (0001) zinc oxide have a higher surface energy than the lateral plans, which are thus more stable.204,205 Second, the (0001) designs have more defects, which makes them more likely to break.204 To the dissolving solution, Wang et al. added a surfactant (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide).206 This molecule is well known for being bound to the (1000) plans and safeguarding the wall of the 1D structure throughout the process of nanorods dissolving into nanotubes. This is why it has received so much attention.207\u2013210 Ammonia solution is used as an etching agent. All of the aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water that had been acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. The resistivity of the water was 18 U cm. All of the chemicals that were utilised in this work were of analytical quality and did not require any additional purication prior to their usage. The manufacturing of ZnO nanotubes is a process that takes place over two stages. In the initial step of the process, the substrate,\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785 | 13757\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Aer that, the substrate was heated for an additional twenty minutes at a temperature of one hundred degrees Celsius in order to evaporate any trace amounts of moisture that could have been present in the paper. The paper substrate, on the other hand, has a large capacity for absorbing water, which makes it susceptible to wetting and limited in its ability to withstand low temperatures for extended periods of time. As a consequence of this, a wetting and chemical barrier layer is essential in order to shield the paper substrate from the effects of being exposed to water and chemicals.211 This layer needs to be able to act as a barrier against chemicals and moisture, in addition to having mechanical and dielectric properties that are satisfactory. The deposition of such a barrier layer on the substrate can be accomplished using a various of methods, including sputtering, evaporation, and chemical vapour phase deposition, to name a few.211 In addition, because these processes require a large number of intricate stages, we opted to avoid them in favour of a method that was both straightforward and highly effective. This method involved applying a protective layer to the paper substrate in order to achieve passivation or chemical resistance. For this purpose, we utilised the advanced electronics cyclotene 3022-46 resin that is manufactured by Dow Chemical Company USA. This resin is a polymer that can be used for wafer-level applications that require a thin layer, and it can do so successfully. During the synthesis process, the surface roughness and damagemay be reduced thanks to this change of the surface, which may also help. In addition to this, it has the potential to assist in enhancing the alignment and homogeneity of ZnO nanotubes on the paper substrate.212 Aer applying a layer of cyclotene by spin coating to the surface of the paper substrate, we baked it in a vacuum for y minutes at a temperature of one hundred degrees Celsius. Aer that, the substrate was roasted in the oven for approximately thirty minutes at a temperature of one hundred sixty degrees Celsius. Aer that, a spin coater was used to apply a seed layer to the substrate at a speed of 2100 rpm for approximately one minute. This step served to provide nucleation sites for the creation of ZnO nanorods. This method was carried out a total of ve times in order to ensure adequate coverage.\nZnO nanoparticles were used to construct the seed layer. These nanoparticles were produced by achieving a concentration of 0.01 M in methanol by diluting zinc acetate dehydrate, which has the chemical formula (C4H6O4Zn$2H2O). Aer that, the solution was brought up to a temperature of sixty degrees Celsius. A second solution of KOH in methanol with a concentration of 0.03 M was dropwise added to the rst solution while it was continuously stirred at a temperature of 60 \u00b0C for two hours. ZnO nanoparticles have diameters that ranged anywhere from 5 to 10 nanometers.213 Aer maintaining a temperature of 180 \u00b0C on the substrate for a period of thirty minutes, it was eventually possible to consolidate the seed layer. This was made possible aer the substrate was heated. Following that, the temperature of the substrate was permitted to gradually recover to that of the surrounding environment. We chose a method for developing the ZnO NRs that required a temperature that was\n13758 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\non the lower end of the spectrum. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2$6H2O] and hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) were mixed in equal amounts in DI water and kept under continuous magnetic stirring for 30 min in order to obtain a consistent growth solution. This was done in order to obtain a consistent growth solution. This was done in order to obtain a growth solution that was consistent throughout. Aer that, the paper substrate, which had been preheated, was immersed in the solution and heated at a temperature of eighty degrees for a period of ve hours. Following that, it was cleaned with DI water to remove any residuals that may have been on the surface, and aer that, it was dried at room temperature in the air.\nThe second step was to obtain the ZnO nanotubes, which we did using a process that involves chemical etching to convert ZnO NRs to NTs.214 This approach has been effectively used by many research groups to produce zinc oxide NTs.215,216 In order to do this, the ZnO NRs that were located on the paper substrate were chemically etched into ZnO NTs by placing them in an aqueous solution of KCL at a temperature of 80 \u00b0C for several hours. Aer that, the substrate was taken away and given a thorough cleaning with DI water in order to remove any residuals that might have been on the surface. The last step was to hang it up outside so it could dry. We used scanning electron microscopy with a 12 keV energy setting and transmission electron microscopy with a 200 keV energy setting to explore the surface morphologies and diameters of the ZnO nanotubes that were formed. An X-ray diffractometer was used with Cu K radiation, a wavelength of 1.54178 \u00c5, 40 keV, and 100 mA for the aim of determining the crystal structure of the nal products and classifying them into their respective phases. This was accomplished by using the instrument. An energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy that was linked to a scanning electron microscope and operated at 20 keV was used to investigate the evidence for the purity and elemental composition of the as formed ZnO nanotubes. The charge-coupled device camera, which was cooled using nitrogen, was used to carry out the measurements of CL. The luminescence was collected by a parabolic mirror, and it was then scattered by a monochromator of 0.55 metres in length and tted with a grating measuring 600 mm\u22121. Fig. 23a\u2013h displaying the ZnO nanotubes.\n4.3.3. ZnO nanobelts and nanorings. The belt-like nanostructure morphology is a structural characteristic that is maintained by functional oxides with a variety of different crystallographic structures. In reality, three different architectures can be used to generate ZnO nanobelts (NBs).222 Planar defects can be used to grow one of these structures. ZnO NBs can be used in a variety of ways. ZnO nanorings are a remarkable type of ZnO morphology that can be produced, in addition to ZnO nanobelts, by ZnO nanobelts.223 Planar defects are required for the development of nanorings, according to microscopic research.224 Twins, interstitial stacking layers and conventional stacking faults created by impurity atoms are all examples of planar defects.225 Using indium as a dopant element, Wang's teamwas able to create ZnO nanorings.222 They also demonstrated that the introduction of planar defects\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

They came to the conclusion that the polarity of the NBs was in no way affected by the IDBs, regardless of whether they were coupled head-to-head or tail-to-tail. This was the nding that they came to. Because of the long-range electrostatic interaction between the surface polar charges on the two sides, the development of a nanoring was initiated by circularly folding a Nanobelt, and loop-by-loop winding of the nanobelt generated a full ring. This interaction was caused by the fact that the nanobelt had surface polar charges on both of its sides. This interaction was brought about as a result of the fact that the surface polar charges on both sides are charged in the opposite direction. The fact that a nanobridge can be folded into a nanotube allowed for the successful completion of this interaction. They came to the conclusion that indium would be the best material to use as the doping agent due to the signicance of indium doping in the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, many research groups, including our own, have been focusing their efforts over the past few years on the development of indium-doped zinc oxide nanostructures. Tin is an important doping chemical that, in addition to indium, has the potential to open up new applications for zinc oxide.226 It is generally knowledge that the band gap of ZnO can be adjusted to a more desirable value by alloying the material with another substance that possesses a band gap that is different. This causes a change in the wavelength of exciton emission to occur as a result. Because the inclusion of tin oxide, which has a greater band-gap than ZnO (3.6\u20133.97 eV), results in a widened band-gap, the ZnO/SnO2 structure produced by alloying ZnO with SnO2 could be a possible contender for future optoelectronic devices.

In addition to this, when compared to undoped zinc oxide nanowires, the eld emission properties of Sn-doped zinc oxide nanowires are signicantly improved, and the resistance decreases as the amount of Sn present in the nanowires increases. ZnO's band-gap ranges between 3.6 and 3.97 ev, whereas SnO2's band-gap is between 3.6 and 3.98 ev.227 Sn can act as a doping material in ZnO NBs, causing the production of planar defects, in addition to its impacts on the optical band gap and better electrical characteristics.228 As a direct consequence of this, it will be possible to produce zinc oxide nanorings using tin (Sn) as the dopant material, which is something that has never been accomplished previously. On the other hand, research has not yet been conducted to determine how the concentration of tin inuences the formation of zinc oxide nanorings. In addition, the vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid process, which is considered to be one of the most important ways for producing one-dimensional nanostructures, has not yet been employed to create zinc oxide nanorings.

Utilizing carbonaceous saccharide microspheres of variable diameters as templates has resulted in the development of a straightforward and generic process that is capable of producing zinc oxide hollow microspheres with a number of shells that can be adjusted. This method is also very successful. It was revealed that the triple-shelled zinc oxide hollow spheres with a large surface area displayed the highest levels of photocatalytic activity. This was discovered when the photocatalytic capabilities of the as-synthesized products were assessed by degrading methyl orange (MO) dye. In addition to this, research was\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785 | 13759\nFig. 24 Typical SEM images of ZnO nanorings are shown in (a) ref. 229, (b) ref. 148, (c) ref. 230, (d) ref. 148 and ZnO nanobelts are shown in (e) ref. 231, (f) ref. 232, (g) ref. 149, (h) ref. 232.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In this experiment, the metal precursors were zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2$6H2O) and carbonaceous saccharide microspheres served as the sacricial templates. The following explanation provides an outline for the typical production of single-shelled ZnO hollow microspheres. In accordance with what was previously stated, carbonaceous microspheres were produced using the emulsion polymerization of sugar in hydrothermal circumstances.234,235 Adjusting the amount of sugar solution used and the amount of time the reaction is allowed to run can change the width of the carbon spherules that are formed. The microspheres of carbonaceous saccharide were given multiple washings in deionized water and ethanol at a concentration of one hundred percent until the ltrate became transparent.\nWith the assistance of ultrasonication, freshly manufactured carbonaceous microspheres (0.5 g) with diameters of 500 nm were dispersed throughout a solution of 1.5 M zinc nitrate (water/ethanol = 1 : 3, v/v, 25 mL). Following the completion of a total of 0.5 h of ultrasonic dispersion, the suspension was then aged for 8 h in a water bath maintained at a temperature of 60 \u00b0 C. Aer that, the suspension was dehydrated in an oven at a temperature of 80 \u00b0C for 12 h, aer which it was vacuum ltered, rinsed several times with deionized water, and then ltered again. The resulting black composite microspheres were heated to 350 \u00b0C for one hour, then gradually brought up to 450 \u00b0C in air at a rate of one degree per minute, and eventually\n13760 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\nheld at 450 \u00b0C for two hours. This was done so that the templates could be removed. The ZnO hollow microspheres with a single shell were produced as a white powder by-product when the tube furnace was allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. A procedure that is quite similar to this one was used in the production of double- and triple-walled ZnO hollow microspheres. Burning was one of the steps in the process that resulted in the production of ZnO nanoparticles. In a nutshell, 5 mL of deionized water were used to dissolve 3 g of Zn(CH3COO)2$2H2O and 1 g of CO(NH2)2, and then NH3 was added aer that. The water was added in a very careful and methodical manner drop by drop until the solution became extremely thick gel precursors. This process took quite some time. The resultant viscous gel precursors were immediately heated to 500 \u00b0C, where they spontaneously ignited to generate white ZnO particles. This step was repeated until the desired amount of ZnO had been produced. Fig. 25a\u2013h displaying the ZnO nano and microspheres.\n4.3.5. Star- and ower-shaped ZnO nanostructures. Using a method that is based on a solution and performed at a low temperature, sulphur doping of hexagonal ZnO nanowires using thiourea (SC(NH2)2) produces hexagram-shaped ZnO nanostructures (\u201cnanostars\u201d). According to scanning electron microscopy, the amounts of sulphur doping have a signicant impact on the morphology of the nanostructure when viewed in cross-section (SEM). According to the calculations of the density functional theory, the transformation from hexagonal nanowires to nanostars takes place as a result of sulphur atoms preferentially bonding to the vertices of hexagonal structures while the structures are developing.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy were utilized to demonstrate the presence of sulphur in the nanostars. The involvement of sulphur in the formation of nanostars was validated in control tests using the sulfur-free counterpart urea (OC(NH2)2).\nThe processes developed by Greene and Pacholski for making ZnO nanowires in solution were followed to make the nanowires. In the rst step of this procedure, solutions of zinc acetate dihydrate [(CH3CO2)2Zn$2H2O (Fluka, assay 99.5%)] and sodium hydroxide [NaOH (Fisher Chemical, assay = 98.6%)] were prepared in methanol at concentrations of 0.01 mol L\u22121 and 0.03 mol L\u22121, respectively. The mixture of 13.68 mL of a solution containing 0.03 mol L\u22121 of NaOH and 26.32 mL of a solution containing 0.01 mol L\u22121 of (CH3CO2)2Zn$2H2O was then stirred for two hours at a temperature of 60 \u00b0C. ZnO seed crystals were produced by applying a drop-coating of the solution that had been produced to a silicon substrate, then rinsing the substrate with methanol and blow-drying it with air. This method of drop-coating was carried out a number of times. Aer that, the substrate was annealed for twenty minutes at a temperature of three hundred and y degrees Celsius in order to form ZnO seed crystals.

In every single experiment, 10 mL of each reactant solution were utilized.\nIt is explained how each of the thiourea-infused growth treatments works. The entire sample occupied a space of 30 mL. In order to characterise each of the products, we utilized SEM (FEI XL 30), PL (Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra), and XPS (Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra).

Sol\u2013gel technique. The sol\u2013gel method is a wet chemical procedure that can be used to produce a threedimensional network. This approach is also known as the way of producing sol\u2013gel materials.

In this particular investigation, zinc oxide nanoparticles were produced by a process known as reverse microemulsion. The substances nheptane, glycerol and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium in that order, are utilised for the roles of surfactant, polar phase, and non-polar phase, respectively. The synthesis results in two different microemulsions, each of which has a different ratio of surfactants. Dissolving dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium in nheptane at room temperature while stirring continuously will result in the production of a microemulsion. Aer the ingredients have been combined, the solution should be cut into two equal parts and labelled solution A and solution B. The zinc compound is stirred into solution A while constantly being stirred while the other half of the glycerol is dissolved in the zinc compound. In the same manner, add some sodium hydroxide (NaOH) that has been dissolved in glycerol to solution B.

Aer being washed in a mixture of methanol and chloroform and centrifuged for ten minutes at ten thousand revolutions per minute, the product was dried for one hour at one hundred degrees Celsius in an open-air drying oven and then placed overnight in a vacuum drier at room temperature. This process took a total of twenty-four hours.

It is a method for the creation of single crystals that is predicated on the solubility of minerals in hot water that is subjected to intense pressure. To prepare stock solutions, zinc component is rst stirred into methanol, then dissolved in the solvent. To modify the pH to a range between 8 and 11, NaOH that has been dissolved in methanol is added to the stock solution while it is being stirred continuously. Aer that, the solution was autoclaved in stainless steel autoclaves lined with Teon for 6 and 12 h at temperatures ranging from 100 to 200 \u00b0C under autogenous pressure before being allowed to naturally cool down to ambient temperature. Following the completion of the reaction, the white solid product was extracted by washing it with methanol, ltering it, and then drying it in a laboratory oven at 60 \u00b0C.250,251 Fig. 30 displaying the ow chart of hydrothermal method.\n13764 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\n4.4.1.5. Solvothermal technique. It is a method in which the solvent is added at a pressure and temperature ranging from moderate to high, which makes it easier for the precursors to interact with one another throughout the synthesis. In this particular experiment, ethylene glycol and ethanol were mixed together and used in the capacity of a solvent. For a period of twenty minutes, the zinc component should be mixed into the solvent solution. In order to reach the required temperature, the sealed chamber is kept inside a box furnace that has been preheated for a period of twelve hours. The experiment was carried out at a variety of temperatures, including 200 \u00b0C, 150 \u00b0 C, and 135 \u00b0C, in order to calibrate the size of the nanoparticles. Aer that, the precipitate was collected, aer that it was washed three times with ethanol and water, and nally it was dried in the air at room temperature.252 Fig. 31 displaying the ow chart of solvothermal method.\n4.4.1.6. Pyrolysis technique. The process known as pyrolysis begins with the atomization of a precursor solution, continues with the solution's evaporation, and concludes with the solution's decomposition into lms and particles. In order to produce the precursor solution, the zinc component is rst dissolved in the distillate water. Nebulization occurs in response to the pressure exerted by the surrounding air.

An inert gas and material vapour have a collision inside of a vacuum chamber. Aer that, it travels to a collecting surface that is cooled to a low temperature, where it produces nanoparticles as it settles. We are able to simply manage the pressure and temperature by maintaining optimal conditions within the vacuum chamber. This is possible due to the fact that the temperature of the collection surface rises when liquid nitrogen ows continuously through the collector while it is located inside the vacuum chamber.

However, as a result of the weak connection that exists between the surface of the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix, the ZnO nanoparticles have a tendency to group together in the polymer matrix to form larger particles. Techniques that modify the surface are utilised in order to improve the interaction of nanoparticles with the polymer in order to solve this problem. Das et al.262 demonstrate how, during the curing process, a hydrosilylation procedure is used to incorporate unmodied and surface-modied ZnO nanoparticles into the silicone rubber. Both of these types of nanoparticles include the vinyl silane group. Both the silicone rubber/zinc oxide (SR/ ZnO) and the silicone rubber/silicon dioxide at zinc oxide (SR/ SiVi@ZnO) nanocomposites were investigated in terms of their related structure, morphology, and properties.

The increased mechanical capabilities of ionic elastomers are primarily the result of their high stress relaxation capacity. This is because the enhanced mechanical capabilities of ionic elastomers are caused by the slippage of elastomer chain molecules on the surface of ionic clusters and the reformation of ionic bonds when the sample is deformed externally. In addition, ionic elastomers have thermoplastic properties, and when they are in a molten state, they can be handled just like any other thermoplastic polymer.265 However, zinc oxide-crosslinked carboxylic elastomers have a few drawbacks that need to be considered.

Although the development of ionic crosslinks accounts for the vast majority of the vulcanization of XNBR with zinc peroxide, the action of the peroxide also results in the formation of covalent connections between the individual chains of the elastomer. However, longer vulcanization durations are required in order to achieve vulcanizates with equivalent tensile strength and crosslink density to zinc oxidecrosslinked vulcanizates. This is because zinc oxide is a crosslinking agent. In the case of XNBR vulcanization utilising zinc peroxide/zinc oxide systems, the curing process is comprised of at least three stages: the rapid synthesis of ionic crosslinks as a result of the initial zinc oxide present; peroxide crosslinking resulting in the development of covalent bonds (peroxide action); and ionic crosslinking as a result of the production of zinc oxide as a result of the peroxide decomposing. The third stage, which takes place gradually over long periods of time and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nresults in degradation, very certainly involves the production of ionic species in some way. The vulcanization periods that can be achieved with XNBR that has been crosslinked with zinc oxide are substantially longer than those that can be achieved with XNBR that has been vulcanised using any other method. Despite the fact that it can cause burns in some situations, zinc oxide is nevertheless extensively utilised as a cross-linking agent in carboxylated nitrile rubbers. This is the case despite the fact that zinc oxide can induce burns. When it comes to the process of cross-linking, the parameters that are most important in determining its activity are the particle size, surface area, and shape of the zinc oxide. This is due to the fact that zinc oxide reacts with elastomer carboxylic groups to form carboxylic salts, which are also known as ionic crosslinks. The nature of the interphase that develops between the cross-linking agent and the elastomer chains is determined by these factors.266\n(3) Hamed et al.267 used a solid-state pyrolytic process to synthesize nano zinc oxide.

The particle sizes ranged from 15 to 30 nm. The neoprene rubber that the researchers employed had a trace amount of zinc oxide, which served as a curing agent and was incorporated into the substance. It was demonstrated that a modest dosage of ZnO was optimal, particularly in comparison to the ZnO that is found in commercial items. Evaluations were conducted on the rubber's\n13770 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\ncuring qualities as well as its mechanical properties, and the results were compared to those of conventionally cured rubbers made with zinc oxide. It was discovered that a low concentration of zinc oxide was sufficient to provide comparable curing and mechanical properties to neoprene rubber that utilised a higher concentration of commercial zinc oxide. This was discovered by comparing the properties of neoprene rubber that used a higher concentration of commercial zinc oxide. This was a nding that\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It all started with the observation that a small amount of zinc oxide was sufficient.\n(4) Zinc oxide is commonly employed in the creation of several types of pharmaceuticals due to its drying, antibacterial, and disinfecting qualities.268,269 Historically, it was utilized in the treatment of epilepsy, and later on, it was utilized in the treatment of diarrhoea. At the moment, it is employed in the region, most frequently in the form of creams and ointments, but less frequently in the form of liquid powders and dusting powders. Dusting powders and liquid powders are utilized less frequently. Zinc oxide is frequently used in dermatological goods intended to treat inammation and irritation because of its capacity to stimulate wound healing. These products can be found on the market. Peeling of the skin can occur when it is exposed to higher amounts of the substance. In addition to that, it is also available in suppositories. Additionally, it has use in the eld of dentistry, primarily as a component of dental pastes and additionally for the production of temporary llings. Zinc oxide is also utilized to give dietary zinc in a variety of dietary supplements and nutritional items. This is necessary because zinc is essential for human health.270\n(5) Before the introduction of nanoparticles of TiO2 and ZnO, sun lotions had heavy formulations that did not rub well into the skin and were cosmetically unpleasant. Because of their ability to absorb UVA and UVB rays, these chemicals began to be used in creams. A new cream formula including a combination of TiO2 and ZnO solved the problem of an insufficiently white layer, resulting in a more clear, less sticky, and much simpler to rub into the skin medium.271 Titanium and zinc oxides have been demonstrated in a number of studies to be excellent sun cream media because they absorb UV rays, do not irritate the skin, and are quickly absorbed into the skin.272\u2013274\n(6) Zinc oxide is biocompatible for textile applications, and nanostructured zinc oxide coatings are more air-permeable and UV-blocking efficient than their bulk equivalents.275 As a result, ZnO nanostructures have attracted a lot of interest as UVprotective textile coatings. Using ZnO nanostructures, various ways for producing UV-protecting textiles have been reported. For example, UV-blocking capabilities of hydrothermally produced ZnO nanoparticles in SiO2-coated cotton fabric were\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It is employed in eld emission display equipment, such as televisions, because to this property. It outperforms typical materials such as sulphur and phosphorus (phosphorescent compounds) in terms of UV resistance and electrical conductivity. The photoluminescent properties of zinc oxide are affected by the crystals size, the presence of defects in the crystalline structure, and the temperature.292\u2013295 ZnO is a semiconductor, and thin lms made of it have strong conductivity and visible light permeability. It can be used to make light-permeable electrodes for solar batteries because of these qualities. It's also a promising material for ultraviolet-emitting devices and could be used as a transparent electrode in photovoltaic and electroluminescent equipment.296,297\n(8) The addition of zinc oxide cuts down on the amount of time needed for manufacture and boosts the resistance of concrete to the action of water. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc oxide into Portland cement causes a delay in the processes of hardening and quenching (i.e., it causes a delay in the progressive generation of heat), and it also results in an improvement in the whiteness and nal strength of the cement. Zinc silicates are compounds that are resistant to water and re that is formed when zinc oxide is combined with silicates (for example, sodium silicate). These compounds are utilized as paint binders. These compounds, which are resistant to re and act as adhesives, are put to use in the building industry to bind cements.

The active component of this catalyst is minute Cu particles, which are driven by their interaction with the zinc oxide substrate.298\n(9) In addition, zinc oxide is utilized in the production of typographic as well as offset inks. It offers superior qualities as a printing medium (high uidity). The utilization of zinc oxide helps to improve the covering power, pure shade, and longevity of the inks and it also prevents darkening from occurring. Zinc oxide is another ingredient that gives colours their shine.299\n13772 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\n(10) It can be discovered in a wide variety of meals, such as breakfast cereals, among others. Zinc is utilized from zinc oxide as a source of zinc, which is an important nutrient. Due to the unique chemical and antifungal properties of ZnO and its derivatives, they are also utilized in the manufacturing and packing of animal products (such as sh and meat) and vegetable items. These applications include: (e.g., peas and sweetcorn).300\n(11) Fungi and moulds are hampered in their attempts to form and grow when exposed to ZnO or one of its derivatives.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

As zinc oxide encourages healthy growth in animals, it is increasingly being used as an addition in animal feed. This trend is expected to continue. Additionally, it is utilized in the production of synthetic fertilizer.301\n(12) In addition, zinc oxide can be utilized in the eld of criminology, particularly in the process of mechanical ngerprint analysis. It is also included in cigarette lters because of its ability to selectively remove certain components of the smoke produced by tobacco products. To eliminate substantial quantities of H2S and HCN from tobacco smoke in a manner that does not result in the production of an offensive odour, lters are made of charcoal that has been loaded with zinc oxide and iron oxide. In addition to this, it is capable of extracting sulphur and compounds of sulphur from a wide variety of gases and liquids, most notably waste gases from industrial processes. In addition to this, zinc is capable of removing H2S from hydrocarbon gases and desulfurizing H2S together with other forms of sulphur.302\n(13) In addition, zinc oxide and its derivatives nd use in the automotive industry as a lubricant additive, where they help reduce fuel consumption and protect against oxygen corrosion. In addition, zinc oxide has been utilized in a range of lubricants, including solid lubricants, vibration-resistant lubricants,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In the not-toodistant future, the adhesive properties of ZnO could perhaps be utilized.303\n(14) Arnold et al.303 used individual nanobelts to create eld effect transistors (FETs). Using ultrasonication, large packets of zinc oxide nanobelts were diffused in ethanol until the majority of the nanobelts were separated. This process was repeated several times. In order to conduct an atomic force microscopy investigation, these distributed nanobelts were heated on a substrate made of SiO2/Si. Depositing zinc oxide nanobelt diffusions on SiO2/Si(p+) substrates and then heating them in an oxygen atmosphere at 800 \u00b0C for two hours was the process that was used to produce ZnO eld effect transistors (FETs). These substrates were rst spun coated with a polymer called poly methyl meth acrylate (PMMA), then baked, and nally exposed to electron-beam lithography so that electrode arrays could be developed and characterised. The leover PMMA was removed using hot acetone, and then a 30 nm titanium layer was formed using electron-beam evaporation to act as the source and drain for these electrodes. By altering the gate voltage, this FET device would be able to control the amount of current that was owing from the source to the drain.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785 | 13773\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Costenaro et al.304 used co-precipitation method to create ZnO nanoparticles with varying amounts of aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTS). They created LED devices using these ZnO nanoparticles and reported improved luminous characteristics. Liu et al.305 used a carbon cloth template hydrothermal technique to create a photodetector using exible nanoparticle-assembled ZnO cloth. Under UV irradiation, more than 600 separate measurements of the device's conductance were taken, and the response and decay periods came out to approximately 3.2 and 2.8 s, respectively.\n(16) Bagabas et al.306 advised ZnO nanoparticles for environmental applications. They spotted the photodegradation of cyanide ions while creating ZnO nanoparticles using cyclohexylamine in aqueous and ethanolic media. They found that the structure was essential to boosting the photocatalytic breakdown prociency of cyanide ion, and they discovered this. Hong et al.307 used a precipitation process to create ZnO nanoparticles, which had a high photocatalytic activity.\n(17) Because of their exceptional biocompatibility, ZnO nanoparticles have the potential to be utilized in various applications, including medication delivery and bioimaging308 and low cost.309 Nanoparticles with magnetic and luminous properties have potential as drug carriers and detecting probes, among other things.\n(18) Matsuyama et al.310 suggested biomedical uses of silicalayered zinc oxide quantum dots with biotin as uorophore for cell-labeling applications, as well as cautious destruction in malignant cell applications.311\n(19) Zinc oxide nanomaterials have shown that they can be used to detect DSSC substances312 and are used as UV blockers in sunscreen lotion.313 Based on their drug transport, anticancer, bioimaging activity, antibacterial, and antiinammatory properties, ZnO nanoparticles have demonstrated potential for usage in a variety of biomedical applications.314\n(20) Sun et al.315 proposed that ZnO nanostructures have the potential to be utilized in applications involving the collection of energy as a stretchable nanogenerator.\nSummary\nThe chemistry of nanomaterials (NMs) and nanoparticles (NPs) are a burgeoning eld of research and a rapidly expanding technological sector in a wide variety of application domains. Nanoparticles are separated into their respective categories based on their morphology, which refers to their structure, as well as their size and shape. One-dimensional nanomaterials, two-dimensional nanomaterials, and threedimensional nanomaterials are the three types of nanomaterials on the basis of their dimension. The most important innovations of the 21st century are the design and fabrication of nanoscale materials made of metal oxides, metals, carbon allotropes and chalcogenides. These materials are used in a vast range of elds, such as energy storage, catalysis and biosensors, conversion devices and biomedical applications. In particular, the unique physiochemical properties of\n13774 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 13735\u201313785\nsemiconducting metal oxides, such as SnO2, ZnO, and TiO2, which vary depending on size and shape, have been extensively researched and exploited. One of the most stable n-type semiconducting materials for chemical and thermal applications is ZnO, which is available in a variety of forms including pellets, bulk crystal and thin lm for use in everything from luminescent materials to batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells to biomedical and photocatalysis sensors. The variation of ZnO nanostructures is determined by the growth mechanism, the growth method, the synthesis conditions, and the type of substrate. Nanowires, Nanorods, nanotubes, nanocolumns, nanorings, nanobelts, nanosheet networks, nanoribbons, nanoowers, hollow micro- and nanospheres and nanocombs are among the nanostructures. These nanostructures can be fabricated quite easily at very low temperature, and a variety of different growth techniques for ZnO nanostructures have been documented, including chemical, physical and biological techniques. The process of chemical fabrication can be divided into two distinct phases: the gas phase and the liquid phase. The liquid phase can be further subdivided into precipitation/co-precipitation technique, colloidal technique, sol\u2013gel technique, oil microemulsion technique, hydrothermal technique, and solvothermal technique, while the gas phase can be further separated into pyrolysis and gas condensation techniques (CVD) and thermal evaporation. The three processes that fall under the category of physical synthesis are high-energy ball milling, solid, chemical and physical vapour deposition and laser ablation. Plant-mediated and microbe-mediated biological synthesis are the two types of biological synthesis. Because of the growth procedures, disciplines and applications that were discussed above, ZnO has the potential to become one of the most signicant candidates for use in future research and applications. Zinc oxide's vast range of useful chemical and physical properties have led to its application in a diverse range of industries. It has many different applications, ranging from ceramics to tyres, agriculture to pharmaceuticals, and chemicals to paints. It is also employed in a wide number of different industries.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declared no potential conicts of interest."
