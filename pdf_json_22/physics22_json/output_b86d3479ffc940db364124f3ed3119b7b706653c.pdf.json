            "text": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been established as a versatile route for the large-scale synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides, such as tungsten disulfide (WS2). Yet, the role of the precursor composition on the efficiency of the CVD process remains largely unknown and yet to be explored. Here, we employ Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) in a two-stage process to tune the oxygen content in tungsten oxide (WO3-x) precursors and demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the precursor films leads to a more facile conversion from WO3-x to WS2. Using a joint study based on ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we unravel that the oxygen vacancies in WO3-x can serve as niches through which sulfur atoms enters the lattice and may facilitate an efficient growth of WS2 crystals. By solely modulating the precursor stoichiometry, the photoluminescence emission of WS2 can be greatly enhanced, while the size of WS2 domains increases significantly. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals that tungsten vacancies are the dominant intrinsic defects in monoand bilayers WS2. Moreover, our data reveal that grain boundaries in bilayer WS2 emerge upon the coalescence of AA' and AB-oriented crystals, while turbostatic moir\u00e9 patterns originate upon formation of distinct grain boundaries between the bottom and bottom layers. The atomic resolution images show local strain buildup in bilayer WS2 due to competing effects of complex grain boundaries. Our study provides a means to tune the precursor composition in order to control the lateral growth of TMDs, while revealing insights into the different pathways for the formation of grain boundaries in bilayer WS2.\nTungsten disulfide (WS2) is an intriguing material in the layered transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) family. WS2 can usually exist in two phases with distinct electronic\nproperties, i.e., the 2H semiconducting phase with a trigonal prismatic geometry and 1T metallic\nphase with a tetragonal symmetry.1 In particular, 2H WS2 in its monolayer form is a direct band\ngap semiconductor, with an energy gap of ~2 eV, as demonstrated both theoretically and\nexperimentally.2,3 Among two-dimensional 2D TMDs, WS2 monolayers exhibit a high\nphotoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (> 6.3%), which can be further enhanced via doping,4,5,6\nexcellent thermal stability, mechanical flexibility7 and access to valley degree of freedom.8\nSeveral approaches have been exploited to obtain wafer-scale synthesis of TMD monolayers,\nincluding chemical vapor deposition (CVD),9,10 metal-organic chemical vapor deposition\n(MOCVD), 11,12 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),13 atomic layer deposition (ALD),14 pulsed laser\ndeposition (PLD).15,16,17,18 For instance,19 conventional CVD synthesis of 2D-TMDs involves\nevaporation of stoichiometric tungsten trioxide (WO3)4,9,20 or molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)\npowders.21 The narrow optimum window of the CVD synthesis requires a precise control of the\nprecursors vapor phase composition, chalcogen flow rate, etc. It has been shown that the\nconversion of MoO3 to MoS2 evolves via an intermediate step, during which MoO3 is first partially\nreduced and then sulfurized into MoS2.22 Moreover, on the basis of previous findings, variation in\nthe oxide precursor composition can greatly impact the growth of WS2 flakes.23,24. Recently, it was\ndemonstrated that the epitaxial oxide films grown by PLD can be used to produce quasi-crystalline\nTMDs with improved device performance.19 However, despite a vast number of studies on CVD\nsynthesis, the role of the oxygen vacancies of the precursors on the growth of TMD domains\nremains largely unexplored. This subject is of fundamental importance note only for the synthesis\nof TMDs, but also because oxygen substitution in basal plane TMDs can open new avenues for\nengineering of 2D electrocatalysts.25\nIn this work, we unravel how the presence of intrinsic oxygen vacancies in the non-stoichiometric\ntungsten oxides (WO3-x, 0< x<1) grown by PLD leads to a more facile conversion from WO3-x to\nWS2 films. A two-stage growth process was developed, which employs tunability of the oxygen\nvacancies in uniform WO3-x precursors to independently control the nucleation, lateral growth and\nultimately the WS2 domain size. Our study suggests that native oxygen vacancies in the PLD-\ngrown precursors can serve as active sites through which sulfur atoms enters the lattice and\nfacilitates the growth of WS2 crystals with high photoluminescence (PL) emission and large\ndomain size. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images reveal\nhow the single and bilayer WS2 crystal orientation develops for low-temperature (nearly\nstoichiometric oxides) compared to high-temperature (reduced oxides) grown precursors. By\nsolely modulating the precursor composition, the effect of precursor composition on the surface\ndiffusion and thus lateral growth can be clearly discerned, providing insights into the parameters\nthat control WS2 domain growth."

            "text": "To synthesize WS2 crystals, WO3-x (0< x<1) thin films and sulfur powder were used as precursors\nand reactant materials, respectively (see Materials and Methods). The WO3-x thin films were grown\nby PLD on (0001)-oriented Al2O3 substrates. To experimentally achieve a modulation of the\noxygen vacancy content (VO), WO3-x films were prepared at different substrate temperatures, i.e.\n500 \u00baC, 600 \u00baC, 700 \u00baC and 800 \u00baC and background gases, i.e., oxygen (O2) and argon (Ar). As it\nwill be discussed next, these two parameters determine the extent to which the VO content can be\ntuned in the precursor films. In contrast to the CVD process, which relies on the use of oxide\npowder, PLD allows the growth an uniform and epitaxial film as the precursor source. In a second\nstep, the as-grown oxide films were converted into WS2 in a standard CVD furnace at a\ntemperature of 900 \u00baC, which is a standard temperature for CVD synthesis of WS2.9\nWe performed high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the\ncomposition of WO3-x films. XPS data show that the WO3-x films grown in O2 at a temperature of\n500 \u00baC are nearly stoichiometric (Figure 1 and Table S1). The XPS spectrum of the W 4f consists\nof two spin\u2013orbit doublets corresponding to W6+ in fully coordinated WO3 (W 4f7/2 binding energy\n35.9 eV) and a small fraction of W5+ in reduced WO3-x (W 4f7/2 binding energy 34.7 eV).\nIncreasing the substrate temperature to 700 \u00baC and above, new W 4f doublets appear at binding\nenergies of 33.4 eV and 35.3 eV due to emergence of a lower valence state of W, i.e., W4+. The\npeaks at 41.7 eV and 40.4 eV were attributed to W 5p3/2. The corresponding S 2p spectra are shown\nin Figures S1 and S2 and the W 4f XPS spectra of O2-grown precursors are shown in Figure S3.\nTo further modulate the VO content, WO3-x films were grown by ablation of the WO3 target in Ar.\nThe XPS spectra of the corresponding WO3-x precursors reveal the presence of three distinct\nvalence states of W6+, W5+ and W4+ corresponding to the W 4f7/2 peak at binding energy of 35.9 eV,\n34.1 eV and 32.8 eV, respectively (Figure 1e-h). The evolution of the W chemical state in the\nWO3-x precursors with the change in the growth temperature and background gas is depicted in\nFigure 1 i,j. Films grown in O2 at 500 \u00baC have a very high fraction of WO3 (W6+ fraction of ~\n0.91), along with a small fraction of W5+ (~ 0.09). Here, Wx+ fraction, x= 4, 5, 6 denotes the ratio\nof the W 4f peak area (sum of the W4f7/2 and W4f7/2 peak areas) attributed to W in a given valence\nstate (Wx+) to the total W 4f peak area, i.e., the sum of W4+, W5+ and W6+ peaks areas. Increasing\nthe growth temperature to 600 \u00baC, the W5+ content increases to ~ 0.12. The most significant change\noccurs at 700 \u00baC, for which the fitting yields W fraction of W6+ ~ 0.79, W5+ ~ 0.10 and W4+ ~ 0.11.\nFinally, at the growth temperature of 800 \u00baC, the W4+ fraction increases to ~ 0.14. For the films\ngrown in Ar, a significant fraction of W4+ is already observed at 500 \u00baC (W4+~ 0.41) and which\nincreases to ~ 0.50 for oxides grown at 800 \u00baC.\nThe XPS analysis demonstrate that the oxygen deficiency (VO) in WO3-x precursors can be greatly\ntuned from O2 to Ar background gas, and to a degree significantly larger than reported\npreviously.26 The average composition of the films decreases from ~2.95 to ~2.45 from O2 to Ar-\ngrown films (see Table I). This significant variation in VO content arises from the different gas-\nphase reactions that occur during propagation of the plasma-plume in gas. The complex\nphenomena of laser ablation into gas, involving plasma-plume free expansion and shock wave\npropagation, has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies.27,28,29,30,31\nConsidering first the case of pulsed laser ablation in the reactive O2 gas, the plasma-plume\nexpansion in O2 leading to the formation and propagation of the shock wave favors the dissociation\nof the O2 molecules. The interaction of plasma plume species (i.e., W atoms and ions) with oxygen\nwill modify the plume chemistry through formation of molecular WO* excited species27. On the\ncontrary, in the case of the inert Ar gas, the plasma chemistry is quantitatively different and\ndetermined by the W and O atomic species. On the basis of our findings, we can conclude that for\nPLD in O2, the gas-phase reactions are an important pathway for the oxygen incorporation in WO3-\nx, which is not the case in Ar gas.\nThe stability of oxygen vacancies in sub-stoichiometric oxides can be explained through their\nformation energy determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The formation\nenergy (EF) of VO was calculated for various suboxides with compositions varying from WO2.944\nto WO2.0 (see Figures S7 and S8). In the whole range of oxide compositions, VO was found to have\nthe lowest formation energy for oxides close to stoichiometric WO3 (WO2.944) while the formation\nenergy of VO increases roughly 4 times from WO2.994 to WO2. Moreover, in the whole range of O\nchemical potential, formation energy of VO in WO2.944 was found to increase from 1.055 eV under\nan O-poor environment to 1.775 eV under an O-rich environment. This is well aligned with our\nexperimental observations, for which a high VO content was observed in films grown under an O2-\npoor environment and high temperature.\nWhile the theoretical calculations do not account for the stability of the aforementioned oxides,\nthey suggest that oxygen vacancies in WO3-x can easily form under O-poor environment. In\nparticular, oxygen vacancies are a signature of oxide films grown by PLD32 and can cause an\natomic re-arrangement of the WO3 crystal to compensate for the high oxygen deficiencies.33 Yet,\nthe detailed mechanism of surface reconstruction in sub-stoichiometric tungsten oxide is beyond\nthe scope of the work. A wide range of oxides can form between WO3 and WO2. Among all,\nW18O49 (WO2.72) and W20O58 (WO2.9) are the most thermodynamically stable phases, and which\nexhibit metallic characteristics as the Fermi level moves up in the conduction band as compared\nto the parent WO333,34. It is therefore likely that the aforementioned phases either co-exist in the\nPLD-grown films, or metastable oxides present in the PLD precursors transform into most\nthermodynamically stable phases during the CVD process. Nanostructures of WO2.72 were\npreviously synthesized by various approaches, such as heating a W foil at high temperature (1600\n\u00b0C)35, photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide by visible light36, thermally evaporating WO3\npowders, electron-beam induced synthesis37, etc.\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 1k and Figure S4 reveal that monolithically\ndistorted rutile (020)-oriented WO2 films can be grown on (0001) Al2O3 substrate.38 The (020)\nreflection of WO2 develops from a very broad to a sharp (020) oriented peak, indicating an\noptimum window growth of epitaxial-oriented WO2 between 600 \u00baC and 700 \u00baC. The b-axis\noriented growth of WO2 are similar to that of monoclinic MoO2.38,39 The WO2 reflection of the\nfilm grown at 800 \u00baC shifts significantly from 36.8\u00ba to 37.4\u00ba which can probably be assigned to a\nchange the a (002)-preferred oriented WO238.\nConversion from WO3-x to WS2 crystals\nThe W 4f XPS spectra of WS2 films obtained upon sulfurization of WO3-x precursors grown in Ar\nare shown in Figure 2. The W 4f XPS spectra of the sulfurized films can be tailored using three\ndoublets, in accordance with different valence states of W (see also Tables S2 and S3 for detailed\nW 4f and S 2p spectra peak fitting). A similar trend was observed for the precursors deposited in\nO2. The W 4f XPS spectra of WS2 exhibit a dominant W4+ doublet (W 4f7/2 binding energy at\n~32.6 eV, full width of half maximum (FWHM) ~ 0.7 eV) which corresponds to the hexagonal\n2H-WS2 phase9 with an estimated S/W ratio of ~2. In addition, residual WO3 is evidenced by the\npresence of the W4f doublet with W6+ valence state (W 4f7/2 binding energy at ~ 36.0 eV).40,41 We\nfind that the precursors grown at 500 \u2070C in Ar and sulfurized at 900\u2070C have a fraction of WO3 of\n~ 0.34 (see Table 1). In contrast, only an oxide fraction of ~ 0.20 was estimated in WS2 based on\n800 \u2070C-grown precursors, indicating a nearly complete conversion from oxide to sulfide. In\naddition, a low-intensity Wx+ doublet (binding energy W 4f7/2 at ~ 32.0 eV) is observed in the XPS\nspectra. Components at lower binding energies with respect to the hexagonal WS2 phase can be\neither assigned to the 1T-WS2 metallic phase42,43 or sulfur-deficient films.42 We hypothesize that\nthe doublet appears due to sulfur-deficient WS2 which may arise from sulfur-deficient grain\nboundaries, as well as various intrinsic point defects in pristine WS242. We note, however, that the\nsulfur-deficient WS2 fraction is very low (~ 0.08-0.06) and any variations are within the\nmeasurements accuracy (see Table 1). Lastly, the broad contributions at ~ 38.6 eV and ~ 41.6 eV\n(light green-colored curves in Figure 1) are assigned to the W 5p3/2 peaks.9,40,41 Since neither S-O\nbonds nor W-S-O bonds were observed in the XPS spectra (see S 2p XPS spectra in Figure S1),\nwe can conclude that, within the sensitivity of the XPS, the intermediate WOxSy phase is not\npresent in the sulfurized films for Ar-grown WO3-x films.\nOur experimental results indicate a more facile sulfurization for oxide precursors with of a high\nVO content. The sulfurization of WO3 in the presence of H2S has been studied extensively in the\npast44 and it was show that the reduction of W valence state (W6+ to W5+ ) is the first step in the\nsulfurization process. In addition, higher bond energy of W\u2013O (\u223c670 kJ/mol) compared to Mo\u2013O\n(\u223c560.2 kJ/mol) requires a higher temperature of conversion for WS2 as compared to MoS2\n(typically below 8000C when using PLD-grown MoOx films as precursors, not shown). Pathways\nto reduce the sulfurization temperature were demonstrated via the formation of atomic H in plasma\ndischarge which facilitates W reduction45.\nTo explore the thermodynamics of the process, we have performed DFT calculations to determine\nthe energy required to incorporate S atoms into the bulk WO3 crystal (see Methods and Figure S9\nfor details). Our calculations indicate that the addition of interstitial sulfur (Si) in WO3 requires a\nformation energy of 3.44 eV. On the other hand, the formation energy for sulfur atom on an oxygen\nvacancy site (SO) is only 2.55 eV; hence, incorporation of S atoms into the lattice is more\nenergetically favorable in the presence of oxygen vacancies as compared to the interstitial sites.\nNext, we have extended the modelling to investigate the energetics of the sulfurization process on\nthe WO3 (001) surface simulated by a slab model. Our theoretical calculations reveal that\nadsorbing a sulfur atom at the oxygen site (SO) site yields a negative adsorption energy of -1.256\neV. This suggests that sulfur adsorption on the WO3 (001) surface in the presence of an oxygen\nvacancy is highly energetically favorable. This allow us to conclude that oxygen vacancies in WO3-\nx can serve as niches through which sulfur atoms enters the lattice and trigger an efficient\nconversion of WO3-x into WS2.\nPL and Raman spectroscopy were used to examine the optical properties of WS2. The PL spectra\nof WS2 acquired using a 532 nm laser excitation wavelength are shown in Figure 3. Remarkably,\nthe PL spectra differ in peak intensity, peak position and FWHM as a function of the growth\ntemperature of the WO3-x precursors. The overall PL emission of WS2 increases ~40 fold with\nincreasing precursor growth temperature from 500 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C, whereas the FWHM of the PL\npeak decreases gradually from the 500 \u00b0C to 800 \u00b0C-based precursors (see Figure 3a, c, e, g). This\nsuggests that the optical quality of WS2 is higher for high temperature-based precursors as\ncompared to the low-temperature counterpart. All peaks marked with asterisk are associated with\nthe sapphire substrate.\nTo better understand the PL spectra, we consider the contribution of neutral exciton (X), negative\nexciton or trion (X\u00af), bi-exciton (XX), and defected-mediated exciton (D) to the overall PL\nemission of WS2.46,47,48 The optimal peak fitting was achieved with 100% Lorentzian functions.\nThe PL spectra of WS2 is dominated by the neutral exciton emission (A exciton), which shits from\n2.02 to 1.99 eV with increasing precursor growth temperature from 500\u00b0C to 800\u00b0C. We also find\nthat the spectral weight of the neutral X exciton decreases. The increase in the A exciton emission\nalong with the decrease of the FHWM of the peak indicates a lower presence of defects in the high\ntemperature-grown samples.4 Moreover, we observe the emergence of a low-energy emission\nfeature (D), which is attributed to excitons bound to defects.49 Similar sub-band gap PL features\nwere observed upon ion bombardment of 2D-TMDs. 49,50\nThe Raman spectra of WS2 display a Raman peak at ~178 cm-1 which corresponds to the\nlongitudinal acoustic LA(M) mode, a first-order Raman active mode of the LA phonons at the\nedge of the Brillouin zone (the M point)51. The dominant Raman feature at ~353 cm-1 can be\ndeconvoluted into three distinct contributions corresponding to the E2g1 (M) in-plane mode at\n~347 cm-1, 2LA(M), second-order Raman mode of the LA phonons at ~354 cm-1 and E2g1 (\u0413) in-\nplane vibration mode of the W and S atoms at ~357.5 cm-1, in a good agreement with previous\nwork52. In addition, the A1g(\u0393) peak at ~ 419 cm-1 corresponds to the out-of-plane vibration of the\nS atoms in WS2. The separation between the A1g(\u0393) and E12g(\u0413) Raman modes (denoted as \u0394k in\nTable II) is commonly used to identify the number of layers, whereas \u0394k of ~ 60 - 61 cm-1 denotes a monolayer WS251,52. \u0394k values of 60.7 cm-1, 61.1 cm-1, 61.3 cm-1 and 61.6 cm-1 were obtained\nfor the WS2 films grown using 500 \u2070C, 600 \u2070C, 700 \u2070C and 800 \u2070C Ar-deposited WO3-x precursors,\nrespectively (see Table 2). The data indicate that the sulfurized films consist predominantly of\nmono-bilayers WS2. A detailed discussion of the Raman peak assignments is given in the\nSupporting Information.\nOne remarkable difference is that the I2LA(M)/ IA1g(\u0393) ratio is the lowest for WS2 obtained from Ar-\ndeposited WO3-x precursors at 500 \u2070C (see Table 2). Small variations in the I2LA(M)/IA1g(\u0393) ratio can\narise from multilayer regions. We observe, however, that at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm,\nthe A1g(\u0393) peak is more enhanced for the 500 \u2070C-based precursors. As it will be discussed next,\nthis trend cannot be associated with resonance-enhanced Raman scattering. For monolayer WS2,\nthe first and second order Raman peaks (2LA(M), E12g(\u0413) and A1g(\u0393)) can be greatly enhanced for\nphoton energies corresponding the three optical exciton excitations, commonly labeled as XA, XB\nand XC52. In particular, the A1g(\u0393) peak is enhanced at ~2.4 eV which corresponds to the XB exciton\nenergy (B exciton)52. The B exciton energy (EB) can be calculated as EA+ \u2206SO, where EA is the A\nexciton energy and \u2206SO is the spin-orbit splitting energy. Considering \u2206SO of 0.39 eV for WS253,\nEB was estimated to vary between ~2.408 and ~2.388 eV for the 500 and 800 \u2070C-based precursors.\nAs the photon energy of 2.33 eV (532 nm) is far from the XB exciton energy, we can conclude that\nthe enhancement of the A1g(\u0393) peak due to resonance Raman scattering is negligible. An\nenhancement of A1g(\u0393) mode (as well as the LA(M) mode) can be observed in samples with high\ndensity of defects52,54. We can therefore conclude that WS2 monolayers based on 500 \u2070C Ar-\ndeposited WO3-x exhibit a higher amount of defects as compared to the high-temperature\ncounterpart. Previous findings have shown a clear correlation between the FWHM of the A1g(\u0413)\nmode, the doping level and the presence of defects52,54. For WS2 synthesized in this work, the\nFWHM of A1g(\u0393) mode increases with increasing the precursor growth temperature (see Table 2)\nand thus can be attributed to the reduced amount of defects.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal that the size and shape of the WS2 crystals varies\nsignificantly as a function of the nature of the precursors. WS2 domains with triangular-shaped\ngrains of ~ 200 nm in size are observed for films obtained from precursors grown at 500 \u2070C\n(Figure 4a). WS2 consists primarily of monolayers along with a smaller contribution from bilayers\n(Figure 4c). Similar morphology was observed for MoSe2 monolayers grown by PLD in vacuum55.\nFor the specimens based on the 700 \u2070C-precursors, the WS2 crystals become more circularly-\nshaped, of similar grain size of ~200 nm, while the average surface coverage of the monolayer\nincreases as compared to the low-temperature counterpart (see Figures S5 and S6). Finally,\nincreasing the precursor growth temperature to 800 \u2070C, large WS2 domains can be identified.\nFigure 4 shows AFM images of WS2, where large islands consisting of monolayer and multilayer\npatches are visible. At the edge of the sample (Figure 4 e,f), isolated triangles have edge lengths\nranging between 18 and 26 \u00b5m. Away from the edge of the film, i.e., in regions where the precursor\nfilms thickness increases (nucleation density is high), islands merge into a quasi-continuous\nmonolayer, and multilayer regions emerge, while the WS2 crystal size decreases (Figure S5).\nThe atomic structure of WS2 was studied using atomic-resolution annular dark-field (ADF)\nimaging using an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). For\nthis purpose, the WS2 specimens grown on sapphire were transferred onto a TEM grid, as described\nin Methods. Figure 5 shows the low-resolution STEM images of the as-transferred WS2 films\nbased on 500 and 800 0C-grown oxide precursors. The intensity of the STEM image is directly\nrelated to the atomic number of the atoms (Z) and with the number of atomic layers.15,56 The atomic\nstructure of 2H WS2 can be unambiguously distinguished in Figure 5d, in which sulfur atoms (Z =\n16) have much lower intensity than tungsten atoms (Z = 74). The most common point defects\nidentified in monolayer WS2 are single W vacancy (VW) and double W vacancies (V2W) (Figure\nS11), in good agreement with previous work.57 These intrinsic defects are observed for all\nspecimens, regardless on the precursor synthesis route. We also note that these intrinsic point\ndefects are significantly different from one-step growth PLD15 or sputtering,58 where antisite\ndefects are dominant intrinsic defects. This suggests that the WS2 domains grow under S-rich\nenvironment.59,60 While the AFM micrographs can only provide a microscale picture of the TMD\ndomains (Figure 4 a,c), atomic resolution images reveal the presence of triangular-shaped bilayer\nWS2 domains for all samples, regardless of synthesis conditions. Lastly, the XPS data reveal a\nhigh oxygen content in the sulfurized films in the form of oxide and to a lesser fraction as WOxSy.\nThe presence of the oxygen atoms in WS2 films could not be accurately assessed by means of\nSTEM as the relatively weak intensity contrast makes it difficult to distinguish between the sulfur\non oxygen site (SO) and S vacancy (VS).61\nWS2 bilayers obtained from 800 0C precursors are found to have predominantly the 2H (AA')/3H\n(AB) stacking (Figure 5b). In the case of bilayer WS2 based on 500 0C-grown precursors, the\natomic structure is more complex. Grain boundaries (GBs) formed by atomic stitching of randomly\noriented domains lead to the formation of bilayers with AA'/AB stacking, as well as turbostatic\nmoir\u00e9 patterns. Depending on the precise manner the bilayer meet, a wide variety of dislocation\ncores and grain boundaries can form. Figure 6 shows representative high-resolution images of\nbilayer WS2 with various GBs. When the bottom and top layers share the same GB, here referred\nto as bilayer GB, the WS2 bilayers have a 2H (AA')/3H (AB) stacking orientation (Figure 6a). In\nthis case, a monolayer forms by atomic stitching of domains with a tilt angle of 23.50, resulting in\ndislocation rings of different sizes, such as single and double W clusters consisting of aligned 8-\nfold dislocation rings, in agreement with previous reports.15 An atomic resolution image of a\nmonolayer WS2 with dislocation cores at the GB is shown in Figure S12. In the second stage of\nthe growth, top layers nucleate on individual domains maintaining a similar orientation of the\noriginal bottom grains (AA' and AB). They crystals continue to expand laterally until they reach\nthe GB, when the growth stops. A schematic of the GB in bilayer WS2 is shown in Figure 6g, left-\nhand sketch. Interestingly, we find that the on the length scale of several nanometers, the AA'\nstacked bilayer has undergone an in-plane translation, likely due to the build-up local strain near\nthe GB (Figure 6b). In addition to bilayer domains sharing the same GB, bilayers WS2 with distinct\nGBs for the bottom and top layers are observed (Figure 6d,e), resulting in the emergence of moir\u00e9\npatterns. In this case, in the first stage of the growth, low (7.50) and high-angle (20.50) monolayer\nGBs are formed. Similarly, top layers nucleate on grains A and B with AB/AA' crystal orientation.\nThe top layer which nucleates on grain A extends over the low-angle GB (7.50) on the neighboring\ngrain resulting in the formation of a turbostatic moir\u00e9 pattern (bilayer C). On the contrary, the top\nlayer which nucleates on grain B stops at the high-angle GB. We hypothesize that the formation\nof the moir\u00e9 pattern in bilayer WS2 is more energetically favorable for low-angle GB. A zoom-in\nview of the atomic structure of the GB reveals how the bilayer stacking orientation develops from\nAB to a moir\u00e9 pattern without a lattice discontinuity (Figures 6e, S13 and S14). Again, an in-plane\ntranslation of the bilayer is observed in the high-resolution STEM image. Here, several competitive\nfactors, i.e., weak interlayer van der Waals forces and intralayer GB results in a buildup strain in\nthe bilayer structure."

The presence of oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxide film is highly\nfavorable for successful film conversion. The optimized oxide growth conditions (800 \u2070C\ndeposition temperature using Ar background pressure) results in formation of a stoichiometric 2H-\nWS2 monolayer film with a large size of crystals, reaching 26 um on the films edges."

            "text": "A customized pulsed laser deposition (PLD) setup consisting of a target carousel equipped with a water cooled baffle (from McAllister Technical Services) and an IR lamp substrate heating system (from AJA International INC) was used to first produce a variety of tungsten oxide precursors which were then sulfurized for conversion to WS2 crystals. The cooling of the target is not critical in this work, but from our experience it is strictly necessary for ablation of sulfide materials.\nGrowth of precursor epitaxial WOx films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The thin-films were grown by laser ablation of WO3 target (1 inch diameter, 6 mm thickness, 99.95% purity, from Testbourne Ltd.) using a 248 nm KrF laser (pulse duration \u03c4=20 ns) operating at laser frequency of 1 Hz. The target was placed at a distance of ~7 cm from the substrate. Prior growth, the target was ablated using a number of 30 laser pulses. During deposition, the laser beam was rastered across the target using motorized mirrors and the target was rotated at the angular speed of 6 rpm to ensure uniform ablation and consequently films with a good thickness uniformity. The laser fluence on the target was maintained at ~ 1.5 J/cm2. Prior deposition, the vacuum chamber was pumped down to base pressure of ~5 \u00d7 10-7 mbar and background gas was introduced manually using a needle valve. To growth of oxide precursors was carried out O (99.9995% purity, Air Liquide Danmark A/S) or Ar (99.9999% purity, Air Liquide Danmark A/S). In all experiments, the gas pressure was maintained at 5 \u00d7 10-3 mbar. The films were grown (0001) Al2O3 and SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates of 1 x 1 cm2 in size cut from large wafers. Before loading the substrates into the PLD chamber, they were sequentially cleaned in acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and deionized water (DI) water for 10 min in each solvent combined with sonication. The substrate were heated using a ramp rate of 15 \u2070C/min to the desired growth temperature and finally cooled down to room temperature using a similar cooling rate of 15 \u2070C/min. The WOx precursors were grown on a temperature range varying from 500 \u2070C to 800 \u2070C using a number of ~40 laser pulses. A minimum number of 30 pulses was required to obtain any deposition.\nSulfurization of WOx films. The sulfurization of WOx precursor films was performed as follows. (1) Firstly, the precursor films were placed facing up onto a flat graphite plate and loaded in the middle of the three-zone tube furnace of a 3 inch outside diameter. A narrow alumina ceramic boat containing \u223c2.0 g of sulfur flakes (\u226599.99 % purity, from Sigma Aldrich) was placed outside the main heating area of the quartz tube and heated independently using an external heater. The distance between the ceramic boat and the samples was 35 cm. (2) The system was pumped down to 5 \u00d7 10-2 mbar and sequentially flushed 5 times by pressuring to 500 mbar with Ar-H2 mixture (5 % volume fraction, 99.9995 % purity, Air Liquide Danmark A/S) to remove residual gases, such as oxygen and water vapor. Then, a 200 sccm Ar-5 % H2 gas flow was introduced as a carrier gas throughout the entire process. The tube furnace was then heated at a rate of 15 \u2070C/min to 900 \u2070C and the sulfurization process took place at 900 \u2070C for 30 min. Moreover, when the furnace\ntemperature reached 900 \u2070C, the external heater was set to 250 \u2070C to produce an adequate sulfur evaporation rate. The system was finally cooled down at a rate of 15 \u2070C/min to 500 \u2070C, and then naturally to room temperature."

The samples were illuminated through a 40x objective lens (NA=0.75), type Nikon CFI Plan Flour. The spectrometer is a Spectra Pro HRS-750 scanning monochromator from Princeton Instruments equipped with suitable gratings of 300 gr/mm (for PL measurements) and 1800 gr/mm (for Raman acquisition) and a cryogenicallycooled, ultra-low noise Pylon CCD camera, type PyLoN:100BR from Princeton Instruments. The wavelength calibration was carried using an Ar-Ne light source mounted directly on a side entrance slit of the spectrometer. The spectrometer resolution was found to be \u223c1 cm-1 at 532 nm. Raman spectra were collected using various integration time and then normalized. The PL spectra were taken at a low laser power below 10 mW to prevent overheating. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The morphologies of the WS2 crystals grown on either (0001) sapphire or SiO2/Si substrates were analyzed using a Zeiss Merlin microscope operated using an In Lens detector, acceleration voltages in the 1\u22122 kV and working distance between 3 and 4 cm. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM measurements were conducted at room temperature using a Bruker Icon AFM microscope. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Nexsa XPS system with Al K\u03b1 1486.6 eV excitation source. The energy scale of the XPS was calibrated using Au 4f7/2 line centered at 84.0 eV, and the line positions were calibrated using W4f7/2 peak of WO3 at 36.0 eV, which is present in all the samples.\nScanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). The WS2 specimens were transferred onto a TEM grid with the aid of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) coating followed by KOH etching. CAB is used because of its hydrophobic nature compared to the hydrophilic substrate. In this transfer process the CAB solution (20 mg/100 ml in ethyl acetate) produces 15 \u00b5m-thick polymer. The specimens on sapphire were spin coated with CAB using a 1500 rpm rotation speed followed by heating for few minutes on a hot plate. The samples were dipped inside KOH solution in order\nto etch them from sapphire and washed several times with DI water for the complete removal of KOH. The samples were then transferred to TEM grid and kept them in air for several minutes for drying. The presence of the samples before and after cleaning with acetone were confirmed by Raman measurement. Afterwards, the samples were cleaned with acetone to remove CAB on the samples. The samples transferred on the TEM grid were baked at a temperature of 160 \u00b0C in vacuum for 8 h before loading them in the STEM chamber for imaging. The STEM measurements were performed using an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM 100 microscope equipped with a cold field emission gun. The images were acquired at an acceleration voltage of 60 kV and a semiconvergence angle of 31 mrad. DFT Calculations. The DFT calculations were performed within the projected-augmented (PAW) method implemented in the electronic structure code GPAW (21). We used a plane wave basis set with a cutoff of 800 eV and included exchange and correlations with the Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) functional (20). Reciprocal space was sampled with a k-point density of 6 \u00c5-1 including the \u0393 point. The atomic positions were relaxed at a fixed cell until forces were less than 10-2 eV\u00c5-1."
