    "abstractText": "Pre-clinical and clinical scientific endeavours provide complementary perspectives on fundamental biological processes of translational value. Harnessing the information value on the totality of such knowledge requires novel approaches to integrate across the breadth of experimental space. High-throughput screens are often the first step on this bridge to the patient. However, their representative capacity to encompass all the cellular contexts encountered in a patient are often limited due to experimental constraints. Thus, we present PerturbX, a new deep learning model to predict transcriptional responses to chemical or genetic perturbations in unobserved cellular contexts, and to uncover interpretable factors of variation associated with the predicted response. PerturbX can be applied in both an unimodal or multimodal setting. We believe that our proposed approach has the ability to inform novel biomarker discovery and contribute to a redefinition of the drug development pipeline.",

            "text": "The opportunities in precision oncology are expanding at an increasing pace. One important driving factor has been the explosion in diverse pre-clinical and clinical datasets. Key initiatives include the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia & Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, 2015), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program (Weinstein et al., 2013) and the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) (Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017).\nAn unresolved question remains as to how best to harness and integrate the insights gained by such distinct but inter-related endeavours. One component will involve the identification and validation of signatures to map between the pre-clinical and clinical settings. It should be a bidirectional relationship. Insights gained in the pre-clinical domain should be of value in the clinical domain and vice versa.\nIn such a light, information-rich phenotypes provide opportunities to capture a detailed picture of the cellular consequences of chemical or genetic perturbations which, in specific contexts, may have a downstream effect on cellular fitness. Gene expression profiles in particular are a robust and informative phenotypic measure of cellular responses to perturbations. They can be applied to a wide range of applications, including advancing our understanding of gene regulatory networks\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\nand the mechanism of action of screened compounds. Furthermore, single cell level cellular profiles enable interrogation of phenotypic heterogeneity at a level which has been hitherto inaccessible.\nHigh-throughput screens are utilized to profile transcriptional states across multiple cellular contexts under different perturbations (McFarland et al., 2020). However, their representative capacity is still limited relative to the vast combinatorial landscape of all cell type - perturbation pairs. Therefore, a computational model which learns from observed experimental data to predict outcomes in unobserved cellular contexts is of immense value.\nWe propose PerturbX, a novel deep learning model trained to predict the transcriptional effect of a given perturbation in a range of cellular contexts (e.g. different cell types), in which the perturbational response has not been experimentally observed. PerturbX is based on an encoder - decoder architecture that learns a mapping between the unperturbed state representation of cells to the transcriptional effect of a given perturbation. Furthermore, we show that the model is able to uncover interpretable factors of variation within the unperturbed state which are associated with the observed transcriptional response patterns. These \u201cbiomarkers\u201d of response could ultimately be mapped between the pre-clinical and clinical settings and thereby advance our understanding of the representative capacity of cell models for patient-based in vivo biology.\nIn the setting presented in this paper, the unperturbed state is represented by the unperturbed gene expression profiles of cell lines, and the transcriptional effect is represented by the vector of differential expression. However, the proposed approach is flexible and can be applied in a multimodal fashion. Gene expression profiles at the input could be easily expanded by incorporating mutational profiles as one example. Such considerations would be guided by individual projectspecific requirements.\nOur main contributions are:\n1. We introduce PerturbX and demonstrate its ability to successfully predict transcriptional responses to perturbations in unseen cellular contexts using data readily available in the public domain.\n2. We show that PerturbX can learn biologically meaningful and interpretable representations of cell types.\n3. We propose a method for identifying the predictive features, or biomarkers, captured by PerturbX."

            "text": "Several methods have been recently proposed to address the challenge of predicting the transcriptional response of cells to a range of perturbations. These methods are predominantly based on variational approaches.\nscGen (Lotfollahi et al., 2019) utilises a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to predict the post-perturbation single cell distribution in unobserved cell types. trVAE (Lotfollahi et al., 2019) also uses a CVAE with the addition of Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularisation to the decoder network. Compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA) (Lotfollahi et al., 2021) aims to predict transcriptional responses across different cell types, doses and combinations. It learns disentangled representations of these attributes in order to then generate predictions from unseen combinations of the observed attributes. However, CPA does not generalise to novel cell types or novel perturbations. ChemCPA (Hetzel et al., 2022) is a recent extension of CPA which can generalise predictions to unseen perturbations. sVAE+ (Lopez et al., 2022) is a variant of the sparse VAE model (Lachapelle & Lacoste-Julien, 2022) which assumes that each perturbation changes a small number of latent variables. It exploits the sparse mechanism shift assumption to learn causally interpretable disentangled representations.\nIn contrast to previous works, we suggest a non-generative approach to the problem of postperturbation transcriptional prediction. We formulate this as a regression problem in which we aim to learn a mapping from an unperturbed state representation of a specific cellular context to the corresponding transcriptional effect under a given perturbation. Such a mapping allows our model to generalise to unseen cellular contexts and to discover predictive signatures of response which can ultimately be carried over to and utilised in clinical settings. Furthermore, this choice encourages latent proximity between cell types which respond similarly, rather than cell types with similar unperturbed expression. Consequently, the resulting latent representation is simpler and more relevant to the task at hand. 1"

            "text": "PerturbX is a deep learning model trained to predict the transcriptional effect of a perturbation across cellular contexts by learning a perturbation-specific cell type representation. This representation captures the complex transcriptional similarities between different cell types in response to a specific compound or genetic perturbation, and is inferred from features of the unperturbed state of a cell. The proposed method allows for generalisation on experimentally unobserved cell types.\nThe model architecture is based on an encoder-decoder network. However, unlike classical autoencoders, we do not aim to reconstruct the input but rather predict a high-dimensional response vector.\nThe input to the model is a set {xi \u2208 Rn}Ki=1 of K single cells from a specific cell type. Each xi is a n-dimensional vector representing the cellular context of the cells in their unperturbed state. A natural choice for this representation is the unperturbed expression profile of n genes in the cell which can be obtained on the single-cell level. This could be expanded to include additional modalities, such as the mutation status or copy number variations (CNV) for each gene. However, it is expected that these latter modalities would be homogenous between single cells arising from the same cell type. The output of the model is the predicted differential expression (DE) vector, x\u0302DE \u2208 Rn which indicates the transcriptional effect on that cell type. For simplicity, we define this target vector to be the difference in mean expression values between the perturbed and control (e.g. DMSO-treated) single cell populations, xDE = (Xperturbed \u2212 XDMSO). We note one could\n1We note that some of the methods mentioned above, such as scGen, can only infer the perturbed distribution of cell-types whose unperturbed distribution has been observed during training. Our method is more flexible in the sense that it requires access to the unperturbed distribution of gene expression only at inference time.\nalternatively utilize the second moment and normalize this vector by the sample covariance matrix, e.g. xDE = \u03a3\n\u22121(Xperturbed \u2212 XDMSO), assuming that \u03a3perturbed = \u03a3DMSO = \u03a3 in a manner similar to Linear Discriminant Analysis.\nWe formulate this as a set prediction problem (see section 3.1) where each single cell xi in the set is transformed into its lower dimensional representation, zi = \u03d5(xi). For every cell type, the set {zi}Ki=1 is then averaged to produce the latent vector zavg \u2208 Rd which summarizes the latent representation for that specific cell type. Finally, zavg is propagated through the decoder to produce the predicted differential expression vector, x\u0302DE \u2208 Rn.\nThe choice of defining the target variable to be the differential expression rather than the perturbed expression itself is motivated by the fact that perturbation effects are usually manifested as fluctuations around the unperturbed expression in a limited number of genes. Consequently, to predict the full perturbed transcriptome, the latent representation has to preserve most of the information on xi and will mostly reflect similarities in the unperturbed transcriptome. By focusing on the differential expression, the latent representation is encouraged to learn a low-dimensional representation of the perturbation effect and discard all information not relevant for this task.\nTo train our model, we minimize the following loss function:\nL = 1\nC C\u2211 c=1 wT \u00b7 \u2225\u2225\u2225xDE(c) \u2212 x\u0302DE(c) )\u2225\u2225\u22252 + \u03b2 \u00b7 Kc\u2211 j=1 [ \u2225zj\u22252 ] where C is the number of different cell types in the data and xDE(c) and Kc are respectively the differential expression vector and the number of single cells in the unperturbed population of cell type c. \u03b2 is the regularisation strength, controlling the flexibility of the latent representation to avoid model overfitting and w is a gene weighting vector that reflects the variability of each gene in response to the given perturbation. In our experiments we set wi = 1 if gene i is in the top k most highly variable genes, otherwise wi = 0.01. The choice of k is data-dependent with typical values in our experiments being between 50 \u2212 200. Alternatively, a continuous weighting which is proportional to the variability could also be explored.\nTo maintain constant set sizes and induce stochasticity during training, we use a bootstrapped sample of single cells for each cell type in each training step. For a certain cell type A, let XA be the set of unperturbed single cells of type A, then the model takes in the bootstrapped sample Xbs \u2286 XA and is trained to reconstruct the target response vector xDE = Xperturbed \u2212 Xbs, i.e., the difference between the mean expression of the perturbed cell population and the bootstrapped DMSO treated sample."

Instead, we propose to focus on the general effect of the perturbation on each specific cell type. We observe that attempts in predicting the distribution of single cells may sometimes miss the average effect of the perturbation and is mostly accurate for genes with simple unimodal distributions. By simplifying the target variable and focusing on the average effect, we are able to distill the information that is associated with different forms of response and achieve more accurate predictions in unobserved cellular contexts.\nAs described above, we form our post-perturbation predictions from the single cell distribution of the observed unperturbed state in the following way: denoteXA = {x |x in unperturbed population of cell type A}, and let xADE be the differential expression vector indicating the perturbation response of cell type A, then the function learned by the model f : R|X A|\u00d7n \u2192 Rn should satisfy f ( XA ) = xADE .\nClearly, this is a set prediction problem and so f should be permutation-invariant with respect to the set XA. Thus, we follow the structure from Zaheer et al. (2017) in which f = \u03c8( \u2211 x\u2208XA \u03d5(x))\nand adapt it to the encoder-decoder structure such that \u03d5(\u00b7) is parameterized by the encoder network, the aggregation is done over the latent embeddings and \u03c8(\u00b7) is parameterized by the decoder network."

            "text": "A key aspect of the perturbation response prediction is the ability to explain the predicted outcome. This can be done by identifying the factors of variation in the input which contribute the most to the predicted outcome. If the unperturbed state representation consists of the gene expression profiles, this corresponds to identifying the genes whose up- or down-regulation has a strong effect on the model\u2019s response prediction, or equivalently, on the latent embedding of the cell types.\nProviding explanations for predictions made by deep networks is not a trivial task. Further complexity is added by the high-dimensional space of the network outputs. To address these difficulties, we make a few simplifications. First, we consider the latent representation, Z as the output variable which we aim to explain. Z is trained to capture a low-dimensional representation of the response. Changes in Z reflect axes of variation in the predicted differential expression. Second, we further simplify the output variable by decomposing the latent representation into its principal components in order to identify the features that affect the outcome in each separate axis of variation.\nTo identify the input features that contribute to the variability in a given axis, we train an auxiliary interpretable regression model to recapitulate the encoder\u2019s outputs along that axis. More formally, let X \u2208 RM\u00d7n be the set of all single cells in our training data where M is the number of cells and n is the number of genes in the transcriptome. If Z = \u03d5(X) \u2208 RM\u00d7d denotes the latent embeddings of the single cells and wk \u2208 Rd denotes the k\u2019th principal component of Z, then the auxiliary regression model is trained to approximate the function X \u2192 \u03d5(X) \u00b7 wk. It is important to note that by inspection of the data variability along a chosen principal component, one can associate a subset of input features with specific changes in the response. The proposed decomposition into principal components loses the global structure of Z. However, it serves as a pragmatic compromise between model explainability and a rich latent representation required for predictive capacity. Explainability is essential to ensure PerturbX will be widely adopted by biological and clinical domain experts."

A novel method, MIX-Seq, was developed by McFarland et al. (2020) to enable multiplexed single cell post-perturbational transcriptional pooling on a diverse range of 25 \u2013 100 cell lines. Gene expression profiles were assessed at 6- or 24-hours post-perturbation. All experiments included Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment as a negative control.\nFor detailed exploration, we excluded perturbations which induced homogenous responses across all cell lines since the predictive task in such cases is trivial. We also excluded perturbations for which the single-cell population in each condition was too small to reflect their underlying distribution. After filtering according to these exclusion criteria, the three most suitable perturbations to take forward for investigation were selected: idasanutlin, trametinib and dabrafenib. The transcriptional responses to trametinib and dabrafenib are highly correlated. Trametinib was selected as the representative example.\nIdasanutlin and trametinib share similar high-level biological features. They are both small molecule inhibitors whose response is closely linked to established signaling pathways. Both inhibitors are expected to demonstrate heterogenous perturbational responses in different cellular contexts. Idasanutlin and trametinib are in clinical trial development or established in routine clinical practice. Therefore, they are representative of the challenges faced in translational drug development. In all conducted experiments, we benchmarked the predictive performance of PerturbX\nto scGen since scGen allows for predicting the transcriptional outcomes in unobserved cell lines."

            "text": "Idasanutlin blocks the interaction of MDM2 with p53 (Ding et al., 2013). p53 is an established tumor suppressor (Baker et al., 1989). In its native context, MDM2 binds to p53 resulting in the enzymatic degradation of p53 (Momand et al., 1992). Idasanutlin binds directly to MDM2, blocks the MDM2-p53 interaction and thereby restores the tumour suppressive properties of p53 (Ding et al., 2013). TP53 is the gene encoding the p53 protein. Many cancer cell lines have inactivating mutations in TP53 which prevent them from responding to idasanutlin (Michaelis et al., 2011).\nFigure 2 shows an UMAP embedding of the gene expression profiles colour-coded by (a) cell type and (b) idasanutlin and DMSO perturbations. The embeddings distinguish cell lines according to response to idasanutlin. Non-responsive cell lines show overlap between the DMSO and idasanutlintreated clusters whilst responsive cell lines show cluster separation.\nThe biology of p53 is complex and has many intricacies which can be challenging to functionally deconvolve. We hypothesize PerturbX can integrate such intricacies into the trained latent representations of the unperturbed cell lines in order to establish the model\u2019s predictive capacity for the post-perturbation setting.\nWe hold out three different cell lines, SNU1079, DKMG and BICR31, and train the model on all other cell lines. SNU1079 and DKMG are TP53 wild-type (WT) and show significant transcriptional responses to idasanutlin. In contrast, BICR31 is TP53 mutated and shows no transcriptional effect. Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of the true vs predicted differential expression profiles of response to idasanutlin generated by PerturbX (top) and scGen (bottom) in the three unobserved cell lines. It demonstrates the model\u2019s ability to distinguish responsive and non-responsive cell lines according to TP53 mutational status and to make accurate predictions of the transcriptional effect. scGen by design averages the transcriptional effect in the latent space over all observed cell lines. In contrast, PerturbX identifies the specific cell lines which are expected to respond most similarly to the predicted unobserved cell line.\nTo investigate how PerturbX can capture a biologically representative latent embedding, we next examined the 2D UMAP plots of the trained latent embedding Z. The UMAP plots are shown in Figure 4a. It confirms that cell lines are mapped to different regions of the Z space according to TP53 status. TP53 mutant cell lines in the training and test data cluster together and in a region distinct compared to TP53 wild-type cell lines. Therefore, the latent embeddings cluster according to important biological axes. Furthermore, the difference in the predicted differential expression for\nSNU1079 and DKMG, together with the UMAP embedding, reveal the model\u2019s ability to capture an even more granular heterogeneity in response within the group of TP53 WT cell lines.\nWe next determined the contribution of the input features (gene list) on the predicted outcome, as described in section 3.2. We trained an auxiliary Random Forest Regressor (Breiman, 2001) to approximate the function X \u2192 \u03d5(X) \u00b7w1, where w1 is the first principal component of Z. Feature importance was assessed by the Shapley (SHAP) values of the auxiliary regression model. The list of top 10 genes is shown in Figure 4b. 7 out of the 10 genes are known TP53 targets: CCL2 (Tang et al., 2012), RRAD (Zhang et al., 2014), RPS27L (He & Sun, 2007), TPM1 (Tang et al., 2018), NUPR1 (Lopez et al., 2015) , C1QL1 (Mei et al., 2008) and MDM2 (Momand et al., 1992).\nFurthermore NDUFA4L2, a component of the electron transport chain complex I subunit (Meng et al., 2019), and p53 share a common regulator HIF-1\u03b1, a transcription factor which accumulates under moderate and severe hypoxia (Meng et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2003)."

            "text": "We next evaluated PerturbX under compound treatment with trametinib on a larger RNA-seq dataset involving 97 cell lines. Trametinib is a reversible allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 (Wright & McCormack, 2013). MEK1 and MEK2 are closely related kinases. They are a component of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK extracellular signaling pathway which is involved in driving cell proliferation and survival (Ohren et al., 2004).\nBRAF mutations result in dependency on MEK signaling (Solit et al., 2006). Trametinib has been most extensively explored in the context of the BRAF V600E/V600K mutational background (Solit et al., 2006). At a clinical level, trametinib is approved for use in combination with dabrafenib in patients with advanced melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600 mutation (Robert et al., 2019; Planchard et al., 2017).\nCompared to idasanutlin, the transcriptional response profiles to trametinib are significantly more diverse and heterogenous, with several genes showing pronounced effect in a small subset of cell lines. Such heterogeneity in response to trametinib treatment makes it significantly more challenging for the model to capture the exact differential expression profile in an unobserved cell line. In spite of such difficulty, PerturbX is still able to effectively capture the diverse response patterns and learn a meaningful representation of the different cell lines.\nWe adopted the same experimental pipeline as utilised in our investigations of idasanutlin. We selected three cell lines with diverse response profiles for our hold out set: UACC257, NCIH2347 and LNCAP clone FGC. UACC257, a melanoma cell line with a BRAF V600E mutation and NCIH2347, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line with a KRAS L19F mutation demonstrated a marked transcriptional response to trametinib. In contrast, LNCAP, a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line which is BRAF and KRAS WT, showed minimal response to trametinib.\nThe predictive performance of PerturbX compared to scGen in the hold out set is shown in Figure 5a. In spite of the limited number of cell lines sensitive to trametinib, PerturbX could reliably distinguish between the responsive vs non-responsive setting. The predicted differential response is in accordance with the published literature on MEK targeted therapies. In the trametinib-responsive cases, Perturbx outperformed scGen as confirmed by a lower MSE.\nThe diversity in response to trametinib naturally lends itself to a more complex latent representation. Such a representation should be flexible enough to reflect the heterogenous responses to trametinib whilst also remaining tightly regularised to avoid model overfitting. As a qualitative evaluation of the learned representation, we explored the UMAP embedding of the latent space and focused on the trametinib responsive cell lines from the hold out set, UACC257 and NCIH2347. Cell lines from the training set were ranked according to their similarity in response to UACC257 and NCIH2347. Similarity was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient of the differential expression vectors. We see that the unobserved cell lines are mapped close to two out of the three most similar cell lines in terms of the transcriptional effect, demonstrating that PerturbX can effectively capture the features in the unperturbed state which indicate the similarity in response."

We demonstrate the ability of PerturbX to capture a low dimensional representation of the \u201cresponse space\u201d in which cell types are embedded close together if they exhibit similar transcriptional responses to a given perturbation and to generalise to unobserved cellular contexts. Furthermore, PerturbX identifies genetic features from the unperturbed state which most significantly contribute to the predicted output in a manner aligned with a priori domain-specific knowledge. Significantly, this combined ability showcases the unique potential of PerturbX to inform novel biomarker discovery whilst remaining congruous to the relevant underlying biology.\nThe architecture presented in this paper allows expansion of the representation of the unperturbed state from gene expression profiles to additional modalities, such as mutation status or CNV. However, future work is needed to evaluate the contribution of such multimodal learning. We hypothesize that it may improve response predictions by maximizing the information content of the learned representation, potentially by integrating information from orthogonal biological axes which are often inter-dependent and exhibit complex correlation relationships. Multimodal learning may also address some of the challenges arising from technical biases specific to the unimodal space. Expansion into multimodal learning will likely require larger datasets for model training and potential model adaptations.\nIn summary, the future opportunities and challenges offered by PerturbX sits at the evolving interface between ML and biology. It signals the future of ML-guided experimental design which will bridge across traditional interdisciplinary boundaries."
