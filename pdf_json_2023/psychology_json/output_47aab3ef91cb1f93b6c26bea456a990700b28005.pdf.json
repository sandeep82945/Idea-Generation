    "abstractText": "We developed here the efficient photocatalysts for the removal of high concentrations of tetracycline under visible light by immobilizing the AWO (A = Ag, Bi, Na) nanocrystals on the surface of siligraphene (g\u2010SiC) nanosheets. The g\u2010SiC/AWO composites was synthesized by magnesiothermic synthesis of g\u2010SiC and sonochemical immobilization of tungstates. These new heterojunctions of g\u2010SiC/tungstates show superior photocatalytic activities in the degradation of high concentrations of tetracycline and 97, 98, and 94% of tetracycline were removed by using low amounts of g\u2010SiC/Ag2WO4, g\u2010SiC/Bi2WO6, and g\u2010SiC/Na2WO4 catalysts, respectively. Based on band structures, the band gaps reduce and the photocatalytic activities were extremely enhanced due to the shortening of electron transfer distance through the Z\u2010scheme mechanism. Also, the graphenic structure of g\u2010SiC is another parameter that was effective in improving photocatalytic performance by increasing the electron transfer and decreasing the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination. Furthermore, the \u03c0 back\u2010bonding of g\u2010SiC with metal atoms increases the electron\u2013hole separation to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, g\u2010SiC composites (g\u2010SiC/AWO) showed much higher photocatalytic properties compared to graphene composites (gr/AWO) and can remove the tetracycline even at dark by producing the oxygenated radicals via adsorption of oxygen on the positive charge of Si atoms in siligraphene structure.",

The g\u2011SiC/AWO composites was synthesized by magnesiothermic synthesis of g\u2011SiC and sonochemical immobilization of tungstates. These new heterojunctions of g\u2011SiC/tungstates show superior photocatalytic activities in the degradation of high concentrations of tetracycline and 97, 98, and 94% of tetracycline were removed by using low amounts of g\u2011SiC/Ag2WO4, g\u2011SiC/Bi2WO6, and g\u2011SiC/Na2WO4 catalysts, respectively. Based on band structures, the band gaps reduce and the photocatalytic activities were extremely enhanced due to the shortening of electron transfer distance through the Z\u2011scheme mechanism. Also, the graphenic structure of g\u2011SiC is another parameter that was effective in improving photocatalytic performance by increasing the electron transfer and decreasing the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination. Furthermore, the \u03c0 back\u2011bonding of g\u2011SiC with metal atoms increases the electron\u2013hole separation to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Interestingly, g\u2011SiC composites (g\u2011SiC/AWO) showed much higher photocatalytic properties compared to graphene composites (gr/AWO) and can remove the tetracycline even at dark by producing the oxygenated radicals via adsorption of oxygen on the positive charge of Si atoms in siligraphene structure.\nToday, with the progress of human civilization and population growth, we are facing a severe water shortage and reduction of water quality due to various pollutions1,2. Wastewaters treatments are very expensive, and traditional methods in addition to imposing heavy costs do not meet the relevant standards in many cases. Recently, with the introduction of new technologies, new solutions such as novel photocatalysts, membranes, and environmentally friendly adsorbents have been introduced for wastewater treatments3\u20136. Photocatalysts are an important class of nanomaterials used in the purification of heavily polluted water and are very effective when other purification methods are not useful or economical7\u201310.\nAmong the wide range of metal-containing photocatalysts7\u201317, the tungstates with the general formula of A2WOx (AWOs) are considered to be the promising candidates with great photocatalytic potentials due to the unique electronic structure, wide band gap, good chemical stability, and physicochemical properties18\u201328. However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs reduces the potential of these catalysts to remove the high concentration pollutants18\u201328. To overcome this limitation, these photocatalysts combined with other materials to reduce the recombination rate. Graphene and its derivations are wildly used as metalfree co-catalysts to enhance photocatalytic performance by promoting charge transfer and reducing the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination24\u201331.\nAlso, interface engineering such as the fabrication of heterojunctions is an effective solution to improve the photogenerated charge separation in photocatalysts.

The g-SiC has high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability along with high surface area, low band gap, and high electron mobility which made it a superior catalyst for removing different organic pollutants at high concentrations42\u201347. The 2D layered structure of siligraphene made it superior candidate to form the well-defined composite heterojunctions. Siligraphene can prevent the aggregation of composites as well as improve the separation of photogenerated electron \u2212 hole pairs due to the superior electron mobility of siligraphene. Also, the doping of Si atoms in this structure gives extraordinary properties to this compound compared to graphene, which can make this material a very good candidate for making improved catalysts with graphenic structures. So far none has reported the potential of siligraphene coupled with tungstates (AWOs) for removal of organic pollutants in water.\nIn this work, the new Z-scheme heterojunctions of Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 with siligraphene (g-SiC) were synthesized for removal of high concentration of tetracycline under visible light. Siligraphene (g-SiC) was synthesized via a low-temperature method to maintain the porous structure and g-SiC/AWO composites were developed by immobilizing of tungstates on the surface of g-SiC. Siligraphene can decrease the band gap, increase the charge transfer, and decrease the rate of photogenerated electron\u2013hole recombination."

The diffraction peaks of the g-SiC were observed at 31.61, 35.58, 37.98, 60.08, and 71.76 representing the (101), (102), (103), (110), and (202) planes in the hexagonal structure of g-SiC (JCPDS#-29-1128)42\u201347. The high amounts of immobilized tungstates (AWO) on the surface of g-SiC have led to the observation of weak diffractions from 6H-SiC in these composites.\nThe lattice fringe data were recorded in Table\u00a0S1. Figure\u00a03 shows the SEM images of synthesized catalysts. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, needle-like, nanoparticle, and\nplate-like morphologies of Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 were observed on the surface of g-SiC in g-SiC/ Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 catalysts, respectively.\nFigure\u00a04a displays the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of g-SiC, g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4, which shows the decrease of surface area after immobilization of AWO on the surface of g-SiC. These results can be justified by the filling of pores in g-SiC by AWO particles, which is shown in pore size distribution curves (Fig.\u00a04b). In g-SiC/Na2WO4, different pore distribution and higher surface area was observed, indicating the formation of new porosity of surface due to the larger size of Na2WO4 particles (Fig.\u00a04b and Fig.\u00a03c).\nFigure\u00a05a illustrates the band gaps of synthesized catalysts based on UV\u2013Vis drift reflectance spectra. As can be seen, the band gaps of g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 are calculated as 2.83, 2.80, and 2.88\u00a0eV, respectively (Fig.\u00a05). Results show the decreases of band gap of tungstate compounds after stabilization on the surface of g-SiC.

In g-SiC/AWO samples, photogenerated electrons could be transferred efficiently from tungstates to g-SiC due to the high charge carrier of the g-SiC sheets.\nFigure\u00a04.

            "text": "The photocatalytic performance of g-SiC, g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 in comparison with Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 and their graphene composites (gr/AWO) were reported in Fig.\u00a06. As can be seen, immobilization of tungstate catalysts on the surface of g-SiC enhances the photocatalytic degradation of TCL and 97, 98, and 94% removal of TCL (50\u00a0ppm) were observed for g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/ Na2WO4 after 20\u00a0min, respectively (Fig.\u00a06). While, Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 show the weak photocatalytic performances in the removal of high concentrations tetracycline (50\u00a0ppm), and 16, 25, and 18% TCL removal were observed after 100\u00a0min (Fig.\u00a06). These results show the good effect of g-SiC as catalyst support. Figure\u00a06 also shows that g-SiC as a metal-free catalyst represents better photocatalytic activity than tungstate catalysts and can remove 80% of TCL in a shorter time (30\u00a0min). This shows that g-SiC does not only play the role of catalyst support and acts as a photocatalyst to create a heterojunction with tungstates, which can improve the catalytic performances of tungstate photocatalysts (Fig.\u00a06).\nTo better understand the effect of g-SiC on the photocatalytic performance of g-SiC/AWO composites, the photocatalytic properties of immobilized Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 on the surface of graphene (gr/AWO) were also compared with g-SiC/AWO composites (Fig.\u00a06). As we know, graphene along with other semiconductors like tungstates can improve the photocatalytic properties by increasing the transfer of electron and decreasing the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination24\u201328. Therefore, better photocatalytic activities can be seen in gr/AWO composites than in tungstates alone (Fig.\u00a06).\nAs seen in Fig.\u00a06, replacing siligraphene (g-SiC) instead of graphene (gr) shows significant increases in photocatalytic properties. The g-SiC is a graphene structure in which half of its C atoms have been replaced by Si atoms. This graphene structure can increase the catalytic activity due to its high electron mobility. Besides charge transfer capability, also photogenerated charge lifetime contributes to the photocatalytic reaction. Interactions between g-SiC and Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, or Na2WO4 can reduce the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination and improve photocatalytic performance. Also, \u03c0 electrons in the siligraphene structure can form the \u03c0 backbonding with metal atoms and increase the electron\u2013hole separation and enhance the photocatalytic activity55.\nIn addition to the advantages of graphene structure in g-SiC composites, the heterojunctions created with g-SiC reduce the band gap and can enhance the photocatalytic activity by shortening the electron transfer distance through the Z-scheme mechanism which will be explained later in this discussion.\nAnother mechanism that plays a role in enhancing the catalytic properties of g-SiC composites (g-SiC/AWO) is related to the surface charges in the g-SiC structure. According to our previous report, due to the electronegativity difference between Si and C in the g-SiC (siligraphene) structure, Si atoms have a partial positive charge and C atoms have a partial negative charge7,10,42. The dissolved O2 in a solution can adsorb on positive charged Si atoms in g-SiC, the O\u2013O bonds dissociated and the oxygenated radicals were formed that can proceed the photocatalytic oxidation process7,10,42. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, 64\u201385% TCL removal were observed at the time zero for g-SiC composites (g-SiC/AWO), indicating the degradation of TCL even at dark via oxidation of TCL by\nFigure\u00a06. Comparison of photocatalytic performances of AWO, gr/AWO, g-SiC, and g-SiC/AWO composites in removal of 50\u00a0ppm TCL.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:10022 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37170-5\nformed oxygenated radicals. While, in the graphene composites (gr/AWO), only 15\u201323% TCL removal was observed at dark due to the adsorption of TCL on the surface of graphene (Fig.\u00a06).\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a04, the BET results confirm the reduction of surface area in g-SiC/AWO composites. These data show that the increases in catalytic properties are related to the structural properties of immobilized tungstates on the surface of g-SiC, and the effect of the chemical structure was dominant over the effect of the surface area.\nTo achieve the best results, the reaction conditions were optimized in Fig.\u00a07. Figure\u00a07a\u2013c represents the photocatalytic results in the removal of different concentrations of TCL. As can be seen, with the increase in TCL concentration, the removal has decreased. An increase in TCL concentration causes the saturation of the photocatalyst surface which decreases the photocatalytic activity.\nThe effect of catalyst amounts was also investigated by using g-SiC/Bi2WO6 as the best photocatalyst (Fig.\u00a07d). Results show that increasing the amounts of photocatalyst from 0.01 to 0.015\u00a0g increases the catalytic performance. Increasing the amount of catalyst to 0.02\u00a0g only increases the rate of degradation (Fig.\u00a07d).\nThe effect of pH in photocatalytic removal of TCL by g-SiC, g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/ Na2WO4 catalysts were shown in Fig.\u00a07e. As TCL has the several functional groups, different ionized species were\nFigure\u00a07.

The H2TC+ species was observed at pH < 3.3, H2TC0 zwitterionic species was formed at pH 3.3\u20137.7, and HTC\u2212/TC2\u2212 species was produced at pH > 7.756,57. As known, the surface charge of the catalyst becomes positive at a pH lower than pHzpc, which can absorb the negative molecules. The pHzpc of g-SiC, g-SiC/ Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 were measured 6.7, 5.9, 5.2, and 5.6, respectively. So, at pHzpc of catalysts (pH = 5\u20137), H2TC0 as the main species of TCL can be adsorbed on the surface of catalysts via interaction of negative tricarbonyl amide groups of TCL with a positive charge of Si atoms on the g-SiC structure10. At a pH lower than 3.3, the TCL removal decreases due to the repulsion between the H2TC+ species of TCL and the positive surface of catalysts. Also, at a pH higher than 7.7, the photocatalytic performances were decreased which is related to electrostatic repulsion between the negative surface of catalysts and HTC\u2212/TC2\u2212 species of TCL (Fig.\u00a07e).\nTo check the stability of the catalysts, their recovery was also investigated. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a07f, no change in the photocatalytic efficiency can be observed after 3 runs. In the next runs, a slight drop in the photocatalytic activity is seen, which is related to the saturation of the catalyst surfaces. The g-SiC catalyst has a lower photocatalytic ability, so a greater drop in recovery is observed. A lower drop in the activity of tungstate catalysts (g-SiC/ AWO) indicates the high activity of these photocatalysts in the continuous recovery.\nFigure\u00a08 shows the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation by g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 composites. Based on band structures, these semiconductors are excited under visible light irradiation and electrons and holes are created in the valence (VB) and conduction (CB) bonds. The CB and VB potentials of g-SiC/AWO catalysts were predicted by the following equation:\nX is the electronegativity of the semiconductor and Ee is the energy of free electrons in the hydrogen scale (approximately 4.5\u00a0eV). The X value of g-SiC/Ag2WO4, g-SiC/Bi2WO6, and g-SiC/Na2WO4 are reported 6, 6.36, and 6.5\u00a0eV, respectively48,50,58. The Eg of Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 were measured from UV\u2013Vis spectra 3.1, 2.89, and 3.7\u00a0eV, respectively (Fig.\u00a05b). As a result, ECB and EVB for Ag2WO4, Bi2WO6, and Na2WO4 have been calculated as \u2212 0.05 and 3.05\u00a0eV, 0.41 and 3.30\u00a0eV, and 0.15 and 3.85\u00a0eV, respectively. The Eg of g-SiC was obtained at 1.99\u00a0eV from UV\u2013Vis spectra (Fig.\u00a05b) and EVB was measured at 1.24\u00a0eV from XPS spectra (Fig.\u00a0S1). As a result, the ECB of g-SiC has been calculated as \u2212 0.72\u00a0eV. Based on energy levels of g-SiC and its tungstate catalysts, the CB of g-SiC (\u2212 0.72\u00a0V) is more negative than O2/\u00b7O2\u2212\u00a0(\u2212 0.33\u00a0V) and the VB of Ag2WO4 (3.05\u00a0V), Bi2WO6 (3.3\u00a0V), and Na2WO4 (3.85\u00a0V) are more positive than OH-/\u00b7OH (+ 1.99\u00a0V), so, the photogenerated e\u2212\u00a0can reduce the O2\u00a0to form \u00b7O2\u2212 radicals and photogenerated h+\u00a0can oxidize OH- to produce \u00b7OH radicals. Results confirm the electrons\u00a0in the CB of AWO combine directly with the holes\u00a0in the VB of g-SiC, indicating the direct Z-scheme mechanism in the charge transfer path of photogenerated electron\u2013hole in g-SiC/AWO heterojunctions.\nTraditional BWO-based heterojunction is commonly performed via the Type-II strategy to accelerate the rate of charge transfer. These conventional heterojunction has a drawback that charge migration causes the photogenerated electron\u2013hole to have weak redox ability59\u201361. In this novel Z-scheme heterojunction not only gives photocatalyst with superior redox ability, but also accelerates the migration of photogenerated electron-holes62.\nEVB = X \u2212 Ee + 0.5 Eg"

The smaller band gap and shorter electron transfer path which enhances the stability of carrier transfer in Bi2WO6 is the reason for the better photocatalytic activity of this catalyst.\nThe quenching tests were also done to identify the active radicals involved in photocatalytic reaction for g-SiC/ AWO catalysts (Fig.\u00a09). The quenching results of g-SiC indicate the involvement of \u00b7OH and \u00b7O2\u2212 radicals as the main species in the degradation of TCL. While, in g-SiC/AWO photocatalysts, \u00b7OH and h+ are the reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction, and \u00b7O2\u2212 radical shows the lower involvement in the degradation of TCL (Fig.\u00a09).\nIn general, it can be concluded that by using the g-SiC as catalyst support, new Z-scheme heterojunctions of tungstates (g-SiC/AWO) can be developed to find out the visible light degradation of high concentration of antibiotics by improving the charge separation, enhancing the electron transfer in Z-scheme heterojunction, and decreasing the rate of photogenerated electron\u2013hole recombination."

The graphenic structure of g-SiC can improve photocatalytic performance by increasing the electron transfer and decreasing the rate of electron\u2013hole recombination.
