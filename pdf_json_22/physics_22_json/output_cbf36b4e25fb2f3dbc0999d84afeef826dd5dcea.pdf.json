INTRODUCTION\nThe need to quantitatively understand the thermodynamic properties of degenerate fermionic matter is ubiquitous in theoretical physics. Examples of physical systems of interest range from condensed matter physics [1,2] and supersymmetric theories [3,4] to compact astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs [5] and neutron stars [6]. Though the details of these systems vary greatly and the relevant densities and temperatures are separated by orders of magnitude, they all share common features stemming from the Pauli exclusion principle. These properties typically include some type of a filled Fermi sea of hard fermionic excitations with softer bosonic modes mediating their interactions or being formed through pairing on the Fermi surface. While in some cases specific techniques, such as gauge-gravity duality or numerical lattice field theory may offer valuable insights, the only first-principles field-theory tool universally applicable at low temperatures and large chemical potentials is perturbation theory (see\ne.g., [7] for a recent review). This provides strong impetus to further develop weak-coupling techniques for the study of degenerate fermionic matter. In the case of ultrarelativistic matter, the foundations of modern perturbative computations were set in the seminal works of Freedman and McLerran in the late 1970s [8\u201310], where the authors determined the equations of state (EOS) of degenerate quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter to next-to-next-toleading order (N2LO) in a weak-coupling expansion around a free Fermi gas in powers of the coupling \u03b1. At this order, the presence of the two distinct momentum scales in the system becomes tangible: the hard fermionic modes, with momenta of the same magnitude as the chemical potential, kF \u223c \u03bc, can be treated fully perturbatively, while the longwavelength gauge fields, with momenta proportional to the Debye screening scale ffiffiffi \u03b1 p \u03bc, require a nonperturbative treatment. In [8\u201310], the soft contributions were accounted for through an explicit resummation of an infinite class of ring diagrams, containing arbitrary numbers of fermionic loops, but at even higher orders such a treatment becomes intractable. Instead, it becomes imperative to treat the physics of the soft momentum scale via an effectivefield-theory setup, which has indeed been realized in recent years through the systematic implementation of the hardthermal-loop (HTL) framework to the description of cold Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

This development has led to several advances, including the unification of perturbative results throughout the temperature-chemical potential plane for deconfined QCD matter [11,15]. For cold and dense quark matter, the first next-to-next-tonext-to-leading order (N3LO) calculations determined the fully soft contributions to the EOS [13,14], including also the leading logarithmic contribution of O\u00f0\u03b13 ln2 \u03b1\u00de [12], absent in an Abelian theory. The contributions to the leading and next-to-leading logarithms arising from the fully soft sector have also recently been resummed [16]. However, in order to determine all logarithmically enhanced terms at this order, i.e., to reach the O\u00f0\u03b13 ln \u03b1\u00de accuracy, so-called mixed contributions originating from interactions between the hard and soft modes must also be accounted for. In this article, we determine precisely these\nmixed N3LO terms for the Abelian theory QED, providing the first improvement to the EOS of this theory since the late 1970s [10,17] (see, however, the related hightemperature calculations [18,19]). This computation serves as a proof of principle of the effective-theory framework and for the first time demonstrates the nontrivial cancellation of divergences arising from the soft and hard sectors at N3LO, thus paving the way to the conceptually similar but diagrammatically more laborious non-Abelian version of this calculation. Based on earlier computations within both QED and QCD [10,14,20], we know that up to N3LO, the pressure p of cold and dense QED matter takes the parametric form [with the leading-order (LO) pressure pLO \u00bc \u03bc4Nf=\u00f012\u03c02\u00de, \u03bc being the fermion chemical potential, taken here to be equal for each of the Nf flavors]\np pLO \u00bc 1\u2212 3 2 \u03b1e \u03c0 \u2212Nf \u03b1e \u03c0 2 3 2 ln Nf \u03b1e \u03c0 \u2212 ln \u039b\u0304 2\u03bc \u2212 22 3 \u2212 51 8Nf \u00fe 13 2 ln 2\u00fe \u03c0 2 2 \u2212 4ln22\u00fe 3 4 \u03b4\n\u00feN2f \u03b1e \u03c0 3 a3;1ln2 Nf \u03b1e \u03c0 \u00fe a3;2 ln Nf \u03b1e \u03c0 \u00fe a3;3 ln Nf \u03b1e \u03c0 ln \u039b\u0304 2\u03bc \u00fe a3;4ln2 \u039b\u0304 2\u03bc \u00fe a3;5 ln \u039b\u0304 2\u03bc \u00fe a3;6 \u00feO\u00f0\u03b14e\u00de:\n\u00f01\u00de\nHere, \u03b1e\u00f0\u039b\u0304\u00de \u00bc e\u00f0\u039b\u0304\u00de2=4\u03c0 is the renormalized fine-structure constant at the renormalization scale \u039b\u0304, with e the electric charge of each fermion, also taken to be equal for each of the Nf flavors; while \u03b4 \u2248 \u22120.8563832 is available via a one-dimensional integral expression that can be evaluated to practically arbitrary precision [20]. The coefficients a3;n are in principle unknown, although a3;3\u2013a3;5 are available from the lower-order coefficients using the renormalization-scale independence of the pressure (see the Supplemental Material [21]). The terms we determine in this work include (i) the full contribution of the purely soft (scale e\u03bc)\nsector which turns out to identically vanish, implying a3;1 \u00bc 0, (ii) the full mixed contributions which determine the a3;2 coefficient, and\n(iii) part of the fully hard contribution, including all of its infrared (IR) divergences and the leading large-Nf part of a3;6. As a result, we are able to explicitly demonstrate the cancellation of all ultraviolet (UV) and IR divergences between the soft and hard sectors at N3LO, which happens exactly as predicted in [14]. Only one finite coefficient, independent of logarithms and corresponding to the purely hard subleading-in-Nf contributions to a3;6, is left missing from the full O\u00f0\u03b13e\u00de pressure. Our calculation extensively utilizes results from a companion paper [24], where we determine corrections to the one-loop HTL photon\nself-energy from power corrections in soft momenta and two-loop diagrams, generalizing the results of [25\u201327] to nonzero \u03bc. Importantly, both calculations pave the way towards completing the same tasks in cold and dense QCD."

            "text": "Following the organizational scheme presented in [14] and translating it to the somewhat simplified case of U(1) gauge symmetry, the N3LO pressure of cold and dense QED contains contributions from three different kinematic regions. These are dubbed purely soft (s), purely hard (h), and mixed (m), of which the last one couples the soft and hard modes together. As explained in detail in [13], the split between these different kinematic regions is not unique, and this ambiguity renders the individual contributions dependent on an additional factorization scale \u039bh, which must cancel when summing over all contributions at a fixed order (see the beginning of next section for the introduction of \u039bh in dimensional regularization). We may thus write the N3LO pressure correction, denoted here by p3, in the form\np3 \u00bc ps3 \u00fe pm3 \u00fe ph3; \u00f02\u00de\nwith the three terms on the right-hand side corresponding to the different momentum scales. The first, purely soft contribution arises from interactions among soft, screened photons, which can be described within the HTL effective theory [28].

There are multiple types of divergences present in these diagrams: full-theory (unresummed) UV divergences, full-theory IR divergences and HTL (resummed) UV divergences. Each pi3;k contains fulltheory UV divergences, while full-theory IR divergences are contained within ph3;1 \u00fe ph3;2 and the HTL UV divergences are contained within pm3;0 \u00fe pm3;1. Note also that the final diagram of Eq.

The mixed sector is also confirmed to be gauge invariant on its own, akin to the observations made about the QCD soft sector in [14]. The remaining ph0 term in Eq.

(1), we are now in a position to inspect the result for the pressure numerically and test its sensitivity with respect to the choice of the renormalization scale \u039b\u0304 and the value of the unknown coefficient c0. In Fig. 1, we do exactly this by plotting the pressure evaluated at \u039b\u0304 \u00bc X\u03bc as a function of \u03b1e\u00f0\u039b\u0304 \u00bc 2\u03bc\u00de and varying X by a factor of 2 around X \u00bc 2 in accordance with typical conventions in the field [14,30].

At the same time, the result is clearly rather sensitive to the unknown hard O\u00f0\u03b13e\u00de contribution, which motivates vigorous future work towards completing the full N3LO pressure calculation. Next, we inspect the use of a resummation scheme motivated by the work of Moore, Ipp, and Rebhan [33\u201335], who determined the pressure of both QED and QCD in the limit of a large number of fermion flavors Nf, keeping the parameter \u03b1eNf finite. In the present context, where Nf is not large, this result can be used to resum all ring diagrams built using the full one-loop photon self-energy to infinite loop order. Just as with other resummation schemes, such as the widely-used hard thermal loop perturbation theory [36], this resummation amounts to including some higher-order terms in the weak-coupling expansion of the pressure, which is hoped to improve its convergence properties. In Fig. 2, we demonstrate the effect of the large-Nf resummation for Nf \u00bc 3, displaying both the N2LO and N3LO pressures. As the figure clearly demonstrates, the resummation provides a marked improvement in the convergence of the result by taming some of the renormalization-scale dependence of the quantity, which motivates its eventual use also in the context of dense QCD.We also note in passing (see the Supplemental Material [21]) that our new calculation provides the coefficients 3.18(5) and 3.4(3) in Eq.

Finally, let us briefly study the behavior of the speed of sound cs in cold and dense QED matter. This quantity is particularly interesting in QCD, as there is strong tension between the common expectation that it rises close to the\nspeed of light in dense nuclear matter and the fact that at high temperatures, it is known to approach the asymptotic conformal value of c2s \u00bc 1=3 from below. In QED, the conformal limit is known to be broken as the sign of the beta function indicates that the leading correction to the noninteracting massless limit comes with a positive sign. This is indeed verified by our result, shown in Fig. 3. We, however, observe that the higher-order corrections prevent the speed of sound from significantly exceeding the conformal value. Lastly, we note the extremely good convergence of this quantity even at very large couplings. In summary, we have found that at least in the case of cold and dense QED matter, including contributions beyond N2LO has a notable effect on the convergence\nDEGENERATE FERMIONIC MATTER AT N3LO: QUANTUM \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 107, L031501 (2023)\nL031501-5\nproperties of the pressure. This provides compelling reasons to pursue the evaluation of further N3LO terms of the pressure of cold and dense matter. With the coefficients c0;1 and c0;2 fixed, our results demonstrate that the renormalization-scale uncertainty of the pressure will drop to a small fraction of the previous N2LO result at all coupling values of relevance for even QCD. This implies that there is good reason to believe that performing similar improvements within QCD will allow the perturbative EOS of dense quark matter to become applicable at substantially lower densities than what has been possible so far. This would have dramatic effects for the model-independent determination of the neutron-star-matter EOS as highlighted by past interpolation works [37\u201339] and the more recent results that enable rigorously translating perturbative constraints to lower densities using standard thermodynamic relations [40,41]. We underline that the weak-coupling computations presented in this work, once generalized to QCD, would not be sensitive to any color-superconducting phases, since only gluons with nonperturbatively small energies \u223c exp\u00f0\u2212#= ffiffiffi\u03b1p \u00de receive corrections to their screening from quark Cooper pairing [42,43]. Finally, let us briefly comment on the generalizations necessary to complete the present calculation in QCD. While it is true that there exists an additional soft NLO correction to the gluon self-energy in QCD, the corresponding contribution to the zero-temperature pressure has already been determined in [13,14]. Hence, again at zero temperature, the only contribution missing in the mixed\nsector is the two-loop HTL gluon self-energy. Thanks to the new technical advances made in the QED case here and in the companion paper [24], this QCD contribution is straightforward (if tedious) to compute. In order to complete the computation of hard sector, the only remaining terms needed are the currently unknown coefficients c0;1 and c0;2, extended to QCD. On a technical level, the computation of these coefficients (both in QED and QCD) involves complicated UV-sensitive 4-loop diagrams, which require novel methods in finite-density multiloop computations, e.g., see Refs. [44,45]."
