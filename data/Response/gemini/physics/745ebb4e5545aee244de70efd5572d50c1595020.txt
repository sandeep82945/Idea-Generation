1. **Exploring the antibacterial activity of modified hen egg white against a wider range of bacteria.**

The study demonstrated the antibacterial activity of modified hen egg white against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly Listeria innocua. Future research could investigate the effectiveness of modified hen egg white against a more diverse range of bacteria, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, to determine its broad-spectrum antibacterial potential.


2. **Evaluating the stability and storage conditions of modified hen egg white.**

The stability and storage conditions of modified hen egg white should be investigated to ensure its long-term viability and effectiveness. This could involve studying the impact of temperature, pH, and other factors on the stability of the modified hen egg white and determining optimal storage conditions to maintain its antibacterial activity.


3. **Exploring the potential synergistic effects of modified hen egg white with other antimicrobial agents.**

The study could be extended to investigate the potential synergistic effects of modified hen egg white with other antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics or natural antimicrobial compounds. This could involve testing combinations of modified hen egg white and other antimicrobial agents against bacteria to determine if they exhibit enhanced antibacterial activity.


4. **Assessing the safety and toxicity of modified hen egg white for food applications.**

Before modified hen egg white can be used in food applications, its safety and toxicity must be thoroughly assessed. This could involve conducting in vivo and in vitrto studies to evaluate the potential toxicity of modified hen egg white and to determine any potential allergenic or adverse effects.


5. **Exploring the potential applications of modified hen egg white in food products.**

The study could be extended to investigate the potential applications of modified hen egg white in food products, such as meat, poultry, and fish. This could involve testing the effectiveness of modified hen egg white in extending the shelf life of food products and reducing the growth of pathogenic bacteria during storage.
