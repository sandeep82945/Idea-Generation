Investigating the Impact of Prebunking Strategies on Media Literacy and Resilience: Given the emphasis on prebunking—or preemptive debunking—of misinformation, a study could explore the effectiveness of different prebunking strategies in enhancing media literacy and resilience against manipulation. This research could assess how early interventions impact individuals’ ability to critically evaluate media content and resist manipulative tactics.

Cross-Cultural Studies on Media Manipulation Resilience: Since the study focuses on Slovakia, conducting comparative cross-cultural research could provide insights into how cultural, societal, and educational differences impact media manipulation resilience. This research could help in understanding universal versus culture-specific factors that contribute to or hinder resilience against media manipulation.

Longitudinal Study on the Evolution of Media Manipulation Tactics and Resilience: With the rapidly evolving digital media landscape, a longitudinal study could track changes in media manipulation tactics over time and examine how individuals’ resilience adapts in response. This research could identify emerging threats and evaluate the sustainability of current educational initiatives in fostering long-term resilience.

Efficacy of Dialogic-Based Education in Media Literacy: The paper suggests the potential of dialogic-based education in media literacy. Future research could design and test dialogic-based educational programs to evaluate their effectiveness in improving critical thinking, information verification skills, and overall media literacy compared to traditional education methods.

Role of Emotional Intelligence in Media Manipulation Resilience: Given the mention of emphasizing emotions as a risk factor, research could explore the role of emotional intelligence in determining resilience to media manipulation. This study could investigate how emotional awareness, regulation, and empathy contribute to individuals’ susceptibility or resistance to manipulative content.
