Adaptive Beamforming Techniques for Mixed-Field Scenarios: Investigate adaptive beamforming strategies that dynamically adjust according to the user's position relative to the base station (BS), whether in near-field or far-field regions. This research could explore algorithms that minimize inter-user interference while optimizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for both near-field and far-field users.

Spatial Diversity and MIMO Enhancements in XL-Array Systems: Focus on leveraging spatial diversity and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies to improve communication reliability and efficiency in mixed near-and far-field scenarios. This could involve studying the impact of different antenna configurations and MIMO techniques on interference patterns and achievable rates for near-field and far-field users.

Scalability and Efficiency of XL-Array Deployments: Analyze the scalability of XL-array systems in various deployment scenarios, including urban, suburban, and rural environments. Research could include optimizing antenna placement and array design to enhance coverage and capacity while considering practical challenges such as physical space constraints and energy consumption.

Integration of Fresnel Functions in Channel Modeling: Extend the application of Fresnel functions for more accurate channel modeling in mixed-field communication scenarios. This could involve developing new mathematical models that account for complex environments and obstacles, providing more precise predictions of signal behavior and interference patterns.

Advanced Interference Management Techniques: Develop advanced interference management techniques that go beyond beamforming, such as cooperative communication strategies, network coding, or the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict and mitigate interference in real-time. This research could also explore the potential for new physical layer technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, to dynamically alter the propagation environment for improved communication performance in mixed-field scenarios.
