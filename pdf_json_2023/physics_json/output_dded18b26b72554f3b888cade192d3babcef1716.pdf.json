    "abstractText": "There is a recognized need for the development of cost-effective, stable, fast, and optimized novel materials for technological applications. Substantial research has been undertaken on the role of polymeric nanocomposites in sensing applications. However, the use of PANI-based nanocomposites in impedimetric and capacitive electrochemical sensors has yet to be understood. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between the sensitivity and linearity of electrochemical pH sensors and the composition of nanocomposites. Thin films of PANI/CeO2 and PANI/WO3 were deposited via spin coating for characterization and application during the electrochemical impedance and capacitance spectroscopy (EIS and ECS) transduction stages. The findings showed that the optimized performance of the devices was extended not only to the sensitivity but also to the linearity. An increase of 213% in the ECS sensitivity of the PANI/CeO2 compared to the metal oxide and an increase of 64% in the ECS linearity of the PANI/WO3 compared to the polymeric sensitivity were reported. This study identified the structure\u2013property relationship of nanocomposite thin films of PANI with metal oxides for use in electrochemical sensors. The developed materials could be applied in devices to be used in different fields, such as food, environment, and biomedical monitoring.",

            "text": "Conducting polymers (CP) represent a class of polymers that have gained attention due to the work of Shirakawa, MacDiarmid, and Heeger [1]. CP have a conjugated structure due to sp2 hybridized carbons in their backbone, which leads to the delocalization of \u03c0-electrons, ensuring their unique properties, with particular attention being paid to the electrical one [2]. The doping of the conjugated structure can improve the electrical conductivity and is responsible for the wide range of applications of CP [3]. There are several CP, such as polyacetylene (PA), polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPY), poly(p-phenylene) (PPP), poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV), polythiophenes (PTH), and their derivatives. Among them, PANI is one of the most studied and applied CP due to its low cost, ease of synthesis, processability, deposition as a thin film, environmental stability, and possibility of forming hybrid structures [4\u20136]. The ability to tailor the mechanical, optical, and electrical properties of PANI renders the polymer a viable material for many applications, such as conductive adhesives, diodes, organic transistors, solar cells, capacitors, energy storage devices, ion-selective electrodes, chemical sensors, gas sensors, and biosensors [7\u201315]. PANI plays a central role in the development of sensors. Its ability to change its properties upon exposure to acids and bases, as well as some vapors and liquids, makes it a candidate for such applications [16]. PANI-based sensors and biosensors involve potentiometric, amperometric, conductometric,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15030578 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578 2 of 15\nimpedimetric, capacitive, and optical transducer stages [17\u201320]. The use of PANI-based thin films for pH sensors has been shown for different transduction systems, sample preparations, and applications. Mello and co-workers [21] and Chinnathambi and coworkers [22] showed optical pH sensors with electrodeposited PANI samples. Mello and co-workers [23] and Vieira and co-workers [24] showed potentiometric PANI-based pH sensors with FET platforms. Despite the polymer\u2019s many qualities, PANI-based chemical sensors may suffer from sensitivity, linearity, selectivity, or stability limitations. Such limitations might be overcome by introducing a secondary material into the PANI, thereby forming a polymeric composite [25]. Regarding the use of PANI-based composites, Nguyen and co-workers described a conductometric platform fabricated via microlithography using a PANI and poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) blend layer as a pH sensor for water quality monitoring [26]. Polymeric composite synthesis, fabrication, characterization, and application are significant areas of interest within the materials science field due to the potential to eliminate the limitations of polymers in different application fields [27\u201330]. Combining PANI with a secondary nanocomponent, such as metallic nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon compounds, or polymers, enhances its functionalities and performance, offering an efficient design [31]. To date, several studies have demonstrated that synergic interactions expand the scope and application of PANI-based nanocomposites by improving their known properties and promoting their novel features [32]. Nanocomposites of PANI with metal oxides have enhanced properties due to the synergistic interactions between the constituents that are useful for applications, such as sensors and biosensors, photovoltaics, and batteries [25,33]. Moreover, several studies have used nanocomposites of PANI with metal oxides for sensing applications [34]. One reason for the enhanced sensor response of PANI with metal oxide nanocomposites is the development of electron-conducting pathways in the material, which improve the device\u2019s efficiency [27]. To date, different authors have investigated the application of nanocomposites in sensors, such as PANI/TiO2 (titanium dioxide) [35], PANI/WO3 (tungsten trioxide) [36], and PANI/CeO2 (cerium dioxide) [37]. While the first two were prepared by physically mixing the constituents, PANI, and metal oxide nanoparticles in solutions for deposition, the last one was prepared via the in situ self-assembly of the composite prior to deposition. As sensors, the nanocomposites presented optimized performance compared to their constituents. Previous studies have shown that electrochemical sensors and biosensors based on PANI nanocomposites are promising devices. Still, drawbacks must be overcome, such as the need for cost-effective, fast, and reliable analysis methods to achieve a dedicated sensing device using PANI-based composites [38]. Such is the case for pH sensors, which have importance in the quantification of chemicals and bio-chemical analytes in environmental and biomedical monitoring. Recently, we demonstrated that pristine PANI can be used as a promising platform for chemical sensors based on the use of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and EIS-based electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy (ECS) transducer stages [39]. The use of the capacitive properties of PANI in chemical sensors has been novel to date. Our previous work showed that the oxidation state of the PANI thin film directly influences its response in each setup. Therefore, this work reveals how to achieve a low-cost and effective electrochemical pH sensor using PANI-based metal oxide nanocomposites, particularly PANI/CeO2 and PANI/WO3, in the form of thin films to further explore and improve the previous approach. The thin film production was accomplished using the well-known spin-coating technique, which is an inexpensive, straightforward, and fast method for producing thin films. The analysis methods were based on EIS and ECS. Such methods use a proper electric equivalent circuit model (EECM) to interpret the impedance and capacitance changes in the electrode/electrolyte interface [40\u201343]. The equivalent circuit used in this work is widely applied to study polymer-coated metal systems [44,45] due to allowing the decoupling of the electron transfer from the mass-transport process [46]. The performance of the sensor with nanocomposites is compared to that of its constituents\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578 3 of 15\nregarding the sensitivity and linearity of the devices. We show that the synergic interactions between the constituents influence the structure\u2013property relationship of the composites, with a significant effect on the sensor\u2019s figures of merit."

Two different operation modes were used for the collection of the images: secondary electrons (SE) for images with higher spatial resolution and backscattered electrons (BSE) for images with spatially resolved atomic number contrast (Z-contrast). The pristine PANI films exhibited smooth continuous morphology (Figure 1a,b). The PANI/CeO2 exhibited a secondary phase composed of several clusters of nanostructures spread across the surface (Figure 1c), which also showed a high atomic number contrast in the BSE images (Figure 1d) due to the high atomic number of Ce (Z = 52). Likewise, the PANI/WO3 films presented a secondary phase composed of dispersed plate-like particles with sizes ranging from a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers (Figure 1d), with a high atomic number contrast in the BSE images (Figure 1e) due to the presence of W (Z = 74). For both films, the EDS analysis confirmed the presence of the respective elements in the secondary phases (Figure S1). Together, these results indicate that the composite phases were successfully prepared via the co-dispersion spin-coating methodology, with the incorporation of the respective oxide materials into the surface of the polymer film.

A consequence of this is a decrease in the impedance of the system. This impedance variation can be monitored using the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47 variations. The ECS measurements of the PANI/WO3 nanocomposite thin film are shown in Figure 5. The analysis procedure was previously described [39] and is accurate for obtaining electrochemical information using EIS and EIS-derived capacitive methods for polymericbased materials. The analysis of the ECS data involves determining the frequency of the maximum phase angle from the phase angle-frequency graph (Figure 5a) for the more acidic pH buffer (2.33). Af er determining the frequency, the real c pacitance (C\u2032) at the specific frequency is obtained from the real capacitance frequency graph (Figure 5b). For the PANI/WO3 composite, the maximum phase angle is obtained at 1.99 Hz, as depicted\nby the dashed line in Figure 5b.\nFigure 5. Electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy measurement analysis. The EIS phase angle vs.\nfrequency in (a) and the capacitance data for PANI/WO3 nanocomposite for ach pH buffer\nsolution in (b). From the frequency of the maximum phase, 1.99 Hz, the relative response of the capacitance is obtained for each pH buffer solution. Calibration curves using the relative response of the electrochemical capacitance, C\u00b5, and the charge-transfer resistance, RCT , are plotted as a function of the pH in (c).\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578 10 of 15\nThe relative responses of the electrochemical capacitance, C\u00b5, and the charge-transfer resistance, RCT , are plotted as a function of the pH in Figure 5c. The C\u00b5 is represented by the blue circle and the RCT by the red square. The EIS and ECS relative response variations are caused by the surface charge density and electric field distribution around the film/solution interface changing with the buffer solution [58]. The relative capacitance decreases linearly with an increasing pH in the range from 2 to 8. This can be attributed to the changes in its electronic density, mainly its redox state, that contribute to the C\u00b5, which are caused by the chemical reaction (reduction/oxidation and protonation/deprotonation) of the composite film. The structural [59] and electrostatic changes [60] are not the only ones responsible for the capacitance changes in the samples. A sensitivity of 12.8 \u00b1 2.2%/pH and a linearity of 89% are obtained. The relative variation of the RCT increases with the increasing pH in the range from 2 to 8, and as for the capacitance, is attributed to the chemical reactions of the composite film. An EIS-based sensitivity of 16.3 \u00b1 2.9%/pH and linearity of 92.8% are obtained. The sensitivity and linearity of the EIS and ECS electrochemical sensors for each group of materials are presented in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the sensitivity and linearity of the impedimetric platform for each film in the CeO2 group. Figure 6b shows the capacitive results for the same set of films. The EIS sensitivity and linearity are 21.5 \u00b1 2.4%/pH and 71.7%, respectively, for the PANI. For the CeO2, they are 16.6 \u00b1 2.9%/pH and 91.2%, respectively. The sensor with CeO2 presents a lower sensitivity than the sensor with PANI. By contrast, the linearity is higher for the sensor with CeO2 than for that with PANI. The PANI/CeO2-based sensor presents a sensitivity of 19.9 \u00b1 2.9%/pH and a linearity of c.a. 94%. Comparing the impedimetric (EIS) pH sensor with the spin-coated PANI thin film with the electrodeposited one from our previous work [39], the device from this work presents a higher sensitivity (21.5 \u00b1 2.4%/pH vs. 12.7 \u00b1 2.2%/pH). Regarding the linearity, it is lower for the spin-coated sample (71.7% vs. 91.7%). This is also observed for the capacitive (ECS) sensor. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578 11 of 15\nThe nanocomposite presents a synergic performance. The described results indicate that the nanocomposite\u2019s sensitivity is in the level of the PANI\u2019s sensitivity, and the linearity is in the level of the CeO2 oxide. The nanocomposite improves the polymer linearity and metal oxide sensitivity. The same behavior as for the EIS sensitivity is observed for the ECS sensor. The sensitivity is 16.5 \u00b1 2.6%/pH for the PANI, 3.22 \u00b1 0.6%/pH for the CeO2, and 10.1 \u00b1 2.9%/pH for the PANI/CeO2. Although the ECS sensitivity of the nanocomposite is not at the level of the PANI sensitivity, it represents a 213% increase compared to the metal oxide sensitivity. At the same time, the impedimetric sensitivity increases by about 20%. Regarding the ECS linearity, the PANI has 54.3%, the CeO2 has 88.7%, and the PANI/CeO2 composite has 79.3%. As for the capacitive sensitivity, the linearity does not reach the level of the metal oxide, although it has a 46% increase when compared to the polymer linearity, while for the impedimetric linearity, the increase for the nanocomposite is about 31%. One unexpected finding is the extent to which the PANI/CeO2 nanocomposite optimizes the performance of the pH sensor for both impedimetric and capacitive platforms. This improves not only the linearity of the PANI-based sensor but also the sensitivity of the CeO2-based sensor. Figure 6c,d present the sensitivity and linearity of the impedimetric and capacitive platforms, respectively, for each film in the WO3 group. The EIS sensitivity and linearity for the PANI are the same as for the previous group. For the WO3, they are 11.9 \u00b1 2.9%/pH and 88.6%, respectively. Again, the metal oxide-based sensor presents a lower sensitivity and higher linearity than the polymeric sensor. The PANI/WO3 nanocomposite presents impedimetric sensitivity and linearity of 16.3 \u00b1 2.2%/pH and 92.8%, respectively, improving on the polymer\u2019s linearity and the metal oxide\u2019s sensitivity. Although the nanocomposite\u2019s sensitivity is not at the PANI\u2019s sensitivity level, it represents an increase of 37% in relation to the WO3\u2019s sensitivity. Regarding the linearity, the composite is higher than the metal oxide, with a rise of 5%, representing an increase of 31% concerning the PANI\u2019s linearity. The ECS platform with the PANI/WO3 nanocomposite presents the same behavior as the platform with the PANI/CeO2. The nanocomposite presents a sensitivity improvement in relation to the metal oxide of 71%, from 7.5\u00b1 0.1%/pH to 12.8\u00b1 2.2%/pH, and a linearity improvement concerning the PANI of 64%, from 54.3% to 89%. Compared to previous work, it is possible to control the response of each sensor though the protonation potential and electronic density of the PANI sample by combining it with a metal oxide instead of controlling the oxidation state of the polymer. The thin film morphology has a significant influence on the response of electrochemical interfacial sensors. The thickness and surface roughness, RQ (root mean square deviation), of the thin films are presented in Table 1. For each group of films, the CeO2 and WO3 films are the thickest (11.6 \u00b1 1.8 and 21.1 \u00b1 1.9 nm, respectively) and the composites, PANI/CeO2 and PANI/WO3, are thinner than the oxide. The PANI/CeO2 are thinner than the PANI film (4.2 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 5.0 \u00b1 1.0 nm), although the PANI/WO3 is thicker (11.7 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 5.0 \u00b1 1.0 nm). The interaction between the polymeric chain and the metal oxide generates a composite sample with unique structural properties.\nBoth the thickness and surface roughness are important for the interfacial processes at the film/electrolyte interface. While thicker films present a reduced electron transfer rate [61], electrodes with a higher surface area, directly related to the surface roughness,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 578 12 of 15\ndeliver an enlarged electron transfer rate [62]. As shown in Table 1, both parameters are related, with the thicker film presenting higher surface roughness and vice versa. Based on this, the roughness-to-surface ratio can be a helpful parameter for evaluating the quality of a sample when applied in electrochemical sensors. Figure 7 displays the roughness/thickness parameter for both sets of films. Based on the effects of the roughness and thickness on the interfacial phenomenon, lower ratios indicate reduced sensor sensitivity and performance, and vice-versa.

The consequences are noted in its new and synergic properties. The interaction between the metal oxide and the polymer is responsible for altering the structural properties of the thin films, such as the thickness and roughness, as well as the response of the electrochemical sensors based on the material. Ultimately, the sensors\u2019 sensitivity is defined by the nanocomposite\u2019s thickness and roughness. As shown in Figure 7, the relationship between the roughness/thickness ratio and the material is the same as that shown for the sensitivity (Figure 6). The synthesis of new composites may be key to the development of materials with tailored properties presenting the optimal performance in sensor devices. For example, the described polymeric composites with CeO2 and WO3 metal oxides could offer improved and optimized sensitivity and linearity compared to the constituent materials."
