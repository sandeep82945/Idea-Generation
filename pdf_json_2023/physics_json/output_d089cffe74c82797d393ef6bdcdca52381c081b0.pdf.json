    "abstractText": "Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), which is recalcitrant in municipal wastewater treatment, accounts for 26\u201381% of dissolved total phosphorus in the effluent. More importantly, the majority of DOP could be bioavailable, potentially threatening the aquatic environment through eutrophication. This study aimed to develop a ferrate (VI)-based advanced treatment to effectively destruct and remove DOP from secondary effluent and use deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and adenosine-5\u2019-triphosphate (ATP) as DOP model compounds to explore the relevant mechanisms. The results showed that ferrate (VI) treatment could efficiently destruct and remove 75% of the DOP in secondary effluent from an activated sludge-adopted municipal wastewater treatment plant, under normal operating conditions. Moreover, the coexistence of nitrate, ammonia, and alkalinity barely affected the effectiveness, while the presence of phosphate significantly inhibited DOP removal. The mechanistic study revealed that ferrate (VI)-induced particle adsorption was the dominant way to achieve DOP reduction, rather than oxidating DOP to phosphate and forming precipitation afterward. Meanwhile, DOP molecules could be effectively decomposed into smaller ones by ferrate (VI) oxidation. This study clearly demonstrated that ferrate (VI) treatment could achieve a promising DOP removal from secondary effluent for mitigating the risk of eutrophication in receiving water bodies.",

However, increasing attention has been paid to the underestimated influence of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) on surface water eutrophication, water quality, and algal blooms [2,3]. DOP is the dominant form in most freshwater systems and occupies 25\u201350% of the total phosphorus [4]. In recent years, studies have demonstrated that DOP could be highly bioavailable, for instance, phytoplankton could directly uptake low-molecular-weight DOP for reproduction [5\u20137]. Indeed, DOP and inorganic phosphorus contribute concurrently to the phosphorus source in aqueous ecosystems, and studies have shown that DOP could become a phosphorus source alternative when inorganic phosphorus is absent [8,9]. Therefore, the impacts of DOP on eutrophication in aqueous environments have been ignored, and its influence on water quality impairments and ecosystem health has been underestimated. As the major discharge source of DOP to surface water, wastewater treatment plants lack effective and efficient processes to address this problem. DOP accounts for approximately 15% of the total phosphorus in municipal wastewater [10]. The conventional wastewater treatment processes mainly target the inorganic phosphorus portion and a very limited amount of DOP gets removed [11]. Although the enhanced biological treatment processes could use the active synthetic metabolism to degrade and utilize DOP\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2849. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20042849 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2849 2 of 14\nfor removal [12], microbial metabolism or cell lysis would produce DOP as well [13], leading to the unexpected DOP removal performance. Hence, in the effluent of conventional wastewater treatment plants, DOP remains and dominates 26\u201381% of the dissolved total phosphorus [14], substantially threatening the health of receiving water bodies. Advanced/tertiary treatments are usually adopted under such circumstances. However, a relevant investigation found that the DOP removal performances using advanced/tertiary treatments were varied, which were significantly correlated with the adopted process, the operation parameters, and the DOP characteristics [15]. The most recent study reported that tertiary treatment units consisting of coagulation, sand filter, and ultraviolet disinfection could significantly remove DOP and achieve a concentration of 0.01 mg/L in the final effluent, but the related chemical, labor, and maintenance costs should be of concern [14]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an innovative and cost-effective advanced phosphorus removal technique to effectively remove organic phosphorus from the effluent. Ferrate (VI) is an emerging oxidant with a higher redox potential (2.20 V) than that of ozone (2.08 V) under acidic conditions [16], which has been recognized as an environmentalfriendly water treatment agent due to the formation of non-toxic final products (i.e., Fe (III)) and little undesirable disinfection byproducts (DBPs) after ferrate (VI) treatment [17\u201319]. More importantly, it is acknowledged that oxidation/disinfection, coagulation/flocculation, adsorption, and precipitation may happen simultaneously within the ferrate (VI) treatment process [18]. Benefiting from the high valence state of iron, numerous studies have demonstrated that ferrate (VI) was able to oxide various organic compounds and deactivate pathogens and viruses, such as color and odor compounds [19], natural organic matters [20], regulated toxic organic and inorganic species [21\u201323], emerging pollutants [24,25], as well as pathogenic bacteria and viruses [26,27]. Specifically, ferrate (VI) could effectively oxidate parathion, an organophosphate pesticide, into smaller phosphorus-containing molecules and phosphate in aqueous solutions, demonstrating the DOP oxidation potential [28]. In addition, ferrate (VI) reduction could induce stable Fe (III) and inherently cause coagulation and flocculation, facilitating contaminants precipitation and adsorption afterward [29\u201331]. Compared with commonly used coagulants, ferrate (VI)-initiated coagulation could induce faster destabilization of the colloidal particles and further lower turbidity and reduce sludge volume [32]. It was found that ferrate (VI) resultant particles were amorphous iron (III) oxide/oxyhydroxide nanoparticles with a high surface area, which would own great adsorption capability of the tertian type of organic phosphorus [33,34]. In addition, ferrate (VI) treatment demonstrated a promising removal efficiency (up to 97.3%) of inorganic phosphorus during wastewater treatment [35\u201337]. Accordingly, ferrate (VI) treatment has the potential to achieve efficient total phosphorus removal from wastewater by simultaneous oxidation and coagulation. Herein, this study aimed to investigate organic phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater effluent in detail using ferrate (VI) treatment as an advanced process, explore the impacts of the water matrix on the removal efficiency, and propose the probable mechanisms behind the performance."

Following ferrate (VI) treatment, the P originally present in these DOP model compounds would have three possible fates, including (1) parent compounds in water or on the ferrate (VI) resultant particles; (2) daughter DOP compounds in water or on the ferrate (VI) resultant particles; and (3) inorganic phosphorus in water or associated with the ferrate (VI) resultant particles. Further analyses of the fate of P after ferrate (VI) treatment is of importance to understand the reaction mechanisms for DOP in secondary effluent. The detailed discussion is further analyzed on ferrate (VI) removal of the selected DOP model compounds. The results from the ex-situ ferrate (VI) treatment showed a poor removal of these DOP model compounds through adsorption only with the ferrate (VI) resultant particles. Therefore, it is unlikely that these parent compounds could be mostly captured by the produced iron (hydr)oxides. Meanwhile, we did not find these parent compounds in water after ferrate (VI) treatment. Therefore, the selected DOP compounds were almost all degraded by ferrate (VI) oxidation. On the other hand, inorganic P (e.g., orthophosphate and polyphosphate) was undetectable in the aqueous phase after ferrate (VI) treatment. It is most unlikely that polyphosphate, if truly produced from the DOP degradation, could adsorb to iron (hydr)oxide because polyphosphate is poorly removed by adsorption with iron (hydr)oxide [32]. The extraction method was used to examine whether any orthophosphate was adsorbed to the ferrate (VI) resultant particles. The results showed the absence of orthophosphate in the iron sludge. The aforementioned findings suggested that ferrate (VI) could not sufficiently degrade these DOP model compounds into inorganic phosphorus. It is well known that ferrate (VI) preferentially transforms dissolved organic matter, rather than completely oxidizing it into inorganic species [20,43]. This was evidenced by the fact that ferrate(VI) oxidation could readily alleviate chemical oxidation demand (COD) but poorly abate DOC when it was used for the degradation of NOM in natural water sources [20]. This finding was primarily ascribed to the nature of ferrate (VI). Although it has a high redox potential of up to 2.20 V, ferrate (VI) oxidation is highly selective. The oxidative anion tends to react with electron-rich moieties, but very slowly reacts with electron-poor moieties. Meanwhile, ferrate (VI) is subject to its self-decomposition in water, which can make ferrate (VI) gradually decay until ferrate (VI) depletion. Based on the mass balance analysis, only daughter P-containing compounds existed in the treatment systems. The degradation of the parent compounds could be validated with the identification of decomposition products in solutions after the treatment using the mass spectrometry technique. The results in the ferrate (VI) treatment of the selected DOP model compounds clearly indicated that most of the P was associated with the finally produced iron (hydr)oxides. Therefore, the P was plausibly present in the\nFig re 7. Proposed degradation pathway of ATP by fer ate (VI) oxidation. (P = 50 \u00b5g/L; Fe (VI) = 5.0 g/L; and p = 6.5).\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

It is most unlikely that polyphosphate, if truly produced from the DOP degradation, could adsorb to iron (hydr)oxide because polyphosphate is poorly removed by adsorption with iron (hydr)oxide [32]. The extraction method was used to examine whether any orthophosphate was adsorbed to the ferrate (VI) resultant particles. The results showed the absence of orthophosphate in the iron sludge. The aforementioned findings suggested that ferrate (VI) could not sufficiently degrade these DOP model compounds into inorganic phosphorus. It is well known that ferrate (VI) preferentially transforms dissolved organic matter, rather than completely oxidizing it into inorganic species [20,43]. This was evidenced by the fact that ferrate(VI) oxidation could readily alleviate chemical oxidation demand (COD) but poorly abate DOC when it was used for the degradation of NOM in natural water sources [20]. This finding was primarily ascribed to the nature of ferrate (VI). Although it has a high redox potential of up to 2.20 V, ferrate (VI) oxidation is highly selective. The oxidative anion tends to react with electron-rich moieties, but very slowly reacts with electron-poor moieties. Meanwhile, ferrate (VI) is subject to its self-decomposition in water, which can make ferrate (VI) gradually decay until ferrate (VI) depletion. Based on the mass balance analysis, only daughter P-containing compounds existed in the treatment systems. The degradation of the parent compounds could be validated with the identification of decomposition products in solutions after the treatment using the mass spectrometry technique. The results in the ferrate (VI) treatment of the selected DOP model compounds clearly indicated that most of the P was associated with the finally produced iron (hydr)oxides. Therefore, the P was plausibly present in the degradation products of the DOP model compounds after ferrate (VI) treatment. Overall, the major plausible reaction mechanisms for ferrate (VI) removal of the selected DOP compounds are as follows. Ferrate (VI) first attacks certain functional groups on the DOP parent compounds for the production of various P-containing compounds. The chemical oxidation most likely occurs in electron-rich moieties. With the nature of different degradation products, some sorb to the produced iron (hydr)oxides, while the others remain in the water in a soluble state. Adsorption of P-containing organic compounds to various iron oxides has been documented elsewhere [34,46,47]. It should be noted that the aforementioned reaction pathways for ferrate (VI) oxidation and ensuing adsorption for the removal of DOP are proposed based on the experimental evidence with selected DOP model compounds. Organic phosphorus in EfOM may have been contributed from many other individual organic compounds in the secondary effluent. Further studies are needed for an in-depth understanding of ferrate (VI) reactions with other DOP species in EfOM.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2849 11 of 14"

            "text": "Ferrate (VI) removal of DOP, similar to ferrate (VI) alleviation of phosphate in water, can be greatly influenced by the ferrate (VI) dose and solution pH. Better DOP removal was achieved at a higher ferrate (VI) dose during the treatment of secondary effluent because more Fe (VI) was available for the degradation of DOP compounds and more iron (hydr)oxide particles were produced for adsorption of the DOP degradation products. On the other hand, a lower pH of 5.5\u20136.5 favored DOP removal likely due to the greater ferrate (VI) reactivity. Ferrate (VI) reactivity is acutely increased with a pH decrease [16]. The extremely strong Fe (VI) at such an acidic condition may greatly degrade DOP into inorganic phosphate before the removal of P through adsorption. However, in realistic municipal wastewater treatment, solution pH mostly varies within a nearly neutral pH range (6.5\u20138.5). In the treatment tests with real secondary effluent, a very slight difference was observed for the DOP removals over pH 6.5\u20138.0. However, in the ferrate (VI) treatment tests for model DOP compounds, better removal was observed at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.5. As discussed above, the difference was caused due to the different size distribution patterns of ferrate (VI) resultant particles produced at different pH. Generally, more large-sized particles were produced at pH 6.5, so that these particles to which DOP compounds adsorb were readily removed in the downstream filtration, thereby having a lower residual DOP. Different from many other wastewater matrix constituents without a marked effect on ferrate (VI) removal of DOP, phosphate exhibited a significant inhibiting effect. Adsorption of phosphate to ferrate (VI) resultant particles was the dominant mechanism for ferrate (VI) removal of reactive phosphate in secondary effluent. More phosphate was expected to be captured by the ferrate (VI)-induced particles when more phosphate was present in the secondary effluent. The ferrate (VI) treatment tests for the removal of model DOP compounds also revealed that the adsorption of P-containing degradation compounds to ferrate (VI) resultant particles played an essential role in the DOP alleviation. Therefore, there was a competition between phosphate and DOP compounds for active adsorption sites on iron (hydr)oxides. More adsorption sites would be occupied at a higher initial phosphate concentration, so that fewer DOP compounds were adsorbed. Additionally, phosphate had a greater affinity with various iron oxides than many organic phosphorus compounds [46]."

            "text": "The findings of this work have unique implications for the wastewater industry in the following aspects:\n(1) This study finds a new pathway to prevent recalcitrant wastewater-derived DOP from entering natural receiving water bodies. The addition of common coagulants, such as ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate, has been used as a widely accepted method for the elimination of phosphate from biologically treated municipal wastewater due to their effectiveness and low costs. Although coagulation can well remove reactive phosphate, it has proven ineffective for the mitigation of DOP. Encouraging results from this study show that ferrate (VI) is a promising treatment agent for capturing DOP in secondary effluent. This is of significance, particularly for the natural water bodies that are highly environmentally sensitive to nutrient loadings (e.g., the Chesapeake Bay in the United States). (2) Ferrate (VI) removal of DOP can be significantly influenced by the ferrate (VI) dose, water pH, and the presence of phosphate. The first two are operating factors, while the last one represents a wastewater matrix constituent. For different secondary effluents, the specific optimal ferrate (VI) dose and pH need to be determined. It should be noted that the original secondary effluent pH may not be the optimal level. If an additional pH adjustment is required before and after the treatment, the costs are increased due to the use of acid/base as well as additional pH adjustment equipment and pipelines. Accordingly, the system design, operation, and maintenance would become more complex. If this is the case, what ferrate (VI) dose and pH are realistically\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 2849 12 of 14\nadopted depends on the comparison at different operational conditions in terms of treatment efficiencies and treatment expenses.\n(3) This study reveals that DOP adsorption to ferrate (VI) resultants plays a vital role in the ferrate (VI) removal of wastewater DOP. The controlling of particle sizes during the treatment operation is essential to selection the of appropriate downstream liquid\u2013 solid separation techniques, because different liquid\u2013solid separation methods are effective for different particle size ranges. Generally, larger particles are more readily and less costly separated. Therefore, the size growth of particles during ferrate (VI) treatment through appropriate engineering designs and operation control (e.g., control of pH and chemical mixing gradients) deserves a further investigation in future."

            "text": "In this study, the treatment performance of ferrate (VI) removal of DOP in secondary effluent was evaluated. The effects of two operating factors (i.e., ferrate (VI) dose and water pH) and four coexisting wastewater matrix constituents (i.e., alkalinity, nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate) were particularly evaluated. In order to elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms, ferrate (VI) reactions with two DOP model compounds were investigated. The major conclusions from this study are summarized as follows:\n(1) Ferrate (VI) treatment is a technically effective method for the mitigation of organic phosphorus in biologically treated municipal wastewater. The treatment efficiency is influenced by the ferrate (VI) dose and pH. (2) Among different wastewater matrix constituents, alkalinity, nitrate, and ammonia have very limited influence on ferrate (VI) removal of DOP. In contrast, inorganic phosphate can suppress the DOP removal. The inhibiting effect is ascribed to the competitive adsorption of phosphate with OP compounds for active adsorption sites on the ferrate (VI) resultant particles. (3) Based on the studies with DOP model compounds, ferrate (VI) oxidation and ensuing adsorption with ferrate (VI) resultant particles are the major DOP removal mechanisms. Specifically, ferrate (VI) firstly degrades these parent DOP compounds into daughter P-containing compounds, followed by the adsorption of these daughter compounds by the resultant iron (hdyr)oxide particles. Of note, inorganic phosphate is not observed after ferrate (VI) treatment of DOP model compounds, suggesting that ferrate (VI) insufficiently degrades DOP into inorganic P. However, the conclusions are made only based on the selected model compounds. Given that DOP derives from various EfOM molecules, novel experimental approaches need to be developed for the exploration of the mechanisms for ferrate (VI) removal of aggregate DOP in secondary effluent.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijerph20042849/s1, Figure S1: LC-MS information of ATP (A: LC detection of pure ATP; B: MS of ATP molecule; C: MS of daughter product); Table S1: Water quality of sampled secondary effluent.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.D.; methodology, Y.D. and L.Z.; formal analysis, L.Z. and P.G.; investigation, L.Z. and P.G.; data curation, H.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, L.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.D., Y.S. and H.W.; supervision, Y.S.; project administration, Y.D.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This research was funded by the scientific research start-up fund from Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, grant number F701104L02.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: The data in this study are available within the article and Supplementary Files.\nInt.
