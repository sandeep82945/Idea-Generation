1. **Investigate the impact of technological advancements on the stability and change of city networks.** How do emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things, affect the connections between cities and the overall structure of the network?


2. **Analyze the role of government policies and regulations in shaping city networks.** How do policies related to trade, investment, and infrastructure development influence the formation and evolution of city connections?


3. **Examine the relationship between city networks and other aspects of urban development, such as population growth, economic diversification, and environmental sustainability.** How do changes in city networks impact these other dimensions of urban development, and vice versa?


4. **Develop dynamic models of city networks that can simulate the evolution of the network over time.** These models could be used to explore different scenarios and assess the potential impact of various policies and interventions on the stability and change of city networks.


5. **Conduct comparative studies of city networks across different regions or countries.** How do the patterns of stability and change in city networks vary across different contexts, and what factors contribute to these variations?
