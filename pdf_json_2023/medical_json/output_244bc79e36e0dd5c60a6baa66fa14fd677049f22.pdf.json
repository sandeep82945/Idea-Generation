    "abstractText": "This study characterised the changes in global gene expression in the lung of ICR mice in response to the inflammation and fibrosis induced by the inhalation of 0.5 \u03bcm polystyrene (PS)-nanoplastics (NPs) at various concentrations (4, 8, and 16 \u03bcg/ mL) for 2 weeks. The total RNA extracted from the lung tissue of NPs-inhaled mice was hybridised into oligonucleotide microarrays. Significant upregulation was detected in several inflammatory responses, including the number of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the expression level of inflammatory cytokines, mucin secretion, and histopathological changes, while they accumulated average of 13.38 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/g in the lungs of the inhaled ICR mice. Similar responses were observed regarding the levels of fibrosis-related factors in the NPs-inhaled lung of ICR mice, such as pulmonary parenchymal area, expression of pro-fibrotic marker genes, and TGF-\u03b21 downstream signalling without any significant hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In microarray analyses, 60 genes were upregulated, and 55 genes were downregulated in the lung of ICR mice during inflammation and fibrosis induced by NPs inhalation compared to the Vehicle-inhaled mice. Among these genes, many were categorised into several ontology categories, including the anatomical structure, binding, membrane, and metabolic process. Furthermore, the major genes in the upregulated categories included Igkv14-126000, Egr1, Scel, Lamb3, and Upk3b. In contrast, the major genes in the down-regulated categories were Olfr417, Olfr519, Rps16, Rap2b, and Vmn1r193. These results suggest several gene functional groups and individual genes as specific biomarkers respond to inflammation and fibrosis induced by PS-NPs inhalation in ICR mice.",

            "text": "Nanoplastics (NPs) cause inflammation and toxicity because they can accumulate in various body organs after ingestion, inhalation, and exposure [1]. On the other hand, there are conflicting results regarding the effects of NPs as a risk factor for human health in cells and laboratory animals [2, 3]. In many studies, some inflammation or toxicity was detected in several human cells after treatment with polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP)-NPs of various sizes, but the treatment concentrations were different [4\u201311]. In addition, these responses were accompanied by various physiological responses, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, histamine release, and oxidative stress [5\u20139, 11]. Only a few studies reported that some types of NPs, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), PS, and carboxy-modified PS, cannot induce significant cytotoxicity in specific human cells, * Dae Youn Hwang dyhwang@pusan.ac.kr 1 Department of\u00a0Biomaterials Science (BK21 FOUR Program)/Life and\u00a0Industry Convergence Research Institute/ Laboratory Animals Resources Center, College of\u00a0Natural Resources and\u00a0Life Science, Pusan National University, Miryang\u00a050463, Republic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea 2 Department of\u00a0Food Science and\u00a0Nutrition, College of\u00a0Human Ecology, Pusan National University, Busan\u00a046241, Republic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea 3 Department of\u00a0Clinical Laboratory Science, College of\u00a0Nursing and\u00a0Healthcare Science, Dong-Eui University, Busan\u00a047340, Republic\u00a0of\u00a0Korea\n1 3\nexcept at high concentrations [12\u201314]. Furthermore, conflicting results on the toxicity of NPs in various mammalian cell lines have been detected in laboratory animals. Numerous studies have shown that NPs cause significant toxicity or inflammation in various tissues of animals [15\u201317]. In addition, significant alterations in the various physiological responses, including lipid metabolism, microbiota dysbiosis, and intergeneration effects, were induced in the specific organs of animals after a treatment with PS-NPs of various sizes [15, 18\u201321]. Nevertheless, some PS particles have no significant effects on the toxicity, inflammation, and behavioural consequences in animals [13, 22].\nMost animal studies examined the mechanisms for NPs toxicity in orally administered animals. Other administration routes were used restrictively. Among these other routes, inhalation has attracted considerable attention because the concentration of NPs in the air has increased rapidly [23]. Significant changes in the various physiological responses were detected in rats and mice that inhaled NPs of several sizes for various periods. Fourteen days of PS-NPs inhalation caused significant changes in the inflammatory proteins, pulmonary function, and fibrosis-related markers in SD rats [24]. In addition, the behavioural changes accompanied by inflammation and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition were detected in mice that inhaled PS-NPs, while ventilator dysfunction, fibrotic pathological changes, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and an increase in inflammatory cells were induced in C57BL/6 mice after the inhalation of tire-wear NPs [25, 26]. Similar responses on the alveolar epithelial injury, inflammatory response, and fibrosis development were induced in mice and rats after the intratracheal administration of PS-NPs [27, 28]. On the other hand, no study has investigated the profile of the global genes during inflammation and fibrosis induced by PS-NPs inhalation in the lungs of the ICR mice.\nThis study characterised the changes in global gene expression in the lungs of ICR mice in response to inflammation and fibrosis induced by the inhalation of PS-NPs. The present study revealed several gene functional groups and individual genes that can be considered biomarkers in response to NPs inhalation in the lungs of ICR mice."

These levels were higher in MiNP and HiNP-inhaled groups than in the LoNP-inhaled group (Fig.\u00a06A and B). On the other hand, the reverse pattern was observed in the number of NS. They decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner after NPs inhalation (Fig.\u00a06A and B). Furthermore, a similar regulation pattern was observed in the expression levels of four profibrotic marker genes: TGF-\u03b21, pro-collagen I, fibronectin, and CTGF. Their levels were significantly higher in the NPsinhaled groups than in the Vehicle-inhaled group (Fig.\u00a06C). These changes in the pro-fibrotic marker genes were accompanied by a change in the TGF-\u03b21 signalling pathway. The expression levels of the TGF-\u03b21, and \u03b2-catenin proteins and the phosphorylation levels\u00a0of Smad2/3 were significantly\n1 3\nhigher in the NPs-inhaled group than in the Vehicle-inhaled group (Fig.\u00a06D). Therefore, the NPs inhalation-induced inflammatory response is tightly associated with the upregulation of fibrosis in the lung tissue of the ICR mice.\nCharacterisation of\u00a0the\u00a0changes in\u00a0global genes expression in\u00a0the\u00a0lungs of\u00a0the\u00a0NP\u2011inhaled mice in\u00a0response to\u00a0inflammation and\u00a0fibrosis\nThe changes in the global gene expression in the lung of NPs inhaled ICR mice in response to inflammation and fibrosis were characterised. The total RNA extracted from the lung tissue of the NPs inhaled ICR mice for 2\u00a0weeks was hybridised into oligonucleotide microarrays. First, the differential distribution of global genes in normalised data was confirmed using a volume plot and scatter plot between the Vehicle and HiNP-inhaled group (Fig.\u00a07A and B). In addition, a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot showed significant clustering between the groups based on their similarity (Fig.\u00a08A). In contrast, a two-way hierarchical clustering heatmap represented the genes with significant alterations in expression level after NPs inhalation according to the rate of change (Fig.\u00a08B). Compared to the Vehicleinhaled ICR mice, 1,160 genes (lFCl \u2264 1.5) were detected as differentially expressed genes in the HiNP-inhaled mice. Among these, 791 genes were upregulated, and 369 genes were down-regulated in the HiNP-inhaled mice compared to the Vehicle-inhaled mice. On the other hand, statistical significance was detected in only 172 genes out of 1,160 differential expressed genes between the HiNP and Vehicle-inhaled group. After information analyses of each gene, 115 genes with clear symbols or IDs were selected\nto characterise the upregulated and downregulated gene list (Table\u00a01). Based on PANTHER/X ontology analyses, 115 selected genes belonged to 17 GO categories, including anatomical structure, binding, and biological regulation, even though there were differences in the number of genes (Table\u00a02). Furthermore, the genes upregulated and downregulated by NPs inhalation in the lung tissue of ICR mice were characterised. Of the 60 upregulated genes, the largest difference was detected in Igkv14-126 (7.43-fold), which was identified as an immunoglobulin-kappa variable region gene, followed by Egr1 (2.92-fold), Scel (2.47-fold), Lamb3 (1.99-fold), Upk3b (1.97-fold), and Ndufs8 (1.97- fold) (Table\u00a02). In addition, 55 genes, including Olfr417 (\u2212 2.37), Olfr519 (\u2212 1.97), Rps16 (\u2212 1.89), Rap2b (\u2212 1.88), and Vmn1r193 (\u2212 1.86) were down-regulated after the HiNP inhalation (Table\u00a03). Furthermore, the KEGG pathway functional analyses showed that some of these genes were related to three important pathways, including the metabolic pathway (Vnn3, Hmgcs1, SNPd4, Ndufs8, Ept1, Agk, Idh3a, and Acca1b), human papillomavirus infection pathway, and olfactory transduction pathway (Fig.\u00a09). In metabolic pathway, NP inhalation caused changes in the oxidation pathway of fatty acids, calcium signalling pathway, nitrogen metabolic pathway and nucleotide metabolic pathway (Fig.\u00a09B). The typical marker genes (Lamb3, Gsk3b, H2-Bl, and Atm) for lung diseases changed in human papillomavirus infection pathway (Fig.\u00a09C), while alterations on the several genes (Olfr417, Olfr390, Olfr446, Olfr605, Olfr519, and Olfr374) for the detection, recovery, and adaptation of olfactory were detected in olfactory transduction pathway after NPs inhalation (Fig.\u00a09D). Moreover, the expression level of two upregulated genes (lgkv14-126 and Egr1) and two down-regulated\nTable 3 (continued)\nGene symbol Gene name Accession No. Fold of change GO category\nHigd1a HIG1 domain family, member 1A NM_019814 1.53 HIG1 domain family, member 1A (Higd1a), mRNA\nAtp9a ATPase, class II, type 9A NM_001289445 1.53 ATPase, class II, type 9A (Atp9a), transcript variant 2, mRNA\nLpar6 Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 NM_175116 1.53 lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (Lpar6), mRNA\nIghv2-6-8 Immunoglobulin heavy variable 2-6-8 OTTMUST00000130395 1.52 Immunoglobulin heavy variable 2-6- 8[gene_biotype:IG_gene transcript_ biotype:IG_gene]\nCommd4 COMM domain containing 4 NM_025417 1.51 COMM domain containing 4 (Commd4), mRNA\nSnapc5 Small nuclear RNA activating complex, polypeptide 5\nNM_183316 1.51 Small nuclear RNA activating complex, polypeptide 5 (Snapc5), mRNA\nRars2 Arginyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial NM_181406 1.50 Arginyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial (Rars2), mRNA\nEpt1 Ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (CDP-ethanolamine-specific)\nNM_027652 1.50 Ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (CDP-ethanolamine-specific) (Ept1), mRNA\n1 3\ngenes (MPtx2 and Defa21) were measured by RT-qPCR analyses to verify the reliability of the results obtained from the microarray analysis. Their expression patterns were similar to those observed in the microarray analysis of lung tissue (Fig.\u00a010). Overall, NP inhalation for 2\u00a0weeks is closely involved in regulating the genes associated with the metabolic pathway, human papillomavirus infection, and olfactory transduction in the lung of ICR mice (Table\u00a04)."

            "text": "Finally, this study examined whether the inhaled NPs for 2\u00a0weeks could cause hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in ICR mice. The changes in the serum biochemical\nprofile, histopathological structure, and total weight of the liver and kidney in the ICR mice exposed to the NPs for 2\u00a0weeks were analysed. Compared to the Vehicle-inhaled group, no significant differences were detected in the liver, kidney, lung, and intestine weight (Table\u00a05). A similar pattern was also detected in the serum parameters for hepatotoxicity, including ALP, AST, ALP, and LDH, as well as nephrotoxicity, including BUN. The concentration of these parameters was maintained at constant levels without a significant alteration between the Vehicle and NPs inhaled groups (Table\u00a06). Furthermore, there were no remarkable pathological alterations, including inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis, and fibrosis, in the liver sections of the NPs\n1 3\ninhaled groups (Fig.\u00a011A). No nephrotoxicity symptoms, including degeneration and necrosis of the glomerulus and renal tubes, were detected in the histopathological structure of the kidney of the NPs inhaled groups (Fig.\u00a011B). These findings suggest that NPs inhalation cannot induce\nsignificant hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in ICR mice. However, these results were not enough to determine the NOAEL (No observed adverse effect level) of NPs because the evaluation of this value should be required all data for systemic toxicity including reproductive toxicity, bone\n1 3\nmarrow toxicity and toxicity to immune organs. Furthermore, the levels of water consumption, feed intake, and body weight remained constant in the LoNP, MiNP, and HiNP-inhaled groups compared to the Vehicle-inhaled group (Supplement Table\u00a0S1). In addition, a similar pattern was observed in the levels of all blood analysis parameters (Supplement Table\u00a0S2)."

            "text": "NPs can be taken up into the human body through various routes, including ingestion, dermal contact, entanglement, and inhalation, because they are widespread in the air, sea, and land [32]. After uptake, NPs can cause significant toxicity with oxidative stress and inflammatory and immune system inability [33]. On the other hand, the toxicity of NPs is limited because they are affected by the exposure concentrations, chemical properties, contamination, tissue uptake function, and individual susceptibility [33]. Furthermore, most information on these effects of NPs in a mammalian system was obtained from orally administered animals; experiments using other exposure routes are minimal. In this study, inhalation was selected as the other exposure route to uptake NPs into the internal system of animals. The changes in the global gene expression were characterised in the lung of ICR mice during the inflammation and fibrosis induced\nby NPs for 2 weeks. Therefore, the present study provides novel information on the gene profiles associated with the inhalation of PS-NPs, even though many unconfirmed genes have been involved.\nInflammation in the lungs is induced by infections by various pathogens, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses, as well as exposure to some particles, such as toxins, pollutants, irritants, and allergens [34]. This response has been detected in two different types: acute inflammation in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic inflammation in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [35]. During this process, many inflammatory cells are activated and release cytokines and mediators to recruit other inflammatory cells onto the site of inflammation. In addition, the inhalation of NPs can induce several inflammatory responses in the lung tissue of mice and rats. The levels of TGF-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression were significantly higher in the lung tissue of the PS-NPs-inhaled SD rats for 2\u00a0weeks, while the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was enhanced in the brains of mice that inhaled aerosol PS-NPs for 7\u00a0days [24, 25]. The expression level of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, increased in the lung of C57BL/6 mice and SD rats intratracheal administered with 0.1\u00a0nm\u20132.5\u00a0\u03bcm size of PS-NPs [27, 28]. This study investigated the inflammatory response in the lung tissue of ICR mice inhaled with PS-NPs with a 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm diameter. The upregulated expression of six cytokines was detected in the lung\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 4\nL ist\no f g\nen es\n(5 5)\nd ow\nnre\ngu la\nte d\nby th\ne M\nPs tr\nea tm\nen t\nG en\ne sy\nm bo\nl G\nen

These findings are consistent with a previous study showing the inflammatory response of the lung tissue of NPs-inhaled animals, even though their size and treated periods differed.\nPulmonary fibrosis is defined as a condition in which the lung becomes damaged and scarred [36]. This condition is accompanied by scarring and thickening of the tissue around and between the alveoli in lung tissue. This condition has various symptoms and complications, including shortness of breath, a dry cough, weight loss, nail clubbing, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and pneumothorax [37]. During fibrosis, pro-fibrotic mediators are secreted from the activated macrophages and neutrophils and promote the accumulation of myofibroblasts that produce extracellular matrix (ECM) [38, 39]. In particular, some soluble mediators, including TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, and galectin-3 (Gal-3), stimulate the transformation of endothelial cells to myofibroblasts, while TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of alveolar endothelial type 1 (AT1) cells [40]. In addition, the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis were observed in the lung tissue of animals that inhaled NPs. SD rats that inhaled 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm PS-NPs for 2\u00a0weeks exhibited a significant decrease in pulmonary function and an increase in fibrosis-related markers, including TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and vimentin [24]. A ventilatory dysfunction, fibrotic pathological changes, and deposition of collagen and E-cadherin were detected in the lung of the C57BL/6 mice after the inhalation of tire-wear NPs, while the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway and increased in \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and collagen expression were observed in the same mice intratracheal administered with PS-NPs [26, 27]. Some similar pathological changes, including alveolar destruction, were detected in the lung of the SD rats intratracheal installed by PS-NPs for 2\u00a0weeks [28]. This study examined the pulmonary fibrosis in the lung of ICR mice after inhalation of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm PS-NPs for 2\u00a0weeks. The expression levels of the pro-fibrotic marker genes and the pathological score were increased in the NPs-inhaled group, as shown in Fig.\u00a06. These two key parameters are consistent with previous studies that reported the inhalation effects of NPs on the pulmonary fibrosis of the lung tissue.

Recently, this analysis was used to characterise the response to NPs in cells and mice, even though there have been very few studies. Seven hundred and seventy genes, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signalling pathway, and Hippo signalling pathway,\nwere expressed differentially in human lung epithelial cells treated with 7.5\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2 PS, while 1951 genes, including ECM-receptor interaction, steroid biosynthesis, and PI3KAkt signalling pathway changed significantly in the same cells treated with 7.5\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2 PS during induction of apoptosis [45]. In addition, remarkable alteration in several genes related to the immune responses (STAT5A and DEFB132), immunoglobulin genes (IGKV1-12, IGHV3-38, IGLV327, IGLC2, LGHM, IGLV1-40, and IGLLC7), microRNAs (NEAT1, MIR1290, MIR4694, MIR4668, MIR4532, MIR4703, and MIR3165), and miR-related gene (MIR4713 and MIR4269) were detected in human microglial HMC-3\nTable 6 Changes in the serum biochemical analysis parameters Category Vehicle LoMP MiMP HiMP\nALT (U/L) 37.8 \u00b1 2.8 36.3 \u00b1 1.9 33.3 \u00b1 2.9 33.8 \u00b1 3.2 AST (U/L) 69.4 \u00b1 4.7 68.5 \u00b1 4.6 67.7 \u00b1 5.1 63.3 \u00b1 4.4 ALP (g/mL) 85 \u00b1 6.4 113.33 \u00b1 6.6* 85.8 \u00b1 17.2 94.3 \u00b1 9.9 BUN (mg/dL) 37.4 \u00b1 1.8 33.4 \u00b1 1.4 32.5 \u00b1 3.2 38.9 \u00b1 2.9 LDH (U/L) 1518.8 \u00b1 116 1339.2 \u00b1 150.7* 1399.5 \u00b1 91.5* 1331.8 \u00b1 185.6*\nFig. 11 Histopathological structures of the liver and kidney.

In particular, only one study examined the response to NPs in the specific tissues of mice. The hippocampus of the C57BL/6J mice administered PE for 2\u00a0weeks showed changes in the total 22 genes (14 increased genes and 18 decreased genes), which were related to the negative regulation of protein binding, transcription, DNA templates, and angiogenesis on GO terms [47]. In the prefrontal cortex of these mice, 23 genes related to endothelial cell chemotaxis, mitotic cell cycle arrest, and cell migration were significantly changed after the administration of PE [47]. In particular, the greatest fold changes were detected in early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1), followed by activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) [47]. The present study first characterised the change in global gene expression in the lung tissue of ICR mice in response to inflammation and fibrosis induced by PS-NPs inhalation for 2\u00a0weeks. A significant change in the NPs inhaled group was detected in 172 genes and three pathways, including the metabolic pathway, human papillomavirus infection, and olfactory transduction. Most of the genes detected in these results were different from those previously identified in the brain tissue after the administration of PE. The difference between the genes from this study and previous studies was attributed to differences in the target tissue used in the microarray experiments and the types of NPs administered to the mice. Furthermore, differences in the administration routes are expected to affect the number and class of altered genes significantly.\nTwo gene groups commonly changed in two different tissues of animals administered two types of NPs in two different routes were identified. First, EGR-1 was significantly increased in the lung tissue of PS-NPs inhaled ICR mice for 2\u00a0weeks and in brain tissue of C57BL/6 mice fed with PENPs for 2\u00a0weeks, but the rate of the increase was higher in lung tissue (2.92 fold) than the brain tissue (1.53 fold) [47]. EGR-1 was identified as a transcriptional regulator capable of various environmental signals, such as hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters, and was involved in some cell functions, including cell growth, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cell proliferation [48, 49]. This gene can respond to various biochemical signals produced by antigens and cytokines during the immune reaction and is associated with neuronal activity and many higher-order processes in the central nervous system [50, 51]. Second, several Olfr genes were commonly changed in the lung tissue of PSNPs-inhaled ICR mice for 2\u00a0weeks and the brain tissue of C57BL/6 mice fed with PE-NPs for 2\u00a0weeks. The expression of all the Olfr genes, including Olfr376, Olfr390, Olfr417, Olfr446, Olfr519, and Olfr605, decreased remarkably in the lung tissue of the ICR mice after PS-NPs inhalation. In the brain tissue, however, the expression levels of some genes (Olfr1303, Olfr435, and Olfr1352) were significantly higher\nin the hippocampus, and some genes (Olfr912, Olfr1442, and Olfr1284) were lower in the prefrontal cortex [47]. Olfr is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in the odorant detection process in olfactory sensory neurons and is encoded by the largest gene family in mice [52, 53]. Their role in the reliable recognition and accurate processing of chemosensory information is vital in the sensitive and selective responsiveness of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to odorous molecules and pheromones [54]. On the other hand, there has been no research on the co-relationship between NPs and the above two gene groups until now. The present study provided novel evidence that EGR-1 and Olfr can be sensitive and broad biomarkers for inflammation and fibrosis induced by NPs inhalation. Nevertheless, further studies will be needed to determine the application possibility of Secl as a marker gene under clinical conditions.\nOverall, the differential gene expression caused by inflammation and fibrosis induced by PS-NPs inhalation was characterised using the lung tissue from the Vehicle and NPs inhaled ICR mice. This study identified 115 genes with differential expression levels in response to the inflammation and fibrosis induced by PS-NPs inhalation in ICR mice for 2\u00a0weeks. This information on the gene profile might be useful for predicting the level of PS-NPs accumulation in lung tissue or evaluating the risk of PS-NPs. Nevertheless, this study had some limitations in that it did not evaluate the systemic toxicity of PS-NPs due to restrictions on the detection of PS-NPs concentration in the bloodstream after inhalation. Moreover, the lack of mechanism analyses of the effects of PS-NPs in the transcriptional regulation of brain-expressed genes should be considered a drawback of this study. Therefore, further research will be needed on the correlation between blood penetration and systemic toxicity of PS-NPs as well as between PS-NPs accumulation and the regulation of gene expression in the brain to understand the molecular effects of PS-NPs.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s43188- 023- 00188-y.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Miss Jin Hyang Hwang, the animal technician, for directing animal care and use at the Laboratory Animal Resources Center at Pusan National University.\nAuthor contributions YJJ: Data curation, Investigation, Software, Validation, Visualization, JEK: Investigation, Validation, YJR: Investigation, Validation, HJS: Investigation, Validation, AS: Investigation, Validation, JP: Investigation, Validation, LY: Investigation, Validation, SS: Writing\u2014review & editing, DYH: Conceptualization, Methodology, Supervision, Writing\u2014original draft.
