            "text": "For many years, research on materials that can convert solar energy into electrical/chemical energy represents a tremendous scientic and societal challenge. The main objective is to produce energy devices with good conversion efficiency and with eco-responsible energy sustainability. Today, several devices exist to meet these challenges allowing a conversion of solar energy into electrical or chemical energy (H2): photovoltaic cells, photocatalysts for water splitting, Photo-Electrochemical Cells (PEC), etc. 1,2 In these devices, the use of efficient photo-active materials in terms of both absorption of light energy and conversion efficiency is essential. For this, a great deal of research has already been carried out on the use of semiconductor oxides such as ZnO or TiO2.3 These oxides have\ne, UMR 8181, Unite\u0301 de Catalyse et Chimie E-mail: sebastien.saitzek@univ-artois.fr;\ns, UMR 8181, Unite\u0301 de Catalyse et Chimie\nand Physics, College of Arts and Sciences, tar\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\na high chemical stability and are relatively inexpensive, which are advantageous for large-scale industrial production. Nevertheless, it has been shown in the literature that best materials must absorb the maximum visible light and their band gap must be between 1.8 and 2.4 eV.4,5 Consequently, to be effective in visible light, the oxides described above must be combined with another absorbing compound in order to allow efficient conversion in the visible range. For example, TiO2 can be associated with an organic dye in order to design solar cells called dye-sensitized solar cells or associated with another semiconductor to create n/p hetero-junctions, as TiO2/Cu2O to design all-oxide solar cells.6 Of course, the absorption is not the only criterion, the efficiency of materials will also depend on their intrinsic properties to separate charges with a good balance between transfer and recombination rate. The diffusion length and the carrier's lifetime can also be conditions limiting the conversion efficiency.7\nToday, many ternary metal oxides are studied for applications as photoelectrodes because they have suitable bandgaps and bands edge positions for being used in water-splitting photoelectrochemical tandem cells under solar irradiation. Among these ternary metal oxides, there are main families such as spinels (CuFe2O4,8 CaFe2O4,9.), delafossite-type oxides (CuFeO2,10 AgRhO2,11.), perovskites (LaFeO3,12 BiFeO3,13.)\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12161\u201312174 | 12161\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

For example, Guo et al.15 obtained a current density of 12 mA cm\u22122 (at 1.23 V vs. NHE) on thick lms of b-Cu2V2O7 produced by the drop-casting technique in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution. However, these properties can be improved by controlling the microstructure of the oxide. Thus, Khan et al.16 highlighted a signicant improvement in current density (0.70 mA cm\u22122) for thick lms made up of micro-akes arranged in channels; C. Gadiyar et al.17 indicated a current density of 0.23 mA cm\u22122 (always at 1.23 V vs. NHE) in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution (pH = 9.2) containing 0.1 M Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger. Their study shows an optimal crystallite size at 40 nm corresponding to the hole diffusion length, estimated between 20 and 40 nm.18 Copper pyrovanadates (a- or b-Cu2V2O7 oxides) have also been studied for other applications, in particular for: (i) magnetoelastic and ferromagnetic coupling properties; (ii) ferroelectric properties induced by a magnetic order;19 (iii) photodegradation properties of azo-dye in water;20,21 (iv) solar water splitting;22,23 (v) catalytic SO3 decomposition;24 (vi) cathode materials in high voltage Li-batteries.25\u201327\nCopper pyrovanadate oxides have three polymorphic phases: (i) a-Cu2V2O7 (blossite) has an orthorhombic structure with Fdd2 space group and lattice parameters: a = 20.68 \u00c5, b = 8.411 \u00c5 and c = 6.448 \u00c5;28 (ii) b-Cu2V2O7 (ziesite) crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with A2/a space group and lattice parameters: a = 10.094(15) \u00c5, b = 8.020(13) \u00c5, c = 7.711(10) \u00c5 and b = 110.43(9)\u00b0;29 (iii) g-Cu2V2O7 (observed at high temperature in the range of 710 \u00b0C to 780 \u00b0C) has a triclinic structure with P 1 space group and the following lattice parameters: a = 5.0873(10) \u00c5, b = 5.8233(11) \u00c5, c = 9.4020(18) \u00c5, a = 99.780(3)\u00b0, b = 97.253(3)\u00b0, g = 97.202(3)\u00b0.30 Under normal pressure and temperature conditions, a- or b-Cu2V2O7 phase can be synthesized. For example, the reaction between V2O5 and CuO, at low temperature (T < 550 \u00b0C), lead to the stabilization of b-Cu2V2O7. While for syntheses at higher temperature (T > 560 \u00b0C), aCu2V2O7 phase will be privileged.31 However, fairly long calcination times are required,32 to achieve a pure phase. The bCu2V2O7 / a-Cu2V2O7 phase transition takes place around 605 \u00b0C. However, the b-Cu2V2O7 phase can also be obtained from a-Cu2V2O7 phase by heating it up to 710 \u00b0C and then performing a rapid cooling. In this case, the phase transition process is as follows: a-Cu2V2O7 / g-Cu2V2O7 / b-Cu2V2O7.31\nIn the literature, several synthetic routes are described, for example solid-state reaction,31 wet chemical method,21 Sol\u2013gel synthesis,33 hydrothermal synthesis,34 thermal decomposition method35 and nally ux method in close crucible to obtain single crystals.36 In thin lm form, studies are scarce and to the best of our knowledge only lms produced by electrospraying,22 simplied Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (sSILAR) method37 and drop casting method15 have been described.\nIn this present work, we studied the photoelectrochemical properties of Cu2V2O7 thin lms synthesized by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). The rst part of the work, devoted to the synthesis of pure powder and the preparation of the PLD target\n12162 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12161\u201312174\nwill highlight the difficulties of obtaining a dense target. In the second part, and for the rst time, we present the optimal conditions for the growth of thin lms, in particular the inuence of pressure and temperature. Finally, we will compare the photoelectrochemical properties of PLD-based thin lms with bulk form."

These precursors were weighed in stoichiometric proportions and ground for 20 min to ensure a good homogeneity. Then, the mixture was calcined in an alumina crucible at 620 \u00b0C under air for 15 hours. The PLD target (1 in. diameter) was produced by pressing the Cu2V2O7 powder (15 kbar) in a circular uniaxial press, then by sintering the pellet. The thermal cycle consists of a ramp up/down in temperature at 4 \u00b0 C min\u22121 and a step of 60 min at 720 \u00b0C.\nThe thin lms were synthesized by PLD technique using a Compex Pro 102 Laser (KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm). The synthesis conditions are: 1.5 J cm\u22122 for the laser density energy, 4.5 cm for the target-substrate distance and 4 Hz for the pulse repetition rate. Before the deposition, a preablation of 15 min is carried out in order to clean the target's surface.\nThe substrate temperature during deposition and the oxygen pressure are variable parameters studied in this work.\nThe structural properties of both powders and thin lms were performed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy. For the bulk form, the XRD patterns were recorded in the 15\u201370\u00b0 range with a step of 0.02\u00b0 and a scan speed of 0.4\u00b0 per min, using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu anticathode (lKa = 1.5418 \u00c5). Nickel foil lter and Soller slits are used to attenuate Cu Kb radiation and to limit the divergence of X-ray beam, respectively. While the thermodiffraction patterns were recorded on a D8 Bruker device. For the thin lms, the XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer attached to a 9 kW rotating anode Xray generator (lKa1 = 1.54056 \u00c5) and monochromatized with a double Ge (220) monochromator. Raman spectra were recorded in back scattering geometry using a Horiba Labram HR800 spectrometer coupled with a microscope which focused the 784 nm laser beam to a 1 mm spot.

The optical properties were characterized using a Shimadzu UVvisible spectrophotometer UV-2600 in the range of 190\u2013 800 nm with a resolution of 1 nm. This spectrophotometer was equipped with an integration sphere ISR-2600+, a photomultiplier tube and a InGaAs detector. The UV-visible diffuse reectance spectra can be used to determine the optical gap band (Eg) using the Tauc plot dened by the following equation:\nahn = A(hn \u2212 Eg)n (1)\nwhere a is the coefficient of absorption, hn the photon energy, A is a constant and n = 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect, respectively, allowed transition of the semiconductor.\nThe photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode cell (PEC 15 mL Redox.me\u00ae). The cell is calibrated for an illumination of 1 cm2 from the backside of the ITO/glass substrate (Delta Technologies, USA). The Pt wire was used as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl electrode was employed as the reference electrode. The working electrode consists of a Cu2V2O7 deposited either by drop casting using the powder directly (a suspension of nanopowders is prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide/distilled water with the 1 : 1 ratio, then annealed at 250 \u00b0C during 1 h in order to obtain a layer whose thickness is \u223c50 mm) or by PLD technique.\nThe photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a PGSTAT204 potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm) expanded with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) module and coupled with optical bench consisting of highly focused LED source. The intensity of the light beam can be controlled as well as the excitation wavelength via the use of low spectral dispersion LEDs. The whole is controlled by NOVA 2.0 soware. Finally, the electrolyte solution consists of 0.1 M sodium borate buffer solution also called NaBi Buffer (pH 9.2) with 0.1 M sodium sulte as a hole scavenger. This electrolyte was used to preserve the chemical stability of Cu2V2O7 (ref. 38) and to improve the intensity of the collected photocurrent.39"

The powder has a granular morphology with a mostly spherical shape with heterogeneous size. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) conrms the correct stoichiometric ratio (% at. Cu/% at. V = 1) without heterogeneity.\nThe optical band gap energy was determined from the UVvisible absorption spectrum using Tauc method (Fig. 1c), knowing that a-Cu2V2O7 has an indirect band gap (n = 1/2).43 The determined value of the optical band gap is 2.35 eV (i.e. 528 nm). This value is particularly interesting because it is very close to the maximum intensity of the solar spectrum.\nIn order to prepare the PLD target, it is essential to study the Cu2V2O7 oxide stability by performing a thermal analysis by ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements. For DSC, two heating/cooling thermal cycles are carried out between 50 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C with 10 \u00b0 C min\u22121 and 20 \u00b0C min\u22121 rate, respectively. The results obtained are presented in Fig. 2a.\nDuring the rst cycle, an endothermic peak (I) is observed on heating, attributed to a / g phase transition (677 \u00b0C).44 Then, on cooling, three exothermic peaks appear. The rst peak (III) corresponds to g / b phase transition (\u223c595\u2013600 \u00b0C). The two other peaks (IV and V) correspond to crystallization at low temperature of b-Cu2V2O7 phase. Indeed, B. V. Slobodin et al.44,45 indicates that above 720 \u00b0C, a small amount of CuVO3 is formed which forms an eutectic with the a and b phases having a low crystallization temperature.44 For the second cycle, a difference is observed. Indeed, the appearance of a new endothermic peak (II) is observed, which is related to the formation of b-Cu2V2O7 phase during the cooling step of the rst cycle. This peak is attributed to b / a transition (557 \u00b0C). The second cooling step took place in the same way as that of the rst cycle (the difference between peaks IV and V is only due to the different cooling rates thus conrming that it is an enthalpy of crystallization). The analysis of the weight loss with temperature presented in Fig. 2b, highlights the reduction of copper observed during the cooling step of the rst cycle. The weight loss aer 715 \u00b0C thus highlights a copper reduction (oxygen release) and the start of peritectic transformation around 770 \u00b0C. Indeed, above 725 \u00b0C, Cu2V2O7 undergoes a congruent fusion followed by an incongruous transformation towards 770 \u00b0C (peritectic decomposition).45\nIn order to understand this low crystallization temperature (IV and V peaks) due to the presence of the eutectic, additional measurements were undertaken but this time with a temperature limited to 720 \u00b0C. At this temperature, Cu2V2O7 phase is not reduced and therefore should not form eutectics. The TGA/DSC analysis cycles limited to 720 \u00b0C are shown in Fig. 3. As already observed by B. V. Slobodin et al.,44 the rst heating step leads to the transformation a / g at 705 \u00b0C (the XRD reference pattern is shown in Fig. S3 \u2013 ESI\u2020). Then, the rst cooling is accompanied by a release of heat due to the transformation g / a/ b. The second cycle shows an endothermic peak due to the transition from b / a at 604 \u00b0C (this peak is due to b-Cu2V2O7\n12164 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12161\u201312174\nwhich is formed during the rst cooling), then comes the a/ g phase transformation, as during the rst heating. The following cycles are similar and the crystallization peaks at low temperature are no longer observed, thus conrming the presence of an eutectic with the phase formed above 725 \u00b0C. This decomposition at a temperature higher than 725 \u00b0C is problematic because it limits the sintering temperature of the PLD target and therefore its densication.\nTo conrm this behavior, in situ high temperature X-ray diffraction was performed over the temperature range 50 \u00b0C to 725 \u00b0C (heating/cooling in the same cycle). Fig. 4a shows a partial 2D map (XRD patterns vs. temperature) of a-Cu2V2O7 powder (the complete 2D map is presented in Fig. S4 ESI\u2020).\nInitially, the presence of a pure a phase is observed. When the temperature increases, some diffraction peaks shi towards the large angles (as shown in Fig. S5 \u2013 ESI\u2020), highlighting the presence of a negative Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE).46 This shi is not identical according to the crystallographic planes. This reects an anisotropic evolution of the unit cell as a function of temperature.47\nAround 710 \u00b0C, a phase transition is observed (dashed lines in Fig. 4a). This transition corresponds to the transformation of the a phase towards a phase which can be attributed to the Cu1.98V1.96O6.92 phase with C2/c space group, previously described by S. A. Petrova et al.48 and called b\u2032-Cu2V2O7 (Fig. S7 \u2013 ESI\u2020). The presence of this phase also explains the mass loss observed in the TGA (oxygen release and Cu2+ reduction) measurements and we can note that a slight part seems to have melted in the sample holder, as observed at the end of the DSC thermal cycle. During cooling, a phase transition is also observed from the b\u2032-Cu2V2O7 phase to the b-Cu2V2O7 phase at 600 \u00b0C. This phase is then preserved when returning to room temperature. From a structural point of view, the b\u2032 / b phase transition causes a decrease in the V\u2013O\u2013V angle and a slight expansion of the VO4 tetrahedra.48 Here, a discrepancy with the TGA/DSC thermal analysis has to be noted. In the literature, a/ g transition is observed around 700 \u00b0C (as described in the DSC analysis part). However, in this present case, the XRD patterns indicate unambiguously that the obtained phase is b\u2032Cu2V2O7 phase (Cu1.98V1.96O6.92). Consequently, the a / g phase transition previously claimed is in fact a a / b\u2032 transition. Thus, all of the ATG data can be re-interpreted in the same way but this time by replacing the g phase by the b\u2032 phase (structural evolution of Cu2V2O7 oxide is presented in Fig. S8 \u2013 ESI\u2020).\nConcerning b-Cu2V2O7, X-ray thermodiffractograms show a negative expansion behavior (as depicted in Fig. S9 and S10 \u2013 ESI\u2020) which correlates with the literature.49 In addition, the dotted circles in Fig. 4a reveal the formation of a small amount of b-Cu2V2O7 from 500 \u00b0C then disappears around 600 \u00b0C (corresponding to the b / a transition as observed on the DSC curve in Fig. 3). In summary, a good correlation between DSC and HT-XRD experiments is highlighted shading some light on the complex thermo-structural behavior of copper vanadate.\nThose results also make possible to dene the optimal conditions for developing the PLD target. For sintering, the temperature is limited to 720 \u00b0C (start of melting of a small part\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The aCu2V2O7 powder was then shaped into a pellet via uniaxial press (15 kbar), then sintered at 720 \u00b0C for 1 hour. To avoid the diffusion of the elements into the alumina plate, a platinum sheet was used during the sintering step. The pellet obtained is dark brown and the XRD pattern indicates as expected the presence of b-Cu2V2O7 phase (Fig. 4b). It is important to note that aer use, this target remains stable in air for a few weeks and then starts to disintegrate gradually. This phenomenon can be explained by the negative thermal expansion coefficient which induces strong mechanical stresses when the target is subjected to temperature variations caused by the laser impact.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

At 150 \u00b0C and 400 \u00b0C, no reection is highlighted except the reections of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). A temperature above 150 \u00b0C is necessary for the b-Cu2V2O7 crystallization. In addition, at high temperature also leads to the production of an amorphous thin lm.\nThus, aer setting the optimal temperature at 230 \u00b0C, we studied the inuence of the dynamic oxygen pressure in the chamber.

At 10\u22123 mbar, a b phase is obtained but with the presence of a parasitic phase of CuV2O6 (D). For higher pressure (10\u22121 mbar), the (200) reection of b-Cu2V2O7 goes out completely, indicating either the presence of an amorphous lm or no lm at all.

So, the charge transfer and the recombination rate constants can be obtained by modeling the transient photocurrent response.53,54 Indeed, the time constant of the decay or the overshoot is given by the expression (5):55\nj\u00f0t\u00de j\u00f0N\u00de j\u00f00\u00de j\u00f0N\u00de \u00bc e ts with s \u00bc 1 krec \u00fe ktr (5)\nMoreover, the ratio of the steady state photocurrent to the instantaneous photocurrent observed when the illumination is switched on is given by the expression (6):55\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Considering 450 nm illumination (f0 = 23 mW cm\u22122), the values of ktr and krec are 6.19 \u00d7 10\n\u22122 s\u22121 and 5.58 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121, respectively. The close values show that only half of the holes arriving at the surface are transferred to the solution under steady state conditions.\nIn addition, the capacitance versus potential (C\u2013V) measurement is used to determine the conduction type, the at band (E) and carrier density (N), which can be determined from the Mott\u2013Schottky (MS) plot (1/C2 \u2013 V). Fig. 6d shows the MS plot of the b-Cu2V2O7 lm performed at 1 kHz. The positive slope observed on the depletion zone indicates a n-type semiconductor behaviour. The E is estimated at \u22120.08 V (vs. Ag/ AgCl) which correspond to 0.66 V (vs. RHE). This value is consistent with the values described in the literature.15 The at band potential reects the position of the Fermi level.56 For n-\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12161\u201312174 | 12169\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Therefore, knowing the band gap value, we can estimate the position of both valence and conduction bands (inset Fig. 6d).

Considering dielectric constant at 1 kHz (3 = 100\u2013150),58 the electron concentration is assumed to be \u223c8.26 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22123.\nRegarding thin lms, chronoamperometry measurements were also carried out on b-Cu2V2O7 lms produced by PLD. The photocurrent response to different wavelengths and for several increasing luminous ux intensity is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI\u2020). We can also see that the best response is obtained under 450 nm illumination. Indeed, that drops by 66% and 86% for an excitation of 505 nm and 590 nm, respectively (for the same light intensity). Fig. 7a shows the variation of the current density between illumination and black (Dj) as a function of the intensity of the luminous ux (f0) for an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. We can see a progressive and linear evolution of Dj vs. f0 (Fig. 7b) as well as an improved current density response compared to the bulk of the a-Cu2V2O7 phase. The photocurrent scales linearly with the illumination power (Dj = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22123f0) indicating an ideal trap-free state. b-Cu2V2O7 can therefore be used as a photodetector. In addition, the instantaneous photocurrent spike is less intense (compared to the previous experiment performed on a-Cu2V2O7) indicating a low recombination constant (compared to ktr) in the case of bCu2V2O7 thin lms. ktr = 9.58 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s\u22121 et krec = 2.39 \u00d7 10 \u22122 s\u22121. Considering these values, the charge transfer dominates over the recombination if ktr/krec > 1 for the thin lms.\nFinally, Cu2V2O7 is also known to exhibit photocorrosion phenomenon.8 The stability of the lms was thus studied by chronoamperometry in 0.1 M NaBi buffer solution (pH = 9.2) and with a constant applied potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 7c). For the b-Cu2V2O7 thin lms, one can see that the anode current density is relatively stable, then undergoes a slight decrease with time. This drops to 8% over 1 hour under 450 nm illumination (f0 = 95 mW cm\n\u22122). This decrease is mainly due to a gradual dissolution of the photoanode in the electrolyte. Indeed, this deterioration can be induced by the formation of O2 bubbles at the interface and/or a reaction with the electrolyte because the zone of stability (pH) of the oxide is very small.59 This phenomenon has also been observed in the case of Cu2V2O7 lms, e.g. I. Khan et al.16 indicate a decrease of 2% and 14% in 1000 s for Cu2V2O7 produced at 500 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0 C, respectively. In order to check this point, we performed an image of the surface of the Cu2V2O7 thin lm and maps for the V, In and Cu elements between a zone not subjected or subjected to the electrolyte. In Fig. 8, we can clearly observe the\n12170 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 12161\u201312174\ndemarcation zone between a part subjected to the electrolyte showing circular corrosion phenomena and a part corresponding to the initial thin layer having a smooth appearance whose surface is constituted of granular conglomerates.

Nevertheless, the photostability needs to be improved in the futures studies. We can consider two paths: (i) improved the chemical stability with respect to the electrolyte or (ii) the encapsulation in order to protect the photoanode.

            "text": "In this work, two polymorphic forms of copper pyrovanadate (aand b-Cu2V2O7) were synthesized by solid-state reaction. The study of HT-XRD and TGA/DSC, allowed to determine the mechanisms governing phase transitions within copper vanadate. The evolution of the lattice parameters as a function of temperature has shown a non-linear evolution of the thermal expansion coefficient within the two phases (a-/b-Cu2V2O7). In addition, TGA/DSC analysis also determined the congruent melting temperature of Cu2V2O7, thus obtaining dense ceramics that can be used as a target for the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The photoelectrochemical properties have been studied both on thick lms produced by the drop casting method and on thin lms synthesized by PLD on glass/ITO substrates. In the case of thick Cu2V2O7 lms, the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nresults showed the generation of a larger photocurrent in the blue spectral region. In addition, the evolution of the variation of the current density between illumination and dark shows a double tendency with a linear growth then evolution in power law. From the transient photocurrent response, the recombination and transfer constants were calculated, showing that ktr is very close to krec. In the case of thin lms, the generated photocurrent presents a better efficiency for 450 nm illumination. In addition, the evolution of the variation in current density between illumination and dark shows a linear trend indicating the presence of a signicant concentration of traps. However, the transient photocurrent response showed a lower instantaneous spike indicating a higher ktr/krec ratio. Finally, a phenomenon of photocorrosion within thin lms representing 8% for one hour was demonstrated in this work.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
