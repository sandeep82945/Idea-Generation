1. **Investigate the effect of different lipid compositions on the stability and functionality of MRPLs.** This could involve varying the ratio of phospholipids to cholesterol, or incorporating different types of phospholipids or other lipids into the liposome membrane. The goal would be to optimize the stability and functionality of MRPLs for specific applications.


2. **Explore the use of MRPLs for the delivery of other bioactive compounds.** This could include natural products, drugs, or nutraceuticals. The goal would be to develop MRPLs that can effectively encapsulate and deliver these compounds to target cells or tissues.


3. **Investigate the use of MRPLs for targeted drug delivery.** This could involve modifying the surface of MRPLs with ligands that bind to specific receptors on target cells. The goal would be to develop MRPLs that can specifically target and deliver drugs to cancer cells or other diseased cells.


4. **Study the long-term stability and safety of MRPLs.** This would involve conducting long-term storage studies and evaluating the potential toxicity of MRPLs in animal models. The goal would be to ensure that MRPLs are safe for use in food and pharmaceutical applications.


5. **Investigate the use of MRPLs for the delivery of bioactive compounds in food products.** This could involve incorporating MRPLs into food products such as beverages, yogurt, or baked goods. The goal would be to develop food products that are fortified with bioactive compounds that can provide health benefits to consumers.
