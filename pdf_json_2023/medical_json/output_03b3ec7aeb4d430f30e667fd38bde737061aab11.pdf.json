    "abstractText": "Aim: Beta-thalassemia major requires regular blood transfusions throughout life, which in turn leads to iron accumulation in the body. While cardiac T2* MRI is the gold standard in determining cardiac iron accumulation, it is not always feasible, which has led to the search for new biomarkers. Herein, the value of growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting cardiac iron accumulation is investigated in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major. Materials and method: Forty-one patients aged 11\u201321 years and 41 age-, gender-, body mass index-matched healthy controls were included. Serum growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were compared between the patients and controls. Additionally, the relations of these biomarkers with cardiac and liver T2 *MRI were investigated in the patients. Results: In the patients, growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were higher than healthy controls (p< 0.001, p = 0.025, p< 0.001, respectively). There were no significant correlations of growth differentiation factor-15 and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide levels with both cardiac and liver T2 *MRI measurements. While there was no significant correlation of serum galectin-3 with cardiac T2 *MRI measurements, a negative correlation was found with liver T2 *MRI measurements (p = 0.040, rho= \u20130.325). Conclusion: All three biomarkers investigated in this study failed to predict myocardial iron accumulation in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemiamajor. However, a weak relation between serum galectin-3 level and hepatic iron accumulation was demonstrated.",

While cardiac T2* MRI is the gold standard in determining cardiac iron accumulation, it is not always feasible, which has led to the search for new biomarkers. Herein, the value of growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting cardiac iron accumulation is investigated in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major.

Additionally, the relations of these biomarkers with cardiac and liver T2 *MRI were investigated in the patients. Results: In the patients, growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were higher than healthy controls (p< 0.001, p = 0.025, p< 0.001, respectively). There were no significant correlations of growth differentiation factor-15 and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide levels with both cardiac and liver T2 *MRI measurements. While there was no significant correlation of serum galectin-3 with cardiac T2 *MRI measurements, a negative correlation was found with liver T2 *MRI measurements (p = 0.040, rho= \u20130.325). Conclusion: All three biomarkers investigated in this study failed to predict myocardial iron accumulation in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemiamajor. However, a weak relation between serum galectin-3 level and hepatic iron accumulation was demonstrated.\nIntroduction\nBeta-thalassemia major is a disorder caused by a defect in the beta-chain of hemoglobin. It requires regular blood transfusions throughout life, which in turn leads to iron accumulation in the body. Cardiac complications due to iron accumulation are the most common cause of death in these patients, and iron-chelation therapy helps to prevent these complications. Initiation of chelation therapy or dose adjustment is planned according to cardiac relaxation time T2* MRI and serum ferritin level.1 While cardiac T2 *MRI is the gold standard in determining cardiac iron accumulation, it is not always feasible, may require sedation and the scan time is long, which has led to the search for a new biomarker.2\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 is a protein involved in tissue homeostasis, differentiation, remodeling, and repair. It is elevated in acute injury, tissue hypoxia, and inflammation.3,4 Galectin-3 is a protein that has been implicated in the pathogenesis ofmany inflammatory, autoimmune conditions, and cardiovascular remodeling.4\u20136 N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is secreted in response to cardiac stress and volume overload.7 It helps to detect asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in the early diagnosis of cardiac disease.\nIn this study, the values of serum growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, andN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in predicting myocardial iron accumulation based on cardiac T2 *MRI measurements are investigated in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major. In addition, it was aimed to compare the levels of these markers in children with beta-thalassemia major with those in healthy children.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951122004206 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

            "text": "The main finding of this study is the inability of the serum growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels to detect cardiac iron accumulation in asymptomatic children with beta-thalassemia major. There was a weak relationship between serum galectin-3 levels and iron accumulation in the liver. Ferritin is a good marker to evaluate cardiac and liver iron accumulation. Serum growth differentiation factor15, galectin-3, andN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were found to be higher in children with beta-thalassemia major compared to healthy children, while similar levels were found in patients with or without cardiac iron accumulation.\nGrowth differentiation factor-15 is a cytokine that increases in cardiomyocytes in response to stress, inflammation, and tissue damage. In cases of stress, such as erythroblast apoptosis in the bone marrow, it reaches high levels in relation to ineffective erythropoiesis.11 In this study, the growth differentiation factor-15 value in children with beta-thalassemia major was found to be approximately 12 times higher than in healthy children. Similarly, high levels of growth differentiation factor-15 have been shown in\nprevious studies conducted in patients with both beta-thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia.12,13 Pasricha et al.14 investigated the association of growth differentiation factor-15 with ineffective erythropoiesis and bone marrow stress by measuring growth differentiation factor-15 levels both before and after transfusion. Growth differentiation factor-15 levels were shown to be significantly higher before the transfusion compared to 4\u20138 days after the transfusion. This finding suggested that growth differentiation factor-15 could reflect the effectiveness of the frequency and amount of erythrocyte transfusion. Our study is the first to investigate the relationship between growth differentiation factor-15 level and cardiac T2 *MRI in patients with beta-thalassemia major. Growth differentiation factor-15 was not associated with the level of cardiac and liver iron accumulation, and their elevated levels in our patients compared with healthy children were attributed to ineffective erythropoiesis or factors other than cardiac iron accumulation, such as anemia and hypoxia.\nGalectin-3 is a product of activated macrophages that bind to cardiac fibroblasts. Its increased levels indirectly reflect increased myocardial collagen secretion, interstitial fibrosis, transforming growth factor-beta activation, and thus left ventricular dysfunction.5,15 It also has a role in ventricular remodeling as well as the damage and inflammation seen in heart failure.16 In this study, while serum galectin-3 levels did not show a significant correlation with cardiac iron accumulation, it was weakly correlated with hepatic iron accumulation. The relationship between serum galectin-3 levels and cardiac iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia major has been previously investigated in adults, and likewise, no correlation was found.17 Galectin-3 levels were found to be higher in our children with beta-thalassemia major compared to healthy children, whichmay be attributed to inflammation and fibrosis due to factors other than cardiac iron accumulation, such as anemia and hypoxia. In our study, despite the presence of a correlation of serum galectin-3 levels with liver iron accumulation, a relation with cardiac iron accumulation could not be demonstrated. This may be because the patients with severe cardiac iron accumulation, unlike those with severe liver iron accumulation, were few in number.\nN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide released from the ventricles due to cardiac stress and volume overload reduces the preload with its natriuretic effect.7 In previous studies conducted with patients with beta-thalassemia major, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide is a sensitive biomarker to detect systolic and diastolic dysfunction.18\u201321 Elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels have been shown in both adult and pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia major. In this study, no correlation could be found between serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level and cardiac iron accumulation, which was supported by previous studies.20,22 Several studies investigated whether plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels are predictive of cardiac iron accumulation, based on cardiac T2* assessment by MRI. Kautsar et al.22 studied 68 children with betathalassemia major with a median age of 14 years with no signs of heart failure and showed no significant correlation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac T2 *MRI as in our study. Accordingly, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were not different between the patients with and without cardiac iron accumulation. Likewise, Mehrzad et al.21 evaluated serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels in 50 adults with beta-thalassemia major aged 18\u201346 years with preserved left\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951122004206 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nventricular systolic function and found no correlation with cardiac iron accumulation.21 On the contrary, Goudarzipour et al.23 reported a strong correlation between N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac T2 *MRI in 35 children with beta-thalassemia major at a mean age of 17 years. Of these, 26 (75%) had cardiac iron accumulation and 2 had heart failure. Our study includes a limited number of patients with cardiac iron accumulation, which may explain the absence of a significant correlation between N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and cardiac iron accumulation even though the levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were higher in our patients compared with healthy children. High levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in beta-thalassemia major may be due to anemia rather than cardiac iron accumulation. Anemia is known to increase N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. It causes tachycardia and increased cardiac output resulting in transmural wall stress. Also, fluid retention caused by the decrease in renal blood flow increases cardiac stress even more. Lastly, it has been suggested that changes in volume balance may have a direct effect on the levels of natriuretic peptides.24 In our study, a moderate negative correlation of mean annual serum ferritin level was foundwith both cardiac and liver T2 *MRI measurements, which is consistent with previous pediatric and adult studies.25\u201327 In this regard, although a strong correlation could not be demonstrated, it may be inferred that serum ferritin is still the best indicator for monitoring iron accumulation and regulating chelation therapy in centers where T2 *MRI cannot be performed. The strength of the study was that biomarker levels were compared with T2 *MRI, which is the gold standard method for detecting iron accumulation; however, the small number of patients with severe iron deposition limited this investigation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951122004206 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Since serum growth differentiation factor-15, galectin-3, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were found to be higher in children with beta-thalassemia major compared to healthy children, these biomarkers may be useful to show cardiac involvement due to the factors other than cardiac iron loads, such as anemia and hypoxia.\nAcknowledgements.
