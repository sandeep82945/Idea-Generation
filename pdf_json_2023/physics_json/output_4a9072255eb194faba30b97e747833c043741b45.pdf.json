    "abstractText": "A new series of nitric oxide-releasing estra-1,3,5,16-tetraene analogs (NO-\u2206-16-CIEAs) was designed and synthesized as dual inhibitors for EGFR and MRP2 based on our previous findings on estra-1,3,5-triene analog NO-CIEA 17 against both HepG2 and HepG2-R cell lines. Among the target compounds, 14a (R-isomer) and 14b (S-isomer) displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against both HepG2 and HepG2-R cell lines in comparison to the reference drug erlotinib. Remarkably, compound 14a resulted in a prominent reduction in EGFR phosphorylation at a concentration of 1.20 \u03bcM with slight activity on the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. It also inhibits MRP2 expression in a dose-dependent manner with 24% inhibition and arrested the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, compound 14a (estratetraene core) exhibited a twofold increase in anti-proliferative activity against both HepG2 and HepG2-R in comparison with the lead estratriene analog, demonstrating the significance of the designed \u2206-16 unsaturation. The results shed a light on compound 14a and support further investigations to combat multidrug resistance in chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent and lethal human cancers, and its incidence-to-mortality ratio is rising [1\u20136]. In 2020, HCC represented 2.4% of all new cancer cases and 5.0% of all cancer deaths [4]. The C subset of the human ATP-binding cassette (ABCC) transporters contains a huge group of membrane transport proteins comprising thirteen subfamily members (1\u201313) and plays a pivotal role in the recognition and transport of most drugs. Among them, the second member of multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) of the MRP subfamily of the encoded ABCC2 gene located on Chromosome 10q23-q24 with a unique amino acid sequence of the ATP-binding domain, which functions properly in drug resistance mechanisms as it is structurally similar to human MRP1 [7]. MRP2 is overexpressed in many cancers such as the liver, kidney, and small intestine to play a key role in the transport of many drugs such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, etoposide, irinotecan, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, SN-38, and Vinca alkaloids, in addition to endogenous metabolites. Korita and co-workers [8] and our research group [9] recently reported that HCC cells produce drug resistance via MRP2 overexpression, which\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062754 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 2 of 33\ncomprises the major problem associated with the available chemotherapeutic agents in 30\u201380% of cancer patients [10,11]. Furthermore, the EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, as well as MRP2, has been validated as effective targets for liver cancer therapy. So far, the discovered agents have revealed significant activity toward MRP1 and P-gp but rarely against MRP2 [8]. Therefore, it is still important to discover a dual inhibitor drug candidate with good efficacy and low toxicity targeting the EGFR-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway as well as MRP2. It is worth mentioning that the role of NO in cancer therapy is not only that of enhancing tumor blood flow and oxygen supply [12] but also reversing chemotherapy resistance through the upregulation of efflux pumps [13,14]. Along this line of research, Maksimovic-Ivanic et al. demonstrated that the hybridization of some drugs with NO, such as NO-NSAIDs and NO-HIV-PIs, promoted anticancer activity in a wide range of cancer cell lines and in in vivo models, invariably more potent, less toxic, lower dosing, and fewer side effects than the corresponding des-NO analogs [15]. The mode of action is likely multifactorial as they inhibit tumor cell growth, induce apoptosis, exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity, and potentially inhibit P-gp-, MRP-1-, and BCRP1-expressing cells making NO-releasing agents as candidates for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors [15]. Previously, we detailed the biological studies of NO-releasing cucurbitacin analogs with an estratriene core [16]. Among them, NO-CIEA 17 (Figure 1), exhibits broad-spectrum anti-proliferative activity against both HepG2 and HepG2-R cell lines with IC50 4.69 and 8.21 \u00b5M, respectively [16]. Therefore, overcoming the toxicity and cellular resistance problems encouraged us to look for a more active molecular target anticancer agent with nitric oxide-releasing properties for the treatment of HCC.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 37\nalkaloids, in addition to endogenous metabolites.

Along this line of research,\nMaksimovic-Ivanic et al. demonstrated that the hybridization of some drugs with NO,\nsuch as NO-NSAIDs and NO-HIV-PIs, promoted anticancer activity in a wide range of\ncancer cell lines and in in vivo models, invariably more potent, less toxic, lower dosing,\nand fewer side effects than the corresponding des-NO analogs [15]. The mode of action is\nlikely multifactorial as they inhibit tumor cell growth, induce apoptosis, exhibit antiangi-\nogenic and antimetastatic activity, and potentially inhibit P-gp-, MRP-1-, and BCRP1-ex-\npressing cells making NO-releasing agents as candidates for the treatment of multidrug-\nresistant tumors [15]. Previously, we detailed the biological studies of NO-releasing cu-\ncurbitacin analogs with an estratriene core [16]. Among them, NO-CIEA 17 (Figure 1),\nexhibits broad-spectrum anti-proliferative activity against both HepG2 and HepG2-R cell\nlines with IC50 4.69 and 8.21 \u00b5M, respectively [16]. Therefore, overcoming the toxicity and\ncellular resistance problems encouraged us to look for a more active molecular target an-\nticancer agent with nitric oxide-releasing properties for the treatment of HCC.\nEnlightened by the aforementioned and the activity profile displayed by NO-CIEA\n17 [16], we explored whether further D-ring modification to rigidify the conformations of\nthe estron skeleton would adopt strong interaction inside the target active sites to obtain\nthe highest potency. To this end, a new series of \u2206-16 unsaturated analogs NO-\u2206-16-CIEAs\n(Figure 1) was designed, allowing us to establish that the estratetraene core could\ni r . si str t f r t r t s - - - I s.\nfi [ ], l t f t - i ifi ti t i i if t f ti f t tr l t l t tr i t r ti i i t t r t ti it t t i t e i est potency. To this end, a new series of \u2206-16 nsaturated analogs NO-\u2206-16CIEAs (Figure 1) was designed, allowing us to establis that the estratetraene core co l successfully function as a bioisostere for the estratriene one keeping the NO-releasing\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 3 of 33\nfuroxan moiety at C-3, Cucurbitacin-like side chain at C-17, and altering the configuration around C-19 in the hope of discovering even more potent compounds."

            "text": "As outlined in Scheme 1, the synthesis of the key intermediate \u2206-16-\u03b1-hydroxy methyl ketones (11a,b) was started with estrone protection using tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) to obtain compound 1, which was then treated with lithium trimethylsilylacetylide to afford a mixture of a ratio about 1:1 of the corresponding propargylic alcohol 2 and 3. These alcohols were deprotected with TBAF (tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride) to form the desired intermediate 17-\u03b1-ethynylestradiol 4 in 95.50 % yield [17,18]. Copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) catalyzed regioselective Markovnikov hydration of 17-\u03b1ethynylestradiol 4 was developed to install the targeted double bond at the 16 position as well as the carbonyl functionality at the C-17 position via Rupe rearrangement. Hassam and Li [19] reported the synthesis of \u03b1,\u03b2-enone 5 only from the corresponding alkyne 4 using 20 mol% Cu(OTf)2 as a catalyst in ethyl acetate\u2013water mixture under reflux for 2 h. On exposing the catalytic system with one equivalent of Cu(OTf)2 and refluxing in ethyl acetate for 4 h, compound 6 was observed along with \u03b1,\u03b2-enone 5 in a yield of 15.50 and 46.48%, respectively [20\u201322]. The yield was reversed when the equivalence of Cu(OTf)2 was decreased to 20 mol% in the presence or absence of the catalytic amount of sulfuric acid under reflux. Further, the same results were obtained when the reaction was refluxed and catalyzed with sulfuric acid in either formic or acetic acid. Hence, the formation of aryl derivative 6 is favorable in strong acidic conditions [23]. Furthermore, the crude mixture of \u03b1,\u03b2-enone 5 and aryl derivative 6 underwent a reaction with TBSCl to protect the phenolic hydroxyl group, hence overcoming the solubility problems through the formation of compounds 7 and 8, respectively. Compared to other cyano donors, such as acetone cyanohydrin or hydrogen cyanide, TMSCN has the advantage of catalyzing the irreversible addition of CN to the carbonyl electrophile. Furthermore, the large trimethylsilyl group provides some steric hindrance, which can be useful to hold stereopreference for one of the two possible diastereomers [22]. The catalysts used for the addition of TMSCN to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated enone derivatives, i.e., ZnI2, TiCl4, Yb(OTf)3, LiOEt, Et3N, and 4-DMAP, have previously been shown to catalyze cyanohydrins synthesis [24]. As depicted in Table 1, the addition of TMSCN to the \u03b1,\u03b2unsaturated enone 8 was dependent on both the catalyst used and the reaction temperature. Cyanosilylation product 9 (1,2-adduct) is favored at low temperature (\u221220 \u25e6C) in the presence of Lewis acids, either one equivalent ZnI2 or 5 mol% Cu(OTf)2 [25,26]. Conversely, either the neutral (lithium ethoxide) or basic (potassium cyanide in 18-crown-6) catalysts at room temperature were able to promote the cyanation reaction towards the formation of 16-cyano derivative 10 (1,4-adduct). Furthermore, either decreasing the temperature up to \u221278 \u25e6C or proceeding without a catalyst, only resulted in the recovery of unreacted starting material [24,27\u201330]. Finally, the enone system (substrate 8) is planar concerning the D-ring and, thus, less constrained by the C-18 methyl group, allowing the approach of the reagent by both sides of the steroid molecule. Consequently, the ZnI2-catalysed addition of TMSCN yielded a mixture of epimeric cyanosilylated product 9 (50% yield), as observed by NMR, as well as 16-\u03b1-cyano analog 10 (20% yield) [24]. This lack of chemo selectivity in the ZnI2-catalysed TMSCN addition was not surprising. In fact, although the reported ZnI2 catalyzed 1,2-addition to conjugated enones, 1,4-addition was also noticed [24]. More specifically, the assignment of the 16-configuration of the cyano group was made based on the 1H NMR anisotropic shielding effect of this functional group toward the 18-CH3, which appears as a singlet peak at 0.42 ppm, in contrast with 0.73 ppm in the starting compound 8. Such an effect suggests that the methyl group is positioned in the conical area of the cyano substituent. In agreement with this observation, the coupling constant of the doublet due to the 17-H (2.79 ppm) is relatively high, J = 8.7 Hz, pointing to a trans-vicinal coupling with the 16-H (3.41 ppm) [24].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 4 of 33l l , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 7\nScheme 1.

Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) Study\nSubstitution at CUCs aromatic-like side chain with either electron-withdrawing (EWG) CF3 and Br (i.e., compounds 17b, 17i,j, and 20c,d) or electron-donating (EDG) CH3S and CH3O groups, as in compounds 17c\u2013e and 20a, had no significant effect on the anticancer activity. Notably, the EWG group F substitution at the CUCs aromatic-like side chain (i.e., compound 20b) may impact the activity. In contrast, CF3 substitution caused compound 17a to exhibit significant inhibitory effects in its anticancer activity, indicating that the electron-withdrawing substituents likely led to enhanced potency. On the other hand, replacing both EDG and EWG with a polar t-BuOH group caused compounds 14a and 14b to exhibit significant inhibitory effects in their anticancer activity, indicating that appending the CUCs side chain at C-17 likely led to enhanced potency. Furthermore, the results showed a significant improvement in anticancer activity, especially for compounds 14a and 14b, compared to des-NO-releasing compounds 13a and 13b indicating synergistic efficiency.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 9 of 33\nTable 2.

Moreover, compound 14b also ex-\nhibited an increase in the fraction of cells in the G2/M phase (17.08% compared to 7.06%\nfor the control) and a decrease in the proportion of cells in the S phase (39.99% compared\nto 48.82%) and the G0/G1 phase (42.93% compared to 44.11%) (Figure 5A,C). Therefore,\ncompound 14a arrested the cells in the S phase while 14b arrested the cells in the G2/M\nphase of the cell cycle.\nFigure 5.

NO Detection\nThe levels of NO produced intracellularly from compounds 14a,b and 17a along with JS-K (a known NO donor prodrug) were examined using NO-sensitive fluorophore DAF-FM DA, (Figure 6A\u2013D). It was observed that compound 14a showed a significant increase in fluorescence (2.9-fold compared to untreated cells) after 6 h of incubation in a dose-dependent manner and produced amounts of NO in tumor cells comparable to JS-K [16], which also showed a significant increase in fluorescence (2.9-fold compared to untreated cells) after 1 h of incubation in a dose-dependent manner. It was also found that compounds 14b and 17a showed a relative increase in fluorescence by about 1.38 and 1.13-fold compared to untreated cells (Control) after 1 h and 6 h of incubation in a dose-dependent manner, respectively. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that compound 14a is a far superior source of controlled NO release in comparison with the reference prodrug JS-K.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 13 of 33\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 37 The levels of NO produced intracellularly from compounds 14a,b and 17a along with JS-K (a known NO donor prodrug) were examined using NO-sensitive fluorophore DAFFM DA, (Figure 6A\u2013D).

Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h in a 37 \u25e6C humidified incubator (5% CO2). After that, cells were incubated for 48 h with the reference drug erlotinib, the absence (negative control), and the presence of various concentrations of tested compounds, respectively. Each group was arranged in four parallel wells. MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added (20 \u00b5L/well) and cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 \u25e6C. Finally, the MTT-containing medium was replaced with DMSO (200 \u00b5L/well) and mixed well. The absorbance was measured by a microplate reader (Hidex Sense) at a 570 nm wavelength. Survival percentage was calculated using the following Equation (1):\nInhibitory rate% = (Abs570 control cells\u2013Abs570 treated cells)\nAbs570 control cells \u00d7 100 (1)\nIC50 values were obtained from linear regression analysis of the concentration\u2013response curves plotted for each tested compound.\n3.3.2. Cell-Based ELISA Assay\nIn-cell Western protocol on an Odyssey\u00ae imager (LI-COR\u00ae) was followed according to manufacturer\u2019s directions [51\u201354]. Briefly, in clear-bottomed and black-walled 96-well plates, HepG2 cells were seeded (0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) and allowed to grow to confluence. Then, cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of compound 21a (0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 \u00b5M) and DMSO as control. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated for 2 h with an antibody with gentle shaking and then incubated overnight at 4 \u25e6C. Cells were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to IRdye for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed 4 times, and the plate was blotted dry. Phospho-proteins were normalized for total protein signals while p-MEK1/2 and MRP2 were normalized for the \u03b2-actin and GAPDH loading controls, respectively, to correct for well-to-well variation in cell number and %inhibition determined relative to control wells. Data are expressed as mean values of at least two runs \u00b1 SD.\n3.3.3. Cell Cycle Analysis\nThe HepG2 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated for 24 h with NOCIETA 21a (2.4 \u00b5M) and 21b (8.1 \u00b5M), and DMSO (0.001%) as a control. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS and collected after trypsinization [55]. Then, the cell pellet was washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS and fixed overnight with ice-cold 70% ethanol at \u221220 \u25e6C. After that, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and the second wash\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2754 30 of 33\nwith ice-cold PBS-2% FBS. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 500 \u00b5L propidium iodide (PI)/RNase staining solution (BD Biosciences) and 0.1% triton x-100 for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and analyzed within 1 h by BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) [56]. Data were analyzed by MFLT32 software and 10,000 events with slow flow rates were recorded for each sample.\n3.3.4. DAF-FM DA Assay for Intracellular Measurement of NO\nThe NO-sensitive fluorophore DAF-FM DA was used for quantification of NO intracellular levels. Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded in a six-well plate (7.5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) and allowed to grow overnight. Cells were incubated for 30 min with 2 mL per well of 2.5 \u00b5M DAF-FM DA at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2, rinsed twice, and then loaded with different concentrations of target compounds. After incubation time (1, 6, 12, and 24 h), cells were washed twice with HPSS, trypsinized, and pipetted into flow cytometer test tubes. The fluorescence formed intracellularly was analyzed by BD Acuuri C6 flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) with the excitation source at 495 nm and emission at 515 nm. Data are expressed as mean values of at least two runs \u00b1 SD [33,49,57,58]."

This software package generates chemguas4 scoring, which is a filtering process to obtain virtual binding affinity, the lower score, the better the binding affinity of the ligands toward the receptor. Briefly, a virtual library of NO-\u2206-16-CIEAs was energy minimized using MMFF94 force field, followed by generation of multi-conformers using OMEGA\u00ae application. The whole library was then subjected to shape and electrostatic similarity with the lead compound NO-CIEA I using EON application. The designed library was then docked along with the prepared EGFR (PDB:ID 1M17), ERK2 (PDB:ID 5NHJ), MEK1 (PDB:ID 1S9J), and MRP1 (PDB:ID 2CBZ) using FRED\u00ae application. Finally, Vida application was used to show the potential binding interactions of the ligands to the receptor of interest [37\u201339,59\u201362]."

            "text": "A new series of NO-\u2206-16-CIEAs was synthesized and evaluated for their anti-prolifera tive activity against hepatocellular carcinoma. Among them, 14a,b showed broad-spectrum potent anti-proliferative activity against both HepG2 and HepG2-R cell lines in comparison to erlotinib. Moreover, compound 17a showed remarkably high inhibitory activity against the HepG2 cell line comparable to erlotinib, while 17b did not show any activity at a concentration as high as 50 \u00b5M. Furthermore, compounds 17g and 17h were almost equipotent to Erlotinib. Compound 14a showed a significant increase in fluorescence after 6 h of incubation in a dose-dependent manner and produced amounts of NO in tumor cells comparable to the reference prodrug JS-K. Compound 14a arrested the cells in the S phase while 14b arrested the cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Compound 14a has a slight inhibitory activity toward the EGFR/MEK/MAPK pathway as shown by In-Cell-Based ELISA screening. It also showed a significant reduction in MRP2 expression in the HepG2-R cell line in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating a significant impact on the chemotherapeutic resistance. The molecular docking studies were found to be well correlated with cell study. The findings indicated that \u2206-16 unsaturated analog 14a with R configuration around C-19 and furoxan moiety at C-3 improved the anticancer activity twofold more than the corresponding estratriene analog NO-CIEA 17. The data support further investigation of 14a as a promising anti-liver cancer agent.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28062754/s1, copies of spectral data for the synthesized compounds are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
