1. **Investigate the role of NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the progression of atherosclerosis in different animal models.** This could involve studying the effects of NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition on plaque formation, inflammation, and atherothrombosis in mice and rabbits.


2. **Examine the relationship between NETs, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the development of specific atherosclerotic complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.** This could involve studying the presence and activity of NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome components in human atherosclerotic plaques and correlating their levels with the severity of the disease.


3. **Explore the potential of targeting NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation as a therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.** This could involve developing and testing novel drugs that inhibit NET formation, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, or the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages.


4. **Investigate the role of NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the development of atherosclerosis in patients with specific genetic backgrounds or co-morbidities, such as diabetes and obesity.** This could help identify individuals who are at higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and who may benefit from targeted therapies.


5. **Study the effects of lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, on NETs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in atherosclerosis.** This could help develop lifestyle interventions that may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and its complications.
