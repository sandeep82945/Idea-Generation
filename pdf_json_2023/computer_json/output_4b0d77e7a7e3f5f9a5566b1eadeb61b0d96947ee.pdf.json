INTRODUCTION\nEMRISTIVE synapse-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently drawn much attention in the field\nof novel artificial intelligence devices, due to their low operating power consumption, high integration density, and similarity with biological neural networks in functions [1]. The pairwise spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is believed to be one of the fundamental mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in biological neural networks, and it is also used as a wellknown unsupervised learning rule in SNN [2]. Accordingly, numerous studies on STDP implementation on memristive synapse neural network circuits have been carried out [3].\nSo far, most of the existing works have been devoted to studying the pairwise STDP, where the synaptic weight is modulated according to the timing difference between one presynaptic neuron (Pre) spike and one post-synaptic neuron (Post) spike [2]. Although the pairwise STDP has been proven to be capable in practice, it is reported that the classical pairwise STDP was not sufficient to characterize the synaptic changes induced by pairs of spikes with increasing repetition frequency and triplets or quadruplets of spikes [4]. To solve this issue, triplet STDP is developed as an extension of classic STDP [4]. According to [5], the existing triplet STDP rules can be clarified into two groups, and they are the suppression triplet STDP, and\nthe coactivation and timing-dependent integration rule. Compared with the first learning rule, which requires the memristor to perform forgetting behavior, the second learning rule is comparatively more difficult to achieve using circuits as it demands more complicated numerical operation and precise weight modulation. Consequently, only a few attempts have been made to implement the second learning rule in the memristive synapse-SNN until now [6], [7]. In this brief, a mixed-signal circuit scheme called multiplestep quantized (MSQ) triplet STDP is proposed, aiming to provide a more practical and robust implementation of coactivation and timing-dependent integration triplet STDP in memristive synapse-SNN. In our scheme, the whole circuit is driven by a global clock, and the synaptic weight programming signal is encoded into pulse width by utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM). By doing this, the flexibility, robustness, and compatibility of the circuit can be improved markedly.\nThe rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section II, the concept of trace and the working principle of the triplet STDP model is elaborated. Then, the working principle of the proposed circuit is demonstrated in Section III, along with an ideal pulse width encoded memristive synapse model used in the following study. In Section IV, the performance of the designed circuit is studied through simulations, and verification is carried out by comparing the simulated results with those achieved by algorithmic approaches. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section V."

            "text": "As described in [8], synaptic plasticity is induced by spikes of Pre and Post, but a single spike usually cannot cause longterm plasticity. Instead, each spike can lead to an update of the internal state variable at the synapse, known as the trace and denoted by \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61). According to the nearest-spike scheme [4], the trace \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61) updates to its maximum value \ud835\udc65 whenever there is a neuron spike and then decreases exponentially with a time constant of \u03c4. Such dynamic behavior can be described by\n\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52 , if \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc61 then \ud835\udc65 \u2192 \ud835\udc65 (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc61 denotes the moment when the neuron spike is fired. Fig. 1(a) shows a typical neural network in which the Pre \ud835\udc57 is connected to a Post \ud835\udc56 through a synapse. In the minimal triplet STDP, like the pairwise STDP, each spike from the Pre contributes to a trace \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc61) and it can be expressed as\n\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc52 , if \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc61 then \ud835\udc65 \u2192 1 (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc61 denotes the firing times of Pre, with \ud835\udc65 set to 1.

The weight increment is not only proportional to the value of the Pre trace \ud835\udc65 , but also relies on the value of the slow Post trace \ud835\udc66 , written as\n\u2206\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc61 +\n\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 (5)\nwhere \ud835\udf00 is a short period of time which ensures that the value of \ud835\udc66 can be read just before the Post spike\u2019s arrival and Post traces\u2019 update. The long-term depression (LTD) in triplet STDP is analogous to that in classical pairwise STDP, and the weight change is proportional to the value of the fast Post trace \ud835\udc66 , written as\n\u2206\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc61 .

Ideally, synaptic weight change is a linear process, namely the weight change is independent of the initial weight state. In other words, for any value of \ud835\udc4a , \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a , \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a and \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a keep constant. In this case,\n\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a , \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a and \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc4a can be substituted by constants \ud835\udc34 , \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc34 , respectively."

            "text": "Artificial synapse is one of the key components in neuromorphic circuits, and it characterizes the connection strength between two neurons through the synaptic weight, denoted by \ud835\udc4a . For artificial synapses implemented using memristive devices, the synaptic weights are presented by the conductance of memristors, such as in [10].\nGenerally, the synaptic weight can be modulated by imposing programming voltage signals across the positive and negative nodes of a memristive synapse. Ideally, the weightupdating process of artificial synapses should have linear and symmetric characteristics [11]. To achieve this, memristors with remarkable linear and symmetric LTP/LTD performance have been successfully fabricated [10]. Meanwhile, it is more practical to encode the weight modulation signal into pulse width, rather than pulse amplitude, as the pulse amplitude\nmodulation (PAW) requires complex programmable analog circuits [12]. In this work, an ideal pulse width-encoded memristive synapse model is utilized in the simulations to ensure both rationality and simplicity.

            "text": "The MSQ triplet STDP is proposed based on the time division multiplexing (TDM) STDP concept in [13]. The first step is to design a circuit to reproduce the trace. As described by (3), the update and decay dynamics of trace match the behaviors of a capacitor that charges to a fixed potential from a voltage source and discharges slowly through a resistor. Thus, a trace module consisting of a switch \ud835\udc46, a resistor \ud835\udc45 , and a capacitor \ud835\udc36 is designed to capture the dynamic of the race, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The trace value is represented by the capacitor voltage \ud835\udc49 , which is charged to 1 V once the \ud835\udc46 is switched on by neuron spike and discharged exponentially through \ud835\udc45 with a time constant of \ud835\udf0f = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc36 when the \ud835\udc46 is switched off, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The value of the race is sampled every millisecond, exhibited by the black dash line in Fig. 3(b). Then, the sample values are converted into pulse widths utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM), as shown in Fig. 3(c), referring to a rising-edged sawtooth carrier signal with peak amplitude \ud835\udc49 (the blue line in Fig. 3(b)). Note that the \ud835\udc49 is not the exact value used in the following\nsimulations, but only for the convenience of demonstration.\nThe schematic diagram of the proposed MSQ triplet STDP circuit is depicted in Fig. 4 in which the circuit described by formulas (7) and (8) is implemented based on the circuit building blocks in MATLAB Simulink and the interconnection relationship between blocks is represented by the connecting lines. The detailed diagram schematics of the utilized circuit building blocks are exhibited in Fig. 5. In this circuit, Pre has one trace module to characterize the trace left by the Pre spike, while Post has two trace modules to characterize the fast and slow traces left by the Post spike. The slow trace of POST is delayed for 1 ms, to make its value read at the arrival of Post spike, just before updated. The delay module adopts the same design as the sample-and-hold module in PWM. For the LTP, two parameters \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc34 are utilized to control the magnitude\nof weight increment. Thus, amplifiers \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc3a are employed to control the relative size of \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc34 . An adder and a Gilbert cell-based multiplier are utilized to implement the numerical operation. Finally, the amplitudes of weight modulation signals are converted into pulse widths through PWM modules. The peak voltages of the input sawtooth carriers of the PWM modules in Pre and Post module are \ud835\udc49 and \ud835\udc49 , respectively, which control the magnitudes of LTP and LTD.\nThe TDM scheme is employed to deal with the read-write dilemma which is a typical issue of mutual interference between spike signals and weight modulation signals. The signals are transmitted by frame, with each frame comprising three timeslots. The signal imposed on the P/N nodes of the synapse is selected by the multiplexers (MUXs) in turns, which is controlled by a decoder driven by a \ud835\udc40 = 3 counter. An exemplary situation is illustrated in Fig. 6(a), where a Pre spike is emitted in the first frame and a Post spike is emitted in the second one. The signals imposed on the P/N nodes are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c), respectively, and the voltage across the synapse is shown in Fig. 6(d). Thus, a LTP signal exceeding \ud835\udc49 is generated, and then the LTD is by a similar way but in the following timeslot. Following, the function of the designed circuit is verified through modeling and simulating in Simulink & Simscape. To construct circuit model, the Level-1 model is adopted for CMOS devices and ideal models provided by the simulation platform are adopted for the integrated component, including the digital parts, OPA, and signal sources."

The parameter fitting procedure is as follows.\na) Set the time constants of the RC circuits in trace modules to the same value as the time constants of their corresponding trace.\nb) Set \ud835\udc3a and \ud835\udc3a according to the relative size of \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc34 . c) Adjust \ud835\udc49 and \ud835\udc49 according to the magnitudes of\nLTP and LTD. This work aims to implement the algorithm with a memristive circuit. Thus, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the circuit results and algorithmic model is used to assess the performance, calculated by\n\ud835\udc38 = 1\n\ud835\udc43\n\u2206\ud835\udc4a \u2212 \u2206\ud835\udc4a\n\ud835\udf0e (1)\nwhere \u2206\ud835\udc4a is the weight change obtained from the algorithmic model, and \u2206\ud835\udc4a is the weight change obtained from the proposed circuit, \ud835\udf0e is the measured standard error mean of \u2206\ud835\udc4a , and \ud835\udc43 is the number of measured data."

The pairing protocol is utilized in this experiment, in which 60 Pre-Post spike pairs with a time interval of \u2206\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc61 are elicited at different repetition frequencies \ud835\udf0c, as shown in Fig. 7(a). It is observed that LTP goes up with \ud835\udf0c increases, which is not possible in the pairwise STDP [4]. The results suggest that the proposed circuit can replicate the algorithmic model accurately, with a NMSE of only 1.78%."

            "text": "The MSQ triplet STDP circuit can also achieve a good match with the algorithmic model that is fitted from experimental data of the hippocampal cultures [4]. Firstly, the time interval between adjacent spike pairs is set to be 1 s through setting \ud835\udf0c = 1 Hz, which is long enough to make the effects between pairs negligible. The weight change induced by 60 continuous PrePost spike pairs with a delay of \u2206\ud835\udc61 is shown in Fig. 7(b). By this way, the pairwise STDP learning window is reproduced, which proves that the proposed circuit is compatible with pairwise STDP.\nTriplet protocol is another experimental method studied, where 60 triplets of Pre-Post-Pre and Post-Pre-Post spikes are repeated at a frequency of \ud835\udf0c = 1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. Different combinations of time intervals \u2206\ud835\udc61 and \u2206\ud835\udc61 are used to estimate the weight modulations under certain circumstances. The NMSE between the results of the circuit and algorithm model is 6.48%, which is mainly caused by the time scale of the TDM frame. A frame lasts for 3 ms, which is the minimum time unit of signals. Consequently, the time intervals \u2206\ud835\udc61 and \u2206\ud835\udc61 used in the simulation are approximate values. For example, 10 ms is assumed to be 3 frames which is 9 ms in fact. Additionally, the trace drop within a frame can also deteriorate the accuracy of weight modulation.\nFinally, the quadruplet protocol is studied with 60 quadruplets repeated at frequency \ud835\udf0c = 1 Hz. In each quadruplet, a Pre-Post pair with a delay of 5 ms is followed by a Post-Pre pair with a delay of -5 ms a time \ud835\udc47, as shown in Fig. 9. When T is negative, the opposite happens, where the quadruplet becomes Post-Pre-Pre-Post. The results indicate that the proposed circuit is capable of the quadruplet protocol."

Compared with these pairwise-STDP circuit designs in [14] and [15] and the prior triplet-STDP circuits in [6] and [7], the advantages of inhouse circuit design scheme can be summarized into threes aspects, they are the capability, performance, and complexity, as listed in TABLE \u2162 . First, in terms of capabilities, the inhouse design in capable of implementing pair-, triplet-, and quadruplet-STDP algorithms while these in [14] and [15] can only realize the pairwise behavior due to the intrinsic limitation of pairwise-STDP [4]. Second, in the view of performance, the robustness and applicability are enhanced by applying the pulse-width-encoded weight modulation signals, that is, squarewave pulses with identical amplitude but different pulse widths. Comparatively, the utilization of biomimetic spikes in [6] and [7] makes it hard to design the signal generator circuits and control the quantity of weight modulation. Moreover, the inhouse design is more biomimetic in comparison with those in [6] and [7], facilitating its application in implantable medical devices. Third, from the perspective of circuit complexity, all the circuit blocks used in the inhouse design are general modules and each module can be adjusted according to actual needs and available processes. Although, more components are required in comparison with the circuit in [14] and [15], the functions realized by the inhouse circuit are more complex, as mentioned above. In addition, the inhouse circuit is clockdriven, which improves compatibility with conventional digital circuits and enhances its potential as an edge computing device."

            "text": "In this brief, a mixed-signal circuit scheme called multiplestep quantized (MSQ) triplet STDP is proposed, aiming to implement triplet STDP in memristive synapse-based SNN circuits in a more flexible, robust, and practical way. Multiple RC circuits are employed to characterize the dynamic of each trace individually, which facilitate the implementation of complex spike relationship in the circuit. TDM is utilized to eliminate the interference between spike transmission and weight modulation. The weight modulation signal is encoded into pulse width signals through PWM, which is more practical in actual applications, compared to the complex signals used in related works. By replicating the weight modulation results of the algorithmic model following the pairing, triplet, and quadruplet protocols through simulation, the triplet STDP capability of the circuit is verified."
