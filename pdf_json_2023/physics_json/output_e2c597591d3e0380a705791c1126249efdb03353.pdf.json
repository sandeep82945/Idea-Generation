TrkA represents an attractive target for cancer treatment; however, currently available TrkA inhibitors face limitations in terms of resistance development and potential toxicity. Hence, the objective of this study was to identify new allosteric-approved inhibitors of TrkA that can overcome these challenges and be employed in cancer therapy. To achieve this goal, a screening of 9,923 drugs from the ChEMBL database was conducted to assess their repurposing potential using molecular docking.

Delanzomib and tibalosin, the top two drugs with docking scores of \u221210.643 and \u221210.184 kcal/mol, respectively, along with MM-GBSA dG bind values of \u221267.96 and \u221250.54 kcal/mol, were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamic simulations, confirming their stable interactions with TrkA. Based on these findings, we recommend further experimental evaluation of delanzomib and tibalosin to determine their potential as allosteric inhibitors of TrkA. These drugs have the potential to provide more effective and less toxic therapeutic alternatives. The approach employed in this study, which involves repurposing drugs through molecular docking andmolecular dynamics, serves as a valuable tool for identifying novel drug candidates with distinct therapeutic uses. This methodology can contribute to reducing the attrition rate and expediting the process of drug discovery.\nKEYWORDS\ncancer, tropomyosin-receptor kinase A, repurposing, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, drug discovery, health and wellbeing"

            "text": "Tropomyosin-receptor kinases (Trks), a subfamily of the protein kinase superfamily, belong to the receptor tyrosine kinases and consist of three isoforms: TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. These isoforms function as receptors for the neurotrophin family, which includes high-affinity growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), which binds to TrkA, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5), which bind to TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT3), which binds to TrkC (Wang et al., 2009).\nPrevious experimental research has provided cumulative data indicating the involvement of Trks in the pathogenesis of a diverse range of human cancers, which has led to their recognition as promising targets for cancer treatment (Wang et al., 2009; Alam et al., 2017). TrkA, in particular, is considered oncogenic, with mounting evidence pointing to its overexpression and involvement in cancer development (Griffin et al., 2020). It is the most common isoform of Trks and is frequently associated with gene mutations or fusions, which result in the formation of oncogenes responsible for approximately 7.4% of all human cancer cases (Guo et al., 2022).\nTrk inhibitors can be classified into four categories based on their binding interactions: type I, type II, type III, and type IV (Wu et al., 2015). Type I inhibitors are ATP-competitive and bind to the ATP active site. Type II inhibitors, on the other hand, are ATP noncompetitive and exhibit pseudo-competitive binding kinetics by extending into a deep hydrophobic pocket within the ATPbinding site. Type III inhibitors are allosteric and bind adjacent to the ATP-binding site, while type IV inhibitors bind to regions other than the kinase domain of the protein (Yan et al., 2019). Type II inhibitors offer higher selectivity than type I inhibitors, but their large molecular size limits their druggability. However, both type I and type II inhibitors face challenges due to the emergence of secondary mutations in the ATP active site of Trks, particularly TrkA. Type III and type IV inhibitors provide isoform selectivity, although the effectiveness of type IV inhibitors as anticancer agents remains uncertain (Yan et al., 2019). Therefore, this study aims to identify allosteric TrkA selective inhibitors (type III) to overcome the existing limitations of TrkA inhibitors. These inhibitors could\npotentially be used in the management of various cancers associated with TrkA activation, such as lung, breast, cervix, thyroid, and oral cavity cancers (Lagadec et al., 2009; Sasahira et al., 2013; Faulkner et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Faulkner et al., 2020).\nSimilar to other RTKs, TrkA comprises three domains: an extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain (Amatu et al., 2019). The region between the transmembrane domain and the catalytic domain, known as the juxtamembrane (JM) region, consists of approximately 60 residues. Interestingly, this region exhibits approximately 36% similarity with TrkB and 40% similarity with TrkC (Su et al., 2017; Furuya et al., 2017). In the inactive state, the Asp\u2013Phe\u2013Gly (DFG) motif of TrkA\u2019s activation loop adopts an \u201cout\u201d conformation. This conformation is stabilized by edge-to-face interactions involving three phenylalanine residues: DFG motif Phe669, gatekeeper Phe589, and back pocket Phe575. Together, they form a unique FFF motif, along with the Leu564 residue in the \u03b1-C helix and the JM region. This combination generates an allosteric site adjacent to the ATPbinding site of TrkA (Bagal et al., 2019). X-ray crystallography studies have revealed that this allosteric site binds type III inhibitors, effectively maintaining TrkA in an inactive conformation (Simard et al., 2009; Heinrich et al., 2010). Therefore, this study leverages the knowledge of this allosteric site to identify type III TrkA inhibitors, utilizing its potential for modulating TrkA activity.\nThe process of drug discovery and development is known for its high attrition rate, involving significant time, cost, and effort, making the introduction of a new drug to the market a challenging endeavor (Mohammed et al., 2022; Gowtham et al., 2022). In the field of cancer research, the strategy of drug repositioning or repurposing has gained widespread application. This strategy involves repurposing approved or investigational drugs for new indications that were not initially intended for their use (Pushpakom et al., 2018; Gazerani, 2019; Omer et al., 2022). By leveraging existing drugs, the drug repositioning approach significantly reduces the time required for the drug discovery process by 3\u20135 years, lowers costs by $0.3 billion, and reduces failure rates in the later stages of development. This is because the drugs being investigated have already demonstrated sufficient\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org02\nsafety profiles, enabling them to swiftly enter phases II and III of clinical trials (Fu et al., 2022; Issa et al., 2021).\nComputational techniques play a vital role in drug repurposing, encompassing various approaches, such as molecular docking, genetic association, pathway mapping, data mining, and signature matching (Fu et al., 2022).\nIn this study, molecular docking coupled with MM-GBSA calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate drugs from the ChEMBL database. The aim of this study was to assess their potential for repurposing as drug candidates for cancer treatment, specifically targeting the TrkA allosteric site."

To prepare the TrkA structure for subsequent calculations, a three-step processing procedure was performed using the Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro.\nIn the first step, basic adjustments were made to the protein structure, including assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen atoms to those that were missing, creating zero-order bonds for metals and disulfide bonds, converting selenomethionines to methionines, filling in missing side chains and loops, removing water molecules beyond 5.00 \u00c5 from heterogroups, and generating potential ionization states of heteroatoms at a pH of 7 \u00b1 2.\nThe second step involved optimizing hydrogen bonds and assigning orientations to the crystalized water molecules. The protonation states of the residues were also determined using the PROPKA tool at a pH of 7.0.\nFinally, the third step involved restrained minimization, which was performed using the OPLS4 force field (AbdElmoniem et al., 2023). This step aimed to achieve a more stable and energetically favorable conformation of the TrkA structure for subsequent calculations.\nWe downloaded the drugs library from the ChEMBL database at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/. Specifically, we focused on the category of drug molecules. Within this category, we narrowed our focus to small molecules, which encompass various types, such as FDA-approved, world-approved, and investigational compounds. In total, we selected 9,923 small molecules from this category, representing a diverse range of therapeutic classes. To prepare the library for further analysis, the LigPrep tool in Maestro was employed (Alzain and Elbadwi, 2021). LigPrep not only generated low-energy three-dimensional structures for the input compounds but also produced multiple output structures for each compound. This was achieved by considering various factors, such\nas possible ionization states, tautomers, and stereoisomers.

Glide is a powerful tool that accurately determines the positions and orientations of ligands within the active site of the receptor, providing valuable information on the compounds\u2019 affinity and activity (Alzain and Elbadwi, 2021; Meng et al., 2011). It employs various scoring functions to rank and select the best poses for further analysis (Friesner et al., 2004). Glide offers three levels of docking methodologies: highthroughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra-precision (XP). Each methodology differs in accuracy, with HTVS being the fastest but least accurate and XP being the most accurate but time-consuming. The docking time for screening one compound ranges from 2 s (HTVS) to 2 min (XP) (Eltaib and Alzain, 2022). These methodologies can be used sequentially to efficiently filter a large number of compounds. Furthermore, the molecular docking performed by Glide sets the stage for predicting the free-binding energy using methods such as MM-GBSA calculations.\nFIGURE 1 Overall work summary.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org04\nAfter preparing the library of FDA-approved drugs (9,923 molecules) using the LigPrep tool, we generated a total of 23,334 conformers and tautomers.

On the other hand, the reference/TrkA complex exhibited six hydrogen bonds, involving GLY483, SER484, LEU486, ARG673, and ASP668 residues. Additionally, it formed one halogen bond with HIE648, one pi\u2013cation interaction with LYS544, and hydrophobic contacts with LEU486, LEU564, LEU567, MET587, PHE589, ILE572, VAL573, PHE575, LEU641, PHE646, ILE666, and PHE669 (Table 2; Figure 2C).\nThe ligand\u2013residue interaction analysis provides insights into the differences observed in the docking scores and MM-GBSA dG bind energies among the reference, delanzomib, and tibalosin complexes. The reference compound showed the highest number of hydrogen bonds (6), followed by delanzomib (3) and Tibalosin (1). This highlights the importance of hydrogen bond interactions in contributing to the binding affinity of ligands (Klebe and B\u00f6hm, 1997; Chen et al., 2016; Anandan et al., 2022).\nIt is worth noting that the interactions observed between delanzomib, tibalosin, and specific residues in the TrkA protein align with findings from previous research articles investigating small molecules as TrkA allosteric inhibitors (Furuya et al., 2017; Su\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org05\net al., 2017; Bagal et al., 2019; Subramanian et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2022). For instance, ASP668 has been reported to form hydrogen bonds with several top inhibitors discovered by different scientific groups. In the case of tibalosin, ASP668 interacts with the hydroxyl group and the amino group of the (2R)-2-[(4-phenylbutyl)amino] propan-1-ol moiety through hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions, respectively. Although delanzomib does not form a hydrogen bond with ASP668, it establishes hydrogen bond interactions with LEU486, LYS544, and GLY670, which have also been documented in previous studies (Furuya et al., 2017; Bagal et al., 2019; Subramanian et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2022).\nFurthermore, previous studies by Guo et al. (2022) and Bagal et al. (2019). have emphasized the significance of hydrophobic interactions with LYS544, LEU564, and PHE589 in TrkA\nallosteric inhibitors. In the case of delanzomib and tibalosin, both compounds form hydrophobic contacts with LEU564 and PHE589 and establish a charged positive contact with LYS544.\nAdditionally, a thorough review of the identity and previous records of delanzomib and tibalosin was conducted to determine if any documented activity or correlation with cancer treatment exists.\nDelanzomib is an orally active boronate-based proteasome inhibitor that specifically targets the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (Dolloff, 2015). While information regarding delanzomib\u2019s impact on bone remodeling is limited, one study has explored its effects on osteoclasts (Zangari and Suva, 2016). In a study by Mopei et al., delanzomib demonstrated promising efficacy and antimutagenic properties in human multiple\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org06\nmyeloma cell lines and patient-derived cells (Wang et al., 2019). Additionally, delanzomib has shown significance in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). When combined with ritonavir, these two drugs exhibited synergistic effects in suppressing colony formation and inhibiting the growth of renal cancer (Isono et al., 2018).\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org07\nTibalosin, a phenylethylamine derivative, has been shown to reduce arterial pressure in hypertension animal models (Staessen et al., 1983). It exhibits potent antihypertensive effects; however, side effects prevent its clinical use at a daily dose of 150 mg. Combination therapy with a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking medication appears to be more effective in treating hypertension than thiazide therapy alone (Staessen et al., 1986). Currently, there is no available data linking tibalosin to cancer or its anticancer properties.\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org08\nIn conclusion, based on the docking, MM-GBSA, and interaction pattern analysis results, delanzomib and tibalosin demonstrate promise as TrkA inhibitors. Delanzomib has reported an anticancer activity, while tibalosin presented a potential anticancer activity as a TrkA inhibitor, which is being reported for the first time in this study. Furthermore, both drugs were subjected to a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study to further explore their behavior and interactions."

MD simulation provides a more realistic representation of the dynamic behavior occurring under physiological conditions, allowing for a thorough investigation of the complex\u2019s stability,\nflexibility, and binding interactions (Kumar et al., 2019; Jordaan et al., 2020; Aghajani et al., 2022; Gowtham et al., 2023).\nIn this study, MD simulations were conducted for the complexes of the two best compounds, delanzomib and tibalosin, with TrkA, as well as the reference structure (the co-crystallized ligand of 6D20). The analyzed data include the root mean square deviation (RMSD), the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the protein\u2013ligand contacts observed during the 200 ns simulation.\nStarting with the RMSD analysis of the protein\u2019s C\u03b1 atoms (Figure 3), it can be observed that the protein exhibited a similar pattern of deviations with an average RMSD of 4.31 \u00c5 when complexed with the two compounds and the reference. This average RMSD value is relatively compatible, as an RMSD of 1\u20133 \u00c5 is generally acceptable for small globular proteins (Obubeid et al., 2022). It indicates the overall stability of the TrkA\u2013ligand complexes. Delanzomib exhibited the lowest range of RMSD values, indicating greater stability than tibalosin and the\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org09\nreference. Delanzomib also showed minimal fluctuations along the simulation duration, with an average ligand RMSD of 2.81 \u00c5. It is worth noting that the behavior of delanzomib closely resembled that of the reference.\nOn the other hand, tibalosin initially exhibited high fluctuations during the first 100 ns of the simulation, but its behavior became more similar to the reference in the second half of the simulation. Although tibalosin showed higher fluctuations, its average ligand RMSD of 1.63 \u00c5 was the smallest among delanzomib (2.81 \u00c5) and the reference (2.61 \u00c5).\nThe flexibility of the TrkA protein and the movement of its residues were assessed by monitoring the RMSF value of the C\u03b1 atoms. A lower RMSF value indicates less flexibility and greater stability (Alzain, 2022). As shown in Figure 4, the protein exhibited similar RMSF patterns with both compounds and the reference, with an average RMSF value of 1.59 \u00c5. The low average RMSF value, combined with the previously discussed average RMSD values, confirms the stability of the studied complexes.\nThe protein\u2013ligand contact histogram (Figure 5) provided information about the binding and non-binding interactions between the protein and the two compounds, as well as the reference, during the simulation. The delanzomib\u2013TrkA complex formed contacts with SER484 (H-bond 10% and water bridges 50%), VAL647 (H-bond 25%, hydrophobic 3%, and water bridges 22%), HIS648 (hydrophobic 60% and water bridges 40%), ASP650 (water bridges 25%), and PHE704 (hydrophobic 30%).\nThe tibalosin\u2013TrkA complex interacted with LEU486 (hydrophobic 40%), LEU567 (hydrophobic 20%), PHE646 (hydrophobic 70%), and PHE669 (water bridges 5%). Considering the significant role of H-bonds in the binding of an inhibitor to a kinase (Wu et al., 2021), these results suggest that delanzomib exhibits higher inhibitory activity than tibalosin. This conclusion is supported by the protein\u2013ligand contact histogram, which shows that delanzomib forms H-bonds with two residues, whereas tibalosin does not form any H-bonds.\nThe reference\u2013TrkA complex had contacts with LEU567 (hydrophobic 15%), VAL573 (hydrophobic 35%), PHE589 (hydrophobic 30%), LEU641 (hydrophobic 20%), ASP668 (H-bond\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org10\n70% and water bridge 30%), PHE669 (hydrophobic 45%), and ARG673 (H-bond 2%, hydrophobic 3%, and water bridges 37%).\nIn conclusion, based on the MD results, delanzomib and tibalosin were identified as type III inhibitors, as they exhibited similar effects on the protein compared to the reference molecule (a potent, selective, and allosteric type III TrkA binder named molecule 23) in terms of RMSD and RMSF plots (Bagal et al., 2019)."

Among the 49 compounds, nine exhibited MM-GBSA dG bind energies below \u221250 and were selected for detailed analysis in this study. The interaction patterns of the top two drugs, delanzomib and tibalosin, were examined.

Subsequently, delanzomib and tibalosin underwent MD simulations, demonstrating good stability at the protein\u2019s allosteric site.
